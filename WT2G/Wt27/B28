(Additional fee required)
<P>
<li> <B>Using and Teaching the Information Highway</B><br>
Workshop leader: <A HREF="syll97_fac.htm#fac89">Lillian Biermann Wehmeyer</A>, Ph.D., Azusa Pacific Univ.<br>
From the desktop, connect with libraries, periodical indexes, people, and organizations for comprehensive and up-to-date information. Teach your students to do the same. This session offers a comprehensive, integrated, step-by-step search procedure that integrates all forms of information, and is applicable to all disciplines. Lillian Wehmeyer, professor and director of the Ed.D. program at Azusa Pacific University and a former librarian, brings to this workshop an unusual combination of experiences and special insights into the design of the Educator's Information Highway.
<P>
<li> <B>Web Page Interfaces to Back-End Databases</B><br>
Workshop leader: <A HREF="syll97_fac.htm#fac60">Randy Peelen</A>, University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point<br>
Using Web pages which interact with back-end databases allows students to use a comfortable interface to add to or access course-relevant data, without the additional burden of having to learn the operation of a specific database package. This mechanism also allows professors to provide a secure method for giving students guidance and information, while allowing the students flexible access to course-relevant data. This workshop will explore the practical uses of such Web page interfaces to databases. Participants will also learn how to allow colleagues to access the data for professional reasons.
<P>
<li> <B>Create a Course on the World Wide Web in an Afternoon-Using Web Course In A Box</B><br>
Workshop leader: <A HREF="syll97_fac.htm#fac63">Susan Polyson</A>, Virginia Commonwealth University; <A HREF="syll97_fac.htm#fac69">Steven Saltzberg</A>, Randolph Macon College<BR>
Creating online course materials often requires technical expertise and time that the typical faculty member lacks. Or, faculty discover that significant technical staff support is required. Web Course in a Box is designed to allow faculty to create and serve online courses using fill-in forms and online templates. It also allows faculty to easily control access by assigning student log-ins and passwords. In addition, no knowledge is required of HTML, the standard language for developing Web pages, and Web Course in a Box automatically puts pages on the Web server. Participants may bring a diskette with their class syllabus for a hands-on experience of how easy it can be.
<P>
<li> <B>Strategies for Publishing on the Web</B><br>
Workshop leader: Roy Tennant</A>, UC Berkeley<br>
Creating Web documents is just the beginning in building an effective Web site on which to publish your materials. Clear policies and procedures must be drafted, approved and promulgated; a consistent user interface and templates to assist in its application should be designed; methods for dealing with the submission of files in multiple formats are required; and constant attention must be paid to style and design issues. This workshop covers important strategies for Web publishers. Good and bad examples of Web sites are presented to illustrate key concepts of Web publishing. Tips on how to be a good Web manager are discussed.
<P>
<li> <B>Animation and the Web</B><br>
Workshop leader: <A HREF="syll97_fac.htm#fac24">Alistair B. Fraser</A>, Penn State University<br>
Faculty building Web-based courses can incorporate client-side animation in their Web pages. Motion on a page can now be employed for purposes that range from cute, eye-catching promotion to serious, interactive 
pedagogical models. Many different approaches are evolving that enable moving images on a page: GIF animation, Java, QuickTime, VRML, and plug-ins that allow long-standing animation programs to display their output. This workshop will sample some examples and discuss the relative advantages of the various approaches as they are at the moment. However, it will concentrate on one of the simplest approaches-GIF animation-and then turn to the one that requires a plug-in-Shockwave animations created with Macromedia Director, a leading animation package on the Macintosh and Windows platforms. Note: Content in this session partially overlaps with Managing Courses on the World Wide Web.

<B>Faculty/ Student Communications: The Wake Forest University Template-
A New Tool for Creating Communities on Campus and Beyond</B><br>
<A HREF="syll97_fac.htm#fac10">David G. Brown</A>, Provost, Wake Forest University
<P>
The Wake Forest Template provides an electronic file cabinet for every course, every student organization, every campus committee, and many other specialized purposes. All "file cabinets" store digital data in one of ten standard drawers. This case study shows how the template and these drawers are used. Attendees will be given a free copy of the Wake Forest Template on CD-ROM.

<B>Practical Ideas For Evaluating Instructional Technology Projects</B>
<A HREF="syll97_fac.htm#fac08">Carl Berger</A> and <A HREF="syll97_fac.htm#fac43">Tricia Jones</A>, Information Technology Division, University of Michigan
<P>
Practical ideas for formative and summative evaluation. A tutorial for developing a complete evaluation package for instructional technology projects. Includes surveys, critical reviews, protocols, guidelines and much more. While all pieces are too much for any one project, the ability to pick and choose from tools and processes can provide for any project. Case studies from the Office of Instructional Technology as well as others will be used to highlight the evaluation process.
<P>
Evaluating instructional projects is often required by the design team, the sponsor, and the instructor. Rather than a haphazard process that would come after the project is done, the presenters recommend that evaluation should be built in from the start but that it not consume great resources or time. In addition, it should be practical, providing real information to all parties long before a project is done. To really inform it should be able to measure cognitive, behavioral and affective influences of the project on the instruction and on student learning. Doing evaluation seems rather straightforward. The difficulty is deciding what aspects to evaluate and how (what techniques to use). This session presents a variety of practical techniques, shows example documents and how techniques are applied. The presenters illustrate why evaluation teams should use 2 formative and 2 summative techniques as a minimum.

<B>Technology Coupon Cutting: Faculty Support on a Shoestring (BEG)</B><br>
Moderator: <A HREF="syll97_fac.htm#fac25">Nancy Frishberg</A>, Ph.D., Executive Director, New Media Centers; representatives from 3-4 small colleges
<P>
A panel of 3-5 participants from smaller campuses discuss how interesting projects and activities can succeed without spending massive amounts of money. The panel will share tips on making dollars go farther: how to apply those "smart shopper" instincts you've honed from years of cutting coupons and being a graduate student, to the task of creating a synergistic New Media Center and useful new media applications for faculty and students. Students as tutors for faculty, bartering skills, getting external support for projects with payback to the community barely scratch the surface of possible ideas for faculty and support staff who want to implement New Media ideas today with limited budget. We will also highlight how to amplify a small infusion of equipment or dollars to have the largest impact on teaching and learning using new media.

<P>
Not since the introduction of chalkboards in the 1800s has the classroom been so challenged in regard to its basic design and pedagogical setting. Neither overhead transparencies nor TV monitors provided the kind of dynamic, interactive capabilities seen on today's high resolution monitors. Indeed, it is precisely the evolutionary symbiosis of powerful computers and good software that today provides the first real challenge to the traditional classroom setting. This one hour panel discussion will provide a forum to discuss a wide variety of issues and opportunities confronting faculty as we move into the 21st century.

<B>Reaching Distant Learners:  Corporate Perspectives</B><br>
How two different technology companies are organizing to provide distance learning services and technologies higher education.
<P>
<menu>
<B>Reaching Distant Learners</B><br>
<A HREF="syll97_fac.htm#fac31">Bernard Gifford</A>, Ph.D., Chairman and Founder, Academic Systems Inc.
<P>
For the past several years, Academic Systems has worked in partnership with faculty and administrators in colleges nationwide, developing, implementing, and improving mediated-learning courses. The results have been as good or better than expected: pass and retention rates have increased, as compared to similar but traditionally taught courses, and evidence indicates that students exiting mediated-learning courses achieve higher grades in subsequent courses than peers who have had traditional courses in preparation.
<P>
In fall of 1996, Academic Systems began to test increasing the accessability of mediated-learning courses by making software deployable beyond its traditional classroom LAN environment. As a second step in the drive toward greater access, the company, working with a select group of colleges, prototyped a virtual classroom experience. Beginning in early 1997, a select group of colleges will begin offering mediated-learning courses to students, who will be able to offer the courses over the Internet. In this presentation, representatives from participating partner campuses and Academic Systems will relate their experiences with distributed mediated learning.
<P>
<B>Just in Time Training: Distance Learning on the Desktop</B><br>
<A HREF="syll97_fac.htm#fac92">Jack M. Wilson</A>, Ph.D., Chairman of ILINC and Dean, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute
<P>
Distance learning technology has become increasingly interactive with the advent of software and hardware tools for the distribution of video conferencing and multimedia content authoring. Research indicates that students benefit from both synchronous (instructor-led) and asynchronous (student-centered) learning modes. With the latest delivery tools, it is possible to combine the best of both methods on standard PCs.
<P>
Dr. Wilson discusses real learning applications, linking instructors (trainers) and participants (employees) from remote sites in a desktop computer environment that includes interactive multimedia, distributed video conferencing and true application sharing. The discussion will include "success stories" concerning specific distance learning applications from corporate training and higher education.
<P>
Many corporate training departments have been directed to reduce costs while improving the quality of their educational product. The challenges of training an increasingly diverse and distributed workforce/student population bring distance learning solutions into sharp focus. Traditional methods of distributed learning have been limited by both hardware and software for delivery systems and course creation/management. New technology combinations can overcome these limitations and achieve new levels of efficiency and quality.
<P>
In traditional training sessions, training managers present information using transparencies, hand-outs, slides, video, and live demonstrations. They may create exercises for participants to complete individually or within a shared space (the blackboard). Trainers may also write comments on participant's work or add information to a transparency with a pen. Participants may take notes on their own or on handouts provided by the instructor. They may also collaborate on exercises in formal teams or informally with other participants during a class discussion. Participants may raise their hands, and when called upon, ask a question. The instructor can either answer the question or have another person answer it, hence facilitating a class discussion. Unfortunately, the instructor can only present experts who are currently in that facility unless a prerecorded video is available.
<P>
Most large corporations offer substantial training and development for their employees. It has been shown that these organizations can considerably cut training costs by adopting multimedia computer based instruction. The costs are primarily incurred up front in design and production of media and purchase of equipment. The ongoing costs for training delivery are much less when using multimedia computer based instruction. Distance learning can combine the benefits of live instruction and interaction with the cost efficiencies of multimedia computer based training and video conferencing. The obvious savings are by eliminating the cost of bringing people to a central location. The less obvious, and often larger, savings are found by eliminating the unproductive traveling time and in the increased efficiency and retention of the training.

<B>Getting Started with Education Technology: A Tutorial for Faculty (BEG)</B><br>
Hunter L. Kennedy, Professor, Hawaii Pacific University
<P>
A presentation of classroom technology materials integrated into a traditional classroom to enhance education. Items demonstrated will include CD-ROM video clips integrated into PowerPoint presentations, creative examples of a number of traditional multi-media items, and the use of Internet and e-mail to expand the scope of classroom activities. Overlying the presentation is the author's conclusion that technology is still too hard for the average faculty member who has significant research, community and committee requirements in addition to teaching responsibilities. Suggestions will be made regarding the type of support and assistance from a variety of entities to expand the adoption of technology in the classroom-and how such support might be fostered. Each attendee will be provided a floppy disk containing materials related to the presentation, including a classroom template with instructions and commentary and numerous useful public domain and classroom use authorized clip art.

<B>Case Study/Economics: Freshman Seminar Course Enhanced by Standard, Ubiquitous and Portable Computing</B><br>
<A HREF="syll97_fac.htm#fac10">David G. Brown</A>, Provost, Wake Forest University
<P>
A Freshman Seminar on the meaning of the liberal arts education is enhanced by in-class networking among students, during-class feedback, practical examples of theoretical concepts drawn from contemporary newspapers via the Internet, draft essays critiqued and improved by student subgroups, out-of-state alumni participation in subgroups, continuous e-mail dialogue, and a hot-linked syllabus. The learning theories underlying the design of the course and actual examples of class activity will be presented. Presentation of the material will include several Lotus Cam tapes. Attendees will take away knowledge of the course design and technique that will enable them to create their own variations of the course at their home institutions.

<B>Wired Prose: Student Internet Publishing</B><br>
John LaRoe, English Lecturer, University of Missouri-Kansas City
<P>
In this presentation, a university English instructor dissects his own case studies to explore the whys and wherefores of interactive, on-line student publishing in html (hyper-text markup language, the programming language of the World Wide Web), in Usenet newsgroups, and in MOO (multi-user object oriented programming language).  Appropriate applications for college-level English composition classes will be described.  Sample syllabi and student-authored texts will be accessible on-line prior to the presentation (http://cctr.umkc.edu/~rjlaroe/). Conference attendees are encouraged (but not required) to review these materials in advance to facilitate an audience-centered discussion following the presentation. Suitable sites for student MOO exploration and on-line "how-to" manuals for introducing student authors to newsgroups and html will be identified.
<P>
<B>From Papers to Pages: Teaching Writing for the Web</B><br>
<A HREF="syll97_fac.htm#fac20">George L. Dillon</A>, Professor of English, University of Washington
<P>
This presentation will focus on what is different about teaching writing for the Web. Writing for the Web includes all the major aims of writing: artistic and self-expression,finding and exchanging information, advocating positions and debating public issues, and providing instruction. Some of what we know about teaching these things transfers to the Web medium, but Web writing has its own demands and preferences, as in the structuring of material, visual display, and closure of projects. These points are illustrated from the work of students of English 481 in 1996. How to prod, critique, and guide student writers in a studio/lab environment will be discussed, along with the larger issue of getting them to see themselves as Web authors.
<P>
<B>Freshman Composition</B><br>
<A HREF="syll97_fac.htm#fac17">Sherill Cobb</A>, Professor of English Paul Galantay, Webmaster, Collin County Community College District
<P>
Presentation will identify the pros and cons of offering an online freshman composition/rhetoric class requiring discussions on the electronic forum, e-mail communications, research on the Internet, and individual Web site creations. The software programs used to accomplish the course work will also be discussed.
<P>
Even though the class meets once a week, the  students do a great deal of work online, such as discussing assignments, using electronic forum and e-mail. They do research using Netscape Navigator to browse World Wide Web and Claris Home Page to create Web sites. When students meet, they discuss the reading selections, principles of good writing, strategies of rhetoric, newly discovered sites, electronic discussions, e-mail communications, and other relevant topics that should be addressed in a workshop atmosphere.

<B>Case Study/Science, Biology: Virtual Biology Laboratory</B><br>
John T. Beneski<A HREF="syll97_fac.htm#facx"></A> and <A HREF="syll97_fac.htm#fac86">Jack Waber</A>, Department of Biology, West Chester University
<P>
This is a CD-ROM based series of laboratory modules designed as an alternative to the traditional laboratory format for a college level, general education basic Biology class. It is an interactive series of modules covering a wide range of topics from cell chemistry to ecology. It is currently being beta-tested in a large class of approximately 500 students where, in addition to using Bodyworks 4.0 for a human dissection, it has completely replaced traditional laboratory activities. The program will be demonstrated and its effectiveness discussed.
<P>
"Virtual Biology Laboratory" is designed to improve and expand the educational effectiveness and efficiency of biology laboratories for non-science majors Incorporated into the laboratory, are a series of 10 modules that cover topics generally addressed in a basic biology course.
<P>
The modules are: Size and Scale, Cell Division, Microscopy, Cell Structure, Photosynthesis, Respiration, Cell Chemistry, Ecology, Genetics, and Membranes. Within each module are exercises designed to accomplish the following: (1) expose students to the of "tools" used by biologists to acquire information about living organisms, such as microscopes, radioisotope counting, electrophoresis, chromatography, etc., (2) support and illustrate topics/concepts from either the lecture portion of a traditional class or assigned readings from a textbook associated with a non-traditional educational enterprise, and (3) Allow students to actually "do" science by performing experiments, acquiring data, then using the data to explain/help understand some biological concept or phenomenon.
<P>
These goals are attained by utilizing a mixture of tutorial and truly interactive techniques that allow students to generate "raw" data that must be analyzed and interpreted. The program is unique in that the students actually must do science. They design experiments, collect and analyze data, and draw conclusions based on their analysis. This allows for the PROCESS of science to be taught, rather than the mere memorization of facts.
<P>
The presenters are currently testing the program in a non-science majors' general education, basic biology class with an enrollment of approximately 500 students. In the test, traditional laboratories have been completely replaced with the Virtual Biology Laboratory supplemented with Bodyworks 4.0. Data comparing student performance in the course overall as well as in the laboratory portion of the class with data from previously semesters taught using the traditional laboratory format will be presented. In addition, the presenters will discuss the implications of this technology for other types of educational delivery formats.
<P>
No special computer skills are required to use Virtual Biology Laboratory; a basic familiarity with a graphical user interface is sufficient to navigate through the program. Indeed the modules are designed to encourage experimentation and exploration; if you don't know what to do, try something. Every attempt has been made to design an engaging and educationally effective teaching tool. Financial support for development of Virtual Biology Laboratory was provided by McGraw-Hill/Wm. C. Brown Publishers.

<B>Case Study/Special Education: Creating A Graduate Program Using Distance Education</B><br>
<A HREF="syll97_fac.htm#fac94">Elizabeth A. Winston</A>, Ph.D. Research Director, Educational Linguistics Research Center, <A HREF="syll97_fac.htm#fac53">Christine Monikowski</A>, Ph.D., Assistant Professor, National Technical Institute for the Deaf/ Rochester Institute of Technology
<P>
When the student population is a geographically dispersed group of working professionals who are highly valued in their home communities, distance education may be the most cost effective method of building a base for a graduate education program. Drs. Christine Monikowski (RIT) and Elizabeth Winston (independent scholar) are supporting instructors around the country who lead interpreter education programs in 2-year colleges. The impact on their home institutions would be devastating if these graduate students took off a year or more to attend classes. But, by intermixing brief face-to-face work (2 days in fall 1996, a week in subsequent summers) with extended periods of email and conferencing (6 months following the face-to-face encounters), these students can continue to support their own communities while pursuing further education. Monikowski and Winston hold an optimistic view of the potential for distance education. It can provide a cost-effective means for emerging disciplines to bring graduate education to an initially small target student population.
<P>
In this presentation, the presenters discuss two courses that have been offered at a distance for interpreter educators, focusing on the uses of CMC and face to face communication in addressing the needs of interpreter educators. This approach to professional advancement and education is especially attractive for professions that have limited memberships scattered over wide geographical areas.

<P>
This presentation describes a project developed at theUniversity of Mississippi that facilitates the use of NASA Earth Observation data in community colleges through the use of 3D visualization techniques creating a virtual campus on the Internet. Using techniques found in 3D interactive games, students complete laboratory assignments. While the software being designed is for Earth Observation data it is also being adapted to other subjects including the humanities. The project has developed a model that allows for students at the University to staff computer laboratories whose purpose it is to develop online lessons for the community college faculty. The community college faculty develop lesson ideas and submit them to the laboratory where they are converted to a script format appropriate for use on existing Internet browsers. The faculty member need have no expertise in technology, they need have only a desire to use technology in their classrooms. The role of the faculty is to provide lesson ideas, structures and evaluation methods to the laboratory staff. Once the lessons are completed any student enrolled at any of the 15 community colleges can participate in a lesson, and have the results recorded into a database also created for the lesson.

<A HREF="syll97_fac.htm#fac51">Chris Luebkeman</A>, Chinese University of Hong Kong
<P>
The use of the WWW as an educational tool has become a topic of intense interest among educators of all levels and ages. Multimedia and the WWW are revolutionizing the ways that technology is utilized in education: they provide the means to reach an unprecedented number of first-time and life-long learners in every discipline; and they enable visually oriented students to learn numerically based material  (such as architecture students learning engineering principles). This presentation describes the radical shift to a WWW based site which was developed by the author at the University of Oregon.  It currently consists of over 2,600 HTML pages of text, images, JAVA and VRML models and is accessed on an average of 5,000 times a day.  The site structure, conceptual rationale for the utilization of the WWW, the course structure and the utilization of the WWW as an organizational and communication tool for the instructor will be discussed. The student's changing reactions to the site will be described in conjunction with the current developments.

<B>Developing an Interactive Designer Resource</B><br>
Professor <A HREF="syll97_fac.htm#fac91">John Whitehill-Ward</A>, University of Washington
<P>
The presenter developed a course under an innovative teaching grant last spring from UWired at the University of Washington. The course was created to improve the manner in which we provide for student instruction regarding design history, theory, and practice while engaging the students in a creative collaborative endeavor focused on the practical application of multimedia information design. Using multimedia authoring tools, the class worked to develop a system which would provide for the presentation of significant historic and contemporaneous individuals and events associated with the design disciplines. The completed system was intended to act as an electronic, online informational resource for other design students.
<P>
Each student worked independently on the development of a particular designer biographical presentation, for example: architect Frank Gehry, graphic designer Neville Brody, or industrial designer Raymond Loewy. The resulting individual presentations are self contained, each with a unique graphical user interface and visual character based upon the nature of the subject designer. The intent was to investigate appropriate interface design and create viable models. These individual Designer Profiles became modules within a larger database and are user selectable by means of an Index Menu. This menu enables a user to conduct designer searches based upon a variety of categories and criteria, including discipline, period, and project type. The completed prototype system makes extensive use of media-based interactive qualities associated with the technology including animation, sound, film, and dynamic user interaction and navigation. This presentation describes the methods used to plan, organize, and implement the course; and it demonstrates a working model of the prototype program featuring a number of student designer profiles.

<B>Case Study/Information Literacy: Teaching The Net Without A Net</B><br>
<A HREF="syll97_fac.htm#fac41">Dallas Kenny</A>, Multimedia Instruction Coordinator and Director
of the InfoMagic Information Literacy Project, Chapman University
<P>
"Teaching the Net Without a Net" shows how one university developed a series of network simulation tutorials and integrated them into the curriculum. The focus is on how to design interactive internet tutorials which are not dependant on less-than-reliable networks to function properly. Automatic reporting and user-feedback features are also explored.
<P>
This case study will review the development of Chapman University's innovative InfoMagic Explorer series, the first interactive multimedia course for teaching "information literacy" to be fully integrated into a university curriculum.
<P>
Created with MacroMedia Director and other software tools, Explorer gives students intensive hands-on practice in the fundamentals of a variety of information access skills including internet log-on, e-mail, navigating the WEB, using LC subject headings and call numbers, Boolean search techniques for finding information in the library catalog and remote databases, and utilizing search engines such as Wilson, Silverplatter, and InfoTrac.
<P>
Despite inflated claims to the contrary, the Internet is not yet ready for real interactive multimedia tutorials. Moreover, anyone who has tried to use the internet to teach in a classroom setting knows that relying on network "up time" to deliver content at a designated class time is risky at best. InfoMagic Explorer solves this problem by delivering realistic Internet, WEB and online database simulations that are impervious to network zaps and quirks. We have found that it is sometimes best to "teach the net without the net."
<P>
Explorer automatically tracks student progress through 20 information technology skill sets and generates individualized student progress reports for some 35 Freshman Seminar and English 104 instructors. Explorer for English 104, a companion module offered during the students' second semester, provides realistic network simulations for searching online journal indexes and other higher level research tasks. Finally, a "free access" kiosk version of the program allows anyone to access all of the training modules for review or first time instruction.
<P>
An interactive survey at the end of the tutorial provides university administrators and faculty with an "information literacy" profile of the freshman class. The survey also gathers user suggestions for improving the program. This provides a way for faculty, students and administrators to participate in program modification and development.

<A HREF="syll97_fac.htm#fac23">Susan Fell</A> and <A HREF="syll97_fac.htm#fac35">Cecil Greek</A>, Florida State University
<P>
This presentation will cover issues related to the creation, testing, and delivery of Internet-based distance education courses in criminology. Topics discussed will include funding and start-up issues, initial planning and overcoming faculty concerns, instructional systems design issues, working with a collaborative team to create interactive multimedia course content, beta testing the courseware, delivery, and evaluation. FSU is currently co-producing criminology courses for Internet delivery with a major publisher. Under a site licensing agreement, any university can use the materials, distributed via CD-ROM, for distance education courses or as supplementary Internet enhancements for existing classes. Presentation will be a tutorial combining comments and observations with presentation of Web pages.

<A HREF="syll97_fac.htm#fac42">Coco Kishi</A>, Tim Rowe, and Sheila Warren, ACITS Center For Instructional Technologies, University of Texas at Austin
<P>
The Multimedia Production for Natural Sciences course at the University of Texas at Austin has been offered for 5 semesters, and is an intensive semester long course in which students learn basic multimedia development tools and individually work on a project for a faculty sponsor. This is one of the first courses offered on this campus that provides hands-on training to students in multimedia development for CD-ROM output and it is the core of a growing curriculum at UT Austin.  Applications covered in the course include: Macromedia Authorware, Director, Soundedit16, Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, Premiere, NIH Image, Apple QTVR and a host of utilities for Windows and Macintosh. There is also a significant design and theory component to the course.  Students are highly motivated to take the course, as a result of the popularity of the WEB, CD-ROMs, and computer-based instruction.  At the same time, growing interest by faculty in multimedia treatment for their courses prompted this collaborative effort in which faculty provided projects for students to develop. Samples from several student projects will be demonstrated.
<P>
This course demonstrates that with technical guidance and hands-on practice, students with very little previous computing experience can effectively learn a variety of multimedia production tools. In collaboration with a faculty member, a single student can rapidly design and build interactive multimedia instructional presentations that faculty can use in their courses. The collaborations are fruitful for both the student and faculty member, while producing multimedia instructional materials for a large audience.

Towards the Virtual University: Monterey Institute of Technology, ITESM

<P>
In 1994 the presenters started a project called "Towards the Virtual University." The project has grown to become the centerpeice of the Virtual University effort on the campus, with one of the most important research groups in the field within the Monterrey Institute of Technology (ITESM) working at the Mexico City Campus. They have developed six virtual courses, with more to come next year. Pedagogical validation is a permanent effort. This validation extends over to the computer technology side. The group applies the latest ITS technology as a team. The Introductory Spanish Writing project is a prime example of this level of complexity, given its artificial intelligence-bound characteristics. The presenters will demostrate the specifics of this complexity, and of the cooperative methodology used by the academy and the Virtual University Dept. to cope with it, as well as the software product itself and its validation scheme.
<P>
Preliminary results will be presented of a research and development project aimed at the Virtualization of a High School course called Redacci&oacute;n Remedial (Introductory Spanish Writing, ISW). This effort is part of the larger one called "Towards the Virtual University" (TVU). The presenters believe that a virtual course is not feasible through a single-discipline teamwork. Bringing together interdisciplinary teams allows them to implement realistic, down-to-earth Intelligent Turtors (ITSs) which are socially accepted and subject to a pedagogical validation process.
<P>
This process will be demonstrated using the example of the Introductory Spanish Writing course, ISW. The professor requires the students to be inmersed in a series of real-life situations where the good practice of Spanish writing is vital for the success of a related activity (ie., professional work, journalism, speech writing, drama, etc). The system will probably not succeed with standard instructionist practices, given the hard motivational challenge. The presenters attempt to cautiously move towards the constructivist paradigm, with a strong motivational element included in the ITS.
<P>
What is the reason to utilize an ITS? The answer is simple. Constructivism requires that the student learn on his/her own. Teacher and teaching models must be non-monotonic and at the same time allow independent actions by the student, so he/she will learn to learn. Therefore, the ITS should act "intelligently" and be able to measure and give hints, about Spanish syntax and semantics (not only grammar rules). The instructor must also be able to review a log of these independent actions, so more in-depth personalized feedback can be issued. An example of such hints is: The student is placed in a situation where a letter to a client must be written. A set of agents aid the student in the process. Furthermore, the memo can be sent to a [real life] qualified individual for additional checking. This person is reachable only through electronic means. The finished memo will be reviewed by all the student's classmates. The system will help the student in receiving the feedback from other people. Documentation on the situation will be presented as proof of the situation being experienced.
<P>
The problem of semantic checking within a price of writing has not yet been fully solved by the Artificial Intelligence (AI) community. A subset of the problem will therefore be attacked first, using Bayes Networks and distributed computing in the form of educationally-placed software agents implemented in Java. It is not our intention to persue out-of-reach goals. The application of AI alone often leads to the dissapearing of the original (ie. physical, human) model. Cartesian math often provokes this distortion to take place. The conjunction of AI and Instructional Design technologies, therefore, is key.
<P>
The presenters will validate the effectiveness of the implemented software using the EMI Model within the World Wide Web. A mix of technologies should now be obvious. No single member in the team is capable of performing the whole act on his/her own. Cooperative efforts require an efficient management scheme , which has been put into practice since 1994. The presenters feel that this is probably their strongest point: teamwork.

<A HREF="syll97_fac.htm#fac11">Jacqueline Brown</A>, Princeton University; and Willie Pritchard, De Anza College
<P>
The crisis in American higher education has precipitated a reexamination of how students learn and are taught. Evidence suggests that in selected areas of the curriculum, use of multimedia or "new media" can move learning from the theoretical to the more empirical; it can help students grasp difficult concepts more easily, build a broader historical and cultural context, and manipulate course materials advantageously in ways not easily accomplished before. Examples from the Princeton experience will focus on the humanities and social sciences. However, these beneficial developments have significant impact on strategic planning for university support infrastructure, from teams who create the curricular materials to the technical network plant and upgrades to the physical classrooms.

<B>The House The West Built: Student Projects On The World Wide Web Clayton</B> 
<A HREF="syll97_fac.htm#facx50">Miles Lehmann</A>, University of South Dakota
<P>
Clayton Miles Lehmann teaches history at the University of South Dakota. His presentation describes the preparation by college students under his direction of multimedia research projects on the World Wide Web. In 1996, his students in Western Civilization developed a multimedia project entitled The House the West Built@ (http://www.usd.edu/honors/hwb.html). Working in groups of about five persons each, the students selected and researched some aspect of Western Civilization and presented their results on the World Wide Web. They used text, graphics, sound, and video within an HTML environment readable by common browsers such as Netscape, Mosaic, and Internet Explorer. Thanks to their ingenuity and hard work, this project succeeded in presenting the fruits of traditional historical reflection in innovative ways, using existing and developing computer- and Internet-related technologies.

<B>HISTCON: Interactive e Study of Construction History</B><br>
<A HREF="syll97_fac.htm#fac04">David L.Batie</A>, Ph.D., AIA;  Assistant Professor, East Carolina University
<P>
Current teaching methods for architectural history seldom embrace building technology as being an essential component of architectural study; although it is generally accepted that architectural history is a fundamental component to the architectural learning environment. Accepting that architectural history is fundamental to architects, it is argued that the study of construction history will further enhance student knowledge in architectural history and building design.  This hypothesis prompted an investigation of the ways in which the study of construction history could be used to strengthen present methods of teaching architecture and architectural history. Prevailing strategies for teaching architectural history were analyzed and compared with educational instructional design applications that use object-oriented programming and hypermedia. The development of the HISTCON interactive, multimedia educational computer program provided a mechanism to test the significance of construction history in the study of architectural history. Employing a quasi-experimental testing procedure, the study of architectural history, using a construction oriented methodology, was shown to have a positive correlation to increased understanding of architectural components relevant to architectural history and building construction.
<P>
The HISTCON program development took place over the past year with testing taking place in the Spring 1996. HISTCON was created as a supplemental learning device to use in traditional college level architectural history courses. When confronted with large survey level course structure, professors are limited in their allotted time and areas of expertise to fully provide the full spectrum of information concerning built architecture. One of the areas often overlooked is in building technology and the technological advances developed as adjunct components. In order to provide an opportunity for the student to become aware of that domain of architectural history, the first working model of HISTCON was created to teach 19th Century iron & steel. The placement of this program into an existing class environment exposed an experimental group of students with additional data that a control lecture room environment group was not given.  The results justified the need for supplemental learning programs in architectural history, as well as providing additional information that assisted students' understanding of the built environment. The program continues to evolve and is expected to be available over the World Wide Web for programs of study in architecture and construction.

<B>Religious Studies: The Perfect Team-A Home-grown CD, Some AVI, and Thee</B><br>
<A HREF="syll97_fac.htm#fac07">Alfred Benney</A>, Professor, Department of Religious Studies, Fairfield University
<P>
The goal of this project is to develop a prototype electronic resource for scholars who teach basic courses in the Humanities. There are four elements: the recording on S-VHS video of short "academic insights" from well-known scholars in the discipline of Religious Studies/History of Religions; the preservation of these responses using AVI digital technology; the organization of these "videos" using a ToolBook front end for hyperaccess; and making the programming transportable and available for classroom and archival use by burning it onto a CD. This presentation will describe in detail the development of this programming, pedagogical strategies used and will demonstrate the application.

<B>Philosophy: Making Web Courses Work</B><br>
<A HREF="syll97_fac.htm#fac85">Bill Uzgalis</A> and <A HREF="syll97_fac.htm#fac21">Jon Dorbolo</A>, Oregon State University
<P>
In this case study, the presenters will provide a demonstration of the QuestWriter Web course management/authoring system developed at Oregon State University and the Web courses in which QuestWriter is being used.
<P>
Teaching courses entirely on the Web requires significant management of resources and student work by the instructor. Reducing the management load for instructors is crucial for making Web courses that can really work for the mainstream faculty. At Oregon State University the presenters have been conducting full Web courses since Fall 1994. In Fall 1996 they successfully installed QuestWriter, a sophisticated Web course management environment. QuestWriter allows for authoring and management of advanced teaching methods by the Web. The presenters' first term experiences with QuestWriter in several courses shows the advantage the system has for instructors. Their experiences also raise important issues for educators and Web programmers to consider. What is a "Web Course" and what does "online management" really mean?
<P>
QuestWriter features Web-database integration that allows course sign-up, gradebook generation, quiz creation and administration, immediate T-F or multiple choice quiz grading and feedback, discussion activity authoring and management, student folders, student activity monitoring, adaptive page production, student progress reporting, and more. QuestWriter is being used in CalculusQuest (Differential Calculus), IQ Odyssey (Introductory Philosophy), and Great Voyages (History of Modern Philosophy) at OSU. Collaborative efforts with faculty at Eastern Oregon State College and other institutions are producing real uses of QuestWriter as well.
<P>
The power of QuestWriter is in the priority given to teaching strategy and pedagogical needs in the programming design. The programs were fashioned to solve problems and serve the needs of real courses. In demonstrating the management software, the presenters will explain the pedagogical methods and teaching strategies they have found effective in the Web courses (having been taught on the Web since Fall 1994.) This session will provide information for educators and programmers on the effective means of managing coursework on the Web. Educators will gain specific strategies and activities they may use in their own courses.

<P>
The presenters will describe the Global Citizen project, a model for developing interactive, problem-solving exercises that incorporate international and interdisciplinary concepts and issues. The internet-based project is shown through a live demonstration of specific modules created by the Global Citizen faculty team.
<P>
The project provides faculty throughout the college the opportunity to participate in the creation of cases on the World Wide Web that explore relevant topics. This project was address needs considered crucial by the U.S. Department of Education in developing the workforce of the future: (1) reform of the curriculum through interdisciplinary and international coursework reflecting the global economy of today; (2) full integration of technology into coursework; (3) linking school work to the workplace by providing career preparation skills; (4) creation of a program that is both race and gender friendly, that blends excellence and equity, particularly in the area of technology.
<P>
The Global Citizen Project is a curriculum reform model that harnesses technology as the "packhorse" that delivers solutions to a comlex group of needs. It is based on the conceptual framework of the Global Citizen Inc., a hypothetical international conglomerate that employs graduates of the University System of Georgia. Students in every class in the core curriculum are given job assignments that are prepared by a collaborative effort of fifty DeKalb College academic and technology specialists and, uniquely, with local corporate input. The problems focus on timely and relevant topics ranging from genetic engineering, to marketing a newly patented product in the Middle East; or handling the diplomatic challenge of how to persuade Chinese businesses to stop bootlegging software. Each problem requires the examination of at least five interdisciplinary topics necessary to satisfactorily resolve the problem. Problems are also international in nature, requiring an understanding of a variety of international issues ranging from languages, politics, economics and cultural philosophy.
<P>
The Global Citizen Project is designed to be replicative so that the college can link not only with colleges and universities throughout the state and nation, but with high schools as well. While incorporating technology throughout the core curriculum, rather than as a scattershot effort in its use, the project uses a collaboration between industry and education in the preparation of problem solving exercises relevant to industry.

<A HREF="syll97_fac.htm#fac77">Suzanne J. Smith</A>, Ph.D., Norman Scarborouh, Department of Economics and Business Administration , Presbyterian College
<P>
This session examines using the Web in two different business classes to (1) access relevant company data, industry resources, and management theory and research; (2) generate enthusiasm for business research; and (3) show how businesses are using the Web to increase sales in areas ranging from music CDs and real estate to brownies and ostrich products. In a small business management course, students evaluate census data, discover international trade information from the Commerce Department sites, and use marketing skills to put together a small business plan. In a management and organizational behavior course, students evaluate Web sites and contribute links to a Web page in order to highlight the body of knowledge in management theory and link it to practical examples.

<B>Music: An Interactive, Multimedia Distance Learning Environment for 	Music and Technology</B><br>
<A HREF="syll97_fac.htm#fac18">Robert Cooper</A>, <A HREF="syll97_fac.htm#fac72">Reynold Simpson</A>, University of Missouri-Kansas City
<P>
This presentation will briefly review hardware and software requirements for a distance learning program in an educational institution. The main body of the presentation will focus on the creation of multimedia files that can be ported to Web pages and the demonstration of the wide variety of multimedia uses in the University of Missouri-Kansas City's Virtual University Environment.
<P>
Digital technology is rapidly changing the fields of music and music education. The very way that music is composed, disseminated, and experienced has been widely effected. The computer is now a musical instrument and the Web is now a concert hall; compositions of digitized sounds are posted on the Web, while music publishing and music listening are  desktop events  The education of today's musician requires an education in computer and related technologies.
<P>
The UMKC Virtual University project at the Conservatory of Music uses advance technology itself to teach musicians about computer technology and its applications in music. The Conservatory faculty have developed 13 one-credit-hour distance learning course modules, bases on existing uses of technology in music, that are available to both on-campus and off-campus students through the Internet. The first module, Internet for Musicians, is a prerequisite for all others. The other 12 modules include Composition of Electronic and Computer Music, MIDI for Musicians, Finale for the Serious Musician (music notation software), and statistical software packages for Music Education/Music Therapy. The module design of this project allows students to custom design their own course. And while the modules were developed for distance learning, several are now integrated into on-campus courses.
<P>
Each module integrates multimedia instruction with Web technologies to create an interactive learning environment. Course content is presented through a mixture of hypertext, inactive graphics, sound, spoken dialog, and video. Interactive Shockwave files, CGI scripting, and Java scripting and applets allow students to connect the components of digital synthesizers and hear their results in real time. Visual and sound effects reinforce student progress through course materials and positive responses on self-paced quizzes. Music and computer terminology is in hyper-text, indexed with links to both textual definitions and graphic examples. Animation and digital video simulate on-screen activity to help students visualize the use of computer software. A log of student use, quiz results, e-mail, and interactive chat windows complete the communication between students and faculty.
<P>
Teaching technology with technology is effective and efficient. It allows for larger enrollments, curriculum and course flexibly, greater student competency, and an enhanced interaction between students and faculty.
<P>
The presentation will include a direct link to the UMKC Virtual University Web page.

<P>
As the instructional development specialist (Tina Buck) and instructional technology manager (Cheryl Rae) at the Rio Grande Campus of Austin Community College, the presenters create computer-based materials for faculty to enhance curriculum delivery. Here, they demonstrate a presentation tool that they created for a theater instructor that would allow her to more easily present visual information for a costume and theatrical design course. The presenters designed the project in HTML, realizing they could easily incorporate text, graphics, digital photos, and digital video. Designing and producing in HTML not only resulted in an economical and efficient classroom delivery method, but also created a Web-ready course that could be offered over the Internet.

<A HREF="syll97_fac.htm#fac55">Sonja Moore</A>, Director of the Language Learning Center and Instructor of French, Virginia Commonwealth University
<P>
The presenter will show detailed examples of how the World Wide Web has been successfully integrated into an elementary and intermediate-level French class in an intensive format. She will discuss how the World Wide Web component was conceived initially, the pitfalls, student expectations, and student performance. She will also discuss issues of World Wide Web-based syllabus design, homework activity design, the addition of multimedia, the potential for self-paced learning, as well as issues of student accessibility.
<P>
Much has been said and written recently about the wealth of foreign language information available on the World Wide Web. However, there exist few cases of the World Wide Web being fully integrated into a foreign language course. Many of the foreign language Web sites are indeed no more than lists of links to other sites. The materials to be demonstrated may be viewed at http://www.fln.vcu.edu/Moore/intro.html.

<B>Entrepreneurship</B><br>
<A HREF="syll97_fac.htm#fac80">Deborah Streeter</A>, Cornell University
<P>
 Digitized video clips from interviews with entrepreneurs are used in a multimedia format to create a "virtual panel" of guest speakers in the classroom. The panel enters into class discussion in a flexible and non-linear manner. The purpose of the presentation will be to demonstrate the use of digitized video in a multimedia format for classroom and Web use. In addition to showing how such material is assembled and used in the classroom, video clips of student reaction will be included to guide a discussion on the effectiveness of using multimedia.
<P>
The best technology applications in the classroom: 1) begin with a good teaching idea (and not just a fancy new technology), and 2) are designed to engage rather than to entertain. Streeter's teaching idea stemmed from the desire to make better use of outside speakers in a class on entrepreneurship. Speakers had come to class providing more content than the students could absorb. In addition, the wide array of material was not always in synch with the class syllabus. Streeter had often wished she could have a "pause" or "replay" remote controller when she listened to the speaker.
<P>
When digitized video became a practical reality on campus (about two years ago), Streeter saw the chance to transform the entertainment of guest speakers into content-oriented student discussions. She began to do extensive video-taped interviews with entrepreneurs across the country. She digitized the interviews, cut them into pieces by topic, catalogued the clips, and burned them to CD. Using the database and a HyperCard interface, she created a tool for the classroom which puts as many speakers as she wants around a conference table. We can call on them at any time during the classroom discussion. She can use them to engage, enrage, reinforce, show diversity and to bring life the conceptual material. This provides an opportunity for the class to "get to know" the entrepreneurs throughout the semester, on a topic-by-topic basis. Teleconferencing and e-mail are used to supplement. Currently, Streeter is developing a Web site which will house the audio (with
picture) portion of parts of the video-clip database. The technique has been used successfully for two years in Streeter's courses on entrepreneurship.

<B>Marketing: A Virtual Marketing Course</B><br>
<A HREF="syll97_fac.htm#fac47">Brad Kleindl</A>, Missouri Southern State College
<P>
Missouri Southern State College has been offering a Virtual Marketing Class since the Spring of 1995. This course teaches the theory related to using information technologies to entice customers and it teaches students how to use current information technologies to deliver information to the market. Technologies applied include the Web page creation, Macromedia Director 5, and other content development software. The course attracts cross-discipline majors. In teaching a course like this an instructor faces a dilemma. The course must cover the theory necessary to understand how to develop effective content and how to get customer acceptance of technology. In addition, the instructor must make the students familiar enough with the software to use it as a tool. Both of these goals require time and resources on the part of the instructor and students. This presentation will cover how this is handled in the Virtual Marketing course and give examples of student work with the technologies. One of the solutions to this dilemma has been to expand course offering in the development of a multimedia minor at the college. Dr. Kleindl will describe how he has attempted to balance the presentation of marketing theory and the teaching of software in the same course. He will cover the types of theory which are applicable to his Virtual Marketing class and how students apply this to content creation for the World Wide Web and for multimedia development.

<B>Using WebCaucus</B><br>
<A HREF="syll97_fac.htm#fac58">Virginia North</A>, Arch.D, Associate Professor of Interior Design, <A HREF="syll97_fac.htm#fac79">Stephen Sonstein</A>, Ph.D., College of Health and Human Services, Eastern Michigan University
<P>
With the recent expansion in use and availability of the World Wide Web, several web-based conferencing programs have been developed. The presenters teach classes from very diverse content areas (Interior Design and Clinical Microbiology), but both have used WebCaucus, a web-based conferencing program to supplement the lecture and laboratory components of their classes. Examples of its use are: interactive communication between instructors and students, students and students, and outside content experts and students; posting of graphical content; and journaling of personal reflections. Evaluative feedback from users was overwhelmingly positive and the conferencing methods were universally regarded to be an enhancement to the learning experience.

<A HREF="syll97_fac.htm#fac39">Judith Henderson</A>, Ph.D., LL.D., Professor, Psychology; Andy Howard, Professor, Economics, Rio Hondo College
<P>
Multimedia Interactive Teaching (M.I.T.) is proposed as a way to enhance learning by improving the quality of teaching in community college courses at Rio Hondo College. For the past two years, the presenters have been experimenting with transforming the relationship between themselves and their students by changing the way lecture material is presented, providing out-of-class academic support for students, increasing opportunities for students to interact with each other and with instructors, providing students the opportunity to experiment with state-of-the-art technology, and improving access to courses. The presenters will demonstrate our techniques, share the process through which they developed their programs, and demonstrate the interactive response system.

<B>Case Study/Science, Physics: Interactive Multimedia and the World Wide 
Web</B>
<A HREF="syll97_fac.htm#fac46">Howard Kaplan</A>, University of Massachusetts-Lowell
<P>
The presentation consists of live demos of the newer interactive multimedia technologies found on the Web (Java, VRML, Shockwave, etc.), showing how they may be used for course delivery. Browser examples from an Introductory College Physics Course are included. The challenges these technologies provide to both faculty and administrators, and how these challenges may be overcome are considered.

<P>
<B>Universal Access</B><br>
<A HREF="syll97_fac.htm#fac65">Mark Resmer</A>, Sonoma State University; and <A HREF="syll97_fac.htm#fac10">Dave Brown</A>, Wake Forest University<br>
Universal access is the issue for the next several years-how to provide universal access, at what level, at what cost, and how to achieve equity are among the key questions raised. Training, standardization of system specifications, and many other issues must also be considered.
<P>
<B>When Payup Becomes Payback:  A University's Return on Instructional Technology Investment</B><br>
<A HREF="syll97_fac.htm#fac09">Sylvia Brace</A> and <A HREF="syll97_fac.htm#fac67">Gina Roberts</A>, Middle Tennessee State University
<P>
After several years of investment in instructional technology-related equipment, facilities, and training; Middle Tennessee State University students and faculty are realizing the benefits that technology-based instruction can bring. Two administrators who are heavily involved with promoting technology use in instruction by supporting technology-based classrooms, multimedia carts, faculty development grants, training programs, and a multimedia production facility will summarize the positive impact that technology has made at MTSU.
<P>
Using a combination of survey results; faculty and student interviews; and documented changes that have been brought about at the university as a result of technology integration, the presenters will illustrate not only the benefits that have been reaped by students and faculty but by the university as a whole. Survey results and comments will show that students that are exposed to technology in their courses come to class more often, have increased interest in the subject matter, and feel that they learn more. Faculty find that technology use enables them to re-think and restructure their courses. They are also receiving local and national recognition through their work with technology. The university as a whole is also gaining recognition due to the comprehensive level of support faculty are given in their efforts to integrate technology into their teaching.
<P>
Attendees of this session will hear an overview of the intructional technology initiative at Middle Tennessee State University followed by excerpts from faculty and student interviews and summaries of classroom evaluations that document the positive influence that technology-based teaching has had at MTSU. Faculty recognition programs will also be highlighted, and future instructional technology efforts mentioned.
<P>
<B>Creating a New Media Center on Your Campus (BEG)</B><br>
Moderator: <A HREF="syll97_fac.htm#fac29">Barbara Gersh</A>, New Media Centers<br>
Presenters: <A HREF="syll97_fac.htm#fac28">Philip Galanter</A>, New York University; <A HREF="syll97_fac.htm#fac40">Joan Huntley</A>, University of Iowa; Donna Milici, University of Pennsylvania
<P>
New Media Centers, an international consortium of corporations and institutions of higher education, helps to establish campus-based centers that serve as resources for faculty and students. This panel discussion will include presentations by center directors of three campuses with different center structures, including centralized and distributed models. The panelists will address both organizational and technical issues involved in establishing a center on campus, such as budgeting, staffing, equipment, working with faculty and students, and assessing the impact of the center on teaching and learning. Ample time will be allowed for questions from the audience. This session will be of interest to both faculty and staff who are considering, planning, or creating a new media center or focus for their school.
<P>
Academic members of NMC are selected through an RFP process, and they serve as models for other schools using new media in the development of curriculum. The schools are involved in a wide variety of technologies, including the World Wide Web, multimedia, video conferencing, and computer-mediated communications. There is no "cookie-cutter" format for establishing a successful new media center. The facilities, equipment, and staffing vary according to the requirements of each campus. While some are literally physical "centers," others are distributed at locations throughout the campus. Organizationally, some are within Academic Computing or Instructional Technology and serve the entire campus, some are located within a particular school or department, and others are cooperative ventures between several departments. Some of the issues common to new media centers are gaining the support of the administration, obtaining and maintaining equipment and staff, working with faculty and students, and evaluating the impact and effectiveness of the center.
<P>
<B>Case Study/Music: It Takes More than Two to Tango-A "Team Building" Model for Educational Technology (BEG)</B><br>
<A HREF="syll97_fac.htm#fac33">Daniel Goulet</A>, Director Academic Computing Services; <A HREF="syll97_fac.htm#fac60">Randall P. Peelen</A>, Faculty Software Applications Training Specialist/Manager; <A HREF="syll97_fac.htm#fac62">Patricia Ploetz</A>, Multimedia Technologist; <A HREF="syll97_fac.htm#fac96">Charles Rochester Young</A>, Coordinator of Music Theory and Composition, University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point
<P>
The teaching/learning process does not occur in a vacuum. No instructor, support staff or administrator can single-handedly create an optimum learning environment for many students with different learning styles. When technology is added in the teaching/learning environment, a fundamental "team" commitment is required from the students, instructor, technology support staff, and university administration. Music is a very accessible means to discuss many interdisciplinary teaching/technology applications. This presentation will demonstrate how the "team" commitment at UW-Stevens Point has enhanced the creative development of UWSP music students.
<P>
For the use of technology to blossom in the teaching/learning environment, there must be a fundamental commitment by the campus to develop and support a technologically rich environment that fosters creative teaching/learning for students and faculty. This fundamental commitment must include a "teaching/learning team" of students, faculty, support staff and administration. The faculty member should focus on the message for the teaching/learning environment and not have the medium that carries the message stand in his/her way. The administration should focus on the medium and create the technologically rich environment for the faculty member. The support staff should focus on bridging the gap between message and medium, that is, framing the teaching/learning message through a technological medium.
<P>
<B>Reaching Distant Learners: Management and Support Issues</B><br>
<A HREF="syll97_fac.htm#fac61">Mark L. Peterson</A>, Manager, Technology Support and Development, Education Network of Maine
<P>
The ability to provide distant learners with exceptional customer service in the form of effective technical support is fast becoming a determining factor in the success of a distance education institution and its ability to compete in the twenty-first century. At the Education Network of Maine, five different distance education delivery technologies are used: ITFS microwave, full bandwidth multipoint conferencing, compressed video conferencing, audio conferencing and computer conferencing. ENM's Help Desk supports over 4,000 students taking over ninety courses at over one hundred receive site locations. We also support the ITV faculty and all of the staff needed to provide the delivery of the courses.
<P>
This presentation will examine the relationship between the introduction of distance education technologies and the evolution of the distance education help desk at ENM. It will look at demographics, changing needs, and service expectations of the distant learner. The presenters will discuss how to staff a distance education help desk with different levels of technical support and how to train support staff. They will explain how ENM adapted an shrink-wrapped Help Desk software package to the distance education environment; and they will review the impact that help desk data has made on the introduction of new technologies.
<P>
<B>The Web and Learning: Enhancing Faculty-Student Communications</B><br>
<A HREF="syll97_fac.htm#fac03">Russell Barclay</A>, <A HREF="syll97_fac.htm#fac05">William Beauchamp</A>, <A HREF="syll97_fac.htm#fac38">Marjorie Hatch</A>, <A HREF="syll97_fac.htm#fac44">Travis Jordan</A>, and <A HREF="syll97_fac.htm#fac73">Bob Skinner</A>, Southern Methodist University
<P>
While the Internet is a popular means of communication between college students and professors, no single Internet technology is best for all situations. At Southern Methodist University, the Center for Media and Instructional Technology helps faculty compare and evaluate which tool best meets their needs. The commercial product FirstClass is attractive because it combines many functions in one interface, yet FirstClass is also the most expensive solution. Usenet is an established technology but one that presents more barriers to new users than the rest. Web browsers offer the promise of a single program supporting both communication and class exploration of the Internet, but the reality is somewhat different. Presenters will focus on the outcomes of choosing a particular communications technology and the infrastructure, training, and technical issues necessary for success.

The Web and Learning: Supporting Faculty Use of Technology-University of Minnesota's Teaching Assistant (TA) Web Project
Cheryl Towler, Multimedia Consultant and Linda Jorn, Acting Director, University of Minnesota Digital Media Center
<P>
The University of Minnesota Twin Cities Digital Media Center, a New Media Center, Academic Member; the Arts, Sciences, and Engineering Provost's office; and the Professional Studies Provost's office sponsored the TA Web Project (http://www-dmc.tc.umn.edu/cafe/TA.html) from June to September 1996 to: (1) advance the teaching and learning goals of the University of Minnesota by using Internet tools and specifically the Web; (2) encourage faculty and teaching assistants to use information technology in innovative ways; (3) enhance students' learning experiences; (4) provide students access to course information and interaction with other learners, anytime and anyplace; (6) improve students' information technology literacy skills; (7) share interdisciplinary teaching methodologies; and (8) share source codes for Web documents.
<P>
To participate in the project, TAs applied for and were accepted into the project. Approximately 175 TAs were involved and, with faculty approval, developed Web documents for undergraduate courses. The Digital Media Center supported the project by providing the TAs with courses on the instructional uses of the Internet and on HTML, an electronic-mailing list to promote discussion among TAs, consultation services on Web design and technical issues, access to a Web server for those who needed the space, and WebCrossing software for student communication via the Web.
<P>
To encourage good design, the provost offices and the Digital Media Center hosted a contest. The TAs competed for the five chances to win $1,000 each. On September 1, TAs submitted their Web course sites for judging. Six judges evaluated the 97 contest entries using an evaluation form (http://www-dmc.tc.umn.edu/cafe/TAjudging.html). They chose the top 15 course Web sites, ranked them, and then met to choose the five outstanding course Web sites.
<P>
The Digital Media Center (http://www-dmc.tc.umn.edu), a collaborative venture of Office of Information Technology and University Libraries, provides technical and design support to University of Minnesota faculty and their student and staff assistants who develop multimedia applications for teaching and learning. The Digital Media Center is an Academic member of the New Media Centers.
<P>
Information Literacy and the Evaluation of Web Resources
Paula Hammett, Sonoma State University; Jim Shuman, Northwest Center for Emerging Technologies; and Francine E. Walls, Bellevue Community College
<P>
Information Literacy Across the Curriculum (ILAC) focuses on developing electronic research and critical thinking skills that will assist students throughout their educational and professional careers. This presentation will highlight case studies of five faculty members from various disciplines who have created assignments, projects, and other instructional materials that enable students to develop critical thinking skills and acquire knowledge in the use of electronic information sources and information delivery systems such as the Internet. The presenters will share experiences in the development of course materials and curriculum as well as the implementation of the project.
<P>
To be information literate, a person must be able to recognize when information is needed and have the ability to locate, evaluate, and use the information effectively. Ultimately, information-literate people are those who have learned to learn. Information Literacy Across the Curriculum (ILAC) is a joint project between Bellevue Community College and the NorthWest Center for Emerging Technologies for the academic year 1996-97. ILAC focuses on developing electronic research and critical thinking skills that will assist students throughout their educational and professional careers.
<P>
Integrated into ILAC are information technology projects which include the development of courseware, technical assistance to faculty, the creation of a Web site, and the development of workshops for students and faculty. Those attending this presentation will be provided with all course materials that have been developed and learn how to implement similar projects at their colleges.
<P>
<B>Constructing Effective Technology-Intensive Learning Environments</B><br>
<A HREF="syll97_fac.htm#fac22">Peter C. Facciola</A>, Ph.D., Maricopa Community College
<P>
This presentation will explore how aspects of the classroom learning environment influence the cognitive and affective benefits students receive from working with computers. Recommendations for building effective technology-intensive classroom learning environments are offered. It will examine the learning "payback" to students in technology-intensive classroom environments and offer recommendations for building effective computer learning environments.
<P>
These recommendations are based on an analysis of two case studies: The first is the International Science Classroom project in which students participated in integrated science learning in Arizona and Israel, joined through the Internet. Data from ethnographic analysis and multidimensional scaling showed that students' improved knowledge of science and computer skills were embedded in systemic changes in the complex of social and structural factors which comprise the learning environment.
<P>
The second case is an integrated block of 12 hours of general studies courses at a community college. In this "dynamic learning" classroom, teams of students met course objectives by becoming change agents on issues of social significance. Technology was used for research, writing, data analysis, presentation graphics, communication, and a host of other purposes. Again, qualitative and quantitative data revealed that enhancements in students' reading, writing, communication, and reasoning skills were strongly correlated with changes in the totality of the learning environment.
<P>
These cases suggest that the structure of the learning environment in which computers are placed entices students to use computers in particular ways, and, that the quality of students' interactions with computers profoundly impacts the benefits they receive from computer usage. Based on this analysis, recommendations are offered for building effective computer learning environments including teacher's teaching behavior, teacher-student relations, student-student relations, students' sense of control, and activity engagement styles, among others.
<P>
<B>Teaching for Effectiveness in Online Courses</B><br>
<A HREF="syll97_fac.htm#fac26">Robert Fulkerth</A> and <A HREF="syll97_fac.htm#fac81">Walter Stevenson</A>, Golden Gate University
<P>
The presenters will examine the use of online instructional technology and classroom assessment techniques to teach and to evaluate learning in two college level classes, business writing and management, through case studies of online MBA-management and undergraduate advanced business writing courses.
<P>
As electronic delivery of classroom experiences encroaches on traditional real-time instruction, educators must try to design curricula whose teaching/learning environments deliver course material effectively, and develop team building, communication, and critical thinking skills in participatory, interactive environments.
<P>
The presenters will discuss issues that shape the virtual classroom, including planning for effective teaching and course/program quality; technical and administrative issues; interaction strategies; measuring learning outcomes; student satisfaction; and integrating virtual technologies.
<P>
<B>Ethics and Values in the Information Age (BEG)</B><br>
<A HREF="syll97_fac.htm#fac68">Joel Rudinow</A>, Lecturer in Philosophy and Humanities, Sonoma State
University; <A HREF="syll97_fac.htm#fac16">Philip Clayton</A>, Associate Professor of Philosophy, Sonoma State
University; <A HREF="syll97_fac.htm#fac34">Anthony Graybosch</A>, Professor of Philosophy and Chair of the Department of Philosophy, California State University at Chico; <A HREF="syll97_fac.htm#fac88">Andrew Ward</A>, Ph.D., Associate Professor of Philosophy and Director of the Institute for Social Responsibility, San Jose State University
<P>
A team-taught multi-campus course combining Media Ethics and Computer Ethics, "Ethics and Values in the Information Age" explores ethical issues posed by emerging information and communications technologies. The course employs advanced information and communications technology to engage students andfaculty on three CSU campuses in a collaborative teaching and learning process.
<P>
Students on the campuses of Sonoma State University, California State University at Chico, and San Jose State University, working collaboratively in small supervised teams under the guidance of a team of instructors representing the three faculties, are developing an Internet-accessible modular course, Ethics and Values in the Information Age. Using listserv, e-mail, chat, video conferencing, and a Web site to enhance and coordinate regular classroom activities, this learning community is developing course modules, case studies, an annotated collection of associated background readings, and a series of structured internet activities canvassing a wide array of representative ethical concerns associated with the Information Age. This project is funded by the Sonoma State University Academic Innovation Fund and by the California State University Academic Opportunity Fund for Instructional Technology.

<P>
How to take advantage of the World Wide Web's interactive and enticing nature in your courses. In this workshop, we'll take you step-by-step through the processes of creating forms, setting up a "virtual office," selecting applets, scripts and plug-ins, and making your course Web pages interactive. You'll learn how forms work, how to make plug-ins available for download by your students, and how to use your course Web site as a jumping-off point for class discussions and research. We'll talk about effective and ineffective uses of the Web in education and discuss the Web as a research tool and as an interactive learning aid. After completing this workshop, you will be able to: Use your course Web pages to communicate with your students; set up your pages to take advantage of the interactive nature of the Web; locate and install or appropriate the latest plug-ins, applets, and scripts; work with your Web site without apprehension; identify and make use of effective practices; and use your course Web site for course maintenance tasks. The workshop presupposes skills in HTML and experience with creating a basic Web site.

This session will illustrate the way technology can change the way we teach and learn as well as how to sift among the hype and hoopla. When does Drill and Practice become Drill and Kill? When is multimedia more HYPE-ermedia than hypermedia? How can you spot the difference between a piece of technology that really delivers or really bombs?

Graves</A>, Director, Institute for Academic Technology, Associate Provost for Information Technology, The University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill</B> <BR>Education must be restructured if it is to remain the cultural and economic foundation of a prosperous democracy into the next century. As educators, we will have to join forces with education's non-profit and commercial supporting cast to shift the old capital- and labor-intensive instructional infrastructure of mortar and lectures toward a new national learning infrastructure based on digital technology and intellectual capital. Only then can we hope to restructure our enterprise to contain its cost and to optimize access to education and our contribution to the quality of learning.<p><B>Keynote address: "Stretching The Boundaries-Exploring Education's Digital Toolkit for the 21st Century"</B><BR><B>Speaker: <A HREF="sconf96_faculty.html#Dr. John Warnock">Dr. John Warnock</A>, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, Adobe Systems Inc.</B><BR>The explosion of the World Wide Web has had an unexpected, but well-received side effect, the "intranet." Some say that the number of intranets or internal Web sites within corporations and educational institutions is where the most untapped potential of the Internet lies today. From tracking progress on specific projects to sharing a distributed applications, or having students filling out class registration forms online, the ubiquity of the Web is turning intranets into a giant groupware environment. But the name of the game is running educational institutions more efficiently and cost effectively. What is the reality vs. the perceived benefits of an internal intranet? In this session, Dr. Warnock will discuss today's educational digital toolkit, his vision for the future of the Web, and how we can all reap the benefits of the "intranet."<P><br><LI> <B><FONT SIZE=4>10:00AM-10:30AM Coffee Break</FONT></B><p><br><LI> <B><FONT SIZE=4>10:30AM-12:00NOON  Breakout sessions</FONT></B><br>Three concurrently running breakout sessions related to Web-based environments.  <p><br><B><FONT SIZE=4>Industry Panel: The Web and Education</FONT></B><br><B>Participants: Adobe Systems, SUN Microsystems, Netscape, IBM (invited)</B><br>Technologists from leading Internet technology companies discuss current and future trends with the Internet and the implications for education.

<FONT SIZE=+1>The 10 Most Common Myths of the Information Superhighway</FONT>
<P>
In this excerpt from his book, <EM>Living at Light Speed</EM>, technology writer Danny
Goodman debunks ten commonly held misconceptions about the Information
Superhighway.
<OL>
<LI>"There will be one seamless Information Superhighway linking all the
nation's (or the world's) people."
<P>
Forget it. Far from being a single system with universal access to multiple
services, the Information Superhighway will likely be a jumble of pathways
with a widely varying array of services, many with their own methods of
access. Construction and implementation will be erratic, giving rise to years
of "dribbleware."
<P>
<LI>"You need a personal computer and must be computer literate to get onto
the Information Superhighway."
<P>
Most people associate computers with the Superhighway because that's
where much of the action is today. But, soon, set-top boxes used with
televisions and consumer-oriented personal communicators (also called
personal digital assistants, or PDAs) will proliferate as tools for driving on the
Information Superhighway.
<P>
<LI>"The Internet is the Superhighway."
<P>
Despite statements from advocates as visible as Vice President Al
Gore, the Internet and the Information Superhighway are not
synonymous. The Internet is an interlinked network of hundreds of
thousands of computers that form an archaic, difficult-to-use on- line
system. It is only one element of all that the Information
Superhighway encompasses.
<P>
<LI>"CompuServe, Prodigy, America Online...are the Superhighway."
<P>
Wrong again. Each service offers information available only to its
subscribers, creating a "Balkanization" of on-line worlds. Each also attracts
unique groups for special-interest sectionstheir "virtual communities." Like
the Internet, commercial services are only pieces of a larger information
universe.
<P>
<LI>"Interactive multimedia is the Information Superhighway."
<P>
Because our personal on-ramps lack sufficient bandwidth today, most
interactive multimedia is delivered via CD-ROM. This medium offers little, if
any, connectivity to the Information Superhighway. The transition to on-line
delivery of high-quality interaction will be agonizingly slow.
<P>
<LI>"Only the "haves" will be able to afford the tolls on the Information
Superhighway."
<P>
Ample attention is being paid to guaranteeing "universal access" to all
socioeconomic groups -- if only there were a definition of the "universal
information" we'll all need. But, literacy will be the true divider between the
"haves" and "have nots."
<P>
<LI>"The Information Superhighway will never affect me."
<P>
The simple act of reading this list means that already at least talk of the
Superhighway has affected you. Even those who never directly connect to
the Superhighway will be affected through work, school, and commercial or
leisure interests. Video conferencing will enhance medical care in rural
areas. Telecommunications will move more workers out of the office, and
wireless technologies will extend the Superhighway to any mobile individual.
Whether we ride it or not, we'll all be affected.
<P>
<LI>"I will be crushed under tons of information arriving via the Superhighway."
<P>
Software tools known as "filters" and "agents" are beginning to manage the
informational onslaught for us. As long as we are conscious of their hazards
and limitations, they'll serve us well until even more powerful navigating tools
do the job. The computers that cause the problem will also solve the problem.
<P>
<LI>"The Information Superhighway will create a world of hermits and loners."
<P>
The stereotype of a computer nerd hunched over his keyboard late into the
night is quite misleading. Rather than close off someone from the world,
expect the Superhighway to open up the world for most people. Many places
in cyberspace provide a sense of community among real people. The
Information Superhighway will fight isolation, not create it.
<P>
<LI>"I can't possibly watch 500 channels."
<P>
Few things typify the misleading hype of the coming communications
revolution more than the 500 TV channels myth. Even if a cable system were
capable of broadcasting 500 channels, there will never be 500 programs to
surf with the remote control. Besides, even when television selections
expand (and they will), computers will help sort everything according to
personal preferences.

<CENTER><H1>Web Song</H1></CENTER>
by Richard Kohn, Research Libraries Group Inc.
<P>
It was the morning of January 19, 1994, and Research Libraries Group's first-
ever Internet Surf Party was in full swing. The "surfers" had transformed
RLG's training room into a fantasy of paper palms and donuts. With a dash of
Silicon Valley whimsy, the party was, in part, an excuse for our most serious
techies to drag out their aloha shirts and show the rest of us what they had
been doing at two in the morning to earn dark circles under their eyes. The
event also had a more serious purpose. RLG had been providing
bibliographic information over its own private network and, later, over the
Internet for sixteen years. The "party" was the perfect way to share
information about the more obscure byways of the information highway we
navigated each day.
<P>
As we wove our way through the forest of monitors, gorgeously illuminated
medieval manuscripts appeared like chimeras on PCs. Images from space,
courtesy of NASA, flickered on NeXT workstations. Viewing one after
another, we were transfixed.
<P>
<STRONG>NCSA Mosaic</STRONG><BR>
An application most of us had never heard of before, was giving us access to
a group of servers called "The Web," originally developed by high-energy
physicists in Switzerland. Looped together in seeming violation of the time-
space continuum by strands of hypertext, these servers could pick you up in
California and drop you off in Budapest as fast as you could click on the word
"goulash" (<A HREF="http://www.fsz.bme.hu/hungary/cuisine/goulash_soup.html">http://www.fsz.bme.hu/hungary/cuisine/goulash_soup.html</A>).
This was the best toy on the block and we had to have one. Fortunately,
Michael Carroll, one of our programmer/analysts, was way ahead of us.
Using, as they say, "tools he already had around the house"his trusty 386,
some text RLG already had on-line, plus a copy of the Mosaic web browser
and a web server program that he had downloaded over the Internet from
CERN (European Laboratory for Particle Physics in Geneva, Switzerland,
birthplace of the web)he had already knocked together a prototype web
server on his own. Within a matter of days a web team had appeared at RLG
by spontaneous combustion.
<P>
<STRONG>A Mosaic Application for RLG</STRONG><BR>
Founded twenty years ago by research institutions, RLG had from the
beginning a charter to explore new technologies that could serve research
and learning. Self-directed development was nothing new at RLG. A ground-
up project started five years earlier had developed into a document-
transmission system called Ariel that is now standard at many of the nation's
leading libraries. This atmosphere encouraged experimentation, as long, of
course, as it fit within RLG's mission. With a variety of complex programs,
from cooperative efforts in document preservation (PRESERV) to a Z39.50
service that accessed our bibliographic databases (Zephyr), what we need
was a web server that could dispense up-to-the-minute information about our
programs and services.
<P>
<STRONG>The RLG Mosaic Team</STRONG><BR>
One of the most significant aspects of the project is that no one on the team
that was involved in the development at that stage was a programmer. Bruce
Washburn, who became our project lead when the project became official
enough to need one, is an access services officer. Jon Lavigne and I were
writers. Other members of the growing corps of "Websters" were drawn from
library and bibliographic services, member services, and corporate
communications. We divvied up the work between us: technical writer Arnold
Arcolio would mine for text and refine prose; Jon and Bruce would do most of
the coding; others would dream and scheme and tie up loose ends.
<P>
<STRONG>Aesthetics and Applications</STRONG><BR>
The web has its own aesthetics, and a lot of our time was taken by figuring
out not what should be on the server, but how it should work and look. We
needed about three months to develop the unified look-and-feel that you see
on our server today. We decided early on to make minimal use of graphics in
our top-level pages. This would allow users with slow connections to get
where they needed fast. As nifty as in-line graphics are, we knew that there
were users out there who got into the web through screen-mode or even line-
mode browsers, and we did not want to leave them staring at screensful of
nothing.
<P>
<IMG ALIGN=left hspace=10 SRC="images/broad.gif">
Research Libraries Group's English Short-Title Catalog database, viewed via
Mosaic, links to an image of an eighteenth-century broadside.
<br clear=left>
<P>
Most of all, we looked for material that made "good HTML." A press release
on the English Short-Title Catalog could link to a digitized image of an
eighteenth-century broadside. A group of articles from our triannual print
magazine, The Research Libraries Group News, could become a reference
guide on standards initiatives that RLG and its staff are involved in, from ANSI
to Z39.50, all interlocked via hypertext into a self-fulfilling glossary.
<P>
Other capabilities of the web allowed us to do more than just provide
information; we could build tools as well. By tinkering with public-domain
search engines, Jon provided users of Ariel, RLG's document-transmission
system, with an on-line "phone book" of Ariel sites that they could search
interactively over the web. In Bruce's hands, a list of RLG's 145 member
institutions evolved into a way of instantly linking to the growing number who
had set up their own web servers (46 at last count).
<P>

A page directing users to exhibits put up on the web by RLG members.
(<A HREF="http://www-rlg.stanford.edu/exhibits/museums.html">http://www-rlg.stanford.edu/exhibits/museums.html</A>).
<P>
A former curator, I was eager to serve the museum and archives community.
I envisioned linking the on-line exhibitions that many of our members had
mounted into a virtual museum where you could stroll from the exhibition that
had initially drawn me into the webthe Vatican treasures at Library of
Congressto the Book of Kells at Trinity College, Dublin, and then wander on
to the Georgia O'Keefes at the University of Minnesota's Frederick R.
Weisman Art Museum.
<P>
<STRONG>Web Server Development at RLG</STRONG><BR>
Creating a web server looks like it takes a lot more time than it does. You can
get professional-looking results without much effortjust get some public-
domain server software and plug in your own text and image files. "The
prototype I developed in December of '93 was four pages long," remembers
RLG's Michael Carroll, "a top-level page and three second-level pages: one
for RLIN (RLG's Research Libraries Information Networked.), one for
Eureka (a patron-oriented search service) and Zephyr (Z39.50 service), and
one for staff. I didn't have to write very much myself; I looked around for stuff
on RLG's FTP site and the mainframe and used that. About the only addition I
made was scanning in a photo to go with an _RLG News_ article about one of
our new employees." NCSA has an overview that you can read over the Web
on how to get and install an HTTP version 1.0-compatible server, NCSA
HTTPD. It can be found at <A HREF="http://hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu/docs/Overview.html.">http://hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu/docs/Overview.html.
CERN</A>, where Mike downloaded his server, makes a number of servers
available though its site at
<A HREF="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Daemon/Overview.html">http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Daemon/Overview.html</A>.)
<P>
<STRONG>What You Need</STRONG><BR>
"Mike's server was on a 386 PC-clone, and we envisioned problems with
multiple access: Windows is not the best environment for doing multitasking,"
noted Jon Lavigne. "We soon decided to do it right we had to port our server
over to UNIX. Once you set up on UNIX, though, you need to involve your
systems administrator to deal with security issues." The kind of Internet
access you have is also an issue. Even accessing the Web requires a robust
connection. RLG has a T1 connection to Stanford, one of the NSF's gateways
to the Internet, so this was not a problem for us. Dial-up connections, though,
could present problems. "At the very least, you'd want a dedicated SLIP or
PPP connection, and you'd probably get better performance at a lower price
by finding an Internet service provider who will put up a page for you on their
own server," Jon advises.)
<P>
<STRONG>Preparation with HTML</STRONG><BR>
Web servers are composed of documents written in HTML "hypertext markup
language." Although it sounds formidable, HTML has more in common with
old-fashioned word-processors like WordStar than it does with programming
languages like C or Pascal. Simple codes at the beginning and end of a
phrase, like &lt;a href=> and &lt;/a&gt; turn it into a "hypertext link." Add the name of
another hypertext document, and you have told the machine where the link
leads to. The line of HTML that takes you back to our home page
("welcome.html") from the far corners of our server, for example, reads "&lt;a
href="welcome.html"&gt;Return&lt;/a&gt; to the RLG Home Page.
<P>
There are more tricks in the HTML book, but surprisingly few. Once you have
your ASCII text and know what documents you want to link up, the process
only takes a few minutes per pageonce you get the hang of it, of course!
Several Web servers offer guides to writing HTML, including NCSA's own
"Beginner's Guide to HTML": <A HREF="http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/demoweb/html-">http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/demoweb/html-
primer.html</A>.)
<P>
<STRONG>Maintenance</STRONG><BR>
A web server, like the spider's own creation, needs maintenance to keep
working. Data quickly becomes obsolete. If you grow from 143 to 145
members as we did since we went public, you need to change that number
everywhere it occurs. If you add services, as we did this summer when GPI
(Government Periodicals Index) joined our stable of CitaDel citations
databases, you will not only need new pages, but new links to them on your
old pages. One trick is to use text that others have the responsibility for
keeping current. That way a periodic update can catch schools of small
changes that otherwise might wriggle away.
<P>
<STRONG>Debut</STRONG><BR>
On April 12, 1994, when everything had been checked and rechecked, the
final step was at handannouncing ourselves to the world. Like everything
else on the Web, this is easyjust e-mail an announcement to NCSA's
"What's New" Page (ncsa-wn@gnn.com). During that first week, there were
5,432 connections to our server. A site was born.

<STRONG>WebSite WWW Server for the Windows Platform</STRONG><BR>
O'Reilly & Associates has announced that it will release a 32-bit HTTP server
based on the Windows platform. There are numerous web clients (browsers)
running under the Windows and other operating systems, but web servers
(used to publish on the WWW) have normally been created under the Unix
platform. Available in May, 1995, O'Reilly & Associates' web server software
will provide an alternative to working with the Unix operating system for
those who want to publish on the World Wide Web. WebSite will run on a 386
or higher PC running Windows 95 (or current beta) or Windows NT 3.5. The
WebSite package also provides WebView software which displays your web
in a tree-like structure, enhanced Mosaic 2.0, access authentication, and
various tools and editors. When running WebSite as an application rather
than as a service, users can use a Common Gateway Interface (CGI) program
to run an application like Excel, Visual Basic, or a database program from
within a web document. For more information, contact: O'Reilly & Associates,
Sebastopol, CA; (707) 829-0515, or send an e-mail message to
<A HREF="mailto:website@ora.com">website@ora.com</A>.

<STRONG>NetPublisher Catalogs On-line Resources</STRONG><BR>
Ameritech Library Services has introduced a new Windows-based tool for
publishing information on internal networks and on the Internet. NetPublisher
is a World Wide Web, Gopher, and Z39.50 server that allows users to enter
information just once in the system, which automatically formats the
resources for WWW, Gopher, and Z39.50 protocols. Users can customize
NetPublisher to utilize one, two, or all three of the protocols. The system
eliminates the need for users to learn HTML (hypertext markup language) by
using a template that automatically transfers the information to HTML. The
server runs on a 486 or higher PC running Windows NT 3.1 or higher. An on-
line demo of NetPublisher on WWW is available via <A HREF="http://netpub.notis.com">http://netpub.notis.com</A>.

<HTML><HEAD><title>Highlights from Syllabus magazine, September 1995</title></HEAD><BODY><center><h1>Highlights from Syllabus Magazine</h1><h2>September 1995 issue<br>Volume 9, No. 1<br>Software for the Curriculum</h2></center>The following are summaries from the latest issue of <i>Syllabus</i> magazine which will be published in early September.<hr>If you are not a subscriber <a name="syllsub" href="syllsub.html">Click here</a> to receive a free subscription to Syllabus Magazine, the definitive magazine for high schools, colleges, and universities.<br clear=both><hr><img hspace=10 align=left src="images/septfivecvr.gif">In this issue, we cover software for the curriculum. Today, instructors have an unprecedented selection of CD-ROMs, book/disk sets, and other curriculum software products. But beyond this, the World Wide Web and advanced communications technologies are changing the delivery and structure of curriculum material.<br><br clear=both><br>Some highlights and short excerpts from <i>Syllabus</i> follow:<p><hr><p>Page 10<br><strong>Distributed Learning on the World Wide Web</strong><br>by Steven Salzberg and Susan Polyson, Virginia Commonwealth University<p>Steven Salzberg and Susan Polyson explore how instructors can create innovative courses based on a virtual classroom model, which not only provides electronic supplements to traditional classroom content, but also extends the basic delivery model to include asynchronous group communications, interactive multimedia textbooks, experiential learning, and more:<br><p><blockquote><img hspace=10 align=left src="images/dlone.gif">Distributed learning is not just a new term to replace that other "DL," distance learning. Rather, it comes from the concept of distributed resources. In computing we have been in the process of distributing computer power since the personal computer became a fact of life. Similarly, distributed staffing refers to the decentralization of the "warmware" experts that support the technology. Distributed learning is an instructional model that allows instructor, students, and content to be located in different, non-centralized locations so that instruction and learning occur independent of time and place. The distributed learning model can be used in combination with traditional classroom-based courses, with traditional distance learning courses, or it can be used to create wholly virtual classrooms.<p>The WWW by its very nature distributes resources and information, making it the tool of choice for those interested in delivering instruction using the distributed learning model.<p>As the WWW technologies become more sophisticated, and as the bandwidth of the Internet increases, there will be more tools, and more ways to develop creative distributed learning environments. In a very brief two years, the WWW has shown that it has the potential to be the premier vehicle for distributed learning and can enable and enhance both classroom instruction and distance learning.</blockquote><hr>Page 14<br><strong>So You Want to Publish Academic Software?</strong><br><p>For authors who are wondering about publishing their courseware, information about how to approach the education software market is presented, along with tips on what to consider when evaluating the rewards, recognition, and risks of being a software author. The article lists ten questions to ask yourself as you identify and refine your product concept:<br><p><blockquote>Compared to other potential markets, the higher education market is one of the most promising around. The software market alone is estimated today at $800 to one billion. It has increased significantly in the past 3 or 4 years, and still contains significant potential for future growth. And with much of the hardware already in place on campuses, the future can be found in software, in particular, content-intensive, curriculum-related software.<p>The first step before undertaking a development effort is to examine your personal objectives and commitment to the project. Some authors go into a project for the potential financial rewards involved. Others are interested in achieving the recognition that a successful product can bring: In some cases, the recognition can improve tenure prospects. Finally, some develop products simply because they love the subject matter or computing itself, or a combination of the two.<p>Before starting the effort, examine your own personal motivations. Be sure that your motivations are in line with your own personal or career goals, and at the same time be aware of the realities of the higher education market. Look seriously at whether your effort is more of a hobby rather than a long-term commitment to developing a substantial product. Consider the amount of time and resources that you have available to devote to this project. If the necessary human or financial resources are not available, do you have a realistic plan for finding them?</blockquote><hr>Page 18<br><strong>CD-ROM and Curriculum Products Buyer's Guide</strong><br><p>A guide to products the CD-ROM and curriculum software products that educators use to enhance instruction:<br><p><img hspace=10 align=right src="images/lostmaya.gif"><strong>Exploring The Lost Maya</strong><br>Exploring The Lost Maya is the second in a series of CD-ROMs based on past civilizations by Sumeria, Inc.

But today, these efforts have moved beyond the traditional, and VCU has found itself on the frontiermastering rapidly developing Internet technologies and working to adapt them to non-traditional instructional uses both for on-campus students and distance learners. VCU is currently developing several projects in which the Internet provides a diverse toolset and a rich environment for instructing, interacting, discovering and learning. These Internet technologies include the World Wide Web, Electronic Mail, Usenet Newsgroups, and Telnet.<br><br clear=both><p><img hspace=10 align=right src="images/ramas.gif"><strong>State University of New York, Stony Brook:</strong> Ecology, Conservation Biology, and Wildlife ManagementRAMAS ecological software is used as part of the curricula of three courses at the State University of New York at Stony Brook, in undergraduate and graduate ecology, and in computer programming and modeling for biological problems. The application enables students to build their own population models, simulate the impact of various complex interactions within given parameters, and compute the results. Students can calculate the expected population based on varying factors, determine the reliability of the estimate, and calculate the probability that a given population will fall below a specified threshold during or after a particular time period.<br><br clear=both><p><strong>Oklahoma State University:</strong> German by SatelliteRural high schools face a dilemma: how to give their students the kind of rich German language instruction that is required to meet legislative demands without having especially trained instructors on the faculty. Providing a solution to the problem is the German by Satellite (GBS) program, which uses distance learning techniques combined with computer-based and computer-assisted instruction designed to give students at rural high schools a college preparatory German education that otherwise would not be possible.<br><p><strong>St. Petersburg Junior College:</strong> Exploring Poetry with Virtual RealityAt St. Petersburg Junior College, a virtual reality project entitled Petals is an Interactive Exploration of Ezra Pound's poem "In a Station of the Metro." It combines studying the etymology of key words, visually experiencing the key words, understanding the hidden meanings and implications of literary images, and learning about Pound's life and his creative process. The project, consisting of a HyperCard stack combined with Virtus' WalkThrough Pro virtual reality application, uses a subway metaphor. The student, using a virtual reality helmet, finds himself in a subway with a map that displays which directions he or she can go. Students can either enter a virtual introductory experience in Virtus WalkThrough Pro or access critical material with HyperCard.<br><p><hr>Page 36<br><strong>Publishing</strong><br>Textbook Publishers Prepare New Electronic Products for the Curriculum<br><p>Profiles of textbook publishers that are combining electronic media with their traditional textbook offerings to create new products that teach with multimedia:<br><p><blockquote><img hspace=10 align=right src="images/visability.gif">PWS Publishing Co. recently released a CD-ROM that focuses on visual, non-linear thinking. VizAbility uses lessons and exercises for improving visual abilities of seeing, drawing, and creative problem-solving. It includes a handbook and a sketchbook divided into six units: environments, culture, seeing, drawing, diagramming, and imaging. It is designed for any design-oriented fields, including architecture, graphic design, and interior design.</blockquote><br><p><blockquote>Brooks/Cole Publishing Co. is offering Scientific WorkPlace 2.0, a product that integrates word processing with Maple V mathematical software from Waterloo Maple Software. Brooks/Cole publishes a large number of multimedia psychology products, including MacLaboratory for Psychology Research 3.0 and Exploring Psychological Disorders 3.0. MacLaboratory is a CD-ROM that simulates the experience of conducting research experiments, using movie clips, multimedia, animation, and simulations.</blockquote><br><hr>Page 42<br><strong>On the Internet</strong><br>Begin Your Presence on the WWW: Resources for Creating Your Own Home Page<br>by Roy Tennant, University of California, Berkeley<br><p><blockquote>Professors, staff, and students are rushing to make their own Web "home pages" that depict their research, publications, and personal interests. In a nutshell, all you need to create your own presence on the World Wide Web is one or more text files marked up in a simple tagging scheme called the HyperText Markup Language (HTML) and a computer to serve them to the network. Freeware, shareware, and commercial software are available to turn a standard desktop 486 PC or a Macintosh into a World Wide Web server and still allow you to do your other work on it as well. This article provides pointers to a number of resources that will help you quickly get started on creating your own Web presence.</blockquote><hr>Page 48<br><strong>Distance Learning</strong><br>The Virtual Classroom: Quality and Assessment<br>by Dr. Robert W. Tucker, InterEd Inc.<br><p>An explanation of how computer-mediated distance learning programs can be evaluated by automated assessment software systems.<p><blockquote>For Computer Mediated Distance Learning (CMDL), being hooked to the rocket ship of technology has been a mixed blessing. The rapid progress of this educational environment has out-paced mature understanding. As with any social innovation that challenges an accepted view, there is a mixture of opinion as to the value of CMDL programs. Most of the theoretical work surrounding CMDL has not evolved to the level of central principles, and many empirical claims are based on isolated cases and studies.<br><p>The low incremental cost of automated virtual classroom assessment should make it attractive to those who must conduct assessments on a budget. In addition, automated virtual assessment offers the potential for greater precision and reliability in assessment protocols; it is also inherently less intrusive than most physical assessments and can adapt its procedures more or less on the fly, something very difficult for traditional assessment research.</blockquote><hr>Page 52<br><strong>Administrative Technology</strong><br>Information on Demand: The Campus Kiosk<br>by Glen McCandless<br><p>Glen McCandless takes a look at how kiosks are being used on campuses to create the distributed information infrastructure required for effective student services:<br><p><blockquote>As institutions compete to provide better student service, information kiosks are a single point of contact that enable consistent, unbiased two-way communication between the customer (student) and the vendor (the institution).  The tenet of interactive marketing is the one-to-one relationship.  Students are empowered to self-select the information they want. Schools, on the other hand, can gain intelligence from kiosk users, helping them understand what information and services they can provide to students. Interactive marketing can extend beyond the campus to support recruitment efforts and public relations through kiosks in malls, community centers, high schools, and businesses.<br><p>The diversity and sovereignty of the student population, dwindling financial resources, an explosion of information, and competitive pressures to deliver high quality services make the information kiosk a tool for the times. The shift to decentralization of information resources via client/server supports the openness of the networked campus to coordinate a deluge of information. Improvement in services and re-engineering of business processes yield greater productivity, freeing up time for teaching, research, and an enriched campus lifeand all of this with the touch of a human hand.</blockquote><hr><strong>About the cover:</strong><br>At Cogswell College, in Sunnyvale, Calif., software is integrated into the Computer and Video Imaging curriculum. The cover shows associate professor Tim Harrington teaching an advanced computer modeling applications class. In 1992 Cogswell College pioneered the first Bachelor of Arts to be offered in Computer and Video Imaging.<br><hr><a HREF="index.html"><H3>Back to SyllabusWeb Home Page</H3></a><hr><address>Copyright &copy; 1995 by Syllabus Press, Inc.

Key issues in planning a technology classroom are explored thoughout the issue. A Buyer's Guide includes classroom products such as presentation software, equipment housings, and computer peripherals for presentations and lectures.<br><br clear=both><br>Some highlights and short excerpts from <i>Syllabus</i> follow:<p><hr><p>Page 10<br><strong>"Technology Classrooms, Teaching, and Tigers"</strong><br>by Judith V. Boettcher, of the Center for Academic Computing at The Pennsylvania State University<p>Judith V. Boettcher explores the issues of planning technology classrooms on campus. Today, placing technology in classrooms where it did not exist before and expecting it to be used well in the teaching and learning process, requires systemic change. Dr. Boettcher discusses the core principles of technology change for the campus infrastructure as well as what needs to be done to put a technology classroom into motion.<br><p><blockquote>What do they all have in common? The most obvious characteristic is that each starts with the letter "t". But another less obvious characteristic is that when you first encounter technology classrooms, teaching, and tigers, they all tend to strike terror in your heart. <p>Providing technology classrooms on our campuses today means thinking substantively about the intersection of teaching and learning processes with the capabilities of information technologies. When you consider the infrastructure and organizational issues surrounding this intersection of teaching and technology, you find that implementing technology classrooms is not for the faint of heart; indeed, it takes deep courage. Some people may even have said that taking on this challenge is only for the foolhardy, but that time is almost past. Those of us working to provide technology classrooms throughout our campuses are no longer being thought of as foolhardy; only as somewhat over-anxious technology enthusiasts. <p>Who on campus is responsible for technology in the classroom? If you check with your computer or information services organization on campus, you may get them to admit that they are responsible for public labs, mainframe computing, and research computing. If you go to media services, they'll be able to get you a slide projector and other traditional classroom projection equipment. If you ask physical plant, they can check out the air conditioning and make sure there's no snow around. But chances are none of these organizations is actually charged with providing technology classrooms. It may be up to you to form a university-wide committee to provide direction for the move to technology in the classroom.</blockquote><hr>Page 16<br><strong>Classroom Products and Technology Infrastructure: A Buyer's Guide</strong><p>A guide to the products that support technology integration on campus.<p><strong>The Instructor</strong><br>The Instructor, by BCD Assoc., is a multimedia authoring system that runs under the Windows Object-Based Authoring interface.

The facilities, staffed with undergraduate assistants, currently house 55 Macintoshes and 21 DOS machines, and are open 60 hours per week. The project received financial support from a Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) undergraduate grant.<p><img hspace=10 align=right src="images/BYU.GIF"><strong>Brigham Young University: Humanities Tutorials</strong><br>Professor Jon D. Green, in the humanities department at Brigham Young University observed that because the students did not directly experience what they were learning, they never really retained the material, and they didn't seem to get any lasting benefit from their courses. To help address this problem, Green introduced software-based instruction into his classroom. He began to offer his students software tutorials in order to stimulate their enjoyment of the humanities curriculum. Green has designed nine tutorials to help students understand the humanities in the areas of poetry, dance, music, opera, film, drama, sculpture, painting, and architecture.<br><br clear both><img hspace=10 align=right src="images/IU.MUSIC.GIF"><strong>Indiana University, Bloomington: Multimedia Music Library</strong><br>Indiana University's School of Music will open a new multimedia library in December. Called the Variations Music Information System, the library will make all of the resources reserved for music courses available via digitized audio and full-motion video to all students and faculty on the campus. Users can access information on library resources as well as play back and edit musical scores. Currently under construction, the 55,000-square foot library will include digitized analog sound files which users will play on local workstations and over the campus network.<br><br clear=both><strong>Davidson County Community College: Nursing Education with Multimedia</strong><br>Prof. Patricia Shoemaker is using multimedia presentations to teach her nursing students at Davidson County Community College how to care for their patients. "We're trying to take a lecture format and change it into something that is more interactive," said Prof. Shoemaker. By incorporating a variety of images and sounds, she has taken the lecture beyond the traditional.<p><img hspace=10 align=right src="images/EMBRYRIDDLE.GIF"><strong>Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University: Optical Storage of Student Records</strong><br>In an effort to implement a more cost-effective method for storage and retrieval of student registration and flight data records, and to reduce the use of paper, two departments at Embry-Riddle's Daytona Beach campus and one at its Extended Campus headquarters have implemented optical storage solutions. This will replace antiquated microfiche and paper recordssystems that used to reside in an 80' x 80' room. "With the same staff, we're able to give better customer support and quicker turnaround time when records are requested. With the old paper system it would take a clerk or student assistant at least 10 minutes to retrieve a student's file," said Danette Moorhead, Manager of User Services and Information Technology.<br><br clear=both> <hr> page 34<br><strong>Introduction to Digital Video</strong><br><p>A Video Technology column debuts in this issue with an article entitled "Introduction to Digital Video." Terry Morrow and John Krasinsky of The Pennsylvania State University discuss new advances in digital video compression and transmission and examine analog versus digital video transmission for education applications. Modern compression technology can greatly reduce digital transmission bandwidth requirements, resulting in greater savings. <p><hr>page 38<br><strong>On the Internet</strong><br><p>The Internet column features Roy Tennant of the University of California at Berkeley library. In his article "Keeping Up with the Internet: Sources for Current Awareness," he provides readers with the most current resources available and tips on navigating the Internet. <p>The landscape of information resources on the Internet changes constantly. New resources appear, while others disappear or move. Keeping up with such an ever-changing environment can be difficult, but it can be done.

<strong>"Education and the Internet: The Coming Challenge to Internet Culture"</strong><br>
by Danny Goodman
<p>
Renowned technology author Danny Goodman explores how the various cultures of the Internet have changed and how this will affect education in the future. In his article Goodman explains how educators are faced with a challenge: to consider the Internet's potential to alter the nature of education in our institutions - and in so doing to keep pace with the Internet's own rapid evolution.<br>
<p>
<blockquote>There are two very different elements to the Internet. One is the infrastructure: all the computers and the high-speed networks that make it possible for our messages, information, and entertainment to go from point A to point B regardless of what may be happening on the network. The other element consists of the cultures of the Internet: the people who are contributing all the content that flows through the Internet. Some of those cultures are easily identifiable by the tools that we use, such as USENET, the World Wide Web, or FTP. Each of those in turn has its own culture, which can be broken down into various subcultures, and so on.
Most educators know the history of the Internet and appreciate the unique role higher education has played in its development. If you looked at that culture, compared to the rest of the world (which at that time was not connected to the network), the Internet culture was a kind of elite. But there is a radical change going on now in terms of access to the Internet. Now any Tom, Dick, or Harriet can phone up to NETCOM, PSInet, or some other Internet provider, as long as they have a computer and the right modem and software. That's the new group.</blockquote>

<strong>"Paying for Technology on Campus: You're Not Santa Claus"</strong><br>
by Glen McCandless<br>
<p>
This special feature suggests five areas of change in planning for technology purchases. With all of the choices and possibilities available in educational technology today, it is becoming increasingly necessary to plan for institutional technology purchases. The article discusses how higher education professional can overcome problems with the "what if" scenario. There are always new models coming soon. Also discussed is how technology purchasers must determine how and when to make a technology purchase that makes budgetary sense.<br>
<p>
<blockquote>It's simply impossible to stay ahead of the technology curve. Price/performance is going through the ceiling. The machine on our desk and in the computer lab always seems outdated...and probably is. The progression of new high tech gear is followed by a parade of students and faculty who want faster processors, more memory, bigger hard drives, and new software to go with the new system! It may be close to Christmas, but you're not Santa Claus. Buying technology takes money-a commodity that is scarce on campus. The funds are rarely available when the requests come in, and if there is some money, it's never enough. So, what's wrong with this picture?</blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote>What's wrong is the lack of a sensible approach to budgeting for technology. Fifteen years ago when requests started coming in for personal computers, most institutions leased mainframes. But instead of leasing personal computers, they chose to pay cash. For a variety of reasons, paying cash seemed logical. The number of requests was small, and the dollar amounts weren't huge. No one knew whether personal computers would have any long-term value (the mainframe people resisted the idea of decentralized computing), the shelf-life was unknown, and the extent of the personal computer's popularity was up for grabs. So, making a one-time outlay from the capital budget seemed like a good idea: shell out a few grand on a PC and move on. Merry Christmas!</blockquote>

<strong>Technology Across the Campus</strong><br>
<p>
Profiles of four institutions and their applications of technology:<br>
<p>
University of Minnesota, Crookston: ThinkPad University<br>
<p>
<blockquote>The University of Minnesota, Crookston, was the first university to implement the purchasing of notebook computers for all full-time students. According to Dr. Donald Sargeant, chancellor of the university, "The university's focus has been on the use of technology to support key organizational goals versus just promoting technology itself." The main reason for notebook computers at this university according to Dr. Sargeant was the growing need of computer literacy in the workplace and the difficulty of financing computer laboratories. In addition, there was a desire for all of the students to be afforded the same access to computer resources across the board and throughout the day, night, and weekend.</blockquote> 
<p>
The University of Georgia's College of Veterinary Medicine: Neurologic Examination of the Dog and Cat<br>
<p>
<blockquote>
<img hspace=10 align=left src="images/ugv.gif">
Dr. Greene has authored an interactive tutorial enabling students to become adept at examining and assessing neurologic findings on dogs and cats. The tutorial, entitled "Neurologic Examination of the Dog and Cat: An Interactive Videodisc Autotutorial," allows students to see spontaneously diseased animals and the neurologic deficits created by naturally occurring lesions. Students can observe movement and responses to sensory and motor stimulation which can then be recreated over and over again.</blockquote>
<blockquote>The interactive tutorial depicts movement disorders and responses of the patient to neurologic testing, reviews nervous system pathways and neurologic function, and reinforces some of the course objectives of the third-year course in small animal veterinary neurology.</blockquote>
<p>
Wayne State University: Distance Learning
<p>
<blockquote>
<img hspace=10 align=right src="images/wayne1.gif">
Wayne State University is currently incorporating Interactive Distance Learning to reach students who are full-time workers in search of increasing their education. Using "Viewer Response System" (VRS), technology provided from One Touch Systems, upper-level engineering courses have been broadcast via the College Cable network to engineers at Ford Motor Company, and throughout Southeast Michigan. The VRS provides students in the graduate studies program the ability to directly interact with their instructor from any location. Currently, the core courses of the Electronic Computer Control Systems Masters Degree are delivered to students by broadcasting courses via the College Cable network.</blockquote><br>

Mary Washington College: Internet Instruction by Example
<p>
<center>
<img hspace=10 align=center src="images/mwc.gif"><br>
</center>
<br clear=both>
<blockquote>Dr. Ernest Ackermann, a professor in the Department of Computer Science at Mary Washington College in Fredericksburg, Va., teaches classes and workshops in how to use the Internet. After reviewing all the textbooks on the market, Ackermann found many good books on using the Internet, but did not find one that stressed step-by-step examples and exercises. So, he wrote a book, Learning to Use the Internet; An Introduction with Examples and Exercises, published by Franklin, Beedle, and Associates, to support his classes.</blockquote>

<strong>Distance Learning</strong><br>
<p>
In our Distance Learning column, Dr. Robert Tucker reviews models for distance learning programs. Tucker also provides suggestions compiled from a survey of experts from institutions involved in planning distance learning programs.
<p>
<blockquote>Distance Learning, especially computer-mediated distance learning, offers enormous potential to transform the landscape of higher education to a system that is more productive, serves a wider audience, and enjoys closer ties to the workplace of the students it educates.</blockquote> 
<p>

Page 48<br>
<strong>Multimedia</strong><br>
<p>
In our Multimedia column, Teri Phalen Cassell reports on some of the most popular multimedia authoring products available today. 
<p>
<blockquote>An explosion of multimedia authoring products has entered the market, ranging from entry-level audio editors to high-level authoring packages. From an educational standpoint, the tools available have helped create a new pedagogy involving multimedia courseware development. One thing that is common among all the  products is ease of use, with little or no scripting involved. A recent phenomena for some products has been the incorporation of Web authoring into the applications, providing cross-platform functionality, as well as a means for the author to make the application available commercially.</blockquote>

<strong>Administrative Technology</strong><br>
<p>
In our Administrative Technology column, Glen McCandless investigates "smart card" technology and its potential use in higher education institutions. Smart cards can replace traditional student IDs, save processing costs, and create new revenue streams.
<p>
<blockquote>Smart cards are among the hot topics in higher education. Why? Well, simply, they have the potential to improve student services while lowering administrative computing costs-the magic formula that gets the attention of technology buyers in the college and university market who are under relentless pressure to trim their budgets. There are also revenue generating opportunities that can subsidize the costs of switching from the traditional student ID to smart cards and provide an ongoing revenue stream.</blockquote>

Today, video technology has changed the way instructors deliver their materials. Throughout the issue we uncover various uses of video technology in the curriculum. Article topics include using CD-ROM technology as a way to distribute video as well as the use of video conferencing by world-renowned musician and conductor Pinchas Zukerman as a way to deliver instruction to his students. A Buyer's Guide covers projection equipment, cameras, LCD panels, digital capture equipment, and more. Case studies include distance learning and video conferencing, as well as the use of full-motion video, and virtual reality. In addition, the January issue includes a Computer Science supplement featuring an article on the accreditation process and the components of good computer science programs as well as a computer science product guide featuring some of the latest products unveiled at Comdex '95.<BR CLEAR = ALL><BR>Some highlights and short excerpts from Syllabus follow:<HR WIDTH=100% SIZE=4 ALIGN=LEFT><P>Page 12<BR><B>"Distributing Your Video on CD-ROM"</B><BR>by Judith Stern and Robert Lettieri<P> Today, faculty are learning to prepare their video files for distribution on CD-ROM, a medium that can store huge amounts of data. Authors Judith Stern and Robert Lettieri show how video files can be stored on CD-ROM and discuss some of the issues involved in putting Apple QuickTime or Microsoft Video for Windows digital video files on CD-ROM.<MENU>There's no getting around it-digital video files can be huge! In the past, this has been a stumbling block for faculty creating movies for student or research use. Sure, the price of hard drives and removable media has dropped, but that doesn't solve the problem if you need multiple copies to distribute, whether to students, other faculty, other institutions, or potential funding sources. And while placing movies on the World Wide Web is another option, the amount of time it takes to download anything that's more than a few seconds often makes this a poor solution, at least until we have technology that allows digital video files to play without being downloaded first.In many cases, it makes sense to distribute digital video movies on CD-ROM. The advantages of using CD-ROM are that a single disc can hold over 600 megabytes of data, it is compact, and it is relatively inexpensive to produce. Most computer labs are now outfitted with computers with CD-ROM drives, so you can give or check out CDs to your students, and be assured that they can access your data. It's a pretty sure bet that just about everybody has access to a CD-ROM drive at this point.</MENU><HR WIDTH=100% SIZE=4 ALIGN=LEFT><P>Page 14<BR><B>"Breaking Down Barriers with Video Conferencing: Pinchas Zukerman Master Classes"</B><BR>by Mary Grush<P> Even with a demanding schedule of international concerts, world-renowned violinist, violist, and conductor Pinchas Zukerman is able to be on hand for weekly lessons with his private students at the Manhattan School of Music in New York, N.Y, conduct master classes in varying locations across the country and throughout the world, and offer music enrichment programs to schools in remote areas through video conferencing technology.<UL>This seemingly impossible agenda would be impossible if it weren't for the video conferencing technology that allows Mr. Zukerman to fulfill his commitments from various points around the globe. Zukerman is aided by MasterVision International, a company he founded that helps conservatories and other institutions-representing all the Arts-design and implement video conferencing programs and systems. He simply schedules a video conference and is able to conduct a private lesson or a master class in a manner that is "just as good as being there"-or better.<BR>The effectiveness of video conferencing in the realm of music is surprising. "Video conferencing applied to the Arts is new. People are more accustomed to business activities or classroom lectures conducted with the technology. It is natural for them to question whether the highly sensory nature of music-particularly something as subtle as tone production on a violin, or the rapid and sometimes minute physical movements of the fingers on the strings, or the complex motions of the bow-can be adequately represented in a video conference," says Mary Ellen Foley, president of MasterVision International. But this technology easily masters the challenge. </UL><HR WIDTH=100% SIZE=4 ALIGN=LEFT><P>Page 16<BR><B>Video and Presentation Products Buyer's Guide</B><BR><P>A guide to the products that support video in the classrooms of college and university campuses.<P><B>The Educator </B><BR>The Educator is an active-matrix LCD projection panel with annotation capabilities allowing users to write over any projected data or video image.

Optimizing Color Graphics for the Web
<p>
Patrick J. Lynch
<p>
In the last issue, Patrick Lynch examined Web graphics and provided an overview of the most common file formats used on the Web. In this article, he explains how Web viewers interpret color files and how to optimize the look and performance of color graphics for your Web pages. 
<P>

Color graphics are rapidly becoming one of the defining characteristics of online publishing. Unlike the high cost and complexity of four-color printing on paper, with electronic documents there is no need to economize by avoiding color content. There are some potential performance drawbacks to stuffing your Web pages full of big, bright images, but with proper planning you can optimize the graphics in your Web pages for faster downloading and accurate color reproduction on your readers' screens.

Networked Multimedia: Not Quite Ready for Prime Time
<P>

by Glen McCandless
<P>

Glen McCandless takes a look at networked multimedia and considers the technology that institutions will need in order to effectively provide access to multimedia resources over a network. 
<P>


<MENU>
Talk of diskless workstations and the Internet becoming "the great file server in the sky" makes for good party conversation. After all, wouldn't it be great to buy an inexpensive desktop unit that would tap us into every kind of information or entertainment we could ever want or need? How about paying for our computing needs as we do for a long distance telephone call? In that world, the idea of "any topic, anytime, anyplace," learning would come closer to reality. Already, we have been caught up like insects in the  Web, but is networked interactive multimedia really usable today?

The Best Tools for Searching the Internet
<P>

by Roy Tennant
<P>

In this article, Roy Tennant examines the problems of searching for information on the Internet and reviews some of the important sites that offer good search tools. 
<P>

<MENU>
Even just a couple of years ago it was difficult to find information on the Internet, and a good deal of patience and persistence was required. Then, when you got it, it was plain text-no graphics, sounds, or moving images. The World Wide Web has changed all that, and the advent of the Web has also changed the landscape of Internet information access.

Statisticians and mathematicians can find of wealth of information related to their fields of study on the Internet's World Wide Web. On the Web, makers of mathematics and statistics software offer information on their products and offer users the opportunity to obtain new software releases, download demonstrations of programs, learn about how others have used the products, receive tips and get answers to FAQs.  Mathematicians and statisticians also can find user groups, get technical support, engage in online discussions, and find extensive links to institutions and people in the field.

The process is often referred to as "visual thinking" and is firmly rooted in basic principles of cognitive psychology and visual information processing.<BR><P>In order to create an accurate mental image of some multidimensional concept or process, some form of input is needed with which to create the "vision." If the input is highly symbolic or codified, a bottleneck forms in the information processing path because our preconscious must translate the input into some understandable form before it can be used by our conscious mind.

During the 1950s and 1960s, the emphasis was on training candidates for school counseling positions. Now many additional areas of have emerged, ranging from addiction studies to pastoral counseling. The school uses video technology as a means to train counselors in all of these diverse areas.<BR>Prior to using video technology, students in training had to depend on tape recordings as a means to perfect their verbal skills. The audio tapes provided feedback on content and tone of voice, but of course lacked the important visual elements such as body language, eye contact, and overall presentation. But by the mid-1960s, videotaping was initiated and all but took the place of one-way mirrors. The practice of hooking up a video camera to a monitor in another room enabled viewing without interaction and class observation. Now the level of communication is completely interactive, and students can view, hear, ask questions when appropriate, and tape sessions for further analysis.</MENU> <P><HR WIDTH=100% SIZE=4 ALIGN=LEFT><P>Page 34<BR><B>On the Internet </B>by Teri Cassell<BR><P>This section covers chemistry web sites and what they offer to educators.<P>Chemistry students can now take advantage of the WWW to download modeling software, watch 3D models of molecules rotate, and build their own models.

Experience in the laboratory and learning the codification of "what works" formed the greater part of engineering education. That experience served the graduates and the industries they staffed very well. Then, in the wake of the crucial role of scientific developments during World War II, theoretical understanding became far more important. Emphasis shifted to mathematics and the lessons to be learned from the basic sciences. The importance of laboratory experience, industrial practice, and design synthesis waned. For the last forty years, engineering educators have sharpened their student's analytical skills and theoretical understanding. Now a second major paradigm shift has begun.</MENU><P><hr><a HREF="index.html"><H3>Back to SyllabusWeb Home Page</H3></a><hr><address>Copyright &copy; 1996 by Syllabus Press, Inc.

Mathematics software and quantitative tools are enhancing all levels of graduate and undergraduate instruction within college and university classrooms. Diverse disciplines such as engineering, business, physics, economics, and social sciences are now using software to enhance the delivery of instruction. New tools are providing students with ways to visualize and comprehend difficult concepts. Time-consuming statistical analysis that once took not only hours, but mounds of paperwork has been streamlined with software. In the past, students merely looked at the data prepared on paper by the instructor. Now students can instantly develop their own charts and graphs. Throughout the issue, we focus on all of the aspects of mathematics and quantitative tools in the curriculum and illustrate the benefits such tools are offering today's students and instructors.. <BR><BR CLEAR = ALL><BR>Some highlights and short excerpts from Syllabus follow:<p><HR WIDTH=100% SIZE=4 ALIGN=LEFT><P>Page 10<BR><B>"Mathematics and Quantitative Tools in the Classroom-Making the Abstract Concrete"</B><BR><P>In this feature article, Levi Thomas explores how mathematics software and quantitative tools are being used in higher education to provide students with a deeper understanding of concepts. <P><MENU>Mathematics is man's attempt to create a language capable of describing fundamental relationships and reality itself in a way that is precise, clear, and constant in its meaning. Unfortunately, understanding the individual words that make up this language does not guarantee comprehension of what is actually being said.<BR>When learning mathematics, it is not enough simply to memorize the formulas and solve for the dependent variables, rather one must also understand the basic concepts and relationships of mathematics, and how they relate to the real world.<BR>The difficulty in achieving this level of understanding stems from the fact that the language of mathematics is necessarily highly symbolic, often baroque in form and abstract in meaning, sometimes relating only to itself. Frequently, mathematics students can find nothing familiar upon which to "hang" the new information presented to them. Indeed, math can seem to occupy a world wholly unto itself.<BR>Consequently, many students are left with little choice but to bootstrap themselves up the steep learning curve with little idea as to how the equations and functions they are learning relate to each other, to other concepts in mathematics, or to the world around them. <BR></MENU><P><HR WIDTH=100% SIZE=4 ALIGN=LEFT><P>Page 14<BR><B>"Using Computational Systems for Undergraduate Mathematics"</B><BR><P>In this feature, Dr. Lila Roberts from Georgia Southern University discusses both the advantages and concerns of using software to teach undergraduate or introductory-level courses.<P><IMG SRC="images/feat2.gif"  VSPACE=10 HSPACE=10 ALIGN=right>An obvious way that technology provides enhancement over traditional mathematics instruction is in computation. In courses such as calculus, many topics involve intense symbolic calculations. Other areas, such as linear algebra, entail repetitive arithmetic. For students who are prone to errors, a haze of algebraic and arithmetic manipulations often obscure fundamental ideas. Quantitative tools can eliminate the need for rote calculations, allowing instructors and students to focus on basic concepts. Before technical software became widely available, many realistic applied problems were inaccessible because of complicated numeric and symbolic computations. It is now possible to expose students to more meaningful applications. <BR>Perhaps the most exciting aspect of technology reform in undergraduate mathematics is in the area of visualization. For some students, a well-chosen picture has much more meaning than an algebraic definition or a set of numeric data. Using the graphics capabilities of software tools, instructors may exploit the highly geometric nature of many areas of mathematics.<BR><P><HR WIDTH=100% SIZE=4 ALIGN=LEFT><P>Page 18<BR><B>"Mathematics and Quantitative Tools Buyer's Guide"</B><P>This month's Buyer's Guide features the latest software for mathematics and statistics.

The program grew out of a need for health care professionals to develop a business sense and to be able to use statistics to analyze and accommodate future trends affecting the health care field. In the past, health care professionals simply needed a medical degree to succeed in their chosen field. But Dr. Carlton Scott, a professor at the Graduate School of Management at U.C. Irvine, observes that the times have changed for health care professionals.<P><B>North Carolina State University</B><BR>Cyberspace Study Aid for Materials ScienceBeginning students in materials science at North Carolina State University's engineering department are using an interactive Web site as a virtual laboratory to help them visualize concepts. The project is the brainchild of Dr. John Russ, a visiting professor and research associate in materials science and engineering, and grew out of his belief that students need a more visual approach to understanding difficult scientific concepts. In the past, students had to rely on their imaginations to visualize a 3D molecule from a 2D textbook rendition or chalkboard display. But Dr. Russ says that better alternatives are available in the computer age.<P><HR WIDTH=100% SIZE=4 ALIGN=LEFT><P>Page 28<BR><P><B>On The Internet</B><BR>Mathematics Resources on the World Wide Web<P><P>Students and teachers of mathematics can take advantage of the resources found in hundreds of Web sites that cover the discipline. Brian Smith suggests strategies for searching the Web for mathematics resources, listing a few good sites to use as starting points. <P><MENU>A mathematician involved in teaching and research should consider the Internet in general, and the World Wide Web in particular, to be an essential resource for professional activities. Discussion groups (listservs) provide a vehicle for an ongoing exchange of information and active dialog with colleagues, ftp sites permit storage and retrieval of documents, and gophers provide access to repositories of information at universities and organizations. All of these are valuable aids for the working mathematician. But the World Wide Web is an incomparable delight-a playground of thoughts and ideas, colors and concepts, numbers and symbols. Mathematics teachers entering this world for the first time react like children delighted with a new toy, and those who get their students involved report that they, too, quickly become enamored with the Web.</MENU><P><hr><a HREF="index.html"><H3>Back to SyllabusWeb Home Page</H3></a><hr><address>Copyright &copy; 1996 by Syllabus Press, Inc.

As multimedia is providing exciting new ways to present information, educators are looking for the most effective ways to distribute and share these educational resources. Our feature article looks at how educators can use PDF files to share formatted information and multimedia resources, regardless of platform and without the need to distribute copies of the original software. The Buyer's Guide features multimedia authoring tools and multimedia hardware. The case studies section covers six institutions and their uses of technology. In addition, four columns cover different key technology areas in education. On the Internet examines several digital library projects. In Quantitative Tools, the focus is on how pedagogical design and organizational issues factored into the development of computerized calculus courses at the University of Illinois. The Administrative Technology column focuses on developing services on institutional servers. And our Video Technology column presents multimedia  projectors and visual presenters for multimedia presentation. Our special Science and Medicine section features the topic of telemedicine as well as a Product Guide with a focus on science and medicine products for the curriculum.<BR><BR CLEAR = ALL><BR>Some highlights and short excerpts from Syllabus follow:<p><HR WIDTH=100% SIZE=4 ALIGN=LEFT><P>Page 14<BR><B>"Cross-Platform Multimedia Access for Education: Using PDF Files"</B><BR>by Patrick Lynch<BR><P>Patrick Lynch, Director of Yale's Center for Advanced Instructional Media, explores the use of PDF files for formatted files and multimedia.<P><MENU>Back at the dawn of modern graphic interfaces in the 1970s the computer scientists at Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center (PARC) set out to make the operation of computer systems a routine part of business and academic life. From that seminal research and innovation we got the first implementations of two things we take for granted today: the mouse pointer, and the graphical user interface. But we got something else from the PARC Alto and Star research computers-the first operating system that attempted to make onscreen documents look just like their physical counterparts. Back in the days when the norm for computing was a low-resolution black screen with fuzzy green letters, the Xerox computers caused nearly instantaneous paradigm shifts in anyone who saw them. Imitating the look of conventional printed documents was much more than just a brilliant interface innovation-it also made it immediately obvious that computers were not just another tool, and that they could evolve into the most powerful communications medium yet devised.</MENU><P><HR WIDTH=100% SIZE=4 ALIGN=LEFT><P>Page 20<BR><B>Multimedia Buyer's Guide</B><BR><P>A guide to the products educators can use to create multimedia courseware.<BR><P><B>The Digital Chisel</B><BR><MENU>The Digital Chisel uses a slide metaphor and is menu-driven with drag-and-drop functionality.

Eye Surgery Simulator is a device incorporating virtual reality to simulate the look and feel of eye surgery. According to Director Mike Sinclair, "With the Eye Surgery Simulator, students can practice an operation, such as cataract removal or lens replacement, many times a day; whereas, before students could practice such surgery only a few times a week."<BR>Another project underway is The Dance Technology Project, a collaboration among IMTC, Georgia Tech Theater, and the Atlanta Ballet. Research is underway to develop new and innovative ways to integrate technology and the arts, specifically dance. The project's premier performance entitled "Non Sequitur" featured a ballerina performing a dance with an animated virtual dancer. <BG><BR CLEAR = ALL><BG><BR><IMG SRC="images/csohio.gif"  HSPACE=10 ALIGN=right><B>Ohio State University</B><BR><P>At Ohio State University faculty are developing multimedia applications to help students learn difficult engineering and architectural concepts. <BR>Professor Brooks Breeden from the department of architecture developed MacLARCH for Macintosh and WinLARCH for Windows using Macromedia's Authorware Professional. The courseware modules were designed to help students learn how to solve construction problems in civil engineering and landscape architecture. The application illustrates topics such as road alignment, property traverse surveying, and earthwork cut and fill. Each subject features an interactive presentation with color animation and diagrams, followed by sets of questions about the topic. Short QuickTime movies are used to animate elements such as contour definition. The content is presented in several different formats. <BG><BR CLEAR = ALL><P><B>Rensselaer Polytechnic</B><BR><P>Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute offers a studio calculus course, which focuses on students actually doing calculus instead of just listening to an instructor in a traditional lecture setting. <P>Studio Calculus<BR>At Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute many courses are taught in a studio environment with computers and interactive software. Learning is facilitated by collaboration and interaction among students and instructors.<BR>A course called Workshop Calculus is based on the premise that students learn more by doing and talking about calculus than by listening and watching. Joseph Ecker, a professor in the department of mathematics, previously taught calculus only in a traditional lecture, lab, and recitation format. It became evident to him that most of the learning was going on in the computer lab setting, so Ecker asked, "Why not extend this mode of learning to all aspects of this course?"<P><B>Wellesley College</B><BR><P>Wellesley College's online collaborative writing course is giving students a new way to explore writing.<P>Online Writing Program<BR>Wellesley College, a liberal arts college for women, offers a writing class in which students collaborate on a network of Macintosh computers. Wellesley's writing program uses networked classrooms to hold discussions in which everyone is "speaking" at once, all the time-except that the conversations are being held in writing on computers linked by the Daedalus Integrated Writing Environment. <P><B>California Polytechnic State University</B><BR><P>The MultiMedia Research Project has provided a venue for several innovative projects developed by students<BR>The MultiMedia Research Project (MMRP) is a student-organized project at California Polytechnic State University in San Luis Obispo. The Project, which has been on-going for the past six years, grew out of students' needs to bridge the gap between themselves and industry. A number of multimedia projects has emerged under the umbrella of MMRP. Students working on special multimedia projects relating to college course work now have access to a centralized lab, well-stocked with the latest equipment either donated or loaned from various corporate sponsors such as Gerber, NEC, Radius, Epson, Mitsubishi, and PowerComputing among others.<BR>Currently, the MMRP is pursuing three projects. One of them is the 3Dinitiative Project, which will demonstrate virtual applications with spatial sound and 3D approaches. By incorporating sight and sound, the viewer will participate in an immersive and realistic 3D experience via a head mounted display (HMD) with head tracking, a three-space input device and real-time 3D sound.<P><B>Salve Regina University</B><BR><P>New Multimedia Lab Leads to Diverse Projects<P>Salve Regina University, located on Aquidneck Island in Newport, R.I., recently implemented a Multimedia Production Area. Complete with state-of-the art equipment, faculty and students have used the facility for classroom projects and to create interactive courseware.<BR>The area has helped many undergraduate and graduate students prepare in-class multimedia presentations. These can be as simple as scanning pictures onto a CD-ROM for playback later or as complex as the projects worked on by Professor Robert Kulo's communication class.<P><HR WIDTH=100% SIZE=4 ALIGN=LEFT><P>Page 37<BR><B>On The Internet </B><BR>"Libraries Share Their Resources-Digitized Holdings on the Net"<BR><P>One of the obvious benefits of the Internet is the ability to share digital resources widely. Large libraries with vast collections, or small libraries consisting of rare, specialized materials can offer economical access to their digitized holdings.<BR>Internet connectivity rates for educational institutions are impressive-two thousand elementary and secondary education Web servers in the U.S., two million educational hosts, and a logarithmic growth rate evidenced by half of all new connections having been established in 1995. Soon, reporting such facts will be obviated by the reality of universal accessibility of Internet-based services. In anticipation of the Internet's metamorphosis from a phenomenon to a pedestrian communication medium, how can administrators leverage it to forward their institutional missions? Placing critical, interactive services on the school-based server is now a viable strategy.<P><HR WIDTH=100% SIZE=4 ALIGN=LEFT><P>Page 40<BR><B>Quantitative Tools </B><BR>"Teaching Calculus by Computer"<BR><P>By the time personal computers became widely available on campus in the late 1980s, professors at the department of mathematics at the University of Illinois had already identified a new way to teach calculus: interactively via a computer software system. Here, Jerry Uhl relates how faculty developers from the U. of I. and Ohio State quickly bridged the gap between the computer and the chalkboard with the first interactive course for calculus.<BR>Back in 1988 two calculus professors from the University of Illinois, Horacio Porta and I, had a meeting with U. of I. graduate and mathematical genius Steven Wolfram, who had recently created the first publicly available version of the Mathematica software. We talked about the idea of a calculus course in the form of an interactive text on the computer. We walked away thinking that the idea was good and started to write just such a course. Bill Davis, of Ohio State University, also saw the potential for teaching calculus by computer and joined us in designing a course. This was the early formation of what would later become the Calculus & Mathematica development teams at the U. of I. and Ohio State.<P><HR WIDTH=100% SIZE=4 ALIGN=LEFT><P>Page 43<BR><B>Administrative Technology</B><BR>"Beyond Self-Service: Institutional Servers"<BR><P>Colleges and universities have increased visability on the Internet, and administrators must plan interactive services on institutional servers. <BR>Internet connectivity rates for educational institutions are impressive-two thousand elementary and secondary education Web servers in the U.S., two million educational hosts, and a logarithmic growth rate evidenced by half of all new connections having been established in 1995. Soon, reporting such facts will be obviated by the reality of universal accessibility of Internet-based services.

One extraordinary application is telemedicine, a technology now in use for the dual purposes of medical practice and continuing medical education and training. Telemedicine combines information processing and telecommunications technologies to transfer medical information across distances for diagnosis, treatment, and other purposes. This technology, with its capability to transfer data in the form of text, images, and sounds-over distances and between multiple interactive sites-offers part of a solution to the problem of maldistribution of health care resources and provides new avenues for the continuing education of health care providers.<BR>Perhaps one of the best examples of a large-scale telemedicine system can be found in the Georgia Statewide Academic and Medical System (GSAMS), a comprehensive distance learning and health care network which provides services and continuing education throughout the state of Georgia. To support this extensive system, one of the largest in the world, the Georgia Department of Administrative Services (DOAS) operates a communications network that can access cable systems, microwave systems, and satellite dishes.<P><HR WIDTH=100% SIZE=4 ALIGN=LEFT><P>Page 53<BR>Guide to Technologies for Science and Medicine Products<BR><P><IMG SRC="images/pgvisual.gif"  HSPACE=10 ALIGN=right><B>BT Visual Images VC2000</B><BR>The BT Visual Images VC2000 Medical Video Conferencing system was specifically created to address the needs of the medical field.

<B>Managing Courses on the World Wide Web</b><br>
Workshop leader: <A HREF="pitt96_faculty.htm#5">Alistair Fraser</A>, The Pennsylvania State University<br>
The Web is beginning to produce a profound change in the manner in which educational resources are delivered into the classroom (for presentation) and the dormitory or home (for exploration). This workshop emphasizes two aspects of this: a classroom interface, and pedagogical animation. The classroom interface uses frames and Javascript to facilitate the use of a browser for structuring and presenting course material. Animation enables one to create better visualizations to facilitate the communication of concepts. The workshop presupposes skills in HTML and experience with creating a basic Web site.

<a name="t7"</a>
<B>Multimedia Authoring for Windows-ToolBook</B><br>
Workshop leader: <A HREF="pitt96_faculty.htm#4">Tom Hall</A>, Pitt Community College<br>
This workshop shows how Multimedia ToolBook can be used to create a variety of interactive multimedia applications. Participants learn some of the basics of ToolBook, including how to add multimedia components such as images, animation, and digital video. Included is how to use the Book Specialist to build a Generic Content book and a Generic Quiz book, as well as how to use the widgets found in the CBT Edition to quickly build an interactive quiz that keeps score and provides feedback.

<B>Multimedia Authoring for the Macintosh</B><br>
Workshop leader: <A HREF="pitt96_faculty.htm#1">Diana Bajzek</A>, Carnegie Mellon University<br>
A hands-on workshop for those who have some familiarity with multimedia technology (builds on the skills learned in Saturday's session on multimedia tools). Primary focus is on structuring multimedia data, designing end-user navigational controls, and providing interactivity using Lingo scripts. Participants work toward completion of a hands-on project in class. Applications used include: Macromedia Director and Extreme 3D. Other topics include the use of 3D modeling applications.

The trip to or from the Airport takes approximately 45 minutes.

<html><title>News, Resources, and Trends</title><body><center><font size="6">News, Resources</font></center><center><font size="6">and Trends</font></center><p><center>November/December '95</center><hr><p><strong>Colleges Target Computer Literacy</strong><br>According to a report from the American Association of State Colleges and Universities, more than two-thirds of the 230 institutions surveyed revealed that schools either have or are considering computer-competency requirements for students. In addition, nearly half of the institutions reported that they plan to acquire Internet access within the next three years. For more information call (202) 293-7070.<p><strong>On-Line Support Network Launched for School Technology Coordinators</strong><br>Scantron Quality Computers recently launched the National Technology Coordinators Network (NTCN), touted as the first support and research network dedicated to the needs of technology coordinators in schools. Network members can download software applications and online files including grant writing tips and other information collected from several Internet locations. Scantron is currently offering a free one-year NTCN account. For more information call (800) 777-3642.<p><strong>More Libraries Are Providing Internet Access</strong><br>A new study conducted by the American Library Association (ALA), reveals that nearly 90 percent of libraries serving 100,000 or more people have an online public catalog (OPAC), and nearly 70 percent have the capability to provide users with access from their homes or businesses via modem. Besides Internet access, more than 90 percent have CD-ROMs for public use. The survey was conducted as a part of the ALA's Public Library Data Service's "Statistical Report '95."<p><strong>CAUSE Professional Paper Series</strong><br>CAUSE has released #13 of its Professional Paper Series entitled Organizational and Technological Strategies for Higher Education in the Information Age. Authored by David J. Ernst, Richard N. Katz, and John R. Sack, the paper examines five key trends impacting higher education administration.

<B>Group Calls For Radical Change in High School Science Education</B><BR>

<MENU>
A group of scientists, teachers, and educators throughout the country has called for a revolutionary change in the way American high schools teach science. The American Renaissance in Science Education (ARISE) group, which has Nobel Prize-winning physicist Leon M. Lederman as co-chairman, said it believes that the traditional order of subjects--biology, chemistry, and physics--should be reversed and should include strong links to other disciplines. ARISE group members expect opposition because it would call for a drastic reform requiring new content, new teaching materials, new assessment tools, and new laboratory experiments. If adopted, the revision would be the first since 1893, when a nationally appointed committee established the present science sequence for the nation's high schools.

Faculty Use of Technology Continues to Increase, but at Slower Pace
Based on data provided by computing officials at 660 two-and-four year colleges and universities in the U.S., the annual 1996 Campus Computing Survey was released indicating that technology has become  ubiquitous on campuses, but that its rate of increase has slowed. <BR>
<P>
<B>IT in the Classroom
</B> The two most important information technology issues that will confront colleges and universities over the next three years will be instructional integration and user support. Just over one-fourth (27.3 percent) of the 660 respondents to the survey indicated that assisting faculty with the integration of technology into instruction as the single most important information technology issue at their institution. <BR>

Another significant finding is that growing numbers of colleges are opting for user fees as a way to manage the costs of upgrading technology. This year almost a third of all campuses (31.8 percent) require a student technology fee, up from 26.9 percent in 1995. This number, however, masks significant differences. Public research universities and public four-year colleges report mandatory technology fees, while private institutions tend to prefer to incorporate technology charges into tuition. <BR>

The survey showed modest gains in the proportion of college courses using various kinds of information technology resources. The percentage of college classes using e-mail grew from 20.1 to 25 percent of classes and presentation handouts rose to 28.4 percent, up from 25.7 percent last year. Currently, 9 percent of all courses use WWW-based resources to support instruction. The use of commercial courseware was almost unchanged from last year at 18.5 percent. <BR>
<P>
<B>The Internet and the WWW in the Classroom</B>
The 1996 survey revealed that two-thirds (67 percent) of all undergraduates have access to e-mail and the Internet, up from 60 percent last year. However, there was no change for faculty Internet access with just over three-fourths (76.5 percent) having access. The role of the Internet and the WWW continues to expand on campus with an increase of 55.2 percent from last year. Almost a third of the campuses participating in the survey reported a formal campus plan for the use of the Internet and the WWW in instruction (30.1 percent). Copies of the report are available for $35 from Kenneth Green c/o Campus Computing, PO Box 261242, Encino, CA 91426-1242.

<LI>
A new white paper entitled "Academic Productivity: The Case for Instructional Software," is based on a recently held meeting with 14 experts from higher education, industry, and government that explored the impact instructional software might have on productivity in higher education. The paper presents five propositions: 1) Instructional software is essential if we are to solve the productivity problem; 2) Targeting areas of high student demand will have the greatest likelihood of success; 3) Colleges and universities cannot create requisite software on their own; 4) What is needed, in the words of author and futurist Lewis Perelman, is "self-sustained commercialization;" and 5) Market success depends on instructional software that is disaggregated, disintermediated, differentiated, and diffuse.

<b>Volume 8, No. 4</b><br>
<b>Video Technologies on Campus</b>
<p>
<img hspace=10 src="images/jansylcvr.gif" align=left>
<p>
In this issue of <i>Syllabus</i> magazine, we focus on the wide array of video
technologies which are expanding the range of possibilities for the delivery of
instruction and the enhanced presentation of lectures. Video technologies,
which have been central in the development of distance learning and multimedia,
will help to change how, where, and when we learn, and are likely to transform
education in the process.

<strong>Digital Video for Educators</strong><br>
by Judith L. Stern, University of California at Berkeley
<dd>
Contributed by Judy Stern, author of several books on QuickTime and a
multimedia developer in the Instructional Technology Program at the University
of California at Berkeley. This article examines how digital video is being
used in instruction. Digital video is coming out of its infancy, and its
delivery to computer screens is becoming easier. With bigger window sizes and
faster frame rates, it won't be long before this technology is used extensively
in education and we'll forget the early "postage-stamp"-sized windows and jerky
images first associated with digital video.
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>Page 14<br>
<strong>Video Buyer's Guide</strong>
<dd>
Video technologies are being used to enhance the delivery of instruction. With
the recent improvements in digital video and the trend towards multimedia, it
is certain that video will continue to play an important role in education.
This guide presents the latest video products available, including video
cameras and recorders, projectors, and LCD panels.

University, where computer science students attend class in a state-of-the-art
electronic classroom; California Polytechnic State University, where an
"virtual university" is employing real-time, two-way interactive video and
multimedia to offer students education on demand; and the State of Georgia,
where video conferencing is being used over a statewide academic and medical
network.

<strong>Multimedia</strong><br>
<strong>Low-Rent Virtual Reality, 3-D, and Multimedia</strong><br>
by Patrick J. Lynch, Yale University
<dd>
Patrick Lynch explains how new development tools for multimedia are allowing
educators to add realistic multimedia simulations to their courseware. Tools
such as Strata StudioPro, and available 3-D graphics including those from
ViewPoint 3-D Datasets, are making it easier than ever for instructors to
produce 3-D multimedia.

<b>Desktop Technologies</b><br>
<img align=right hspace=10 src="images/febsylcvr.gif">
<p>
In this issue of <i>Syllabus</i> magazine, we present our annual review of
desktop technologies. During the past year, greater power has come to the
desktop in the form of new microprocessors: the PowerPC and the Pentium. The
high performance of these processors enables applications like advanced
multimedia, high-speed graphics and visualization, and collaborative computing
to run more readily on relatively inexpensive desktop computers. New desktop
models based on the PowerPC, the Pentium, and other powerful microprocessors
are providing opportunities for educators to work with leading-edge technology

<b>Mathematics and Quantitative Tools in Education</b><br>
<img align=right hspace=10 src="images/aprlcovr.gif">
<p>
In this issue of Syllabus we cover a wide array of software products for
mathematics as well as quantitative tools useful in education. Quantitative
tools are being used in diverse disciplines, from mathematics, to business and
economics, to the social sciences, physics, engineering, and others. These
software tools offer many advantages over more traditional media in
instruction. They eliminate many tedious and error-prone calculations, allowing
students to concentrate on concepts rather than on methods and formulas. The
graphics capabilities that many of these products possess allow students to
visualize concepts more easily. And, when computers are used in instruction,
students spend less time doing lengthy calculations by hand and have more time
to experiment with concepts and run extra examples.<p>

Lynch<p>Reviews by Patrick Lynch of five tools educators can use to author effective multimedia presentations without having to learn a complex scripting language. Action! from Macromedia, Astound by Gold Disk, Pierian Springs Digital Chisel, mPOWER from Multimedia Design Corp., and Special Delivery by Interactive Media Corp. are reviewed:<blockquote>Most educators have read about or seen interactive multimedia programs and presentations, but have little inclination to spend the months of training and development time required to use mainstream multimedia authoring tools like Director, Authorware, SuperCard, or ToolBook. These "heavy-duty" multimedia programs all stress media integration and complex user interaction, where you can tightly integrate text, graphics, animation, sound, and digital video clips within a presentation. These are the professional tools most commonly used to create today's generation of multimedia CD-ROM titles. But these high-end authoring packages require you to learn a scripting language to control even the most basic aspects of presentations, even though most presentations do not require complex or unusual user interactions. The majority of multimedia educational presentations and interactive lecture audiovisuals can be put together using a basic set of navigation and media control functions.<p><img align=left hspace=10 src="images/astound.gif">It is this need for entry-level multimedia authoring tools that this group of five programs is designed to address. Each of these programs meets the challenges of creating multimedia presentations in different ways. <br clear=both><p>All five are based on the familiar slide-show metaphor now used by most presentation software, but also allow you to add simple interactive controls and audiovisual media to create true interactive multimedia programs. This review isn't your typical "shoot-out" over who makes the best entry-level multimedia tool, as each program chosen for review here is designed to meet a very particular audience need. All are designed to create integrated, interactive educational programs and presentations without the need for scripting, but each also brings a unique set of capabilities and design strengths. The range of specialized and diversified software now available to entry-level multimedia authors reflects the maturation of the software marketplace, and a recognition that educators' needs are not always similar to those of multimedia professionals or of the mainstream business presentation market.</blockquote><hr>Page 20<br><strong>Photo CD:  Digital Photography Anyone Can Use</strong><br>by Patrick J. Lynch<p>Photo CD is another tool that can help educators develop visual resources for their multimedia projects. Patrick Lynch explores Photo CD technology and explains how stock photography collections on stored on Photo CD are offering affordable images for multimedia developers: <p><blockquote>Most people who bought a CD-ROM drive with their computers have at least heard the term Photo CD, because most CD-ROM drives sold in the last two years used Photo CD compatibility as a selling point, and many drives are bundled with at least one demonstration Photo CD. <p>More than a decade ago Kodak realized that the world of photography was eventually going to be dominated by digital technology, and Photo CD is Kodak's answer to the problems of transferring silver-based photographs (that is, almost any conventional photograph, negative, or color slide) into the digital realm. In Photo CD, Kodak has developed an extremely useful and well thought-out technology that any computer user can use to capture photographs for use on the computer screen.<p>The flexibility and strength of Photo CD technology lies mostly in its special ImagePac file format, which stores each image in five different resolutions. The fact that each image on a Photo CD is actually stored in five different resolutions within the file is what makes the format so versatile and easy to use, because you only need to access the resolution that meets your current needs. To fully appreciate what a clever file scheme this is, think about what it would be like to work with digital photographs stored only at their maximum resolution: even if you only needed a little postage stamp-sized picture to use as a button icon you would still need to open and decompress a monster 18 megabyte file, then resize and crop the image. Most potential users don't have enough RAM in their computers to do this easily if at all, and hardly anyone would want to go through this long and tedious process routinely. With Photo CD, you only access the resolution adequate for your current needs.<p>Photo CD is not just an attractive and convenient means of digitizing your photographs without having to buy a slide scanner -- the availability of Photo CD as a cross-platform means of distributing photographs has created new markets for stock photography. Thanks to Photo CD technology you can acquire royalty-free professional high-quality photographs in hundreds of categories that are often priced at just pennies per picture. Academic authors of multimedia or conventional books may find these new digital photographic collections to be an extremely useful and economical visual resource for teaching and publication.</blockquote><p><hr><p>Page 28<br><strong>Multimedia Buyer's Guide</strong><p>A guide to hardware and software of interest to educators who are using multimedia to teach, and tools for those who are developing multimedia for the classroom and lab:<dl><dt><strong>Elmo TSN-270S</strong><dd>Elmo Mfg.

The most striking aspects of the chart are the relatively small differences among administrative and library applications. All applications appear to share a relatively similar status for both the current and the projected rate of client/server adoption. Only financial aid, with 19 percent currently on client/server, is slightly ahead of all others. Looking ahead to the end of 1995, we should expect to see an approximate 50 percent application migration -- across all administrative and library functions -- to client/server.</blockquote><br clear=both><hr>Page 38<br><strong>On the Internet</strong><br><strong>Out of the Rubble of Old Infrastructures</strong><br>by Danny Goodman<p>An excerpt from Danny Goodman's book, <i>Living at Light Speed</i>, takes a look at how new communications technologies are changing our libraries, schools, and other systems:<p><blockquote>Within only the past few years, we have seen electronic journalism transform our expectations of instant worldwide access to historic events. Not only do we get a verbal account of the bombing of Baghdad, but a live television camera sticking out of the window of the Al Rashid Hotel shows glowing trails of antiaircraft rounds spraying into the night sky. From our comfy sofas we watch with utter disbelief as a brave young man stands before an oncoming tank on its way to help quash the Tiananmen Square demonstration. ... This kind of instant access meshes well with modern society's culture of more, bigger, better, and faster. ... The technologies and content of the information superhighway will be as much at the core of modern society as the telephone, radio, and television. ... If the highway engineers build it, the content providers will come.<p></blockquote><HR><A HREF="index.html"><H3>Back to SyllabusWeb Home Page</H3></a><hr><address>Copyright &copy; 1995 by Syllabus Press, Inc.

In this issue of <i>Syllabus</i>, we focus on telecommunications and networking. Telecommunications and networking technology is allowing students and faculty to communicate in new ways and at new times. Physical distance is becoming less important as connectivity improves. Institutions are now able to share resources with distant campuses and improve the educational environment exponentially at relatively little cost.

We are seeing implementations of the "virtual classroom," the "virtual library," and the "virtual office" on many campuses today. Distance learning programs can indeed now create a "virtual campus" for those in remote locations. With instructors holding electronic office hours over the campus network and students in different colleges going to class together electronically via video conferencing, we can see that telecommunications and networking technologies are making important changes in the way education institutions work.

<strong>Telco Projects for Education</strong><br>
by Teri Cassell
<p>
Regional Bell Companies and competitive access providers are promoting projects that improve telecommunications in education. Teri Cassell has surveyed these companies to find examples of the types of projects, supported in part by the telcos, currently underway in high schools and colleges:
<p>

<blockquote>Over the past decade, educators have been searching for new and innovative approaches to education in order to reach increasingly large numbers of students in spite of limited and shrinking resources. Technology has helped--the traditional classroom, once an insular location, can now expand beyond the confines of four walls using telecommunications and networking technologies. These technologies allow students and teachers to communicate in new ways and enable institutions to share resources.
<p>
Current applications of telecommunications and networking technologies are offering more realistic and instant interactions among users in real time. Two-way video conferencing allows instructors and students at distant locations to work together on a common project. Instructors and students can share documents and information electronically as well as collaborate on creating and editing reports and research papers. Students have expanded access to qualified teachers and learning resources--whether they are across the campus or miles away at another location.
<p>
Helping to blaze a trail in the educational implementation of telecommunications and networking technologies are long distance and local telecommunication providers. The seven regional Bell companies as well as competitive access providers such as AT&T and others have funded and promoted projects within educational institutions. Using technologies offered through these projects, students are experiencing the luxury of expanded educational resources.</blockquote>

<strong>Technology Across the Campus</strong>
<p>
Profiles of four institutions and their applications of technology:
<p>
Duke University School of Engineering: Infrared Networking in the Classroom
An infrared network has changed the dynamics of a programming and numerical methods class. Each student in the class receives one COOPERATIVE Transceiver, a wireless AppleTalk link about the size of a computer mouse from Photonics Corp. of San Jose, Calif. To establish a network connection, all the students have to do is to plug their transceivers into the printer ports of their PowerBooks and point them at the ceiling.
<p>
<img hspace=10 align=left src="images/jupiter.gif">
University of Tennessee: Neural Computational Systems Refine Telescope Images Researchers in neural computational systems are studying the applications of simulated neural networks to real physics problems. FORTRAN programs, used in conjunction with other software and systems, are applied to the spectroscopy of hydrocarbons in support of planetary atmosphere studies, and, most recently, to the problem of resolution enhancement of images in astronomy. Hubble images,as well as Jovian SL9 comet crash images obtained at the Phillips Starfire Optical Range, are refined using the image enhancement programs. 
<p>
Lawrence Technological University: Wireless Bridging of Remote LANs Lawrence Technological University, a college with an enrollment of 4,500 students located 30 minutes from downtown Detroit, has been using a wireless bridge for the past two years to connect LANs in three different buildings on its campus. The bridge, which is based on an Intersect Remote Bridge--a box about the size of a low-profile PC with a directional antenna--from Persoft Inc., of Madison, Wisc., transmits data between remote Ethernet LANs at speeds that are somewhat faster than a T1 line--about 2Mbits per second.
<p>
University of Illinois: Implementation of the Virtual Classroom
In the engineering department at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, several projects are in place to investigate innovative uses of computers to improve student learning. CircuitTutor, an infinitely patient "electronic teaching assistant" is used with students taking introductory circuit analysis. Students also submit homework and take quizzes electronically over the Internet for immediate feedback on their progress. With PacerForum bulletin board software, it is possible to post messages containing text in various fonts, sizes, and colors, as well as graphics, digitized voice recordings, and any type of file.

Publishing on the World Wide Web: Organization and Design<br>
by Patrick J. Lynch<br>
<p>
Patrick Lynch considers the organizational and technical implications of publishing on the World Wide Web, as well as the creation of an effective interface to electronically published materials via well-designed Web pages. An excerpt follows:
<p>
<blockquote>Educational Web Publishing: Not Just Another Pretty Interface
The implications of WWW electronic publishing by educational institutions fall into two interrelated information management categories: the transmission of information to faculty, staff, and students within the organization (the internal agenda); and what is intended for the rest of the world, including academic colleagues, prospective students, alumni, and prospective donors (the external agenda). Addressing both agendas will probably require some fundamental changes in your school's administrative and academic information management policies, starting with a realization that your school's WWW pages and any other Internet-accessible information you have posted may already be one of the most widely seen and influential views the world has of your campus and institutional behavior. Is anyone on your campus asking just what your WWW pages are saying about your university? They will.</blockquote>

Technology-Mediated Learning: Are We There Yet?<br>
by Carole Cotton, CCA Consulting Inc.<br>
<p>
Carole Cotton reports on findings from CCA Consulting Inc.'s study, Understanding Information Systems in Higher Education, 1994. The study shows measurable progress in several technology areas that support computer-mediated learning. An excerpt follows:
<p>
<blockquote>How Is Technology Used in Courses?
Perhaps the easiest way to understand the current nature and magnitude of technology usage is by referring to the following chart. The basic and expected forms of usage are at the top of the list. We might have expected that 42 percent of all lab course sections use technology, but were pleasantly surprised to find that technology is involved in the mainstream instructional activities of approximately 20 percent or more of all course sections in: the classroom; instructor presentation; course administration; classroom, lab, and preparation; as well as in labs. Further, it was very encouraging to be able to account for a 6-to-9 percent presence of emerging activities like on-line testing and on-line access to multimedia materials.</blockquote>

<strong>Multimedia</strong>
Enhancing Instruction With Multimedia<br>
by James S. Noblitt<br>
<p>
James Noblitt examines how instruction is enhanced by multimedia. An excerpt follows:
<p>
<blockquote>Information technologies, over time, have the power to transform completely instructional methodologies. Print technology, for example, has caused the word "literate" to become synonymous with "educated." Much more than reading and writing is required of the educated person in the modern information era, however. We rely on "multimedia" presentations of sound, image, and text to keep us informed, and the computer has become an important tool for helping us to sort through and organize all the information that is directed to our attention. More importantly for educational purposes, computers are used to locate and process information that is relevant to our interests and well-being. We are increasingly less skeptical about the benefits of information technology, but we wish to understand more about its implications for current educational practices. We have moved from "So what?" to "Yes, but..."</blockquote>

<strong>Distance Learning</strong><br>
Education and Commercial Providers: Merging on the Information Highway?<br>
by Jiri Weiss<br>
<p>
Jiri Weiss explores how educational institutions and commercial providers may partner to provide distance learning programs. An excerpt follows:
<p>
<blockquote>Government, consumers, business, and cash-strapped educational institutions facing record enrollments all want to see education and not entertainment as the primary focus for the coming National Informational Infrastructure (NII). Just what that educational content will be and who will provide it remains an open question, however. With private industry gearing up to provide much of the delivery, universities and colleges are fighting a rear-guard action through organizations such as EDUCOM to make sure they stay ahead of the competition or at least don't lose control over content.</blockquote>

The <B><A NAME="tabfault">Fault-Tolerant Computing TC</A></B>
is aimed at identifying and integrating approaches, methods and
techniques for specifying, designing, building, assessing, validating,
operating and maintaining computer systems where faults are considered
as natural, anticipated events, and thus, can be tolerated. A
wide variety of faults are considered: accidental faults (physical,
design-induced, or originating from human interaction) and intentional
faults, as well. Specifically, the TC is concerned with progress
in: (i) understanding of faults and their effects; (ii) specification
and design methods for fault-tolerant computing; (iii) validation,
and design for testability and verifiability; (iv) assessing,
through modeling and measurement, the dependability achieved.
Technical activity ranges from basic research to current design
practice and field experience. The International Symposium on
Fault-Tolerant Computing (FTCS) is the annual flagship activity
of this TC -- this year, FTCS will celebrate its Silver Jubilee.
The TC sponsors annually workshops focusing on various aspects
of fault-tolerant computing. It also co-sponsors several other
conferences organized by the IEEE Computer Society, the International
Federation of Information Processing, and the Council of European
Professional Informatics Societies. The TC publishes an electronic
newsletter containing meeting reports, calls for papers, and news
announcements.

<p><font face=arial,helvetica,geneva><a name="ieeequal"><b>What are the qualifications for joining the IEEE?</b></a></font></p>

<p>Because of the diffferent levels of membership offered by the IEEE, it is better to call them direct using the toll-free number 1-800-678-4333 or 1-908-981-0060.</p>

<hr size="1" width="50%" noshade>

<p><font face=arial,helvetica,geneva><a name="benefits"><b>What are the benefits of joining the Computer Society? </b></a></font></p>

<ul>
<li>A personal subscription to <i><a href="../pubs/computer/computer.htm">Computer</a></i> magazine, the flagship publication of the IEEE Computer Society. </li>

<li>Opportunities to participate in <a href="../standard/standard.htm">Standards Working Groups</a> and <a href="../tab/tab.htm">Technical Committees.</a></li>

<li>Opportunities to develop leadership and management skills by holding elective office in the society or by serving as a volunteer on one of the society's many <a href="../csinfo/org.htm">boards and committees</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Individuals may join the Computer Society by itself or in conjunction with joining the <a href="http://www.ieee.org">IEEE</a>. IEEE membership benefits include subscriptions to <i>IEEE Spectrum</i> and <i>The Institute</i>, as well as access to IEEE technical and educational activities and personal, financial, and insurance programs. </p>

<p><font face=arial,helvetica,geneva><a name="endorsement"><b>I want to join the IEEE and/or the Computer Society but I do not know anyone who is an IEEE member as an endorser.</b></a></font></p>

<p>If no IEEE member is known, you can provide two references familiar with your education or professional experience in order to join the IEEE. If joining just the Computer Society, the individual need not be an IEEE member. You can provide the name of someone who knows you professionally (e.g. a colleague or a manager). </p>

<hr size="1" width="50%" noshade>

<p><font face=arial,helvetica,geneva><a name="fullyear"><b>Do I sign up for a full year or half year?</b></a></font></p>

<p>Membership is annualized to and expires on December 31.  Between September 1 and February 28, only full-year applications are accepted and membership plus any subscriptions would run from January to December. Back issues are sent for those members who apply for full-year membership and/or subscriptions during January and February. </p>

<p>Between March 1 and August 31, only half-year memberships are accepted. Membership and subscriptions begin in July and end in December.  Back issues are sent for anyone joining in July and August. </p>

<p><font face=arial,helvetica,geneva><a name="subscribe"><b>I want a subscription to one of your periodicals, but I don't want to be a member of the Computer Society.</b></a></font></p>

<p>If you are a member of or work for a profesional technical organization, a <a href="../subscrib/afflsub.htm">sister society subscription plan</a> is available.</p>

<hr size="1" width="50%" noshade>

<p><font face=arial,helvetica,geneva><a name="library"><b>What are the library subscription prices and why the discrepancy in pricing? </b></a></font></p>

<p><a href="../subscrib/librysub.htm">Library rates</a> are typically and traditionally much higher than individual rates for all periodicals. A library is providing a subscription for many readers as opposed to one.</p>

<p><font face=arial,helvetica,geneva><a name="studentqual"><b>What are the qualifications for student membership? </b></a></font></p>

<p>Student membership in the Computer Society requires an IEEE student membership. To qualify for student membership in the IEEE you must: </p>

<ul>
<li>Carry at least 50% of a normal full-time academic program. </li>

<li>Be a registered undergraduate or graduate student. </li>

<li>Be in a course of study in an IEEE designated field. </li>

<p><font face=arial,helvetica,geneva><a name="csstudent"><b>I am a full-time student, and I want to join just the Computer Society.</b></a></font></p>

<p>It is a requirement of the IEEE that students join both the IEEE and Computer Society. </p>

<hr size="1" width="50%" noshade>

<p><font face=arial,helvetica,geneva><a name="studendorse"><b>What are the requirements for a student endorsement?</b></a></font></p>

<p>You need to obtain the signature of the IEEE advisor or counselor or a faculty member who is also an IEEE member. </p>

<hr size="1" width="50%" noshade>

<p><font face=arial,helvetica,geneva><a name="signup"><b>I want to sign up over the phone.</b></a></font></p>

<p>A signature is required on <a href="mmbrshp.htm">membership</a> and <a href="../subscrib/subscrib.htm">subscription forms</a>. As a result, you can not sign up by phone. </p>

<hr size="1" width="50%" noshade>

<p><font face=arial,helvetica,geneva><a name="payment"><b>Do you accept purchase orders or can you invoice?</b></a></font></p>

<p><font face=arial,helvetica,geneva><a name="renew"><b>I want to renew my membership.</b></a></font></p>

<h1><img src="../cs100.gif" align=absmiddle hspace=10>About the Computer Society</h1>

<br clear=left>

<hr>

<p>With more than 100,000 members, the IEEE Computer Society is the world's leading organization of computer professionals.  <a href="../history/history.htm"> Founded in 1946, </a>, it is the largest of the 35 societies organized under the umbrella of the <a href="http://www.ieee.org">Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)</a>.

<p>The Computer Society's vision is to be <i> the leading provider of technical information and services to the world's computing professionals.</i>  In November of 1994, the Board of Governors of the IEEE Computer Society adopted a <a href="plan/execsum.htm">Strategic Plan</a> that positions the society to effectively face the new millennium. The plan identifies 38 strategic objectives that will be an carried out by the governing boards, volunteers and staff of the society.  

<p>The society is dedicated to advancing the theory, practice, and application of computer and information processing technology.  Through its <a href="../conferen/conf.htm">conferences and tutorials</a>, <a href="../pubs/pubs.htm">applications- and research-oriented journals</a>, <a href="../chapter/chapter.htm">local</a> and <a href="../student/student.htm"> student branch chapters</a>, <a href="../tab/tab.htm">technical committees</a>, and <a href="../standard/standard.htm">standards</a> working groups, the society promotes an active exchange of information, ideas, and technological innovation among its members.  In addition, it accredits collegiate programs of computer science and engineering in the United States. 

<p>The society is uniquely positioned to be a major force in the newly emerging global marketplace.  With nearly a third of its members living and working outside the United States, the Computer Society fosters international communication, cooperation, and information exchange.  To meet the needs of its members conveniently and efficiently, the society maintains service center offices in Brussels and Tokyo, in addition to its publications office in Los Alamitos, California, and its headquarters office in Washington, DC.</p>

<p>The IEEE Computer Society traces its origins to the 1946 formation of the Subcommittee on Large-Scale Computing of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers (AIEE). Five years later, the Institute of Radio Engineers (IRE) formed its Professional Group on Electronic Computers. The principal volunteer officers of both these groups were designated chairs. The AIEE and the IRE merged in 1963 to become the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). The respective committee and group of the predecessor organizations combined to form the modern IEEE Computer Society. The society's principal volunteer officer has been designated as president since 1970. The Computer Society celebrates its fiftieth anniversary year in 1996.</p>

<h3>The fifties</h3>
<p>In the fifties, the PGEC became an organization with many elements of the present Computer Society, notably excepting the technical and education committees. Conferences were the most significant early activity, but publications grew rapidly with some 1,800 editorial pages generated during the decade. At the end of the fifties, the PGEC was the largest professional group in the IRE. It had 19 chapters across the US and 8,874 members, including 8,129 full members, 679 student members, and 66 affiliates.

<hr SIZE=2>
<h3>The sixties</h3>
<p>PGEC services in the early sixties were much the same as in the late fifties, although the number of conferences and transactions pages continued to increase. However, in 1961, the PGEC leadership began to consider creating technical committees. These committees would provide more forums for special interests and, at the same time, reduce the chance of these interests forming separate IRE groups and segmenting the field. In May 1962, the first of these committees, a logic and switching theory committee, was approved to operate jointly with the AIEE committee already in operation.

<p>Concurrently, merger plans were proceeding between the IRE and AIEE. The IRE-AIEE merger into the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers began at the headquarters level in 1963. The PGEC then became the Professional Technical Group on Electronic Computers, and very shortly thereafter, the Computer Group. In early 1963, the group began operating with an Administrative Committee that included a mix of PGEC and AIEE CDC people. The final merger was completed in April 1964.

<p>A major step was taken in July 1966 with the first issue of the bimonthly <i>Computer Group News</i>, which included group and industry news, applied and tutorial articles, a guide to computer literature, and a repository of computer articles. Repository materials were available to the profession for a nominal charge.

<p><i>Computer Group News</i> opened the door for many magazines in the society, as well as in IEEE. But it was also significant in another way. With the publication of its own magazine, the Computer Group employed and managed its own small full-time staff in the Los Angeles area for publications support and other administrative activities. The Computer Group was the first IEEE group to employ its own staff, and it was a major factor in the growth of the society.

<p>In 1968, <i>IEEE Transactions on Computers</i> became a monthly publication. The number of published periodical pages grew to almost 9,700 pages in the transactions and about 640 in the <i>Computer Group News</i>. Membership grew to 16,862, including 4,200 students and 158 affiliates. The decade closed with 41 chapters.

<hr SIZE=2>
<h3>The seventies</h3>

<p>In 1971, the Computer Group became the Computer Society. (The Computer Group promoted this name change to better represent the stature it and other IEEE groups had attained.) For the Computer Society, the seventies was a decade of significant growth in both the depth and breadth of services. Membership grew by a factor of over two-and-a-half. 

<p>The society's publication program grew rapidly. The <i>Computer Group News</i>, renamed <i>Computer</i> in 1972, became a monthly publication in 1973, and significantly increased its tutorial-oriented content. At the same time, <i>IEEE Transactions on Computers</i> was unbundled from it, making <i>Computer</i> the only publication received automatically with society membership. The subscriber base to the now optional transactions held up well, and the society learned it could expand its publications program outside the membership dues structure.

<p>The society introduced the <i>IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering</i> in 1975, and the <i>IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence</i> in January 1979. The decade saw the publication of more than 25,000 periodical pages: about 13,500 pages for the <i>IEEE Transactions on Computers</i>, about 4,100 pages for the <i>IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering</i>, over 400 pages for the <i>IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis &amp; Machine Intelligence</i>, and over 8,000 editorial pages for <i>Computer</i>.

<p>Late in the decade, the society formalized its nonperiodical publications into the Computer Society Press. The operation mainly produced conference proceedings, tutorial texts, and reprints in the seventies.

<p>Fourteen new technical committees were formed, making a total of 20 by the end of the period. The committees contributed significantly to growth in the number of specialty conferences and meetings. In the late seventies, the Computer Society was sponsoring or cosponsoring about 50 technical conferences, meetings, and symposia, many with ACM.

<p>The society initiated the Education Committee in 1970, and produced the first model curriculum in 1976. The Distinguished Visitor Program began providing speakers to chapters in 1971.

<p>The Computer Society was also the first IEEE society to establish student branch chapters. This activity began in 1974 as an experiment and was subsequently adopted by the IEEE. Additionally, the society formalized and expanded its awards program in this decade.

<p>The staff supporting the society's operations also grew. The position of executive secretary was created in 1971. By the end of the decade the Computer Society staff numbered 16 permanent employees: two in the executive secretary's home office in Silver Spring, Maryland, and 14 in the publishing group's rented space in Long Beach, California, plus several temporary part-time people in both locations. The needs and viability of the publishing organization grew to the extent that, late in the decade, the society started the process of acquiring its own building in Los Alamitos, California.

<p>By the end of the seventies, Computer Society membership had grown to 43,930, including 7,833 students and 3,943 affiliates. There were now more than 100 chapters, including about 30 student branch chapters.

<h3>The eighties</h3>
<p>Within the Computer Society, the growth of the seventies continued in every function, but with new dimensions and changing emphasis. This was the decade of new magazines, major standards activities, new education initiatives, international services, and a significant growth and refinement of staff services and facilities.

<p>Within the society, the breadth of the profession and member interest in the more tutorial-oriented materials published in <i>Computer</i> prompted the creation of similar magazines in specialty areas. The society introduced <i>IEEE Computer Graphics &amp; Applications</i> in January 1981, <i>IEEE Micro</i> in February 1981, both <i>IEEE Design &amp; Test</i> and <i>IEEE Software</i> in February 1984, and <i>IEEE Expert</i> in the spring of 1986.

<p><i>IEEE Transactions on Knowledge &amp; Database Engineering</i> was introduced in September 1989. <i>IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering</i> and <i>IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis &amp; Machine Intelligence</i> moved from bimonthly to monthly publication in 1985 and 1989, respectively.

<p>The society published more than 65,200 periodical editorial pages during the decade -- with over 33,400 pages in transactions and 31,800 pages in magazines, including 12,700 in Computer.

<p>The number of technical committees continued to grow, mirroring the diversity in the computer industry. Fifteen new technical committees brought the total to 33 by the end of the decade. These committees were the primary sources of conferences and meetings. The society sponsored and cosponsored more than 50 conferences annually and cooperated, without financial involvement, with other organizations in dozens more. Interest in the more vertical or specialty conferences increased, relative to the broad conferences such as Compcon and Compsac. Several of the specialty conferences drew many more attendees than the broad-based conferences. The number of meetings held outside the US grew significantly, many of them sponsored by technical committees. In the eighties the society sponsored and cosponsored more than 90 conferences outside the US. CompEuro was initiated in 1987, cosponsored with IEEE's Region 8.

<p>The technical committees began to support standards activities in a major way. The results were remarkable. At the end of the decade, 56 standards had been approved and 125 working groups were under way. These projects involved well over 5,000 people.

<p>The growth in society services was clearly fueled by the industry's growth and by the many volunteer professionals who were motivated to provide the technical base for these services. But this growth simply would not have been possible without the staff support that developed during this period. The society brought in its first executive director in 1982, and the staff developed from 16 people at the beginning of the eighties into a highly professional operation of 94 people by the end of the decade.

<p>The Computer Group staff operations had begun in the garages and basements of its first publisher and executive secretary. In early 1980 the West Coast publishing operation moved into its newly purchased building, and in 1985 the space was doubled with the purchase of the adjoining building. Also in 1985, the society purchased its current headquarters building in Washington, D.C., and extended its staff support overseas by opening an office in Brussels. The Brussels office was expanded in 1987. In 1988, an office was opened in Tokyo. These offices represent a major step in serving the society internationally.</p>

</p>

<p><i>IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications</i> bridges the theory and
practice of computer graphics. </p>

<p>From specific algorithms to full system implementations, CG&amp;A offers
a unique combination of peer-reviewed feature articles and informal departments,
including news and product announcements. Special applications sidebars
relate research stories to commercial development. A cover story focuses
on creative applications of the technology by an artist or designer. And
graphics all-stars Jim Blinn and Andrew Glassner offer insight and wit
in their popular columns. Published six times a year, <i>IEEE CG&amp;A</i>
is indispensable reading for people working at the leading edge of computer
graphics technology and its applications in everything from visualization
to imaging and multimedia.</p>

<p>The <i>IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering</i> is an archival journal published monthly. We are interested in well-defined theoretical results and empirical studies that have potential impact on the construction, analysis, or management of software. The scope of this Transactions ranges from the mechanisms through the development of principles to the application of those principles to specific environments. Since the journal is archival, it is assumed that the ideas presented are important, have been well analyzed, and/or empirically validated and are of value to the software engineering research or practitioner community. Specific topic areas include: a) development and maintenance methods and models, e.g., techniques and principles for the specification, design, and implementation of software systems, including notations and process models; b) assessment methods, e.g., software tests and validation, reliability models, test and diagnosis procedures, software redundancy and design for error control, and the measurements and evaluation of various aspects of the process and product; c) software project management, e.g., productivity factors, cost models, schedule and organizational issues, standards; d) tools and environments, e.g., specific tools, integrated tool environments including the associated architectures, databases, and parallel and distributed processing issues; e) system issues, e.g., hardware-software trade-off; and f) state-of-the-art surveys that provide a synthesis and comprehensive review of the historical development of one particular area of interest.</p>

<h2><p align=center>TASK FORCE DESCRIPTIONS AND CONTACTS</h2><p>

IEEE Computer Society Task Forces (TFs) are <i>ad hoc</i> subcommittees of the Technical Activities Board (TAB).  The purpose of a Task Force is to foster new activities in a particular technical discipline and determine whether additional effort and a larger organizational structure (such as a technical committee) is appropriate.  A task force is expected to have a finite existence (a period of 2-3 years).  Proposals for new Task Forces should be made to the Vice President of Technical Activities.  Task Forces are networks
of professionals with common interests in computer hardware, software, applications, and interdisciplinary fields. <p>

<b>TASK FORCES:</b><br>

<A NAME="present">The </a><B><A HREF="#ieeecs">Computer Society</A> </B>(CS) of the <B><A HREF="#ieeecs">Institute of Electrical and Electronic 
Engineers </A></B>(IEEE)  has supported the establishment of a <B>Technical Committee </B>
(TC) on <B>Computer Generated Music</B> (CGM). Defined as the vast 
interdisciplinary area of computer science and electrical engineering that 
stretches between artistic music composed or played with computers at one end 
and audio signal processing at the other, CGM opens new possibilities for 
research and practice which, as the IEEE CS has recognized, are increasingly 
acquiring importance in science and technology - not to mention music itself. 
Computer Science, for example, has recognized for years the broader 
implications of its results in other disciplines such as philosophy, anthropology, 
psychology, linguistics and neurophysiology. Music is possibly the best example 
of a discipline that deals mostly with <I>qualitative</I>, rather than quantitative, 
issues, and has therefore more and more appeal for those computer scientists 
working at the last frontiers of the field, dealing with common sense, inductive 
reasoning and intuition.<P>

The TC on CGM shares common goals with all Technical Committees in the 
Computer Society, namely, activities for the practitioner and the researcher in 
the field, in the form of: publications, conferences, special sections in existing 
IEEE CS magazines and transactions. In addition, since CGM is not yet a 
universally accepted teaching and research topic within existing academic 
institutions and research laboratories, it is considering the publication of 
textbooks (with associated Compact Disks with related audio material), of 
interactive, multi-medial CDs (with hypertext, sounds and images for special 
topics) and of proceedings and the like in electronic form. It strives to 
collaborate with institutions dedicated to the establishment of standards as and 
also with existing societies dedicated to Computer Music or aspects of it, as well 
as to serve as a reference point for instrument manufacturers and for the music 
industry.<P>

<A NAME="publ">In</a>
a general sense, this Technical Committee has been in existence, in the form 
of a group of 

 contributors to the field and interested people, for over three 
years, and has produced: the special 
<A HREF="readin.htm"><IMG ALIGN=right HSPACE=10 SRC ="readin.gif"></A>
 <A HREF="july91.htm"><I><B>July 1991</B></I> issue of <I><B>COMPUTER</B></I></A> dedicated

<I><B>cassette</B></I> <A HREF="cd.htm">(click <B>here</B> to listen)</A>  - the first time the CS Press has published audio material; and the book 
<A HREF="readin.htm"><I><B>Readings in Computer Generated Music</B></I></A>, the first of a series of hard-cover 
tutorials, in 1992. Recently it has published the CD-ROM <A HREF="imw.htm"><I><B>An Intelligent Music 
Workstation</B></I></A>, a collection of Macintosh programs for music composition and 
manipulation of music pieces. All these publications are available from the 
IEEE Computer Society Press, 10662 Los Vaqueros Circle, PO Box 3014, Los 
Alamitos, CA 90720-1264, USA, fax # 714-821-4641, <a href=mailto:cs.books@computer.org>cs.books@computer.org</a>.

From its beginnings, the TC has sponsored conferences and events worldwide, 
such as the <I>First International Conference on Cognitive Musicology</I> (Finland, 
1993), the <A HREF="xcolb.htm"><I>10th Colloquium on Musical Informatics</I> (Italy, 1993)</A>, the 
<I>Colloquium on New Music Research</I> (Belgium, 1994) and a <I>Panel on Music

<P>The Supercomputing conference has always been at the forefront of 
technology, both in the information presented at the conference and the 
methods used to disseminate the conference proceedings.  The 
<A href="http://www.sdsc.edu/SC95">1995 Supercomputing conference</a> will 
only publish an electronic version of the proceedings.  This year's  
Supercomputing conference has taken an initial step in the direction of an 
electronic proceeding by providing a central World Wide Web home page with 
links to the 
<a href="http://sc94.ameslab.gov/AP/contents.html">advance program</a>,
the 
<A href="sctoc.html">proceedings of the technical papers</A>, and abstracts 
from the 
<A href="posters.html">poster papers</A> and 
<A href="exhibits/exhibtoc.html">research exhibits</A>. <B>Note:  Submission of 
abstracts and full text papers was optional.  Although most authors did 
submit files there are some papers and exhibits for which electronic files 
were not submitted.</B>

<P><A href="sctoc.html">Proceedings:</a> An electronic version of the table of contents of the proceedings linked to abstracts, and the full text papers that have been submitted in HTML or postscript (if submitted by the author). 

<P><A href="exhibits/exhibtoc.html"> Research Exhibits:</a>  These exhibits are, in general, highly interactive, and participants will be able to discuss the projects with their developers one-on-one.  A list of the research exhibits is linked to the abstracts.  Several exhibitors have also provide a WWW address which can be accessed from a link within the abstract.

<P><A href="posters.html"> Posters:</a> The poster sessions at Supercomputing '94 will allow participants to see and discuss
late-breaking research results with authors. Technical poster presentations will include both
traditional posters as well as video-display posters in two sessions. The first session will be held
on Tuesday, 3:30 PM to 5:00 PM, while the second will be held on Tuesday, 5:30 PM to 7:00
PM, with a reception.  A list of poster papers is linked to the abstracts.  Posters from

<p>This represents the Fifth AI, Simulation, and Planning Conference for high autonomy systems. High autonomy systems are large scale dynamic systems involving many interacting intelligent or controlled entities. Past conferences were held in Tucson (Arizona), Cocoa Beach (Florida); and Perth, Australia. 

<p>Large scale simulation models are increasingly executed within parallel and distributed computing environments. Distributed Interactive Simulation (DIS) directly involves the human in the simulation loop, and contains the real-time communication of heterogeneous simulators spread throughout wide geographical areas. Research in distributed simulation has taken place across many fronts: (1) Military DIS IEEE standard and workshops; (2) Continuous model parallelization; and (3) Discrete model (PDES) parallelization. The purpose of this conference is to focus on basic research problems in the overall area of distributed simulation with an emphasis on problems occurring in interactive environments

<p>This year's <A href="ais94toc.html">conference proceedings</a> are being made available in hardcopy as well as electronically.  The World Wide Web home page links the table of contents with the author submitted abstracts and either postscript or html files.

<h1 align=center>Advertising your conference</h1>

<hr>

<p>Conference organizers can promote three different stages of their conference:

<ul>
<li>Call for Papers - published eight to eleven months before the conference.
<li>Advance Announcement -- published three to four months before the conference.
<li>Advance Program - published two to three months before the conference.
</ul>

<p>Advertising is a cost effective way to increase exposure for your conference. For example, you can reach 90,000 readers in Computer magazine for $17 per thousand or less than two cents per person. Conferences that are sponsored or co-sponsored by the Computer Society receive significantly reduced advertising rates. Computer Society conference rates are 70% lower than commercial rates.

<h1>Publishing Proceedings with CS Press</h1>

<hr>

<p>Every symposium and conference sponsored or cosponsored by the Computer Society is encouraged to publish a proceedings. This is the only official record that will result from the meeting and it is a tangible way in which your conference can gain worldwide exposure and reach practitioners in the field who cannot attend your event. Conference proceedings are valued and often referenced.

<p>For information on proceedings publication, contact the <a href=mailto:t.ross@computer.org>Periodical Production Manager</a>.

<h3>IEEE Computer Society Press Publishing Services</h3>

<ul>
<li><a href="#cdrom">CD-ROM Publication</a>
<li><a href="#www">WWW Publication</a>
<li><a href="#procprod">Proceedings Production Management</a>
<li><a href="#copyrt">Proceedings Copyright</a>
</ul>

<p>IEEE Computer Society Press has long been a leader in publishing, marketing, and distributing hard-copy conference proceedings (over 135 conferences in 1996) to more than 100,000 IEEE Computer Society members, university and technical libraries, and booksellers and wholesalers worldwide. In 1996, CS Press began to offer selected conferences electronic delivery options, such as CD-ROMs and World Wide Web (WWW) distribution, in addition to traditional hard-copy publication.

<p>Proceedings author kit information, our standard copyright form, a comprehensive staff directory, and the CS Press publications catalog are all available from the <a href=../cspress/instruct.htm>Proceedings Author Guidelines</a> page on our WWW site. CS Press will also utilize email and file transfer protocol (ftp) to send author kits and receive papers.

<h4><a name="cdrom">CD-ROM Publication</a></h4>
<p>Conference proceedings produced on a CD-ROM provide electronic access to the full text of every paper in the proceedings. One CD-ROM can store 250,000 pages or 12,000 images (several years' conference proceedings) -- with excellent search and retrieval capabilities, and the option to include both video and animation.

<h4><a name="www">WWW Publication</a></h4>
<p>Conference proceedings published on the Computer Society's World Wide Web (URL: http://computer.org) comprise hypertext versions of the table of contents linked to the abstracts of the proceedings papers, along with a PostScript or HTML file of the complete paper provided by the author. In addition, we will provide links to other information about your conference, such as calls for papers for the upcoming year, advance programs, registration information, and other conference-specific materials. In addition to providing search capability and hyperlinks, your presence on the WWW will offer global visibility and greatly increase publicity for your conference.

<p><a href=conf.htm#wwwproc>Examples of WWW conference proceedings and information.</a>

<p>Pricing for all electronic publishing projects is developed on a case-by-case basis, as projects and requirements are defined.

<h3><a name="procprod">Proceedings Production Management</a></h3>
<p>CS Press manages all editorial and production functions involved in publishing conference proceedings. The publication process usually begins three to four months prior to the conference date for proceedings to be distributed at the conference; for postproceedings, the process can begin immediately following the conference or several months thereafter. CS Press production editors will coordinate with conference delegates to schedule all key events -- from sending instructions for authors' kits to final delivery of the printed books at the conference site. Experienced CS Press production editors are available to answer questions or provide additional instructions at any critical juncture throughout the publication process, and perform the following production functions:

<p>Determine production schedules (subject to conference concurrence) to coordinate author kit mailings and paper due dates at CS Press with printing, binding, and shipping dates for the timely arrival of proceedings at the conference site, or at a specified later date, as postproceedings;

<p>Email author kit instructions to the email addresses of authors whose papers have been accepted. (Or, if traditional hard-copy author kits are required, send hard-copy author kits to addresses provided by conference chair.) Either kit may also be sent to your designated representatives for subsequent distribution. The kits contain complete instructions on how to prepare and submit papers as PostScript files in camera-ready form (to one specified format, with consistent type sizes, styles, and headings for all papers in the proceedings);

<p>Receive and check all PostScript files (whether received directly from the authors or from designated chairpersons) for completeness and inclusion of a signed copyright release form; 

<p>Secure all required national and international bibliographic cataloging and registration numbers. Complete camera-ready pagination and affix individual copyright notices and other additions to beginnings or ends of papers;

<p>Oversee design and composition of covers, title pages, copyright pages, tables of contents, author indices, introductions, forewords, divider pages, and other front matter to Press standards;

<p>Track production and delivery schedule and coordinate shipping arrangements between printers and conference site organizers to ensure on-time delivery to the specified location;

<p>Track overlength page charges; forward checks and names of authors of overlength papers to the conference chair; and

<p>Disburse cash payments to vendors as required throughout.

<h4>Tutorial Notes</h4>
<p>Computer Society Press can also provide tutorial notes to match your conference proceedings.

<h4>Reprints</h4>
<p>Press will be responsible for fulfilling reprint orders for conference proceedings papers. A reprint order form is included in the kits that are sent to authors 

<h4>Quantity</h4>
<p>CS Press will provide the conference with an option to purchase an additional 10% (up to a maximum of 100 additional copies) at original cost if conference registration increases. To avoid having to pay for (and subsequently store or destroy) unused copies of their conference proceedings, conference officials should order only the number of proceedings required for distribution at the conference and immediately afterwards. This number can be revised, prior to printing and binding, through the Press Managing Editor. For economic reasons, the minimum acceptable order for printing and binding a proceedings is 100 copies.

<h4>Pricing</h4>
<p>Conferences that are sponsored by the Computer Society are often joined in the print run by the IEEE Bookbroker Program. The program supplies proceedings and other publications to subscribers like libraries. The print run is increased by the number of copies that the IEEE wishes to purchase for its bookbroker program; consequently the pricing to the conference organizer is usually reduced by a significant amount. In effect, the IEEE bears a significant portion of the cost of producing the proceedings.

<p>The Computer Society will be responsible for publishing and delivering the finished proceedings to each conference site and to the IEEE Service Center. The Computer Society will produce, at its own cost, copies of conference proceedings for resale. In return for these services, the conference will pay CS Press for all copies published for conference distribution. The per-copy price is calculated in the following manner: the conference provides an approximate number of pages that it expects the proceedings to comprise and the number of copies that it wishes to order. Production costs are estimated based on the total print run (the conference order plus any additional orders (usually the IEEE order, but also other society purchases, like the ACM). The conference organizer is then quoted that pricing as a guaranteed not-to-exceed per-copy cost. The final cost will never exceed the original quotation, unless the number of copies ordered by the conference is reduced, or unless the page count increases from the original estimate. In effect, the conference organizer is billed for the actual production costs of publishing the proceedings.

<p>For pricing estimates, contact the <a href=mailto:t.ross@computer.org>Publications Production Manager</a>.

<h3><a name="copyrt">Proceedings Copyright</a></h3>

<p>The Computer Society requires that original papers in the proceedings of meetings it sponsors, cosponsors, or cooperates in be copyrighted for the protection of the authors, their organizations, and the sponsoring societies and cooperating entities.  Assignment by the authors usually is made to IEEE on a standard copyright form. In those instances where the copyright may be held by an entity other than an IEEE entity, the holding entity should agree in writing that there will be free and unencumbered access and reuse rights to those papers published in the proceedings, by all sponsors, cosponsors, and cooperating entities, provided that:

<ol>
<li> The original copyright holder is informed of the reuse or republication by the sponsor, cosponsor, or cooperating entity; 
<li>That standard acknowledgment and credit lines appear on the first page of the reused republished paper;
<li>That the sponsor/cosponsor/cooperating entity is not acting as a third party on behalf of another non-related commercial or non-commercial organization wishing to reprint/reuse the paper; and
<li>That written permission is secured from the primary author of the paper in advance of the proposed reuse.
