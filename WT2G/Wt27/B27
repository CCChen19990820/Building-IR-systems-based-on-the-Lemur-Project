<h2>NAFTAmath: First Year Assessment</h2>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Some disturbing trends have emerged one year after
implementation of the North American Free Trade Agreement, a
never-before tried, high-risk experiment in which two countries
at far different stages of economic development and democratic
rights are attempting to merge their economies. These trends have
worsened in the wake of Mexico&thorn;s economic crisis and peso
devaluation, which combined with the NAFTA poses severe risks to
the interests of workers on both sides of the border. The overall
U.S. Trade surplus with Mexico, which declined 19 percent from
1993, is likely to become a substantial deficit in 1995. </p>
<p>One of the many deficiencies of NAFTA is that the agreement
specifically excludes exchange rate policies from coverage. The
danger in a &quot;competitive&quot; peso devaluation lies in the
inherent downward pressure on wages for workers in both countries
and additional incentives for U.S. companies to relocate to
Mexico. NAFTA already has locked into legal status a low-risk
environment for investment that provides full access to the U.S.
market with zero tariffs. While the movement of billions of
dollars in direct foreign investment to Mexico has been
accelerated, the structural ties between the U.S. and Mexican
economies may shave U.S. economic growth by 0.4 of a percentage
point in 1995, by some estimates, and cost 350,000 American jobs. </p>
<p>As of Jan. 3, 1995, the U.S. Department of Labor had received
321 petitions involving 34,799 dislocated workers who believed
that NAFTA had caused their unemployment. Of that first-year
total, DOL has certified 152 petitions covering 17,320 workers as
experiencing NAFTA-related unemployment. For the U.S. worker
whose job moves to Mexico, it is unlikely that he or she will
find employment opportunities that pay wages and benefits
anywhere near the level paid by the job lost. Manufacturing
workers who lose their jobs to Mexico, especially those with
years of seniority, inevitably will encounter severe economic
hardship and a reduction in the standard of living for their
families. </p>
<p>Despite reports of rising unemployment, inflation and economic
gloom in Mexico, the export-only border assembly plants known as
maquiladoras appear to be emerging as big winners because of the
peso&thorn;s devaluation. The 2,140 mostly American-owned
maquiladora plants in Mexico near the U.S. border already were
experiencing a banner year before devaluation, having displaced
tourism and petroleum as Mexico&thorn;s official top generator of
dollars. During the first 10 months of 1994, maquiladora
employment increased 6.2 percent to 600,376 employees, and an
employer association forecasts the opening of another 600
assembly plants in 1995. </p>
<p>Because of the devalued peso, U.S. employers in the Mexican
maquilas will realize an annual windfall of more than $750
million, while their employees, whose earnings are far below
those of other Mexican production workers, endure even more
hardship. The top 10 percent of Mexicans earn as much as the
bottom 70 percent. The poverty rate in Mexico is approximately 40
percent and the unemployment rate in excess of 20 percent.
Two-thirds of Mexican workers are either unemployed or make less
than $10 a day, when the cost of basic subsistence for a typical
family of 5 is now approximately $16 a day. </p>
<p>Also inadequate is the promise of relief to workers who are
dislocated because of trade under NAFTA. The number of petitions
and certifications for NAFTA-TAA may be just the tip of the
iceberg. While meritorious petitions are being denied, service
workers such as truck drivers and railroad workers are
ineligible. The rigid deadline for enrolling in training is
preventing qualified workers from receiving assistance, and the
design and structure of the program for indirectly affected
workers is needlessly cumbersome. Because the program is so
inadequate, several unions have recommended that petitions be
filed for regular TAA instead of NAFTA-TAA. </p>
<p>Unions continue to seek justice under the NAFTA labor side
agreement, with no satisfaction. But a representative of the U.S.
Council on International Business noted that the ability of
Mexican and American unions to use NAFTA procedures to
&quot;create a public spotlight&quot; is troubling to many
executives. That is obviously very small consolation for workers
who lose their jobs and those facing the threat of job loss at
the bargaining table. </p>
<h3>The U.S. Trade Surplus Shrinks</h3>
<p>After 12 months of trade in the wake of the North American
Free Trade Agreement, implemented Jan. 1, 1994, some disturbing
developments appear in the numbers. An economic slowdown in
Mexico, combined with the devaluation of the peso, has resulted
in a shrinking U.S. trade surplus with Mexico. Exports of goods
to Mexico increased by 22 percent from 1993 to 1994. However,
U.S. IMPORTS from Mexico increased by an unprecedented 24
percent. For the first year of NAFTA, the overall trade surplus
in goods fell to $1.348 billion, a 19 percent decrease from 1993. </p>
<p>The shrinking trade surplus with Mexico in 1994 (the fourth
quarter saw a trade DEFICIT of $448 million) is a continuation of
a trend that began more than two years ago. The annual trade
surplus with Mexico appears to have peaked in 1992 at $5.4
billion, declining to only $1.7 billion in 1993 and then to $1.3
billion in 1994. </p>
<p>The economic slowdown in Mexico, in combination with a 50
percent devaluation of the peso, will make it more difficult to
export goods to Mexico in 1995 while leading to increased imports
from Mexico. This means that the U.S. bilateral trade balance
with Mexico will move to a substantial DEFICIT position in 1995. </p>
<p>Another disturbing trend in U.S.-Mexico trade during the first
year of NAFTA involves the exchange of high value-added goods
associated with high-paying jobs. U.S. manufacturers were
supposed to clean up in Mexico. Instead, electronics, computer
products and telecommunication equipment came into the United
States from Mexico twice as fast as they&thorn;ve gone in the
other direction. </p>
<p>A fact often emphasized by the Clinton administration is that
the percentage of U.S. auto exports to Mexico increased
substantially in the first year of NAFTA. In fact, the United
States exported 39,000 new cars and trucks to Mexico in 1994
&thorn; as compared with 6,000 in 1993. But Mexico increased its
exports of new cars and trucks to the United States from 331,000
in 1993 to 400,000 in 1994, an increase almost double the total
number coming from the United States. Furthermore, economists
anticipate the peso devaluation means U.S. exports to Mexico will
revert to approximately 5,000 new cars and trucks in 1995, while
Mexican exports will continue to soar. </p>
<p>As the following tables show, some industries will gain and
some will lose as a result of NAFTA. The restructuring of the
U.S. economy due to increases in North American trade will cause
substantial job loss in the &quot;loser&quot; industries. </p>
<h3>U.S. Job Loss From NAFTA</h3>
<p>During the NAFTA debate in Congress, supporters claimed that
170,000 U.S. jobs would be created by 1995 as a result of the
trade agreement. The figure was determined by using the
calculation that every billion dollars of net exports creates
20,000 jobs. According to this methodology, the trade surplus
with Mexico must reach $8.5 billion by 1995 to produce the
170,000 jobs. It is clear that given the shrinking trade surplus
with Mexico ($1.3 billion in 1994), NAFTA will not produce the
number of jobs claimed by NAFTA supporters by 1995. </p>
<p>More recently, NAFTA supporters claim that increased exports
to Mexico have created more than 100,000 jobs in 1994. They
refuse to acknowledge, however, that increased IMPORTS from
Mexico are destroying U.S. jobs. </p>
<p>Underscoring this reality is the disturbing admission of
Julius Katz, former deputy U.S. Trade Representative, who told
the Wall St. Journal, &quot;the job numbers are totally phony
numbers.&quot; </p>
<h3>AFL-CIO projections</h3>
<p>NAFTA locks into legal status a low-risk environment for
investment and provides full access to the U.S. market with zero
tariffs. Throughout the debate over the ratification of NAFTA,
the AFL-CIO maintained that NAFTA would only accelerate the
movement of billions of dollars in direct foreign investment to
Mexico, and result in the loss of up to 550,000 U.S. jobs over 10
years. Unfortunately, the first-year data on job loss as a result
of NAFTA tend to support the long-term projections of the
AFL-CIO. </p>
<h3>Joint Economic Committee</h3>
<p>A 1994 staff analysis by the Joint Economic Committee of
Congress, 1994 U.S.-Mexico Trade Data: NAFTA Impacts, contradicts
the notion that NAFTA has resulted in substantial job creation. </p>
<p>The JEC report points out that while exports do create jobs,
jobs are also eliminated by increased imports. Further, a
significant portion of the growth in exports has occurred in
products that are imported into the United States and then re-
exported to Mexico &thorn;so-called transshipments of foreign
goods. A more accurate measure of the overall effect of
U.S-Mexico trade is net exports &thorn;domestically produced
exports minus imports used for consumption. U.S. net exports to
Mexico declined by approximately $500 million over the first nine
months of NAFTA. </p>
<p>In fact, the JEC report suggests that the U.S. economy may
have lost up to 10,000 jobs from January to September as a result
of the decline in U.S. net exports to Mexico. The JEC job loss
estimate would be substantially increased with a year- end study
because of the $448 million trade deficit with Mexico in the
fourth quarter of 1994. </p>
<h3>NAFTA Transitional Adjustment Assistance</h3>
<p>Estimates of the employment impact of NAFTA can vary
considerably depending on methodology and assumptions. Some
numbers, however, cannot be disputed. </p>
<p>As of Jan. 3, 1995, the U.S. Department of Labor had received
321 petitions involving 34,799 dislocated workers who believed
that NAFTA had caused their unemployment. Of that first-year
total, DOL has certified 152 petitions covering 17,320 workers as
experiencing NAFTA-related unemployment. </p>
<h3>New Projections Following the Peso Crisis</h3>
<p>David Wyss, research director at DRI/McGraw Hill, told members
of the Senate Budget Committee Jan. 26, 1995, that Mexico&thorn;s
financial woes could shave U.S. economic growth by 0.4 of a
percentage point and cost 350,000 American jobs. If
Mexico&thorn;s troubles continue to spread in Latin America,
those estimates could double, he told lawmakers. According to
Wyss, reduced exports to Mexico increase the likelihood that the
U.S. economic slowdown could become a full-fledged recession. </p>
<p>The WEFA Group projects a severe recession in Mexico during
1995. Inflation will soar to about 23 percent and manufacturing
wages will rise by only 12 percent, resulting in a sharp cut in
real wages and, as a consequence, more than a 4 percent drop in
real consumer spending. Investment will decline by nearly 8
percent because of higher interest rates, a shortage of financial
capital and declining demand. WEFA expects total output in Mexico
to decline by nearly 3 percent, severely affecting U.S. exports
to Mexico. WEFA forecasts that U.S. exports to Mexico would be
cut by 50 percent and result in a loss of $24.7 billion in real
U.S. gross domestic product. The impact on U.S. employment will
be severe. </p>
<p>John Sharp, Texas State Comptroller, estimated that the fiscal
crisis in Mexico stemming from the devaluation of the peso will
shave as much as 0.5 of a percentage point off the state&thorn;s
overall growth rate of 3.2 percent for 1995. Jobs in the
manufacturing sector in Texas may decline by as much as 0.6
percent this year, he said. &quot;Because our state economy is
increasingly intertwined with Mexico&thorn;s, what happens to our
southern neighbor matters a great deal to us,&quot; Sharp said. </p>
<p>According to economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas,
the peso crisis could cost about 1 percent of total employment in
Texas over the next three years and choke exports in certain
industries. Texas industries that will be hardest hit by the
devaluation include furniture and fixtures, transportation
equipment, and electronics and electric equipment, according to
the Dallas Fed. Two-thirds of Texas&thorn;s total export sales of
furniture and fixtures now go to Mexico. </p>
<h3>Foreign Investment in NAFTA Countries</h3>
<h4>Investment in Mexico Soars</h4>
<p>The AFL-CIO has always maintained that NAFTA is as much about
foreign investment in Mexico as it is about trade liberalization.
NAFTA locks into legal status a low-risk environment for
investment and adds incentives to expand the Mexican export
platform to the United States, providing full access to the U.S.
market by eliminating tariffs on goods to this country. Available
data on investment in Mexico following the implementation of
NAFTA more than vindicate the AFL-CIO warnings. </p>
<p>Given time to analyze the agreement, economists from other
countries have subsequently come to the same conclusion.
&quot;NAFTA is a foreign sourcing and
competitiveness-strengthening strategy deployed by U.S.
multinational companies to take advantage of Mexico&thorn;s low
costs,&quot; claims Professor Satoru Nakamoto, Osaka City
University. &quot;With the added clarity and security that
[investment] provisions provide to foreign investors in North
America and the drastic reductions of Mexico&thorn;s tariffs on
regionally originating goods, transnational corporations will be
encouraged to rationalize the organization of their
North-American operations and to increase substantially foreign
direct investment in Mexico,&quot; states Professor Alan Rugman,
University of Toronto. </p>
<h4>Portfolio Investment</h4>
<p>Portfolio investment outlays for financial instruments such as
stocks, bonds and mutual funds of other countries &thorn; is more
short-term and more easily reversible. In 1993, portfolio
investment in Mexico increased by more than 400 percent over the
previous year, to $10.7 billion. Although the year-end numbers
are not yet available, portfolio investment in 1994, prior to the
peso devaluation, was running approximately 25 percent ahead of
1993. Portfolio investment will be more difficult to attract to
Mexico in light of the financial crisis and economic downturn.
The billions of dollars of &quot;hot money&quot; invested in
Mexico has now fled to opportunities that involve less
uncertainty than in Mexico. </p>
<h4>Foreign Direct Investment</h4>
<p>Foreign direct investment outlays for plants, equipment and
other tangible assets in other countries &thorn; has been on an
upward trend in Mexico since the mid- 1980s, the majority of
which came from the United States. This trend should continue for
the foreseeable future, especially since the devaluation of the
peso has effectively reduced the cost of purchasing such assets
in Mexico. </p>
<p>Direct foreign investment for 1994 totalled $8 billion, an
increase of 64 percent over the previous year. Of the $8 billion
total direct foreign investment, 40 percent was channeled into
manufacturing, 40 percent into services (including financial
services), 8.5 percent in transport and communications, 7.9
percent into commercial activities and 3.5 percent in
construction. </p>
<p>The United States led all foreign investors in Mexico with 50
percent of all direct investment. England followed with 14
percent, Japan 9 percent, The Netherlands 5 percent, Germany 5
percent and Canada only 2 percent. During the Salinas
administration, foreign investment in Mexico totalled more than
$50 billion. The United States led all foreign investors,
accounting for 63.2 percent of investment. </p>
<p>The most remarkable feature of the investment surge in Mexico
in 1994 was that it occurred in a period of great uncertainty in
Mexico. Political unrest in Chiapas, assassinations of key
political figures and kidnaping of prominent businessmen have
temporarily dampened enthusiasm for direct foreign investment in
Mexico. When the business climate stabilizes in Mexico, foreign
investment will far outstrip that of the first year of NAFTA. </p>
<p>Despite reports of rising unemployment, inflation and economic
gloom in Mexico, the export-only border assembly plants known as
maquiladoras appear to be emerging as big winners because of the
peso&thorn;s devaluation, the Washington Post reported Feb. 4,
1995. The 2,140 mostly American-owned maquiladora plants in
Mexico near the U.S. border already had had a banner year before
devaluation, now displacing tourism and petroleum as
Mexico&thorn;s official top generator of dollars. During the
first 10 months of 1994, maquiladora employment increased 6.2
percent to 600,376 employees, said Raul Avila, president of the
National Maquiladora Industry Council, which forecasts the
opening of another 600 assembly plants in 1995. An example of a
company that has moved production to Mexico is Woolrich, a
sportswear manufacturer based in Woolrich, Pa. Company officials
had promised to keep production in this country, but less than a
year after NAFTA went into effect, the temptation of Mexico
&thorn; where apparel workers earn on average $1 an hour &thorn;
apparently was too much to resist. The company laid off 450
workers in Pennsylvania and Colorado and hired Mexican
contractors. </p>
<p>Another company, Magnetek, which makes electronic equipment in
Huntington, Ind., and Owosso, Mich., moved 71 jobs to Matamoros,
Mexico, following the implementation of NAFTA, primarily because
of labor cost saving. Laid off U.S. workers who were asked to
train their replacements from Mexico found out that the same work
will now be done for one-tenth the cost to the employer. In the
past year, Magnetek dismissed older workers in two plants in
Mexico and replaced them with younger employees at half pay. </p>
<p>U.S.-based multinational companies from General Electric to
Nike still see vast opportunities emerging in Mexico. GE CEO Jack
Welch claimed in Business Week that he sees the future of his
company to be in Mexico. In 1994, GE&thorn;s Mexican plants
increased their sales about 18 percent, to more than $1 billion,
with about half of that total exported to the United States. GE
plans to invest even more in Mexico, especially to take advantage
of accelerated Mexican privatization in power generation,
transportation and finance. In fact, on Feb. 9, 1995, a
consortium led by GE was awarded the right to construct and lease
a 700-megawatt thermonuclear power plant in the state of
Chihuahua near El Paso, Texas. Nike is negotiating to make its
athletic shoes in Mexico for the Mexican, Latin American and U.S.
markets. Lower labor costs resulting from the peso&thorn;s plunge
are one attraction, Keith Peters, a Nike spokesman, told the New
York Times. &quot;Even if workers win some raises, companies
wanting to build Mexican plants to export still come out
ahead,&quot; the New York Times reported. &quot;Investment and
production costs have fallen while they can reap revenues in
dollars.&quot; </p>
<h4>Multinational Investment in Canada</h4>
<p>Since the implementation of NAFTA, a surge of investment is
linking corporations on both sides of the border as never before.
The change is driven in part by a cheap Canadian dollar, which
has plunged to just 70 cents, down from a high of 89 cents in
1989. In autos, for example, it has been reported by
Canada&thorn;s Motor Vehicle Association that it now costs 20 to
25 percent less to assemble a car in Canada than in the United
States. </p>
<p>Such savings have the Big Three automakers investing billions
of dollars in Canadian production facilities. Ford Motor Co. of
Canada has spent more than $700 million to revamp its plant in
Oakville, Ontario, to produce Windstar minivans. Ford also is
spending an additional $1.5 billion to upgrade its Ontario truck
and engine plants. Because of similar investments, Chrysler
Canada Ltd. last year produced approximately half of the minivans
and most of the popular LH models. </p>
<p>The advantages of producing in Canada and exporting to the
United States have not been lost on other foreign auto
manufacturers. Toyota is spending $427 million to more than
double the capacity of its Corolla assembly line near Cambridge,
Ontario, to 200,000 cars a year. All the extra cars will be
exported to the United States. </p>
<p>Much of the large trade imbalance with Canada consists of auto
trade. In 1994, Canada exported 2.1 million new cars and trucks
to the United States, while only 808,000 new cars and trucks went
in the other direction. </p>
<h4>Exchange Rates: Peso Meltdown</h4>
<p>One of the many deficiencies of NAFTA is that the agreement
specifically excludes exchange rate policies from coverage. The
peso became grossly overvalued in large part because it was
effectively pegged against the dollar even as Mexican rates of
inflation were much higher than rates of inflation in the United
States. Thus, while the real value of the peso declined relative
to the dollar, Mexican government policy did not allow this to be
reflected in the official exchange rate. The overvalued peso
contributed to a surge in imports to Mexico, by making them
artificially inexpensive, and contributed to a current account
deficit for Mexico in excess of $29 billion in 1994. In testimony
before Congress nine months prior to the implementation of NAFTA,
the AFL-CIO warned that, &quot;the recent history of Mexican
exchange rate policy, together with economic pressure, suggests
that devaluation is inevitable.&quot; </p>
<h4>Competitive Peso Devaluation</h4>
<p>Former President Carlos Salinas, who was competing to become
director of the World Trade Organization even before he left
office, maintained an overvalued peso because he figured that to
devalue the peso was to devalue his presidency. In an effort to
prop up the peso, Mexico&thorn;s foreign capital reserves, which
stood at $28 billion less than a year ago, were drawn down by the
Salinas administration to below $7 billion in order to buy pesos
to keep their value artificially high. According to MIT Professor
Rudi Dornbusch, &thorn;Salinas persevered with his strategy of
politics first, reality later, and the peso remained disastrously
overvalued.&quot; </p>
<p>In January 1994, at the start of NAFTA, the peso was trading
at 3.1 pesos to the dollar. The peso devaluation continued slowly
through the first three-quarters of 1994, by approximately 11
percent to 3.45 pesos to the dollar. In December 1994, the
administration of incoming President Zedillo finally initiated a
long-overdue devaluation of the peso. The situation quickly got
out of control and the peso could not be supported, forcing
Mexico to allow the peso to freely float in value relative to the
dollar. By mid-January in 1995, the value of the peso had fallen
to 5.7 pesos to the dollar, a drop of approximately 50 percent in
the first year of NAFTA. </p>
<p>The 1994 Mexican current account deficit of $31 billion was
made up of payments on foreign debt and an imbalance in trade in
goods and services, including $1.9 billion with the United
States. Current account deficits must be matched by capital
inflows, but Mexico was relying on short-term financial
instruments &thorn; stocks and mutual fund investments, and
government bonds &thorn; to finance the deficit. Even if Mexico
is able to cut the current account deficit by half, the
government still will need to attract more than $15 billion in
new capital annually. Part of the Zedillo rescue plan is designed
to keep that capital flowing in. </p>
<p>An important component of the Mexican financial crisis was the
capital flight by wealthy Mexicans &thorn; a move to quality,
lower-risk investment. In order to discourage further capital
flight, interest rates in Mexico have risen to more than 30
percent, thus reducing the chances for a quick economic recovery.
Most analysts foresee zero or negative economic growth, probably
in the range of -1.5 percent to -5 percent for 1995. </p>
<p>In order to shore-up confidence in the peso, the Clinton
administration initially pledged $9 billion out of a total $18
billion relief package. If the high-risk Zedillo restructuring
plan fails, &quot;the markets will blow right by the first $18
billion as if it were a rounding error,&quot; claimed a banker.
The administration then proposed an additional $40 billion in
loan guarantees to restore confidence in the Mexican financial
system. </p>
<p>When the Congress balked, the administration committed $20
billion from the U.S. Exchange Stabilization Fund as part of a
total international package of $53 billion in an attempt to
provide a credible aid package. In effect, the U.S. Treasury, the
International Monetary Fund, the Bank for International
Settlements of Switzerland, commercial banks, Latin American
countries and Canada are providing protection for speculative
investors who placed more than $75 billion in Mexico without due
regard for the risks involved. </p>
<p>To secure the U.S. loans, the Mexicans agreed to collateral
terms requiring importers of Mexican crude oil, oil products and
petrochemicals to remit payments to a special Mexican account at
the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. In the event of default,
the United States would hold the money there. </p>
<p>The terms of the U.S. rescue match those demanded by the
International Monetary Fund and will reinforce already tough
conditions. Among the main conditions: </p>
<ul>
    <li>Mexico must limit credit expansion to 10 billion pesos
        for all of 1995. </li>
    <li>Mexico must try to limit money growth to less than the
        rate of inflation. </li>
    <li>Mexico must maintain &quot;substantially positive&quot;
        real interest rates. </li>
    <li>Mexico should raise $12 billion to $14 billion through
        privatizations and concession operations over the next
        three years. </li>
    <li>Mexico must increase the transparency of central bank and
        government actions by publishing timely financial
        statistics. </li>
    <li>Economic Fundamentals Are Not Good </li>
</ul>
<p>Despite the reassuring rhetoric of the Clinton administration,
substantial risk exists that some of the loans to Mexico will
fail. If oil imports from Mexico are insufficient, U.S. taxpayers
will be forced to pick up the tab for Mexico should that
government not be able to fulfill its financial obligations. The
freely floating peso will be stabilized only to the extent that
capital flows can be attracted back to Mexico, and the current
account deficit reduced. </p>
<p>The notion that the peso &quot;meltdown&quot; is just a blip
on the radar screen is evidence of the type of wishful thinking
that led to the crisis in the first place. This is akin to the
captain of the Titanic announcing, &quot;it&thorn;s OK,
we&thorn;re only stopping for ice.&quot; For the administration
to repeat the unfounded assertion that &quot;fundamentals in
Mexico are good&quot; is a prescription for further disaster.
Fundamentals in Mexico are NOT good. As Dornbusch states,
&quot;the myth of the superperforming Mexican economy was kept
alive.&quot; When evaluated against real measures of sustainable
development &thorn; jobs creation, real wage increases and more
equal income distribution -the Salinas reforms were a dismal
failure. Job growth was not adequate to meet the needs of the one
million people who enter the work force each year and growing
income inequality makes Mexican society increasingly unstable. </p>
<p>According to data from Mexican income-expenditure surveys, the
number of workers per family in Mexico rose from 1.49 in 1977 to
1.63 in 1992, during a period in which the number of people in
poverty continued to rise. Income inequality actually worsened
during the supposed &quot;economic miracle&quot; of the Salinas
administration. Between 1989 and 1992, the mean income of
families within the lowest income group fell by 7 percent, while
the incomes of families at the top of the income pyramid grew by
11 percent. The top 10 percent of Mexicans earn as much as the
bottom 70 percent. The poverty rate in Mexico is approximately 40
percent and the unemployment rate in excess of 20 percent.
Two-thirds of Mexican workers are either unemployed or make less
than $10 a day, when the cost of basic subsistence for a typical
family of 5 is now approximately $16 a day. </p>
<p>By 1992, the richest 20 percent of the population received
54.2 percent of national income, while the poorest 20 percent
received only 4.3 percent. The extreme concentration of wealth in
Mexico is perhaps best illustrated by looking at its wealthiest
person, Carlos Slim Helu, owner of Telefonos de Mexico &thorn;
identified by Forbes to be worth $6.6 billion. Slim&thorn;s net
worth is more than the annual income of the poorest 17 million
combined. Forbes also claims that Slim is one of 30 billionaires
in Mexico &thorn; a number exceeded by only the United States,
Japan and Germany. </p>
<p>For the majority of Mexican workers, the only relevant
indicator of changes in the standard of living is wages in pesos
after adjusting for inflation. The Bureau of Labor Statistics
publishes annual international comparisons of hourly compensation
costs &thorn; wages and fringe benefits &thorn; converted into
real (inflation-adjusted) pesos by using the Mexican consumer
price indices from the IMF &quot;International Financial
Statistics.&quot; </p>
<p>The results of converting Mexican hourly compensation into
real 1988 pesos show that real compensation fell 43 percent
between 1980 and 1988. Although real compensation for Mexican
workers has improved somewhat since 1988, by 1993, real
compensation remained 30 percent lower than it was in 1980.
Harley Shaiken, a professor at the University of California at
Berkeley, has shown that between 1980 and 1994, when real
compensation was falling in Mexico, manufacturing worker
productivity rose by 64 percent. </p>
<h3>Effects of Devaluation</h3>
<h4>Change in the Balance of Trade with Mexico</h4>
<p>As a consequence of the peso devaluation, the price of
U.S.-made products purchased with pesos will rise, slowing down
U.S. exports to Mexico and, thus, eliminating thousands of jobs
in U.S. export industries. At the same time, since goods made in
Mexico are now cheaper in dollars, imports from Mexico will
increase, and the balance of trade with Mexico will turn to a
trade deficit. When added to the large and growing U.S. trade
deficit with Canada (caused in part by a devaluation of the
Canadian dollar to a nine-year low), the Mexican trade deficit
will only add to this country&thorn;s enormous overall trade
imbalance. </p>
<p>A crucial element of the Zedillo recovery plan is to cut the
current account deficit in half by both increasing exports to the
United States and by drastically reducing imports from the United
States. This means that U.S. exporters to Mexico should
anticipate increased use of informal barriers to trade to limit
imports from the United States. Along with the peso devaluation,
these measures mean that the U.S. trade balance with Mexico will
go into a substantial deficit position for the foreseeable
future. But Mexico&thorn;s attempt to export its way to economic
recovery will be made all the more difficult because the peso
devaluation has made the importation of capital equipment to
modernize Mexican factories much more expensive. Lacking access
to U.S. capital markets, Mexican firms will be forced to enter
into joint ventures with U.S. firms if they wish to modernize in
order to export. </p>
<h4>Production Costs in Mexico Lowered</h4>
<p>The peso devaluation reduces the cost of producing in Mexico
relative to producing in the United States. Purchases of land,
manufacturing plants and equipment that are denominated in pesos
are now cheaper. The key factor of labor costs has decreased
relative to labor costs in the United States. At the new exchange
rate, the Mexican real hourly compensation for production workers
in manufacturing would be only about one-twelfth of that of the
United States. &quot;This devaluation gives us a competitive
edge,&quot; says Carlos Slim Helu, whose Grupo Carso conglomerate
exports everything from copper tubing to auto parts. For
maquiladora employers, the $80 average weekly compensation to a
Mexican worker would be reduced to $50. The decrease in overall
costs of producing in Mexico will provide added incentive for
U.S. multinational corporations to relocate their manufacturing
operations south of the border. It also is possible that Mexico
will provide incentives in addition to cheaper currency to
attract more factories. </p>
<p>To Chrysler and others, the devaluation could make Mexico a
much more attractive place to manufacture &thorn; as long as the
cost of local inputs such as labor outweigh the price of imported
components. Lower labor costs will &quot;flow right through to
the bottom line,&quot; says Chrysler President Robert A. Lutz.
&thorn; Business Week, Jan. 16, 1995 </p>
<h4>Dislocated Workers</h4>
<p>For U.S. workers, especially in manufacturing industries,
devaluation can only mean the loss of more jobs. Following the
crisis of 1982, the dramatic devaluations of the peso contributed
directly to the surge in foreign investment in Mexico that
resulted in the maquiladora program. This &quot;free trade&quot;
zone along the Mexican side of the border now consists of
approximately 2,140 factories employing 600,000 workers whose
jobs should have been in the United States. Combining &quot;free
trade&quot; agreements and currency realignment will produce a
double-whammy for workers in the United States. </p>
<p>For the U.S. worker whose job moves to Mexico, it is unlikely
that he or she will find employment opportunities that pay wages
and benefits anywhere near the level paid by the job lost.
Manufacturing workers who lose their jobs to Mexico, especially
those with years of seniority, inevitably will encounter severe
economic hardship and a reduction in the standard of living for
their families. </p>
<p>Zenith Corp., one of the most prominent members of the
pro-NAFTA, corporate lobbying group, USA*NAFTA, has been one of
the largest exporters of jobs to Mexico over the past decade. On
Feb. 24, 1995, Zenith closed forever the doors of a television
plant in Springfield, Mo., that once employed more than 4,000
workers. It was a sorry ending to years of uncertainty and deceit
endured by workers, who in 1987 agreed to a 8.2 percent wage cut
and a five-year contract extension with the understanding that
they might otherwise lose their jobs to Mexico. In a 1991 letter
to employees announcing a &quot;consolidation&quot; of operations
that resulted in a 75 percent reduction in the workforce, Zenith
still maintained that &quot;there is a future in
Springfield.&quot; &quot;The story going round the plant was, if
you didn&thorn;t give them wage concessions, they were going to
move to Mexico,&quot; said Lionel Hudspeth, a line inspector and
relief operator until his 25-year career at Zenith ended in May
1992. </p>
<p>Michael Yeubanks, business manager of Electrical Workers Local
1453, noted that although unemployment is low in the region,
workers who find new jobs can expect entry-level wages and a
sharp reduction in benefits. &quot;They all have to start at the
bottom again,&quot; he said. Some of the last workers at the
Springfield plant, about 430 cabinet molders, were certified by
the Department of Labor in November as eligible for trade
adjustment assistance as a result of a shift of production to
Mexico. </p>
<p>Sportswear manufacturer, Woolrich, is another company that
moved production to Mexico in 1994. Fairy Jean Breining, a
laid-off veteran of 24 years, qualifies for a government
retraining program. But she is 59 and claims, &quot;I don&thorn;t
see any point in signing up for retraining, since no one&thorn;s
going to hire a woman my wage anyway.&quot; </p>
<h4>Wage Effect</h4>
<p>Another major effect of the peso devaluation &thorn; one that
will impact on the majority of U.S. workers &thorn; is the
additional downward pressure on U.S. wages as a result of the
reduced wages in Mexico. As a result of NAFTA, U.S. manufacturing
workers are now integrated in a North American work force that
includes workers in Mexico whose average hourly compensation in
manufacturing has been reduced to approximately $1.80 (only $1.15
in the U.S.-dominated maquiladoras) following the peso
devaluation. The average hourly compensation in U.S.
manufacturing in 1993 was $16.79. The relative cheapening of
Mexican labor through the peso devaluation will put added
downward pressure on real wages in United States. </p>
<p>An employer&thorn;s threat to move to Mexico must be taken
seriously by workers during collective bargaining. A prime
example of the downward pressure on wages can be seen in the
contract settlement at Leviton, a Warwick, R.I., manufacturer of
electrical outlets. To avoid losing their jobs to Mexico, IBEW
members voted to accept a laundry list of concessions in a
contract that was settled in August 1994. Mindful that Leviton
already has two Mexican factories, in Tijuana and Tecate, the
workers voted to extend their contract for two years, accept a
wage freeze and work 12-hour shifts at straight time. An employee
accompanied by his child said, &quot;you have no choice if you
have kids; they have to eat.&quot; </p>
<h4>Mexican Workers</h4>
<p>The devalued peso will increase the price of U.S.-made
products beyond the reach of millions of Mexican consumers.
Simple subsistence will be hard for Mexican workers, who clearly
will bear the brunt of the crisis. The &quot;economic emergency
plan&quot; implemented in January failed to restrain inflation or
halt Mexico&thorn;s currency collapse. The new plan of economic
austerity announced March 9, 1995, sets a target inflation rate
of 42 percent and allows labor unions to freely negotiate wage
contracts individually with each employer. This arrangement will
result in substantial reductions in real wages for Mexican
workers. Once again, following 10 long years of austerity,
Mexican workers are being forced to bear the burden of failed
economic programs. </p>
<p>&quot;Business is grinding to a halt as expectations of a
severe recession begin to bite,&quot; Business Week reported Feb.
27, 1995. &quot;Construction is dead. New-truck sales plunged by
86 percent in January, and bus sales fell by 66 percent.
Mercedes-Benz shut its two plants for three weeks in January, and
Grupo Dina plans to shut down truck production for 60 days.&quot;
The magazine quoted Sergio Raimond-Kedihas, dean of
Mexico&thorn;s leading business school, as saying, &quot;We are
on the verge of seeing the economy explode into pieces.&quot; </p>
<p>A Mexican government official admitted, &quot;we are in
trouble,&quot; the Washington Post reported Feb. 28. Since the
devaluation, inflation has skyrocketed to an annualized rate
exceeding 60 percent while the nation&thorn;s biggest industrial
association reported a loss of 250,000 jobs in less than two
months. </p>
<h4>Maquiladora Windfall</h4>
<p>Because of the devalued peso, U.S. employers in the Mexican
maquilas will realize an annual windfall of more than $750
million, while their employees, whose earnings are far below
those of other Mexican production workers, endure even more
hardship. At the very least, these U.S. companies should reject
this windfall and return it to the poorest of Mexican workers by
increasing their wages to compensate for their decline in real
wages. </p>
<p>The question of currency devaluation must be examined in light
of both political and economic factors. NAFTA represents a
never-before tried, high-risk experiment in which two countries
at far different stages of economic development and democratic
rights are attempting to merge their economies. The danger in a
&quot;competitive&quot; peso devaluation lies in the inherent
downward pressure on wages for workers in both countries and
additional incentives for U.S. companies to relocate to Mexico.
The combination of peso devaluation and NAFTA will be detrimental
to the interests of workers on both sides of the border. </p>
<h3>NAFTA Transitional Adjustment Assistance Program</h3>
<h4>Background</h4>
<p>The NAFTA-TAA Bridge Program was set up to provide training,
reemployment services and income support for workers dislocated
because of open trade with Mexico and Canada. The process for
establishing eligibility and delivering assistance involves close
working partnership between the Department of Labor and state
governors&thorn; offices. </p>
<p>A petition first is filed with the governor&thorn;s office,
which makes preliminary findings and transmits the findings to
DOL within 10 days. DOL makes the final determination on
certification within 30 days of receipt of the governor&thorn;s
findings. </p>
<p>NAFTA-TAA covers workers directly affected by trade with
Canada and Mexico, as well as workers at companies indirectly
affected, such as suppliers and assemblers for directly affected
firms. </p>
<p>If DOL certifies the petition, workers are entitled to
employment services; training for a new occupation; income
support for up to 52 weeks after unemployment insurance is
exhausted, if the worker is enrolled in training; and job search
and relocation allowances. Unlike regular TAA, waivers of the
training requirement are NOT allowed under <strong>NAFTA-TAA.</strong> </p>
<h4>Petition Activity</h4>
<p>The Labor Department as of Jan. 3, 1995, had made decisions on
297 of 321 petitions it had received covering 34,799 laid-off
workers. It had certified 152 for assistance and denied 145. The
152 certifications covered 17,320 workers. </p>
<p>Of the 152 certifications, 99 were from companies employing
11,589 workers who lost their jobs because of trade with Mexico.
Out of the Mexico total, 75 firms covering 8,261 workers received
certification because of a shift of production. Another 24 firms
covering 3,328 workers were certified because they were adversely
affected (lost their jobs) by imports. </p>
<p>A total of 47 firms involving 4,505 workers were certified
because of trade with Canada. Of the Canadian total, 22 firms
covering 2,457 workers were certified because of a shift of
production. The remaining 25 firms covering 2,048 workers were
adversely affected by imports. </p>
<p>Seventy-two of the 145 denials were attributed to the fact
that there was no shift in production or that company imports
were insignificant. The reason cited for denials in 25 cases was
that workers did not produce a particular good, while in 20 cases
the reason for denial was that production was transferred
domestically. During the first year of operation, the DOL
received petitions covering workers in 41 states. Pennsylvania
had the most petitions filed (39), followed by New York (31),
Washington (30), Texas (24), California (17), Tennessee (15),
Georgia (14) and New Jersey (12). </p>
<p>Since more than half the petitions originated in just seven
states, there is reason to believe there are serious problems
with information and outreach. In some states, petition forms are
not on hand in Employment Service offices despite the clear and
legal requirement that they be available; posters describing the
program are not on the walls; state officials staffing the state
offices are not even aware that the NAFTA-TAA program exists. </p>
<p>There are other reasons to believe that the number of
petitions and certifications may be just the tip of the iceberg.
Meritorious petitions are being denied. Service workers such as
truck drivers and railroad workers are ineligible. The rigid
deadline for enrolling in training is preventing qualified
workers from receiving assistance. The design and structure of
the program for indirectly affected workers is needlessly
cumbersome. Because the program is so inadequate, several unions
have recommended that petitions be filed for regular TAA instead
of <strong>NAFTA-TAA.</strong> </p>
<h4>General Accounting Office Report</h4>
<p>In November 1994, the GAO issued a report on the first nine
months of operation of the NAFTA-TAA program. The GAO noted the
Department of Labor had addressed a number of shortcomings of the
program, including the time frame for determinations. </p>
<p>The report also pointed out that DOL had broadened the
NAFTA-TAA program&thorn;s eligibility requirements to include
secondary workers (those who are indirectly affected), had
provided limited guidance to go along with a slow and cumbersome
funding mechanism that may make it difficult for workers to gain
benefits. In addition, since NAFTA-TAA eliminates waivers and
requires workers to enroll in training, these restrictions have
resulted in some workers receiving incomplete assessments and
remedial assistance, and a limited mix of services. </p>
<p>Finally, in implementing NAFTA-TAA, DOL did not address other
shortcomings, such as the lack of ongoing support, follow-up and
performance monitoring. While DOL has encouraged closer
coordination between federal dislocated worker programs, it has
not formally required states to track participants. </p>
<h4>A Worker's Guide to the NAFTA TAA Program</h4>
<p>A worker who has lost his or her job since NAFTA began or
anticipates job dislocation and is in need of detailed
information on the procedures of the NAFTA- specific Transitional
Adjustment Program should request the Workers Guide to the NAFTA
TAA Program from the AFL-CIO Human Resources Development
Institute, 815 16th St. N.W., Washington, D.C. 20006. Phone
202/638-3912. </p>
<h4>Labor Supplemental Agreement</h4>
<p>The North American Agreement on Labor Cooperation (NAALC),
signed as part of the NAFTA, establishes a number of structures
to monitor labor issues in North America, as well as to address
complaints about the non-enforcement of labor law in any of the
three NAFTA countries. These structures, which have been formed
very slowly, do not have any enforcement powers or mechanisms. </p>
<p>The agreement establishes a commission for labor cooperation
that consists of a Ministerial Council to meet at least once a
year and a Secretariat to assist and provide technical support to
the council. The Secretariat, recently established and located in
Dallas, is by agreement directed by a Canadian national who will
appoint a staff of 15. </p>
<p>John S. McKennirey, who was Canada&thorn;s lead negotiator for
the labor side agreement and director general of staff relations
and compensation at Canada&thorn;s Department of National
Revenue, recently was named the executive director of the
Secretariat for a three-year term. McKennirey is expected to have
the Secretariat up and running by mid-April. Among other things,
the Secretariat will prepare background reports on labor law,
labor market conditions and training issues of the three
countries, and undertake studies on a wide range of labor issues. </p>
<p>The agreement also calls upon each country to establish a
National Administrative Office (NAO) to serve as a contact point
for the other countries, to receive submissions from the public
on labor law matters and to coordinate tri- national labor
cooperative activities. The U.S. NAO, housed in the Department of
Labor and directed by Irasema T. Garza, can be phoned at
202/501-6653 and FAXed at 202/501-6615. </p>
<h4>Honeywell and GE</h4>
<p>The NAO in 1994 accepted complaints from the Teamsters on
labor law violations at a Honeywell plant in Chihuahua, and the
unaffiliated United Electrical Workers on violations at a GE
facility in Juarez. Public hearings on these submissions took
place in Washington, D.C., on Sept. 12, 1994. </p>
<p>The NAO issued a Public Report of Review on the submissions on
Oct. 12, 1994, concluding that the information gathered on the
two submissions did not establish that the Government of Mexico
failed to promote compliance with or enforce the specific laws
involved. Accordingly, the NAO did not recommend ministerial
consultations on the matters presented in these two submissions
and essentially threw out the two complaints over the firing of
maquila workers for union organizing efforts. </p>
<p>However, the NAO did acknowledge the strong concerns raised by
these submissions, the vital importance of the freedom of
association and the right to organize, and the implications for
workers of the failure of governments to protect such rights. </p>
<h4>Sony</h4>
<p>A complaint filed with the NAO by the International Labor
Rights Education and Research Fund, the National Association of
Democratic Lawyers, the Coalition for Justice in the Maquiladoras
and the American Friends Service Committee charged that a
subsidiary of Sony Corporation stifled union organizing in its
plants in Nuevo Laredo. &quot;What happened to us was very
unfair,&quot; said Rosa Huerta, one of about a dozen workers from
Sony&thorn;s Magnetico de Mexico plants testifying at the NAO
hearing in San Antonio, Feb. 14, 1995. </p>
<p>The workers testified they were prevented from meeting to
discuss union leadership, given less than a day&thorn;s notice
about a union election, were confronted by police during a
peaceful demonstration and, in some cases, fired after attempts
to organize. One worker said she was stripped of her union post
and ultimately forced to resign &thorn; she was told that if she
wouldn&thorn;t accept the resignation request and severance pay
(giving up her legal rights against the company), she would be
blacklisted by other maquiladora plants. </p>
<p>Another worker said a protest staged predominantly by female
workers was met with force. &quot;Without warning, the police
started to strike us with their sticks,&quot; she said, and one
woman was hospitalized. Sony did not register to speak at the
hearing, relying on private communique with the NAO. The NAO will
report its findings by April 11, 1995. </p>
<h4>Sprint</h4>
<p>A new twist to the NAFTA labor side agreement was added in
February 1995, when a Mexican trade union filed a complaint
against a U.S. corporation for violating the rights of U.S.
workers. The Union of Telephone Workers of the Republic of Mexico
has asked the Mexican NAO to investigate Sprint Corp. for closing
a San Francisco subsidiary targeted by a union campaign. </p>
<p>Francisco Hernandez Juarez, the Mexican union&thorn;s general
secretary, in his complaint, said that Sprint&thorn;s mass firing
of 235 Latino telemarketers in July 1994 occurred one week before
a representation vote by the Communications Workers. He asked the
Mexican NAO to declare that Sprint cannot establish itself in
Mexico until it reinstates the fired U.S. workers and agrees to
recognize workers in both countries when a majority of workers
vote to unionize. </p>
<p>Ed Potter, international labor council for the U.S. Council on
International Business, said the ability of Mexican and American
unions to use NAFTA procedures to &quot;create a public
spotlight&quot; is troubling to many executives. &quot;This
generally makes business pretty mad,&quot; he said. That is a
good summation of business cooperation under the NAFTA side
agreements. </p>
<p>The NAO also oversees a tri-national program on labor
cooperation. The AFL- CIO and its affiliated unions participated
in seminars on occupational health and safety in the electronics,
construction and petrochemical industries during 1994. </p>

<h1 align=center>Program Description </h1>
<p>Union Summer is the AFL-CIO's new program to bring hundreds of young workers and college 
students into the streets and neighborhoods this summer to work on union organizing campaigns 
and political initiatives. </p>
<p>Union Summer sites will be located around the country. Our program will reach out to low wage 
and young workers, recent immigrants, women and people of color - the new face of labor. We 
will hit neighborhoods and work sites across the land with the message that all working people 
deserve dignity on the job and a living wage. In the face of today's profit-crazed corporations, we 
will win these things only if everyone stands up and demands them in a strong, unified voice. Union 
Summer will help thousands of workers find that voice. </p>
<p>Applicants accepted for Union Summer will be assigned to a three week placement on an 
organizing campaign or political project in June, July, or August. They will be responsible for 
transportation to their assigned sites. Once there, they will receive training, free housing, and a 
stipend of $210 per week. Take a stand for social justice. <em>Get involved in Union Summer!</em> </p>

<title>Answers To Common Questions About Union Summer 1996</title>
<meta name="GENERATOR" content="Microsoft FrontPage 1.1">
</head>

<body>
<h1 align=center>Answers To Common Questions<br>
About Union Summer 1996</h1>
<ul>
<li><h2>What is Union Summer? </h2>
<p>Union Summer is a program of the AFL-CIO (American Federation of Labor and Congress 
of Industrial Organizations) designed to bring hundreds of young workers and college 
students into the streets and neighborhoods this summer to work on union organizing 
campaigns and political initiatives. Union Summer participants will intern for a three-week 
period. </p>
</li>
<li><h2>Why is Union Summer happening now? </h2>
<p>Our country is facing a serious crisis. The disparity between the rich and poor has hit 
Depression-era levels. For the first time, a generation of Americans is looking at having a 
lower standard of living than their parents had. In light of this trend, there is an increasing 
consensus across the United States that only a massive, activist, and visionary social 
movement for working people's rights will turn this country around. Historically, young 
people have played a pivotal role in sparking social change. The time has come to light that 
spark once again. </p>
</li>
<li><h2>What kind of qualifications do I need to participate in 
Union Summer? </h2>
<p>You need to be an energetic, passionate, people-oriented individual. You need to have a 
commitment to social justice. You do not need fancy qualifications. You do not need a 
college degree. And while it would certainly be a plus, no previous union experience is 
necessary. </p>
</li>
<li><h2>What am I going to be doing? </h2>
<p>The bulk of what you do will center around helping workers in their fight for workplace 
justice. You may be visiting workers at home to find out what they would like to change at 
their jobs. You may be organizing picket lines or participating in direct actions, such as 
marches and demonstrations.<br>
You may be rallying community support or helping a boycott campaign. You may be 
educating and registering voters around living wage campaigns. Whatever you do will help 
workers in their fight for workplace justice. </p>
</li>
<li><h2>Where is Union Summer going to take place? </h2>
</li>
<li>There will be multiple Union Summer sites around the country: the Deep South, California, 
the Midwest, and New England are some of the likely candidates. At this point, we cannot 
announce the specific locations because the targeted industries and corporations will use this 
advance notice to increase the level of harassment and intimidation of their employees. &#160;</li>
<li>&#160;</li>
<li><h2>Will I get paid? </h2>
</li>
<li>Union Summer is not a job. It is an educational internship designed to teach organizing skills 
and give participants a chance to practice those skills, to see people power in action - to 
help make history. That said, we realize that everyone has basic needs that must be met. 
Union Summer activists will receive free housing and a stipend of $210 per week to help 
defray other costs. </li>
<li>The AFL-CIO is strongly encouraging international unions, local unions, and central labor 
bodies to make it easier for their members or members' sons and daughters to participate by 
(1) paying for their transportation to and from the Union Summer site; and (2) reimbursing 
them for the difference between their regular wage and the Union Summer stipend. </li>
<li><h2>Can I choose where I go, and how will I get there? </h2>
<p>Union Summer staff will place people based on many factors, including location and the 
needs of particular campaigns. Many Union Summer activists will be assigned to the site 
nearest them. You can put in a request for a particular placement. However, there is no 
guarantee that you will get it. </p>
<p>Transportation to and from the campaign will be your responsibility. There is a lot of room 
for creativity. Some people are already talking about organizing caravans to their sites! </p>
</li>
<li><h2>How do I apply for Union Summer? </h2>

<h2 align="center">Answers to Common Questions about the AFL-CIO
Organizing Institute</h2>
<dl>
    <dd><font size="4">What is the Organizing Institute?</font></dd>
    <dd>The Organizing Institute was created in the fall of 1989
        to promote and foster union organizing. In November of
        that year, we held the first weekend training session for
        people interested in a career as union organizers. Since
        then, we have developed a highly selective program to
        recruit and train a new generation of union organizers,
        to place them for training on the campaigns of designated
        unions, and to facilitate job matches for graduates into
        full-time, paid positions as union organizers with
        International Unions affiliated with the AFL-CIO. In
        addition to this program, this Institute also has a
        variety of other programs designed to assist unions in
        the area of external organizing. </dd>
    <dd>&#160;</dd>
    <dd><font size="4">What does a Union Organizer do? </font></dd>
    <dd>Union organizers assist workers in gaining union
        recognition at their worksite. Where workers do not
        currently have a union, a union organizer will work with
        employees to build support and leadership to form their
        own local union, usually in the face of intense employer
        opposition. The union must prove it represents a majority
        and get recognition from the employer. This often, but
        not exclusively, happens through a secret ballot election
        held at the workplace. Ultimately, the goal is to win a
        binding agreement between the workers and their employer
        that includes real improvements in the living and working
        conditions of the employees.</dd>
    <dd>&#160;</dd>
    <dd><font size="4">What Unions are participation in the
        Organizing Institute training program?</font></dd>
    <dd>The following sixteen unions directly participate in the
        training program by providing intern and apprentice
        campaigns and hiring graduates: American Federation of
        State, County, and Municipal Employees (AFSCME),
        Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union (ACTWU),
        American Federation of Teachers (AFT), Communications
        Workers of America (CWA), Hotel Employees and Restaurant
        Employees (HERE), International Brotherhood of Teamsters
        (IBT), International Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's
        Union (ILWU), International Ladies Garment Workers Union
        (ILGWU), Service Employees International Union (SEIU),
        United Auto Workers (UAW), United Brotherhood of
        Carpenters and Joiners (UBC), United Food and Commercial
        Workers (UFCW), United Mineworkers of America (UMWA), and
        United Steelworkers of America (USWA), Laborers
        International Union of North America (LIUNA), and Oil,
        Chemical, and Atomic Workers (OCAW).</dd>
    <dd>&#160;</dd>
    <dd><font size="4">I'm interested in applying to the program.
        What is involved in the application process? </font></dd>
    <dd>All interested candidates must complete and return,
        either by mail, fax, our application, as well as submit a
        resume. (You can download an application at this web
        site.) We attempt to process and review applications
        within two to three weeks after receiving them. After
        careful review of the application, qualified applicants
        are contacted for either a face-to-face or telephone
        interview. All applicants are notified by telephone or
        letter if they have been accepted or not. This is an
        extremely selective program -- union organizing is a
        challenging job and is not for everyone. We accept
        applications until the Friday before the 3-day training
        you are considering attending. To guarantee that your
        application will be reviewed, it is suggested that we
        receive your application before that preceding Friday.</dd>
    <dd>&#160;</dd>
    <dd><font size="4">What do you look for in qualified
        applicants? </font></dd>
    <dd>We look for applicants possessing relevant skills and
        past experience. The best experience comes from having
        participated with a union in organizing campaigns.
        However, we do credit organizing experience in other
        fields, including union leadership, electoral
        campaigning, student government, issue organizing, or
        community service. Those applicants with no labor
        background should share the values and goals of the labor
        movement. We also judge applicants according to their
        communications skills, ability to motivate people,
        willingness to travel and/or relocate, and strategic
        thinking.</dd>
    <dd>&#160;</dd>
    <dd><font size="4">How often are the three-day training
        weekends held? </font></dd>
    <dd>The 3-day trainings are held each month in various
        locations. They are held every other month in Washington,
        D.C. and regularly in San Francisco. Other sites where we
        have held trainings include Chicago, Los Angeles, San
        Francisco, New York, and Atlanta.</dd>
    <dd>&#160;</dd>
    <dd><font size="4">What is the weekend session like? What are
        the costs? </font></dd>
    <dd>The 3-day training is an intense and fascinating look at
        what it takes to be a union organizer. The sessions
        themselves are lead by senior organizers from among the
        fourteen unions in the program. The talent and enthusiasm
        of the participants are a large part of the overall
        success of the weekend. Institute staff meet individually
        with participants on Sunday afternoon. The cost of the
        training, including housing and meals, are paid by the
        Organizing Institute. Travel to and from the training is
        the responsibility of the applicant.</dd>
    <dd>&#160;</dd>
    <dd><font size="4">I won't be able to start the internship
        for several months. Should I wait and apply when I'm
        available to intern? </font></dd>
    <dd>We recommend you apply when you are investigating career
        options, even if that is six or eight months before you
        are available to begin the internship, and even if it is
        before you are sure that this is the career for you. In
        fact, the 3-day training provides an excellent
        opportunity to find out more about union organizing to
        assist you in deciding if you want to pursue this
        program. If I am selected to go on the internship, how
        soon does it start? The next available internship usually
        begins a week or two after the training. If you are
        unable to begin the internship at that time, you may
        postpone. Although we encourage people to begin the
        internship as soon as possible, some people elect to
        begin the field training weeks or even months after
        attending a 3-day session.</dd>
    <dd>&#160;</dd>
    <dd><font size="4">What happens on the internship? </font></dd>
    <dd>The internship is usually 3 weeks long. We group together
        6 to 12 interns who have attended the 3-day training and
        assign them to an ongoing campaign with a participating
        union. The Institute and the Union assign staff to work
        with you on a daily basis. The intern's main
        responsibility is one on one communication with workers.
        This is done by visiting workers at home or at the
        workaday. The days are long; you're up early and often
        are in meetings until after 9pm. Some have called it
        &quot;boot camp&quot; or &quot;immersion training.&quot;
        You work 21 days in a row, with little time off.
        Internships tend to be on large, strategically important
        campaigns. Interns file weekly reports and supplement
        their field training with workshops and discussion
        groups.</dd>
    <dd>&#160;</dd>
    <dd><font size="4">What happens on the apprenticeship? </font></dd>
    <dd>If you are selected to go on the apprenticeship after the
        internship ends, you will be assigned to a campaign with
        one of the participating unions. As an apprentice, you
        are given responsibility for all or a major part of a
        campaign. You will work directly for a senior organizer,
        assigned by the Union, who will be your &quot;teaching
        fellow&quot;. Sometimes that person is on site and
        sometimes they are available by phone. Although you will
        fill out weekly reports and keep in contact with
        Institute staff by phone, your primary training will come
        from this experienced organizer.</dd>
    <dd>&#160;</dd>
    <dd><font size="4">How does the pay work on the
        apprenticeship? </font></dd>
    <dd>As an apprentice you are paid $400 per week on a biweekly
        basis by the Organizing Institute. You are covered for
        individual health insurance. The Institute is then
        reimbursed by the Union to whom you are assigned. The
        Union is responsible for housing and transportation and a
        meal allowance. The amount of that allowance is
        determined by the Union in accordance with their
        policies.</dd>
    <dd>&#160;</dd>
    <dd><font size="4">How does job placement work? </font></dd>
    <dd>The Unions have told us that they are in need of talented
        and committed organizers to wage the battle for union
        recognition. Our track record on job matches for
        graduates bears out this claim. Over 95% of Institute
        graduates have been placed. The unions in the program are
        notified of all graduates. They then contact the
        apprentice to arrange interviews. You should notify the
        Institute if you have any preferences in selecting a
        position. This program works because it is directly
        linked to employment opportunities in union organizing.
        Unions and applicants alike are interested in the program
        because of the job match component.</dd>
    <dd>&#160;</dd>
    <dd><font size="4">How much travel is involved? What is the
        pay? </font></dd>
    <dd>The jobs vary by union and by location within a union.
        However, most jobs require the organizer to be available
        to work on the road at times, and in some jobs the
        organizer will work away from home most of the time. Even
        when working from home, long days, including regular
        evening and weekend work, is standard. Most unions look
        for flexibility in travel and relocation. The pay ranges
        from $18,000 to $30,000 per year plus benefits.</dd>
    <dd>&#160;</dd>
    <dd><font size="4">I am interested in a job in the labor
        movement, but not organizing, can the Organizing
        Institute help me? </font></dd>
    <dd>We are a very single purpose organization. We are looking
        for people to do one particular job - Organize the
        Unorganized. That means that we rarely hear about and
        don't usually recommend people for other types of careers
        in the labor movement. If you are not sure if union
        organizing is for you, by all means apply and pursue this
        program as one option. </dd>

<title>Stand UP for Good Jobs</title>
<meta name="GENERATOR" content="Microsoft FrontPage 1.1">
<meta name="FORMATTER" content="Microsoft FrontPage 1.1">
</head>
<body>
<h1 align="center">America Needs Good Jobs</h1>
<h3>The Current Situation</h3>
<p>During the past two years, the American economy has created
5,700,000 new jobs. This is especially welcome since only 2.2
million jobs were created in the entire four years of the Bush
Administration. </p>
<p>But much more remains to be done. </p>
<p>The unemployment rate is still 5.4 percent, which means that
officially 7.2 million workers are looking for jobs. But, in
addition, there are 1.7 million Americans who have become so
discouraged that they are no longer looking for work and
therefore are not included in the unemployment figure. And there
are 4.5 million additional workers who want full-time jobs but
cannot find them and therefore are working only part-time. In
total, then, 13.4 million workers are unemployed or
underemployed. </p>
<p>Most troubling of all, the United States continues to lose
many of our best jobs and replace them with low-wage, part-time
or temporary jobs. Fully 20% of all new jobs are temporary. More
workers today are employed by fast food restaurants than in the
steel and auto industries combined, and the largest single
employer in the U.S. is Manpower Inc., a temporary help agency,
which now employs almost twice as many people as General Motors. </p>
<h3>What Should Be Done</h3>
<p>We cannot hope to create enough good, middle-class jobs unless
the government does its part. The Clinton Administration has put
forward a modest program to increase investments in
transportation, communication, new technology and in our current
and future workers. Those investments can be paid for by ending
corporate welfare, closing tax loopholes and requiring
corporations to pay their fair share of taxes. The government
should stop giving tax breaks to companies that move jobs
overseas, and should protect our markets from unfair competition. </p>
<h3>The New Leadership's Agenda</h3>
<p>The new Congress has no program to help create good jobs.
Instead, they are proposing to slash and burn programs that are
vital to job creation. </p>
<h4>Look at what they are doing:</h4>
<p>The House of Representatives already has passed a bill that
cuts spending this year by more than $17 billion. These cuts will
have their most severe impact on low-income elderly households
and on poor children. But the cuts will also directly affect our
ability to provide good jobs to working families. Indeed, 25
percent of the cuts are made in job training and employment
programs and education programs. These cuts include the
elimination of 615,000 summer jobs for youth, almost 200,000
slots for job training, and more than 50,000 slots for dislocated
workers. </p>
<p>The House leaders are pushing tax cuts that benefit
corporations and families earning more than $200,000. To pay for
these, they plan to take billions more away from employment and
job training programs, education programs, and from
vitally-needed investments in transportation and new technology. </p>
<p>They plan $1.2 trillion in additional cuts that will destroy
the government's ability to create the conditions necessary for
developing good jobs. </p>
<p>Most Republicans and some Democrats want to make it even
easier to flood the American market with imports made in
sweatshops, in prison camps, and by child labor earning just a
few dollars a day. They believe that we should let other
countries sell their goods in the United States even if those
countries have an unfair advantage because they exploit their own
workers. </p>
<h3>What This Means To You</h3>
<p>If these proposals are not stopped now, jobs will be lost in
manufacturing, construction, transportation, communication, and
in public service. There will be fewer opportunities for workers
to upgrade skills and fewer opportunities for retraining if you
lose your job. And your kids will have a harder time getting the
education and skills they will need and finding a good job to
support their families. </p>
<p>That's why their agenda must be blocked.</p>

<title>Stand UP for Good Wages</title>
<meta name="GENERATOR" content="Microsoft FrontPage 1.1">
<meta name="FORMATTER" content="Microsoft FrontPage 1.1">
</head>
<body>
<h1 align="center">America Needs Good Wages</h1>
<h3>The Current Situation</h3>
<p>Working men and women are working harder and harder for less.
Since 1979, the average hourly pay for non-supervisory workers
has declined by 10 percent. For workers who never completed high
school, average pay dropped by more than 20 percent. </p>
<p>Younger workers face a particularly difficult time. For
workers without college degrees, entry-level wages are now $6.61
an hour and that provides 25 percent less buying power than in
1979. Even for college graduates, entry-level wages have
declined. As a result, the typical head of household under age 25
now earns just $16,000, a third less buying power than in 1979. </p>
<p>All this is happening while productivity is increasing and
profits are swelling. And all this is happening at the same time
that the incomes of the richest one percent of the population
have increased by 53 percent while incomes of most Americans have
fallen. </p>
<h3>What Should Be Done</h3>
<p>The federal government can play an important part in helping
to improve wages by increasing the floor established by the
minimum wage as President Clinton has proposed. The government
also can make sure that employers who replace full- time workers
with part-time, temporary or contract workers or who try to get
rid of their union workers not realize a competitive advantage. </p>
<h3>The New Leadership's Agenda</h3>
<p>The Republican leadership has no program to raise wages or to
reduce the increasing wage gap. They have even called for
elimination of the minimum wage. They believe in what they call a
&quot;free market&quot; in which workers compete with each other
for work so the jobs go to those willing to accept the least.
That means that those who are most desperate, and least
demanding, would set labor standards for all. In fact, this
program would drive down wages. </p>
<h4>Here is what they propose:</h4>
<p><b>Davis-Bacon</b> </p>
<p>The Republican leaders are pushing bills in both the House
(H.R. 500) and the Senate (S. 141) to repeal the Davis-Bacon Act.
That Act says that when construction is done for the federal
government, the construction workers are entitled to be paid the
usual wage paid in their community for that kind of work. The law
stabilizes wage standards in the community by denying any
competitive advantage to contractors who find or import cheap
labor. </p>
<p>If the Davis-Bacon Act were repealed, the federal government
could be forced to hire contractors who pay the cheapest wages,
and that would lower wages for everyone in the industry. In fact,
studies show that the average construction worker would lose
about $1,500 a year if the Davis- Bacon Act were repealed. </p>
<p><b>Service Contract Act</b> </p>
<p>The House Republicans are also pushing a bill (H.R. 246) to
repeal the Service Contract Act. That law requires contractors
who provide services to the federal government for example, firms
that run cafeterias in federal buildings or provide janitors or
guards for federal buildings to pay their employees the
prevailing wage for the kind of work the employees do. </p>
<p>Most of the 1,000,000 employees covered by this law don't earn
much money as it is, but repeal of the Service Contract Act would
push their wages down toward the minimum wage. </p>
<p><b>Minimum Wage</b> </p>
<p>Congress is fighting President Clintons proposal to increase
the minimum wage from $4.25 to $5.15 by 1997. Since 1979, the
real value of the minimum wage has fallen by more than 25 percent
because of increases in the cost of living. Today, 2.1 million
workers earn the minimum wage, and 4.4 million more earn less
than $5.15 and would get an increase if the minimum wage were
increased. At the current minimum wage level, these workers can't
earn enough to support their families. </p>
<p><b>Overtime Pay</b> </p>
<p>The new leaders in Congress want to do away with the 40-hour
workweek. Since 1935, workers who work more than 40 hours in a
week have been entitled to overtime pay. But most Republicans and
the Democrats who vote with them think that employers should be
allowed flexibility to require their employees to work more than
40 hours in one week and less in another without having to pay
overtime. </p>
<p>They also believe that it should be up to the employer to
decide whether to pay overtime or to give the employees
compensatory time off instead. And they want to expand the group
of employees who are denied any right to overtime or compensatory
time off no matter how long they work. </p>
<p><b>Social Security</b> </p>
<p>The House and Senate voted to allow Social Security trust
funds to be used to balance the budget rather than preserving
those funds to pay Social Security in the future.Republican
leaders also are planning to cut billions of dollars from
Medicare, which will leave seniors without adequate protection
and shift health care costs to private employers and employees. </p>
<p><b>Transportation Employees</b> </p>
<p>The new leaders in Congress are taking special aim at programs
that protect transportation workers. For more than 30 years,
transit employees have been assured that federal grants to
transit agencies will not be used to reduce the pay, benefits or
rights of transit employees. The extermists want to strip away
this protection. They also want to take from rail employees their
right to severance pay if they are laid off because a route is
terminated. </p>
<h3>What This Means To You</h3>
<p>If the new leaders in Congress are not stopped now, 60 years
of laws protecting workers will be discarded. Some of the
Republican proposals will hit hardest at workers in particular
industries construction, service and transportation although the
loss of income for these workers will hurt everyone in the
communities in which they live. </p>
<p>Other proposals, such as the plan to repeal the 40-hour work
week, will directly affect every working family. Workers will no
longer be able to count on regular schedules, and may be forced
to work excessive hours. Family lives will be disrupted as the
work schedules of parents change from week to week and as parents
are forced to work more and more overtime hours. </p>
<p>That's why their agenda must be blocked.</p>

<body>
<h1 align="center">America Needs Worker Protections</h1>
<h3>The Current Situation</h3>
<p>In 1970, President Nixon signed into law the Occupational
Safety and Health Act, which guarantees every American worker a
safe and healthful working environment. Since 1970, the number of
people killed on the job has been cut in half and injury rates
have fallen by almost 25 percent. But we still have a long way to
go. </p>
<p>Each year more than 55,000 workers are killed as a result of
occupational accidents or occupational diseases, another 60,000
workers are permanently disabled, and nearly 7 million workers
are injured on the job. Thats one workplace death or injury every
5 seconds. Additionally 25,000,000 workers each year are exposed
to toxic chemicals in their workplaces. </p>
<p>Workplace safety and health cannot be achieved without strong
safety and health standards which apply to all employers, so that
no employer can gain a competitive advantage by cutting corners
on workplace safety. Unfortunately, the procedures for setting
standards under the Occupational Safety and Health Act are so
complicated that it takes on average seven years to issue a new
safety or health standard. And the penalties for violating the
law are quite weak: the average fine for conditions posing a
substantial probability of death or serious harm is only $800. </p>
<h3>The New Leadership's Agenda</h3>
<p>The Republican leaders have no program to make workplaces
safer or healthier. They think the government is doing too much
already to protect the safety and health of workers. Their
ultimate aim is to gut the law. </p>
<h4>Specifically, here is what the new Congress is doing:</h4>
<p>Some Republican House members are working on what they call
&quot;reform&quot; of the Occupational Safety and Health Act.
Their proposal would: </p>
<ul>
    <li>Relax the duty employers now have to provide a safe
        workplace. </li>
    <li>Make it more difficult for OSHA to issue new occupational
        safety and health standards by requiring the Agency to
        jump through a whole new set of procedural hoops. </li>
    <li>Deprive OSHA of the authority to issue standards tough
        enough to protect employee health. </li>
    <li>Take away the right of workers and their unions to get a
        workplace inspection in response to a complaint about
        serious hazards. </li>
    <li>Exempt large numbers of employers from inspections and
        reduce the already-weak penalties in the law, including
        reducing the maximum penalty to just $7,000. </li>
</ul>
<p>Not content to wait for the opportunity to &quot;reform&quot;
the law, some Republicans are using the budget process to weaken
enforcement of the Occupational Safety and Health Act. Today, we
spend little more than $1 per citizen on OSHA which pays for one
OSHA inspector per 4,000 workplaces. The House Republicans want
to cut that still more by 12 percent this year and still more
over the next five years. And they propose a 75 percent cut in
the budget for the National Institute of Occupational Safety and
Health which would essentially eliminate government research on
workplace health hazards. </p>
<p>The House also has passed a bill that would prevent any new
occupational safety or health standard from being issued or even
worked on in 1995. They have passed another bill which, in the
name of &quot;regulatory reform,&quot; would add 23 new steps to
the process required to issue new occupational safety and health
standards. Among other things, the Labor Department would have to
prove that the lives being saved are worth the cost to
businesses. These requirements are so complex and difficult that
the process of issuing new safety and health standards would
grind to a halt. </p>
<h3>What This Means To You</h3>
<p>If the new leaders in Congress are not stopped now, OSHA will
be gutted and workplaces will become more dangerous. The process
of issuing safety and health standards will be stopped cold
before the Labor Department can issue the urgently needed
ergonomics standard to attack the largest and fastest growing
cause of worker injury and to protect millions of workers facing
crippling injuries from repetitive motion and poor work design.
There will be fewer OSHA inspectors, weaker penalties, and less
research on the causes of occupational injuries and diseases.
Thousands more workers will be killed, injured, or develop
debilitating occupational diseases each and every year. </p>
<p>That's why their agenda must be blocked. </p>
<h3>What You Can Do</h3>
<p>Visit the <a href="http://www.standup.westlake.com/">Stand Up
Online Center</a>. </p>
<p>ORGANIZE a call-in to Congressional Representatives. Use the
AFL-CIO's toll-free number- 1-800- 97-AFL-CIO. Ask for your House
Representative. Tell them you oppose H.R. 1834 and demand that
they vote against it. </p>

<title>Stand UP for a Real Voice on the Job</title>

<body>
<h1 align="center">America Needs a Real Voice on the Job</h1>
<h3>The Current Situation</h3>
<p>Only about one in nine workers in private industry today has a
union. The other 89 percent have no democratic voice on the job. </p>
<p>The reason is that the law does not protect workers trying to
form a union. During organizing campaigns, one out of four
private employers fires employees for union activity. Even though
this is illegal, the typical employer gets away with it. Even if
they are caught, the average amount they are penalized is under
$3,000. </p>
<p>Employees who want to form a union are regularly threatened
and harassed. Virtually every employer finds other ways of
scaring employees about what will happen to them if they dare to
vote for a union. And even when employees succeed in forming a
union, one out of three employers refuses ever to agree to a
first contract with the employees' elected union. </p>
<p>The United States is the only developed nation that allows
employers to act this way. The United States also has the lowest
rate of union representation, and the largest gap between
high-paid and low-wage workers. </p>
<h3>What Should Be Done</h3>
<p>Workers need a real, democratically-chosen voice on the job so
they can participate in creating better, more productive
workplaces and in determining the terms and conditions under
which they work. Companies should be required to recognize a
union selected by a majority of employees and to bargain
collectively over all subjects of concern to the workers.
Employers who interfere in the workers decision to form a union
should be subject to stiff penalties. And employers should not be
allowed to permanently replace employees who engage in a lawful
strike. </p>
<h3>The New Leadership's Agenda</h3>
<p>The new leaders in Congress have no use for unions or for
collective bargaining. Unions stand in their way. Thats why they
are trying to make it even more difficult for workers to form a
union and easier for employers to break a union. Here is what
some Republicans and the Democrats who vote with them are
proposing: </p>
<p>They have introduced a bill in the House (H.R. 743) and in the
Senate (S.295) to make it legal for employers to create company
unions. This so-called TEAM Act would let management create an
employee organization, write the rules, choose the leaders and
then deal with these hand-picked spokespersons as if they were
the real voice of the workers. Unionized companies could use
these management-controlled organizations to undermine the real
union, and non-union companies could create company unions to
prevent their workers from forming a real union. (For more
information about this issue, see the Questions and Answers on
the TEAM Act that follows.) </p>
<p>They are trying to force President Clinton to use taxpayer
dollars to do business with employers who permanently replace
their striking employees. President Clinton has issued an
Executive Order which requires the federal government to cease
doing business with such companies. The Republicans are trying to
prevent the Clinton Administration from implementing this Order. </p>
<p>They have proposed a national so-called &quot;right to
work&quot; law. This would make it illegal for unions and
employers to require employees to pay their fair share of the
cost of negotiating and administering the contract, even when a
majority of the employees support such a requirement. Instead,
workers would have the right to &quot;a free ride&quot; to enjoy
the benefits of union representation without paying the cost. The
end result would, of course, be to weaken unions by depriving
them of the resources needed to provide effective representation. </p>
<h3>What This Means To You</h3>
<p>If the new leaders in Congress are not stopped now, your union
could be replaced by a company union controlled by the employer
rather than by you and your fellow employees. Workers who do not
now have a union to represent them will find it even harder to
organize a union. And fewer unions means less bargaining power
for workers who are organized. </p>
<p>That's why their agenda must be blocked. </p>
<hr>
<h2 align="center">Questions and Answers about the &quot;Teamwork
for Employees Act&quot; (H.R. 743/S. 295) </h2>
<h3>What Is The Teamwork For Employees Act?</h3>
<p>The Teamwork for Employees Act is a Republican proposal to
amend the National Labor Relations Act to let employers pick and
control representatives who are supposed to speak for employees. </p>
<h3>How Would The Bill Do That?</h3>
<p>Under section 8(a)(2) of the NLRA, it is illegal for an
employer to &quot;dominate&quot; an organization in which
employees participate to deal with their employer concerning
their wages or working conditions. That has been the law for 60
years. The Republicans' bill would change that to permit
employers to &quot;establish, assist, and maintain&quot; employee
organizations. </p>
<h3>What Would This Mean For Union Members?</h3>
<p>Passing this bill would give employers a new tool for busting
unions. The employer could create a company union and pay all its
costs. The employer could then deal with the company union
instead of with the real union. The employer could even grant
concessions to the company union that the employer would not
agree to with the real union. In these ways the employer could
very easily undermine support for your union. </p>
<h3>Is That The Only Problem With This Bill?</h3>
<p>Not at all. The bill would also allow non-union employers to
create company unions. That would make it even harder than it is
today for workers to form a real union. When organizing becomes
more difficult, all workers union and non- union alike suffer
since it becomes easier for employers to divide and conquer. Who
is behind this effort to weaken the labor laws? The Republicans'
bill is being pushed by big business groups, including the
National Association of Manufacturers and the Chamber of
Commerce. They want to take quick advantage of the Republicans'
control of Congress to take from workers the right to choose
their own representatives. </p>
<h3>Why Are They Doing This?</h3>
<p>The Republicans and business interests say they want to
promote labor- management cooperation and teamwork. But the
current law allow all of that. What the law prohibits is employer
control of employee representatives. This bill is really designed
to give employers new tools to deny workers a real voice in the
workplace. </p>
<h3>What Should I Do?</h3>
<p>Write your Representative TODAY. Our message: Vote against the
TEAM Act.</p>

<h1 align="center">America Needs a Raise: An Action Guide </h1>
<p>If we're going to defeat the new Republican Congress'
destructive agenda, the labor movement and its allies will need
an army of activists in local communities to: </p>
<ul>
    <li>talk to their legislators; </li>
    <li>educate their co-workers on the issues; </li>
    <li>become politically active in voter registration and
        get-out-the-vote campaigns; </li>
    <li>organize and participate in pro-worker and union events
        and activities; </li>
    <li>build coalitions with others who care about the future of
        America and spread our message to the general public
        through local media. </li>
</ul>
<p>Success depends on our ability to mobilize and galvanize
support in every local community. If we fail, we will watch as
job protections and standards of living for American workers
continue to fall. But if we work together and succeed we can put
American back on track towards greater economic opportunity and
security for all its citizens.</p>

<p>LaborNET is an on-line communication network for trade unionists, offering users 
the opportunity to electronically access information from the national AFL-CIO 
and to exchange information with union activists throughout the country. </p>
<p>LaborNET is a private forum that resides on CompuServe, one of the nation's 
largest on-line services. </p>
<p>LaborNET includes four primary sections: a library, messages, announcements, and 
conferences. </p>
<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt><b>Library</b> </dt>
<dd>To many users, the library is LaborNET's most valuable 
component. Here you will find a wide range of public policy 
statements and other information. This repository of material 
includes everything from one-page fact sheets to detailed 
analyses of the latest AFL-CIO positions on key issues. </dd>
<dt><b>Messages</b> </dt>
<dd>The messages section is a place where members correspond 
with one another. Here you may find person-to-person 
notes, requests for information, answers to questions and 
continuing discussions. You can post your own messages, 
reply to others, or just read messages posted by other 
members. </dd>
<dt><b>Conference</b> </dt>
<dd>The conference section is where members can gather for 
&quot;live conversation.&quot; Here you may find several members 
engaged in a regularly scheduled meeting or participating in a 
special conference hosted by a guest speaker. </dd>
<dt><b>Announcements</b> </dt>
<dd>Announcements are used to inform members about changes 
in LaborNET. The scheduling of on-line conferences will be

<title>AFL-CIO WORK IN PROGRESS -- January 21, 1997</title>

<p>&#160;</p>
<p align="left">AFL-CIO WORK IN PROGRESS -- January 21, 1997</p>
<p align="left">KING DAY -- &quot;All the working families in
this country depend on the vision and the dream of Dr. Martin L.
King, Jr. -- the `Dream of Justice,'&quot; AFL-CIO President John
J. Sweeney said in observance of Martin L. King, Jr.'s birthday.
He noted, &quot;In the nearly three decades since Dr. King was
gunned down, this simple `Dream of Justice' is not reality . . .
Without economic justice, social justice cannot thrive . . .
Honest labor must raise the standard of living for all rather
than enormous wealth for a few.&quot; </p>
<p>TEAMSTERS CLEAN UP AT TRUMP -- Cleaning workers at the Trump
Plaza Hotel took advantage of the only &quot;sure thing&quot; in
this seaside gambling mecca -- union representation -- when they
voted to join Teamster Local 331 Jan 14. Most of the 243 in the
Atlantic City, N.J. casino's Environmental Service Unit have not
seen a raise three years. The Teamsters scored three other
organizing wins when 20 film industry workers at Tri-Phoenix Film
Co and 50 movie workers at Western State Services in Hollywood,
Calif. voted to join Local 399, and Local 406 won 18 new members
at Lake County EMS in Baldwin, Mich.. </p>
<p>HEAD START FOR SEIU -- Service Employees Local 100 will
represent 900 Head Start workers in Houston following a
successful organizing drive. Combined with Local 205's organizing
victory for Head Start and Community Action workers in Nashville,
Tenn, SEIU's southern organizing total hits more than 1,000 for
the first week of the new year. </p>
<p>TWA UNION VOTE SCHEDULED -- TWA's flight attendants, members
of an unaffiliated union, will vote Jan. 22-27 on whether to
affiliate with the Machinists. Members of the Independent
Federation of Flight Attendants earlier this month rejected
affiliation with the Flight Attendants by squeaker --
1,198-1,180. </p>
<p>FE-FI-FO-FUM, GIANT SUCCUMBS -- A five-week strike by Teamster
drivers against mid-Atlantic grocer Giant Food Co. ended with a
contract guaranteeing current drivers life-time employment and
protecting delivery work in the Baltimore-Washington market. The
deal came on the heels of a letter to Giant from AFL-CIO
Secretary- Treasurer Richard Trumka and several union presidents
who offered to help end the strike, but warned that &quot;if the
strike is not resolved in a timely fashion, the unions will meet
again to re- evaluate the situation and consider additional
courses of action.&quot; </p>
<p>WITCH HUNT -- The Republicans' vendetta hearings against the
Laborers proved just that in the final report by the House
Judiciary crime subcommittee, which admitted that no evidence
exists of improper White House influence in the Justice
Department's handling of racketeering charges against the union.
Last year, during McCarthy-like show hearings, Republicans
charged that LIUNA President Arthur Coia's support of Clinton had
caused Justice to water down a 1995 settlement requiring the
union to rid itself of corrupt influences. Instead, Justice
officials said the union is running a model program to clean its
house. </p>
<p>BLOOD FLOWS -- A 16-day strike by workers in West Virginia,
Kentucky and Ohio beat back an attempt by the Red Cross to boost
their health care premiums by 50 percent. After management
withdrew the huge premium increase, the 68 SEIU 1199 members
based in Huntington, W.Va. OK'd a three-year pact with a 9
percent wage hike Jan. 14. </p>
<p>UNION BLASTS GUESS? -- Guess? Inc. the company that sells its
jeans as &quot;Made in the USA, an American Tradition&quot; is
moving most of its manufacturing to Mexico, Peru and Chile.
&quot;This is about profit pure and simple. Guess wants to be
free to run their sweatshops,&quot; UNITE's Steve Nutter said.
The company was cited for sweatshop and labor violations in Los
Angeles, Nutter said, &quot;instead of doing the right thing by
cleaning up their act, providing safe worksites and a living wage
to Los Angeles workers, Guess is jumping ship to bypass fair
labor laws.&quot; </p>
<p>SHUT DOWN MOTOWN -- After 18 months, &quot;It's time to take a
more aggressive route,&quot; Detroit newspaper striker Kate
DesMet said. With that new tactic, dubbed Shut Down Motown `97,
strikers and community supporters took to the streets and the
airport in a trio of actions. First, hundreds blocked a street in
front of the Detroit Newspapers' printing plant, resulting in 33
arrests for the civil disobedience. Four days later at Detroit's
Metro airport, strikers leafleted passengers and staged a noisy
caravan around the airport. About 30 strikers went to Budget car
rental to protest its continued advertising in the scab papers.
The local Budget manager told the strikers he had stopped all
business with strike-bound papers, and that the ads were placed
by the company's national headquarters. While the strikers
listened, he relayed their demands to the firm's corporate
offices. On Jan. 8, several hundred strikers and activists staged
a rolling traffic blockade in downtown, blocking intersections
and leafleting motorists. </p>
<p>FLIGHT DECK UNITY -- Members of the Canadian Air Line Pilots
Association approved a merger with its U.S. counterpart by a
margin of 89 percent. The Air Line Pilots Association represents
43,000 members at 38 U.S. airlines while CALPA represents more
than 2,700 members at 10 Canadian airlines. </p>
<p>DIFFERENT PATHS -- Air Line Pilots and Machinist mechanics at
United Airlines overwhelmingly rejected proposed wage and
benefits packages, triggering an arbitration process stipulated
by their 1994 ESOP deal. Eighty percent of the pilots and 63
percent of the mechanics thumbed down similar pacts with 10
percent salary increases over three and a half years. Ramp
workers, dispatchers, security officers, baggage handlers,
vehicle drivers and food service workers, who like the mechanics
are represented by the IAM but vote separately, approved the
agreement by 67 percent. </p>
<p>FAIR WAGES FOR WORKFARE -- More than 100 workfare workers,
union officials and supporters jammed the steps of New York City
Hall Jan. 15 for a press conference calling on Mayor Robert
Giuliani and Governor George Pataki to negotiate with workfare
workers for real jobs at real wages. Police attempted to prevent
some speakers from joining, but the workfare workers chanted,
&quot;Let them in, let them in&quot; and formed a protest picket
line so the press conference could continue. </p>
<p>DO IT RIGHT THIS TIME -- That's what the California AFL-CIO
told the CAL-OSHA Standards Board last week. The board's
ergonomic standards were rejected earlier this month by the
state's Office of Administrative Law because of serious flaws.
But many of CAL-OSHA's proposed fixes fall far short, and labor's
fight for enforceable and adequate ergonomics protection
continues in the courts. </p>
<p>INDIA'S SAMANT MURDERED -- The murder of Indian trade union
leader Datta Samant Jan. 16 sparked a strike that nearly brought
activity in Bombay to a halt. Samant, who in the 1980s led one of
the longest strikes ever among India's textile workers and headed
a million member union, was gunned down on his way to work.
Police have suggested that the killing may have been ordered by
industrialists. </p>
<p>COURTING DISASTER -- The International Confederation of Free
Trade Unions put an observer on the scene as the
&quot;subversion&quot; trial of Muchtar Pakpahan, Indonesia's
independent trade union leader, resumed. Pakpahan faces a
possible death sentence for publishing a book contrasting the
incomes of rich and poor, speeches, news releases and a cassette
of workers' songs. Some witnesses have been coached to
incriminate Pakpahan and save themselves, and the judge has
prevented the defense from questioning them. </p>
<p>A BREAK IN KOREA -- Bowing to pressure from an almost four-
week general strike, South Korean President Kim Young Sam agreed
to send back to lawmakers an anti-labor legal &quot;reform&quot;
railroaded through Parliament Dec. 26. Police arrested trade
union leader Kim Byong-Soo and were set to arrest other strike
leaders who took refuge in a Seoul cathedral last week. The
AFL-CIO, the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions and
other labor groups strongly condemned the government's policies. </p>
<p>MEBA SUPPORTS RADIO OFFICERS -- The Marine Engineers have
rallied support for a waterfront strike by the American Radio
Association against American President Lines to protest the
carrier's refusal to bargain. Since ARA members walked off the
job Jan. 10, individual MEBA members have refused to cross the
picket lines at West Coast ports. </p>
<p>OSHA FINGERS FACTORY FOR FINE -- A Syracuse, N.Y., plastics
factory was hit by a $720,000 fine for violating federal safety
laws. The company, Landis Plastics Inc, was cited by OSHA for
repeated failure to install necessary machine guards and for 63
cases of record-keeping violations. The plant is a target of a
Steelworkers' organizing drive. </p>
<p>CALIFORNIA UI SUIT -- The AFL-CIO filed a class action suit on
behalf of at least 120,000 unemployed California workers who have
been unfairly denied $230 million in unemployment insurance. Due
to an anachronism in state law, recent earnings are not counted
in calculating benefits and that can cause delays for weeks and
months, or even denial of UI benefits. A report by the state
found that almost 30,000 workers are forced onto the welfare
rolls because of delay or denial of benefits. Ten other state
have updated their laws to minimize such delays. </p>
<p>CHARTING A COURSE -- Representatives of affiliates attending
the Economics Education Working Group last week indicated their
agreement with the basic vision, policy parameters and necessary
analysis to achieve a multiyear, multilevel program to present a
workers' perspective on the political economy. Further meetings
are scheduled. </p>
<p>CONFIDENTIALLY -- In a major decision, a federal appeals court
protected the confidentiality of documents related to corporate
campaigns by the Steelworkers. The appeals court overturned a
lower court ruling that two public relations firms must turn over
USWA corporate campaign documents to Food Lion, the grocery
chain, which is involved in a legal battle with another union
represented by the two firms. </p>
<p>CHAVEZ-THOMPSON WINS DNC POST -- AFL-CIO Executive Vice
President Linda Chavez-Thompson was elected a vice chair of the
Democratic National Committee Jan. 21. The committee also elected
Colorado Gov. Roy Romer general chair and philanthropist and
businessman Steven Grossman national chair. </p>
<p>ANTIDOTE TO POISON PILL -- Shareholders now have more control
over how a corporation governs itself thanks to a successful suit
by the Teamsters. A federal judge in Oklahoma ruled that Fleming
Companies must let shareholders vote on a binding resolution
concerning that company's &quot;poison pill&quot; plan. The
company ignored a 65 percent shareholder vote for a non-binding
resolution when it enacted a new &quot;poison pill&quot; plan.
The judge ordered the company to allow shareholders to vote on a
binding resolution. </p>
<p>MEANY'S KAUFMAN DIES - Stuart Kaufman, 54, archival advisor to
the George Meany Center and Archives died from a heart attack at
his Maryland home last week. Kaufman was the founder and editor
of the quarterly Labor Heritage magazine. He also was editor of
the 12-volume &quot;Samuel Gompers Papers&quot; and author of
&quot;Samuel Gompers and the Origins of the American Federation
of Labor, 1848-1896. He is survived by his wife and a son. </p>

    <p align="center"><font size="4"><strong>AFL-CIO News,
    chronicler of labor events, retires</strong></font><br>
    by<br>
    Michael Byrne </p>
    <p>With this issue, the AFL-CIO News closes a chapter in
    labor communications that has marked time for organized
    workers since the 1955 merger of the American Federation of
    Labor and the Congress of Industrial Organizations. </p>
    <p>The News is being retired in favor of a new official
    publication, America@work, a monthly magazine aimed at
    providing union leaders and activists with information they
    can use to build a stronger labor movement. </p>
    <p>America@work, debuting this month, will focus on the new
    vision for the labor movement, the strategies and tactics
    that are helping unions grow and the activists who are
    leading the charge. The new magazine also will offer readers
    a chance to talk back. </p>
    <p>The AFL-CIO News has had its day, and it was effective in
    telling the story of unions working together for change. </p>
    <p>The News was created out of the CIO News and the AFL News
    Reporter back in late 1955. The debut issue featured a
    triumphant George Meany of the AFL and Walter Reuther of the
    CIO at the merger convention, where Meany was elected
    president. </p>
    <p>That first convention passed a resolution inaugurating a
    public relations program that would &quot;use all available
    media, including radio and television.&quot; It also urged
    unions to &quot;support the labor press, and particularly the
    new AFL-CIO News.&quot; </p>
    <p>To edit the new weekly newspaper, AFL-CIO President George
    Meany brought in a young Newspaper Guild activist, Saul
    Miller, who for 25 years directed not only the AFL-CIO News,
    but also the Federationist, a monthly magazine that ceased
    publication in the early 1980s. </p>
    <p>Miller told his staff that the AFL-CIO News was, in
    essence, the hyphen between the AFL and the CIO. It would
    cover all union activity impartially and objectively, and it
    should do nothing to indicate that it favored any one union
    over another. </p>
    <p>That first year featured the move into a new headquarters
    building, dedicated by President Dwight D. Eisenhower, who
    declared that &quot;labor is the United States.&quot; Later
    that year, after much public soul-searching through the pages
    of the AFL-CIO News, the federation endorsed Adlai Stevenson,
    the Democratic candidate who sought to unseat Eisenhower. </p>
    <p>Throughout its existence, the AFL-CIO News commanded a
    degree of respect and credibility among opinion leaders and
    members of the press. It was the only publication that
    exclusively covered the labor movement, and its currency was
    information, not rhetoric. </p>
    <p>&quot;The journalistic standards of the AFL-CIO News never
    changed during my time there,&quot; said John Barry, managing
    editor from 1968 to 1988. &quot;We were pro-labor, of course,
    but we maintained a semblance of objectivity. We were careful
    not to provide unattributed editorial comments.&quot; </p>
    <p>Rex Hardesty, who had edited the Federationist until it
    was retired in 1982, helped to change the face of the News
    when he became director of the department in 1986. He
    eliminated the editorial page, arguing that editorials were
    redundant in a publication that should reflect the position
    of the AFL-CIO in every story. And, in an economic move
    necessitated by higher postal rates, he instituted the
    current biweekly format and four-color production. </p>
    <p>The brighter, more accessible News was a major departure
    from the traditional &quot;gray lady&quot; that chronicled
    the labor movement for decades. </p>
    <p>&quot;I wanted to redesign the paper when I arrived back
    in 1961,&quot; Barry recalled. &quot;But Saul told me that
    Mr. Meany wouldn't hear of changing it. Twenty years later,
    after Meany died, I was told to redesign it. But I only made
    some slight changes, like going from five to four columns and
    adding some boxes.&quot; </p>
    <p>The labor press always has been crucial to the success of
    the AFL-CIO News. Since the News circulated primarily to
    leadership, currently to about 53,000, the federation has
    depended on union newspapers to pass along to union members
    the information and message of the unified labor movement. In
    recent years, that has been facilitated electronically
    through LaborNET and the federation's home page on the
    Internet. </p>
    <p>The AFL-CIO News mandate to promote solidarity became even
    more important after Meany died, when President Lane Kirkland
    inherited a labor movement under siege from a new Republican
    president, who stacked the National Labor Relations Board in
    favor of business and fired striking Air Traffic Controllers.
    The News played a key role in promoting two Solidarity Day
    marches on Washington, in 1981 and 1991. </p>
    <p>During this time, a philosophy parallel to solidarity was
    developed for the News. It became increasingly clear that the
    News also would have to seek out stories that provided
    illustrations and lessons in how the labor movement could
    grow. </p>
    <p>That imperative was clarified by the 1985 landmark report
    by the AFL-CIO Committee on the Evolution of Work, chaired by
    Secretary-Treasurer Tom Donahue. &quot;The Changing Situation
    of Workers and Their Unions&quot; emphasized the need for
    innovative organizing techniques, new benefits for union
    members and new communications efforts, especially through
    the electronic media. </p>
    <p>The AFL-CIO News also chronicled one of the most
    revolutionary changes in the federation, the first contested
    election in AFL-CIO history, in which President John J.
    Sweeney defeated Donahue at the 1995 convention. </p>
    <p>A study of AFL-CIO communications commissioned by Donahue
    and presented after the convention recommended that the
    federation develop new communications vehicles and to
    reassess the utility of the AFL-CIO News. With the debut of
    the weekly Work in Progress in January and the monthly
    America@work, the AFL-CIO News now can pass the torch. </p>

<p align="center"><font size="4"><strong>Voter turnout efforts
take hold <br>
Electronic voter guides punctuate Labor '96 drive </strong></font><br>
by<br>
Michael Byrne </p>
<blockquote>
    <p>More than 10,000 new union activists are busy in
    congressional districts across the country, explaining the
    issues to their union brothers and sisters and urging them to
    get out and vote this Nov. 5. </p>
    <p>Labor '96 has moved into the all-important
    get-out-the-vote (GOTV) phase, as AFL-CIO and affiliated
    union staff have dispersed to help coordinators mobilize
    union workers around issues important to working families. </p>
    <p>At the same time, the federation was airing new television
    and radio voter guides providing information to voters on
    where candidates stand on the issues. </p>
    <p>&quot;The electronic voter guides are one more step in the
    AFL- CIO's continuing effort to raise the issues that are
    central to the lives of working Americans and to shine a
    light on Congress's and candidates' records with respect to
    those issues,&quot; said AFL-CIO President John J. Sweeney. </p>
    <p>&quot;We plan to continue to lobby officeholders and
    would-be officeholders to adopt positions on issues like
    education, health care and retirement security that are good
    for working people,&quot; he said. </p>
    <p>This year, working women were being engaged in the
    political discussion as never before, with a full week of
    outreach cosponsored by the AFL-CIO Working Women's
    Department and 9to5, the National Association of Working
    Women. (<a href="women.htm">See story, Page 4</a>.) </p>
    <p>The AFL-CIO's issues-based campaign continued to draw fire
    from the Republican Party leadership, which filed suit to
    force the Federal Election Commission to act on its numerous
    complaints. The suit amounts to &quot;another publicity
    stunt,&quot; said AFL-CIO General Counsel Jon Hiatt, who said
    it was filed &quot;to distract public attention from the real
    issue in this year's campaign -- the Republican Congress's
    dismal record on working family issues such as Medicare,
    health care, education, taxes and pension rights.&quot; </p>
    <p>The ads are protected by the First Amendment and comply
    with federal campaign laws, Hiatt pointed out. The
    Republicans previously had used threats of legal action
    against local TV and radio stations in an effort to keep the
    ads off the air, but only a handful of stations pulled the
    ads. </p>
    <p>The ads are the most expensive part of the $35 million
    Labor '96 program approved by a special convention in March.
    But the union spending is only a drop in the bucket compared
    with the spending of business groups, which are on the way to
    again outspend labor groups by a 7-1 margin, AFL-CIO
    Political Director Steve Rosenthal said. </p>
    <p>&quot;That spending advantage will be seen dramatically in
    the last month before the election,&quot; Rosenthal said.
    &quot;Those Republicans who voted for business special
    interests and against workers now will be blitzing the
    airwaves with their commercials. We won't be able to match
    them in spending but, like always, we have the people
    advantage.&quot; </p>
    <p>Unions hope the &quot;people advantage&quot; will be
    magnified this year with the massive mobilization through the
    Labor '96 campaign, making the vote of union households the
    key both for the re- election of President Clinton and for a
    wholesale housecleaning of the anti-worker Congress. To
    achieve this goal, the campaign has to overcome what
    Rosenthal calls the 40-40-40 problem. </p>
    <p>&quot;In a district with, say, 35,000 union members, 40
    percent aren't registered. That leaves 21,000,&quot; he said.
    &quot;Then, 40 percent likely won't vote, and we're down to
    12,600. Of those, 40 percent may vote against their own
    economic interests. We have to do better than 7,560 union
    members out of 35,000 voting for pro-worker candidates.&quot; </p>
    <p>Labor '96 is approaching this 40-40-40 problem at every
    level -- seeking to get more union members registered to vote
    and mobilizing them to vote through a political education
    program that emphasizes not candidates or political parties,
    but where candidates stand on those issues important to them. </p>
    <p>&quot;The labor movement is united as never before for
    Labor '96,&quot; Sweeney said. He points not only to the
    unanimity of the March special convention, but also at the
    willingness of affiliated unions to share their membership
    lists for the coordinated campaign. The Political Department
    is working from a list of more than 15 million union members
    and retirees, nearly twice as many as in previous years. </p>
    <p>The solidarity also is showing up in congressional
    districts, where affiliated unions have contributed more than
    half of the 158 coordinators now in the field. In addition,
    for get-out-the-vote activity, international unions are
    sending hundreds of staff into the field. </p>
    <p>These workers will be going to union halls, plants and
    union members' homes to talk about the election, passing out
    candidate comparison fliers, making telephone calls and
    knocking on members' doors, among other activity. </p>
    <p>In a conference call with Executive Council members Sept.
    26, Sweeney urged international union presidents to join him,
    Secretary-Treasurer Richard L. Trumka and Executive Vice
    President Linda Chavez-Thompson on the campaign trail. </p>
    <p>&quot;In areas where their union members are concentrated,
    a visit from the union president could be crucial,&quot;
    Rosenthal said. </p>

    <p align="center"><font size="4"><strong>Seven-year battle
    yields card-check win at SF Marriott<br>
    </strong></font>by <br>
    Muriel H. Cooper </p>
    <p>Workers at the Marriott Hotel in San Francisco won an
    historic, hard-fought victory for representation by the Hotel
    Employees and Restaurant Employees Local 2. </p>
    <p>The Marriott -- the largest nonunion hotel in the city --
    agreed to recognize the local through a card-check agreement.
    The union is hoping to start contract negotiations by the end
    of the year. </p>
    <p>&quot;This is an historical breakthrough that is directly
    related to the local restructuring and its emphasis on
    organizing,&quot; said AFL-CIO Organizing Director Richard
    Bensinger in a ceremony attended by workers and San Francisco
    Mayor Willie Brown, who applauded the recognition. </p>
    <p>Marriott traditionally has resisted unions rather
    forcefully. &quot;We look forward to a period of mutual
    respect between Marriott and the employees of their company
    here in San Francisco,&quot; said Bensinger. </p>
    <p>Marriott had entered into a card-check agreement with the
    local years before it opened its doors in 1989. But then the
    hotel rejected moves by the union to implement the card
    check. </p>
    <p>&quot;Their definition was different than ours,&quot; said
    Michael Casey, the local's president. &quot;We had a
    different interpretation of what the agreement was.&quot; </p>
    <p>A legal battle and boycott ensued until 1995, when the
    parties agreed to mediation to settle the lawsuit short of a
    trial. Last month, Special Master John Kagel certified that a
    majority of the workers had signed cards authorizing the
    local to represent them. </p>
    <p>The commitment of financial and human resources made this
    win happen, Casey said. </p>
    <p>&quot;We told our members that this fight is critical for
    us to continue to set standards for all working
    families,&quot; he said. &quot;We realigned our resources and
    took $200,000 out of the strike fund and put it into
    organizing. Then the members agreed to use $2 a month in dues
    money for organizing. </p>
    <p>We had a strong in-house committee of about 60 workers who
    got cards signed in about a week,&quot; Casey said. &quot;We
    also had many community allies who helped.&quot; </p>
    <p>There is a valuable lesson in the San Francisco
    experience, Bensinger said. &quot;The futility of going
    through the labor board process is so great that the AFL-CIO
    is less and less choosing that route. </p>
    <p>This victory stands for the proposition that if we ignore
    the outdated NLRB process and unite the progressive forces in
    the community and fight with all our resources and creativity
    for the right of all working people, we can reverse the
    lopsided balance of power which is concentrating an
    incredible excess of power in the hands of big
    corporations,&quot; he said. </p>
    <p>Local 2 now devotes 30 percent of its resources to
    organizing and plans to continue to use creative ways to gain
    members. &quot;The National Labor Relations Act is a joke
    when it comes to organizing workers. That's just the way it
    is,&quot; Casey said. </p>
    <p>&quot;Workers' rights shouldn't be subject to bureaucracy.
    We have to use different strategies that are non-board, like
    neutrality agreements. That's the way to go.&quot; </p>
    <p>The union's innovation has attracted the eye of government
    officials in San Francisco. </p>
    <p>Mayor Brown said he endorsed the neutrality agreement and
    encouraged other employers to seek this method to conduct
    business with unions. </p>

    <p align="center"><font size="4"><strong>FedEx special favor
    is disappointment</strong></font><br>
    by<br>
    Mike Hall </p>
    <p>The 104th Congress that roared like a dangerous lion when
    it came to Washington last year armed with a &quot;Contract
    on America&quot; left town meekly after passing an omnibus
    spending bill that left worker programs with funds and
    anti-worker riders on the shelf. </p>
    <p>&quot;This was a major victory,&quot; said AFL-CIO
    Legislative Director Peggy Taylor, who credited the
    federation's persistent, high- profile grass-roots campaign
    that kept the pressure on members of Congress in their home
    districts throughout the year. </p>
    <p>Workers not only beat back assaults on programs important
    to working families and insidious attacks on unions, but they
    came away with a minimum wage increase that no one thought
    this Congress would pass. </p>
    <p>Still, workers at Federal Express suffered a setback in
    their organizing attempts when the Senate passed an FAA
    measure that contained language, slipped into the bill at
    FedEx's behest, that the company could use to argue that its
    workers come under the auspices of the Rail Labor Act instead
    of the National Labor Relations Act. </p>
    <p>The spending bill, with Labor/HHS appropriations and five
    other unfinished spending measures for fiscal 1997 wrapped
    into it, sailed through as the budget cutters kept their
    knives in check. </p>
    <p>House Republicans earlier had passed a Labor/HHS bill that
    cut funding for the Occupational Safety and Health
    Administration, the National Labor Relations Board, education
    and training and wage enforcement services, as well as
    several anti-worker riders. </p>
    <p>One of those provisions banned use of &quot;official
    time&quot; -- the time union reps spend on labor-management
    programs and other representational activities -- at the
    Social Security Administration and the Health Care Financing
    Administration. Another would have allowed prisoners to be
    paid less than the minimum wage to make products that compete
    with privately manufactured ones, thus undercutting the
    private sector. </p>
    <p>House and Senate Democrats and the Clinton administration
    vowed to restore cuts in vital spending programs and fight
    the anti-worker provisions. </p>
    <p>With campaigns beckoning, the end of the fiscal year
    approaching and still scarred from their government shutdowns
    when they refused to compromise on fiscal 1996 spending, GOP
    leaders backed down and dealt. </p>
    <p>Taylor noted that Rep. David Obey (D-Wis.), the ranking
    Democratic member on the Appropriations Committee, played a
    key role in securing the increased DOL, NLRB and education
    and training funding. Overall DOL funding was increased 9
    percent over House levels. In addition, according to a DOL
    analysis, worker protections, including workplace health and
    safety, pension security and wage and hour enforcement jumped
    $78 million over House figures. </p>
    <p>The extra $26 million for the Employment Standards
    Administration over fiscal 1996 means &quot;efforts to
    eradicate garment sweatshops will be expanded; efforts to
    enforce the minimum wage and to protect workers' newly won
    family and medical leave rights will be enhanced and an
    initiative will be undertaken to improve the integrity of and
    accuracy of Davis-Bacon wage determinations,&quot; the Labor
    Department said. </p>
    <p>The NLRB, a favorite target of the GOP, was slated for a
    15 percent cut under the House bill. Instead, the omnibus
    bill increased its budget almost $5 million over the previous
    year. In addition, a favorite Republican rider that would
    have excluded all but larger companies from NLRB jurisdiction
    was dropped. </p>
    <p>Employment Services also was fully funded -- $58 million
    more than House Republicans wanted to provide in assistance
    for unemployed job seekers. </p>
    <p>A program to assist dislocated workers with training and
    re- employment services received $193 million over House
    levels. Funds for the Joint Training and Partnership Act were
    protected from a GOP attempt to transfer most of the monies
    to other programs. </p>
    <p>Funding for summer jobs, school-to-work programs, adult
    training and the Job Corps also was raised over Republican
    House figures. </p>
    <p>Education also benefited greatly from the White House and
    Democrats' strong insistence that vital programs receive
    adequate funds. </p>
    <p>&quot;The public is well aware of the fact, even if the
    Republican caucus originally was not, that enrollments are
    rising,&quot; Obey said. &quot;College costs are rising and
    local property taxpayers want relief.&quot; </p>
    <p>Funding for nearly every major education program -- many
    slashed in the GOP House budget -- will be increased.
    Overall, spending is slated to be 22 percent more than fiscal
    1996. </p>
    <p>Goals 2000, eliminated in the House version, will receive
    $141 million above last year's level. Other education
    programs that received increases over Republican levels
    included Head Start and Healthy Start, remedial education for
    low-income students, programs to improve teachers skills, the
    Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, safe and
    drug-free schools, and such college loan programs as Pell
    grants and Perkins loans. </p>
    <p>The special favor for FedEx in the FAA bill was not
    included in either House or Senate version, but added in
    conference, a highly unusual move. It puts up a roadblock for
    45,000 Federal Express drivers and their drive to unionize,
    allowing the company to argue that those drivers would have
    to be organized companywide, rather than site by site. </p>
    <p>The Teamsters, who along with the UAW have FedEx
    organizing drives under way, called the provisions &quot;a
    crass attempt to further insulate the company from
    organizing.&quot; </p>
    <p>Several FedEx employees spoke at a Capitol Hill news
    conference Oct. 3 describing how they helped build the
    company, but now are facing contracting out, reduced hours
    and harassment for their pro-union stands. </p>
    <p>A vote to end a filibuster against the bill passed 66-31,
    and it was approved by a 92-2 vote. </p>

    <p align="center"><font size="4"><strong>Strawberry campaign
    elevated to national cause</strong></font><br>
    by<br>
    Sharolyn A. Rosier </p>
    <p>The fight for justice and dignity by California's
    strawberry pickers is being celebrated and publicized coast
    to coast. </p>
    <p>The AFL-CIO and the Farm Workers have formed the National
    Strawberry Commission for Workers' Rights to counter the
    industry's California Strawberry Commission. The labor panel
    includes organizations from communities across the country --
    civil rights, women, religious, social, academic and civic. </p>
    <p>In addition, the UFW is planning a tour of East Coast
    cities, from Boston to Washington, beginning Nov. 18 in
    Philadelphia. Strawberry workers will join in news
    conferences, meetings with politicians, presentations at
    universities and store visits. </p>
    <p>The UFW's drive to organize 20,000 strawberry pickers who
    work the soil of millionaire strawberry growers 10 to 12
    hours a day began last spring -- and the entire labor
    movement has answered the call, beginning with a presentation
    to the AFL-CIO Central Labor Council Conference by two
    strawberry workers and UFW President Arturo S. Rodriguez in
    July. </p>
    <p>Encouraged by the two national days of action and
    continuing efforts by the CLCs, Rodriguez traveled to
    Washington Oct. 10 to meet with AFL-CIO leaders and to plan
    new initiatives. In a speech to AFL-CIO staff, he explained
    the plight of the workers. </p>
    <p>&quot;Over the years, these workers have reported claims
    of sexual harassment, inadequate bathroom facilities,
    violations of wage and child labor laws, polluted drinking
    water for the workers, exposure to pesticides and employer
    mistreatment toward workers who demonstrate support for the
    union,&quot; he said. &quot;And that's just to name a
    few.&quot; </p>
    <p>Rodriguez thanked the labor movement for helping to rally
    public support for a living wage, proper field sanitation,
    health insurance, protection from arbitrary firings and a
    real voice for the workers. </p>
    <p>Analysis by the California Institute of Rural Studies at
    the University of California at Davis found that a 50 percent
    increase in most of the workers' wages would result in no
    more than a five- cent increase in the price of a pint of
    strawberries. &quot;Given the profitability of this crop --
    over $650 million a year gross -- the industry can easily
    afford to provide a living wage for its workers,&quot;
    Rodriguez said. </p>
    <p>In St. Louis, more than 100 Coalition of Labor Union Women
    members participated Sept. 28 in a demonstration at Sam's in
    support of the strawberry workers. Led by CLUW President
    Gloria Johnson, protesters met with the general manager and
    persuaded him to FAX to Sam's corporate office a leaflet and
    pledge to support the workers. The general manager also
    stated he &quot;would encourage them to sign the
    pledge.&quot; </p>
    <p>Meanwhile, central labor councils across the country
    continue to fulfill their commitment to gain support for the
    strawberry workers in their communities. During the Sept. 16
    National Day of Action, council representatives visited 181
    stores and obtained more than 90 signatures from store
    managers in support of the workers. </p>
    <p>In Florida last week, seven new store managers signed the
    pledge to support the workers. </p>
    <p>The CLC officers also have been successful in obtaining
    support from politicians in their communities. Several mayors
    and city council members have attended -- and actively
    participated -- in news conferences and store visits. </p>

    <p align="center"><font size="4"><strong>LIUNA blasts through
    `whole market'<br>
    </strong></font>by<br>
    Muriel H. Cooper </p>
    <p>Nearly 1,000 demolition workers in New York City have
    joined Laborers Local 79 and signed a pact with benefits and
    increased wages. </p>
    <p>The LIUNA organizing victory follows the pattern of a
    similar drive this year by Local 78, which organized most of
    the city's asbestos abatement workers. The industrywide
    campaign with the demolition workers increased the union's
    market share from 5 percent to roughly 75 percent. </p>
    <p>The &quot;whole market&quot; approach combined
    rank-and-file involvement and support from other unions. </p>
    <p>The local went in with 20 member organizers and conducted
    an education campaign on U.S. labor laws and the right to
    organize. Most of the workers are recent Ecuadoran immigrants
    who were unfamiliar with the power of a union. </p>
    <p>&quot;We conducted more than 15 pickets and strikes in the
    first 10 days of the campaign,&quot; said member organizer
    Mike Hellstrom. &quot;The response and turnout of the
    nonunion workers was really inspiring. Out of 1,200 workers,
    we ended up with 300 hardcore member organizers.&quot; </p>
    <p>They talked to workers about 12-hour days without
    overtime, health insurance and workers' compensation, said
    organizer Dave Johnson. &quot;Broken toes and fingers were
    common,&quot; he said. &quot;Workers were told to wrap broken
    fingers and `get back to work.' &quot; </p>
    <p>The workers targeted demolition contractors working on
    high- profile commercial buildings and conducted several
    &quot;organized walk- outs&quot; that paralyzed a number of
    job sites. The local also received support from the
    Teamsters. </p>
    <p>&quot;When the Teamsters would drive up to haul the trash
    and saw our pickets, they would honor the pickets and drive
    away,&quot; said Johnson. &quot;We were able to shut jobs
    down because of their support.&quot; The four-year contract
    calls for a two-tier wage system that will double and in the
    case of the more experienced workers almost triple their pay
    and provide much-needed health insurance. </p>

    harassment and favoritism displayed in the Cleveland, Miss.,
    plant and voted 248-195 on Oct. 4 for representation by the
    Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union. </p>
    <p>&quot;They were ready,&quot; organizer Regina Hicks said.
    &quot;They were tired of the unfair treatment and knew they
    needed a union to make changes.&quot; </p>
    <p>The story at Tyson is typical not only of the indignities
    suffered by thousands of poultry workers in nonunion plants,
    but of the bullying tactics that businesses use to thwart
    union efforts. </p>
    <p>&quot;Poultry workers are the most exploited workers in
    this country,&quot; said RWDSU President Lenore Miller.
    &quot;We have been organizing poultry workers for many years,
    and unfortunately, the same problems exist.&quot; </p>
    <p>Tyson's corporate behavior was &quot;pretty obscene,&quot;
    RWDSU Secretary-Treasurer Stuart Appelbaum said. Injured
    workers were forced to &quot;return to the line,&quot;
    sometimes dripping human blood on the chicken. Restroom
    breaks were limited to one seven-minute slot a day, forcing
    workers to urinate while standing on line. Female workers
    were subjected to sexual harassment from supervisors, he
    said. </p>
    <p>&quot;I think the catalyst was the absentee policy,&quot;
    said RWDSU's David Mertz. &quot;The policy went from all
    workers having to bring a doctor's note for excused absences
    to no excuses, including medical reasons, for some employees. </p>
    <p>I think this just hit people that while the old policy was
    lousy, the new policy wasn't being administered fairly or
    equally.&quot; </p>
    <p>Outside the plant, the company was just as busy making
    life unpleasant for the workers by trying to solicit the
    community into joining their anti-union stance. </p>
    <p>There are no other unionized plants in Cleveland and, in
    the anti-union South, Tyson was able to scare many in the
    community with threats that the plant would close if the
    union came in. They had people call the workers and tell them
    not to support the union, Hicks said. </p>
    <p>But the workers refused to be cowed. One worker was in the
    beauty parlor when someone warned that she would lose her job
    if she supported the union. &quot;The worker told her, `well,
    I support the union,' &quot; Hicks said. </p>
    <p>Tyson was less successful with the religious community,
    which was asked to sign on to an anti-union ad. But two
    prominent ministers refused to sign the ad, saying they
    wanted to talk to the workers. Later, they advised plant
    managers to &quot;throw the ads in the garbage,&quot; she
    said. </p>

    <p align="center"><font size="4"><strong>Unions fight
    corporate scofflaws<br>
    </strong></font>by<br>
    Muriel H. Cooper </p>
    <p>AFL-CIO President John J. Sweeney delivered a clear and
    unequivocal message that unions will fight back against
    employers who break the law in efforts to stave off workers'
    desire for a union. </p>
    <p>Sweeney was in Everett, Mass., for an Oct. 7 rally to
    support workers at Richmark International, a curtain maker
    that in September fired five employees who signed union
    authorization cards and laid off three more for distributing
    union literature before work. </p>
    <p>About 40 workers responded in a show of solidarity and an
    unfair labor practice strike on Sept. 20. They are seeking to
    organize under the UNITE banner. </p>
    <p>&quot;We're here to bear witness to a simple truth:
    organizing a union is your right,&quot; Sweeney said.
    &quot;Firing working people for organizing unions is wrong.
    As long as workers are fired for an injustice, we are going
    to be fired up for justice.&quot; </p>
    <p>Sweeney joined a march with the workers and community
    leaders, then told the rally that &quot;Richmark workers,
    like thousands of other workers in the nation, are trying to
    improve their lives, their families and their
    communities.&quot; </p>
    <p>&quot;It is wrong for the big foot of business to try and
    crush them,&quot; he said. &quot;From here on out, organized
    labor says to Richmark and companies like them: `We will
    fight you whether it's in Everett or Birmingham, Akron or
    Spokane.' &quot; </p>
    <p>The workers, mostly immigrant Latino women, sew curtains
    for such stores as J.C. Penney's, Filene's Basement and
    Sears. Most of the workers have not received a raise in nine
    years, are timed by supervisors when they go to the bathroom
    and can't afford health insurance. </p>
    <p>&quot;Richmark International is a perfect example of how
    workers' rights are trampled when they try to exercise their
    democratic right to join a union,&quot; said Robin Clark,
    UNITE's organizing director for the Northeast. </p>
    <p>The union also has asked the state attorney general to
    investigate the company for homework violations. </p>
    <p>&quot;First off, the company doesn't have a homework
    permit,&quot; Clark said. &quot;Then they are sending work
    home and paying workers between $1.50 and $3 per pound. It
    usually takes a couple of hours just to sew a pound.&quot; </p>

    <p>On Broadway, the curtain is going up on a drama that
    audiences don't get a chance to see. </p>
    <p>UNITE is telling theater-goers that, while Broadway
    producers and theater owners enjoy record ticket sales, the
    workers who make costumes are working without health

    <p>In an industry that is largely unionized, only half of the
    approximately 800 costume makers have union protections.
    These costume makers have lower wages and fewer benefits than
    any other skilled worker in the theatrical industry. </p>
    <p>&quot;The companies belonging to the League of American
    Theaters and Producers should take responsibility for the
    conditions under which costumes for their shows are
    made,&quot; the union said. </p>
    <p>The union has been leafleting outside Broadway theaters
    and other theaters around the country. </p>

    by<br>
    Colleen M. O'Neill </p>
    <p>Union working women vote -- and if unions do their work
    this year, they'll bring their sisters, mothers and friends
    along to the polls. </p>
    <p>The AFL-CIO and 9to5, the National Association of Working
    Women, cosponsored more than 250 activities nationwide Oct.
    4-11 to kick off get-out-the-vote efforts aimed at turning
    out working women Nov. 5. Numerous surveys show the women's
    vote will be the deciding factor at the polls, and unions,
    community-based organizations, women's groups and religious
    leaders are reaching out to those potential voters throughout
    October. </p>
    <p>Low-income women without college degrees will be
    especially crucial at the polls, said Karen Nussbaum,
    director of the AFL- CIO's Working Women's Department.
    &quot;They are the most volatile group politically and are
    angry their concerns are not being heard,&quot; she said. </p>
    <p>Union members are going into grocery stores or shopping
    malls, day care centers, union halls and union worksites,
    during lunch breaks and after work, to urge their sisters to
    vote on issues important to working families -- higher pay,
    real family values, fairness and respect on the job,
    Medicare, pensions, education and family leave. </p>
    <p>In Columbus, Ohio, a voter registration drive through four
    local supermarkets signed up 800 voters. </p>
    <p>Working women rallied in Atlanta, Denver, Boston,
    Milwaukee and other cities. Women pledging to vote received a
    piece of cake - - and a piece of the action -- courtesy of
    members of the Bakery, Confectionery and Tobacco Workers. </p>
    <p>AFL-CIO Executive Vice President Linda Chavez-Thompson,
    UNITE and other union members rallied in Philadelphia around
    the theme of &quot;Don't Get Hung Out to Dry -- Vote!!!&quot;
    Secretary-Treasurer Richard L. Trumka participated in a rally
    in Minnesota. </p>
    <p>Members of the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store
    Union, in partnership with the New York Hispanic Labor
    Committee, spent the week at the subway stop serving
    Bloomingdale's flagship New York City store registering
    working women and urging them to vote. </p>
    <p>First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton took up the cause in
    Chicago, while Second Lady Tipper Gore addressed women in
    Pennsylvania. </p>
    <p>Events also included door and &quot;desk&quot; knocking,
    kitchen table discussion groups, news conferences, meetings,
    phone banks, mailings, &quot;corner waves&quot; at busy
    intersections and many others. </p>

    by<br>
    Colleen M. O'Neill </p>
    <p>Republican attempts to undermine job safety and health
    failed in the 104th Congress. </p>
    <p>The Occupational Safety and Health Act and Mine Safety and
    Health Act remain intact; OSHA, MSHA and National Institute
    of Occupational Safety and Health funding has been maintained
    or increased; and a prohibition on OSHA efforts to develop an
    ergonomics standard or guidelines has been lifted. </p>
    <p>For fiscal 1997, OSHA's budget has been increased $22
    million to $325 million, MSHA's budget is up by $2 million to
    $197 million and NIOSH's funding is up by $53 million to
    $173.5 million (including money transferred from the defunct
    Bureau of Mines). </p>
    <p>However, the GOP can claim one victory -- the passage of
    the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act, which
    gives small business special consideration in the
    establishment of regulations and increased rights in the
    enforcement process. The measure provides for congressional
    review and disapproval of new final regulations, politicizing
    the standard-setting process and setting up future safety and
    health battles. </p>
    <p>&quot;Reform&quot; initiatives put forth by Rep. Cass
    Ballenger (R-N.C.) and Sens. Judd Gregg (R-N.H.) and Nancy L.
    Kassebaum (R-Kan.) went nowhere, while a sweeping regulatory
    reform measure -- part of the Republicans' &quot;Contract On
    America&quot; -- was passed in the House but died in the
    Senate. </p>

    <p align="center"><font size="4"><strong>Bridgestone calls
    most back USWA fight will continueon unfair labor practices<br>
    </strong></font>by<br>
    James B. Parks </p>
    <p>Under pressure from the Steelworkers' corporate campaign,
    Bridgestone/Firestone has called virtually all the former
    strikers back to work. </p>
    <p>That was the good news announced Sept. 24 by John Sellers,
    newly elected executive vice president of USWA's
    Rubber/Plastics Industry Conference, formerly the Rubber
    Workers. </p>
    <p>&quot;The continuing bad news is that up to 150 workers
    remain off the job because they were fired on trumped-up
    strike-related charges or as part of a long-standing
    harassment campaign against union members,&quot; Sellers
    said. That means the union's campaign will continue, he said. </p>
    <p>The rest of the 2,300 workers illegally &quot;permanently
    replaced&quot; in 1994 by the Japanese-owned tire maker are
    back on the job, or have been notified to return to work, he
    said. The USWA and Bridgestone/Firestone have been unable to
    reach agreement on a contract since July 1994, when 4,000
    workers walked off the job. The workers suspended the strike
    after 10 months. </p>
    <p>Other unresolved issues include securing a fair contract,
    gaining millions of dollars in back pay the company owes the
    strikers under National Labor Relations Board rulings and
    settling the company's unfair labor practices, which the NLRB
    says prolonged the strike. </p>
    <p>&quot;We are more sure than ever of justice for the men
    and women who courageously struck this international renegade
    because of unfair labor practices more than two years
    ago,&quot; Sellers said. &quot;So while our campaign clearly
    is working, it is far from over, and we are once again
    turning up the pressure.&quot; </p>
    <p>USWA members at Bridgestone/Firestone plants in the United
    States now are working without a contract under
    company-imposed work rules. In addition, the union members
    are being harassed by &quot;replacement&quot; workers and
    false company charges that led to firings, Sellers said. </p>
    <p>Workers at the Decatur, Ill., plant are working 12-hour
    shifts, first in a three-day week, then a four-day week, with
    erratic changes between day and night shifts, said Roger
    Gates, president of USWA Local 713. &quot;People don't know
    whether they're coming or going, or what day of the week it
    is,&quot; he said. </p>
    <p>The USWA is conducting an international &quot;black
    flag&quot; campaign against the Japanese-owned tire maker.
    The black flag is the traditional racing symbol for
    disqualifying a car for outrageous rules violations. The
    USWA's &quot;black flag&quot; campaign is asking consumers
    not to buy Bridgestone/Firestone products or services until
    all workers are returned to work with back wages and a fair
    contract is negotiated. </p>
    <p>The campaign's successful pressure includes frequent union
    handbilling of customers at 140 Bridgestone-owned MasterCare
    centers in the United States and Canada. It has spawned
    resolutions by 31 local governments, including Atlanta, to
    stop buying the company's products and refusals to sell
    Bridgestone tires by many dealers, including the largest
    dealer in New Orleans. </p>
    <p>In addition, Saturn has agreed to replace Firestone tires
    on its new cars with another brand at the request of buyers. </p>

    <p align="center"><font size="4"><strong>&#160;Ford, Chrysler
    pacts reached; UAW, GM talk CAW strikes GM Canada;ripple felt
    in U.S. layoffs</strong></font><br>
    by<br>
    James B. Parks and Mike Hall </p>
    <p>UAW members overwhelmingly ratified a new contract with
    Ford Motor Co. the same day the union reached a tentative
    agreement with Chrysler Corp. patterned on the Ford deal. </p>
    <p>The Chrysler pact was approved by the union's Chrysler
    Council Oct. 3 and was voted on by the membership in
    balloting that ended Oct 13. Talks are under way with General
    Motors Corp., but they have been slowed because of the
    Canadian Auto Workers' strike against General Motors Ltd. of
    Canada. </p>
    <p>As a result of the Canadian shutdown, GM temporarily laid
    off about 1,800 workers at a Michigan transmission plant and
    a New York engine factory. If the CAW strike continues, more
    layoffs likely are in store. </p>
    <p>The three-year Ford pact was approved by 90 percent of the
    production workers and 83 percent of skilled trades workers,
    who voted separately. </p>
    <p>&quot;Obviously, the breakthroughs achieved by the union
    on job security, higher wages, retirement income gains,
    tuition assistance benefits and other improvements were
    factors in the strong, favorable vote,&quot; said UAW
    President Stephen P. Yokich and Vice President Ernest Lofton,
    director of the union's Ford Department. </p>
    <p>The three-year Ford and Chrysler contracts include
    expanded job security protections -- which provide a
    guaranteed minimum employment floor of 95 percent of current
    covered jobs -- incentives to keep work in plant and creation
    of new jobs. </p>
    <p>Wages are increased substantially through an up-front,
    lump- sum payment of $2,000, followed by a 3 percent wage
    increase in the last two years, cost-of-living allowance
    protection and Christmas bonuses of up to $600 each. </p>
    <p>In addition to substantial improvements in basic pension
    plan benefits, the union negotiated lump-sum payments for
    retirees that will protect against inflation. </p>
    <p>Workers will be able to receive employer-paid tuition
    assistance of up to $1,000 a year for dependent children
    enrolled in college or any other approved post-secondary
    education. Retirees also can receive $1,000 a year if they
    enroll in courses on site at locations from which they
    retired. </p>

    <p align="center"><font size="4"><strong>NABET uses media
    savvy in local TV contract fights</strong></font><br>
    by<br>
    Colleen M. O'Neill </p>
    <p>Television industry employees used to working behind the
    scenes increasingly are finding themselves in the forefront,
    making noise and progress in labor disputes across the
    country. </p>
    <p>Media-savvy locals of the Communication Workers' Broadcast
    Employees and Technicians in New York and California gained
    settlements after getting their messages into the community
    despite a virtual electronic media blackout of their
    disputes, while locals in New Mexico and Michigan are using
    similar tactics. </p>
    <p>Off-camera workers at Buffalo, N.Y.'s WIVB-TV, members of
    NABET-CWA Local 25, approved a new three-year contract after
    a six- month campaign to get viewers and advertisers to
    boycott the station. The new contract boosts starting pay to
    $400 a week from $268 and adds dental and eyeglass coverage
    to medical benefits. </p>
    <p>Workers handbilled outside Rich Stadium and used flyovers
    of Buffalo Bills' games with banners that said: &quot;Turn
    Off News 4 -- It's Bad News for Its Workers.&quot; Bus
    shelter signs also kept the campaign in the public eye. </p>
    <p>The most recent ratings reflect the effectiveness of the
    union's campaign, as the station fell from its first-place
    position in the spring rankings. </p>
    <p>The protracted fight also resulted in a Federal
    Communications Commission complaint after all of Buffalo's
    radio stations declined to run the NABET-CWA boycott message,
    and National Labor Relations Board charges after an incident
    between the station's sales manager and union employees
    handbilling outside an advertiser's business. </p>
    <p>In California, members of NABET-CWA Local 53 won an 11
    percent wage increase, more vacation and improved medical and
    benefits eligibility in a three-year pact with the National
    Captioning Institute. The nonprofit NCI had been insisting on
    a wage freeze and a cut in shift differential pay for the
    workers, who produce the closed captioning service used by
    the deaf and hard-of-hearing on network, cable and syndicated
    television programming. </p>
    <p>Meanwhile, an advertisers' boycott and a &quot;Turn Off
    10&quot; campaign at McGraw-Hill-owned KGTV in San Diego
    culminated in a new three-year contract for Local 54. </p>
    <p>The pact features an 11 percent pay raise over term,
    additional holiday and vacation leave for temporary workers
    -- and jurisdiction for work on video file servers, Internet
    and at the company's new cable operation, News Channel 15. </p>
    <p>Local 407 in Albuquerque, N.M., has been seeking a first
    contract for a year with Pulitzer-owned KOAT-TV, and has
    gained community support by wiring around the local broadcast
    media with news conferences, picketing and letters to
    advertisers. A federal mediator is trying to facilitate a
    settlement. </p>
    <p>In the Motor City, where newspaper workers at the Detroit
    News and Free Press also are locked in a labor struggle,
    members of NABET-CWA Local 43 are pushing aggressive viewer
    and advertising boycotts of WJBK-TV, and have distributed
    more than 10,000 buttons and bumper strips that read
    &quot;Turn-off Fox TV2.&quot; </p>

    <p>Some 4,500 Steelworkers walked off the job Oct. 1 at eight
    Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel plants after the company refused to
    bring its pension plan near industry standards, sought to
    subcontract jobs and eliminate workers' current health plan. </p>
    <p>Pickets remain up at plants throughout Ohio, West Virginia
    and Pennsylvania. </p>
    <p>USWA negotiators are seeking a defined pension plan paying
    retirees $40 per month per year of service. But the company,
    which currently has pension costs about one-quarter of that
    of other steelmakers, wants a risky defined contribution plan
    with benefits based on the investment performance of its
    pension funds. </p>
    <p>While the company claims its pension proposal would pay
    retirees between $1,200 and $1,600 a month, only 200 of the
    4,500- member work force would qualify for those pension
    levels. </p>
    <p>The company also wants to outsource work, including
    production work, and eliminate all non-steelmaking jobs, such
    as crane operators, janitors and nurses. </p>
    <p>The company proposed eliminating the current health
    insurance plan and replacing it with a managed health care
    plan that not only would raise costs but would limit workers'
    choice of doctors and prescription drugs. </p>
    <p><a name="Peace on the rails ">Peace on the rails </a></p>
    <p>A dozen railroad unions and 35 major freight carriers have
    reached agreement on five-year contracts covering some
    145,000 workers nationwide, marking the first time in nearly
    a decade accord was reached without strikes or imposed
    settlements. </p>
    <p>The bargaining was far from uneventful, however, with the
    creation of three presidential emergency boards, intensive
    mediation, several voluntary agreements and an arbitration
    award. Still out for ratification is a tentative agreement
    between the National Carriers' Conference Committee and the
    Firemen and Oilers, while the American Train Dispatcher
    Department, a division of the Brotherhood of Locomotive
    Engineers, remains in negotiations. </p>
    <p><a name="ILA ratifies contract ">ILA ratifies contract </a></p>
    <p>Longshoremen on the East and Gulf Coasts approved a
    five-year master agreement Oct. 2 that calls for a $4-an-hour
    pay increase over the life of the contract. </p>
    <p>The master agreement covers wages, hours, duration and
    employer contributions to the health and pension funds.
    Workers will immediately receive a $2-an-hour increase,
    followed by $1-an- hour raises in 1998 and 2000. Employer
    contributions to the health and welfare and pension funds
    will increase by 96 cents an hour by the end of the contract. </p>
    <p>Other provisions include flextime arrangements, lower pay
    for new hires and a reduction in gang size required per
    container. Both sides agreed to move to an industrywide
    managed health system by 1999. </p>
    <p><a name="ILWU pact approved">ILWU pact approved</a> </p>
    <p>On the West Coast, Longshoremen and Warehousemen approved
    a three-year contract calling for a $3-an-hour pay raise over
    the term of the pact for 8,000 dockworkers in 26 ports. </p>
    <p>Skill rate differentials increased, as did the maximum
    pension benefit for future retirees. The ILWU held on to
    current levels of benefits including medical, dental and
    vision. The contract is retroactive to June 29. </p>
    <p>The vote was the second on the agreement. In the first
    vote, 52 percent of the members approved the contract, but
    the vote fell short of a majority in two of the eight ILWU
    voting districts, Los Angeles and San Francisco. In order to
    protect the interests of minority groups of workers, union
    rules require a second vote with a 60 percent approval rate. </p>
    <p><a name="IBT gets first contract ">IBT gets first contract </a></p>
    <p>By an 84 percent majority, more than 750 pilots and flight
    engineers at American Trans Air Inc., represented by the
    Teamsters, ratified their first contract. </p>
    <p>The agreement provides a 7.5 percent raise over four
    years, the first pay boost since 1990. It also sets up more
    clearly defined scheduling procedures. </p>
    <p>Crews voted for IBT representation in 1993, and in 1995,
    turned down a tentative agreement by a 3-1 margin. Don
    Treichler, an IBT representative, said the crews wanted pay
    and scheduling improvements. </p>
    <p>The Indianapolis-based airline serves Boston, Chicago,
    Detroit, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Seattle, Las Vegas,
    Phoenix and other cities. </p>

    <p align="center">&#160;<font size="4"><strong>IAM seeks
    strength in numbers<br>
    </strong></font>by<br>
    James B. Parks </p>
    <p>Chicago </p>
    <p>In a landmark convention, the Machinists charted an
    innovative new course for the future that includes growth and
    solidarity, more emphasis on organizing and political action. </p>
    <p>The delegates approved a resolution &quot;wholeheartedly
    endorsing and supporting&quot; the proposed unification of
    the IAM with the UAW and Steelworkers to create the
    second-largest industrial union in the world. </p>
    <p>In his keynote, IAM President George Kourpias
    distinguished the development as a unification, rather than a
    merger, noting that &quot;we will be drafting an entirely new
    constitution that will guide an entirely new union into a new
    century.&quot; The three unions already have begun
    cooperative efforts. </p>
    <p>&quot;Strength and power, that's what this unification is
    all about,&quot; USWA President George Becker told the
    convention before the vote. &quot;This is not a unification
    being forged out of weakness. Each union is a strong union;
    each is rich in resources and capabilities.&quot; </p>
    <p>&quot;The trade union movement is a social movement,&quot;
    said Paul Masseron, assistant to UAW President Stephen P.
    Yokich. &quot;This is about the future of our country. This
    is about whether Wall Street gets to decide everything or
    whether workers have some say in our destiny.&quot; </p>
    <p>The delegates also tackled the sticky question of how to
    improve and expand member services and how to pay for them.
    The proposal on the floor was a constitutional change
    reducing the mandated strike fund contribution from 20
    percent of monthly per capita to 5 percent in 1997 and 10
    percent in 1999. The money saved, $22.6 million the first two
    years and $7.5 million each year thereafter, would be used
    for organizing, communications, education and other services. </p>
    <p>&quot;If we want to be `The Union for the 21st Century
    (the convention motto),' we need to make some changes,&quot;
    said delegate Bob Klepper of Lodge 733. &quot;We need to do
    more organizing. We need some more staff.&quot; </p>
    <p>Ultimately, the delegates agreed with Frank Souza of Lodge
    1414, who declared, &quot;Like all unions, we are losing
    members and we're losing money. And we're running out of
    options. We can either lay off staff, reduce our programs,
    raise our dues -- or adopt this amendment.&quot; They adopted
    the amendment by a 2-1 margin. </p>
    <p>Recognizing the growing role of women in the workplace and
    in the union, the delegates unanimously approved creation of
    a Women's Department to educate members on the needs and
    problems of working women, and to train and encourage more
    women to take leading roles at all levels of the union. </p>
    <p>Earlier in the week, Coalition of Labor Union Women
    President Gloria Johnson urged the convention to organize
    women and to help all working women. &quot;It's a disgrace
    that in this country, where nearly 60 million women are
    working, only 8 million belong to trade unions or
    associations,&quot; said Johnson, a vice president of the
    AFL- CIO and the Electronic Workers. </p>
    <p>But in an election year, most of the talk was about
    politics. The delegates endorsed President Clinton and Vice
    President Gore for re-election. Appearing via satellite,
    Clinton pledged to continue to fight to protect workers'
    right to strike. </p>
    <p>AFL-CIO President John J. Sweeney and a host of other
    speakers urged the union to vote like workers and to win in
    November. This year is &quot;the year that we either take
    back control of our country or allow the radical right, the
    new right and the not quite right to tighten their grip on
    the soul of our nation,&quot; Sweeney said. </p>
    <p>Secretary-Treasurer Richard L. Trumka challenged the
    delegates to take the fight &quot;out of the suites and back
    to the streets&quot; to win economic justice and social
    dignity for workers and their families. </p>
    <p>House Minority Leader Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.) promised
    a worker-friendly agenda if Democrats regain control of
    Congress in November. The centerpiece of that new agenda
    would be to keep good- paying jobs in America. &quot;A good
    job lies at the foundation of everything we care about in
    this country,&quot; he said. </p>
    <p>Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich offered a &quot;simple
    solution&quot; to deal with those in Washington who
    &quot;don't want worker safety, minimum wages, education, job
    training and who don't like unions. There's a simple
    solution. Send them home.&quot; </p>
    <p>Other speakers included Federal Mediation and Conciliation
    Service Director John Calhoun Wells; Canadian Labor Council
    President Bob White; Alexa McDonough, leader of Canada's New
    Democratic Party; and Bill Press, co-host of CNN's Crossfire. </p>

    <p align="center"><font size="4"><strong>LIUNA pledges
    organizing, sets election</strong></font><br>
    by<br>
    Sharolyn A. Rosier </p>
    <p>Las Vegas </p>
    <p>Delegates to the Laborers 21st convention recommitted the
    union to massive organizing efforts and prepared for the
    first election of LIUNA's top officers by rank-and-file
    members. </p>
    <p>&quot;To meet the mandate of this convention in
    organizing, we will pour in reinforcements to the greatest
    organizing campaign ever waged,&quot; LIUNA President Arthur
    A. Coia told the delegates. &quot;We must ensure that all
    workers have basic human rights, dignity and respect.&quot; </p>
    <p>The convention passed resolutions calling for greater use
    of volunteer organizers, expanding a program to organize
    nonunion contractors and establishing regional organizing
    branches. </p>
    <p>Using member organizers in &quot;whole market&quot;
    campaigns in New York City, the union has signed up most of
    the asbestos abatement and demolition workers in the city.
    Member organizers also have been instrumental in providing
    union benefits to poultry workers in North Carolina and
    environmental remediation workers in California. </p>
    <p>AFL-CIO President John J. Sweeney applauded LIUNA's
    organizing efforts. &quot;With commitments like yours, we're
    going to keep winning contract battles and we're going to win
    at the ballot boxes in November, because labor is indeed
    back.&quot; </p>
    <p>In its first secret-ballot election, delegates nominated
    Coia and Bruno Caruso, president of Local 1001 in Chicago, to
    appear on the ballot for president, which will go to the
    general membership from Nov. 2 through Dec. 16. </p>
    <p>Secretary-Treasurer R.P. &quot;Bud&quot; Vinall was
    renominated without opposition and so won a full term in
    office to run through 2001. </p>
    <p>Secretary of Transportation Federico Pena addressed the
    delegates via live satellite link and read a message from
    President Clinton, who thanked the union members for playing
    a key role in making the nation stronger. Clinton's message
    ticked off a number of Republican efforts against working
    families that were turned back this year, including attempts
    to repeal the Davis-Bacon Act, gut the Occupational Safety
    and Health Act, and allow &quot;legal company unions.&quot; </p>
    <p>Other speakers included Bob White, president of the
    Canadian Labour Congress; Martin Maddaloni, president of the
    Plumbers and Pipefitters; Robert A. Georgine, president of
    the AFL-CIO Building and Construction Trades Department;
    former Democratic vice presidential nominee Geraldine
    Ferraro; film and television actress Pamela Reed, the
    daughter of LIUNA's secretary-treasurer; Olympic gold
    medalist Matt Biondi; Nevada Gov. Bob Miller; and Las Vegas
    Mayor Jan Jones. </p>
    <p>Addressing the convention via satellite or video were:
    Reps. Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo), David E. Bonior (D-Mich.)
    and William Clay (D-Mo), and Sen. Edward M. Kennedy
    (D-Mass.). &#160;</p>

    <p align="center"><font size="4"><strong>Labor
    teach-inrekindles bond with academia <br>
    Enthusiasm for issues of workers spills over<br>
    </strong></font>by<br>
    Colleen M. O'Neill </p>
    <p>A rebounding labor movement and a newly interested
    academic community bridged a chasm of two generations'
    duration with a huge, overflow crowd in attendance at a
    teach-in at Columbia University. </p>
    <p>Lines stretched several blocks as nearly 2,000 people
    gathered for the Oct. 3 opening of &quot;The Fight for
    America's Future: A Teach- In with the Labor Movement,&quot;
    packing the Law Library, a spillover hall and the area
    outside the event. </p>
    <p>During the first half of the 20th century, labor and
    intellectuals were allied on behalf of social justice,
    democracy in the workplace and the economic well-being of
    working Americans. That compact disintegrated during the
    Vietnam War years. </p>
    <p>&quot;Here's the truth: when faced with a changing culture
    as well as a changing economy, the labor movement hunkered
    down,&quot; said AFL- CIO President John J. Sweeney.
    &quot;Relationships torn apart in the 1960s and '70s went
    unrepaired. The labor movement became isolated and
    introverted, concerned more with our own deepening crisis
    than with the world around us. </p>
    <p>My brothers and sisters, workers and their unions need
    you, and you need us,&quot; he said. &quot;We need your help
    in making basic economic education available and accessible
    to every American, so everyone can understand what is
    happening to their family budget and who is doing it to them. </p>
    <p>We need your help in exposing the flaws of our
    society,&quot; Sweeney said. &quot;While it takes a village
    to raise a child, it takes a union to get a raise.&quot; </p>
    <p>Helping Sweeney open the historic convocation were
    feminist author Betty Friedan, Harvard theologian Cornel
    West, University of Virginia philosopher Richard Rorty,
    Columbia University historian Eric Foner and Columbia
    University law professor Patricia Williams. </p>
    <p>AFL-CIO Secretary-Treasurer Richard L. Trumka, Executive
    Vice President Linda Chavez-Thompson, and several federation
    department leaders participated in sessions held Oct. 4 at
    the New York City campus. Workshop topics included
    immigration, the globalized economy, organizing among
    African-Americans, welfare and work, families and feminism,
    labor political action and culture, identity and class
    politics. </p>
    <p>Other teach-ins will be held throughout October. They are
    designed not only to renew ties between academe and unions,
    but also to teach students about the labor movement and get
    students and professors to use their talents to help working
    Americans. </p>
    <p>Events are planned at Wayne State University, Detroit;
    University of Cincinnati; Clinch Valley College, Wise, Va.;
    University of Nevada, Las Vegas; Eastern Illinois University,
    Charleston, Ill.; University of Texas at El Paso; University
    of Florida, Tallahassee; University of Wisconsin, Madison;
    and State University of New York-Geneseo. </p>

    <p>At the request of the Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers,
    Crown Central Petroleum has been added to the AFL-CIO boycott
    list. </p>
    <p>Last February, Crown's managers escorted all 250 members
    of OCAW Local 4-227 from its oil refinery in Pasadena, Texas,
    while the union and the company continued to bargain. These
    workers remain locked out, with Crown citing the pretext of
    &quot;sabotage&quot; and the &quot;unsuccessful status of
    negotiations,&quot; according to the union. </p>
    <p>However, the day after the lockout began, Crown stated in
    a letter to the union that &quot;when you accept our
    proposal, we will end the lockout.&quot; </p>
    <p><a name="Ohio on the march ">Ohio on the march </a></p>
    <p>Ohio trade unionists will consider a statewide work
    stoppage and march on Columbus to protest anti-worker
    initiatives in Congress and the Ohio General assembly. The
    Ohio AFL-CIO convention approved forming a committee to draw
    up plans. </p>
    <p>Some 900 delegates to the convention capped off the
    gathering's first day in Cincinnati with a march and rally
    protesting the privatization of that city's only public
    hospital. The march was led by state fed President Bill
    Burga, AFL-CIO Executive Vice President Linda Chavez-Thompson
    and the Rev. Jesse L. Jackson. </p>
    <p>Delegates also signaled approval of a ballot initiative
    for riverboat gambling in four locations, but only if such a
    move would not cut funding for public schools and if workers
    are allowed to exercise their rights to join unions and
    bargain. </p>
    <p><a name="Illinois rallies for votes ">Illinois rallies for

    <p>November elections were front and center at the Illinois
    AFL- CIO convention in Chicago, as AFL-CIO
    Secretary-Treasurer Richard L. Trumka urged delegates to work
    exhaustively to elect labor- friendly representatives. </p>
    <p>&quot;We can have that workers' victory, from the
    courthouses to the statehouses to the White House, if you
    make a commitment in this important political year,&quot;
    Trumka said. </p>
    <p>Food and Commercial Workers President Douglas H. Dority
    called for using an issues-oriented approach to the election
    and beyond. &quot;We must see our efforts for victory in
    November as a starting point, as a first step in our
    long-term effort to revitalize the labor movement.&quot; </p>
    <p><a name="Sweeney: Do right ">Sweeney: Do right </a></p>
    <p>The November election is about &quot;taking back control
    of our country or giving it away to the radical right, the
    new right and the not-quite-so right,&quot; AFL-CIO President
    John J. Sweeney told the 210 delegates at the Nevada AFL-CIO
    convention. </p>
    <p>He urged delegates to pledge 30 hours of their time to
    work for candidates they believe in and who support such
    working family issues as Medicare, Social Security,
    education, workplace health and safety, labor laws and
    American jobs. </p>
    <p>The convention re-elected Claude &quot;Blackie&quot; Evans
    as executive secretary-treasurer and Walt Elliot as
    president. Delegates also approved a $5,000 donation to
    striking Frontier Hotel workers who entered their fifth year
    on the picket lines last month -- the longest-running strike
    in the United States. </p>
    <p><a name="N.Y. re-elects top officers ">N.Y. re-elects top
    officers </a></p>
    <p>New York State AFL-CIO President Edward J. Cleary and
    Secretary-Treasurer Paul F. Cole won unanimous re-election to
    new four-year terms by the 1,000 delegates to the
    federation's 28th constitutional convention. </p>
    <p>Meeting under the theme &quot;one movement, one voice, one
    agenda,&quot; the convention heard from AFL-CIO President
    John J. Sweeney, House Minority Leader Richard A. Gephardt
    (D-Mo.), Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-N.Y.), various state
    politicians, Transport Workers President Sonny Hall and
    several AFL-CIO department leaders. </p>
    <p>After much vociferous discussion, delegates made
    endorsements in 27 of 31 congressional races. In addition,
    participants attended a variety of workshops on such topics
    as political participation, organizing, union label, the
    economy, health care, job safety, education and retirement
    planning. </p>

    <p align="center"><font size="4"><strong>Worker issues front
    and center Labor '96 puts stamp on political campaign</strong><br>
    </font>by <br>
    Michael Byrne</p>
    <p>Chicago </p>
    <p>More than 800 AFL-CIO union delegates to the Democratic
    National Convention helped launch President Clinton's
    campaign for a second term, putting the issues of working
    families squarely at the front of the national debate. </p>
    <p>In the first address by an AFL-CIO president to a
    political party convention, John J. Sweeney spoke plainly
    about the political aspirations of millions of working
    families. </p>
    <p>&quot;They don't want to run the Congress, or the White
    House or the political parties,&quot; he said. &quot;They
    want to be compensated and respected for the contributions
    they make. They want to send their children to decent
    schools. They want to go to a safe workplace every day. They
    want a doctor when they need one, a little rest when they are
    weary, and a pension after a lifetime of work.&quot; </p>
    <p>Delegates punctuated Sweeney's speech with chants of
    &quot;America Needs A Raise,&quot; waving signs that also
    called for Good Jobs, Secure Pensions, Health Care and
    Education. Demonstrations on these worker issues were held
    throughout the convention, which contrasted the Democratic
    Party's stands with the clearly anti-worker agenda put
    forward by the Newt Gingrich-led Congress and adopted by the
    Republican Party at its convention earlier in San Diego. </p>
    <p>At a meeting of labor delegates before the convention
    opened, Vice President Gore thanked union members for their
    support and said pointedly, &quot;We are on your side. We
    need to stick together because the stakes have never been
    higher.&quot; </p>
    <p>While national media attention was drawn here for the
    nomination of Clinton and Gore, the real story was unfolding
    in congressional districts across the country, where Labor
    '96 coordinators were mobilizing union members to get out and
    vote to reverse the anti-worker tide in Congress. <a
    href="labor96.htm">(See story, Page 3)</a>.</p>
    <p>The grass-roots effort this year is paying special
    attention to working women, who have been ignored too often
    in the past. The federation's Working Women Vote '96 project,
    organized by the Working Women's Department along with 9to5,
    a nonpartisan organization, will be reaching out to all
    working women during a nationwide action week Oct. 4-11. </p>
    <p>&quot;Women are the key swing constituency this
    year,&quot; said Karen Nussbaum, who heads the department.
    &quot;In 1992, the women's vote was a deciding factor in the
    election. But in 1994, women didn't turn out, particularly
    low-income working women. We want to mobilize these women to
    vote in 1996.&quot; </p>
    <p>The centerpiece of the campaign is reaching out to women
    where they spend most of their time -- in grocery stores or
    shopping malls, at day care centers, in union halls and at
    union worksites. Voter registration/GOTV events will be held
    in about 100 communities with about 10,000 women activists
    participating nationwide. </p>
    <p>&quot;These women are union members and their best
    friends,&quot; Nussbaum said. &quot;White-collar and
    blue-collar women. No-collar, no- income women who cook,
    clean and care for the kids so the husband can work two jobs.
    Retired, and just plain tired. They've been left out of the
    political process.&quot; </p>
    <p>Special activities by unions during Working Women Vote
    week include the Bakery, Confectionery and Tobacco Workers'
    plan to provide cake they will hand out to women during lunch
    hour if they register or sign a pledge to vote. And the
    Flight Attendants have launched an unprecedented push to
    register their members. </p>
    <p>Labor '96, which was launched at a special convention in
    March with a $35 million pledge by AFL-CIO unions, is
    underscored by television and radio ads in selected
    congressional districts aimed at persuading legislators to
    change their positions on issues of importance to working
    families. </p>
    <p>In Chicago, Sweeney unveiled a new round of ads in 27
    districts where the incumbents had voted to slash Medicare,
    and then &quot;falsely claimed Medicare benefits would
    increase under their proposals.&quot; The federation also
    launched ads in selected districts highlighting legislators'
    votes against the student loan program. </p>
    <p>These messages, combined with earlier ads on the minimum
    wage and pensions, have incensed Republican Party officials,
    who have filed a series of nuisance complaints with the
    Federal Election Commission and sent threatening letters to
    television and radio stations running AFL-CIO ads. That is a
    sure sign the federation's campaign is on target, Sweeney
    said. </p>
    <p>Five FEC complaints have been filed since the federation
    announced its campaign in March. Sweeney dismissed them as an
    effort by the Republican leadership &quot;to distract public
    attention from their poor record on working family
    issues.&quot; </p>
    <p>&quot;The other side is not very happy,&quot; Labor
    Secretary Robert B. Reich told labor delegates before the
    convention got under way, &quot;and it's a credit to your
    campaign to expose the voting record of the Newt Gingrich-Bob
    Dole Congress. </p>
    <p>When Gingrich's `Contract With America' was unveiled,
    unions were the only people who stood up and were
    counted,&quot; Reich said. &quot;You have reminded them that
    the paycheck is the most important family value.&quot; </p>
    <p>That was the role of union delegates to the convention,
    Sweeney said. &quot;As labor delegates and representatives
    from America's unions, our central mission will be to
    persistently and consistently raise the issues our members
    care about most -- jobs and the economy, health care,
    retirement and pension security, education, and respect and
    rewards for the work we do,&quot; he said. </p>
    <p>The workers' message also was carried to the convention
    floor by AFSCME President Gerald W. McEntee, who lambasted
    GOP leaders in Congress for trying to block the Family and
    Medical Leave Act and to drastically cut the Occupational
    Safety and Health Administration. </p>
    <p>&quot;At a time when nearly half a million Americans die
    on the job each year, Republicans are working overtime, if
    you will, to exempt workplaces from just routine safety
    inspections,&quot; said McEntee, who heads the federation's
    Political Committee. </p>
    <p>Machinists President George J. Kourpias, addressing a
    progressive policy forum sponsored by the Campaign for
    America's Future, praised Clinton for standing up to the GOP
    onslaught. &quot;The labor movement could not have withstood
    the assault by GOP leaders if the president had not
    intervened to defend working families.&quot; </p>
    <p>He urged activists to &quot;dress up Bill Clinton with
    coattails,&quot; to help elect a Congress that he can work
    with in a second term. </p>
    <p>The focus of the AFL-CIO's activities as Election Day
    neared is to educate union members and mobilize them to vote.
    Candidate comparisons highlighting stands on labor issues,
    will be distributed in late September. </p>

    <p align="center"><font size="4"><strong>IAM Mac pact secures
    jobs,raises wages `Global competition' doesn't stand scrutiny</strong><br>
    </font>by <br>
    James B. Parks </p>
    <p>The Machinists won a major victory at McDonnell Douglas on
    issues that affect many U.S. workers -- pension, job security
    and wages -- with the help of a united labor front and a
    strategy that exposed the fallacious corporate &quot;global
    economy&quot; excuse. </p>
    <p>&quot;The McDonnell Douglas workers proved that working
    people can build a better future, if they have the
    organization and courage to make a stand,&quot; IAM President
    George J. Kourpias said. &quot;People don't have to be
    victims of job exports or low wages. This is an important
    lesson and a major victory for workers everywhere.&quot; </p>
    <p>Some 6,700 members of IAM District 837 began returning to
    work at the aerospace manufacturer Sept. 16, five days after
    ratifying a new five-year contract that makes what the union
    called &quot;sweeping improvements in job security, retiree
    benefits and wages.&quot; </p>
    <p>&quot;Standing up together, we won the same basic job
    security protections the Boeing machinists won in their
    strike last fall,&quot; said Jerry Oulson, president of IAM
    District 837 in St. Louis. &quot;We won the best pension
    benefits in U.S. aerospace, a `30-and-out' retirement plan
    and improved wages and insurance. Our members can be very
    proud of what they've accomplished and return to their jobs
    stronger, more united and with their heads held high.&quot; </p>
    <p>The agreement &quot;shows that even in an era of economic
    transition, labor and management can resolve tough issues
    like job security if they are willing to work together,&quot;
    Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich said. </p>
    <p>Some 2,000 temporary replacement workers hired by the
    defense contractor were terminated Sept. 11, the day the pact
    was ratified, the company said. Strikers will be credited
    with time on strike for seniority purposes. The employees
    walked out June 5 at McDonnell Douglas's St. Louis plant
    after rejecting the company's contract offer. The key issue
    in the talks was McDonnell's increasing use of outside
    contractors and the transfer of some work to nonunion plants
    in Mesa, Ariz., and Macon, Ga. </p>
    <p>The new contract, ratified by a 2-1 margin, came after
    nearly 30 hours of continuous negotiations in the Capitol
    Hill offices of House Minority Leader Richard A. Gephardt
    (D-Mo.), who represents many of the McDonnell Douglas
    workers. </p>
    <p>During the strike, the IAM used a broad range of
    strategies to present its case. In this strike, as in the
    Boeing strike earlier this year, a key was the union's
    ability to link the plight of the St. Louis workers to
    international issues, said Barbara Shailor, who helped
    develop that strategy before being named AFL-CIO
    international affairs director in August. </p>
    <p>Two years before bargaining began at Boeing and McDonnell
    Douglas, the union researched how much production was being
    shipped out to nonunion U.S. plants and to low-wage Asian
    countries, particularly China. When talks began, the workers
    had a clear sense of what work was in China, Shailor said. </p>
    <p>&quot;We got under the argument of many American companies
    that you have to move work outside the country to access the
    market to sell your products,&quot; Shailor said. &quot;It's
    called the half-loaf theory -- half a loaf is better than no
    loaf. We came back with, `It's a loaf being baked outside the
    U.S. for the upper crust at home.' &quot; </p>
    <p>It wasn't hard to educate the members about the
    outsourcing, she said. The worker on the shop floor knows
    work is being sent out when he sees a crate marked &quot;Made
    in China.&quot; But the union had to show that the trend
    would likely continue unless there were skids in the contract
    to prevent it, she added. </p>
    <p>The union's research also was used to generate press
    stories that alerted the public to the results of the
    outsourcing. Prior to the opening of talks The Wall Street
    Journal exposed that the aerospace company's strategy of
    exporting technology to China had backfired. After one deal,
    the company received no new business and had given away a
    generation of technology to China needlessly. </p>
    <p>The union also received significant help from the AFL-CIO
    and other unions. AFL-CIO Secretary-Treasurer Richard L.
    Trumka led a mass &quot;March for American Jobs&quot; by
    10,000 people on McDonnell Douglas headquarters in St. Louis
    Aug. 11, along with Kourpias, Steelworkers President George
    Becker and UAW Secretary-Treasurer Roy Wyse. </p>
    <p>&quot;America is sick of corporate greed,&quot; Trumka
    told the crowd. &quot;America is sick of rich corporations
    sending our best jobs and technologies overseas, and taking
    huge executive bonuses while laying off loyal American
    workers.&quot; </p>
    <p>Wyse told the strikers, &quot;Labor is not going to fail
    here. This will send a message to other companies all across
    the nation and teach them something about corporate
    responsibility. Mac won't win.&quot; </p>
    <p>On the political front, the IAM asked President Clinton to
    withhold any federal payments to McDonnell Douglas related to
    the strike. </p>
    <p>In an Aug. 14 letter, Kourpias also asked Clinton to
    request an audit of the quality, cost and safety of all work
    performed for the government by the temporary replacement
    workers from across the country. </p>
    <p>But the biggest political push came from Gephardt and the
    Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service, said union
    spokesman Bob Kalaski. </p>
    <p>When bargaining stalled, Gephardt summoned the two sides
    to Washington and stressed the importance of a settlement. He
    then offered his office for the talks, and it was there that
    the final bargain was struck. In appreciation, the union and
    the company jointly bought an ad in the Sunday edition of the
    St. Louis Post Dispatch Sept. 15 thanking Gephardt and FMCS
    for their help in the strike. </p>
    <p>The new contract parallels the Boeing contract on job
    security. It requires the company to give 60 days' notice of
    subcontracting plans that would affect 50 or more union jobs,
    and to consult with the union on ways to retain jobs and
    skills. </p>
    <p>Displaced workers will be retrained and re-employed at
    available work in the company and will receive continued
    benefits. </p>
    <p>Workers will receive two wage increases totaling 4.5
    percent, plus three bonuses totaling 9 percent. Under the new
    &quot;30-and-out&quot; retirement program, workers will be
    eligible to retire as early as age 50. Defined retiree
    benefits will be set at $41 per month per year of service. </p>

    <p align="center"><font size="4"><strong>Local union leaders
    make tough choices, learn to grow<br>
    </strong></font>by<br>
    Muriel H. Cooper </p>
    <p>Union representation among grocery store workers in
    Dayton, Ohio, more than doubled over the past five years,
    from 33 percent to 74 percent, from 3,500 members to 7,500. </p>
    <p>It took a lot of effort and a lot of money, recalls Lenny
    Wyatt, president of Food and Commercial Workers Local 1099.
    &quot;We had to restore viability to the local. We had a lot
    of card checks. We spent in excess of $1 million
    organizing,&quot; he said. </p>
    <p>The union's presence is clearly visible in Dayton today,
    and it has paid off. </p>
    <p>When the Meijer grocery chain expanded into Dayton,
    executives cautiously eyed the pickets in front of their
    competitor, Cubs stores. Rather than fight determined workers
    like those who had maintained a three-year picket line at
    Cubs, Meijer took a neutral position and let their employees
    decide for themselves if they wanted to join the union. </p>
    <p>&quot;When Meijer saw we were aggressive, well-established
    and had community credibility, they backed down,&quot; Wyatt
    said. </p>
    <p>There are lessons in the Dayton experience that the
    AFL-CIO Organizing Department is hoping to spread around the
    labor movement. A key vehicle for that exchange is the
    AFL-CIO Elected Leaders Task Force, which met in Chicago
    recently to share ideas. </p>
    <p>Wyatt was one of the participants, as was Michael Pieti,
    who hopes to use some of Wyatt's tips to rebuild union
    membership in the faltering mill industry. Membership in
    Carpenters Local 2737, which Pieti heads, has dropped from
    28,000 members in 1985 to 15,000 today. &quot;We have a hell
    of a problem,&quot; he said. </p>
    <p>&quot;We've had a lot of loss because of the constraints
    on raw material and technology. But that's not to say there
    aren't many workers out there who should be organized, and
    that's who we have to go after.&quot; </p>
    <p>Pieti realizes that the message is &quot;money, membership
    and motivation. &quot;We have people who are just glad to be
    working for $9 an hour, because that beats working at the
    Mini-Mart,&quot; he said. </p>
    <p>The 53 elected union leaders at the Chicago retreat talked
    candidly about the obstacles and solutions for organizing
    workers. &quot;It was a fascinating discussion,&quot; said
    AFL-CIO Organizing Director Richard Bensinger. &quot;The
    leaders challenged each other and themselves to do more. It
    gave them the courage to go back to lead their locals in
    making plans and making tough decisions about
    organizing.&quot; </p>
    <p>One continuous topic was money -- where do you get it and
    how do you best use it for organizing. AFL-CIO President John
    J. Sweeney has urged affiliated unions to devote 30 percent
    of their budgets toward organizing by the year 2000. But that
    will require a major change in union culture at the local
    level. </p>
    <p>Flora Walker, president of AFSCME Council 25 in Michigan,
    made it happen when she left the retreat, convincing the
    executive board to put $1 million a year into organizing over
    the next four years. &quot;You have to understand that
    organizing is the savior for labor,&quot; she said. </p>
    <p>&quot;Even though we have made the commitment to allocate
    15 percent of our budget to organizing and 20 percent the
    next year, it's scary,&quot; said Kristy Semersheim,
    executive secretary for Service Employees Local 715 in San
    Jose, Calif. &quot;But we know we have to do this, because if
    we don't, we won't have a labor movement.&quot; </p>
    <p>Next year, Local 715 plans to transfer two servicing staff
    members to organizing and is allocating another $50,000 to
    pay for release time for member organizers. </p>
    <p>Member education plays an important role in the organizing
    process, said David Didier, secretary-treasurer for UFCW
    Local 135 in San Diego. </p>
    <p>The UFCW local produced an educational campaign on
    protecting the union's share of the market and the effect on
    bargaining when the share erodes. &quot;We used a short video
    and mailed it to our members. The message hit home,&quot;
    Didier said. </p>
    <p>&quot;We were also able to bargain that when our pension
    fund is fully funded, 15 cents will go back to members, who
    have agreed to give half of that to the superfund. We're
    talking $3.5 million for organizing in Southern California,
    over a four-year contract,&quot; he said. </p>
    <p>&quot;The AFL-CIO must drive home the importance of
    organizing, but a lot of things must happen at the local
    level,&quot; he said. &quot;If I didn't get anything else out
    of the retreat, I got that message. There must be a
    rededication of allocated resources at the local level.&quot; </p>
    <p>To help locals restructure to foster organizing, the
    AFL-CIO Elected Leadership Task Force on Organizing published
    Organizing for Change -- Changing to Organize! The manual is
    a springboard for self-examination, discussion and action. It
    is available from the AFL-CIO Organizing Department at
    202/639-6203. </p>

<blockquote>
    <p align="center"><font size="4"><strong>Strawberry campaign
    goes retail<br>
    </strong></font>by<br>
    Sharolyn A. Rosier </p>
    <p>AFL-CIO central labor councils from across the country
    took up the cause of struggling strawberry pickers from the
    fields of California, joining community and religious allies
    in a blitz of grocery stores to seek pledges of support for
    the workers. </p>
    <p>The Sept. 16 events came on the second &quot;national
    action day&quot; on behalf of the workers, and they yielded a
    bumper crop of good will in many of the 53 cities where the
    activities were scheduled. </p>
    <p>The day before, Farm Workers President Arturo Rodriguez
    and Secretary-Treasurer Dolores Huerta led 7,000 people in a
    rally and march in the Watsonville-Salinas area, where
    two-thirds of the state's strawberries are harvested by
    12,000 workers toiling 12 hours a day for $8,000 a season. </p>
    <p>The cry of &quot;Independencia Campesinas&quot; --
    &quot;Farmworker Independence&quot; -- rang out as workers
    detailed their backbreaking daily labors in fields, often
    without fresh water and bathroom facilities. </p>
    <p>&quot;We're not asking for anything the growers can't give
    us,&quot; strawberry worker David Rocha told the crowd.
    &quot;We only want what we and our families deserve and what
    is right and just. We are human beings.&quot; </p>
    <p>Even if strawberry workers' pay was increased by 50
    percent, the union estimates it would cost the industry only
    about five cents more per pound in the price of strawberries. </p>
    <p>The nationwide events the following day included news
    conferences held by the AFL-CIO central labor councils, as
    well as visits to grocery stores to ask store managers and
    consumers to sign a pledge of support for the workers, and to
    urge the state's $650 million strawberry industry to improve
    working conditions. </p>
    <p>Nine CLCs in Florida and Georgia sponsored store visits at
    96 locations and gained pledges from 17 grocery stores,
    including Winn Dixie, one of the largest supermarket chains
    in the South. In fact, the president of Winn Dixie called the
    campaign's coordinator, Paul Vasquez, and requested a
    meeting. </p>
    <p>Meanwhile, the San Francisco CLC kicked off the campaign
    with a news conference featuring Mayor Willie Brown, who
    signed the pledge card while also urging the community to
    support the workers. The CLC announced plans to target 100
    Lucky stores in the area by the end of the month. </p>
    <p>The press conference also included four members of the
    City Board of Supervisors, and officials of the A. Philip
    Randolph Institute, the Labor Council for Latin American
    Advancement and religious groups. </p>
    <p>In Los Angeles, the newly elected executive secretary-
    treasurer of the Los Angeles CLC, Miguel Contreras, held a
    news conference in front of City Hall with the support of
    four City Council members, the city controller and the city
    attorney. Contreras told reporters the CLC is planning 150
    visits to Vonn supermarket stores by the end of the month. </p>
    <p>In New York City, John Catsimataidis, chief executive
    officer of the city's largest chain of supermarkets, signed
    the pledge after meeting with Manhatten AFL-CIO Secretary Ted
    Jacobsen, UFW 1st Vice President Irv Hershenbaum and UFW
    Regional Director Sarah Johnson. </p>
    <p>&quot;I am proud to sign this pledge for the strawberry
    workers, just as I was proud to join Cesar Chavez 20 years
    ago in his effort to bring dignity to America's grape
    workers,&quot; Catsimataidis said. &quot;Men and women need
    to be treated as human beings and paid a livable wage. I
    applaud the work of the UFW and support this effort.&quot; </p>
    <p>The Denver CLC, along with Jobs with Justice and LCLAA,
    participated in a Mexican Independence Day Festival, where
    trade unionists distributed campaign leaflets and stickers. </p>
    <p>In Seattle, after visits to seven Puget Consumer Coop
    stores, management agreed to contact the CEO of the company.
    Eight CLCs in Illinois, Indiana, Michigan and Ohio also
    visited stores. </p>

    <p align="center"><font size="4"><strong>UAW members vote on
    Ford pact </strong></font><br>
    by<br>
    James B. Parks </p>
    <p>UAW members will vote Sept. 29 on a tentative three-year
    contract with Ford Motor Co. that, for the first time,
    includes a guaranteed employment floor. </p>
    <p>&quot;This agreement is a tribute to the hard work and
    discipline of the UAW-Ford membership, the negotiators on
    both sides and to the constructive relationship we have built
    with Ford in recent years,&quot; UAW President Stephen P.
    Yokich and Vice President Ernest Lofton said in a joint
    statement. Lofton heads the union's Ford Department. </p>
    <p>A contract summary distributed to the Ford workers Sept.
    18 said the new contract would &quot;overlay the existing job
    protections with a combination of innovative new incentives
    for the company to grow its business and a guaranteed minimum
    employment floor of 95 percent of the current number of&quot;
    UAW-represented jobs. The UAW represents 105,000 Ford
    employees. </p>
    <p>Following a first-year up-front lump-sum payment of
    $2,000, Ford employees would receive a 3 percent general wage
    increase in the second and third years. Along with Christmas
    bonuses and cost- of-living adjustments, the average Ford
    worker would gain $13,900 over the term of the contract, the
    union said. </p>
    <p>Retirees would gain enhanced inflation protection, and
    health care benefits would be improved. The contract also
    would provide the first-ever tuition assistance plan for
    children of Ford workers and retirees. </p>
    <p>The new agreement reflects the priorities set by UAW
    earlier this year. Rejecting the notion that better wages and
    job security are unattainable in a global economy, the union
    set those two issues as the top bargaining priorities. </p>
    <p>&quot;The UAW's commitment to the twin goals of job and
    income security is more important than ever,&quot; the union
    said in a 200-page 1996 collective bargaining program adopted
    by the union's special bargaining convention. </p>
    <p>The UAW still has negotiations with the other two Big
    Three automakers -- General Motors, where it represents
    216,000 workers, and Chrysler, where it represents about
    80,000. </p>

    <p>Workers at the Overnite Transportation Co. terminal in
    Memphis, Tenn., voted 219-201 for Teamsters representation
    Sept. 16, although 23 ballots were challenged by the company. </p>
    <p>The Memphis terminal is the second-largest facility at
    Overnite, which has been the subject of a nationwide
    organizing drive by the IBT since 1994. </p>
    <p>So far, IBT has won 18 Overnite elections to represent
    2,000 workers, with 15 other elections in dispute. The
    company employs about 14,000 workers, of whom about 10,000
    are eligible for IBT representation. </p>
    <p>Meanwhile, in Los Angeles, IBT Local 572 won an election
    to represent the 467 maintenance workers employed by
    Whitewood Oriental Maintenance Co. at the L.A. Airport. The
    vote was 289-62. Most of the workers earned only $4.25 and
    received no medical insurance or pension. </p>
    <p><a name="trytry">Try, try again </a></p>
    <p>The Teamsters plucked victory from the jaws of defeat in
    two recent organizing campaigns. </p>
    <p>Flight attendants at ComAir, who in June appeared to be 11
    votes short of the majority they needed to gain IBT
    representation, celebrated a win after 15 ballots postmarked
    before the deadline, but not delivered by the U.S. Postal
    Service, finally were received, giving the union the majority
    of votes needed to declare victory. </p>
    <p>The flight attendants, based in Cincinnati and Orlando,
    Fla., cited dissatisfaction with wages and working conditions
    as their reason for seeking IBT representation. </p>
    <p>Meanwhile, in Modesto, Calif., workers at the Atwater
    Canning Co. voted 349-273 for representation by the IBT after
    falling 32 votes short of winning their union in a 1990 vote. </p>
    <p>The victory was part of a renewed drive by the workers and
    the union to improve benefits, working conditions and wages. </p>
    <p><a name="ALPA gets Spirit ">ALPA gets Spirit </a></p>
    <p>Spirit Airlines pilots have voted for representation by
    the Air Line Pilots. Of the 86 eligible pilots, 60 percent
    voted for ALPA. </p>

    service as well as scheduled service to markets in Michigan,
    New Jersey, Florida and Massachusetts. </p>
    <p><a name="Musicians in groove ">Musicians in groove </a></p>
    <p>After a seven-month organizing drive, musicians at the
    Green Bay Symphony Orchestra voted by mail ballot 63-18 to be
    represented by Musicians Local 205. The votes were counted at
    the end of July. </p>
    <p>The campaign was coordinated by the union's newly
    established Organizing and Education Department. </p>
    <p><a name="USWA's precious cargo ">USWA's precious cargo </a></p>
    <p>Some 450 school bus drivers in Nashville, Tenn. voted
    Sept. 3 for representation by the Steelworkers. </p>
    <p>The mostly female drivers organized around stronger safety
    measures, an end to overcrowding and unfair distribution of
    routes and fairer treatment for workers by the school
    district. </p>
    <p>The victory culminates a campaign that lasted more than a
    year, as Nashville officials repeatedly tried to stop the
    organizing effort and bus drivers refused to give up. They
    waged a legal battle for their right to organize and used
    school board meetings to rally hundreds of union supporters
    to their cause. </p>
    <p><a name="Organizing the privatized ">Organizing the

    <p>Service Employees Local 503 in Oregon won two organizing

    <p>Some 120 direct-care workers at the Oregon Supported
    Living Program in Eugene and 45 direct-care workers at a
    group home in Corvallis have joined the local. </p>

    <p>Two SEIU units have found out that all good things do come

    <p>After an organizing campaign of several months, SEIU Local

    Good Samaritan Hospital in Brockton, Mass. The unit also has
    filed for election to represent the hospital's service and
    maintenance unit of more than 500 workers. </p>
    <p>In took two years in Niagara County, N.Y., but 130
    technicians at the Cerebral Palsy Association finally voted
    to join Local 652. The local now is working to represent
    almost 1,000 technical employees at Children's Hospital in
    Buffalo. </p>
    <p><a name="Go-go SEIU ">Go-go SEIU </a></p>
    <p>Exotic dancers at San Francisco's Lusty Lady Theater voted
    57- 15 in early September to be represented by SEIU. The
    workers were concerned with job seniority, shift scheduling,
    working conditions, wages and health insurance. </p>
    <p>Sporting &quot;Union Yes&quot; garter belts, the dancers
    began organizing after they realized that customers were
    videotaping them from behind the one-way mirrors through

    <p>UMWA President Cecil Roberts praised the solidarity of the
    Carborundum workers, and also pointed to the effectiveness of
    the union's new organizing approach. &quot;We're taking
    advantage of our rank-and-file members who are the best
    possible people to explain to unorganized workers the
    benefits of belonging to a union.&quot; </p>

    <p align="center"><font size="4"><strong>Union's Southern
    strategy pays off <br>
    </strong></font>by<br>
    Muriel H. Cooper </p>
    <p>Workers at Kitchen of the Ocean shrimp processing plant in
    Deerfield, Fla., voted overwhelmingly for UNITE
    representation, as the union continued marching through the
    South, racking up victory after impressive victory. </p>
    <p>The 173-18 vote for UNITE representation is the 15th win
    in 17 organizing drives in the southeastern states of
    Florida, Georgia, Alabama, North Carolina and South Carolina
    since mid-March, adding 2,500 new members to UNITE's rolls. </p>
    <p>&quot;Workers across the South are organizing for more
    empowerment in the workplace,&quot; said UNITE President Jay
    Mazur. </p>
    <p>Southern workers see themselves in the midst of a growing
    crisis as they work harder each day for less and less, said
    Bruce Raynor, executive vice president and Southern regional
    director of UNITE. They want a better future for themselves
    and their families, he said. </p>
    <p>Workers at the shrimp plant, mostly Haitian women, had to
    deal with a particularly aggressive anti-union campaign that
    included hired union busters and the firing of three
    supporters the day of the election. </p>
    <p>&quot;We were tired of being treated worse and paid less
    than non- Haitian workers,&quot; said Virginia Pierre, a
    peeler at the plant. &quot;I've been here nine years, and
    today I feel like we've finally won the respect we've
    deserved for so long.&quot; </p>
    <p>AFL-CIO Organizing Director Richard Bensinger credits
    UNITE's &quot;great strategy and dedication&quot; for the
    string of Southern victories. &quot;But they couldn't get
    there without the commitment of resources and their members.
    Their victories are directly tied in with their
    structure.&quot; </p>
    <p>&quot;Workers are looking for an alternative, and they see
    that our union is ready to roll up our sleeves and get in the
    trenches for the fight,&quot; said Monica Russo, UNITE's
    Southern region organization director. &quot;People are ready
    to take on their employers and win.&quot; </p>
    <p>Such was the case at the Roadmaster Corp. in Opelika,
    Ala., where workers cast a 343-150 vote for UNITE. </p>
    <p>The workers began organizing in June, citing a need for
    affordable health insurance, livable wages and respect on the
    shop floor. Workers at the plant were dismissed when
    Roadmaster bought Diversified Products in 1994 and then
    rehired for as much as $2 an hour less and with fewer
    benefits. </p>
    <p>&quot;The workers at Roadmaster have let it be known loud
    and clear that they're ready for a change,&quot; said Joe
    Gaines, a UNITE organizer. &quot;The company tried every
    trick in the book to keep the workers from forming their
    union, but this crowd stood tough and stayed focused on
    justice,&quot; he said. </p>
    <p>Roadmaster workers make Thighmaster and other exercise
    equipment. </p>
    <p>Perhaps the biggest gain for UNITE has been in the nursing
    home industry in Florida, where the mostly female and
    immigrant work force is faced with low wages, lack of
    benefits and lack of respect. </p>
    <p>The union has won four out of six of those organizing
    drives, including its most recent at Miami's Dania Nursing
    Home, where workers voted by a 3-1 margin for the union. The
    unit will include certified nursing assistants and
    housekeeping, laundry and dietary workers. </p>

September 20, 1996</strong></p>
<p align="center"><font size="4"><strong>Labor '96 is pinching
foes at grass roots</strong></font><br>
by<br>
Mike Hall </p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Labor '96 is in full swing, keeping the heat on wayward
    members of Congress to change their positions on issues of
    importance to working families. </p>
    <p>The latest AFL-CIO grass-roots lobbying advertisements
    focus on the votes by House members to cut education and
    college loans as part of the Republican 1996 budget plan. A
    presidential veto killed the budget, which would have cut
    college student loans by $10 billion and exacted huge cuts
    from Head Start and the Safe and Drug Free schools program. </p>
    <p>In Connecticut, Rep. Gary Franks (R) ducked 100 students
    at Western Connecticut State University in Danbury, who
    sought to confront him at a Sept. 19 forum over his votes to
    cut student loans. </p>
    <p>Justin Molito, a senior at Western Connecticut and one of
    the forum moderators, is fresh off the Union Summer Southern
    Bus Tour to help organize nursing homes in the South. After
    returning home, the 23-year-old joined Labor '96 and helped
    establish Youth for Justice on Western's campus. </p>
    <p>&quot;The response has been great, especially because of
    the student loans. It hits students right in the
    pocketbook,&quot; Molito said. &quot;They have a hard time
    believing someone would vote against education, but you show
    them the record.&quot; </p>
    <p>College tuition has jumped three times as fast as
    household income in the past 14 years, and the growing income
    gap between the rich and working families has made it a
    struggle for working families to send their kids to school. </p>
    <p>The student loan ads, which are airing on television and
    radio in 32 districts, feature Carolyn and John Friedman of
    Philadelphia. They tell viewers, &quot;Next year we will have
    two children in college and it will be very hard to put them
    through -- even with two incomes.&quot; </p>
    <p>Yet as the ad points out, &quot;Congressman _______ voted
    with Newt Gingrich to cut college loans while giving tax
    breaks to the wealthy. To take away opportunities for
    children to go to college is a crime . . . Tell him his
    priorities are all wrong.&quot; </p>
    <p>The Speaker of the House, author of the GOP &quot;Contract
    With America,&quot; continues to anger trade unionists. A
    Sept. 9 fundraiser with Gingrich and Franks drew some 500
    protesters, said Warren Gould, Labor '96 coordinator in
    Connecticut's 5th District. &quot;We were able to sign up
    nearly 200 new volunteers. It totally energized us,&quot;
    Gould said. </p>
    <p>In Western Kentucky, the Gingrich name also was a magnet.
    Trade union members have followed Rep. Ed Whitfield (R) to
    four county courthouse meetings to expose his record,
    carrying signs that claim he should earn the &quot;Best
    Supporting Oscar for Supporting Newt 91 Percent of the
    Time.&quot; </p>
    <p>In Chattanooga, Tenn., labor, community and religious
    activists made Friday, Sept. 13, an unlucky day for Rep. Zach
    Wamp (R). Some 50 people rallied in front of his office to
    criticize his votes to cut education and Medicare and allow
    raids on their pension funds. </p>
    <p>That followed a late August demonstration in which several
    dozen protestors marched in front of Wamp's downtown office
    and distributed fliers charging Wamp &quot;dropped the ball
    on education&quot; when he backed the 1996 GOP House budget. </p>
    <p>The emphasis on education follows a second round of
    television and radio ads reiterating the GOP's attempt to
    slash $270 billion from Medicare last year. The ads responded
    to what AFL-CIO President John J. Sweeney called
    &quot;shamefully dishonest television commercials&quot; paid
    for by the Republicans that falsely claimed Medicare benefits
    would increase under the GOP proposals, and urged those
    members to change their positions. </p>
    <p>Activists throughout the country also are going
    door-to-door to meet with union members and their families.
    The &quot;Labor Neighbor&quot; program kicked off Sept. 14 in
    California's sprawling 1st District, which stretches north of
    San Francisco to the Oregon border and inland to the wine
    country. </p>
    <p>About 20 union members went door-to-door and were able to
    talk to about 200 union families, said Gary Greer, the
    district campaign coordinator. After telling workers about
    Republican efforts to take away hard-won gains through
    Davis-Bacon repeal, job safety cutbacks and the TEAM Act, the
    activists left with the admonition that &quot;you could sit
    out this election, but it could cost you,&quot; he said. </p>

    <p>Spending bills are the last items on the agenda for the
    104th Congress as it speeds toward a late September
    adjournment target. Several key labor issues remain in play. </p>
    <p>The Labor/Health and Human Services fiscal 1997
    appropriations bill (H.R. 3755) will be the main battleground
    for such worker issues as workplace safety, training and
    education. The Treasury/Postal spending bill (H.R. 3756)
    could threaten the rights of union representatives in two
    government agencies, and an immigration bill has an
    objectionable provision that denies education to children of
    illegal immigrants. </p>
    <p>Any unfinished appropriations measures are expected to be
    folded into one omnibus spending bill or continuing
    resolution so that lawmakers and President Clinton can avoid
    the kind of stalemate that last year caused two shutdowns of
    the federal government. It appears the Labor/HHS bill will be
    part of a continuing resolution. </p>
    <p>The Senate Appropriations Committee reported a Labor/HHS
    bill Sept. 12 that included smaller cuts and fewer
    objectionable riders than the House version approved in July.
    But it still drew criticism and a White House veto threat. </p>
    <p>The House bill eliminated funding for Goals 2000, a
    program to improve the performance of public schools, and the
    Healthy Start program that seeks to reduce infant mortality.
    It also included cuts in funding for the National Labor
    Relations Board and the Occupational Safety and Health
    Administration. A provision to ban OSHA from researching and
    issuing new ergonomic rules was stripped from the bill. </p>
    <p>The Senate version allocated money for Goals 2000 and
    Healthy Start, eliminated the 15 percent House cut for the
    NLRB and increased OSHA's funding over the House bill.
    However, funds for OSHA and the Mine Safety and Health
    Administration fall below the Clinton administration's
    requests, and the OSHA budget in fact is lower than 1996
    levels. </p>
    <p>The White House protested OSHA funding levels and the cuts
    in a Department of Labor program aimed at eliminating
    sweatshops. </p>
    <p>The funding levels for education and employment and
    training don't meet the administration's request, meaning
    some 250,000 individuals -- including 134,000 disadvantaged
    youths in the summer jobs program, 81,000 dislocated workers
    and 35,000 disadvantaged adults -- would be denied training
    and employment services. </p>
    <p>&quot;These cuts are especially shortsighted considering
    the strict new requirements in the welfare reform legislation
    to prepare welfare recipients to move into work,&quot; an
    Office of Management and Budget letter said. The OMB will
    recommend a veto if the bill remains in its current form. </p>
    <p>Senate leaders plan to seek an amendment to the bill to
    add $3.1 billion for education and training. </p>
    <p>&quot;Republicans are in a hurry to leave town, but
    school's not out until we meet the educational needs of our
    children,&quot; said Senate Minority Leader Thomas A. Daschle
    (D-S.D.). </p>
    <p>While the Labor/HHS bill was reported without any
    amendments handcuffing OSHA's efforts to address new
    workplace ergonomic rules, such an amendment might well be
    offered when the measure comes up for floor action. The House
    bill attacks workers with an amendment to ban the use of
    &quot;official time&quot; -- the time union reps spend on
    labor-management programs and other representational
    activities -- at the Social Security Administration and the
    Health Care Financing Administration. </p>
    <p>&quot;This blatant anti-worker effort is another attack in
    the recent assault on unions and is in obvious retaliation
    for labor's efforts to educate both its membership and all
    working Americans on the issues most affecting their standard
    of living,&quot; Legislative Director Peggy Taylor said. </p>
    <p>Official time is used when a federal employee is acting as
    a union representative and may be used only on such things as
    contract negotiations, grievance handling and
    labor-management cooperative efforts to improve service
    quality, efficiency and delivery. It cannot be used for such
    internal union business as organizing, union elections or
    partisan politics. </p>
    <p>In the federal government, official time came about when a
    1978 law required federal unions to represent all employees
    in the bargaining unit regardless of whether they joined the
    union. At the same time, it banned the unions from collecting
    fees for the representational activities they provide to
    nonmembers. But Congress did allow unions to negotiate for
    the use of official time with federal agencies. </p>
    <p>Official and or &quot;company&quot; time is commonly
    negotiated in the private sector as well as at state and
    local government levels. </p>
    <p>House and Senate negotiators will determine what funding
    levels and other provisions will be included in the Labor/HHS
    portion of the continuing resolution, and if amendments will
    be allowed. </p>
    <p>On the immigration front, UNITE, the Service Employees and
    other unions have objected to provisions in an illegal
    immigration bill (H.R. 2202) that would deny public education
    to the children of illegal immigrants and could deny certain
    benefits to legal immigrants and their relatives. </p>
    <p>The bill also requires legal immigrants to meet certain
    income levels before they would be allowed to sponsor a
    relative, including a spouse or child, for entry into the
    United States. If that income level fell, neither they nor
    their relatives would be allowed welfare benefits. </p>
    <p>That bill is in a House/Senate conference and it is
    unclear whether an agreement will be reached that would bring
    it to the floor. </p>

<p align="center"><font size="4"><strong>Workers renew drive for
rights in trade pact<br>
</strong></font>by<br>
David Kameras </p>
<blockquote>
    <p>The AFL-CIO has reiterated its demand that worker rights
    be an essential part of trade negotiations, and that the
    issue be pressed at the ministerial meeting of the new World
    Trade Organization in Singapore in early December. </p>
    <p>&quot;If we want the global economy to be a source of
    stability and growth, not chaos and division, we must address
    the pain, the anxiety and the basic needs of working
    people,&quot; AFL-CIO President John J. Sweeney told the
    Advisory Committee on Trade Policy and Negotiations, the most
    prominent private-sector trade advisory panel to President
    Clinton. </p>
    <p>&quot;Trade policy and trade negotiations aren't just
    about tariffs or quotas,&quot; Sweeney said Sept. 11.
    &quot;They are about people and jobs. And they are about the
    decisions government makes that help or hurt people who are
    trying to make their way in the fast-changing and unforgiving
    global economy.&quot; </p>
    <p>The committee, which is mostly made up of CEOs of major
    U.S. corporations, but also includes AFL-CIO Vice Presidents
    Jay Mazur and Lenore Miller, was told that existing
    agreements fall far short of providing fairness to American
    workers, businesses and consumers. </p>
    <p>&quot;There are huge differences in tariff levels, labor
    and environmental conditions and government practices,&quot;
    Sweeney said. &quot;America can't accept this anymore. If we
    are going to have free trade, we must have fair trade.&quot; </p>
    <p>&quot;We want people to show the same concern for people
    as for property,&quot; he said. &quot;We want to empower
    workers, not just corporations. And we recognize that
    government still must help to make sure that the benefits of
    trade are widely distributed.&quot; </p>
    <p>Sweeney and Mazur, who chairs the Executive Council's
    Trade Committee, also met separately with Acting U.S. Trade
    Representative Charlene Barshefsky and her senior staff to
    press for an all-out effort to advance worker rights and
    labor standards before the WTO, which grew out of the
    long-running General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. </p>
    <p>Barshefsky reiterated that these issues are of vital
    importance, and said the administration will do its utmost to
    secure approval of a working party under the WTO's auspices. </p>
    <p>The WTO initiative was the subject earlier this month of a
    trade mission to the Southern Cone led by Luis Anderson,
    general secretary of the International Confederation of Free
    Trade Union's Latin American sector, ORIT, and including
    Barbara Shailor, AFL-CIO International Affairs Director. </p>
    <p>Meeting with labor, economic and foreign ministers in
    Argentina, Brazil and Chile, as well as with Brazilian
    President Fernando Enrique Cardozo, the group proposed that
    WTO member countries be subject to a regular review of their
    observance of international labor standards, while receiving
    assistance from a special international social fund to raise
    and implement those standards. </p>
    <p>The Latin American mission reflected &quot;the total
    consensus from workers in the hemisphere that they need to be
    represented in the talks,&quot; Shailor said, noting that the
    rights issue united workers from both industrial and
    developing nations, which have historically opposed linking
    worker rights with trade. &#160;</p>

<p align="center"><font size="4"><strong>Child labor foes making
inroads</strong></font><br>
by<br>
Muriel H. Cooper </p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Child labor continues to escalate, but the fight against
    the practice has energized a new generation of social
    activists and served to educate consumers. </p>
    <p>That was the mixed message coming out of the Child Labor
    Coalition's three-day conference in Washington. </p>
    <p>The International Labor Organization estimates that more
    than 73 million children ages 10-14 were &quot;economically
    active&quot; in 1995. </p>
    <p>&quot;The fact that so many organizations that fought for
    child labor law a century ago are now returning with renewed
    vigor to this same issue most certainly indicates that there
    is a problem,&quot; said Linda F. Golodner, co-chair of the
    coalition. </p>
    <p>The good news is that since its conference two years ago,
    the coalition of trade unionists, child and human rights
    advocates and community groups has made major inroads in
    educating consumers about the abusive nature of child labor. </p>
    <p>The organization pointed to two campaigns that are opening
    the eyes of consumers worldwide -- RUGMARK, which clearly
    identifies hand-knotted carpets made free of child labor, and
    Foul Ball, which is negotiating with the International
    Federation of Football Association to guarantee that children
    do not stitch together FIFA- approved soccer balls. </p>
    <p>&quot;You see, there's a `cause and effect' here,&quot;
    U.S. Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich told the conference.
    &quot;You turned up the heat and you got results.&quot; </p>
    <p>Conference attendees also discussed child labor in the
    agriculture industry, street trades such as domestic service
    and prostitution and how to safeguard children working
    door-to-door sales, lawn care and in the entertainment
    industry. </p>
    <p>What ties all of this together, said Neil Kearney, general
    secretary for the International Textile, Garment and Leather
    Workers' Federation, is the issue of worker rights, which is
    essential to understanding child labor. He called for a
    consistent approach in dealing with low wages, health and
    safety issues and hours of work. </p>
    <p>To effectively deal with the issue of worker rights around
    the globe, it must be a part of the discussion in
    international trade, said Greg Woodhead, an AFL-CIO
    economist. </p>

by<br>
Colleen M. O'Neill </p>
<blockquote>
    <p>The federal government spent nearly $40 billion in 1994 on
    contractors with dismal safety records. </p>
    <p>A recent General Accounting Office report documented the
    practice, noting that 261 federal contractors were issued
    significant penalties by the Occupational Safety and Health
    Administration for alleged safety and health violations in
    fiscal 1994. </p>
    <p>Those contractors received more than $1 of every $5 paid
    by the federal government in contract money that year. </p>
    <p>The GAO said it considered all proposed penalties of more
    than $15,000 to be &quot;significant;&quot; OSHA said only 3
    percent of the employers it cited in that time period faced
    proposed penalties of $15,000 or more. </p>
    <p>A total of 35 workers were killed and 85 injured at work
    sites operated by the contractors, according to the report,
    &quot;Occupational Safety and Health: Violations of Safety
    and Health Regulations by Federal Contractors.&quot; </p>
    <p>Sen. Paul Simon (D-Ill.), who requested the study along
    with Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.), has proposed debarring
    federal contractors for up to three years when they violate
    job safety and other labor-related regulations, but his
    attempt to attach the proposal to GOP-sponsored OSHA
    legislation in the spring failed. </p>
    <p>The report noted that most of the contractors with the
    egregious safety records were awarded contracts from the
    Department of Defense, the Department of Energy and NASA. </p>
    <p>The GAO urged OSHA to focus on federal contractors who
    might be operating dangerous work sites -- for example, the
    agency should consider whether the presence of federal
    contracts should place the employer on OSHA's priority
    inspection list. </p>
    <p>In a statement released with the report, Simon said
    &quot;it is not unreasonable&quot; for such contractors to be
    held to a higher standard because they already are required
    to meet affirmative action and other federal requirements
    beyond those applied to nonfederal contractors. </p>

<blockquote>
    <p align="center"><font size="4"><strong>Unions point to
    struggles on Labor Day </strong></font></p>
    <p>Hellraising figured into this Labor Day holiday, as
    AFL-CIO President John J. Sweeney and Secretary-Treasurer
    Richard L. Trumka kicked off the festivities by being
    arrested along with 19 others for blocking the entrance to
    The Detroit News. </p>
    <p>&quot;Believe me, you're going to win and you're going to
    get a good contract,&quot; he told striking Detroit News and
    Free Press employees at a rally. &quot;This strike is the
    most important strike and the most important struggle we have
    in our country today. In no way will the labor movement fail
    you.&quot; </p>
    <p>The arrests marked a shift in strategy by the strikers,
    who plan more acts of civil disobedience that will result in
    misdemeanor arrests, said Al Derey, president of the
    Metropolitan Council of Newspaper Unions. </p>
    <p>In appearances across the country, Sweeney, Trumka and
    Executive Vice President Linda Chavez-Thompson extolled
    labor's new activism and urged workers to use their power and
    vote their interests in November. </p>
    <p>Labor &quot;is building a dynamic new force for America's
    working families. We're energizing our movement, we're
    mobilizing on an unprecedented scale,&quot; Chavez-Thompson
    told a crowd at a Labor Day observance in New Jersey in honor
    of Peter J. McGuire, who helped to create the national
    holiday. </p>
    <p>Sweeney was back in Detroit two days after his arrest, on
    Labor Day, telling marchers that if they vote like workers,
    &quot;we will have a workers' victory this November. And then
    we'll keep on coming back again and again until this nation
    respects the work we do and rewards us for the contribution
    we make.&quot; </p>
    <p>Trumka delivered the same message in Chicago during the
    local AFL-CIO's 100th Labor Day celebration, urging the crowd
    to support candidates that &quot;champion the things you and
    your family need.&quot; </p>
    <p>Chavez-Thompson, in Los Angeles, told workers that the
    &quot;cruel paradox&quot; of the American economy -- high
    profits and low wages -- shows why we need unions. </p>
    <p>Sweeney also joined President Clinton for rallies in
    Milwaukee and Green Bay, Wis., two of the hundreds of
    gatherings by trade unionists across the country to mark the
    holiday. </p>
    <p>In New York City, more than 100,000 workers turned out on
    the Saturday after the holiday for the traditional Labor Day
    Parade, one of the largest in years. </p>

    <p align="center"><font size="4"><strong>Frontier strikers:
    Five years and holding fast</strong></font><br>
    by<br>
    Muriel H. Cooper </p>
    <p>Through five years of rain, sunshine, mortgage payments
    and nearby casino openings, one thing has remained constant
    for Frontier Hotel workers -- their picket line. </p>
    <p>The 550 members of Hotel Employees and Restaurant
    Employees Local 226 who were forced to strike the Las Vegas
    hotel on Sept. 21, 1991, have been buoyed by favorable court
    decisions and unshakable labor and community solidarity. But
    they remain on strike. </p>
    <p>&quot;Not one soul has gone back to the Frontier,&quot;
    said Jim Arnold, secretary-treasurer of the local. &quot;They
    took our pension away, cut wages and wanted to eliminate the
    grievance procedure,&quot; he said. </p>
    <p>AFL-CIO Secretary-Treasurer Richard L. Trumka carried a
    message of admiration and support for the strikers at a rally
    and banquet Sept. 21-22. </p>
    <p>&quot;A five-year strike in which not one person has
    crossed the picket line deserves accolades and support,&quot;
    Trumka told the summer meeting of the Executive Council. He
    noted that Joe Daugherty, a HERE organizer, has not taken a
    day off in five years because he has been helping the
    strikers. </p>
    <p>Frontier has faced sanctions from the National Labor
    Relations Board, which has declared the dispute an unfair
    labor practice strike, and a federal court, which has ordered
    the hotel to pay more than $1.5 million to the pension fund
    for the striking workers. </p>
    <p>The court also ordered the hotel to rescind disciplinary
    findings on any employee resulting from some 64 unilaterally
    imposed work rules and to reinstate with back pay anyone
    discharged or suspended because of the rules. </p>
    <p>&quot;We're in this for the long haul,&quot; said Arnold. </p>

    <p>A federal appeals court ruling affirms the right of city
    and state governments to support unions in private-sector
    labor disputes. </p>
    <p>The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit Sept. 13
    reversed a lower court ruling that the city of Oakland,
    Calif., could not endorse a boycott of Alameda Newspapers
    Inc., owner of the Oakland Tribune. </p>
    <p>The case, ANI vs. City of Oakland, began in 1993 when ANI
    bought the newspaper, cut 400 of 600 jobs and moved
    production out of the city. The Northern California Newspaper
    Guild and the seven unions in the Conference of Newspaper
    Unions launched a boycott of ANI, which the City Council
    endorsed, canceling all city subscriptions and official
    advertising. </p>
    <p>ANI sued the city for $5 million and sought an injunction
    against the cancellations. A federal judge ruled in favor of
    ANI, saying the city illegally had tried to regulate ANI and
    had attempted to interfere with the &quot;free play of
    economic forces.&quot; </p>
    <p>The appeals court disagreed, saying the city merely was
    expressing its opinion. Cities and states have the right to
    &quot;make pronouncements about labor disputes of concern to
    their communities,&quot; the court said. </p>
    <p><a name="Albertson's workers sue ">Albertson's workers sue </a></p>
    <p>Seven current and former employees of Albertson's grocery
    chain filed a class-action lawsuit seeking back pay for work
    they performed off the clock. </p>
    <p>The suit, filed with the help of the Food and Commercial
    Workers, claims Albertson's threatens to fire employees who
    complain about working off the clock and fails to permit rest
    breaks on company time. </p>
    <p>UFCW represents 31,000 of the chain's 85,000 employees. </p>
    <p>More than 1,500 workers have given declarations that they
    worked off the clock for Albertson's. The company claims it
    has a policy against off-the-clock work, but workers maintain
    they are penalized if they don't finish their assigned tasks
    within their scheduled hours of work, forcing them to work
    off the clock. </p>
    <p>Albertson's, in a preemptive strike, filed a federal
    lawsuit in Boise, Idaho, seeking to bar union-represented
    employees from initiating suits until they have exhausted the
    grievance arbitration procedure in their own union. The union
    responded with an unfair labor practice complaint, saying the
    lawsuit is an attempt to interfere with protected employee
    rights. </p>
    <p>Several years ago, a similar UFCW investigation of
    nonunion Food Lion, an Albertson's competitor, raised 300
    claims and led to a U.S. Labor Department suit that was
    settled for $16.2 million. </p>
    <p><a name="Airline ordered to bargain ">Airline ordered to

    <p>A federal district judge has ordered America West Airlines
    to immediately begin contract negotiations with its
    mechanics. </p>
    <p>In a companion decision, the judge dismissed claims by the
    Teamsters and four former workers who filed a class action
    suit seeking damages over America West's decision to fire
    several hundred workers. </p>
    <p>However, Judge Roger Strand of the U.S. District Court for
    Arizona has allowed the union to proceed with its claim,
    charging that the airline's decision to contract out work had
    a negative effect on the union's organizing drive. </p>
    <p>In April, the workers voted 587-135 for IBT
    representation. However, the company challenged the win,
    charging that the nearly 400 workers fired last December by
    the airline should not have been allowed to vote. The judge
    dismissed the challenge. </p>

    <p align="center"><font size="4"><strong>L.A. unions help
    tortilla drivers roll</strong></font><br>
    by<br>
    Sharolyn A. Rosier and James B. Parks </p>
    <p>After working 10 to 12 hours a day, six days a week with
    no overtime pay, more than 100 truck drivers in Los Angeles
    took on their employer, tortilla maker Mission Guerrero, and
    won. </p>
    <p>After seven weeks on strike, the truckers ratified a new
    five- year contract that gives them what they wanted: job
    security, better wages, cheaper health care and most of all,
    their dignity. </p>
    <p>The contract, ratified Sept. 18 by an 85-2 vote, provides
    for guaranteed job security, an increased base pay rate and a
    higher commission rate. At the same time, the company agreed
    to explore finding a new health care provider that would
    reduce workers' co- payments. </p>
    <p>The agreement will boost worker pay by $95 a week over the
    term of the contract. The commission rate will be raised 1
    percent, from 5 percent to 6 percent. The company also agreed
    to give up its right to unilaterally contract out the
    drivers' jobs to independent contractors. </p>
    <p>The key to the victory was community support, said Peter
    Olney, director of the Los Angeles Manufacturing Action
    Project (LAMAP), a multiunion industrial organizing program.
    &quot;We made it a communitywide issue. Mission Guerrero's
    tortillas became taboo tortillas, not to be touched until the
    strike was settled.&quot; </p>
    <p>After about five-and-a-half weeks, the company blinked at
    the boycott activity and negative publicity it was receiving,
    and started talking, Olney said. </p>
    <p>&quot;The company just wants the money to keep rolling in,
    but immigrant workers are very militant,&quot; Olney said.
    &quot;This is going to force unions to look again at the
    whole question of how to organize, at what having a union
    really means.&quot; </p>
    <p>With the help of local trade unionists, LAMAP and
    community activists, the strikers held demonstrations at El
    Pollo Loco, one of the company's major customers, and at the
    Mexican consulate. Several El Pollo Loco restaurants agreed
    to stop buying Mission Guerrero's products. </p>
    <p>On Labor Day, the workers received a big boost from the
    Los Angeles Central Labor Council. During the CLC's Labor Day
    event, Executive Secretary-Treasurer Miguel Contreras signed
    a pledge to boycott the company, along with U.S. Department
    of Housing and Urban Development Secretary Henry Cisneros,
    U.S. Reps. Esteban Torres and Maxine Waters, Lt. Gov. Gray
    Davis and several city council members. </p>
    <p>Three years ago, the workers, members of Teamsters Local
    63, organized and achieved their main goal -- health
    insurance for their families. During negotiations earlier
    this year, Mission Guerrero proposed changes that would have
    made their economic situation much worse. </p>
    <p>The company proposed a pay raise of $1.03 per day the
    first year, with smaller raises in the second and third
    years. At the same time it wanted workers to increase their
    co-payments for health care benefits, more than canceling the
    proposed wage increases, said Hector Fernandez, Local 63
    business agent. </p>
    <p>The workers also were angered by the long hours they
    worked and the system the company uses to avoid paying
    overtime. While paying its drivers only $250 a week, the
    company, in turn, sells them their trucks for $90 to $115 a
    week. To get them to hustle, the company paid a commission
    according to the value of the tortillas each customer buys,
    but only after the first $2,000 in weekly sales. </p>
    <p>For a fast driver, it usually took two to four days to
    reach the threshold, according to the union. The drivers
    routinely put in 10-to-12 hour days, six days a week, for a
    total of 60 to 80 hours. </p>
    <p>In addition, the company pays $190 a week for fuel and the
    use of the truck, but gas alone can cost $160 to $180. </p>
    <p>Mission Guerrero is the main tortilla supplier for the
    U.S. Army as well as for such fast food chains as El Pollo
    Loco, Taco Bell, Del Taco, Carls Jr. and Green Burrito. </p>

<blockquote>
    <p align="center"><font size="4"><strong>Communities back
    USWA tire campaign</strong></font><br>
    by<br>
    James B. Parks </p>
    <p>The growing roar of support for the Steelworkers' campaign
    against Bridgestone/Firestone added the voices of New
    Orleans' largest tire dealer, the Atlanta City Council and a
    delegation of Japanese trade unionists. </p>
    <p>A New Orleans-style funeral, complete with Dixieland band,
    escorted Bridgestone and Firestone signs from four New
    Orleans tire stores to their &quot;final resting place&quot;
    Sept. 12 as the stores' owner, Cal Lucas, ended his family's
    three-decade relationship with the company. Lucas is the
    largest independent tire dealer in New Orleans, doing about
    $1 million in business annually with Bridgestone/Firestone.
    Now he will sell Kelly Springfield tires, which are
    union-made. </p>
    <p>&quot;Here's an international company with worldwide
    facilities that wants the workers to come to its terms,&quot;
    Lucas said. &quot;They're shipping products from Third World
    countries while American workers are out of work.
    Bridgestone/Firestone has said it wants to lower wages and
    other costs to be competitive -- it wants its workers to work
    for Third World wages. I don't like it!&quot; </p>
    <p>A crew of striking USWA members from Bayou Steel took the
    flags down from Lucas's four stores and replaced them with
    Kelly Springfield signs. </p>
    <p>The USWA and Bridgestone/Firestone have been unable to
    reach agreement on a contract since July 1994, when 4,000
    workers walked off the job. The workers, formerly members of
    the Rubber Workers, suspended the strike after 10 months.
    During the strike, Bridgestone/Firestone hired 2,300
    replacement workers. At issue is the rehiring of 700
    strikers. </p>
    <p>The union is conducting an international &quot;black
    flag&quot; campaign against the Japanese-owned tire-maker.
    The black flag is the traditional racing symbol for
    disqualifying a car for outrageous rules violations. The
    USWA's &quot;black flag&quot; campaign is asking consumers
    not to buy Bridgestone/Firestone products or service, until
    all workers are returned to work with back wages and a fair
    contract is negotiated. </p>
    <p>In Atlanta, the city council joined nearly 50 other state
    and local governments and businesses supporting the USWA
    campaign. The council adopted a resolution stating the city's
    refusal to &quot;purchase Bridge-stone/Firestone products
    until all union members are returned to work under a contract
    that provides dignity, equity and security.&quot; </p>
    <p>The resolution notes that the National Labor Relations
    Board is seeking &quot;tens of millions in back pay for
    victims of the company's unfair labor practices&quot; and
    charges that the company &quot;has no intention of
    negotiating an honorable contract with the union.&quot; </p>
    <p>A delegation of 18 Japanese trade unionists from KOKURO,
    the Japan railway union, and other independent unions spent
    six days in the United States visiting and giving support to
    striking Bridge- stone/Firestone workers. The Japanese
    unionists staged peaceful protests in Firestone Service
    Centers in Chicago and Des Moines, Iowa, visited strikers in
    Decatur, Ill., and marched on Bridge- stone/Firestone's U.S.
    headquarters in Nashville, Tenn., with strikers from the
    USWA's Camp Justice. They also marched with striking Detroit
    newspaper employees. </p>
    <p>&quot;We can't forgive the Japanese companies when they
    come to the United States and treat their workers
    badly,&quot; said Yoshiaki Jingu, one of the delegation's
    leaders. </p>

<blockquote>
    <p align="center"><font size="4"><strong>Northwest workers
    seek just rewards<br>
    </strong></font>by<br>
    David Kameras </p>
    <p>It's payback time for workers at Northwest Airlines. </p>
    <p>Three years ago, workers helped keep the then-ailing
    carrier out of the bankruptcy courts by trading concessions
    for job security provisions and payback guarantees. Now that
    talks have opened for a new contract, unionists want what's
    rightfully theirs. </p>
    <p>&quot;Flight attendants sacrificed for years to make
    Northwest Airlines a success story,&quot; said Bruce Retrum,
    president of Teamsters Local 2000, which represents the
    flight attendants. &quot;Now it's the flight attendants' turn
    to get their reward -- pay they can live on, job security and
    pension improvements.&quot; </p>
    <p>Northwest led its competitors last year in profits per
    employee, and top managers reaped the benefits in the form of
    millions of dollars in bonuses and exercised stock options. </p>
    <p>&quot;It's been a long and grueling three years,&quot;
    said Eunice DePinto, a 17-year flight attendant based in
    Seattle. &quot;We've made a lot of money for a lot of people,
    and we're ready to be rewarded for our efforts.&quot; </p>
    <p>The amount of the &quot;snap-ups&quot; -- the pay increase
    over the restoration of 1993 pay levels -- may be a point of
    contention between management and the Teamsters, as it
    already has been with the Air Line Pilots. The Machinists
    also are due snap-ups, as all three unions head into
    negotiations over the next several months. </p>
    <p>In response to a survey, more than 6,000 flight attendants
    indicated that their top bargaining priorities are
    improvements in compensation, retirement and scheduling
    flexibility. </p>
    <p>&quot;I'm not going to retire next year, but I'd like to
    see a good retirement for all of us,&quot; added M.K.
    Sagastume, a flight attendant based in Detroit. &quot;When
    the flight attendants at the top can retire, it opens up
    opportunities for everyone down the line and gives us a
    chance to bring more people in at the bottom.&quot; </p>
    <p>With fours years at Northwest, Sagastume still lacks the
    seniority to be assured of a definite advance schedule. </p>
    <p>Unity will be the watchword as the unionists brave the
    negotiating season. </p>
    <p>&quot;The concessions we've been through have shown us
    that we have to look out for each other and stick together
    and look at ourselves, not as a bunch of individual people,
    but as a union,&quot; said Carrie Trettel, an 11-year veteran
    from Boston. </p>
    <p>In other industry developments: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>The Transportation Department turned down a request
            by the Flight Attendants to investigate the
            department's conduct in tentatively finding ValuJet
            fit to resume operations following the May 11 crash
            in Miami. </li>
    </ul>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Charging that DoT has lowered the safety standard it
        expects airline executives to meet, AFA President Pat
        Friend said undue influence by the carrier and members of
        Congress pressured the department to turn &quot;a blind
        eye toward one of the most frightening safety records in
        the airline industry.&quot; </p>
    </blockquote>
    <ul>
        <li>Voting has begun for Teamsters representation of
            mechanics at ValuJet, which was grounded amid reports
            that maintenance work had been contracted out to
            poorly paid subcontractors. </li>
        <li>Flight attendants at Continental Airlines,
            represented by the IAM, ratified a
            three-and-a-half-year contract that features
            significant pay raises, job protections and improved
            vacation and sick leave. </li>
    </ul>

    <p>UNITE members were voting on a tentative agreement reached
    Sept. 9 with the multiemployer association representing
    cotton garment companies. </p>
    <p>The agreement, which covers 30,000 employees in the cotton
    garment industry nationwide, was recommended by the
    negotiation committee. The ratification vote, which began
    immediately, was expected to be completed Sept. 23. The
    previous agreement expired Aug. 31. </p>
    <p>Some of the nation's largest manufacturers in the cotton
    garment industry are members of the multiemployer group,
    including Arrow Shirt, Biltwell, Pendleton Woolen Mills,
    Manhattan Shirt and The Apparel Group. </p>
    <p><a name="SEIU ends hospital strike ">SEIU ends hospital

    <p>Members of Service Employees Local 144 in New York City
    ended a two-month strike Aug. 27 after ratifying a new
    three-year agreement with 13 hospitals and nursing homes. </p>
    <p>Some 6,700 technical, service and maintenance employees
    walked out June 24 after talks broke down over cost-cutting
    proposals by the League of Voluntary Hospitals, which
    represented management. The previous contract expired Dec. 1,
    1995. </p>
    <p>The new contract calls for lump-sum payments of $750 in
    1996 and 1997 and $1,000 in 1998. Medical care benefits and
    education benefits also were improved. </p>
    <p><a name="BCT, Nabisco agree ">BCT, Nabisco agree </a></p>
    <p>The Bakery, Confectionery and Tobacco Workers
    overwhelmingly approved a new five-year contract with Nabisco
    Biscuit Co. that raises wages and benefits by $4.61 an hour
    over it's term. </p>
    <p>The contract is a &quot;win-win&quot; for both sides, BCT
    Secretary- Treasurer and lead negotiator Gene McDonald said.
    The successful outcome is the result of a mutually productive
    relationship developed by the company and union over time, he
    said. In February, representatives from each of the 10
    Nabisco plants and the international met with company
    officials to draft a &quot;vision statement&quot; for the
    future and a &quot;road map&quot; to get there. </p>
    <p>The new contract calls for an hourly wage increase of 40
    cents the first year, followed by raises of 50 cents, 60
    cents, 50 cents and 60 cents. The company also agreed to
    increase pension fund contributions each year and to improve
    health care benefits. </p>
    <p><a name="TCU ratifies contract ">TCU ratifies contract </a></p>
    <p>Members of the Transportation Communications Union
    overwhelmingly ratified agreements with the nation's major
    freight railroads that will yield 16.9 percent wage increases
    by the end of the century. </p>
    <p>The contracts cover 20,000 clerks and 12,000 carmen, who
    voted in favor by margins of 86 percent and 76 percent,
    respectively. The pacts also provide for post-contract
    cost-of-living adjustments every six months, no rule
    concessions and, in 1999, improved health care and dental
    benefits and a new vision plan. </p>
    <p><a name="Albertson pact approved ">Albertson pact approved </a></p>
    <p>Members of Food and Commercial Workers Local 7 ratified a
    new three-year contract with Albertson's supermarkets that
    gives hourly 35-cent raises each year to entry-level
    employees. </p>
    <p>Also, workers in the top categories will receive a
    30-cent-an- hour raise each year. The contract improves
    pension benefits and maintains the current bonus program.
    About 2,500 retail workers and meatcutters in 29 stores in
    Denver, Colorado Springs, Boulder and Longmont, Colo., are
    covered by the deal. The previous contract expired May 11. </p>
    <p>Many of the provisions mirror those in contracts with the
    state's largest grocers, King Soopers and Safeway. But a key
    change, allowing management more flexibility in scheduling,
    did not appear in the Albertson's contract. </p>
    <p>Negotiations with Albertson's were put on hold this summer
    after Local 7 began a 44-day strike against King Soopers and
    were locked out by its bargaining partner, Safeway. Despite
    the delay, negotiators met 22 times trying to complete a new
    agreement. </p>

    <p>AFL-CIO News - September 20, 1996 </p>
    <p><a name="Pact ends vet home strike "><strong>Pact ends vet
    home strike </strong></a></p>
    <p>Striking AFSCME members at the Anna, Ill., veterans' home
    ratified their first contract Sept. 12, clearing their return
    to work after walking the bricks for some five weeks. </p>
    <p>The three-year pact with ServiceMaster Diversified Health
    Services calls for increases totaling nearly $4 over term --
    from $4.60 to $4.71 an hour to $8.25 to $8.50 an hour -- and
    includes employer-provided health insurance, additional paid
    leave, holiday pay, a 401(k) program, grievance procedures
    and regular labor- management meetings. </p>
    <p>&quot;This agreement is a victory for the workers, for the
    veterans they serve and for all of Southern Illinois,&quot;
    said Henry Bayer, executive director of AFSCME Council 31.
    &quot;These workers have demonstrated the power that even a
    small group of employees can wield when they are committed,
    when they have the courage of their convictions and when they
    are united by the strength of union representation.&quot; </p>
    <p>As part of the settlement, Diversified agreed to return
    all of the striking workers to their jobs. </p>
    <p><a name="Peerless show crashed "><strong>Peerless show
    crashed </strong></a></p>
    <p>UNITE members continued to put pressure on Montreal's
    Peerless Clothing Co. as they staged a major protest outside
    the biannual MAGIC (Men's Apparel Guild in California) show
    in Las Vegas. </p>
    <p>About 500 members distributed leaflets and chanted
    &quot;Shame on Peerless,&quot; as another 50 went inside the
    convention site to do the same. </p>
    <p>Peerless is a leading men's suit manufacturer and exports
    95 percent of its line to the United States. </p>
    <p>UNITE began its national protest campaign almost a year
    ago, citing sexual and racial harassment and illegal firings
    of members of the mostly immigrant work force. Workers have
    filed 34 complaints with the Quebec government charging
    Peerless with ethnic discrimination and other civil rights
    violations. </p>
    <p><a name="IBT backs Avis sale "><strong>IBT backs Avis sale </strong></a></p>
    <p>After reaching an agreement this summer with Avis over
    employee job security, the Teamsters endorsed the $800
    million sale of the company to HFS Inc., a national
    franchiser of hotels and residential real estate brokerage
    offices. </p>
    <p>Avis employees who are participants in the car rental
    company's employee stock ownership plan will be voting over
    the next few weeks on the sale. </p>
    <p>The IBT negotiated a series of protective measures with
    Avis related to the proposed sale. IBT represents more than
    3,000 Avis employees. </p>
    <p><a name="R.I. gets a raise "><strong>R.I. gets a raise </strong></a></p>
    <p>Rhode Island's working poor got some relief Sept. 1 when
    the state's minimum wage rose from $4.45 to $4.75 an hour; it
    will rise again to $5.15 next Jan. 1. </p>
    <p>The maximum allowance for gratuities in such businesses as
    hotels and restaurants will increase from 35 percent to 50
    percent, with a minimum cash wage of $2.89 an hour. There is
    no training wage. </p>
    <p>The income boost &quot;is a step toward making sure that
    people who make minimum wage don't live in poverty,&quot;
    state AFL-CIO Secretary- Treasurer George Nee said. </p>
    <p>Meanwhile, the New York City Council voted 44-5 to
    override a veto of a bill to require city contractors to pay
    prevailing wages. Mayor Rudolph W. Guiliani (R) has
    threatened legal action. </p>
    <p><a name="Sweatshops pay up "><strong>Sweatshops pay up </strong></a></p>
    <p>The Labor Department's Wage and Hour Division recovered
    $699,323 in back wages between April and June 1996 for 2,486
    garment workers who illegally were denied minimum wage or
    overtime pay. </p>
    <p>Meanwhile, criminal charges were filed after a series of
    August raids in Brooklyn, N.Y., garment shops, including one
    linked to the celebrity Kathy Ireland label. </p>
    <p>New York led the nation in wage-and-hour violations with
    56 violations, and California followed closely behind with
    49. During the third fiscal quarter, the largest back-pay
    award -- $113,457 -- went to workers of Truong Sewing in
    Garland, Texas. </p>
    <p>The Brooklyn raids resulted from a two-month investigation
    by the district attorney's office, fire and finance
    departments and state labor department. The charges involved
    violations of the city's fire safety code and the state
    minimum wage law's prohibition on piecework. </p>

<blockquote>
    <p align="center"><font size="4"><strong>Young will lead
    Paperworkers <br>
    Convention concentrates on organizing, politics</strong></font><br>
    by<br>
    James B. Parks </p>
    <p>Las Vegas </p>
    <p>The Paperworkers elected new leaders and set a course for
    the year 2000 that emphasizes organizing and political
    action. </p>
    <p>The convention, which retiring President Wayne E. Glenn
    called &quot;a watershed in terms of policy and
    direction,&quot; was the first since the 1994 merger with the
    Allied Industrial Workers. </p>
    <p>To lead the union, delegates elected Boyd D. Young as
    president to succeed Glenn, who had reached mandatory
    retirement age under the union constitution.
    Secretary-Treasurer James Dunn was re-elected without
    opposition. Glenn, who served 18 years as president, was
    elected president emeritus. </p>
    <p>Young, 56, was vice president for Region VI which includes
    Texas and Louisiana. He received 14,338 votes, defeating
    Gerald Johnston, who received 8,357 votes. Besides Young and
    Dunn, delegates elected three new members of the executive
    board to replace retiring members. They rejected a move to
    add two rank-and- file members, one a woman and the other a
    person of color, to the executive board. </p>
    <p>The 2,200 delegates voted to intensify organizing efforts
    by training representatives, organizers and local union
    leaders in organizing techniques. They also called for the
    union to develop a strategy for including retirees in
    organizing and political action efforts. </p>
    <p>After an emotional debate, delegates rejected a proposal
    to reduce the number of regions from 11 to 8. Supporters
    claimed it would improve union efficiency. </p>
    <p>AFL-CIO President John J. Sweeney, citing labor's recent
    legislative wins on the minimum wage, health care reform,
    defeat of the TEAM Act and so-called right-to-work laws,
    praised the UPIU for pioneering some of the new tactics and
    strategies that the federation is using. </p>
    <p>&quot;Instead of playing by the old political rules, we're
    lifting the lid off the House and the Senate and letting in
    some sunshine. Instead of being victimized by outmoded
    traditions of collective bargaining, we're exposing the
    actions and motives of our employers,&quot; Sweeney said. </p>
    <p>The federation has shifted its legislative focus from
    Washington into congressional districts &quot;where
    politicians have to listen,&quot; Sweeney said. &quot;We've
    taken our contract fights out of the suites and into the
    streets. When an employer or a politician crosses us, we take
    them on, aggressively and publicly. When a boss goes bad, we
    get mad.&quot; </p>
    <p>Sweeney also paid tribute to UPIU's bargaining successes.
    &quot;Don't let me forget the members of this union who took
    a stand for all of us and said `No, hell no' to Trailmobile
    and Menominee Paper Co. and Finch Pruyn. Thank you for
    teaching us to win again.&quot; </p>
    <p>Other speakers included Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers
    President Robert Wages, AFSCME President Gerald McEntee and
    AFL-CIO Political Director Steve Rosenthal. </p>

<p align="center"><font size="4"><strong>IBEW prepares for
hi-tech future</strong></font><br>
by<br>
Colleen M. O'Neill </p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Philadelphia </p>
    <p>Electrical Workers President John J. Barry and Secretary
    Jack F. Moore were overwhelmingly re-elected in a convention
    that featured electronic voting, a laser show and other
    hi-tech touches that kept delegates focused on the union's
    future. </p>
    <p>The more than 2,400 delegates used touch-screen electronic
    voting to select Moore and Barry by a nearly 5-1 margin over
    challengers Mike Lucas and Forrest Darby. Re-elected without
    opposition were Treasurer Thomas Van Arsdale and Executive
    Council Chairman Clyde Bowden. </p>
    <p>&quot;We must go beyond the parochial concerns of one
    branch or another and face squarely the larger issues that
    bind us together and will affect our common fate,&quot; Barry
    said in his keynote address. &quot;We in the IBEW want a
    world where a man can go to a safe workplace, earn a fair
    wage and use his skills to do a good day's work. </p>
    <p>We want a world where a woman can develop her talents to
    the fullest and have a wealth of opportunity before
    her,&quot; he said, &quot;where workers can retire with
    dignity, with the security of knowing that their health care
    is affordable and available . . . and where workers can
    organize and bargain collectively to achieve all these things
    in fairness and in justice.&quot; </p>
    <p>AFL-CIO President John J. Sweeney vowed the federation's
    grass-roots legislative and political campaigns would help
    bring a progressive majority back into control in the House,
    pick up a couple of Senate seats and re-elect President
    Clinton and Vice President Gore. </p>
    <p>Delegates defeated a proposal to allow Canadian locals to
    hold a separate convention, reaffirmed their opposition to an
    age limit of 65 for international officers (the question had
    been defeated in a spring referendum), raised the salaries of
    some international officers and changed their pensions. </p>
    <p>Vigorous debate was held over resolutions to create an
    Electric Utility Industry Advancement Fund by increasing per
    capita of utility locals, to assess each member $1 per month
    to fight utility deregulation and to create a Utility
    Industry Advancement Fund by using current per capita funds.
    Ultimately, delegates decided to return the matters to the
    committee for further work. </p>
    <p>Another major issue that divided the delegates was a
    proposed constitutional change to require a secret ballot
    election for the top four officers. After two days of debate
    on three such resolutions, the convention approved a
    substitute amendment that requires secret ballots in the
    future. </p>
    <p>Also addressing the convention were Secretary of Labor
    Robert B. Reich, Pennsylvania AFL-CIO President William
    George, Philadelphia Mayor Edward Rendell and labor's priest,
    Msgr. George Higgins of Catholic University. &#160;</p>

    J. Norton told the nearly 500 delegates that &quot;we must
    embrace it so our employers can stay competitive. But
    technological change causes workers to be displaced.&quot; </p>
    <p>&quot;Staying abreast in the industry has to continue
    indefinitely, because technology will not leave us in 1996
    and is likely to impact on us in the next four years,&quot;
    he said. </p>
    <p>Delegates approved increases in the per capita tax of 75
    cents in 1997 and again in 1999, with organizing on their
    minds. </p>
    <p>&quot;Without organizing, we jeopardize our existing wages
    and working conditions,&quot; Norton said. &quot;With a
    successful organizing program, we assure a continuation of
    financial and workplace gains along with pension improvements
    that are the lifeblood of a successful union.&quot; </p>
    <p>AFL-CIO President John J. Sweeney lauded the union for its
    coordinated bargaining campaign with Quebecor, the largest
    single- employer effort in the union's history, and urged
    delegates to fully involve themselves in the fall election
    campaign. </p>
    <p>&quot;Two years ago, we lost 29 congressional districts to
    `Newtie and the Blowhards' by less than 5,000 votes,&quot;
    Sweeney said. &quot;In those districts, we had two to three
    times that many union members who didn't even vote. So your
    work, your commitment can and will make a difference.&quot; </p>
    <p>&quot;On Nov. 5, we're going to reach down and root out
    the ugliness that has grabbed hold of our nation,&quot; he
    said. &quot;And that's a promise. That's a commitment.&quot; </p>
    <p>The convention took up a number of resolutions regarding
    such diverse topics as organizing, striker replacement and
    political action. </p>
    <p>Speakers included AFL-CIO Building and Construction Trades
    Department President Robert A. Georgine; Canadian Labour
    Congress President Robert White; Ontario Federation of Labour
    President Gordon Wilson; and Tony Dobbins, general secretary
    of Britain's Graphical Paper and Media Union. </p>

    <p align="center"><font size="4"><strong>`Organize all farm
    workers'<br>
    UFW plans for growth,new fights for justice<br>
    </strong></font><font size="3">by<br>
    </font>Sharolyn A. Rosier </p>
    <p>Fresno, Calif. </p>
    <p>Fired up after gaining more than 35,000 new members in the
    last four years, the Farm Workers outlined new goals for the
    union and pushed its effort to organize strawberry workers to
    center stage. </p>
    <p>&quot;The organizing won't stop with the strawberry
    workers. We will organize all farm workers,&quot; UFW
    President Arturo Rodriguez told the 500 delegates to the
    union's 13th convention in Fresno, Calif., over the Labor Day
    weekend. </p>
    <p>The UFW's intensive organizing has made it the nation's
    fastest-growing union, and AFL-CIO President John J. Sweeney
    held it up as a model for the rest of the labor movement. </p>
    <p>&quot;We must organize more workers as you in the Farm
    Workers union are doing,&quot; Sweeney said. &quot;Whatever
    we do, we must ask, how does this help us grow and give
    workers more power? Because if we don't grow in big numbers,
    we cannot survive.&quot; </p>
    <p>Sweeney's address was the first ever by an AFL-CIO
    president to the UFW convention. </p>
    <p>Sweeney, Rodriguez and Secretary-Treasurer Dolores Huerta,
    co- founder of the union, led about 200 strawberry workers
    from the Salinas-Watsonville area in a march around the
    convention center floor, shouting, &quot;Strawberry workers
    united will never be defeated.&quot; </p>
    <p>&quot;These workers are among the most exploited in all of
    agriculture,&quot; Rodriguez said. &quot;We will continue
    until they receive the benefits of a union contract.&quot; </p>
    <p>The march preceded the second national day of action in
    support of the strawberry workers in 50 cities around the
    nation on Sept. 16. (See story, Page 12). </p>
    <p>The strawberry campaign is not as difficult as the famous
    grape boycott led by the union's founder, Cesar Chavez,
    Rodriguez said. Strawberries must be picked within days or
    they become overripe and rapidly lose value, giving the union
    more leverage, he said. </p>
    <p>Political action in the form of a voter registration card
    is as important as organizing and gaining a union card,
    Housing and Urban Development Secretary Henry Cisneros told
    the delegates. &quot;If you don't have a vote, you don't have
    a voice. With the vote, we can take our children to the
    future. I want to see a Latino governor of California,&quot;
    he said. </p>
    <p>One of the highlights of the convention was a tribute to
    Chavez, who died four years ago. Delegates constantly shouted
    &quot;Si Se Puede&quot; (Yes We Can), Chavez's rallying cry.
    An emotional high point came when six-year-old Angel Noriega
    of Fresno recited Chavez's famous definition of machismo.
    &quot;Machismo is not to hit your wife and not to have a beer
    with your friends. Machismo is not to bow down to your
    boss,&quot; Noriega said. </p>
    <p>Other speakers included Jack Henning, former executive
    secretary-treasurer of the California AFL-CIO; Miguel
    Contreras, executive secretary-treasurer of the Los Angeles
    AFL-CIO; Maria Elena Durazo, president of Hotel Employees and
    Restaurant Employees Local 11; and Elisco Medina, a vice
    president of the Service Employees. &#160;</p>

<p align="center"><font size="4"><strong>Prosperity eludes
hard-working U.S. families</strong></font><br>
by<br>
David Kameras </p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Despite job growth during the 1990s, the typical American
    family still faces considerable economic pain and
    uncertainty, according to several new studies. </p>
    <p>In &quot;Running in Place: Trends in U.S. Living
    Standards,&quot; the bipartisan Competitive Policy Council
    concludes that workers are toiling longer hours for less pay,
    and even the evolution of two- earner households hasn't
    helped working families keep up. </p>
    <p>The Economic Policy Institute's annual &quot;The State of
    Working America&quot; also found a continuing deterioration
    of hourly wages for all but the top 20 percent of male
    earners and most female earners between 1989 and 1995. The
    combination of falling wages and increased job loss, largely
    a blue-collar phenomenon in the 1980s, has now moved up the
    income scale at the same time that fringe benefits have
    eroded, EPI reported. </p>
    <p>&quot;For the vast American middle class and for
    low-income families, neither the 1979-89 nor the 1989-95
    business cycles have brought increased prosperity,&quot; the
    report said. &quot;American families are beset by a long-term
    erosion in wages, deteriorating job quality and greater
    economic insecurity.&quot; </p>
    <p>&quot;There seems to be no overall gain or efficiency
    payoff associated with all the evident pain,&quot; economists
    Lawrence Mishel, Jared Bernstein and John Schmitt wrote.
    &quot;There is no evidence that the economic squeeze on
    families is part of some sacrifice that will improve economic
    conditions in a way that will benefit families in the
    future.&quot; </p>
    <p>The researchers pointed to the weakening of union
    protections and the right to organize and bargain
    collectively, as well as such diverse factors as
    deregulation, globalization, tax inequity and weakened
    safety, health and environmental rules, as contributing to
    structural changes in the economy that place workers at a
    disadvantage. </p>
    <p>Mishel and Bernstein also conducted one of two studies on
    which the Competitiveness Policy Council based its report. In
    &quot;Trouble in Paradise: Eroding Wages and Growing Income
    Inequality,&quot; they found that median family income after
    inflation in 1993 ($36,959) was only marginally higher than
    it was in 1973 ($36,893) even though many more families rely
    on two wage-earners than 20 years ago. </p>
    <p>With more families depending on two wage-earners, there
    has been a &quot;fundamental change in the way we earn our
    income,&quot; said Howard Rosen, the council's executive
    director. This has put greater pressure on working families,
    he noted. </p>
    <p>The other study by the council, conducted by Frank Levy of
    the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, found that most
    family incomes are rising only because the women in the
    households are working more hours. </p>
    <p>The EPI's Labor Day report included several key findings
    that buttressed its analysis. </p>
    <ul>
        <li>From 1989 to 1995, hourly wages plummeted 6.3 percent
            for the typical male worker. The drop was 1.7 percent
            for the typical female worker, partially reversing
            gains made during the 1980s.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>Median family income was down 5.2 percent, with the
            bottom 95 percent showing a loss. Besides continuing
            wage deterioration, the decline was attributable to
            the decreasing ability of contributions by working
            wives to offset the lower earnings of their husbands. </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>Since middle-class workers pay the same proportion of
            their income in taxes as they did in the late 1970s,
            &quot;the rise in inequality and fall in living
            standards reflect what employers aren't putting into
            paychecks, not what government is taking out in
            taxes.&quot; </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>Hourly compensation, which includes fringe benefits,
            has risen only 0.1 percent faster than hourly wages
            alone since 1979, while workers receiving
            employer-provided health benefits fell in 1979- 1993
            from 79 percent to 64 percent, and pension coverage
            fell from 48 percent to 45 percent. </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>The ratio of CEO pay to that of the average worker
            rose from 60:1 in 1978 to 173:1 in 1995, a year in
            which business after-tax profit rates reached a
            30-year high, fueled by stagnant or falling wages. </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>The benefits of the booming stock market eluded most
            workers, with only 28 percent of families owning more
            than $2,000 in stock, including shares owned through
            pension plans. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Despite lower wages and standard of living for most
    Americans, &quot;there is no evidence of our economy becoming
    more competitive or having improved in the fundamentals of
    capital accumulation or economic efficiency and
    productivity,&quot; the authors said. </p>
    <p>&quot;Government policy-makers and elected leaders must be
    judged on their ability to change the economic course of the
    country, to leave the low-wage for the high-wage path,&quot;
    they said. </p>

<blockquote>
    <p align="center"><font size="4"><strong>Real earnings rise
    with prices stable </strong></font></p>
    <p>Real weekly earnings rose a substantial 0.7 percent in
    August, as workers put in more hours for higher pay. </p>
    <p>Contributing to the improvement was stability in consumer
    prices, which increased only 0.1 percent in August. The
    annualized rate of 1.8 percent for the past three months
    indicates a significant slowing down of what was already a
    slim inflationary trend. </p>
    <p>The price data &quot;confirm the opinions of commentators
    who say that inflation is not a problem for
    policy-makers,&quot; said AFL-CIO economist Bill Cunningham. </p>
    <p>Nonetheless, the Federal Reserve Board has sought to use
    the recent federal minimum-wage boost as a pretext for
    raising interest rates to combat its superficial impact on
    inflation. The idea is that the higher cost of money will
    slow down business expansion and the jobs it creates, thereby
    holding down wages. The Fed will consider the possibility of
    raising interest rates Sept. 24. </p>
    <p>Ironically, current economic performance is calling into
    question the whole premise that reducing joblessness
    necessarily results in higher prices. </p>
    <p>Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich noted that the
    &quot;natural&quot; rate of unemployment is being re-defined
    downward as sustained employment levels coincide with stable
    prices. </p>
    <p>&quot;It seems to me that in making decisions about how
    vigorously we wage war on inflation, we should fully consider
    those who are most likely to be the war's first
    casualties,&quot; he said. </p>

<blockquote>
    <p align="center"><font size="4"><strong>Jobless rate at
    seven-year low<br>
    Layoffs are continuingas economy expands</strong></font><br>
    by<br>
    David Kameras </p>
    <p>The unemployment rate fell from 5.4 percent to 5.1 percent
    in August, the lowest level in seven years. Still, millions
    of workers have yet to benefit from the economic recovery,
    now in its 65th month. </p>
    <p>Including underutilized and discouraged workers, the rate
    was 9.3 percent, or 12.7 million workers. </p>
    <p>Employment rose by 250,000, with 10 percent of that in
    manufacturing, led by motor vehicle and equipment
    fabrication. </p>
    <p>In addition to August's improved jobless figures, the rate
    at which workers are being laid off over the past three years
    is less than that for the previous three years. But 3.8
    million long-term employees still got pink slips between 1993
    and 1995. Long-term workers are defined as those over the age
    of 20 who have held a job for at least three years. </p>
    <p>&quot;The data from the earlier period reflected the
    impact of the 1990-91 recession and the slow labor market
    recovery that followed,&quot; said the Bureau of Labor
    Statistics, which compiled the figures. &quot;In contrast,
    the February 1996 survey covered a period of employment
    expansion and declining unemployment.&quot; </p>
    <p>Yet the layoff process continues: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Union Pacific Railroad, which is merging with
            Southern Pacific Railroad, will cut 1,200 jobs in
            Denver over the next two years.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>Campbell Soup Co., which prefers buying out a German
            soupmaker to retaining its own employees, is planning
            to cut 650 jobs.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>Pendleton Woolen Mills is closing its
            UNITE-represented Sellwood plant at the cost of 119
            jobs, a move that even management attributes to the
            North American Free Trade Agreement and the General
            Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>On the upside, Boeing Co. is hiring 5,000 more
            workers than previously anticipated. And UNITE has
            traded wage concessions to save two-thirds of 650
            apparel jobs slated for elimination at M. Wile Co. in
            Buffalo, N.Y. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>&quot;While the decline in job dislocation is a positive
    trend, the report also confirms that some American workers
    who lose their jobs remain unemployed and, for those who do
    find new jobs, many experience a drop in earnings,&quot; said
    Joseph E. Stiglitz, chairman of President Clinton's Council
    of Economic Advisers. </p>
    <p>While 73 percent of the laid-off full-time workers were
    re- employed by February 1996, half were unable to match or
    exceed their previous earnings, and a third suffered losses
    of 20 percent or more. Those in the 25-to-54 age group had
    the highest re- employment rate, 78 percent. </p>
    <p>Manufacturing continued to take the brunt of the
    displacement (29 percent). While men were more likely to be
    laid off, they were also more likely to be re-employed. </p>
    <p>&quot;This report underscores the importance of increasing
    access to education and worker training and protecting
    dislocated workers' health and pension benefits to help ease
    job transition and reduce the cost of job loss to American
    workers,&quot; Stiglitz said. </p>
    <p>That process may be made more difficult by the huge influx
    of welfare recipients into the labor market as a result of
    the GOP welfare reform package signed by President Clinton.
    Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich has indicated that the
    administration will seek a targeted tax credit to encourage
    employers to hire those struggling to get off the dole. </p>
    <p>Specific data for July showed Washington, D.C., with the
    nation's highest unemployment rate (9 percent), followed by
    Alaska (7.6 percent), California and New Mexico (both 7.1
    percent). North Dakota had the lowest (2.8 percent), followed
    by Nebraska (2.9 percent), South Dakota (3 percent) and Utah
    (3.1 percent). </p>

<blockquote>
    <p align="center"><font size="4"><strong>Yawning trade gap
    swallows workers </strong></font></p>
    <p>America's international trade imbalance worsened
    considerably in the second quarter, with the merchandise
    deficit jumping from $12.4 billion to $19.6 billion. </p>
    <p>Imports of goods and services soared at a 14 percent
    annual rate, up from a rapid 12 percent gain in the first
    quarter. Excluding oil, imported merchandise met a record
    26.5 percent of demand for goods in the second quarter. </p>
    <p>&quot;The figures demonstrate once again that the
    continued growing deficit in trade constitutes the greatest
    area of weakness in the economy,&quot; said Mark Anderson,
    director of the AFL-CIO Task Force on Trade. &quot;That
    deficit continues to represent a drag on wages.&quot; </p>
    <p>From January to July, the goods deficit with Japan was
    $26.6 billion, 29 percent less than during the same period
    last year. However, the trade imbalance with China was $19.5
    billion. </p>
    <p>The $23 billion cumulative goods trade deficit with the
    other signatories to the North American Free Trade Agreement
    was up 26 percent from the first seven months of 1995, with a
    deficit of $13.3 billion scored with Canada, and with Mexico,
    $9.7 billion. </p>
    <p>It would be hard to blame the deficit on excessive wages.
    Once the world leader in earning power, the American factory
    worker has slipped behind his counterparts in Japan and 10
    European countries in terms of hourly compensation costs. </p>
    <p>&quot;The international comparisons of compensation costs
    show that other developed countries have industrial systems
    that value workers,&quot; said AFL-CIO economist Greg
    Woodhead. &quot;If the basis for international competition is
    low wages and low standards of worker protection, the United
    States is leading in the race to the bottom.&quot; </p>

    <p align="center"><font size="4"><strong>Newsmakers</strong></font><br>
    Compiled by <br>
    Muriel H. Cooper </p>
    <p>Delegates to the South Carolina AFL-CIO convention elected
    Donna DeWitt, a member of the Communications Workers, as
    president to fill the unexpired term of G.O. Smoak, who
    retired. The convention quickly adjourned on the first day so
    that delegates could return to their homes as recent
    hurricanes bore down on the state. </p>
    <p>Suzanne Granville has been appointed assistant director
    for grass-roots activity in the Legislative Department at the
    AFL-CIO. Granville, 35, worked in a similar position with the
    Letter Carriers. </p>
    <p>Karla Garland has been named the director of public
    affairs for the AFL-CIO's Housing Investment Trust. Garland
    previously served as a media spokesperson for the AFL-CIO and
    coordinator for media and marketing in its broadcast
    division. Garland, the former Newspaper Guild unit chair,
    joined the federation in 1974. </p>
    <p>Chris Woods is the new chief of staff for the AFL-CIO
    Organizing Department. Woods previously served as national
    recruitment director for the Organizing Institute. Before
    that she was an organizer for the Clothing and Textile
    Workers, now UNITE. </p>
    <p>President Clinton announced his intent to nominate AFL-CIO
    President Emeritus Lane Kirkland to the board of directors of
    the U.S. Institute of Peace. The bipartisan board was
    established in 1948 by Congress to promote international
    peace and the resolution of international conflict without
    violence, through education, training, research and public
    information. </p>
    <p>President Clinton named John E. Higgins to fill a vacancy
    on the five-member National Labor Relations Board. Higgins, a
    Republican, currently serves as the agency's acting inspector
    general. </p>
    <p>John Calhoun Wells, director of the Federal Mediation and
    Conciliation Service (FMCS) has selected C. Richard Barnes as
    deputy director for field operations. Barnes will oversee
    nearly 200 federal mediators in the country. Prior to joining
    FMCS, Barnes was a Laborers' district council manager. </p>
    <p>Two union presidents have been elected to the Railway
    Labor Executives' Association. W.D. &quot;Dan&quot; Pickett
    of the Railroad Signalmen was elected chair and Clarence V.
    Monin of the Locomotive Engineers vice chair for the
    association. </p>
    <p>Maryland Gov. Parris Glendening joined AFL-CIO President
    John J. Sweeney at the George Meany Labor Studies Center
    Sept. 13 to unveil a new program that will enable community
    college students enrolled in labor studies programs in
    Maryland to transfer their credits to four-year institutions.
    The Meany Center's Maryland Institute for Labor Education
    (MILE) program is expected to be a national model for
    community-based union leadership education. </p>
    <p>AWARDS </p>
    <p>The Letter Carriers is honoring four workers as
    &quot;Heroes of the Year.&quot; Joan Barr will receive the
    National Hero of the Year award for her actions in crawling
    under an Amtrak train to try and save victims trapped inside
    a burning commuter train in suburban Washington, D.C. Donald
    Coldwell was selected as the National Humanitarian for his
    family's commitment to provide foster care. </p>
    <p>Regional heroes include Guy A. Young from Manchester,
    N.H., who helped save an infant trapped in an overturned van;
    Mark A. Hopkins of Chicago, who saved an elderly man being
    assaulted and robbed at an ATM machine; and Carlos E.
    Tichenor of Topeka, Kan., who came to the assistance of a
    police officer overpowered by a disorderly man at a post
    office. </p>
    <p>Bricklayers Local 1 in Detroit won the &quot;Best Brick
    Project&quot; award from the International Masonry Institute
    for its construction of the new Veterans Administration
    Hospital. </p>
    <p>Farm Workers President Arturo Rodriguez will receive the
    Labor Award from the Southern California Americans for
    Democratic Action. </p>
    <p>DEATHS </p>
    <p>Jesse A. Friedman, an international labor representative
    and union educator, died of cancer at age 62. </p>
    <p>Friedman, a longtime member of the Ladies' Garment
    Workers, now UNITE, devoted all of his professional life to
    organizing and supporting workers in the United States, Latin
    America and the Caribbean. He began his career working in the
    St. John's Labor Center in Annapolis, Md., and joined the
    U.S. Labor Department in 1960. In 1962, he was appointed
    assistant Latin American representative in the AFL-CIO's
    International Affairs Department. </p>
    <p>In 1967, Friedman joined the American Institute for Free
    Labor Development and served as regional director and deputy
    executive director before being named executive director in
    1996. From 1977 until his death, Friedman was a member of the
    AFL-CIO delegation to the annual conferences of the
    International Labor Organization, where he participated on
    many committees responsible for drafting standards designed
    to protect workers' rights. </p>
    <p>He is survived by his wife, four daughters and two
    brothers. </p>

    allies join forces for U.S. teach-ins<br>
    </strong></font><font size="3">by<br>
    </font>Colleen M. O'Neill </p>
    <p>America's workers are joining their academic allies in a
    national campaign on the re-energized labor movement. </p>
    <p>AFL-CIO President John J. Sweeney announced the new
    alliance at a Washington news conference Sept. 18 along with
    feminist author Betty Friedan, civil rights activist and
    history professor Roger Wilkins, American Association of
    University Professors President James E. Perley and other
    academics. </p>
    <p>&quot;This new initiative, `A Teach-In with the Labor
    Movement,' proves there is no gap between young Americans and
    those who nurture, mentor and teach them,&quot; Sweeney said.
    &quot;This teach-in adds a powerful new dimension to the
    development of the new and stronger voice for working
    families we're working so hard to create.&quot; </p>
    <p>The teach-ins are designed to promote a new spirit of
    engagement and activism by serving as a way to stimulate a
    national dialogue between academics and trade unionists.
    Subjects for discussion include immigration, the globalized
    economy, organizing among African-Americans, welfare and
    work, families and feminism, labor political action and
    culture, identity and class politics. </p>
    <p>A national event at Columbia University Oct. 3-4 kicks off
    the campaign. Joining Sweeney and Friedan at Columbia the
    first night will be Harvard theologian Cornel West,
    University of Virginia philosopher Richard Rorty and, from
    Columbia, historian Eric Foner and law professor Patricia
    Williams. </p>
    <p>AFL-CIO Secretary-Treasurer Richard L. Trumka and
    Executive Vice President Linda Chavez-Thompson lead a
    distinguished group of participants that includes AFL-CIO
    Working Women Director Karen Nussbaum, Columbia
    African-American Studies Chair Manning Marable, feminist
    essayist and poet Katha Pollitt, AFSCME International Area
    Director Jose LaLuz and Yale historian David Montgomery,
    among others. </p>
    <p>Regional teach-ins are scheduled throughout October at
    Wayne State University, Detroit; University of Cincinnati;
    Clinch Valley College, Wise, Va.; University of Nevada, Las
    Vegas; Eastern Illinois University, Charleston, Ill.;
    University of Texas at El Paso; University of Florida,
    Tallahassee; University of Wisconsin, Madison; and State
    University of New York-Geneseo. </p>

rolls on<br>
Minimum wage raise delivered by union drive <br>
</font><font size="3">by</font></p>
<p align="center">Mike Hall</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>With two dozen minimum- and low-wage workers and their
    children looking on, President Clinton signed legislation
    giving America's lowest-paid workers a 90-cent-an-hour raise
    during an Aug. 20 ceremony on the White House South Lawn. </p>
    <p>The AFL-CIO spearheaded the nationwide grass-roots drive
    that overcame deep-seated Republican hostility and all-out
    business opposition to the wage increase. </p>
    <p>That grass-roots effort continues in full swing.
    Television and radio ads, press conferences and public events
    held over the August recess let voters know about GOP moves
    to raid pensions, slash education and strip hundreds of
    billions of dollars in vital state and county aid. </p>
    <p>This followed up on earlier campaigns exposing GOP efforts
    to slash Medicare and Medicaid and block an increase in the
    minimum wage. </p>
    <p>The AFL-CIO campaign to educate the public on the issues
    and mobilize members around those issues has the strong
    backing of union members, a new poll reveals, with 72 percent
    approving of television and radio ads. The survey was
    conducted Aug 2-4 by Peter D. Hart Research Associates. </p>
    <p>Prior to the White House signing, AFL-CIO President John
    J. Sweeney told the workers and their children at the
    federation's headquarters, &quot;Six months ago nobody agreed
    with us that we would have an increase in the minimum wage.
    It's the result of you and your unions pushing your members
    of Congress that brings us here today.&quot; </p>
    <p>He also urged them &quot;to remain active in your
    communities and your unions.&quot; </p>
    <p>The first 45-cent increase in the minimum wage takes
    effect Oct. 1, boosting it from $4.25 to $4.70 an hour. The
    second 45-cent step takes place Sept. 1, 1997, bringing the
    minimum wage to $5.15. </p>
    <p>Clinton thanked the labor movement for its efforts on
    behalf of the minimum wage increase, noting that &quot;there
    are very few unions in America that have minimum wage
    workers. Most of these unions did this because they thought
    it was the right thing to do.&quot; </p>
    <p>Clinton also signed the Kennedy-Kassebaum health
    portability bill, which Sweeney called a &quot;step in the
    right direction&quot; while noting the &quot;serious and
    unmet need for broad health care reform.&quot; </p>
    <p>The signings mark a high point in what has been a fruitful
    legislative season for America's working families &thorn;
    defeat of the company union TEAM Act and a national
    right-to-work-law and an easing of the GOP attack on the
    Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the
    National Labor Relations Board. </p>
    <p>Labor's success despite a hostile, Republican-controlled
    Congress can be traced to the growing grass-roots involvement
    of working families. Angry at labor's victories, GOP leaders
    have attacked the AFL-CIO's efforts, using loaded questions
    and shoddy methodology to grandly announce that union members
    don't support the federation's efforts. </p>
    <p>The new Hart poll paints a more accurate picture. It found
    that nearly three-quarters of union members say that their
    unions should either maintain their current level of
    involvement in political activity or should increase it. </p>
    <p>Sixty-seven percent of the members have a positive
    reaction to the AFL-CIO's overall campaign &thorn; the media
    push plus grass-roots mobilizing and political organizing in
    congressional districts &thorn; to educate and inform
    members, with only 11 percent negative. </p>
    <p>Contrary to Republican arguments that a significant
    minority of union members back GOP policies and object to the
    federation's campaign, only 17 percent of those surveyed said
    they would be more likely to support a candidate who has
    solidly backed Newt Gingrich's GOP agenda in Congress. </p>
    <p>A solid majority of members support the way the AFL-CIO
    campaign is being funded. By 71-25 percent, members say they
    approve of using $1.80 from their regular dues on a one-time
    basis to inform union members about issues and elections. </p>
    <p>An Aug. 20 article in The Wall Street Journal confirms the
    AFL-CIO contention that GOP congressional leaders have
    launched a calculated anti-union campaign, in concert with
    business groups, to &quot;get even&quot; with unions for
    their mobilization efforts. </p>
    <p>The article noted the $30 million the GOP is spending to
    attack the AFL-CIO's ads and their use of libel and
    regulatory threats against television stations in an attempt
    to keep the ads off the air, although few stations have done
    so. </p>
    <p>Rep. John Boehner (R-Ohio) &quot;prodded business
    lobbyists&quot; to crank up their own multimillion-dollar
    counterpunch to the AFL-CIO, the article states. </p>
    <p>&quot;Wary of Federal Election Commission rules
    themselves, the GOP leaders deny coordinating their campaign
    with the business coalition. Some coalition members attend
    regular National Republican Congressional Committee briefings
    about which candidates need help,&quot; the Journal reported. </p>
    <p>Meanwhile, in the field, a new series of ads highlighting
    targeted legislators' votes to slash millions from a vital
    student loan program will begin airing this week. </p>
    <p>Dozens of press conferences and events have been held in
    Labor '96 congressional districts since the beginning of the
    August recess, highlighting GOP stances on pension issues
    (See story, this page), celebrating the minimum wage victory
    or outlining the devastating county-by-county impact of the
    GOP's proposed 1997 budget cuts. </p>
    <p>In Irving, Texas, House Majority Leader Richard K. Armey
    (R) got a chance to eat some of his words. Armey had said
    last year, &quot;I will fight the minimum wage increase with
    every fiber of my being.&quot; </p>
    <p>Union members and minimum-wage workers presented him with
    515 boxes &thorn; the minimum wage will rise to $5.15 an hour
    &thorn; of high fiber cereal. He did not invite the
    demonstrators in for breakfast. </p>
    <p>Rep. Steven C. LaTourette (R-Ohio) was greeted by a group
    of mourners dressed in black carrying a casket at his annual
    golf fund-raiser. </p>
    <p>The casket was covered with dead vines to represent the
    withering of such vital government programs as Medicare, Head
    Start, student loans and school lunches &thorn; all
    threatened by LaTourette's votes. </p>
    <p>&quot;His votes are against seniors, children, the
    disabled, college students and working families, so I guess
    the only people he really represents are the ones who can
    afford to take a day off work and pay for the privilege of
    playing golf with him,&quot; said Don Chadwick, a retired
    Paperworker and Labor '96 volunteer. </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Amid the hoopla of political conventions, that buzz you
    hear is union members from coast to coast massing for labor's
    ambitious drive to reclaim America for working families. </p>
    <p>Labor '96 was in full swing months ahead of the
    traditional Labor Day political launch, with 135 full-time
    coordinators mobilizing union members in 84 congressional
    districts across the country. As Republicans gathered Aug. 11
    for their convention in San Diego, the coordinators were
    mapping out get-out-the-vote strategies in a meeting with
    state federation officials and AFL-CIO staff. </p>
    <p>When the Democrats bring down the gavel for their
    convention in Chicago Aug. 26, just as the nation's attention
    turns back to school, those coordinators will be back in
    their districts explaining how some members of Congress had
    voted to drastically reduce the student loan program. </p>
    <p>The grass-roots activity keyed on student loans was
    accompanied by targeted television and radio advertisements
    on the issue, adding to the insistent &quot;air war&quot;
    volleys that have strafed anti-worker candidates throughout
    the year and raised the hackles of the extremist Republican
    leadership in Congress. </p>
    <p>&quot;The proof of the success we've been having so early
    in this campaign is the attacks that are being made against
    us &thorn; just because we have told the truth and just
    because we are mobilizing our membership,&quot; AFL-CIO
    President John J. Sweeney told the coordinators at the
    planning session held at the Maritime Institute of Technology
    and Graduate Studies in Linthicum Heights, Md. </p>
    <p>&quot;But we can't be overconfident,&quot; Sweeney said.
    &quot;The crucial part of your agenda is how the end game
    will be played out. We have to go all out. There's too much
    at stake.&quot; </p>
    <p>The stakes were raised even higher at the Republican
    convention, where delegates approved a party platform that
    embraced the company-union TEAM Act, called for the
    relaxation of labor laws including the Davis-Bacon and
    Service Contract Acts, as well as the overtime provisions of
    the Fair Labor Standards Act. It criticized teachers' unions,
    called for the privatization of government services and
    endorsed state &quot;right-to-work&quot; laws. </p>
    <p>The convention also nominated Bob Dole, who had unveiled a
    tax-cut proposal that would mostly benefit the wealthy while
    requiring massive cuts in Medicare, Medicaid, education,
    health and safety and other programs that serve working
    families. </p>
    <p>&quot;Working families have heard these promises before,
    and won't be fooled again,&quot; the AFL-CIO Executive
    Council said during its summer meeting in Chicago, pointing
    to the same kind of supply-side tax cuts in the `80s that had
    ballooned the deficit. Dole's supply- side cuts &quot;will
    only serve to widen the already obscene gap between rich and
    poor,&quot; it said. </p>
    <p>Working families were expecting to get a better hearing at
    the Democratic convention, where 795 delegates &thorn; fully
    one-quarter of the total &thorn; were union members. The
    Democratic Party platform draft embraced workers' rights to
    form unions and to bargain collectively, and rejected right
    to work and the TEAM Act. It also opposed efforts to gut the
    Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the
    National Labor Relations Board. </p>
    <p>Still, &quot;some forces within the Democratic Party would
    shrink from the commitment to make the economy work for
    working Americans,&quot; the AFL-CIO's top officers said in a
    statement that traced the traditional alliance between the
    labor movement and the Democrats. </p>
    <p>&quot;In the face of the harsh new global economy, they
    would minimize, not modernize, the institutions that offer
    working people a measure of security &thorn; an active
    national government, a social safety net and strong
    unions.&quot; </p>
    <p>The statement by Sweeney, Secretary-Treasurer Richard L.
    Trumka and Executive Vice President Linda Chavez-Thompson
    called upon the Democrats to: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Help working families share in the gains of a growing
            economy. </li>
        <li>Reaffirm their belief that working people must have
            an independent voice on their jobs and be partners
            with their employers, enjoying a share of the benefit
            of their efforts to make their companies vital and
            productive. </li>
        <li>Demand that corporate America show some
            responsibility to our communities and our country. </li>
        <li>Advance the idea that jobs must come with living
            wages, health care, training opportunities and secure
            pensions. </li>
        <li>Support social policies that lift the most vulnerable
            into jobs, instead of abandoning them and their
            children. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>The AFL-CIO &quot;enthusiastically supports the
    re-election of President Clinton and the return of a
    Democratic Congress,&quot; the executive officers said.
    &quot;We agree with President Clinton that his economic
    accomplishments are `a record to build on, not rest on.' Too
    many working families have not yet benefited from economic
    gains.&quot; </p>
    <p>The statement also pointed out that Labor `96 &quot;is
    independent of the major parties. It's about empowering
    working families &thorn; not electing Democrats or
    Republicans.&quot; </p>
    <p>Sweeney reiterated that point in his address to the
    coordinators at their planning session. &quot;We will not
    measure our success by the numbers of this election, but by
    our ability to talk to and motivate our membership,&quot; he
    said. &quot;This is about the future of the labor
    movement.&quot; </p>
    <p>Brenda Wood, who is coordinating Labor `96 efforts in two
    Washington state congressional districts, said her work is
    concentrated on &quot;involving the membership. We are
    talking about political issues, but we are really involved in
    internal organizing. We are building our unions.&quot; </p>
    <p>Indeed, the goal of Labor &thorn;96 is to create a
    permanent grass- roots structure in every congressional
    district that will allow working families to hold
    office-holders accountable for their actions. District
    coordinators are building that network by enlisting new
    volunteers, aiming at a core of 10,000 activists working to
    get out the vote this year. </p>
    <p>Those volunteers will be reaching out to union members
    throughout September and October, explaining the issues in
    the campaign and urging them to vote for candidates who will
    stand with them and their families. </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Union Summer is ending spectacularly for the AFL-CIO and
    for the young activists who lent a powerful new voice to the
    struggle for justice across the country. </p>
    <p>That voice, delivered in high volume and in theatrical
    performances, is being credited with gaining a first contract
    for workers at the plush Melrose Club resort in Hilton Head,
    S.C. </p>
    <p>Other organizing campaigns made breakthroughs as a result
    of the energy infusion of Union Summer, but the most lasting
    impact may have come in the positive impressions made in
    communities across the country, and on the young people being
    exposed for the first time to the trials of working people. </p>
    <p>&quot;We wanted to send a strong message to young people
    as well as to all working people that the labor movement is a
    strong voice for economic justice,&quot; AFL-CIO President
    John J. Sweeney told the Executive Council in Chicago.
    &quot;We have been very successful.&quot; </p>
    <p>&quot;This was one of the most concrete opportunities to
    do something to make the next generation of Americans
    overcome differences and diversity to unite and fight for
    justice at work,&quot; Andy Levin, director of the program,
    told the council. </p>
    <p>The Melrose win perhaps best symbolized the purpose and
    the promise of the federation's nine-week campaign. </p>
    <p>&quot;We had three goals &thorn; to get a contract, to
    gather information to set up other campaigns in the area and
    to get young people excited abut the labor movement,&quot;
    said Simon Greer, site coordinator in Charleston. &quot;And
    we did it.&quot; </p>
    <p>Three waves of activists built on the two years of work
    done by the Operating Engineers and the &quot;low
    country&quot; community surrounding the resort area to force
    Melrose into contract negotiations. On Aug. 14, workers
    celebrated a two-year contract that includes comprehensive
    health care, job security, wage increases, a grievance
    procedure and arbitration. </p>
    <p>&quot;The Union Summer activists walked into a heated
    battle,&quot; said Greer. &quot;Each wave stepped up the
    pressure, and just when it looked like Melrose was not going
    to crack, it cracked. Management said we won the war.&quot; </p>
    <p>The activists used a number of creative tactics, including
    guerrilla theater performances in various restaurants, pools
    and hotels on the resort island, running in the annual road
    race while demonstrating with signs to support the workers,
    and talking to the neighbors of Melrose's managers about
    workers' concerns. </p>
    <p>&quot;The union and Melrose employees have been fighting
    long and hard for this contract and we would not be
    celebrating this victory so early if not for the daily,
    in-your-face tactics of Union Summer activists,&quot; said
    David Miller an IUOE representative. </p>
    <p>In his report to the council, Levin noted that more than
    3,500 young people applied for Union Summer. Almost half of
    the applicants have parents who are union members.
    Fifty-eight percent of the June and July participants were
    women and 48 percent were people of color, reflecting the
    current rainbow work force. </p>
    <p>At least 26 unions put Union Summer activists to work on
    their organizing campaigns. Alliances were formed and
    strengthened with many community and religious organizations. </p>
    <p>Union Summer also has served as a union-building operation
    at the local level, said AFL-CIO Organizing Director Richard
    Bensinger. </p>
    <p>&quot;Union Summer has helped to energize local
    unions,&quot; he said. &quot;It has helped to create models
    for campaigns in which we allocate more resources to
    organizing, as well as involve rank and file and community
    allies in our efforts.&quot; </p>
    <p>Activists have worked closely with Jobs with Justice and
    ACORN (A Community Organization on Reform Now) at several
    sites, with Californians for Justice at three locations, the
    Carolina Alliance for Fair Employment (CAFE) in Hilton Head,
    the Summit County Organizing for Rights and Equality (SCORE)
    in Akron and various religious organizations on behalf of
    living wage initiatives. </p>
    <p>The interns immersed themselves in creative substance,
    distributing more than 150,000 leaflets, collecting more than
    65,000 signatures on petitions, conducting 4,088 house visits
    with workers in organizing campaigns and registering 3,237
    voters. </p>
    <p>Activists in Los Angeles leafleted Camachos Restaurant
    more than 15 times during a three-week period, convincing
    management to recognize the Hotel Employees and Restaurant
    Employees Local 814 and rehire all the workers whose status
    was disputed. </p>
    <p>Food and Commercial Workers Local 876 credited the work of
    activists with helping to wrestle a master contract and
    neutrality agreement from a Michigan drug store chain. </p>
    <p>Service Employees Local 790 said Union Summer house calls
    and work site visists were instrumental in winning a unit of
    substitutes teachers in the Oakland school district. </p>
    <p>Working with the Electrical Workers in Seattle, activists
    actually shut down a nonunion hiring hall. They showed up on
    Friday and announced they would be back on Monday at 5 a.m.
    When they arrived, the hall shut down, effectively putting
    the nonunion operation out of business for a day. </p>
    <p>&quot;For a young person to feel the power of that had a
    huge effect,&quot; Levin told the council. </p>
    <p>On Aug. 14, activists across the country leafleted grocery
    stores, seeking consumer support of strawberry farm workers
    who want a living wage, clean drinking water and bathrooms in
    the fields, health insurance, job security and an end to
    sexual harassment and other abuses. </p>
    <p>A three-weeklong Southern bus tour leafleted dozens of
    nursing homes in the deep South as part of the UFCW's
    &quot;Care For the Caregiver&quot; campaign. Several
    organizing leads came out of the effort and, in one case,
    activists helped gather signatures on union cards from the
    majority of the workers. </p>
    <p>About 200 of the participants now will go through the
    Organizing Institute. More than 50 activists were hired on
    the spot by unions to work on campaigns. </p>
    <p>&quot;The largest goal of Union Summer is to have an
    impact on the next generation, to get people to respect
    picket lines, to have unions and working people issues as
    fundamental part of their politics,&quot; said Levin. </p>

<blockquote>
    <p align="left">Hispanic Americans, the fastest-growing
    segment of the work force, are finding out that unions can be
    instrumental in helping them work their way up the economic
    ladder. </p>
    <p>&quot;If diversity is an asset for America &thorn; and it
    is &thorn; it is even more of an asset for the labor
    movement,&quot; said AFL-CIO Executive Vice President Linda
    Chavez-Thompson. &quot;America's unions are the best hope for
    winning higher wages, better benefits and more dignity for
    Latinos and other people of color.&quot; </p>
    <p>Richard Bensinger, AFL-CIO organizing director, sees
    Latinos as key to the future of the labor movement. &quot;The
    ranks of the movement cannot increase significantly without
    Latino workers,&quot; he said. </p>
    <p>The number of Latinos in the work force will increase 75
    percent by the year 2005, according to the Bureau of Labor
    Statistics. One out of six new workers will be Latino. </p>
    <p>Labor's involvement with Hispanic workers dates back to
    the founding of the Farm Workers in the early 1960s. From the
    1968 grape boycott to the Service Employees' Justice for
    Janitors demonstrations, unions have stood by Latinos in the
    workplace and in the halls of government. </p>
    <p>Besides the Farm Workers, other unions with strong
    traditions in organizing Latinos are SEIU, the Hotel
    Employees and Restaurant Employees, UNITE and AFSCME. But as
    their numbers increase, Latinos are finding homes in other
    unions as well. </p>
    <p>&quot;Many of the most successful organizing drives have
    involved mostly Latino workers &thorn; the Laborers on
    Maryland's Eastern Shore, UNITE in Dallas, the Carpenters
    during the drywallers' campaign, and the Farm Workers, which
    is the fastest-growing union in the country today,&quot;
    Bensinger said. &quot;The challenge to the labor movement is
    to recruit more Latino organizers.&quot; </p>
    <p>A major voice for Latinos in the labor movement is the
    Labor Council for Latin American Advancement, an AFL-CIO
    constituency group founded in 1972. Starting with a hundred
    delegates at its first convention, LCLAA hosted more than
    1,000 delegates at its August convention in Corpus Christi,
    Texas. </p>
    <p>Power through the union card and the ballot box is the
    message that LCLAA brings to Hispanic workers and their
    families, said LCLAA Executive Director Al Montoya.
    &quot;Many Hispanics have made big contributions to our
    nation in labor, business, politics, the arts, sports and
    other fields. But there are many more &thorn; unemployed and
    underemployed &thorn; who are denied such
    opportunities.&quot; </p>
    <p>The key is to provide good, steady jobs at decent pay to
    help Latinos make a full contribution to the economy and
    society, he explained. </p>
    <p>Young Latinos are ready and willing, as this year's Union
    Summer revealed. &quot;We have between 100 to 200 Latinos in
    Union Summer,&quot; said Andy Levin, the program director.
    &quot;We recruited at predominantly Hispanic colleges like
    Arizona State, San Francisco State University, Brookland
    Community College, the University of Texas at San Antonio and
    Los Angeles Community College.&quot; </p>
    <p>Several Latino recruits already are working with the UFW
    organizing strawberry pickers in Watsonville, Calif. Eight
    Latinos also serve as Union Summer field staff directors. </p>
    <p>Still, unions have a long way to go to break through to
    Latino workers. &quot;They know Cesar Chavez but they don't
    know about Linda Chavez-Thompson and Dolores Huerta,&quot;
    said Tania Rosaria, assistant coordinator for the Washington
    and Sacramento, Calif., Union Summer sites. </p>
    <p>&quot;Although it's hard to reach out to Latinos because
    there is no such thing as historically Latino colleges,&quot;
    she said, &quot;the labor movement must put information in
    Spanish because it shows a sense of pride and respect.&quot; </p>
    <p>Unions also must recognize cultural and background
    differences. Many immigrants witnessed the killing of union
    organizers in countries like Mexico and Cuba &thorn; and
    these experiences don't disappear with the crossing of the
    border. </p>
    <p>But the union card definitely means an escape out of
    poverty for Latinos, whose poverty rate is three times as
    high as the rate for white families. Hispanic workers who are
    union members earn 50 percent more than nonunion Hispanic
    workers, according to LCLAA. </p>
    <p>&quot;Within building services, there is a large
    percentage of Latino workers,&quot; said Anna Aviles,
    immigration coordinator for SEIU. &quot;The Justice for
    Janitors campaign is an ongoing effort we will continue to do
    as part of a new vision and leadership&quot; within the
    union. </p>
    <p>The union also has a pilot project to help immigrants
    become legal citizens so that they are eligible to vote in
    California. The project has been tested, and the union hopes
    to expand it to other areas and to include Asians. </p>
    <p>California unions have joined Latinos to fight divisive
    initiatives like Proposition 187, which would prohibit
    immigrants from receiving public aid and attending public
    schools. Although the proposition passed, enforcement is
    forbidden until courts render judgement on several lawsuits. </p>
    <p>With immigrant-bashing and attacks on affirmative action
    on the rise, these coalitions are becoming more important.
    Miguel Carreras, the newly elected executive
    secretary-treasurer of the Los Angeles AFL-CIO, was able to
    arrange the first meeting between Latino leaders and
    African-American ministers in Los Angeles. </p>
    <p>&quot;Unfortunately, everybody has been fighting for the
    crumbs,&quot; said David Sickler of the AFL-CIO Field
    Mobilization Department. &quot;This alliance will make our
    coalitions much stronger.&quot; </p>
    <p>Those strengthened ties are evident in the planning for
    the Oct. 12 national Latino and immigrant civil rights march.
    The AFL- CIO, its affiliated unions and constituency groups
    are major contributors. </p>

    <p><a name="UNITE"><strong>UNITE</strong></a><strong> scores
    two ways </strong></p>
    <p>UNITE will represent workers at FDR Services in Rome, Ga.,
    following a highly successful card-check campaign, and
    workers at Dixie Kids in Fayetteville, N.C., after a
    representation election. </p>
    <p>Ninety-five percent of the workers signed union cards at
    FDR, an industrial laundry that services hospitals. The
    workers will receive free health insurance, sick days and
    wage improvements in their first contract. </p>
    <p>Poor working conditions, low wages and unaffordable health
    insurance prompted Dixie Kids workers to vote 76-62 for
    UNITE. &quot;Dixie Kids workers have joined a growing trend
    among eastern North Carolina workers to organize in the
    traditionally anti-union part of the country,&quot; said
    Bruce Raynor, executive vice president and southern regional
    director of UNITE. </p>
    <p><a name="AFTRA "><strong>AFTRA puts $$ in cable </strong></a></p>
    <p>The Television and Radio Artists have earmarked $1.25
    million to organize in the cable entertainment and news
    programming industry. </p>
    <p>&quot;We understand the size and complexity of this
    project,&quot; said Bruce York, AFTRA's national executive
    director. &quot;The recent restructuring of AFTRA with the
    locals forming a closer relationship with the national makes
    financial commitments like this possible. Our governing
    boards and members have now provided the union with the
    resources to be successful in the new broadcast and
    entertainment world in which our members work.&quot; </p>
    <p>AFTRA already has several cable contracts in place,
    including The Nashville Network, Home Box Office and E!
    Entertainment. </p>
    <p><a name="TEAM"><strong>Triple-team works </strong></a></p>
    <p>The Machinists are seeing the benefits of their
    unification talks with the UAW and the Steelworkers as the
    three joined to beat back the anti-union campaign at
    Maremount Corp. in Loudon, Tenn. The workers voted 369-272
    for the union. </p>
    <p>&quot;Here are the early fruits from our unification talks
    with the UAW and the Steelworkers,&quot; said Gary Will, IAM
    organizing director. &quot;The UAW sent in four people to
    help in the campaign. They house- called, handbilled at the
    plant gates and went one-on-one with the workers.&quot; </p>
    <p>Two UAW members from Maremount's sister plant in Alabama
    also were involved in organizing the workers. </p>
    <p><a name="SEIU "><strong>Lucky seven for SEIU </strong></a></p>
    <p>Service Employees scored another series of victories at
    worksites across the country, including a 167-104 vote by
    nurses at Los Robles Hospital in California's San Fernando
    Valley. The win by Local 535 capped an organizing drive that
    was worker-led. The nurses paid union dues and built their
    organization for more than a year before filing for an
    election. </p>
    <p>Local 236 in Chicago won card-check recognition for 180
    ushers employed by Safety Service Systems. The ushers work at
    Soldiers Field, home of the Chicago Bears, Dyche Stadium,
    where the Northwestern Wildcats play, Rosemont Theatre and
    Rosemont Horizon. </p>
    <p>A unit of 18 sterile supply technicians at the University
    of Illinois voted to join SEIU Local 73, while Local 1 won an
    election for 13 janitors at Prairie Court, a Chicago Housing
    Authority property. </p>
    <p>Health care professionals at Peoples Community Care
    Residence (PCCR) in St. Paul, Minn., voted by a 2-1 margin
    for SEIU representation, and Local 1199IN organized a unit of
    37 city- employed emergency medical service workers in Gary,
    Ind. </p>
    <p>In Seattle, District 925 won an election for 27 patient
    account reps and other workers at Children's University
    Medical Group. </p>
    <p><a name="IBT"><strong>IBT wins new vote </strong></a></p>
    <p>After the National Labor Relations Board set aside their
    first election, employees of Fiber Sales and Development
    Corp. of Urbana, Ohio, voted by a 2-1 majority for Teamsters
    representation. </p>
    <p>The NLRB determined that before the November 1995
    election, the company had offered a reduction in
    employee-paid health care premiums in order to improperly
    influence the outcome of the election. </p>
    <p>Fiber Sales is a subsidiary of the St. Louis-based Ralston
    Purina Co. The workers manufacture powdered cellulose for use
    as an additive in other products. </p>
    <p><a name="VOL"><strong>Volunteers boost win </strong></a></p>
    <p>With the help of District 7 volunteers, the Steelworkers
    won a 91-51 representation election at MEG Corp. in Cambridge
    City, Ind. </p>
    <p>The volunteer organizers helped in house calls to more
    than half of the work force. In their discussions, the
    volunteers learned that the workers were seeking respect and
    dignity and better wages. About half of the MEG employees are
    women, and many complained of sexual discrimination. </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Meatcutters at a Super Kmart in Oakland, Calif., will be
    represented by the Food and Commercial Workers, which hailed
    the victory as a breakthrough against the anti-union company. </p>
    <p>&quot;It's a very important election because Kmart is
    nonunion all over America,&quot; said Charlie Fortenberry,
    UFCW Local 120 business agent. </p>
    <p>Although the Teamsters and UNITE have organized Kmart
    warehouse operations, the Oakland meatcutters were the first
    retail unit to vote union. UFCW Local 870 said the election
    will help in the drive to unionize retail clerks at the
    store. </p>
    <p>&quot;It's going to help propel us to a win,
    hopefully,&quot; said John Nunes, Local 870 business agent.
    &quot;The workers are real excited about it. We had a lot of
    confidence, too. It's going to help propel us.&quot; </p>
    <p>A large number of the 550 retail workers in the Oakland
    store have signed union cards. The union petitioned the
    National Labor Relations Board for an election in late July,
    but it was postponed at the request of the company attorneys. </p>
    <p>Kmart has reduced the work force at its Oakland store by
    half since it opened in November, a major reason that workers
    contacted the union. Workers also were harassed, accused of
    stealing and told to resign. </p>
    <p>Oakland is &quot;a strong labor town, and a lot of these
    workers came from union families, and they understand the
    importance of working under a union contract,&quot; said
    Nunes. </p>
    <p>The UFCW has joined with several community groups &quot;to
    bring to light a lot of this treatment at the store and the
    expectations of the workers,&quot; who were led to believe
    they had career opportunities. </p>
    <p>The local has filed several unfair labor practice charges
    with the NLRB claiming that Kmart fired workers for union
    activities, and spied on and threatened the workers. </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>You work hard all your life for an honest day's work for
    an honest day's pay and the promise of secure income when
    your working days are through. </p>
    <p>Edith Thomson knows that promise is easily broken by
    ruthless employers because &thorn; after giving 41 years of
    her life to Carter- Hawley-Hale Stores Inc. &thorn; her
    401(k) money vanished when the company went bankrupt. </p>
    <p>Her story is featured in radio and television ads the
    AFL-CIO ran during the August congressional recess. Thomson's
    company had invested its workers' 401(k) funds in its own
    stock, so that &quot;when they went broke, they had used my
    retirement money already, so there was nothing left,&quot;
    she said. </p>
    <p>She lost more than $87,000. </p>
    <p>The federation's ads pointed out that Congress has
    considered pension issues several times over the last two
    years, and urged legislators to tighten 401(k) rules and
    oppose allowing company CEOs to gain control of workers'
    &quot;excess&quot; pension funds. </p>
    <p>Grass-roots activists drove the point home with picnics,
    press conferences, leafleting, picketing and the like. </p>
    <p>In North Carolina, for example, a Teamsters member
    participated in a forum at a church along with an AARP member
    and representatives of Citizen Action. In Idaho, a press
    conference at the Boise Senior Center garnered coverage from
    all the local media, who then befuddled GOP Rep. Helen
    Chenoweth's staff looking for a response. </p>
    <p>Leafleters were out in full force in Gloucester, Mass.,
    while Thomson herself participated in an event in Eureka,
    Calif. </p>
    <p>The latest round of well-founded worker anxiety over
    pension security can be traced to the serious consideration
    given a proposal on Capitol Hill last year to allow employers
    to take out of their workers' pension funds that amount
    deemed an &quot;overage&quot; &thorn; and to spend this money
    at will. </p>
    <p>Legislation was passed in 1990 to clamp down on such free
    spending by corporate officers of workers' money &thorn; but
    GOP lawmakers saw a chance to unfund workers and give the
    funds to their Big Business friends. The so-called pension
    raid of 1995 was slipped into the GOP budget reconciliation
    bill, but it was vetoed by President Clinton. </p>
    <p>Anxiety over pension funds remains strong, giving rise to
    new pension protection legislation. One such proposal &thorn;
    H.R. 3688 &thorn; would have saved Edith Thomson's money. It
    would put employees' 401(k) funds further away from employers
    by subjecting 401(k) plans to the same rules that govern
    pensions, such as a 10 percent restriction on
    employer-related real estate and securities. </p>
    <p>Currently, some 20 percent of 401(k) retirement plans are
    managed by companies, meaning the money is in the hands of
    the employer, not the workers. A disturbing number of those
    businesses are straying into risky investments with workers'
    and retirees' funds. </p>
    <p>Secretary of Labor Robert B. Reich also took on the issue
    of pensions during the August recess, announcing tighter
    standards on deposits of 401(k) money into accounts.
    Employers currently have 90 days to deposit funds in workers'
    accounts; under new rules announced in early August,
    employers will have 15 business days after the end of the
    month to square their books. </p>
    <p>Reich said his department had found employers using the
    three- month grace period as a kind of automatic float, from
    which they would benefit from interest. The DoL estimates
    that will give American workers an extra $76 million in
    interest in 1997. </p>
    <p>The rule goes into affect in six months &thorn; later for
    union members with existing contracts. </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Politicians bent on privatizing government services have
    turned their attention to Social Security, but workers and
    their unions will have none of it. </p>
    <p>Calling Social Security &quot;perhaps the federal
    government's most successful social policy achievement,&quot;
    the AFL-CIO Executive Council vowed to fight efforts to
    abandon the program for individual savings accounts. </p>
    <p>The 61-year-old program currently provides some 43 million
    Americans with an average yearly benefit of $7,700 under the
    old- age, survivors and disability social insurance programs
    that make up Social Security &thorn; with enough left over
    for a Trust Fund reserve of nearly $500 billion. </p>
    <p>Periodic adjustments have been required to keep up the
    benefits funding &thorn; higher payroll taxes and retirement
    ages &thorn; and Social Security currently is able to meet
    its obligations well into the next century. But rumblings
    over its longer-term viability have opened the door to the
    threat of privatization. </p>
    <p>Several measures pending in Congress, including one by
    Sens. Alan Simpson (R-Wyo.) and Bob Kerrey (D-Neb.), would
    replace Social Security with individual, private savings
    accounts that would rely in some fashion on the stock market
    to generate retirement income. </p>
    <p>&quot;The AFL-CIO rejects all attempts to dismantle the
    Social Security system and to exaggerate the extent of its
    long-term financing problems,&quot; the council declared at
    its summer meeting in Chicago, assailing &quot;the
    disinformation campaign currently being waged by Wall Street
    interests&quot; seeking a share of privately run accounts
    functioning in place of Social Security. </p>
    <p>The federation called on all unions to join with allied
    groups &quot;in a coordinated campaign to educate Americans
    on the true value of Social Security and to discredit the
    false notion that private retirement accounts could match
    Social Security benefits.&quot; </p>
    <p>The AFL-CIO pointed out that the Social Security system's
    benefit structure returns a higher share of low-paid workers'
    earnings in the form of benefits, but also pays higher
    benefits to higher contributors. </p>
    <p>Social Security's costs &quot;are less than 0.7 percent of
    annual benefits,&quot; the federation noted, &quot;compared
    with administrative costs at private insurance companies that
    are, on average, 40 percent higher.&quot; </p>
    <p>Unions were urged to include regular communication on
    Social Security in their publications, use educational
    material being developed by allied organizations and to
    encourage local leaders and activists to speak out publicly. </p>
    <p>With $500 billion in the trust fund, Social Security is
    not in danger yet. In developing a prudent response to the
    trust fund's long-term financing needs, &quot;the AFL-CIO
    will work to ensure that all Americans will be able to
    continue to rely upon Social Security.&quot; &#160;</p>

    <p align="center"><font size="4">OSHA targets worker safety
    at nursing homes <br>
    </font>by </p>
    <p align="center">Colleen M. O'Neill </p>
    <p>Nursing home workers will gain greater safety provided a
    recently announced safety and health initiative does the job. </p>
    <p>Secretary of Labor Robert B. Reich acted Aug. 8 in the
    face of mounting injuries and illnesses among workers at
    these facilities. </p>
    <p>Under the initiative, the Occupational Safety and Health
    Administration will conduct free, comprehensive seminars
    beginning this fall in Pennsylvania, New York, Missouri,
    Ohio, Illinois, Florida and Massachusetts, with the goal of
    helping employers develop safety and health programs,
    identify and prevent injuries and illnesses related to blood
    borne pathogens, tuberculosis and handling of residents, as
    well as prevent workplace violence. </p>
    <p>Those seven states all have more than 500 nursing home
    facilities. </p>
    <p>Nursing home workers suffered more than 221,000 nonfatal
    injuries in 1994 &thorn; making the industry more dangerous
    than construction, mining, electrical work and automobile
    repair, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported. </p>
    <p>The number of lost workdays per 100 full-time nursing home
    workers increased from 98.2 in 1983 to 186.9 in 1993,
    according to the Service Employees. </p>
    <p>The goal of the new program, Labor officials say, is to
    disseminate information, give employers a chance to make
    changes, gather workers' compensation data and then focus on
    those companies with the highest rates of injury. The
    ultimate focus is training for prevention of injuries and
    illnesses, officials said. </p>
    <p>&quot;Nursing home work is one of the most dangerous jobs
    in America,&quot; SEIU President Andrew L. Stern said.
    &quot;Nearly one in five nursing home workers will be injured
    on the job this year. This initiative is a giant step forward
    in the fight to curb those injuries so that workers can
    safely provide the best possible care for their elderly
    patients.&quot; </p>
    <p>SEIU and the American Association of Homes and Services
    for the Aging are to assist OSHA in the outreach effort. SEIU
    issued a report in 1995 on nursing home safety for employees
    titled &quot;Caring Till It Hurts.&quot; </p>

    for Justice&quot; organized by religious leaders in support
    of 450 striking Laborers at Case Farms in Morganton, N.C. </p>
    <p>The workers walked out of the poultry processing plant in
    mid- August after the company refused to recognize or bargain
    with LIUNA. In addition, two of the strikers &thorn; Luis
    Alberto Gonzalez and Roberto Mendoza &thorn; began a hunger
    strike, to &quot;Fast and Pray for Justice,&quot; outside of
    the plant. </p>
    <p>The workers voted for the union last year after
    documenting numerous incidents of abuse and exploitation by
    plant managers. Since the election, the company has fired 38
    workers for union activity. </p>
    <p>The National Labor Relations Board overruled Case Farms'
    objections and ordered the company to bargain with the
    workers. </p>
    <p>&quot;These workers are striving to provide decent lives
    for themselves and their families through hard work and
    personal sacrifice,&quot; said LIUNA President Arthur A.
    Coia. &quot;They, like so many of our ancestors, came to this
    country in search of liberty and justice. The management at
    Case Farms has done everything in their power to keep these
    workers from achieving these noble ends.&quot; </p>
    <p>In July, almost one-third of the workers walked out to
    protest the illegal firing of one worker dumped when he
    protested the increased speed of the chicken carcass
    production line. The worker was rehired and the strikers
    returned to work. </p>
    <p>The National Interfaith Committee for Worker Justice
    reported terrible conditions after a late-April fact-finding
    visit to Case Farms. &quot;We work eight-hour shifts with
    only one bathroom break,&quot; said Francisco Ramirez.
    &quot;My co-worker was forced to continue working even when
    his wrist swelled up to the size of a grapefruit because of
    repetitive stress/carpal tunnel syndrome,&quot; he said. </p>
    <p>&quot;I hunger for justice,&quot; said Gonzalez. &quot;I
    am prepared to starve myself until Case Farms will sit down
    and bargain with us. I will not let the company treat us with
    such disrespect and injustice.&quot; </p>
    <p>Setting the stage for the Aug. 17 march, hundreds of New
    York City building trades workers held a rally on Wall Street
    in front of the Bank of New York &thorn; Case Farms' primary
    commercial lender &thorn; urging the bank to stop financing
    the company's abusive and illegal practices. </p>

    <p align="center"><font size="4">Tighter rules sought to
    prevent workplace violence at night <br>
    </font>by </p>
    <p align="center">Sharolyn A. Rosier </p>
    <p>While commending the Occupational Safety and Health
    Administration for proposing guidelines for late-night
    workplace violence prevention programs, unions are urging
    that the guidelines be broadened. </p>
    <p>&quot;There is no definition of what constitutes
    night,&quot; the Inter- Union Workplace Physical Violence
    Coalition wrote, expressing concern that only those stores
    open 24 hours may implement preventive programs, while those
    open after dark, even until 11 p.m., will not consider
    themselves night establishments. </p>
    <p>In another comment, Food and Commercial Workers Local 770
    detailed several incidents that occurred during morning hours
    in retail supermarkets. The union recommended that the title
    be changed to &quot;guidelines for the retail industry, with
    a special emphasis on night retail establishments.&quot; </p>
    <p>The goal of the guidelines is to eliminate or reduce
    conditions that raise retail workers' chances of death or
    injury. The guidelines are to provide employers with specific
    options that could be taken to protect workers employed after
    dark. </p>
    <p>The numbers substantiate the urgency. About 1 million
    workers are assaulted and more than 1,000 workers are
    murdered annually as a result of workplace violence,
    according to a report released last month by the National
    Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. </p>
    <p>NIOSH data indicate that homicide is the second-leading
    cause of occupational death, surpassed only by motor
    vehicle-related deaths. Workplace homicides increased in the
    1990s after decreasing significantly in the 1980s, the report
    said. </p>
    <p>The greatest number of deaths during the period 1980-1992
    occurred in the retail industry, followed by public
    administration. </p>
    <p>Unions are concerned about the &quot;voluntary&quot;
    nature of the guidelines, urging the agency to make them
    mandatory. </p>
    <p>Other suggestions from the unions included greater worker
    involvement, hazard prevention, training and telephone
    access. Comments submitted by the AFL-CIO request that
    telephone access for workers be included among the
    recommended engineering controls. </p>
    <p>The deadline for comments has been extended to Sept. 30. </p>

    <p align="center"><font size="4">Economics education puts
    workers in equation <br>
    </font>by </p>
    <p align="center">David Kameras </p>
    <p>The AFL-CIO is mounting an unprecedented economics
    education program for union members. </p>
    <p>The program is being field-tested as a basic part of the
    federation's massive member mobilization campaign this
    election year, and it will become an essential part of union
    educational programs in the years to come. </p>
    <p>&quot;This is a significant step in labor education as a
    whole,&quot; said Robert Pleasure, President John J.
    Sweeney's assistant for education, at the Executive Council
    meeting in Chicago. &quot;For the labor movement to achieve
    its organizing, political, legislative and collective
    bargaining goals, we need to deepen members' understanding of
    the economic context of their union and community
    activity.&quot; </p>
    <p>He described the initial phase in which the program, as a
    corollary to Labor '96, is educating members in political
    campaigns and educating candidates about the needs and
    challenges facing working Americans. </p>
    <p>&quot;But I think this program goes far beyond the
    political process in the months ahead,&quot; Pleasure said.
    &quot;It proposes an economic education program that's
    integrated with organizing and bargaining, job training,
    apprenticeship training and worker counseling.&quot; </p>
    <p>The program is being developed with input from the
    education and research departments of all the affiliated
    unions. It will be a primary emphasis of the AFL-CIO
    Education Department and its new director, Bill Fletcher, a
    former education and field staff director at the Service
    Employees who was introduced to the council by Sweeney. </p>
    <p>&quot;We have a great opportunity,&quot; Fletcher told the
    council. &quot;We need to change things around dramatically
    in the way workers view unions and the way that unions
    influence policy. There is a certain level of urgency.&quot; </p>
    <p>The council also heard from Jeff Faux, president of the
    Economic Policy Institute, on the need to extend the workers'
    perspective onto the national scene. </p>
    <p>&quot;We need to make the economic case so that more
    people understand the importance of unions,&quot; Faux said,
    noting the prevailing myth that high wages are bad for the
    country. &quot;What we need to do is create the kind of
    movement that addresses and attacks that story,&quot; he
    said. &quot;Unless we do that, the chance of getting labor
    law reform is very low.&quot; </p>
    <p>Faux spoke about creating an army of people who understand
    the key economic facts, such as the need to create a strong
    demand for labor. &quot;There should be a hunger to
    understand what the hell is going on, to understand it in the
    context of coming in, turning on the TV and hearing only
    stock market news, not paycheck news. We need to make people
    understand there is something in this for them.&quot; </p>
    <p>To amplify labor's message, Faux talked of creating an
    &quot;echo chamber,&quot; in which the workers' perspective
    is reinforced through different media. &quot;When Gingrich
    speaks, Limbaugh echoes, and then letters to the editors with
    the same arguments come in,&quot; he said. &quot;We need to
    create our own echo chamber.&quot; </p>
    <p>Phase 1 of the economic education plan has the federation
    developing and distributing economic education curricula and
    materials to apprenticeship programs, joint labor-management
    education and training programs, counselors for displaced
    workers and community teach-ins. These activities are
    coordinated with affiliated unions, training programs,
    university-based labor centers and community groups. </p>
    <p>After the November election, the AFL-CIO will move forward
    with a multiyear, multilevel program stressing the need for
    collective action through stronger, growing unions to achieve
    a restructured economy that serves working families better.
    It is hoped the first programs of Phase 2 will be
    field-tested in early 1997. </p>
    <p>The outline also envisions a permanent national network of
    trained labor educators and economists, regular follow-up
    with program participants, debriefings to culminate in a
    seminar and workshop for union leaders, a permanent
    clearinghouse on economics education and systematic,
    comprehensive and continuing evaluations. </p>
    <p>&quot;This is a long-term process that will require
    investment and leadership to signal to the rank and file that
    this is important,&quot; Faux said. </p>

    <p align="center"><font size="4">Corporate affairs helps
    unions with employers <br>
    </font>by </p>
    <p align="center">James B. Parks </p>
    <p>Making good on the promise to revamp and revitalize the
    ability of unions to mount successful strategic campaigns for
    organizing and collective bargaining, the AFL-CIO began
    assembling the team that will provide direct help to unions
    in their dealings with employers. </p>
    <p>President John J. Sweeney drew on some of the top talents
    in the labor movement to fill key roles in the new Corporate
    Affairs Department, which will provide information and
    analysis for corporate campaigns, and the Field Mobilization
    Department, which will coordinate field activities. </p>
    <p>Ron Blackwell, UNITE's chief economist, will become
    director of corporate affairs. The department will include
    three divisions &thorn; Strategic Research, headed by David
    Chu, former Service Employees research director; Employee
    Ownership and Governance, headed by William Patterson, who
    has directed shareholder campaigns for the Teamsters; and
    Workplace Democracy, with Nancy Mills, who previously worked
    on issues of the changing workplace at SEIU, serving as
    acting director. </p>
    <p>Dick Leonard, corporate campaign director for the Oil,
    Chemical and Atomic Workers, will direct strategic campaigns
    as an assistant director in the Department of Field
    Mobilization. </p>
    <p>&quot;This is an impressive array of talent to focus on
    the critical issues facing America's working families,&quot;
    Sweeney said. &quot;It continues the exciting headway we have
    already begun with the creation and revamping of our
    activities in organizing, government affairs, public affairs,
    working women's issues, field mobilization and legal
    services.&quot; </p>
    <p>The appointments, coupled with the reorganization of the
    various field staffs, will &quot;provide affiliates with the
    best possible talent&quot; for the difficult work of
    strategic campaigns, Sweeney said. </p>
    <p>The recent rail settlement shows how effective coordinated
    actions can be, several union presidents said. </p>
    <p>The active support given by Sweeney and
    Secretary-Treasurer Richard L. Trumka, including Sweeney's
    appearance before the rail emergency board, the first-ever by
    an AFL-CIO president, helped turn the tide in favor of rail
    workers, said Transportation Communications Union President
    Robert A. Scardelletti. </p>
    <p>&quot;We needed the AFL-CIO and they were there to help.
    In the end, we reached an agreement that far exceeded what
    the industry dreamed they would be paying and anything we
    thought we could achieve,&quot; he said. </p>
    <p>&quot;The railroads were going through Congress to force a
    settlement,&quot; Maintenance of Way Employees President Mac
    Fleming said. &quot;But we politicized the process by
    bringing the AFL-CIO into it. We had more votes than they
    did. It meant a lot in the end: substantial job security,
    skill differential, enhanced work rules.&quot; </p>
    <p>The campaign staff will have its hands full as soon as it
    hits the ground. Trumka, who heads the Strategic Approaches
    Committee, told the Executive Council his panel has been
    extremely busy. </p>
    <p>Coming off victories in the rail talks and in the
    Paperworkers' strike against Trailmobile, the committee has
    intensified its efforts in other ongoing disputes. </p>
    <p>In the Detroit newspaper strike, Sweeney told strikers
    last month that the federation would &quot;raise the
    visibility (of the strike) and bring this to a successful
    conclusion.&quot; </p>
    <p>Both sides have agreed to resume negotiations at the
    request of the mayor, Trumka said. But the newspaper owners,
    Gannett and Knight-Ridder, have refused to negotiate around
    the clock, opting instead for only two dates so far. </p>
    <p>The strike, which has gone on for 13 months, &quot;is
    being sustained against incredible odds,&quot; but solidarity
    is high, Trumka said. Among the strongest supporters has been
    the UAW, which recently presented $150 checks to each of the
    nearly 2,000 strikers for the fourth time since the strike
    began. The federation also has assigned two additional staff,
    George Curtin and Gary Horton, bringing to six the number of
    personnel assigned to aid the strikers. </p>
    <p>The strikers were disappointed that Gannett board member
    and former First Lady Rosalynn Carter, responding to a
    letter, would not even agree to meet with them to discuss
    their concerns. &quot;If Sadat and Begin had taken this
    approach, there never would have been a Carter Center,&quot;
    Trumka said, referring to the historic talks between the
    Egyptian president and Israeli prime minister that led to a
    peace accord brokered by then-President Jimmy Carter. </p>
    <p>Some 2,000 employees of the Detroit News and Free Press
    have been on strike since July 13, 1995, after negotiations
    failed to produce a new agreement. Management and imported
    scabs from other papers are producing the newspapers. </p>
    <p>The key issue is how to get rid of the scabs,
    Communications Workers President Morton Bahr said. The CWA
    and The Newspaper Guild-CWA are two of the striking unions,
    along with IBT and Graphic Communications. </p>
    <p>GCIU President James J. Norton announced that retail giant
    Dayton Hudson has pulled out of the Detroit scab newspapers
    and will advertise in the suburban papers. It also has cut
    its Christmas budget with the papers by $20 million, he said. </p>
    <p>The strike at the Frontier Hotel in Las Vegas is in its
    fifth year and is still going strong &thorn; not one striker
    has crossed the picket line, Trumka reported. As a result,
    the hotel is losing out on the boom on the Strip, which is
    based on a &quot;labor-management partnership that the
    Frontier is not participating in,&quot; he said. </p>

    <p align="center"><font size="4">International focus shifts
    to organizing and solidarity <br>
    </font>by </p>
    <p align="center">James B. Parks </p>
    <p>The AFL-CIO is forging ahead with an activist
    international affairs program focused on organizing,
    educating members and building a strong global union
    movement. </p>
    <p>The federation's International Affairs Committee, chaired
    by Machinists President George J. Kourpias, presented
    preliminary recommendations to the Executive Council for a
    restructuring of the federation's international activities
    &quot;to supplement the overall goals of the affiliates and
    the federation to organize and strengthen bargaining at home
    and abroad.&quot; </p>
    <p>The recommendations reflect the activist approach
    described by AFL-CIO President John J. Sweeney at the World
    Congress of the International Confederation of Free Trade
    Unions in June. &quot;We must do more than talk to each
    other, pass fine resolutions and go home,&quot; Sweeney said.
    &quot;We must create clear and measurable goals and design
    campaigns to accomplish them.&quot; </p>
    <p>&quot;Our labor movements need to engage in a seamless
    garment of activism,&quot; Sweeney told the Trade Union
    Congress in London. &quot;We need to organize members in
    every occupation and every industry. That is the only way we
    can gain the economic power to win better wages and benefits
    at the bargaining table. That is the only way that we can
    gain the political power to enact better laws to protect
    working people's rights to organize unions and bargain with
    their employers.&quot; </p>
    <p>Sweeney announced at the council meeting that he has
    appointed Barbara Shailor, IAM's international affairs
    director, to lead the refocused international affairs
    program. She replaces Charles Gray, who will become Sweeney's
    assistant for international relations, particularly on the
    International Labor Organization, where Gray has played a
    prominent role for many years. </p>
    <p>&quot;The recommendations are consistent with other
    changes at the AFL-CIO &thorn; taking an activist approach to
    issues, much as the Organizing and Field Mobilization
    departments are doing,&quot; Shailor said. </p>
    <p>The department also will take an activist approach to
    educating union members on the international issues and how
    they affect American workers, Shailor said. She cited IAM's
    strikes at Boeing and McDonnell Douglas, both over the issue
    of outsourcing to foreign companies, as examples of the
    impact of global competition. </p>
    <p>&quot;To succeed in our struggle, union members in every
    country must develop a better understanding of how global
    forces impact their national governments, their industries,
    their unions and their place of work,&quot; Kourpias told the
    council. </p>
    <p>As part of the restructuring, the four federation
    international institutes will be combined into the American
    Center for International Labor Solidarity (ACILS) by the end
    of the year. </p>
    <p>Jim Baker, executive assistant to former President Lane
    Kirkland, is overseeing the integration of the institutes. </p>
    <p>The committee recommended that ACILS be funded without
    government supervision, foreign or domestic. Currently, much
    of the money that funds the institutes comes from the U.S.
    Agency for International Development and the National
    Endowment for Democracy. </p>
    <p>Funds for both agencies have been cut significantly by
    Congress. The report also called for focusing the efforts of
    the institutes on the organization and development of strong
    and independent trade unions at home and abroad. </p>
    <p>In addition, the report called for the IAD to cooperate
    and coordinate with affiliates and the Corporate Affairs,
    Public Policy and Field Mobilization departments by
    strengthening U.S. participation in the ICFTU, international
    trade secretariats and expanding affiliation with Asian
    organizations. It also called for a strategic political
    campaign to ratify ILO conventions on the right to organize
    and bargain collectively. </p>

    <p align="center">Colleen M. O'Neill </p>
    <p><a name="FEDS"><strong>State feds to capture fees </strong></a></p>
    <p>The Executive Council adopted a statement authorizing a
    disbursement schedule to state federations of the monies
    generated by the 1-cent penalty per capita program on state
    federation affiliation. </p>
    <p>The sliding scale disbursement calls for the largest
    allocations to go to small- and medium-sized state
    federations. Also, up to 10 percent of the funds may be
    disbursed as grants of no more than $5,000 for such needs as
    affiliation initiatives, technological enhancements or
    grass-roots development. </p>
    <p>The council also expanded AFL-CIO authority over all
    &quot;election protests&quot; in state and local central
    bodies and shifted the first appeal by a central body on
    matters regarding disciplinary action from the council to the
    Appeals Committee. </p>
    <p>In addition, protest of an officer&thorn;s election may be
    made to the AFL-CIO president within 30 days of exhaustion of
    any applicable procedures provided by the constitution or
    bylaws of the state or local central body. </p>
    <p><a name="DISPUTE"><strong>Dispute procedures changed </strong></a></p>
    <p>The council approved a series of changes in the articles
    of the AFL-CIO constitution that deal with union dispute
    settlement. </p>
    <p>A set of new procedures for handling complaints under
    Article XX were issued, including a requirement that unions
    contact each other before taking the complaint to the
    federation. </p>
    <p>The council also amended Article XX to allow independent
    unions to affiliate with an AFL-CIO affiliate even if another
    union has filed a petition with a labor board to represent
    the workers in that unit. That amendment has been approved
    each year since 1992 on a trial basis. </p>
    <p>In addition, the Article XX Review Committee was renamed
    the Committee on Article XX and Article XXI Review. </p>
    <p><a name="ENGLISH"><strong>Not officially English </strong></a></p>
    <p>English is already our &quot;common&quot; language, the
    council declared, and therefore does not have to be our
    official language, as espoused in a legislative proposal,
    H.R. 123. </p>
    <p>The council noted that the measure would
    &quot;disenfranchise, divide and disconnect millions of
    Americans from their government,&quot; and urged
    &quot;expanding public funding for adult education programs
    and English as a second language because isolating immigrants
    and American-born citizens who are not fluent in English
    leads to exploitation and discrimination.&quot; </p>
    <p><a name="BURN"><strong>Church burnings decried </strong></a></p>
    <p>The outbreak of burnings, bombings and vandalism recently
    visited on American churches was condemned by the AFL-CIO,
    which vowed to mobilize against the forces of intolerance and
    bigotry. </p>
    <p>&quot;We will work with groups from different faiths and
    with our allies in civil and human rights organizations to
    help open an honest dialogue within the communities where
    these crimes have occurred,&quot; the council said in a
    statement, &quot;and we will work to help rebuild and restore
    the houses of worship that have been vandalized by these hate
    criminals.&quot; </p>
    <p><a name="BOYCOTT"><strong>New boycott strategy </strong></a></p>
    <p>To strengthen the AFL-CIO boycott endorsement policy, the
    federation will list companies only for a period of up to one
    calendar year, at which time it would expire automatically. </p>
    <p>Before a company is listed, the national officers of the
    union seeking the boycott must meet with AFL-CIO executive
    officers or staff to discuss a strategic plan and timetable
    for the boycott. </p>
    <p><a name="STERN"><strong>Stern replaces Cordtz </strong></a></p>
    <p>The council praised retiring Vice President Richard W.
    Cordtz, who was replaced on the council by the new president
    of the Service Employees, Andy Stern. </p>
    <p>Cordtz had been a member of the council since October
    1995, when he was elected to the SEIU presidency, succeeding
    John J. Sweeney. </p>
    <p>&quot;His commitment to organizing over his 50 years of
    service to working people is a standard we hold forth to
    union activists and leaders of generations to come,&quot; the
    council said in a statement. </p>

    <p align="center"><font size="4">Strike spotlights
    disServiceMaster <br>
    Private veterans' home shafts workers, taxpayers </font><br>
    by </p>
    <p align="center">Colleen M. O'Neill </p>
    <p>Workers at the state veterans' home in Anna, Ill., struck
    Aug. 10 after a yearlong struggle under the AFSCME banner for
    a first contract with ServiceMaster. </p>
    <p>The ServiceMaster home is one of four veterans' homes in
    Illinois financed by the state. Unionized workers at the
    three state-operated homes in LaSalle, Manteno and Quincy
    have health insurance, pensions and earn $9.60 an hour, while
    certified nursing assistants at the privately run Anna
    facility earn only $4.67 an hour with no health insurance or
    pensions and very minimal benefits. </p>
    <p>According to AFSCME, ServiceMaster's contract with the
    state is worth nearly $2 million; yet, the company spends
    less than half of the employment costs at the other
    facilities. Given that their overall costs are only 12
    percent to 28 percent less than at the state-operated homes,
    the union concludes that &quot;ServiceMaster is making big
    profits from the veterans' home, and those profits are coming
    at the expense of the veterans, the employees and the entire
    Anna community.&quot; </p>
    <p>The federation took up the cause of the workers before the
    strike began with a statement in support of their efforts. </p>
    <p>&quot;The AFL-CIO Executive Council condemns the refusal
    of ServiceMaster to bargain in good faith with the workers at
    the Anna veterans' home. We call on the State of Illinois to
    take steps immediately to bring about a fair settlement with
    these workers, and if ServiceMaster refuses to bargain, to
    cancel its contract with the company.&quot; </p>
    <p>Several days into the strike, family members of residents
    had reported that some replacement workers were not showing
    up &thorn; and those that did report to work lacked
    qualifications and necessary skills and were administering
    poor care. </p>
    <p>Specifically, clinical tests were done late or not at all,
    meals arrived late and cold, residents had to tell the
    replacement workers how to perform lifts properly and
    residents without family nearby were not having their
    appearances tended to. </p>
    <p>Those allegations led former GOP State Senator Ralph Dunn
    to urge Gov. Jim Edgar to terminate ServiceMaster's contract. </p>
    <p>He said the treatment of the residents by the unqualified
    replacement workers had made the home &quot;a symbol, not of
    our common commitment to these veterans, but of the State of
    Illinois' indifference to their physical and mental
    well-being.&quot; </p>
    <p>No new bargaining sessions were set until after Labor Day. </p>

    <p align="center"><font size="4">Unions fight Bell
    Atlantic-NYNEX hookup <br>
    </font>by </p>
    <p align="center">Colleen M. O'Neill </p>
    <p>Breaking up was hard to do, Ma Bell's offspring say. Now
    the regional operating companies are seeking new ways to come
    together. </p>
    <p>For telephone customers from Boston to Washington, that
    means a planned merger of NYNEX and Bell Atlantic. And for
    Electrical Workers and Communications Workers employed by the
    two companies, that means trouble. </p>
    <p>&quot;We have seen a preview, in the mobile phone
    operation, of what we'll see when they merge,&quot; said CWA
    spokesman Jeffrey Miller. &quot;They turned into a bunch of
    union busters.&quot; </p>
    <p>The AFL-CIO joined its two affiliates in fighting the
    merger with a statement of support issued at the Executive
    Council meeting in Chicago. </p>
    <p>&quot;It is clear that Bell Atlantic's buyout of NYNEX
    would take us in the opposite direction (from the goal of the
    1996 Telecommunications Act): a bigger telecom monopoly with
    even less incentive to reverse the companies' existing
    pattern of declining service standards, ever-higher rates and
    the destruction of good jobs,&quot; the council said. </p>
    <p>The original merger plans were changed so as to sidestep
    scrutiny, CWA President Morton Bahr asserted, noting that
    &quot;in every action it takes, this company shows its
    arrogance and disregard for workers, from the six-month fight
    for a new contract last year to the end run it's trying to
    make around public oversight of the proposed merger.&quot; </p>
    <p>State regulators in the New England and mid-Atlantic
    states must approve the merger; the unions have vowed to
    fight it there and in the courts. </p>
    <p>IBEW President John J. Barry said the merging of the
    cellular operations last year gave the firms the chance to
    show how they would deal with their work force. However, Bell
    Atlantic threw out the negotiated union contracts and so far
    has refused to abide by a National Labor Relations Board
    determination that its action was illegal. </p>
    <p>&quot;Bell Atlantic continues to show its contempt for
    workers, through its refusal to acknowledge the contracts
    fairly negotiated at the mobile operation; by issuing a
    union-busting guide to supervisors; and by denying workers
    transfer rights into new jobs,&quot; Barry said. </p>
    <p>The council said &quot;both companies have allowed service
    standards to deteriorate, while steadily downsizing their
    work forces and funneling these savings into sideline
    business ventures instead of maintaining or improving their
    telecom systems.&quot; It pledged full support to the unions
    in seeking to block the alliance, and called on &quot;all
    federal and state agencies charged with reviewing the
    proposed deal to withhold approval.&quot; </p>
    <p>Bell Atlantic-NYNEX Mobile remains on the AFL-CIO's
    national boycott list. </p>

    <p>&#160;</p>
    <p><a name="UPS"><strong>UPS can't dodge NLRB </strong></a></p>
    <p>Ruling in favor of the Teamsters, a federal appeals court
    decided that United Parcel Service Inc. is subject to the
    National Labor Relations Act, as it has been for the last 47
    years. </p>
    <p>The company had sought to bring itself under the Railway
    Labor Act, which covers airlines and railroads, and the
    National Mediation Board, which administers that law, instead
    of the NLRA and the National Labor Relations Board. </p>
    <p>The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit ruled that
    UPS, with 300,000 employees, mainly performs ground
    transportation for small packages. Its subsidiary, United
    Parcel Service Co., with 3,000 employees, was created in 1988
    to deliver air freight and is subject to the RLA. </p>
    <p>The case, UPS Inc. vs. NLRB, arose in 1993 when the
    company was charged with violating labor laws by the IBT.
    While the case was before the NLRB, the company requested the
    board to ask the NMB whether it should be covered by the
    railway act. After an administrative law judge ruled in UPS'
    favor, the NLRB reversed the decision. </p>
    <p><a name="COKE"><strong>Coke contract upheld </strong></a></p>
    <p>A federal appeals court upheld the primacy of the
    collective bargaining contract over work rules and ordered a
    Coca-Cola employee reinstated after he was fired for being
    late to work too often. </p>
    <p>An arbitrator had decided in favor of the employee in the
    case, Midwest Coca-Cola vs. Teamsters Local 792. Coca-Cola
    argued that its work rules on tardiness superseded the
    collective bargaining agreement, but the U.S. Circuit Court
    of Appeals for the 8th Circuit rejected the argument,
    overruled a lower court and upheld the arbitrator's decision. </p>
    <p>Coca-Cola work rules require discharge for workers who are
    late four times in a 12-month period without calling in 30
    minutes before the shift begins. But the contract prohibits
    the firing of a senior employee without &quot;just
    cause,&quot; and calls for an arbitrator to determine if such
    cause existed and to order reinstatement if necessary. </p>
    <p>&quot;The fact that we, the district court, or Coca-Cola
    may disagree with the arbitrator's arguable interpretation of
    the agreement is of no consequence, because Coca-Cola and the
    union bargained for the arbitrator's interpretation,&quot;
    the court wrote. </p>
    <p><a name="HOSPITAL"><strong>Hospital injunction denied </strong></a></p>
    <p>A federal judge has denied the National Labor Relations
    Board's request for an injunction to force a Kentucky medical
    center to bargain with a union over a restructuring of
    nurses' positions and duties. </p>
    <p>U.S. District Judge John G. Heyburn of western Kentucky
    ruled that the NLRB failed to show that an injunction was
    justified and it would be too burdensome to renegotiate the
    restructuring, which was completed in February. </p>
    <p>The case, Ahearn vs. Audubon Regional Medical Center,
    began when Audubon in 1995 unilaterally changed the staffing
    levels for nurses and redesigned the physical layout without
    consulting the union. No nurses were laid off or terminated
    because of the changes. </p>
    <p>The Nurses Professional Organization, an affiliate of
    AFSCME, filed unfair labor practice charges in 1994 against
    Audubon, an acute care facility with 2,000 employees,
    including 642 registered nurses. The union claimed the
    facility threatened employees during a 1994 representation
    election, which it lost. The restructuring occurred during
    hearings on the first set of ULP charges. </p>
    <p><a name="IAM"><strong>IAM charges Boeing </strong></a></p>
    <p>The Machinists filed unfair labor practice charges with
    the National Labor Relations Board charging Boeing is
    illegally trying to entice workers out of union jobs into a
    new, nonunion classification. </p>
    <p>The union, which represents some 36,000 Boeing workers,
    claimed the company intends to move hundreds of jobs
    classified as expediters from the bargaining unit. Boeing
    recently announced that 1,100 union members who are
    classified as expediters, who track materials and parts
    through the production process, would be &quot;invited to
    move&quot; into a new unrepresented salaried position of
    &quot;material planner.&quot; </p>
    <p>The union also charged that the company has unlawfully
    threatened union members if they and/or the union refused to
    accept a new work schedule. </p>

    <p align="center"><font size="4">Shipyard strikers in tough
    fight <br>
    NASSCO takes tax funds, seeks to bust unions <br>
    </font>by </p>
    <p align="center">David Kameras </p>
    <p>San Diego, Calif. </p>
    <p>Some 1,800 striking workers at San Diego's National
    Shipbuilding Co. shipyard are hanging tough against
    union-busting tactics of their employer after more than 3,000
    walked out July 17. </p>
    <p>The strikers were buoyed by separate visits from AFL-CIO
    President John J. Sweeney and Secretary-Treasurer Richard L.
    Trumka, who promised to rally the labor movement on their
    behalf. </p>
    <p>The NASSCO shipyard performs contract work for the U.S.
    Navy, which means taxpayers are subsidizing the company's
    anti-union stance. The company's chief executive enjoys fat
    raises each year while ignoring federal wage requirements for
    Navy contracts. The workers have not had a raise in four
    years. </p>
    <p>In 1992, workers struck for a month, returning when
    management agreed to bargain in good faith. But instead of a
    contract, they got suspension of the dues check-off,
    interference with shop stewards in the performance of their
    duties and refusal to discuss union security at the
    bargaining table. </p>
    <p>The unions offered to hold an independently supervised
    election to show rank-and-file support for a union security
    clause, but the company refused. </p>
    <p>Sweeney said the strike in San Diego is symptomatic of the
    nation's economic problems. Pointing to the Republican
    convention across town, he warned that workers will insist
    that &quot;America Needs A Raise.&quot; </p>
    <p>&quot;I hope the Republicans can hear us over at the San
    Diego Convention Center and at some of the plush parties
    going on around us,&quot; he said. &quot;I hope the Perot
    delegates can hear us up in Long Beach and that the Democrats
    can hear us next week, because they will most certainly hear
    us on Nov. 5. We will be heard.&quot; </p>
    <p>Trumka criticized Republican presidential candidate Bob
    Dole and his embrace of the core beliefs of supply-side
    Reaganomics, symbolized strongly by his selection of Jack
    Kemp as his running mate. &quot;George Bush called
    supply-side `voodoo economics.' Well, now union members know
    it's doo-doo economics,&quot; he said. </p>
    <p>&quot;The 1980s were a disaster for working people in this
    country, and just about everything that was wrong with the
    1980s went by the name of supply-side economics,&quot; he
    said. &quot;We had a dose of supply- side in the 1980s, and
    it created the largest deficit in history and the widest gap
    between rich and poor. Working people may have been born at
    night, but we weren't born last night.&quot; </p>
    <p>The AFL-CIO is helping to establish a striker relief fund
    that will help striking workers make ends meet and continue
    their struggle against the shipyard's management. Monies go
    into a central fund administered by the San Diego-Imperial
    Counties Labor Council, to which workers may apply for
    assistance. </p>
    <p>The NASSCO strikers belong to the Ironworkers, Machinists,
    Electrical Workers, Carpenters, Painters, Operating Engineers
    and Teamsters. Donations to help them and their families may
    be sent to: Solidarity Fund for NASSCO Workers, c/o San
    Diego-Imperial Counties AFL-CIO, 4265 Fairmount Ave., Suite
    110, San Diego, Calif. 92105. </p>

    <p align="center"><font size="4">ULLICO invests in new ships,
    jobs <br>
    </font>by </p>
    <p align="center">David Kameras </p>
    <p>Newport News, Va. </p>
    <p>A labor-business partnership has resulted in a $240
    million venture to produce five double-hulled tankers,
    creating jobs for Steelworkers and, two years out, shipboard
    jobs for Seafarers and unaffiliated American Maritime
    Officers. </p>
    <p>The ships, which are designed to protect the environment
    from disastrous oil spills, are being built at Newport News
    Shipbuilding with the help of funds from Union Labor Life
    Insurance Co., one of the investors in the project. Union
    construction is expected to begin in 1997, with the vessels
    placed in service in 1998. </p>
    <p>AFL-CIO President John J. Sweeney joined ULLICO Chairman
    and CEO Robert A. Georgine, who is also president of the
    federation's Building and Construction Trades Department, in
    saluting the labor- management partnership that resulted in
    the venture. </p>
    <p>&quot;It means thousands of Steelworker jobs and more jobs
    for union seafarers and maritime officers after they are
    built, and it's a great demonstration of what we can do when
    there's a little respect coming from an employer,&quot;
    Sweeney said. </p>
    <p>Georgine noted that federal loan guarantees cover about
    87.5 percent of the cost and add a significant margin of
    safety to the investment, which is being made with
    Taft-Hartley pension funds. </p>
    <p>&quot;Second, we had to be sure that the other partners
    would work with us to meet fair labor employment
    standards,&quot; he said. &quot;They did, and it all adds up
    to environmentally responsible transport of petroleum in U.S.
    waters by U.S.-built, U.S.-owned and U.S.- operated ships,
    which is good news for America and good news for
    workers.&quot; </p>
    <p>ULLICO's investment objectives included achieving
    higher-than- market returns, while helping unions, their
    members and companies that are good employers. </p>
    <p>&quot;The project is living proof that jobs and profit can
    go hand in hand, and are not on a collision course, as some
    would have us believe,&quot; ULLICO said. &quot;In the
    long-run, America will have a strong economy if investments .
    . . are made to good use in real- life enterprises where
    capital and jobs are created.&quot; </p>
    <p>The &quot;Double Eagles,&quot; as the tankers are known,
    will be among the first tankers built in American shipyards
    since passage of the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, a legislative
    response to the Exxon Valdez oil spill that requires the
    phasing out of single-hull vessels entering U.S. waters. </p>

    <p align="center"><font size="4">Mariners weathering rough
    seas of foreign flags <br>

    <p align="center">David Kameras</p>
    <p>Seattle </p>
    <p>Throughout the post-war period, the United States has kept
    its merchant marine afloat through a mixture of subsidies and
    other support programs to ensure that it can meet its defense
    commitments and protect its economy. </p>
    <p>But soon, the last of the operating subsidy contracts will
    be expiring, and a coalition of huge multinational grain and
    shipping interests is placing longstanding maritime policies
    under attack. Maritime unions see this fight as crucial to
    the future of the industry and maritime jobs. </p>
    <p>The showdown may come next month in the Senate, when a
    bill to earmark $1 billion a year for 10 years for maritime
    subsidies comes up. The bill, H.R. 1350, was passed by the
    House and is supported by the administration. It would allow
    U.S.-flag operators to compete globally despite the higher
    costs of the American registry, and indirectly give a boost
    to commercial shipbuilding as well. </p>
    <p>As Congress debates whether to throw a life preserver to
    the industry, regulatory agencies have granted waivers
    permitting American shipping companies to register their
    vessels under foreign &quot;flags of convenience,&quot;
    thereby evading a requirement that their crews be composed of
    U.S. citizens and the union contracts that protect them. </p>
    <p>&quot;American firms are moving foreign flag, which I
    believe our Congress could put a stop to if they wanted
    to,&quot; said Henry Jones Jr., a Seafarers chief steward
    serving on liquefied natural gas carriers operated by Energy
    Transportation Corp. The U.S. government allowed Sea-Land
    Service to re-flag a portion of its fleet at the cost of up
    to 150 jobs in Seattle, he said. </p>
    <p>Last year, a captain belonging to the Masters, Mates and
    Pilots, a Longshoremen's affiliate, was fired for hoisting a
    &quot;Don't Tread On Me&quot; flag after American President
    Lines, a major West Coast employer, won the right to use
    foreign crews on its new ships. He was reinstated only after
    pressure from his union and the AFL-CIO Maritime Trades
    Department. </p>
    <p><strong>Fighting for their livelihood </strong></p>
    <p>&quot;The companies are threatening us with foreign flags,
    which makes you feel insecure,&quot; added Dotty Hoffman, an
    SIU able-bodied seaman and splicer with Trans-Oceanic Cable
    Co., an AT&amp;T subsidiary. &quot;Plus, they use that during
    contract negotiations to keep our wages down.&quot; </p>
    <p>Jones, Hoffman and other maritime workers in Seattle
    talked recently about the decline of the U.S. merchant
    marine, and what this could mean for the next generation to
    go into the shipyards and out to sea. </p>
    <p>&quot;The young people coming into the industry now can't
    count on having a job for 20 years, or having a job they can
    settle on,&quot; Jone said. </p>
    <p>&quot;There are no more young people,&quot; said Jeff
    Engels, an able- bodied seaman for nearly 20 years, most of
    that time with the Inland Boatman's Union of the Pacific, a
    Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Union affiliate. &quot;I
    would hate to be an 18-year-old today.&quot; </p>
    <p>&quot;The industry's in trouble, and because of that, the
    country's security and prestige are in trouble,&quot; said
    Mike Hester, another SIU able-bodied seaman. &quot;Hundreds
    of thousands of people who work in the maritime industry need
    to put bread on the table. It's scary.&quot; </p>
    <p>Still, there are some bright spots for those who ply the
    waters. </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Several tankers currently are being built in U.S.
            shipyards, carrying the promise of maintained and
            expanded jobs in domestic oil shipping. </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>Many municipalities and regions have adopted or are
            considering passenger ferry service, and
            old-fashioned paddlewheelers are once again cruising
            the Mississippi River. </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>The Ready Reserve Force of auxiliary vessels
            continues to be strengthened, reflecting the fact
            that many in the Navy, as well as many in Congress,
            continue to see the wisdom in having a privatized
            fleet available for national security purposes. </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>Prospects for the international carriage of liquified
            natural gas remain strong. </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>Thanks largely to the efforts of maritime labor, the
            World Trade Organization continues to exclude
            maritime services from its regime, protecting U.S.
            flag domestic routes from foreign operators bent on
            subjecting their crews to slave-like conditions and
            by foreign governments willing to operate below cost
            in order to gain hard currency. </li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Maritime in global market </strong></p>
    <p>National security always has been the guiding rationale
    for a strong merchant marine. The U.S.-built, U.S.-crewed
    requirement of the American registry is intended to ensure a
    shipyard mobilization base and seagoing manpower pool
    adequate to meet the rigors of a national emergency. </p>
    <p>Operating subsidies, meant to compensate shipping
    companies for the higher costs associated with the flag in
    what is a global marketplace, require in return a transfer of
    vessels and crews to military jurisdiction during war, saving
    the Pentagon billions of dollars in building and mothballing
    idle ships. But with shrinking federal budgets presided over
    by legislators from states and districts often far removed
    from waterborne commerce, out of sight sometimes means out of
    mind. </p>
    <p>&quot;These other countries are unscrupulous,&quot; Hester
    said. &quot;They don't care about giving their seamen safe
    working conditions or a living wage, and because of that,
    we're at a competitive disadvantage. </p>
    <p>&quot;The big question has been whether the government
    should subsidize private business, but that's really a false
    issue,&quot; he said. &quot;America needs a merchant fleet.
    Everybody wants America to be strong, Democrat and
    Republican, rich and poor. The Navy alone isn't going to get
    the job done, and without a body of merchant mariners and
    ships that are available to the American merchant fleet, it's
    not going to happen.&quot; </p>
    <p>When AT&amp;T recently bought a foreign ship, it
    registered it under the Stars and Stripes only after getting
    heat from the military, Hoffman said. &quot;When we lay
    cables, one fiber is designated a lot of times for military
    use only. So they saw that as a threat to national
    security,&quot; she said. </p>
    <p>The threat isn't limited to technology. Without adequate
    American ships and enough loyal Americans ready to risk their
    lives in crewing them in a war zone, the United States can
    become dangerously dependent on foreign powers. </p>
    <p>&quot;An example is Desert Storm,&quot; Hoffman said.
    &quot;I went on three ships to the Persian Gulf carrying
    equipment, and they actually asked foreign ships to help us,
    and they turned us down. If that happens again, who's going
    to supply our troops with the things they need?&quot; </p>
    <p>&quot;If we have another Desert Storm, good luck,&quot;
    said Jim Sutton, a District 1 Marine Engineer. </p>
    <p><strong>Multinational pirates </strong></p>
    <p>Moves to repeal the Jones Act, a 1920 statute that
    restricts coastwise domestic shipping to U.S.-flag vessels,
    got a high profile on Capitol Hill this year, thanks largely
    to multinational interests hoping to include America in the
    global race to the bottom of a pool of bad wages and working
    conditions. </p>
    <p>&quot;Just seeing the conditions on these foreign vessels
    is horrendous,&quot; said IBU Secretary-Treasurer Terri Mast. </p>
    <p>&quot;Any proposal that would allow substandard foreign
    vessels into our coastwise trades would undo the work of
    generations of men and women who have labored to raise the
    safety and environmental standards of our U.S.-flag fleet to
    its current high level,&quot; MEBA President Alex Shandrowsky
    told a House subcommittee this year. &quot;It would be an
    insult to American values and traditions &thorn; and to the
    citizens of this country &thorn; should we cast aside the
    fruits of that labor.&quot; </p>
    <p>Maritime unions have been instrumental in helping their
    members meet the challenges of a rapidly changing industry. </p>
    <p>&quot;We're always upgrading our membership,&quot; said
    Jones, whose union operates a state-of-the-art training
    facility in Maryland. </p>
    <p>&quot;Joining the union was sort of like being adopted by
    a healthy family, a really good family,&quot; Hester said.
    &quot;Everything that I have, the union helped me get. It's
    an enormous opportunity for someone who doesn't have a lot of
    skills, but wants to work hard and is willing to learn. It's
    a good legacy from the working people that came before
    us.&quot; </p>

    </font>by </p>
    <p align="center">James B. Parks </p>
    <p>Talk of strength through unity and political action
    dominated the Steelworkers' convention as delegates discussed
    mergers and vowed to mobilize members to elect a pro-worker
    Congress. </p>
    <p>Meeting under the theme, &quot;Together, Tougher Than
    Steel,&quot; the convention was the first since the union's
    1995 merger with the Rubber Workers and the announcement of a
    proposed unification with the UAW and Machinists by 2000.
    Delegates also were told of ongoing merger talks with the
    Aluminum, Brick and Glass Workers. </p>
    <p>Presidents Stephen P. Yokich of the UAW and George
    Kourpias of the IAM joined USWA President George Becker in
    praising the unification of the three unions as a way to
    fight anti-worker forces such as Bridgestone/Firestone,
    Caterpillar and McDonnell Douglas, all of whom are embroiled
    in labor disputes with one of the three unions. Delegates
    approved a resolution supporting the unification. </p>
    <p>Becker and ABG President Ernie LaBaff announced the ABG
    will meet in a special convention soon to consider merger
    with the Steelworkers. If that merger is approved, the union
    would represent 95 percent of all aluminum workers. </p>
    <p>Calling this year &quot;probably the most important in the
    history of our movement,&quot; AFL-CIO President John J.
    Sweeney hailed the unification and predicted that labor's
    &quot;rising spirit and new voice&quot; will spell success in
    November, ushering in a progressive majority on Capitol Hill
    and in the White House. </p>
    <p>But he warned that unless unions match their political
    success with organizing gains, &quot;this year will be like a
    false Spring; we're going to feel really good for a while,
    and then a cold freeze is going to hit our budding
    revitalization and we will be dead.&quot; </p>
    <p>President Clinton, who was endorsed for re-election by the
    convention, addressed the delegates via satellite. He urged
    the delegates to spread the word about anti-labor measures
    supported by Republican leaders, many of which would have
    become law had the administration not vetoed or blocked them.
    Clinton cited the TEAM Act, Davis-Bacon and OSHA budget cuts
    as examples of the GOP's efforts to hurt workers. </p>
    <p>&quot;Unless we win the presidential election and change
    the composition of Congress, they will keep trying over and
    over,&quot; Clinton said. The convention voted to work for a
    new Democratic- controlled Congress. </p>
    <p>The delegates also voted to expand the union's
    &quot;rapid- response&quot; network of members throughout the
    country. The network, launched in April, is designed to
    mobilize members to respond to critical issues that face
    workers. </p>
    <p>The network has been used to generate letters and phone
    calls to legislators. On the TEAM Act alone, USWA Local 831,
    a former Rubber Workers local in Danville, Va., generated
    1,200 letters and phone calls to lawmakers; Local 2175 in
    Minneapolis produced 196 handwritten letters from its 400
    members and 91 of the 106 members of Local 690 in Auburn
    Hills, Mich., wrote personal letters. </p>
    <p>The delegates called on every USWA local to have at least
    4 percent of its total membership from all units, departments
    and locations involved in rapid response. Each local will be
    equipped with a fax machine to use in the program, Becker
    said. </p>

    <p>Las Vegas </p>
    <p>The Plumbers and Pipefitters elected new leaders, who
    immediately called for expanded efforts in politics and
    organizing. </p>
    <p>&quot;There are well-funded and tough adversaries out
    there, and we cannot afford to relax our guard even for a
    moment,&quot; President Martin J. Maddaloni told more than
    3,100 delegates to the union's 35th general convention. </p>
    <p>He cited attacks on the Davis-Bacon Act, and Occupational
    Safety and Health Administration and Mine Safety and Health
    Administration regulations, limitations on workers'
    compensation and unemployment insurance, anti-labor
    amendments to the National Labor Relations Act and attempts
    to dismantle Medicare. </p>
    <p>&quot;We have learned important lessons from this
    adversity,&quot; he said. &quot;It is time to give our
    adversaries an education of their own.&quot; </p>
    <p>Maddaloni proposed a covenant with the delegates to build
    the UA's membership and strength, build and expand the
    marketplace for union contractors and fight legislators who
    would diminish members' opportunities and economic security.
    He also pledged a rededication to aggressive organizing
    efforts, including targeting areas outside traditional
    building trades, such as electronics, mechanical equipment
    service, fire protection and instrumentation. </p>
    <p>&quot;We must increase our membership if we are to stay
    strong and competitive in the years ahead,&quot; he said. </p>
    <p>That view was echoed by AFL-CIO President John J. Sweeney.
    &quot;Unless we get serious about organizing, this year will
    be like a false spring &thorn; we're going to feel really
    good for a while, and then a cold freeze is going to hit our
    budding revitalization, and we will be dead,&quot; he said. </p>
    <p>Maddaloni, who served earlier in a number of union
    offices, replaces Marvin J. Boede, who retired after 14 years
    as president. Also elected were Michael A. Collins as
    secretary-treasurer, C. Randal Gardner as assistant
    president, a new executive board and 32 international
    representatives. Delegates also produced a revised union
    constitution and a wide range of resolutions. </p>
    <p>Other speakers included AFL-CIO Building and Construction
    Trades Department President Robert A. Georgine, Sens. Barbara
    Boxer (D-Calif.) and Arlen Specter (R-Pa.), House Minority
    Leader Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.), Rep. Thomas M. Foglietta
    (D-Pa.), Nevada Gov. Bob Miller (D) and National Council of
    Senior Citizens Director Steve Protulis. </p>

    <p align="center"><font size="4">IAM makes federal case of
    McDonnell Douglas dispute <br>
    </font>by </p>
    <p align="center">James B. Parks </p>
    <p>The Machinists asked President Clinton to withhold any
    federal payments to McDonnell Douglas related to the 11-week
    strike at the company's St. Louis aerospace defense
    facilities. </p>
    <p>In an Aug. 14 letter, IAM President George J. Kourpias
    also asked Clinton to request an audit of the quality, cost
    and safety of all work performed for the government by some
    2,000 &quot;temporary replacement&quot; workers from across
    the country hired by McDonnell Douglas since the strike began
    June 5. The company also has hired a private security force
    that specializes in combating strikes. </p>
    <p>&quot;It is my understanding that the U.S. taxpayers are
    financing this,&quot; Kourpias wrote. &quot;Lacking any
    explicit prohibitions in federal law, military contractors
    can, and do, bill the Defense Department for costs they incur
    in a labor dispute,&quot; he said. </p>
    <p>&quot;The practice of federal agencies subsidizing the
    strike costs of defense contractors is grossly unfair and
    discriminatory, and it should be halted at once,&quot;
    Kourpias wrote. McDonnell Douglas, the nation's largest
    defense contractor, receives about $9.2 billion annually from
    taxpayer-financed projects. </p>
    <p>Negotiations stalled when McDonnell Douglas refused to
    offer job security protections to settle the strike. </p>
    <p>Declaring that &quot;there will be no agreement without
    job security,&quot; IAM District 837 President Jerry Oulsen
    accused the company of sabotaging the talks. &quot;The union
    made new proposals to accommodate the company's need for job
    flexibility, with the clear expectation that the company
    would meet the workers' need for job security,&quot; Oulsen
    said. &quot;But the company claimed their negotiators have no
    authority to discuss job security and the subject is no
    longer even on the table.&quot; </p>
    <p>The talks broke down Aug. 16, just two days after
    negotiators had reported progress on the key issue of
    outsourcing. Bargaining had gone on for five consecutive days
    before the breakdown, the first time that had occurred since
    the strike began June 5. </p>
    <p>The talks followed a mass &quot;March for American
    Jobs&quot; by 10,000 people on McDonnell Douglas headquarters
    in St. Louis Aug. 11, led by AFL-CIO Secretary-Treasurer
    Richard L. Trumka and Kourpias. </p>
    <p>&quot;America is sick of corporate greed,&quot; Trumka
    told the crowd. &quot;America is sick of rich corporations
    sending our best jobs and technologies overseas, and taking
    huge executive bonuses while laying off loyal American
    workers.&quot; </p>
    <p>UAW Secretary-Treasurer Roy Wyse told the strikers,
    &quot;Labor is not going to fail here. This will send a
    message to other companies all across the nation and teach
    them something about corporate responsibility. Mac won't
    win.&quot; </p>
    <p>Some 6,400 employees walked out June 5 at McDonnell
    Douglas' St. Louis plant after rejecting the aerospace
    company's latest contract offer. The key issue in the talks
    is McDonnell's increasing use of outside contractors and the
    transfer of some work to nonunion plants in Mesa, Ariz., and
    Macon, Ga. </p>
    <p>The union is seeking the same basic job security
    provisions that already cover workers at McDonnell Douglas
    competitors, Boeing, General Electric and Pratt &amp;
    Whitney, Oulsen said. </p>
    <p>The company announced June 12 it would hire temporary
    replacement workers at the plant, which makes military
    aircraft, and temporarily transfer some production to other
    plants or to subcontractors. </p>

    <p>A year of bitter negotiations ended when the California
    State Employees, an affiliate of the Service Employees,
    reached agreement with the California State University system
    on a new three-year contract. </p>
    <p>Under the agreement, some 13,000 employees will receive a
    2.48 percent raise retroactive to July 1. The contract also
    includes an increase in shift differential pay and a 2
    percent service salary increase. Workers in seven
    classifications will receive raises to bring their salaries
    in line with similar workers outside the university system.
    The contract expired in July 1995. </p>
    <p>Unit members also will receive paid maternity leave and
    family leave consistent with the federal Family and Medical
    Leave Act. </p>
    <p>The agreement covers administrative, instructional
    support, operations, health care and technical support
    employees of the CSU system. </p>
    <p><a name="Gas workers settle "><strong>Gas workers settle </strong></a></p>
    <p>The Utility Workers and Chemical Workers reached tentative
    agreement on a new two-year contract with Southern California
    Gas that would raise salaries by 3 percent for 5,100
    employees. </p>
    <p>The deal includes a 2.7 percent lump sum bonus after
    ratification and another 2.7 percent payment in 1997, the
    same year the wage increase begins. The company agreed not to
    lay off any full-time employee in the bargaining unit except
    for disciplinary reasons. </p>
    <p>In a side agreement, both sides agreed to limit to 250 per
    year the total number of layoffs, terminations and work force
    reductions in the two years after the contract expires in
    1998. </p>

    secure the future of the Delphi Harrison Thermal Systems
    plant in Loraine, Ohio. </p>
    <p>The agreement, which covers 3,300 hourly employees,
    establishes a two-tier wage system and provides early
    retirement incentives for senior employees. </p>
    <p>GM considered closing the suburban Dayton plant that makes
    compressors and dehydrators for automotive air conditioners,
    but kept it open after negotiations produced cost-cutting.
    The new agreement includes assurances from GM to keep the
    plant open as long as it remains profitable. </p>

    Guerrero Mexican Food Products, the largest tortilla producer
    in southern California. </p>
    <p>The union charges that as a subsidiary of a huge Mexican
    corn flour conglomerate closely aligned with that country's
    ruling circles, Guerrero, which also markets under the
    &quot;Mission&quot; brand, has benefited from corporate
    welfare and has been driving independent operators out of
    business. </p>
    <p>The drivers, who are seeking a second contract with
    payment of overtime, better health insurance and a pension
    plan, joined with other labor, community, campus and
    religious groups for a rally Aug. 7 in front of the Mexican
    consulate in Los Angeles. </p>
    <p>With up to 70 percent of the local market,
    Mission-Guerrero sells to large grocery chains like Ralphs
    and Vons and smaller stores, with the remainder going to
    food-service buyers like Taco Bell and the U.S. Army. </p>
    <p><a name="Atomic workers extend"><strong>Atomic workers

    <p>The Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers ratified a five-year
    extension of an agreement with Lockheed Martin Energy
    Systems. </p>
    <p>It covers some 800 employees at the Energy Department's
    Oak Ridge, Tenn., operations and follows the pattern set in
    contracts negotiated by the Oak Ridge Atomic Trades Council.
    Those cover 2,500 employees from 17 unions, and all apply to
    three Oak Ridge facilities operated by Lockheed for DoE. </p>
    <p>The new agreement raises wages by 3 percent each year for
    production and maintenance employees at the K-25 facility,
    which is involved in atomic waste management and
    environmental work. Employees also will receive a $500
    lump-sum bonus. </p>
    <p>Employees will have a choice between two managed care
    medical plans that will replace the preferred provider and
    health maintenance programs. </p>

    <p>The separate but parallel agreements for units of
    production and maintenance and clerical and technical workers
    both call for a combination of general wage increases and
    lump-sum bonuses. </p>
    <p>The 3,200 employees, represented by UAW Locals 218 and
    317, will receive 3 percent wage increases and $1,500 lump
    sum payments in the first and third years of the contract and
    only a $1,500 payment in the second year. </p>

    <p align="center"><font size="4">AFT: `Preserve Public
    Education' <br>
    </font>by </p>
    <p align="center">Muriel H. Cooper </p>
    <p>Cincinnati </p>
    <p>AFT delegates were challenged by President Albert Shanker
    to increase activism in and out of the classroom. &quot;It is
    as much our duty to preserve public education as it is to
    negotiate a good contract or defend a competent teacher under
    attack,&quot; he said. </p>
    <p>Speaking to the union's 74th biennial convention, Shanker
    said there is still support for public education, especially
    when schools hold students to high standards in academic
    achievement and discipline. </p>
    <p>Shanker urged union members to become involved with AFT's
    &quot;Lessons for Life&quot; campaign, in which members,
    communities, parents and legislators push for shared goals. </p>
    <p>AFL-CIO President John J. Sweeney lauded the campaign and
    told delegates they have the full support of the federation.
    He also recognized the union's effort to &quot;put public
    education back in its proper place at the top of our national
    agenda.&quot; </p>
    <p>&quot;Creating strong academic standards in the United
    States is doable,&quot; said Shanker, citing the union's
    second annual &quot;Making Standards Matter&quot; report, an
    analysis of efforts to develop improved academic standards
    throughout the country. </p>
    <p>The union also released a report endorsing charter schools
    as a useful tool for school reform, provided they can
    demonstrate improved student achievement. </p>
    <p>The convention featured 16 workshops on such major
    educational issues as moving from social promotion to earned
    promotion, establishing and enforcing standards of conduct
    and college-school partnerships to raise student achievement. </p>
    <p>The delegates endorsed President Clinton and Vice
    President Gore, later hearing from the vice president. Other
    speakers included Rep. Richard A. Gephardt, (D-Mo.),
    actor/activist Richard Dreyfuss, and human rights activists
    Harry Wu and 13-year-old Craig Kielburger, who has spoken out
    against child labor. </p>
    <p>After hearing from Wu and Kielburger, the delegates passed
    a resolution pledging to put sweatshops out of business.
    &quot;It is unconscionable what these companies do to save
    money,&quot; said Shanker. &quot;We will do whatever it takes
    to get sweatshop owners to change their practices.&quot; </p>
    <p>The union will work with organizations in the Partnership
    for Responsibility, a coalition designed to end sweatshops
    and protect workers' rights. </p>
    <p>Approving continued merger discussions with the National
    Education Association, the convention passed a no-raid
    agreement between the unions. </p>
    <p>Delegates also approved a 4.4 percent per-capita increase
    over the next two years. </p>
    <p>Responding to the market-driven changes in health care,
    the convention approved a nationwide campaign &quot;to
    mobilize consumers and purchases of care, health care workers
    and the general public to promote and defend high standards
    of quality, access and choice. The AFT's Federation of Nurses
    and Health Professionals division will lead the Quality
    First&quot; campaign. </p>

    </font>AFL-CIO President John J. Sweeney has written a new
    book about the fight for economic security and social
    justice. </p>
    <p>&quot;America Needs A Raise,&quot; published by Houghton

    corporations and government have failed America's working
    families &thorn; and what we can do about it. </p>
    <p>The book sketches Sweeney's rise from humble jobs in the

    Along the way, he developed a sense that workers have to
    stick together to build communities that nourish families and

    <p>His analysis of what has gone wrong in America is well
    documented, with facts and figures that testify to why
    &quot;America Needs A Raise.&quot; </p>
    <p>Sale proceeds will go to a special fund to help working

    <p align="center"><font size="4">Fire Fighters vow war on
    privatization <br>
    </font>by </p>
    <p align="center">Sharolyn A. Rosier </p>
    <p>Honolulu </p>
    <p>Delegates to the 43rd Fire Fighters convention vowed to
    use the power of the ballot box and union solidarity to stop
    privatization and other anti-worker measures. </p>
    <p>Following an address by President Clinton via satellite,
    the 1,500 delegates responded with unanimous endorsement of
    the Clinton-Gore ticket, citing Clinton's support for
    national collective bargaining for all public employees,
    among other pro- worker stances. </p>
    <p>Whitehead told delegates President Clinton is
    &quot;pro-worker, pro-family and pro-fire fighter,&quot;
    citing the administration's support for important safety
    regulations that protect fire fighters in the line of duty. </p>
    <p>To thwart state and local governments' efforts to
    privatize public service across the country, the delegates
    also earmarked nearly $250,000 for a major new initiative to
    combat privatization of the nation's fire and emergency
    medical services. </p>
    <p>&quot;If we are to meet the challenges of the future, if
    our union is to be positioned to represent the interests of
    our members in the next millennium, then we must continue to
    stay ahead of the curve,&quot; IAFF President Alfred K.
    Whitehead said. </p>
    <p>Private, for-profit corporations are an emerging threat to
    the living standards, economic security and professionalism
    of fire fighters, Whitehead declared. &quot;These
    corporations offer to provide fire and emergency medical
    services more cheaply &thorn; and still made a profit by
    cutting down wages, apparatus, staffing levels, training and
    professional standards.&quot; </p>
    <p>Delegates underscored the union's commitment to political
    action by voting for a substantial increase in funding for
    the IAFF PAC. </p>
    <p>&quot;You have one of the finest legislative and political
    operations in the American labor movement, and every time the
    bell rings, you are there,&quot; AFL-CIO President John J.
    Sweeney told the delegates. &quot;Over the past few years,
    you've demonstrated what it takes by increasing your
    political action activity tenfold and pouring resources into
    legislative fights.&quot; </p>
    <p>Delegates also re-elected Whitehead and
    Secretary-Treasurer Vincent J. Bollon to their third
    four-year terms. Fifteen district vice presidents were
    re-elected, along with a new vice president, William Taylor,
    representing the fourth district in Baltimore. </p>
    <p>Other speakers included Hawaii Democratic Sen. Daniel
    Akaka and Reps. Patsy Mink and Neil Abercrombie; and Jerry
    Lewis, entertainer and chairman of the Muscular Dystrophy
    Association. </p>

    <p>The Glass, Molders and Pottery Workers re-elected their
    top leaders and rallied the union to meet the political
    challenge this year. </p>
    <p>&quot;America's unions are back!&quot; AFL-CIO
    Secretary-Treasurer Richard L. Trumka proclaimed as he urged
    the delegates to mobilize for the November election and
    beyond. &quot;You can feel the anger and the resentment and
    the frustration turning into hope for tens of millions of
    working Americans.&quot; </p>
    <p>GMP President Frank W. Carter told the convention that
    concerted political action could help win a better future for
    working people. The 762 delegates, meeting in Las Vegas,
    voted to raise international union dues by $2 per month per
    member and to give locals the option of raising dues by up to
    $4.50 per month. The increase was needed, Secretary-Treasurer
    James H. Rankin said, to sustain the services the
    international provides. </p>
    <p>Carter, Rankin and all other incumbent officers were re-
    elected without opposition. </p>
    <p>Other speakers included House Minority Leader Richard A.
    Gephardt (D-Mo.), Minority Whip David E. Bonior (D-Mich.),
    Rep. Robert F. Andrews (D-N.J.) and Gordon Wilson, president
    of the Ontario labor federation. </p>

    <p>In the second major agreement of its kind this year, the
    Carpenters have joined forces with the Ingersoll-Rand
    Architectural Hardware Division to improve training and
    standards in the construction industry. </p>
    <p>Ingersoll-Rand will provide technical support and training
    materials and will certify instructors and installers upon
    completion of the training. The UBC will provide the
    apprenticeship and training programs. The union signed a
    similar agreement with Wilsonart this year. </p>
    <p>&quot;This program is a win-win-win arrangement,&quot;
    said Dudley Light, UBC technical coordinator for
    apprenticeship. &quot;The construction industry,
    Ingersoll-Rand and the UBC will all benefit from this
    innovative program.&quot; </p>

    <p>&quot;Working families and their unions are re-emerging as
    a national political force,&quot; AFL-CIO Executive Vice
    President Linda Chavez-Thompson told the convention,
    &quot;because Congress got the message that we're watching
    what they do.&quot; </p>
    <p>Some 300 delegates endorsed for re-election their
    congressional contingent of Democratic Reps. Alan B.
    Mollohan, Robert E. Wise Jr. and Nick Joe Rahall II, as well
    as Sen. John J. Rockefeller IV (D). Democratic challenger
    Charlotte Pritt garnered the group's nod for governor, while
    endorsements were made in several statewide judicial races as
    well. </p>
    <p>Resolutions concerning workers' compensation and public
    employees' right to organize were taken up. </p>

    <p>Trade unionists meeting one state away from West Virginia
    also focused on politics, as the 29th constitutional
    convention of the Virginia AFL-CIO met in Williamsburg Aug.
    15-17. </p>
    <p>Federation President John J. Sweeney keynoted that
    gathering, warning Democrats in the state's legislature that
    labor is tired of carrying their water and coming up with a
    bucket of mud. Sweeney also went to Newport News Shipbuilding
    with AFL-CIO Vice President and Union Labor Life Chairman
    Robert A. Georgine to laud a labor- business partnership. </p>
    <p>The 350 delegates made endorsements in several
    congressional races including the Warner Senate race,
    choosing Democrat Mark Warner over incumbent Republican John
    Warner. Also up for discussion were resolutions concerning
    Bridge- stone/Firestone, federal unions, civil rights,
    community services, the Human Resources Development
    Institute, organizing, the Coalition of Black Trade Unionists
    and education. </p>
    <p>Besides Sweeney, the attendees heard from Warner, AFL-CIO
    Political Director Steve Rosenthal, Field Mobilization
    Director Marilyn Sneiderman and Evelyn DuBrow, vice president
    of UNITE. </p>
    <p><a name="Tosco reopens refinery "><strong>Tosco reopens

    <p>The Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers Local 8-234 scored a
    win when Tosco offered to reopen the old BP refinery it
    bought, with a union work force. </p>
    <p>Tosco will rehire 215 of the 500 workers who lost jobs
    when the refinery, located near Philadelphia, was closed
    early this year. The company also will spend $50 million to
    update the factory over the next year. </p>
    <p>&quot;People are going to be real happy around here&quot;
    when the refinery reopens, said Denis J. Stephano, president
    of Local 8-234. &quot;A lot of people were completely
    convinced it would never run again.&quot; </p>

    <p>A building trades boycott of the 17.6-mile Chesapeake Bay
    Bridge and Tunnel has resulted in nearly 9 percent less
    traffic by autos and light trucks. </p>
    <p>&quot;We believe we've hit a home run,&quot; said C. Ray
    Davenport, president of the Virginia Building and
    Construction Trades Council. He estimated the boycott, which
    is supported by the unions in the state AFL-CIO, cost the
    state about $300,000 in lost revenue in July alone. </p>
    <p>The dispute centers on the construction of a new parallel
    span connecting Virginia's Eastern Shore with the Virginia
    Beach and Tidewater areas. </p>
    <p>The $200 million job is being constructed with imported,
    nonunion labor. Davenport said PCL Civil Constructors Inc. of
    Denver refused to negotiate pre-hire agreements with the
    Operating Engineers, Laborers and Carpenters, and instead
    brought in workers from as far away as Florida and Canada. </p>
    <p><a name="APALA plans organizing"><strong>APALA plans

    <p>In another sign of a resurgent labor movement's commitment
    to organizing, more than 250 union leaders, organizers and
    Asian- Pacific-American union activists met in San Diego to
    develop plans to organize the millions of
    Asian-Pacific-Americans in the work force. </p>
    <p>It was the largest organizing conference in recent
    history, Service Employees President Andy Stern said, telling
    the cheering audience that the union movement &quot;must stop
    talking about organizing and start funding.&quot; </p>
    <p>Richard Bensinger, head of the AFL-CIO Organizing
    Department, agreed, and applauded Asian Pacific American
    Labor Alliance for calling on labor unions to allocate 30
    percent of their resources to organizing. </p>
    <p>A joint organizing proposal was developed and announced by
    Guy Fujimura, secretary-treasurer of the Longshoremen's and
    Warehousemen's Local 142. Under the proposal, APALA and the
    unions would develop a national network of
    Asian-Pacific-American organizers, train and hire new
    organizers, reach out to more Asian- Pacific-American workers
    in campaigns, and develop Asian-Pacific- American leaders. </p>

    <p>Delegates go to streets to help hotel workers </p>
    <p>Los Angeles </p>
    <p>Delegates to the 13th biennial Postal Workers convention
    took to the streets in support of a local organizing drive
    and vowed to stand and fight against efforts to privatize
    their jobs. </p>
    <p>The nearly 3,000 delegates emptied the convention hall and
    joined a huge demonstration with the Hotel Employees and
    Restaurant Employees at the New Otani Hotel. Despite the
    searing heat, the APWU and HERE members met at City Hall and
    walked a seven-block circuit to the hotel, shouting and
    chanting slogans. </p>
    <p>HERE Local 11 called for an international boycott of the
    nonunion New Otani Hotel on Jan. 24 and has been picketing
    regularly since. The hotel illegally fired three pro-union
    housekeepers with 16 years of service in order to thwart a
    union organizing drive. The boycott is endorsed by 11 of 15
    members of the L.A. City Council, as well as dozens of labor,
    religious and community groups. </p>
    <p>In the convention hall, delegates participated in an
    interactive live video to dramatize the anti-worker agenda of
    right-wing politicians like Newt Gingrich and managers like
    Postmaster General Marvin Runyon. </p>
    <p>APWU President Moe Biller called on the union members to
    fight in every way necessary all efforts to destroy postal
    jobs through privatization, outsourcing and all other means
    of stealing work from postal workers. &quot;We're now
    fighting for our future. That's our theme, and solidarity is
    what's essential.&quot; </p>
    <p>Delegates also passed more than 50 resolutions addressing
    labor-management issues, including the staffing of contract
    stations, wages and weekend and overtime work. </p>
    <p>House Minority Whip David E. Bonior (D-Mich.) said a
    change to Democrats in control of Congress would end
    anti-worker proposals at the USPS. &quot;This election isn't
    about unfunded mandates and the line-item veto,&quot; he
    said. &quot;It's about jobs and wages and pensions and
    working conditions and health care and education for our
    kids.&quot; </p>
    <p>In a videotaped message, Senate Minority Leader Thomas S.
    Daschle (D-S.D.) promised to fight USPS privatization
    proposals. </p>
    <p>The fight must continue at the ballot box, said Electronic
    Workers Vice President Gloria Johnson, who is also president
    of the Coalition of Labor Union Women. &quot;If President
    Clinton isn't re- elected and we don't recapture the House
    and Senate, we can say goodbye to the hard-won rights of
    workers,&quot; she said. </p>

    <p>Orlando, Fla. </p>
    <p>Political action and the fight against privatization took
    center stage at the Letter Carriers convention as 8,100
    delegates endorsed the re-election of President Clinton and
    voted &quot;no confidence&quot; in the postmaster general. </p>
    <p>Prior to the endorsement vote, Vice President Gore
    addressed the convention via satellite, noting the
    accomplishments of the administration that have benefited
    Letter Carriers and other working men and women. </p>
    <p>&quot;Many on the other side say privatize,&quot; Gore
    said. &quot;Reform yes. Make it work even better, you bet.
    But privatize? Not on your life because, like you, we support
    the Postal Service.&quot; </p>
    <p>NALC President Vincent R. Sombrotto also reminded the
    delegates of the union's position on supporting candidates
    regardless of party. &quot;If the representatives support us,
    we support them. If they don't support us, we don't support
    them.&quot; </p>
    <p>Delegates unanimously voted &quot;no confidence&quot; in
    Postmaster General Marvin Runyon, who has demonstrated his
    lack of support for workers with efforts to privatize and
    restrict rights, the NALC declared in a resolution. </p>
    <p>The resolution also noted that mail processing automation
    continues despite serious problems, that communications
    between the NALC and USPS have deteriorated because of
    abandonment of the Employee Involvement process and that
    Runyon's policies have undercut carriers' efforts to provide
    superior mail service. </p>
    <p>Numerous speakers in the jammed Orange County, Fla.,
    convention center called for action at the ballot box and at
    the post office. </p>
    <p>Rep. Neil Abercrombie (D-Hawaii) told delegates that in
    order to have a worker-friendly Congress next year,
    &quot;everyone must work hard in the November
    elections.&quot; </p>
    <p>Reps. Gene Green (D-Texas) and Karen Thurman (D-Fla.) said
    the current Congress has been the most anti-worker since
    1947, and the only remedy is to send the GOP-controlled body
    home. </p>
    <p>Former Labor Secretary Ray Marshall told the delegates
    that elected officials should be forced to adopt a high-wage
    strategy. Without it, Americans are &quot;going to stay on
    the same path (in which) the rich get richer, workers will be
    less well off&quot; and the country's institutions will be
    weakened. </p>
    <p>Philip Bower, general secretary of the Postal, Telephone
    and Telegraph International, said that unions in Europe are
    resisting privatization, and that unions in Great Britain are
    fighting management efforts to have &quot;team working,&quot;
    which is designed to reduced the influence of unions in the
    workplace. </p>
    <p>Delegates also elected seven union members to serve as
    delegates to the AFL-CIO convention next year. </p>
    <p>Other speakers included former Steelworkers President Lynn
    Williams; Jeff Faux, president of the Economic Policy
    Institute; and radio commentator Jim Hightower. </p>

    </font>by </p>
    <p align="center">Sharolyn A. Rosier </p>
    <p>As the Farm Workers' black eagle flag waved above 15
    cities, thousands of trade unionists and community activists
    from San Jose, Calif., to New Haven, Conn., rallied Aug. 14
    with shouts of &quot;Si Se Puede&quot; (Yes We Can). </p>
    <p>The national day of action to support strawberry workers
    was organized by the UFW and AFL-CIO central labor councils
    during last month's national CLC conference. The strawberry
    workers endure unsanitary conditions, no health insurance,
    slave-like wages and 12-hour work days. </p>
    <p>In San Jose, more than 300 trade unionists, religious and
    community organizations joined in the demonstration in front
    of the downtown federal building. &quot;This is just the
    beginning,&quot; said San Jose CLC Executive Officer Amy
    Dean. &quot;We're going to make sure the injustices
    strawberry pickers endure become common knowledge.&quot; </p>
    <p>In Watsonville, Calif., the UFW strawberry campaign's
    headquarters, some 800 trade unionists, strawberry workers
    and their supporters turned out for the third in a series of
    protests at local berry coolers. &quot;Consumers and the
    public are tired of seeing workers being exploited. There
    hasn't been a wage increase in 10 years,&quot; said UFW
    President Arturo Rodriguez as the crowd chanted in Spanish,
    &quot;We see it, we feel it, the union is here.&quot; </p>
    <p>In downtown San Francisco, workers waved UFW flags, formed
    a human billboard during lunch hour and chanted,
    &quot;Strawberry growers, you're no good, treat your workers
    like you should.&quot; </p>
    <p>During a protest evoking memories of the Cesar Chavez-led
    grape and lettuce boycotts of the 1960s and 70s, more than
    100 Denver trade unionists launched their campaign with a
    rally in front of Our Lady of Guadalupe Church. In Chicago,
    chanting workers were confronted by managers of the Whole
    Foods Market and were asked by the police to leave. </p>
    <p>Following each demonstration, participants passed out
    literature asking consumers to &quot;please tell your grocer
    to support strawberry workers' basic rights.&quot; They also
    visited grocery stores and asked store managers to sign a
    pledge form stating their support for &quot;strawberry
    workers' rights, including a living wage, health insurance
    and clean drinking water and bathrooms in the fields.&quot; </p>
    <p>The workers received additional resources when the AFL-CIO
    Executive Council voted Aug. 6 to provide matching funds to
    the strawberry campaign from the federation's organizing
    campaign fund. </p>

    <p align="center"><font size="4">UMWA pact gains on wages,
    pensions <br>
    </font></p>
    <p>The Mine Workers won significant improvements in pension
    benefits, health insurance and wages for its members and
    retirees in a renegotiated agreement with the Bituminous Coal
    Operators Association. A reopener option in the 1993 contract
    paved the way for the gains. </p>
    <p>&quot;The solidarity our members showed on the picket
    lines in 1993 and the growth of our strike fund placed the
    union in an excellent position to negotiate these
    improvements,&quot; UMWA President Cecil Roberts said.
    &quot;I am pleased to say we reached this agreement without
    having to strike any BCOA companies.&quot; </p>
    <p>The pension provisions apply to about 100,000 members in
    the union's 1950 and 1974 plans. The other improvements cover
    40,000 miners employed by BCOA companies or firms with
    &quot;me too&quot; agreements. </p>
    <p>The new agreement eliminates a huge penalty for miners
    laid off before they turn 50 and who choose to retire at 55
    under the terms of the deferred vested pension program. </p>
    <p>Any laid-off miner, regardless of age at time of layoff,
    who has at least 20 years of service covered by the 1974 plan
    and who has worked after Dec. 16, 1993, would receive a full
    pension if he or she retires at 55. </p>
    <p>The agreement also raises pension credits and extends and
    increases annual bonuses until 1997. The UMWA also won a 25
    percent reduction in the annual family health insurance
    deductible, dropping it from $1,000 to $750. </p>
    <p>The 1993 contract expires Aug. 31, 1998, and both sides
    agreed to early negotiations in 1997. </p>

        Worker rights in Mexico will get U.S. hearing <br>
        </font>by </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p align="center">David Kameras</p>
    <p>The Labor Department has agreed to review charges that
    Mexican labor law discriminates against federal workers who
    try to organize and register independent unions. </p>
    <p>Acting on a petition filed by three labor and human rights
    groups, the U.S. National Administrative Office, an agency
    created to monitor the labor side accord of the North
    American Free Trade Agreement, will recommend whether the
    charges warrant ministerial consultations. The report by the
    NAO will be released within 120 days. </p>
    <p>Under the Mexican process, workers trying to form an
    independent union must first get clearance from a panel that
    includes representatives of the Confederation of Mexican
    Workers (CTM), a union with close ties to the ruling party,
    the subject of earlier complaints in the private sector. </p>
    <p>Human Rights Watch/Americas, the International Labor
    Rights Fund and the National Association of Democratic
    Lawyers contend that Mexico's union certification process is
    biased. They charge that efforts to register independent
    unions are &quot;arbitrarily&quot; rejected, thereby denying
    federal workers their right to associate and organize freely. </p>
    <p>The petition was filed in the wake of a number of Mexican
    Supreme Court decisions striking down a long-standing
    practice of prohibiting union registration by public workers
    where another union is already present, and scrapping
    extension of state contracting schemes at privatized
    businesses, including no-strike clauses. These decisions may
    prove to be valuable tools in breaking the hegemony of the
    pro-government CTM. </p>
    <p>The issue of union registration came up two years ago when
    workers at a Sony Corp. plant in Nuevo Laredo attempted to
    form an independent union. Further declaring their
    independence last May, a million workers defied a parade ban
    imposed by CTM and marched in Mexico City's main square to
    protest their government's economic policies. </p>
    <p>The lack of strong independent labor organizations has
    helped to keep wages depressed in Mexico, making that country
    more attractive to U.S. employers like General Electric,
    which has joined the exodus of manufacturing taking place
    under NAFTA. </p>
    <p>Electronic Workers Local 162 President Gary Hefner thinks
    that Mexican wages under $1 an hour was a big factor in GE's
    Aug. 1 closure of a residential transformer plant in Hickory,
    N.C. &quot;At those wages, the workers are practically paying
    the company to come to work,&quot; he told a &quot;Families
    First&quot; hearing held by congressional Democrats. </p>
    <p>&quot;We have 343 hourly workers and 250 salaried workers
    losing their jobs,&quot; Hefner said. &quot;We gave GE all
    they demanded. We worked with them in their labor-management
    cooperation schemes, even though the benefits all accrued to
    the company. We gave them everything they asked us to give,
    in the hope of keeping our jobs in Hickory. They took it all,
    and then they took our jobs too.&quot; </p>
    <p>Other American employers are playing the Mexico card. Ford
    Motor Co. barred Canadian and U.S. union officials and human
    rights group members from observing an Aug. 13 union election
    at one of the company's plants near Mexico City, although the
    group spent the day in front of the plant interviewing
    workers. Ford kept the Cleto Nigmo Committee of Independent
    Observers out in deference to the existing union, a section
    of the CTM, which Ford said could decide all union matters. </p>
    <p>The group called for invalidation of the election because
    a slate of dissident candidates was refused inclusion on the
    ballot, despite having collected sufficient signatures to
    qualify. </p>
    <p>Postal Workers President Moe Biller charged the Postal
    Service with helping a San Diego firm use Mexican workers
    earning $4 a day to prepare letters for large-scale U.S.
    mailing companies, in effect sending postal jobs south of the
    border. </p>
    <p>Meanwhile, the United States is running into opposition
    from its trading partners as it tries to get the World Trade
    Organization to agree to linkage between trade and labor
    standards. </p>
    <p>The United Kingdom has been a leading voice in the
    European Community against the proposal, joined by developing
    countries, many of whom rely on a submissive domestic work
    force to expand their markets. </p>
    <p>The governments of many developing countries have cozy
    relationships with multinational corporations like Nike and
    Reebok, resulting in minuscule wages and outrageous working
    conditions, Rev. Jesse L. Jackson told the Executive Council
    in August. </p>
    <p>&quot;I am convinced that unless we address this, the vast
    body of oppressed workers can swallow up our labor market and
    not even have indigestion,&quot; he said. </p>

    and low-wage labor. </p>
    <p>The U.S.-China deficit reached $3.3 billion in June, up
    from $3 billion a year ago. The deficit with Japan, by
    contrast, narrowed significantly over the 12 months, from
    $5.3 billion to $3.2 billion. The deficit with the Pacific
    Rim narrowed too, thanks largely to the decline with Japan. </p>
    <p>The gold rush south by U.S. corporations helped to create
    a bilateral merchandise trade deficit with Mexico of $8.3
    billion for the first six months of the year, $600 million
    greater than in the same period in 1995. </p>
    <p>Overall, the merchandise trade deficit was $12.3 billion
    in June, a decrease from $13.2 billion a month earlier. </p>
    <p>For the first half of the year, deficits were scored in
    vehicles ($26.4 billion), clothing and footwear ($20.2
    billion), data processing and office machinery ($11.6
    billion), electrical machinery ($9.6 billion), home
    electronics ($5.5 billion), toys and sporting goods ($3.9
    billion), iron and steel products ($3.7 billion), furniture
    and bedding ($2.9 billion) and paper and paperboard ($1
    billion). Airplanes and parts ($10.3 billion) and general and
    specialized machinery ($3.8 billion) yielded surpluses. </p>

    <p align="center"><font size="4">As layoffs mount, backlash
    grows <br>
    </font>by </p>
    <p align="center">David Kameras </p>
    <p>In the wake of AFL-CIO efforts to inform Americans of the
    consequences of low wages and job insecurity, evidence of a
    backlash against the mania of corporate mergers and
    downsizing that has marked this decade appears to be growing. </p>
    <p>One example can be seen in the obscure government
    procurement regulations that actually encourage armsmakers to
    merge into megacorporations, costing thousands of jobs. This
    situation brought together Independent Rep. Bernard Sanders
    (Vt.) and Republican Rep. Christopher H. Smith (N.J.) to
    sponsor an amendment to the defense appropriations bill to
    stop &quot;payoffs for layoffs.&quot; </p>
    <p>Already, the American taxpayer is slated to foot the bill
    for some $300 million in merger expenses, on the absurd
    premise that closing plants increases productivity that will
    result in cost savings some time in the future, courtesy of
    an even more concentrated defense establishment. </p>
    <p>When Lockheed and Martin Marietta merged, thousands of
    union workers at an assembly plant in Marietta, Ga., were let
    go. Yet &quot;contrary to the facts of an increasing stock
    value and skyrocketing executive compensation, our members
    did not receive any compensation or retraining
    assistance,&quot; said James M. Carroll, president and
    directing business representative of Machinists Local Lodge
    709. </p>
    <p>The Sanders-Smith amendment was passed in the House but
    rejected by the Senate. Still, conferees may move for a study
    of the problem. </p>
    <p>&quot;At a time when real wages in this country for
    working people are in decline, at a time when people are
    scared to death about whether or not they are going to have
    their decent-paying jobs, they do not want to see their tax
    dollars going to large multibillion-dollar corporations so
    that these companies can then merge and lay off American
    workers,&quot; Sanders said. </p>
    <p>Polls show that Americans increasingly believe that
    corporate greed is the source of their economic insecurity,
    putting corporations on the defensive. </p>
    <p>Briggs &amp; Stratton Corp., for example, sued the
    National Catholic Reporter, an independent nonprofit
    religious newsweekly, for $30 million over an article almost
    two years old that asserted the company was &quot;in either
    denial or moral blindness&quot; when it acted to shift 2,000
    union jobs in Milwaukee to nonunion plants in the South. </p>
    <p>Corporate prickleness, however, has not been matched by
    corporate responsibility. The Bureau of Labor Statistics
    reported that 232,713 workers lost their jobs as part of mass
    layoffs during the first quarter of this year. </p>
    <p>And private-sector figures have the number of layoffs in
    July pegged at 41,843, 4.2 percent higher than in June and
    almost 80 percent more than a year ago. </p>
    <p>In July, the jobless rate edged up 0.1 percent, to 5.4
    percent, remaining in the range of 5.3 percent to 5.8 percent
    where it has languished since the fall of 1994. </p>
    <p>In addition to 7.3 million officially jobless, 4.4 million
    were working involuntary part time and 1.4 million wanted
    work and were available, but had stopped looking for jobs.
    That left a total of 13.1 million unemployed or
    underemployed. The alternative rate used by BLS to evaluate
    labor underutilization held steady at 10 percent. </p>
    <p>The economy added 193,000 payroll jobs in July, but that
    was less than the 273,000 monthly average increase registered
    in the second quarter of the year and far less than that
    needed to meet the objectives of legislative mandates already
    in place, according to AFL-CIO economist Frank Parente.
    &quot;If the jobless rate had been 4 percent, the goal of the
    Humphrey-Hawkins full employment law, there would have been
    almost 2 million fewer jobless people,&quot; he said. </p>
    <p>&quot;In the 64 months since the end of the last
    recession, the economy has added 11.4 million jobs, compared
    with 15.7 million additional jobs in a similar period
    following the recession of the early 1980s and 13.2 million
    following the recession of the mid- 1970s,&quot; Parente
    said. </p>
    <p>Job growth in July was led by a jump of 89,000 in retail
    trade, the fourth consecutive large gain, while construction
    added 25,000 jobs, and business services, 35,000. But
    manufacturing lost another 20,000 jobs, a total of 282,000
    since its most recent peak in March 1995. Federal employment
    also declined. </p>

    <p align="center"><font size="4">Household gains
    responsibility for union credit card </font></p>
    <p>The Union Privilege MasterCard portfolio now is in the
    hands of Household International. </p>
    <p>Bank of New York (Delaware) turned over the assets Aug.
    19, making Household responsible for all customer service,
    mailing all bills and notices and making credit decisions
    using its own approval criteria. </p>
    <p>Current cardholder notification began Aug. 22, with a
    welcome package to follow in October and quarterly mailings
    beginning in January. </p>
    <p>In an effort to improve on the card, Union Privilege and
    Household plan a series of product tests beginning in
    October, including what types of offers and telemarketing are
    best and how to tailor a card for members with credit
    problems or no credit history. </p>
    <p>Household also is developing a benefit to allow
    cardholders to transfer balances from other, higher-interest
    cards to pay them off at the prime rate. The company also is
    exploring the development of a money-saving
    &quot;rewards&quot; type of program. </p>
    <p>Additionally, Household plans to make available to unions
    its HOMEBASE database to better understand and communicate
    with members and the general public. </p>
    <p>The company has retained the scholarship program, skip
    payment and strike benefits. </p>
    <p>Union Privilege made the switch in administration of its
    card to provide better service for union members and gain the
    payment of royalties to the AFL-CIO and its affiliates. That
    money &thorn; some $300 million in royalties over the first
    five years &thorn; will finance organizing and national
    outreach to benefit the entire labor movement. It will be
    split between the federation and international unions. </p>

    <p>AFL-CIO President John J. Sweeney announced a major round
    of staff appointments during the summer Executive Council
    meeting in Chicago. </p>
    <p>Ron Blackwell, chief economist at UNITE, will head the
    Corporate Affairs Department. Bill Fletcher leaves the
    Service Employees to become director of the Education
    Department and Barbara Shailor, international affairs
    director for the Machinists, will assume the same position at
    the federation. </p>
    <p>Other key appointments in the Corporate Affairs Department
    include David Chu, former research director of SEIU, who will
    become director of strategic research. Nancy Mills, formerly
    of SEIU, will be acting director of the Center for Workplace
    Democracy, and Bill Patterson, corporate affairs specialist
    at the Teamsters, will direct the Center for Worker Ownership
    and Governance. </p>
    <p>Dick Leonard, currently at the Oil Chemical and Atomic
    Workers, will direct strategic campaign field operations as
    an assistant director in the Department of Field
    Mobilization. (See stories, Pages 5-6). </p>
    <p>Elmer Chatak, president of the Industrial Union Department
    since 1992, retired on Aug. 5. IUD's Executive Council
    elected Secretary-Treasurer Peter diCicco to succeed Chatak
    as president and Joseph B. Uehlein, executive assistant to
    the president, as its secretary-treasurer. </p>
    <p>Chatak, whose four-year term was not due to expire until
    November, stepped down early to give the new officers an
    early start with the ongoing department reorganization. He
    began his union career in 1951 when he was hired by Phillip
    Murray as a CIO organizer. After the AFL and CIO merger, he
    was transferred to the Steelworkers District 7 and became the
    district's key organizer. In 1968 he became the first
    director of the USWA's new organizing department. </p>
    <p>DiCicco, who was elected secretary-treasurer in 1992,
    previously served as vice president of the Electronic Workers
    and IUE's New England District. </p>
    <p>Uehlein previously served as IUD's director of Strategic
    Campaigns. He is also president of the Labor Heritage
    Foundation. </p>
    <p>Robert F. Harbrant has retired as president of the
    AFL-CIO's Food and Allied Service Trades Department, a
    position he has held since 1979. He will be succeeded by
    Secretary-Treasurer Jeffrey L. Fiedler on Sept. 1. </p>
    <p>Harbrant served as secretary-treasurer and first executive
    director of FAST as well as executive assistant and assistant
    to the secretary-treasurer in the Union Label and Service
    Trades Department. He will continue working with the Bakery,
    Confectionery and Tobacco Workers. </p>
    <p>Fiedler began his career at FAST as director of corporate
    affairs in 1980 and was appointed secretary-treasurer in
    1990. </p>
    <p>President Clinton celebrated his 50th birthday by blowing
    out his candles on a union-made cake from famed Greenberg
    Bakery in New York City. The employees have been members of
    the Bakery, Confectionery and Tobacco Workers since the shop
    opened in 1946. The huge butter cream-frosted pound cake,
    which was donated to the president by the bakery, took two
    days to prepare. </p>
    <p>AFL-CIO economist Greg Woodhead was elected to the
    executive board of the Industrial Relations Research
    Association for a three- year term, beginning in 1997. The
    IRRA gives professionals interested in all aspects of
    industrial relations and human resources the opportunity to
    share ideas and learn about new developments, issues and
    practices in the field. </p>
    <p>Ken Orsatti, national executive director of the Screen
    Actors Guild, was elected president of the California State
    Theatrical Federation, the entertainment arm of the
    California state federation. Marjo Bernay of the Theatrical
    Stage Employees Local 790 was named vice president, and
    Edward Powell from IATSE was elected secretary-treasurer. </p>
    <p>DEATH </p>
    <p>Lillian Clark, national treasurer of the Television and
    Radio Artists since 1991, died in New York City after
    battling cancer for many months. She was 70. </p>
    <p>Clark was one of the original Ray Charles Singers and also
    appeared on the Perry Como show in the 1950s. She also
    recorded with Count Basie, Ella Fitzgerald, Tommy Dorsey,
    Louis Armstrong, Sammy Davis Jr. and other musical legends. </p>
    <p>She is survived by a son and a brother. </p>

<h3 align="center">Grass-roots mobilization in high gear <br>
Unions not intimidatedby Republican threats <br>
<font size="3"><i>By Michael Byrne and Mike Hall</i></font></h3>
<hr width="80%">
<p>With Republican congressional leaders flailing wildly at
unions in the final days before recess, the AFL-CIO was keeping
the pressure on with advertising on worker issues while preparing
to move into an intensive get-out-the-vote phase of Labor '96. </p>
<p>More than 100 trained coordinators were directing grass-roots
activity in congressional districts across the country, and many
were planning recess activity. They were backed by a new round of
television and radio ads on pension security that will replace or
augment ads showing House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.)
describing Republican plans to let Medicare &quot;wither on the
vine.&quot; </p>
<p>On the ground, the federation's unprecedented member
mobilization campaign already has enlisted 3,000 rank-and-file
unionists to assist the electoral push, with a goal of training
10,000 union members this year. They will be part of the
permanent grass-roots network of at least 100 activists in each
congressional district. </p>
<p>The campaign, subtitled &quot;Building to Win, Building to
Last,&quot; will enable the federation to &quot;support men and
women who will respond to the needs of working families, and then
hold those candidates accountable once they are elected,&quot;
said AFL-CIO President John J. Sweeney. </p>
<p>Thus far, the AFL-CIO campaign to highlight attacks on working
families and publicize those voting records has &quot;hit some
raw nerves,&quot; Sweeney said. &quot;The depths to which they
are going is just unbelievable.&quot; </p>
<p>Through threats of legal action and federal investigations,
Republican leaders have tried to strong-arm television and radio
stations into blocking the federation's issues advertisements,
which have focused on opposition to raising the minimum wage and
efforts to cut Medicare and give tax cuts to the rich. Only a
handful of stations have yielded to the pressure. </p>
<p>The attacks on unions have taken a shrill, almost hysterical
tone. In a scene reminiscent of the 1950s McCarthy-era communist
witch hunt, Republicans on July 24 staged a phony show hearing on
labor, leading in a hooded &quot;secret&quot; witness to testify
behind a screen. </p>
<p>Sweeney called it a &quot;naked political payback for labor's
success in telling it like it is.&quot; </p>
<p>The GOP and its allies in the business community, under the
guise of a Chamber of Commerce &quot;Coalition,&quot; have
launched their own ad campaign attacking the AFL-CIO. </p>
<p>The GOP's massive disinformation campaign also includes an
eight-minute attack video distributed to media outlets;
orchestrated phone bank operations generating negative calls to
state and local AFL-CIOs and a constant barrage of overheated and
hysterical anti-union rhetoric from such party leaders as
Gingrich and House Majority Leader Richard Armey (R-Texas.) </p>
<p>The AFL-CIO has not backed down, turning many Republican
claims on their head while keeping up the drumbeat about how the
Gingrich-led Congress has put workers at risk while rewarding
rich benefactors. The new TV spots highlight votes last year to
allow corporations to spend pension funds, endangering many
workers' retirement security. </p>
<p>The Labor `96 push has had a strong economic focus, following
on the coast-to-coast &quot;America Needs a Raise&quot; town hall
meetings in May and June. That message was explored during July
in 22 &quot;kick- off&quot; events in congressional districts,
which drew as many as 130 rank-and-file workers in many areas.
Participants were asked to turn in pledge cards to volunteer to
join the growing legion of union election workers. </p>
<p>Some 200 district coordinators, union staff and state
federation officers will gather Aug. 9-11 at the Masters, Mates
and Pilots training center to develop state and district
coordinated campaign strategies. That session will effectively
launch the electoral phase of Labor '96, which is several months
and thousands of union volunteers ahead of what the labor
movement has accomplished in past elections. </p>
<p>&quot;We are determined that union members this election will
understand the important issues that affect their economic
security and living standards,&quot; said AFL-CIO Political
Director Steve Rosenthal. &quot;If we do our job, we can reverse
the anti-worker tide of the current Congress and make sure we
have a friend in the White House.&quot; </p>
<p>The federation also held its first-ever &quot;candidates
forum&quot; in Washington, introducing 75 congressional
candidates and campaign managers to AFL-CIO unions and their
fight for working families. They also heard reports from
pollsters on union members' views on crucial issues and from
Karen Nussbaum, director of the AFL-CIO Working Women's
Department, on the importance of women's vote in 1996. </p>
<p>Candidates are listening because the AFL-CIO's message for
working families is resonating across the country. The
federation's Medicare ads were greeted enthusiastically by
labor's allies in Congress, including Minority Whip David Bonior
(D-Mich.), who organized a series of floor speeches by Democrats
defending the ads and lambasting Gingrich. </p>
<p>Embarrassed by the ads, Republicans sought to backpedal,
claiming that Gingrich actually was talking about the obscure
Health Care Finance Administration. </p>
<p>But Gingrich's words are clear. &quot;But we believe it's
going to wither on the vine because we think people are
voluntarily going to leave it - voluntarily,&quot; he said. </p>
<p>&quot;People could not `leave' the financing administration as
they could `leave' the traditional Medicare program,&quot;
AFL-CIO General Counsel Jon Hiatt wrote TV stations, claiming
that the Republican objections were &quot;groundless and
deceptive.&quot; </p>
<p>He also noted that after the Oct. 24, 1995, speech, Gingrich
press aide Tony Blankley confirmed the speaker was talking about
fee-for-service Medicare. </p>
<p>Those ads aired on 176 stations in 33 districts. </p>
<p>The GOP's two-day House &quot;show&quot; trial in front of the
Judiciary's Crime Subcommittee, also left egg on the faces of
organizers. The hearings were designed to attack a 1995 agreement
between the Laborers and the Justice Department to institute
reforms as a &quot;sweetheart&quot; deal, while trying to tie the
union to organized crime. </p>
<p>But a former FBI agent and a Justice Department witness
described how LIUNA is working with the government to effectively
clean its house, and dismissed accusations of favoritism. </p>
<p>Sweeney called the hearings &quot;bogus (and) nothing more
than retaliation for the new voice America's unions are creating
for working families . . . their bully tactics will not fool the
public or deter us from exposing their attacks on working
families.&quot; </p>
<p>The credibility of the GOP's mystery guest witness was
completely destroyed. He testified behind a screen, even though
he previously testified publicly, and his identity is common
knowledge. He also was unmasked as a paid government informant
who had sold information to tabloids. </p>

<h3 align="center">Rail workers get historic agreements <br>
<font size="3"><i>By David Kameras</i></font></h3>
<hr width="80%">
<p>Conrail last week finally relented in its bilateral dispute
with the Maintenance of Way Employees, ending a two-year struggle
to achieve labor agreements between rail labor and the nation's
major freight carriers. </p>
<p>With tentative agreements with 13 unions now in place, the
national rail industry has survived a bargaining process without
strikes or imposed settlements for the first time in at least 30
years. </p>
<p>&quot;BMWE members asked for real wage increases, better
working conditions, increased away-from-home expenses and job
protection,&quot; union President Mac A. Fleming said. &quot;I am
pleased that we were able to deliver on all those goals through
negotiations and without any service disruption.&quot; </p>
<p>The prospect of a disruption was imminent. BMWE had reached
agreement with the 34 other railroads belonging to the National
Carriers Conference Committee, but Conrail stood alone and
intransigent, even after BMWE and the Transportation
Communications Union extended a no-strike pledge for seven days
beyond the July 23 expiration of a 30-day cooling-off period
imposed under the Railway Labor Act. </p>
<p>TCU later settled with all the carriers. The BMWE pact was
reached less than 24 hours before the end of the time extension. </p>
<p>The BMWE conflict stemmed from proposals by a presidential
emergency board regarding &quot;work force stabilization,&quot;
affecting workers who are furloughed or reassigned. Conrail
maintained that its interpretation of the proposals differed from
that of the union's, and it wanted an arbitrator to weigh in, a
move the union called delaying tactics. </p>
<p>Fleming said management's need to accept job security items
and a production-gang definition were in exchange for concessions
already made by labor in negotiations, and declared that his
union would not enter into a national agreement with one carrier
refusing to comply with key provisions. </p>
<p>Five days before the agreement was reached, AFL-CIO President
John J. Sweeney warned that with hundreds of millions of dollars
in profits and top executives getting more than $1 million in
salary, &quot;Conrail's insistence on keeping the cash in the
corporate suites (threatened) to unravel a national agreement for
145,000 rail workers and 34 other railroads.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Nearly a decade ago, Conrail employees helped save the
company from bankruptcy by forgoing benefits that ease the pain
of a layoff - a benefit given to nearly all other rail
workers,&quot; Sweeney said. &quot;Now it's time for the workers
to reap a share of the profits they helped create.&quot; </p>
<p>Fleming thanked the AFL-CIO's leadership, noting that the
federation &quot;stood beside the BMWE in solidarity as we fought
for a strong contract, and made invaluable contributions to
keeping the negotiating process moving forward.&quot; </p>
<p>The ratification process is expected to take several weeks. </p>
<p>The history of contract talks in the rail industry has long
been marked by carrier inflexibility and stalling tactics, as
management has relied on a sympathetic Congress to achieve what
could not be secured at the negotiating table. </p>
<p>In 1991 and 1992, Congress intervened to impose settlements,
stemming from a round of bargaining started in 1988. The AFL-CIO
denounced that government interference in the collective
bargaining process. </p>
<p>Three presidential emergency boards were appointed by
President Clinton in the current round. Sweeney testified before
two of the boards on behalf of rail workers. The tentative
agreements followed recommendations from those boards. </p>

<h3 align="center">Southern bus tour links civil rights, economic
justice <br>
<font size="3"><i>By Muriel H. Cooper</i></font></h3>
<hr width="80%">
<p>Mobile, Ala. </p>
<p>The link between the civil rights movement and the struggle
for economic justice took on a human face for 30 Union Summer
activists who traveled throughout the South helping to organize
nursing home workers, one of the nation's most dangerous and
poorly paid professions. </p>
<p>The three-week Southern bus tour is a part of the AFL-CIO's
Union Summer campaign deploying 1,500 students and young
activists across the country to work in union organizing drives. </p>
<p>Unlike the rest of Union Summer, where activists were assigned
to work in one city, the bus tour is traveling more than 850
miles from July 24 to Aug. 11, beginning in Memphis, Tenn. It was
stopping in Jackson, Miss., and Mobile, Selma, Montgomery and
Birmingham, Ala., before ending up back in Memphis. </p>
<p>The tour is retracing some of the paths taken 30 years ago by
an earlier generation of young activists during Freedom Summer,
which served as the model for Union Summer. </p>
<p>&quot;You are launching a new movement . . . a movement that
connects the struggles of the past for civil rights with the
hopes for a future with economic justice,&quot; Food and
Commercial Workers President Douglas H. Dority told the activists
as they gathered in Memphis at the site of Dr. Martin Luther King
Jr.'s assassination. </p>
<p>Dubbed the &quot;care-a-van,&quot; connecting to the
&quot;Care For The Caregivers&quot; nursing home organizing
campaign by the UFCW, the Union Summer activists got an up-close
and personal view of the realities of organizing nursing home
workers. </p>
<p>Southern nursing home operations are among the lowest-paying
in a low-wage industry. Workers have one of the highest injury
rates, with no health care or pension benefits, giving the
industry the infamous reputation of being the most dangerous in
which to work. </p>
<p>&quot;The workers need justice and fairness. They need a
union,&quot; Linda Chavez-Thompson, executive vice president of
the AFL-CIO, told the students during an intensive training
workshop held in Memphis July 21-23. </p>
<p>&quot;I learned that the conditions are just horrible,&quot;
said Gussie Bowen, an activist from Florida. &quot;You have to be
certified to do the job, but they don't pay you enough money to
feed your family.&quot; </p>
<p>The mission was not one for the weary. By 6 a.m., most of the
activists were up and out of the motel to handbill at nursing
homes, only to return at midday in muggy, 90-degree heat to greet
the second shift. </p>
<p>&quot;You have to let the workers know that they have nothing
to fear,&quot; said Vanessa Scott, one of seven nursing home
workers traveling with the activists. &quot;You have to let them
know that no one will see the authorization card. The card just
says that they are interested in having a union come in. It
doesn't mean you're in the union.&quot; </p>
<p>Deep into the night, the activists - fueled with the emotions
of the day - plotted strategy on how to get around the workers'
all-too-real fear of being identified with a union, tossing out
ideas like so many balls bouncing off a wall: trace workers'
license plates to get addresses and set up home calls; convince
other local unions to help in the organizing; reach out to the
local media; pass out brochures asking the workers questions that
end with the tag line, &quot;if you answered yes, you need a
union.&quot; </p>
<p>They talked with four nursing home workers from Cogburn
nursing home in Mobile, who were fired when they expressed an
interest in organizing. The union lost the election. </p>
<p>&quot;I was mad,&quot; dietary aide Alma Hayward said of the
election. &quot;When we tried to talk about the union, we were
disciplined or fired. But the administrator could talk against
the union as much as he pleased. But we are taking them to court
(on federal labor law violations), and what is done in the dark
will come to light. So, we really didn't lose,&quot; she said. </p>
<p>&quot;Just listening to the workers talk about being fired
from their jobs helped to motivate me to help them get
justice,&quot; said Diallo Brooks from Washington. &quot;My
energy level is high and I get excited about making a difference
in peoples' lives.&quot; </p>
<p>For many of the activists, the trip marked their first time in
the South, a battleground for social change - and the beginning
of a living lesson in the connection between civil rights and
economic justice. </p>
<p>Under the hotel balcony where Martin Luther King died, they
heard the Rev. Jesse L. Jackson explain how King saw the fight by
Memphis garbagemen to gain respect by joining AFSCME as the next
logical step in the civil rights movement. </p>
<p>They heard mostly female African-American workers from the
Delta Pride catfish processing plant in Indianola, Miss., explain
the hardships and triumphs of the successful union organizing
drives at three of the company's plants. </p>
<p>They walked in front of the Greenwood, Miss., grocery store
where black teen-ager Emmett Till stood and was later killed for
allegedly whistling at a white woman in 1955. </p>
<p>They listened as Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.) described how he
survived a 1965 police riot at Selma's Edmund Pettus Bridge,
where marchers were beaten and firehosed for seeking the right to
vote. And they reflected on King's poignant message of commitment
to justice in his letters from the Birmingham jail. </p>
<p>&quot;We are showing that my generation cares,&quot; said
Allen Bozeman from Prattville, Ala. &quot;We are doing something
good. We want to contribute to our communities. We may not
accomplish everything, but we did stand up for caregivers,&quot;
he said. </p>

<h3 align="center">Unions reach out to women <br>
Organizing, leadershiptop department goals <br>
<font size="3"><i>By Sharolyn A. Rosier</i></font></h3>
<hr width="80%">
<p>The AFL-CIO's fledgling Working Women's Department is up and
running full throttle in its mission to represent women and make
their concerns a part of labor's agenda. </p>
<p>&quot;The department will be injecting concerns of working
women into every nook and cranny of the labor movement,&quot;
said Karen Nussbaum, the department's director. &quot;It's a very
big mandate, but it's what we need to do. We will make sure that
every major program and all departments do their work keeping
working women in mind.&quot; </p>
<p>Organizing is a key priority of the department, said AFL-CIO
Vice President Gloria Johnson, who was named by President John J.
Sweeney to chair the Executive Council's Working Women's
Committee. </p>
<p>Women currently comprise almost 40 percent of total union
membership and are more than 60 percent of all service workers,
the fastest-growing segment of new members. Studies show they
also are more likely to join a union than men. </p>
<p>&quot;We have made strides, but the majority of working women
still don't belong to unions. Only about 16 percent of all
working women belong to unions,&quot; said Johnson, who is
president of the Coalition of Labor Union Women and vice
president of the Electronic Workers. </p>
<p>&quot;Unions have a moral responsibility to working
women,&quot; Sweeney told the Institute for Women's Policy
Research. &quot;Because working women are desperately squeezed
for time and money, they are urgently in need of union
representation.&quot; </p>
<p>Representation of working women is very important for unions
when one considers the numbers. The U.S. Census Bureau projects
the number of male workers will increase by only 8 percent by
2005, while the number of female workers will increase 17
percent. These numbers are strikingly important to every aspect
of unions' existence - organizing, political action and
legislation, Nussbaum said. </p>
<h4>The union advantage</h4>
<p>No matter what color collar they wore, women who testified at
the federation's &quot;America Needs A Raise&quot; town hall
meetings said they experienced similar hardships in the workplace
- sexism, low wages, temporary employment, sexual harassment and
unequal pay. </p>
<p>But union women often stated in the meetings that they
benefited from having a union contract and the support of their
union when they faced these problems. </p>
<p>The union advantage extends also to pay. Female union members
earn 38 percent more than their nonunion counterparts - and the
advantage is even greater for women of color. In 1995, union
African-American women earned an average of $473 weekly, compared
with $325 for nonunion African-American women. Latino women
represented by unions had median weekly earnings of $423,
compared with $291 for nonunion Hispanic women. </p>
<p>Unions also narrow the wage gap between women and men from 32
percent for nonunion women to 25 percent for union women,
according to the Institute for Women's Policy Research. </p>
<p>&quot;We've worked hard to reduce it and we're proud of the
progress we've made so far, but we're not going to rest until the
gap disappears,&quot; said AFL-CIO Executive Vice President Linda
Chavez-Thompson. </p>
<h4>Female leaders needed</h4>
<p>Another sign of progress is a growing representation of women
in top union leadership positions. In 1979, when women made up 30
percent of the labor movement, there were no women on the AFL-CIO
Executive Council and no female department directors or executive
staff members. The next year, Joyce Miller of the Clothing and
Textile Workers, now UNITE, became a member of the Executive
Council and Dorothy Shields was named Education Director. </p>
<p>It took 40 years before the federation had its first female
executive officer, Barbara Easterling of the Communications
Workers, who served as secretary-treasurer for two months in
1995. </p>
<p>The 1995 AFL-CIO convention brought significant progress for
women, including additional seats on the Executive Council.
Today, in addition to Chavez-Thompson, there are six women on the
council and nine female directors of AFL-CIO departments. </p>
<p>But the hard fact is that the movement is not nearly where it
should be, Chavez-Thompson declared. &quot;The challenge to
unions is three-fold - transform the culture of unions, recruit
more women leaders and establish more networks and relationships
of union women helping union women.&quot; </p>
<p>Changing the culture in unions to provide more of those role
models will be difficult, Chavez-Thompson said. &quot;For
example, many of my union brothers in the San Antonio Public
Employees Council assumed I was the boss's secretary, even after
I was business manager and ultimately executive director of the
local unions.&quot; </p>
<p>More attention also has to be paid to developing and training
new and young female workers, Johnson said. &quot;We must help
them understand it's more than paying dues, negotiating a
contract and job security. It's an opportunity to stand with
people in a common cause . . . and an opportunity to get
involved. The local is only as strong as their involvement.&quot; </p>
<p>The department's other priorities include politics and
outreach to all women, union and nonunion. &quot;We are the
biggest organization for women, and we intend to act like we
are,&quot; Nussbaum said. That is particularly important this
year, when &quot;it will be working women's votes that determine
the next election,&quot; she said. </p>
<p>The department also is putting together a network for women,
which all union members are welcome to join, and will be issuing
a quarterly newsletter and establishing a resource clearinghouse. </p>

<h3 align="center">Workers stop Oregon `right to work' <br>
<font size="3"><i>By Sharolyn A. Rosier</i></font></h3>
<hr width="80%">
<p>Workers in Oregon thwarted a petition drive to place a public
employee right-to-work measure on the November ballot. </p>
<p>Oregon Taxpayers United, headed by the anti-union lobbyist
Bill Sizemore, filed more than 108,000 signatures, but only
86,000 were validated July 18 by the state's secretary of state -
not enough to qualify for the ballot. The announcement &quot;was
a great moment for our campaign to block that,&quot; said David
Gregory, the AFL-CIO regional director. </p>
<p>The ballot initiative would have prohibited the mandatory
payment of union dues by public employees and banned the
government from deducting union dues from employees' pay checks. </p>
<p>&quot;Even with their purported budget of $672,000, Sizemore
and his millionaire backers were unable to buy their way onto the
ballot,&quot; Oregon AFL-CIO President Irv Fletcher said in a
statement. &quot;The Oregon public was able to see past the empty
rhetoric and reject this attempt to tinker with the state
constitution.&quot; </p>
<p>Sizemore's group also led the 1994 ballot initiative that
required public employees to pay part of their pension. An
appellate court overturned that measure last month. Sizemore said
he would try again in 1998 to get the &quot;right-to-work&quot;
measure on the ballot. </p>
<p>Gregory credited union solidarity with defeating the
initiative, including early planning and funding by the state
AFL- CIO, which raised per capita at its convention, as well as
assistance from the national AFL-CIO beginning early this year. </p>
<p>Over the past few months, the AFL-CIO dispatched five
additional staff members to assist in the campaign. </p>
<p>During one campaign activity - a July 2 rally at the state
Capitol - more than 100 public employee union members brought the
message home to legislators that Sizemore did not speak for them. </p>
<p>Oregon is among 29 &quot;fair share&quot; states that require
dues payments by employees who work in a union shop - whether
they join the union or not. The law is designed to prevent
&quot;free-riders,&quot; workers who benefit from union
bargaining but do not pay dues. </p>
<p>&quot;The message is clear,&quot; said Oregon Public Employees
Union/SEIU Local 503 President Karla Spence. &quot;Voters are fed
up with Bill Sizemore's attacks on working Oregonians. The
right-to- work initiative he circulated would have hurt more than
public workers - it would have hurt families and communities
throughout the state.&quot; </p>
<p>OPEU represents more than 22,000 public employees, and AFSCME
represents 17,500 public employees in the state. </p>

<h3 align="center">Lights on at Sylvania <br>
</h3>
<hr width="80%">
<p>The Electronic Workers were able to break a 40-year union
drought when workers at the Osram Sylvania facility in St. Marys,
Pa., voted 251-227 for IUE representation. </p>
<p>The workers decided they'd had enough of the company's
shenanigans after Sylvania tried to implement continuous shifts
and permanently laid off 100 workers, sending their jobs to
Mexico. </p>
<p>The union effort was pushed by defunct Local 291 workers who
worked in Sylvania's Salem, Mass., plant until about four years
ago, when the company closed the plant to consolidate with the
St. Marys facility. </p>
<p>IUE used more than 50 radio commercials and a full-page
newspaper ad explaining what was at stake for the workers and the
community. The victory is being pegged as one of the biggest for
the union in recent years. </p>
<h4>IUE rolls the bumpers on</h4>
<p>American Roll Form and Manufacturing Co. in Angola, Ind.,
granted IUE recognition for 206 workers after 124 signed
authorization cards. </p>
<p>Another 77 probationary workers will be part of the unit when
they become permanently employed. The workers make auto bumpers. </p>
<h4>SEIU scores seven times</h4>
<p>The Service Employees scored seven organizing wins in the past
few weeks, gaining about 575 new members. </p>
<p>Three of the wins came in health care facilities. SEIU Local 4
won an election July 11 to represent 85 workers at the St. Paul
nursing home in Chicago. Local 79 won a July 12 election for a
unit of 80 nursing home workers at Friendship Manor in Detroit. </p>
<p>Local 250 survived a vicious anti-union campaign to win a unit
of non-professionals at Catholic Healthcare West's St. Joseph's
Behavioral Health Center in Stockton, Calif., by a 39-20 margin. </p>
<p>In Chicago, Local 236 signed a contract with a new employer,
Argenbright International Services, covering 250 workers at
O'Hare International Airport. Two Chicago janitorial units at CHA
properties also voted for SEIU by 26-0 and 18-2 votes. </p>
<p>And in Orlando, Fla., SEIU Local 750 won the right to
represent workers at National Car Rental on a 38-18 vote. </p>
<h4>Union wins at Red Cross</h4>
<p>Red Cross nurses, professionals and technicians at the South
Jersey-Penn Region of American Red Cross Blood Services will be
represented by AFT's Hospital Professionals and Allied Employees
(HPAE). </p>
<p>The unit will include two bargaining units of 300 employees,
who voted by a 4-1 margin for the union. </p>
<p>&quot;We fought for our right to be union because we wanted
fairness and consistent standards,&quot; said Laura Power, a
donor collector with the Red Cross. &quot;We intend to use our
voice on behalf of employees and the blood donors and patients we
serve.&quot; </p>
<p>The victory represents a growing trend at Red Cross Blood
Services around the country, where 2,000 of the 14,000 workers
are now unionized. </p>
<h4>UMWA is workers' answer</h4>
<p>Workers at the Long Airdox mining equipment plant in
Saltville, Va., wanted security and respect - so they voted 49-20
for Mine Workers representation. </p>
<p>&quot;They refused to be intimidated by management's threats
and illegal discharge of a union supporter,&quot; said UMWA
President Cecil E. Roberts. &quot;And they saw through the
company's false promises and its illegal 11th-hour pay
increases.&quot; </p>
<p>The Saltville plant is the third plant to vote for the union
among the six plants owned by Long Airdox. More than 200 workers
are represented by the UMWA at the company's Cedar Bluff, Va.,
facility, and workers at the Pulaski, Va., facility long have
been represented by the Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers. </p>
<h4>UFCW has the beef</h4>
<p>After a long struggle, Food and Commercial Workers Local 22
was recognized at Monfort Inc.'s Grand Island, Neb., beef plant.
The agreement, announced July 22, was worked out by the NLRB and
resolves all outstanding unfair labor practices complaints
involving the plant. </p>
<p>&quot;This is a tremendous first step for the workers,&quot;
said Local 22 President Rick Sallfeld. &quot;We look forward to
negotiations with the company and building a positive working
relationship.&quot; Contract negotiations are set to begin August
5. </p>
<p>Monfort, based in Greeley, Colo., employs more than 10,000
people at four major beef processing plants. </p>

<h3 align="center">Strawberry fields forever tough <br>
<font size="3"><i>By Sharolyn A. Rosier</i></font></h3>
<hr width="80%">
<p>Life is hard for strawberry pickers, who labor 10- to 12-hour
work days in California's million-dollar strawberry industry,
with exposure to pesticides the order every day. </p>
<p>But there is hope in a union. The Farm Workers have taken on
the entire industry to bring the social and economic justice of a
union contract to every worker in the fields. The campaign that
began last April intensified with pledges from almost 200 AFL-CIO
central labor councils during last month's national CLC
conference to give their time and resources. (See story, Page 5). </p>
<p>Union Summer activists also are assisting the UFW. </p>
<p>&quot;Until the organizing began this year, there had not been
a wage increase in 10 years,&quot; said UFW President Arturo
Rodriguez at the CLC conference. &quot;Pay is among the lowest in
agriculture - often below the minimum wage - and most workers
have no benefits.&quot; </p>
<p>Fighting back tears, 18-year-old Griselda Ruiz held her
daughter as she explained how she was forced to work in the rain,
and many times through lunch. &quot;With the campaign, we've seen
some changes, because they are trying to look good,&quot; she
added, &quot;but I was fired for wearing a union button.&quot; </p>
<p>Some 20,000 men, women and children work in California's
strawberry fields for an average wage of $8,000 per year. </p>
<p>On such paltry salaries, the workers are forced to share small
apartments with three or four families, according to the union.
Other workers live in caves, shacks and old cars. </p>
<p>Eighty percent of the strawberries consumed in the United
States and Canada are grown in California, where the state's
Central Coast boasts 65 percent of the total strawberry crop
value. The season lasts from March to October. </p>
<p>Some growers already are retaliating against the union. Last
June, anti-union workers assaulted two union organizers after
they visited workers at Gargiulo Farms in Watsonville. Within
hours of the incident, more than 100 farm workers and supporters
gathered outside the grower's office to protest the company's
anti-union violence and intimidation. </p>
<p>But the power rests with the &quot;coolers,&quot; who exert
great control over the more than 270 growers. </p>
<p>Coolers provide growers with loans and plants from their
nurseries, set the price and package and market growers' crops,
according to the UFW. </p>
<p>&quot;Our strategy is to organize the entire strawberry
industry t instead of one grower at a time,&quot; Rodriguez
explained. &quot;That means getting the coolers to cooperate by
pressuring growers to do the right thing.&quot; </p>

<h3 align="center">Veto kills company union bill <br>
Minimum wage, health bills to be signed into law <br>
<font size="3"><i>By Mike Hall</i></font></h3>
<hr width="80%">
<p>Delivering on his promised veto, President Clinton sent the
misnamed TEAM Act to the sidelines July 30. The company union
bill had been high on the Republican leadership's business
agenda. </p>
<p>Two other major victories for labor were assured when Congress
settled differences between House and Senate versions of a long-
overdue minimum wage increase and a health insurance portability
bill. Clinton will sign both measures. </p>
<p>The AFL-CIO-led drive to give America's lowest-paid workers
their first raise in seven years will boost the minimum wage from
$4.25 per hour to $5.15 in two 45-cent steps, Oct. 1, 1996, and
Oct. 1, 1997. </p>
<p>The House and Senate also put finishing touches on welfare
reform legislation opposed by the AFL-CIO. Clinton said he would
sign the bill. </p>
<p>AFL-CIO President John J. Sweeney commended Clinton for his
veto of the TEAM Act, a &quot;damaging and unnecessary piece of
legislation (that) would have given management the say-so over
who speaks for workers on issues such as wages, hours and other
terms and conditions of employment.&quot; </p>
<p>In his veto message, Clinton noted the bill would have allowed
&quot;employers to establish company unions where no union
currently exists and permitted company-dominated unions where
employees are in the process of determining whether to be
represented by a union.&quot; </p>
<p>Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) said the measure was unneeded
because 30,000 employers already have established worker teams,
and the National Labor Relations Board rarely objects to these
arrangements. </p>
<p>The bill passed the Senate July 10 by a margin of 53-46. The
House passed it 221-202 last September. Neither margin approaches
the two-thirds needed in each house to override a presidential
veto. </p>
<p>Labor's fight against the TEAM Act in the Senate was two-
pronged, with rank-and-file members rallying back home and
calling their representatives on the AFL-CIO's toll-free
congressional hotline, and with the federation's top officers and
affiliated union presidents scouring the Senate hallways to lobby
against the bill. </p>
<p>At the same time, several large business groups staked their
legislative success or failure on the TEAM Act, but never were
able to gather enough support to come close to veto-proofing the
company union bill. </p>
<p>Earlier this session, political observers gave the minimum
wage increase almost no chance of passage in a Republican-
controlled Congress where some party leaders not only vowed to
halt an increase but even said the minimum wage should be
abolished altogether. </p>
<p>But the AFL-CIO, along with a coalition of progressive
organizations, began to drum up massive public support through
media campaigns and public events. A series of 29 America Needs A
Raise town hall meetings nationwide dramatized the growing wage
gap between the rich and the rest of us, as well as obscene
executive salaries and soaring corporate profits in a time of
layoffs, downsizing and plant shifting. </p>
<p>The health insurance reform bill makes it easier for workers
to carry their insurance from job to job and harder for insurance
companies to deny coverage for pre-existing conditions, among
other reforms. While a good first step, labor will continue to
fight for major health care reform. </p>
<p>In the welfare battle, despite some improvements in the bill
made in conference, the AFL-CIO urged Clinton to veto the
measure. The legislation would end a 61-year-old federal
guarantee of cash assistance for families and children by giving
annual block grants to states that will set their own rules and
regulations for welfare. </p>
<p>The conference did strengthen provisions protecting current
and laid-off workers from replacement by welfare recipients, who
now will be required to work under the bill's workfare provision.
But it does not require a minimum wage or benefit floor, and that
greatly intensifies competition in the low-wage labor market. </p>

<h3 align="center">Capitol Digest <br>
<font size="3"><i>By Mike Hall</i></font></h3>
<hr width="80%">
<p>The House continued the attack on the 40-hour work week July
30 when it passed a bill allowing employers to replace overtime
pay with compensatory time. </p>
<p>But the measure (H.R. 2391) faces a Senate fight, and the
Department of Labor has recommended that President Clinton veto
it. </p>
<p>Like many Republican initiatives, the bill carries a
deceptive, worker-friendly title, &quot;The Working Families
Flexibility Act.&quot; </p>
<p>The bill &quot;will not give workers increased control over
their lives. It will give them a reduced paycheck and standard of
living for their families,&quot; AFL-CIO Legislative Director
Peggy Taylor said. </p>
<p>A recent Peter Hart poll showed that workers, by a 64-22
percent margin, prefer overtime pay to comp time. Backers of the
bill tried to paint it as a voluntary arrangement between the
boss and workers, but most of the control is in the hands of the
employers. </p>
<p>The so-called worker protections in the bill are &quot;weak
and virtually meaningless,&quot; Taylor said. &quot;The concept
of a `voluntary arrangement' in most workplaces is a cruel hoax.
If the employer wants to `pay' for overtime work in compensatory
time, not cash, the employer will find a way to exert his
considerable influence over the workers to accept that
arrangement.&quot; </p>
<p>Proponents of the legislation claim it would give workers a
chance to use their comp time for various family functions and
other needs at the workers' discretion. But the bill essentially
gives the boss veto power over the workers' use of earned comp
time. </p>
<p>The bill now goes to the Senate. </p>
<h4>Elsewhere in Congress:</h4>
<p>CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM - What do you call a bill that lets
rich fat cats give even more big political donations, halves what
worker-financed political action committees can give and attacks
unions, too? If you're Newt Gingrich, you call it &quot;campaign
finance reform.&quot; But this bill was so out-rageously weighted
to the wealthy it fell 259-162. It also would have imposed a
bureaucratic nightmare of regulations on unions' political
activity. </p>
<p>DAVIS-BACON - The Senate was expected to turn back what one
labor lobbyist called one of the &quot;most venal and
mean-spirited&quot; amendments he had seen - a move to suspend
the Davis-Bacon Act for reconstruction of the Oklahoma City
federal building. On April 19, 1995, an explosion there killed
168 workers, and in the hours, days and weeks following, building
and construction trade workers toiled tirelessly and sometimes
voluntarily to save survivors, remove victims and stabilize the
destroyed building. Oklahoma BCTD Secretary Jimmy Fish called the
move &quot;a slap in the face to the hundreds of skilled
construction men and women who worked so admirably in the
aftermath of the blast.&quot; </p>
<p>MANDATES - A move that could have undermined such basic labor
laws as the Fair Labor Standards Act, the Occupational Safety and
Health Act, the Davis-Bacon Act and the Family and Medical Leave
Act, along with core environmental laws, was defeated July 23.
The federal Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations
voted down its own final report on so-called unfunded mandates,
thanks to pressure from organized labor, the environmental
community and the Clinton administration. The ACIR had been
charged with reporting recommendations under unfunded mandate
legislation passed in 1995. A White House letter outlining
objections to the report said it ignored &quot;the views of
working men and women who benefit from these laws.&quot; </p>
<p>PESTICIDES - A fight started with a 1989 AFL-CIO lawsuit to
ban the use on fresh foods of pesticides suspected of causing
cancer is coming to a successful end. Already, such agents are
banned from processed foods, but a House-passed bill would apply
uniform standards to fresh and processed foods. It also creates
higher standards for certain foods and chemicals that affect
children and calls for screening for chemicals that raise the
risk of breast cancer. </p>

<h3 align="center">Teens limited on machines <br>

<hr width="80%">
<p>The Senate has approved a narrowly worded measure to allow
teen-agers to load cardboard paper balers in retail
establishments meeting certain industry standards. </p>
<p>The House passed a similar measure last October. While 16- and
17-year-old workers will be allowed to load the machines, they
may not operate or unload them. In addition, the Senate measure
calls for stepped-up reporting of accidents involving teens and
the machines, with Congress retaining the ability to modify the
law if injuries increase. </p>
<h4>Lockout/tagout challenge</h4>
<p>A federal appeals court has ruled that a warning of machine
start-up invalidates OSHA's lockout/tagout rule regarding
&quot;unexpected&quot; activation. </p>
<p>The 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed a decision by
the Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission vacating
citations against General Motors Corp., rejecting the Department
of Labor's interpretation that &quot;unexpected&quot; meant
&quot;unanticipated&quot; or &quot;unplanned for.&quot; The court
said &quot;unexpected&quot; contained an element of surprise that
would be lacking if a worker had advance notice of start-up. </p>
<p>OSHA may appeal the ruling or might have to reissue the rule
to change its wording to conform with the court's language. </p>
<p>Michael Wright, director of health and safety for the
Steelworkers, said of the ruling that reliance on warning signals
eliminates the necessary margin of safety for workers, citing as
an example the possibility of alarm failure or a worker's
inability to hear an alarm because of a noisy workplace. </p>
<h4>Silica dangers targeted</h4>
<p>OSHA announced plans for a nationwide effort to begin this
month to protect workers from exposure to crystalline silica dust
through stepped-up training, education and outreach programs. </p>
<p>The special emphasis program - a collaboration of labor,
government and business - seeks to aid workers in maritime,
agriculture, construction and general industry. Workers
performing sandblasting, drilling or tunneling are especially at
risk. </p>
<p>Nearly 14,000 deaths were attributed to exposure to the dust
from 1958 to 1990, while 300 more people die each year from
silicosis. Inhaling silica dust also has been associated with
other diseases, such as tuberculosis and lung cancer. The
National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health estimates
some 2 million workers are exposed annually. </p>
<h4>Lead violator fined</h4>
<p>A Michigan demolition contractor faces a $742,000 fine for
numerous alleged willful and serious violations of OSHA
regulations protecting construction workers against overexposure
to lead. </p>
<p>The exposures occurred during demolition at a Trinidad, Texas,
power plant last fall, when 25 of 30 workers were found to have
blood lead levels above the OSHA threshold for medical attention.
Eight of those 30 had levels requiring removal from the work
site; one required extensive treatment. </p>
<h4>Crackdown on egg farm</h4>
<p>DeCoster Egg Farms faces $3.6 million in proposed penalties
levied by the U.S. Department of Labor for safety and health
violations - and criminal charges are being considered. </p>
<p>DeCoster employs 800 workers in three states. </p>
<p>Secretary of Labor Robert B. Reich said the company operates
an &quot;unsanitary and dangerous workplace,&quot; provides
&quot;inhumane living quarters&quot; of cramped trailers and
treats workers deplorably - as in the case of a worker who
severed several fingers and was forced to wait hours for medical
aid. </p>
<p>OSHA cited unguarded machinery, violations of housing
requirements for temporary labor camps, exposed electrical parts
and ungrounded equipment, overexposure to air contaminants,
failure to provide protective equipment, noise overexposure, lack
of medical care and lack of hazard communication training. </p>

<h3 align="center">Ergonomic work is spared cuts <br>
Ban lifted on protectionsagainst workplace crippler <br>
<font size="3"><i>By Colleen M. O'Neill</i></font></h3>
<hr width="80%">
<p>Working families scored another big safety and health victory
when the House voted to repeal a ban on the development of a
standard addressing repetitive stress injuries. </p>
<p>By a 216-205 vote, the House July 11 deleted language that
denied the Occupational Safety and Health Administration the
ability to develop an ergonomics standard - or, indeed to even
gather information on ergonomic-related hazards. </p>
<p>Workers and their allies pushed hard on Capitol Hill to get
the language removed from the Labor/Education/Health and Human
Services appropriations measure, and were rewarded for their
efforts when 35 Republicans joined 180 Democrats and one
independent in voting against the provision. </p>
<p>&quot;We were surprised at the vote, given the history on this
issue,&quot; said Peg Seminario, the federation's job safety and
health director, &quot;but there's been a swing of opinion away
from the extreme Republican proposals they've been putting
forward in the past.&quot; </p>
<p>Simply put, ergonomics considers the fit of the job to the
anatomy of the worker. Hazards include repetitive motion, awkward
positions and heavy and awkward lifting. With poor job design or
poorly designed equipment, the increased stress on workers'
bodies often leads to injury. </p>
<p>Workers know too well the toll of jobsite ergonomic hazards.
Over the past decade, the numbers and rates of disorders
associated with repeated trauma have increased by epidemic
proportions - more than 800 percent. In fact, in 1994, more than
705,000 workers suffered serious injuries related to ergonomic
hazards. </p>
<p>Workers at highest risk for injury and illness labor in meat
processing plants, nursing homes and hospitals, at keyboards, on
assembly lines and in grocery stores. </p>
<p>The economic costs of these disorders are huge, with workers'
compensation and other related costs associated with the
crippling injuries estimated at more than $20 billion a year. </p>
<p>For example, workers with carpal tunnel syndrome lose a median
of 30 days of work annually, compared with a median of five days
lost for all injuries. By comparison, amputations - well
recognized as serious injuries - result in an average of 24 days
away from work. </p>
<p>GOP Rep. Henry Bonilla of Texas championed the restrictive
language, employing an ostrich-like approach to the sprains,
strains and crippling effects of RSI suffered by thousands of
workers. His measure took the approach that if an injury is not
reported, it didn't happen - so if you ban the reporting of
injuries, they don't exist, and therefore no standard is required
to deal with them. </p>
<p>Bonilla blamed &quot;the strong arm of labor&quot; for his
provision's defeat, and Republicans vowed to bring the measure up
again. </p>
<p>Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) led the effort against Bonilla's
amendment. </p>
<p>&quot;I want to thank the 216 members of Congress who put the
health and safety of American workers ahead of partisan
politics,&quot; said Secretary of Labor Robert B. Reich. &quot;If
injuries are occurring in the workplace, it's up to the Labor
Department to find a way to prevent them. That's our job.&quot; </p>
<p>Even while workers rejoiced at turning back the ergonomic
language, there was a downside to the appropriations measure. </p>
<p>Funding was cut for OSHA and Mine Safety and Health
Administration programs, specifically in enforcement. The House
bill also failed to provide funds for important mine safety and
health research activities signed over to the National Institute
for Occupational Safety and Health with the demise last year of
the Bureau of Mines. </p>
<p>In addition, the House approved an amendment banning the use
of any Social Security or Medicare Trust Fund money to pay Social
Security Administration workers who perform legitimate union
activities during work hours. These workers, somewhat like shop
stewards, comprise less than 0.3 percent of the SSA's work force,
and have been performing these &quot;official time&quot; duties
for decades. </p>
<p>When the bill goes to the Senate in September, activists
should contact their senators (1/800-LABOR21) to urge them to
oppose restrictive ergonomic language, restore funding to federal
job safety agencies and programs and remove the SSA provision. </p>

<h3 align="center">IBEW: Utility deregulation would shock <br>
<font size="3"><i>By David Kameras</i></font></h3>
<hr width="80%">
<p>Federal legislation introduced by a Colorado congressman to
impose restructuring and deregulation on electric utilities would
threaten American jobs and communities, the Electrical Workers
say. </p>
<p>&quot;Proponents of this bill are using words like `choice,'
`cost savings' or `elimination of restrictions' in describing its
provisions,&quot; said IBEW President John J. Barry. &quot;We
believe that, despite the good intentions of some of its backers,
the bill as it stands would cause chaos and disruption in an
industry already undergoing massive changes. </p>
<p>&quot;The hard fact of the matter is that every American has a
stake in the outcome of this issue,&quot; he said.
&quot;Electricity is vital to the security and the very
functioning of our country. We believe that all members of
Congress and indeed every concerned citizen must engage in a full
and vigorous debate before anything affecting such a vital
service is adopted.&quot; </p>
<p>The measure was put forth by Rep. Dan Schaefer (R-Colo.). </p>
<p>Barry charged that House members, led by Speaker Newt Gingrich
(R-Ga.), are claiming benefits based on &quot;the rosy but
erroneous findings&quot; of a report issued by Citizens for a
Sound Economy. </p>
<p>Although the 1992 Energy Policy Act already has opened up the
industry to deregulation, new measures like Schaefer's seek to
usurp the right of the states to set the pace in introducing
competition through their own regulatory authorities. </p>
<p>&quot;Should Washington solve a problem that doesn't
exist?&quot; asked an IBEW position paper that notes: </p>
<ul>
    <li>Threatened retail competition or direct access has caused
        utility companies to bolster stock prices by slashing
        their work forces, negatively affecting the lives of
        thousands of workers and their communities. </li>
    <li>Job loss places a great strain on the reliability of the
        electric utility system and threatens yet another source
        of decent, fairly compensated jobs in the United States. </li>
    <li>A scaled-back work force negatively affects the safety
        and reliability of an electric system that has been the
        world's best and most affordable to all consumers. </li>
    <li>Small businesses and individual consumers will be in a
        much weaker position to obtain lower rates if
        mega-companies dominate a region's power supply, provide
        deep discount rates to energy- intensive industrial
        customers and shift costs to remaining consumers. </li>
    <li>Most legislative proposals seek a direct connection
        between power production and delivery costs and consumer
        rates, which is largely irrelevant to real costs and
        benefits and would shift costs to small businesses and
        individual consumers. </li>
</ul>
<p>&quot;The need for further radical federal restructuring of
the electric utility industry is simply not there,&quot; said
Barry. &quot;We will do all in our power to convince Congress
that oversight of the nation's power supply rightly belongs
intrastate, a system that has worked well for everyone in our
society for decades.&quot; </p>
<p>Barry told his union's utility conference in January of
efforts in various states to roll back regulation, much of it
prompted by the momentum gathering steam at the federal level,
and the struggle of locals to hold the line. </p>
<p>&quot;The trend in utilities towards mergers, job cutting and
hard- line bargaining is worldwide,&quot; he said. &quot;The
proponents of the free market, whose consciences are untroubled
by such `annoyances' as job security, community well-being or
social concerns, have turned their attention to utilities. </p>
<p>&quot;We must face up to the forces on the right wing that
want to promote rapid and irresponsible change in the utility
industry,&quot; Barry declared. &quot;They are attempting nothing
less than to destabilize the industry for their own gain.&quot; </p>

<h3 align="center">Energized central labor councils explore new
roles <br>
<font size="3"><i>By Sharolyn A. Rosier</i></font></h3>
<hr width="80%">
<p>Denver </p>
<p>Walking the walk and talking the talk, 175 central labor
council officers attending the first national CLC conference took
to the streets to rally for justice in the community. </p>
<p>An impromptu group began singing the song of labor as well,
giving voice to &quot;Rise Again,&quot; &quot;Solidarity
Forever&quot; and other worker standards as the officers took
Denver by storm. They shared ideas and recommendations on how
they could take that creative energy and become the bedrock of
labor's efforts to rise again. </p>
<p>The CLC officers took immediate action on strategic campaigns
by participating in a July 12 rally in support of striking
Detroit News and Free Press newspaper workers. More than 300
people t including CLC officers, union members and federation
staff t rallied in front of Gannett-owned KUSA Channel 9 on the
day before the strike's one-year anniversary. </p>
<p>Chanting as they entered the lobby, their noise deafened the
panic-stricken station executives, who called the police and
reported a &quot;riot.&quot; Following an exhortation by Farm
Workers President Arturo S. Rodriguez, the demonstrators engaged
in informational picketing (See story, Page 8). </p>
<p>Back at the conference, the CLC officers also rose to the
occasion when Rodriguez and two UFW members who were fired for
union activity gave striking accounts of the slave-like
conditions of the California strawberry fields. (See story, Page
2). </p>
<p>The conferees donated their own money to the campaign and in
turn pledged their councils to donate time and resources to the
campaign. After working sessions on CLC support for the
strawberry campaign, the officers also agreed to organize two
national days of action in support of the workers and offered
numerous recommendations for the campaign. </p>
<p>Other working sessions focused on the role of the CLC,
building membership participation and encouraging legislative and
political action. Dialogue during working sessions and question-
and-answer periods showed that CLCs are indeed rising again. </p>
<p>Amy Dean, business manager of the South Bay Labor Council in
San Jose, Calif., said her council has established a nonprofit
organization called Working Partnerships USA and a campaign
management institute. </p>
<p>&quot;Community as well as labor leaders need to be at the
table as we formulate and fight for all working people,&quot;
Dean explained. &quot;The labor council set up WPUSA to
institutionalize this crucial relationship and to provide a
vehicle to reach the widest possible constituency.&quot; </p>
<p>In less than a year, WPUSA has become a player in the regional
debate over economic development policy, persuading the County
Board of Supervisors to approve tax abatement guidelines that
protect the rights of working people and taxpayers and provide a
guaranteed number of good-paying jobs. </p>
<p>Other councils, including the Omaha (Neb.) Federation of
Labor, have formed nonprofit organizations. President Terry Moore
agreed that such groups expand labor's organizational and
political clout in the community. </p>
<p>The AFL-CIO Department of Field Mobilization sponsored the
conference to forge just such innovation. </p>
<p>&quot;There's no one more vital to the labor movement than you
are t no one,&quot; AFL-CIO Executive Vice President Linda
Chavez-Thompson told the CLC officers. &quot;For our movement to
succeed, it needs for you to succeed.&quot; </p>
<p>Although the labor movement is in a time of colossal
challenges, Chavez-Thompson said, those challenges also provide a
window of opportunity - a chance to help set the agenda for the
nation. </p>
<p>&quot;But a larger movement is needed,&quot; she stressed.
&quot;That's why we're aiming to create a culture of organizing
throughout the union movement . . . and CLCs can and will be the
center of that culture.&quot; </p>
<p>Several CLC officers reminded Chavez-Thompson, who oversees
state and local AFL-CIO activities, and AFL-CIO President John J.
Sweeney, that building these extensive organizing and political
programs at the local level are limited by low levels of local
union affiliation and a lack of resources. </p>
<p>Sweeney promised the officers the AFL-CIO would &quot;work
harder, spend more money and campaign smarter than we ever have
before.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;But the bulk of the resources for reorganizing the
American work force and rebuilding the American labor movement
must come from international and local unions,&quot; he
explained, &quot;while the coordination and community support for
such efforts must come from our central labor councils.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;We need to make the work of central labor councils so
important and essential that local unions feel it would be
foolish not to affiliate,&quot; said Marilyn Sneiderman, the
federation's field mobilization director. &quot;We must
simultaneously activate our councils and increase affiliation of
locals so we have the resources that we need to get the job
done.&quot; </p>
<p>Another key focus of the national conference was coalition-
building in the community. In adopting a new slogan,
&quot;Organizing for Justice in the Community,&quot; conference
attendees spent many hours in workshops and plenary sessions
developing strategies about how best to build progressive
networks back home. </p>
<p>Radio commentator Jim Hightower praised labor as &quot;the
force that rallies people whether they are union or not. That's
what this is all about.&quot; </p>
<p>The officers also elected four members to the CLC Advisory
Committee from a field of 20 who sought election. They are Jeff
Crosby of Lynn, Mass.; Ernie Esposito of Johnstown, Pa. ; Warren
Gould of New Haven, Conn.; and Ernie Grecco of Baltimore. Dean
was elected to chair the committee. </p>
<p>Formed by Sweeney with the appointment of 20 officers from
small, medium and large councils, the committee's charge is to
set priorities and the direction for labor councils. As part of
their work, every council is being surveyed via telephone, with
320 surveys completed, said Fernando Gapasin of Penn State
University. </p>
<p>The AFL-CIO plans to use the work of the Advisory Committee,
the conference and the telephone survey to lead the national CLC
mobilization effort to unite and magnify the work of each council
into one program that offers workers a real opportunity to start
fighting back and winning, Sneiderman said. </p>
<p>Other speakers included Sweeney's Executive Assistant Bob
Welsh; Arlene Holt, executive assistant to Chavez-Thompson;
Richard Bensinger, director of the AFL-CIO Organizing Department;
Steve Rosenthal, director of the federation's Political
Department; and Peggy Taylor, director of the federation's
Legislative Department. </p>

<h3 align="center">$20 million award reversed <br>
</h3>
<hr width="80%">
<p>A federal appeals court has reversed a $20 million lower court
damages award against the Carpenters and the Paperworkers. </p>
<p>BE&amp;K, a nonunion construction firm based in Birmingham,
Ala., alleged that the unions conspired to have the company
removed from a $500 million Potlatch Corp. paper mill
construction project in 1991. The 8th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals dismissed claims against the UBC because of insufficient
evidence, and dismissed a state claim against UPIU because it was
pre-empted by a pending federal suit. The case is BE&amp;K
Construction vs. Carpenters. </p>
<p>&quot;This is not just a great decision for us,&quot; said UBC
President Douglas J. McCarron. &quot;The court's ruling also
defends the rights of all unions to work together in
solidarity.&quot; </p>
<p>UPIU President Wayne E. Glenn praised the unanimous appeals
court decision, calling the jury finding &quot;unjustified&quot;
and the award &quot;outrageous.&quot; </p>
<p>BE&amp;K charged that the two unions threatened Potlatch with
violence if BE&amp;K was not removed from work on its Cypress
Bend mill in McGehee, Ark. The appeals court found that the UBC
was not even present at the meeting in question and that UPIU,
which represents Cypress Bend workers, did not threaten Potlatch,
but had peacefully and legally tried to convince the company to
change its mind. </p>
<h4>No `paycheck electioneering'</h4>
<p>The National Labor Relations Board unanimously banned
companies from using workers' paychecks and the way they are
distributed to influence union elections. </p>
<p>Citing its rules against last-minute speechmaking by either
side to a &quot;captive audience&quot; and late campaigning near
polling places, the board laid down these prohibitions on
employers: </p>
<ul>
    <li>No splitting of paychecks as an anti-union tactic. Some
        employers would give employees two checks, one containing
        what the employer says the worker would earn, less union
        dues, and the other representing what the employer claims
        would be the union dues. </li>
    <li>No changing the time, location or method of paycheck
        distribution. </li>
</ul>
<p>The case stemmed from a complaint by the Operating Engineers
against Kalin Construction Co. in Sodus, Mich., over a 1994
election. The board ordered a new election. </p>
<h4>California wage law upheld</h4>
<p>A federal appeals court has upheld California's prevailing
wage law that sets a two-tiered payment system. </p>
<p>Two nonunion contractors had argued that the federal
Employment Retirement Income Security Act pre-empted the law.
ERISA sets guidelines for the protection of employee benefit
plans. </p>
<p>The California law requires contractors on state-funded public
works projects to pay prevailing wages without crediting higher-
than-prevailing benefit contributions. The contractor can pay
workers the total amount of the prevailing wage and benefits in
cash wages, or pay a combination of at least the prevailing cash
wage plus employee benefit plan contributions that together
amount to at least the total amount of the prevailing wage. </p>
<p>The contractors, WSB Electric Inc. and J.R. Roberts Corp., had
appealed a similar ruling by the U.S. District Court. In its
ruling, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said ERISA
exemptions did not apply to the California law, which regulates
wages in general, nor wages that are part of a specific benefit
plan. </p>
<p>The case is WSB Electric vs. Curry. </p>
<h4>Court curtails company</h4>
<p>The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit
has issued an order enjoining the cleaning company United States
Service Industries Inc. from retaliating against employees
because of their union activities and from otherwise violating
the National Labor Relations Act. </p>
<p>The Washington-based janitorial firm has been the focus of an
ongoing organizing drive by Service Employees Local 82. The order
enjoins the company from, among other actions, transferring and
discharging employees because of their union activity; engaging
in surveillance of employees; interrogating employees; and
threatening employees with reprisal. </p>

<h3 align="center">UNITE's Kmart pact `excellent' <br>
<font size="3"><i>By Colleen M. O'Neill</i></font></h3>
<hr width="80%">
<p>The community of Greensboro, N.C., again rallied around civil
rights and human rights, helping to produce a top-notch contract
for Kmart distribution center workers after a bitter struggle. </p>
<p>Religious leaders and activists gave vigorous support to the
workers at the facility, who voted for union representation in
September 1993. As the months passed, workers learned they earned
by far the lowest wages of all Kmart's &quot;hard-line&quot;
distribution workers, and they built their case for justice and
dignity with patience and confidence. </p>
<p>In fact, the predominantly white work forces at the chain's
other hard-line centers were making hourly wages an average of $4
higher than those of the mostly minority Greensboro workers. </p>
<p>The battle grew to include a community-sponsored boycott,
civil disobedience demonstrations and other actions. Workers'
persistence paid off with a three-year contract covering some 550
workers that went into effect July 28. It includes: </p>
<ul>
    <li>Pay increases ranging from 22 percent to 52 percent over
        the next 24 months. </li>
    <li>Two new paid holidays. </li>
    <li>Increases in paid sick leave. </li>
    <li>Nondiscrimination language. </li>
    <li>New job-bidding, grievance procedures and work standards
        language. </li>
</ul>
<p>&quot;This is an excellent new contract,&quot; said Bruce
Raynor, executive vice president and southern regional director
of UNITE. &quot;It was a long, tough battle, but the Kmart
workers, with the tremendous support from the Greensboro
community, were able to force the company to agree to a contract
that offers them the highest wage increases that any hard-line
distribution center has ever received.&quot; </p>
<p>In addition to actions in the Triad area of North Carolina,
protests against Kmart's treatment of its workers took place in
Atlanta, Houston, Chicago, Cleveland, Memphis, Tenn., and
Norfolk, Va. </p>
<p>In real terms, the pact provides an hourly wage boost of 50
cents this year, 75 cents next July and 75 cents in July 1998.
Workers also received a 50-cent-per-hour raise last March, during
negotiations. The current base rate of $9 an hour will go to $11
by the third year. The starting rate in the warehouse of $7.25 an
hour will advance to $9 an hour. </p>
<p>In addition to the wage and sick leave gains, other benefits
remain unchanged, such as major medical insurance coverage for
employees and dependents, a disability income plan and dental
plan t all fully paid by the company - and a retirement savings
plan. </p>

<h3 align="center">Coalitions tailor sweatshop campaign <br>
<font size="3"><i>By Muriel H. Cooper</i></font></h3>
<hr width="80%">
<p>Two recent Washington events showcased the continued efforts
of labor unions, the Department of Labor, celebrities and
retailers to eradicate sweatshops throughout the world. </p>
<p>The &quot;Fashion Industry Forum&quot; and congressional
hearing were followed up by a New York demonstration July 30 by
the &quot;Stop Sweatshops&quot; Coalition against jeans maker
&quot;Guess?&quot; for allowing sweatshop conditions in the
manufacture of its garments. </p>
<p>UNITE President Jay Mazur outlined steps that would help
eliminate sweatshops during the fashion forum sponsored by the
Labor Department. </p>
<p>These measures include manufacturers and retailers taking
responsibility for how their products are produced, new industry
standards that recognize the growing trend of giant retailers who
also are manufacturers, increased resources and powers for the
Labor Department, international trade agreements linked to worker
rights and corporate codes of conduct. </p>
<p>During a July 15 congressional hearing, Rep. Christopher H.
Smith (R-N.J.) called for the United States to block the
importation of goods made with exploitative child labor and to
cut off foreign aid to countries that tolerate sweatshops using
child labor. </p>
<p>The International Labor Organization estimates that some 73
million children between the ages of 10 and 14 are employed
worldwide. American consumers began to focus on the issue of
child labor and the resurgence of sweatshops last summer, when
almost 70 workers were found toiling in slave-like conditions in
California. </p>
<p>&quot;The shocking revelations from El Monte, Calif., last
year t followed by The Gap and Kathie Lee Gifford episodes - have
awakened the country to the return of the sweatshop,&quot; Mazur
said. This past spring, UNITE exposed a New York City sweatshop
that produced clothing for the Kathie Lee Gifford line. </p>
<p>&quot;This is more than an economic problem for a particular
industry, firm or group of workers,&quot; Mazur said. &quot;The
injustice and inhumanity of the modern sweatshop constitute a
moral challenge for our society - a challenge to some of the most
basic democratic and human values.&quot; </p>
<p>Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich affirmed the Clinton
administration's support for ending child labor, and called for
such efforts as an international labeling system like the
&quot;RUGMARK&quot; tag, which is affixed to hand-knotted carpets
certifying that they are not made with child labor. </p>
<p>Nearly 300 garment industry professionals were represented at
the DoL forum in Arlington, Va. </p>
<p>Many of the retail representatives said they were working to
monitor factories here and abroad that produce clothing for the
U.S. market to ensure they are adhering to labor laws. </p>
<p>Also appearing at the forum was sweatshop worker Nancy
Penaloza, who described how she worked at least 56 hours a week
sewing women's suits for $6 each. The suits are sold for more
than $120. </p>
<p>&quot;The factory is very dirty, &quot; she said. &quot;When
I'm working, I'm afraid because the rats and mice crawl on my
feet. There is only one bathroom for 150 people, and it is very
dirty. . . . I hope this forum today will help to make conditions
better for garment workers,&quot; she said. </p>

<h3 align="center">USWA: No dealwith Bridgestoneif workers out <br>
<font size="3"><i>By James B. Parks</i></font></h3>
<hr width="80%">
<p>Steelworkers President George Becker said he is willing to
meet anywhere at anytime to settle the two-year strike against
Bridgestone/Firestone, but only if replaced workers are returned
to work. </p>
<p>&quot;I would be willing to meet with appropriate officials of
Bridgestone/Firestone as soon as one condition is met,&quot;
Becker said. &quot;That condition is the return to work of all of
the workers whom the company has illegally replaced at its
facilities. Until that condition is met, any meeting with me
would be pointless,&quot; he said. </p>
<p>Becker's statement was in response to reports that in a
meeting with Rev. Jesse L. Jackson, Bridgestone officials said
they wanted to meet with Becker and that Becker should be
involved in future negotiations. </p>
<p>&quot;While the Steelworkers carry out a worldwide campaign to
publicize Bridgestone/Firestone's anti-union, anti-worker
conduct, we have amply demonstrated our sincerity in wanting to
negotiate a fair contract that will meet the needs of both the
company and the union,&quot; Becker said. &quot;I urge the
company to make a similar show of sincerity by immediately
restoring all of the illegally replaced workers.&quot; </p>
<p>On the second anniversary of the strike, the USWA ratcheted up
the pressure on the Japanese tiremaker with an impressive show of
international solidarity during the &quot;Days of Rage,&quot;
July 12-13. </p>
<p>From Nashville, Tenn., to Sao Paulo, Brazil, to Tokyo, workers
around the world sent an unqualified message to
Bridgestone/Firestone: Settle the strike with the Steelworkers
quickly and fairly. </p>
<p>Bridgestone even lost support in its own backyard when
Nashville's Metro Transit revoked the company's contract for bus
tires. Lucas Tire Co., New Orleans' largest independent tire
dealer, also dropped Bridgestone's tires. </p>
<p>AFL-CIO President John J. Sweeney and Becker led a march by
2,000 workers and strike supporters in Nashville, the tiremaker's
U.S. headquarters. &quot;The only way to cope with corporate
lizards is to lift the rocks they hide under and turn their
bellies up to the sun,&quot; Sweeney told the crowd. The strikers
have &quot;13.1 million brothers and sisters who will walk before
they drive an automobile, or ride a bus, or operate an earthmover
that slithers down the street on Bridgestone/Firestone
tires,&quot; he said. </p>
<p>The USWA and Bridgestone/Firestone have been unable to reach
agreement on a contract since July 1994, when 4,000 workers
walked off the job. The workers, formerly members of the Rubber
Workers, suspended the strike after 10 months. During the strike,
Bridgestone/Firestone hired 2,300 replacement workers. At issue
is the rehiring of 700 strikers. </p>
<p>RENGO, Japan's labor federation, held a press conference in
Tokyo condemning the management of Bridgestone and issuing a
strong statement supporting the USWA and demanding a fair
settlement. </p>
<p>In Argentina, 2,000 workers staged a three-hour rally and work
stoppage in solidarity with the USWA and to show Bridgestone
officials that they would strike if there is no progress in their
talks. Bridgestone has threatened to eliminate 150 jobs there if
the union does not accept its last offer. </p>
<p>In Brazil, workers staged one-hour work stoppages at each of
three shift changes, and all shifts engaged in a work slowdown
that they called &quot;working like turtles.&quot; </p>
<p>In Europe, union representatives from every Bridgestone plant
met with top company officials in Brussels and demanded that a
just agreement be reached. </p>
<p>For the two weeks prior to the meeting, European workers
handbilled at all Bridgestone plants on the continent and
displayed black flags on all union bulletin boards. </p>
<p>In addition to the rallies, the USWA ran a 30-minute
television program in 20 cities July 13 exposing the activities
of the company Becker calls &quot;a poster child for corporate
irresponsibility.&quot; </p>
<p>Meanwhile, Nashville city officials denied the USWA's request
to extend the permit for Camp Justice, the tent city occupied by
replaced workers located just outside Bridgestone/Firestone
headquarters. The 90-day permit expired July 15. The union has
appealed the decision, and an Aug. 13 hearing has been set. </p>

<h3 align="center">Teamsters nominate Carey, Hoffa for membership
vote <br>
<font size="3"><i>By David Kameras</i></font></h3>
<hr width="80%">
<p>The Teamsters completed their 25th international convention in
Philadelphia July 19 after nominating President Ron Carey and
challenger James Hoffa for the top post of the AFL-CIO's largest
union. </p>
<p>A direct ballot election is set for November. </p>
<p>In his candidate acceptance speech, Carey pointed to the
reversal of a 16-year membership decline, development of grass-
roots and educational programs, anti-corruption efforts and
achievement &quot;of some of the best contracts our members have
ever worked under&quot; as evidence of a track record of fighting
&quot;to put our members first.&quot; </p>
<p>In accepting his nomination, Hoffa proposed a new future for
the union, &quot;one with respectable contracts and with a new
general president who won't take orders from outsiders,&quot; an
allusion to the federal consent decree under which the union
currently is functioning. </p>
<p>While in Philadelphia, the IBT sought to resolve a dispute
with May Department Stores, which is shuttering a Strawbridge
&amp; Clothier warehouse occupied by protesting workers and
moving operations out of the area. Those efforts were praised by
AFL-CIO President John J. Sweeney, who also lauded the union as
&quot;one of the brightest lights on the organizing
horizon.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;We need to get ourselves a new organizing attitude and
begin treating anti-union bosses like we treat anti-union
politicians,&quot; Sweeney said. &quot;If a boss fires somebody,
we should get the boss fired. If a boss takes us on, we take the
fight public. If the boss breaks the law, we break their bank
account, sit in their offices and get in their faces.&quot; </p>
<p>Delegates voted to establish a code of ethics for pension and
health fund trustees, add the president of Teamsters Canada to
the international's general executive board, bar members and
officials from associating with organized crime and uphold the
suspension and expulsion of a number of officials accused of
corruption. </p>
<p>But spirited and sometimes raucous debate between the two
presidential camps held up action on a number of proposals
affecting electoral procedures, area conferences, officer
compensation and the union's strike fund, prompting Carey to call
for a special convention after the election. &quot;That's the
only way we can complete our business, to take it out of politics
and have an orderly convention.&quot; </p>
<p>The commotion in the hall frequently disrupted the course of
business and prevented Sen. Arlen Specter (R-Pa.) from addressing
the delegates, who nonetheless united to cheer Labor Secretary
Robert B. Reich, there to credit the Clinton administration for
having &quot;finally put in place a National Labor Relations
Board that understands that collective bargaining is a right and
not a privilege.&quot; </p>
<p>Reich pledged use of the president's veto authority to block
Republican efforts to gut workplace safety, scrap overtime and
allow the establishment of company unions. &quot;What's good for
American workers is good for America,&quot; he said, &quot;and
that is why we need strong unions in this country.&quot; </p>
<p>A poll of rank-and-file Teamsters by Peter D. Hart Research
Associates indicates that members prefer Bill Clinton over Bob
Dole 58-30, and 65 percent approve of Clinton's performance.
However, the convention declined to endorse a specific candidate
for the White House, indicating instead that local unions will
promote voter registration and education. </p>
<p>&quot;We don't tell our members how to vote,&quot; Carey said.
&quot;We provide them with the facts, and they will make up their
own minds. On the major economic issues facing working families,
it's clear that most of our members believe that the Clinton-Gore
ticket is a better choice than Bob Dole.&quot; </p>

<h3 align="center">West Coast ports hum <br>
</h3>
<hr width="80%">
<p>The Longshoremen reached a tentative three-year contract with
the Pacific Maritime Association that would provide wage
increases of $3 per hour for 8,000 workers at 26 ports on the
West Coast. </p>
<p>The ILWU's Longshore Division Caucus ratified the pact July 22
and sent it to the membership for a vote sometime in August. The
contract would be retroactive to July 1, when the previous
contract expired. </p>
<p>Under the agreement, the workers would receive a $2 raise in
the first year and $1 in the second. The increases would be the
first since 1993 for the workers. </p>
<p>Skill rate differentials also increase for longshore equipment
operators and marine clerks. The highest differential of 6.75
percent will increase to 20 percent over term. Pension benefits
also would increase for future retirees from $2,415 per month to
$2,520 in the third year. </p>
<h4>Janitors in tentative pact</h4>
<p>After turning up the heat on San Francisco building owners and
managers with a 99 percent strike vote, 4,000 janitors were
voting Aug. 3 on a contract that would increase wages and
pensions by 25 percent. </p>
<p>The Building Owners and Managers Association and the San
Francisco Contractors' Association had proposed dismantling the
union hiring hall, reducing health and welfare coverage and
eliminating seniority rights, even while building owners are
reaping record profits. </p>
<p>The janitors, who are mostly immigrants, minorities and women,
are represented by Service Employees Local 87. </p>
<h4>Victory in Grayson, Ky.</h4>
<p>A two-year fight for dignity and decent wages by the Service
Employees at Cook Family Foods ended when the workers ratified a
new contract. </p>
<p>The new contract doubles current pay levels, exceeding
industry standards, the union said. While the contract does not
include a union shop clause, some 188 of the 200 workers who
voted in the election joined the union. </p>
<p>The employees, formerly members of the Firemen and Oilers,
struck for more than a year at the Grayson, Ky., plant. About 100
employees returned to work after a federal court in Cincinnati
overturned an NLRB decision certifying the union as bargaining
representative for the workers. </p>
<h4>IBEW in Georgia pact</h4>
<p>About 5,000 Electrical Workers at Georgia Power will receive a
7 percent pay raise after ratifying a new three-year contract. </p>
<p>The deal, approved June 28, covers power plant operators,
linemen, meter readers and maintenance and repair workers. They
will receive a 3 percent wage increase in the first year,
followed by hikes of 2 percent in 1997 and 1998. </p>
<p>Shift differentials and per diems also increased, and the
amount workers must pay for long-term disability benefits
declined. </p>
<h4>Supervisors back workers</h4>
<p>The San Francisco Board of Supervisors passed a resolution in
support of the California Professional Employees, an affiliate of
the Painters that represents workers at the city's Economic
Opportunity Council. </p>
<p>The resolution urged the council to negotiate and reach a
collective bargaining agreement. The union has been attempting to
bargain a new contract to replace one that expired July 1, but
agency officials refuse to negotiate. </p>
<p>The agency also is fighting union efforts to organize
employees in three other departments at the agency. The union,
which represents 70 employees who provide day care for poor
children and home weatherization services, has filed unfair labor
practice charges with the National Labor Relations Board over the
negotiations and organizing roadblocks. </p>
<p>San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown, U.S. Sen. Barbara Boxer and
U.S. Rep. Tom Lantos, all Democrats, already have made public
statements in support of the workers. </p>

<h3 align="center">`We will win Detroit strike' <br>
Sweeney boosts strikers as solidarity actions grow <br>
<font size="3"><i>By James B. Parks</i></font></h3>
<hr width="80%">
<p>Organized labor intends to turn up the heat as high as
necessary to win the Detroit newspaper strike, AFL-CIO President
John J. Sweeney said. </p>
<p>&quot;We're going to win those strikes. That's a promise and a
commitment,&quot; Sweeney said, referring to the strikes in
Detroit and at Bridgestone/Firestone. &quot;To really scare (the
Detroit newspapers), we have to have an even stronger impact on
profits, circulation and advertising,&quot; he said. &quot;That
is what we are planning to do. </p>
<p>&quot;First of all, we have to win this for the strikers.
Second, we have to win this for the labor movement. I'm not sure
if you appreciate how much focus there is on this strike in other
parts of the country. This is just an example of the corporate
greed we see,&quot; Sweeney told a crowd of strikers during a
visit to Detroit. </p>
<p>Some 2,000 employees of the News and Free Press, owned by
Gannett and Knight-Ridder, respectively, have been on strike
since July 13, 1995, after negotiations failed to produce a new
agreement. Management and imported scabs from other papers are
producing the newspapers. Hired union-busting security goons from
Vance and Huffmaster are delivering the papers. </p>
<p>Striking unions include the Teamsters, Communications Workers,
Graphic Communications and The Newspaper Guild. </p>
<p>The strikers settled an unfair labor practice charge July 12
by agreeing not to coerce current newspaper employees by making
threats, gathering in crowds to picket or blocking driveways. </p>
<p>The settlement agreement was spurred by a National Labor
Relations Board threat to seek an injunction against alleged
misconduct, and by the fuel such proceedings might add to the
newspapers' racketeering suit against the unions, said Samuel
McKnight, attorney for the striking unions. </p>
<p>&quot;The real violence here is the company's effort to
destroy the working lives of 2,000 decent employees,&quot;
McKnight said. &quot;We'll continue to do everything we've been
doing to inflict on them huge economic losses until they bargain
in good faith.&quot; </p>
<p>The strikers repeated their desire to negotiate a fair
settlement. In an editorial in the striker-produced Sunday
Journal, the unions urged management to &quot;make us an offer.
Respond to one of ours. `Drop dead' or `Go away' is not a useful
response. Get off the dime and begin serious negotiations about a
contract. </p>
<p>&quot;If the absentee owners choose not to negotiate, however,
they shouldn't kid themselves that the strike is over or that
they are going to win back the trust and readership and dollars
of the community they have so egregiously insulted with their
arrogance and union-busting,&quot; the unions said. </p>
<p>The strikers continue to get strong support from other unions.
The Locomotive Engineers, meeting in Detroit, donated $20,000 to
help the strike. Gwend Johnson, an assistant to CWA President
Morton Bahr, announced that all of the families on the
Adopt-A-Family list had been adopted as of July 1. But donations
still are needed to keep the fund solvent. Contributions can be
mailed to: Adopt-A-Family, c/o Gwend Johnson, CWA Headquarters,
501 Third St. N.W., Washington, D.C. 20001, phone: 202/434-1115. </p>
<p>On the first anniversary of the strike, the strikers rallied
at the Sterling Heights printing plant where the scab papers are
produced. In San Jose, Calif., more than 100 people rallied and
raised $500 for the strikers. </p>
<p>In Washington, some 200 delegates to the A. Philip Randolph
Institute's annual education conference joined Newspaper Guild
President Linda K. Foley, striking Detroit newspaper employees
and Washington Metropolitan AFL-CIO President Joslyn N. Williams
in front of the National Press Building to protest the presence
of the Detroit News and Knight-Ridder bureau offices in the
building. </p>
<p>&quot;We don't want union busters in our town,&quot; Foley
said. </p>
<p>Strikers Meka Murphy and Gean Odroniec, both members of IBT
Local 372, told the crowd they had not received an adequate raise
since 1989. &quot;All we want is a decent contract and a decent
wage and to go back to work,&quot; Odroniec said. </p>
<p>&quot;We made this company,&quot; Murphy said. &quot;We built
this company, and this is what they do to us.&quot; </p>

<h3 align="center">New leaders for California <br>
</h3>
<hr width="80%">
<p>The California AFL-CIO charted a new course with an expanded
executive council and two new leaders. </p>
<p>Art Pulaski, secretary-treasurer of the San Mateo Labor
Council, was elected executive secretary-treasurer July 31 by
some 800 delegates, replacing the retiring Jack Henning. Tom
Rankin, state federation research director and lobbyist, was
elected president, succeeding Albin J. Gruhn, who also retired. </p>
<p>Delegates approved the expansion of the council from 36 to 46
to increase representation by women and people of color. </p>
<p>State federations must set a higher standard for organizing,
and unions must adopt a more aggressive organizing attitude, AFL-
CIO President John J. Sweeney told the delegates. In order to
reverse union membership losses, Sweeney called on state
federations &quot;to roll out the big guns&quot; and shift more
of their resources to organizing. </p>
<p>AFL-CIO Executive Vice President Linda Chavez-Thompson also
addressed the convention. </p>
<h4>No to harassment</h4>
<p>Women's, labor, legal, religious and community organizations
have pledged their support for expand protections for sexual
harassment victims. </p>
<p>&quot;We stand solidly with those supporting this legislation
that will serve to hold responsible parties accountable when
perpetrators of sexual harassment are negligently hired or
retained in the workplace,&quot; said Massachusetts AFL-CIO
President Joseph Faherty. </p>
<p>Boston 9to5, National Association of Working Women, was
instrumental in gaining a broadened interpretation of the state's
sexual harassment statute. The measure would allow victims of
sexual harassment to file cases directly in Superior Court within
three years of the incident or file with the Massachusetts
Commission Against Discrimination. </p>
<p>It also would extend the statute of limitations from six
months to three years for all forms of workplace discrimination. </p>
<h4>County runs sweatshop</h4>
<p>The Los Angeles County Labor Federation announced that Los
Angeles County and its Home Supportive Services program has
received the &quot;L.A.'s Biggest Sweatshop&quot; award. </p>
<p>The Home Supportive Services program pays sub-poverty wages
and regularly denies workers payment for hours worked, raises and
opportunities for advancement. Workers don't receive health
benefits either, despite the fact that many are injured on the
job providing care for others. </p>
<p>The award was presented by an exploited Thai worker whose
story focused attention on the resurgence of sweatshops in
America. Last summer during a raid, almost 70 Thai workers were
discovered working in El Monte, Calif., in slave-like conditions. </p>
<h4>Privatization panned</h4>
<p>Postal unions testifying before the House subcommittee on the
Postal Service said they supported some provisions in the Postal
Reform Act of 1996, but they adamantly oppose privatization and
the dilution of bargaining rights. </p>
<p>Postal Workers President Moe Biller said the APWU supports
provisions on competitive mail, changes in USPS financing and law
enforcement improvements. Letter Carriers President Vincent R.
Sombrotto also favored those provisions, but challenged a
proposal that rate adjustments could be used to restrict the
financial component of collective bargaining agreements. </p>
<p>Mail Handlers President William H. Quinn also testified. </p>
<h4>Web clean-up campaign</h4>
<p>Service Employees Local 82, home of the Justice for Janitors
campaign in the nation's capital, has unveiled its World Wide Web
site, Toxin Watch. </p>
<p>The site includes information on toxic spills, releases and
other environmental problems of select oil, gas and chemical
companies. </p>
<p>The web address is <a

<h3 align="center">BLE elects new leadership <br>
<font size="3"><i>By David Kameras</i></font></h3>
<hr width="80%">
<p>By a 320-276 vote, delegates at the Locomotive Engineers'
convention in Detroit elected a new president, Clarence Monin,
formerly the union's first vice president. </p>
<p>Monin defeated incumbent Ronald McLaughlin. A third candidate,
Paul Morrison, chairman of the union's California legislative
board, received 23 votes. Also elected to five-year terms were
Edward Dubrowski, first vice president and Russell W. Bennett,
secretary-treasurer. </p>
<p>Monin pledged to &quot;mobilize, energize and organize the
Locomotive Engineers and the other employees we represent.&quot;
He indicated that he wants to make BLE, which joined the AFL-CIO
in 1989, 133 years after its founding, a larger and more
aggressive part of the labor movement &quot;in concert with the
AFL-CIO and the Transportation Trades Department.&quot; </p>
<p>While in the union's No. 2 position, Monin served as U.S.
national chairman of the BLE safety task force, helping the
National Transportation Safety Board investigate major rail
accidents, was vice chairman of the union's U.S. national
legislative board and directed BLE's education and training
department. He also assisted in on-site negotiations during the
most recent round of contract talks. </p>
<p>In an example of the union's emphasis on solidarity, a
thousand members, officers and family members joined with
striking Detroit News and Free Press workers in a march to demand
that management bargain in good faith, and passed the hat to
raise $20,000 to help out strikers and their families. </p>
<p>BLE's show of unity went &quot;above and beyond the call of
solidarity,&quot; said Margaret Trimer-Hartley, an activist who
before the strike was an education writer for the Free Press, and
who was asked to address the convention. &quot;I felt
particularly proud to be there because my father was a railroad
man.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;I think what we saw in Detroit is an awakening of what
can be done between sister unions of the AFL-CIO,&quot; union
spokesman Steve Fitzgerald said. </p>
<p>AFL-CIO President John J. Sweeney told delegates that labor's
recent successes in getting the Senate to approve a minimum-wage
increase and defeat a national right-to-work bill, as well as
blocking the so-called TEAM Act and efforts to eliminate new
repetitive stress injury regulations, have triggered efforts by
business lobbies and anti-worker forces in Congress to target
unionists with lies and half-truths. </p>
<p>&quot;Well, I don't know about you, but I'm ready,&quot; he
declared. &quot;I'm delighted to take my place beside all their
other targets: the young, the old, working families, the disabled
and the poor. I stand before you today and say I'm proud to be a
target. </p>
<p>&quot;Will you stand with me?&quot; he asked. &quot;Will you
stand with me and (Secretary-Treasurer) Rich Trumka and
(Executive Vice President) Linda Chavez-Thompson as we take back
our country?&quot; The convention responded with a standing
ovation. </p>
<p>Sweeney warned of the consequences that would result if Bob
Dole, &quot;the `Darth Vader' of American politics,&quot; wins
the presidency in November, and outlined the federation's
grass-roots legislative and political education program with
which &quot;we're going to win, from the courthouse to the White
House.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;Why am I so sure? Because America's workers are fed up
with seeing their wages keep falling while the stock market and
productivity and executive salaries and corporate profits keep
skyrocketing,&quot; he said. </p>
<p>Other convention speakers included Railroad Signalmen
President W.D. Pickett, Canadian Labour Congress Secretary-
Treasurer V.M. &quot;Butch&quot; Speakman, labor member of the
Railroad Retirement Board, Rep. David E. Bonior (D-Mich.),
Detroit Mayor Dennis W. Archer and Federal Railroad Administrator
Jolene Molitoris, whose reception was characterized as
&quot;restrained and polite.&quot; </p>

<h3 align="center">AFA: Ground Valujet's executives <br>
</h3>
<hr width="80%">
<p>Citing continuing safety concerns, the Flight Attendants asked
the Transportation Department to give the boot to top officers at
ValuJet Airlines. </p>
<p>Charging that management is either incapable or unwilling to
run a safe airline, the union, which represents the airline's 600
flight attendants, said chief executive Robert Priddy and chief
operating officer Lewis Jordan &quot;should not be trusted with
the public safety.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;This management team bears full responsibility for
ValuJet's horrendous safety record,&quot; said AFA President
Patricia Friend. &quot;They have proven they cannot run an
airline safely, and the DoT must take action.&quot; </p>
<p>ValuJet's fleet was grounded on June 18 after numerous
inspections by the Federal Aviation Administration turned up
serious safety problems at the cut-rate carrier in the wake of a
May 11 crash in Florida that killed all on board. Since beginning
service in 1993, the airline has had six accidents, been
investigated for an additional eight safety &quot;incidents&quot;
and garnered 340 service difficulty reports at the FAA. There
were 59 unscheduled landings in the first five months of this
year alone. </p>
<p>Despite this ghastly record, management is seeking permission
to get airborne again. The AFA said the carrier's filing seeks to
keep certain records secret and to gain an exemption from DoT
procedural rules governing public notice and comment. </p>
<p>The AFA also is pushing for passage of legislation that would
give &quot;whistleblower&quot; protection to aviation workers
reporting safety violations in their workplace. </p>
<p>In another aviation development: </p>
<ul>
    <li>The Air Traffic Controllers, an affiliate of the Marine
        Engineers, has provided initial funding for creation of
        the National Aviation Research Institute, which is
        intended to improve air safety through the development of
        new technology based on the input of the workers who
        actually operate the resulting equipment. </li>
</ul>
<p>Noting that the technology of the present air traffic control
system is 10 to 15 years behind, Acting Executive Director Mike
Connor said the new group will be listening to those &quot;able
to talk about what their needs are within the system, rather than
people who cannot make it happen when they worked with the
FAA.&quot; </p>

<h3 align="center">Wage fight on national track <br>
Congressional vote is just part of the story <br>
<font size="3"><i>By David Kameras</i></font></h3>
<hr width="80%">
<p>Congress has voted to raise the minimum wage from $4.25 to
$5.15 an hour over two years, but that amount is considered
hardly enough for workers in many states and localities, who have
forged &quot;living wage&quot; campaigns from coast to coast. </p>
<p>Through its America Needs A Raise campaign, the AFL-CIO has
been working with coalitions throughout the nation to champion
the notion that people who work full time ought to earn enough to
support their families. </p>
<p>The most recent breakthrough in the effort to give America a
raise occurred in Oregon, where 114,494 signatures were collected
t many more than the number needed - to mandate a ballot
initiative for November that seeks to raise the state's hourly
minimum wage from $4.75 to $6.50 over three years. </p>
<p>&quot;This is the first step on the long road to give our
lowest- paid working families the raise they justly
deserve,&quot; said Oregon AFL-CIO President Irv Fletcher, who
worked with a coalition of more than 50 labor, religious, social
justice and environmental groups to get the initiative qualified
three days after the U.S. Senate approved an increase in the
federal minimum wage. </p>
<p>A similar success was scored just to the south, where an
initiative to put on the ballot a measure to raise California's
minimum wage by $1.50 qualified with almost 550,000 signatures.
AFL-CIO President John J. Sweeney was on hand to help submit the
qualifying ballots. </p>
<p>Voters in Denver and New Orleans will see the fruits of local
initiatives to boost wages on their ballots. Other citywide
initiatives are on the move in Albuquerque, N.M., Boston,
Chicago, Houston, Milwaukee, New York and Washington. </p>
<p>Fletcher said that Congress &quot;is just catching up to where
we've been for the past five years. We intend to continue the
proud and progressive Oregon tradition of setting superior
standards for basic worker protections and quality of life for
our families.&quot; </p>
<p>Those standards are more than an abstraction to Jeanie Taylor
of Salem, Ore., a single mother, full-time student and
minimum-wage worker. &quot;I'm not a teen-ager flipping
hamburgers for pocket change,&quot; she said. &quot;I'm a working
mom who is struggling to provide for my family, while attending
school full time - and $4.75 an hour just doesn't cut it. </p>
<p>&quot;If we increase the minimum wage in Oregon, I may not
have to choose between buying shoes for my son and putting food
on the table,&quot; Taylor said. </p>
<p>The AFL-CIO's &quot;America Needs A Raise&quot; campaign goes
beyond the minimum wage. It seeks to spotlight what has been a
decades-long slide in the buying power of American workers, which
in terms of hourly earnings fell 12 percent between 1978 and
1995. It draws attention to the 8 million workers who have to
work two jobs to make ends meet, and the longer hours they put in
on those jobs. It points to the drop in median family income
despite an explosive growth in multiearner families. </p>
<p>Real average weekly earnings did receive a boost in June,
rising 2.2 percent, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported. </p>
<p>Much of that increase was due to a 1.5 percent growth in
average weekly hours, and average hourly earnings rose 0.8
percent. For the 12 months, real average weekly earnings grew by
1.7 percent. </p>
<p>Median real weekly earnings actually fell slightly in the
second quarter, from $301 to $300 in constant 1982 dollars. </p>
<p>Contributing to the positive real earnings in June was the
continued low inflation rate, with consumer prices (CPI-W)
registering a tiny 0.1 percent increase. Decreases in the costs
of apparel and upkeep and transportation helped to offset a large
run- up in food and beverage prices. Producer prices, which help
predict future performance, rose 0.2 percent. </p>

<h3 align="center">Top U.S. export continues to be jobs <br>
<font size="3"><i>By David Kameras</i></font></h3>
<hr width="80%">
<p>The U.S. merchandise trade deficit widened in May, from $12.4
billion to $13.2 billion, as the nation continued to increase its
export of jobs, notably to the Pacific Rim. </p>
<p>The goods deficit with China jumped from $2.3 billion to $3.1
billion, and stands at $12.4 billion for the year - a 7.3 percent
increase over 1995. Although a weaker yen has helped narrow the
bilateral gap with Japan, that trend may change in the coming
months because of a recent appreciation of the dollar that made
U.S. products more expensive. </p>
<p>The five-month total merchandise deficit was $57.7 billion,
close to the $60.4 billion record set in 1995. </p>
<p>&quot;The U.S. trade deficit continues to expand, despite the
fact that unit labor costs continue to decline relative to most
of our trading partners,&quot; noted Mark Anderson, director of
the AFL-CIO Task Force on Trade. &quot;It is clear that lower
wages are not the way to improve the international trade position
of the United States.&quot; </p>
<p>Merchandise shortfalls with America's trading partners in the
North American Free Trade Agreement also have grown, with
year-to- date totals reaching $8.7 billion with Canada, up from
$6.5 billion in 1995, and $6.8 billion with Mexico, up from $6.2
billion. </p>
<p>The troubles for American workers created by the ill-advised
pact continue to materialize, as evidenced by the certification
for NAFTA transitional adjustment assistance of 250 laid-off
Pacificorp utility workers, bringing the total of those eligible
to more than 72,000. That total represents a mere fraction of
those actually affected by displacement. </p>
<p>Some 95 percent of imported electricity comes from Canada. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, at the southern border, Department of
Transportation officials succumbed to pressure from trucking
firms and agreed to weaken a truck safety inspection program on
the Texas-Mexico border. </p>
<p>Under the new plan, companies can self-certify that their
trucks have no safety problems, despite DoT findings that 51
percent of the trucks crossing into Texas were found too
dangerous to operate on U.S. highways. DoT found 34 percent of
trucks entering California to be unsafe, along with 44 percent of
trucks entering Arizona and 78 percent entering New Mexico. </p>
<p>With the certification, Mexican drivers - who earn as little
as $10 a day - can travel without restriction in those states,
and throughout the United States and Canada by 2000. Trucking
deregulation is a provision under NAFTA that the Teamsters and
several Mexican driver groups want renegotiated. </p>
<p>In addition, NAFTA has been roundly criticized for its weak
and unenforceable labor and environmental side agreements. Chile,
which has been considered for membership in an expanded NAFTA,
has agreed to join the Southern Cone Common Market, or Mercosur,
increasing pressure on the United States to grease the skids
toward new trade agreements, regardless of their potential flaws. </p>
<p>Trade performance in the first five months of the year was
particularly dismal in motor vehicles ($21.9 billion deficit),
clothing and footwear (16.5 billion), data processing and office
machinery ($9.6 billion), electrical machinery ($8.3 billion),
consumer electronics ($4.6 billion), toys and sporting goods
($3.1 billion), iron and steel products ($3 billion), furniture
and bedding ($2.3 billion) and paper and paperboard ($1 billion).

<H3>The Introduction of the Major Research Directions of ERC</H3>
<P><B>The major research directions of ERC covers four fields such as follows: </B><BR>
 <B>1)Die &amp; Mould CAD/CAM </B><BR>
 So far, the software developed by ERC such as Stamping Die &amp; Mold CAD/CAM Injection Mold CAD/CAM, Extrusion Die CAD, Drawing Die CAD and Continuous Blanking Die CAD/CAM have been used by over 2000 users all over the country and met the requests from most factories. At the same time, ERC also has developed and adsorbed various types of the graphic support software systems for Die CAD/CAM. So it provides the strong methods to describe the graphic for the further research work in the [plastic-deform theory. The ERC's research work in some fields has been counted among the best either in China or over the world. These fields includes the engineering data base special for Die &amp; Mold CAD/CAM. The expert system for Die &amp; Mold Design, the CNC wire-cut technology for super-thickness part.<BR>
 <B>2)The Numerical Simulation of the Metal Forming Processes </B><BR>
 At the begin of 1980's, ERC has already done some research work in the numerical simulation of the metal forming Process. It was the first one in China. Up to now, based on the plastic mechanics, the fluid mechanics. the plastic deform technology and the computer graphics, a general purpose simulation software system-S-FORM has been developed by ERC. This software is focus on solving the large deformation, non-liner plastic flow Problem and it is the most advance among the software just this kind in China. At the same time, in this research field, seven high-level dissertations for doctor degree have been finished and they are highly appraised by the experts.<BR>
 <B>3)The AI Research In the Plastic-forming Processes </B><BR>
 At the end of 1980's, ERC had carried out the research works in the application of AI(Artificial Intelligent) to analyze the plastic forming processes at first time in China. So far, the Injection-Mold AI System which has been finished by ERC has been appraised highly by the experts of China and other countries. At the some time, AI-Numerical System and AI-Stamping-Die &amp; Mold CAD System are under-developing in ERC. <BR>
 <B>4)The Physics Simulation and Optimization of the Plastic forming Process</B><BR>
 ERC has finished eight research Projects issued by the state, the State ministry, commission and Shanghai government in the fields of cold and warm extrusion, pressure rolling and the friction problem during the plastic deformation processes and so on and these projects were conferred respectively the awards of state, province, ministry, commission and Shanghai government. Now, ERC is doing some researches on the technology parameter optimization of plastic forming process and physics simulation.

<H3>The Introduction of the Major Research Directions of ERC</H3>
<P><B>The major research directions of ERC covers four fields such as follows: </B><BR>
 <B>1)Die &amp; Mould CAD/CAM </B><BR>
 So far, the software developed by ERC such as Stamping Die &amp; Mold CAD/CAM Injection Mold CAD/CAM, Extrusion Die CAD, Drawing Die CAD and Continuous Blanking Die CAD/CAM have been used by over 2000 users all over the country and met the requests from most factories. At the same time, ERC also has developed and adsorbed various types of the graphic support software systems for Die CAD/CAM. So it provides the strong methods to describe the graphic for the further research work in the [plastic-deform theory. The ERC's research work in some fields has been counted among the best either in China or over the world. These fields includes the engineering data base special for Die &amp; Mold CAD/CAM. The expert system for Die &amp; Mold Design, the CNC wire-cut technology for super-thickness part.<BR>
 <B>2)The Numerical Simulation of the Metal Forming Processes </B><BR>
 At the begin of 1980's, ERC has already done some research work in the numerical simulation of the metal forming Process. It was the first one in China. Up to now, based on the plastic mechanics, the fluid mechanics. the plastic deform technology and the computer graphics, a general purpose simulation software system-S-FORM has been developed by ERC. This software is focus on solving the large deformation, non-liner plastic flow Problem and it is the most advance among the software just this kind in China. At the same time, in this research field, seven high-level dissertations for doctor degree have been finished and they are highly appraised by the experts.<BR>
 <B>3)The AI Research In the Plastic-forming Processes </B><BR>
 At the end of 1980's, ERC had carried out the research works in the application of AI(Artificial Intelligent) to analyze the plastic forming processes at first time in China. So far, the Injection-Mold AI System which has been finished by ERC has been appraised highly by the experts of China and other countries. At the some time, AI-Numerical System and AI-Stamping-Die &amp; Mold CAD System are under-developing in ERC. <BR>
 <B>4)The Physics Simulation and Optimization of the Plastic forming Process</B><BR>
 ERC has finished eight research Projects issued by the state, the State ministry, commission and Shanghai government in the fields of cold and warm extrusion, pressure rolling and the friction problem during the plastic deformation processes and so on and these projects were conferred respectively the awards of state, province, ministry, commission and Shanghai government. Now, ERC is doing some researches on the technology parameter optimization of plastic forming process and physics simulation.

<TT> </TT>Tertiary amino resins(TAR) were chemically modified by quaternization with methyl iodide. By this route six partly quaternized tertiary amino resins(PQTAR) with different I/N mole ratio were synthesized. Four different reducing agents, I. e. , NaH, LiALH4, CH4OH-NaOH and NaBH4, were tested for the preparation of palladium catalysts dispersed on TAR or PQTAR. The rate of hydrogenation reaction were found to be dependent not only on the type of reducing agent but also on the structure of polymer support. Both the rate of hydrogenation and the amount of Pd eluted closely relate to the I/N mole ratio of the polymer supports. <BR>

<H3>Research Directions</H3>
<P>Computer Software has been developed rapidly for more than thirty years. but its current states is far from satisfaction. The three problems for software are weak functionality, poor quality and low productivity. Since software is essentially an intelligent-intensive product, it is of vital importance to conduct research on software development techniques. <BR>
 This lab mainly studies the so-called &quot;novel&quot;computer software techniques characterized by the following features: intelligence, automation, integration and naturalization. <BR>
 The intelligence technology is aimed at making software products of intelligence, the automation technology at realizing the automation of software development process, the integration technology at providing means of composition from software pieces, the parallelism technology at enhancing processing speed, and the naturalization technology at improving user friendliness in man-machine interfaces, description languages and software systems, thus allowing the users to have an easy access to software and computer systems. <BR>
 Based on the above understanding and our existing research work, this lab has taken software automation, distributed computing, new-style programming, intelligent operating systems and software development environment to be its research directions. <BR>
 The short-term goal of software automation is to improve the practicality of existing systems and to focus on machine learning, Chinese understanding and related theoretical foundations for the sakes of constructing new software systems. The long-term goal is to propose a new development paradigm and its corresponding model realizing the automatic generation from requirements definitions to executable programs. <BR>
 The short-term goal of distributed computing is to focus on the configuration of distributed operating systems, task allocation, synchronization mechanisms, distributed databases, etc. , the long-term goal is to propose some new theory of distributed computing and implement more practical systems. <BR>
 The short-term goal of new-style programming is to design a knowledge representation language, to design and implement languages for design, functionality and requirements descriptions, and to study suitable knowledge processing computer architectures. The long-term goal is to design and implement a new-style computer system and its programming system. <BR>
 The short-term goal of intelligent operating systems is to study the characteristics and structure of intelligent operating systems, intelligent resource allocation algorithms and intelligent man-machine interfaces, etc. . and to implement a practical system. The long-term goal is to implement different kinds of operating systems for intelligent computes and to break through some related theoretical problems. <BR>
 The short-term goal of software development environment is to develop a practical computer-aided software engineering system and a software development apprentice. The long-term goal is to implement an intelligent software development environment and to complete some theoretical research work correspondingly. 
<HR>
<H3>Research work </H3>
<P>Thirty-seven research projects have been carried out since the lab began its construction. Among them, seven are belonging to the national high-tech research projects, fourteen the national research and development projects, five the national science foundation projects, six provincial projects and five projects from other supports. Up to now, twenty-three projects have been fulfilled, of which fifteen passed the technical identification and five were awarded. more than two hundred papers have been published in the national and international academic journal and five books have been published, too. The details are given below. <BR>
 <BR>
 <B>Software Automation</B><BR>
 Five experimental systems have been completed. The NDAUTO system is based on the self-designed software specification language GSPEC. It automatically or semi-automatically transforms software specifications to PASCAL codes by the use of the combination of transformational and procedural approaches. It has been operational on IBM PC/AT microcomputer and SUN workstations since 1987. The NDTPS system is a transformational programming system based on the self-designed meta language TrapML. It is oriented to multiple object languages and multiple transformation strategies. It was implemented on IBM PC/AT in 1987. The NDADAS system is based on an improved software specification language FGSPEC. It combines the deductive and transformational approaches and heuristically(if necessary)generates software design specification from its functional ones. It was accomplished on SUN workstations in 1998. The NDIPS system is an inductive software automation system. It accepts program hypothesis validation routines. It adopts the partial ordering structure of a generalized subsumption relation, an automation model interface algorithm And program hypothesis validation routines. It was implemented on SUN workstations in 1989. The NDSAIL system is a software automation system with self-learning ability. It is based on the EBL method and some new techniques are development by the system designers. It is operational in SUN workstations in 1991. In addition to the above systems, some valuable results have also been obtained on the correctness of software specifications, software development frame, and analogical inference. <BR>
 <BR>
 <B>Disributed Computing </B><BR>
 Based on the ZCZ, ZH and SN distributed computing systems accomplished five years ago, other four systems have also been finished. EGLI is a distributed data processing system using local network technology. It implements the active communication and network file transition technology in the distributed Chinese database management system DdBASE-2, the connection between local network and remote workstations, tools for Chinese electronic mails, etc. and more than ten different kinds of applications software for the purpose of office automation, etc. It was fulfilled in 1986. ZGL is a heterogeneous distributed operating system running in 16-bit microcomputers network environment using Ethernet, ominet and RS232C connections. It was completed in 1989. Unify is a Chinese and English compatible distributed database management system based on SUN Unify and running on SUN workstations connected in Ethernet. It is upward compatible and was implemented in 1989. ZGL3 is a distributed operating system for different kinds of machines including 16-bit (IBM PC compatible) computer and 32-bit (SUN workstations compatible) microcomputers connected in Ethernet. It supports original functionality of MS-DOS and Unix and provides file sharing, processor sharing, process communication, distributed file systems, distributed programming language C , and electronic mails. It was accomplished in 1990. <BR>
 <BR>
 <B>New-Style Programming </B><BR>
 A data-driven multi-stack reduction machine model FPMND and its FP programming system were fulfilled by the end of 1984. This model consisted of a host machine (a M16 microcomputer) and three processing elements(single-board computer). An experimental parallel inference system NDPIS was also accomplished in 1986. It was based on self-designed kernel language KLND and made use of the &quot;substitution-driven&quot;concept. <BR>
 <BR>
 <B>Intelligence Operating Systems </B><BR>
 <BR>
 Three experimental systems have developed. The intelligent operating system KZL was completed in 1989 which aimed at improving man-machine communication ability. It consists of a communication expert system, a knowledge-based management system KZL/ZG and an Ethernet distributed operating system EOS. It provides Chinese understanding, on-line inquerring, on-line learning and voice input, etc. The general-purpose natural language interface KZ2/TZJ adopts a hierarchical method independent of application domains and allows the users to manipulate computers in Chinese conveniently. It is extensible and can be treated as a common national language interface for various operating systems like UNIX, VMS and MS-DOS, etc. It was implemented in 1990 including some learning ability also. The knowledge-based operating system KZ10 consists of an intelligent man-machine interface(KZ10/JK) and a knowledge-based distributed task scheduling system(KZ10/RD). The former provides the users with a friendly operating system interface to express their requirements through different input means. The latter implements an intelligent distributed task scheduling and a knowledge processing unit to make the system to be self-adaptable and self-learnable. it was fulfilled in 1990. <BR>
 <BR>
 <B>Software Development Environment </B><BR>
 Ten systems have been developed up to now. A syntax-directed editor was completed in 1986 to avoid syntactical errors for multiple languages. It is convenient to novices. The MODULA-2 compiler validation system constructs a testing package at first and then produces a validation report after the test. It was also accomplished in 1986. The PDL/M2 system completed in 1987 interactively transforms PDL(self-designed language)programs to MODULA-2 ones. The programming apprentice system NPA completed in 1990 is used to assist programmers in algorithm design. A testing tool system for testing programs in MODULA-2 and C was also fulfilled in 1990. A transformational system completed in 1990 consists of three subsystems to transform programs in COBOL, MODULA-2 and PASCAL to the corresponding in C . The requirements analysis tool completed in 1988 is used in structured analysis and structured design. A multi-lingual software understanding tool SUIE and an IBM assembly language transformation and understanding system wee also developed in 1990. The former is an integrated toolset system on SUN workstations to analyze software structures for multiple languages. The latter is rule-based integrated system.

<LI>John H.Pazur & LIU Belin        ISOATION AND CHARACTERIZATION OF SETS
OF ANTI-L-FUCOSE AND ANTI-BOVINE SERUM ALBUMIN ANTIBODIES DIRECTED AGAINST
A GLYCOCONJUGATE OF L-FUCOSE AND BOVICNE SERUM ALBUMIN  Journal of Prtein
chemistry, 1994, (American) 13(1)
	
        A set of anti-carbohydrate antibodies and a set of anti-protein
        antibodies were isolated from the serum of rabbits immunized with
        a glycoconjugate of L-fucose and bovine serum albumin. The sets
        were separated by affinity chromatography by a tw-column method on
        adsorbents with L-fucose or bovine serum albumin ligands.
        Isoelectrofocusing results showed that the anti-carbohydrate
        antibodies consisted of 11 molecular species and the anti-bovine
        serum albumin antibodies consisted of seven molecular species.
        The anti-carbohydrate antibodies are all of the IgG type while the
        anti-protein antibodies contain three types of globulin molecules.
        IgA, IgG and IgM. The former antibodies should be useful as
        markers for unique glycoproteins of diseased cells and the latter
        antibodies may be useful for investigating the mechanism of
        simulaneous synthesis of three types of immunoglobulins.

<LI>JIANG B. & XIANG M      IMMBILIZATION OF ENZYMES OF POLYMER MODIFIED BY
ULTRASONIC IRRADIATION, "Polymer Materials Science and Engneering"
Eur.Plym.J., 1992,28,827-830
        Absrtact-Polystyrene(PS) was copolymerized with metyyl
        methacrylate(MMA) and glycidyl methacrylate(GMA) through
        ultrasonic irradiation. Block copolymers PS-b-PGMA and
        PS-b-P(MMA-co-GMA) were obtained: their compositions were
        determined by Ftir and 'H-NMR. The variation of MMA content in
        PS-b-PMMA with irradiation time was examined. Copolymers
        PS-b-PGMA that PS-b-P(MMA-co-GMA) were used as supports for
        immobilizing trypsin and catalase. It was found that
        PS-b-P(MMA-co-GMA) had a lower capacity for enzyme binding
        because of the presence of MMA units. The trypsin bound on
        PS-b-P(MMA-co-GMA) exhibited an activity about 40% of that of
        free trypsin: if it was bound on PS-b-PGMA, it lost all of its
        activity. Catalase on both copolymers retained roughly 25% of
        its activity.

<LI>GUO S & XU Xi   EFFECT OF MECANOCEMICAL DEGRATION ON RHEOLOGICAL
BEHAVIOR OF PVC,        Plym.Plast Tech Eng., 1994,33(5),605-614
        The rheological behavior of mechanochemically degraded poly
        (vinyl chloride)(PVC) was studied through a Brabender
        plasticorder and capillary rheometer. The experimental results
        show that the degraded PVC has a mush sorter plasticizing time,
        higher plasticizing rate, and lower melt viscosity and glass
        transition temperature as compared with undegraded PVC. The
        results provide a theoretical base for using the low molecular
        weight PVC prepared by the mechanochemical method as plasticizer
        for high molecular weight PVC.

	The main research of this laborotory id focused on rare earth chemistry 
and materials. Four research branches below are emphasized.

	1) Separation chemistry of rare earths. Research is focused on the new 
	   methodes, techniques, and theories of rare earth separation.

	2) Solid state chemistry of rare earths and materials. Research is focused
           on the X-ray luminescent and high-performance light-excited luminescent 
           materials, and the synthesis, properties and applications of composition 
           oxides of rare earth-transition metal.

	3) Coordination chemistry of rare earths. Research are focused on the 
        synthesis, structures, spectra and applications of rare earth compounds,
 	and the roles of rare earth complexes in medicine.

	4) Physical chemistry of rare earths and lanthanide theory. Research are 
	focused on the physical and chemical properties of rare earth complexes, 
	and the studies in electronic structures and chemical bonds of rare earths.

	The main target of the Lab. is to synthesis and develop novel rare earth 
compounds and materials.

<FONT SIZE=5>Multimedia LCD Projectors Bring Internet <br>
Instruction to University Students</FONT><br>
<P>
The growth in demand for World Wide Web access has outpaced many educational institutions ability to fulfill students desire to learn about surfing the net.  Using a multimedia projector to teach students about the Internet gives more students exposure to this information.  By using Sharp LCD projection systems, Florida State University has advanced both its Internet teaching capabilities and general course instruction.
<BR>
Media Specialist Bruce Meintjies, Office of the Dean, instructs university staff members about how to use LCD multimedia projectors in the classroom to visually enhance course work and more effectively reach the students.  By connecting Sharp's XG-E1100U multimedia LCD projectors to a Macintosh or PC-based computer, teachers can reach a larger audience of students to help them learn more about multimedia and the Web in the classroom.  The projectors are also used for video presentations and have replaced overhead projectors as instructional tools.   The university  projects images from the XG-E1100U onto screens with a maximum measurement of 10 feet (measured diagonally).   
<BR>
 "The biggest benefit of using Sharp LCD projectors is that professors find them easy to use, so they can concentrate on teaching," says Meintjies.  "They require very little maintenance.  Currently, we have 27 Sharp projectors around the university.  The majority of auditorium classrooms have the projectors ceiling mounted, while smaller classrooms use A/V and multimedia carts."
<BR>
With the Sharp multimedia projector, professors can "point and click" their way through Web pages, deliver high-resolution presentations, or show video with an image that is bright enough to keep the lights on in the classroom.
<BR>
"The high brightness technology offered by Sharp gives the instructors the added benefit of keeping the lights on while teaching," says Meintjies.  "Previously, students were unable to take notes due to low-level lighting required with other projection systems.  The Sharp projectors deal with this problem beautifully."
<BR>
According to Ron Colgan, general manager of Sharp's Professional LCD Products Group, multimedia projectors are the necessary next step in educational instruction tools. "Using bright, easy to see images in a classroom while teaching gives the instructors more teaching power," says Colgan.  "The decrease in LCD production costs and the relative ease of adapting  hardware platforms allows schools to become a part of the ever-growing world of multimedia." For more information, contact: Bruce Meintjies, Florida State University College of Arts and Sciences, Office of the Dean (904) 644-5264.

<B> Data Confirms Shift to PCs in Education Market </B>
<MENU>
<LI>
New market data released by IDC/LINK, Framingham, Mass. reports that the Windows platform is sweeping the K-12 education market nationwide. Results of the data indicate that 56 percent of new computer purchases during the 1996-97 school year will be PCs running Windows. IDC/LINK also reports that Windows-based PCs are preferred across all schools, regardless of enrollment size. The main reasons for the shift reportedly are greater availability of software for that platform, lower prices, and influential parents who use Windows at home or at work.<A HREF="http:// www.microsoft.com/education/k12">www.microsoft.com/education/k12</A>

Personal computers are becoming increasingly necessary for students to both function effectively in colleges and universities and to compete in the job market upon graduation. Our feature article, "Universal Student Access to Information Resources Technology,"  examines how institutions are responding to the challenge of "universal access" for their students: ensuring that each student can "own" a computer. 
<P>
The February issue also focuses on Windows computing. We include case studies and a Product Guide that covers a wide range of Windows software for the curriculum. A Buyer's Guide includes some of the latest desktops, workstations, notebooks, and palmtops available today. Our Multimedia column contains information on how the application Authorware can help courseware designers employ sound pedagogical strategies.

<P>
<B>Universal Student Access to Information Resources Technology</B> <BR>
<P>
Mark Resmer, Vice President of Information Technology at Sonoma State University, examines the issues surrounding universal access and reviews what institutions are doing to make student ownership of personal computers the rule rather than the exception.
<P>
<MENU>
As Information Technology becomes an increasingly central part of the learning experience for students throughout all disciplines, universities and colleges face a major challenge in ensuring that all students have access to the technological resources that will enable them to realize its full potential to transform their education.
Traditional computer labs simply cannot scale to the point where every student has unlimited access to a computer. Quite apart from issues of cost and physical space, not to mention obsolescence, the quality of access that can be provided in a lab does not equal that which comes from ownership of a computer.
<P>
Let us assume that you currently have a computer on your desk. If someone were to ask you if you would be willing to exchange that computer for one located in a lab at the end of the corridor where your office is located, would you agree to the trade? Even if you were guaranteed access to a machine any time you needed it, a grossly unrealistic expectation at most of our institutions, the answer is almost certainly "no," because of the degree to which you have customized your computer to meet your particular needs and because of the personal information it contains.</MENU>

Simon Hooper, of the Instructional Systems and Technology program at the University of Minnesota, introduces Authorware, the icon-based authoring language used by faculty for cross-platform multimedia development.<BR>
<MENU>
In his book, <I>A Different Kind of Classroom: Teaching with Dimensions of Learning </I>(ASCD, 1992), Robert Marzano suggests that to foster deep and flexible learning, students should engage in activities that will both extend and refine their thinking. Marzano suggests employing strategies that require students to compare and contrast information, to induce principles and deduce consequences, to examine errors and build proofs, and to analyze from personal perspectives and abstract general principles. Yet, how many multimedia products show evidence of such activities? In contrast, many products I have examined do little more than present information to students. Designers seem to be attempting to transmit information into students' minds as effortlessly as possible.<BR>

The causes for the conflict between teaching and learning theory and contemporary multimedia design practice are complex. However, the availability of tools with only limited development capabilities has probably exacerbated the problem. Multimedia developers generally choose from three classes of development tools: programming languages, authoring systems, and authoring languages.<BR>

Full-motion video is being used to teach theology and train future ministers and missionaries. The school incorporates distance learning, video, production studios, and laptop computers to deliver education. Every classroom includes a video information system control unit and monitor or projection system. All of the systems are connected via optical fiber to the video information system in a building dedicated to electronic creativity. An instructor can access DOS or Macintosh CD-ROM applications, VHS recorders, VCR equipment, still video and laser disc players, 16mm and 35mm slide to video machines, and satellite and CATV tuners.<BR>The school operates 48 electronically-equipped classrooms for distance learning that is spread over 14 buildings. The electronic creativity building houses tools for creating video content, a broadcast-quality video studio for local and distance learning, and specially-equipped graduate student study carrels allowing connections to campus resources and external information sources. In addition, notebook computers are used by practicing ministers and missionaries working as far away as Estonia and India who can access the network at any time.<BR><P>For more information, contact: Dr. Kenneth Boyd, Seminary College, Professor of Instructional Media Systems, Asbury Theological Seminary, (606) 858-2310.<BR><P><HR WIDTH=100% SIZE=4 ALIGN=LEFT><P><FONT SIZE=5>Brigham Young University</FONT><P>Humanities Tutorials<BR><p><IMG SRC="images/BYU.GIF"  HSPACE=10 ALIGN=LEFT>Professor Jon D. Green, in the humanities department at Brigham Young University, needed a new way to reach his humanities students. Green saw how most students would plow through a literary work without really deriving any pleasure from what they were studying. He observed that because the students did not directly experience what they were learning, they never really retained the material, and they didn't seem to get any lasting benefit from their courses.<BR>To help address this problem, Green introduced software-based instruction into his classroom. He began to offer his students software tutorials in order to stimulate their enjoyment of the humanities curriculum. Green has designed nine tutorials to help students understand the humanities in the areas of poetry, dance, music, opera, film, drama, sculpture, painting, and architecture. The tutorials are intended to help students develop the perceptual skills necessary to make sense of the works of art they learn about in his classes. The modules also give students access to additional information that can enhance their appreciation of a work of art.<BR>One of Professor Green's tutorials covers ballet, allowing students to review ballet steps by name and definition. Students are shown the steps and can creatively manipulate the moves of a given ballet sequence and create their own dance. Then, they can then actually see the dance performed. Once a student practices recognizing different ballet steps the whole dance comes alive. Professor Green says, "It's like learning a foreign language; it gradually makes sense as you learn the vocabulary." And that is Professor Green's goal: to make sense of the senses involved with experiencing the arts directly. Green recently completed a pilot disc to teach film editing techniques. It involves on-screen definitions and examples of the techniques (e.g., fade, dissolve, match cut) as well as opportunities for linking two shots on screen using different transition devices and actually linking together a series of different shots to create different narrative sequences. Green's film tutorial examines Alfred Hitchcock's classic thriller, The Birds. In the tutorial, students can drag and drop sequences from the movie in different order and combinations, creating their own film, and then compare it to Hitchcock's original by simply pressing a button. <BR>"This kind of learning, in which the terminology and definitions are linked to immediate on-screen examples, and where these new recognition skills can be applied in personally creative ways, opens up a whole new dimension of learning," Green says. <BR>Professor Green and his colleagues are developing the modules for publication, taking advantage of the cross-platform capabilities of Authorware as a development tool. They plan to publish the modules under the title: Exploring the Arts Interactively.<BR><p>For more information, contact: Professor Jon Green, Brigham Young University; (801) 378-2346 or access <A HREF="http://www.byu.edu">http://www.byu.edu</A><P><HR WIDTH=100% SIZE=4 ALIGN=LEFT><P><FONT SIZE=5>California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo</FONT><P>The MultiMedia Research Project has provided a venue for several innovative projects developed by students<BR><p><IMG SRC="images/calpoly.gif"  HSPACE=10 ALIGN=LEFT>The MultiMedia Research Project (MMRP) is a student-organized project at California Polytechnic State University in San Luis Obispo. The Project, which has been on-going for the past six years, grew out of students' needs to bridge the gap between themselves and industry. A number of multimedia projects has emerged under the umbrella of MMRP. Students working on special multimedia projects relating to college course work now have access to a centralized lab, well-stocked with the latest equipment either donated or loaned from various corporate sponsors such as Gerber, NEC, Radius, Epson, Mitsubishi, and PowerComputing among others.<BR>Currently, the MMRP is pursuing three projects. One of them is the 3Dinitiative Project, which will demonstrate virtual applications with spatial sound and 3D approaches. By incorporating sight and sound, the viewer will participate in an immersive and realistic 3D experience via a head mounted display (HMD) with head tracking, a three-space input device and real-time 3D sound.<BR>Another project in place is the Universal Access Map Project. This interactive mapping system project will introduce a kiosk on-screen computing system. The kiosk will provide the most efficient and time saving directional information to the general public. This system will be used in areas such as schools, public buildings, amusement parks, museums, and airports. By incorporating the use of computer animation and video footage, the system will give a 3D orientation of proposed routes.<BR>The third project is the Sustainability Project. Since its inception in the Spring of 1995, the project has accumulated much attention for presenting a holistic methodology of designing structures that would conceivably never have a heating, cooling, or electrical bill and recycle 78% of all water used. The second phase of the project was completed in August that focused on exploring and enhancing the interface. The members of the Sustainability Project are currently working on the implementation of the third phase that will have a much improved interface structure and an increased level of complexity.<BR>In addition to a vast array of multimedia resources, the MMRP also showcases students' projects at various trade shows each year. The projects that have been created at the MultiMedia Research Project lab have been showcased at 42 trade shows including TeleCon, New Media, A/E/C, COMDEX, and INFOCOMM. Through this kind of exhibition, students are able to acquire not only hands-on experience with multimedia, but are able to showcase their ideas to others outside the university.<BR><p>For more information on the MMRP, contact Steve O'Driscoll-Packard or Shawn Jackman, Leadership Committee Members at (805) 756-1494, or access <A HREF="http://www.mmrp.calpoly.edu">http://www.mmrp.calpoly.edu</A>.<P><HR WIDTH=100% SIZE=4 ALIGN=LEFT><P><FONT SIZE=5>Case Western Reserve University</FONT><P>University Network  Instrumental Several Projects<BR><p>At Case Western Reserve University, the implementation of CWRUnet, a strictly fiber optic cable from the main wiring system, has enabled data, voice, and video transmissions. Some key CWRUnet projects have emerged, for example, first- and second-year medical students receive Macintosh PowerBooks as part of their tuition. The students can use their laptops to access the school's electronic syllabus and interactive educational software including A.D.A.M. <BR>Japanese language students have used the network to communicate with students in Waseda University in Japan. The program includes network-transmitted student profiles, complete with brief audio greetings in Japanese. <BR>The university also has CWRUnet-connected multimedia classrooms that allow faculty to activate off-site VCRs, slide viewers, film projectors, laser discs, audio tapes, or other devices with an infrared remote control. Cameras and microphones in one room enable two-way video conferencing. The incoming and outgoing signals pass through CWRUnet cables. In addition, many professors use the network to provide homework hints, with many files containing complex formulas and diagrams. Some faculty use CWRUnet to send video clips of "help sessions" to students who own a personal computer. Students and faculty also use e-mail, course-specific bulletin boards, and Web pages to continue class discussions. CWRU also uses its World Wide Web page as the main electronic gateway to campus information services, which offers one entry point to access to all campus information resources, including a software library, CD-ROM server, library servers, course evaluations, and event listings. The network offers access to the campus' on-line library catalog system, containing information on more than one million holdings, and more than 200 other electronic library catalogs. <br><p>For more information, contact Dr. Raymond Neff, Vice President for Information Services, (216) 368-2000 or access <A HREF="http://litwww.cwru.edu">http://litwww.cwru.edu</A> <P><HR WIDTH=100% SIZE=4 ALIGN=LEFT><P><FONT SIZE=5>Cogswell Polytechnical College</FONT><P>Music Engineering Technology Program<BR><p><IMG SRC="images/cogswell.gif"  HSPACE=10 ALIGN=LEFT>Many colleges offer Music Technology programs, but Cogswell Polytechnical College has a Music Engineering Technology (MusET) program, which is one of the first of its kind in the country. In 1989 the program began based on feedback from companies in the music industry that indicated a growing need for workers that are trained in electrical engineering and in music. The music engineering technology curriculum was designed in conjunction with a number of companies involved in the production of musical instrument manufacturing such as Yamaha and computer software companies including Apple Computer Inc. Most of the faculty had their start in music and then pursued careers focusing on the technology side. Many are from local companies within Silicon Valley. <BR>The MusET program focuses on understanding the mechanics of the technology used to produce the music rather than on producing the music with the technology. In addition, the idea behind the program is that students have a much easier time learning the electronics and digital theory when they see a direct connection to how electronic devices affect sound. Facilities at the school include 24-, 16-, and 8-track recording studios, using MIDI and digital audio systems for synchronous tape, digital recording, and audio for video post production. Students also have access to a 1,800 square-foot performance room with a stage. Individual classroom MIDI stations and sound design labs are also available. <BR>The nearly 70 students currently enrolled receive training in sound design, audio recording, digital signal processing, and MIDI (musical instrument digital interface) specification as well as in traditional electrical engineering training. The music technology component of the MusET program begins with a course in MIDI and then evolves to a series of courses covering the manipulation of sound. Courses in sound design explore traditional forms of music such as frequency modulation as well as new and experiemental forms of music. A series of audio recording courses exposes students to the problems encountered in the analog and digital recording studio environments. In conjunction with understanding the technology and its design, students also create and record music. Courses are also offered in Music Theory, Music History, and Music Literature. <BR>The majority of courses revolve around electronic engineering technology, including courses in Electronic Devices, Electronic Circuits, and Direct and Alternating Currents. In addition, students study computer science with classes in C, Pascal, and others languages. A series of courses in Digital Principles and Applications are offered in which students learn about binary data. Required electronics courses focus on the theory and design of computer cards that record, play back, and manipulate sound. Physics classes are also part of the curriculum and cover topics ranging from Newton's Laws to the Principles of Acoustics. The MusET students also have a variety of electives, from music business to sound reinforcement. <BR>For a senior project students are required to design and construct either a hardware device or a software program, depending on their degree specification. Past projects have included wireless MIDI systems, computer programs linking MIDI to graphics, and one recent projectin which the student designed a digital signal processor for a guitar.<BR><p>For more information, contact: Ted Henderson, Chair of the Music Engineering Technology Program, (408) 541-0100 or access <A HREF="http://www.cogswell.edu">http://www.cogswell.edu</A><P><HR WIDTH=100% SIZE=4 ALIGN=LEFT><P><FONT SIZE=5>Davidson County Community College</FONT><P>Nursing Education with Multimedia<BR><p>Prof. Patricia Shoemaker is using multimedia presentations to teach her nursing students at Davidson County Community College how to care for their patients. "We're trying to take a lecture format and change it into something that is more interactive," said Prof. Shoemaker. By incorporating a variety of images and sounds, she has taken the lecture beyond the traditional. <br>Prof. Shoemaker finds multimedia technology to be an effective teaching tool, especially in trying to convey complex information to non-traditional learners. "Some of us are auditory learners while others are visual learners, and by incorporating sounds and images the visual learners are given a greater opportunity to understand and enjoy the material," she says.<BR>For her multimedia lectures, Prof.  Shoemaker uses Intel's Smart Video Recorder technology, which allows her to capture images from either video tape or video disks. The images can then be edited and imported into Microsoft's PowerPoint presentation program. The presentations are then transferred to disk and displayed on an LCD projector. <BR>In a class section about the eye, Professor Shoemaker's students view videos that show pupils of differing sizes, illustrating normal and abnormal pupil sizes. Shoemaker also uses video of otoscope images to demonstrate the diagnosis of an ear infection. She uses digitized audio to identify and compare varying degrees of abnormality in heart rhythms.<BR>Prof. Shoemaker will do further work with digitized video and plans to digitize the voice of the instructor so that students can listen to the entire lecture at their own pace. She hopes to produce the course on CD-ROM so that students can individually review the areas for which they need more study or be able to move on after they have mastered a topic. <br><p>For more information, contact: Professor Patricia Shoemaker, Chair, Health Technology Division, Davidson County Community College, Lexington, N.C.; (704) 249-8186.<P><HR WIDTH=100% SIZE=4 ALIGN=LEFT><P><FONT SIZE=5>University of Delaware</FONT><P>FOCUS-Distance Learning Program Involves 28 Academic Departments<BR><p>At the University of Delaware, several projects have grown out of the university's FOCUS distance learning program. The program has involved 28 academic departments, produced nearly 100 distance learning courses, offered two degree programs, and received 1,722 enrollments in 12 states. Its use of multiple technologies includes videotable, cable, satellite, compressed video, and interactive television. Each semester, more than 10 percent of the university's faculty teach in video and distance learning environments in the Colleges of Nursing, Arts and Science, Engineering and Human Resources, and in University Media Services, and the Division of Continuing Education. <BR>UD has utilized video in a variety of ways. It has established two-way, interactive connections among the campuses of Newark, Lewes, and Georgetown. Videotape course delivery is available to off-campus students and is used in video broadcasts over the Mind Extension University (ME/U) cable channel and a variety of satellite links. Classes, seminars, conferences, and meetings are available to students at work sites, other universities, and other facilities.<BR><p>For more information, contact Dr. Richard Fischer, associate provost, continuing and distance education, (302) 831-2795,<A HREF="mailto:Richard.Fisher@mvs.udel.edu">Richard.Fisher@mvs.udel.edu</A> or access <A HREF="http://www.udel.edu">http://www.udel.edu</A><P><HR WIDTH=100% SIZE=4 ALIGN=LEFT><P><FONT SIZE=5>Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University</FONT><P>Optical Storage of Student Records<BR><p><IMG SRC="images/EMBRYRIDDLE.GIF"  HSPACE=10 ALIGN=LEFT>Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, a leader in aviation and aerospace education, typically enrolls 5,500 students at residential campuses in Daytona Beach, Fla., and Prescott, Ariz. More than 12,000 students pursue courses in the evening and on weekends through 114 off-campus locations throughout the U.S. and Europe, as well as through computerized instruction linked to the residential campuses. <BR>In an effort to implement a more cost-effective method for storage and retrieval of student registration and flight data records, and to reduce the use of paper, two departments at Embry-Riddle's Daytona Beach campus and one at its Extended Campus headquarters have implemented optical storage solutions. This will replace antiquated microfiche and paper records-systems that used to reside in an 80' x 80' room. "With the same staff, we're able to give better customer support and quicker turnaround time when records are requested. With the old paper system it would take a clerk or student assistant at least 10 minutes to retrieve a student's file," said Danette Moorhead, Manager of User Services and Information Technology. <BR>Last Year, Embry-Riddle's Flight Training Department turned to an optical storage solution to improve compliance with Federal Aviation Administration regulations, which require that each student's records be readily available for review while the student is enrolled, and for two years after graduation. The FAA also requires that every hour of a student's training, both in the classroom and in the air, be documented. In addition, the school keeps flight records on file for up to two years for students who have attended the university but have since left.<BR>Flight records, which are requested daily, contain information such as the flight instructor's evaluation for each flight, comments about student test scores, and information and comments from instructors on the more than 20 different flight courses required for graduation.  <BR>Embry-Riddle chose to organize its vast collection of flight records using a system comprised of a Hewlett-Packard SureStore Optical 20xt LAN Jukebox, a Fujitsu 3096 scanner, a Kofax 9250 card, ImageFiler software from Optika Imaging Inc., and a high-speed laser printer. With the old paper-based storage system, numerous documents for every currently enrolled flight student, and for graduates or released students for two years, were housed in individual hard files. At the end of a student's training a typical file would contain 50 documents. <BR>Using optical jukeboxes has simplified retrieval of records for both the clerks and the flight instructors who utilize the jukeboxes daily. Instructors can now access and quickly browse records right from their workstations by typing in a student's ID number. In the future, the university has plans to use optical jukeboxes for the registration process as well. <BR><p>For more information, contact: Danette Moorhead, Manager of User Services and Information Technology, Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, Daytona, FL; (904) 226-6407 or access <A HREF="http://www.db.erau.edu">http://www.db.erau.edu</A><P><HR WIDTH=100% SIZE=4 ALIGN=LEFT><P><FONT SIZE=5>Georgia Institute of Technology</FONT><P>Interactive Media Technology Center<BR><p><IMG SRC="images/cseye.gif"  HSPACE=10 ALIGN=LEFT>A number of multimedia projects have emerged under the umbrella of Georgia Tech's Interactive Media Technology Center (IMTC). IMTC is a research center under Georgia Tech's Office of Interdisciplinary Programs. Under the direction of Mike Sinclair, Senior Research Engineer, the center has many projects underway incorporating technology, including multimedia medical simulations and research in the study of human movement.<BR>Collaborating with the Medical College of Georgia and the Bioengineering Research Center, IMTC has developed a 3D simulation of surgery on an organic-looking eyeball. Eye Surgery Simulator is a device incorporating virtual reality to simulate the look and feel of eye surgery. The simulator incorporates photo-realistic images of the anterior segment of the eye derived from photographs of bank eyes. The simulator has linear tactile feedback for real-time feel of tool-tissue interaction. The haptic information was based on a model derived from data gathered by monitoring surgical tool forces during procedures performed on a bank eye at the Medical College of Georgia. According to Sinclair, "With the Eye Surgery Simulator, students can practice an operation, such as cataract removal or lens replacement, many times a day; whereas, before students could practice such surgery only a few times a week."<BR>A primary benefit of the simulator is to provide medical students and practicing surgeons with an environment for recursive and time-critical training. The simulator will be used to practice eye surgery in time-critical scenarios and give users the opportunity to learn how to perform under intense pressure. The simulator will also enhance anatomical navigation skills and hand/eye coordination. <BR>The Eye Surgery Simulator consists of a Silicon Graphics Onyx computer, an ophthalmic workstation, a three-axis tactile system, 3D stereoscopic viewer, and virtual instruments including a scalpel, scissors, forceps, and phaco emulsifier. The operating station for the simulator has the viewer interacting with a 3D virtual eye using a virtual surgical instrument controlled by a handheld 6D tracking stylus. Information concerning position and orientation is provided to the computer. The tip of the stylus is connected by thin rigid bars to three torque motors that generate component force feedback in response to the instrument's interaction with virtual tissue. <BR>"The new technology has an array of benefits to medical students including reduced use of cadavers and animals, rare surgical complications can now be part of routine training, and especially difficult surgery can be rehearsed before operating on a patient," says Sinclair. <BR>In addition, the technology gives students the capability to view or review a procedure from several perspectives, including from inside the eye to see if cuts were made at the correct depth and proper angle.<BR>Another application in collaboration with the Bioengineering Research Center and MCG is the Endoscopic Retrograde Choloangio-Pancreatography (ERCP) Surgical Simulator, which replicates an endoscopic procedure in a virtual environment. This application allows medical students to use virtual reality to simulate looking inside a patient's body. The simulation consists of a virtual patient, into which an endoscope is inserted and its position tracked. "It gives students a birds-eye view that would otherwise not be possible with a cadaver or mannequin," says Sinclair. The simulator provides tactile feedback, including both pressure and motion. A real-time view from the endoscope and a view from inside the organ are then rendered on a graphics-intensive computer and presented on a monitor, much like that used in an operating room.<BR>Another project currently underway is the Remote Palpation Simulator. The project will allow doctors to examine patients in remote locations via telecommunications. It employs a six-axis robot arm with a tactile input sensor as the end-effector and a virtual abdomen consisting of skin and a tactile output matrix.<BR>IMTC also is involved in the technology of human motion capture, analysis, modeling, and visualization. A software tool developed at IMTC called Motion Interactive is being used to study dance, and a variety of sports such as diving and the study of various offensive and defensive maneuvers in team handball and hockey. Sinclair explains, "The application provides a time-ordered list of 3D coordinates as if you were documenting a puppet's movement." Researchers can observe any form of human movement to study optimal scenarios such as documenting the power of impact and velocity of a tennis racket when striking a tennis ball.<BR>The Dance Technology Project, a collaboration among IMTC, Georgia Tech Theater, and the Atlanta Ballet, is researching new and innovative ways to integrate technology and the arts, specifically dance. The project's premier performance entitled "Non Sequitur" featured a ballerina performing a dance with an animated virtual dancer. Another project, entitled "Springing Grass," consisted of dancers who wore infrared emitters that were detected by infrared cameras. The results were animated particle trails of the dancer's hand movements on a nearby scrim that illustrate the precise hand and arm positions of the dancer. Future developments will include real-time dancer costuming via projected computer animation onto the live dancers at the Olympic ceremonies this summer.<BR><p>For more information, contact Mike Sinclair, Director of the Interactive Media Technology Center and Senior Research Engineer,<A HREF="mailto:michael.sinclair@oip.gatech.edu">michael.sinclair@oip.gatech.edus</A>.

In their home directories, students can store electronic data rather than carry files around on floppy disks. Each of the 35,000 undergraduate and graduate students can access this service via the university's Public Computing Facilities sites, some 1,000 workstations throughout the campus.  Students with their own PCs can also access the Student Locker home directory service through network connections in many of the student residence halls.<BR>In addition, about 6,000 faculty and staff access a variety of network services through an additional 10,000 network-connected devices located across the campus. "We were stretching our old timesharing systems to meet the computer needs of students, faculty, and staff," says Indiana's principal hardware engineer, John Naab.  <BR>Interested in evaluating the Compaq ProLiant 2000R server, Naab and network systems engineer, Lance Speelmon traveled to the Compaq LAN Test Facility at the company's headquarters in Houston, Texas, where ProLiant servers were tested under Indiana campus configurations.<BR>The simulation helped predict networking needs. "We learned that we needed to split the faculty/staff system in two: one server for messaging support, another for general-purpose file and applications serving," says Speelmon. "By using Novell NetWare 4.1 Directory Services, we can consolidate the staff and faculty needs into one shared Virtual LAN environment, which reduces overhead support requirements."<BR>Both Naab and Speelmon envision a future network that, in addition to the Bloomington campus, connects all eight Indiana University campuses to these services.<BR><p>For more information, contact John Naab, Principal Hardware Engineer, (812) 855-4848 or access <A HREF="http://www.indiana.edu">http://www.indiana.edu</A>.<P><HR WIDTH=100% SIZE=4 ALIGN=LEFT><P><FONT SIZE=5>Indiana University, Bloomington</FONT><P>Multimedia Music Library<BR><p>Indiana University's School of Music will open a new multimedia library in December. Called the Variations Music Information System, the library will make all of the resources reserved for music courses available via digitized audio and full-motion video to all students and faculty on the campus. Users can access information on library resources as well as play back and edit musical scores. Currently under construction, the 55,000-square foot library will include digitized analog sound files which users will play on local workstations and over the campus network.<BR>Already ranked as one of the top music libraries in the country, Indiana University at Bloomington has an extensive collection that includes more than 600,000 books, microfilms, periodicals, and recordings. Scores include 8,000 orchestra scores, 14,000 chamber music scores and parts, and 5,000 opera scores, including some of the first or early editions of these forms of music.Through the project, 140 faculty members and a student body of more than 1,400 students will have complete access to 300 items on course reserve in a digital format as well as full-motion video associated with some music works.  Users can access and interact with the system using workstations equipped with piano keyboards at the library's Media Lab. The lab currently houses 10 workstations, but eventually will have 130, all equipped with piano keyboards. <BR>The Variations project will also have databases of sound and score files that can be retrieved by 100 workstations located throughout the library for the public, with the future capability for 250 additional workstations. The system uses full-motion video and CD-quality audio.<BR>The Variations project will have editing room facilities for creating multimedia projects that support the creation of music notation and the manipulation of sound. The editing room will give students a means to create multimedia projects and have better access for research purposes. Students can insert their own works or the works of others into multimedia presentations consisting of text, sounds, graphics, and full-motion video.In addition to distributing course reserve materials, the project is intended to develop score databases, and provide real-time digitization of analog sources for each student's individual request, allowing them to interactively control the multimedia resources. The project allows retrieval of data sources in all information formats including, text, sound, full-motion video, and graphics.<BR>Currently, the project, in beta, is set-up in the Music Library and Recital Hall Building, but soon the high-speed audio/video network will be distributed to all parts of the Bloomington campus, and  by December 1995 at Indiana University's Purdue campus. Instructors will be able to access materials for classroom use right from their computers.<BR><p>For more information, contact: Dr. David Fenske, Chief Librarian, School of Music, Indiana University, Bloomington; (812) 855-2970 or access <A HREF="http://www.variations.edu">http://www.variations.edu</A>. <A HREF="http://www.-iub.indiana.edu">http://www.-iub.indiana.edu</A><P><HR WIDTH=100% SIZE=4 ALIGN=LEFT><P><FONT SIZE=5>Iowa State University</FONT><P>Revitalizing the Undergraduate Biology Curriculum<BR><p><IMG SRC="images/ISU.GIF"  HSPACE=10 ALIGN=LEFT>A little more than four years ago, a commitment was made at Iowa State University to redesign the undergraduate core biology curriculum, and a large part of this effort included the development of a variety of ways to utilize technology in instruction. <BR>The first step in developing a technology infrastructure to support proposed changes in curriculum was the creation of microcomputer facilities. The facilities, staffed with undergraduate assistants, currently house 55 Macintoshes and 21 DOS machines, and are open 60 hours per week. The project received financial support from a Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) undergraduate grant.<BR>Warren Dolphin, Biology Project administrator in the biology department at Iowa State, explains how faculty built a strategy for using the new technology to solve teaching problems: "As experience was gained in operating the computer labs, giving computer assignments in courses, and teaching the new curriculum, faculty began to ask why students had difficulty in introductory biology." While lecturers in biology traditionally use audiovisuals as well as verbal descriptions of processes, such presentations are ephemeral, lasting only for the lecture period with the students' notes and the textbook as the only records for later study, Dolphin explains. "Several faculty thought that there should be a provision for allowing students to review materials, especially diagrams and pictures. What they needed was a system that could be adopted to allow a thousand or more students to access different lectures at virtually any hour of the day with the possibility of simultaneous access for multiple users from several campus sites."<BR>Iowa State has a highly developed ethernet capability. The solution was to create a large file of biological images on a server where they would be accessible over the network for lecturers to use in creating lectures. The same sytems could be used to make the lectures network-accessible for students.<BR>An image capture facility allows faculty to take a photograph, Kodachrome slide, microscope slide, or any video image and from it create a digital image. An animation development group was also formed, and has produced approximately 40 animations of biological concepts. Being produced in-house, these animations are developed with guidance from content-expert faculty, and are customized for easy use in lectures and in computer labs. <BR>The images are stored on 2.4GB hard drive, which will hold 15,000 images. Currently, there are approximately 5,500 stored images which are indexed by Kudo software. The drive is connected to a restricted server computer which is network accessible 24 hours per day, seven days per week. Any instructor with access privileges can download these images into a Macintosh computer from any network location on campus. This allows teaching staff, scattered throughout five different buildings, to have unlimited access to resource materials for lecture development. Because participating faculty often contribute personal slide collections and other visual materials, the common image bank fosters sharing of teaching materials among a number of lecturers in the beginning courses. <BR>With funds from the HHMI grant, seven PowerBook computers were purchased and loaned to biology instructors. PowerPoint presentation software was installed on the laptops and the instructional technologist conducted workshops to train faculty. With these tools, faculty create visually attractive electronic "slide shows" with images imported from the image bank on the file server and integrate the images with text and tables entered through the keyboard. <BR>Completed lectures are sent over the AppleShare campus network to a built-in computer in the lecture hall. Instructors go to the lecture hall without carrying cumbersome audiovisual materials, simply turn on the ceiling RGB projector, and boot up their materials for lecture delivery. Because the file server is permanently networked, lecturers can also use the Internet in class to call up data sets, or they can intersperse dynamic simulations with the slide show software. <BR>After class, instructors download their lectures to the biology file server. Once deposited, lectures are available for the rest of the semester through any of the hundreds of Macintosh computers on campus that are connected via ethernet. The storage capacity allows banking of about 12 sets of 40 lectures for an entire semester. Instructors adopted the system in general biology, embryology, medical entomology, microbiology, genetics, and general zoology. At the end of a semester, lectures are removed from the hard drive and stored on an archival data tape. When an instructor teaches the course again, lectures can be removed from the archives, modified as needed, and then placed back on the server. This also provides a mechanism for lecturers to share materials. Over time, the department expects to accumulate a set of model lectures that can be modified by individuals who teach the core courses for the first time, thus reducing the tedious side of teaching while allowing for individual creativity. <BR>Computers are also being incorporated into the labs. Students use spreadsheets and graphing programs to analyze data, and all lab reports must be prepared with a word processor. The department uses simulation programs that model complex phenomena such as food chains in aquatic ecosystems, microevolution, and photosynthesis. Students also complete assignments in which they use the Internet. For example, 350 students were asked to use the Internet (via Mosaic) to access a server at the Australian National Botanical Gardens. From a computer on a distant continent, freshman biology students in Ames, Iowa accessed and printed information about the flora of Australia. In fifteen minutes, not only did these students learn a few botanical facts, they also learned how small the world can be using the powerful connectivity facilitated by technology. <BR>Mark Windschitl, the instructional coordinator for biology, comments on how the teaching of biology at Iowa State has changed with the introduction of technology: "We have found that the new technologies have forced us to re-examine what, for decades, has been the norm in how we communicate with students. Our experience clearly demonstrates that as technology becomes integrated into the academic culture, what was once experimental evolves into a highly effective design for productive and powerful learning."<BR><p>For more information, contact: Mark Windschitl or Warren D.

This e-forum is the second experiment connecting students in New York and Georgia by Dr. Jill Swenson at Ithaca College and Dr. Margaret Holt and Dr. Pam Kleiber at the University of Georgia. In Fall 1994, their classes came together in cyberspace to deliberate "People and Politics: Who Should Govern?" <BR>Dr. Swenson remarks, "There is a tremendous sense of disconnection between the public and politics, between the politicians and the press, and between the press and the public. The electronic forum will give student-citizens and student-journalists an opportunity to deliberate in discussions about how we want to govern ourselves."<BR>At Ithaca College in upstate New York, junior and senior journalism students will enroll in a special topics course about campaign coverage with Prof. Swenson this August. Students will critique campaign coverage and consider the methods of public journalism, sometimes called civic journalism and community journalism. An additional seminar of 15 students enrolled in "Issues and the News" will build partnerships with co-curricular and community news media. Students will explore how to improve news coverage of the campaigns. The electronic forum will be used to help students develop new techniques for reporting campaign issues for the college community. The electronic forum will serve as an easily accessible instructional supplement to the classroom via its widely available technology and software.  Swenson says, "With easy and inexpensive access to a computer terminal where students can retrieve e-mail messages, a simple listserv provides the necessary support for moderators and participants who wish to participate in electronic study circles."<BR>The National Issues Forum-Listserv will be organized around a set of readings prepared by the National Issues Forum for August 1996 publication release and titled, "How Do We Want to Govern America?" The non-partisan materials spell out several choices and present various perspectives and positions in debate about the issue or topic. And as Prof. Swenson asserts,  "The point is not to debate about candidates but instead talk about the issues. Issues are more than personalities, policies, partisan conflicts, and events." <br><p>For more information, contact Jill Swenson, Associate Professor, Department of Television-Radio, (607) 274-3632 , e-mail <A HREF="mailto:swenson@ithaca.edu">swenson@ithaca.edu</A>, or access <A HREF="http://www.journalism.wisc.edu/cpn/sections/tools/manuals/electronic_handbook1.html">http://www.journalism.wisc.edu/cpn/sections/tools/manuals/electronic_handbook1.html</A> or access <A HREF="http://www.ithaca.edu or http://www.ug.edu">http://www.ithaca.edu or http://www.ug.edu</A><P><HR WIDTH=100% SIZE=4 ALIGN=LEFT><P><FONT SIZE=5>Mary Washington College</FONT><P>Internet Instruction by Example<BR><p><IMG SRC="images/mwc.gif"  HSPACE=10 ALIGN=LEFT>Dr. Ernest Ackermann, a professor in the Department of Computer Science at Mary Washington College in Fredericksburg, Va., teaches classes and workshops in how to use the Internet. After reviewing all the textbooks on the market, Ackermann found many good books on using the Internet, but did not find one that stressed step-by-step examples and exercises. So, he wrote a book, Learning to Use the Internet; An Introduction with Examples and Exercises, published by Franklin, Beedle, and Associates, to support his classes.<BR>The book features simple "how-to" instructions on the basics of using the Internet, including highlighted sections showing what users would see on the screen, as well as abundant examples and exercises for students to try. The book contains engaging examples and illustrations to keep students' interest.One problem Ackermann anticipated was that with the rapid pace of change on the Internet, much of the information in any printed book about the network can become quickly outdated. So, instead of including supplementary materials on a CD-ROM, Ackermann maintains a Web site to provide updated information for the book. The Web site mirrors the organization of the book, so that users can easily locate information pertinent to a given section of the book.<BR>The book, available since this past spring, has been used  for classes in more than 100 colleges and universities. Ackermann has also developed a teacher's manual to help faculty design tests and assignments, but it will probably not be available on the Internet, given the possibility that students might be able to locate answers through the network.<BR><p>For more information, visit Ackermann's Web site at <A HREF="http://www.mwc.edu/ernie">http://www.mwc.edu/ernie</A> or contact: Dr. Ernest Ackermann, Mary Washington College, (540) 654-1320; e-mail <A HREF="mailto:ernie@oregano.mwc.edu">ernie@oregano.mwc.edu</A>.

Established in late 1993 in collaboration with the MSU/National Science Foundation Engineering Research Center for Computational Field Simulation (ERC), the thrust of the Visually-Coupled Architectural Walkthrough Program is to provide students with the ability to visually experience moving through and around the building and site designs they produce on their laptops, as though these models were actually constructed.<BR>The current implementation of the program calls for students to regularly transfer their 3D CAD models over the campus computer network to an online storage facility at the ERC. This is most frequently accomplished using the network "docking stations" provided within the architecture building. Then, at a scheduled time, the students and design studio instructors gather in the computer visualization classroom at the ERC.<BR>One by one, a member of the project staff imports the student models into a custom-written, high-performance simulation program. This program, which is run on a Silicon Graphics ONYX graphics supercomputer, generates the real-time, high-resolution stereo imagery of the students' CAD models. These images are presented to the students through a display device known as the BOOM (Binocular Omni-Orientation Monitor). As opposed to a standard desktop or laptop computer monitor, this device allows the user to physically move through the design while looking up, down, side to side, and so on, as though he or she were actually  inside of the building or structure. With simple on-the-fly adjustments to the software controlling the simulation, one can vary the scale of the model, lighting characteristics, and numerous other features that affect the visual appearance of the simulation.<BR>The stereo imagery of a student flythrough is concurrently displayed on an 8' x 10' wall screen using a large, full-color, ceiling-mounted projection system. These stereo images are viewed by the other students and faculty  through inexpensive stereo glasses. These full-motion stereo images are also recorded on VHS videotape for evaluation at a later time, as well as in stereo snapshots of particular views found during a flythrough.<BR>These simulation capabilities are used throughout the entire course of a design project, from concept to final design inspection and presentation. Observations by the faculty and project staff, as well as directly from the students, show that in many cases students have gained a higher understanding of their designs, resulting in better thought out, more refined, end products.<BR>In order to further exploit the usefulness of this visualization technique, researchers have developed a lower-end, PC-based visualization system which can be signed out of the architecture library by students and used at their desks in the design studio. Such a system allows students to rapidly evaluate their early conceptual designs without the burden of having to go across campus to the ERC just for a quick look. As the design project progresses and model complexity grows beyond the capabilities of the low-end system, the students can move up to the high-performance system currently in use.<BR><p>You can visit the MSU VR program web page at <A HREF="http://www.erc.msstate.edu/scivi/vr">http://www.erc.msstate.edu/scivi/vr</A>.

The distance learning course, which was launched by Professor John Goebel, was designed to provide advanced placement students with an education matching their capabilities. Among the 20 students who were qualified to take upper level courses, eight students chose the distance learning calculus course offered at North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics, and a handful chose to commute to attend a college course. Two chose to not take any mathematics at all, resigned to accept a curriculum that didn't match their capabilities for mathematics.Students attending the calculus course via the Internet participate in labs and carry out investigations that lead to the discovery of the important calculus concepts needed in order to solve real problems.<BR>Mathcad mathematics software from MathSoft Inc. is used in the course. Prof. Goebel chose the software for its numerical, graphical, and symbolical capabilities, as well as for its interactive e-mail and Internet connectivity. Students turn in assignments that incorporate integrated text, equations, and graphics capabilities. "The students do a lot of writing in the course to explain how they reached particular solutions to assigned calculus problems. Mathcad software provides a way for students to turn in text, files, and graphs all in one document," says Goebel. <BR><p>For more information, contact Professor John Goebel, Mathematics Department, (919) 286-3366 or access <A HREF="http://www.ncssm.edu">http://www.ncssm.edu</A><P><HR WIDTH=100% SIZE=4 ALIGN=LEFT><P><FONT SIZE=5>North Carolina State University</FONT><P>Cyberspace Study Aid for Materials Science<BR><p>Beginning students in materials science at North Carolina State University's engineering department are using an interactive Web site as a virtual laboratory to help them visualize concepts. The project is the brainchild of Dr. John Russ, a visiting professor and research associate in materials science and engineering, and grew out of his belief that students need a more visual approach to understanding difficult scientific concepts. In the past, students had to rely on their imaginations to visualize a 3D molecule from a 2D textbook rendition or chalkboard display. But Dr. Russ says that better alternatives are available in the computer age.<BR>The project originated in 1991 as a  self-paced study aid and supplemental tool for materials engineering students. Dr. Russ later developed Macintosh and Windows CD-ROM versions entitled "Visualizations in Materials Science" (ViMS). As the modules increased, Russ and some of his students developed an accompanying textbook and used HyperCard to facilitate access to the modules. A second version of ViMS was created in 1994 that integrated Theorist from Waterloo Maple Software in Waterloo, Canada to add interactive math capabilities.<BR>In the summer and fall of 1995, with interest in the World Wide Web on the rise, Dr. Russ and his students converted the original HyperCard script to HTML. Today, ViMS has evolved into a cyberspace study aid available to all students taking introductory engineering classes as well as anyone visiting the Web site at NCSU. ViMSweb contains more than 300 worked problems, 700 movies, and 1,500 document pages with hundreds of QuickTime movies, cartoons, animations, simulations, and digitized video clips combined with a highly interactive interface.<BR>The ViMSweb is laid out textbook-style, with chapters and tutorial explanations in the form of interactive notebooks for use with the Maple's "Click & Solve" mathematics package, Theorist. Students can view text, work out problems, and see real-time video clips and animations covering topics in materials science. With the Theorist application, students have the capability to enter values of variables, substitute variables by clicking and dragging, and solve and plot equations. The study aid focuses on the key concepts and methods of solving a problem, rather than presenting rote procedures for attaining a correct response. This allows students to proceed with a strong theoretical background through a difficult course.<BR>Brent Neal, a student who helped with the project, says, "Engineering concepts are so difficult that if a student falls off the train, it's hard to get back on." The ViMSweb study aid is self paced and can be accessed at any time. "There is a strong feeling of having a private tutor available as you use the materials," says Prof. Russ. Comments in the problems help students understand how to approach new situations and avoid common pitfalls. A "Pop-Up Professor" icon liberally sprinkled throughout the various pages offers interesting insights and comments designed to keep student interest high.<BR>A CD-ROM version is also available, containing an interactive hypertext guide that has cross-references to six of the principal textbooks most commonly used in introductory-level materials sciences courses. The CD-ROM is available from PWS Publishing Co. in Boston, Mass.<BR><p>For more information, visit ViMSweb at <A HREF="http://vims.ncsu.edu">http://vims.ncsu.edu</A>, or contact Dr. John Russ, adjunct professor in materials science and engineering, North Carolina State University; e-mail:<A HREF="mailto:john_russ@ncsu.edu">john_russ@ncsu.edu</A>.<P><HR WIDTH=100% SIZE=4 ALIGN=LEFT><P><FONT SIZE=5>Ohio State University</FONT><P>Faculty are developing multimedia applications to help students learn difficult engineering and architectural concepts<BR><p><IMG SRC="images/csohio.gif"  HSPACE=10 ALIGN=LEFT>At Ohio State University (OSU), instructors are developing applications that teach a variety of engineering and architectural concepts. Professor Brooks Breeden from the department of architecture developed MacLARCH for Macintosh and WinLARCH for Windows using Macromedia's Authorware Professional. The courseware modules were designed to help students learn how to solve construction problems in civil engineering and landscape architecture. The application illustrates topics such as road alignment, property traverse surveying, and earthwork cut and fill. Each subject features an interactive presentation with color animation and diagrams, followed by sets of questions about the topic. Short QuickTime movies are used to animate elements such as contour definition. The content is presented in several different formats. One format is a self-test "drill and practice" in which the program randomly generates exercises about a particular topic, and allows the student to choose: "work one for me" or "let me work one."<BR>Another project emerged out of OSU's participation in the NSF-funded Gateway Coalition, Breeden teamed up with Professor George Staab to produce a set of tutorials that focus on engineering mechanics. Their work has resulted in the software that accompanies McGraw-Hill's recent publication of Beer and Johnston's Vector Mechanics for Engineers: Statics. They are now working on software to accompany the companion volume: Vector Mechanics for Engineers: Dynamics, scheduled for publication in Autumn, 1996.According to Breeden, "the programs are especially adept at accurately displaying problems in terms of size and scale." Using Authorware's intuitive display tools, instructors can easily set up and animate a problem, using more than one display if necessary.<BR>Breeden says the increasing ease of use of multimedia products is leading more faculty to participate more closely in the development process. "In the past, multimedia presentations and computer-assisted instructional courseware were programmed by graduate students. Now that more powerful development tools are available, we're seeing more faculty participation in the actual creative development process. With Authorware, we can design applications as we develop them. It's a perfect example of object-based programming-you can fine-tune parts of a course, and stop and start the portion you're working on without having to recompile the program between runs."<BR>Breeden and Professor John Simpson, who teaches landscape architecture at the university, also used Authorware to create "Ethical Dilemmas in Environmental Stewardship," which explores issues such as overfishing, the arms race, and feeding starving populations as well as other social dilemmas related to the environment.<BR><p>For more information, contact Professor J.

Providing a solution to the problem is the German by Satellite (GBS) program, which uses distance learning techniques combined with computer-based and computer-assisted instruction that is designed to give students at high schools without a German teacher a college preparatory education that otherwise would not be possible.<BR> GBS, created by Professor Harry Wohlert of Oklahoma State University, stretches one semester of college German into a one-year high school course. Schools participating in the program receive twice-a-week broadcasts from Wohlert that stress student-teacher interaction. The broadcasts are a fast-paced sequence of lecture, speaking, and listening practice based on authentic German material and cultural vignettes. To accommodate the fact that an audience loses concentration periodically-even a class that is interested in the subject material-the broadcasts include frequent breaks that consist of German commercials and cultural material. These breaks provide a mental pause for students, while continuing to focus on the subject matter.Hundreds of schools across the country participate in the broadcasts, with one or two schools volunteering as hosts for each session, working interactively with Professor Wohlert either at the television studio at Oklahoma State, or through a two-way audio system.  <BR>On the three weekly non-broadcast days, the GBS program calls for students to work with computer programs, textbooks, vocabulary quizzes, chapter tests, and other instructional materials. Students are continually involved in language practice, far longer than is possible in a conventional classroom setting, says Wohlert. Instruction can be delivered by teachers who do not know how to speak German. For assistance, students at participating schools can call a toll-free number, eight hours a day, to reach a native German-speaking instructor.<BR>GBS integrates computer technology into the curriculum in several ways. For vocabulary practice, GBS uses Macintosh computers with digitized speech. To check pronunciation, students use a speech recognition program that compares their input with that of native German speakers.<BR>To deliver instruction to advanced students and to those needing extra help, Professor Wohlert uses a Macintosh computer with Creative Technology Ltd.'s ShareView Plus collaborative computing system, which allows transfer between computers of audio, video, and data over normal copper wire telephone lines. With the system, Professor Wohlert can interact with his students as if they were in the same room with him, allowing him to use one-on-one teaching methods.<br><p> For more information contact: Professor Harry Wohlert, Oklahoma State University, Stillwater, OK; (405) 744-7109 or <A HREF="http://pio.okstate.edu">http://pio.okstate.edu</A><P><HR WIDTH=100% SIZE=4 ALIGN=LEFT><p><FONT SIZE=5>Old Dominion University</FONT><P>TELETECHNET<BR><p>At Old Dominion University in Norfolk, VA, students can take part in one of the largest distance learning programs in the U.S. The program entitled TELETECHNET is a satellite, interactive television network through which Old Dominion transmits 80 live and interactive courses to approximately 2,000 students across the state through the Virginia Community College System. Implemented in 1994, TELETECHNET is now accessible to 16 community colleges. Students take the first two years of their college education through the community colleges and the final two years of their college education through TELETECHNET. Students can receive baccalaureate degree programs in areas such as nursing, business management, and engineering technology. The program also has far reaching economic implications in areas where residents have not had opportunities to access higher education.

Learning is facilitated by collaboration and interaction among students and instructors.<BR>A course called Workshop Calculus is based on the premise that students learn more by doing and talking about calculus than by listening and watching. Joseph Ecker, a professor in the department of mathematics, previously taught calculus only in a traditional lecture, lab, and recitation format. It became evident to him that most of the learning was going on in the computer lab setting, so Ecker asked, "Why not extend this mode of learning to all aspects of this course?"<BR>The new studio calculus class incorporates Maple software, Waterloo Maple Inc.'s symbolic computation product. Ecker says, "Students in the computer lab talk about and do calculus instead of just listening and watching. They are arguing about and trying different problem solving approaches as well as peer teaching and collaborative learning." In addition, students interactively explore the visual aspects of calculus and develop graphs using Maple. The instructor receives constant feedback on each student's understanding and can provide immediate help.<BR>The studio calculus course accommodates approximately 100 students and meets twice a week. Students work together in pairs or small groups and bring their own notebooks loaded with the software. The school plans to open a new notebook computer lab for use in this course as well as in studio physics and in introduction to engineering analysis.<BR>Homework and projects in the studio course incorporate Maple software. "Students are becoming sophisticated Maple users," says Ecker. "They are learning how to develop good judgment."<BR>Faculty at Rensselaer appreciate the interactive aspects of teaching in which students actively participate in their education. "We want the students to be involved, interacting with each other, interacting with the faculty, and interacting with the topics being covered in the course," says Ecker. He comments that one of the most exciting results of teaching in the studio setting is the enthusiasm he sees in his students. "Suddenly the students are more inquisitive and eager to ask questions. Every day I see the differences in how students respond in the lecture and studio settings. In the lecture room, they are passive. In the studio, they are participating."<BR>A Studio Calculus text published by HarperCollins College Publishers will be released this spring.

Complete with state-of-the art equipment, faculty and students have used the facility for classroom projects and to create interactive courseware.<BR>The area has helped many undergraduate and graduate students prepare in-class multimedia presentations. These can be as simple as scanning pictures onto a CD-ROM for playback later or as complex as the projects worked on by Professor Robert Kulo's communication class.<BR>Working with Mr. Vincent Integlia, the Multimedia Supervisor, the class produced presentations involving writing and editing scripts, filming the content, taping voice-overs, selecting appropriate music, and using multimedia technology to create fade-ins and multiple images.<BR>According to student Patricia Austin `97, an English major who is hoping to pursue a career in broadcast journalism, the project has provided her with a greater insight into the technical aspects of production, and valuable career experience that would have been impossible without the facility.<BR>"With multimedia, it's almost a disservice to students if you don't integrate it into your curriculum," says Mr. Integlia. "The area is for students to come explore, as Dr. Kulo's class did, and really see what multimedia is."<BR>The facility is comprised of equipment that includes computers with CD-ROM drives, scanners, laserdisc players, recordable CD-ROM players, mixers, VHS recorders, stereo equipment, microphones, speaker systems, projection equipment, and digital cameras as well as a plethora of multimedia authoring software.<BR>Once multimedia presentations are authored on the recordable CD-ROM player, faculty and students can access the materials from multimedia carts,  available to faculty and students.<BR>The ten multimedia carts have the capability to transport everything necessary for showcasing a multimedia presentation. Included in each cart is a computer, a set of stereo speakers, a laserdisc player, and projection equipment. <BR>Projects that have emerged from the facility include a CD-ROM tour of the University's McKillop Library. Users can look at maps of all floors and click on icons to find out more information on departments or rooms within the structure.  <BR>Another project grew out of Salve Regina's annual Global Fun Day. The cultural diversity project on CD-ROM allows students to click on different countries to learn more about the various cultures. The project, which was nominated for George Washington University's Jere Trout Award that recognizes multimedia excellence, was produced in cooperation with local elementary school students of various cultural backgrounds and experiences. To create the project, Salve Regina University students worked with thirteen children to present two-minute documentaries of their heritage. The audio portion of the CD-ROM was created by students studying music at Salve Regina. <BR><p>For more information, call Vincent Integlia, Multimedia Supervisor, (401) 847-6650, ext. 2167.<BR>The Multimedia Production Area Web Site can be accessed at the URL <A HREF="http://198.49.179.4/pages/integlia/multi.html">http://198.49.179.4/pages/integlia/multi.html</A>.<P><HR WIDTH=100% SIZE=4 ALIGN=LEFT><p><FONT SIZE=5>San Francisco State University</FONT><P>Fiber Optic Video Transmission System<BR><p><IMG SRC="images/sfsu.gif"  HSPACE=10 ALIGN=LEFT>Shortly after officials at San Francisco State University learned that First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton wished to deliver a commencement speech to their 1995 graduating class last May, they realized that they would have to make special preparations for her visit.<BR>The First Lady's SFSU appearance, one of only three commencement addresses made by Ms. Clinton in 1995, created two primary problems. First, how would the university accommodate everyone expected to attend the graduation ceremony? And second, if the university set up remote viewing sites in conference rooms and theaters to solve the first problem, how would they get the video feed to those locations?<BR>Typically, the university has very large graduating classes and, for that reason, holds commencement ceremonies across campus at Cox Stadium. Though the football stadium has a capacity of about 13,000, it quickly became evident that more than 20,000 people were interested in attending, including a particularly large throng from the media. To make the situation even more challenging, engineers wanted to enhance the commencement production by adding three additional cameras.<BR>At the time, SFSU had six fiber  optic cables in place, of which only four were in working condition. Four were not enough to handle all the required connections, but engineers decided not to add more, because it was too expensive and they didn't have enough time.<BR>The decision was made to use a four-channel fiber optic video transmission system from Physical Optics Corp. of Torrance, Calif. For a total cost of about $5,000, video engineers at SFSU employed the plug-and-play multiplexer to simultaneously transmit four separate video signals over one multimode fiber optic cable, thereby eliminating the need for additional fiber. Because the system needs no optical or electrical adjustments, the installation was done quickly and easily.<BR>Using this approach, four camera signals were routed through coaxial cable from the field up to the stadium press box. From the press box, the signals went into the POC transmitter box and onto fiber optic cable. They then traveled across campus to the audio/visual instructional television center and into the POC receiver box, where the signals were converted back to coaxial cable. Next, the video signals were sent to frame synchronizers and then to the production switcher where they were mixed and captioned. At that point, the video signal was recorded, sent to five remote campus viewing locations (three theaters, the student union, and main gymnasium) and back to the stadium for display on rented Sony Jumbotrons. The signal also was sent by microwave to Viacom Cablevision in San Francisco so that it could be televised on cable.<BR>Audio was sent through existing dry telephone pairs but, because the phone lines are noisy and limited in number, SFSU recently ordered a POC eight-channel digital audio transmitter/receiver pair to replace them. Unlike other video and audio links, the POC units can be switched between different fibers without any adjustment, dramatically reducing down-time in the event of a fiber failure or reconfiguration.<BR>In addition to commencement ceremonies, the video extenders are being used in other campus capacities as well, including television broadcasting and distance learning. In the television broadcasting program at SFSU, students learn writing, producing, directing, newscasting, and sportscasting, as well as the behind-the-scenes technology.<BR>During the soccer season, students used the POC boxes on a field at the far end of campus. It was the first time television broadcast students had ever covered soccer, and it was made possible largely because engineers were able to feed multiple television signals down one optical fiber. This was particularly important at the soccer field because very few fiber cables are located on that part of campus.<BR>The POC video multiplexers are also useful for distance learning. San Francisco State University currently trades courses with most other CSU campuses and with many UC campuses. As SFSU continues to develop in this area, the POC units will be used for sending video and audio signals from classrooms back to the switching facility where they can be transmitted to the distance learning network.<BR><p>For more information, contact: Doug Smith, television engineer, Audio/Visual Center, San Francisco State University; 1600 Holloway Avenue, San Francisco, CA 94132; (415) 338-2639; Fax (415) 338-7255; e-mail:<A HREF="mailto:dsmith@sfsu.edu">dsmith@sfsu.edu</A> or access <A HREF="http://www.sfsu.edu">http://www.sfsu.edu</A><P><HR WIDTH=100% SIZE=4 ALIGN=LEFT><p><FONT SIZE=5>Seattle University</FONT><P>Training Counselors with Video Technology<BR><p><IMG SRC="images/seattle.gif"  HSPACE=10 ALIGN=LEFT>The department of counseling and school psychology at Seattle University has been training counselors for nearly four decades. During the 1950s and 1960s, the emphasis was on training candidates for school counseling positions. Now many additional areas of have emerged, ranging from addiction studies to pastoral counseling. The school uses video technology as a means to train counselors in all of these diverse areas.<BR>Prior to using video technology, students in training had to depend on tape recordings as a means to perfect their verbal skills. The audio tapes provided feedback on content and tone of voice, but of course lacked the important visual elements such as body language, eye contact, and overall presentation. But by the mid-1960s, videotaping was initiated and all but took the place of one-way mirrors. The practice of hooking up a video camera to a monitor in another room enabled viewing without interaction and class observation. Now the level of communication is completely interactive, and students can view, hear, ask questions when appropriate, and tape sessions for further analysis. The counseling department currently uses 10 Canon VC-C1 communication cameras in its eight clinical rooms: three large rooms and five small rooms. Two of the cameras are placed in smoked, glass domes on the ceilings of the larger rooms, and the smaller rooms are configured exactly the same way, but with only one camera. A central location accommodates the main viewing center for counseling instructors to monitor each of the eight clinical rooms.The viewing center contains a 42-inch video monitor, an LCD touch panel control system, and two VCRs. The instructor can initiate discourse with the students in clinical rooms by using the touch panel. Within this central location are eight viewing stations connected to each of the clinical rooms, and students can monitor sessions and observe instruction that is given to other students in any given clinical room. The touch panel can be used to control volume, movement of the VC-C1, and the functions of the VCR. Each of the eight student viewing stations has a 27-inch video monitor, two VCRs, an LCD touch panel control system, and three audio headsets. The VCRs are used to tape sessions in progress that can be analyzed later in detail by the instructor and student. The entire facility was made to resemble a professional office, complete with a waiting room for clients.<BR><p>For more information, contact Hutch Haney, Department of Counseling and School Psychology, (206) 296-5751 or access <A HREF="http://www2.seattleu.edu">http://www2.seattleu.edu</A><P><HR WIDTH=100% SIZE=4 ALIGN=LEFT><p><FONT SIZE=5>Southern Methodist University</FONT><P>New A/V Systems at the Cox School of Business<BR><p><IMG SRC="images/smu.gif"  HSPACE=10 ALIGN=LEFT>At Southern Methodist University Cox School of Business this past spring, a natural disaster prompted the decision to quickly upgrade the school's audio-visual facilities. On the night of May 5th, 1995, a record-breaking rain and hailstorm swept across Dallas, destroying millions of dollars worth of property. A flash flood swept through the bottom floor of the Business School, leaving several classrooms and teaching theaters submerged. The administration decided to totally revamp and upgrade the school's classroom audio visual and distance learning systems.<BR>"In a way the flood was, for the school, a blessing in disguise," remarked Tom Barry, formerly Associate Dean For Academic Affairs at the Edwin L. Cox School of Business, and now Vice President for Academic Affairs at SMU. "It prompted us to undertake, in one fell swoop, what would have undoubtedly been done piece-meal had the flood not wreaked so much damage in one night."The Georges Auditorium, on the bottom floor of the business school building was completely destroyed by the flood. So contractors gutted and  redesigned the room from the ground up. The new auditorium now provides students and professors state-of-the-art video, Internet, and Distance Learning capabilities.<BR>Essential to the design of the new auditorium was the hardwiring of each of the 156 desks in the room for AC, with computer network connections to follow, so that each student in the classroom can be online when the need arises. Despite a certain concern that students in the back row would be Net-surfing through entire lectures, student interaction through network connections was one of the goals of the room redesign. <BR>Key to the auditorium's projection system is a Sony VPH-1292Q video/data projector, set up in a rear-projection format behind a 9 x 12 acrylic rear-projection screen. The podium houses a computer and touch-panel Control system, as well as a Sony VID-P 100 Document Camera- one of the room's new Distance Learning tools. The document camera sits in a large slide-out compartment, and, when not in use, slides into the unit and is out of view. Another Distance Learning tool is the SoftBoard, from Microfield Graphics Inc. The SoftBoard converts the analog handwriting of the instructor into digital information. <BR>During the month before the flood, the school had already completed installation of audio-visual systems in six of the SMU business school classrooms. Each of these classrooms-all  untouched by the flood-is outfitted with a Sony VPH-1252Q Data Projector suspended from the ceiling with a monitor mount, a single Soundsphere speaker, and a custom-designed lectern that houses all of the computer, video, and control systems. The classroom systems were designed by Dallas-based Bauer Audio Visual.<BR>John Criswell, Director of SMU's Business Information Center and a member of the university's Distance Learning Committee, pointed out the importance of the new educational systems. "This equipment is essential to Distance Learning because we can capture, with tools like the SoftBoard or the document camera, all of the presentation, just as a student or professor in the room experiences it, and we can send the entire presentation to any other site, anywhere in the world."<BR><p> For more information, contact: John Criswell, Director of the Business Information Center or Philomena Jones, Assistant Director, SMU Cox School of Business, (214) 768-2000 or access <A HREF="http://www.smu.edu">http://www.smu.edu</A><P><HR WIDTH=100% SIZE=4 ALIGN=LEFT><p><FONT SIZE=5>Southwestern Oklahoma State University</FONT><P>Distance Education Over an Optical Fiber Network<BR><p>Southwestern Oklahoma State University has implemented an optical fiber network for distance learning between its two campuses that are 60 miles apart. The network also links sites at two high schools, a junior college, and a vocational technical center.<BR>"We implemented the fiber optic network to virtually stabilize the population of Oklahoma. We felt we needed to do something because the population here has seen a major dip. That's because now one farmer can do what it took 20 farmers to do 10 years ago," says Dr. Lessley Price, director of tele-learning at the university.<BR>Population has declined as much as 10 percent in the last year, and the university is finding it difficult to fill teaching positions. But with distance education, the schools are being sustained by sharing resources such as teachers. "We felt we needed to give the people an opportunity to have an education, and through distance learning, students in rural areas save commuting time," Price says. Some of the classes offered include Teaching in the Secondary School, and Teaching in the Elementary School.<BR>Classroom components of the system include a camera at the front and rear of the classroom, an overhead camera, and camera controls located at the host and remote facilities. The controls can be manipulated by a portable infrared control panel that enables tilt, pan, zoom capabilities at the facilities. In addition, four large monitors are located at each facility.<BR><p>For more information, contact: Dr. Lessley Price, Southwestern Oklahoma State University, (405) 774-3149.<P><HR WIDTH=100% SIZE=4 ALIGN=LEFT><p><FONT SIZE=5>St. Petersburg Junior College</FONT><P>Exploring Poetry with Virtual Reality<BR><p><IMG SRC="images/stpete.gif"  HSPACE=10 ALIGN=LEFT>Assistant Professor David Hartman, who teaches in the communications department on the St. Petersburg/Gibbs campus of St. Petersburg Junior College in Pinellas Park, Fl., faced a dilemma: how to teach poetry to students who essentially are non-readers. Having been faced with indifference from students on a subject he loved, he felt it was time to create a project that would allow students to experience the feeling of the poem. <BR>Hartman wanted students to virtually experience the process of drafting a poem by viewing a sampling of critical responses and adding their own critical responses. The experience could stimulate students to write poems themselves, he hoped. Hartman and computer graphics specialist Tim Brock have combined efforts to create a virtual reality project with the working title Petals, which is an interactive exploration of Ezra Pound's poem "In a Station of the Metro." <BR>Currently in progress, the project provides students with an interactive approach to reading the poem. It combines studying the etymology of key words, visually experiencing the key words, understanding the hidden meanings and implications of literary images, and learning about Ezra Pound's life and his creative process when drafting this particular poem. Students can select different words to explore, and see how they change the meaning of the poem. <BR>To navigate to different sections of Petals, students use a HyperCard stack created by Brock, that has a subway metaphor. The stack includes a location in which critics give their views of the poem. Using a HyperCard link to an Internet web browser, the stack allows students to access the Ezra Pound home page on the World Wide Web.   <BR> From the HyperCard stack, students can link to a Virtus WalkThrough Pro application. In the application, also created by Brock, students can enter a virtual environment where the poem comes to life with graphic images and QuickTime moves. The virtual environment consists of a path students can travel down where they see key words in the poem broken down into their main grammatical units and view images associated with each word. For example, if the student selects the word "face," Virtus WalkThrough Pro displays a face on one portion of the virtual path and shows the Latin roots of the term. Hartman says that by viewing images evoked by the words in the poem, students can see what may have triggered Pound's imagination.In addition, for each key word in the poem, students can substitute four or five other words. Students could, for example, replace the word apparition with phantasm or spirit. When students have replaced all the key words, they are combined into a new poem. The images associated with the new words then are combined in the virtual environment, which students can travel through and see how the meaning of the original poem changed.Assistant Professor Hartman will begin testing Petals in his composition classes this fall.<BR><p>For more information, contact: Assistant Professor David Hartman, Communications Department, St. Petersburg/Gibbs Campus, (813) 341-4754, or Tim Brock, Instructional Technology, St. Petersburg Junior College, Allstate Center, (813) 341-4517.<P><HR WIDTH=100% SIZE=4 ALIGN=LEFT><p><FONT SIZE=5>State University of New York, Stony Brook</FONT><P>Ecology, Conservation Biology, and Wildlife Management<BR><p><IMG SRC="images/ramas.gif"  HSPACE=10 ALIGN=LEFT>Teaching ecology students population equations is difficult by itself. But any attempt to convey the complexity of predicting the future of endangered and threatened species is much more difficult. To instruct students in this area, Dr. Lev Ginzburg, a professor at the State University of New York, Stony Brook, uses RAMAS ecological software that provides population-based simulations that can predict outcomes for endangered species based on various factors. Since 1982, he and two former graduate students, Dr. Scott Ferson and Dr. H. Resit Ak&ccedil;akaya, have combined efforts to develop RAMAS, a software library for building population and metapopulation models. The product consists of six models for understanding population growth.RAMAS is used as part of the curricula of three courses at the State University of New York at Stony Brook, in undergraduate and graduate ecology, and in computer programming and modeling for biological problems. The application enables students to build their own population models, simulate the impact of various complex interactions within given parameters, and compute the results. Students can calculate the expected population based on varying factors, determine the reliability of the estimate, and calculate the probability that a given population will fall below a specified threshold during or after a particular time period. <BR>At the undergraduate level, the program is used as a guided simulation to teach the fundamentals of population dynamics. Possible behaviors exhibited by natural populations are illustrated with sample data sets on spotted owls, gorillas, and brook trout. For example, students study the spotted owls' chance of recovery from its current threatened status. Students could also study the impact of actions such as captive breeding and re-introduction to natural habitat patches, and whether such actions would have more success with one large habitat patch or two smaller ones.<BR>One of the projects taught by Dr. Ginzburg analyzed the effect of crocodile farming on the crocodile population. Students were required to write a paper on how they would set up a crocodile farm. Using  RAMAS, students could determine which method was the least harmful and which method would be detrimental and lead to extinction of the crocodile. By calculating various factors affecting population growth, it was determined that harvesting adult crocodiles actually had a minor effect compared to the devastating  impact of harvesting baby crocodiles. Students were required to set up model simulations and determine the best way to run a crocodile farm and then write a paper on how they would manage the farm using RAMAS in the computer laboratory. <BR>Computer technology has greatly enhanced the curriculum. Dr. Ginzburg points out that most realistic models are too complex, so we are forced to use computer simulations. Students can easily simulate population growth and fluctuations on a computer. Ginzburg still believes in studying symbolic mathematics on a blackboard, but that isn't so much in the forefront now, with the advent of software for the curriculum. Students at the undergraduate level are much more interested and receptive when computers are used in the classroom, and showing simulations on a computer makes the information more immediate and realistic.<BR>RAMAS models incorporate species-specific data to predict future changes in population and assess the risk of population extinction or explosion,  and the chances of recovery from a disturbance. RAMAS/age models fluctuations in simple age-structured populations. RAMAS/stage is stage-based modeling of species with complex life histories, such as plants or insects. RAMAS/GIS is used to link geographic information system software to a metapopulation model, and RAMAS/metapop and RAMAS/space are used for building spatially structured metapopulation models for species that live in multiple patches. RAMAS/ecotoxicology and RAMAS/time models are being developed.RAMAS is currently used in approximately 70 courses in 25 countries in wildlife management and conservation biology: courses which were non-existent two or three years ago.<BR> Drs. Ak&ccedil;akaya, Ferson, and Ginzburg plan to focus on undergraduate teaching with RAMAS, with the soon-to-be-released book/disk package covering an entire semester of ecology called Introduction to Population Ecology: Principles and Computer Exercises. Students exposed to RAMAS early on will be at an advantage when they enter the work force, since RAMAS is a widely used tool in research and management today.<br><p>For more information contact Applied Biomathematics; (800) 735-4350 or fax (516) 751-3435.

The application, entitled Crime and Punishment, simulates a real-life courtroom through digitized video of actors playing the roles of prosecutor, defense attorney, defendant, and victim. By tracking the sentencing decisions of users, who play the role of the judge, the software helps determine whether cases that are identical can result in different sentences. <BR>The students are presented with a total of six different cases ranging from a sexual assault on a minor to a case involving grand larceny shoplifting. According to one of the developers, Prof. Kent Portney, the application allows students and instructors to analyze whether there are patterns of bias within a given group of students. Portney began using the software in a course entitled "Judicial Politics." Portney observes, "The application is an experiment in human bias. When we first began using it this past semester, we clearly saw bias in the classroom and it was quite a learning experience for the students." <BR>The simulation involves students taking a seat on the bench and judging a case in which the instructor can manipulate case characteristics including the defendants' race, gender, appearance, or manner of speaking. In any given case, a defendant could be black or white, male or female, dressed in street clothes or a prison jumpsuit, animated or subdued.<BR>The CD-ROM application, which currently runs on a Power Macintosh will be available for Windows later this summer.

The program grew out of a need for health care professionals to develop a business sense and to be able to use statistics to analyze and accommodate future trends affecting the health care field. In the past, health care professionals simply needed a medical degree to succeed in their chosen field. But Dr. Carlton Scott, a professor at the Graduate School of Management at U.C. Irvine, observes that the times have changed for health care professionals.<BR>The program is attended by physicians, nurses, and administrators. In Prof. Scott's health care statistics course, offered as part of the program, students learn statistics covering topics such as the survival rate of hospitals, or what effects budget cuts will have on the health care industry. All students are given the latest Toshiba notebook computer, along with the SPSS Graduate Pack for statistical analysis from SPSS Inc. in Chicago, Ill. They study a broad range of statistics with the more than 50 high-resolution graphs supported in the software. The software guides students through specific procedures, including "how to enter data" and "which statistic to use."<BR>In one activity in Prof. Scott's class, students plot HMO versus private insurance claims to analyze how different types of insurance affect the industry. The SPSS Graduate Pack, specifically designed for students, comes with a spreadsheet-style Data Editor to make data management easier.Prof. Scott points out that before the computer packages were used, students merely looked at the data prepared on paper by the instructor. Now students can instantly develop their own charts and graphs. They can immediately see how a change in one number will effect the graph. The students can calculate health care statistics using pictorial statistics, histograms, and regression displays.<BR>The software is integral to Prof. Scott's course and is used in all statistical calculations by the students each day class is in session. Typically, students begin the class by downloading files from the server.<BR>Students conduct various other investigations. In a study of waiting room time, they plot out the numbers on a histogram, comparing the waiting times patients must endure at various clinics, and they generate various pictorial displays and forecasts. The class then engages in a discussion on the effects of waiting time on the industry as a whole. Prof. Scott and his students use the software to forecast and analyze variables affecting surgical services. Students plot out the numbers to determine what effect, if any, the seasons have on surgical procedures and how hospitals can prepare for and accommodate patient demand. In the past, the health care industry had no easy way to prepare for changing trends. Any attempt at forecasting would take mounds of paper and large amounts of time. Prof. Scott points out, "It would have been far too tedious and would have taken an enormous amount of grunt work."<BR>Students also analyze which areas in the country are going to need additional health care workers, hospitals, or additional beds. They can use SPSS to generate statistics including logistic regression, MANOVA, loglinear, hiloglinear, unconstrained nonlinear regression, constrained nonlinear regression, GLM-type loglinear, probit, Kaplan-Meier, and Cox regression.Prof. Scott sees relevance for the MBA Health Program as something that is necessary due to potential economic shifts. "All of a sudden, health care professionals must be cognizant of the costs involved in providing health care," says Prof. Scott. U.C. Irvine's MBA in Health Sciences is one of only three such programs offered in the U.S., but other schools may follow suit as the demand grows for medical professionals to balance their medical education with a knowledge of business and marketing.<BR><p>For more information, contact Dr. Carlton Scott, Graduate School of Management, University of California, Irvine, (714) 824-5336 or access <A HREF="http://www.uci.edu">http://www.uci.edu</A><P><HR WIDTH=100% SIZE=4 ALIGN=LEFT><p><FONT SIZE=5>The University of Georgia's College of  Veterinary Medicine</FONT><P>Neurologic Examination of the Dog and Cat<BR><p><IMG SRC="images/ugv.gif"  HSPACE=10 ALIGN=LEFT>Dr. Craig Greene of the University of Georgia's College of Veterinary Medicine in Athens, Georgia, in conjunction with Allison Lucas Wright, medical illustrator and Dr. John Oliver, created an interactive, computer-assisted videodisc tutorial designed to teach neurologic examination of cats and dogs. Used in a course entitled Veterinary Neurology, third-year undergraduate students study material that includes selected aspects of neurologic findings using motion video from 20 cases seen at the University Veterinary Clinic. In addition, animated motion sequences of neurologic pathways and still images of neuroanatomy and neuropathology are used as well. <BR>Prior to using the videodisc series, graduate students studying to become veterinarians were constrained on many levels. First was the limited and random availability of diseased dogs and cats for students to examine. Second, the instructor's ability to thoroughly assess each student's neurologic interpretation individually was limited to only one instructor and one set of audiovisual resources for an entire class of 80 students. Examinations on neurologic localization involves the student being given a set of signs and clinical history; then they are asked to localize the lesion. "It is difficult to evaluate the thought process of each individual student used in reaching their conclusion," says Dr. Greene. And third, these two problems together left Dr. Greene with the opinion that students may be entering the workforce unprepared. <BR>In the first year, students are introduced to neural anatomy. By the third year, veterinary students are taught to localize nervous system lesions in diseased patients. Due to the time lapse between the first and third year, Dr. Greene's concern were forgetting and not integrating what was learned in the first year. Prior to the use of interactive technology, a 25-contact-hour course was the only formal instruction in the use of the neurologic examination in the clinical setting. Subsequent application of these techniques occurred in the senior year rotation on medicine and surgery. <BR>Realizing he needed a solution to better prepare veterinary students, Dr. Greene authored an interactive tutorial that would enable students to become adept at examining and assessing neurologic findings on dogs and cats. The tutorial, entitled "Neurologic Examination of the Dog and Cat: An Interactive Videodisc Autotutorial," allows students to see spontaneously diseased animals and the neurologic deficits created by naturally occurring lesions. Students can observe movement and responses to sensory and motor stimulation which can then be recreated over and over again. <BR>The program is divided into eight sections: Introduction, Mental Status, Gait and Posture, Postural Reactions, Spinal Reflexes, Cranial Nerves, Sensation, and Help. Essential topics are highlighted for students, the grading scheme for each of the six components of a neurological exam are explained, and terminology is defined. <BR>Case materials consist of 8mm movies and videotape of dogs and cats with naturally occurring neurologic disorders, transferred to a master videodisc. Allison Lucas Wright using Macromedia Director enhanced the videodisc further by incorporating animated displays, motion sequences of neurologic pathways, graphic illustrations, as well as still images.<BR>The interactive tutorial depicts movement disorders and responses of the patient to neurologic testing, reviews nervous system pathways and neurologic function, and reinforces some of the course objectives of the third-year course in small animal veterinary neurology. <BR>Using interactive videodisc technology, students are able to learn the essentials of neurologic examination and then have those new skills reinforced. Instead of lecturing to a large hall of students, Dr. Greene has broken the course down into independent study sessions of four groups of 20 students each. The college presently has more than 150 videodisc workstations for Macintosh and IBM. <BR>Students are taught how to interpret abnormalities of the various components of the neurologic examination including mental status, gait, postural reactions, reflexes, cranial nerve, and sensory examinations. In addition, the module teaches the principles of localizing lesions in the nervous systems of diseased dogs and cats. <BR>With the tutorial, students are able to run through menu-driven modules at their own pace as well as perform experiments on dogs and cats in a clinical setting shown on the computer. "We show individual animals that have neurologic deficits and then students are able to consider the possible causes for the lesion which would include inflammatory, neoplastic, degenerative, traumatic, and anomalous causes." <BR>The Macintosh and IBM-compatible program was funded through the Office of Instructional Development at the University of Georgia. It is currently in use in the classroom to teach junior students clinical neurology at UGA. Other veterinary schools that have requested the tutorial include Auburn University, Ohio State University, Iowa State University, University of Tennessee, Tuskegee University, North Carolina State University, and Washington State University.<BR>The videodisc module has benefited the students in their development to become adept veterinarians, and also has saved animals.<BR>Instructors no longer have to research and do experiments such as creating lesions on live animals for teaching purposes. Dr. Greene is currently working on an additional tutorial for veterinary students. <BR><p>For more information contact Dr. Craig Greene,<A HREF="mailto:greene.c@calc.vet.uga.edu">greene.c@calc.vet.uga.edu</A> or access <A HREF="http://www.vet.uga.edu">http://www.vet.uga.edu</A>. <P><HR WIDTH=100% SIZE=4 ALIGN=LEFT><p><FONT SIZE=5>The University of Kansas</FONT><P>Virtual Theater<BR><p><IMG SRC="images/kansas.gif"  HSPACE=10 ALIGN=LEFT>At the University of Kansas, in Lawrence, Kansas, Associate Professor of Theater and Film Mark Reaney uses virtual reality software called Virtus Walkthrough Pro not only to plan sets for plays, but in the actual presentations of the plays. During a presentation, video devices are used to display sets and other images on a large screen behind the actors. An offstage computer operator, monitoring the play, shifts the scenery around on the screen so that it is in line and synchronized with the actors. <BR>"With Walkthrough pro," Reaney explains, "You can build a structure, or as in this case, a theater set and move freely throughout the model." Although it is possible to prerecord a navigation path with Virtus software, the scenery needs to be reactive to the actors for a live theater production, so the role of the offstage computer operator is an important one.<BR>Reaney has used the technique to produce Elmer Rice's play The Adding Machine, rendering the sets on his Macintosh and simulating the scenery, props, and some of the characters. As the play unfolds, audience members equipped with polarized 3D glasses see dual images that converge, enabling the illusion of 3D space. The images projected in The Adding Machine are controlled from backstage, ensuring that illusion is not lost by shifting an image too far to the left or right. <BR>The projection equipment used includes an nView LCD panel and Dukane overhead projectors. Off-stage cameras are used to create 3D images of some of the actors. The signal is then chroma-keyed into the computer-generated virtual worlds by video mixers. <BR><p>More information about the production is available at Mark Reaney's World Wide Web home page: <A HREF="http://kuhttp.cc.ukans.edu/~mreaney/">http://kuhttp.cc.ukans.edu/~mreaney/</A>.

A growing trend within academia has been the implementation of notebook computers. The University of Minnesota, Crookston, was the first university to implement the purchasing of notebook computers for all full-time students. According to Dr. Donald Sargeant, chancellor of the university, "The university's focus has been on the use of technology to support key organizational goals versus just promoting technology itelf." The main reason for notebook computers at this university according to Dr. Sargeant was the growing need of computer literacy in the workplace and the difficulty of financing computer laboratories. In addition, there was a desire for all of the students to be afforded the same access to computer resources across the board and throughout the day, night, and weekend. <br>Numerous discussions involving the entire campus took place to evolve the university into a technologically-savvy one. When first discussing the issue, a number of faculty were apprehensive and thought that the technology itself might lead to the demise of the school. Today, nearly everything on the campus is electronic. "There is very little physical mail initiated within the campus. Instead, most internal university mail is electronic, including course outlines and materials, meeting agendas and minutes, and information items and questions. The Web is available for accessing information in and out of the classroom. The computer has moved to the forefront in teaching and learning as have the terms anytime and anywhere," says Dr. Sargeant.<br>Every faculty and service office and every building is connected to the LAN, from the library to residential facilities. Today, over half of the classroom seats have power and LAN outlets for notebook computers, every student in residential life facilities has individual LAN access, and faculty enter the classroom with their notebook computer which they connect to the overhead projection system and LAN.<br>The notebook computer solution stemmed from the need to not only acquire knowledge about computer technology in the workforce, but also to provide a campus where students have instant access to all the materials they need daily. "The notebook computers brought students access like they had never experienced before," says Dr. Sargeant, "Students now have access to their course instructors and their academic advisor, support offices, and other information resources." <br>All computers have built-in modems; therefore, off-campus residents can study and complete assignments or ask questions from their homes, reducing the need to come to campus. In addition, professors at Crookston noticed an increase in student motivation, and they observed that with computers they were able to cover more material in class. The notebook computer solution placed more responsibility for learning on the learner and provided equal access to all resources on campus.<br>According to Dr. Sargeant, the notebook computer, bundled with software solution has provided students with increased access to the library and other on-line resources, enhanced communication capabilities with faculty and other students both on and off campus, increased opportunities for cooperative and collaborative projects, and intensified experiences for dealing with constant change and advanced skills for employment in the "information age." <br><p>For more information contact Dr. Donald Sargeant, Chancellor,<A HREF="mailto:Sargeant@mail.crk.umn.edu">Sargeant@mail.crk.umn.edu</A> or access <A HREF="http://www.crk.umn.edu">http://www.crk.umn.edu</A><p>www.crk.umn.edu<p><FONT SIZE=5>Vancouver Film School</FONT><p>Students Enjoy State-of-the-Art-Facilities<br><p><IMG SRC="images/vancuvr.gif"  HSPACE=10 ALIGN=LEFT>The Vancouver Film School, located in  Vancouver, Canada, has a cutting-edge program dedicated exclusively to multimedia training. Designed in collaboration with industry representatives, the multimedia program consists of an intensive 40-week course that school officials believe to be equivalent to 10 months of experience in multimedia production.<br>The curriculum includes courses in 2D and 3D graphics and animation, video production, digital video editing, digital audio and MIDI, music production, storyboarding, HTML World Wide Web publishing, and CD-ROM creation, as well as planning, budgeting, scripting, and marketing. A multitude of labs focusing on different media are outfitted with state-of-the-art equipment designed to immerse the student into the same environment they will work as professionals.<br>The labs are designed to represent real-world multimedia production environments. Courses are taught on a range of platforms, including Silicon Graphics Inc. workstations, Pentium-based PCs, and Apple Computer Inc. Power Macintosh computers. All students have access to a workstation, and all machines are fully networked and can link to the Internet and the World Wide Web through a high-speed connection. Students can audition their projects on sophisticated systems and utilize a large theater with customized acoustics.<br>The Pentium Lab is used primarily for graphics and animation. The equipment consists of 27 Pentium 90 workstations, each with a pressure-sensitive Wacom drawing tablet. The software applications used are Adobe Photoshop, Macromedia Director, Fractal Design Painter, Autodesk Animator Pro, and Autodesk 3D Studio. The Power PC Lab has 27 Power Macintosh 6100 computers. Other labs include a ProTools Audio Lab, anAvid, nine station Non-linear, Digital, Video Editing Lab, and the Alias Computer Animation Lab, which offers 3D graphics training with Alias Animator Pro 6.0 on Silicon Graphics Iris Indigo XS24Z Workstations. The Alias program runs as a part-time in addition to the multimedia program.<br> A MIDI lab gives students the opportunity to work with a computer-based music sequencing environment that is dedicated to digital sound and scoring for movies. The lab is equipped with 14 Power Macintosh 7100 computers with Opcode Studio Vision A/V sequencing  software, Digidesign Audiomedia II digital audio cards, and an Alesis Quadrasynth keyboard synthesizer.Students are trained in the marketing and business side of multimedia and are required to create a project to develop business knowledge associated with commercial production. They can create and orchestrate original music or produce a multimedia presentation that demonstrates how multimedia can help a particular corporation enter the digital age of communication. Students get hands-on learning in marketing by having to develop and pitch their interactive projects to the business community. Companies that have been involved in some of these projects include B.C. Telecom, the Vancouver Board of Trade, and the Vancouver Aquarium.<br> Students are required to take a structured core program and are given the opportunity to explore personal projects or areas of specialization. The Core Program follows the production process and students begin assembling elements and acquiring skills that will culminate in an electronic presentation given in the large multimedia presentation theater at the end of their stay. <br>The theater is dedicated to critical evaluation and presentation using laserdisc, video, multimedia, high-resolution computer graphics, and five channel surround sound. The sound system includes digital and analog sound tracks for Dolby Surround sound and other digital formats for cinema and presentations. It was specifically designed and customized to fit the room and its acoustic capabilities. Among the other theater features are large-screen video projection capabilities through a Sony projector.<br>Students graduate from the Vancouver Film School with a full range of skills as well as an interactive portfolio of multimedia projects and an interactive personal resum&eacute;. The resum&eacute; resides on a Web page that the student has created in the Internet lab. The Web page will remain posted on the school's Web site for interested employers.<br><p>For more information contact: Dana Morin, Managing Director, (604) 685-6331 or <A HREF="http://www.multimedia.edu">http://www.multimedia.edu</A>.<p><HR WIDTH=100% SIZE=4 ALIGN=LEFT><p><FONT SIZE=5>Virginia Commonwealth University</FONT><p>A Virtual Classroom Model<br><p><IMG SRC="images/vcucstwo.gif"  HSPACE=10 ALIGN=LEFT>Like many institutions, Virginia Commonwealth University has long been involved in classroom uses of technology and distance education endeavors (delivering one- and two-way audio and video conferencing). But today, these efforts have moved beyond the traditional, and VCU has found itself on the frontier-mastering rapidly developing Internet technologies and working to adapt them to non-traditional instructional uses both for on-campus students and distance learners.<p>VCU is currently developing several projects in which the Internet provides a diverse toolset and a rich environment for instructing, interacting, discovering and learning. These Internet technologies include the World Wide Web, electronic mail, Usenet newsgroups, and telnet. Each of the three examples cited here have developed a Virtual Classroom model that can be used both in and out of the classroom.<br>In the School of Allied Health's Health Administration Department, the newest class of students in the Executive Masters' Program are using the World Wide Web and e-mail as the primary modes of communicating with faculty during their two-year program. Most students in the program are mid-career professionals who work full-time jobs and live in geographically different areas of the country-from Maine to Texas. During the two-year curriculum, students spend five 1-2 week sessions on the campus in Richmond, Virginia. For five-and-a-half months each semester, students continue course work at their place of residence, meeting with faculty and other students on the Internet.<br>The World Wide Web serves as the framework which easily and seamlessly links information about the program, faculty, students, and course materials. Locally created Usenet newsgroups, which are linked into WWW pages, provide a bulletin board-like capability for faculty to post assignments and for students to post responses. Chat areas provide opportunities for student collaboration and informal discussion. In addition, access to university library services and databases is provided through the integration of telnet links from course Web pages. And, e-mail provides additional enhanced communication capabilities for both students and faculty.<br>In a typical online session, students use Netscape Navigator (a Web browser program by Netscape Corporation) to access their daily assignments, post completed work, chat with their instructor, send e-mail to colleagues, and peruse the library catalogue database and employment opportunities. "The World Wide Web provides an integrated interface to all the various components of our system. This really helps students and faculty navigate the systems quickly and easily," says Jeff Lodge, Webmaster for the Health Administration Program.<br>In the College of Humanities and Sciences' departments of English and Foreign Languages, faculty are experimenting with using Internet tools both inside and outside of the classroom to support class discussion, student collaboration, research, and writing. In addition, the multimedia capabilities of the WWW allow faculty to incorporate text, images, sound, and video into their lectures and instructional materials. In her Critical Reading and Writing course, English Professor Ann Woodlief is using the Web as an interface for students' access to her course syllabus and calendar of assignments. In addition, the WWW provides students access to hypertext versions of the fiction, poems, and plays studied in the course; an online glossary of literary terms and definitions; posting of student writings; and interactive discussion and chat areas for student collaboration activities.<br>Robert Godwin-Jones, chairman of the Department of Foreign Languages at VCU, has been experimenting with use of the WWW in instruction for more than a year. Currently he is developing an intermediate German course that will interface WWW materials with instructional modules developed using Authorware. His WWW pages combine multimedia learning materials (German stories complete with graphics, sound, and animation); customized chat sessions; and capabilities for online submission of assignments and tracking of completed student work. The Authorware instructional modules provide drill and practice exercises incorporating graphics, sound, and video. These exercises include score reporting capabilities, and are designed as hyperlinks within his WWW pages. This fall students will be able to select a WWW page link and launch an Authorware drill and practice or testing module. <br><p>For more information, contact: Steven Saltzberg, Virginia Commonwealth University; (804) 828-1855 or access the following WWW locations:Health Administration:<A HREF="http://http://www.vcu.edu/mdcweb/haeweb/class97/class97.html">http://www.vcu.edu/mdcweb/haeweb/class97/class97.html</A> (login as guest, password visitor)Critical Reading and Writing:<A HREF="http://www.vcu.edu/mdcweb/engweb/main.html">http://www.vcu.edu/mdcweb/engweb/main.html</A> (login as guest, password visitor)Intermediate German: <A HREF="http://www.fln.vcu.edu/gj/201/201.html">http://www.fln.vcu.edu/gj/201/201.html</A><p><HR WIDTH=100% SIZE=4 ALIGN=LEFT><p><FONT SIZE=5>Washington State University</FONT><p>Interactive Video Conferencing Servers<br><p>At Washington State University (WSU), video conferencing technology is helping provide education to people in different parts of the state. In order to serve "placebound" people, the university has developed a branch campus system with locations in Vancouver, Richland, and Spokane. <p>In 1985, WSU began to offer classes via video conference to its branch campuses through a program entitled the Washington Higher Education Telecommunications System (WHETS). WHETS allows students at any WSU location to take classes held at any other location with real-time interactive video. Video conferencing equipment at all locations is connected by VideoServer's Multimedia Conference Servers (MCS) so that every person-students and professors-can be seen and heard by each of the others. When the program began 10 years ago, WSU offered six courses through the program and had 10 students. Last semester, the program offered 77 classes via WHETS to more than 2,300 students around the state. <p>In addition to offering a variety of classes at branch campuses, WSU uses its video conferencing capabilities for programs at the Spokane Intercollegiate Research & Technical Institute, the Intercollegiate Center for Nursing Education, a Masters in Engineering program for employees at Boeing, a hotel and restaurant administrative program at Seattle Central Community College, and nursing programs at Wenatchee Valley Community College. <p>WSU's LAN-based microwave network connects the electronic classrooms, each of which is equipped with up to four cameras and video conferencing hardware. Two VideoServer MCSs residing at the main campus are at the heart of the system; they allow the video conferences to operate between multiple sites at one time. <p>"We chose VideoServer's MCS for its multipoint capabilities and because it is standards-based, says engineer Don Peters. Our plans for video conferencing include offering a WSU class to University of Maryland students. This technology is able to expand to meet our needs as we expand and update our video network."<p>WHETS program director Janise Hall says, "Video Conferencing has become the backbone of our branch campus system. It has allowed our branches to grow much more quickly than they would otherwise, since we are able to offer a fuller selection of courses to both professors and students." In fact, video conferencing has become key to all kinds of communication between different locations. "We make any excess video conferencing time available for faculty and administrative meetings. It brings the university together. In 1994, we had over 10,000 people taking part in video conferencing of some kind. We expect that number to continue to grow as it has, by 25 percent annually," says Hall. <br><p>For more information, contact: Janise Hall, Director of WHETS, (509) 335-6511 or access <A HREF="http://www.wsu.edu">http://www.wsu.edu</A><p><HR WIDTH=100% SIZE=4 ALIGN=LEFT><p><FONT SIZE=5>Wayne State University College of Engineering</FONT><p>Distance Learning<br><p><IMG SRC="images/wayne1.gif"  HSPACE=10 ALIGN=LEFT>Wayne State University is currently incorporating Interactive Distance Learning to reach students who are full-time workers in search of increasing their education. Using "Viewer Response System" (VRS), technology provided from One Touch Systems, upper-level engineering courses have been broadcast via the College Cable network to engineers at Ford Motor Company, and throughout Southeast Michigan. The VRS provides students in the graduate studies program the ability to directly interact with their instructor from any location. Currently, the core courses of the Electronic Computer Control Systems Masters Degree are delivered to students by broadcasting courses via the College Cable network. <br> The VRS can be used for other purposes as well, according to Dennis Kerr, operations manager, "Interactivity is incorporated every 10 to 15 minutes, enabling professors to gauge their students understanding in real-time," says Kerr, "The remote students can press a button that shows the professor a percentage of how many students are not understanding the lecture," he says. With the click of a button students can alert the professor to slow down or provide a clearer explanation on a particular topic. The professor can also use this function creatively. For instance, the professor can poll the students on a variety of subjects such as "How many of you own your own computer?" In addition, students and the professor can call on each other to answer and ask questions. All of the data taken via the VRS during each individual course session is stored in a database in the VRS host computer, which can be analyzed by the instructor. This data provides information such as the students' progress with the course material being presented, as well as the professors' strengths and weaknesses in presenting the material. The use of the VRS to bring interactivity to remote broadcast locations has proven to be a learning experience for both students and professors.<br>Studies at Wayne State University have shown that since it began using the VRS for Interactive Distance Learning in the engineering field, enrollment has gone up more than 100 percent. "In our ECE562 course, which is a course in microprocessor design, the maximum number of students that the professor could teach efficiently in a conventional classroom environment was 50 students. With the use of Interactive Distance Learning, we now have 200 students in the same course." The engineering courses are transmitted to various locations such as students' homes, and also to various corporate sites and work-stations at Ford Motor Company. <br>According to Dr. Frank Westervelt of the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department who pioneered the program in 1991, Interactive Distance Learning at Wayne State University has exhibited an increase of 600 percent more students being taught by the program over previous traditional methods. In addition, studies done at the university showed that nearly 90 percent more content is provided, and student performance has shown an increase of 20 to 25 percent as measured on proctored exams. <br> The Interactive Distance Learning Program at Wayne State University has provided a way for students who are full-time workers to continue their education without having to come to campus. With Interactive Distance Learning, they can simply watch and interact with the transmitted course from their office. Most notably, the time saved by students is enormous. Many of the students are full-time employees with other obligations who are going back to school for a higher degree. Other benefits noted from Kerr include increased productivity due to a decrease in lost time at the workplace, less traffic, less money spent on gas and baby sitters, and more time that can be focused on learning the actual material. <br> Over the summer, the VRS was used in a 500 level student masters degree course called Computers and Engineering, and during the fall semester, two more engineering courses began incorporating the VRS in instruction. Other departments at Wayne State University are also interested in using the VRS for distance learning, including the College of Nursing, the College of Medicine, and the College of Education. <br><p>For more information contact: Dennis Kerr, operations manager, Wayne State University, (313) 577-2967 or access <A HREF="http://www.wayne.edu"> http://www.wayne.edu</a><p><HR WIDTH=100% SIZE=4 ALIGN=LEFT><p><FONT SIZE=5>Wellesley College</FONT><p>Dorm Network Enables Technology Projects<br><p><IMG SRC="images/welsley.gif"  HSPACE=10 ALIGN=LEFT>At Wellesley College, a liberal arts college for women in Wellesley, Mass., the presence of the campus-wide network has spurred many Macintosh-based instructional technology projects. Wellesley's campus is fully networked, including all academic and administrative buildings. High-speed network access to individual dorm rooms is also provided. The "port for every pillow" DormNet project provides universal connectivity for all on-campus students who own or lease computers. The college's Computer Purchase Program offers "DormNet-ready" Macintosh computers with built-in ethernet and ethernet cards pre-installed. Wellesley students serve as DormNet consultants, providing advice to other students in the use of computers and networked resources. Students can access the library catalog, shared laser printers, campus and Internet e-mail and bulletin boards, as well as Wellesley's Campus Wide Information System and other World Wide Web resources.Professor of biological sciences Mary Coyne started one of the first projects to take advantage of DormNet. Moving away from slides and overhead transparencies, Coyne digitized her images, transferred them to a networked AppleShare file server, and now projects them from a networked Macintosh in the lecture hall. Students can review Coyne's digitized presentations from any Macintosh on the campus-wide network. "This is so much easier than going to the library and waiting to use a carousel of slides," explains Eleanor D. Lonske, Director of Information Technology Services.<p>Among the other departments that have made digitized images available on the network are philosophy, sociology, physics, and classical civilization. The art history department has digitized hundreds of locally produced slides onto Photo CD for both introductory and upper level courses and made them available over the network. Students no longer need to plan special trips to the arts center to view reproductions mounted on the walls, but instead can simultaneously review lectures and study for exams from any Macintosh on the campus-wide network, at any hour of the day or night. Many access the collection from their dorm rooms.<p>A growing library of instructional software, such as THINK Pascal, Mathematica, and StatView, is also available to faculty and students on Wellesley's network. A program called KeyServer, from Sassafras Software, ensures that the number of concurrent users of these applications does not exceed the number of licensed copies owned by the college.<br>The number of Wellesley faculty with adequate desktop computing power to explore and adapt instructional technology increased significantly this past summer. A team of Wellesley students and staff joined by Apple employees installed and networked 275 Power Macintosh 6100 computers on a single day in July. Approximately one third of these leased Macintosh computers went to academic departments; the remainder went to administrative departments such as admissions and the career center. This triumph of logistics, fondly nicknamed the "Normandy invasion," replaced hundreds of obsolete computers, and is a central component of Wellesley's plan to maintain a network of state-of-the-art equipment within budgetary constraints. <p><br>For more information, contact Kenny Freundlich, Manager, Advanced Technology Applications, (617) 283-2801 or access <A HREF="http://www.wellesley.edu">http://www.wellesley.edu</a><p><HR WIDTH=100% SIZE=4 ALIGN=LEFT><p><FONT SIZE=5>Wellesley College</FONT><p>Online Writing Program<br><p>Wellesley College, a liberal arts college for women, offers a writing class in which students collaborate on a network of Macintosh computers. Wellesley's writing program uses networked classrooms to hold discussions in which everyone is "speaking" at once, all the time-except that the conversations are being held in writing on computers linked by the Daedalus Integrated Writing Environment. Written conversations in these classes unfold at an unusually rapid rate (as much as 40 pages of text per class). Transcripts can be printed out and assigned as readings for the class, or students are asked to locate ideas in the discussion that can be developed into fuller theses for their papers. The Daedalus system was adopted three years ago at Wellesley. Some instructors have transformed their teaching styles to accommodate this mode of instruction. "In an oral class discussion," notes writing program director Wini Wood, "students only write down what their instructor says; in a Daedalus discussion, they come to value the comments of their classmates-and their own comments, as well."<p>For more information contact, Wini Wood, Writing Program Director, (617) 283-1000 or access <A HREF="http://www.wellesley.edu">http://www.wellesley.edu</a><P><HR WIDTH=100% SIZE=4 ALIGN=LEFT><P><ol><FONT SIZE=5>Back to SyllabusWeb <A HREF="index.html">Home Page</A></FONT></ol><P><HR WIDTH=100% SIZE=4 ALIGN=LEFT><P></BODY></HTML>

<CENTER><H1>About Syllabus Press</H1></CENTER>
Syllabus Press, based in Sunnyvale, Calif., produces information products that 
cover technology used in the higher levels of education including high 
schools, colleges, and universities. Syllabus Press' primary products 
include <I>Syllabus</I> magazine, the <I>Query</I> newsletter, and the annual Syllabus 
conference.
<P>
<B><I>Syllabus</I> magazine</B>, now in its eighth year of
publication, focuses on the use of technology in education and
related learning environments. Its mission is to inform educators on
how technology can be used to support their teaching, learning, and
administrative activities. Each issue includes feature articles, case
studies, product reviews, and profiles of technology use at the
individual, departmental, and institutional level. Regular features
cover multimedia, distance learning, the Internet, quantitative tools,
publishing, and administrative technology. A variety of multi-platform
technologies are covered; among them, computers, video, multimedia,
and telecommunications.
<P>
Special supplements to <I>Syllabus</I> are published on a regular basis, including 
<I>Windows on Campus</I>, <I>Computer Science Edition</I>, <I>Engineering Edition</I>, and <I>Science and 
Medicine Edition</I>. <I>Syllabus</I> is published nine times per year, following the 
academic calendar. 
<P>
SyllabusWeb contains highlights of recent issues of <I>Syllabus</I>. See <A HREF="syllmag.html"><I>Syllabus</I> 
Magazine</A>.
<P>
<B><I>Query</I> newsletter</B> focuses on the Internet and evolving networking and 
telecommunications technologies. The monthly newsletter covers Internet-
accessible information resources; news about initiatives of interest to network 
users and advances in communications technologies; tools and services that 
enable access to networked information; and resources which offer information 
about the Internet and related networking and communication technologies.
<P>
To see a sample issue of <I>Query</I>, see <A HREF="query.html"><I>Query</I> Newsletter</A> on SyllabusWeb.
<P>
The <B>annual Syllabus conference</B> covers much the same content area as <I>Syllabus</I> 
magazine and is developed for faculty, department chairs, administrators, and 
technology staff who want to learn about the latest technology for higher 
education. The conference, held each summer, focuses on technologies of 
strategic interest to the mission of higher education; particularly those 
technologies that support higher education's dual mission of teaching and 
research. All computer and technology platforms are covered, including 
DOS/Windows, Macintosh, and UNIX, as well as multimedia, laser discs, 
presentation devices, quantitative tools, and more. 
<P>
A complete conference brochure is available on SyllabusWeb. See <A HREF="scon951.html">Syllabus '95 Conference Information</A>.

New video and presentation technologies have opened the doors to new possibilities in the delivery of educational content. Students can receive an education anywhere and at anytime; class time can be optimized without hours spent rewriting notes from a professor's blackboard; and a world of educational opportunities are provided to people with disabilities-all due to video and presentation technology. Throughout the issue we focus on this technology throughout the curriculum.
<P>
On page 10, Dr. Reza Azarmsa discusses the presentation process in education in an article entitled, "Technology-Mediated Presentations in the Classroom." 
<P>
Video products will continue to get better as the years pass, but even today we are seeing tremendous strides in the technology. Our Buyer's Guide, which begins on page 12, presents some of these new products on the market. We cover a range of products from LCD Projectors to Digital Whiteboards. 
<P>
The January issue also features a special computer science section covering the hottest topic today: JavaScript. Java is making its mark on computer science curriculums throughout the country. First, it has streamlined applications running on existing systems and second it has entered many workforce areas. Markets from healthcare to retail are planning to use the open networking approach of Java. And with all this interest being generated by Java, it is pouring into the computer science curriculums and reenergizing the learning process. We include a feature article that covers not only the technical aspects of JavaScript, but how it is used in a curriculum at the University of North Flordia. 
<P>
A new Fax Back feature focuses on the topic of universal access. We include a listing of questions and hope to receive a variety of interesting responses and gain insight to share with you, the reader.

<B>"Technology-Mediated Presentations in the Classroom."</B> <BR>
by Dr. Reza Azarmsa
<P>
Reza Azarmsa, of Humboldt State University, discusses the dynamics of a visual presentation and explores some of the basic elements of a good presentation.

<MENU>
In the last few years, computer technology has begun to work its magic on the presentation process in education. In teaching institutions, instructors and administrators rely heavily on oral presentation accompanied with visual aids. Over the past decade, powerful new presentation programs and sophisticated display devices have joined forces with the personal computer to enhance the way such classroom presentations are produced and delivered. Most recently, audio, still imaging, animation, and full-motion video have been added to the formula to offer entirely new ways to communicate abstract or complex concepts to students.

<B>Presentation Domains</B>
<MENU>
The use of media to communicate information and skills frees educators to concentrate on the more exciting aspect of teaching: communicating effectively with learners. Today's teachers should know how to organize a presentation environment that includes a wide variety of media. The right technology-mediated materials can communicate information, teach skills, and provide general cultural experiences. In using media, a presenter/instructor must take into account the basic tenets of creating and delivering effective presentations:

<B>A JavaScript Primer</B><BR>
by Kenneth E. Martin
<P>
Kenneth E. Martin, of the University of North Florida, introduces JavaScript and provides an example of teaching JavaScript as part of the college curriculum.
<P>
<MENU>
Little more than a year ago-December 4, 1995-Netscape Communications Corp. and Sun Microsystems Inc. announced JavaScript, a new object-based, cross-platform scripting language that would enhance and extend HTML (Hypertext Markup Language). The announcement itself was accompanied by an endorsement of JavaScript from 28 companies, ranging from America Online Inc. to Vermeer Technologies. JavaScript is envisioned as a tool for HTML authors to script the behavior of objects running on their Web pages. This important tool will shift the focus of desktop computing to network-centric applications, enhance the quality and usefulness of Web pages, and provide a tight integration with HTML.
</MENU>
<P>
<MENU>
JavaScript is designed to complement and link to Java applets-small, standalone applications written by programmers and displayed on Web pages. The result is a full range of tools now available for easy selection by the computing and user community. JavaScript is a cross-platform tool that will encourage network-based applications, for example, scriptable access to databases provided across a variety of computing platforms.

Simulated Trading Room Gives Students Real-Time Experience
<P>
Columbia University Graduate School of Business is giving students hands-on experience about market trading inside the newly developed simulated trading room. Graduate students will be able to mock market behavior similar to trading rooms such as Wall Street. <BR>
<P>
"This is a valuable experience for them and a real valuable tool to have around," says John Ellrodt, Assistant Director for Instruction Technology at Columbia.<BR>
<P>
Students are responsible for their actions made, even though the simulated trading room represents a working, learning environment where they analyze "real-time" market data and  examine market movements.

The November/December issue of Syllabus focuses on how the Internet and telecommunications technologies are providing educators with new tools for delivery of instruction. In a keynote presentation at Syllabus '96, Adobe CEO John Warnock considered how digital tools are creating fundamental changes in the way information is authored and disseminated. "Education's Digital Toolkit for the 21st Century," a feature article is based on this presentation in which Warnock suggests that new ways of managing information will ultimately cause education to be redefined. <BR>
Faculty can now offer their entire course materials on the Web, including visualizations and animations that students can download anytime they need and review as often as they like. In a feature article, "The Web, a classroom sans Walls," Alistair B. Fraser examines these Web-based courses and how they may influence the roles of instructors and educational institutions. <BR>
A Buyer's Guide covers selected products that institutions can use to connect to global Internet information networks. Seven case studies profile interesting uses of technology in schools from high school to graduate level. <br>
In our Distance Learning column, Jerald Schutte shows how a Web page template and a strategy for collecting information on the Web are helping to build a virtual community of sociologists at the California State University.

<B>From Gutenberg to the Desktop</B>
The publishing infrastructure is, as it has always been, at the core of revolutionary change. Just look back about 500 years to Gutenberg in 1445, when he published the Bible and invented movable type, dramatically changing the economics of producing a book. Prior to that, books were handwritten and very scarce. Societies in Europe had generally been oral; people remembered things and passed critical information by word of mouth. Town criers communicated and broadcast information literally by yelling. Books were extremely rare and held only by a privileged few.
<P>
While Gutenberg's contributions changed all that, two other key events changed publishing technology even more. One of these began in 1460, when Mainz was sacked and knowledge of the printing process was spread throughout Europe. Aldus Minutius extended the effects of the new availability of printing expertise in the late 1400s with a very critical invention for the communication of information. He invented the small book. Prior to that books were big: they were chained to libraries and were not available to the general public. This was the first time you could write down information and have it be communicated easily throughout the society. An explosive intellectual expansion followed in the 16th and 17th centuries with growth in the fields of literature, physics, biology, and medicine.

<B>"The Web, a Classroom sans Walls"</B><BR>
Now students can access course materials, including visualizations and animations, in classrooms, labs, or dormitories. Here, Alistair B. Fraser examines how the opportunities for sharing courses over the Web will contribute to the evolution of education.
<P>
<MENU>
In the middle ages and colonial North America, the classroom technology of choice was the scholar's board, a paddle-shaped piece of wood upon which a student inscribed a lesson being dictated. Like the modern computer, the scholar's board was interactive and would display text and images. Like the World Wide Web, its material could be transported from place to place. But it was slow-infinitely slow by modern standards. Having a much better match with the human perception and processing system, the computer opens up many pedagogical advantages over not only the scholar's board, but over its descendant, the blackboard, especially when the computer is used in conjunction with the Web.
<P>
If the computer offers advantages over the pedagogical technology of previous generations, what are they? That there might be any at all is not entirely obvious to most participants in classes or seminars for which the presenter has-as he might unfortunately put it-computerized his lecture.

<B>Technology Across the Campus:</B><BR>
At Ball State University, technology filters into all areas of the campus; at Penn State the Video Flex is used to understand difficult biological concepts; a Georgian College Communications course goes online; the University of Notre Dame develops an Executive MBA program; New Technology High School emphasizes a technology curriculum; students learn teaching skills in Cyberspace at the University of Dayton; and the New School for Social Research offers more than 100 bachelor's degrees.

Distance Learning<BR>
<B>"Creating the Virtual Community"</B><BR>
Distance education is more than course offerings to remote students; it includes sharing resources among faculty. In this article, Jerald Schutte reviews a system-wide project at California State University that provides sociology faculty with a World Wide Web page builder, designed for the purposes of sharing teaching and research information throughout the sociology community.

Faculty Behind the Technology Curve
Locally, on the California State University, Northridge campus, over 50 percent of all students own home computers, 70 percent of those having modems. Some 6,000 students currently use the Internet. Sixty-five percent of all students disagree that the university is spending too much on computer technology. In fact, 45 percent of students agree they would support a fee increase to provide computer access to every student. An even 50 percent of all students think the university should automatically assign them e-mail account numbers upon registration. And 40 percent of the students agree that instructors should integrate Internet assignments into their course content.
<P>
With such universal acceptance and involvement in computer and Internet technology on the part of students, it is remarkable to discover that the same homogeneity of experience does not exist among faculty. Less than 50 percent of faculty own their own computer, and of those, the majority are more likely to use them only for stand-alone word or data processing.

In this article, Lawrence Moore outlines Project CALC, a calculus course developed at Duke University that allows students to learn by investigating real-world problems cooperatively.<P><MENU>For the last ten years, mathematics education has been swept up by a wave of change. In particular-driven by a major National Science Foundation program-there has been intense discussion, experimentation, and change in the high school and collegiate calculus curriculum. This effort, known as "calculus reform," had its beginnings in a discussion of what mathematics should become the focal point of the undergraduate curriculum in these technologically sophisticated times. The answer was "calculus," but often a radically different course from the one in place for the previous thirty years.</MENU><P><MENU>Fueling Calculus Reform<BR>Not only did technology trigger the calculus reform movement, but also it provided continuing impetus along the way. Changes in technology could not be ignored. Students were appearing in classrooms with sophisticated graphing calculators.

<p>
<IMG SRC="images/wwwone.gif"  HSPACE=10 ALIGN=LEFT>
The authors of this article relay important information intended to help prepare instructors who are interested in implementing the WWW into instruction. Topics covered include Internet access, equipment and software, technical support, creating course materials, pedagogical issues, online course components, new assessment models, and more. 
<p>

The World Wide Web and the Internet have enticed faculty with promises of access, interactivity, ease of use, and a potential universal presence in the lives of students and teachers. For many faculty, the question now is not "Should I use the Web in my class?" but "How do I get started?" and "What does a good Web course contain?"<br>
Planning a Teaching and Learning Environment on the Web
As you begin to consider the Web as a teaching and learning environment, but before you begin creating your Internet presence, operational issues should be considered.<br>
<IMG SRC="images/wwwtwo.gif"  HSPACE=10 vspace=10 ALIGN=left>
<B>Internet Access</B><br>
When considering putting course materials online, take a realistic look at your computing environment. Students will be accessing your course materials by dialing in from home, by using equipment in on-campus computer classrooms or labs, or through campus network connections in dorms or other facilities. Knowing how your students will be accessing your course materials is important for two reasons: connection speed and availability of access.

<B>"Technology-Enabled Curriculum Enhancements"</B><br>
by Robert Cavalier<r>
<p>
It has often been mentioned that while the use of information technology initially involves the porting of current materials to new environments (e.g., photographic slides to presentation software), the real impact will begin when it alters the curriculum itself. This article explores three such transitions which serve as good examples of the impact of technology on the curriculum.

<B>Image Databases and the Teaching of Aesthetics and Art History</B><BR>

In the late 1980s I was involved in an interactive videodisc project entitled Art or Forgery? The Strange Case of Han van Meegeren. The genesis for our work revolved around an interest in utilizing data rich environments for exploring issues in aesthetics. How would our students think about issues in art if they had more access to the images of the art works that they were talking about? In order to get them interested in these issues in the first place, we came upon the role of forgery in prompting people to consider real differences in attribution, aesthetic judgment, and the ultimate question of what difference an artist's signature actually makes.<br>
<IMG SRC="images/cavtwo.gif"  VSPACE=10 HSPACE=10 ALIGN=right>
The pedagogical ploy of the program revolved around a famous case of alleged Vermeer forgeries. Han van Meegeren, an artist whose credentials had declined in the eyes of art critics, had been accused of collaborating with the Nazis in the acquisition of a heretofore undiscovered Vermeer masterpiece: Christ and the Adulteress. At his trial shortly after the Allied victory, van Meegeren claimed to have painted the work himself. Was he telling the truth or was he risking the charge of forgery rather than face the more serious charge of collaboration?<br>
The critics had praised the work as an authentic Vermeer. How much weight should their views hold? And is a work praised by the art world no longer valuable if the experts change their minds-reducing a former Vermeer to a mere forgery of a Vermeer? It is in this context that the topic of forgery touches key issues in the philosophy of art.

<B>"Putting Technology in its Place: Evolution of the IAT"</B><br>
by Kathryn Conway<br>
<p>
Kathryn Conway gives an overview of the Institute of Academic Technology from its early days when computing technology had not gotten much further than word processing and spreadsheets for most faculty to its current focus on what new possibilities can be achieved and what new futures can be invented in the academic setting.
<p>
<MENU>
In 1989, the Institute for Academic Technology was founded as a partnership between the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and IBM. At that point, "state of the art" computing technology had not gotten much further than word processing and spread sheets for most faculty. James Noblitt, one of the IAT's first academic fellows, commented that "There is considerable lag between technological innovation and its acceptance as a legitimate tool for learning and research. New instructional technology is embraced only if it is perceived as supporting institutionally recognized educational objectives."<br>
Most innovations in instructional technology in the late 1980s were inspired by individual faculty efforts, not through institutional initiatives. But by the early 1990s, the decrease in public funding in proportion to higher education's traditional budgetary sources, coupled with a higher number of graduating high school seniors and adults needing higher education, caused institutions to take a greater interest in technology applications.

<B>Students Get a Solid Foundation in Anatomy Education with A.D.A.M. Practice Practical</B><BR>
Professor Pawlina, instructor of anatomy and histology at the University of Florida College of Medicine, has authored several A.D.A.M. software products including the latest release entitled A.D.A.M. Practice Practical. This new product provides students with a simulated lab environment complete with "pinned" structures and time limits. "The software provides a perfect complement to a student's anatomy education especially in terms of attaining a thorough knowledge of the basics and having a strong base from which to continue with on through the years of their medical education," says Prof. Pawlina. The application soon will be implemented into the Gross Anatomy Lab at the University of Florida, where students already have access to other products co-authored by Prof. Pawlina. <BR>
 "Students these days are very inquisitive and want to know information right away as well as assure themselves that they thoroughly understand the material," says Prof. Pawlina. "They want to be able to mimic pins placed in the image similar to a practice exam before the big one."

<P>
This article focuses on the four critical elements of good multimedia software for the educational environment. To be effective, multimedia must have four key attributes: Presentability, Accountability, Customizability, and Extensibility-or collectively, PACE.
<P>
<MENU>
The key to educational technology is software-and what the students and teachers are doing with it. Judging the appropriateness, effectiveness, and capability of technology in the classroom is difficult, but new classroom tools mean expanded opportunities for teaching and learning. Simple-to-use multimedia authoring applications, digital media collections, Internet access, and new curriculum-based software are all making the technology-centered classroom a reality.

"Teaching Online Search Techniques Your Students Can Use" <BR>
by Lillian Biermann Wehmeyer<BR>
<P>
In this article the author considers useful information search techniques that can be taught to students. 
<P>
Do you remember the days when you flipped through the card catalog to find books? And when, to locate journal articles, you took one paperbound issue of one index, pored through the pages, perhaps turned to another page to find an abstract, wrote down or photocopied the references, then took the next paperbound issue, and eventually worked your way back to-and through-the hardbound annual cumulations? Whenever I think that a computer is slow in responding to a search command, I call to mind the image of a hand search, and I am supremely grateful.<P>
Now I teach the skills of online searching to university students. Some aspects of searching have not changed with the computer; others are vastly different.

Considerations of infrastructure, equipment, personnel, and pedagogy need to be taken into account early in the planning stages of any single or coordinated multimedia teaching effort.<p><MENU><B>Infrastructure for Delivery of Multimedia Instruction</B><br>Consider the physical infrastructure of classrooms. While many institutions presently have existing "media" teaching rooms, these are often set up for slide and 16mm film presentation, with sloped floors, rows of fixed seating, a pit or stage at one end from which a faculty member lectures, and a screen behind the lectern. But LCD projectors, the equipment you will most likely use for presentation of your multimedia course, are hard to use in this environment: they usually must be within 20 or 30 feet of the screen and need to be at 90 degrees with respect to its surface to minimize distortion. They may pixilate their image if specified operating conditions are not met, so it is important to have a classroom in which they can be set up properly. In a theater or classroom with row seating, the line of sight of students sitting to the rear can be blocked, so seating arrangement is an issue.</MENU><p><HR WIDTH=100% SIZE=4 ALIGN=LEFT><p>Page 12<br><B>Video for the Classroom: Buyer's Guide</B><br><p><B>PROVISION Power Cannon</B><br>PROVISION Power Cannon is a new LCD projector which provides image accuracy from both video and computer sources.

This issue covers such disciplines as Russian and opera as well as an instructional technology department, and the use of fiber optics and video technology. <p><B>San Jose State University</B><br><p>Continuing Education Students Learn the Power of Electronic PresentationsToday's presentation software and LCD projection products are rapidly making slide carrousels and transparencies obsolete and are making remarkable progress in the impact of business and educational presentations. Selected wisely, located prudently, and combined with traditional presentation techniques and skills, the new electronic equipment offers tremendous assistance in preparing and delivering the perfect presentation. Nowhere do they seem to be taking to this technology faster than at the San Jose State University Instructional Department where approximately 150 continuing education students are learning to use electronic presentation equipment to enhance their careers as instructional design and presentation professionals in numerous Silicon Valley corporations. <p><B>South Dakota State University</B><br><p>Russian Instruction Via Video Technology <br>South Dakota State University, located in Brookings, S.D., offers a Russian language course via distance learning. Spearheaded by instructor Janet Johnson, the course has taken top honors two years in a row in the annual U.S. Distance Learning competition.<br>Johnson holds the class in the University's Rural Development Telecommunications Network (RDTN) studio and it is transmitted to a remote site in Pierre, S.D. The program incorporates two-way video and two-way audio.<br>Johnson relishes using visual techniques in teaching Russian. Chroma key technology, for example, allows her to place herself in pictures displayed on the monitor as if she were really at the remote location. One of the classes took the students to Red Square via distance learning. With chroma key technology, Johnson was able to place herself in the picture of Red Square and move around as though she were actually on location in Russia.<p><B>Stanford University</B><br><p>Fiberoptic Transmission Equipment Helps Enhance University Television Network<br>Engineers at Stanford University recently discovered that expanding the capabilities of a multi-faceted university television broadcast and distance learning network can be a daunting task, particularly when working within the framework of an already stretched budget. <p><IMG SRC="images/rigoleto.gif"  VSPACE=0 HSPACE=10 ALIGN=right> <B>Rhodes College</B><br><p>World Wide Web Project Increases Student Interest in Opera<br>Rhodes College, located in Memphis, Tennessee, has a enrollment of 1,500 students. Classes covering the topic of music, such as Professor Patricia Gray's "History of Opera" class, usually contain fewer than 20 students. To increase student interest, Gray began incorporating the World Wide Web and the Internet into instruction by requiring her students to participate in discussion groups and navigating the Internet. Noting increased student interest and participation via this mode of instruction, she thought the creation of a class home page seemed like the obvious next step for the class to take.<p><B>University of the South</B><br><p>New "Electronic Classroom" Unveiled<br>Earlier this year, the University of the South unveiled its new, fully-equipped, 20x40' "electronic classroom."  The room allows students to learn traditional subjects such as computer science, physics, astronomy, mathematics, English, economics, and others through a very untraditional means of technology. On either side of the room is a ceiling-mounted Proxima 5100 directed at one of two 10 x 10 projection screens. Additionally, the room houses an Elmo Visual Presenter, VCRs, and laser discs. <p><HR WIDTH=100% SIZE=4 ALIGN=LEFT><p>Page 26<br><B>On the Internet</B><br>"Internet Resources for Course Development"<br>by Lillian Biermann Wehmeyer<br><p>Lillian Biermann Wehmeyer discusses the resources faculty can find on the Internet.

In either case, can the Internet help?<br>Yes, indeed! Internet resources have limits, especially when it comes to full text.

<IMG SRC="images/june96cvr.gif"  HSPACE=10 ALIGN=right>
In this issue of Syllabus, we cover communications and networking in the education environment. Recently, there has been an explosion of activity in distance learning. Telecommunications technologies are changing how and when students interact with their professors. Colleges and universities are redefining themselves and expanding the idea of "the campus." Throughout the issue, we focus on how telecommunications and distance learning are extending the classroom beyond the traditional lecture. We include a feature article that looks at what new options are available for instructional delivery and what changes may result on an institutional level. Another feature article focuses on networks and professional organizations. We include a buyer's guide that covers the latest products in video conferencing and networking, eight case studies covering technology on campus, and our regular columns entitled On the Internet and Quantitative Tools.

<B>"Telecommunications and the Changing Nature of Instructional Delivery"</B><BR>
by Norman Wagner<BR>
<P>
In this article, the author describes the new options for instructional delivery made possible by media fusion and advanced telecommunications technologies, and he explores the possibilities for resulting institutional change. 
<P>
<MENU>
It has been widely documented in the popular press that in the near future the ability to originate and receive telecommunications, including computing, will be available to almost everyone in schools, homes, and in the workplace, as telephones are now. Media fusion, that is the blending of telephone, computer, and television capabilities in one appliance, will allow people to interact in combinations of voice, text, and video in real time or delayed.

<B>"In Partnership with Education: The Network Professional Association"</B><BR>
by Gerry Dye<BR>
<P>

As networks become commonplace in our institutions  and in society in general, academia can help define standards for network professionals. In this article, the author outlines how the association forms partnerships with educational institutions and with industry in order to establish programs for training network professionals and to offer new opportunities for students. 
<P>
<MENU>
When French historian and sociologist Alexis de Tocqueville traveled and studied in the United States in the nineteenth century, he was struck by the roles and prominence taken by associations in this country. In his monumental work, Democracy in America, he noted that in Europe traditional guilds had evolved into trade unions that negotiated with business and government on behalf of their members, generally from an adversarial position. However, in the U.S. the guilds had evolved into associations (with unions springing up under different circumstances) that supported their members in the development of skills and resources that tended to raise the standards of their industry and their membership's place in it.

"Wide-Angle Searching on the World Wide Web"<BR>
by Lillian Biermann Wehmeyer<BR>
<P>
Just as the largest network of them all, the Internet, continues to grow at a staggering rate, the World Wide Web is expanding dramatically, spawning widely scattered and diverse collections of information. The author reviews tools for "wide-angle" searching on the World Wide Web.<BR>
<P>
In writing this piece, I find myself torn between two messages. The first of these is that the Internet, and especially the World Wide Web, offers a vast and expanding resource of current information for our own research and for teaching. The second, on the other hand, is that the Internet is still a relatively meager source of information when stacked against all the resources that could be assembled on any given subject. To put it another way, libraries still have an important place, at least for the foreseeable future. But having made that point, let me return to the burgeoning wealth in the virtual realm of cyberspace.

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=5>Syllabus '96 Highlights</FONT></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=5>S</FONT> yllabus '96 was a success with all areas of the conference showing tremendous growth and expansion. Sonoma State University co-sponsored the event, which witnessed the convergence of more than 1,700 educators onto the campus, ready to participate in the annual conference.<BR>
<P>
<B>Insights into Education Technology</B><BR>
Keynotes were given by such notables as <A HREF="http://http://www.oit.itd.umich.edu/~cberger/ ">Carl Berger</A>, director of Academic Information Processes at the University of Michigan, John Warnock, CEO of Adobe Systems Inc., and <A HREF="http://http://www.iat.unc.edu/publications/graves/graves.html ">Bill Graves</A>, associate provost for Information Technology and founder of the IAT. In another keynote session, attendees participated in a live video conference with the celebrated maestro and violinist Pinchas Zukerman and observed him giving music lessons to two local violin students from a distance of more than 3,000 miles away.
<P>
<B>A Focus on Classroom Technologies</B><BR>
Monday, the first day of the conference, focused on <A HREF="syll96_speak_mon.htm">classroom technologies</A>. A variety of breakout sessions expanded on technologies explored in keynote presentations: New tools available to faculty were presented by the <A HREF="syll96_speak_mon.htm#1a">New Media</A> Centers. A panel consisting of industry leaders presented their companies' positions and directions regarding education technology. Teaching faculty discussed issues regarding technology in their courses and classrooms from a front-line perspective.
<P>
Afternoon breakout sessions included case studies the areas of music, history, mathematics, psychology, biology, and chemistry. Attendees learned how instructors in each of these areas have incorporated technology into teaching their respective disciplines.
<P>
<B>An Exploration of Web-Based Environments for Teaching and Learning</B><BR>
Tuesday's sessions examined a new and often controversial model taking hold in higher education: <A HREF="syll96_speak_tues.htm">Web-based learning environments</A>. Presenters led panels and discussed their experiences with the Web, how it has enhanced their teaching, and what steps others need to take to have the smoothest transition to this medium. An industry panel offered varied outlooks on the topic of the Internet and technology. Industry representatives also gave sneak previews of where Web-based technologies are headed.
<P>
Additional break-out sessions consisted of case study presentations by instructors in a variety of disciplines on incorporating the Web in teaching. Topics covered such diverse areas as using the Web to facilitate instruction in an opera history course, hypertext/hypermedia foreign language software, dance and the arts in cyberspace, creating a virtual community for sociology, Web-based meteorology courses, and online writing clinics. These sessions featured enlightening experiences shared by presenters as they related their personal stories and offered demonstrations on how they teach with technology.
<P>
<B>Issues of Infrastructure and Implementation</B><BR>
The last day of the conference focused on <A HREF="syll96_speak_wed.htm">implementing technology in educational institutions</A>. Attendees heard faculty panels discussing the foundations for technology implementation on campus, infrastructure issues, creative ideas on how to acquire funding, and what steps smaller colleges can take to begin the implementation process. Attendees also learned about strategies for planning and financing large-scale technology programs.
<P>
<B>Experiencing Technology: Exhibits, Hands-On Labs, and Workshops</B><BR>
The conference enjoyed the largest exhibitor list in its history with more than 60 <A HREF="sconf96_exhibits.html">companies</A> displaying their latest offerings. Special technology seminars allowed hands-on participation in state-of-the-art computer labs for experiencing the latest innovations first-hand, and free access to open labs offered participants plenty of practice time to develop their skills in using different media. In addition, attendees could take part in both pre-conference and post-conference workshops to learn everything from animation on the Web to developing outstanding classroom presentations.
<P>
<B>Audio Tapes and Proceedings Available</B><BR>
Syllabus Press is making audio tapes available of the main sessions of the Syllabus '96 conference and is also offering a printed copy of the conference proceedings. 
<P>
<B>Future Syllabus Conferences and Workshops</B><BR>
Syllabus Press is proud to announce a fourth annual Syllabus conference, to be held once again next summer at Sonoma State University on July 26-30, 1997. A <A HREF="papercall97.html">Call for Papers and Presentations</A> contains guidelines for submission. 
<P>
The <A HREF="pitt96_cover.htm">Syllabus Workshops '96-'97</A> series of intensive workshops covering critical academic technologies is also continuing and expanding. The first workshops took place last spring in Miami, Fla. The next stop will be in Philadelphia, Pa. at Duquesne University on Nov. 8-10, 1996. Plans are currently being mapped out for workshops to be held throughout the country and internationally.
<P>

This workshop is intended for those who have used the Internet mainly for e-mail, or not at all. You will learn the basics of using the World Wide Web and how to apply it to your own education environment. Included is an introduction to the development of home pages using hypertext markup language (HTML). Numerous examples of web use in education will be highlighted throughout this workshop.<P><A NAME="sa5"></A><LI> <B><FONT SIZE=4>Developing Courses for the World Wide Web  (ADV)</FONT></B><br><B>Workshop leader: <A HREF="sconf96_faculty.html#Robert Cavalier">Robert Cavalier</A>, Carnegie Mellon University</B><BR>This intensive one-day session assumes proficiency in using the Web and a cursory understanding of HTML. Participants are expected to bring their course materials with them. By the end of this workshop, each participant will have their own WWW home page. Topics covered include an overview of HTML and the use of HTML editors. Emphasis will be on converting course syllabi and lecture outlines into Web-based course materials. Participants will create well-designed class-based pages with relevant links, tables, and graphics. The development of FORMS and communication capabilities will also be explored. The session will also provide a preview of advanced Web environments (such as Java).<P><A NAME="sa6"></A><LI> <B><FONT SIZE=4>Multimedia on the World Wide Web (ADV)</FONT></B><BR><B>Workshop leader: <A HREF="sconf96_faculty.html#Charles Kerns">Charles Kerns</A>, Stanford University; <A HREF="sconf96_faculty.html#Rachel S.

It assumes that you have learned to create a basic text Web page and want to add multimedia elements to your site. In the first half of the workshop, you learn how to create graphic banners that show where you are, where you can go, and how your site is organized. You will see how to create graphics that load quickly and are visually effective. Later, you will learn to digitize, crop, compress, and color correct images. Then you will convert your image files to formats that will display on the Web. Finally, you will digitize short video clips and prepare them for Web display. At the end of the class you will have Web pages, complete with video, images, and graphics, ready to take home and start your own site. The class will be taught using Macintosh computers, but the pages you create will play on most Web browsers, regardless of the computing platform. <P><A NAME="sa7"></A><LI> <B><FONT SIZE=4>Multimedia Design and Interfaces: Principles You Can "Virtually" Bank On (ADV)</FONT></B><BR><B>Workshop leader: <A HREF="sconf96_faculty.html#Douglas Chute">Doug Chute</A>, Drexel University</B> <BR>This workshop is intended for software, Web page, and multimedia developers who know they are supposed to work in high-powered, managed teams with programmers, instructional designers, artists, content experts, marketing, and video and audio professionals. Because such teams are not "reality" for most academic products, this workshop provides basic principles of design and interface-especially relevant if you are in the category of "doing-it-mostly-yourself-by-necessity." The workshop will emphasize skill development in creating publishable projects for the academic market. Basic multimedia and Web skills are a pre-requisite for this workshop. Topics to be covered include: interface design, selecting authoring tools, graphics, content development, and finding a publisher. <P><A NAME="sunday"></A><FONT SIZE=5><B>Sunday, July 21</B></FONT><br><B><FONT SIZE=4>Full-day workshops (9:00AM-4:00PM with breaks, additional fees required)</FONT></B> <P><br><A NAME="su1"></A><LI> <B><FONT SIZE=4>Multimedia Authoring-Macintosh (BEG)</FONT></B><br><B>Workshop leaders: <A HREF="sconf96_faculty.html#Judith Stern">Judith Stern</A> and <A HREF="sconf96_faculty.html#Robert Lettieri">Robert Lettieri</A>, University of California at Berkeley</B> <BR>During this session, we will introduce multimedia authoring tools.
