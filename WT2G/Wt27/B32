<body>
Frank Miele grew up in a "mob" town in New Jersey.  His current incarnation
is as a free-lance writer and musician living in the San Francisco Bay
Area.  His principal interest is applying Occam's Razor and Hume's Fork
to the study of evolutionary biology, political ideology, and religious
philosophy, especially extremist positions as test cases.  The present
article, "Giving the Devil His Due," developed from a letter to the
editor he submitted in response to Michael Shermer's editorial asking
if Skeptics should look into Holocaust revisionism (<em>Skeptic</em>
Vol. 2 No. 2).  The author wishes to thank Vora Shamelis and Pat Carri
for editorial and research assistance, and the reference librarians of
the South Bay Cooperative Library System who, despite budget cuts,
answered questions and provided materials without which this article
could not have been written.

<em>"It was twenty years ago today, Sgt. Pepper taught the band to 
play . . ."</em>

<p>In many ways Niles Eldredge and Stephen Jay Gould taught paleontology to 
play twenty years ago, publishing a paper that helped revitalize the 
science. Long associated in the public minds with musty old bones, 
paleontology had the well-deserved reputation of being a stagnant 
backwater among the sciences.</p>
<p>Before the seventies, most college paleontology classes were little 
more than rote memorization of fossil names and anatomy. In his preface 
to the 1972 book <em>Models in Paleobiology</em> (where the punctuated 
equilibrium paper first appeared), Tom Schopf pointed out that a typical 
dissertation in paleontology consisted of describing some new fossils, 
with little thought about their broader theoretical implications, or 
about the possibilities for asking novel questions of the fossil record. 
Virtually all the paleontology textbooks of the time (such as the 
classic text by Moore, Lalicker and Fischer, first published in 1952) 
were simply compendia of fossils, and the broader theoretical issues 
were confined to few sketchy introductory chapters. The meetings of the 
Paleontological Society at the Geological Society of America convention 
were dominated by descriptive papers ("a new fauna from X" or "a new 
species of Y"), with only occasional broader theoretical papers that 
appealed to anyone other than the narrow specialist. This approach was 
called <em>idiographic</em> by Gould (1980a), since it focuses on studying the 
objects for their own sake. Others sneered and called it
"stamp-collecting."</p>
<p>In the late sixties and early seventies, however, this situation 
changed radically. Perhaps the student activism of the sixties 
penetrated paleontology, or maybe the emphasis on ecology and holistic 
viewpoints were influential. In any case, a new generation of "young 
Turks" who finished their Ph.D.'s in the late sixties led a revolution 
that shook up the musty old profession. They emphasized thinking of 
<em>fossils as organisms</em>, rather than dead objects to be described, 
catalogued, and put away in a museum drawer. In their papers and books, 
they applied ideas from modern biology--ecology, speciation theory, 
diversity and variation, population genetics, and many other concepts--to 
the fossil record. Although they recognized the limitations of the 
fossil record, they also found many instances where biological models 
lent new perspectives on long-studied fossils. Gould (1980a) called this 
the <em>nomothetic</em> approach, since it seeks to find general, law-like 
properties among all the idiographic details.</p>
<p>In 1971, David Raup and Steve Stanley published a radical new 
textbook entitled <em>Principles of Paleontology</em>. Unlike any paleontology 
text before (or since), it had no descriptions of fossil invertebrates; 
it was entirely focused on the theoretical issues of how we interpret 
the fossil record, and what we can (and can't) learn from it. In 1972 
Tom Schopf edited <em>Models in Paleobiology</em> (mentioned above), which 
contained a number of influential papers emphasizing new conceptual 
approaches to the fossil record. By 1975 Tom Schopf and Ralph Johnson 
had founded the journal <em>Paleobiology</em>, which carried only papers of 
general theoretical interest; descriptive papers stuck to the venerable 
<em>Journal of Paleontology</em>. Since that time, the program of the 
Paleontological Society meetings has been packed with mind-boggling (and 
sometimes numbing) theoretical papers; abstracts of papers aimed at 
narrow specialists are rejected. Ultimately, the Paleontological Society 
recognized the influence of the generation of "young Turks" by 
establishing the Charles Schuchert Award for the outstanding 
paleontologist under the age of 40.</p>
<p>Although the original "young Turks" are now middle-aged, a new 
generation of paleontologists that they have trained or influenced 
dominates the profession. (My first freshman paleontology class in 1973 
was taught using the brand-new Raup and Stanley text for the first time 
in my professor's career). <em>Paleobiology</em> has been joined by
<em>Historical Biology</em>, <em>Lethaia</em>, <em>Palaios</em>, and other journals
which emphasize papers of broad theoretical interest. More importantly,
paleontology is no longer an intellectual backwater. Paleontological data
and ideas are shaking up evolutionary theory. The controversy over mass
extinctions (and whether they are periodic or extraterrestrially caused) has
been written up in several best-sellers, made the cover of <em>Time</em>
magazine, and stimulated the public debate about modern extinctions due to 
environmental destruction by humans. Dinosaurs are the hottest fad for 
kids of a certain age, although this rarely translates into careers in 
paleontology. (Like many paleontologists, however, I'm one of those kids 
who got hooked on dinosaurs at age 4 and never grew up). Paleontology 
has always gotten front-page billing for amazing idiographic wonders 
like giant dinosaurs, but now general, nomothetic ideas from 
paleontology are also influencing the rest of the scientific community. 
The earliest and most influential of all was punctuated equilibria.</p>

<a name="birth">
<h2>The Birth of "Punk Eek"</h2>
</a>

Since his 1942 classic <em>Systematics and the Origin of Species</em>, Ernst 
Mayr has led the biological community in research in speciation theory. 
In 1954, Mayr proposed the <em>allopatric speciation model</em>. According to 
this idea, new species usually do not arise within the main body of a 
population, because the genetic exchange between organisms rapidly 
swamps any new variations. Instead, small subpopulations which are 
genetically isolated from the main population are more likely to change, 
because an evolutionary novelty has a much better chance of dominating a 
small population than a large one.</p>
<p>This can be due to several factors. Many small populations, 
particularly those founded by a small number of settlers on an island, 
show the <em>founder effect</em>. The founders were a small subsample of the 
mainland population which may have had unusual gene frequencies (simply 
by accident of sampling), and all of their descendants will carry those 
genes. The founder effect need not be confined to islands, however. The 
Amish and Mennonites, who live among the rest of the American population 
but rarely interbreed for religious reasons, have many unusual genes.</p>
<p>Another possible cause is <em>genetic drift</em>. If a high percentage of 
genes are invisible to natural selection (as much research now shows), 
then they can randomly mutate without being weeded out. Ultimately, this 
random walk of mutation (or "genetic drift") can produce something which 
may have a selective advantage--or may be deleterious. Either way, it 
has a much better chance of becoming dominant in a small population that 
is genetically isolated from its ancestors.</p>
<p>These populations are said to be <em>allopatric</em>, or living in "another 
homeland." If their isolation is long enough, they become so genetically 
different that when they are reintroduced or reinvade their original 
homeland (become <em>sympatric</em>), they can no longer interbreed with the 
ancestors; they have become a new species. This new species may die out 
quickly, or it may drive its ancestor to extinction, or both may persist 
side-by-side, typically by exploiting slightly different ecological 
niches. In paleontological terms, the allopatric speciation model 
predicts that species arise rapidly (a few hundred to a thousand years, 
but instantaneous in a geological sense) on the periphery of their range 
(where they are rarely fossilized). It predicts that the main population 
(most likely to be fossilized) will show little or no change, but will 
be suddenly invaded by new species with no apparent transitions between 
them.</p>
<p>Despite the harsh words of critics and derogatory labels (such as 
"evolution by jerks" or "punk eek"), the original formulation of 
punctuated equilibria in 1972 was remarkably modest. As recounted by 
Eldredge (1985a) and Gould (1992), they were originally both graduate 
students at the American Museum of Natural History in New York. At the 
turn of the century the American Museum had once dominated vertebrate 
paleontology, but they came there to study with Norman Newell, who had 
an interest in evolutionary problems in fossil invertebrates. Both 
Eldredge and Gould found that tracing evolution in their chosen 
organisms (trilobites and land snails, respectively) was difficult; most 
of their fossils showed no change through thousands to millions of years 
of strata. In 1971, Niles Eldredge published a paper in <em>Evolution</em> 
which attempted to explain this apparent lack of change. Their joint 
paper published the next year in the Schopf volume, however, has been 
the focus of all the controversy.</p>
<p>Since the allopatric model had been dominant in biology for decades 
before Eldredge and Gould, it seems surprising that paleontologists 
ignored its implications for the fossil record. Some of this may have 
been inherent conservatism, or ignorance of biology, but it also had 
deeper philosophical roots. As Eldredge and Gould (1972) pointed out, 
paleontologists were raised in a tradition inherited from Darwin known 
as <em>phyletic gradualism</em>, which sought out the gradual transitions 
between species in the fossil record. They viewed species as part of a 
continuum of gradual change in anatomical characteristics through time. 
The classic metaphor showed each species as part of a bell-shaped 
frequency curve, with the mean shifting gradually up through time 
(<em>Figure 1</em>). Each species was thus an arbitrary slice through a 
continual lineage, and paleontologists agonized for years as to whether 
these arbitrary slices should be designated species. Indeed, this debate 
had its own label: "the species problem in paleontology."</p>
<p>Even their detractors concede that Eldredge and Gould were the first 
to point out that modern speciation theory would not predict gradual 
transitions over millions of years, but instead the sudden appearance of 
new species in the fossil record <em>punctuated</em> by long periods of species 
stability, or equilibrium. Eldredge and Gould not only showed that 
paleontologists had been out-of-step with biologists for decades, but 
also that they had unconsciously trying to force the fossil record into 
the gradualistic mode. The few supposed examples of gradual evolution 
were featured in the journals and textbooks, but paleontologists had 
long been mum about their "dirty little trade secret:" most species 
appear suddenly in the fossil record and show no appreciable change for 
millions of years until their extinction.</p>

<a name="debate">
<h2>The Debate</h2>
</a>

When the punctuated equilibrium paper first came out, reactions were 
mixed. Since 1972 there have been many traditional paleontologists who 
denied its importance, and trotted out their favorite example of gradual 
evolution. Many of these "classic" examples were restudied in critical 
detail, and turned out to be ambiguous, or actually demonstrated 
punctuated equilibria better than gradualism. 
<p>There were a host of more trivial objections and misunderstandings, 
which have been discussed by Gould and Eldredge (1977) and Gould (1992). 
Most studies fell short because they focused on a single lineage 
(neglecting faunal variation) from a single section (neglecting 
geographic variation), often showing change in only one characteristic 
(neglecting morphological variation), which had not been analyzed by 
rigorous statistical methods. Other cases failed because they were on 
the wrong time scale to be relevant to the debate, or too poorly dated 
to know anything about change through time.</p>
<p>For example, one of the main proponents of gradualism, Philip 
Gingerich (1976, 1980, 1987), showed just two or three examples of 
supposed gradual evolution in early Eocene (about 50-55 million years 
old) mammals from the Bighorn Basin of northwestern Wyoming. But a 
detailed examination of the <em>entire mammal fauna</em> (monographed by Bown, 
1979, and Gingerich, 1989) shows that most of the rest of the species do 
not change gradually through time. Also, studies on specific lineages in 
restricted areas cannot account for the possibility that a gradual 
transition may actually reflect the migration of a clinally varying 
population across a region through time. This was documented by 
Schankler (1981), who showed that some of Gingerich's patterns from the 
northern Bighorn Basin did not even hold up in the southern Bighorn 
Basin, just a few dozen miles away!</p>
<p>As Gould and Eldredge (1977) pointed out in their five-year 
retrospective on the debate, it's easy to pick one specific example of 
either gradualism or punctuation, but the important issue is one of 
generality. Which pattern is dominant among the species in the fossil 
record, since both are known to occur? If you sample all the members of 
a given fauna, which pattern is most common? In the twenty years since 
the paper, more and more case studies have been generated, and by now a 
pattern seems to be emerging (Gould, 1992; Stanley, 1992).</p>
<p>It is now clear that among microscopic protistans, gradualism does 
seem to prevail (Hayami and Ozawa, 1975; Scott, 1982; Arnold, 1983; 
Malmgren and Kennett, 1981; Malmgren et al., 1983; Wei and Kennett, 
1988, on foraminiferans; Kellogg and Hays, 1975; Kellogg, 1983; Lazarus 
et al., 1985; Lazarus, 1986, on radiolarians, and Sorhannus et al., 
1988; Fenner et al., 1989; Sorhannus, 1990, on diatoms). As discussed by 
Gould and Eldredge (1977) and Lazarus (1983), this may be due to the 
fact that most of these organisms are either asexual clones, or show 
alternation of of sexual and asexual generations. Each cloning lineage 
is distinct and many never interbreed with other lineages, so the issue 
of gene exchange and homogenization may be moot. They do not fit the 
genetic models that biologists developed from complex sexual organisms 
such as insects and birds. In addition, they live in enormous (trillions 
of individuals) populations that span entire oceanic water masses, so 
they do not form many small, isolated populations (Prothero and Lazarus, 
1980; Lazarus, 1983; Lazarus and Prothero, 1984). Finally, many of the 
morphological variants that we call species may in fact be the same 
genetic lineage which responds to different environmental conditions 
with different anatomical features. This is called <em>ecophenotypic</em> 
variation, and appears to be very common in planktonic microfossils. 
Perhaps much of the morphological change seen in microfossils does not 
reflect any underlying genetic change, but is simply an ecophenotypic 
response to the changing environment (Lazarus, 1983).</p>
<p>Among more complex organisms, however, the opposite consensus had 
developed. As paleontologists had known for over a century, most species 
are stable for millions of years, and change so rapidly that we rarely 
witness it in the fossil record. Of the hundreds of studies that have 
been reviewed elsewhere (Gould and Eldredge, 1977, 1986; Gould, 1992), a 
few stand out (Stanley, 1992). Cheetham (1986) and Stanley and Yang 
(1987) examined all the available lineages of their respective groups 
(bryozoans and bivalves) through long intervals of time, using 
multivariate analysis of multiple character states. Both concluded that 
most of their species were static through millions of years, with rare 
but rapid episodes of speciation. Williamson (1981, 1985) examined the 
details of evolution of molluscs in Lake Turkana, Kenya, and showed that 
there were multiple examples of rapid speciation and prolonged stasis, 
but no gradualism. Barnosky (1987) reviewed a great number of different 
lineages of mammals, from mammoths to shrews and rodents, that lived 
during the last two million years of the Ice Ages. He found a few 
examples of gradualism, but many more which showed stasis and 
punctuation.</p>
<p>My own research (Prothero and Shubin, 1983; Prothero, 1992; Prothero, 
Heaton, and Stanley, in press) examined all the mammals with a 
reasonably complete record from the Eocene-Oligocene (about 30-35 
million years ago) beds of the Big Badlands of South Dakota and related 
areas in Wyoming and Nebraska (<em>Figure 2</em>). This study not only sampled 
every available lineage without bias, but also had much better time 
control from magnetic stratigraphy (Prothero and Swisher, 1992) and 
wider geographic coverage than the studies by Gingerich cited above. 
With one exception (gradual dwarfing in the oreodont <em>Miniochoerus</em>), we 
found that all of the Badlands mammals were static through millions of 
years, or speciated abruptly (if they changed at all).</p>
<p>Contrary to claims by Hoffman (1989, 1992) that the punctuated 
equilibrium model is either trivial, false, or irrelevant, it has been 
one of the most stimulating and provocative hypotheses in paleobiology. 
Witness the enormous literature it generated, or the fact that there 
have been several recent symposia on the subject (e.g., Somit and 
Peterson, 1992) and twenty-year retrospectives at national 
paleontological meetings in Chicago in July, 1992, and Cincinnati in 
October, 1992. Although a survey of the programs of recent meetings 
would show fewer studies about evolutionary patterns than a decade ago, 
there are still many new studies with major new insights being published 
every year.</p>

<a name="stasis">
<h2>Stasis, Landscapes, and Polyhedra</h2>
</a>

If the punctuated equilibrium model had merely shown that the 
biological species models could be applied to the fossil record, then 
there would have been little controversy outside paleontology. The 
fossil record would have just provided further data for biological 
orthodoxy, as paleontologists such as Simpson (1944, 1953) did during 
the Neo-Darwinian synthesis of the 1950s (Gould, 1983; Eldredge, 1985b). 
In the 1960s, evolutionary biologists often took an extreme 
panselectionist position. Natural selection was said to be constantly 
acting on every tiny feature of an organism, weeding out even the 
smallest imperfection. Species are arbitrary entities which constantly 
track environmental change, like a ball rolling across hilly terrain. 
Indeed, the popular metaphor of the time was the "adaptive landscape." 
Species were always trying to reach the "adaptive peaks" of the 
"landscape" and were continually modified in response to the shifting of 
the peaks beneath them.
<p>The discovery of stasis in most species for millions of years was an 
fact that biologists did not expect (as even Mayr, 1992, concedes). At 
first, they dismissed it as genetic homeostasis or stabilizing selection 
(Charlesworth et al., 1983; Levinton, 1983; Lande, 1985). But such 
models are only appropriate on scales of a few generations, or at most a 
few thousand years. No environment is so constant that stabilizing 
selection can act for millions of years. This type of explanation is 
typical of reductionist evolutionary genetics (e.g., Dawkins, 1976), 
which treats organisms as conduits for genes, and even defines evolution 
as "change in gene frequencies through time." As Mayr (1992) points out, 
such reductionism is now slowly going out of vogue, as biologists 
realize that organisms are integrated wholes, with many different genes 
interacting in complex ways.</p>
<p>More impressive are demonstrations of species stability <em>in spite of 
well documented environmental change</em>. The fluctuations of 
glacial-interglacial cycles during the last three million years of the Ice
Ages are about as extreme a climactic change as our planet experiences. Yet 
studies from land mammals (White and Harris, 1977; Barnosky, 1987) to 
microscopic marine ostracodes (Cronin, 1985, 1987) document extreme 
stability in most species in spite of these changes. Rather than adapt 
to new environments, species migrate back and forth in response to them.</p>
<p>My own research on the Eocene-Oligocene transition about 34 million 
years ago (Prothero and Berggren, 1992) documents a similar phenomenon. 
Most of the mammals from the Badlands discussed above (Prothero and 
Shubin, 1983; Prothero, 1992) show remarkable stability over an interval 
of well documented climactic change (<em>Figure 2</em>). Evidence from 
paleosols and land floras (Retallack, 1992) document a striking cooling 
and drying event across this boundary, with a woodland vegetation 
(greater than 1000 mm annual precipitation) replaced by a wooded 
grassland (500 mm annual precipitation). According to Wolfe (1992), mean 
annual temperature declined almost 13&#186 C, and the annual range of 
temperature increased dramatically from 5&#186 C to about 25&#186 
C. Sedimentological evidence from eastern Wyoming (Evanoff et al., 1992) 
shows an abrupt transition from moist floodplains to semi-arid 
landscapes with abundant wind-blown volcaniclastic dust. Most of these 
events took place over a few thousand years. This is certainly one of 
the most severe climactic events since the extinction of the dinosaurs.</p>
<p>Late Eocene land snails (Evanoff et al., 1992) were large-shelled 
subtropical taxa now typical of central Mexico, indicating a mean annual 
range of temperature of 16.5&#186 C and annual precipitation of about 
450 mm. In the early Oligocene, these were replaced by drought-tolerant 
small-shelled taxa indicative of a warm-temperate open woodland with a 
pronounced dry season. Reptiles and amphibians (Hutchison, 1992) show a 
trend toward cooling and drying, with aquatic forms (crocodilians, 
freshwater turtles, and salamanders) replaced by land tortoises; size 
reduction in turtles also indicates increased aridity.</p>
<p>In spite of all these changes, however, only one lineage of fossil 
mammal underwent a gradual change. All of the rest either remained 
unchanged through the interval, or went extinct, with new species 
replacing them. None showed the panselectionist prediction of gradually 
evolving to track their changing environment.</p>
<p>If species are static through millions of years in spite of 
environmental changes, then there must be some sort of homeostatic 
mechanism that preserves this stability beyond what traditional 
reductionist Neo-Darwinism once postulated. Mayr (1992) argues that it 
is merely the integration of species as complex wholes, so that
small-scale changes are insufficient to upset the complex balance of 
integrated genes. Others suggest that fundamental developmental 
constraints play an important role in restricting the possible avenues 
of change (Gould and Lewontin, 1979; Kauffman, 1983). Still others 
suggest that there might be properties of species that may not have been 
discovered yet by geneticists and evolutionary biologists, properties 
which operate on scales of millions of generations and years (Vrba and 
Eldredge, 1984).</p>
<p>Instead of the "rolling ball" metaphor so favored by evolutionary 
biologists, perhaps species are more like a <em>polyhedron</em>, which can roll 
rapidly over from face to face, but resists change when it is sitting on 
one of its stable faces (Gould, 1980b). Change only occurs when the 
threshold necessary to tip it over has been exceeded, and then the 
polyhedron will resist further change until that threshold is once again 
reached. Between stable states (the faces), however, the transitions are 
very rapid. This kind of phenomenon is very similar to catastrophe 
theory (Schubert, 1992) and other theoretical models of discontinuous 
change (Masters, 1992).</p>

<a name="sorting">
<h2>Species Sorting and Macroevolution</h2>
</a>

The other major implication of the idea that species are static for 
millions of years is the implication for the reality of species. 
Traditionally, species were considered the sum of all their component 
populations, and all processes (such as selection) operated on the level 
of individual and populations. But if species are not just arbitrary 
slices of a continuum, but distinct entities with their own history of 
"birth" (speciation) and "death" (extinction), then perhaps species have 
characteristics that operate on a <em>hierarchical level above that of the 
genes, the individual, or the population</em>. This concept of <em>hierarchy</em> 
(species are made up of populations, populations are made of up 
individuals, individuals are made up of genes, etc.) has important 
implications for evolutionary biology (Gould and Eldredge, 1977; Gould, 
1982a, 1982b; Vrba and Eldredge, 1984; Salthe, 1985; Eldredge, 1985b; 
Gould, 1985; Vrba and Gould, 1986).
<p>Although glimmerings of this idea were present in the original 1972 
Eldredge and Gould paper, it first emerged explicitly in a brief paper 
by Stanley (1975) followed by his stimulating and controversial book 
Macroevolution (1979). Stanley called this concept "species selection," 
and it was the basis for a new round of debates for over a decade. Since 
the original proposal, Vrba and Gould (1986) have since argued that it 
should be called "species sorting," since the process is not really 
analogous to natural selection on the level of individual populations.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, the argument postulates that species are real entities 
which have characteristics that are more than the sum of the 
characteristics of their component populations. When two or more species 
come into competition, the differential survival which sorts out the 
"winners" and "losers" may be due to these intrinsic species properties, 
rather than natural selection on individuals or populations. The causes 
of the survival of a given species cannot be reduced directly to the 
survival of its component populations, but seems to be due to properties 
which are species-specific.</p>
<p>For example, the tendency of a group to speciate rapidly or slowly is 
not a property of its component individuals. Organisms do not speciate, 
species do. Elisabeth Vrba (1980, 1985) has suggested that the antelopes 
of Africa provide an example of this. The relatively conservative impala 
clade seems to have an intrinsically low rate of speciation. Only three 
very similar species in one lineage are known for the last five million 
years. By contrast, the wildebeest tribe has speciated profusely during 
the same period of time, with multiple episodes of evolutionary 
branching and extinction. Hansen (1978, 1982) argued that marine snails 
without planktonic larvae speciated more rapidly than those who disperse 
their larvae as plankton all over the ocean. The less mobile
non-planktotrophic snails are more likely to be genetically isolated than 
species whose planktonic larvae spread their genes all over the ocean. 
Since the larval condition is a property of the species, not merely of 
its component individuals, it might represent an example of species 
sorting.</p>
<p>Two groups of South American burrowing rodents, the tuco-tucos (genus 
<em>Ctenomys</em>) and the coruros (genus <em>Spalacopus</em>) both have evolved 
adaptations for a burrowing, gopher-like existence (Vrba and Gould, 
1986). Tuco-tucos are far more speciose the coruros, even though they 
have the same ecology and home range. The difference lies in the fact 
that tuco-tucos have very low gene flow, so they can speciate rapidly, 
while coruros are genetically homogeneous. Other possible examples of 
species sorting were reviewed by Gilinsky (1986).</p>
<p>Traditional Neo-Darwinists have failed to see any difference between 
traditional natural selection and species sorting (Mayr, 1992; Hecht and 
Hoffman, 1986; Hoffman and Hecht, 1986; Hoffman, 1982, 1984, 1989, 
1992). In reading the literature, it is clear that the debaters are 
talking past each other, since each has fundamentally different 
perceptions of the world. Traditional Neo-Darwinists come from a 
reductionist viewpoint that cannot see species as entities, even after 
all the evidence that has accumulated. The opposing camp sees the world 
as hierarchically ordered, with each level having its own reality. As 
long as this fundamental difference in worldview underlies the argument, 
neither side will convince the other, even with the clearest possible 
examples.</p>
<p>More is at stake here than the reality of species, however. If 
species sorting is real, then the processes operating on the level of 
species (<em>macroevolutionary processes</em>) are not necessarily the same as 
those operating on the level of individuals and populations 
(<em>microevolutionary processes</em>). In other words, macroevolution may not 
just be microevolution scaled up. After decades of experiments on fruit 
flies, the most interesting evolutionary phenomena might only be studied 
in the fossil record, or in the embryology lab. With publications, 
prestige, and grant money on the line, the traditional research 
community of evolutionary biologists do not want to find themselves 
suddenly irrelevant to the most interesting issues in macroevolution. On 
the other hand, paleontologists have begun to shed their subservience to 
evolutionary biology (Gould, 1983), and assert the importance of the 
fossil record for detecting phenomena that are too large in scale for 
biologists to observe (Gould, 1982a, 1982b, 1985; Eldredge, 1985b). 
Clearly, all of evolutionary biology is undergoing ferment and change. 
To the paraphrase the old Chinese proverb, we indeed live in interesting 
times.</p>

Global Conspiracies, &amp; The Mark of the Beast </I></P></CENTER>

<P>As I write this introduction to the excerpt from my new book on <I>Bible
Prophecy: Failure or Fulfillment?</I>, the movie Independence Day set a
new record of $96 million gross on its opening weekend. The movie opens
with a youthful technician in the SETI program headquarters checking the
monitors for signs of extra terrestrial intelligence, while his boom box
blasts the rock song &quot;It's the End of the World.&quot; For the erstwhile
Earthlings in the movie it almost was the end of the world as the space
aliens were not exactly the friendly types depicted in <I>ET, Close Encounters
of the Third Kind</I>, and other Sci Fi blockbusters. </P>

<P>Why are we so fascinated by &quot;end of the world&quot; stories? Sure,
<I>Independence Day</I> owes some of its success to a huge marketing campaign
that began on Superbowl Sunday seven months before (telling viewers this
would be their last Superbowl Sunday party); and to the spectacular special
effects depicting the explosion of the Empire State Building, the White
House, and other national monuments. But there is something deeper here,
that goes to the heart of our psyche-the belief that one way or another
we are doomed. Sci Fi authors and film producers are simply capitalizing
on a theme that has been with us since biblical times. </P>

<P>In Skeptic, Vol. 3, #2, I wrote a review of Hal Lindsey's book <I>Planet
Earth-2000 A.D.</I>, in which I showed that as we approach the big millennium
date doomsday warnings will proliferate in pop culture. Lindsey (like all
doomsayers) was cautious, however, hedging his prediction with alternatives
for 2007 or even 2048 (when he will be long gone), just in case 2000 comes
and goes without incident. In my book I review all the major biblical prophecies,
especially those concerned with the end times. In this essay (the final
chapter from the book) I link biblical prophecies of the end times (the
&quot;mark of the beast&quot; and all that) with modern global conspiracy
theories that involve black helicopters, Hong Kong Gurkhas, militia, and
the so-called &quot;New World Order&quot; which are supposed to signal
that the end is nigh. So before you decide to eat, drink, and be merry,
read on.</P>

<CENTER><P><FONT SIZE=+1>Modern Technology &amp; Other Signs of the End</FONT></P></CENTER>

<P>The Bible, especially the book of Revelation, is filled with allegorical
stories and symbolic tales. The problem is in interpretation. Are these
stories prophetic warnings for us, or social commentary for the readers
of the time of their writing? Fundamentalists and conspiratorialists try
desperately to stretch apocalyptic writings (that were about the politics
of their time) to fit modern times. They also try to fit poetic pictures
of destruction into modern technology. The most obvious of these is the
idea that fire raining down from heaven means nuclear-armed missiles. Another
is the idea that the phrase &quot;every eye shall see him&quot; (Rev. 1:7)
refers to the return of Christ being seen worldwide on television.</P>

<P>Hal Lindsey has speculated that the demonic locusts, the plague of the
fifth trumpet, represent helicopters. Here is the actual description of
the locusts from Rev. 9:7-10:</P>

<UL>
<P><TT>In appearance the locusts were like horses arrayed for battle; on
their heads were what looked like crowns of gold; their faces were like
human faces, their hair like women's hair, and their teeth like lions'
teeth; they had scales like iron breastplates, and the noise of their wings
was like the noise of many chariots rushing into battle. They have tails
like scorpions, and stings, and their power of hurting men for five months
lies in their tails. </TT></P>
</UL>

<P>In that their wings make a rushing noise, that helicopters could be
said to look as if they have stinger-like tails, and that the locusts'
armor could be said to be a description of the metal skin of helicopters,
the locusts could be stretched to fit these modern machines, if one uses
a good deal of imagination. Hal Lindsey apparently took the locusts with
faces of men as being the crew of the helicopters as seen in the cockpit
from without. Just how it is that military helicopters would torture, but
not kill, for five months is not explained. On the other hand, locusts
commonly live for five months, and the prophet Joel's locusts were also
like horses (see Joel 2:4-9). It is also hard to figure how they could
have come out of the smoke from the bottomless pit (Rev 9:3) or why their
king would be Abaddon, the angel of the bottomless pit (Rev. 9:11). </P>

<P>Even if helicopters do not work that well in fulfilling the imagery
of Revelation, they do figure in conspiracy theories. Listen to any fundamentalist
radio station for a while and you will hear reports of ominous black (i.e.
unmarked) helicopters harassing good conservative folks. Supposedly they
were hovering over the Branch Davidian compound in Waco just before the
tanks went in. People have claimed that the helicopters are often filled
with men wearing unusual uniforms, hence the speculation that they are
carrying foreign troops and that these are trial runs for the U.N. takeover
of the U.S., eventually instituting the world government that will be ruled
by the Antichrist. Among the people who claim to have been buzzed and harassed
by low-flying black helicopters are Christians who are home-schooling their
children to keep them out of the secular school system. Despite the popularity
and availability of video cameras and despite reports of repeated harassment,
none of these sightings have ever been substantiated. This last minor fact
has not reduced the fears concerning the infernal machines in the least.
If anything, the ability of the black helicopters to avoid detection has
added to their satanic mystique. </P>

<P>Another report of foreign troops being brought in to take away our rights
was the assertion that the federal crime bill of 1994 had in it a provision
for bringing in foreign police-specifically from Hong Kong-to enforce laws
in America. The idea was that, unlike American cops, the foreigners would
not have any compunction about firing on a crowd of American citizens.
There was even one report that the police being brought over from Hong
Kong were Gurkhas, troops with a legendary reputation for savagery. </P>

<P>Reality was something else again. While there are about a thousand Gurkhas
stationed in Hong Kong, they are used for border patrol only. Members of
this elite corps of the British army are not so much noted for savagery,
but rather are famous for their honesty, trustworthiness, sense of personal
honor, and most of all for their valor. Since 1911 Gurkhas have won 13
Victoria Crosses, the British equivalent of the Congressional Medal of
Honor. The likelihood that these elite troops, so fiercely loyal to the
Queen, would be loaned out to the U.S. to kill Americans is nil. However,
there is just the smallest grain of truth to the rumor that the government
was going to bring in Hong Kong police. On page 843 of HR 3355, section
5108 directed the Attorney General, the heads of the FBI and the Drug Enforcement
Agency (DEA), along with the Commissioners of the Immigration and Naturalization
Service (INS) and the Customs Service to recruit former Royal Hong Kong
Police officers into Federal law enforcement positions. The true story
is this. Hong Kong is shortly due to revert to the People's Republic of
China. Thus, the officers of the Royal Police will soon be without either
a job or a home. The fact that the INS was involved in the recruitment
plan should tell anyone that these officers would be brought in as naturalized
citizens. Since Hong Kong is an international port, its police are experienced
in coping with black market goods and drug smuggling, hence the participation
of the FBI, the DEA, and the Customs Service in the recruitment program.
This is a far cry from bringing in foreign police for crowd control. In
any case, this recruitment plan was dropped from the final version of the
bill. </P>

<P>Another horror story of the impending world government is that they
have already subverted our money, planting occult symbols on dollar bills
that hint at the drive to a globalist dictatorship. This was done during
the (infamous) Roosevelt administration. The symbol in question is the
pyramid with an eye on the back of the dollar bill. Below it is the Latin
inscription <I>Novus Ordo Seculorum</I>, which translates as &quot;New
World Order.&quot; Or does it? What we have here is a compound error made
up of bad Latin, bad spelling, and poor history. Those readers who, like
myself, took some Latin in high school, might remember that the suffix
&quot;orum&quot; is the genitive plural for nouns in the second declension.
Seculorum would have to be plural and mean &quot;of the worlds,&quot; which
seems a rather clumsy phrasing. It certainly would be if in fact the word
in question was &quot;seculorum.&quot; Actually, in their desire to read
an apocalyptic conspiracy into our currency, the millenarian crowd has
added the letter &quot;u&quot; between the &quot;c&quot; and the &quot;l&quot;
of the word printed on the dollar, which is seclorum or &quot;of the ages.&quot;
Thus, far from saying &quot;New World Order,&quot; <I>Novus Ordo Seclorum</I>
reads &quot;New Order of the Ages.&quot; Since this symbol and motto are
on the back of our country's Great Seal and were put there when the nation
was being founded, they represent the revolutionary sentiment that by dispensing
with kings, whose rule was autocratic and based on force, and replacing
that system with a republic based on reason, balance of powers, and self
rule, the founders of our nation were creating a new order for the ages.
</P>

<P>Another phrase to be found on the back of the dollar bill, in fact one
more prominently displayed than the Latin motto as well as being written
in English is: &quot;In God We Trust.&quot; For some reason this phrase
and its obvious implications seem to be consistently overlooked by conspiracy
theorists. </P>

<P>Other excursions into modern monetary subversion involve credit cards,
bar codes, and other technologies that could potentially be a modern version
of the Mark of the Beast. The most technologically sophisticated of these
would be a computer microchip inserted under the skin either in the forehead
or the back of the hand. Such technology is actually available and has
been used to locate sheep and cattle grazing on range-lands. However, such
solid state electronics are extremely vulnerable to electromagnetic fields,
such as those generated by television screens. Sitting too near the boob-tube
could erase the Mark of the Beast from many a couch potato. </P>

<P>There are, of course, other technologies that suggest themselves as
potential Marks of the Beast. Whole books have been written on how the
bar code is a prelude to it. The cashless society is another concept that
fits into the idea of having to take the mark if one would buy or sell.
Thus, credit cards in general and Visa cards in particular are candidates
for the Mark of the Beast. In the case of Visa cards, we have a dubious
excursion into numerology, which should, like astrology and palmistry,
be anathema to fundamentalist Christians. The basic scheme of numerology
is that every letter in the alphabet is assigned a number from one to nine
as follows: </P>

<UL>
<UL>
<UL>
<UL>
<PRE><U>1 : 2 : 3 : 4 : 5 : 6 : 7 : 8 : 9 
</U>A : B : C : D : E : F : G : H : I 
J : K : L : M : N : O : P : Q : R 
S : T : U : V : W : X : Y : Z :</PRE>
</UL>
</UL>
</UL>
</UL>

<P>Then the numbers of each word or name analyzed are added up. If a two
or three digit number results, those numbers are added in a column until
a number from 1 to 9 is reached. These nine numbers have specific psychological
characteristics assigned to them, much as do the 12 signs of the Zodiac.
Applying this system to the word VISA, we get the following:</P>

<CENTER><PRE><FONT SIZE=+1>V I S A 
4+9+1+1=15 1+5=6</FONT></PRE></CENTER>

<P>In the original numerological system, 6 stands for natural harmony as
in the six colors of the spectrum. However, in order to make the Visa card
come out as the Mark of the Beast, those fundamentalists who indulge in
this sort of nonsense substitute biblical symbolism wherein 6 is the number
of imperfection. Thus, by extrapolation, 6 means the same as 666. And <I>voila!</I>
we have the Number of the Beast! </P>

<P>(I will concede two items. First, while they do look for satanic conspiracies
in many innocent aspects of the mundane world, very few fundamentalists
involve themselves in interpretations as arcane as the numerological value
of the Visa card. Second, the fear of some form of mandatory identification
card and its misuse by a centralized government, even on the national level,
is a reasonable one. While I like the convenience of my charge cards, untraceable
cash transactions, which cannot be monitored by either a government or
a corporation, constitute a democratically sound safeguard against intrusions
into one's privacy. It is when these entirely valid concerns are linked
to paranoid millennial fantasies that bizarre interpretations result. If
we must interpret every universal identification system in apocalyptic
terms, then every American citizen, upon being assigned a social security
number, has taken the Mark of the Beast.) </P>

<P>So far I have dealt with supposed symptoms of the satanic New World
Order. Let us now look at the institutions millenarians and others of their
ilk see as the movers behind this globalist conspiracy.</P>

<CENTER><P><FONT SIZE=+1>Global Conspiracies</FONT></P></CENTER>

<P>Those who see the world in terms of a system under Satan's control,
who see themselves-as many fundamentalists do-as being under siege, not
only see a satanic pattern in world events of today, but see them as entrenched
in history as well, particularly in the events of the twentieth century.
They also see the Satanic conspiracy as having so pervasively infiltrated
our system that virtually no one in power is untouched by it. For example,
John McManus, present head of the John Birch Society, said that not only
was the Reagan administration thoroughly infiltrated by agents of the New
World Order, and the public brainwashed by the &quot;liberal media,&quot;
but that William Bennett and Rush Limbaugh were both brainwashed by the
New World Order (Live From L.A. KKLA November 29, 1993). Since not even
Rush Limbaugh can be trusted, it is not surprising that McManus also pointed
out that the heads of CBS, NBC, ABC, the <I>New York Times</I>, the <I>Washington
Post</I>, the <I>Los Angeles Times</I>, the <I>Wall Street Journal</I>,
<I>Time, Newsweek, U.S. News and World Report</I>, and the <I>National
Review</I> are all members of the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), seen
as one of the chief architects of the New World Order. </P>

<P>Besides media heads, who else is a member of the CFR? According to Gary
Kah in En Route to Global Occupation (as well as other sources), former
and present members of the CFR include Adlai Stevenson, Dwight D. Eisenhower,
Cyrus Vance, Zbigniew Brzezinski, Paul Volker, Lane Kirkland, Henry Kissinger,
George Schultz, Nelson Rockefeller, David Rockefeller, Alan Greenspan,
Jeanne Kirkpatrick, George Bush, Richard M. Nixon, George McGovern, Michael
Dukakis, Donna Shalala, Richard Cheney, Colin Powell, Jimmy Carter, John
F. Kennedy, Robert Kennedy, Edward Kennedy, Jesse Jackson, and many others.
That people whose political beliefs cover such a broad spectrum are all
members of the CFR should tell anyone that the organization, in actual
fact, has no particular political leaning of its own. In short, the membership
is too broad, varied, and extensive to be an indicator of any significance.
Rather than revealing an entrenched conspiracy, this partial membership
list indicates a prestigious organization that people prominent in politics,
education, the media, and finance frequently join. Kah even admits that
Dukakis only joined the CFR after his unsuccessful bid for the presidency.
</P>

<P>Other organizations high on the enemies list in this basic conspiracy
scenario are the Trilateral Commission, the Club of Rome, the Bilderberg
Group, and lesser organizations such as the Aspen Institute. All of these
share with the CFR the qualities of being unofficial advisory bodies with
distinguished membership rosters. </P>

<P>Official government and international organizations in the supposed
conspiracy include the Federal Reserve System (FRS) and, of course, the
United Nations, the world government itself. Facts have little credibility
in the minds of conspiracy addicts when it comes to the major players in
their cherished scenario. That the UN is unable to control or bring into
obedience one warlord whose clan controls one section of one third-world
city would seem to make it a paper tiger. The same is true of the European
Community, the other major contender for the role of Empire of the Antichrist.
That the EC was either unable or unwilling to intervene effectively in
Bosnia, its own back yard without American assistance, makes it a bit of
a dud as the Neo-Roman Empire. Conspiracy theorists counter that the U.N.
and the EC are allowing the conditions in Bosnia and Somalia to deteriorate
for various reasons of their own, among them being a draconian program
of population control. Of course, if either of these two institutions were
to intervene effectively, these same theorists would use those events as
evidence of the growing power of the UN and the EC. Thus, their belief
is confirmed regardless of what happens, a sure sign of intellectual self-deception.
</P>

<P>As Michael Howard points out in his 1989 book <I>The Occult Conspiracy</I>:
&quot;Conspiracy theorists regard the UN with suspicion because of the
alleged involvement of the CFR in its creation&quot; (Howard 1989, p. 167).
The Council on Foreign Relations was formed when the United States failed
to join the League of Nations, which had been set up after World War I
chiefly by President Woodrow Wilson and his special advisor Col. E. M.
House. In 1919 Col. House met with members of a British group called the
Round Table that was the brain-child of 19th-century diamond and gold magnate,
Cecil Rhodes. Rhodes was obsessed with the vision of a world government
based on British values, and had set up the Round Table as a means toward
that end. (This, of course, makes Rhodes scholars suspect as agents of
the New World Order.) Members of the Round Table agreed to set up a non-governmental
advisory body aimed at influencing nations toward peaceful resolution of
conflicts. In England it was called the Institute for International Affairs
(IIA); in America it became the CFR. An unofficial Anglo-American advisory
group or think tank hardly fits the role of end-time bogey. However, the
CFR does have a strong internationalist bent. In many ways the organization's
lack of ideology has been used against it. As Howard puts it (p. 166):</P>

<UL>
<P><TT>In the eyes of their opponents the CFR is currently dedicated to
destroying the sovereignty of the United States, reversing the democratic
process which instigated the 1776 American Revolution, promoting internationalism
and the foundation of a world super state embracing both capitalism and
Communism in a new political order. The evidence for this seems to be largely
based on the neutral stance adopted by the CFR in American politics. </TT></P>
</UL>

<P>Formerly, the CFR was viewed by its critics as being an elitist right-wing
power group and was even accused of financing Hitler's rise to power. No
support has ever been found for this claim. </P>

<P>Next to the CFR, the Trilateral Commission is perhaps the most anathematized
international advisory group in existence. Founded in 1970 and having a
membership drawn from Japan, Europe, and North America, its stated goal
is to &quot;encourage closer cooperation among these three democratic industrialized
regions&quot; (item 15479, Encyclopedia of Associations, 1995). The Club
of Rome has a broader appeal, being concerned with issues as varied as
environmental degradation, overpopulation, economics, etc. The Bilderberg
Group was originally founded in 1954 as an anti-Communist organization,
but softened its stance in the wake of detente. </P>

<P>All of these organizations have properties that lay them open to attack
from the more paranoid among us. First of all, since they are composed
of an international elite, there is the suspicion, no doubt somewhat justified,
that their members think that they know better than the common man or woman
how the world ought to be run. Second, since they often discuss sensitive
issues, they often keep their meetings secret. This implies covert operations
and clandestine plots. Third, given that all of these organizations wish
to draw upon people influential in the worlds of finance, politics and
media, there is considerable overlap of membership among them. This gives
the appearance of an international conspiracy. Certainly the potential
for elitism and conspiracy exists among these organizations, but the varied
political views of the members would tend to act as a safeguard against
such an occurrence. Howard gives this word of caution with regard to such
organizations (p. 163):</P>

<UL>
<P><TT>In general, as far as it can be detected at all by those who are
directly in contact with its working, this influence can be characterized
as benign. However, the unpalatable fact must also be faced that in some
instances the pursuit and exercise of power in the political arena can
have a corrupting effect, especially when it encounters the inherent weakness
of human nature. </TT></P>
</UL>

<P>Probably the greatest weakness of human nature seen in these organizations
is in their inherent failure, because they are so much a part of the established
system, to comprehend or anticipate what might variously be called novelty,
chaos, or serendipity. As two examples of this failure to comprehend the
curves thrown us by reality, consider that it was the professionals who
got us into Vietnam. Consider also that the experts were caught just as
flat-footed as the rest of us at the break-up of the Warsaw pact and the
fall of the Soviet Union. </P>

<P>The Federal Reserve System (FRS), along with any international banking
system, is another source of paranoia for the conspiracy crowd. Any control
or manipulation of the money supply is assumed to be part of a monetary
conspiracy inimical both to individual freedom and national sovereignty.
McManus has claimed that our national debt is being deliberately increased
to put us in hock to international bankers as part of the plan to destroy
our national sovereignty and create the New World Order. The FRS, or the
Fed, created by congress in 1913, has the function of controlling the money
supply, which it does by buying and selling government bonds, regulating
the rate at which commercial banks borrow money from the Federal Reserve
Bank, and regulating the requirements as to what percentage of commercial
banks' assets are held in the Federal Reserve. If the Fed buys government
bonds, reduces the discount rate to commercial banks, or lowers their Federal
Reserve requirements, the money supply is increased, interest rates fall
and inflation increases. When the Fed sells bonds, raises the discount
rate or the Federal Reserve requirements, less money circulates, interest
rates rise, and inflation is reduced. Obviously businesses are affected,
often much against their will, by the policies of the Fed. Hence, it is
not always well thought of, and among conspiracy theorists it has become
viewed as an agent of the New World Order, this despite the fact that its
present chairman, Alan Greenspan, was a prot&eacute;g&eacute; of the late
Ayn Rand and is strongly influenced by Libertarian economic theory.</P>

<CENTER><P><FONT SIZE=+1>Templars, Freemasons &amp; the Dreaded Illuminati</FONT></P></CENTER>

<P>It is understandable that those who see the world as rushing to its
final doom are likely to see any group urging international cooperation
as being an instrument of the Antichrist. Instead of seeing the CFR and
the Trilateral Commission as idealistic and somewhat elitist brain trusts,
millenarians see them as a network of semi-secret societies wielding power
illegitimately, not merely to influence but to control sovereign national
governments. But whence came these powerful shadow regimes? Conspiracy
theorists trace them all the way back to the Knights Templar, who, starting
out as crusaders and protectors of pilgrims, supposedly fell under various
influences including pagan mystery religions and the Assassins of Alamut.
Having become corrupt and rich, the Templars tried to control the wealth
of Europe but were valiantly stopped by Philip the Fair of France (1268-1314).
Upon being put to the question the leaders of the Templars revealed that
they worshiped a goat-headed idol called Baphomet, which they anointed
with the blood of unbaptized babies, and that they ritually defiled crucifixes
and practiced sodomy in their secret rites. Gary Kah and other conspiracy
theorists report this story with evident relish. The Templars, after all,
make wonderful foils. As the first internationalists whose wealth and banking
system made them the creditors of and potential powers behind the governments
of rising national states, they resemble the picture the theorists in their
paranoia have painted of the CFR, the FRS, the Rockefellers and the Rothschilds.
That they were secretly practicing satanic rites confirms the theorists
in their assurance that their modern counterparts are part of the Kingdom
of the Beast. All of us who grew up reading Sir Walter Scott's Ivanhoe
are predisposed to believe the worst of the Templars from the start. After
all, Bois-Gilbert and the other heavies in the classic were all Templars.
</P>

<P>But how much of this story is true? And how does it relate to modern
times? The Templars were obviously quite powerful and somewhat corrupt.
By the beginning of the 13th century, three crusading orders-the Templars,
the Knights of St. John, and the Teutonic Knights-between them controlled
40% of Europe's frontiers and as such exerted considerable influence in
the courts of Europe. The Templars made money by ferrying crusaders and
pilgrims to the Holy Land and importing spices from there to Europe. As
their wealth increased, they became the bankers of Europe and they became
increasingly lax in fulfilling their religious vows. They conspired with
the Sultan of Egypt to thwart Frederick II's crusade, and by 1254 were
at open war with another crusading order, the Knights Hospitaler. When
Acre, the last Christian stronghold in the Levant, fell to the Moslems
in 1291 the Templars were expelled from the Holy Land. Now they were no
longer even nominally crusaders. In 1307 Philip the Fair found himself
facing bankruptcy and owed the Templars large sums of money. Thus, he made
common cause with Pope Clement V to destroy the order, whose increasing
wealth and independence were alarming the Church. The Grand Master of the
Templars, Jacques de Molay, came to Paris that same year to discuss a new
crusade. He was arrested, and Templar lodges and treasuries were seized
throughout France. Pope Clement issued a bull ordering the arrest of all
members of the order throughout Christendom. It was then that the Templars
made their confessions either under torture or the threat of it. Considering
that both the King of France and the Pope needed some criminal charge upon
which to base the seizure of Templar treasuries, it is hardly surprising
that the order was found to have become heretical. To this day it is unclear
which charges if any made against the Templars were true. De Molay protested
his innocence even as he was being burned at the stake in 1314. </P>

<P>The significance of the Templars is that there is a link between them
and Freemasonry. Late in the Middle Ages powerful craft guilds flourished
in Europe. But, as the result in the decline in the building of new cathedrals
and the subsequent drop in guild membership, the masons began to allow
men not involved in the trade to join as honorary members. These men became
known as &quot;free and accepted masons&quot; or Freemasons. In some countries,
after the fall of the Templars their remnants were absorbed into the Masonic
Guilds. Much of the medieval tradition, however, was embellished in the
17th and 18th centuries when the Freemasons adopted the rites and trappings
of various chivalric orders. Though the organization is not specifically
Christian, it began with a distinctly Protestant, anticlerical bias. The
Templars, seen as prototypes of Protestant martyrs, were taken as a chivalric
ideal to aspire to. So it is in modern times that the Masonic club for
teenage boys is called the DeMolay, and the Knights Templar is one of the
advanced lodges in Freemasonry. Without going into a detailed history of
the Masons, let me just point out that their system of secret lodges allowed
for open discussion of politics in countries where voicing one's opinion
could result in imprisonment or death. In Latin countries Freemasonry tends
to attract free thinkers and anticlericals. This fact plus the association
of the Templars with the Masons has laid the latter open to all the charges
leveled against the former, not only by fundamentalists but by European
and South American dictators. In volume 22 of the <I>Encyclopedia Britannica</I>
the true significance of the Masonic lodges is mentioned in a discussion
of the history of Italy in the late 1700's (p. 223): </P>

<UL>
<P><TT>In the Italy of the old regime, there had been no representative
political life. But the increase in the number of Masonic Lodges at the
end of the 18th century demonstrated the desire for secret discussion of
problems different from those that were agitating the academies and the
agrarian societies. Not all the Freemasons became supporters of the Revolution
and the French, but many of them did so. The moderate and constitutional
demands of the Masonic Lodges began to be accompanied by more democratic
demands, and there were in Milan, Bologna, Rome, and Naples cells of Illuminati,
republican free-thinkers, after the pattern recently established in Bavaria
by Adam Weishaupt. </TT></P>
</UL>

<P>But were the Illuminati really such radicals? Indeed they were, and
they were justly considered a threat by virtually every government in Europe.
And what were the Illuminist beliefs that were so threatening to the governments
of Weishaupt's day? Among them were such dangerous ideas as universal suffrage,
equality of the sexes, and complete freedom of religion. Other Illuminist
beliefs were of the utopian socialist variety. They included the abolition
of social authority, private property and national states. Humanity, in
the Illuminist vision, would live in anarchic harmony and universal brotherhood,
and would enjoy peace and free love. This may make the Illuminati sound
like a cross between Marxists and 1960's flower children, and is no doubt
the image that so horrifies fundamentalist conspiracy theorists. But all
such comparisons are doomed to error, because implicit in them is a disregard
for historical context. To understand the Illuminati, one must understand
the politics of Europe in the late 18th century, the time of the Enlightenment.
In reaction to the excesses of the religious wars of the 1600s the intellectuals
of the 1700s were rational, secular and anticlerical. The growth of science
and rationalism provoked the thinkers of that day to question everything,
and they found much that did not stand up well in the light of reason.
Thus, in addition to being rational and secular, they were also democratic
and egalitarian. And seeing the concentration of wealth and power in the
hands of the nobility and the state religions, they considered the abolition
of private property a necessary step to change what was clearly an unjust
social order. Despite the prevalence of democratic ideals in the philosophy
of the time, most of the states of Europe were ruled by kings who were
absolute despots. (Remember that the American Revolution was just starting
the year the Illuminati came into being.) These powers naturally resisted
the democratic flow of their culture tenaciously, so tenaciously in fact
that it took the rest of the 18th century, all of the 19th century, and
part of the 20th to remove them. Thus it was not until late in the 1800s
that the French were free of both the Bourbons and the descendants of Napoleon
Bonaparte. It was not until the end of World War I that the Hohenzollerns
of Prussia, the Hapsburgs of Austria, and the Romanovs of Russia were removed,
and the empires of Austria-Hungary and the Ottoman Turks broken up. Indeed,
we are still today dealing with the aftermath of the persistence of these
monarchies. </P>

<P>As a graphic indication of how the battle lines were drawn, consider
that as part of the Illuminist initiation ceremony the candidate was led
into a room containing an empty throne, a crown, a scepter, and a sword,
and was invited to take them up. But, he or she was told, if they did so
they would be denied entry into the order. The crowned heads of Europe
were not likely to take kindly to a secret society harboring such sentiments,
nor were the established religious authorities. This, coupled with the
anticlerical and anti-Christian bias of the Illuminati, made them even
better foils than the Templars had been in the Middle Ages. Thus they were
branded as atheists, Satanists, assassins and whatever else would feed
a sensationalist, fear-mongering campaign. (I should point out that as
Marxist as the abolition of property sounds, a variant of that principle-land
redistribution-was practiced in America when, following the Revolution,
the estates of Tories were seized, broken up, and given to landless families.
Since most of the newly independent colonies still limited voting rights
to property owners, this meant that the number of voters was increased
significantly.) </P>

<P>Are the Illuminati still active? Are they the unifying power behind
the CFR, the Trilateral Commission, the Bilderbergers, and the Club of
Rome? Are they the secret masters of worldwide Free masonry? For the most
part the Illuminati were absorbed into other revolutionary groups. No doubt
many joined the French Revolution or shifted in the 19th century from utopian
socialism to Marxism. There is no evidence that they exist today. </P>

<P>On the other hand the influence of Freemasonry is such that men holding
to its ideals were instrumental in creating one of the 20th century's greatest
powers, a power whose global influence and military might is greater than
any known in the history of the world, a power viewed by many small nations
as a distinct threat to their sovereignty. In fact, one of these nations
has identified this power with Satan. This ominous power is the United
States of America. </P>

<P>Most of the founders of our nation, including George Washington, were
Masons. Such was the influence of Freemasonry that the back of the Great
Seal, that symbol on our dollar bill that so terrifies conspiracy theorists,
contains the pyramid with an eye in it, which is a Masonic symbol.</P>

<CENTER><P><FONT SIZE=+1>Humanists and New Agers</FONT></P></CENTER>

<P>Not only were most of the founding fathers Freemasons, at least one,
Benjamin Franklin, was a Rosicrucian. The Rosicrucians were supposed to
have access to the teachings of Christian Rosenkreuz, who was born in 1378
and lived for over 100 years. He had supposedly learned esoteric disciplines
held by the ancient Egyptians, the Pythagorean philosophers of ancient
Greece and other occult wisdom. In reality, the earliest Rosicrucian writings
date from 1614. This secret fraternal order may actually have been founded
by the Swiss physician and alchemist Paracelsus (1493?-1541). While it
attracted many of the intelligentsia of the 18th century, the Rosicrucian
order never seems to have developed as an organization of significant political
influence to match the Freemasons. It was a common belief in the 18th-century
that ancient civilizations had held secret knowledge lost to people of
their day. To some degree this was true in that, for example, the technology
to make large panes of clear glass, lost since the fall of the Roman Empire,
was not rediscovered until the 1600s. The supposed esoteric knowledge of
the Egyptians, however, was more the stuff of which the legends of Atlantis
were made. Fraternal orders used supposed access to ancient hidden knowledge
as a means of self-validation. The Masons claimed descent from the masons
sent by Hiram of Tyre to build Solomon's Temple. Naturally, these Phoenician
masons brought with them secrets of the ancient Egyptians. Thus, fraternal
orders developed a quasi-pagan mythology as part of their ritual. Fundamentalists
in general and conspiracy theorists in particular have seized on this,
anathematized the Masons and Rosicrucians, and see in their rituals a pagan
revival. </P>

<P>Another pagan revival or intrusion of occult influences is that popular
pastiche of westernized eastern religion, astrology, warmed over 19th-century
mysticism (theosophy and the like), revived paganism of dubious validity
and general feel-good spirituality called the New Age movement. Of course,
the phrase &quot;New Age&quot; is too close to &quot;New World Order&quot;
to not provoke fundamentalist paranoia. </P>

<P>Both the pseudo-pagan rites of the Freemasons and the New Age movement
excite millenarian fears as being the religion of the false prophet in
Rev. 13:11-15. The facts that the New Age movement is patently silly, that
the Rosicrucians have been reduced to soliciting new members through ads
in pulp magazines, and that the mumbo-jumbo of </P>

<P>Masonic ritual is nothing more than the usual hokum of fraternal societies
have not blunted those fears in the least. And, since conspiracy theorists
point out the great overlap in the ranks of professional politicians of
Masons and members of the CFR, fears of the Illuminati are revived. </P>

<P>As an example of how absurd such fears of a pervasive sub rosa paganism
are, I can offer my experiences with Masonic organizations, indirect though
they were. Out of filial duty I attended a number of officer installations
as my parents moved up the ranks as members of the Garden Grove chapter
of the Order of the Eastern Star, a Masonic organization for women and
married couples. Having met the other members of the lodge and heard their
political and social views, I can safely say that, as staunch Nixon supporters
in the Vietnam War years, these people were not Illuminist, neo-pagan revolutionaries.
It is common at these installations for the newly installed officers to
introduce the friends and family members who have turned out to support
them. Many of these are from other Masonic women's or couples' organizations,
such as Daughters of the Nile or the Amaranth. Like the officers they had
turned out to support, these women were quintessentially Orange County
Republican. Thus, when one of the matrons introduced one of her friends
as &quot;the High Priestess of my White Shrine,&quot; momentary visions
of these ladies indulging in pagan rites and child sacrifice dissolved
in the face of their obvious middle-class conservatism. </P>

<P>What stretches credulity even further is the supposed link between New
Agers and secular humanists, particularly since the latter generally hold
the former in absolute contempt. The prime mechanism of indoctrination
into this pagan/humanist world system is seen by millenarians and conspiracy
theorists as being the public school system. The main tactics are seen
as dumbing down students to make them manageable and desensitizing them
to such horrors as infanticide. The system's chief architect is generally
considered to be the late John Dewey, whom they hold responsible for modern
failures in education. The problem with this view is that Dewey's model
of permissive education hit its peak in the 40s and was dealt a death blow
by the pressure to emphasize math and science at the expense of the humanities
following the launch of the first Sputnik satellite in 1957. That the emphasis
in science has not produced better educated students since then is a product
of family breakdown, oversized classes, the encumbering of teachers with
all sorts of baggage based on social agendas, the pervasive influence of
television, and a host of other societal problems, none of which are demonstrably
related to clandestine conspiracies. </P>

<P>As an example of fundamentalist fears that children are being desensitized
to such horrors as infanticide, consider a brief article by fundamentalist
author Berit Kjos (pronounced Chos) that appeared in a magazine called
<I>Media Bypass</I>. Kjos told of a mother who was trying to restrict the
use of a novel called <I>The Giver</I> in the classroom because it contained
a scene in which a low birth-weight baby is efficiently done away with.
The mother felt that it desensitized children to infanticide. Kjos (1995)
says of the book: </P>

<UL>
<P><TT>Laura's mother knew that <I>The Giver</I> fit into the flood of
classroom literature that force children to think the unthinkable and reconsider
the values they learned at home. It also models many of the pitfalls and
supposed perfections of the utopian school-centered community documented
in Goals 2000 and other blueprints for change prepared by the educational
establishment. </TT></P>
</UL>

<P>And now for a dose of reality. I was so intrigued by Kjos's article
that I went to the library and read <I>The Giver</I>, which was the winner
of the 1994 Newbury Award. The novel is about a futuristic society which
is seemingly utopian. As the story unfolds it becomes more and more evident
that the society is quite sinister. Old people, incorrigibles and problem
babies are &quot;released.&quot; Up to the point of the climactic scene
which Laura's mother thought would desensitize kids to infanticide, &quot;release&quot;
has by implication been a mystical letting go. When the hero actually views
the &quot;release&quot; of a low birth-weight baby it turns out to be a
horrific scene in which the baby is killed by lethal injection and disposed
of down a garbage chute. Desensitizing? Hardly! The scene is traumatic.
If anything it is likely to turn the kids into right-to-lifers. </P>

<P>Laura and her classmates were required to make their own decisions as
to whether the society portrayed in <I>The Giver</I> was right or wrong,
though how they could think it right is a bit hard to figure. Fundamentalists
object to such exercises. This is curious since they are the first to complain
about &quot;dumbing down&quot; in the school system. One would think that
exercises that make kids examine why they believe what they believe would
be the opposite of dumbing down. Yet, when it comes right down to it fundamentalists
want their children taught by rote. This is fine as far as it goes. Multiplication
tables, rules of grammar and proper spelling can and should be laid out
in black and white terms. But children also need to exercise their minds.
And here is the rub. People can only be taught to think for themselves
by questioning the validity of ideas. People who question invariably start
questioning the Bible or at least how their parents and other authorities
interpret it. Since children who question things may end up questioning
their parents' premillennial beliefs, fundamentalists, when it comes right
down to it, really do not want their kids to think. </P>

<CENTER><P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Importance of Conspiracy Theories </FONT></P></CENTER>

<P>As part of the crisis that provokes the creation of a world government,
Gary Kah sees the possibility of a Syrian attack on Israel, with a possible
nuclear exchange as part of the hostilities. He cites the failed, or as
he puts it, as yet unfulfilled prophecy of the destruction of Damascus
in Is. 17:1 (that Damascus would be destroyed and never rebuilt) as possibly
being fulfilled in this exchange, thereby validating both the prophecy
and his scenario. That prophecies that clearly were not fulfilled are assumed
to be awaiting fulfillment-some day-highlights the impossibility of falsification
built into the fundamentalist scenario. There is in essence a basic dishonesty
that pervades both millenarian prophecies and conspiracy theories. There
may also be, among those who accuse the rest of us of being dupes or agents
of a conspiracy, some hidden agenda of their own. Whether it is from sloppy
research or sympathetic politics, Gary Kah has quoted extensively from
so-called historian Nesta Webster to back up his assertion that the Illuminati/Freemasons
are responsible for Marxism and everything else of evil in the world. Michael
Howard says of Nesta Webster (1989, pp. 161-162): </P>

<UL>
<P><TT>Typical of these politically motivated conspiracy theorists was
Nesta Webster who wrote a series of best-selling books in the 1920s exposing
the so-called Jewish world domination plan. She claimed that the Jews,
working through secret societies and the international banking system,
were the <I>eminences grises</I> behind the revolutionary movements of
the eighteenth and nineteenth centuriesWebster believed she was the reincarnation
of a countess who had been executed in the French Revolution and was convinced
it was her duty in this lifetime to expose the secret societies who had
plotted the 1789 uprisingWebster revealed her true political colours in
1923. Her books had reviled Marxism as the modern cover for the &quot;Jewish
menace&quot; and in that year she went a step further by joining the British
Fascist Party. </TT></P>
</UL>

<P>That dishonesty which makes prophecy unfalsifiable and fails either
by insufficient research or design to report the fascist anti-Semitism
behind a cited author may not be entirely limited to that of an intellectual
nature. It might well be cynically, cold-bloodedly monetary as well. While
I cannot read the minds of those fostering millenarian fears and thus cannot
absolutely prove a deliberate attempt to deceive on their part, there are
ample motives that might lead them to fan millennial paranoia. </P>

<P>Consider Hal Lindsey. According to the back cover of his book, <I>Planet
Earth-2000 A.D.</I>, he has authored 11 books. All of these are on the
end-time and all are best-sellers in the Christian market. Their combined
world-wide sales exceeds $35 million. In addition to this Lindsey has speaking
tours, talk show appearances, etc. While I have no idea what portion of
the sales go to him or how much of this money he devotes to charities,
it is a sure bet that his celebrity status makes for a more attractive
life than merely pastoring a local church would. </P>

<P>Then there is Don McAlvany, editor of <I>The McAlvany Intelligence Advisor</I>,
another conspiracy theorist who mixes stories of implanted biochips as
the Mark of the Beast with ominous predictions of impending economic collapse.
He advises his readers to buy gold and silver as a hedge against the coming
disaster. Interestingly enough, McAlvany is a dealer in silver and gold.
Could it be that that his financial interests are to some small degree
shading his prophecies? </P>

<P>While such end-times speculations as seeing the Mark of the Beast in
the bar code, Visa cards, and implanted computer chips, or fears that Hong
Kong Gurkhas will be imported into the U.S. for crowd control may seem
harmless and rather silly, the avid adherence to the belief that these
are the last days has serious consequences in that it motivates the way
a sizable bloc of American voters views both domestic and foreign policy.
In his book <I>The Mind of the Bible-Believer</I>, Edmund D. Cohen points
out that it was extremely fortunate that the Soviet Union was run by atheists.
Since they did not view the world as being fulfilled in an apocalyptic
vision and did not believe that they had immortal souls that would survive
a nuclear armageddon, they had a built-in reason to avoid an atomic war.
Hal Lindsey has many times boasted that his lectures at places such as
the Air Force Academy are always heavily attended and well received. Perhaps
we should thank God that the Cold War ended before one of Lindsey's enthusiastic
listeners pushed the nuclear envelope too far. </P>

<P>Even with the end of the Cold War, there are consequences that voters
holding the premillennial mind-set may plunge us into. Consider that their
belief in the end-times has not been in the least bit shaken by the end
of the Cold War and consider that the sweeping Republican electoral victories
of 1994 were accomplished by a shift of only 2% of the voters coupled with
a low voter turn-out. Since one of the voter blocs influencing that swing
to the right consists of fundamentalist Christians looking forward to Armageddon,
defense spending will likely not be based on rational considerations alone.
Further, an aggressive, even bullying foreign policy could emerge, particularly
in terms of our dealings with the Islamic nations and Russia. </P>

<P>While the influence of premillennialists may well prove a windfall for
defense contractors, it could easily have a disastrous effect on how the
government deals with internal issues. Consider the example of the infamous
James Watt. As Secretary of the Interior, it was his job to enforce environmental
regulations. As a premillennialist, however, it was his belief that there
was no point in defending the environment since the world was going to
end soon and the whole thing would be destroyed anyway. There is no end
to the number of problems this rationalization could be applied to. Why
worry about the problems of homelessness or drug addiction? The world is
going to end soon. Why bother using our taxes to fund vaccinating school
children? The world is going to end soon. Why bother reforming injustices?
The Lord is coming back to institute a perfect society in a few years at
most. Particularly when the financial benefits of more defense spending
and less emphasis on environmental and social programs fit so nicely with
the eschatology of the premillennialist voters, we will see how destructive
are the fantasies woven by Hal Lindsey and others of his ilk.

<P>A mountain peak, and its darker silhouette displaced by 'one standard
deviation,' is the image from <I>The Bell Curve</I> that persists in memory.
It's the purported shape of the distribution of IQ scores classified by
race, derived from the scores of 11,878 people taking the Armed Forces
Qualification Test (AFQT), and it appears in <I>TBC</I>'s notorious &quot;Ethnic
Differences in Cognitive Ability&quot; chapter. (It also appeared in the
<I>New Republic</I>'s cover story on the book, as well as in the pages
of <I>Skeptic</I>,) One could easily imagine the shapes rising into view
as Microsoft Excel or SAS scattered the points on the computer screen,
like a lost Aztec city shining through a false color enhancement of satellite
data. The symmetry of the slopes, of course, spoke for a natural evenness
of distribution- the classic &quot;bell curve&quot; one sees for height,
life expectancy, shooting craps, and other natural processes. The conclusion:
an underlying pattern has been revealed through the ruthless application
of statistics. </P>

<P>On page 32 of <I>Inequality by Design</I>, the authors provide a re-casting
of the same magic runes. As before, the whites-only Matterhorn of Herrnstein
and Murray is present. But beside it is a grey lump, slouching towards
the high ends of the scale in defiance of the demanded symmetry. This insubordinate
lump is the <I>original </I>distribution of scores on the AFQT. </P>

<P>Looking further in <I>The Bell Curve</I> for an explanation, one finds
that answers are somewhat elusive. Herrnstein and Murray could have used
centile scores-placing people in the 99th percentile of scores, the 98th
percentile, etc. This would have been a lot simpler. In Appendix 2, they
state they &quot;we knew from collateral data&quot; that the important
IQ stuff &quot;occurs at the tails of the distribution,&quot; and &quot;using
centiles throws away the tails.&quot; In short: the original scores are
not a bell curve; but IQ scores must follow a bell curve; all the action
in our project happens at the tail ends of a bell curve; therefore, we
must derive a bell curve with distinct tails from the unruly data. If you're
one of those people who feel that data should shape the theory, this may
seem somewhat less than valid. Toss in the fact that intelligence tests
are frequently <I>designed </I>to provide bell-curve distributions of scores,
and we notice a kind of circular reasoning implicit in the psychometric
model used by Herrnstein and Murray. Reshaping the lump into the mountain
was, in the words of <I>Inequality by Design</I>, the result of &quot;a
good deal of statistical mashing and stretching,&quot; demanded by the
assumption &quot;that intelligence must be distributed in a bell curve.&quot;
</P>

<IMG SRC = "04.3.siano-chart.gif" ALT = "Bell Curve Chart" ALIGN = LEFT>

<P>The authors take Herrnstein and Murray to task for presenting the AFQT
as an intelligence test. This isn't the case: the AFQT was designed to
predict performance in the armed forces (no wisecracks, class), and it
functions best as a test of the level of schooling the subject has received.
The math sections, which make the greatest differences in the final scores,
require having had exposure to high school algebra. The National Longitudinal
Survey of Youth, which administered the AFQT to its thousands of subjects,
measured schooling at a very crude level (number of years and whether the
subject was in an academic track), but these two factors correlated well
with AFQT scores. Other studies, using the same data, argue that Herrnstein
and Murray drastically underestimated the influence of schooling. </P>

<P>(In one passage, the authors argue that if we keep education level constant,
age correlates <I>negatively </I>with AFQT score. In other words, older
respondents with 12 years of education score lower than younger respondent
with the same level. If AFQT measures education level, then this difference
is explained by the fact that the older respondents had been out of school
longer, and had forgotten some of their education. But if we accept the
psychometric claim that the test measures innate ability, then we'd have
to believe that people start getting stupider around their midteens.) </P>

<P>What can we say about Herrnstein and Murray's &quot;cognitive elite,&quot;
that upper 5%? They were people who had had schooling beyond the high school
level, disproportionately male (thanks to the weighting in favor of math),
and just <I>plain lucky</I>; one or two more wrong answers, and they would've
dropped down into the &quot;bright&quot; category. As for the other end
of the curve, 27 % had dropped out of school at least three years before
taking the test. </P>

<P>The core of Herrnstein and Murray's argument is that IQ is a better
predictor of life outcomes than the usual measure of socioeconomic status
(SES). Contrary to the forbidden-data claims of <I>The Bell Curve</I>,
sociologists have been working with intelligence tests and the AFQT for
years. The authors of <I>Inequality by Design</I> &quot;accepted Herrnstein
and Murray's evidence, their measure of intelligence, and their basic methodology
and then reexamined the results. By simply correcting a handful of errors,
we showed that coming from a disadvantaged home was almost as important
a risk factor for poverty as a low AFQT score.&quot; </P>

<P>Herrnstein and Murray defined SES very narrowly, as four factors: level
of education, income, and parents' occupation(s). They then needlessly
compiled these into a single index-thus giving them equal weight amongst
each other. This is a major error, since NLSY data shows that parental
income has a far greater effect than parental education on a child's life
outcome. </P>

<P>Also, when such information was missing from the NLSY respondents, they
simply assigned them the average value derived from other respondents.
(This introduces error, in the case of respondents who are rich or poor,
and reduces the statistical association with effect variables.) The NLSY
only included four questions about parental SES, which makes it far less
reliable than the 105-question AFQT-which stacks the IQ-vs-SES face-off
in Herrnstein and Murray's favor. </P>

<P>Herrnstein and Murray also left out several factors known to have effects
on a subject's life outcome. The number of siblings, for example, was not
incorporated into their analysis. The adult community environment-local
unemployment rate, geographic region (rural, urban, suburban)-was also
overlooked. Was the subject, at age 14, living in a two-parent household?
What about access to quality schools? Bringing these factors into play
provides a probability-of-poverty graph that <I>matches </I>Herrnstein
and Murray's AFQT curves. In short, the authors conclude that the subjects'
&quot;life chances depend on their social surroundings at least as much
as their own intelligence... The key finding of <I>The Bell Curve</I> turns
out to be an artifact of its method.&quot; </P>

<P><I>Inequality by Design</I> goes on to present a far more detailed analysis
of poverty. For example, despite rough parity in IQ scores, women are far
more likelier than men to be poor. Using the NLSY-AFQT data, the authors
state that &quot;a young woman would have had to score <I>forty-one points
higher</I> on the AFQT than a young man of the same age, formal schooling,
and background in order for her risk of being poor to have been as low
as his.&quot; [Italics in original.] Having children increases the risk
of being poor. The economic effects of marriage and divorce are more dramatic
for adults who grew up in low-income families. Herrnstein and Murray say
nothing substantial about gender; instead, they argue that unmarried status
is a <I>result </I>of lower intelligence. But the AFQT scores of unmarried
respondents were no higher than those of marrieds.... </P>

<P>Again, data seems to have lost primacy over theory through much of <I>The
Bell Curve</I>. In one spectacular example, Herrnstein and Murray claim
that a three-point drop in average American IQ would increase unwed motherhood
and incarceration rates by about 10 % (pp. 364-368). But to explain the
doubling of incarcerated men in the 1980s, the 150% increase in unwed motherhood
since 1970, and the rises and dips of poverty between 1960 to 1992, we'd
have to believe that average IQ varies as much as <I>55 points</I> within
a single generation-a claim Herrnstein and Murray explicitly rule out.
</P>

<P>At this stage, discussion of <I>The Bell Curve's</I> notorious race-and-IQ
chapter is almost a done deal. <I>Inequality by Design</I> echoes Berkeley
sociologist John Ogbu's work on the matters of caste systems in societies.
Yes, American blacks score one standard deviation below whites on IQ tests.
This is more a <I>result </I>of low ethnic or caste status than it is of
any biological factor. Polish Jews emigrating to America tested poorly
on IQ tests, and Koreans living in Japan have patterns of poverty, crime
and school performance similar to those of blacks in America. Low caste
status contributes to three factors-socioeconomic deprivation, group segregation,
and the stigma of inferiority. Castes assimilated through conquest or capture
(Irish in Britain, Maori in New Zealand, Koreans in Japan, blacks in the
U.S.) have a harder time assimilating than minorities who immigrated willingly.
And when we consider the arbitrary distinctions that mark the Indian &quot;untouchables&quot;
and Japanese <I>burakumin </I>as low-caste, we are forced into realizing
that race matters only as much as people <I>want </I>it to matter. </P>

<P>When <I>The Bell Curve</I> was published in 1994, few reviewers were
equipped to re-evaluate the data in time for publication deadlines. Some
admitted ignorance of statistics, while others rested on denunciations
of the book's logical fallacies, implied policy demands, the precedent
of the previous century's race-science, and the book's reliance on white
supremacist-funded research sources. The more thoughtful reviews went over
the classic criticisms: the misuse of the concept of heritability and debates
over the validity of IQ tests and Spearman's g. A more detailed analysis
of the data would face the prospect that <I>The Bell Curve's</I> impact
wouldn't last very long, and a rebuttal book published a year or so down
the road would be irrelevant. </P>

<P>So we can be thankful that <I>Inequality by Design's</I> detailed and
scrupulous re-analysis of Herrnstein and Murray's g-over-all theories has
been published. (Welcome to peer review, guys.) But the authors go on to
present a good discussion of how economic and social factors shape inequality
in the United States. We don't succeed or fail because of our individual
IQ or talents alone: nearly all of us are beneficiaries of a vast system
of social support, ranging from tax breaks for homeowners, the national
highway system, and grammar school immunizations, to the WIC and food stamp
programs. True, there are people who do stand on their own two feet, free
from reliance on society. Problem is, they also sleep on steam vents. </P>

<h1>OBSERVATIONS ON GENIUS</h1>
</a>
<h2><a href="02.1.about-allen.html">By Steve Allen</a></h2>

The answer to the riddle of genius remains elusive. When it is at last 
discovered it may prove to be closely related to another of psychology's 
deepest mysteries, that of the idiot savants, those peculiar individuals 
who are mentally handicapped, with the exception of one aspect of 
creative behavior, at which they are superior. What both genius and the 
puzzling abilities of the idiot savants have in common is that such 
praiseworthy factors as hard work, practice and determination would 
appear to have nothing whatever to do with the matter.
<p>Nor--and this is fascinating--does the unadorned factor of high 
intelligence account for genius. We all know people who are extremely 
intelligent and yet do not in any way distinguish themselves.</p>
<p>The puzzle is further complicated by the fact that intelligence 
itself is not one factor but may be manifested in a variety of forms. In 
my own case the manipulation of words, ideas and their
inter-relationships comes easily; unfortunately I cannot say the same for 
mathematical symbols. As for the broad field of science itself, what may 
be called the philosophy of it intrigues me, but I have no gifts for the 
nuts-and-bolts aspects of such disciplines.</p>
<p>I am confident enough about one relevant insight to predict that 
when the mystery is finally resolved its location will be either solely 
or mostly in genetics. Thomas Edison is reported to have said that 
genius was one percent inspiration and ninety-nine percent perspiration. 
While that may have been true in his case, I doubt if it has universal 
application since I have the impression that for many true geniuses, 
their work comes easily.</p>
<p>This is at least consistent with the assumption of a genetic base 
for dramatically superior ability. If that hypothesis becomes 
established, it will have cleared up a bit of mystery but created a 
great deal more. With genius it seems we have truly entered a scientific 
Twilight Zone if it is indeed the case that some almost invisible blob 
of physical matter is literally responsible for Einstein's ability to 
conceive of the theory of relativity, for the paintings of Leonardo, the 
symphonies of Beethoven, the plays of Shakespeare, or dazzling 
proficiency in any of the arts.</p>
<p>It has long been self-evident that there is a physical basis for 
bodily features and characteristics. Whether one had brown or blue eyes, 
one skin color or another, long legs, large bones or a particular color 
of hair--all of this was recognized as traceable to physical factors, 
which we now know are genes. But in recent decades, remarkable 
discoveries have demonstrated that what might be called character 
traits, too, have a genetic basis. Within the last year a gene for the 
personality trait known as shyness has been discovered.</p>
<p>In contemplating the lives of those rare individuals who are so 
morally superior that they are considered saints, it has occurred to me 
that they might be better referred to as geniuses of virtue and that, 
moreover, the explanation for their moral good fortune might also lie in 
the accident of genetics.</p>
<p>Whatever the relevant realities, we may safely consider them 
astonishing. If any or much of this becomes established, interesting 
philosophical questions immediately follow. There is something rather 
sweet about being Jeffersonian and believing that on some level all 
human creatures are born equal. But it is clear, even to children, that 
not all of us are born equal physically. Since Americans particularly 
are not comfortable with the concept of class, we experience some 
discomfort in considering the possibility, or fact, that there are 
superior and inferior individuals.</p>
<p>When the inferiority is dramatic and undeniable, we respond 
charitably and generally treat the handicapped, of whatever sort, with 
at least a minimum degree of compassion, although it often requires the 
early work of solitary thinkers and doers to encourage us to such 
generosity of spirit.</p>
<p>The genius is, by definition, superior to the rest of us. We would 
like to think that by adjusting the environmental circumstances of all 
but the physically handicapped we could perhaps create geniuses by the 
proper sort of education. I believe this cannot happen, although God 
knows the formal process of education leaves a great deal to be desired.</p>
<p>Although it is reasonable to assume that there have always been 
individuals of genius, it was not until the 17th century that the word 
assumed its modern meaning. We can see in the first syllable of the word 
a clue to its original Roman meaning, which survives in such words as 
gene, genetics and genealogy.  The fact that to the present day the term 
is still not susceptible to precise definition of the scientific sort is 
only one aspect of the ageless mystery of creativity itself. After 
centuries of attention by philosophers, theologians, psychologists and 
brain specialists, we still cannot explain why certain individuals can 
produce poems, plays, novels, stories, jokes, paintings, sculpture, 
music, or scientific theories when the great majority of the human race 
cannot. That even the still-revered philosophers of ancient times were 
at a loss in this regard becomes clear when we consider the two 
classical explanations for remarkable talent.</p>
<p>One attributes such work to beings called muses, but that is 
nonsense since there are no such things. They are a purely hypothetical 
conception. The other explanation, equally groundless, is that all 
creative works have God as their true father. Simply stepping over the 
ancient debate concerning the existence of God, and assuming, in fact, 
that there is a creator of the universe, it hardly seems fair to 
attribute to him all the poetry, music and literature in the world for 
the simple reason that most of it is dreadfully inferior. There is also, 
of course, the difficulty as to why God would trouble himself to add a 
helpful line or two to one of his creature's poems while not exerting 
himself to save the lives of the millions who daily suffer in the most 
hideously painful and unjust ways--children dying in orphanage fires, 
nuns struck down by cancer, and other instances too depressing to long 
consider.</p>
<p>So we are back where we started and little the wiser for our search.</p>
<p>My own theory as regards the long-held beliefs about the origin of 
genius is that a combination of envy and the contempt said to result 
from long familiarity engendered the idea that the gifted individual 
himself could not possibly be responsible for his abilities. And indeed 
such puzzlement is understandable since it is perfectly possible for a 
person to be (a) a genius and (b) something of a disappointment in other 
regards. Some geniuses have appeared less than bright during their early 
years--Aquinas, Newton and Einstein being classic examples. Others have 
left a great deal to be desired morally. And Havelock Ellis, in Study of 
British Genius, observed that muscular incoordination, physical 
awkwardness and difficulties with speech were characteristic of both 
idiots and geniuses.</p>

<a name="maccready">
<h1>POTENTIAL AND ACHIEVEMENT CATEGORIZATION OF GENIUS</h1>
</a>
<h2><a href="02.1.about-maccready.html">By Paul B. MacCready</a></h2>

"Genius" is one of those broad, imprecise words that is widely used but 
never exactly defined (like "common cold"). A generally accepted 
definition is "extraordinary intellectual power" where extraordinary 
just means much more than possessed by the person doing the labeling 
unless the labeler is the genius him/herself.
<p>If intellectual power is normally distributed, perhaps we can be 
justified in setting the criterion for genius at three standard 
deviations above average. This corresponds to the top 0.13%, so rare 
that you may not know one. However, it is humbling to realize that in 
this world of 5.4 billion people, there must be 7,020,000 of them out 
there some place, and since the earth's population is increasing at 
about 250,000 a day, another 325 are added daily to this horde of 
geniuses. Another humbling fact is that intellectual powers in the 
population are not distributed exactly normally; the distribution curve 
is skewed in such a way that more people are below average than above.</p>
<p>The above clarification has introduced one way of categorizing 
genius. There are many others, all of which could be argued endlessly 
for or against. Here are four others worthy of consideration:</p>
<ol>
<li>"Everyone Agrees" Category (posthumous award).
<p>Such a list must include Leonardo, Shakespeare, Newton, Einstein, 
Darwin, Mozart, etc.</p><br></li>
<li>"Officially Designated" Category (which includes many still 
living).
<p>This list incorporates all Nobel Prize winners, and recipients of the 
so-called "Genius Awards" by the MacArthur Foundation (many of whom were 
selected for genius potential rather than genius proven). All these 
awardees, and those receiving recognition for other comparable prizes, 
have the added feature that big money accompanies the award. Money and 
television publicity certainly make these awards generally accepted in 
our modern culture as defining genius. As a cautioning note I must 
mention that, for one of these individuals, the genius skills did not 
apply to all aspects outside his/her specialty, and so my wife had to be 
called on various times to program his/her VCR. He/she will remain 
nameless here.</p><br></li>
<li>"High Achiever" Category.
<p>If you pick 100 very high achievers who have recently become nationally 
or even internationally renown--for top level acting or writing or art 
or athletic performance, for creating a giant business empire, for 
outstanding political leadership, for a dramatic, dangerous trip, for 
scientific achievement, etc.--you will be surprised to find how poorly 
many of them did in school. Achievement is not hurt by intellectual 
gifts, but more important for most spectacular achievement are 
dedication, enthusiasm, selecting the right challenges, timing, and good 
luck. And the achievement must be recognized by others as unique and 
important. I.Q. may suggest how well you will fare in school, but it is 
a poor predictor of how you will fare in life. Some very high I.Q. 
people are great at winning the debate but not at solving the problem. 
Some are tripped up by overconfidence, or inhibited from being 
venturesome for fear of being wrong.</p>
<p>Thus, a genius can be considered someone who actually creates the 
unusual or spectacular result. If the great potential chemist happened 
to be born and live in a remote, impoverished Third World village, there 
would be no opportunity to perform the great creative acts.</p><br></li>
<li>"Six Year Old Youngster" Category.
<p>Every six-year-old in the U.S. speaks a complicated language fluently, 
handling subtle terms and exceptions. If bilingual, the child does this 
for two languages, with perfect accent. The child also is a bit of a 
scientist, learning by experimenting with bike, swing, or sand box. And 
the youngster can skillfully manipulate two adults. The child is 
obviously a genius--until, in many cases, school, parents, or the 
neighborhood grinds out the spark.</p></li>
</ol>
In summary, genius is as genius does. There must be a well-recognized
output. Extraordinary intellectual power is sometimes needed, 
but by itself is rarely enough. The number of geniuses depends strongly 
on how one defines the term. By any definition, the number is growing--and
will continue to until computers take over and render genius 
obsolete, or will they?

<a name="intro"></a>
The history of technological innovation is the history of the tortuous 
paths which advances often take to acceptance. It might seem at first, 
from the many well-known instances of simultaneous discoveries, that it 
is the nature of important ideas to spring up newly everywhere, 
independently, as soon as the world is ripe for them. But this is only 
the view at first glance. In actuality, the "synchronicity" of discovery 
usually turns out to be a late phenomenon, one that follows a 
<a href="01.2.harris-prodrome.html">prodrome</a>
in which the "new" idea in question has long been around in some form or 
another, but steadfastly has been ignored.
<p>How long can an important idea be ignored? The model steam engine was 
demonstrated by Hero of Alexandria in the first century A.D., sixteen 
centuries before people started thinking along these lines again. Gregor 
Mendel published the basic principles of genetics in 1866, and was 
ignored until 1900. Oswald Avery published strong evidence that DNA was 
the principle of heredity in 1944, but no one really believed it until 
the time of Watson and Crick almost a decade later. The time varies, 
depending on circumstance.</p>
<p>Delayed acceptance of discovery happens in all areas of science, of 
course, but it always happens in the field of medicine with great 
poignancy, since there the human costs of dropping the technological 
ball are usually great. We may consider, for instance, the numbers of 
lives which might have been saved if not for the following delays:</p>
<ul>
<li>Leeuwenhoek invented the microscope in 1668 and saw animal cells 
and protozoa with it--but unfortunately for humanity, doctors weren't 
interested in that kind of thing in 1668, and wouldn't be for another 
couple of centuries. In the meantime they missed out on the germ theory 
of infectious disease; thus, as late as 1850, when good Doctor 
Semmelweiss tried to get his Hungarian colleagues to curb the incidence 
of fatal "childbed fever" by washing their hands between dissecting 
diseased cadavers and examining patients, his colleagues responded by 
hounding him out of his job. Meanwhile diseases continued to spread on 
the hands of well-meaning doctors.</li>
<li>Several explorers like Sir Richard Hawkins independently discovered 
the antiscorbutic properties of oranges and limes in the 18th century, 
and James Lind in 1754 even published the results of a controlled 
experiment in which he showed that citrus was superior to other folk 
methods for the curing of scurvy. The world, however, was not ready for 
the discovery, and sailors continued to suffer and die from this quite 
treatable nutritional disease for more than half a century after Lind's 
demonstration. Scurvy was also rampant among the troops of both North 
and South during the American Civil War, though the means was available 
to prevent it, and as late as 1912 the famous explorer Robert Falcon 
Scott died on his way back from the South Pole, probably as the result 
of scurvy.</li>
<li>An investigator before the First World War discovered the curative 
powers of <em>penicillium</em> mold extracts on infected animals, but could not 
interest his colleagues, although he published the work. It remained for 
Alexander Fleming, ignorant of the earlier work, to rediscover the 
antibacterial effect of <em>penicillium</em> in a laboratory accident in 1928.
</li>
<li>Alexis Carrel, the French-American scientist who won the Nobel 
Prize in 1902 for techniques of suturing blood vessels, demonstrated in 
1910 that a saphenous vein graft between aorta and main coronary artery 
in animals could bypass a blockage there, and speculated that the 
technique might be useful in the treatment of angina. Although Carrel 
(with aviator Charles Lindbergh) later went on to develop the heart-lung 
machines that would make such surgery possible, the medical community 
contented itself for the next half-century with ineffective treatments 
for severe coronary heart disease, and it was not until 1967 that the 
saphenous-graft coronary bypass operation was employed on humans.</li>
</ul>
To the historian, some medical fields seem more plagued with delays 
in the acceptance of new ideas than others (the medical study of 
infectious disease has been prominent in this dubious regard, as noted), 
and the above examples are sad enough. Still, there is possibly one 
field of medicine which is at least the equal of infectious disease in 
its record of ignoring proven lifesaving strategies for the longest 
time, and that is the area to which we will turn for the remainder of 
this essay. The medical field in question is that of resuscitation, 
which is the art of restoring clinically dead people to life. It will be 
of no surprise that many of the issues related to it which have been 
debated in history are also familiar to cryonicists. For example: when 
exactly is a person "dead," and how do you tell?
<p>Cryonicists looking into the history of resuscitation may find 
themselves reading with a sense of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu. We've seen these 
controversies already, and we'll see them again. Perhaps we can profit 
by exploring them further.</p>

<a name="resus">
<h2>Resuscitation</h2>
</a>

Historically, the art of resuscitation turns out to be old. The idea of 
resuscitating a seemingly dead person by more or less physical means 
occurs in the Hebrew scriptures. Both I Kings 17 and II Kings  4 contain 
descriptive elements of resuscitation by chest compression. In II Kings, 
Elisha also places his mouth on the child's mouth. Clearly there is 
something more than mystical prayers and incantations going on. Perhaps 
the oral traditions which were later codified into these tales once 
contained descriptions of one or more real resuscitative events.
<p>By a few millennia later, things were better defined. Italian 
writings of the 15th century indicated that midwives had, even then, 
long been using mouth-to-mouth breathing techniques to resuscitate 
newborns who did not spontaneously breathe. These techniques were soon 
to be imitated in the mechanical experiments of the Enlightenment. 
Paracelsus (1493-1541), an alchemist and perhaps the greatest physician 
of his age, was said to have attempted the resuscitation of a corpse 
using bellows, a trick he perhaps picked up from Arabic medical 
writings. And Andreas Vesalius (1514-1564), the father of modern 
anatomy, reported successfully using bellows to resuscitate asphyxiated 
dogs.</p>
<p>Bellows may not always have been available, but physicians eventually 
learned (possibly again from laymen) that simple mouth-to-mouth 
resuscitation sometimes worked on recently asphyxiated adults just as it 
did on newborns. By the 1740s, several cases of successful mouth-to-mouth
resuscitation had been reported, the most famous of which was 
Tossach's 1744 report of the resuscitation of a clinically dead coal 
miner who had been suddenly overcome after descending into a burned-out 
mine. By the 1760s, in the wake of such reports, a number of groups 
advocating the resuscitation of drowned persons had sprung up in Europe. 
The thinking at this time in many places was strikingly modern. Here, by 
way of example, is a quote from a 1766 governmental edict from Zurich:</p>
<blockquote>. . . Experience has shown that the drowned who are considered
dead and that lay for some time under water have often been restored again and 
kept alive by proper maneuvers. From which one rightly concludes that 
life has not been completely suspended in the drowned, but that there is 
hope to save them from death if, as soon as they are withdrawn from the 
water, prompt and careful help is administered.</blockquote>
The Swiss may have been their usual regulation-happy selves about the 
subject, but in the rest of the Western world resuscitation was being 
pushed typically by entirely private societies (voluntary clubs). In 
1774, a society was founded in London to promulgate the idea of 
attempting to resuscitate the dead in some circumstances. Called, after 
a bit of experimentation, the <em>Society for the Recovery of Persons 
Apparently Drowned</em>, it quickly evolved into the <em>Humane Society</em> (and 
still later, with official patronage and funding, the <em>Royal Humane 
Society</em>).
<p>The <em>Humane Society</em> advocated techniques which were highly advanced. 
Three months after the society's founding, as an example, a society 
member had the opportunity to minister to a 3-year-old child named 
Catherine Sophie Greenhill, who had fallen from an upper story window 
onto flagstones, and been pronounced dead. The society member, an 
apothecary named Squires, was on the scene within twenty minutes, and 
history records that he proceeded to give the clinically dead child 
several shocks through the chest with a portable electrostatic 
generator. This treatment caused her to regain pulse and respiration, 
and she eventually (after a time in coma) recovered fully.</p>
<p>[This story and other direct quotations, unless otherwise noted, are 
taken from <em>The History Of Anesthesia</em>, Richard S. Atkinson and Thomas 
V. Boulton, eds., International Congress and Symposium Series, #134, 
Parthenon Publishing Group, NJ,  (Parthenon).]</p>
<p>The resuscitation of little Catherine Greenhill was probably the first 
successful cardiac defibrillation of a human being, and it followed 
earlier suggestions by American scientist Benjamin Franklin and others 
that electricity might possibly be used to "revivify" the human body. 
And so it proved able to do in certain circumstances. In 1788, a silver 
medal was awarded to _Humane Society_ member Charles Kite, who was by 
this time not only advocating the resuscitation of victims in cardiac 
arrest with bellows and both oropharyngeal and nasolaryngeal intubation, 
but had also developed his own electrostatic revivifying machine which 
used Leyden jar capacitors in a way exactly analogous to the DC 
capacitative countershock of the modern cardiac defibrillator. (I must 
confess that to my mind all of these contraptions are as fantastic as 
the devices in a <em>Flintstones</em> cartoon, yet they actually existed. A 
time-traveling physician from the present could not have put together a 
better resuscitation kit, given the technology of the time.)</p>

<a name="dark">
<h2>Dark Clouds</h2>
</a>

However amazing its progress was, the enlightened state of the late 18th 
century as regards resuscitation was not to last. From the very first, 
dark images from the human psyche began to gather in resistance to the 
new ideas. Technology never intervenes in a major way into the 
borderland between life and death without creating major anxieties and 
social backlash. Resuscitation had its problems.
<p>To begin with, as the modern reader may guess, the 18th-century 
discovery that "death" was not a sure and objective state, did not 
exactly sit well in the public mind. Our historical friend Charles Kite 
was of the opinion that not even putrefaction was a sure sign of 
permanent death, since it might also be due to advanced scurvy(!). 
However conservative this view might have been for Kite and his medical 
agenda, the public had its own concerns. If one could be mistaken for 
dead when one was in fact resuscitatable, what else did that imply?</p>
<p>The answer, of course, is that it implied that you could be buried 
alive. Not long after the first word-of-mouth reports of adult 
resuscitations began surfacing in the 1730s, the French author Jacques 
Benigne Winslow published a book descriptively titled <em>The Uncertainty 
of the Signs of Death and the Danger of Precipitate Interments and 
Dissections</em>. Now the real problem with the difficulty of defining 
<em>death</em> in a technical age was out of the bag: <em>What if you got the 
diagnosis wrong?</em></p>
<p>The result of this realization was a psychological terror perhaps 
made familiar to the reader by some of the works of Edgar Allan Poe. But 
Poe, popularizing the problem for early 19th-century America, was late 
to the controversy. In 18th-century Europe the fear of premature burial 
and dissection was not just the preoccupation of macabre writers; whole 
classes of people were affected, albeit in different ways. Upper-class 
persons took to fitting coffins and crypts with special signaling 
devices which could be used to alert the outside world in case the 
occupant should inexplicably revive. The lower classes had their own 
special problems, too, since anatomical dissection (long a part of the 
punishment for heinous crimes because it denied the malefactor an intact 
bodily identity or a grave) had now taken on a special meaning. Here, as 
example, is what Ruth Richardson says of the dissection of criminals in 
her treatise <em>Death, Dissection, and the Destitute</em>, describing an 
incident in the 1820s in which one dissecting anatomist at Carlisle was 
killed, and another severely wounded, by the friends of an executed man:</p>
<blockquote>. . . Although this was of course an extreme reaction, it was 
certainly the case that hanging the corpse in chains on a gibbet was 
popularly regarded as preferable to dissection. What later incredulous 
commentators seem to have missed or misunderstood was that in eighteenth 
and early nineteenth century popular belief, not only were the 
anatomists agents of the law, but they could be the agents of death. 
Genuine cases were known of incomplete hangings, in which the 'dead' 
were brought back to life, and plans for celebrated corpse-rescues 
centered on the possibility that the noose had not fully done its work. 
Folktales circulated about famous criminals revived by friends, and 
these ideas were fostered by the publicity which Humane Society 
resuscitations attracted after apparent drownings. Increased control 
over the body of the condemned rendered rescue and revival virtually 
impossible.
<p>It was popularly understood that the surgeon's official function and 
interest in a murderer's corpse was not to revive, but rather to destroy 
it. Dissection was a very final process. It denied hope of survival - 
even the survival of identity after death[!]. Above all, it threw into 
relief the collaborative role of the medical profession in the actual 
execution of death. The Carlisle surgeons bore the brunt of the 
resentment and frustration felt by the dead man's friends, for in their 
eyes the doctors had murdered him more surely than the hangman's 
rope. (The denial of the body of the heinous criminal to the family has 
had a long history in law, and we see it historically employed in 
capital crimes which particularly outraged the public, even in 
relatively recent times. For instance, after execution in 1865 the 
bodies of the four Lincoln assassination conspirators were immediately 
buried in Army equipment boxes a few feet from the gallows in the prison 
yard in Washington's Old Penitentiary, the same institution where the 
body of John Wilkes Booth had been secretly buried a month earlier. In 
1901, after anarchist Leon Czolgosz was electrocuted for the 
assassination of President McKinley, his body was dissolved in acid in 
the prison basement. One cannot read such accounts without a deeper 
appreciation for the psychological power of the freshly dead body in an 
era when resuscitation was still somewhat magic. Even as late as 1946, 
after the ten members of the Nazi high command were hanged at Nuremburg, 
the Surgeon General of the United States himself was turned down when he 
asked that the brains be removed, preserved, and sent to Washington for 
study. Instead, the bodies were cremated immediately at Dachau and the 
ashes secretly scattered, with the specific intent that nothing remain. 
One may read into official penal policy in all these cases a more or 
less unconscious desire to destroy what was perceived as the continuing 
identity of persons already pronounced dead.)</p>
<p>By the end of the first quarter of the 19th century, when the riot 
over the dissection of the hanged man at Carlisle took place, things had 
reached a fever pitch. With scientific resuscitation, technology had 
intruded into the macabre. The horrific potential of the new 
electromechanical resuscitative technology had its influence on Mary 
Shelley, who in 1818 had first set out to write a ghost story, but 
instead ended up producing a cautionary tale of the technological 
resuscitation of a soulless corpse by a medical experimenter. Given the 
spirit of the times, the story touched a public nerve as though with one 
of the new electrical machines, and Frankenstein's monster was an 
instant sensation.</p></blockquote>
And then something strange happened. Shortly after the publication of 
Shelley's famous story, the new medicine began to go out of favor, and 
the science of resuscitation began to suffer on both the technical and 
mythological fronts. It happened for several reasons.
<p>It is the propensity of all social movements to go too far. The 
<em>Humane Society</em>'s problem was that, when it came to complicated 
biology, the late 18th century did not possess the experimental 
expertise necessary to separate the wheat from the chaff. Thus, within a 
few years after its founding, the <em>Humane Society</em> had gone from
mouth-to-mouth resuscitation to the more impressive use of bellows. Following 
a number of instances of lung rupture with the bellows, however, these 
complicated and difficult-to-use devices were discarded early in the 
19th century. Mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, unfortunately, was not 
reinstituted at that time, partly because of the new discovery of
life-giving oxygen and the finding that expired air contained less of it 
(nobody bothered to find out if the difference was significant). For the 
next century and a quarter, therefore, resuscitative techniques centered 
around chest massage and armlift techniques, and mouth-to-mouth 
breathing did not return until the middle of the twentieth century.</p>
<p>Emergency electrical defibrillation fared no better. The new 
phenomenon of electricity had been transformed early-on into a quack 
cure by the practice of "galvanism" (passing mild shocks through the 
body in an attempt to cure disease), and its reputation accordingly 
tarnished. Later, and perhaps even more devastatingly, the charming new 
electricity was transmuted into a powerful and dangerous force by the 
giant transformers of Westinghouse (maligned from the first for their 
deadliness, in a PR campaign by rival industrialist-inventor Thomas 
Edison) and by the newfangled American electric chair. Technologies as 
well as people suffer from social stigmas. Mary Shelley had originally 
not specified the method of the revivification of her monster, but by 
1930, in the new electrified America, Frankenstein's monster came into 
the movies electrically charged. The upshot of all these social 
transformations was that therapeutic electric shock, so full of promise 
in the 1790s, did not again come into its own for lifesaving purposes 
(or even for psychiatric purposes, for that matter) until about the same 
time resuscitative breathing was being reassessed, in the late 1950s.</p>
<p>Other resuscitative techniques like chest/cardiac compression had 
been used sporadically since the late 19th century as well, but they too 
did not see acceptance until the late 1950s, when almost inexplicably 
all of the "modern" techniques came together approximately 
simultaneously in what we know as "cardiopulmonary resuscitation" (CPR). 
The world, apparently, was not ready until the Space Age for any of 
these techniques, and simply rejected them when brilliant and
well-meaning scientists invented them too early.</p>

<a name="observ">
<h2>Some General Observations On History</h2>
</a>

What are we to make of all this? Is there anything to be learned? In 
looking at the history of resuscitation and medicine we might ask if 
there are any observations to be made about it which might apply as well 
to the medicine of today and tomorrow.
<p>The first thing we notice is that there seem to be some themes in 
medical history which occur again and again. Important medical 
discoveries, like important philosophical discoveries, seem quite likely 
to be made by outsiders. In some cases, the "outsiders" in medicine have 
been doctors working outside the traditional groves of academe, and in 
others, the important medical discoveries have not been made by doctors 
at all. Leeuwenhoek, for instance, was a haberdasher, Pasteur a chemist, 
Fleming a bacteriologist. Recall that mouth-to-mouth resuscitation was 
the secret of midwives, and passed to medicine quite late. The original 
<em>Humane Society</em>, though founded by a doctor, was less a professional 
medical group than a group of ordinary and somewhat evangelistic 
citizens who (in exactly the manner of cryonicists) had banded together 
for humanitarian reasons and out of fear of being buried alive.   A 
second observation which can be made about the history of medicine and 
technology in general is that discoveries depend for acceptance upon a 
very complex social milieu which may have little to do with technology. 
A technological advance will not be accepted in a world which is not 
ready for it socially. The idea of using a steam engine to replace human 
muscle, for example, will not catch on in a world where human muscle 
power, because of slavery, is cheap. Conversely, a device like the 
cotton gin, which replaces delicate work with muscle work, will 
instantly be accepted in such a world.</p>
<p>For an analogous example of this phenomenon from medicine, we might 
consider the history of anesthesia. As we know from their writings, 
Muslim physicians practiced various forms of anesthesia during surgery 
back as far as the 8th century A.D. In Christendom, conversely, where 
the idea of redemptive suffering held sway, anesthesia took much longer 
to catch on. Thus, the anesthetic properties of nitrous oxide had been 
widely and publicly noted by Sir Humphrey Davy as early as 1798, yet it 
was not until the 1840s that an obscure general practitioner from 
Georgia and a couple of part-time dentists (remember our observation 
about outsiders) began to try out inhaled anesthetics for surgical 
purposes. Even at that, there was an ecclesiastical outcry when Queen 
Victoria requested chloroform for childbirth, soon after the first 
anesthetic demonstration in America. One prominent cleric complained 
that "travail and pain" in childbirth had been ordained by God in the 
Bible, and that therefore anesthesia was against the will of God. 
(Others pointed out Genesis 2:21 where Adam is put to sleep as the rib 
is taken for Eve. Scriptural wars can be quite inventive.)</p>
<p>What then held up full cardiopulmonary resuscitation until the late 
1950s, even though the world had discovered all of its essential 
features before 1900? We can only speculate, but the answer may lie in 
the fundamental change in the way which people began to relate to and 
trust technology between 1900 and 1950 - a social change which is as 
profound as any generation of humans has ever had to cope with. (See 
Frederick Lewis Allen's book <em>The Big Change: America from 1900 to 
1950</em>.) Mythmaking, as ever, played a role. If technology first crept 
into our nightmares with Frankenstein, it later (redemptively) crept 
into our heroic myths and won some measure of acceptance. Thus, if the 
new 20th-century technology of aviation was capable of creating a new 
kind of hero like Charles Lindbergh, the public was also willing to let 
him have a technological shot at Death with his new artificial heart 
machine. In any case, the mantle of Dr. Frankenstein had by the middle 
of the 20th century passed to the physicists and their atom bombs, and 
medicine for the time being, was at last back in the heroic mode. This 
situation continued until the development of the modern ICU and "life 
support," at which time doctors and medical technology began taking 
criticism once again.</p>

<a name="cryo">
<h2>Cryonics</h2>
</a>

In the context of some of the foregoing observations, it is interesting 
to consider cryonics as an unaccepted technical idea. The study of 
history always offers perspective. Thus, if we cryonicists shudder with 
dread over the idea of a "premature" burial, or the idea of a viable 
person being destroyed by the autopsy knife, we may be a bit chastened 
to find that this conflict is already two centuries old, and not over 
concerns invented entirely by us.
<p>As a practical matter, it might first be well to remind ourselves of 
the sources of danger in these situations. It takes only a change in 
point of view to regard a person in full cardiac arrest as being in a 
desperate and life-threatening situation for not just a few minutes, but 
(perhaps) days. This, in turn, may change the whole tenor of the game, 
for having a loved one in a desperate situation can engender the most 
desperate acts. Historically, as we have seen, violence has been 
committed over the question of dissecting a relative who might be 
viable, and as we have also seen, this very situation is a prime area of 
potential conflict between cryonicists and society. (We have seen 
cryonicists taken into custody over this question, though fortunately, 
not yet for long.) All of this should re-emphasize the need to do 
tremendous amounts of prior legal preparation, if we are not eventually 
to be faced with the otherwise inevitable situation in which a 
cryonicist is charged with the assault of a coroner or pathologist.</p>
<p>Of course, the question of viability holds another danger specially 
for cryonicists, over and above our potential conflict with government. 
If a man in the throes of grief is capable of killing on behalf of a 
potentially viable "deanimated" loved one, then the refusal of
"last-minute" cases (no matter the circumstances) places cryonics 
organizations in a potentially explosive confrontation with the public 
as well. Here, <em>cryonicists</em> are the potential targets. We have seen 
cases in the news where distraught relatives have killed ER physicians 
in the midst of grief and misplaced anger. Might not then the same 
violent action be directed at representatives of a cryonics organization 
which was in the position of being (technically) able to rescue a viable 
person, but (for necessary financial reasons) refused to do so? If 
history is not to be repeated, it is clear that security concerns are 
going to have to be paramount for cryonicists in the future.</p>
<p>What about wider concerns? Here, too, the past has something to 
teach, this time about groups of concerned people who began as outsiders 
to established medicine, yet later prevailed. Although the cry of "They 
laughed at the Wright brothers, too!" has long been the defense of 
crackpots, even a cursory examination of the history of medicine shows 
that the initial non-acceptance of any important new idea by that 
profession is almost de rigueur. Thus, although the mere fact of medical 
non-acceptance does not prove the cryonicists' cause, at the same time 
cryonicists certainly do not necessarily need to suffer embarrassment on 
that score. The long view of things is helpful. At present, it seems 
likely that cryonicists play the role of the midwives of old, practicing 
their own peculiar lifesaving ministrations in parallel with medicine. 
Medicine's recognition of cryonics, like its belated recognition of 
resuscitation, will come.</p>
<p>When? Unfortunately, history is not prophecy. The answer from the 
foregoing discussion, if there is one, is that it will come when society 
is ready for it. We know that humans are not naturally very good 
scientists (our brains weren't developed for that), and very primitive 
needs and fears drive both acceptance and rejection of new technologies. 
As we've noted, the fear of premature burial stimulated a series of 
electrical defibrillation experiments in the late 18th and early 19th 
centuries, all of which then were suppressed for more than a century 
partly because the idea of shocking people back to life had in turn been 
killed by a single well-placed monster myth. Human beings and their 
societies run on good stories, not scientific reports. Similarly, 
American society of the 1960s, gearing up for a holy war on cancer and 
heart disease and intoxicated with the Salk-myth of the all-powerful 
medical researcher, was not ready for cryonics. By the late 1980s, 
however, when it had begun to become apparent that heart disease and 
cancer (not to mention aging) were a lot more intractable than polio, 
there existed in this society at least a subculture that was now ready 
to listen to another idea for cheating death.</p>
<p>And so here we are. From a strictly technical view, cryonics as we 
know it might have been practiced 70 or 80 years ago. Technically we 
might have been ready for it, but culturally we were not. What is more 
(let's face it), American society <em>as a whole</em> is <em>still</em> not
ready to listen to the idea of radically extended lifespans. The good news, 
however, is that with the publication of a number of popular gerontology 
books in the last decade, things are changing slowly. The social milieu 
(not to mention the age of the population) is changing, and scientific 
immortalists are getting ready for another try at the hearts of the 
public. As has been argued in previous essays, this change will require 
yet another set of new myths (hero stories) to counter Frankenstein's 
monster, just as our out-of-body experience stories now let us, as a 
society, deal with the ambiguity of complex resuscitations from clinical 
death (see the film <em>Flatliners</em>). In the case of cryonics, the new 
myths will come, too. We can only hope for all our sakes that this 
necessary process doesn't take as long as it sometimes has in the past.</p>

When Michael Shermer reviewed the second volume of my <>Science Deified 
and Science Defied</em> for the Summer, 1992 <em>SKEPTIC</em>, he began with an 
interesting passage from Robert Pirsig's <em>Zen and the Art of Motorcycle 
Maintenance</em> (1974) which I would like to use as an introduction to this 
essay on the status of beliefs in spirit phenomena and witchcraft during 
the second half of the 17th century. In this passage Pirsig's 
protagonist explains to his son why he does not believe in ghosts (1974, 
pp.38-39):
<blockquote>
      They are unscientific. They contain no matter and have no energy 
      and therefore according to the laws of science, do not exist 
      except in people's minds. Of course, the laws of science contain 
      no matter and have no energy either and therefore do not exist 
      except in people's minds...It's best to refuse to believe in 
      either ghosts or the laws of science.
</blockquote>

The reason this passage jars us into thought is that it applies 
currently accepted criteria for what it means to be an object in the 
world, and uses those to reject the existence of ghosts; then it plays a 
mind game on us by somehow applying the same criteria to statements 
which everyone is presumed to assent to and arguing that if we shouldn't 
believe in ghosts, we shouldn't believe in science either.  
<p>The usual expectation among American intellectuals--certainly among 
those who view themselves as in the least bit skeptical--is that anyone 
who believes in "science" will not believe in such creatures of 
superstition as ghosts, spirit phenomena, or
<a href="01.4.olson-footnote.html">"witches."</a> Indeed, the 
first paragraph of the first chapter of the first edition of Garvin 
McCain and Erwin Segal's immensely popular <em>The Game of Science</em>, begins 
with the claim that we no longer believe in witches precisely because we 
believe in science:</p>
<blockquote>
      Why don't you believe in witches? That question may seem 
      ridiculous  but our ancestors, who were probably as bright as we 
      are, did believe in them, and acted accordingly. Why are we so 
      different and superior? The evidence for or against witches is no 
      better than it was 400 years ago. For us, it is almost impossible 
      to believe in witches; for our ancestors, it was equally difficult 
      to deny their existence. Our new beliefs exist, in part, due to 
      the development of "scientific attitudes" (McCain and Segal, 1969, 
      p.3).
</blockquote>
Though this statement certainly reflects what most American 
intellectuals believe, there is a strange historical irony contained in 
it and in Pirsig's intentionally perverse argument that if one doesn't 
believe in ghosts, one shouldn't believe in scientific laws either. 
<p>What I want to argue, is that beliefs in witches, ghosts, and demons 
were heavily under attack and on the wane in England at the very 
beginning of the 17th century before the rise of what we would usually 
identify as modern scientific attitudes. But witchcraft beliefs, and 
beliefs in other spirit phenomena underwent a remarkable revival among 
British intellectuals during the period after the Restoration of James 
II to the throne in 1660; and this revival of demonological beliefs was 
directly and self-consciously attached to the rise of modern scientific 
attitudes among the men who were members of the Royal Society of London. 
So at least for a time it may be true to say that men actually came to 
believe in witches as a result of the development of scientific 
attitudes. In this case, the reverse of Pirsig's argument was taken with 
deadly seriousness by Joseph Glanvill, who argued that if one believed 
in the methods of modern science, one <em>should</em> also believe in ghosts 
and witches. It is probably also true (though here the issue is more 
complicated) that certain arguments in favor of witchcraft made
mid-17th-century intellectuals more favorably disposed to the new science 
than they would otherwise have been and that a general belief in spirit 
phenomena, for which witchcraft stood as a symbol (Schafer, 1969, pp. 
55-85). In order to explain how and why the rise of modern science 
became tied to beliefs in spirit phenomena in mid-17th-century England, 
I think we need to discuss briefly a continental phenomenon at the end 
of the 16th century, and look at the impact it had on early 17th-century 
English religious developments.</p>

<a name="early">
<h2>Early Criticism of Belief in Demonic Procession</h2>
</a>

A serious and concerted attack on beliefs in witchcraft and demonic 
possession had been launched at the end of the 16th century in 
connection with a series of spectacular exorcisms that were quite 
literally staged before thousands of witnesses in France between 1566 
and 1599. The goal of the Catholic priests who carried out these 
exorcisms was to promote the reconversion of French protestant Huguenots 
to Catholicism by demonstrating the power of the true Catholic religion; 
and they seem to have had substantial success.
<p>Understandably, these Catholics' claims were widely challenged by 
Protestant propagandists; but ironically, they were also strongly 
challenged by the French Catholic Crown as well; for during the 1580's 
and 1590's, public exorcisms were stirring up religious passions just at 
a time when the French Crown, through the Edict of Nantes, was trying to 
calm religious hostilities and establish official tolerance for 
Protestantism. As a consequence, in 1598, Henry IV ordered the physician 
Michael Marescot and a group of medical colleagues to investigate the 
popular claims to demonic possession of one Marthe Brosier in the 
expectation that they could establish that her "possession" was either a 
mis-diagnosis of a natural disease such as epilepsy or hysteria, or that 
they could prove it to be a deliberate fraud. Marescot's <em>Discourse 
veritable sur le faict de Marthe Brosier de Romorantin pretendue 
demoniaque_</em>appeared in 1599, to be translated immediately into English. 
The overall verdict of Marescot's investigation was stated in a 
memorable line: "Nothing from the devil, much counterfeit, a little from 
disease" (Walker, 1981, p. 35).</p>
<p>Without totally denying the possibility of demonic possession, 
Marescot and his colleagues were able to establish to their own 
satisfaction, that of the king, and that of many readers, that in one of 
the most celebrated cases of "possession," an initially deluded and 
psychologically unbalanced woman had been exploited by her family and by 
a group of Catholic clergy, for both financial gain and for the 
seditious purpose of stirring up anti-Huguenot sentiment.  In the 
process, Marescot reviewed a series of experimental tests for legitimate 
possession which had become widely accepted by the late 16th century:</p>
<ol>
<li>possessed persons were supposed to be able to understand and speak 
languages of which they had no prior knowledge;</li>
<li>possessed persons were supposed to be able to discern secrets and 
predict events of which they could have no natural knowledge--i.e., 
they had clairvoyance;</li>
<li>possessed persons had abnormal bodily strength and insensitivity 
to pain; and</li>
<li>possessed persons expressed revulsion at holy things, especially 
the reading of scripture or contact with holy water or other blessed 
objects (Walker, p.12).</li>
</ol>
Under investigation by Marescot and four other physicians, it was 
shown that Marthe Brosier could understand neither Latin nor Greek, as 
her advocates had claimed; that she had no reaction to holy water that 
was passed off as ordinary water, but that she convulsed when she was 
given plain water that she was told was blessed; that she showed no 
special clairvoyant powers; and that when she was read passages from the 
<em>Aeneid</em>, expecting them to be biblical passages, she showed dramatic 
signs of disturbance. Finally, though during her fits Marthe could 
withstand the pain of the "deep pricking of long pins" in her hands and 
neck without showing discomfort, Marescot did find her responsive to 
normal sources of pain when not in convulsions; and he identified her 
reactions in this matter as typical of "melancholic" persons (Walker, 
pp. 34-35, 38).
<p>Just a few years later, the English physician Edward Jordan, who was 
consulted in two cases of supposed demonic possession, published a 
treatise whose title discloses its major conclusions: <em>A briefe 
Discourse of a Disease called the Suffocation of the Mother. Written 
upon occasions which hath been of late taken therby, to suspect 
possession of an evil spirit, or some such like supernatural power.  
Wherein it is declared that diverse strange actions and passions of the 
body of man, which in the common opinion are imputed to the Divell, have 
their true natural causes, and do accompany this disease</em> (1603). In 
this work Jordan identified almost all of those symptoms that had been 
traditionally identified with demonic possession and witchcraft--especially
insensibility, convulsions, and fits brought on by the 
presence of particular persons or artifacts with symptoms of hysteria. 
Thus, by the early years of the 17th-century there was a substantial 
medical literature which simultaneously denied the existence of 
possession and attacked virtually all of the traditional tests for its 
existence.</p>

<a name="anglican">
<h2>Anglicans Attack Demonology To Defend Their Religious Interests</h2>
</a>

Early 17th-century Anglican attitudes toward demonic possession and 
witchcraft were shaped primarily by the existence of this medical 
literature, in response to the Continental Catholic propaganda, and in 
response to a series of cases in which both an English Jesuit priest, 
William Weston, and a Puritan preacher, John Darrell, claimed to have 
cast demons out of a number of possessed children between 1585 and 1598, 
(Walker, pp. 43-73). Weston's activities were commenced in 1585, but it 
was not until 1602 that a formal inquiry was held regarding his 
exorcisms. Darrell's castings out of devils began in 1596; but in 1598, 
he was tried in London, condemned for fraudulent practices and both 
deposed from the ministry and sent to prison for at least a brief stay 
(Walker, p.64).
<p>In fact, Darrell's case seems to have been part of a major
anti-Puritan campaign by Archbishop John Whitgift, his Bishop in London, 
Richard Bancroft, and Bancroft's chaplain, Samuel Harsnett. Like the 
French Catholic exorcisms of the late 16th-century, Darrell's 
spectacular success casting out devils was drawing much favorable 
attention for his religion; but Darrell's demonics did most of the 
French examples one better by using their clairvoyance to name witches 
whom Darrell subsequently had arrested (Walker, p. 63). As a popular and 
visible Puritan, Darrell drew Whitgift and Bancroft's serious attention; 
and they apparently decided to discredit him by trying him for fraud. 
According to evidence given by William Sommers, the last of those he had 
dispossessed, Darrell taught several of his demonics how to simulate 
their symptoms, and at least in one case, i.e., that of Sommers, he even 
suggested the fraud to the victim (pp. 62-64). Sommers later recanted 
his evidence and there were apparently any number of irregularities in 
the trial, including a refusal to allow Darrell to speak; so the "trial" 
was continued in a series of publications for the next five years.</p>
<p>The major Anglican arguments were presented in Harsnett's <em>A 
Discovery of the Fraudulent Practices of John Darrell</em> (1599) and in 
John Deacon and John Walker's <em>Dialogical Discourses of Spirits and 
Devils</em> (1601-1602). In <em>The Trial of Maist Darrell</em> (1599), the 
Puritans responded by offering a largely scriptural defense of their 
claim that possession was possible and that it could be eliminated by 
appropriate prayers to God (Walker, pp. 67-68). But they also complained 
about the procedures used in Darrell's trial and they argued (quite 
rightly at the time) that the Anglican prosecutors of Darrell were more 
interested in destroying Puritanism than in eradicating Catholicism, 
otherwise they would have tried Weston the Jesuit. To this claim, 
Whitgift and Bancroft responded by ordering an investigation of Weston's 
claims and Harsnett responded by publishing <em>A Declaration of Egregious 
Popish Impostors, to withdraw the Harts of Her Majesty's Subjects from 
the Truth of Christian Religion Professed in England, Under the Pretense 
of Casting out Devils Practiced by Edmunds, Alias Weston, a Jesuit</em> 
(1603). Circumstances had conspired to give middle-of-the-road Anglican 
apologists an opportunity to simultaneously discredit both the Catholic 
and Puritan opposition by attacking their claims of dispossession. But 
in order to do so, the Anglicans had to act incidentally to undermine 
belief in both demonic possession and in witchcraft by almost completely 
accepting the medical views of Marescot, Jordan, and their colleagues. 
One of their most important converts was James I, who had defended 
beliefs in possession and witchcraft in his famous <em>Daemonology</em> of 
1597, but who had turned into a strong opponent of witch persecution by 
1616 (Shapiro, 1983, p. 199). Technically, neither Harsnett nor Deacon 
and Walker denied the possibility of witchcraft or dispossession, 
although Harsnett probably doubted the existence of either. What they 
did do was offer an explanation of how melancholia and hysteria might 
cause persons to believe in both as well as a demonstration that in many 
cases, men like Weston and Darrell exploited those beliefs and used 
fraudulent techniques to delude people into believing in their power to 
exorcise or to dispossess persons who were possessed. The major concern 
which had held Harsnett and others back from taking an even stronger 
stance against belief in witchcraft and possession at the beginning of 
the 17th century was laid out in the dedication of <em>The Trial of Mr. 
Darrell</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
      Atheists abound in these days and witchcraft is called into 
      question. Which error is confirmed by denying dispossession and 
      both these errors confirm atheists mightily....If neither 
      possession nor witchcraft (contrary to what has been so long 
      generally and confidently affirmed), why should we think that 
      there are devils? If no devils, no God.  (Walker, pp. 71, 72).
</blockquote>
Puritans thus warned the readers of Anglican tracts that demonology 
and witchcraft were proof against atheistic materialism.

<a name="demonic">
<h2>Demonic Power becomes a Natural Phenomenon</h2>
</a>

In order to protect themselves from the claim that their attacks on 
possession and witchcraft were simultaneously denials of the fallen 
angel and of God, early 17-century Anglican apologists insisted that the 
devil might indeed involve himself in human affairs, but that if he did, 
it must be through the use of natural rather than supernatural powers 
(Shapiro, pp. 200 204). In John Cotta's words:
<blockquote>
      Though the divel indeed, as a spirit, may do, and doth many things 
      above and beyond the course of some particular natures: yet doth 
      he not, nor is able to rule or command over general Nature, or 
      infringe or alter her inviolable decrees in the perpetual and 
      never interrupted order of all generations; neither is he 
      generally master of universal Nature, but Nature [is] master and 
      commander of him. For Nature is nothing else but the ordinary 
      power of God in all things created, among which, the divel being a 
      creature, is contained, and therefore subject to that universal 
      power (Clark,  1984, p. 360).
</blockquote>
One critical consequence of the "naturalization" of presumed demonic 
powers was that it brought the study of demonic activities clearly 
within the realm of natural knowledge.  Thus, Francis Bacon argued in 
<em>De Argumentis Scientarium</em> that well established "narratives of 
sorceries, witchcrafts, charms, dreams, divinations, and the like" 
should be included as legitimate data in natural histories in order to 
establish "in which cases and how far effects attributed to superstition 
participate in natural causes" (cited in Clark, p. 355). 
<p>Even though he remained formally open-minded regarding the existence 
of witches and demons, when Bacon chose to discuss particular issues, 
he, like other Anglicans, explained beliefs in witchcraft as arising out 
of the misinterpretation of natural phenomena. Thus, for example, in the 
<em>Sylva sylvarum</em>, he argued that the hallucinogenic effects of some 
ointments produced a mistaken belief in real transvection (human flight) 
and metamorphoses; so that when women charged as witches confessed to 
being transformed into animals and transported to witches sabbaths, they 
were mistakenly reporting their hallucinations as reality.</p>
<p>For most of the first half of the 17th century, while the twin 
threats of Puritanism and Catholicism seemed more immediate and critical 
to the Anglican cause than philosophically-based atheism, Anglican 
intellectuals continued to express strong skepticism regarding specific 
claims of spirit phenomena and to insist that what had traditionally 
been attributed to supernatural influences was actually accomplished 
through natural ones.  This was particularly true because as Puritanism 
and dissent became ever stronger, popular attempts at witch persecution 
intensified, and established authorities became ever more fearful of the 
religious enthusiasm which underlay them.</p>

<a name="atheism">
<h2>Atheism Reverses Attitudes About Spirit Phenomena</h2>
</a>

The problem faced by Anglican religious figures changed dramatically 
with the publication of a series of frightening works by Thomas Hobbes. 
Philosophical materialism and atheism had been a minor, though growing, 
problem in early 17th-century England. But the publication of Hobbes's 
<em>Leviathan</em> in 1651, <em>De Corpore</em> in 1655, and <em>A Physical
Dialog, or a Conjecture about the Nature of the Air</em> in 1661,
deflected attention from Catholicism and Sectarianism alike, and made
Hobbesian Atheism the new chief target of moderate Anglican apologetic
literature.
<p>Whether Hobbes was <em>really</em> an atheist is a topic on which scholars  
might differ--though just for the record, I believe he was--but no one 
can doubt that he was a bitter enemy of what he called priestcraft--or 
the authority of religious persons. Hobbes believed that priests had 
usurped power that rightly belonged to the secular sovereign. In order 
to justify his attacks on priestcraft he turned to a set of arguments 
that had been used by materialist philosophers, such as the atomist, 
Epicuros, in antiquity. According to the ancient materialists and 
Hobbes, priests exploit a natural human fear of the unknown to convince 
people that invisible powers and agents are at work in the world and 
that they (the priests) alone have the power to intercede on people's 
behalf to control these "spirits." "Who," wrote Hobbes, "that is in fear 
of ghosts, will not bear great respect to those who can make the holy 
water that drives them from him" (cited in Shapin and Schaffer, 1985, p. 
96). Similarly, he wrote: "By their demonology, and the use of exorcism, 
and other things appertaining thereto, the priests keep, or think they 
keep, the people in awe of their power and lessen the dependence of 
subjects on the sovereign power of their country."  Since it was the 
false belief in spirits, made possible by ignorance about the causes of 
events, that gave the clergy its power, according to Hobbes, the most 
effective way to fight the power of the clergy was first, to demonstrate 
that spirits, or "incorporeal substances" do not exist; and second, to 
demonstrate that all phenomena can and indeed, must be explicable solely 
in terms of matter in motion.</p>
<p>To undermine belief in immaterial spirits, Hobbes developed a 
logical argument that depended very heavily on ideas which owe their 
existence to Aristotelian philosophy. The meaning of the term 
<em>substance</em>, he argues, is derived from our experiences of physical 
bodies or "corps." The term "incorporeal substance," or "immaterial 
substance" is thus self-contradictory. To accomplish the second part of 
his goal, Hobbes purported to be able to give a completely materialist 
account of all natural philosophy. But in doing so he departed from 
ancient atomism in a way that turns out to play a major role in linking 
witchcraft and the experimental philosophy of the royal society.</p>
<p>The ancient atomists had posited the existence of atoms and void 
space, claiming that atoms move freely through the void. Descartes, 
however, defined <em>Matter</em> as that which has dimensions; and from this 
definition--which Hobbes accepted--it followed that there can be no 
void; because any space, no matter how small, has dimensions and 
therefore must contain matter. </p>
<p>Note here for future reference, Hobbes uses precisely the same kind 
of argument to deny the possibility of spirits and to deny the 
possibility of empty space. The question of whether empty space exists, 
like the question of whether immaterial spirits exist is not to be 
answered empirically. Both questions are to be answered by a purely 
rational analysis of definitions.</p>
<p>Hobbes's claim regarding spirits was, quite rightly, seen as an 
attack on almost all fundamental Christian beliefs, for it denied not 
only the existence of demons and witches, but also the immateriality and 
hence the immortality of the human soul. And if this weren't enough, 
Hobbesian Materialism took on an additional troubling aspect during the 
later civil war period when it was adopted by Richard Overton, a 
notorious political radical and one of the founders of the Levellers 
sect.</p>

<h2>Joseph Glanvill and the scientific defense of witches</h2>
</a>

This now brings me to the central events of my story--events connected 
with a moderate Anglican apologist who became both a defender and a 
member of the Royal Society of London in 1662--a man by the name of 
Joseph Glanvill.
<p>Although Glanvill had a longstanding interest in spirit phenomena 
stemming from his commitment to the Cambridge Platonist doctrine of
pre-existent souls, and though he had begun his investigations into the 
appearances of apparitions as early as 1662, it was not until 1666 that 
he published the first version of his often improved and expanded 
treatise on witchcraft, <em>Some Philosophical Considerations touching on 
Witches and witchcraft</em>. A friend, Justice of the Peace Robert Hunt, had 
tried to prosecute a coven of witches during 1664 in Somersetshire; but 
the local gentry were so skeptical that they mocked his efforts. In 
response, Hunt, who knew of Glanvill's interests, sent the depositions 
from the accused witches along with a description of the gentry's repose 
to Glanvill, and Glanvill responded with a refutation of the most common 
reasons for disbelief (Jobe, 1981, pp. 346-347).</p>
<p>Glanvill begins by explaining what is at stake if the belief in 
witches should be abandoned. Borrowing his theme from the earlier
anti-Anglican defenders of Robert Darrell, he writes:</p>
<blockquote>
      He that thinks there is no <em>witch</em>, believes a devil <em>gratis</em>,
or at least upon inducements which he is likely to find himself 
disposed to deny when he pleases. And when men are arrived at this 
degree of dissidence and infidelity, we are beholden to them if 
they believe either Angel or Spirit, Resurrection of the Body or 
Immortality of Souls. These things hang together in a chain of 
<em>connection</em>, at least in these men's <em>hypotheses</em>; and it is but 
a happy chance if he that has lost one link, holds another 
(Glanvill, 1676, p. 2).
</blockquote>
The central doctrines of religion are thus being endangered by those 
who do not believe in witches.
<p>Secondly, Glanvill immediately seeks to identify the disbelief in 
witches with the Hobbesian attack on experimental philosophy. The 
question of whether witches exist or not, he argues, is a question of 
fact; and as such it can only be settled by appeal to authority or 
sensory evidence.  There are thousands of eye- and ear-witnesses who 
have attested to "things done by persons of despicable power and 
knowledge, beyond the reach of art and ordinary nature," and these 
include not only "vulgar" persons, but "wise and grave discerners...when 
no interest could oblige them to agree together in a common lie." 
Unfortunately, he argues, no amount of empirical evidence could convince 
those who do not believe in witches, "since those that deny the being of 
witches, do it not out of ignorance of these heads of argument...but 
from an apprehension that such a belief is absurd, and the things, 
impossible....Upon these presumptions they condemn all demonstrations of 
this nature, and are hardened against conviction"  (Glanvill, 1676, p. 
3).</p>
<p>For Glanvill, then, the key issue was whether one placed greater 
confidence in well attested experiences or in metaphysical claims 
regarding the possibility of the existence of certain kinds of entities. 
It is not reasonable, he insists, "first to presume the thing 
impossible, and thence to conclude that the fact cannot be proved: On 
the contrary, we should judge of the action by the evidence, and not the 
evidence by our fancies about the action. This is proudly to exalt our 
own opinions above the clearest testimonies and most sensible 
demonstrations of fact: and so to give the lie to all mankind, rather 
than distrust the conceits of our bold imaginations" (Glanvill, pp.
5-6).  Given his belief in the limitations of human reason and the 
inability of humans to possess more than probable knowledge of any 
causal account of any phenomenon, Glanvill says that humans have no 
right to insist upon the impossibility of anything.  The most they can 
legitimately claim is that they cannot conceive or imagine how the 
actions in question take place, and this inability to conceive, "only 
argues the weakness and imperfection of our knowledge and apprehensions; 
not the impossibility of those performances" (Glanvill, p. 7).</p>
<p>Precisely the same kind of argument was being carried on 
simultaneously between Robert Boyle and Thomas Hobbes regarding the 
evacuated space created by Boyle in his air pumps. Hobbes denied that 
the space could be empty because he was committed to a conception of 
space derived from Descartes. According to this conception, matter, or 
body, is defined by extension, so that any extended region must contain 
matter, and a vacuum is literally impossible.  Boyle, whose notion of 
matter and space were derived from atomist notions, was unwilling to 
fight on Hobbesian ground. Whether or not extension could exist without 
a material substance underlying, it was technically an undecidable 
question and therefore beyond the bounds of natural philosophy for 
Boyle. The key question was whether well attested experiments justified 
the claim that the evacuated region was empty of ordinary corpuscles of 
air; and <a href="01.4.olson-footnote2.html">he and his allies were
convinced that they did.</a></p>
<p>The resolution of the problem of how to decide whether witches exist 
and how to decide whether the receiver of an air pump could be evacuated 
were understood by all parties to the 17th-century debates to be clearly 
linked with one another. No one, least of all Glanvill and Boyle, 
doubted that every reader convinced by Glanvill's arguments about 
witches would also be driven to toward acceptance of Boyle's arguments 
about the phenomena of the air pump, and vice versa.</p>
<p>Neither Glanvill and his allies, nor Boyle and his allies, wanted to 
encourage credulity and a lack of critical analysis of experience or 
experiments. To have argued that any individual's factual claims should 
be blindly accepted would have been, in their common view, to play into 
the hand of religious enthusiasts and philosophical charlatans. Instead, 
both sought to encourage "diffidence and backwardness of assent" to any 
such claims and to encourage the careful empirical investigation of all 
(Boyle, 1772, vol.1, pp. ccxx-ccxxii).</p>
<p>As early as January 19, 1663, Glanvill had begun to investigate 
claims of spirit phenomena when he and a gentleman friend traveled to 
Tedworth in Wilshire, where a "drumming" spirit was said to haunt the 
house of a Mr. Mompesson. The two men first interviewed the servants and 
several neighbors, including two local ministers of impeccable 
reputation, all of whom had been present when the spirit made noises or 
threw objects about the house.  Then they themselves experienced the 
noises that the spirit produced and tried to discover, "if there were 
any trick, contrivance, or common sense of it," but they could find 
nothing; so Glanvill was persuaded that, "the noise was made by some 
<em>Daemon</em> or <em>Spirit</em>" (Glanvill, 1689, p. 329). Glanvill delayed 
publication of his account of the "Drummer of Tedworth" at Mr. 
Mompesson's request until the strange phenomena ceased. (He was 
concerned that the spirit would become angered by the books!) In 1668, 
however, it became the first of 28 different detailed accounts of 
spirits and witches which Glanvill published as appendices to his 
philosophical treatments of witchcraft and demons in order to reliably 
establish the evidence for their existence. Summarizing his account of 
the drummer, Glanvill lays out a litany of criteria which such an 
account ought to have in order to be credible support for the belief in 
spirits:</p>
<blockquote>
      [The phenomena] are strange enough to prove themselves effects of 
      some <em>invisible extraordinary Agent</em>, and so demonstrate that 
      there are spirits, who sometimes sensibly intermeddle in our 
      affairs. And I think they do it with clearness of evidence. For 
      these things were not done long ago or at a far distance, in an 
      ignorant age, or among a barbarous people. They were not seen by 
      two or three only of the Melancholic or superstitious, and 
      reported by those that made them [to] serve the advantage and 
      interest of a party. They were not the passages of a day or night, 
      nor the vanishing glances of an apparition; but these transactions 
      were <em>near</em> and <em>are public, frequent, and of diverse years 
      continuance</em>, witnessed by multitudes of competent and unbiased 
      attestors, and acted in a searching and incredulous age: Arguments 
      enough, one would think, to convince any modest and capable reason 
      (Glanvill, 1689, p. 338).
</blockquote>
From the comments of Samuel Pepys, who had found the earlier 
versions of Glanvill's Witchcraft essay "unconvincing," it is fairly 
clear that the accounts of actual spirit events increased the impact of 
his arguments, making them in Pepys' view, "worth reading indeed"  
(Cope, 1956, p. 14). Whatever other impact they had, these "ghost 
stories" certainly made best sellers out of numerous editions of 
Glanvill's <em>Saducismus Triumphantus</em> and stimulated a whole tradition of 
dramatic and fictional treatments of spirit phenomena. 
<p>In the 1668 <em>A Blow at Modern Saducism</em>, which saw the first 
appearance of Glanvill's account of the drummer of Tedworth, Glanvill 
also attempted to recruit the Royal Society to help in investigations of 
spirits and thus in support for the true religion:</p>
<blockquote>
Did the Society direct some of its <em>wary</em> and <em>luciferous</em> 
enquiries towards the <em>world of spirits</em>, believe we should have 
another kind of <em>Metaphysics</em>, than those [that] are taught by men 
that love to write great volumes and to be <em>subtle</em> about 
<em>nothing</em>? For we know not anything of the world we live in, but 
by <em>experiment</em> and the <em>phenomena</em>; and there is the same way of 
<em>speculating immaterial</em> nature, by <em>extraordinary events</em> and 
apparitions, which possibly might be improved to <em>notices not 
contemptible</em>, were there a <em>cautious</em> and <em>faithful</em> history
made of those <em>certain and uncommon appearances</em>. At least it would be 
<em>standing evidence</em> against SADDUCISM, to which the present age is 
so unhappily disposed, and a <em>sensible argument</em> of our 
<em>Immortality</em> (cited in Prior, 1932, p. 182).
</blockquote>
While the Royal Society offered no official response to Glanvill's 
request, many members contributed directly to Glanvill's collection of 
Spirit relations. Boyle sent a report of an Irish Witch, who he had 
investigated and confirmed his first-hand support of an earlier account 
of a demonic possession at Mascon in France, for example. And John Beale 
sent him letters on the possible effects of witchcraft on butter 
production. Perhaps more importantly, many Royal Society members began 
to incorporate spirits into their laboratory world (Schaffer, 1987, pp. 
55-85).
<p>It is not clear to me which group benefitted more from the mutually 
supportive arguments of Anglican demonologists and experimental natural 
philosophers after 1666. On the one hand, Glanvill and his Anglican 
colleagues, such as Henry More, reached a far wider audience; and many 
persons who welcomed Glanvill's "defence" of traditional Christian 
beliefs in the immortality of the soul, were probably swayed toward a 
sympathy for experimental philosophy. On the other hand, experimental 
philosophers, as a group, probably had a more profound impact in 
legitimizing Glanvill's views among intellectuals.  In any event, for at 
least a couple of decades after the Restoration, the belief in ghosts 
and witches--which had begun to decline in the late 16th and early 17th 
century--returned as a serious and popular topic for polemical 
discussions; and those who argued in favor of beliefs in spirit 
phenomena simultaneously drew arguments from and promoted experimental 
science (Jobe, 1981, pp. 343-356).</p>

For purposes of this paper, when I use the term "witch," I use it as it
was defined by Joseph Glanvill in his <em>Saducismus Trimphatus: Or, Full
and Plain Evidence Concerning Witches and Apparitions</em> (1681),
which was probably the most widely read of all English language
demonological treatises:  "A witch is one, who can do or seems to do
strange things, beyond the known power of ordinary art and ordinary
nature, by virtue of a confederacy with evil spirits." (p. 269)  Though
some current scholars argue compellingly that this notion is a perversion
of a vital and viable spiritual tradition, it nonetheless accurately
reflects both the 17th-century perception among Christian apologists
and the meaning presumed by Garvin and McCain below.

<H1>WHAT IS THE ANT, SIR?</H1>
<H2><A HREF = "04.1.about-leikind.html">By Bernard Leikind</A></H2>

God sits in the captain's chair in the Universe's control room
wearing  a virtual reality helmet. Angels waft gently from one
flickering  control panel to another, adjusting the knobs and
peering at  computer screens. Are they PCs or Macs? Wouldn't you
like to know?  They are running a pre-creation simulation of the
Universe. The  knobs control the fundamental properties of the
Universe. Time has  not yet been created so nobody is in a hurry,
or maybe everything is  happening at once. "What's the matter
with you?" God snaps at one of  the angels. "The speed of light
is much too slow. I thought we agreed  on 300,000 kilometers per
second." An angel spins a dial to a new  setting and carefully
adjusts the vernier. "That's much better," God  says as he
relaxes back into his chair. "Let me see. Didn't we agree  that
in order to achieve my purpose for the Universe the fine 
structure constant must be precisely 1/137.07? Where are my 
notes? Yes. Here it is-- 1/137.07, exactly." An angel drifts to
the  electromagnetic field section and carefully adjusts a
control until the  display shows this peculiar number. Following
God's instructions the  angels set all the other fundamental
numbers. God removes the  helmet which has displayed simulations
of the Universe-to-be. "It  looks good to me." In a moment
commemorated on T-shirts, God  gazes at a blackboard with
Maxwell's equations on it, and commands,  "Let there be light!"
<P>Suddenly a tiny universe appears. Expanding at breakneck
speed,  it thins and cools. Galaxies form and stars flicker on.
Around a minor  star in an average galaxy a planet congeals. Do
you get the picture? <P>Fast forward about five billion years.
God's plan is working. At  about the same time that the most
advanced nation on Earth  produces humanity's crowning
achievement--the Golden Arches-- physicist Wolfgang Pauli dies.
An angel ushers him into God's study.  "Wolfgang," God says, "I
liked your work about the exclusion  principle. You really
figured out what I was up to. And I especially  admired how you
deduced the existence of the neutrino. I did my  best to hide it.
I gave it hardly any properties at all. I invited you to  visit
me because I thought that you might have some questions for  me."
<P>Pauli asks the question that every physicist would ask given
the  chance: "I always wondered why the fine structure constant
is  1/137.07." 
<P>"A good question." God walks to his blackboard and begins
filling  it with differential equations and geometric diagrams.
Finally he  finishes the proof and brushes the chalk dust from
his hands and  robe. God turns to Pauli and smiles.
<P>"It's a beautiful and clever proof," Pauli declares.
"Certainly up to  your usual standards. But over there, on the
third line from the  bottom, I believe that minus sign should be
a plus sign. Let's see.  That changes the result to 1 over 32
times 42 or 1/144."
<P>"Gee willikers." God is dismayed. "I wonder why no one ever 
noticed that before?" Reaching to the control panel, God adjusts
the  fine structure constant to 1/144. "At least its a round
number. That  .07 always bothered me." 
<P>But suddenly the universe begins to change. Electromagnetic 
forces weaken, the stars shrink and their cores heat. The higher 
temperatures increase the rate of nuclear fusion, heating the
stars  even more. Gradually they became more brilliant. The
Earth, which  has already changed radically as chemical forces
adjusted themselves  to the new value, rapidly roasts to a crisp,
barren rock.
<P>Physicists know many numbers like the fine structure constant 
that seem to have a precisely set value. Even the tiniest change
in  any one of these numbers would change the Universe so
radically  that life as we know it could not exist. If there were
only a few of  these numbers, or if they didn't have to be so
precisely tuned, they  wouldn't intrigue physicists so much. But
there seem to be many of  them. Those inclined to seek purpose in
the Universe point to these  remarkably adjusted numbers as
evidence that there must be a plan. <P>Quantum physics teaches us
that observers contribute to the  results of measurements that
they make. Since the Universe is a  quantum system, some
distinguished physicists have argued that, in  a sense, we create
the Universe by observing it.
<P>These two streams of thought converge to produce the Anthropic 
Principle; that the Universe somehow exists for us and that we
are an  expression of its purpose. Humans, so some thinkers would
have it,  are so remarkable that we must be the fruition of some
grand design.  Of course, a world that contains Geraldo, the OJ
trial, Mozart, the  Hillside Strangler, Rembrandt, the Bosnian
war, Newt Gingrich,  Shakespeare, and Einstein seems to some a
chaotic madhouse.  Seekers for purpose, like the author of
<EM>Job</EM>, often propose that God  must have inscrutable
goals.
<P>Blinded by parochial interests and supposing that what
interests  them must also interest God, proponents of the
Anthropic principle  have, nevertheless, almost got it right.
They suppose that our  wonderful achievements in art and science,
our vast numbers, our  large brains, our major effects upon the
Earth are proof of our  importance. I announce here, for readers
of <EM>Skeptic</EM>, the true  principle, the Ant-thropic
Principle.
<P>During the age of dinosaurs, our ancestors were small
insignificant  creatures. Fortunately, a passing asteroid wiped
out the competition,  creating ecological space for our
development. Can that asteroid have  been a random event? Think
of how carefully it must have been  aimed. What if it were
slightly too big and wiped everything out, or  too small and too
many lizards survived? It may surprise you to  know that during
the age of dinosaurs, ants were relatively  insignificant. There
were only a few primitive species. The asteroid  didn't smash
into the Earth to allow the evolution of primates and  humans,
but to allow for the evolution of ants. How do I know this? 
Well, look at the results.
<P>There is only one species of humans and even counting all of
the  primates we have only a few dozens of relatives. There are
at least  9,000 species of ants and entomologists are still
finding new ones.  Entomologists estimate that there may be 10
quadrillion ants in the  world, more than a million ants for
every man, woman, and child.  Many of you, no doubt, believe that
you have met your personal  ants.
<P>Now, a million ants only weigh a few kilograms, so we outweigh 
them, but no ant ever needed liposuction. Do we want to claim 
superiority based upon adipose tissue?
<P>Some humans might claim superiority based upon our 
achievements such as agriculture, civil society, architecture,
and art.  We should not feel so confident. 
<P>Consider architecture and urban planning. Long ago ants
achieved  things that we have reached only recently. Their houses
are air  cooled, well-drained, structurally sound, and clean.
They don't burn  and they don't collapse in earthquakes. The
streets don't need traffic  lights and they don't have pot holes.
They are safe for females at  night.
<P>What about agriculture? Some ants remain in the stage of 
primitive hunter-gatherers, but others have highly specialized 
agricultural or garden societies. These ants gather leaves as
nutrients  to grow a specialized fungus or mushroom. Other ants
are herders.  They tend aphids. They herd them on my orange tree
leaves, protect  them from enemies, and milk them for food. Ant
agriculture is all  natural, renewable, and does not pollute the
environment 
<P>I don't want to make ants out to be saints. They raid one
another's  nests, steal food, carry off babies, and take slaves.
They form vast  armies that march cross country destroying
everything in their  paths. But in a final analysis, ant pluses
far outweigh ant minuses. <P>Do humans create the Universe by
observing it? Maybe ants do  the job. They are known to navigate
by guiding on the sun and they  can use polarized sky light to
help them locate it.
<P>Ants communicate by taste. They send chemicals back and forth 
to recognize nestmates or interlopers, express their feelings,
and  guide their sisters to food. Ants spray noxious chemicals on
their  enemies.
<P>Ants share many other interests with humans. Some like eating 
out at picnics and restaurants, while others prefer cocooning at
home. <P>Ants have achieved remarkable social organizations by
assigning  each to the tasks for which they are most appropriate.
Males eat and  make love. Females run the show and do all the
work. Perhaps that's  why things run so smoothly in the ant
world.
<P>All of us would like to know the meaning of life. In Kurt 
Vonnegut's <EM>The Sirens of Titan</EM>, a distant galactic
civilization created  humanity so a spare part for one of its
rocket ships would get to Titan, a moon of Saturn. In <EM>The
Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</EM>, the  crucial answer to the
question is 42. Why do we require that our  existence have a
cosmic significance? What if ants are the answer?  Are we to fall
into despair and nihilism? Or should we find our own  purpose?
The ability to create our own purposes is what sets us  apart
from all other creatures. And it is by our choices that our peers 
and descend-ants will judge us.

<body><h1>WWWBoard Frequently Asked Questions and Answers</h1>
Here is a brief explanation of some of the questions you may have 
about WWWBoard.<hr>
<ul>
<li><a href="#links">Can I use html tags anywhere in my posts?</a>
<li><a href="#colons">Why are there colons in the message section when I 
try post a followup?</a>
<li><a href="#reload">Why didn't my post show up?</a>
<li><a href="#getit">Where can I get the scripts for this program?</a>
</ul><hr><p>
<a name="links">Can I put html tags anywhere in my posts?</a><p>
No.  You can not use HTML tags in any field except body of the message.  
The maintainer of the script has the option of allowing or 
disallowing any HTML in the Message part of your posting.  If 
they disallow it, the script will just throw out everything in 
&lt;&gt;'s.  If they allow it, your html markup will appear in 
the posting.  It can't hurt to try.<p><hr><p> 

<a name="colons">Why are there colons in the message when I try to post a 
followup?</a><p>
Colons appear in the message dialog box when you try to followup up on a 
message to indicate that those lines are quoting the previous document. 
The owner of the WWWBoard can decide whether they wish to enable or 
disable the quoting of previous messages.<p><hr><p>


<a name="reload">Why didn't my post show up?</a><p>
Your post most likely did not show up, because your browser did not reload the 
page, it simply pulled it out of cache.  Please reload your browser and it 
should then appear.<p><hr><p>
<a name="getit">Where can I get the scripts for this program?</a><p>
The scripts are written in Perl and created by <a 
href="http://alpha.pr1.k12.co.us/~mattw/home.html">Matt Wright</a>.  They are 
free to anyone who wishes to use them and you can get them as well as other 
scripts at: <a href="http://worldwidemart.com/scripts/">http://worldwidemart.com/scripts/</a>.  
Enjoy!<p><hr>

<H2>ABSTRACT</H2>
</A>
Nobelist Kary Mullis once asked for a reference paper with 
the simple statement "HIV causes AIDS." This article reviews 
the modern argument for the HIV/AIDS hypothesis, covering 
main lines of evidence from human epidemiology and 
experimental animal virus research. Special attention is paid 
to the issue of how AIDS may be defined so that the 
possibility of AIDS without HIV may still be theoretically 
discussed. Major emphasis throughout this article is placed 
on the arguments of modern HIV/AIDS skeptics, Peter Duesberg 
and Robert Root-Bernstein, who do not believe that HIV has a 
central role in AIDS. It is concluded that HIV/AIDS skeptics 
have chosen overly broad definitions of AIDS which are not 
clinically useful, and which would, if employed, result in 
many confusing diagnoses of "AIDS" and "HIV-free AIDS" in 
people with good prognoses. HIV is one of a closely-related 
family of viruses which causes AIDS-like immunodeficiency 
diseases in a number of animals species, and HIV/AIDS 
skeptics have ignored or minimized this research in order to 
construct needlessly complicated alternative hypotheses for 
the cause of AIDS. These alternative views are based on 
correlations between AIDS and toxin exposure shown by 
epidemiologists to be artificial a decade ago, but which 
skeptics still refuse to abandon. Examination of the HIV/AIDS 
controversy thus allows us to draw some general lessons about 
how skepticism in science works, and the ways in which it can 
go pathologically awry.

<A NAME = "intro">
<H2>INTRODUCTION: A DIALOGUE IN INDUCTIVE FRUSTRATION</H2>
</A>

Let us suppose that you have a bright and iconoclastic friend 
who smokes three packs of cigarettes a day. You remark one 
day that you would like to see him quit the habit, since he 
is certainly increasing his chances of lung cancer.
<P>   "Prove it," he says.
<P>   "Well," you begin, "the Surgeon General and a lot of 
scientists and doctors say you should quit...."
<P>   "Come now!" says your friend, "Since when did you become a 
fan of The Argument From Authority? I can find you scientists 
who do NOT believe I necessarily should quit; as well as a 
lot of intelligent business executives."
<P>   "Sure, but all those scientists and executives are paid by 
tobacco companies or grants from the Tobacco Institute," you 
protest.
<P>   "Well, what do you expect?" says your friend, lighting up 
and taking a satisfying drag. "Whenever scientists take an 
anti-establishment position, funding is cut off. The poor 
scientists then don't have anyone else to support their 
research but the Tobacco Institute. Do you expect them to 
drop out of research just because they hold unpopular 
opinions?"
<P>   "Okay, let's look at the data," you say. "What about the 
fact that 90% of lung cancer occurs in smokers?"
<P>   "Yes," says your friend, "and that means that 10% of it 
occurs in non-smokers, doesn't it? Obviously the 'cigarettes 
= lung cancer' hypothesis doesn't explain all lung cancer. 
Even for smokers there must be 'co-factors.' Heck, my 
grandfather smoked three packs a day right up to the day he 
was hit by a drunk driver at the age of 92. A lot of people 
smoke for a whole lifetime and never get cancer."
<P>   "Look, I didn't say the correlation was perfect!" you 
protest. "But it is certainly there. Two-pack-a-day people 
have 13 times the lung cancer risk of non-smokers."
<P>   "Oh, really?" your friend says, "Now, where do you get 
that number? I suppose somebody did an experiment where they 
got together a group of nonsmokers and randomized them to 
start smoking, or else stay smoke-free, and then made sure 
each and every person did as told for the next 40 years, so 
as not to bias the results. I must've missed that study."
<P>   "You know there is no such study. That experiment would 
have been impossible, since you can't enforce a random 
protocol like that. People will start or stop on their own. 
And besides, any experiment where you try to keep people from 
quitting would be immoral, since smoking causes cancer."
<P>   "So you admit you don't have any study where the two 
groups of smokers and nonsmokers are exactly equivalent, and 
only differing by chance or random draw? In every study the 
smokers and the nonsmokers are self-selected for their 
behavior and bound to be different not only in smoking 
behavior, but also because of whatever made them smoke or not 
smoke to begin with, right?! Not exactly great science, if 
you ask my layman's opinion."
<P>   "But when smokers quit, we know their risk of dying 
drops," you retort.
<P>   "You mean with regard to the smokers who don't quit? So 
what? The people who quit smoking did so for a reason other 
than chance or the experimental flip of a coin and again that 
means they will differ in some way other than their not 
smoking. Besides, did you know that for the first year after 
quitting, the risk of death for a new quitter actually goes 
up with regard to his fellow smokers who keep right on 
smoking?"
<P>   "I knew you'd bring that up. The mortality goes up for the 
quitter group for a while after they quit only because those 
people who quit are quite often sick, and that's why they 
quit."
<P>   "If so that makes my point about self-selection, doesn't 
it? You're saying that in that first year of quitting, the 
higher death rate of quitters is caused by another factor in 
our study other than smoking--namely, sickness. Well, so long 
as we're talking about such third factors, I have a hunch 
that stress causes cancer, and stressed-out people take up 
smoking to try to relieve the stress, and that's why there is 
more cancer in smokers, not because of smoking. Moveover, 
maybe the act of quitting stresses people out, and that's 
really why quitters die faster in that first year after 
quitting. Smoking is just a marker for stress--what you 
scientists call a "proxy variable."
<P>   "All this is ridiculous! You're just using your intellect 
to make you believe something you want to believe for other 
reasons. There is experimental evidence! Smoking causes lung 
cancer in lab animals! Are THEY stressed?"
<P>   "Actually, yes--have you seen what they do to them in a 
modern lab? Ever seen one of those rabbits with a leather 
muzzle over its nose, and a cigarette stuck in it which it 
can't take out? But anyway, I don't even believe you can find 
me a report of an experiment in which smoking causes lung 
cancer in animals."
<P>   Back you go to the scientific literature. And you find 
nothing. There is no such paper . . . .

<A NAME = "induct">
<H3>Medical Induction</H3>
</A>

As this fact-based, fictional dialogue demonstrates, because 
there are many intellectual steps which are not perfectly 
secure in any generalization, even the most detailed 
inductive argument only goes so far toward proof. Not only 
may the same evidence mean different things to different 
people, it is more difficult to get people to follow a 
complicated inductive-reasoning trail when they dislike, or 
are threatened by, the conclusion at the end.
<P>   In the medical sciences, assembling an irrefutable 
argument for causation is sometimes an impossible task for 
the same reason it is in astronomy or paleontology: the 
direct and definitive experiment cannot be done. Scientists 
cannot travel back in time to watch dinosaurs, nor can they 
influence the behavior of planets or stars. In medicine, a 
common difficulty is that the necessary human interventive 
experiments to perfectly assess "risk factors" for harm may 
be unethical, and so these risks cannot be studied directly 
by experiment either.1 How, then, do we come to "know" what 
things cause lung cancer or AIDS? For that matter, how do we 
come to know with any confidence that tyrannosaurs ate meat, 
or what generates the sun's energy? In other words: how do we 
ever infer causation from looking at events (or records of 
events) which we cannot influence?
<P>   However we do it, it does seem that it can (to some 
extent) be done. Modern science depends on the fact that 
"correct" causal relationships can often be guessed entirely 
from logical and indirect observational tests of competing 
theories, even where direct experimentation is not possible. 
This is done using help from knowledge of simpler causal 
mechanisms which we have gained from similar systems in which 
experimentation is possible. As Einstein observed, one of the 
most amazing things about the universe is that this kind of 
inference is possible at all. 
<P>   Of course, the overall results of this kind of theorizing, 
like those of any inductive process, are never certain. 
Still, whenever inferential theories in science finally do 
become directly testable by some new experimental technique, 
they often prove to be surprisingly sound. Why this should be 
true remains the deep mystery that it was for Einstein. 
<P>   It is because of an inferential process, based on many 
lines of evidence, that we can be reasonably confident of the 
tobacco causation of much of lung cancer, even in the absence 
of a definitive experimental study. In the same way, an 
examination of a large body of related facts allows us 
reasonable confidence about the causation of other diseases--
even a disease far more complicated than lung cancer, and 
with even more money and passion involved on both sides of 
the issue.

<A NAME = "part1">
<H2>PART I</H2>
<H2>THE AIDS SKEPTICS AND THEIR CLAIMS</H2>
<H3>Should We Be Skeptical?</H3>
</A>

Recently, several popular lay publications (<EM>Reason</EM>, <EM>Spin</EM>, <EM>New 
York Native</EM>) have run articles calling into question the 
theory that the viral agent with the conclusion-asserting 
name, the "human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)," is the cause 
of the epidemic of human acquired immune deficiency syndrome, 
known as AIDS.
<P>   What do we mean by talking of the "cause" of AIDS? We know 
that the common cold or the flu--indeed all infectious 
diseases--are in some sense "caused" not only by the 
organism. Also important in the causal chain are host factors 
(such as immune response), and even simple host-overwhelming 
factors, such as the infectious dose of organism which enters 
the body (called the "inoculum"). These additional causal 
factors, which have nothing to do with the microbe itself, 
can be extremely important. They may in some cases outweigh 
everything else. Nevertheless, because the smallpox virus 
(for example) is necessary for smallpox, medical science 
still regards it as "causal" in the sense that if there is no 
microbe, there is no illness. Eliminate the smallpox virus 
from the population and one eliminates the disease (as was in 
fact done in the 1970s).
<P>   Even this kind of "causal" connection between a disease 
syndrome and infectious agent is what is under attack in 
recent articles about HIV and AIDS. Some skeptics have 
claimed not only that HIV is not the only external factor 
necessary for AIDS, but that if HIV were eliminated from the 
Earth, at least some AIDS would still be with us. Still 
others have gone further and claimed that HIV infection is 
totally harmless and does not even contribute to the 
development of AIDS. These people believe that if HIV were to 
disappear, AIDS would continue exactly as before.
<P>   In what follows, we will examine the best evidence behind 
what most researchers believe is the role of HIV and other 
factors in AIDS. We will also examine leading skeptical views 
on the causation of AIDS. Because a great deal of published 
research is available on this issue, our examination of AIDS 
will also let us illustrate how science closes in on cause 
and effect, even when direct experimental "proof" is not 
available.
<P>   We will thus be interested in not only AIDS, but also 
larger questions about science, and scientific debate. What 
makes a good scientific theory, and what makes a poor one? 
Are there reasons for hope in looking at the disease of AIDS 
in particular, and the workings of the biomedical scientific 
"establishment" in general? Are we making any progress with 
AIDS, or just wasting billions each year chasing fantasies?
<P>   This essay will argue that we are not wasting all that 
money, and that when it comes to critics of the HIV/AIDS 
hypothesis, we have a practical case in which skepticism has 
been taken too far. Science, we are happy to report, still 
works, and it is making progress with AIDS. That some critics 
have failed to recognize this only highlights the fact that 
science is only partly an empirical enterprise, and that it 
also has an intuitive and aesthetic side which is subject to 
arguments over taste. This is not a thing which is taught to 
students in schools, but it is a concept key to understanding 
most scientific controversies.

<A NAME = "defining">
<H3>Defining AIDS</H3>
</A>

Scientific problem-solving begins with definitions, and in 
choosing a definition for AIDS we run immediately into the 
HIV/AIDS controversy. Some of the difficulty is that 
definitions, even in science, are chosen partly on aesthetic 
grounds, partly on utilitarian ones.
<P>   In medical science we rarely know in detail at the 
molecular or even cellular level what causes most human 
illness, and so in our ignorance we are often forced to work 
with "disease syndromes," which are collections of symptoms 
and sometimes lab tests which seem to "go together." In order 
to usefully define a "disease syndrome" we need to pick our 
defining characteristics so as to include all of the sick 
people who we are interested in for good clinical reasons, 
and exclude everyone else.
<P>   What are good clinical reasons? In medicine there is not 
much point in defining a new "disease" which, when present, 
makes no difference in either prognosis or treatment. Nor is 
there any point in defining a disease so poorly that it fails 
to capture all the sick people who seem to have pretty much 
the same thing wrong with them from the prognosis or 
treatment viewpoint. If (as always happens) we lack 
information about what impact certain definitional 
characteristics have upon treatment or prognosis, then we are 
forced to guess, as best we can, what definition will be most 
useful. It is at this point, in deciding whether two people 
have "pretty much" the same thing wrong with them, that 
aesthetic and intuitive considerations unavoidably enter into 
medical science.
<P>   Utility imposes other constraints, too. A disease 
definition which is to be used during a hunt for the 
disease's causation, should not assume any cause which is in 
question. In other words, if we choose a definition for AIDS 
which requires infection with the HIV virus (the current way 
it is done in many countries, including the U.S.), then we 
will have chosen our terms so as to be of little help in the 
question of whether HIV causes AIDS. Obviously, it would be 
nothing remarkable if we "discovered" that 100% of people 
with AIDS were infected with HIV, if we defined AIDS in such 
a way as to require HIV infection.
<P>   In re-opening the question of the cause of AIDS, what we 
need is a modified AIDS definition which does not involve 
HIV, so that the question of whether or not all AIDS cases 
are infected with HIV is an empiric one, not simply a 
semantic one. When we have a suitable HIV-free candidate 
definition for AIDS, we can then ask two critical questions 
about it: 1) Have we captured with our definition all of the 
people with the new medical problem that we historically came 
up with the AIDS label, in order to describe and encompass in 
the first place? 2) If we test our defined group, are 100% of 
the people encompassed by our AIDS definition found to be 
infected with HIV, an otherwise rare virus in the population? 
If the answer to both these questions is yes, then HIV is 
promoted to a good candidate for a cause of AIDS. If either 
answer is no, then the HIV/AIDS hypothesis obviously has 
severe problems right from the start.
<P>   Fortunately, however, we can easily construct a workable 
definition of AIDS which does not include any reference to 
HIV, but which still describes the new epidemic in which we 
are interested. Such a definition will not be the standard 
one, of course, but since the standard modern HIV-containing 
AIDS definition is unusable for this purpose, both we and the 
AIDS skeptics are required to construct special AIDS 
definitions even to continue to talk about the problem of 
causation. 

<A NAME = "redefining">
<H3>Redefining AIDS:
<BR>Acquired Immune Failure Syndrome</H3>
</A>

What is the best way to define AIDS without reference to HIV? 
Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome is the name historically 
chosen for a new medical syndrome which is essentially 100% 
fatal, and thus in defining it we are looking for people with 
an immune deficiency in the range which is life-threatening 
and will continue to grow relentlessly worse until life is 
impossible.
<P>   One possible way to define immune deficiency would be to 
define it by what problems it causes--for instance, one could 
pick people who have gotten so-called "opportunistic 
infections" or strange infections which are seldom if ever 
seen in people whose immune systems are fully functional. In 
the early days of AIDS, before HIV was discovered, the 
syndrome was indeed defined using such opportunistic diseases 
(Fig. la), and people with these infections are still 
included in the federal Centers for Disease Control (C.D.C.) 
clinical surveillance definition of AIDS (but now only if 
they are also HIV infected). We will not be able to use this 
C.D.C. definition (Fig. lc). Not only does it assume HIV 
infection, but for historical, political, and technical 
reasons, it also is constructed in a way which does not 
assess current immune status in the best way.
<P>   Why is this? The basic problem is that only a limited 
amount of information about a person's immune system function 
flows from the bare fact that they have an "opportunistic" 
infection. Certainly there is a good correlation between 
immune function and what kind of opportunistic infections 
occur, but the correlation is far from perfect, since 
opportunistic infection risk is influenced by not only immune 
status, but also by the quality of what we may term the 
infectious "assault" to the system. The assault in turn is 
influenced by a person's physical location, infection 
contacts, personal habits, and other exposure factors both 
known and unknown. In the end, assault differences insure 
that some unlucky, highly infection-exposed people manage to 
contract opportunistic infections when only mildly immune 
compromised (though these are rarely fatal). By contrast, the 
same assault differences insure that other people who are 
badly immunologically impaired may escape opportunistic 
infections for an amazingly long time, simply by missing the 
microbes which will kill them (Fig. 1a).
<P>   When it comes to immune function, then, it is better to 
have a direct test which is not subject to uncontrolled 
variables such as which microbes happen to be in the air or 
drinking water, and how many. Such a test exists. Quite early 
in the history of AIDS, it was found that the immune defect 
in this disease is peculiar, and that it most visibly 
involves a particular kind of cell in blood and lymphatic 
tissues (lymph "nodes"), called "T-lymphocytes." In the 
syndrome of AIDS, certain T-lymphocytes gradually disappear 
from both blood and lymph tissues, and a simple T-lymphocyte 
count in the blood can tell how serious the reduction has 
been in both places (since blood lymphocytes come from the 
lymphatics). The arm of the immune system which is controlled 
most directly by T-lymphocytes (the body's defense against 
viruses and fungi) is what is most defective in AIDS, and 
viral and fungal infections are the main opportunistic 
infections which appear and cause death in AIDS.
<P>   AIDS is so specific in its attack that scientists 
eventually found that only one subset of T-lymphocytes was 
initially hardest-hit. This was the so-called CD4+ or 
"helper" T-lymphocyte, which has the job of stimulating the 
immune system. The other major type of blood T-lymphocyte, 
the CD8+ or "suppressor" lymphocyte, is involved in shutting 
the immune system down; in AIDS, CD8+ lymphocyte blood 
numbers increase early in the disease, and are not decreased 
until near the very end of the disease process, when they may 
also disappear.
<P>   CD4+ lymphocyte blood counts tell much of the story in 
AIDS and other immunodeficiencies involving the T-lymphocyte 
immune system. A healthy adult might have a CD4+ lymphocyte 
count of 800 to 1000, with a CD8+ count half of this. These 
are normal values. Under physical stress, injury, or chronic 
infection, CD4+ lymphocyte count might drop to 500 (to even 
less than the CD8+ count), and mild, non-fatal opportunistic 
infections might be the result. A CD4+ count less than the 
CD8+ count was once used as a crude marker for AIDS, but 
today with progress we know that this immune state is non-
specific. In AIDS, things eventually become much worse than 
this, and the worse things get, the fewer possible 
alternative causes are possible.
<P>   In full-blown AIDS, as defined by opportunistic infections 
and other problems, the CD4+ count is usually below 200. It 
is at such count levels that Kaposi's sarcoma (a tumor 
perhaps caused by a virus) and life-threatening infections 
begin to appear, although approximately 95% of AIDS patients 
survive beyond this level of decline.2 Another feature of 
AIDS, however, is that inevitably the count grows worse over 
time. Today, in the modern era of antibiotics and more 
knowledgeable care, 85% of AIDS patients live to see their 
CD4+ lymphocyte count drop below 50.3 Famous AIDS sufferer 
Kimberly Bergalis, for instance, had her CD4+ count drop to 
41 before her disease was even diagnosed.4 Many AIDS patients 
today go all the way to CD4+ counts of zero before the 
inevitable final infection or other complication. It is 
because of the implacable and more or less irreversible loss 
of vital T-cells that AIDS remains a fatal condition, with an 
average time span of less than two years between the first 
opportunistic infection and death.
<P>   If we wish to define AIDS in terms of immune failure, the 
essential question is where do we draw the line, so as to 
include almost all people with the new immunodeficiency 
epidemic, who are going to die from it, but exclude everyone 
else? If we simply define "immune deficiency" as a sustained 
CD4+ lymphocyte count of less than 200 (where death begins to 
become more likely), we will capture about 95% of people who 
die of what the C.D.C. now defines as "AIDS" (Fig. lb).
<P>   Previous to the epidemic of AIDS, of course, people did 
die of immune failure with low T-lymphocyte counts (including 
low CD4+ counts) for other reasons, and they continue to do 
so now. Thus, we must also exclude from our AIDS definition 
all those people who have one of the classic reasons for a 
very low T-lymphocyte count--reasons which were well-known 
before the AIDS era (cancer, malnutrition, tuberculosis, 
radiation, chemotherapy, etc). These people do not have AIDS, 
because the historical epidemic of AIDS consisted of people 
with no T-lymphocytes, and yet no known reason for it. These 
people had appeared newly on the scene in the 1980's with 
evidence of a fatal kind of immune failure which was 
acquired, meaning that it was an epidemic problem of 
something "picked up" by previously healthy people.
<P>   So let us simply collect all the people we can find with 
CD4+ counts remaining below 200 (for a few months) without 
known reason, and test them for HIV. When we do, we find that 
essentially all are HIV infected, and any who are not do not 
look at all like typical AIDS patients (as we will see). 
This, despite the fact that only 0.3% of the general 
population carries this virus. Thus, at this point we have no 
evidence yet to directly contradict the simple theory that 
HIV causes 100% of our conservatively defined "AIDS." AIDS 
skeptics will need different definitions in order to find 
HIV-free AIDS. (Fig. 1d and 1e). 

<A NAME = "skeptics">
<H3>Enter the AIDS Skeptics</H3>
</A>

The view that HIV plays no role in AIDS has been most notably 
put forth by Peter H. Duesberg, professor of molecular and 
cell biology at the University of California at Berkeley. A 
German emigree, he was originally trained in chemistry. On 
arriving in the U.S. in 1964 he began work in the field of 
viral molecular biology at Berkeley, where in 1970 he co-
discovered the genetic basis for the carcinogenic action of 
the Rous sarcoma retrovirus. In 1987 he began publicly 
questioning the role of HIV in AIDS, a stand which has made 
him the center of the present HIV/AIDS controversy. 
Duesberg's most recent book is called Why We Will Never Win 
the War on AIDS (1994), co-authored by a Berkeley graduate 
student and one-time protege Bryan J. Ellison. The book has 
been plagued by trouble. According to a message issued 
October 13, 1994 by the Group for the Scientific Reappraisal 
of the HIV/AIDS Hypothesis, this manuscript was published 
unilaterally by Ellison without Duesberg's consent, following 
failed editorial negotiations with the original contracting 
publisher (St. Martin's Press). According to Duesberg, the 
editor had asked for additional documentation, clarification, 
and elimination of material which might be considered unfair 
to individuals. Duesberg was willing to cooperate but Ellison 
was not. Following Ellison's publication of the manuscript at 
Inside Story Communications (a newsletter edited by Ellison), 
Duesberg severed relations with Ellison and is seeking an 
injunction against further publication of the book. The 
cooperation of James Tabulse, publisher of the Group's 
newsletter Rethinking AIDS, with Ellison, has meant that the 
Duesberg's Group has decided to severe relations with this 
publication as well. They now publish a new newsletter called 
Reappraising AIDS. Since Duesberg has questioned only 
publication and editorial rights for the new book and has not 
repudiated any of its contents, the book is used in this 
essay (see page references) as a source of Duesberg's views. 
A major Duesberg essay is also used.5
<P>   At the other end of the skeptic spectrum are hybrid 
arguments raised by Robert Root-Bernstein, an associate 
professor of physiology, winner of a MacArthur "genius" 
award, and author of Rethinking AIDS6, the most carefully-
documented work to yet assail the prevailing medical views on 
HIV and AIDS (see page references). Root-Bernstein is less 
radical than Duesberg, arguing for a somewhat less central 
role for HIV in AIDS than is generally given it, but still 
allowing for the virus to have some part in the etiology of 
the disease.
<P>   Since Duesberg's original challenge, which has been the 
cause of much formal debate in the literature7, a number of 
scientists, physicians, and lay persons have taken up the 
cause for a "re-appraisal" of the idea that HIV is the major 
causal factor, or even one of the major causal factors, in 
AIDS. Most respectable is the Group for the Scientific 
Reappraisal of the HIV/AIDS Hypothesis, which has collected 
over 200 signatures of physicians and scientists, including 
those of Nobelists Walter Gilbert and Kary Mullis. This group 
has campaigned to remove the requirement for HIV infection 
from any medical definition of AIDS, feeling that using this 
criterion is at best premature, and prejudices any hunt for 
alternative explanations for the disease.
<P>   Almost all critics of the AIDS/HIV hypothesis have one 
thing in common: they insist on using a much broader 
definition of AIDS than we have proposed, a definition which 
virtually guarantees that some people who fit the critics' 
AIDS definition will not be HIV infected.
<P>   To be fair, there is some historical precedent for using a 
definition of AIDS which relies solely on the patient 
developing one of a certain list of the most serious and 
specific opportunistic infections, since this was the way the 
disease was diagnosed before HIV testing became available in 
1985 (compare Fig. 1a and ld). Today we know that almost all 
such people with pre-1985 defined "AIDS" are infected with 
HIV--indeed this was known in late 1983, before the official 
announcement of viral cause was made the following year. But 
today we know this figure would not quite be 100%.13 As we 
will see below, there is evidence that the few HIV-negatives 
in this group will be people with lesser degrees of immune 
suppression (higher CD4+ counts), who will not progress to 
worse immune function, or quickly die. (Fig. 1c). It seems 
reasonable, then, with what we know today, to simply exclude 
them--since we know that this is not the characteristic 
picture of AIDS. Again, it is most reasonable for our 
purposes to diagnose AIDS on the basis of immune function 
(CD4+ levels) only, since it is immune function, not 
infection status, which correlates with short-term prognosis 
in CD4+ immunosuppressed people.
<P>   The skeptics, however, will have none of this, and in 
their definitions are seemingly less interested in clinical 
utility than they are in collecting ammunition for an 
argument. The more broadly AIDS is defined, the more "HIV-
free AIDS" cases skeptics can assemble, and these, in turn, 
can be used as evidence to the lay public that HIV cannot be 
the cause of AIDS.
<P>   Duesberg, for instance,5 has insisted upon retaining the 
early 1980's observation that a CD4+/CD8+ lymphocyte count 
ratio of less than 1.0 is often seen in AIDS, and he has 
decided that such a ratio, even in the absence of 
opportunistic infection, is synonymous with AIDS (p. 260). 
Duesberg now calls this ratio an "AIDS-defining 
immunodeficiency," and counts people with this lab result as 
part of "HIV-negative AIDS," in his shocking and too-often 
repeated statistic that there are "3,000 documented HIV-free 
AIDS cases."8 Here again, Duesberg's chosen definition of 
AIDS is less than useful because people with such mild 
immunosuppression as he uses to define "AIDS" are not the 
people who are dying, or are shortly destined to die. AIDS is 
nothing if not a fatal epidemic, and insisting that mildly 
compromised persons who may or may not eventually get any 
worse be labeled as having "AIDS," as Duesberg routinely 
does, only serves to confuse the issue (Fig le).
<P>   There is a general trend for AIDS skeptics to 
overdramatize levels of immune deficiency which are not 
clinically very significant. For example, Root-Bernstein (p. 
262), in characterizing a study of HIV-negative men newly 
infected with CMV virus, notes that for a time, some of the 
men had CD4+/CD8+ cell ratios of less than 0.4, a figure 
which he claims "represents extreme immune suppression." 
During viral infections such CD4+ depressions are transient. 
In AIDS, however, this ratio would typically be far less than 
0.3, and thus these men would not be mistaken for the current 
C.D.C. immunological definition of AIDS, even if they were 
HIV-positive.9 The level of immunosuppression associated with 
a ratio of only 0.4 is not associated with significant risk 
of death by opportunistic infection. You might wonder how we 
are justified in calling a ratio of 0.4 "extreme immune 
suppression," if people rarely die from it, as they are known 
to do in AIDS. Root-Bernstein does not say--indeed, does not 
even raise the issue. The AIDS skeptics' overdrawn 
interpretation of the clinical significance of lab results is 
one of the places in which absence of medical training shows 
most clearly.
<P>   Indeed, Duesberg's paper5 and Root-Bernstein's book6 each 
contain descriptions of groups of HIV-free people who are 
somewhat immunosuppressed due to low CD4+ counts, or low 
CD4+/CD8+ ratios, but not severely so, as defined by our 
straightforward criteria of having a significant risk of 
infectious death due to T-lymphocyte loss. These immune 
deficient patients in the AIDS skeptics' literature are 
presented along with the inference that perhaps somewhere 
there exist people with these immune suppressive factors, or 
combinations of them, who are severely T-lymphocyte 
immunosuppressed for long periods of time (as AIDS patients 
are), and yet still without having HIV. Duesberg and Root-
Bernstein only have one difficulty in this argument--neither 
has been able to actually find any such people.

<A NAME = "hivfree">
<H3>HIV-Free AIDS?</H3>
</A>

Hypotheses may be disproved by the right data with relative 
ease, and cases of HIV-free AIDS would disprove the idea that 
HIV causes AIDS, in proportion to how often these are found 
(i.e., if 10% of AIDS cases were HIV-free, this would prove 
that HIV is not the cause of at least 10% of AIDS). Thus, 
Duesberg and Root-Bernstein are not the only ones who have 
been looking for HIV-free people who are badly CD4+ 
lymphocyte immunosuppressed without reason (i.e., good 
candidates for HIV-free AIDS). Very recently the C.D.C. 
reported that after a massive search it had only been able to 
find less than 100 people without HIV infection across the 
country whose CD4+ counts were at one time less than 300 (not 
quite in the AIDS-class immunosuppression range of 200, but 
drawing close). This syndrome was named "ICL" (idiopathic 
CD4+ lymphocytopenia), meaning "people with low CD4+ 
lymphocyte counts without a medically-defined disease."
<P>   Why was ICL not simply called "HIV-free AIDS?" Critics 
have darkly suggested that the reason is politics, but in 
fact there were problems with considering these people as 
AIDS cases which had nothing to do with AIDS politics or the 
HIV theory. One difficulty was that people labeled as having 
"ICL" were found not to come from the AIDS risk groups. They 
did not use illicit drugs, had not been exposed to blood 
products, and had no evidence of sexual behavior which would 
have exposed them to a special infection risk. Thus, as we 
will see, the most popular alternative AIDS hypotheses did 
not explain these people either--a fact which did not keep 
them from being mentioned in nearly every skeptical treatment 
of the HIV/AIDS issue. What the skeptics had forgotten (or 
hoped their readers would not notice) was that the immune 
deficiency of people with ICL did not seem to be acquired.10 
What justification was there, then, for calling it AIDS?
<P>   Moreover, people with ICL were not only epidemiologically, 
but often immunologically distinguishable from AIDS cases: 
their CD4+ lymphocyte counts swung widely, and transiently, 
in response to infections, and were often much higher than 
300 (in contrast to people with AIDS, whose CD4+ lymphocyte 
counts tend to stay low and heading on an ever-downward 
trend). ICL people also often had low total lymphocytes or 
low CD8+ lymphocyte counts, again indicating that their 
immune failure did not make much distinction between CD4+ and 
CD8+ lymphocytes, as classic AIDS does. Clearly, these people 
did not belong to the classic AIDS groups which began 
suffering with epidemic immune problems about 1980. They are 
not part of the new phenomenon of AIDS, and although 
sometimes suffering from opportunistic infections, did not 
even seem to share the implacable death rate of AIDS.10 
<P>   Searches for HIV-negative people who have AIDS-type severe 
immune suppression have also been taken specifically within 
AIDS risk groups. Vermund reported in the United States 
Multicenter Cohort Study that of the 2,713 persistently HIV-
negative homosexual men in the study, who had had a total of 
22,643 blood tests, only one significantly immunosuppressed 
man (CD4+ lymphocyte counts persistently less than 300) was 
found. This man was taking chemotherapy and radiation for 
cancer, and thus had a very good reason other than his 
lifestyle to explain his lab results.11 If this study is 
indicative, then most, if not all, male homosexuals with 
sustained AIDS-range immune failure are HIV-positive, since 
it has proved very difficult to find any who are HIV-
negative.
<P>   Much the same seems to be true in IV drug users: in a 
study of 1,246 HIV-negative injecting drug users in New York 
City from 1984 to 1992, for example, only four were found 
with CD4+ lymphocyte counts less than 300 (if IV drug use per 
se was a major cause of AIDS, the number should have been far 
higher). In this small group of four people, even though 
infected with multiple non-HIV viruses, and with a history of 
heavy drug use, immune function was stable and without the 
steady decline in CD4+ lymphocyte counts over a time span of 
years which is characteristic of all unselected HIV-positive 
cohorts.12 Thus, in this study also, the few HIV-negative 
people who could be found with even near-AIDS range 
immunodepression, were still not behaving medically like 
people with AIDS.
<P>   So far as we know, then, in the United States all people 
who are a part of this new phenomenon of sustained very low 
(and declining) CD4+ cell counts in high risk groups, have 
been infected with HIV. This does not prove that HIV causes 
AIDS, but it is surely an important clue.

<A NAME = "wohiv">
<H3>Why Not AIDS Without HIV?</H3>
</A>

A persistent suggestion by skeptics is that it would be 
proper to use as an AIDS definition the current C.D.C. 
definition (which includes all HIV-infected people who have a 
much expanded list of infections and other problems), but 
with the HIV criteria removed. (Fig. 1d.) The problem with 
this suggestion is that definitions of diseases are chosen by 
the C.D.C. for maximum clinical utility, and HIV criteria in 
the C.D.C. AIDS definition was not put there only to insure 
that there would be no HIV-free AIDS. Rather, HIV infection 
in a person with opportunistic infection is known to be 
(alone among all other viral infections) a very good 
predictor of whether immune status will continue to decay 
until the person eventually succumbs to opportunistic 
infections. In people with mildly compromised immune systems, 
the prognostic importance of an HIV infection (which even 
critics admit, without admitting causation) is large. Thus, 
we cannot simply remove HIV status from the C.D.C. definition 
and still have the definition do what it was designed to do, 
which is predict impending death by immune failure.
<P>   AIDS skeptics know that if "AIDS" is defined only in terms 
of today's much broader list of "AIDS-defining" diseases and 
infections (which are meant to be used only in conjunction 
with HIV status), it is sure to be quite true that the 
definition will be far too broad to be prognostic. Such 
opportunistic infections, as critics well know, sometimes 
happen in the population occasionally even without the most 
severe CD4+ immunosuppression which is characteristic of 
people who die with AIDS.
<P>   A study by Salvato illustrates this point.13 In the study, 
medical records over six years for 1500 HIV-positive patients 
were compared with records for 1,000 HIV-negative patients 
who had Chronic Fatigue Immunodeficiency Syndrome (CFIDS) and 
evidence of immune suppression. It was found that the CFIDS 
patients had fatigue, lymphadenopathy (swollen lymph "nodes") 
and low grade fevers--but that over the course of six years 
their problems were not severe. Only one of them developed 
CD4+ lymphocyte counts less than 300 ("ICL"). Still, two had 
yeast esophagus infections, a severe opportunistic infection 
rarely seen other than in AIDS and other people severely 
immunosuppressed. Three had active CMV virus disease of 
various tissues--another disease very often seen in AIDS. A 
total of 486 patients had evidence of yeast infection of the 
mouth on exam, a condition suggestive of mild immune problems 
but one not limited to AIDS. The average CD4+ lymphocyte 
count in these patients (not including the single ICL 
patient) ranged from 500-1400, with an average of 650. This 
was significantly lower than normal, but much higher than 
typical for AIDS.
<P>   In this study, 95% of the HIV-negative patients had 
previously been infected with the EBV, CMV or HHV-6 viruses, 
and 48% had evidence for continued viral infection (skeptics 
such as Root-Bernstein have suggested that these viruses have 
roles in AIDS at least as important as that of HIV, but this 
study provides evidence against this idea). Most 
interestingly, these immunocompromised HIV-negative patients 
were followed from two to six years, and none experienced 
progressive CD4+ lymphocyte decline (except for the one 
patient with ICL, who, with treatment of CMV infection, 
showed increased CD4+ lymphocyte counts again). Such CD4+ 
count stability is never seen in any random group of HIV-
positive people, where average CD4+ count decline with time 
would be inevitable. The authors conclude:
Even after a methodical search in a practice that sees a 
large number of patients with immune problems, only 1 patient 
was found to have ICL. However, this study demonstrates that 
patients with normal CD4 counts can develop AIDS defining 
opportunistic infections . . . Upon long-term follow-up these 
patients do not appear to experience progressive CD4 
depletion.
<P>   Most importantly, no HIV-negative person died in the 
study, which illustrates the extent to which chronically 
virally infected, immune-suppressed people can approach the 
clinical picture of AIDS (see dark area Fig. 1d), without 
crossing into the permanent and deadly immune failure which 
is characteristic only of people with HIV infection.
<P>   The reader who is a bit confused at this point should keep 
in mind simply that the most important thing about the 
syndrome of AIDS is that it inevitably and rapidly destroys 
the immune system and kills people. Thus, mild CD4+ 
depression and opportunistic infections are not always AIDS, 
for only some of these people (as it turns out, the HIV+ 
ones) will progress to immune failure. It is immune failure 
(almost complete sustained CD4+ lymphocyte loss) and death by 
opportunistic infection which is characteristic of AIDS; and 
it is only these people who are always HIV infected.

<A NAME = "govt">
<H3>Did the Government Create AIDS?</H3>
</A>

At the African-American Summit speech in New Orleans in 1989, 
Louis Farrakhan told his audience: "The spread of 
international AIDS was an attempt by the U.S. government to 
decimate the population of central Africa." Last year he told 
Barbara Walters on ABC's 20/20: "Do you know where the AIDS 
virus was developed? Right outside of Washington. It is my 
feeling that the U.S. government is deliberately spreading 
AIDS." Such paranoid and conspiratorial thinking is not 
uncommon in history whenever a new and devestating plague 
destroys a community, as when the Jews were blamed for the 
Black Death in the 14th century. But this is not the form of 
AIDS skepticism which I am addressing in this essay, and 
needless to say there is not a shred of evidence for such an 
outrageous claim.17 
<P>   But what if AIDS and immune failure are not really new--
perhaps we just look harder for them now that we recognize 
them? Could our new theories be warping our views so 
completely that by now that we have made a new "plague" out 
of something that was here all the time? Epidemiologically, 
what can we fairly say about the period before 1980, keeping 
this possible bias in mind?
<P>   With the new ability to test old preserved tissue 
specimens for HIV, the first thing that becomes apparent is 
that AIDS is indeed older than 1981--perhaps far older. 
Deaths from what has since been recognized as HIV infection 
with immune failure have been seen clinically, without being 
understood, for at least 35 years, and probably much longer. 
An HIV-infected British sailor, who had traveled widely, is 
known to have died with severe immune deficiency and HIV 
infection in 1959, the earliest proven case of modern AIDS. 
The diagnosis was made by means of preserved autopsy tissue 
specimen HIV testing, 30 years after the fact.17
<P>   This man's death alone provides good evidence that HIV is 
not a product of deliberate (government or otherwise) genetic 
engineering, for in 1959 biologic science was simply too 
unsophisticated to work with lymphotropic (lymphocyte-
infecting) retroviruses like HIV, let alone engineer them.103 
If it is anything at all, HIV is an accidental infection of 
humans with an African primate virus. The genetic material of 
the most common HIV-1 strain is most similar to that of a 
virus known to naturally infect chimpanzees, and it may be 
that HIV's ancestors have been present in Africa, perhaps 
even in humans, for a very long time--perhaps thousands of 
years.18,121 In West Africa, a close cousin of the U.S. HIV-1 
strain, called HIV-2, is almost identical to several 
indigenous African monkey viruses, and almost certainly has 
been derived from them quite recently in virus evolutionary 
time (less than several centuries).

<A NAME = "origins">
<H3>The Origins of AIDS</H3>
</A>

The story of the detective hunt for the cause of AIDS is told 
with wit and clarity by Randy Shilts in the best-selling book 
<EM>And the Band Played On</EM>. (In 1994, Shilts, at the age of 42, 
became a casualty of the disease himself.) Other good 
histories of the early AIDS epidemic are also available.14
<P>   In the U.S., the first AIDS or AIDS-like death that we 
know for sure was also associated with HIV infection was that 
of a 17 year-old possibly homosexual male, who died of 
strange opportunistic infections in 1968, and whose preserved 
tissues also proved to be harboring HIV genetic material on 
testing decades later.19 This early AIDS-sufferer had never 
been out of the country, showing that the virus was already 
active in the Western Hemisphere in 1968. In corroboration, a 
4% fraction of preserved serum samples from IV drug users in 
this era (1971-2) in the U.S. have been found to be HIV-
positive. Apparently HIV viral infection has been present in 
small contingents of both drug users and homosexual men for 
some time in the United States.20
<P>   Why, then, was the U.S. first hit with an AIDS epidemic 
only in the 1980s, with HIV infection quickly rising to 50% 
in some risk-groups? The answer may be that it was not the 
simple presence of HIV virus in the United States that 
changed; rather it was the social milieu.
<P>   In the late 1960s drug use became far more widespread in 
the U.S., and the invention of the disposable plastic 
injection syringe about 1970 made IV drug abuse possible for 
the first time on a large scale. Also beginning around 1969 
(the date of the New York City "Stonewall" riots), 
homosexuals in the U.S. began to take open political power, 
and concomitantly one faction of male homosexuals began to 
engage in the high-infection risk "bathhouse lifestyle" 
chronicled by Shilts. In addition, the American homosexual-
male community was apparently many times re-infected by many 
world-traveling disease "vectors" from other countries in the 
1970s, including an airline steward named Dugas (described in 
Shilts as the C.D.C. "patient zero") who traveled widely in 
Europe, Canada, and the U.S., died of AIDS, and is known to 
have had sex with no less than 40 of the first 248 Americans 
to be diagnosed with AIDS by April, 1982.14 
<P>   What happened in the late 1970s in the U.S. is that when a 
large enough fraction of the American homosexual-male 
population became infected with HIV, the U.S. blood supply, 
maintained with volunteer donations only, finally became 
contaminated with the virus. (This started in 1978, as we 
know from later testing of archived serum samples taken from 
homosexual men originally for hepatitis B studies). Similar 
archived samples tell us that in 1978 the U.S. plasma supply 
used to make clotting factor for hemophilia treatment became 
HIV contaminated, no doubt primarily by IV drug users selling 
plasma to support a drug habit. The dates are not 
coincidental--crossover between initial HIV infected groups 
occurred as some homosexual men experimented with IV drugs in 
the late 1970s, and male IV drug users in large cities turned 
to homosexual prostitution in order to obtain drugs. The 
resulting new epidemic of transfusion and hemophilia-
associated AIDS, beginning in 1982 and rising sharply in 
1984, helped to bring the acquired nature of AIDS into focus.
<P>   The small incidence of AIDS in the American homosexual-
male and IV drug-user communities before the late 1970s in no 
way subtracts from the reality of the dramatic increase in 
AIDS which took place in the early 1980s on the heels of 
exploding HIV infection rates in these groups. Although 
relatively mild immune suppression has apparently always been 
widespread in many AIDS risk groups, the more complete and 
devastating immune failure characteristic of AIDS itself has 
been sporadic and rare in young cancer-free people in any of 
these groups, until the 1980s.
<P>   It is, to be sure, difficult to retrospectively evaluate 
the health of male homosexuals before the first prospective 
studies of gay men's health were done in the 1980's AIDS era, 
but we can be reasonably sure that an epidemic of deadly 
immune failure among young American men before 1980 would 
have been duly noted by epidemiologists. AIDS skeptic Root-
Bernstein documents a few cases of unexplained opportunistic 
infection deaths from the medical literature before 1980, but 
clearly an epidemic of immunosuppressive deaths cannot be 
seen in the historical record before 1980 by any act of 
imagination.
<P>   By contrast, at present AIDS shows a high and rapidly 
rising incidence among young men and women in the U.S., and 
these deaths cannot be simply a new label for an old problem. 
The reason is that total mortality and cumulated years of 
life lost to premature death in young persons are observed to 
be rising rapidly, with all of the change due to AIDS deaths, 
at the same time other leading categories of mortality remain 
stable. If mere re-labeling of deaths into different 
categories was a problem, these "newly recognized" AIDS 
deaths would come out of other previously defined mortality 
categories, and this clearly is not happening.21 AIDS, the 
disease, may be old; but AIDS, the epidemic, is indeed 
something new.
<P>   People with hemophilia, unlike homosexual men, represent a 
well-defined group with long-term documentable changes in 
morbidity and mortality, since they had been well-studied as 
a group before the era of AIDS. This research shows that 
people with hemophilia began to die of dramatically different 
things, starting about 1982 (Fig 2).22 A recent check shows 
little evidence of a special incidence of opportunistic 
diseases in people with hemophilia in the U.S. from the turn 
of the century up to 1979, although a low incidence of AIDS 
could not be ruled out in this study, mostly because some 
cases of fatal pneumonia had no identified infecting 
organism,23 and because people with hemophilia as a group are 
immunosuppressed enough to be somewhat more susceptible than 
normal to bacterial infections. Significantly, however, in 
the years before AIDS, people with hemophilia had never been 
noted to be particularly susceptible to the more obvious 
fungal infections, such as candida esophagitis, common to 
AIDS patients and others with low-lymphocyte type immune 
deficiency. After 1984, however, this type of AIDS-associated 
opportunistic infection and immune failure rapidly became the 
single most common cause of death in people with hemophilia 
in the U.S.24
<P>   The rise in total mortality risk in people with hemophilia 
was sudden: total mortality in this population, which had 
been stable in 1982 and 1983, suddenly increased by a factor 
of approximately 900% in the first quarter of 1984.25 Such an 
increase in raw numbers of deaths was consistent with an 
epidemic, or some new very toxic contamination of the 
clotting factor supply. It is not consistent with slower 
social changes, slower toxin or immune suppression models, 
multifactorial causation models, or the idea that people with 
hemophilia were actually at no greater risk than before 
(i.e., that again perhaps there had been some kind of "cause 
of death" re-labeling in response to AIDS hysteria).  (Fig. 
2.) Mortality figures in hemophilia patients also showed 
something else important, which was that the new deaths of 
the late 1980s, by virtue of all being judged "AIDS," 
demonstrated that most or all of them occurred in people with 
hemophilia who were HIV-positive. Since these deaths 
accounted more or less for the entire new increase in 
mortality, it could be inferred that the mortality rate for 
HIV-negative people with hemophilia did not increase much in 
the 1980s, if at all.
<P>   How significant was the increase in death rate for HIV-
positives in this group? In one Journal of the American 
Medical Association study it was found that in a cohort of 
111 people with hemophilia infected with HIV in the early 
1980s, one third had died by 1992.26 Imagine any group of 
this age (a high school class, perhaps) and imagine an 
overall 33% mortality rate in less than 10 years. Of the 
estimated 10,000 people with hemophilia to have been infected 
with HIV in the early 1980s in the United States, a quarter 
had been reported to the C.D.C. to have died of AIDS by July 
of 1993.
<P>   Such death rates were especially shocking in view of 
strides in hemophilia treatment which had been made in the 
years before. Total life expectancy in people with hemophilia 
had risen as clotting factor treatment became available 
through the 1970s, until by 1980 it was nearly normal.23 
After 1984, however, life expectancy in this group began a 
steep decline, and by the early 1990s was at a lower level 
than at any time since before World War II.24 In the 1980s, 
total mortality for hemophilia increased in all age groups 
above nine years of age, and age at death shifted markedly to 
lower ages, decreasing from 57 years of age in 1979-1981 to 
40 years of age in 1987-1989.27 (Fig. 2.)
<P>   About 50% of people with hemophilia in the U.S. had been 
HIV infected by early 1986, when screening and treatment of 
the clotting factor concentrate stopped HIV spread.28 Still, 
the long latency of the virus (as long as 15 years for 50% 
progression to AIDS in this group) caused death rates to rise 
for long after the window of new HIV infection closed.
<P>   The fact that there was a massive and silent HIV infection 
of half of the people with hemophilia in the early 1980s is 
beyond question, even for skeptics. The AIDS skeptics' quest 
to divorce this event from the epidemic of deaths by AIDS in 
this same group over the next decade has resulted in some 
remarkable and curious statements about hemophilia mortality. 
Duesberg, for instance (p. 216) quotes only older statistics 
for hemophilia patients from the pre-1986 period, before AIDS 
deaths became very large. His practice of using randomly 
reported AIDS and mortality data for people with this disease 
(which is often notoriously unreliable in the best of 
circumstances29), instead of the much more reliable cohort 
study data, also results in figures which minimize the impact 
of AIDS. Cohort data shows mortality in hemophilia patients 
to be far higher than Duesberg acknowledges.30
<P>   Duesberg has not been alone in ignoring major trends in 
hemophilia mortality in the last decade. The very misleading 
statement that people with hemophilia are living "longer than 
ever" today is one of the standards among the HIV/AIDS 
skeptic community. Root-Bernstein does no better than 
Duesberg at providing updated information in this area, 
offering one paper's 1979 pre-AIDS statistics,23 without 
update and without qualification, to represent contemporary 
life expectancy in people with hemophilia in 1993 (p. 247). 
This represents very sloppy scholarship (something which 
stands out particularly in Root-Bernstein), but the oversight 
does allow the author to skip discussion of the pronounced 
and otherwise awkward peak in life expectancy for hemophilia 
in the middle 1980s.
<P>   Duesberg, though he seems to believe that people with 
hemophilia have suffered no mortality increases in the age of 
AIDS, does suggest that people with hemophilia live longer 
than ever due to recent factor concentrate development, and 
thus live long enough to die of immunosuppression caused by 
longer treatments with clotting factor concentrate, instead 
of from hemophilia (p. 220). Although clotting factor does 
indeed appear to be mildly immunosuppressive (albeit in a 
different way than AIDS--CD4+ lymphocyte counts are not 
affected), the main problem with the hypothesis that clotting 
factor itself causes AIDS is that two studies of HIV-positive 
people with hemophilia have found that HIV infection, and not 
clotting factor use, is the critical risk for AIDS. These 
studies found that once a person is HIV-positive, risk of 
AIDS is not related to amount of clotting factor used or 
severity or type of hemophilia--effects that would have been 
expected if clotting factor carried a significant immune risk 
independent of its HIV content.31 Available statistics thus 
strongly suggest that the known association of clotting 
factor use and AIDS risk is merely due to the increased risk 
of being infected with HIV the more clotting factor has been 
consumed; once HIV infection has occurred, it does not matter 
how much clotting factor is used.109

<A NAME = "eighties">
<H3>AIDS in the 80s</H3>
</A>

Historically, what happened in the U.S. in 1981 was that in 
increasing numbers homosexual men began coming to physicians 
with very, very low CD4+ lymphocyte blood counts (but not 
lowered counts for other subtypes of lymphocytes), a 
destroyed immune system with lymphatic tissue destruction, 
opportunistic infections, and Kaposi's sarcoma. No one who 
had treated diseases in the male homosexual community could 
remember having seen anything remotely like what had began 
happening on an increasingly large scale in the early 1980s.
<P>   The year 1981 was not (in retrospect) exactly when the 
problem started, but rather when the problem first grew large 
enough in the U.S. to be brought to the attention of the 
federally-run Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta. It was 
in the Summer of 1981 that alert physicians brought to the 
attention of the C.D.C. a mini-epidemic of immunodeficiency 
and pneumonia caused by unusual organisms (a fungus called 
Pneumocystis carinii, and a virus called CMV) in homosexual 
men in Los Angeles.
<P>   Because many of the first people to contract AIDS had had 
sexual contact with each other, C.D.C. researchers thought 
they might be looking at an unknown sexually-transmitted 
infectious disease. They also toyed for a time with the idea 
that sex-stimulant-chemical use or illicit narcotic use, both 
very common among the first cases of AIDS, might be somehow 
causing immunosuppression. Perhaps sexual contact was a red 
herring--or merely a marker for a small and fairly tight-knit 
sub-community of people who shared common interests in non-
sexual activities which might be damaging their immune 
systems.
<P>   Those physicians treating infectious diseases in 
homosexual men thought not, however. Dr. Joel Weisman, one of 
the first doctors to put the AIDS puzzle together, noted that 
initially, within the male homosexual community, the disease 
seemed to follow lines of sexual contact more than it did 
drug or sex habits. Not all homosexual men were so 
promiscuous as to make contact-tracing impossible; Weisman 
observed that promiscuous men did not always contract the 
disease, but on the other hand, that even men with few sexual 
contacts were coming down with the disease if they had had 
sexual contact with the wrong person. In fact, men with 
severe immunodeficiency were eventually found to form sexual 
contact networks, of the kind that have always been seen by 
researchers using the classic epidemiologic tools for tracing 
sexually transmitted disease chains. The difference, however, 
was that for AIDS the contact networks stretched over years, 
indicating an infectious agent (if there was one) with a very 
long latency. Still, investigators found that of the first 19 
cases of AIDS reported in Los Angeles, nine had direct or 
indirect (one intermediate partner) sexual contact with a 
single French-Canadian airline steward (previously 
mentioned), a man who was also sick with immunodeficiency.
<P>   Then, starting in 1982, reports began to come into the 
C.D.C. of the same CD4+ lymphocyte and lymphatic-tissue-
destroying immune failure syndrome occurring this time in 
U.S. citizens who had received transfusions. Soon also came 
reports that an identical immune deficiency of a new severe 
variety was now being seen in men with hemophilia, a genetic 
disease in which sufferers must be injected with concentrates 
of protein clotting factors made from donated blood plasma. 
Reports of the first people with hemophilia and AIDS 
emphasized that, in these people, none of the same drug or 
male-homosexual behavioral factors were present that had been 
seen in the first group of AIDS sufferers.15 
<P>   Further, the same was true of those with "transfusion-
related AIDS," who also did not fit into drug-using or male-
homosexual lifestyles, and did not resemble them in sex or 
age either. Former tennis star Arthur Ashe is a well-known 
modern example. Ashe, like many of those with transfusion-
related AIDS, had never had an intimate connection with 
anyone else with an immune problem, except for a history of 
blood transfusions years in the past, during the time in 
which transfusions were associated with AIDS.
<P>   In late 1982 all this worried epidemiologists as the 
reports continued to come in. They knew that another viral 
disease called hepatitis B ("serum hepatitis") was also 
transmitted epidemically as a sexually transmitted disease in 
homosexual men, but much more rarely in homosexual women or 
heterosexuals in the U.S. Hepatitis B had historically also 
shown up early in people with hemophilia, who because of 
their large pooled blood-product exposure have historically 
seemed to be first to suffer from any new organism infecting 
the blood supply. Hepatitis B had also been known to be one 
of the worst disease-causing contaminants in donated blood 
for general transfusion. Thus, the same three groups of 
people who had historically been infected with a new epidemic 
of hepatitis B in the 1970s, had now started coming down with 
AIDS. Hepatitis B was also a disease of IV drug users who 
shared needles, and it was not long before the first reports 
of IV drug users with AIDS came in.
<P>   By 1983, the C.D.C. was sure it had a new infectious 
disease on its hands, similar in epidemiology to hepatitis B 
but with a longer latency period. Analysis of the habits of 
donors of the blood components that went into those people 
who had later developed AIDS, indicated one thing different 
about the donors: it was found that blood products AIDS 
patients had received had more often come from people who 
themselves were at "high-risk" for AIDS due to promiscuous 
male homosexual behavior. On the other hand, matched case-
controls who had been transfused identically from the same 
blood bank but had not developed AIDS after transfusion, were 
found to be not nearly as likely to have gotten blood 
components from anyone in a "high-risk group."
<P>   This initial study concluded that there was only a 1% 
chance that the statistical association of transfusion-
associated AIDS with the lifestyle of the blood-donor would 
be as close as it was found to be, if only chance had 
determined the lifestyles of the donors of blood to people 
who later became sick. Such a chance association would have 
been expected if there was no contamination, and instead 
there was something about normal transfusion blood itself, or 
perhaps some other factor unrelated to transfusion, that was 
causing AIDS in transfusion recipients.16 The remarkable 
fact--from which there was no escape--was that AIDS in a 
transfusion recipient predicted the lifestyle of a blood-
donor he or she had never met (a donor which generally turned 
out to be a promiscuous homosexual man who had thought 
himself to be perfectly healthy). Nothing but an infectious 
agent could explain a statistical connection between a blood 
donor's sexual habits, and risk to the person receiving the 
blood. As for drugs or immune toxins, it was impossible to 
believe that any chemical toxin could be present in a 
relatively small amount of blood component coming from a 
single nominally healthy person, in sufficient quantities to 
cause total immune failure in the recipient, and do it years 
after the transfusion.
<P>   Eventually, with many cases like Arthur Ashe's on record 
(but showing up in the early 1980s, earlier than Ashe's did), 
AIDS looked epidemiologically very much like hepatitis B. The 
hunt was on for the microbe, or microbes, which caused the 
new syndrome. When the virus now known as HIV finally hit the 
world news in the Spring of 1984, there was a great deal of 
skepticism in the scientific and lay communities alike. With 
the ability to test for antibodies to HIV in 1985, however, 
there came a way of powerfully sifting through putative 
causal factors for AIDS, and comparing them with the factor 
of past HIV infection. HIV infection has emerged from these 
tests as the clear champion of competing AIDS-causation 
theories, convincing at present all but the most die-hard 
skeptics.14

<A NAME = "straw">
<H3>Attacks on Straw Men</H3>
</A>

It is an unfortunate fact that a great deal of the debate 
over AIDS and HIV has been over what rhetoricians call "straw 
men." A straw man is an argument or viewpoint set up in a 
debate only for the purpose of being knocked down, and one 
which the opposite side never really defended or held; or one 
which is not very important to the central issue of the 
debate, even if it has been held. Straw man arguments often 
result from debaters talking "past each other," without 
understanding the opposing side's position. In the HIV/AIDS 
debate, straw men set up by heretics have most often been 
medical hypotheses which have previously been put forth in 
the context of the HIV theory and which have turned out to be 
wrong, but which were never important corollaries necessarily 
deduced from the idea that HIV causes AIDS. Other straw men 
are ideas that the orthodox scientific "establishment" never 
put forth seriously at all, though they may be attacked 
vigorously by heretics as though they are current medical 
dogma. We will presently see samples of both.
<P>   An example of an epidemiologic straw man is the timing of 
HIV arrival in the Western hemisphere. Root-Bernstein 
discusses cases of possible AIDS as far back as 1932, notes 
documented HIV infection with AIDS as far back as 1968 in the 
U.S., and argues that these data are anomalous (p. 2) if the 
virus was transferred for the first time to the Western 
hemisphere around 1978, as was originally thought. And so 
they are. But if the HIV virus was transferred much earlier 
than 1978 to the new world, and remained at low levels in 
male homosexuals and injecting drug users in America until 
changing social factors in the 1970s encouraged its spread 
(exactly as Root-Bernstein himself indirectly suggests), no 
real damage would be done to a suitably modified HIV/AIDS 
theory.
<P>   An example of a bad prediction made by the orthodox 
medical establishment which is not necessarily derivative of 
the HIV theory, was (or is) the official idea that AIDS is 
due to be a heterosexual pandemic in America any time now. It 
is argued by Duesberg (p. 203), that the "viral hypothesis" 
has failed to predict the course of the AIDS epidemic--namely 
that AIDS has (at least so far) shown no clear inclination to 
spread rapidly by a complete heterosexual-sexual-transmission 
mechanism in the U.S., even though it apparently does so in 
Africa. It is also asserted in a related argument by Root-
Bernstein that the HIV/AIDS hypothesis does not explain the 
generally-low measured levels of HIV virus in semen, the low 
(but not zero) rate of HIV infection in mates of HIV-positive 
men with hemophilia, or the nearly zero rate of infection in 
U.S. heterosexual prostitutes (unless they are drug users). 
If AIDS is an infectious disease, ask the skeptics, then why 
does HIV not infect very well?
<P>   All these arguments are against straw men. There is 
nothing in the HIV/AIDS theory which demands that any 
particular transmission mechanism be the chief cause of the 
spread of HIV infection in any given place, or which demands 
that the HIV virus be as infectious in one locality as 
another. For example, it now seems likely from many studies 
that sexual transmission of HIV often requires mucosal tissue 
trauma, which is much more likely with anal intercourse, 
and/or a concomitant inflammation or ulcer from a second 
sexually transmitted disease. Because transmission may be 
inefficient even so, promiscuity also greatly enhances the 
chance of HIV spread. These requirement(s) for efficient HIV 
sexual transfer easily explain the difference between spread 
of HIV in tropical Africa vs. the developed countries. They 
also adequately explain why a disease which spreads well 
sexually only in populations with an extreme level of both 
promiscuity and rectal mucosal trauma (i.e., one sub-segment 
of American homosexual men) has not yet become a generally 
spreading sexually-transmitted disease epidemic in the U.S.
<P>   It is not that the HIV/AIDS heretics have not come across 
such explanations. Root-Bernstein, in a good discussion of 
the epidemiology of AIDS, admits that there is nothing 
especially strange about a sexually transmitted disease which 
spreads easily in homosexual males but not heterosexuals in 
the U.S. Both syphilis and hepatitis B in the 1970s have been 
examples of such a phenomenon, and the "odd" differential 
epidemiology of both diseases with regard to sexual-
preference groups is easily explained by differential 
behavior in the homosexual and heterosexual populations in 
those years.
<P>   Duesberg argues that a disease which restricts itself to 
classes of people in America, but not in Africa, cannot be 
explained by a micro-organism. But while he is doing so, 
fellow heretic Root-Bernstein (pp. 281-303) is noting that 
infectious epidemiology in one group of American homosexual 
males, who might be sexually infected with giardia, 
parasites, amoebas, hepatitis A, and B, shigella, salmonella, 
etc., may resemble far more the disease epidemiology of some 
African countries than that of heterosexuals living next door 
(p. 290). In this, an AIDS caused by an infectious agent such 
as HIV may behave just as AIDS statistics suggest it does, 
and yet merely follow a pattern already amply demonstrated 
before AIDS, with many another infectious disease. Root-
Bernstein is sometimes too competent a scholar for his own 
good. His Chapters 8 and 9--which address the epidemiologic 
differences and commonalities of U.S. homosexual men and 
African heterosexuals due to sexual practices and social 
changes which appeared newly in the 1970s and 1980s--not only 
believably explains and refutes most of Duesberg's 
epidemiologic problems with AIDS (p. 209), but also does the 
same with many of Root-Bernstein's own epidemiological 
problems, raised in Chapter 1.
<P>   Unfortunately, Root-Bernstein is willing to let lifestyle 
and habit differences explain epidemiologic differences when 
it suits his argument's needs, but much less willing to 
consider them when they don't. An illustrative example occurs 
as Root-Bernstein discusses the rectal traumas and infections 
which occur during certain male homosexual practices, writing 
of these (p. 283-4): "It is now accepted that such injuries 
and infections greatly increase the risk of concurrent 
infections (HIV or otherwise) and of semen gaining access to 
the immune system following anal intercourse."
<P>   Yet when Root-Bernstein discusses the statistical 
association of AIDS with receptive anal intercourse (p.225) 
he shows an odd difficulty with the same concept: "One 
possibility is that it is much easier to transmit HIV to a 
receptive partner than from a receptive partner. No other 
sexually transmitted disease behaves this way, however . . . 
. HIV would be the first disease agent to be able to make the 
discrimination, unless some other factor is involved."
<P>   Here, unfortunately, Root-Bernstein is wrong, and wrong 
for the very reasons that he himself discusses in the quote 
preceding the last. Much like HIV, hepatitis B infection in 
homosexual men also correlates with rectal trauma and 
receptive anal intercourse,32 and there is little reason to 
believe that the "other factor" is anything other than the 
fairly straightforward mechanical injury that Root-Bernstein 
has already helpfully identified for us (see reference 33 for 
statistical development of a "rectal trauma index" which 
partly predicts risk of HIV infection). It is a 
characteristic of Root-Bernstein's style of argument that it 
makes causal mechanisms as mysteriously complicated as 
possible--very often far more complicated than required to 
explain the facts.
<P>   Root-Bernstein, eager to draw attention to any factor 
other than HIV in the causation of AIDS, does not take into 
account the most obvious physical factors: "what is clear 
from existing studies," he asserts (p. 45), "is that HIV is 
extremely difficult to transfer to a healthy individual." In 
fact, existing studies establish no such thing. Studies 
quoted by Root-Bernstein never demonstrate that only 
"unhealthy" people in known risk groups contract HIV, only 
that certain traumatized risk groups (promiscuous gay men, 
hemophiliacs, transfusion recipients) are on average somewhat 
unhealthy to begin with. This, of course, is not the same 
thing. Indeed, there is evidence that within risk groups, 
even the healthiest of individuals (immunologically) are 
capable of contracting HIV. Although men with hemophilia and 
homosexual men are on average mildly immunosuppressed even in 
the absence of HIV, it is by no means true that all are. A 
study of army recruits (surely a carefully screened group for 
health) shows that those who seroconvert to HIV 
(demonstrating new HIV infection) may initially (by the 
criterion of CD4+ count) have immunity which is in the normal 
range. This is true in other groups as well.34
<P>   Perhaps the most bloated straw man assailed by Root-
Bernstein (and the one that provides the major theme of his 
book) is the idea that the causal agent of an infectious 
disease such as AIDS must be both necessary and sufficient to 
cause the disease in every sense of the terms; and moveover 
that since Dept. of Health and Human Services Secretary 
Margaret Heckler's dramatic announcement in 1984, most 
scientists have considered HIV to play this very role for 
AIDS. Root-Bernstein spends much time attacking what he calls 
the "HIV-only" theory of AIDS, an idea which actually has 
never flown, except possibly in the popular press or the 
occasional scientist who expresses a rash opinion (Dr. Robert 
Gallo, official co-discoverer of HIV, must by now badly 
regret his hyperbole about HIV being able to cause AIDS in 
Clark Kent35). The subtitle warning of Root-Bernstein's book 
is The Tragic Cost of Premature Consensus, and it appears 
from the book that it is upon the "HIV-only" theory of AIDS 
that the "premature consensus" of the establishment is in 
dire danger of settling, if it has not already.
<P>   Fortunately, it can safely be said that no such thing is 
occurring in the biomedical consensus, or about to. This does 
not prevent Root-Bernstein (p. 331) from logically blasting 
the somewhat cartoonish view he attributes to medical 
science: "Two of the most important implications of the HIV-
only theory of AIDS are that all the risk groups should 
develop AIDS at approximately the same rate following HIV 
infection and that the symptoms they manifest should, on the 
whole, be the same."
<P>   Alas for Root-Bernstein, however, since AIDS has from the 
beginning involved opportunistic infection organisms which 
vary in prevalence among populations, and since there has 
been reason to believe from the first that AIDS risk varies 
greatly with the biological age of the HIV-infected person, 
scientists have never, even at the beginning, seriously 
considered such a theory as Root-Bernstein here lays out:
One logical implication is that the immunological status of 
an infected person should be irrelevant to susceptibility to 
contagion or to the progression from infection to disease. 
Acquisition of the retrovirus should be the sole factor 
determining whether an individual develops AIDS. Everyone 
should be at equal risk for AIDS, just as everyone is at 
equal risk for hepatitis B virus, syphilis, or measles.
<P>   The most troubling thing about such writing is that an 
unwary lay reader may leave Root-Bernstein's book with the 
impression that the author has single-handedly discovered 
that infectious disease risks depend partly on host immune 
defenses and host behaviors and environments. The reader 
might well decide further that the biomedical community today 
does not in general think in terms of individuals having 
differing resistances to various diseases, and is accepting 
such advanced ideas only under duress, due to political 
pressures resulting from the penetrating logic of popular 
writers such as Root-Bernstein, who are "re-thinking AIDS."
<P>   The facts are more mundane. Obviously, since no microbe 
infects 100% of people exposed to it, or even causes disease 
in 100% of the people it infects (not even HIV has been shown 
to do this), there must be other factors to explain why some 
exposed people become ill with ANY infectious agent (viral, 
bacterial or parasitic), and some do not. Medical science 
certainly recognizes such factors, but does not use them to 
argue that there is in general something badly wrong with the 
germ theory of disease. Instead, as discussed earlier, 
medical scientists regard "causality" in infectious disease 
in merely the sense of "necessity" (i.e., the "causal" 
microbe is necessary, but not sufficient). Medicine has not 
regarded the pathogenesis of any natural infection in terms 
of a "germ only" theory such as Root-Bernstein describes, 
since Pasteur, referring to disease, said: "The seed is 
nothing, and the soil is everything." Thus, Root-Bernstein 
spends many chapters assailing an idea that physicians have 
not held since the late 19th century, and certainly have 
never generally held in the case of AIDS.
<P>   No infectious agent is usually "sufficient" to cause 
disease in a natural host, although in a laboratory (or 
perhaps very occasionally in nature) it may be sometimes true 
that the dose may be so high as to make host resistance 
almost irrelevant. Naturally-occurring infectious disease 
organisms at reasonable doses, however, always rely on a 
chink of some kind in host immunity with regard to that 
particular microbe (this is not to say that we must consider 
any host that is successfully infected to be 
"immunocompromised"--that would cheapen and overly broaden 
this useful term). The idea that deficiencies in host defense 
in some sense "permit" all or most infections is indeed a 
standard medical teaching,36 although a lay reader of Root-
Bernstein might be surprised to learn of it after Root-
Bernstein finishes misrepresenting the standard views of 
modern medicine.
<P>   "Why is there such a huge and medically unprecedented 
variation in time between HIV infection and death from AIDS?" 
asks Root-Bernstein (p. 89). The answer to this rhetorical 
question is that such variation is not medically 
unprecedented. Other infectious diseases, from malaria to 
syphilis to tuberculosis to viral hepatitis, may kill years 
after initial infection--or within a much shorter time. In a 
cohort of newly-infected people, any study of a chronic 
infectious disease cannot help but produce steady increases 
in the "average" time between infection and death, as deaths 
accumulate slowly while the study follows the infected cohort 
prospectively onward in time.
<P>   "No theory based solely on HIV can explain the phenomenon 
of variable times of death," writes Root-Bernstein (p. 89). 
This is correct so far as it goes, but it says much less than 
it seems to, for this much is true of every infectious 
disease known, including other infectious diseases which may 
have latency times to death fully as long as those for HIV. 
Too much of Root-Bernstein's Rethinking AIDS consists of 
arguments that the HIV hypothesis needs to be re-thought 
because HIV infection supposedly has strange properties--
properties which on close examination turn out to be broadly 
similar to those of many other infectious diseases.

<H2>SIDEBAR: What Is a Retrovirus?</H2>
</A>

A retrovirus is a virus which has its genetic structure 
encoded into RNA, but which reproduces by turning it back 
into DNA during an infection. Once inside a living cell, 
retroviruses are able to synthesize virus DNA-copy molecules 
using the virus's RNA genetic molecules as a template, or 
"master" (this process proceeds retrograde to the normal 
"DNA-->RNA" information flow in cells, hence the name). To do 
this job a unique enzyme molecule called "reverse 
transcriptase" is used by the virus. Since this enzyme is not 
found in normal cells the virus itself must carry it. This 
enzyme and the process it catalyzes are so unusual in biology 
that H. Temin and D. Baltimore were awarded the 1975 Nobel 
Prize in Medicine for discovering it. 
<P>   Once the DNA-copy of a retrovirus (called a pro-virus) is 
made, it is often inserted into the DNA of the cell being 
infected. Now an actual part of the genetic code of the cell, 
the retrovirus genetic information is hidden from the immune 
system, which would otherwise destroy the virus inside the 
cell, or destroy the entire cell. All humans harbor some 
foreign retroviral DNA actually integrated or inserted into 
the DNA in most of their body cells. In this sense, we all 
share some of the fate of the scientist in the remake of the 
movie The Fly, a matter-transporter victim whose DNA is not 
pure and not entirely human, but who cannot do anything about 
it because there are no "tweezers" fine enough, or 
discriminating enough, for the job. Some of the foreign DNA 
in each of our cells is from retroviruses which went into 
hiding eons ago in our ancestors, and are now reproduced 
automatically along with our normal cells, and have long 
since "forgotten" how to get themselves back out of our DNA.

<A NAME = "hivpos">
<H2>SIDEBAR: What Does "HIV-Positive" Mean?</H2>
</A>

Antibodies are blood proteins made by immune cells, which 
stick very specifically to microbial invaders, targeting them 
for destruction by the immune system. For many years after an 
infection by a microbe, antibodies specific to that microbe 
can be detected in the blood. A person who tests positive for 
antibodies to HIV by two different kinds of lab tests, is 
said to be "HIV-positive."
<P>   In the case of infection with the average microbe, a 
person may test antibody positive for years or even a 
lifetime after the microbe is completely gone from the body. 
For the chronic viruses which hide in cell nuclei, however 
(retroviruses like HIV; and also CMV, EBV, and other herpes-
class viruses), the presence of antibody is generally a clue 
to the continued presence of the virus, active or inactive, 
somewhere in the body. In some cases modern sensitive tests 
for viral DNA can actually detect these hidden viruses 
directly.
<P>   Over the years since the discovery of HIV, critics of the 
HIV/AIDS hypothesis have had to struggle to keep up with 
sensitivity increases in HIV testing. Initially, critics 
complained that HIV virus was not present in most HIV-
positive people. When it became clear that infectious virus 
could be found in almost 100% of such people (if cultures 
were done correctly) critics claimed that most HIV was 
dormant until reactivated in culture. With new sensitive 
tests for HIV RNA showing that HIV virus is active in the 
body's lymph nodes, critics have fallen back to the position 
that it may be active, but not active enough. This is a 
question which can only be answered indirectly, by other 
studies. Ellison and Duesberg assert (p. 124) that HIV is 
rarely to be found budding from cells in patients, and that 
"...in most individuals with AIDS, no virus particles can be 
found anywhere in the body," implying that this absolves the 
virus from any disease role. Actually, however, even actively 
reproducing HIV may spend very little of its total life-cycle 
budding through a cell membrane or floating free as a 
particle in the blood before being picked up by another cell. 
Studies of viral RNA in the body show that there may be 
anywhere from roughly 10 million, to as much as one billion 
particles or actively replicating HIV genomes in a gram of 
lymph tissue--a significant amount by the standards of most 
other kinds of virus.122

bites, there is no doubt survival advantage to the FIV virus, as with 
rabies, in making infected cats unusually aggressive. Perhaps this 
brain-modifying protein once served a similar purpose in lower primates 
as in cats, changing behavior in subtle ways to encourage lentivirus 
spread.

<DT>101. No slow-toxin hypothesis like Duesberg's explains the initial 
C.D.C. data from 1981-1984, which show incidence of total new AIDS cases 
rising in the typical exponential fashion of a new infectious disease 
spreading in a susceptible population (Farr's law). Duesberg (p. 252) 
states that this exponential rise is probably due to an exponential rise 
in AIDS testing, overlooking the fact that the mathematical relationship 
held for these four years before the HIV test was available. The <EM>early</EM> 
departure from exponential growth for HIV infection, apparent in the 
last few years, is also in accordance with Farr's law if the simple 
assumption is made that the effectively <EM>susceptible</EM> population is 
smaller than was first assumed, and does not include most heterosexuals. 
<DT>102. AIDS 7:231 -239, 1993; also see AIDS 8:803-810, 1994. From these 
papers and others it is apparent that yearly risk of progressing to AIDS 
is far from constant for either persons or populations. Instead, risk in 
a population rises almost linearly from the date of infection for at 
least seven years, toward peaks of as much as 7% per year. This does not 
prevent Duesberg from routinely treating AIDS risk rates in populations 
as constant. 
<DT>103. The necessary technology to grow the HIV virus in culture and thus 
identify it, preceded the main onset of the AIDS epidemic by only 5 
years, so in this sense things might have been much, much worse. HIV, 
dispite many attempts, could not be grown in the lab until 1983. Genetic 
engineering of viruses also dates only from the 1970s. 
<DT>104. According to the Bayesian analysis of scientific induction, it is 
necessary to first have some a priori idea of the likelihood of the 
truth of a proposition, before one can properly evaluate the helpfulness 
of new evidence which supports it.

<H1>What is a Skeptic?</H1>

What does it mean to be skeptical, or a skeptic? Some people believe that
skepticism is denial or rejection of new ideas, or worse, they confuse
"skeptic" with "cynic" and think that skeptics are a bunch of grumpy
curmudgeons unwilling to accept any claim that challenges the status quo.
Nothing could be further from the truth. Skepticism is a provisional approach
to claims. It is the application of science to any and all ideas-no sacred
cows allowed. In other words, skepticism is a method, not a position. Ideally
skeptics do not go into an investigation closed to the possibility that a
phenomenon might be real or that a claimant might be right. When we say we
are "skeptical" we mean that we must see evidence before we believe. Skeptics
are from Missouri-the "show me" state.
<P>Skepticism has a long historical tradition dating back to ancient Greece when
Socrates observed: "All I know is that I know nothing." But this position is
sterile and unproductive and held by virtually no one. If you are skeptical
about everything, you would have to be skeptical of your own skepticism. Like
the decaying sub-atomic particle, pure skepticism uncoils and spins off the
viewing screen of our intellectual cloud chamber. 
<P>Modern skepticism is embodied in the scientific method, which gathers data to
formulate and test naturalistic explanations for natural phenomena, and where
a claim becomes factual when it is confirmed to such an extent it would be
reasonable to offer temporary agreement. But all facts in science are
provisional and subject to change, and therefore skepticism is a method
leading to provisional conclusions. Some claims, such as water dowsing, ESP,
and creationism, have been tested (and failed the tests) often enough that we
can provisionally conclude that they are not valid. Other claims, such as
hypnosis, the origins of language, and black holes, have been tested but
results are inconclusive so we must continue formulating and testing
hypotheses and theories until we can reach a provisional conclusion. 
<P>The key to science and skepticism is to continuously and vigorously apply the
scientific method to help navigate through the treacherous straights between
pure Socratic "know nothing" skepticism, and unmitigated "anything goes"
credulity. Over three centuries ago the French philosopher and skeptic Rene
Descartes, after one of the most thorough skeptical purges in intellectual
history, concluded that he knew one thing for certain: Cogito ergo sum-I
think therefore I am. But evolution may have designed us in the other
direction. Humans evolved to be pattern-seeking, causal-inferring animals,
shaped by nature to find meaningful relationships in the world. Those who
were best at doing this left behind the most offspring. We are their
descendents. In other words, to be human is to think. To paraphrase
Descartes:
Sum Ergo Cogito-I Am Therefore I Think.

<H1>HOMEOPATHY:
A POSITION STATEMENT BY THE NATIONAL COUNCIL AGAINST HEALTH FRAUD</H1>
<H2><A HREF = "03.1.about-jarvis.html">Edited by William Jarvis</A></H2>

Homeopathy was devised by the German physician Samuel Hahnemann (1755-1843)
as a reaction to practices based upon the ancient humoral theory which he
labeled "allopathy." The term has been misapplied to regular medicine ever
since. The cardinal principles of homeopathy include that (1) most diseases
are caused by an infectious disorder called the psora; (2) life is a
spiritual force (vitalism) which directs the body's healing; (3) remedies can
be discerned by noting the symptoms that substances produce in overdose
(proving), and applying them to conditions with similar symptoms in highly
diluted doses (Law of Similia); (4) remedies become more effective with
greater dilution (Law of Infinitesimals), and become more dilute when
containers are tapped on the heel of the hand or a leather pad (potentizing).
Homeopathy's principles have been refuted by the basic sciences of chemistry,
physics, pharmacology, and pathology. Homeopathy meets the dictionary
definitions of a <EM>sect</EM> and a <EM>cult</EM>--the characteristics of which prevent
advances that would change Hahnemann's original principles. Most homeopathic
studies are of poor methodological quality, and are subject to bias.
Homeopathic product labels do not provide sufficient information to judge
their dosages. Although homeopathic remedies are generally thought to be
nontoxic due to their high dilutions, some preparations have proved harmful.
The ostensible value of homeopathic products can be more than a placebo
effect because some products have contained effective amounts of standard
medications or have been adulterated. Only about half of the 300 homeopaths
listed in the Directory of the National Center for Homeopathy are physicians.
Others include naturopaths, chiropractors, acupuncturists, dentists,
veterinarians, nurses or physician assistants. Homeopathy's appeal lies in
its personal attention to patients. Homeopathy is a magnet for untrustworthy
practitioners who pose a threat to public safety. A perverse belief in the
"healing crisis" causes practitioners to ignore adverse reactions, or to
value them as "toxins being expelled." The marketing of homeopathic products
and services fits the definition of quackery established by a United States
House of Representatives committee which investigated the problem (i.e., the
promotion of "medical schemes or remedies known to be false, or which are
unproven, for a profit"). The United States Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act
lists the <EM>Homeopathic Pharmacopeia of the United States</EM> as a recognized
compendium, but this status was due to political influence, not scientific
merit. The FDA has not required homeopathic products to meet the efficacy
requirements applied to all other drugs, creating an unacceptable double
standard for drug marketing. The Federal Trade Commission has not taken
action against homeopathic product advertising although it clearly does not
meet the standards of truthful advertising generally applied to drugs. Postal
authorities have not prosecuted mail-order product promoters that make
unproven claims for mail fraud. Three states have established homeopathic
licensing boards. Some of these have been administered by medical mavericks
with a history of difficulties with former medical licensing boards. 

<H3>Recommendations</H3>

The NCAHF advises consumers not to buy homeopathic products or to patronize
homeopathic practitioners. Basic scientists are urged to be proactive in
opposing the marketing of homeopathic remedies because of conflicts with
known physical laws. Those who study homeopathic remedies are warned to
beware of deceptive practices in addition to applying sound research
methodologies. State and federal regulatory agencies are urged to require
homeopathic products to meet the same standards as regular drugs, and to take
strong enforcement actions against violators, including the discipline of
health professionals who practice homeopathy. States are urged to abolish
homeopathic licensing boards. 


<H3>Origin</H3>

Homeopathy (derived from the Greek words <EM>homoios</EM> "similar" and <EM>pathos</EM> "suffering")
is a sectarian healing system devised by Samuel Hahnemann (1755-1843), a
German physician who rejected the harsh medical practices of his era which
included bleeding, purging, vomiting and the administration of highly toxic
drugs. Practices of the era were based on the ancient Greek <EM>humoral theory</EM>
which attributed disease to an imbalance of four humors (blood, phlegm, and
black and yellow bile) and four bodily conditions (hot, cold, wet, and dry)
that corresponded to four elements (earth, air, fire, and water). Physicians
attempted to balance the humors by treating symptoms with "opposites." For
instance, fever (hot) was believed to be due to excess blood because patients
were flushed; therefore, balance was sought by blood-letting in order to
"cool" the patient. Hahnemann dubbed such practices "allopathy" (<EM>allos</EM>
"opposite," <EM>pathos</EM> "suffering"), and sought to replace it with his "Law of
Similia" that treated "like with like." Although medicine never accepted the
label of allopathy, homeopaths continue to misrepresent physicians as
allopaths to make their differences appear based upon conflicting ideologies
rather than scientific pragmatism. Medical writers often refer to medical
doctors as "allopaths" but their use of the term reflects an alternate
definition of allopathy as "a system of medical practice making use of all
measures <EM>proved of value</EM> (emphasis ours) in treatment of disease" (<EM>Webster's
New Collegiate Dictionary</EM>). This definition is inconsistent with its root
words "allos" and "pathos." Its duplicity aids those who wish to misrepresent
medicine as ideologically allopathic (i.e., symptom suppression).


<H2>The Cardinal Principles of Homeopathy</H2>

<H3>The Psora and Vitalism</H3>

Hahnemann believed that 7/8ths of all diseases are due to an infectious
disorder called the <EM>Psora</EM> (itch). In the words of Hahnemann's "Organon":
This Psora is the sole true and fundamental cause that produces all the other
countless forms of disease, which, under the names of nervous debility,
hysteria, hypochondriasis, insanity, melancholy, idiocy, madness, epilepsy,
and spasms of all kinds, softening of the bones, or rickets, scoliosis and
chophouses, caries, cancer, fungus haematodes, gout-asthma and suppuration of
the lungs, megrim, deafness, cataract and amaurosis, paralysis, toss of
sense, pains of every kind, etc., appear in our pathology as so many
peculiar, distinct, and independent diseases (Stalker, 1985).
<P>   Hahnemann believed that diseases represent a disturbance in the body's
ability to heal itself and that only a small stimulus is needed to begin the
healing process. He owed this to his faith in <EM>vitalism</EM>, which holds that life
is a spiritual, nonmaterial process and that the body contains an innate
wisdom that is its own healing force. A British homeopath explained its
vitalism (Twentyman, 1982):
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Hahnemann...is...a child of the modern age of natural science, an adept in
the chemistry of his day... But he can still hold a conviction that an
immaterial vital entity animates our organism until death when the purely
chemical forces prevail and decompose it....This vital entity which he
characterizes as immaterial, spirit-like, and which maintains in health the
harmonious wholeness of the organism, is in fact the wholeness of it, can be
influenced by dynamic causes. How does Hahnemann attempt to clarify the idea?
He draws attention to phenomena like magnetic influences, the moon and the
tides, infective illnesses and perhaps most importantly the influence of
emotions and impulses of will on the organism (pp. 221-225).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>   Vitalism appeals to so-called "Holistic" or "New Age" medicine devotees,
who prefer a metaphysical view of life processes, and readily accept
homeopathy despite its scientific deficiencies.

<H3>Provings and the Law of Similia</H3>

Hahnemann's invention of homeopathy is reported to have originated with an
experience in which he ingested a substantial dose of cinchona bark (the
source of quinine) used to treat malaria. He noted that the symptoms he
experienced were similar to those of malaria. He reasoned that since the
remedy produced symptoms in overdose similar to the condition it was used to
treat, this principle, his Law of Similia, could be used to discern the value
of various medicines. He called this process <EM>proving</EM> a medicine. Promoters
often misrepresent homeopathy as treating the "causes" rather than merely the
"symptoms" of disease, but its reliance on the "proving" of remedies shows
that homeopathy itself relies solely upon a symptom treatment.
<P>   Hahnemann's Law of Similia utilized the primitive view of <EM>monism</EM> that
"nature is a unitary, organic whole with no independent parts" (<EM>Webster's</EM>)
with inherent principles that <EM>like is like</EM>, <EM>like makes like</EM>, and <EM>like cures
like</EM>. Monism is the basis of many ancient practices (e.g., eating the heart
of a lion for courage), and holds that if one object resembles another they
are alike in essence (<EM>like is like</EM>); idolatry in which carving a likeness of
a god actually produces the god (<EM>like makes like</EM>); and folk medicine
practices such as snakeroot being good for snakebite, because of their
resemblance (<EM>like cures like</EM>). Hahnemann revived Paracelsus' Doctrine of
Signatures, which declared that herbs would cure conditions or anatomical
parts they resembled (Garrison, 1929, p. 206). The homeopathic Law of
Similia, however, is unsupported by the basic sciences of physiology,
pharmacology and pathology.

<H3>Law of Infinitesimal "Potentizing"</H3>

Hahnemann's <EM>Law of Infinitesimals</EM> holds that the smaller the dose of a
medication, the more powerful will be its healing effects. He taught that
substances could be <EM>potentized</EM> (i.e., their "immaterial and spiritual powers"
released to make active substances more active, and inactive substances
active). The process of potentizing involved the sequential dilution of
remedial agents by <EM>succussion</EM> in which initial mixtures would be shaken at
least 40 times, nine parts dumped, and nine parts of solvent added and shaken
again. This process was repeated as many times as desired. Tapping on a
leather pad or the heel of the hand was alleged to double the dilution-a
notion that contradicts the laws of physics. Remedies are diluted to powers
of ten and labeled with combinations of Arabic and Roman numerals (e.g., 3X=
1/1000, 4X= 1/10,000, 3C or 6X= 1/1,000,000, etc.). The fact that
19th-Century homeopathic remedies were dilute placebos made them preferable
to the harsh concoctions being applied by the humoral practitioners.
<P>   According to the laws of chemistry, there is a limit to the dilution that
can be made without losing the original substance altogether. This limit,
called Avogadro's number (6.023 x 10-23) corresponds to homeopathic potencies
of 12C or 24X (1 part in 1024). At this dilution there is less than a 50%
chance that even one molecule of active material remains. Hahnemann himself
realized that there was virtually no chance that any of the original
substance remained at such high dilution, but explained it away in
metaphysical terms. In addition to being contradicted by common sense,
homeopathy's Law of Infinitesimals is invalidated by pharmaceutical
dose-response studies.
<P>   Promoters claim that immunization and allergy desensitization verify
homeopathy because they treat like with like, but neither meets the
additional requirements of homeopathic theory and practice. Immunizations do
not alleviate symptoms or cure. Neither immunization nor allergy
desensitization grows stronger with dilution, nor can they be "potentized."
Classical homeopaths proclaim that eating for relief of indigestion proved
that like cures like, i.e., the Law of Similia. However, one does not obtain
relief from indigestion by eating "potentized microdilutions" of the <EM>same</EM>
food that was originally ingested. Other attempts to validate homeopathy such
as the folksy value of "some of the hair of the dog that bit you" to relieve
a hangover also fail to withstand close scrutiny.



<H2>Homeopathy and Science</H2>

Scientific medicine encompasses a collection of procedures, each of which
must stand on its own as safe and effective for a specific purpose. History
recounts examples of ancient healers doing the right thing for the wrong
reason. Some bored holes in skulls (trephining) in order to liberate angry
demons thought to be causing head pain, and in the process relieved
intracranial pressure. This, however, does not validate the Demonic Theory.
Also, foul-smelling swamps were drained on the basis of the miasmic theory,
which taught that foul-smelling emanations from the Earth caused "bad air
fever" (mal-air-ia). Further, Asclepian priests scraped spear shavings into
the spear-wounds of warriors believing that the weapon that caused a wound
would help in its healing (like-cures-like). Copper sulfate from the bronze
spearheads may have inhibited infection. Just as doing these right practices
for the wrong reasons did not validate the faulty theories upon which they
were based, neither will the success of a "homeopathic" remedy
comprehensively validate homeopathy's theory, pharmacology, and metaphysics.
<P>   Homeopathy clearly fits Webster's dictionary definitions of a <EM>cult</EM>: "A
system for the cure of disease based on dogma set forth by its promulgator,"
and a <EM>sect</EM>: "a group adhering to a distinctive doctrine or a leader." Healing
cults or sects cannot progress and retain their identity. Homeopathy is what
Hahnemann said it was. To progress scientifically homeopathy would have to
accept principles of pharmacology and pathology, which run counter to its "law
s" of similia and infinitesimals, its potency theory, and notions of the
psora and vitalism. By doing so, it would no longer be homeopathy but
biomedicine.

<H3>Studies of Homeopathy</H3>

Controlled studies involving homeopathic remedies appear to divide along
political lines. While the results of most studies do not support the use of
homeopathic remedies, some ostensibly well-designed trials have yielded
positive findings. Some of these, however, have been done by homeopaths, and
their reports contain rhetoric that reflects bias strong enough to undermine
confidence in the researchers' veracity. The best of these studies should be
repeated by objective investigators with independent analyses of the
homeopathic formulations employed to assure that they have not been
adulterated with active medications.
<P>   A comprehensive review of experimental research in homeopathy was done by
Scofield (1984). He concluded: "It is obvious from this review that, despite
much experimental and clinical work, there is only little evidence to suggest
that homeopathy is effective. This is because of bad design, execution,
reporting, analysis and, particularly, failure to repeat promising
experimental work and not necessarily because of the inefficacy of the system
which has yet to be properly tested on a large enough scale. There is
sufficient evidence to warrant the execution of well-designed, carefully
controlled experiments." Scofield's most encouraging statement for homeopaths
was that "homeopathy has most certainly not been disproved." However,
Scofield ignored the scientific process. It is the absence of <EM>proof</EM>, not the
absence of <EM>disproof</EM>, that is important. This is consistent with scientific
dicta (based upon the statistical null hypothesis) that (1) no practice can
be deemed safe or effective until proved to be so; and (2) the burden of
proof is upon proponents.
<P>   A more recent meta-analysis of 107 controlled homeopathy trials appearing
in 96 published reports also found "the evidence of clinical trials is
positive but not sufficient to draw definitive conclusions because most
trials are of low methodological quality and because of the unknown role of
publication bias." They also concluded that there is a legitimate case for
further evaluation of homeopathy, "but only by means of well-performed
trials" (Kleijnen, 1991).
<P>   In 1988, a French scientist working at that country's prestigious INSERM
institute claimed to have found that high dilutions of substances in water
left a "memory," providing a rationale for homeopathy's Law of
Infinitesimals. His findings were published in a highly regarded science
journal, but with the caveat that the findings were unbelievable, and that
the work was financed by a large homeopathic drug manufacturer (<EM>Nature</EM>,
1988). Subsequent investigations, including those by James Randi, disclosed
that the research had been inappropriately carried out. The scandal resulted
in the suspension of the scientist. Careful analysis of the study revealed
that had the results been authentic, homeopathy would be more likely to worsen
 a patient's condition than to heal, and that it would be impossible to
predict the effect of the same dose from one time to another (Sampson, 1989).
<P>   The sectarian nature of homeopathy raises serious questions about the
trustworthiness of homeopathic researchers. Scofield appropriately stated: "It
 is hardly surprising in view of the quality of much of the experimental work
as well as its philosophical framework, that this system of medicine is not
accepted by the medical and scientific community at large." Two guiding rules
required by skeptics of pseudoscience should be applied to homeopathic
research, to wit: (1) extraordinary claims demand extraordinary evidence; and
(2) it is not necessary to prove fraud, rather, the research must be done in
such a manner that fraud is not possible.

<H2>Homeopathic Products</H2>

<H3>Dubious Labeling</H3>

Recent years have seen an explosion of products labeled as "homeopathic."
Among them are raw animal glands, herbal concoctions, and mineral remedies.
Although some are reruns of old-time homeopathic preparations, others appear
to be merely pretenders with high-dilution their only homeopathic feature.
For instance. homeopathic raw bovine testicles may be highly diluted, but in
order to be truly homeopathic they should have been "proved" and potentized.
To have been proved, healthy people should have been fed raw bovine testicles
in moderate doses and the side-effects analyzed. Gland products are not
representative of the kinds of therapeutic substances homeopaths have
traditionally attempted to "prove," and it is unlikely that ingesting
significant amounts of raw bovine testicles would produce any side effects.
Such products appear to be intended to ward off regulatory enforcement action
by merely labeling them "homeopathic," but such products do not meet the
basic consumer protection principle of accurate labeling. Standard drug
labeling informs consumers about the quantity of active ingredients per dose;
homeopathic labeling only informs consumers about the number of serial
dilutions of the remedy.

<H3>Questionable Safety</H3>

Although homeopathic remedies are generally thought to be nontoxic due to
their high dilutions, some preparations have proved to be harmful. Perverse
belief in the "healing crisis" can cause pseudomedical practitioners to
misjudge adverse reactions as beneficial. <EM>Healing crisis</EM> is the theory that
the body innately knows what is best for it. There is a corollary belief that
adverse reactions to "natural remedies" are due to "toxins" being expelled,
and that the worse these are, the worse would have been future diseases if
not detoxified. Thus, believers are not alarmed by adverse reactions, and are
encouraged to continue treating. At the same time, "allopathic" medicine is
denigrated as the "suppressing of symptoms that represent the body's natural
healing processes." Kerr and Yarborough (1986) reported a case of
pancreatitis that developed in a patient ingesting a homeopathic remedy
prescribed by a chiropractor. According to the authors, the manufacturer
stated that 40-45% of persons taking the remedy experienced a healing crisis
that included abdominal pain. Although classical homeopathy employed numerous
extremely toxic substances in infinitesimal amounts, Kerr found that two of
six homeopathic remedies ordered by mail contained "notable quantities" of
arsenic. NCAHF doubts that homeopathic devotees would systematically report
adverse effects.

<H3>Suspicious Effectiveness</H3>

Much has been made of the fact that a 24X dilution would no longer contain a
single molecule of the original substance, and reported benefits are
generally attributed to the placebo effect. However, many homeopathic
dosages, although dilute, may contain enough of a substance to be effective.
Homeopathic products also may work because of adulteration. Morice (1986, pp.
862-863) reported that a homeopathic remedy called "Dumcap" appeared to be
effective in treating asthma. Although labeled as containing "nux vomica"
(strychnine), arsenic album (arsenic trioxide), <EM>Blatta onentalis</EM> (cockroach
extract), and stramoni folic (stramonium), analysis revealed that the product
was adulterated with therapeutic levels of the antiasthma, steroidal drugs
<EM>prednisolone</EM> and <EM>betamethasone</EM>. Studies of homeopathic deemed unacceptable
unless they have been monitored to assure that they were prepared according
to homeopathic principles, their contents verified and dosage quantified, and
secured to prevent tampering. As was stated above, simply labeling a product
"homeopathic" does not guarantee that it does not contain a pharmacologically
active dosage of an active substance (not all dilutions exceed Avogadro's
number). To validate a specific homeopathic remedy, replication by others who
have no vested interest in the results is required. To validate homeopathic
theory, higher dilutions would also have to be shown to work better than
higher concentrations. Thomas Paine, a signer of the United States'
Declaration of Independence, is credited with establishing a principle for
judging supernatural phenomena. He asked, "Is it easier to believe that
nature has gone out of her course or that a man would tell a lie?"

The 1993 directory of the National Center for Homeopathy (Alexandria, VA)
lists about 300 licensed practitioners. About half of these are physicians.
The rest are mostly naturopaths, chiropractors, acupuncturists,
veterinarians, dentists, nurses, or physician's assistants. A homeopathic
marketing firm spokesperson believes that several hundred more consider
themselves to be homeopaths, and that many conventional physicians utilize
one or more homeopathic remedies (National Board of Chiropractic Examiners,
1993). However, no data have been published supporting these estimates. In
1991-2, 36.9% of chiropractors reported using homeopathic remedies in their
practices.

<H3>A Haven for Untrustworthy Practitioners</H3>

Part of homeopathy's appeal is the personal attention paid to patients (Avina
and Schneiderman, 1978). In practice, classical homeopaths emphasize taking
30 to 45 minutes with each patient, paying careful attention to the emotional
state and administering only one remedy at a time. Classical homeopathy's
close personal attention to patients, benign remedies, and special appeal to
a select clientele make it seem innocuous if practitioners have the
competence and good sense to recognize serious disorders and readily refer to
other physicians. This, however, is not always the case. 
<P>   Pseudosciences such as homeopathy, even if relatively benign, are magnets
for cranks and charlatans. This poses a serious problem because untrustworthy
or incompetent practitioners should not be granted the privilege of
administering health care. True believing cranks may pose a more serious
threat than con men because of their devotion to homeopathy's ideology. Their
sincerity may make them more socially tolerable, but it can add to their
potential danger. Irrational health care is never harmless, and it is
irresponsible to create patient confidence in pseudomedicine. Although
homeopathy may not pose a significant risk for a basically healthy patient,
at some future time that same patient could face a situation where a
life-or-death decision may swing on just such unwarranted confidence.
<P>   Some practitioners do not practice in homeopathy's classical manner, but
use its "benign" reputation as a cover. A well-documented example occurred in
Nevada. According to an expose by the <EM>Las Vegas Review-Journal</EM>, several
maverick MDs who had been in serious legal difficulty in other states
descended on Nevada and managed to get the State Legislature to set up a
homeopathic licensing board with themselves in charge. However, none was
actually practicing homeopathy. Rather, using an unapproved electronic device
they practiced "energy medicine." When faced with the fact that they had
deceived the State Legislature, proponents stated that they had used the more
familiar term "homeopathy" because they feared that the legislators would not
be able to grasp the new concept of "bioenergetics." The Nevada legislature
rewrote the homeopathic practice act in 1987, specifically stating that
Nevada homeopaths were limited to using substances prepared according to "the
methods of Hahnemannian dilution and succussion, magnetically energized
geometric pattern as defined in the official homeopathic pharmacopeia of the
United States" (Hayslett, 1987).
<P>   It is difficult to believe that a physician could simultaneously sustain
confidence in both homeopathy and scientific health care. It is common for
homeopaths to misrepresent regular medicine as misguided to justify their
unusual practices. Of special concern to NCAHF is the substitution of
homeopathic preparations for standard immunizations. In 1989, an Idaho
naturopath was prosecuted for selling homeopathic "immunization kits," which
contained alcohol-and-water solutions and sugar pills. Defenders claimed that
the homeopathic immunization products would "stimulate the immune system;"
and that the FDA laboratory could not detect the active ingredients because
they were so highly diluted with sugar.

<H3>Quackery</H3>

NCAHF is primarily concerned with homeopathy in the marketplace. It believes
that marketing unproven homeopathic products and services precisely fits the
definition of quackery: "A quack is anyone who promotes medical schemes or
remedies known to be false, or which are unproven, for a profit'' (<EM>Quackery</EM>,
1984). Dr. Kenneth Milstead, then Deputy Director of the FDA Bureau of
Enforcement, stated (Young, 1968):
<BLOCKQUOTE>
It matters not whether the article is harmless or whether it gives some
psychosomatic relief; whether it is cheap or whether it has value for other
purposes; whether it is produced by an obscure firm or whether it is produced
by a "reputable" firm-the promotion of it is still quackery. 
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H2>Regulators Fiddle While Consumers Are Burned</H2>

<H3>Federal Regulation</H3>

For many years homeopathic product marketing was quiescent, but with the
health fad boom of the 1970's and 1980's, promoters began touting homeopathic
remedies. In 1985 the FDA estimated that between 50 and 60 companies were
marketing such products in the United States (FDA, 1985). The 1938 Food,
Drug, and Cosmetic Act contains a section that recognizes as "drugs" items
listed in the Homeopathic Pharmacopeia of the United States. This was mainly
due to the efforts of New York Senator Royal Copeland who was the foremost
homeopathic physician of his day. In 1938, safety was the main issue, and the
highly diluted homeopathic products seemed to pose no inherent danger.
However, in 1962, the Kefauver-Harris Amendment was passed requiring that
drugs be proved effective before distribution. A legal fight loomed as to
whether or not homeopathic drugs were grandfathered by the law, but FDA did
not press the issue. Instead, it permitted products aimed at common ailments
to be marketed over-the-counter (OTC), and restricted those aimed at serious
ailments to prescription only. This "passed the buck" to the states that
regulate the practitioners who write the prescriptions, putting consumers at
the mercy of maverick homeopathic physicians. It also sent a signal to
marketers that it was open season on consumers with regard to OTC homeopathic
products. The resulting marketplace growth increased the ability of trade
groups to gain political support and made future regulatory action more
difficult. Homeopathic claims of efficacy are unsubstantiated and violate the
Federal Trade Commission (FTC) advertising standards, but the FTC has not
acted against homeopathic advertising claims. Homeopathic remedies sold or
transported by mail are subject to action by the U.S. Postal Inspectors, but
few such actions have been taken.

<H3>State Regulation</H3>

Only Arizona, Connecticut, and Nevada have separate homeopathic licensing
boards. At least two of these have included in prominent roles maverick
medical doctors who have been in legal difficulties as regular physicians.
Some state licensing boards permit licensed medical doctors to practice
almost any kind of medicine they wish. Others, rightly in NCAHF's opinion,
require that health care be held to rational and responsible standards. To
its credit, the North Carolina Board of Medical Examiners revoked the license
of the state's only practicing homeopath, concluding that he was "failing to
conform to the standards of acceptable and prevailing medical practice." This
resulted in a prolonged legal battle over the ability of a licensing board to
impose standards of practice on its constituency. The state legislature
eventually passed a law that limited the board's disciplinary power
undermining the consumer protection aspects of responsible medicine.

<H2>Recommendations</H2>

<H3>To Consumers</H3>

Be aware that homeopathic products and services are marketed in a "buyer
beware" situation at present. Homeopathic products are not required to meet
the standards of effectiveness of drugs. Homeopathic services are poorly
regulated. Physicians who practice homeopathy operate below the standards of
responsible medicine. Some have backgrounds that raise serious questions
about their honesty. Be aware that in some states that have homeopathic
licensing boards the "foxes are guarding the chicken coops." Consumers should
not entrust their health to physicians or nonphysicians who practice
homeopathy.

<H3>To Basic Scientists</H3>

Homeopathy conflicts more with basic laws of physics, chemistry and
pharmacology than with clinical medicine. Pharmacologists should be more
proactive in opposing the marketing of homeopathic remedies. Because
homeopathic theories contradict known physical laws, tests of homeopathic
remedies require controls beyond those normally required of double-blind
clinical trials including additional measures to show that fraud was not
possible.

<H3>To the U.S. Food & Drug Administration</H3> 

(1) Require that labels of homeopathic products indicate the precise amounts
of ingredients in milligrams, micrograms, etc. (2) Require homeopathic
products to meet the efficacy standards of all other drugs.

<H3>To the U.S. Federal Trade Commission</H3>

(1) Review advertising of homeopathic products in publications aimed at the
public for false and misleading claims. (2) Monitor and take action against
advertisements in trade publications used to indoctrinate salespeople, who
will in turn deceive consumers about the value of homeopathic products.

<H3>To U.S. Postal Inspectors</H3>

Prosecute distributors of homeopathic mail-order products that make unproven
medical claims for mail fraud.

<H3>To State Legislators</H3>

Because homeopathy is scientifically indefensible: (1) Enact laws requiring
that medical products sold within your state meet the standards of accurate
labeling, truthful advertising, and premarketing proof of safety and
effectiveness. (2) Abolish state licensing boards for homeopathy. (3) Do not
allow homeopathy in the scope of practice of any health care provider.

<H3>To State Food & Drug Regulators</H3>

Take prompt regulatory action against manufacturers, wholesalers, and
retailers of homeopathic products who violate the law.

<H3>To Medical Licensing Boards</H3>

(1) Discipline homeopathic practitioners for unprofessional conduct. (2)
Prosecute nonphysicians engaging in homeopathy for practicing medicine
without a license.
<P>Because homeopathy is scientifically indefensible: (1) Enact laws requiring
that medical products sold within your state meet the standards of accurate
labeling, truthful advertising, and premarketing proof of safety and
effectiveness. (2) Abolish state licensing boards for homeopathy. (3) Do not
allow homeopathy in the scope of practice of any health care provider.

<H1>IS THERE REALLY A COSMOLOGICAL CRISIS?
<P>

If The Stars Are Older Than the Universe Then We Have A Serious 
Problem</H1>



<H2><A HREF = "03.4.about-shaffer.html">By Rick Shaffer</A></H2>

Although it certainly does not rival the attention given to the O.J. 
Trial, there is a polite controversy micro-raging within the world of 
astronomy. It seems that one group of astronomers, using data from the 
Hubble Space Telescope (HST), has measured the distance to a galaxy in a 
group of galaxies called the Virgo Cluster. Their measurement implies 
that the age of the universe is between 8- and 11-billion years.
<P>If other measurements were consistent with this one, we would not 
have a controversy, so it should not surprise you to read that another 
group of astronomers has modeled the evolution of stars, and concluded 
that the oldest stars they have observed are approximately 15-billion 
years old! How can the oldest stars in the universe be older than the 
universe itself? Can the child be older than the parent?
<P>Unless the universe is even stranger than our wildest dreams, the 
answer is that those really old stars may indeed be really old, but not 
older than the universe itself. So one of the measurements must be 
wrong. Right? Well, with apologies to Hertz Rent-A-Car, not exactly.
<P>Although most people perceive physics and astronomy to be exact 
sciences, in many instances they are not. In this case, the age of the 
universe determined by each group is an estimate based on observations 
that have quite a bit of error built into them. That is why the figure 
quoted by the group using the HST is "between 8- and 11-billion years." 
The estimate of the age of the oldest stars--those in clusters of stars 
called globular clusters--has a similar range, possibly 13- to 18-
billion years. The real controversy involves the fact that the "spreads" 
in the respective estimates do not overlap.
Since this essay is part of an issue devoted to cosmology, I will not 
spend any time describing how the estimate of the age of the oldest 
stars was made. However, you should know that the estimate was provided 
by practitioners of the science of the physics of stars--the 
astrophysicists. I am also compelled to point out that this estimate was 
not made capriciously. Rather, it is the result of hundreds of person-
years of effort, both on the part of astronomers making the 
observations, and of the astrophysicists who try to make sense of the 
observations. Nobody knows which of the competing estimates is closest 
to the truth. Since there is no "cosmic judge" to rule on the truth of 
either estimate, time and many future observations will tell us which is 
correct.
<P>A thumbnail sketch of how cosmologists came up with their estimate of 
the age of the universe will serve two purposes. First, it will 
illustrate the problems associated with making measurements of a system-
-the universe--only a minuscule part of which we will ever traverse. 
Second, it will illustrate the incredible leaps of reasoning that have 
allowed humans to travel the universe despite being confined, at least 
for the immediate future, to our solar system.


<H2>Another Brief History of Time</H2>

Not surprisingly, the first measurements astronomers made were of 
distances to nearby objects in the solar system. Those estimates were 
reasonable, but not without error. As time went on the estimates were 
refined and the error diminished. We now know the values of the 
parameters describing the size and shape of the solar system so 
accurately that we flew the Voyager II spacecraft through a gap in the 
rings of Saturn with impunity (although maybe we shouldn't have).
<P>Early measurements of the distance to the nearest stars were made by 
measuring their parallax. This just means that astronomers measured the 
apparent position of a star in January, for instance, and then in July, 
when the Earth had moved to the other side of its orbit. If the star 
appeared to move relative to its more distant brethren, then it is a 
simple exercise in trigonometry to use our very accurate knowledge of 
the size of the Earth's orbit and the angle the star appeared to move to 
compute the star's distance.
Parallax measurement is a foolproof way to measure the distances to the 
closest stars, but as astronomers tried to make parallax measurements of 
more and more distant stars, they discovered that the yearly "wobble" in 
the stars' positions was approaching the limit of their ability to 
measure it. So, parallax only allows us to measure the distance to stars 
that are within a few hundred light years from Earth.
<P>Astronomers next used their studies of the physics of stars in 
clusters to make estimates of the distances of nearby stars that were 
too far for accurate parallax measurements to be made. Fortunately for 
all concerned, some of the stars in nearby clusters are of a type known 
as Cepheid variables (so named after the first one discovered in the 
constellation Cepheus).Cepheid variables are stars that periodically 
swell and shrink due to an instability in their outer layers. When a 
Cepheid has swollen to its maximum, it is at its dimmest; when it has 
shrunk to its minimum, it is at its brightest. How they do their swell-
and-shrink act is not important to our discussion. However, it turns out 
that for all Cepheids of a certain type, there is a linear (straight-
line) relationship between the period of variability of the star and its 
intrinsic brightness.
Astronomers can make very accurate measurements of the brightness of 
stars using instruments known as photometers. Once they measure the 
apparent brightness of a Cepheid, and obtain a good estimate of its 
distance, they can easily compute its intrinsic brightness, using the 
well-known relationship that an object's apparent brightness is 
proportional to the inverse-square of its distance. Once they have the 
intrinsic brightness and the period of a number of Cepheids, they are 
able to establish a reasonably accurate period-luminosity relationship. 
They could then use Cepheids to measure the distances to many groupings 
with which the Cepheids appear to be associated.
<P>All the methods I have mentioned so far have been used by astronomers 
to establish their estimates of the size of just our galaxy. (I have 
glossed over several intermediate steps in the process of sizing the 
Milky Way Galaxy, which is about 100,000 light years across.) The 
crucial things to remember are: (1) there are many links in the 
measurement chain; (2) each link has its own measurement error; and (3) 
the farther away from Earth we go, the bigger the potential error (as a 
percentage of the measurement)! This means that as astronomers make 
measurements of the size of the universe, the farther they measure, the 
less accurate their measurement is likely to be.
<P>For an example, think about the next step in the distance chain. In 
1923, Edwin Hubble identified a Cepheid variable in the Great Andromeda 
Nebula, as it was then called. He used a photometer to measure both its 
apparent brightness and its period of variability. Using the period-
luminosity relationship, he was able to compute the Cepheid's intrinsic 
brightness. It was then a simple matter to compute its distance.
<P>Hubble's answer was 1-million light years. This showed that the Great 
Andromeda Nebula is not a nebula at all. Rather, it is a galaxy quite 
similar to our own. More important for our discussion, though, is the 
fact that only a few years later a refinement in one link of the 
measurement chain forced Hubble to revise his estimate of the distance 
to the Andromeda Galaxy to 2-million light years! Further refinements 
have put our best estimate at 2.3-million light years. So, Hubble's 
initial measurement of the distance to the Andromeda Galaxy was off by 
more than a factor of two, yet it was one of the most important 
scientific measurements ever made.
Hubble concentrated on the Andromeda Galaxy because it is the biggest 
and brightest of the spiral galaxies. He went on to use other methods to 
observe many other galaxies. What he found formed the basis of modern 
cosmology. 
<P>Around 1920, astronomer E. C. Slipher, of the Lowell Observatory, 
Flagstaff, Arizona, noticed a startling fact about the spectra of 
galaxies: when he compared them to a standard laboratory spectrum, their 
features were almost always shifted toward the red, or longer wavelength 
end of the spectrum. This implied that the galaxies are all receding 
from us, thus "stretching" the length of the waves of light they radiate 
to us. The bigger the red-shift, the faster the velocity of recession. 
(The waves of light are not really stretched; it is just an effect of 
the velocity of recession and our perspective. This phenomenon is 
commonly known as the Doppler Effect.)
It was Edwin Hubble who took Slipher's observation further and supplied 
the correct interpretation of it. Hubble used the 100-inch Hooker 
telescope on Mount Wilson to make two fundamental measurements regarding 
galaxies: (1) their velocity of recession, as determined by the red-
shift of their spectra; and (2) their distances, using a variety of 
methods, only a few of which I have outlined above.
<P>Once Hubble had made both recession-velocity and distance 
measurements of a number of galaxies, he realized that the farther a 
galaxy is from us, the faster it is receding. Put another way, a 
galaxy's velocity of recession is directly proportional to its distance. 
This is known as Hubble's Law, and the constant of proportionality is 
known as the Hubble Constant. Its units are velocity-per-unit-distance, 
and it is commonly expressed as "so-many-kilometers-per-second-per-
megaparsec." (A megaparsec is 3.26 million light-years.) For those who 
like equations, here is Hubble's Law:

<P>Velocity of recession = (Hubble Constant) x Distance

<P>Edwin Hubble, with a nudge from Slipher, had discovered the expansion 
of the universe. Hubble's discovery implied a lot more than just 
Hubble's Law. It also validated a powerful philosophical concept called 
the Cosmological Principle. The galaxies Hubble observed in discovering 
the expansion of the universe were in all parts of the sky visible from 
Mount Wilson. This implies that no matter what direction we look, the 
universe appears to be expanding at the same rate (i.e., isotropically). 
This means that if we look at a group of galaxies that are 10-million 
light years in one direction, and another group that lies 10-million 
light years in the opposite direction, we will find that they are 
receding from us with the same velocity. In like manner, if we look a 
billion light years from Earth in any direction, the galaxies we see at 
that distance will all be receding from us with the same (faster) 
velocity.
If the universe were not expanding isotropically the various clusters of 
galaxies would tend to "bunch together" into lumps. We do not see that. 
Rather, the gross structure of the universe seems to be homogeneous. 
Although there does seem to be some organization to clusters of 
galaxies--the so-called "cosmic strings"--the strings observed in one 
direction appear not to differ much from those observed in any other 
direction.


<H2>The Vegetable Soup Model of the Universe</H2>

All astronomy students are familiar with the raisin-cake model of the 
universe. In trying to explain homogeneity to kids, I have often invoked 
that staple of kid-lunches, canned vegetable soup. I point out that the 
contents of one spoonful of soup may have a chunk of potato, an "x," two 
"v's," a slice of carrot, one totally un-ID-able "object," and a little 
broth. Missing might be a piece of celery (unless it is the "object"), 
one of those delectable pieces of "mystery meat," and all the other 
letters of the alphabet.
The next spoonful would have a different distribution of ingredients. If 
we cared to inventory the whole bowl, we would probably find a 
distribution of ingredients very similar to the manufacturer's recipe. 
The whole pan of soup we heated would be even closer to the recipe, 
while the vat in which a day's production of soup was made would nail 
it.
<P>It is not hard to see that each spoonful of soup is not homogeneous, 
but that each bowl of soup is much closer to being so. And, the pan is 
even more homogeneous than the bowl, while the vat is really 
homogeneous. Each spoonful of soup represents our immediate 
neighborhood, say the Local Group of galaxies to which we belong. (The 
one whose letters spell out E-A-R-T-H is ours!) The bowl might be our 
local supercluster of galaxies, while the pan might represent a string 
of galaxies. The vat of soup would make a fairly good homogeneous 
universe.
<P>The vegetable soup analogy does fine with homogeneity, but not with 
the isotropic nature of the expansion of the universe. That's because 
those little bits of barley move around in the soup much faster than the 
other bigger ingredients, which tend to stick to the bottom. So, the 
manufacturer has to use enormous, powered stirring spoons in each vat. 
If you put each of the spoons up to your ear, you can just hear them 
chanting, "ooom-ogeneity, ooom-o-geneity, ooom-o-geneity, ooom-o-
geneity"
<P>(By invoking this analogy-for-kids, I make two points: 1. thinking up 
analogies that both correctly illustrate a scientific theory, the barley 
notwithstanding, and that kids will like and understand, has really 
helped my understanding of cosmology; 2. my understanding of cosmology 
had a long way to come!)
<P>For completeness, then, the Cosmological Principle states that, to an 
observer on a typical galaxy, the universe is expanding isotropically 
(looks the same in every direction), and is homogeneous (looks the same 
at every point).
<P>Another way of expressing the Cosmological Principle is to say that 
the laws of physics we have deduced here on Earth and in our solar 
system do not change regardless of where in the universe we look. This 
may seem like a circular argument, but astronomers have seen nothing to 
suggest anything to the contrary. 
<P>Once we accept Hubble's Law and the Cosmological Principle, we can 
assume that, if we know an object's red-shift, and thus its velocity of 
recession, we can just "plug it into" Hubble's Law and solve the 
equation for the object's distance. Even more important, we should be 
able to use the Hubble Constant to determine the age of the universe. 
Right? Wellagain, not exactly.
<P>Both statements are true. However, notice that each invokes such 
modifiers as "assume" and "should be able." The reason the modifiers are 
used is that there is no general agreement as to the precise value of 
the Hubble Constant. The reason, of course, is all those pesky, error-
prone links in the chain-of-distance measurement. Essentially, there is 
no consensus amongst astronomers as to what error to assign to each link 
in the chain. Nobody worries about the velocity measurement. The red-
shift on which it is based can be measured to an accuracy of 1%. (Before 
you lower your respect for astronomers, find another example of anything 
else on which we humans are unanimous in our opinions, besides our love 
of chocolate and our seemingly universal admiration for Cal Ripken, Jr.)
<P>In fact, the primary reason astronomers lobbied to get the Hubble 
Space Telescope funded was to allow them to make observations of 
galaxies that would then allow them to refine their estimate of the 
value of the Hubble Constant. And, of course, they are doing just that.


<H2>TimeSinceBang = AgeO'Verse</H2>

Before we look at how the HST is being used to refine the value of the 
Hubble Constant, let's take a short detour to see how the Hubble 
Constant can be used to make an estimate of the age of the universe.
Most cosmologists believe that the universe began in an explosion of 
incredible magnitude that is popularly known as the Big Bang. A very 
simplistic view of what happened after the Big Bang goes like this: 
Despite all we have been told about how insignificant we are, we cling 
to our political incorrectness and believe that we are at the exact 
center of the universe. Since we are at the very center, the galaxies 
are all receding from us. At any particular time after the Big Bang, the 
very fastest galaxies are farthest away from us. Those galaxies, if they 
have been blasting along unimpeded, have traveled a distance defined 
below as:

<P>Distance = Velocity x TimeSinceBang

<P>If we multiply both sides of the equation by the factor
 (1/Time Since Big Bang), we get:

<P>Distance x (1/TimeSinceBang) = Velocity

<P>or,

<P>Velocity = (1/TimeSinceBang) x Distance

<P>This final version of the equation looks just like Hubble's Law, as 
long as we are willing to assume that:

<P>(Hubble Constant) = (1/TimeSinceBang)

<P>The quantity I have called "TimeSinceBang" is, of course, the age of 
the universe. So, our simplistic explanation of the history of the 
universe implies that all we have to do to find out the age of the 
universe is to find out the value of the Hubble Constant, and then find 
its reciprocal:

<P>AgeO'Verse = 1/(Hubble Constant)

<P>Amazingly, when astronomers plug their favorite values for the Hubble 
Constant into the above equation, they get values for the age of the 
universe of between 10- and 20-billion years, a value which agrees quite 
well with other data! But, how do we go from this simplistic view of the 
age of the universe to a realistic one?
<P>The major consideration has to do with the assumption we made about 
those galaxies "blasting along unimpeded." Despite the power of the Big 
Bang, all those galaxies must have been attracting each other 
gravitationally, thus slowing them down. So, the earlier we go back in 
time in the "real" universe, the faster those galaxies must have been 
"blasting along." This means that the universe must have taken a shorter 
period of time to get to "now," making it younger than the age found for 
the simplistic "free-expansion" universe.
<P>An important implication of this realistic "gravitationally-impeded" 
universe is that the Hubble "Constant" must change as the universe ages. 
It diminishes as time goes on. If it "passes through zero" to become 
negative, the universe will begin to contract, eventually imploding, 
possibly to begin another cycle. Will this happen? Right now astronomers 
have not found enough mass in the universe to allow for its expansion to 
be halted eventually. If the "missing mass" is really missing, the 
universe will continue to expand forever, or indefinitely, whichever 
comes later.


<H2>The +- Problem</H2>

It is now pretty obvious why determining the value of the Hubble 
Constant is important. It is one of the fundamental quantities we need 
to estimate the size and age of the universe.
<P>The latest hoopla in the press is centered around the measurement of 
the distance to a galaxy known as M100 made by a group of astronomers 
using the HST. The group is headed by Wendy Freedman of the Carnegie 
Observatories in Pasadena, California. Her group determined that the 
distance to M100 is 56-million light years, with an estimated error of 
+/-13 light years. An earlier ground-based observation had determined 
that the distance to another member of the Virgo Cluster of galaxies is 
49-million light years, with a similar estimated error.
<P>The M100 team used Cepheid variable stars to determine the distance 
to galaxy M100. They chose M100 because it is a spiral galaxy in which 
many Cepheids are likely to be found. (The fact that the images of M100 
made by HST are breathtakingly beautiful surely did not bother the NASA 
PR folks either.) They found Cepheids, and the HST's now-perfect optics, 
and its position above Earth's atmosphere, allowed the team to 
accurately measure the apparent brightness of M100's Cepheids. It was 
then a simple matter to compute the distance to M100 using the method 
outlined above.
<P>When the 56-million light years figure and the measured recession 
velocity of M-100 are plugged into Hubble's Law, the result is a Hubble 
Constant of 80 +/-18 kilometers/sec/megaparsec. That value implies that 
the age of the universe is "only" 8-11 billion years. As I have already 
mentioned, that certainly upsets the astrophysicists' applecart, as 
their model of stellar evolution suggests that the oldest stars are 
something like 15-billion years old. The Hubble Constant that 
corresponds to that age of the universe is 50.
<P>Those astronomers who favor an older universe, and therefore a 
smaller Hubble Constant, point out that M100 may be much closer to us 
than the average distance for the whole Virgo Cluster. And, since 
galaxies in a cluster tend to move relative to each other, only the 
distance of the center-of-mass of the whole cluster is valid for 
estimating the Hubble Constant. Furthermore, the Virgo Cluster is so 
massive that it is attracting our own galaxy toward it, and itself to 
us. The M100 team's detractors say that the team has not properly 
accounted for this effect.
<P>In fact, the M100 team mentioned all these objections (and more) in 
their paper announcing their results. They further pointed out that 
making the same measurements of the distance to a spiral galaxy in 
another cluster of galaxies--the Fornax Cluster--should improve the 
confidence they have in their results.
<P>Over the next few years, the M100 team will observe at least two 
spiral galaxies in the Fornax Cluster, looking for Cepheids to use to 
determine the galaxies' distances. They will also observe several more 
spirals in the Virgo Cluster. If their results are consistent with a 
high Hubble Constant, and, thus, a young universe, the astrophysicists 
may have to modify their model of the age of the oldest stars. However, 
if they cannot find any errors in their model, the controversy might 
continue. Ultimately, the cosmologists might have to re-think their 
cherished assumptions.
<P>What fun!

<H1>The (Im)moral Animal
<BR>A Quick & Dirty Guide to Evolutionary Psychology & the Nature of Human Nature</H1>

<H2><A HREF = "04.1.about-miele.html">By Frank Miele</A></H2>

Is "the fault, dear Brutus, not in our stars but in ourselves?" In our genes? Or in our jeans? Why do some "bestride the narrow world like a Colossus" while other "petty men [most of us] peep about to find ourselves dishonorable graves"? Are not men, as Shakespeare suggested in <EM>Julius Caesar</EM>, at least sometimes "masters of their fates"? Or, as Jack Nicholson's "average horny little devil" asks about the differences between men and women, in the film version of Updike's <EM>The Witches of Eastwick</EM>:
<P>Do you think God knew what he was doing...or do you think it was just another of his minor mistakes--like tidal waves, earthquakes, floods....When we make mistakes, they call it evil; God makes mistakes, they call it nature. 
<P>A mistake? Or did he do it on purpose? Because if it's a mistake, maybe we can do something about it--find a cure; invent a vaccine; build up our immune system.
<P>Throughout most of human history, the answers to these questions have come from myth or literature. Starting with the Enlightenment, however, the answers have usually been couched in the allegedly "objective findings" of either history or science. Since the end of World War II, the "standard model of social science," as summarized by Robert Wright in his very readable introduction to evolutionary psychology, skeptically (if not cynically) titled <EM>The Moral Animal</EM>, has held that "the uniquely malleable human mind, together with the unique force of culture, has severed our behavior from its evolutionary roots;...[and] there is no inherent human nature driving events...our essential nature is to be driven" (1994, p. 5). 
<P>For example, Emile Durkheim, the patriarch of modern sociology, referred to human nature as "merely the indeterminate material that the social factor molds and transforms." He argued that even such deeply felt emotions as sexual jealousy, a father's love of his child, or the child's love of the father are "far from being inherent in human nature." Robert Lowie, a founding father of American cultural anthropology, argued that "the principles of psychology are as incapable of accounting for the phenomena of culture as is gravitation to account for architectural styles." Ruth Benedict, one of the founding mothers of American anthropology, and a crusader against the theory of racial differences (which was the norm in pre-World War II days), wrote that "we must accept all the implications of our human inheritance, one of the most important of which is the small scope of biologically transmitted behavior, and the enormous role of the cultural process of transmission of tradition." (All quotes from Wright, 1994.) B. F. Skinner founded the school of behavioral psychology, dominant in American psychology in the 1950s and 1960s, on the bedrock assumption that human and animal behavior could be accounted for in terms of rewards and punishments. 
<P>To all of this, evolutionary psychologists reply with the gusto of a Wayne and Garth "NOT!" Human nature is real, it is important, and it isn't going to go away. Here is a sampling of the sorts of questions evolutionary psychologists ask and attempt to answer:
<UL>
<LI>Are we all naturally the same or naturally different?
<LI>Is our mind all of one piece or is it composed of modules?
<LI>Are we naturally moral and good and only become evil through circumstance, or are we naturally evil and only made good through enforced circumstance?
<LI>Why are men and women so different?
<LI>Do men naturally want young and beautiful women--and as many as they can get?
<LI>Do women naturally want rich and powerful men--and a bonded,  monogamous, caring relationship?
<LI>Are men naturally turned on (maybe too turned on) by the sight of a woman--or even a silhouette or cartoon of one?
<LI>Do men like sex more than women do? If so, why?
<LI>Just how much does a man's or woman's looks tell a member of the opposite sex about them and their value as a potential mate?
<LI>Why do men get turned on by "lips like rubies, eyes like limpid pools, and skin like silk"? And why do women spend so much time and money trying to achieve and reinforce that appearance?
<LI>Why do human males have such large penises relative to our nearest primate relatives the great apes?
<LI>Do some human groups, on average, have larger (and therefore less ape-like) penises than other groups? If so, why?
<LI>Why do human females have such large breasts relative to our nearest primate relatives the great apes?
<LI>Do dominant Alpha Males have all the fun and leave the most descendants, or do "Sneaky Fuckers" beat them at their own game?
<LI>Why do women have orgasms? 
<LI>Why do cute, lovable children so quickly transmogrify into wild, ungrateful teenagers?
<LI>Why, as we grow old, do we feel, in the words of retiring Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall, that we're "just fallin' apart?" 
<LI>Do men naturally form power pyramids and hierarchies while women naturally form cliques?
<LI>Do we naturally partition the world into US v. THEM? 
<LI>Does maternal instinct explain why moms usually act like moms, while dads all too often act like cads?
<LI>Do we naturally prefer those who physically resemble us and find them to be more like us in other ways as well?
</UL>
<P>Are such questions even scientifically meaningful or do they more properly fall in the realms of religion, literature, or politics? They are certainly great openers to liven up even the dullest party. But the new and emerging field of evolutionary psychology, building on work from Charles Darwin's <EM>Descent of Man</EM> and <EM>The Expression of Emotion in Man and Animals</EM>, tells us that the answers to these age-old questions, dear Brutus, are in our evolutionary history and our genes. And they claim they've got the "bloody daggers" to prove it! 
<P>This introduction cannot examine the evolutionary argument on each of these points. Instead, it merely outlines the case and describes the type of evidence and the nature of the arguments to be placed before you, the skeptical jury. The references in the bibliography provide a more complete "transcript." Our symposiasts will then present their closing arguments for and against evolutionary explanations of human behavior. 

<H2>From Survival of the Fittest to Inclusive Fitness</H2>

<IMG SRC = "04.1.miele-fig1.gif" ALT = "Figure 1" ALIGN=RIGHT>
<P>The fundamental theorem upon which evolutionary psychology is based is that behavior (just like anatomy and physiology) is in large part inherited and that every organism acts (consciously or not) to enhance its inclusive fitness--to increase the frequency and distribution of its selfish genes in future generations. And those genes exist not only in the individual but in his or her identical twin (100%), siblings (on average, 50%), cousins (on average, 25%) and so on down the kinship line. (Thus, aid to and feelings for relatives makes evolutionary sense.)
<P>This revision and extension of Darwinian evolution, from "survival of the fittest" to inclusive fitness, was worked out primarily by George Williams (in the US) and by William Hamilton and John Maynard Smith (in the UK) in the 1960s, with some clever twists added by Robert Trivers (in the US) in the 1970s. How efficiently can the Darwinian mill grind they asked? It largely depends on the type of grain fed in. Darwinian selection operates most effectively if the units on which it is working:
<OL>
<LI> are more, rather than less, variable; 
<LI> have shorter, rather than longer, lifetimes;
<LI> are more heritable, rather than environmental. 
</OL>
<P>Richard Alexander (1979) has argued convincingly that "genes are the most persistent of all living units, hence on all counts the most likely units of selection. One may say that genes evolved to survive by reproducing, and they have evolved to reproduce by creating and guiding the conduct and fate of all the units above them" (p.38, emphasis Alexander's). 
<P>Implicit in this reasoning is the conclusion that species and populations (races) are very unlikely units of selection. Hence, all talk of individuals doing things, especially dying, for the good of the species or the race, appear improbable if not downright impossible. But if that is the case, then how could any sort of cooperative behavior, of which there are as many examples all around us as there are of competitive behavior, have ever evolved? 
<P>Well, humans, like most complex species, don't pass on their genes by simply dividing and producing exact replicas of themselves the way amoebas do. It takes at least two, not only to tango, but to reproduce. While you need not share any genes with your mate, you must share some, but not necessarily all of them with your relatives (except in the interesting case of an identical twin, who shares all your genes). Work out the arithmetic and it produces some interesting consequences in terms of whom you should help and when, as summarized in Figure 1 (adapted from Alexander, 1979). Rather than anything so simple as either "every man for himself" or "all for one and one for all," Figure 1 shows that, like it or not, you're stuck in a complex, time-directed matrix of cooperation, competition, trust, and deception with all your blood relatives and even those you might think are blood relatives. 
<P>Appropriately enough, you watch out for Number 1 first; your parents, children, and full siblings next; and so on in order of decreasing genetic similarity. But given that time's arrow flies in one direction only, you have a better chance of passing on your genes by helping your children than by helping your aging parents. 

<H2>Symons Says</H2>

What does evolutionary theory predict you should expect from your mates? The answer is even more disconcerting. A corollary to the fundamental theorem is that the differences between males and females in humans, just as in most mammalian species, are readily explainable in terms of differential parental investment. That is, the male contributions to the reproductive process--lots of sperm and a few minutes of light work--are plentiful and cheap, short and pleasurable; while the female contributions--eggs and months of pregnancy--are rare and expensive, long, dangerous, and often painful. Given that, the best way for a male to maximize his inclusive fitness is to...well, diversify his genetic portfolio; while the best way for a female to insure the survival of the baby she has invested so much time and effort in is to try and get that guy to  meet his monthly payments. 
<P>In <EM>The Evolution of Human Sexuality</EM> (p. 27, 1979), anthropologist Donald Symons provides evolutionary psychology's point-by-point reply to "the horny little devil's" soliloquy on men and women:
<OL>
<LI> Intrasexual competition generally is much more intense among males than among females, and in preliterate societies competition over women probably is the single most important cause of violence.
<LI> Men incline to polygyny, whereas women are more malleable in this respect and, depending on the circumstances, may be equally satisfied in polygynous [one male--multiple females], monogamous, or polyandrous [one female--multiple males] marriages.
<LI> Almost universally, men experience sexual jealousy of their mates. Women are more malleable in this respect, but in certain circumstances, women's experience of sexual jealousy may be characteristically as intense as men's.
<LI> Men are much more likely to be sexually aroused by the sight of women and the female genitals than women are by the sight of men and the male genitals. Such arousal must be distinguished from arousal produced by the sight of, or the description of, an actual sexual encounter, since male-female differences in the latter may be minimal.
<LI> Physical characteristics, especially those that correlate with youth, are by far the most important determinants of women's sexual attractiveness. Physical characteristics are somewhat less important determinants of men's sexual attractiveness; political and economic prowess are more important; and youth is relatively unimportant.
<LI> Much more than women, men are predisposed to desire a variety of sex partners for the sake of variety. 
<LI> Among all peoples, copulation is considered to be essentially a service or favor that women render to men, and not vice versa, regardless of which sex derives or is thought to derive greater pleasure from sexual intercourse. 
</OL>
<P>To many, this sets a new standard in arguing for the inherent and therefore inescapable nature of the double standard. What evidence is there to support the argument that male-female differences are so deeply rooted in our nature? Anthropologists Lionel Tiger and Robin Fox argued in 1971 in <EM>The Imperial Animal</EM> (see interview this issue) that if "we look at enough primates to see what we all have in common, we'll get some idea of what it was we evolved from. If we see what we had to change from to get to be what we are now, it might help to explain what we in fact are."

<H2>Of Belles and Balls</H2>

<IMG SRC = "04.1.miele-figs2-3.gif" ALT = "Figures 2 and 3" ALIGN=RIGHT>
<P>
<P>Figures 2 and 3 are adapted from Jared Diamond's <EM>The Third Chimpanzee</EM> (pp. 73-74). They compare the relevant male and female anatomy for humans and our nearest living relatives, the great apes. 
<P>First look at the amount of sexual dimorphism in the four species. As Diamond notes, "chimps of both sexes weigh about the same; men are slightly larger than women, but male orangutans and gorillas are much bigger than females" (p. 73). These are interesting facts from comparative anatomy, but what do they have to do with behavior? Throughout the animal kingdom, polygynous species (i.e., those in which each dominant male breeds with multiple females), are sexually dimorphic. This makes sense from an evolutionary point of view. The only way a male can pass on his genes is to breed with a female, and to better the odds, the more the merrier. But since there are only so many females to go around, from day 1 males are in competition with other males for those females. An arms race begins in which males are selected for their ability to win out against other males for access to the females. And since nothing escalates like an arms race, you end up with male gorillas and orangs that are not only twice the size of the females, but armed with huge canines, and loaded with secondary sexual characteristics like crested heads and silver backs that are easily recognizable at a distance and help to attract mates. 
<P>Chimps, on the other hand, show little sexual dimorphism, less even than humans. The gibbon (an ape, but not a great one) shows the least sexual dimorphism. Males and females look identical at a distance and the gibbons' strict adherence to monogamy should win an award from the Moral Majority (though that would mean acknowledging man's common primate ancestry and therefore ditching creationism). Going simply by the dope sheet of sexual dimorphism, an evolutionary handicapper would bet the rent that Homo sapiens would, by nature, be mildly polygynous. And he'd walk away from the pay window a big winner. A cross-cultural analysis of 853 societies revealed that 83% of them are polygynous. Polygyny occurs frequently, even when legally prohibited. There are an estimated 25,000 to 35,000 polygynous marriages in the US; a study of 437 financially successful American men found that some maintained two separate families, each unknown to the other (Buss, pp. 177-178). Polyandry (one female with multiple males), on the other hand, is "virtually absent" among hunter/gatherers and confined to "agriculturalists and pastoralists living under very difficult economic conditions" and disappears quickly "when more usual conditions are present" (Symons, p. 225). 
<P>To move on from gross anatomy to gross discourse, if the male gorilla is so big and tough, how come he has such small balls? How does evolutionary theory account for those differences in testicle, penis, and breast size? It may be a tough climb to the top of the male gorilla dominance pyramid, but once there, things become quieter. Until dethroned, you have virtually uncontested access to all the females, so sex is no big thing. In fact, the dominant male with a harem of females "experiences sex as a rare treat: if he is lucky, a few times a year" (Diamond, p. 73). So just a little bit of sperm goes a long way to insuring the male gorilla's inclusive fitness. 
<P>For the minimally sexually dimorphic chimp, things get a little dicier. Chimps do have power pyramids. Compared to the gorilla and the orang, their hierarchies are so complex that Frans de Waal entitled his study of them <EM>Chimpanzee Politics</EM>. Getting to the top and staying there calls more for the skills of a Machiavelli than of a Mike Tyson. Dominant males have frequent though not exclusive access to the females. Rather than simply their bodies, it is their sperm that must compete against those of their fellow dominants, as well as those of the occasional "sneaky fucker." And all of this follows directly from one of the triumphs of evolutionary biology--The Theory of Testicle Size. To wit, "species that copulate more often need bigger testes; and promiscuous species in which several males routinely copulate in quick sequence with one female need especially big testes (because the male that injects the most semen has the best chance of being the one to fertilize the egg). When fertilization is a competitive lottery, large testes enable a male to enter more sperm in the lottery" (Diamond, p. 72). 
<P>Humans, according to evolutionary theory, should therefore be intermediate between chimps and gorillas both in polygyny and in promiscuity--and the data fit the prediction. I leave it to the reader to speculate as to what the evolutionary result would be if groups of religious cultists (in which the leader tries to monopolize the females) and outlaw biker gangs (who after all gave us the term "gang bang") were to each pursue their own evolutionary path, separate from the rest of human society. 
<P>Diamond provides more hard anatomical data (p. 75): 
<P>The length of the erect penis averages 1-1/4 inches in a gorilla, 1-1/2 inches in an orangutan, 3 inches in a chimp, and 5 inches in a man. Visual conspicuousness varies in the same sequence: a gorilla's penis is inconspicuous even when erect because of its black color, while the chimp's pink erect penis stands out against the bare white skin behind it. The flaccid penis is not even visible in apes. 
<P>To date, however, there is no adequate evolutionary explanation of the between-species differences in penis size. J. P. Rushton has offered a very controversial explanation of the mean differences in penis size between various racial groups within the human species. His letter to <EM>Skeptic</EM> (Vol. 3, No. 4, pp. 22-25), with an accompanying table, summarizes his argument that there is a "tradeoff" between cognitive assets (brain size and IQ score) and reproductive assets (penis size and gamete production). Both neurons and gametes are expensive and Rushton's data are replicable, but most evolutionary biologists and psychologists do not accept his interpretation. 
<P>Rushton's work highlights two important differences among evolutionary explanations of behavior. Evolutionary explanations of genetic differences between individuals, and especially between groups of individuals, have an air of an earlier Social Darwinism which many today find downright offensive. Which is not to say that they are, for that reason, factually wrong. But most of today's evolutionary psychologists are concerned with the universals of human nature, not the differences. They argue that "genetic differences among individuals surely play a role, but perhaps a larger role is played by genetic commonalities: by a generic, species-wide developmental program that absorbs information from the social environment and adjusts the maturing mind accordingly." They therefore believe that "future progress in grasping the importance of environment will probably come from thinking about genes" (Wright, p. 9). 
<P>And whereas Rushton and others, located on the pro side of <EM>The Bell Curve</EM> controversy, argue for a unitary view of the mind (usually manifested in a single trait variously referred to as intelligence, IQ, cognitive ability, or psychometric g) on which all individuals (and even groups) can be measured and ranked from top to bottom ("alphabetically by height" as legendary New York Yankee manager Casey Stengel once put it), most of today's evolutionary psychologists argue that evolution would rather select for distinct mental modules. In their view, evolution can give males a "love of offspring" module, and make that module sensitive to the likelihood that the offspring in question is indeed the man's. But the adaptation cannot be foolproof. Natural selection can give women an "attracted to muscles" module, or an "attracted to status" module, and...it can make the strength of those attractions depend on all kinds of germane factors.... As Tooby and Cosmides say, human beings aren't general purpose "fitness maximizers." They are "adaptation executors." The adaptations may or may not bring good results in any given case, and success is especially spotty in environments other than a small hunter-gatherer village (Wright, pp. 106-107). 
<P>In the view of most evolutionary psychologists, the modules may differ in effectiveness from one individual to another, but given the number of different modules, their effect is to "average out" individual differences to the point where any attempt to "line everyone up" on a single dimension is as nebulous as Casey's syntax.
<P>Now let's look at the females. "Human females are unique in their breasts, which are considerably larger than those of apes even before the first pregnancy" (Diamond, p. 74). Since the female gorilla and her baby are comparable in size to their human counterparts, the bulk of the huge (by primate standards) human female breast consists of fat, not milk glands, and breast size varies greatly among human females without affecting their ability to nurse young. Thus, the explanation cannot be based on the need to nurse infants. Rather, human female breasts are secondary sexual characteristics that evolved to attract mates. According to Desmond Morris (1967), this took place along with the switch from front-to-rear to front-to-front mating, the pendulous shape and cleavage of the breasts mimicking the pre-existing attractiveness of the female buttocks. This also, according to the theory, explains why men find other pendulous shapes (like ear lobes) and other cleavages (like toes in low-vamped shoes) such a turn-on.
<P>And while we're on the subject, what other female attributes turn men on? Gentlemen prefer young, nubile women, with lips like rubies, eyes like limpid pools, skin like silk, breasts like a milch cow, and legs like a race horse. According to evolutionary theory, this is not the result of either Hollywood or Madison Avenue, but because all of these features have served as cues to a female's health, reproductive potential and sexual availability over the course of human evolutionary history. Evolution has built into every red-blooded male a desire to find "Pornotopia"--the fantasy land where "sex is sheer lust and physical gratification, devoid of more tender feelings and encumbering relationships, in which women are always aroused, or at least easily arousable, and ultimately are always willing" (Symons, p. 171). The entire cosmetics, fashion, and pornography industries are attempts to create Pornotopia here on Earth.
<P>
<P><IMG SRC = "04.1.miele-fig4.gif" ALT = "Figure 4" ALIGN=RIGHT>
<P>Figure 4, adapted from Daly and Wilson (1988) depicts human female reproductive value, calculated in terms of expected live births among hunter/gatherers, as a function of female age. This curve parallels the curve for men's preferences in females as determined in cross-cultural studies (Buss, pp. 49-60; Symons, pp. 187-200). 
<P>Men naturally prefer young women because they provide the most reproductive potential for passing on the male's genes. If anything, males are biased toward selecting females before reproductive age in order to insure that no other male has beaten them to the finish line. From an evolutionary perspective, the least wise thing a male can do is to divert his hard-earned resources to rearing another man's child. Indeed, evolutionary psychologists would argue that this is why cuckolds are universally held in such low regard.

<H2>Murder 1, Incest 0</H2>

According to evolutionary theory, sex is a service women provide to men in return for resources. Evolutionary psychologists Martin Daly and Margo Wilson note that (p. 188, emphasis theirs):
<BLOCKQUOTE>
marriage is a contract not between husband and wife, but between <EM>men</EM>, a formalized transfer of a woman as a commodity. And indeed when one examines the material and labor exchanges that surround marriage, it does begin to look like a trafficking in women. In our society, as in many, a father <EM>gives</EM> his daughter in marriage. Men <EM>purchase</EM> wives in the majority of human societies, and they often demand a refund if the bargain proves disappointing. Although the relatively rare practice of dowry might be construed to mean that who pays whom is arbitrary and reversible, dowry and bride-price are not in fact opposites: A bride-price is given as compensation to the bride's kin, whereas a dowry typically remains with the newlyweds.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><IMG SRC = "04.1.miele-fig5.gif" ALT = "Figure 5" ALIGN=RIGHT>
<P>Figure 5 (adapted from Daly & Wilson, p. 189) summarizes the exchange considerations at marriage in a cross-cultural comparison of 860 societies and emphasizes the universality of compensation for rights to female reproductive capacity. 
<P>Even worse from the point of view of the male and his family than failure by the female to live up to her part of the contract is the thought that the male's investment in resources may be going into a competitor's product. Figures 6 and 7 (adapted from Homicide by Daly and Wilson) show that child abuse and even murder are much more common for adoptive parents than for natural parents. 
<P>While evolutionary theory predicts a certain level of parent-child and sibling rivalry, its predictions are contrary to another mainstay of social science--the Freudian Oedipus Complex. Under evolutionary theory, fathers have a strong vested interest in their son's well-being; provided, of course, it is their son. As sons mature, they may in fact compete with their fathers for status and for females (as daughters may compete with their mothers for males), but not for their own mother (or father). Many evolutionists argue that, given the decreased viability of children born out of incest, selection has created an incest taboo, especially against mother-son incest. The comparative ethnographic data support the existence of the incest taboo, not the Oedipus complex (Alexander, p.165; Wright, pp. 315-316).

<H2>They Say That Breaking Up Is Hard To Do Fisher's Divorce Law Says It Isn't</H2>

Evolutionary psychology provides explanations not only of why we pair up, but why we split up. Conservative social critics have decried the alarming increase in divorce in the US since the 1960s, and variously attribute it to removing Bible reading from the public schools, rock 'n roll, TV and movies, liberal social welfare programs, decriminalization of abortion, women's lib, and even the teaching of evolution. The evolutionary perspective, on the other hand, leads one to see lifetime monogamy as the exceptional result of an increased level of social pressure rather than as the rule for humans. 
<P><IMG SRC = "04.1.miele-fig8.gif" ALT = "Figure 8" ALIGN=RIGHT>
<P><IMG SRC = "04.1.miele-fig9.gif" ALT = "Figure 9" ALIGN=RIGHT>
<P>Anthropologist Helen Fisher has gathered divorce data from 62 societies around the world (Figures 8 and 9). She finds that "human beings in a variety of societies tend to divorce between the second and fourth years of marriage, with a divorce peak during the fourth year" (p. 360). She also finds that the divorce statistics for the US in 1986, well past the sexual revolution of the 1960s, fit the same pattern, with most divorces taking place between the second and third year of marriage (p. 362). 
<P>Fisher's evolutionary explanation attributes the universality of the divorce statistics to the "remarkable correlation between the length of human infancy in traditional societies, about four years, and the length of many marriages, about four years. Among the traditional !Kung, mothers hold their infants near their skin, breast-feed regularly through the day and night, nurse on demand, and offer their breasts as pacifiers. As a result of this constant body contact and nipple stimulation, as well as high levels of exercise and a low-fat diet, ovulation is suppressed and the ability to become pregnant is postponed for about three years" (p.153). She therefore concludes (p. 154): 
<P>The modern divorce peak--about four years--conforms to the traditional period between human successive births--four years....Like pair-bonding in foxes, robins, and many other species that mate only through a breeding season, human pairbonds originally evolved to last only long enough to raise a single dependent child through infancy, the first four years, unless a second child was conceived. 

<H2>Human, All Too Human</H2>

It may seem that either evolutionary psychology or the examples selected for this quick and dirty summary are more suited to tabloid TV than to <EM>Skeptic</EM> magazine. Are we trying to increase circulation by slumming to the lowest common denominator of human behavior? Well, evolutionary psychology has an answer for that one too. It is precisely because of our evolutionary history and the importance of maximizing inclusive fitness that humans in all cultures, throughout history, have found such lurid tales so irresistible. Some may prefer them told with British accents on Masterpiece Theatre, rather than in the dialect of Rap or the twang of Country & Western, but the archetypal themes are the same and evolutionary psychology tells us that they will never go away. 
<P>But just how scientific are these attempts to explain human behavior in evolutionary terms? To what extent do the questions we ask automatically set up the answers we get? After all, as Cassius taunted Brutus, we are sometimes masters of our own fate! To what extent are human nature and individual and group differences scientifically meaningful concepts, rather than the social constructions of learning and experience, political and economic conditions? Is there any scientific there there? 
<P>Harry Schlinger, a psychologist at Western New England College, critically analyzes evolutionary theories and argues that human behavior can be more scientifically and parsimoniously explained in terms of the verifiable laws of learning, without recourse to evolutionary or genetic arguments. Harmon Holcomb, a philosopher of science at the University of Kentucky, skeptically examines the theories of evolutionary psychology and finds that for the most part, at this point, they are neither pseudoscience, nor hard science, but protoscience, that is, science in the making. To graduate to the status of true science evolutionary psychology must put forth hypotheses that are capable of being critically disproven, rather than just reinforced or reconfirmed. He is a fair skeptic. Edward O. Wilson wrote on the cover of Holcomb's book <EM>Sociobiology, Sex, and Science</EM>, "Holcomb is now clearly the leading authority on sociobiology among philosophers of science" and (the book) "can and should be the standard reference on the subject." Reviewing the papers presented at the most recent meeting of the Human Behavior and Evolution Society, he shows which research has reached the level of real science. Frank Salter of the Max Planck Institute supplies a biological counterattack. He critically examines sociology by taking us on a skeptical browse through <EM>The Oxford Dictionary of Sociology</EM>, and finds that its studied avoidance of basic human nature amounts to little more than modern alchemy. 
<P>We round out the symposium with matched pairs of interviews and book reviews. Lionel Tiger and Robin Fox, two of the grand old men of evolutionary theories of behavior, look back on what's taken place in the field in the 25 years since they published their ground-breaking and controversial book The Imperial Animal. <EM>Skeptic</EM> advisory board member Stephen Jay Gould, a longtime critic of excessive appeals to evolution and genetics in the explanation of human behavior, offers his thoughts on evolution, his own revision of Darwinism, the problems with ultra-Darwinism, and the politics of science. Philosopher of science Michael Ruse, an expert on the nexus between philosophy and biology, reviews one of the most controversial new books in this field--Daniel Dennett's <EM>Darwin's Dangerous Idea</EM>--which is very critical of those who would revise basic Darwinian explanations, such as Gould with his theory of punctuated equilibrium. <EM>Skeptic</EM> publisher Michael Shermer also reviews Dennett's book, though from a different perspective than Ruse, in his analysis of "Gould's Dangerous Idea"--contingency, necessity, and the nature of history. And lest we be accused of presenting only the evolutionary side of the argument, we conclude with some comic relief as anthropologist and long-time creationist observer, Tom McIver, takes us on "A Walk Through Earth History: All Eight Thousand Years," in his skeptical tour of the Institute for Creation Research's museum. 
<P>So here then, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, is the issue at hand: Should we accept as a default hypothesis that human behavior, and the similarities and differences in behavior between individuals and groups, are the result of a complex interaction of the genes that reflect our evolutionary history as well as the environment in which we find ourselves? Or should we opt for the statistically null hypothesis that any invocation of genes and evolution to explain human behavior must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt? If nothing else, when you finish reading this symposium, I think you will be forced to conclude, in the words of Nobel Prize Winner and co-discoverer of DNA James Watson, that "Charles Darwin will eventually be seen as a far more influential figure in the history of human thought than either Jesus Christ or Mohammed." Counsels for the disputing parties may now proceed.

<P><I>The Hidden History of the Human Race</I>, by Michael A. Cremo and
Richard L. Thompson, is an ideologically motivated assault on the conventional
view of human evolution and prehistory. The authors claim &quot;various
humanlike and apelike beings have coexisted for long periods of time&quot;
(hundreds of millions of years, in fact) and that scientists have &quot;systematically
suppressed&quot; the evidence for this incredible notion (p. xvii, 133).
</P>

<P><I>The Hidden History of the Human Race</I> is an abridged edition of
<I>Forbidden Archaeology</I>, published by the Bhaktivedanta Institute
in San Diego, and dedicated to &quot;His Divine Grace, A. C. Ghaktivedanta
Swami Prabhupada,&quot; the implications of which will be apparent below.
In the preface to the abridgement Michael Cremo states the rationale for
this leaner version: it's &quot;shorter, more readable, and more affordable.&quot;
In other words, they hope to reach a wider audience with their message
that human evolution didn't happen the way the textbooks claim, and that
generations of archaeologists and paleoanthropologists have conspired to
conceal the truth from the public. The original book has been reviewed
in various places (Feder, 1994; Marks, 1994; Tarzia, 1994) and, as the
substance of the work has not changed, the interested reader might want
to consult these other reviews for different, if concordant, perspectives.
It is worthwhile to consider the new abridgement because it is likely to
be more widely read than its rather ponderous predecessor (in fact, it
can be found in many mainstream bookstore chains, including Barnes and
Noble).</P>

<P><I>The Hidden History of the Human Race</I> is a frustrating book. The
motivation of the authors, &quot;members of the Bhaktivedanta Institute,
a branch of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness&quot; (p.
xix), is to find support in the data of paleoanthropology and archaeology
for the Vedic scriptures of India. Their methods are borrowed from fundamentalist
Christian creationists (whom they assiduously avoid citing). They catalog
odd &quot;facts&quot; which appear to conflict with the modern scientific
understanding of human evolution and they take statements from the work
of conventional scholars and cite them out of context to support some bizarre
assertion which the original author would almost certainly not have advocated.
Cremo and Thompson regard their collection of dubious facts as &quot;anomalies&quot;
that the current paradigm of paleoanthropology cannot explain. Sadly, they
offer no alternative paradigm which might accommodate both the existing
data and the so-called anomalies they present; although they do indicate
that a second volume is planned which will relate their &quot;extensive
research results&quot; to their &quot;Vedic source material&quot; (p. xix).
Kuhn noted that &quot;To reject one paradigm without simultaneously substituting
another is to reject science itself&quot; (1970, p. 79); and that is precisely
what Cremo and Thompson do. They claim that &quot;mechanistic science&quot;
is a &quot;militant ideology, skillfully promoted by the combined effort
of scientists, educators, and wealthy industrialists, with a view towards
establishing worldwide intellectual dominance&quot; (p. 196). The work
is frustrating because it mixes together a genuine contribution to our
understanding of the history of archaeology and paleoanthropology with
a bewildering mass of absurd claims and an audaciously distorted review
of the current state of paleoanthropology. </P>

<P>Cremo and Thompson are quite right about the extreme conservatism of
many archaeologists and physical anthropologists. While an undergraduate
at a prominent southwestern university, I participated in classroom discussions
about the claims for a very early occupation at the Timlin site (in New
York) which had just been announced. The professor surprised me when she
stated flatly that, if the dates were correct, then it was &quot;obviously
not a site.&quot; This dismissal of the possibility of such an ancient
site, without an examination of the data or even a careful reading of the
published claim, is dogmatism of the sort rightfully decried by Cremo and
Thompson. George Carter, the late Thomas Lee, and Virginia Steene-McIntyre
are among those whose claims for very early humans in America have been
met with unfortunate ad hominem attacks by some conservative archaeologists;
but, regardless of how shamefully these scholars were treated, the fact
remains that their claims have not been supported by sufficiently compelling
evidence. Cremo and Thompson are wrong, however, when they condemn scientists
for demanding &quot;higher levels of proof for anomalous finds than for
evidence that fits within the established ideas about human evolution&quot;
(p. 49). It is axiomatic that extraordinary claims demand extraordinary
evidence. </P>

<P>Cremo and Thompson have little understanding of history and almost no
understanding of the disciplines of paleoanthropology and archaeology.
In the introduction, Thompson is identified as a generic &quot;scientist&quot;
and &quot;a mathematician,&quot; while Cremo is &quot;a writer and editor
for books and magazines published by the Bhaktivedanta Book Trust&quot;
(p. xix). Their naive approach to history is revealed in their discussion
of the alleged discovery of broken columns, &quot;coins, handles of hammers,
and other tools&quot; quarried from limestone in France between 1786 and
1788 (p. 104). In order to establish the credibility of this report they
note that it was published in the <I>American Journal of Science</I> in
1820. They attempt to support their charge that modern scientists are dogmatic
by observing that &quot;today, however, it is unlikely such a report would
be found in the pages of a scientific journal&quot; (p. 104). The <I>American
Journal of Science</I> in the 1820s published many reports that would not
be found in modern science journals. Mermaids (Shillaber 1823), sea serpents
(<I>American Journal of Science and Arts</I>, 1826), and the efficacy of
divining rods for locating water (Emerson, 1821) were topics of interest
to scientists of that era. That such material was presented in a 19th century
journal with &quot;Science&quot; in the title is no measure of its reliability
or its relevance to modern science; likewise, that modern marine biologists
no longer consider mermaids a worthy subject for research is no measure
of their dogmatism. Cremo and Thompson might disagree, however, for they
devote an entire chapter to reports of &quot;living ape-men&quot; such
as Bigfoot, which, even if true, contribute nothing to their thesis that
anatomically modern humans lived in geologically ancient times. Chimpanzees
are &quot;ape-men&quot; of a sort, sharing 99% of our genetic makeup, and
their coexistence with Homo sapiens sapiens does no violence to evolutionary
theory. </P>

<P>Cremo and Thompson's ignorance of the basic data of archaeology is exemplified
by their reference to the Venus of Willendorf as a work of &quot;Neolithic&quot;
rather than Paleolithic art (p. 84) and their mistaken identification of
a nondescript stone blade from Sandia Cave as a &quot;Folsom point&quot;
(p. 93). Folsom points are highly specialized and distinctive artifacts
and, although the excavators of Sandia Cave did recover several from that
site, a Folsom point is not what is depicted in the photograph reproduced
by Cremo and Thompson (p. 93). Moreover, although they have plumbed the
depths of 19th-century literature in search of crumbs of data that support
their rather vague notions about the extreme antiquity of Homo sapiens,
they are not abreast of the latest developments in the field of archaeology.
They refer to claims of great antiquity for artifacts from the Calico,
Pedra Furada, Sandia Cave, Sheguiandah, and Timlin sites, but are apparently
unaware of recent (and some not so recent) work concerning these sites
which substantially refutes (or calls into serious question) the claims
of the original investigators (e.g., Cole and Godfrey, 1977; Cole et al.,
1978; Funk, 1977; Haynes and Agogino, 1986; Julig et al., 1990; Kirkland,
1977; Meltzer et al., 1994; Preston, 1995; Schnurrenberger and Bryan, 1985;
Starna, 1977; Taylor, 1994). </P>

<P>This is a book designed to titillate, not elucidate. The authors discuss
a weathered rock more than 200 million years old which they identify as
a fossilized partial shoe sole (p. 115-116). They allude to &quot;microphoto
magnifications&quot; of the fossilized stitches which allegedly show &quot;the
minutest detail of thread twist and warp&quot; (p. 116), but do not present
these magnified images. Instead, they reproduce a somewhat blurred photograph
of the weathered outlines which do not, at least to this reviewer, resemble
any portion of a shoe sole. </P>

<P>Cremo and Thompson discuss the three to four million year old fossilized
footprints discovered at Laetoli, and note that scholars have observed
&quot;close similarities with the anatomy of the feet of modern humans&quot;
(p. 262). Cremo and Thompson conclude that these footprints actually are
the tracks of anatomically modern humans, but they offer no explanation
for why these individuals were not wearing the shoes which supposedly had
been invented more than 296 million years earlier. </P>

<P>Cremo and Thompson are selectively credulous to an astonishing degree.
They accept without question the testimony of 19th-century goldminers and
quarrymen, but treat with extreme skepticism (or outright derision) the
observations of 20th-century archaeologists. That Von Koenigswald purchased
Pithecanthropus fossils from native Javanese causes Cremo and Thompson
&quot;uneasiness&quot; (p. 164); but they blithely accept Taylor's purchase
of the &quot;Foxhall Jaw&quot; from &quot;a workman who wanted a glass
of beer&quot; (p. 133) without similar unease. The authors are critical
of archaeologists for rejecting the very early radiometric dates for technologically
recent stone artifacts at Hueyatlaco, Mexico (pp. 91-93), but they are
as quick to reject radiometric dates which do not agree with their preconceived
interpretations (pp. 125, 139-140). </P>

<P>Cremo and Thompson's claim that anatomically modern Homo sapiens sapiens
have been around for hundreds of millions of years is an outrageous notion.
Accepting that there is a place in science for seemingly outrageous hypotheses
(cf. Davis, 1926) there is no justification for the sort of sloppy rehashing
of canards, hoaxes, red herrings, half-truths and fantasies Cremo and Thompson
offer in the service of a religious ideology. Readers who are interested
in a more credible presentation of the overwhelming evidence for human
evolution should consult Ian Tattersall's wonderful recent book <I>The
Fossil Trail: how we know what we think we know about human evolution</I>.

<H1>Stephen Jay Gould</H1>

<H2>An Urchin In A Haystack</H2>

<H2>An Interview by <A HREF = "04.1.about-shermer.html">Michael  
Shermer</A></H2>


<EM>How does one briefly summarize the life of an intellectual like 
Stephen Jay Gould in a short introduction? He has been praised to the 
hilt by skeptics and humanists for his tireless efforts in battling the 
creationists, admired by writers and reviewers for his brilliant
literary style, and read by virtually everyone with any interest in 
science, from layman to professional. After an A.B. from Antioch
College and a Ph.D. from Columbia, Gould began teaching at Harvard
at the young age of 26, and immediately set to work to reform his
profession. In 1972, he and Niles Eldredge published their theory of 
punctuated equilibrium, a new interpretation of the fossil record, and 
Gould won the prestigious Schuchert Award for excellence in
paleontological research by a scientist under age 40. Like his baseball 
hero, Joe DiMaggio, whose 56-game hitting streak is considered one
of the most remarkable achievements in the history of sports, Gould 
began a streak of his own of monthly essays in </EM>Natural History<EM> 
magazine. At the time of this writing it is up to 256, and he intends 
to continue it to the end of the millennium. For his literary
achievements Gould has won countless awards, including a National
Magazine Award for his essays, a National Book Award for </EM>The
Panda's Thumb<EM>, a National Book Critics Circle Award for </EM>The 
Mismeasure of Man<EM>, the Phi Beta Kappa Book Award for </EM>Hen's  
Teeth
and Horse's Toes<EM>, and a Pulitzer Prize Finalist for  
</EM>Wonderful Life<EM>
(about which he characteristically commented, "close but, as they
say, no cigar.") For his scientific achievements Gould was made a
Fellow of AAAS, received a MacArthur Foundation "Genius"
Fellowship, and won "Scientist of the Year" from </EM>Discover<EM>  
magazine.
He was voted Humanist Laureate by the Academy of Humanism,
received the Silver Medal from the Zoological Society of London, the 
Edinburgh Medal from the City of Edinburgh, and the Britannica
Award and Gold Medal for dissemination of public knowledge. He has
fought the two "Big Cs"--creationism and cancer--and beaten both:
the creationists all the way through the Supreme Court, and
abdominal mesothelioma cancer, now in remission.
<P>Yet being on top of the scientific and literary world has a price--
one becomes a tempting target for critics, and lately Gould has
accumulated more than a few, and no slouches are some. In Vol. 3,
#4 Richard Dawkins told </EM>Skeptic<EM>: "I think that punctuated
equilibrium is a minor wrinkle on Darwinism, of no great theoretical 
significance. It has been vastly oversold." In the November 30, 1995 
issue of </EM>The New York Review of Books<EM>, John Maynard Smith
concluded: "Gould occupies a rather curious position, particularly on 
this side of the Atlantic. Because of the excellence of his essays, he 
has come to be seen by nonbiologists as the preeminent evolutionary 
theorist. In contrast, the evolutionary biologists with whom I have 
discussed his work tend to see him as a man whose ideas are so
confused as to be hardly worth bothering with, but as one who
should not be publicly criticized because he is at least on our side 
against the creationists. All this would not matter, were it not that he 
is giving non-biologists a largely false picture of the state of
evolutionary theory." Daniel Dennett, in </EM>Darwin's Dangerous  
Idea<EM>,
devotes an entire chapter to critiquing Gould, sarcastically referring 
to him as "America's evolutionist laureate," and suggesting that
Gould's politics have significantly influenced his science. In light of 
these recent criticisms, </EM>Skeptic<EM> asked Gould to clarify  
the record on a number of scientific, religious, political, and  
personal issues.
<P>Steve Gould turned 54 last September, and has recently gone half-
time at Harvard, dividing his energies between Boston and New York
(and between the Red Sox and Yankees, with an ultimate devotion to
the latter). But don't think this means Gould will be slowing down. 
The urchin--Gould's own metaphor of a though exterior that prickles 
the enemy--is buried in the haystack, always searching for
generalities among life's particulars. The essay streak continues, his 
travel and lecture schedule is relentless, and his scientific work is 
now being channeled into his "big book" on evolution that will
synthesize past and present theory. So with that, America's
evolutionist laureate synthesizes his own past and present.</EM>
<P>
<P>
<P><STRONG><EM>Skeptic:</EM></STRONG> I'll begin easy and move  
toward more controversial questions. What essay are you up to now in  
the streak, and when do you plan to end it?
<BR><STRONG><EM>Gould:</EM></STRONG> It's about 256 essays, and  
I'll end it January, 2001. When you've got a millennial transition,  
why not take advantage of it? That will be about 330 essays.
<P><STRONG><EM>Skeptic:</EM></STRONG> In the long history of  
baseball there has been quite a colorful variety of commissioners,  
including a Yale professor of
literature. How about a Harvard paleontologist?
<BR><STRONG><EM>Gould:</EM></STRONG> I have no administrative  
skills. Being a successful commissioner of baseball requires  
prodigious people skills, which I
absolutely do not have. I've never administered anything. I've  
never even chaired a committee.
<P><STRONG><EM>Skeptic:</EM></STRONG> Despite the fact that you  
obviously care little for publicity, fame, or public adoration, you  
have become one of the two
or three most famous scientists in the world, in constant demand  
for your time. How do you deal with that?
<BR><STRONG><EM>Gould:</EM></STRONG> By maintaining a very rigid  
private life. It's funny. Different people have different attitudes  
towards it. That's what I
like about being in New York--it is such a sophisticated city. If  
people recognize you in New York they are as likely to make some  
wise crack, like "Hey Gould, you punctuated my equilibrium today  
showing up here." That's fine and I just laugh back. What I can't  
stand is people who come up to me and say, "Oh, are <EM>you</EM>  
Stephen Gould?" Fortunately that doesn't happen much in New York.
<P><STRONG><EM>Skeptic:</EM></STRONG> In talking to publishers  
about the marketability of science books to the general public, they  
seem to feel there is only room for a few names to be commercially  
successful, such as yourself, Carl Sagan, Stephen Hawking, and a few  
more. Why is it so limited?
<BR><STRONG><EM>Gould:</EM></STRONG> I think there is actually more  
room than that. It really is just a commercial question of how many  
people want to read about science. I think John Brockman is  
basically right in his <EM>Third Culture</EM> book--though I think  
he takes it a bit far since he is the agent of most of these  
guys--but there is a hunger among intellectual people for scientific  
knowledge, in the sense that literary culture's old hold upon  
arbitration of taste and interest has faded and that, in fact, many  
science books have done well and that indicates that the public does  
want to read them.
<P><STRONG><EM>Skeptic:</EM></STRONG> We've heard rumors of your  
"big book" on evolution. What's the status of it? And give us a  
brief summary.
<BR><STRONG><EM>Gould:</EM></STRONG> I've got a thousand pages  
written--it's about two-thirds done, and I hope to complete it in  
about two years, but definitely before the millennium. It will be  
structured like my first book,
<EM>Ontogeny and Phylogeny</EM>. The first half will be history of  
science. The second will be modern views. I start off discussing the  
belief that some hold, that theories cannot have essences. I then  
show that this is almost nihilistic--it doesn't make sense because  
under that criteria the intellectual line of Darwin is Darwinism,  
but suppose it turns into its opposite? If an animal turns into its  
opposite you can still trace its history, but if those who are the  
intellectual descendants of a theory come to agree the opposite,  
then it is no longer the original theory. In other words, I think  
theories do have essences, but the problem of claiming that  
something like Darwinism has an essence is that people argue over  
every feature.
<BR>My solution is to try to find a middle position between nihilism 
and the position of Hull of overspecifying something to the point
where you will argue about it forever. To me, the essence of
Darwinism is a three-legged stool: gradualism, extrapolationism, and 
causal efficacy of natural selection (and therefore variation is only 
raw material and does not contribute through its structure to
causality). You really need all three of those. If natural selection is 
efficacious but works at higher levels, that's not Darwin's
formulation. If natural selection is efficacious but it cannot be
extrapolated through time to understand the pattern of life's history, 
that's not Darwinism either. Those to me are the minimal conditions 
of the essence of Darwinism.
<BR>The interesting thing to me about modern evolutionary theory is 
that each one of these three elements needs to be expanded or
enlarged. It's not that they are wrong--natural selection is a creative 
force, it does work on individuals, and it can sometimes be
extrapolated. But none of the three levels is sufficient by itself  
in its
narrow definition. In the case of natural selection working on
individuals, the hierarchical theory of natural selection is an
important revision. On the question of natural selection as a creative 
force, some studies, particularly from developmental biology, have
illustrated important constraints on the nature of variation. And
everything from punctuated equilibrium to mass extinction theory
provides important revisions to gradualistic extrapolationism.
<BR>So, the first half of my book argues that all three of these
reforms--the hierarchical theory of selection, the notion of important 
constraints coming from the internal structure of organisms, and the 
catastrophist alternative--really have ancient pedigrees. These are 
not new conditions. These are parts of the grand argument.
<P><STRONG><EM>Skeptic:</EM></STRONG> So there is an essence to  
Darwinism, which you identify. What does your revision of that  
essence do to it? Does it change the essence?
<BR><STRONG><EM>Gould:</EM></STRONG> No. It shows that you need an  
expanded and enriched theory that is based on a hierarchical model  
of natural selection, a
recognition of the power of internal factors, and catastrophism...
<P><STRONG><EM>Skeptic:</EM></STRONG> So you see yourself adding to  
the essence of it, not revising it completely?
<BR><STRONG><EM>Gould:</EM></STRONG> No, its a revision. It's a  
different theory that doesn't negate the importance of Darwinism,  
but it is quite different from the ultra-Darwinism of Dawkins and  
Maynard Smith. They want just the straight and narrow. There's  
nothing wrong with the straight and
narrow, it's just not nearly enough to render all of evolution...
<P><STRONG><EM>Skeptic:</EM></STRONG> So, just as Einstein adds to  
Newton without changing the essence of Newtonianism...
<BR><STRONG><EM>Gould:</EM></STRONG> I wouldn't be so grand to make  
that analogy, but in a sense, structurally, that's not a bad  
analogy.
<P><STRONG><EM>Skeptic:</EM></STRONG> When I first entered the  
history of science profession I found that you were one of the few  
scientists writing about the history of science that historians  
read. They really respect you. The
history of science profession is a bit of an old boys' club and  
they don't think scientists have much of interest to say about how  
science is done. But you have broken through because you are  
sensitive to social influences and the cultural context of science,  
so I wanted to ask you how you came to that, since most scientists  
are not sensitive to the biases of the culture and themselves, and  
what are some of the influences in your own life?
<BR><STRONG><EM>Gould:</EM></STRONG> I always had a strong interest  
in the humanities and in history. If I hadn't had an overriding  
interest in paleontology I probably would have become a historian  
because there is no field
more fascinating than history. I don't think I would have gone into 
the history of kings and conquerors, but cultural history and the
history of science. I went to Antioch College, a liberal arts  
college, so
I didn't have the standard science background.
<BR>As for my own cultural influences, mine is the typical story of 
New York Jewry. I'm a third generation in this sense. All my
grandparents were Eastern European immigrants who started in the
garment sweatshops like everybody else--no big heroic tale. All my
older relatives were Yiddish speakers when I was a kid. Then, my
parents made it into the middle class--my father was a court
stenographer who didn't go to college. And then I was the generation 
that was going to make it. That's a very common pattern in that
community.
<P><STRONG><EM>Skeptic:</EM></STRONG> Maynard Smith makes this  
remark about you in Roger Lewin's book, <EM>Complexity</EM> (p. 43):  
"By and large, those who held that selection played a major role in  
evolution were English country
gentlemen, but...those who were not have largely been urban Jews....I 
mean urban intellectuals, people like Stu Kauffman and Steve Gould. 
It's the search for universal truths. They seem to say, if there are not 
universal truths, how can you do science? Natural selection appears 
to be too <EM>ad hoc</EM> for them, just opportunistic adaptation.  
For me,
that's the way nature is."
<BR><STRONG><EM>Gould:</EM></STRONG> I've heard Maynard Smith say  
that and I know what his position is, but that doesn't make sense  
because he's the guy--it is the older Darwinians--who want natural  
selection to be the one
exclusive principle. It is we who are seeking a more pluralistic
explanation. Stu Kauffman and I have very different views on things. 
Stu may be looking for an overarching set of universal, timeless,
structural principles. I'm basically looking for the operation of
contingency.
<P><STRONG><EM>Skeptic:</EM></STRONG> I'm not sure that chaos and  
complexity scientists really understand what you mean by  
contingency. Contingency is just an unplanned conjuncture of events.  
It's not an underlying principle.
<BR><STRONG><EM>Gould:</EM></STRONG> Well, that in a sense is a  
principle, but that's a matter of linguistics. Stu really deeply  
believes there are structural principles which function like laws of  
nature that will generate all this stuff. But there are a lot of  
contingencies in the particulars of what is
generated.
<P><STRONG><EM>Skeptic:</EM></STRONG> Some people criticize you as  
going way too far with contingency, and that you are a radical  
contingency theorist who
negates laws of nature and large-scale forces.
<BR><STRONG><EM>Gould:</EM></STRONG> No, and, in fact, that's not  
my argument. I hope it is more subtle than that. I'm afraid very few  
people get it, but not because I haven't said it clearly enough. It  
is the great frustration of my life because I think I write very  
carefully and clearly. There's nothing
you can do with people who won't read or ponder. My argument in
<EM>Wonderful Life</EM> is that there is a domain of law and a domain of 
contingency, and our struggle is to find the line between them. The 
reason why the domain of contingency is so vast, and much vaster
than most people have thought, is not because there isn't a lawlike 
domain. It is because we are primarily interested in ourselves and
we have posited various universal laws of nature. It is a
psychological issue. It is because we want to understand ourselves
and we want to see ourselves as results of lawlike predictability and 
sensible products of the universe in that sense. Contingency is
important in that psychological sense. Many of the deep questions we 
ask turn out to be questions about contingency because they are
questions about an evolutionary detail--<EM>Homo sapiens</EM>. If  
we were
more interested in the structural laws of ecological pyramids there is 
probably a fair amount of predictability there. But if you are asking 
why <EM>Homo sapiens</EM> rules the world, and you are trying to express 
that in terms of timeless laws of increasing complexity in evolution, 
you've made a mistake. You are looking at a contingent detail, which 
is that humans exist, and you're trying to interpret it by these laws.
<P><STRONG><EM>Skeptic:</EM></STRONG> I always had the feeling that  
you were saying, "Hey look, in addition to these laws of nature,  
which exist, let's not overlook the contingencies of life."
<BR><STRONG><EM>Gould:</EM></STRONG> Yes, and that's why I keep  
using this Gettysburg example. Had the Civil War gone the other way,  
which it might have, a lot of American and even world history would  
have been different.
Lincoln's point about the need to maintain union in this grand
experiment is the key. If the United States had balkanized into North 
and South (and who's not to say more), we might have ended up like
Europe. That would have been a big difference, and an opposite
result at Gettysburg could have made it happen. And that's not a
crazy model.
<P><STRONG><EM>Skeptic:</EM></STRONG> I define contingency as an  
unplanned conjuncture of events, not chance, since the events are  
caused and determined, but their conjuncture is not planned.
<BR><STRONG><EM>Gould:</EM></STRONG> No, definitely not chance.  
There is chance involved, but contingency is the principle that each  
step can go in variety of ways and that tiny little differences  
(and here is where chaos theory
comes in), which don't seem very important at the time, can cascade 
into big differences. There is some randomness involved--one of the 
reasons we have little differences is randomness--but a lot of it is 
the particularism of a set of sequences in which one generates the
next.
<P><STRONG><EM>Skeptic:</EM></STRONG> I think part of the problem  
with contingency is a semantic one. We look for other ways of saying  
it--"quirky,"
"chancy," "accidental"--but we really mean a conjuncture of events
that comes together in a particular way, and no other way, and can
never come together again in that way.
<BR><STRONG><EM>Gould:</EM></STRONG> Right, and that particular way  
makes sense. But it would have played out differently if you ran it  
again only with just a slight change.
<P><STRONG><EM>Skeptic:</EM></STRONG> Daniel Dennett accuses you of  
looking for skyhooks--that you are unhappy with the algorithmic  
crane of natural selection. But what could be more unskyhook than  
these unplanned conjunctures
of events?
<BR><STRONG><EM>Gould:</EM></STRONG> Right, contingency is not a skyhook.
<P><STRONG><EM>Skeptic:</EM></STRONG> This interview will be  
appearing in a special issue of <EM>Skeptic</EM> with the general  
theme of evolution and the specific examination of evolutionary  
psychology. Evolutionary psychologists
look for adaptive significance in our behaviors, and many of them
seem to think that you are not supportive of this paradigm when it is 
applied to humans. Are you anti-adaptationist in the narrow sense of 
Darwinian natural selection?
<BR><STRONG><EM>Gould:</EM></STRONG> No. But adaptationism is not a  
general principle for the interpretation of <EM>all</EM> structures  
and behaviors. A lot of people are calling them ultra-Darwinians,  
and I think that is right. Wallace was an ultra-Darwinian in that  
sense (except what he said about
humans), whereas Darwin was much more pluralistic. There are a lot
of manifestations of it in Dawkins and Maynard Smith, in British
theory, in Dennett, and there is some in evolutionary psychology.
<P><STRONG><EM>Skeptic:</EM></STRONG> When Dawkins spoke at the  
Skeptics Society lecture at Caltech he used the example of the  
computer model of increasing an organism from the size of a mouse to  
the size of an elephant, in such small increments that the increase  
would be unnoticible to a field
observer from one generation to the next. He then shows that in the 
course of a mere 60,000 years you would get this incredible increase, 
and all with good old gradualism. This was an attempt on Dawkins'
part to show that punctuated equilibrium is not needed.
<BR><STRONG><EM>Gould:</EM></STRONG> Doesn't he understand the  
basic principle of punctuated equilibrium--that ecological  
gradualism scales to geological
punctuation? Besides that, such linear selectional sequences like the 
mouse to elephant are so rare as to be almost never found in the
fossil record. So, one of the reasons you don't find that type of
sequence is rarity; the second reason is that thousands of years are 
compressed on a single bedding plane so changes that take place in a 
couple of thousand years--which would seem slow to us living only
70 to 80 years--would still appear on a single bedding plane pressed 
together.
<BR>The radical content of punctuated equilibrium is not the bedding 
plane concentration of the events of a couple thousand years, it is the 
necessity to explain trends by the sorting of species rather than by 
the extrapolation and selective advantages within unbranching
populations.
<P><STRONG><EM>Skeptic:</EM></STRONG> Dawkins says, "What needs to  
be said now, loud and clear, is the truth: that the theory of  
punctuated equilibrium lies firmly within the neo-Darwinian  
synthesis. It always did. It will take time
to undo the damage wrought by the overblown rhetoric, but it will
be undone."
<BR><STRONG><EM>Gould:</EM></STRONG> I think he just doesn't  
understand the importance of hierarchical selection theory. To  
require that evolutionary trends be understood as a sorting of  
selection of stable species, and not as the extrapolation of  
adaptational trends within lineages, is a very
different view. You just don't have that without punctuated
equilibrium because under the conventional model a large scale
evolutionary trend is just selection scaled up. You may have
branches, but the branches are not producing the trend. The
branches are just iterating the adaptation to simple lines so that it is 
more stable. It doesn't get wiped out by the extinction event.
<BR>Under punctuated equilibrium there is nothing about the history 
of species that is producing a trend because they are stable. A trend 
has to be produced by a higher-order sorting or selection upon
speciation events. A trend is a result because some species speciate 
more frequently or because there is a preferred direction in
speciation, because some species live longer than others. There is a 
whole different set of reasons for trends than you get in the old
Darwinian paradigm. We've never argued that the single event of
punctuation, which is just the scaling up of Mayr's parapatric
speciation model, constitutes the radical content of the theory. The 
radical content of punctuated equilibrium is its explanation of trends. 
The theory has made contributions to both evolutionary theory and
to paleontological practice. It was originally written as an article 
about paleontological practice. Its radical content there was merely 
to claim that the pattern is an expression of a biological reality. The 
radical content for evolutionary theory is its contribution to
hierarchical selection models and the insertion of the species level of 
selection and the explantion of trends.
<P><STRONG><EM>Skeptic:</EM></STRONG> On the matter of theories and  
essences, does punctuated equilibrium count as a paradigm and a  
paradigm shift in
evolutionary theory?
<BR><STRONG><EM>Gould:</EM></STRONG> No, but we are forcing  
selection to be considered at the
level of the species and the explanation of trends, which is very
different from Darwin's insistence that the individual is the proper 
level of evolutionary causation, and that therefore large scale events 
are extrapolations of this individual level of selection. So it is
different.
<P><STRONG><EM>Skeptic:</EM></STRONG> Dennett says he would love to  
ask you about this observation of his: "Gould's ultimate target is  
Darwin's dangerous
idea itself; he is opposed to the very idea that evolution is, in the 
end, just an algorithmic process." Is natural selection your target? 
Are you opposed to evolution as an algorithmic process? How do you
respond?
<BR><STRONG><EM>Gould:</EM></STRONG> I'd be pretty amazed if  
Dennett really thinks evolution is nothing but an algorithmic  
process. There is an algorithm, which is how selection works through  
time, but it's never going to give you
the details of what happens, which is where you need contingency.
Darwin understood this perfectly well. The algorithm--the crane--
doesn't give you the details, if that is what he is talking about, and 
there are repeated patterns in the details which you need to know
about, which are not coming out of selection theory per se. In fact, 
Darwin smuggles his argument for progress through a separate back
door of ecological argument--the biotic competition of a crowded
world. When Darwin wants to explain a pattern he thinks exists, like 
progress in the fossil record (a pattern that, by the way, I don't think 
exists), he doesn't do it through the algorithmic route of natural
selection. He does it through an ecological argument. That might be a 
different algorithm. You might even want to call that a skyhook for 
all I know. In fact, he probably would.
<P><STRONG><EM>Skeptic:</EM></STRONG> Dennett also brings up this  
other notion that seems to be floating around, that punctuated  
equilibrium is like dialectical materialism and that somehow your  
Marxist background has led you
into this dialectical theory of nature.
<BR><STRONG><EM>Gould:</EM></STRONG> Tell him to talk to Eldredge.  
It's true, my father was a Marxist so I had that background. But, in  
fact, the idea of punctuated equilibrium is more Niles' than mine,  
and he never had that
background at all, so....
<P><STRONG><EM>Skeptic:</EM></STRONG> What are your politics?
<BR><STRONG><EM>Gould:</EM></STRONG> Well, I don't like Newt  
Gingrich any more than most intellectuals do, and I'd certainly vote  
for Clinton over Dole.
<P><STRONG><EM>Skeptic:</EM></STRONG> You claim that "unless at  
least half my colleagues are dunces, there can be no conflict  
between science and religion." Yet you have led the charge against  
creationism in our generation, so you
are obviously making a distinction between types of religious belief, 
or, at least, what is done with those religious beliefs. And, I am not 
infrequently challenged by atheists that a true skeptic must be an
atheist and that there is no other rational position. Atheists also 
construct lists of all the harm religion has caused in human history, 
and argue that religious thinking is magical thinking, and thus
skeptics must also be against religion as a way of thought. What do 
you see as the role of religion and religious thinking in culture?
<BR><STRONG><EM>Gould:</EM></STRONG> I don't feel that way at all  
because religion as a cultural phenomenon fascinates me too much.  
Horrible sins have been committed in the name of religion and  
Catholicism--slaughters,
genocides--there is no sense in denying that. But these were usually 
done in the name of religion as a tool of state power. But think of all 
the wonderful, saintly, intellectual people that were also part of
Catholic history. They are both there. The church has been such a
powerful institution. How can you, in your anger, just cast that aside? 
You cannot understand the human condition without understanding
religion or religious arguments. Besides, among intellectual Jews it is 
such a common position to respect the culture and the religion of that 
culture without being theistic. I think that is a more comfortable
position for Jews.
<P><STRONG><EM>Skeptic:</EM></STRONG> You would call yourself a  
secular Jew?
<BR><STRONG><EM>Gould:</EM></STRONG> Yes.
<P><STRONG><EM>Skeptic:</EM></STRONG> Are you an agnostic?
<BR><STRONG><EM>Gould:</EM></STRONG> If you absolutely forced me to  
bet on the existence of a conventional anthropomorphic deity, of  
course I'd bet no. But,
basically, Huxley was right when he said that agnosticism is the only 
honorable position because we really cannot know. And that's right. 
I'd be real surprised if there turned out to be a conventional God. 
<BR>I remember a story about Clarence Darrow, who was quite
atheistic. Somebody asked him: "Suppose you die and your soul goes
up there and it turns out the conventional story is true afterall?" 
Darrow's answer was beautiful, and I love the way he pictured it
with the 12 apostles in the jury box and with his reputation for
giving long speeches (he spoke two straight days to save Leopold and 
Loeb). He said that for once in his life he wasn't going to make a long 
speech. He was just going to walk up to them, bow low to the judge's 
bench, and say, "Gentlemen, I was wrong."
<P><STRONG><EM>Skeptic:</EM></STRONG> There is a tension in your  
writings between seeing science as a progressive positivist  
philosophy, and the strong relativist position that science is no  
different from other cultural traditions. How do you resolve this  
debate?
<BR><STRONG><EM>Gould:</EM></STRONG> Strong relativism is nonsense.  
What you want to do is recognize the cultural embeddedness of  
science without negating
what to me is pretty evident--the history of science differs from the 
history of other cultural institutions in that it produces a
progressively more adequate understanding of the natural world
(very fitfully to be sure, but progressive nonetheless). I must
interpret that to mean we are achieving a more adequate
understanding of nature. Some historians of science are close to the 
strong relativistist position, but no working scientist can be a
relativist. Most people think that the reason for this is that  
scientists
are so imbued with this grand goal of finding an ultimate truth.
That's not why. It's exactly the opposite. It is because day-to-day 
scientific work is so tedious that unless you felt that the cleaning of 
the cages and petri dishes every day was actually leading to true,
natural knowledge, why would you do it? If the history of science is 
nothing more than a changing set of views corresponding to altering 
social conventions, why do the hard work?
<P><STRONG><EM>Skeptic:</EM></STRONG> How true. I worked for two  
years in an experimental psychology laboratory with rats and  
pigeons, and I had to do
everything from setting up the experiments and recording the data,
to feeding the animals and cleaning the cages. And that was exactly 
our attitude--every experiment we ran we believed was contributing
to the overall edifice of science.
<BR>Is there anything else you would like to say?
<BR><STRONG><EM>Gould:</EM></STRONG> Oh, I want to go back to that  
political question. I don't want to seem that wishy-washy. I just  
tend to resist labeling by words that end in "ism" or "ian." I'm not  
afraid of the "L" word. I take pride in having conventional liberal  
political attitudes. I think that the
main reason why liberalism is under attack is that is has been so
successful. That's the point Galbraith makes and I think he is right. 
Social Security worked. All these things worked. A sufficiently large 
number of people are reasonably comfortable now, and many have
become enemies of this comfort being extended to the smaller
number of people who remain poor.
<P><STRONG><EM>Skeptic:</EM></STRONG> And to your critics who say  
your politics influences your views on IQ and other social issues,  
you say what?
<BR><STRONG><EM>Gould:</EM></STRONG> Everyone's politics influences  
their views. Nobody comes to social issues without politics. And if  
they think they do, it is even more dangerous because they are not  
recognizing the biases they do have. The main reason why it is good  
to be aware of one's biases is
that you can then struggle against them.
<P><STRONG><EM>Skeptic:</EM></STRONG> So you are saying, "Yes I  
have a liberal bias on the issue of race and IQ, but I have sound  
arguments and I have data to
support them."
<BR><STRONG><EM>Gould:</EM></STRONG> Yes. If I thought the argument  
about marked inequality
were true, it would probably lead me to a conservative political
position, that it wouldn't be efficacious to engage in all these social 
programs. In part, I take the liberal position because I believe it is 
the best way to produce a just and decent society given the biological 
information we have about people.
<P><STRONG><EM>Skeptic:</EM></STRONG> Thank you for your thoughts.

<P><I>&quot;Nothing is more seductive for man than his freedom of conscience,
but nothing is a greater cause of suffering. And behold, instead of giving
a firm foundation for setting the conscience of man at rest for ever, Thou
didst choose all that is exceptional, vague and enigmatic....Instead of
taking possession of man's freedom, Thou didst increase it, and burdened
the spiritual kingdom of mankind with its sufferings for ever.&quot;</I>
-- Fyodor Dostoevsky, &quot;The Grand Inquisitor,&quot; <I>Brothers Karamozov</I>,
Book V, Chapter 5. <BR>
</P>

<P>On Friday, May 24, 1996, the 103rd Archbishop of Canterbury (starting
with St. Augustine in 597), spiritual leader of over 70 million Anglicans,
told 425 civic, business, and religious leaders at the Los Angeles Biltmore
Hotel that &quot;secularism&quot; is the cause of much of the West's moral
woes. Paradoxically, this was followed by a litany of &quot;unspeakable
atrocities against innocent people&quot; committed in the name of religion,
as in Bosnia and against the Christian minority in Islamic Sudan. The Archbishop-the
Most Reverend George L. Carey-told his audience that only faith can stop
these atrocities (Stammer, p. 1): </P>

<UL>
<P><TT>How else can momentum be found for combating the worst excesses
of poverty and inequality around the world? How else can we find the self-restraint
in the interest of future generations in order to save our environment?
How else can we combat the malignant power of exclusive nationalism and
racism? All this requires the dynamic power of commitment, faith and love.
The privatized morality of &quot;what works for me&quot; will not do. </TT></P>
</UL>

<P>Agreed, what-works-for-me morality will not do. But is this all there
is to secular morality? And are these our only choices? Is it true, as
Dostoevky mused in <I>Brothers Karamozov</I>, that if God doesn't exist,
anything goes? Can we lead moral lives without recourse to the hereafter
and a spiritual being who may or may not exist? Can we construct an ethical
system without religion? </P>

<P>The Sphinx was a mythical creature who delighted in posing seemingly
insoluble riddles. I use the term &quot;Secular Sphinx&quot; to describe
three longstanding ethical riddles that must be solved if we are to consider
a secular alternative to religion-based ethics: </P>

<OL>
<LI>The Riddle of Ethical Decisions-How Are We To Act? </LI>

<LI>The Riddle of Ethical Nature-Are We Moral, Immoral, or Amoral? </LI>

<LI>The Riddle of Ethical Freedom-How Can We Make Moral Choices in a Determined
Universe? </LI>
</OL>

<CENTER><P><FONT SIZE=+1>1. THE RIDDLE OF ETHICAL DECISIONS-HOW ARE WE
TO ACT? </FONT></P></CENTER>

<P>As soon as one makes an ethical decision, that is, an action that is
deemed right or wrong, it implies that there is a standard of right versus
wrong that can be applied in other situations. But if so, why isn't that
same standard obvious and in effect all around the world? Instead, observation
reveals many such systems, most of which claim to be &quot;the truth.&quot;
But if there is no absolute ethical standard and instead only relative
standards, can we speak of right and wrong? An action may be wise or unwise,
prudent or imprudent, profitable or unprofitable. But is that the same
as right or wrong? One solution to the riddle may be found in a middle
way between Absolute Ethics and Relative Ethics-Provisional Ethics. </P>

<CENTER><P><FONT SIZE=+1>Absolute Ethics </FONT></P></CENTER>

<P>When I was 17 I became a born-again Christian, not for any rational
or noble reason, but because most of my buddies were doing it, in particular
my best friend George Oakley, whose sister I liked. Still, shallow, trivial
reasons can become entrenched serious ones, and I really got into the spirit
of the movement, going to Bible-study classes, &quot;witnessing&quot; to
non-Christians (trying to convert them), and even enrolling at Pepperdine
University to major in theology (later changed to psychology for practical
reasons like getting a job). </P>

<P>My first inkling of a problem with absolute ethical systems came soon
after my conversion. My friend Frank was really religious so I figured
he would be delighted at my new-found faith. He wasn't. In fact, he scolded
me for choosing the wrong Christian faith and told me I was still doomed
if I didn't switch to his church: Jehovah's Witnesses. The more churches
and faiths I examined, the more aware I became of the fact that they all
think they alone are right and everyone else is wrong. </P>

<P>Most ethical systems are absolute and most absolute systems are derived
from religious sources. In the last 2,000 years, for example, there have
been approximately 28,000 different Christian denominations. Today alone
there are approximately 1,500 different Christian sects, all of which claim
sole possession of the absolute truth. They cannot all be right. </P>

<P>Most absolute ethical systems are based on a simplistic reward and punishment,
heaven and hell duality, a very childlike morality, as Isaac Asimov observed
(1989, p. 6): </P>

<UL>
<P><TT>They assume that human beings have no feeling about what is right
and wrong. Is the only reason you are virtuous because that's your ticket
to heaven? Is the only reason you don't beat your children to death because
you don't want to go to hell? It seems to me that it's insulting to human
beings to imply that only a system of rewards and punishments can keep
you a decent human being. Isn't it conceivable that a person wants to be
a decent human being because that way he feels better? Because that way
the world is better? </TT></P>
</UL>

<P>Obviously the reward-punishment system doesn't work anyway, as the Archbishop
of Canterbury observed, since even the most religious of societies have
an abundance of crime, violence, and sin of all sorts. As Laura Schlessinger
notes in her book about the abdication of morality, in response to a Christian
having an adulterous affair but unable to articulate why this was bad (other
than to say it was &quot;a sin&quot;): &quot;no one these days is worried
about bolts of lightning and everlasting fire and brimstone, so calling
a behavior a sin, in and of itself, just doesn't seem to impress&quot;
(1996, p. 33). We need more precise definitions. </P>

<P>Absolute Ethics, then, may be defined as <I>an inflexible set of rules
for right and wrong human behavior derived from God, the Bible, the Koran,
the State, Nature, or some canon of ethics or philosophy.</I> The problem
with all systems of absolute moralities is that they set themselves up
to be the final arbiters of truth, creating two types of people: <I>Good
and Bad, Right and Wrong, True Believers and Heretics</I>. </P>

<P>This was expressed by that sage philosopher, Maxwell Smart, who observed:
&quot;Don't be silly, 99. We have to shoot, kill, and destroy. We represent
everything that's wholesome and good in the world.&quot; Sadly, such rhetoric
is not restricted to silly television shows. Richard Nixon used this rhetoric
for political gain (in Askenasy, 1978): &quot;It may seem melodramatic
to say that the U.S. and Russia represent Good and Evil, Light and Darkness,
God and the Devil. But if we think of it that way it helps to clarify our
perspective of the world struggle.&quot; In a similar vein anti-abortionist
Randall Terry, founder of Operation Rescue, clearly summarized the absolute
problem with absolute ethics: &quot;Let a wave of intolerance wash over
you.Yes, hate is good.Our goal is a Christian nation.We are called by
God to conquer this country.We don't want pluralism&quot; (in Sagan, 1995,
p. 430). </P>

<P>One might argue that a few bad apples don't spoil the bunch. Immanuel
Kant's <I>Categorical Imperative</I>, for example, is a reasonable (but
flawed) attempt at a rational absolute ethics. For Kant, if you want to
judge the rightness or wrongness of an action: &quot;Act only on that maxim
through which you can at the same time will that it should become a universal
law&quot; (1785, p. 268). Would we ever want to universalize lying, stealing,
or adultery? Of course not. That would put an end to contracts, property,
and marriage. But we do lie and often there are perfectly rational reasons
to do so. </P>

<P>The problem with absolute ethics is that since virtually everyone claims
he knows what constitutes right versus wrong action, and since virtually
all moral systems differ from all others to a greater or lesser extent,
then there is no such thing as a rationally demonstrable absolute ethics.
</P>

<CENTER><P><FONT SIZE=+1>Relative Ethics </FONT></P></CENTER>

<P>After graduating from Pepperdine University and studying evolution and
ethology at California State University, Fullerton (as part of a graduate
psychology program), I realized the limitations of Christianity and other
faiths, and turned to science and philosophy for answers. In the process
I tried out a number of what might be considered relative ethical systems.
Existentialism was appealing to me because of its emphasis on freedom and
individual responsibility. In fact, I found it to be one of the most optimistic
ethical philosophies I had encountered but discovered I was in a rather
small minority in that regard. Most existentialists seemed to agree with
one of the philosophy's founders, Albert Camus, when he wrote: &quot;There
is but one serious philosophical problem. That is suicide. Why stay alive
in a meaningless universe?&quot; Suicide may be painless, as the M*A*S*H
theme song goes, but it brings on one major change I find unappealing.
</P>

<P>After existentialism I tried Jeremy Bentham's <I>utilitarianism</I>-the
principle of the greatest happiness for the greatest number. Specifically
I found his <I>quantitative utilitarianism</I> attractive since it attempted
a type of hedonic calculus where one can quantify ethical decisions. But
by &quot;hedonism&quot; Bentham did not mean a simple pleasure principle
where, in the vernacular, &quot;if it feels good do it.&quot; He specified
&quot;seven circumstances&quot; by which &quot;the value of a pleasure
or a pain is considered,&quot; including (1789, p. 30): </P>

<OL>
<LI>Purity - &quot;The chance it has of not being followed by sensations
of the opposite kind.&quot;</LI>

<LI>Intnesity - How intense is the pleasure?</LI>

<LI>Propinquity - How near in place or time is the pleasure?</LI>

<LI>Certainty - How certain is the pleasure?</LI>

<LI>Fecundity - &quot;The chance it has of being followed by sensations
of the same kind.&quot;</LI>

<LI>Extent - &quot;The number of persons to whom it extends; or (in other
words) who are affected by it.&quot;</LI>

<LI>Duration - How long will the pleasure last?</LI>
</OL>

<P>For fun I used to use the above table in my psychology course to draw
the students into the problems of assigning actual numbers to these seven
values (the boxes were blank), in making a rather simple choice between
spending money on a good meal, a good date (with the possibility but not
certainty of sex), or a good book. The values above are my own (I was single
at the time). </P>

<P>According to Bentham, once the figures are assigned, &quot;Sum up all
the values of all the <I>pleasures</I> on the one side, and those of all
the pains on the other. The balance, if it be on the side of pleasure,
will give the good tendency of the act upon the whole, with respect to
the interests of that individual person; if on the side of pain, the <I>bad
</I>tendency of it upon the whole.&quot; So the book wins out over the
meal or date. But this is just my opinion. To apply the principle to society
as a whole, Bentham says (p. 31): </P>

<UL>
<P><TT>Take an account of the <I>number</I> of persons whose interests
appear to be concerned; and repeat the above process with respect to each.
<I>Sum up</I> the numbers expressive of the degrees of good tendency, which
the act has, with respect to each individual, in regard to whom the tendency
of it is <I>good </I>upon the whole: do this again with respect to each
individual, in regard to whom the tendency of it is <I>good </I>upon the
whole: do this again with respect to each individual, in regard to whom
the tendency of it is <I>bad </I>upon the whole. Take the <I>balance</I>;
which, if on the side of <I>pleasure</I>, will give the general <I>good
tendency</I> of the act, with respect to the total number or community
of individuals concerned; if on the side of pain, the general <I>evil tendency</I>,
with respect to the same community. </TT></P>
</UL>

<P>Dismissing the obvious impossibility of doing this on a daily basis
and being able to even leave the house, it is obvious that you can &quot;cook&quot;
the numbers to make it come out almost any way you like. Doing this on
a societal level is simply impossible. </P>

<P>These are just two of the many interesting attempts to construct a relative
ethical system, defined as a <I>flexible set of rules for right and wrong
human action derived from how the situation is defined individually or
socially</I>. The problem with relative ethics is that one can justify
almost any behavior, implying that all moral actions-from self-sacrifice
to human sacrifice-are equal. On a practical level no one believes this.
</P>

<CENTER><P><FONT SIZE=+1>Provisional Ethics </FONT></P></CENTER>

<P>In thinking about which ethical system to choose I asked myself this
question: how do we know something is true or right? In science we accumulate
evidence and assign a probability of truth to a claim. Claims are not true
or false, right or wrong in an absolute sense. They are probably true or
probably false, probably right or probably wrong. Yet probabilities can
be so high or so low that we can act as if they are true or false. Stephen
Jay Gould said it best (1983, p. 25): &quot;In science, 'fact' can only
mean 'confirmed to such a degree that it would be perverse to withhold
provisional assent.'&quot; That is, scientific facts are conclusions confirmed
to such an extent it would be reasonable to offer our provisional agreement,
as with heliocentrism and evolution. Moral choices in a provisional ethical
system might be considered analogous to scientific &quot;facts&quot; in
being provisionally true or false, right or wrong, moral or immoral: </P>

<UL>
<P><I>In Provisional Ethics, &quot;moral&quot; or &quot;immoral&quot; means
confirmed and justified to such an extent it would be reasonable to offer
provisional assent. </I></P>
</UL>

<P>That is, in Provisional Ethics it would be reasonable for us to offer
our provisional agreement that an action is moral or immoral if the evidence
for and the justification of the action is overwhelming. It remains provisional
because, as in science, the evidence and justification might change. And,
obviously, some moral principles have less evidence and justification for
them than others, and therefore they are more provisional and more personal.
</P>

<P>What I'm getting at here is that there are moral principles by which
we can construct a secular ethical system. These principles are not absolute
(no exceptions), nor are they relative (anything goes). They are provisional-true
for most people in most circumstances most of the time. Whenever possible
moral questions should be subjected to scientific and rational scrutiny,
much as nature's questions are subjected to scientific and rational scrutiny.
But can morality become a science? </P>

<P>To reverse the question, is there morality in science? Of course. If
you cheat, lie, steal and get caught, the consequences are devastating,
but scientific murder is unheard of. I know of no instance when one scientist
was murdered by another scientist. Scientists have been murdered in the
past, but not by fellow scientists. Giordano Bruno was burned at the stake
by the church for his heretical beliefs in the Copernican system, the plurality
of worlds and life, and the infinity of the cosmos. The mathematician Evariste
Galois was killed at the age of 20 in a duel over &quot;an infamous coquette&quot;-love
and jealousy, not science, did him in. </P>

<P>Rarely does anyone go to jail over scientific fraud, but when someone
commits a significant breach of conduct he or she is usually ostracized.
Offenders may lose their their job, and therefore their livelihood. There
is even a government Office of Research Integrity that has become the moral
watchdog of science (see Kevles, 1996). The process known as shunning works
quite well as a moral guide or deterrent. </P>

<P>The test of an ethical system, however, is not in theory but in practice.
Let's see how Provisional Ethics might work for two ethical questions:
abortion and adultery. </P>

<P>1. <I>Abortion</I>. The pro-choice-pro-life debate, leaving aside religious
and political foundations, should be able to be resolved through reason
and science. First of all, we have to leave God and religion out of the
equation since this is secular ethics. Second, we have to leave &quot;rights&quot;
out of the equation because getting into a debate about the rights of the
mother versus the rights of the fetus cannot be resolved. A right is a
type of political contract between individuals and the group in which they
live. Rights are conferred on individuals by political bodies. They are
not discovered in nature. As Jeremy Bentham said (1843): </P>

<UL>
<P><TT>[Natural rights is] confusion, nonsense, and the nonsense, as usual,
dangerous nonsense. The word can scarcely be said to have a meaning. Natural
rights is simple nonsense. Natural and imprescriptible rights rhetorical
nonsense. Nonsense upon stilts. </TT></P>
</UL>

<P>That leaves us with this basic question about abortion: Is it murder?
If not, then abortion is moral. If so, then abortion is immoral. This is
a relatively simple question that science may help us answer by answering
this question: When does life begin? Now we're getting somewheresort of.
</P>

<P>In the October 16, 1995 issue of <I>The New Republic</I>, feminist author
Naomi Wolf shocked the pro-choice movement by claiming that the fetus at
all stages is a human individual and therefore abortion is immoral (though
she still supports free choice). <I>The Los Angeles Times</I> (Rivenburg,
1996) called this the most important article on abortion in years. In the
6,700 word essay, however, there is not a single scientific fact presented
by Wolf in support of her claim for fetal human individuality. Instead
we get references to &quot;lapel pins with the little feet,&quot; &quot;detailed
drawings of the fetus&quot; in <I>What to Expect When You're Expecting</I>,
and &quot;Mozart for your belly; framed sonogram photos; home fetal-heartbeat
stethoscopes.&quot; With similar shortcomings, in a 1995 PBS Firing Line
debate, Arianna Huffington claimed that scientists have proved that life
begins at conception. Baloney. </P>

<P>The problem with such questions as &quot;origins&quot; is that with
life, as with historical events, there is no single-point origin. Life
is a continuum from sperm and egg, to zygote, to multicellular entity,
to embryo, to fetus, to newborn infant. At no time did life &quot;begin&quot;
because it never ended, and surely no one would call menstruation or male
masturbation murder. (See Amici Curiae Brief, 1988.) </P>

<P>We might pose the question this way: when does a fetus become a <I>human
individual</I>? Obviously neither egg nor sperm is a human individual,
nor is the zygote, since it might split to become twins, or develop into
less than one individual and naturally abort. Not after two weeks, since
twinning can still occur. Nor by eight weeks-while there are recognizable
human features such as the face, hands, and feet, neuronal synaptic connections
are still being made. Only after eight weeks do embryos begin to show primitive
response movements. Between eight and 24 weeks, however, the organism could
not exist on its own (Pleasure, et al., 1984; Milner and Beard, 1984; Koops,
et al., 1982). </P>

<P>There is provisional assent amongst most physicians and scientists-i.e.,
it is a &quot;fact&quot;-that fetus viability is 24 weeks of gestation.
That is six months. It appears that it cannot be earlier because critical
organs-lungs and kidneys-do not mature before that time. For example, air
sac development sufficient for gas exchange does not occur until at least
23 weeks after gestation, and often later (Beddis, et al., 1979). </P>

<P>Additionally, not until after 28 weeks of gestation does the fetus develop
sufficient neocortical complexity to exhibit some of the cognitive capacities
typically found in full-term newborns. Fetus EEG recordings with the characteristics
of an adult EEG appear at approximately 30 weeks. In other words, the capacity
for human thought cannot exist until 28 to 30 weeks of gestation (Flower,
1989; Purpura, 1975; Molliver, et al., 1973). Of all the characteristics
used to define what it means to be &quot;human,&quot; the capacity to think
is provisionally agreed upon by most scientists to be the most important
(see Sagan and Druyan, 1992, for a good discussion of the terms of this
debate). </P>

<P>Since virtually no abortions are performed after the 2nd trimester,
and before the end of the 2nd trimester there is no scientific evidence
that the fetus is a thinking human individual, by this definition abortion
is not murder. If it is not murder, then it is not immoral, from a social
point of view. That is, the state should not prevent women from choosing
abortion. If a woman says she believes for personal reasons that abortion
would be an immoral act for her, even though we might not agree on a scientific
basis, we should have no qualms with her decision. </P>

<P>From a Provisional Ethics perspective it would be reasonable for us
to offer our provisional agreement that abortions within the first two
trimesters are not immoral because the evidence confirms that during this
time the fetus is not a human individual and thus the action of aborting
the fetus is justified if so desired by the mother. </P>

<P>2. <I>Adultery.</I> Let me introduce this subject by making a public
confession of what some might consider to be a rather serious breach of
ethics. Last month I committed adulteryin my mind. </P>

<P>Was this an immoral act? How significant is the difference between committing
adultery in the mind versus in a hotel room? Can such mental musings lead
to actual physical acts? Like marijuana leading to heroin, might lusting
in your mind lead to lusting in your body (and thus be considered immoral)?
Why did I commit adultery in my mind? Is it from my evolutionary past where
my ancestors for millions of years lusted in their minds? Or is it from
watching too many steamy Sharon Stone movies? (It wasn't Sharon Stone,
by the way.) I've never committed physical adultery, but why not if I fantasize
about it? Is it because I'm afraid of incurring the wrath of God in the
next life, or the wrath of my wife in this one? Let's see how Provisional
Ethics might handle both mental and physical adultery. </P>

<P>First of all, mental adultery is certainly not immoral since studies
show that &quot;autoeroticism&quot; (as Havelock Ellis called it) is one
of the most ubiquitous of all sexual activities. As an example of the difference
between evolutionary ethics and theological ethics, a medieval penitential
assigned the following penances for erotic fantasies: 25 days for a deacon,
30 days for a monk, 40 days for a priest, and 50 days for a bishop. (I
guess the Pope is not only infallible, but also unimaginative.) </P>

<P>How can something so harmless to others and yet so fulfilling and fun
to the individual be immoral? Science sees it rather differently. Erotic
fantasies may serve a variety of personal functions, including the fact
that sometimes it's a lot easier to just fantasize about a sexual encounter
than it is to actually invest the time, energy, money, and risk of rejection,
failure, disease, or an unsatisfactory experience. </P>

<P>I don't know if sexual fantasy itself evolved, providing some selective
advantage to individuals who had them versus those who did not. But certainly
the ability to fantasize did evolve as a wonderful by-product of a large
cerebral cortex, and no doubt this ability did provide a selective advantage
(imagining the positive outcome of a hunt, or the negative consequences
of a fight). Sexual fantasies are probably a contingent free-ride that
goes with having a large brain. </P>

<P>From a Provisional Ethics perspective, it would be reasonable for us
to offer our provisional agreement that sexual fantasies are not immoral
because the evidence confirms that almost everyone has them, they provide
numerous benefits, they harm no one else, and thus they are justified if
so desired by the individual. </P>

<P>Actual physical adultery, on the other hand, is another matter. Its
evolutionary benefits are obvious. For the male, depositing one's genes
in more places increases the probability of this form of genetic immortality.
For the female, it is a chance to trade up for better genes and higher
social status. </P>

<P>Its evolutionary hazards are equally obvious. For the male, getting
caught by the adulterous woman's husband can be extremely dangerous. And
while getting caught by one's own wife is not likely to result in death,
it can result in loss of contact with children, loss of family and security,
and risk of sexual retaliation, thus decreasing the odds of one's mate
bearing one's own offspring. For the female, getting caught by the adulterous
man's wife involves little physical risk, but getting caught by one's own
husband can and often does lead to extreme physical abuse and sometimes
death. </P>

<P>Beyond the evolutionary implications, there are the social-cultural
problems, such as the risk of sexually transmitted diseases, extended family
rejection, social ostracization, and the like. It would be difficult to
justify adultery as a moral act from either an evolutionary perspective
or a cultural one. (Extreme exceptions come to mind, of course, such as
a woman whose husband is in a long-term coma and she finds solace and sex
with another man.) </P>

<P>From a Provisional Ethics perspective, most moral actors-especially
those who are involved such as one's mate, the mate of the adulterous partner,
the families of both adulterous parties, the community, and the society-would
likely offer their provisional agreement that adultery is an immoral act
for most people in most circumstances most of the time because the evidence
confirms that adultery causes considerably more harm than good and so cannot
be justified. </P>

<P>A very simple experiment to test this claim is to ask the potentially
affected party. I once asked my wife, Kim, how she would feel if I had
sex with another woman. She responded: &quot;How would you like it if I
had sex with another man?&quot; That ended the discussion. Provisional
Ethics can be as simple as asking the other moral agent, another variation
on the golden rule of do unto others as you would have them do unto you.
</P>

<CENTER><P><FONT SIZE=+1>2. THE RIDDLE OF ETHICAL NATURE --<BR>
ARE WE MORAL, IMMORAL, OR AMORAL? </FONT></P></CENTER>

<P>In the late 1830s, in his musings about the implications for his budding
evolutionary hypothesis, Darwin penned this in his <I>M Notebook</I>: &quot;He
who understands baboon would do more towards metaphysics than Locke.&quot;
And: &quot;Our descent, then is the origin of our evil passions!! -- The
Devil under form of Baboon is our grandfather!&quot; (in Barrett, 1974,
pp. 57, 63). </P>

<P>Darwin was the first evolutionary psychologist and ethicist. Herbert
Spencer soon followed with his 1879 <I>The Data of Ethics</I>, in which
he enthusiastically applied Darwinian selection to moral choices. Thomas
Huxley (1899) and Alfred Russel Wallace (1870), however, were skeptical
about how far evolutionary theory can extend into the realm of ethics,
questioning what selective advantage a system of ethics would have conferred
on an individual or species. </P>

<P>By World War I the study of evolutionary ethics was in serious decline,
along with Darwinism itself. Between the wars it was revised by Julian
Huxley &amp; C. H. Waddington in conjunction with the modern synthesis,
but it died again after World War II, in part as a result of the extreme
anti-hereditarian view in psychology and the social sciences (an understandable
response to Nazi eugenics and the Holocaust). </P>

<P>There it lay dormant for 30 years until, in 1975, Harvard biologist
Edward O. Wilson published his 700-page magnum opus, <I>Sociobiology: The
New Synthesis</I>. Ironically, only the final chapter deals with humans
(&quot;Man: From Sociobiology to Sociology&quot;), and only in one short
section, barely two pages, does the reader encounter ethics. But <I>what
</I>is said, <I>when </I>it is said, and <I>who </I>is doing the saying
matters in science, and here is what Wilson said: &quot;Scientists and
humanists should consider together the possibility that the time has come
for ethics to be removed temporarily from the hands of the philosophers
and biologicized.&quot; </P>

<P>Like Darwin's single line at the end of <I>The Origin of Species</I>-&quot;light
will be thrown on the origin of man and his history&quot;-Wilson's one-liner
fired a shot heard 'round the intellectual world. Considerable praise,
but considerably more pain was heaped upon Wilson, including a pitcher
of water dumped on his head at the American Association for the Advancement
of Science (AAAS) meeting in the Sheraton Park Hotel in Washington, D.C.
in 1978. Stephen Jay Gould remonstrated the demonstrators, telling them
their actions were what Lenin had dismissively called &quot;Infantile Leftism,&quot;
while anthropologist Napoleon Chagnon tried to eject them from the speaker's
dais. Wilson let his pen do the talking, responding later that year with
<I>On Human Nature</I> (winning a Pulitzer Prize in the process), in which
he succinctly threw down the gauntlet (p. 7): </P>

<UL>
<P><TT>Above all, for our own physical well-being if nothing else, ethical
philosophy must not be left in the hands of the merely wise. Although human
progress can be achieved by intuition and force of will, only hard-won
empirical knowledge of our biological nature will allow us to make optimum
choices among the competing criteria of progress. </TT></P>
</UL>

<P>The gauntlet was taken up by Donald Symons (1979), Robert Axelrod (1984),
Robert Trivers (1985), Michael Ruse (1986), Robert Richards (1987), Richard
Alexander (1987), John Maynard Smith (1992), James Q. Wilson (1993), W.
D. Hamilton (1996), Frans De Waal (1996), and many others. (See Robert
Wright's 1994 <I>The Moral Animal</I> for an engaging history of evolutionary
ethics; Paul Farber's 1994 <I>The Temptations of Evolutionary Ethics</I>
for a scholarly history and critique; Philip Kitcher's 1995 <I>Vaulting
Ambition</I> for a strong critique; and Paul Thompson's 1995 <I>Issues
in Evolutionary Ethics</I> for a collection of the most important works
in the field, pro and con). </P>

<P>Richard Dawkins' <I>The Selfish Gene</I> (1976) was especially influential
in getting people to think about applying science and evolution to human
behavior, including moral behavior. To the concept of genes as carriers
of information, Dawkins added &quot;memes,&quot; cultural carriers of information
that go beyond biology yet act much like genes in terms of propagation,
selection, and mutation. He even treated religious ideas as virus memes
that, like computer viruses, invade our mental software, destroying our
programs for rational thought and behavior. </P>

<CENTER><P><FONT SIZE=+1>A Bio-Cultural Evolutionary Model of Ethics </FONT></P></CENTER>

<P>It is important to note that Dawkins' memes are not biological. In fact,
in many places, especially with regard to religion, Dawkins is arguing
that memes <I>contradict </I>genes. Clearly there is a distinction between
genes and memes, biology and society, evolutionary history and cultural
history. When did that shift come about? </P>

<P>Just as life does not &quot;begin&quot; at a single point, neither does
society, culture, or morality. They evolved over eons in the paleolithic
environment where hunting and gathering was the way of life for small bands
of hominids eking out a living and struggling to survive in a hostile environment
filled with predators, parasites, diseases, accidents, and nature's quirks.
Morality evolved in these small groups as individuals cooperated with one
another to meet their needs (see Irons, this issue). Individuals belonged
to families, families to extended families, extended families to communities,
and, more recently, communities to societies. This natural progression,
which is now in its latest evolutionary stages of perceiving societies
as part of the species, and the species as part of the biosphere, is illustrated
in the Bio-Cultural Evolutionary (BCE) Pyramid opposite. </P>

<P>I designed the <I>BCE Pyramid</I> out of a hybrid of Maslow's famous
hierarchy of needs and Singer's expanding circle of ethical sentiment.
It depicts the 1.5 million years over which our ethical behavior evolved
in our ancestral environment under primarily biogenetic control, and the
transition about 35,000 years ago when sociocultural factors increasingly
assumed control in shaping our ethical behavior. Keep in mind that this
is a continuous process. There was no point at which an Upper Paleolithic
Moses descended from a glacier-covered mountain and proclaimed to his fellow
Cro-Magnons, &quot;I've just invented culture. We no longer have to obey
our genes like those stupid Neanderthals. From now on we obey THE LAW!&quot;
</P>

<P>The semi-permeable &quot;evolutionary transitional boundary&quot; divides
time and dominant source of influence, where the individual, family, extended
family, and paleolithic communities were primarily molded by natural selection;
whereas neolithic communities and modern societies were and are primarily
shaped by cultural selection. Starting at the bottom of the <I>BCE Pyramid</I>,
the individual's need for survival and genetic propagation (through food,
drink, safety, and sex) is met through the family, extended family, and
the community. The nuclear family, however, is the foundation. Despite
assaults on it in the second half of the 20th century, the family remains
the most common social unit around the world. Even within extremes of cultural
deprivation-slavery, prisons, communes-the two-parents-with-children structure
emerges: (1) African slave families broken up retained their attachment
and structure for generations through the oral tradition; (2) in women's
prisons in particular, pseudofamiles self-organize, with a sexually-active
couple acting as &quot;husband&quot; and &quot;wife&quot; and others playing
&quot;brothers&quot; and &quot;sisters&quot;; (3) even when communal collective
parenting is the norm (e.g., Kibbutzim), many mothers switch to the two-parent
arrangement and the raising of their own offspring (Wilson, 1978). For
this foundational social structure our evolutionary history is too strong
to overcome. Conservatives need not bemoan the decline of families. They
will be around as long as the species continues. </P>

<P>Moving up the <I>BCE Pyramid</I>, basic psychological and social needs
such as security, bonding, socialization, affiliation, acceptance, and
affection evolved as mental programs to aid and reinforce cooperation and
altruism, all of which facilitates genetic propagation through children.
<I>Kin Altruism</I> works indirectly-siblings and half-siblings, grand-
and great-grandchildren, cousins and half-cousins, nieces and nephews,
all carry portions of our genes (Alexander, 1979; Miele, 1996). In larger
communities and societies, <I>Reciprocal Altruism</I> (you scratch my back
and I'll scratch yours) and Indirect/Blind Altruism (you scratch my back
now and I'll scratch yours later) supplements <I>Kin Altruism</I>. The
natural progression will be the adoption of <I>Species Altruism</I> and
<I>Bioaltruism</I> (we'll prevent extinction and destruction now for a
long term payoff), which E. O. Wilson argues in <I>Biophilia</I> (1984)
may have a genetic basis. But, Wilson confesses, this should probably be
grounded in self-interest arguments-my children will be better off in a
future with abundant diversity and a healthy biosphere. </P>

<P>The width of the <I>BCE Pyramid</I> at any point indicates the strength
of ethical sentiment, and the degree to which it is under evolutionary
control. The height of the <I>BCE Pyramid</I> at any point indicates the
degree to which that ethical sentiment extends beyond our own genome (ourselves).
But the pyramid also shows that these two sets of sentiments are inversely
related. The further a sentiment reaches beyond ourselves, the further
it goes in the direction of helping someone genetically less related, and
the less support it receives from underlying evolutionary mechanisms. </P>

<P>To what extent, then, can we derive ethical principles from our evolutionary
history? Philosophers David Hume (1739) and G. E. Moore (1903) described
the problems inherent in the <I>naturalistic fallacy </I>-- trying to go
from the biological is to the ethical ought. The inverse relationship depicted
in the BCE Pyramid helps to explain this problem in biocultural terms.
Consider three ethical issues: </P>

<P>1. <I>Abortion</I>. From an evolutionary perspective one could argue
pro or con: abortion is bad for the species in a sparsely populated paleolithic
environment, and bad for individuals who depend on having lots of offspring
in order to increase the probability of their genes being passed on, to
help in the hunting and gathering of food (or with farming in later neolithic
communities), and aid in child rearing (older sibs become surrogate parents).
But in an environment already in excess of its carrying capacity, continuously
damaged by an ever-increasing population growth, abortion is good for the
community, the family, and the individual. </P>

<P>Above the bio-cultural transitional boundary one could make a similar
argument that abortion is good for the species in an overcrowded modern
environment, and good for individuals living in a complex society in which
there is virtually no advantage and lots of disadvantages incurred by having
lots of children. My friend and colleague Carol Tavris makes an argument
that I think fits the <I>BCE Pyramid</I> (personal communication): </P>

<UL>
<P><TT>The main reason that legal abortion is &quot;moral&quot; is that
the consequence of making abortion illegal is the death of millions of
women. Whenever abortion and birth control are forbidden, adult women die-in
illegal abortions, unhealthy deliveries, etc. (In the U.S., hospitals used
to have entire wards of women with perforated uteri caused by attempts
to abort.) </TT></P>
</UL>

<P>Tavris cites Kristin Luker's 1984 review of such evidence-one early
study found that over a period of 10 years in Philadelphia, when they were
illegal, abortions accounted for 20% of all maternal mortality. And still
today, worldwide, one woman dies every three minutes from a bungled abortion.
What are the long term consequences for women and the species? </P>

<P>As illustrated in the <I>BCE Pyramid</I>, the bio-cultural trend over
the past 35,000 years has been to move toward more control over our biology,
more inclusiveness for all members of the species, and more self-determination
of personal freedoms for all members of the species. For this trend to
continue to the top of the pyramid it is absolutely essential that women
be given the same control, self-determination, and freedom as men. Roe
v. Wade was a giant step toward the top. To overturn it would be to take
a giant step backward in our bio-cultural evolution. </P>

<P>2. <I>Welfare</I>. Below the bio-cultural transitional boundary one
could argue that welfare is a form of kin, reciprocal, or blind altruism,
if we just expand the circle (in Peter Singer's apt phrase) to include
those outside our immediate family, or if we consider the society to be
our family. Above the transitional boundary, however, one could just as
easily argue that welfare is bad because of cheating and the fact that
the group is too large to see any consequences of our actions, or reap
any reciprocal benefits, direct or indirect. </P>

<P>3. <I>Adultery</I>. In an ancestral environment where the goal is to
pass along one's genes in as many places as possible, one could argue for
the moral benefits of adultery. But in a modern environment where there
are extreme personal and social consequences to marital cheating, the argument
could go from the is to the ought-not. </P>

<P>Our nature is determined by an interaction of genes and environment,
our evolutionary history and our cultural history. Ethical theories and
moral choices are a function of both evolutionary drives and personal and
social consequences. Here evolutionary ethics helps us enormously to understand
why we have these feelings, and through understanding comes the possibility
of moral control. Where do we begin? How about with the motto of tolerance
adopted by the Skeptics Society from Baruch Spinoza?: &quot;I have made
a ceaseless effort not to ridicule, not to bewail, not to scorn human actions,
but to understand them.&quot; </P>

<CENTER><P><FONT SIZE=+1>Oskar Schindler or Amon Goeth? </FONT></P></CENTER>

<P>One morning in 1995, when he was visiting Occidental College, I had
breakfast with Thomas Keneally, author of <I>Schindler's List</I>. Out
of curiosity I asked him what he thought was the difference between Oskar
Schindler, rescuer of Jews and hero of the story, and Amon Goeth, evil
incarnate as commandant of the Plaszow camp. His answer was revealing.
Not much, he said. Had there been no war Schindler and Goeth might have
been business partners and drinking buddies, morally questionable at times
perhaps, but relatively harmless and ineffectual as historical personages.
What a difference a war makes! </P>

<P>Humans have the capacity to be both moral and immoral, as Stanley Milgram
showed in his famous shock experiments in which subjects believed they
were delivering electric shocks to other subjects for &quot;wrong&quot;
answers on a test. Ranging from <I>Slight Shock</I> to <I>Moderate Shock</I>
to <I>Strong Shock</I> to <I>Very Strong Shock</I> to <I>Intense Shock</I>
to <I>Extreme Intensity Shock</I> to <I>Danger: Severe Shock</I> to <I>XXX</I>,
the results were, well, shocking: 65% administered the maximum shock possible
and 100% administered a &quot;Strong Shock&quot; of 135 volts. Milgram
expressed his own and others' amazement at what these experiments revealed
about human nature (1974): </P>

<UL>
<P><TT>What is surprising is how far ordinary individuals will go in complying
with the experimenter's instructions. Despite the fact that many subjects
experience stress, despite the fact that many protest to the experimenter,
a substantial proportion continue to the last shock on the generator. I
am forever astonished when lecturing on the obedience experiments in colleges
across the country. I faced young men who were aghast at the behavior of
experimental subjects and proclaimed they would never behave in such a
way, but who in a matter of months, were brought into the military and
performed without compunction actions that made shocking the victim seem
pallid. In this respect, they are no better and no worse than human beings
of any other era who lend themselves to the purposes of authority and become
instruments in its destructive processes. </TT></P>
</UL>

<P>Depending on circumstances perhaps any of us could become Nazis. Who's
to say? Raised in a free, democratic society like America, how do any of
us know how we might react in a totalitarian regime like Nazi Germany?
Holocaust historian Yehuda Bauer made this observation about Himmler and
human nature: </P>

<UL>
<P><TT>The brutal murder of whole populations, including children, has
been with us since the beginning of recorded history and most probably
before that. Sadism and brutality scream at us from every page of human
history, and they are in no way less horrific than the Nazi variety. If
we cannot &quot;understand&quot; Himmler, most of human history is beyond
our capacity of understanding. We can put ourselves in the shoes of the
perpetrators, as well as the shoes of the victims, because we all have
in ourselves the potential for extreme good and extreme evil-at least,
what we call good and evil. Himmler's ideas and motives are latent in everyone's
subconscious. The real horror of Himmler is not that he was unusual or
unique but that he was in many ways quite ordinary, and that he could have
lived out his life as a chicken farmer, a good neighbor with perhaps somewhat
antiquated ideas about people. </TT></P>
</UL>

<P>This makes sense from an evolutionary perspective since individuals
in the ancestral environment would have needed to be both aggressive and
cooperative, depending on context and desired outcomes. Tavris and Wade
(1995), in fact, show that an individual's history, culture, generation,
and immediate situation are crucial in understanding moral behavior. Without
context the search for moral universals is misleading. </P>

<CENTER><P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Problem of Evil </FONT></P></CENTER>

<P>A philosophical conundrum that has plagued theologians throughout the
ages is the &quot;problem of evil.&quot; The following three conditions
of the universe are incompatible: </P>

<CENTER><P>God is Omnipotent<BR>
God is Omnibenevolent<BR>
Evil Exists </P></CENTER>

<P>If God is all powerful, <I>couldn't</I> he prevent evil from existing?
If God is all good, <I>shouldn't</I> he prevent evil from existing? If
evil exists, then either God is not all powerful or not all good. </P>

<P>Since we are leaving God out of the analysis that leaves us with the
final question: does evil exist? If it does, and certainly we are neither
omnipotent nor omnibenevolent, then we will always be plagued with war,
genocide, crime, rape, etc. One solution to the problem of evil was suggested
to me by UCLA English professor Henry Ansgar Kelly: replace the word evil
with bad. Can we have a problem of <I>bad</I>? No. Bad does not exist.
Bad things happen, but there is no inherent good or evil, as William James
noted (1897): </P>

<UL>
<P><TT>Calling a thing bad means, if it means anything at all, that the
thing ought not to be -- that something else ought to be in its stead.
Determinism, in denying that anything else can be in its stead, virtually
defines the universe as a place in which what ought to be is impossible.
</TT></P>
</UL>

<P>For James, to be a determinist is to say something terrible about the
universe-that bad things cannot become any better. But we hold people responsible
for murder. If we didn't, we would have to blame the universe for the act,
in which case we all are accomplices and responsible since we are all part
of the universe. No one would be found guilty of anything. We'd only each
be assigned our share of the liability. Surely few would accept this. </P>

<P>There is only human action, some of which we like and some of which
we don't like, as it is provisionally defined. As the Preacher Casey tells
Tom Joad in Steinbeck's <I>The Grapes of Wrath</I>, after he explains that
he has given up revivals because of the obvious conflict between the content
of his preaching and context of his own sex life: </P>

<UL>
<P><TT>I says, 'Maybe it ain't a sin. Maybe it's just the way folks is.'
Well, I was layin' under a tree when I figured that out, and I went to
sleep. And it come night, an' it was dark when I come to. They was a coyote
squawkin' near by. Before I knowed it, I was sayin' out loud'There ain't
no sin and there ain't no virtue. There's just stuff people do.And some
of the things folks do is nice, and some ain't nice, but that's as far
as any man got a right to say.' </TT></P>
</UL>

<P>So why do some people turn out to be Oscar Schindlers and others Amon
Goeths? Sure, there may be a handful of sick, twisted minds gone haywire
through chemical imbalance or neuronal miswiring. But for most, the contingencies
of history and the circumstances of life lead us down different paths,
as we shall see in solving the final riddle. </P>

<CENTER><P><FONT SIZE=+1>3. THE RIDDLE OF ETHICAL FREEDOM <BR>
HOW CAN WE MAKE MORAL CHOICES IN A DETERMINED UNIVERSE? </FONT></P></CENTER>

<P>In 1985, while racing a bicycle along a lonely rural highway in Arkansas
in the transcontinental Race Across America, ABC's Diana Nyad asked me
how it felt to be too far behind the leader of the race to win. I told
her that while I would prefer winning I had done everything I could in
training, nutrition, equipment, etc., and that the only thing I could have
done was to pick better parents. When that comment aired months later on
<I>Wide World of Sports</I>, I called my parents to assure them I only
meant that genetics plays a powerful role in athletic performance. I got
the comment from renowned sports physiologist, Perolof Astrand, who told
an exercise symposium: &quot;I am convinced that anyone interested in winning
Olympic gold medals must select his or her parents very carefully.&quot;
</P>

<P>From an evolutionary perspective our parents have been very carefully
selected for us -- by natural selection. But we are also the products our
parents' upbringing, family dynamics, community values, education, and
so forth. Michael Ruse, in a paper on &quot;Darwinism and Determinism,&quot;
put it well: </P>

<UL>
<P><TT>[W]e are what we are because of our biology in conjunction with
the environment. Dogs are friendly; if you beat and starve them, they are
vicious. Scotsmen are as tall as Englishmen; if you feed them simply on
oats they are runts. As well-known, long-term study has shownthanks to
improved nutrition, the height and physique of the Scots has improved dramatically.
</TT></P>
</UL>

<P>Out of the interaction of genes and environment comes the possibility
of freedom. The philosopher Karl Schmitz-Moormann, in a paper &quot;On
the Evolution of Human Freedom,&quot; explains that even the most complete
knowledge of a person will not allow us to perfectly predict the future
of this individual because statistical probabilities are built around populations,
not individuals. Schmitz-Moormann replaces &quot;determined&quot; with
&quot;conditioned&quot;: </P>

<UL>
<P><TT>At all levels of the evolving universe statistics might be understood
as the description of freely evolving elements within more or less narrowly
defined ranges of possibilities created by past evolution. Instead of being
determined, the universe appears only to be conditioned on all levels.
</TT></P>
</UL>

<P>To put this in human terms, <I>inheritability of talent</I> does not
mean <I>inevitability of success</I>, and vice versa. </P>

<P>We are free to select the optimal environmental conditions that will
allow us to rise to the height of our biological potentials. In this sense,
athletic success, like any other type of success, may be measured not just
against others' performances, but against the upper ceiling of our own
ability. To succeed is to have done one's absolute best. To win is not
just to have crossed the finish line first, but to cross the finish line
in the fastest time possible within one's own limits. The closer one comes
to reaching the personal upper limit of potential, the greater the achievement,
as depicted in the <I>Genetic Range of Potential</I> model above. This
does not prove we are free, it just shows that the environment can make
a significant difference. There's not much we can do about selecting our
parents. Can we select our environmental conditions to push us to the top
of our range of potential, and, as a consequence, be held accountable for
our actions? </P>

<CENTER><P><FONT SIZE=+1>Master of My Fate </FONT></P></CENTER>

<P>Chaos and complexity theory have provided two important concepts that
help us understand free will and therefore how we can make free moral choices:
</P>

<P>1. <I>The Butterfly Effect </I>-- the sensitive dependence on initial
conditions (see Lorenz's 1979 paper &quot;Does the Flap of a Butterfly's
Wings in Brazil Set Off a Tornado in Texas?&quot;). </P>

<P>2. <I>Bifurcations </I>-- points where an evolving system makes a significant
change in direction. Ilya Prigogine describes the conditions under which
bifurcations occur (1984, pp. 169-170): </P>

<UL>
<P><TT>The 'historical' path along which the system evolves as the control
parameter grows is characterized by a succession of stable regions, where
deterministic laws dominate, and of instable ones, near the bifurcation
points, where the system can 'choose' between or among more than one possible
future. </TT></P>
</UL>

<P>All historical events-from the life history of a species to the life
history of an individual-are the product of deterministic laws in stable
regions and unpredictable events in unstable regions, or what I call necessities
and contingencies (1993, 1995, 1996). Our lives are pushed, pulled, guided,
and influenced by gravity, the weather, supply and demand, demographic
changes, political events, wars and revolutions, etc. But the sensitive
dependence on our personal initial conditions, and the countless unstable
regions in which we may choose alternate futures, means we can act as if
we are <I>conditioned</I>, instead of determined. Prigogine explains how
this leads to meaning and hope for humanity (p. 313): </P>

<UL>
<P><TT>We know now that societies are immensely complex systems involving
a potentially enormous number of bifurcations exemplified by the variety
of cultures that have evolved in the relatively short span of human history.
We know that such systems are highly sensitive to fluctuations. This leads
both to hope and threat: hope, since even small fluctuations may grow and
change the overall structure. As the result, individual activity is not
doomed to insignificance. On the other hand, this is also a threat, since
in our universe the security of stable, permanent rule seems gone forever.
</TT></P>
</UL>

<P>Human behavior is no less caused than other physical or biological phenomena,
just more difficult to understand and predict because of the butterfly
effect, unstable bifurcations, and the number of causes and the complexity
of their interactions. Since no cause or set of causes we select to examine
as the determiners of human action can be complete, they may be pragmatically
considered as conditioning causes, not determining ones. That is, we may
<I>act </I>as if we are free. </P>

<P>A splendid example of the role of the individual within historical systems-used
by Gould (1989) as his title theme but considered slightly differently
here-is Frank Capra's 1946 holiday film classic <I>It's a Wonderful Life</I>.
Jimmy Stewart plays George Bailey, a small-town building and loan proprietor
who, after decades of hard, honest work feels his life has been a failure
because he sees nothing of the results of his efforts. His youthful dreams
of seeing and changing the world seemingly have been lost to age and responsibility.
Further, some of his friends have managed to break away from the small
town to make more money. Others have ventured out to see the world about
which George has only fantasized. His own brother is a decorated war hero
who saved the lives of many men in battle. George perceives that he has
done little. His life appears stalled and stagnant. When financial and
familial pressures finally build beyond control on Christmas Eve, George
decides to take his life by leaping into the rapids of a nearly frozen
river. Fortunately he is interrupted by his guardian angel-Clarence Oddbody-who,
knowing George's humanitarian disposition, jumps in the river before him,
triggering George to save his life. In recovery, George unloads his problems
on Clarence, and then exclaims he wishes he were never born. Clarence grants
him his wish, taking George out of the historical picture and reconstructing
the story of what his little town of Bedford Falls would have been like
without him. </P>

<P>Suddenly things are not what they used to be, and the changes are mostly
negative. The people George helped financially are now poor and wretched;
the buildings he constructed are nonexistent; his wife is a lonely unmarried
librarian; his children unborn; and the town is renamed &quot;Pottersville,&quot;
after the treacherous banker whose miserly ways prevented those George
had helped from ever owning their own homes. His brother, whom George saved
in childhood, is now not in the World War II battle, with the contingent
consequences that the lives the brother saved are now also gone. As Clarence
guides George through these unfamiliar surroundings, he is dismayed and
shocked. The history of his town is quite different without the influence
of George Bailey. He never realized just how many people were dependent
upon his seemingly routine existence. &quot;Strange, isn't it?,&quot; queries
Clarence to George at the appropriate moment of enlightenment. &quot;Each
man's life touches so many other lives, and when he isn't around he leaves
an awful hole, doesn't he?&quot; </P>

<P>In the end Clarence restores the historical sequence to its original
condition-with George's contingent influence intact-and reassures him:
&quot;You see George, you really had a wonderful life.&quot; In this sense,
then, we are all individuals of power and importance. Whether we like it
or not, whether we know it or not, every encounter, every thought, every
action, can and does make some degree of difference, ranging from virtually
negligent to powerfully diverting. A seemingly innocuous decision, carefully
placed in time and circumstance, may affect uncounted others in multitudinous
ways. </P>

<P>But there is some wishful thinking in this tale. Don't we all like to
think that we <I>do </I>make a difference? Such a position is certainly
existentially more satisfying. It is nice to think that the history of
Bedford Falls was contingent upon George Bailey's actions, and therefore
George Bailey matters. </P>

<P>Well, you and I and George do matter, as long as it is early in the
sequence when there is sensitive dependence on our actions, or when the
sequence is hanging in the balance and our actions may trigger a bifurcation.
But systems are not always so delicately poised, hinged to fall one way
or the other. History is not all contiguous bifurcation points, awaiting
the next flap of the butterfly's wings. As often as not (and probably more
than we would like to believe), necessity guides the paths down which we
proceed, oblivious to the majority of our contingent actions. It is hard
to imagine how Old Man Potter could have remained in business had he foreclosed
on all those homes; or that the difference between the town being Goodtown
or Badtown USA was completely contingent upon the actions of one small
building and loan proprietor. There is no question that one individual
can make a difference, but the question of how much will depend on <I>when
</I>in the sequence the individual action is applied. Some of what George
Bailey did-such as saving his brother's life-made a sizable difference
to a great many people. More likely than not most of what he did made little
difference in the overall outcome of the historical development of Bedford
Falls, wishful thinking notwithstanding. </P>

<P>This disclaimer aside, because of contingencies, and the fact that at
any point in the sequence it could be early as well as late (since we do
not know when our personal sequence will end), one never knows which actions
will or will not make a difference. It is this lack of foresight and prognostication
that makes the potential for the power of individual moral action so potent.
Since we do not know for certain which actions will matter and which will
not, why not act as if they all do? It may be nothing but wishful thinking
to desire one's place in history to be contingently significant, but since
we do not know, why not act as if it is? From this belief comes freedom
and free moral choice. </P>

<P>I close with William Ernest Henley's famous poem Invictus, especially
fitting since he wrote it when he was terminally ill and in the context
of the 19th-century push for scientific determinism, as if to say it ain't
so: </P>

<CENTER><P><TT>Out of the night that covers me, <BR>
Black as the pit from pole to pole, <BR>
I thank whatever gods may be <BR>
For my unconquerable soul. </TT></P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P><TT>In the fell clutch of circumstance <BR>
I have not winced nor cried aloud. <BR>
Under the bludgeonings of chance <BR>
My head is bloody, but unbowed. </TT></P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P><TT>Beyond this place of wrath and tears <BR>
Looms but the Horror of the shade, <BR>
And yet the menace of the years <BR>
Finds and shall find me unafraid. </TT></P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P><TT>It matters not how strait the gate, <BR>

<H1>LEFTIST SCIENCE & SKEPTICAL RHETORIC:
<EM>Higher Superstition: The Academic Left and Its Quarrels with Science</EM>,
by Paul R. Gross and Norman Levitt, Johns Hopkins University Press, 1994</H1>
<H2><A HREF = "03.1.about-shallit.html">Reviewed by Jeffrey Shallit</A></H2>

 This is a book with a split personality. On the one hand, it is a revealing
expose of the new and unprecedented efforts by certain members of the
academic left to topple science's dominance as the pre-eminent tool of
Western rationalists. On the other hand, it is an often-sloppy polemic that
indulges in the some of the same tactics it decries.
<P>    The authors (one a professor at the University of Virginia; the other at
Rutgers University) have marshalled an impressive compendium of scientific
misconceptions by the likes of Stanley Aronowitz, Jacques Derrida,
Jean-Francois Lyotard, Steven Best, and N. Katherine Hayles. Indeed, Gross
and Levitt are at their best when they simply let these academic "stars"
pontificate mindlessly about physics, chaos theory, and the scientific
method. There is a lot of lousy science being bandied about in Arts faculties
in Europe and North America, and Gross and Levitt mince no words in exposing
it.
<P>   I am very sympathetic with Gross and Levitt's conclusion that much of the
academic left's problems with science stems from ignorance, pure and simple.
Let's face it: science is hard. It takes years of study and significant
mathematical sophistication to truly understand the simplest of the recent
scientific advances. Faced with this challenge, some leftist academics have
resorted to commentary without knowledge, and others, when unwilling to admit
ignorance, have resorted to claiming that such knowledge is illusory. Gross
and Levitt present the following example from Jacques Derrida: "The
Einsteinian constant [c] is not a constant, not a center. It is the very
concept of variability-it is, finally, the concept of the game. In other
words, it is not the concept of some thing-of a center from which an observer
could master the field-but the very concept of the game" (p. 79).
<P>   Why anyone would think this claptrap constitutes serious academic
discourse is beyond me. (One wonders why Jacques could not consult his
cousin, Bernard Derrida, a world-class physicist whose ideas have earned
comparatively little popular acclaim-an irony often noted in private by
French scientists.) It is, however, relatively harmless, and to the best of
my knowledge Derrida is not aping the Creationists by insisting that his
particular brand of pseudoscientific analysis be taught in the public
schools.
<P>   But Gross and Levitt are not simply content to expose these sorts of
academic fraud, they also seek to "explain" them as a necessary consequence
of leftist ideology. They envision a conspiracy to maintain the left's
alleged hegemony over academic departments: ". . . over the last 25 years the
entire process of recruitment into academic careers, especially outside the
exact sciences, has been altered in a way that lures people with left-wing
sympathies and hopes for radical social change into scholarly young careers"
(p. 35).
Gross and Levitt even go so far as to claim that "such enthusiasm [for
Marxism] is usually enough to guarantee success and even celebrity in the
narrow world of the academy" (p. 237). And they look back to the 1960s for a
beginning: "Many veterans of the sixties are still on hand as leaders or
advisors to radical undergraduates, and indeed, to those who know these folk
well, the trace of nostalgia is strong and unmistakable" (p. 221).
<P>   In seeking where to place the blame, Gross and Levitt round up the usual
suspects: feminists, environmentalists, homosexuals, and blacks. It is
certainly true that extremists in these groups are sometimes guilty of using
bad science in pursuit of their goals. Jeremy Rifkin's tireless efforts to
curb or even eliminate whole scientific enterprises (e.g., genetic
engineering), often based on gross misunderstandings of the science itself,
are strongly criticized by Gross and Levitt. They note that there are some
extreme feminists who attack science as "masculine oppression" and are calling
 for a "feminist algebra" in which math books would break gender stereotypes"
in the process of "affirming women's experiences." If this is the math class
of the future, science education is indeed in trouble. 
<P>   The extreme multi-culturalists do not attack science in this manner;
rather, they attempt to reconstruct its history to include all races equally.
<EM>Blacks in Science, Ancient and Modern</EM>, for example, tells its high school
readers that Egyptians invented the science of aeronautics, and presents as
evidence for this claim the famous small wooden figure of a bird, about which
Gross and Levitt explain: "If you build a copy of balsa wood (rather than the
original sycamore) and then add a vertical stabilizer (not present in the
original), you get a so-so version of a toy glider!" Nice try, but . . . .
<P>   Where the academic left (driven by outdated Marxist theories of class
oppression) presents science as nothing more than a social construction
designed to support the group in power (usually white males), Gross and
Levitt rightly point out that "science is, above all else, a reality-driven
enterprise" where, for example, "the set of plain truths that science (in the
guise of, say, penicillin) works just as well for Australian aborigines (male
and female) as it does on Englishmen (and women)." And, I would add, it works
for all classes.
<P>   Unfortunately, in many places,  Gross and Levitt's prose is barely
distinguishable from some of the more literate pronouncements of Rush
Limbaugh, although the authors attempt to portray themselves as fair-minded
with back-handed admissions, such as "left-wing political opinions are not
especially inconsistent with high intelligence" (p. 82).
<P>   As a scientist, I believe that science is important. But to Gross and
Levitt, it is everything, to the naive extreme of excluding the arts and
humanities, and taking one small subset of extremists and generalizing to all
in that group (not all or even a majority of feminists hate science). At one
point, they even trot out the old chestnut that freshmen in Science faculties
have used for ages to taunt their counterparts in Arts faculties (p. 243):
If . . . the humanities department at MIT . . . were to walk out in a huff,
the scientific faculty could, at need and with enough released time, patch
together a humanities curriculum, to be taught by the scientists themselves .
. . . What the opposite situation-a walkout by the scientists-would produce,
as the humanities department tried to cope with the demand for science
education, we leave to the reader's imagination.
<P>   Having attempted to discuss art and literature with some of my scientific
colleagues, I am not nearly as sanguine as Gross and Levitt about the
abilities of scientists to teach the humanities. And I also know at least one
English professor whose command of science and mathematics exceeds my
knowledge of literary tradition by a large factor.
<P>   A more serious trap in Gross and Levitt's undisguised partisanship is that
it causes them to fall victim to an all-too-common failing: sources they
agree with are labeled authoritative, while sources they disagree with are
disparaged.
<P>   A good example of this weakness can be found in a footnote recommending
the book <EM>Trashing The Planet</EM> by Dixy Lee Ray and Lou Guzzo (p. 278). Although
parts of the Ray-Guzzo book do indeed have some merit, it also contains
numerous scientific inaccuracies and deplorably poor scholarship. In Ray and
Guzzo's discussion of ozone depletion, for example, they claim that the
eruption of Mt. St. Augustine in 1976 "injected 289 billion kilograms of
hydrochloric acid directly into the stratosphere." The correct range (<EM>Nature</EM>,
V. 334, p. 415) is 0.08-0.18 billion kilograms, a factor of 1600-3600
smaller; not an insignificant mistake. One of Ray and Guzzo's principal
sources is an "EIR Special Report" which they refer to as "The Greenhouse
Effect Hoax." But the correct title of the report is "The Greenhouse Effect
Hoax: A World Federalist Plot," and "EIR" turns out to be "Executive
Intelligence Review," a loony magazine published by followers of political
extremist Lyndon LaRouche. This is the kind of scholarship that Gross and
Levitt label as "straight-shooting." Thus, in the process of accusing the
academic left of unscientific or anti-scientific attitudes, they weaken their
position by endorsing poor science or even pseudoscience. (Gross and Levitt
must have known about the unreliability of the Ray-Guzzo book, since it is
explicitly debunked at length in an article by Gary Taubes [<EM>Science</EM>, V. 260,
pp. 1580-3] that they reference on page 278.)
<P>   Other passages indicate that Gross and Levitt's scientific judgment is
seriously suspect when they stray from fields in which they are acknowledged
experts (Gross is a biologist, and Levitt is a mathematician). In discussing
ozone depletion, for example, they refer to the "seasonal decline of
ionospheric ozone" (p. 158). But the ozone layer is located in the
stratosphere, not the ionosphere. It is a minor error to be sure, but not one
that should be made in the process of criticizing others for their
unscientific ways.
<P>   Gross and Levitt also go astray in their discussion of the problems faced
by Aramis, a high-tech transportation system project in France. In their
analysis of a leftist critique of the system, Gross and Levitt state: "Real-ti
me algorithms must be devised for . . . minimizing station-to-station travel
time for each passenger, maximizing utilization of each car . . . . [This
problem] involves all the notorious difficulties of the 'traveling salesman
problem,' the paradigmatic holy grail of combinatorics and operations
research" (p. 61).
<P>   There are two problems with this claim of Gross and Levitt. First, it is
unsupported. Second, even if it were true, it would not necessarily be a
serious obstacle for such a system. 
<P>   The traveling salesman problem (TSP) is the following: given a list of
cities, with known distances between them, devise a tour that visits each
city exactly once and returns to the starting point, such that the total
distance traveled is minimized. A suitably modified version of this problem
is known to be "NP-complete"; the "hard core" and most difficult of the
complexity class NP. No general efficient solution to the TSP is known, and
the fact that the associated decision problem is NP-complete suggests that
none is likely to be found in the near future.
<P>   Now it may be that some suitable modification of the dynamic scheduling
problem involved in Aramis might be NP-complete, and hence polynomial-time
equivalent to TSP. But this is not at all obvious, and Gross and Levitt
provide no reference to back up their claim.
<P>   More important, however, the rider in such a transportation system is
completely uninterested in whether her car has been routed in the most
efficient manner possible. She might very well be completely satisfied if a
routing algorithm is used that guarantees a wait of at most five minutes, or
one that comes within some constant factor of the best possible. Such
approximation algorithms are well-known for the TSP under certain conditions,
and they may also exist for the optimization problem that arises in Aramis.
In any event, "solving" the problem depends as much on the underlying
mathematics as the expectations of the rider.
<P>   Gross and Levitt also do not seem to know that a request-driven
people-mover system similar to Aramis, called the Personal Rapid Transit
system, has operated in Morgantown, West Virginia, since 1975. It operates 71
cars and serves 2.5 million passengers a year. While not as ambitious as
Aramis, the West Virginia experience belies their claim that software
difficulties are the main roadblock to such a system.
<P>   Gross and Levitt are also fond of poking fun at the rhetorical pretensions
of leftist academics; "turgid" is one of their favorite words. Unfortunately,
Gross and Levitt are occasionally guilty of the same offense. Consider the
following: "[Environmentalism] envisions a transcendence of the values of
Western industrial society and the restoration of an imagined prelapsarian
harmony to humanity's relations with nature" (p. 4). How's that again?
<P>   Environmentalists are a favorite target of Gross and Levitt. Some of their
comments are on target (the environmental movement could use more skeptics),
but many are simply silly. They ask, for example, why leftist advocates of
solar power do not evince much enthusiasm for hydroelectric power, but then
misrepresent leftist environmentalists  with this summary of their position: "
 . . . hydroelectric power is rife with demons, for example, men, machines,
power lines, utility stocks and bonds, electromagnetic fields, and artificial
lakes full of power boats" (pp. 160-1).
<P>   Noticeably absent in this list are the deeper reasons for
environmentalists' opposition to hydroelectric power: environmental
destruction, habitat loss, depletion of fish stocks, submerging of buried
cultural artifacts, and, most important, the real danger of extremely large
amounts of water held back by a sometimes-inadequate concrete barrier-in the
1991 Ormoc disaster in the Philippines, at least 2,300 people were killed
when a heavy rainstorm burst a hydroelectric dam, causing a wall of water and
mud to descend on the unlucky villagers.
<P>   In the latter third of the book, Gross and Levitt run out of steam, and
end up making generalization after generalization for which no supporting
data are presented. For example, they disparage the idea that some animals
might be sentient (p. 199), despite the fact that many serious scientists
believe there is strong evidence of this (see <EM>Animal Minds</EM> by Donald Griffin
and the collection <EM>The Great Ape Project</EM>, edited by Cavalieri and Singer).
They offer three possible stances with regard to animal testing (p. 202), one
of which is an extremist caricature, but do not see fit to mention the
position that testing on some animals (e.g. chimpanzees) could be banned,
while testing on other, lower organisms could continue. They claim that
"[m]any college newspapers . . . run astrology columns" (p. 225), whereas an
admittedly unscientific survey by this reviewer found only 4 out of 20
college newspapers provided such a column, and at least 2 of those 4 were
intended to be humorous.
<P>   <EM>Higher Superstition</EM> is a good compendium of extremists' irrational claims,
but its serious flaws ensure that the academic left indicted there will find
it easy to dismiss Gross and Levitt's findings and continue their often
preposterous caricatures of science. And that is a shame.

<H1>WATCHING ON THE RHINE</H1>
<H2>A Review of <EM>Denying the Holocaust</EM> by Deborah Lipstadt.
(Free Press, 1993; Hardcover: 278 pages: $22.95)</H2>
<H2><A HREF="02.4.about-siano.html">By Brian Siano</A></H2>
 
        In 1979 Robert Faurisson, a professor at the University of Lyons,
was condemned by a French court for the "falsification of history." One of
the signatories to a petition defending Faurisson's right to free speech was
linguist Noam Chomsky who,  when asked to clarify his reasons, explained
that the court's decision set a precedent where the state could define what
history was. As reprehensible as Faurisson's views were, it was in cases
such as his that free speech should be most urgently defended. Chomsky,
needless to say, has never endorsed Faurisson's views.
<P>        On the other hand, Patrick Buchanan, former Presidential candidate,
has claimed that the gas chambers at Treblinka could not have worked--a
standard claim of Holocaust Revisionists. Buchanan also made note of what he
called "Holocaust Survivor Syndrome," involving "group fantasies of
martyrdom and heroics," and has argued against the prosecution of Nazi war
criminals.
<P>        Deborah Lipstadt cites both of these cases as an indication of the
influence of Holocaust Revisionists in her book <EM>Denying the Holocaust</EM>. On
Buchanan, Lipstadt writes, "I am not suggesting that Patrick Buchanan is a
Holocaust denier. He has never publicly claimed that the Holocaust is a
hoax." She clarifies things a little by saying that Buchanan's reliance on
Revisionist material is merely "disturbing," and finds "the latitude given
him by his colleagues to be equally troubling." As for Chomsky, Lipstadt
writes "His spirited defense of the deniers shocked many people including
those inured to his antics," conflating defense of their rights with defense
of their thesis, and calls Chomsky's free-speech position "ironic," because
"he would have denied those same rights to proponents of America's
involvement in Vietnam." 
<P>        The fact that Lipstadt makes demonstrably false claims against
Chomsky, but bends over backwards to limit her criticisms of Buchanan,
certainly made me put my guard up over the rest of <EM>Denying the Holocaust</EM>.
Which is too bad, because Lipstadt's book is a flawed, but indispensable
Baedeker to the some of the ugliest lies in existence. Lipstadt's book came
out just after I'd written two columns on the Revisionists for <EM>The
Humanist</EM>. I came to the subject as a researcher, sort of, on pseudoscience.
Lipstadt, a respected Holocaust scholar (she also wrote <EM>Beyond Belief</EM>),
has a stronger historical background on the matter. Given the scattered
research materials on the Revisionists I had to trudge through, it's good to
have an all-in-one survey to recommend to people. 
<P>        Lipstadt claims that the Revisionists have made substantial progress
in having their lies promoted as a legitimate point of view; we would do
well to be on our guard. Back in the 1950s and 1960s, the only people who'd
suggest that the Holocaust was a fiction were the anti-Semites and
conspiracy-mongers of the extreme Right. One such person was Paul Rassinier,
a camp survivor who later developed delusions about Jews. He maintained that
the Jews themselves caused many of the deaths he saw in the camps, and later
went on to deny the existence of gas chambers. Rassinier's audience might
have been limited to the Mad Dog Right, but for Harry Elmer Barnes, a
revisionist historian of World War I. 
<P>        When Barnes tried to apply the same standards to Hitler--that the
Western powers were just as guilty of starting the war, that atrocities wer
comparable on both sides, etc., he found himself without an audience.
Rassinier's ravings gave Barnes the vain hope that he'd been right all the
time, and anti-Semites of the time gained a new area of "research." Another
figure of the time was Austin App, a Pennsylvania college professor who
spent much of his free time circulating pamphlets and newsletters claiming
that the Holocaust was a lie promoted by Zionists.
<P>        Arthur Butz of Northwestern University gave the Revisionists a new
veneer of respectability in his book <EM>The Hoax of the Twentieth Century</EM>. As
Lipstadt points out, the book made a strong effort to seem scholarly,
impartial, and reasonable. Unlike previous efforts, so sodden with hate and
bile they could be comfortably ignored, Lipstadt writes that <EM>Hoax</EM>
"contained the requisite myriad notes and large bibliography that were the
hallmarks of scholarly works, quoting many of the prominent historians who
worked in this field and thanking a number of legitimate research centers
and archives." In other words, it was difficult to dismiss it as crank
literature unless one was willing to check Butz's claims. One could be
easily lulled into considering that, maybe, Butz arrived at his conclusions
out of his own research, and not because of anti-Semitism.
<P>        It was Willis Carto, the wealthy California businessman who founded
the Liberty Lobby when the Birchers kicked him out (they couldn't tolerate
his rants about Jews), who put the Revisionists on firmer administrative
ground. Carto founded the Institute for Historic Review (IHR)--even the
name says "We've got a neutral-sounding title, so yes, we're respectable,
really." With a central clearinghouse, the network of neo-Nazi and fascist
elements around the globe (including Carto's Noontide Press, <EM>The Spotlight</EM>
newspaper, the Liberty Lobby and the Populist party), and a number of eager
Revisionists with some clever publicity-attracting schemes, the IHR was
designed to get people to doubt the Holocaust. They've also been trying to
publish "revisionist" views on other historical atrocities, mainly to
illustrate that doubts about the Holocaust might not be too far-fetched.
<P>        Most notable among the IHR's supporters and participants are British
historian and fascist sympathizer David Irving; Ditlieb Felderer, a Swedish
anti-Semite who mailed locks of hair and pieces of fat to leaders of Jewish
communities, asking them to identify the contents as Hungarian Jews; Fred
Leuchter, an uncredentialled engineer/execution-equipment entrepreneur who
claims that the Auschwitz gas chambers couldn't have worked; and Mark Weber,
former editor of the National Alliance's <EM>National Vanguard</EM> newspaper, and
who maintains contacts with European neo-Nazis. 
<P>        The relationship with Carto ended acrimoniously in late 1993. A
mailing from the IHR accused Carto of becoming "increasingly erratic" in
personal and business matters, and claims evidence that Carto drained money
away from the IHR to finance the Liberty Lobby. (In a November 1993 letter
to <EM>The Humanist</EM>, Mark Weber described Carto's relationship with the IHR as
having been "rather tenuous.") The mailing blames Carto for trying to steer
the IHR away from "non-partisan revisionist scholarship" to "ranting,
racialist-populist pamphleteering." Carto has retaliated by claiming that
the IHR has been run by the Anti-Defamation League since September 1993. 
<P>        Bradley Smith had the provocative brainstorm to solicit full-page
ads in college newspapers promoting Holocaust Revisionism. It was certainly
a clever tactic. If the papers ran the ads, then students would be exposed
to IHR arguments. If they refused, Smith could then jump on Free Speech
principles and cause enough of a fuss to attract free publicity. The tactic
worked; some papers that would otherwise reject ads deemed racist or sexist
suddenly invoked Free Speech, and at least one paper ran the ad <EM>as an
editorial</EM>. As Lipstadt notes, none of the papers had any real obligation to
run the ad, and they would have been well within their rights to reject it.
Why didn't they?
<P>        The entire episode illustrated, more than anything else, the
confusion many college students have over the issues of free speech,
censorship, offensive behavior and historical debate. They were groping for
answers to a problem they knew little about. The problem I have with
Lipstadt's account is that she does not see any reason to have published the
ad in <EM>any</EM> context-- not even surrounded with editorials denouncing its
contents and dissecting its lies. Lipstadt disparages this as the 'light of
day' defense (i.e., that in the light of day the truth will prevail). She
clearly doubts that it has much merit, closing her chapter with the
lamentation that there were some people out there who see Bradley Smith and
his ilk as being the "other side" of a legitimate debate.
<P>        But this is precisely the same reason Lipstadt wrote her book. In
her final chapter, discussing how to confront this reprehensible movement,
Lipstadt explains how her position has shifted. Originally, she writes, she
did not want to dignify the Revisionists with any kind of attention. As
their own habits have demonstrated, they seize upon any opportunity to look
more important and scholarly than they are. But now they have become
influential enough that they must be exposed and confronted. So now Lipstadt
has written a book that, in part, criticizes those student newspaper editors
who tried to expose them <EM>before</EM>.
<P>        Throughout the book, Lipstadt attacks the opportunistic
free-speech-open-inquiry rhetoric of the Revisionists, and urges that the
media be responsible and not give them a platform to air their lies. It'd be
nice if we <EM>could</EM> rely on the media to give us facts and sober analysis.
Instead, it's already choked with lies, ranging from State Department
spokespeople to daily astrology columns. Citing the fact that these
<EM>particular</EM> lies are anti-Semitic sounds a little hollow in this context;
one must also demand that lies (and statements perceived as lies) about
African-Americans, Asians, women, and gays be excluded as well. As ugly as
such lies usually are, I'm probably not the only person uncomfortable with
leaving the arbitration of acceptable debate in the hands of the news media,
whose track record on such matters is far from sterling.
<P>        One must confront the Revisionists on two fronts. The first is in
"opposition research," i.e., outlining their institutional affiliations and
political agendas and goals. This Lipstadt does rather well, and it's the
basis of her most valuable insight. The proponents of Holocaust Revisionism
tend to be fascists, ranging from the neo-Nazi groups of Germany and the
United States, to the supporters of Jean-Marie Le Pen in France, and some
alarming sentiments in Japan and Austria as well. The Holocaust, among other
things, gave fascism a <EM>bad name</EM>; remove the stigma of mass murder, and
fascism can be easily repackaged and made palatable as merely an "efficient
system."
<P>        Now, it is possible that one could doubt the Holocaust without being
an anti-Semite. One could be massively ignorant of the subject, for example,
or unwilling to believe that atrocities of that scale could be performed by
humans. But Lipstadt makes it clear that even these remote possibilities are
not an excuse for the Revisionists; even as they deny that it happened, they
are actively involved in efforts to get another one going again. 
<P>        The easy equation of Holocaust-doubt=Anti-Semitism=fascism creates
several problems. True, naivet of the scale described above is extremely
unlikely, but if the infamous Roper poll of Spring 1993--where substantial
percentages of the U.S. population were willing to believe that the
Holocaust <EM>might</EM> be a fiction--is any indication, thousands of Americans
graduate high school with the ignorance or disbelief required for our
hypothetical "honest' doubter. And the ones who do understand the Holocaust
may know about it in only the broadest, schematic terms; the number <EM>six
million</EM>, Hitler, Nazi uniforms, horrible medical experiments and the use of
cyanide gas. It's the same problem the Creationists exploit. A few
well-aimed questions such as those of the Revisionists can give such people
the feeling that maybe, possibly, they've been snookered. (I suspect many of
the college-newspaper editors whom Lipstadt excoriates felt this way.) It'd
be a good thing if such people could be encouraged to develop a strong
interest in history, but dismissing the doubts as "anti-Semitic" is more
likely to provoke resentment and suspicion than anything else.
<P>        The readers of <EM>Skeptic</EM> may be disappointed when they find that
Lipstadt has substantially avoided the second front, which is a detailed
refutation of their actual claims. One could argue that their anti-Semitism
isn't a guarantee that they're wrong, so a forensic debunking job is what's
needed. Lipstadt does address their claims regarding Zyklon-B, the
feasibility of the gas chambers, and the <EM>Diary of Anne Frank</EM> in an
appendix. And throughout the book, she points out flaws in the major
Revisionist arguments as she's summarizing them. But it's not the debunking
job Lipstadt's admirably qualified to do. It's her area of expertise, she's
better networked academically, she has better research resources to work
with, and she can draw upon the common efforts of Holocaust scholars around
the world. If she doesn't do it, then who will? 
<P>        Although I'm disappointed, I can sympathize with Lipstadt's reasons
for focusing on the opposition research. It's one thing to confront
psychics, faith healers, or Creationists; one can confront their claims with
science, and there's the feeling that something can be accomplished. But
imagine having to "prove that the Holocaust occurred." Between the sheer
enormity of the event, the mountains of evidence, and the infuriating
passive-aggressive pose of the Revisionists, the job has all the absurdity
of punching smoke. 
<P>        Discussing the Vietnam War in <EM>American Power and the New
Mandarins</EM>, Noam Chomsky writes that "by accepting the presumption of
legitimacy of debate on certain issues, one has already lost one's
humanity." The Holocaust is precisely that kind of subject. To satisfy the
demands of the Revisionists for a "fair and open debate," one has to acquire
infinite and fanatic detail on the mechanics of mass murder--merely to
confront people who have no interest in reasoned debate. One can't avoid
being <EM>diminished</EM> as a human being by the exercise.
<P>        This is one edge the Revisionists have on talk shows; while
Holocaust scholars and survivors become more incredulous and angry, they
play up the calm-and-reasoned-reflection pose and complain about how
"emotional" their opponents are. 
<P>        Another reason I wish that Lipstadt had decided to address their
claims in greater detail--in other words, to write the definitive debunking
of their claims along with revealing their political affiliations--can be
found in an essay by Christopher Hitchens, written about former Klansman
David Duke's candidacy for the governorship of Louisiana. After listening to
a Duke supporter explain another Jewish conspiracy theory, Hitchens writes:
 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
     "He looked triumphant, as if a neat answer to a baffling mystery had
   been discovered by an Aryan physicist. It was the same with this boy's peer
   group. Amazingly lacking in any sign of formal education, they were capable
   of being positively scholarly on the subject of the Holocaust, the
   Crucifixion, Wall Street's support for Bolshevism and the Jewish love for
   the mongrelization of the races. (I, who count only the last three of these
   as myths, often had to do some very fast talking.) Somebody, in other words,
   has been putting in some steady work down here."
</BLOCKQUOTE>
 
        Butz's <EM>Hoax</EM> has become a classic of its kind. Lipstadt even
compares it to the infamous <EM>Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion</EM> for
its staying power among anti-Semites, and I think Hitchens' account provides
a vivid illustration why. It provides readers with a catalog of
scholarly-sounding arguments that allow them to quash the "popular wisdom,"
and it helps them tell themselves that they're better informed and more
critical than the rest of the herd.
<P>        One of the reasons I wrote about the Revisionists in <EM>the Humanist</EM>
was because I saw them as a clear danger to the overlapping community of
skeptics, humanists, and freethinkers. There is an alarming similarity in
the rhetoric. The Revisionists continually claim to be the dispassionate,
facts-only researchers, and their leading lights are invariably heroic
figures standing tall against the "political correctness" of the Holocaust.
They're fond of characterizing the Holocaust as a kind of "religion," and
religious people, of course, are supposedly motivated by unreason and
emotion. (A recent <EM>Free Inquiry</EM> cover asked if religion was a form of
insanity.) They tend to cite each other's works as the definitive
"debunking" of this or that claim. Claims with a superficial resemblance are
used to debunk each other; i.e., if court witnesses have been shown to be
unreliable, then the accounts of Holocaust survivors are <EM>ipso facto</EM>
fantasy.
<P>        And their writings appeal to those who want to see themselves as
smarter than the Great Unwashed; <EM>All those others place heartfelt belief in
this silly myth, but thanks to this easy guide, I can easily debunk their
cherished beliefs.</EM> There's not a high level of tolerance for sentiment
here, either; the humane desire not to injure or offend a persecuted
minority is regarded as a coercive instrument to be ignored. I think my
concern is justified, if only for the reason that the first critical letters
I've received over my <EM>Humanist</EM> columns were from "freethinkers" who felt I
should be "questioning" the Holocaust instead of insulting the Revisionists.
<P>        I also have a problem with Lipstadt's choice of the word "denial" to
characterize the Revisionists. She claims that to adopt their terminology
and call them <EM>revisionists</EM> is to give them unwarranted legitimacy. (I
agree, and in my <EM>Humanist</EM> columns, I chose the term <EM>Holohoaxers</EM>, a
nicely-derogatory term that adopts their continued reference to the
"Holohoax.")
<P>        "Denial" has a cachet in the popular wisdom, summoning up a
psychological mindset driven by fear, anxiety, and some form of familial
dysfunction; one has the feeling Lipstadt chose it specifically for this
reason. But Lipstadt's book makes it clear that the Revisionists are driven
by a fascist agenda and by anti-Semitism, not "denial." And the word has a
cultural loading that's troubling to the skeptics' community. While
interviewing a therapist known for working with "Satanic Ritual Abuse"
survivors, I asked for her opinion of people who doubted the existence of
nationwide conspiracies of baby-slaughtering Devil worshippers. I was told
that "well, there are people who doubt the Holocaust, too." UFO abductee
therapist John Mack has also compared skeptics of his particular claims to
Holocaust "Deniers."
<P>        Early on, Lipstadt writes that "Denial of an individual's or a
group's persecution, degradation, and suffering is the ultimate cruelty--on
some level worse than the persecution itself. Those who have not experienced
the Holocaust or the sting of antisemitism may find it difficult to
understand the vulnerability it endangers [sic] in the victim." Again, I
wish Lipstadt wouldn't use the same rhetoric found among UFO abductees or
the more questionable "ritual abuse survivors." It gives proponents of some
very questionable claims a rhetorical weapon and, I think, trivializes the
Holocaust by making it another pop-psychology trauma.
<P>        I'm also suspicious of this argument that only one particular kind
of suffering gives people the required emotional insights. It seems to imply
that non-Jews are incapable of having a legitimate understanding. This is
like saying that the "lessons of the Holocaust" apply solely to Jews and
anti-Semitism, when millions of others perished in the camps as well. This
leads us into the tricky terrain of the Lessons of the Holocaust, and since
confronting the Revisionists is such an impertaive, we must venture here as
well.
<P>        The Holocaust is "unique" for many reasons. It's not just because of
the number of people killed: mass murders with comparable or higher numbers
(the Ukranian famines under Stalin, the African slave trade, the wars
against Native American nations, the extermination of Armenians under the
Turks) didn't have a similar ideological pathology driving them, and the
coldly technological approach of using gas chambers has no real parallel in
history. The Holocaust also exists in <EM>living memory</EM> among Americans. Not
only have many survivors emigrated here, but a great number of prominent
American intellectuals are also Jews. The Holocaust exists in America as a
tool, a standard for gauging oppression, horror, and evil.
<P>        The problem with such tools is that they become blunted and broken
with unskilled use. Oppression and atrocities may be played up over
similarities to the Holocaust. . .  or played down because they're not
similar <EM>enough</EM>. For example, the late 1970s provided a slew of articles
over the "autogenocide" of Cambodians under Pol Pot. (Five years later, the
United States was supporting the Khmer Rouge, sponsoring its entry to the
United Nations, and comparisons to Hitler were forgotten.) "Ethnic
cleansing" in Bosnia attracts strong comparisons to the exterminations of
Jews, including <EM>Newsweek</EM>'s publication of excerpts of the "Bosnian Anne
Frank's" diary.
<P>        In a booklet on the Revisionists titled <EM>Hitler's Apologists</EM>, the
Anti-Defamation League cites as an example of "Holocaust distortion"
comparisons between the Holocaust and Israel's response to the Palestinian
<EM>intifada</EM> of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Several editorial writers and
cartoonists either wrote or drew parallels between the actions of Israel and
those of Nazi Germany, usually playing up the "historical irony" aspects.
This, according to the ADL, is an "outrageous distortion" of history. One
might quarrel with details over the analogies, but to lump editorial
cartoonists with neo-Nazi Revisionists isn't legitimate.
<P>        Occasionally one runs across an exclusivity over the Holocaust among
some Jewish scholars. For example, a now-notorious 1990 editorial by Edward
Alexander in <EM>Congress Monthly</EM> referred to "every exploded fiction about
the Holocaust--ranging from the notion that not only Jews but also Poles,
Gypsies, Communists, and homosexuals were chosen by the Nazis for
annihilation." Statements like this are catnip to the Revisionists, who love
to claim that Jews perpetuate the "Holohoax" for moral and financial gain.
<P>        Some of the fuel for black anti-Semitism comes, in part, from
resentment over the fact that many Jews cite the Holocaust as evidence of a
"victim" status--despite their having succeeded in America as much as any
other "white" ethnic group, while racism still affects the lives of millions
of American blacks. The decline of anti-Semitism among whites in post-war
America can be attributed in part to the Holocaust, but no comparable
decline in racism has occurred within living memory. Louis Farrakhan's
speeches about the sufferings of Africans under slavery, complete with
estimates of millions killed, is an effort to appropriate the specific moral
power of the Holocaust. The lie that Jews ran the slave trade adds a nasty
irony to the gambit as well--the same 'irony' that would apply if people
believe the Jews had 'put one over' on everyone else.
<P>        Lipstadt addresses historical comparisons only as far as the
Revisionists try to equate the Holocaust with lesser evils. In what she
calls the use of "immoral equivalencies," several Revisionists have tried to
argue that the Holocaust isn't much different from less-publicized
atrocities committed by the Allies in wartime. The firebombing of Dresden,
the use of atomic weapons at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and the internment of
Japanese-Americans are consistent favorites. Why be so upset at the
Holocaust, the Revisionists argue, when there was so much other death and
destruction inflicted by the Allies as well? 
<P>        Now, it's true that history is grist for the propagandist's mill,
and a lot of respectable history has been written through the debunkings of
older myths. The Revisionists are merely clever opportunists when it comes
to pointing out the double-standard--the giveaway is the implication that
atrocities are, overall, <EM>nothing special</EM>. Lipstadt's point about their
attempt to rehabilitate fascism is clearest here.
<P>        But this leaves Lipstadt in a bind as well, if only in her zeal to
discredit the drawing of such analogies as a Revisionist gambit. If the
Holocaust is to have any moral lesson for humankind as a whole, it really
<EM>can't</EM> be so unique that nothing can be compared with it. One has to be
able to draw analogies to the present, which always provides warning signs
for a far more horrendous future. The only lesson of the Holocaust that
makes any sense to me is that people are capable of great evil, and the only
prevention lies in constant vigilance, bravery, and a true internationalist
spirit. It's not as stirring as "Six million dead, never again," but sadly,
brotherly love just doesn't have much pizazz these days.
<P>        Despite my criticisms, Lipstadt's <EM>Denying the Holocaust</EM> is a
valuable contribution to the Watch on the Rhine. It's a good overall history
of the Revisionist movement, and even when more detailed debunkings are
published, Lipstadt's book will still be a standard reference on the
subject. The Revisionists are supple dancers around the truth. But they'll
have to work hard to get around Lipstadt's indictment.

<H1>Scientology Loses Judgement in Internet Case</H1>

Following up the story by Jim Lippard and Jeff Jacobsen in the last
issue of <EM>Skeptic</EM> (<A HREF = "03.3.jl-jj-scientology.html">"Scientology
v. the Internet"</A>), on September 15, 1995, Federal District Judge Brinkema
threw out the injunction and vacated the writ of seizure against
Arnaldo Lerma who was raided by Scientology on August 12 for alleged
copyright violations.  The judge ordered all materials returned.
On September 12, a Federal District Judge in Denver made a similar
ruling about the two raids that were conducted there a week after the
raid on Lerma, in which hundreds of computer disks were confiscated.
<P>The <A HREF = "http://www.cybercom.net/~rnewman/scientology/media/nyt-8.20.95"><EM>New York Times</EM> reported on August 20</A>:  "To read what the
Church of Scientology calls the seventh level of spirituality, the
church's scriptures instruct followers to go to zoos and parks and
commuicate with plants and animals and go to train stations to put
thoughts in the minds of strangers."  The <EM>Times</EM> reprinted
the two posted documents from Scientology's OT 7-48:  "1. Find some
plants, trees, etc. and communicate to them individually until you
know they received your communication.  2. Go to a zoo or a place with
many types of life and communicate with each of them until you know
the communication is received and, if possible, returned."
<P>Helena
K. Kobrin, an attorney for the church, concluded:  "The decision yesterday
was a very sad day for intellectual property owners and a very sad
day for the Internet.  A ruling like this is going to end up creating
Congressional interest in making more rules for the Internet."  The
church plans to appeal the decisions.  [Note: The U.S. Supreme Court
denied the appeals, which were on the defendants' motions to return
their seized materials and throw out restraining orders.  The cases
themselves have yet to go to trial. -jjl]
<P>Meanwhile, Wollersheim and
Penny, in Denver, claim they were given two replacement computer
disk drives and replacement floppy disks with much of the original
material deleted.  One CD-ROM was not returned at all.  Judge Kane
threatened to hold the church in contempt, but decided instead to
appoint a computer science professor at the University of Colorado,
Gary Nutt, to determine if the computer equipment or disks were modified
in any way.

<H1>DARWIN'S DANGEROUS DISCIPLE
<BR>An Interview With Richard Dawkins</H1>
<H2><A HREF = "03.4.about-miele.html">By Frank Miele</A></H2>

<EM>Richard Dawkins, fellow of New College, Oxford, is one of the leading 
thinkers in modern evolutionary biology. He is also one of the best writers on 
the subject. His books </EM>The Selfish Gene<EM> (1976; expanded, 2nd edition, 
1989), </EM>The Extended Phenotype<EM> (1982, 1989), </EM>The Blind 
Watchmaker<EM> (1986), and now </EM>River Out of Eden<EM> in the Brockman 
Science Masters Series (Basic Books, 1995), have introduced the terms "Blind 
Watchmaker," "Selfish Genes," "Memes," "Green Beards," "Biomorphs," "Arms Races, 
Sheriff Genes, and Outlaw Genes," and "Mind Viruses" to both professional and 
popular audiences. The </EM>New York Times<EM> has described his books as "the 
sort of popular science writing that makes the reader feel like a genius." While 
in California this summer, Dawkins spoke before the Human Behavior and Evolution 
Society on the "Evolution of Perceptual Models," and at the Skeptics Society on 
the "Fallacies of Creationism." He also took time to speak with </EM>Skeptic<EM> 
magazine on the triumphs, limitations, uses, and abuses of Darwinism. Never one 
to shy away from controversy, here is what the man Wired magazine termed "the 
Bad Boy of Evolution" had to say to </EM>Skeptic<EM> about Darwinism, extra-
terrestrial life, religion as a virus of the mind, morality, politics, 
punctuated equilibrium, and the future of evolutionary biology.</EM>

<P><STRONG><EM>Skeptic:</EM></STRONG>
In your latest book, <EM>River Out of Eden</EM>, which is a best seller in the 
UK, you use deep-sea bacteria that metabolize sulfur (rather than oxygen) to 
illustrate how evolution takes place in a series of successive steps. Does the 
existence here on Earth of an alternative metabolic "fuel," in some sense make 
it more probable that there could be life elsewhere in the universe, perhaps 
using a different base than carbon?
<BR><STRONG><EM>Dawkins:</EM></STRONG>
That's surely got to be right, hasn't it? You can speculate in a science fiction 
way about alternative biochemistries for life, but if you couldn't find anything 
on Earth moving ever so slightly towards an alternative biochemistry, that would 
argue against the idea. But when you do find an alternative biochemistry for 
life here on Earth, that makes it more plausible that somewhere else in the 
universe there's got to be an alternative form of life. 

<P><STRONG><EM>Skeptic:</EM></STRONG>
What then is the sine qua non of life? What raw materials and conditions are 
necessary for life to exist?
<BR><STRONG><EM>Dawkins:</EM></STRONG>
Well, you need raw materials that can self-replicate. I would have to be more of 
a chemist than I am to know how likely it is that you are going to get such 
molecules. I should very much like to direct chemists toward devising an 
alternative hypothetical chemistry that supports self-replication, a whole 
alternative system that could, in principle, give rise to life. The fundamental 
principle that will be required is self-replication. Chemists have begun to look 
at auto-catalytic functions in chemistry where at least some of the 
prerequisites are present. The sine qua non, as you say, is self-replication. I 
don't know how difficult it would be to achieve that chemically. 

<P><STRONG><EM>Skeptic:</EM></STRONG>
How likely do you think it is that "intelligent" life exists somewhere else in 
the universe?
<BR><STRONG><EM>Dawkins:</EM></STRONG>
At first glance, one might think that the really difficult step is getting life 
at all. Then once natural selection has gotten going (since the origin of life 
is really the origin of natural selection), you can proceed by an orderly 
progressive sequence through the evolution of some kind of information 
processing apparatus on to intelligence. On the other hand, if you look at 
what's actually happened on this planet, it probably took less than a billion 
years from the origin of the planet, under fairly unfavorable initial 
conditions, to produce life. But intelligence of a high order has only come 
about in the last couple of million years, perhaps. So it does seem that on this 
planet at least there has been a rather short interval from the origin of the 
planet to the origin of life and then a very, very long interval between the 
origin of life and the origin of intelligence.

<P><STRONG><EM>Skeptic:</EM></STRONG>
Are you then saying that the origin of intelligence is the bigger step?
<BR><STRONG><EM>Dawkins:</EM></STRONG>
It's not my inclination to say that, but this disparity in time scale is the 
only data we have. We only have one sample--life on this planet. But for that 
fact, my personal inclination would have been to suggest that the origin of 
intelligence is not that difficult once you've got life. I'm quite intrigued by 
the thought that maybe it's the origin of life that's not that difficult. 

<P><STRONG><EM>Skeptic:</EM></STRONG>
If so, what are the defining qualities of such "intelligence?" I'm thinking here 
of concepts such as Immanuel Kant's list of apriori ideas--time and space, 
number, cause and effect. Could, for example, a form of life evolve in whose 
mental map time's arrow went backwards, or in no specific direction?
<BR><STRONG><EM>Dawkins:</EM></STRONG>
As for what one means by intelligence, I haven't really thought about that. You 
posed the hypothetical question, "Could there be a life form whose concept of 
time goes backward?" I can't imagine what that would look like. But I haven't 
thought about it enough. 

<P><STRONG><EM>Skeptic:</EM></STRONG>
Of other species we know about here on Earth, we're very familiar with cats and 
dogs. I was always amazed (and delighted) how my dogs could coexist with me 
given that their set of sensory inputs was so different from mine--they see in 
black and white, not in 3D; they use scent and vision in approximately opposite 
proportions. Yet they can come up with an equivalent map of the world so that 
they can fetch the paper, protect us from intruders, comfort us in distress. 
What does this tell us about the evolutionary process and how it molds not only 
the bodies but the cognitive maps of different species?
<BR><STRONG><EM>Dawkins:</EM></STRONG>
That's an intriguing point. One thing you could say about dogs is that they have 
been domesticated, and a good deal of the domestication has been an inadvertent 
selection for coexisting with humans. While their wild ancestors, the wolves, do 
have facial expressions and other gestures which they use to communicate with 
each other, it's probable that domestic dogs have been selected to have more 
human feelings and facial expressions. So while dogs don't smile, they do other 
things with their eyes that appeal to humans. Maybe they have been shaped to be 
a bit less wolf-like and a bit more human-like, not by deliberate artificial 
selection, but by artificial selection nonetheless. 

<P><STRONG><EM>Skeptic:</EM></STRONG>
In the 1930s, von Uexk&uuml;ll used the term Umwelt to describe the different 
"real worlds" that animals construct based upon their differing sensory systems. 
He even built mechanical devices to try and create their perceptual 
Weltanschauungen. He manufactured optical devices to simulate the compound eyes 
of insects to allow one to see "what they saw." With virtual reality now a 
reality, we could certainly do such things at a more sophisticated level than 
von Uexk&uuml;ll did. Do you think this might be a potentially valuable line of 
research?
<BR><STRONG><EM>Dawkins:</EM></STRONG>
Von Uexk&uuml;ll used the concept of the Umwelt to explore the differences 
between the perceptual worlds of different animals. He tried to find a way to 
"think himself into" the Umwelt (the perceptual world) of a bee or a bat, for 
example, by seeing the polarization of light or by seeing into the ultraviolet 
range of the spectrum and thus probably not seeing images as we see images at 
all. I think it' s a very important thing to do that, partly as a metaphor for 
"getting outside yourself" and seeing another point of view. We have an 
immensely human-centered view of things such as ethics and morality. Even if we 
pay lip service to being evolutionists, many people still think according to the 
Judeo-Christian view that all things have been put on Earth for the benefit of 
humanity and that the only justification for scientific research is if it 
benefits humanity. I think it's a salutary lesson to try to "think yourself 
into" the Umwelt of another species. But as I said in my talk last night before 
the Human Behavior and Evolution Society, I suspect that the perceptual world of 
other species possibly may not be as different from our own as you might think, 
even though they get their information through different physical media. 

<P><STRONG><EM>Skeptic:</EM></STRONG>
So then doesn't natural selection force us to assume that time's arrow flies in 
a certain direction? Doesn't natural selection force us to operate on the basis 
of Kant's a priori ideas and Piaget's operations?
<BR><STRONG><EM>Dawkins:</EM></STRONG>
Yes, I agree with that. 

<P><STRONG><EM>Skeptic:</EM></STRONG>
In your speech the other night you said that the perceptual systems of animals 
represent the world as their near, or possibly even far, ancestors constructed 
them based upon natural selection. Can the world evolve faster than the sensory 
systems of the animals? Are many animals living today in a sensory world that no 
longer exists, as when the moth flies into the candle flame?
<BR><STRONG><EM>Dawkins:</EM></STRONG>
When a moth flies into a candle flame presumably it is responding to the candle 
flame as if were a celestial object at optical infinity and acting appropriately 
to that situation, not the one it is in fact currently facing. It frequently 
happens that the real world evolves faster than an animal's cognitive map of it. 

<P><STRONG><EM>Skeptic:</EM></STRONG>
Does that ever happen to human beings?
<BR><STRONG><EM>Dawkins:</EM></STRONG>
Human beings are completely surrounded by the equivalent of "candle flames." 
Notorious examples are our desire for sugar and fat--in nature the rule is, 
whenever you can get them, eat them. But when there's a surplus of those 
substance, they become bad for you. Most of what we strive for in our modern 
life uses the apparatus of goal seeking that was originally set up to seek goals 
in the state of nature. But now the goal-seeking apparatus has been switched to 
different goals, like making money or hedonistic pleasures of one sort or 
another. Natural selection equips us with "Rules of Thumb," which in a state of 
nature have the effect of promoting the survival of our selfish genes. The Rules 
of Thumb go on, even though in this world of "candle flames" they no longer  
promote our inclusive fitness. 

<P><STRONG><EM>Skeptic:</EM></STRONG>
Would you consider increasing population and war to be examples of candle 
flames?
<BR><STRONG><EM>Dawkins:</EM></STRONG>
Increasing population itself is not an individual behavior pattern. It's a 
consequence of many things which are manifestations of individual behavior in a 
collective environment. To take a much simpler case, the dominance hierarchy is 
a manifestation of attacking and subservience between pairs of individuals, but 
the dominance hierarchy itself is not something that natural selection favors or 
disfavors. What natural selection favors or disfavors is the individual behavior 
of which the dominance hierarchy is a manifestation. I would put war and 
overpopulation in that category. 

<P><STRONG><EM>Skeptic:</EM></STRONG>
In <EM>River Out of Eden</EM>, you also say that, "Science shares with religion 
the claim that it answers deep questions about origins, the nature of life, and 
the cosmos. But there the resemblance ends. Scientific beliefs are supported by 
evidence, and they get results. Myths and faiths are not and do not" (p. 33). 
But doesn't one first have to make the choice or decision to use pragmatism as 
the standard by which we judge? That is, we must first agree to base our 
decisions on what works, rather than on revelation or intuition. Isn't the most 
we can ask of the religious crowd, "Either lay hands on flat tires and pray for 
the sick, rather than taking them to a mechanic or a doctor, or if you are not 
willing to be consistent, just shut up and go away?" Doesn't the religious view 
amount to, "When we're afraid, we seek God. When God doesn't answer our prayers, 
blame it on the Devil?"
<BR><STRONG><EM>Dawkins:</EM></STRONG>
Yes, it's a kind of pathetic, childish response to some failure.

<P><STRONG><EM>Skeptic:</EM></STRONG>
Then could you say that the reason that evolutionism is resisted so strongly is 
that our minds evolved to think in terms of personalities and entities rather 
than in terms of processes?
<BR><STRONG><EM>Dawkins:</EM></STRONG>
Yes, it's the idea that somebody has got to be responsible. It's what children 
do--the petulant throwing the tennis racquet on the ground, blaming it for their 
bad shot. So is the reflex to sue somebody when you slip on the ice and sprain 
your ankle. Again, somebody has got to be blamed. It doesn't occur to many 
people that nobody's to blame, there's just ice and it's slippery and you fell 
down. 

<P><STRONG><EM>Skeptic:</EM></STRONG>
Along that line, you have the following passage in <EM>River Out of Eden</EM>:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
In a universe of blind physical forces and genetic replication, some people are 
going to get hurt, other people are going to get lucky, and you won't find any 
rhyme or reason in it, nor any justice. The universe we observe has precisely 
the properties we should expect if there is, at bottom, no design, no purpose, 
no evil and no good, nothing but blind, pitiless indifference (p.133).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
This sounds rather like physicist Steven Weinberg's, "the more the universe 
seems comprehensible, the more it seems pointless" (<EM>The First Three 
Minutes</EM>), or William Shakespeare's "a tale told by an idiot, filled with 
sound and fury, signifying nothing." Is that in fact your position?
<BR><STRONG><EM>Dawkins:</EM></STRONG>
Yes, at a sort of cosmic level, it is. But what I want to guard against is 
people therefore getting nihilistic in their personal lives. I don't see any 
reason for that at all. You can have a very happy and fulfilled personal life 
even if you think that the universe at large is a tale told by an idiot. You can 
still set up goals and have a very worthwhile life and not be nihilistic about 
it at a personal level. 

<P><STRONG><EM>Skeptic:</EM></STRONG>
Well, if we don't accept religion as a reasonable guide to "what is" or even a 
reasonable guide to "what ought to be," does evolution give us such a guide? Can 
we turn to evolution to answer not what is, but what ought to be?
<BR><STRONG><EM>Dawkins:</EM></STRONG>
I'd rather not do that. I think Julian Huxley was the last person who attempted 
to. In my opinion, a society run along "evolutionary" lines would not be a very 
nice society in which to live. But further, there's no logical reason why we 
should try to derive our normative standards from evolution. It's perfectly 
consistent to say this is the way it is--natural selection is out there and it 
is a very unpleasant process. Nature is red in tooth and claw. But I don't want 
to live in that kind of a world. I want to change the world in which I live in 
such a way that natural selection no longer applies.

<P><STRONG><EM>Skeptic:</EM></STRONG>
But given the clay from which we are made, doesn't natural selection make it 
relatively unlikely that some things will work? Doesn't Darwinism undercut the 
great socialist hope, "Why, because we will it so!"?
<BR><STRONG><EM>Dawkins:</EM></STRONG>
Some goals may be unrealistic. But that doesn't mean that we should turn around 
the other way and say therefore we should strive to make a Darwinian millennium 
come true. 

<P><STRONG><EM>Skeptic:</EM></STRONG>
But then isn't what we ought to do (as David Hume argued long ago) just a matter 
of preference and choice, custom and habit?
<BR><STRONG><EM>Dawkins:</EM></STRONG>
I think that's very likely true. But I don't think that having conceded that 
point, I as an individual should then be asked to abandon my own ethical system 
or goals. I as an individual can adopt idealistic or socialistic or unrealistic 
or whatever sort of norms of charity and good will towards other people. They 
may be doomed if you take a strong Darwinian line on human nature, but it's not 
obvious to me that they are. 

<P><STRONG><EM>Skeptic:</EM></STRONG>
I think that you are saying that many of the lessons of evolutionary biology 
about morality or ethics are contrary to what we might normally call morality or 
ethics in ordinary discourse. When we look back at the Old Testament and the New 
Testament, it seems there's a lot about how to maximize one's inclusive fitness. 
If that's the case, do such religious views have anything to tell us?
<BR><STRONG><EM>Dawkins:</EM></STRONG>
If it is true that some of the morality of the Old Testament, say, maximizes 
somebody's inclusive fitness, I don't think that has anything to tell us about 
what we ought to do. 

<P><STRONG><EM>Skeptic:</EM></STRONG>
Then wouldn't we be better to throw out all this half-baked religious mumbo 
jumbo and move on to something else?
<BR><STRONG><EM>Dawkins:</EM></STRONG>
Well yes, but that's obvious!

<P><STRONG><EM>Skeptic:</EM></STRONG>
Do you think that group fitness is a meaningful concept in evolutionary biology? 
If so, does it play a role in discussions of evolution and morality?
<BR><STRONG><EM>Dawkins:</EM></STRONG>
I think it's logically meaningful, but I don't think it plays a role in 
evolution in the wild and therefore it doesn't play a role in anything else. I 
think it's of no importance.

<P><STRONG><EM>Skeptic:</EM></STRONG>
Can we use Darwinism and natural selection to analyze other events in history? 
To put it in its crudest form, if Hitler had won WWII would that have proved 
that his system was better (in a Darwinian sense) than that of the Allies? Or 
does the fact that the Soviet Bloc crumbled tell us anything about the relative 
fitness of market-based economies versus command economies. If might (or at 
least survival and reproduction) doesn't make right (as well as everything 
else), what does?
<BR><STRONG><EM>Dawkins:</EM></STRONG>
I think it is not helpful to apply Darwinian language too widely. Conquest of 
nation by nation is too distant for Darwinian explanations to be helpful. 
Darwinism is the differential survival of self-replicating genes in a gene pool, 
usually as manifested by individual behavior, morphology, and phenotypes. Group 
selection of any kind is not Darwinism as Darwin understood it nor as I 
understand it. There is a very vague analogy between group selection and 
conquest of a nation by another nation, but I don't think it's a very helpful 
analogy. So I would prefer not to invoke Darwinian language for that kind of 
historical interpretation. 

<P><STRONG><EM>Skeptic:</EM></STRONG>
The publication of the controversial book, <EM>The Bell Curve</EM>, has set off 
yet another round in the seemingly never-ending nature-nurture (or heredity-
environment) controversy. Is this in fact a false dichotomy? You had this 
passage in <EM>The Selfish Gene</EM> (1989, p. 37):
<BLOCKQUOTE>
No one factor, genetic, or environmental, can be considered as the single 
'cause' of any part of a baby. All parts of a baby have a near infinite number 
of antecedent causes. But a difference [original emphasis] between one baby and 
another, for example a difference in length of leg, might easily be traced to 
one or a few simple antecedent differences, either in environment or in genes. 
It is differences that matter in the competitive struggle to survive; and it is 
genetically-controlled differences that matter in evolution.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
Doesn't a passage like this indicate why E.O. Wilson's <EM>Sociobiology</EM>, 
<EM>The Bell Curve</EM>, and your own writings automatically set off a vehement, 
moralistic, and often hysterical reaction from a cadre of left-wing scientists?
<BR><STRONG><EM>Dawkins:</EM></STRONG>
On the face of it, I don't know why you lump those three books together. When I 
was talking about genetic differences as being analyzable, that's the position 
of any geneticist. All I was saying was that when you look at something like eye 
color in <EM>Drosophila</EM> (or indeed in humans), although there are hundreds 
of genes and environmental factors that enter into making an eye, nevertheless 
if there's a one gene difference at a particular locus between two individuals, 
that can be the determining factor as to why that particular individual has a 
pink eye rather than a black eye. That is just straight genetics. You can't get 
away from that. The reason why left-wing ideologues attack books like <EM>The 
Bell Curve</EM> has nothing to do with that. Those critics are concerned with 
issues like race and I never mention race. I don't mind mentioning race, but it 
has nothing to do with what I was talking about. 

<P><STRONG><EM>Skeptic:</EM></STRONG>
But those same left-wing critics also attack your books. 
<BR><STRONG><EM>Dawkins:</EM></STRONG>
But they don't read them!

<P><STRONG><EM>Skeptic:</EM></STRONG>
Well, you document examples of such attacks in the end notes to the 1989 edition 
of <EM>The Selfish Gene</EM>. Isn't it just as ideological for Marxism to be 
brought in as an argument against genetic differences as it is to bring in 
Biblical fundamentalism as an argument against Darwinian evolution? Aren't we 
dealing with religion, rather than science here?
<BR><STRONG><EM>Dawkins:</EM></STRONG>
I suspect that we may be. The reason I think so is that the criticisms in some 
cases just seem to be silly. They seem to be a hysterical reaction to a 
misunderstanding. It's as though some people think that any mention of genes in 
the context of human behavior is somehow tainted with the tar of Social 
Darwinism and all the horrors that social scientists see in the history of their 
subject. So instead of just calmly and peacefully sitting down and thinking 
about what actually is the truth--"Are there genes that influence behavior?," 
the immediate response is to flame up old fires of what once upon a time were 
important political issues. That kind of thing bores me rigid! I care about 
what's actually true. 

<P><STRONG><EM>Skeptic:</EM></STRONG>
In a Darwinian sense, isn't it somewhat meaningless to argue about any supposed 
displacement of "superior" beings by "inferior" beings, or that evolution "is 
going backwards." Don't such arguments turn Darwinism on its head ?
<BR><STRONG><EM>Dawkins:</EM></STRONG>
Because whatever evolves is, by definition, superior? There's nothing 
nonsensical about saying that what would evolve if Darwinian selection has its 
head is something that you don't want to happen. And I could easily imagine 
trying to go against Darwinism. I don't see why that's inconsistent. I can 
easily imagine saying that in a Darwinian world, the fittest, by definition, are 
the ones that survive and the attributes that you need to survive in Darwinian 
sense are the attributes that I don't want to see in the world. I can easily see 
myself fighting against the success of Darwinism prevailing in the world. 

<P><STRONG><EM>Skeptic:</EM></STRONG>
Shortly after publication of <EM>The Selfish Gene</EM>, you wrote a letter to 
the editor of <EM>Nature</EM> [the leading British science magazine, similar to 
Science here in the US], in which you stated that kin selection theory in no way 
provides a basis for understanding ethnocentrism. You said you made this 
statement, in part at least, to counter charges that were being made in the UK 
at that time by Marxist critics that Selfish Gene Theory was being used by the 
British National Front to support their Fascist ideology. In retrospect, do you 
think you went too far in trying to distance yourself from some would-be and 
very unwanted enthusiasts, or not far enough?
<BR><STRONG><EM>Dawkins:</EM></STRONG>
As to distancing myself from the National Front, that I did! The National Front 
was saying something like this, "kin selection provides the basis for favoring 
your own race as distinct from other races, as a kind of generalization of 
favoring your own close family as opposed to other individuals." Kin selection 
doesn't do that! Kin selection favors nepotism towards your own immediate close 
family. It does not favor a generalization of nepotism towards millions of other 
people who happen to be the same color as you. Even if it did, and this is a 
stronger point, I would oppose any suggestion from any group such as the 
National Front, that whatever occurs in natural selection is therefore morally 
good or desirable. We come back to this point over and over again. I'm 
definitely not one who thinks that "is" is the same as "ought."

<P><STRONG><EM>Skeptic:</EM></STRONG>
How do you evaluate the work of Iren&auml;us Eibl-Eibesfeldt, J.P. Rushton, and 
Pierre van den Berghe, all of whom have argued that kin selection theory does 
help explain nationalism and patriotism?
<BR><STRONG><EM>Dawkins:</EM></STRONG>
One could invoke a kind "misfiring" of kin selection if you wanted to in such 
cases. Misfirings are common enough in evolution. For example, when a cuckoo 
host feeds a baby cuckoo, that is a misfiring of behavior which is naturally 
selected to be towards the host's own young. There are plenty of opportunities 
for misfirings. I could imagine that racist feeling could be a misfiring, not of 
kin selection but of reproductive isolation mechanisms. At some point in our 
history there may have been two species of humans who were capable of mating 
together but who might have produced sterile hybrids (such as mules). If that 
were true, then there could have been selection in favor of a "horror" of mating 
with the other species. Now that could misfire in the same sort of way that the 
cuckoo host's parental impulse misfires. The rule of thumb for that hypothetical 
avoiding of miscegenation could be "Avoid mating with anybody of a different 
color (or appearance) from you."
<BR>I'm happy for people to make speculations along those lines as long as they 
don't again jump that is-ought divide and start saying, "therefore racism is a 
good thing." I don't think racism is a good thing. I think it's a very bad 
thing. That is my moral position. I don't see any justification in evolution 
either for or against racism. The study of evolution is not in the business of 
providing justifications for anything. 

<P><STRONG><EM>Skeptic:</EM></STRONG>
In <EM>The Extended Phenotype</EM> you talk about the Green Beard Effect, and 
last night Napoleon Chagnon, the President of the Human Behavior and Evolution 
Society, actually dyed his beard green before introducing you. What is the Green 
Beard Effect and why do you mention it only to then dismiss it as being too 
improbable to be a factor in evolution?
<BR><STRONG><EM>Dawkins:</EM></STRONG>
I use The Green Beard Effect as a way of explaining kin selection. If you 
imagine a gene that has two pleiotropic effects that apparently have nothing to 
do with each other (and in practice that's common enough), if one of its effects 
is to give somebody a label, such as the Green Beard, and the other is to give 
somebody a propensity to act altruistically towards individuals so labeled (that 
is, Green-Bearded individuals), then theoretically that gene will spread. The 
Green Beard Effect is a way in which a would-be selectively altruistic gene can 
recognize copies of itself in other individuals. That means that the gene can 
propagate itself by looking after copies of itself when it has the opportunity 
to do so. That's relatively easy to understand. But as far as I know, in 
practice Green Beards don't exist. But kinship is a kind of statistical Green 
Beard. Although your brother is not guaranteed to contain the gene that's making 
you practice "fraternal" behavior towards him, the odds that he has that gene 
are statistically higher than the odds that a random member of the population 
has it. Kinship is therefore a statistically watered down version of the Green 
Beard Effect that actually works. 

<P><STRONG><EM>Skeptic:</EM></STRONG>
Could there be selection for a mechanism that would operate like this--"those 
who look like me, talk like me, act like me, are probably genetically close to 
me. Therefore, be nice, good, and altruistic to them. If not avoid them?" And 
could that mechanism later be programmed to say "be good to someone who wears 
the same baseball cap, the same Rugby colors, or whatever?" That is, could 
evolution have a produced a hardware mechanism that is software programmable?
<BR><STRONG><EM>Dawkins:</EM></STRONG>
I think that's possible. 

<P><STRONG><EM>Skeptic:</EM></STRONG>
In his book, <EM>Complexity</EM>, Roger Lewin includes interviews with a number 
of evolutionary biologists. One of the topics they examine is progress. Is there 
a general tendency towards progress in terms of say, increasing neural 
complexity, increasing brain size, or increasing behavioral plasticity over the 
course of evolution? Or is this, as Stephen Jay Gould has termed it, a rather 
noxious concept that we should read out of evolutionary thinking?
<BR><STRONG><EM>Dawkins:</EM></STRONG>
I think that there has been an almost hysterical over-reaction against the 
concept of progress. I've been as against some mistaken interpretations of the 
concept of progress as anybody. I very, very strongly object to the idea that 
living creatures can be arranged on a ladder, a kind of phylogenetic scale, with 
humans at the top. Not only should we not treat humans as being on the top, we 
should not see the animal kingdom as being layered as we often do. All zoology 
textbooks present their chapters in the same order--you start with protozoa, 
then you move through the coelenterates, then the flatworms, then the round 
worms and so on. Certainly that interpretation of progress is just a logical 
error. Evolution is a branching tree and that's all there is to it. 
<BR>However, it is another matter to say that there is no progressive evolution 
within one lineage as you go from the distant past, through the more recent 
descendants, up to the present. There very well could be such progress. To the 
extent that adaptation is to the a-biotic environment (such as the weather), you 
would expect no progress. Evolutionary change would simply track the weather. If 
it gets cold, you get a thick coat. If it gets hot, you shed your thick coat, 
and so on. To the extent that adaptations are to the biotic environment (that 
is, other organisms, rather than natural conditions), then it seems to me quite 
plausible that there is in fact a progressive arms race as I term it. The better 
a predator gets at running down prey, the more it pays the prey to shift 
resources into anti-predator adaptations and out of other aspects of life. There 
are always trade-offs in the economy of life. If the predators are getting 
really good at their job, it makes sense for the prey to shift resources (which 
admittedly could have been put into making more offspring), into making better 
legs for running or better sense organs for detecting the predators. The 
predators then shift their resources accordingly. 
<BR>Given the extraordinary elegance and beauty and complexity of the 
adaptations that we see all around us in living creatures, I think it's 
ludicrous to deny that those are the result of progressive evolution. There has 
been progress. 

<P><STRONG><EM>Skeptic:</EM></STRONG>
In your most recent book, <EM>River Out of Eden</EM>, you try to clear up some 
misunderstandings about the First Mother and the First Father. Would you like to 
repeat them? 
<BR><STRONG><EM>Dawkins:</EM></STRONG>
I refer to things like the belief that Mitochondrial Eve was, like the mythical 
Biblical Eve, the only woman on Earth. Nonsense, she could have been the member 
of a huge population. She's simply the common ancestor of all living humans. 
Another error is to think that Mitochondrial Eve is our most recent common 
ancestor. She most certainly is not our most recent common ancestor. That 
distinction much more likely goes to a male. The reason for that is pure logic 
and it's spelled out in <EM>River Out of Eden</EM>. 

<P><STRONG><EM>Skeptic:</EM></STRONG>
A few years ago, you and Stephen Jay Gould got in to a bit of an intellectual 
row about the question of punctuated equilibrium. By the time you wrote <EM>The 
Blind Watchmaker</EM> you seemed to say that more was made of the controversy by 
journalists than was warranted. What is your current position on this 
controversy?
<BR><STRONG><EM>Dawkins:</EM></STRONG>
I think that punctuated equilibrium is a minor wrinkle on Darwinism, of no great 
theoretical significance. It has been vastly oversold. 

<P><STRONG><EM>Skeptic:</EM></STRONG>
Why?
<BR><STRONG><EM>Dawkins:</EM></STRONG>
That's a matter of individual psychology and motivation and not my province. 

<P><STRONG><EM>Skeptic:</EM></STRONG>
You also took a bit of flak for likening religion (I think specifically 
Catholicism) to a virus? Is that still your position?
<BR><STRONG><EM>Dawkins:</EM></STRONG>
Yes. I come to it through the analogy to computer viruses. We have two kinds of 
viruses that have a lot in common--namely real biological viruses and computer 
viruses. In both cases they are parasitic self-replicating codes which exploit 
the existence of machinery that was set up to copy and obey that kind of code. 
So I then ask the question, "What if there were a third kind of milieu in which 
a different kind of self-replicating code could become an effective parasite?" 
Human brains with their powerful communication systems seem to be a likely 
candidate. Then I ask, "What would it feel like if you were the victim of a mind 
virus?" Well, you would feel within yourself this deep conviction that seems to 
come from nowhere. It doesn't result from any evidence, but you have a total 
conviction that you know what's true about the world and the cosmos and life. 
You just know it and you're even prepared to kill people who disagree with you. 
You go around proselytizing and persuading other people to accept your view. The 
more you write down the features that such a mind virus would have, the more it 
starts to look like religion. I do think that the Roman Catholic religion is a 
disease of the mind which has a particular epidemiology similar to that of a 
virus. 

<P><STRONG><EM>Skeptic:</EM></STRONG>
But couldn't the Pope (or Evangelical Protestants for that matter), reply, 
"Look, we just have a terrific meme. It's winning what you would describe as a 
Darwinian battle and you're angry because you just don't like it."
<BR><STRONG><EM>Dawkins:</EM></STRONG>
Religion is a terrific meme. That's right. But that doesn't make it true and I 
care about what's true. Smallpox virus is a terrific virus. It does its job 
magnificently well. That doesn't mean that it's a good thing. It doesn't mean 
that I don't want to see it stamped out. 

<P><STRONG><EM>Skeptic:</EM></STRONG>
So once again the discussion goes back to how do you determine whether something 
is good or not, other than by just your personal choice?
<BR><STRONG><EM>Dawkins:</EM></STRONG>
I don't even try. You keep wanting to base morality on Darwinism. I don't. 

<P><STRONG><EM>Skeptic:</EM></STRONG>
Given the number of popular and scientific controversies in which you have been 
involved, is there anything on which you have changed your mind, on which you'd 
like to correct the record, or which you see differently now than you did when 
you first became a household name?
<BR><STRONG><EM>Dawkins:</EM></STRONG>
Well, my second book, <EM>The Extended Phenotype</EM>, published in 1982 and 
summarized at the end of the second edition of <EM>The Selfish Gene</EM>, does 
downplay the role of the individual organism as the only vehicle of the genetic 
replicators. Previously, I rather blurred the distinction between vehicle and 
replicator. In <EM>The Extended Phenotype</EM>, I emphasize the distinction. I 
think I was right to say that fundamentally what is going on in natural 
selection is the differential survival of replicators. Replicators survive by 
virtue of their phenotypic effects upon the world. As it happens, it is a 
contingent fact that most of those phenotypic effects tend to be bound up in the 
vehicle (the particular individual body) in which the replicator (the gene) is 
housed. But that doesn't have to be so. I use the didactic device of looking at 
animal artifacts like beaver dams, the effects of parasites on hosts, animal 
communications, and indeed all of the interactions in ecosystems as 
illustrations of the ways in which genes might in principle and sometimes in 
fact do insure their survival by exerting phenotypic effects outside of the body 
in which they reside. That's a kind of change of mind. 
<BR>My original purpose in introducing the concept of memes really was not to 
produce a theory of culture, but rather to say that Darwinism doesn't have to be 
tied to genes. It can work wherever you have a self-replicating code. We should 
actively be looking around for other examples of self-replicating codes which 
are "doing the Darwinian thing." The important thing is not to get too hung up 
on genes when you're doing your evolutionary biology. 

<P><STRONG><EM>Skeptic:</EM></STRONG>
What are the areas in biology into which Darwinism should be extended?
<BR><STRONG><EM>Dawkins:</EM></STRONG>
Sex is one that is being actively worked on. That is, the question of why it 
exists. 
Then there's the embryological gap. In our Darwinism we postulate that there are 
genes for this and genes for that. We just leave the embryological causal link 
between genes and phenotype as a black box. We know that genes do, in fact, 
cause changes in phenotypes and that's all we really need in order for Darwinism 
to work. But it would be nice to fill in the details of exactly what goes on 
inside the black box. 
<BR>To me, human consciousness is a deep, philosophically mysterious 
manifestation of brain activity and is in some sense a product of Darwinian 
evolution. But we don't yet really have any idea how it evolved and where it 
fits into a Darwinian view of biology. I don't know whether it will yield to a 
sudden flash of enlightenment, whether it will become one of those rather messy 
problems that never really get a proper solution, or whether it will eventually 
turn out that there never was a problem at all and that we were actually making 
up problems where there really weren't any. From where I sit, it seems to be a 
deeply difficult problem that has always been a philosophical problem but which 
I think is ripe for a take-over by evolutionary biology once we think how to do 
it.

<LI>ALLELE(S)--the alternative forms of a gene that can exist at a particular 
locus. Thus, A, B, and O are the alleles of the ABO blood group system; positive 
and negative are the alleles of the Rh system.

<LI>GREEN BEARD EFFECT--a term coined by Dawkins for the situation in which a 
gene has two effects (pleiotropy), one of which produces a recognizable 
phenotypic trait (the hypothetical Green Beard) and the other produces the 
tendency to manifest altruistic behavior toward others who also manifest that 
trait. 

<LI>GROUP SELECTION (THEORY)--the theory that natural selection also operates at 
the level of the group and not just the individual organism. 

<LI>INCLUSIVE FITNESS--the total reproductive success of an individual, 
including the proportionate success of his relatives based on the percentage of 
genes they share in common (100% for identical twins, 50% [on average] for 
siblings, parents, or offspring, 12.5% for first cousins, and so on).

<LI>KIN SELECTION (THEORY)--the selection of genes so as to cause individuals to 
favor their close genetic relatives as they are statistically likely to share 
genes in common. Often invoked to provide a neo-Darwinian explanation of 
behaviors such as altruism.

<LI>MEME(S)--a term coined by Dawkins for units of cultural inheritance, 
analogous to genes (the units of genetic transmission), which are acted upon by 
natural selection.

<LI>MITOCHONDRIA--the cell organelles that are the site of energy-releasing 
biochemical reactions. Mitochondria have their own DNA, which is passed through

<H1>"First of All, Do No Harm"
<BR>A Recovered Memory Therapist Recants
<BR><BR>An Interview With Robin Newsome</H1>
<H2><A HREF = "03.4.about-pendergrast.html">By Mark Pendergrast</A></H2>

<EM>In my book, </EM>Victims of Memory<EM>, I included four chapters
of verbatim interviews with recovered memory therapists,
self-described incest survivors who retrieved memories, accused
parents, and retractors who once believed they had recovered memories
and have now taken back the allegations. In the final chapter, I
offered advice to therapists who specialize in unearthing incest
memories: "It will take enormous courage for you to admit what you
have done to dozens, perhaps hundreds, of clients, validating their
belief in horrible events that never took place." I called for such
therapists to develop a new specialty-helping to reunite the families
torn asunder by these false incest charges. "After all," I wrote, "who
better understands the Survivor Syndrome than you?"
<P> Recently, I met just such a "retractor therapist," a woman who
once conducted guided imagery to help clients unlock the horrible
secrets from their subconscious and who now realizes that rather than
contributing to healing,she was causing untold harm. A Christian
therapist who is active in her evangelical church, Robin Newsome (not
her real name), 49, is particularly concerned that so much evil has
been done in the name of God, she is doing everything in her power to
stop this form of therapy from ruining more lives. One by one, she is
finding former clients, seeking to undo the damage.
<P>The following interview follows the same format as those in </EM>Victims
of Memory<EM> and can be considered that book's "missing interview."
<P>Texan Robin Newsome is a soft-spoken, gentle woman. In her junior
year in college, she became a devout Christian and joined a Christian
campus organization. After graduating with a degree in early childhood
education, she married and had two children. In 1982, she returned to
school to obtain a masters in counseling, where she embraced Gestalt
therapy and encountered her first case of recovered memory.</EM>

<P>One of my first courses was called "Anger Therapy." It met every
day for three weeks. After a short lecture, we'd meet in small groups
with a therapist. This was a very intense, emotional experience. After
a round of checking in, each group member was asked whether they
wanted to "work" or not on any particular day. That meant doing a
two-chair visualization, where you imagined the person you were angry
at to be in the chair across from you, and you vented your anger,
using a bataaka [foam filled] bat to hit a foam pad. This was supposed
to get out your unresolved anger. This was a whole new world to me. I
felt like Alice falling down the rabbit hole with this stuff. Here I
was in my placid little world, and this was like entering a
subterranean world I never knew existed. It turned me sideways and
upside down. I had always been the nice Christian girl, and I wasn't
aware of my great storehouse of anger.
<P><EM>(Newsome explained that she was angry at her husband, who was
having an affair. When she figuratively put her husband in the chair,
"I nearly took the head of the instructor off using the bataaka bat.")</EM>
<P>One Friday, a woman in the group told us she had had an image of
herself being sexually abused when she was two years old. She said, "I
know I was abused by someone, but I can't see who it is." On Monday,
she told us with tremendous sorrow that she had realized that it was
her older brother. The therapist had her "put him in the chair," but
instead of using the bat, she said she wanted to rip his head off. The
therapist handed her some magazines and told her to have at it. She
started screaming at the top of her lungs at her brother, crying and
ripping magazines. Everything was going well until she grabbed one of
the therapist's favorite <EM>Smithsonians</EM>, and the therapist 
yelled for her to stop and not rip that one. This woman completely
shifted gears. She very politely said, "Oh, I'm sorry," and put it
down. Then, with a vengeance, she grabbed another magazine and went
back to ripping and tearing.
<P>At the time, I interpreted this to mean that she had control over
her anger.  I had wondered if people would get so angry during these
exercises that they might just lose it completely. This woman's
ability to stop herself so quickly showed me that people weren't
really losing total control. In fact, this incident made the therapy
feel more like a play with a therapist/director who had just yelled,
"Cut!"
<P>Still, I had no reason to doubt that she had been abused-her tears,
her sorrow, her anguish, her rage, her sense of betrayal were painful
to witness. I remember being so angry at the thought that anyone could
do such a thing to a small, helpless child. The fact that she had
remembered her relationship with her brother as being happy prior to
this memory seemed irrelevant. Obviously, her mind had shielded her
from the awful truth. No one even remotely thought to question the
memory of a two-year-old. Also, the idea was that young children had
trouble giving words to their abuse, because they were in a preverbal
state. So there was just this nameless rage buried there all these
years.
<P>Throughout my courses, there was a lot of talk about "body
memories." We were taught that anger was stored in the body. During
times of anger or stress, you could identify your "stress organ." Mine
was in my neck muscles. The magazine-ripper woman stored her anger in
her jaw. I found this concept very useful. During guided imagery, I
would ask clients to recall a specific memory and ask them where they
felt it, in what part of the body. When they finished their anger
work, the tension would usually be gone, which I took as an indication
that they had worked through that emotion.
<P>Another woman in our group had come from an unhappy, dysfunctional
home. Our instructor led her in a guided visualization and helped her
create a new family for herself. At the therapist's suggestion, she
re-invented her childhood, which included growing up in a different
state, in a new house with a new, improved family. It seemed to be
helpful to her, and everyone in the group praised her. I wondered at
the time what she planned to do with her real family-the one she still
had to deal with. But then, I was just a student and the therapist was
the expert.
<P>I also remember one woman who had polio when she was young. The
therapist asked her what the purpose of the polio was. The idea was
that your body and mind collaborate, and that nothing that happens is
simply circumstantial. Initially, this feels like an insight and
explanation for something that seems so unfair and irrational. In this
case, the implication was that she was being sexually abused by her
father, so she developed polio in order to escape to the hospital.
<P>At the time, I really admired the therapist who led my group. She
was bold, outspoken, and fearless-a really good role model for mousy
little me. She seemed invincible and infallible. She was very much in
control of the group, always starting and ending on time. She had
people sharing their deepest secrets and unleashing their rage from
day one. I'd never seen anything like it. Then, after people had bared
their souls, she would be very tender and caring, like the Mom we had
always wanted. But at precisely twelve noon, the warmth would end. I
always had the feeling that if I saw her in the grocery store, she
wouldn't give me the time of day. She was someone I both admired and
feared.
<P>Probably because I had not been very open with my true feelings
before, I really took to Gestalt therapy. It was very freeing for
me. I saw it work, and I still believe it can be very helpful to
people. One of my first attempts at Gestalt therapy was a piece of
work I did with a woman at my church who was still grieving over a
miscarriage. She did a beautiful piece of grief work over the loss of
her unborn child. That was one of the most amazing things I have
witnessed. I saw her almost transform in my presence. She was able to
find peace in her miscarriage and let go of some aspects of it.
<P>Once I graduated with my masters in 1986, I began to counsel people
on a variety of issues, but I also developed a sub-specialty in sexual
abuse. In 1990, I ran a sexual abuse group that lasted nine
months. While most of the women in the group had always remembered
their abuse, there were a few who had vague images or just a gut
feeling that they had been abused. I remember conducting a guided
imagery session with one such woman. I had her close her eyes, get
comfortable, and find the tension in her body. I said to her, "How old
are you in this memory?" She said she was about four. I would ask
other questions, like, "Do you know where you are? Do you feel like
you're inside or out-of-doors?" In my own mind, I did not see this as
leading at all. They seemed like innocuous questions. Later, I
realized that this was almost like playing scrabble with someone and
putting in a little word that suddenly opens up a whole new section of
the board. I was helping her to take that little image and let it flow
into a specific place. I was actually helping her fill in the details.
<P>She said, "I feel like I'm being smothered. Something's in my face,
and I don't know what." I took a pillow and gently put it on her face
to simulate the experience. She sat with it for a while, then suddenly
she started crying. She said, "I see it now." It was her babysitter
abusing her. She remembered a nude woman forcing her to have oral
sex. At that point, she sort of emotionally closed down and couldn't
go any further with it. I said, "When you're ready, you can open your
eyes. How is your stomach now?" It felt a little better, she
said. Then I told her, "I'm really proud of you-you worked really
hard." Others in the group also gave her feedback, such as, "What you
remembered was really helpful to me, because it helped me be in touch
with what it was like to be little and to remember what happened to
me."
<P>I wouldn't have said I was doing hypnosis at all. I tended to
think of hypnosis as induced by a swinging watch chain. This was just
guided imagery. I thought I was getting into the subconscious. We had
been taught in our anger therapy class that you stored memories in
your body. No one explained exactly how that was done. I just took it
for granted. Another thing we learned was that claustrophobia often
indicated a person had had oral sex forced on them. It made a certain
amount of sense.
<P>Unfortunately, this client with the babysitter memory never really
got better. Few of my recovered memory clients ever improved. This
person was always terrifically angry, and the work we did never seemed
to help her. In fact, I would say that the sexual abuse group made her
worse, and it just distracted her from real issues-her daughter, her
troubled marriage, and a stressful job.
<P>Still, I completely believed in the memories I was hearing in my
therapy sessions. My first doubts began with Sally, whose story
continues to haunt me, especially because it is on-going. Sally is in
her mid-30s, and she came to see me almost four years ago, wanting
help with her compulsive eating. Later, she told me that her father
had been an alcoholic, and we began to focus on her dysfunctional
family. One day, Sally came to see me after getting the image of a
little girl sitting in a pool of blood. All the details of when,
where, and who were unclear. I had her close her eyes and led her
through guided imagery, asking my typical questions: "How old are you?
What are you wearing? What time of year is it? What happens next?"
With my prompting, she began to retrieve little bits of memory. In the
end, she saw her father penetrating her when she was three.
<P>At the end of the session, Sally asked, "Can this possibly be
true?" She had always felt so close to her Dad. His drinking had
always made him a happy drunk, and she was actually closer to him than
her Mom. She had no memory of him sexually abusing her before this
image. I gave her the classic line: "Sally, there would be no way for
you to have invented this much detail unless it really happened."
<P>After that first memory, she started having others. They would come
to her during the week, and she would come to each session more and
more depressed. She also had terrible insomnia and pelvic pain, which
I explained to her as body memories. They were further proof that her
memories were true. By this time, I had witnessed many clients
recovering repressed memories, and I totally believed them. If you saw
the emotion, you too would have no reason to doubt. The images were
punctuated over and over again by the anguish, tears, contorted face,
clenched fists, and rage that was expressed in hitting and kicking and
ripping and gnashing of teeth. And there was always the pleading
question, "How could he do this to me?" It would have been
incomprehensible to think that the person just came up with it to play
act. They weren't play acting. We honestly believed the images that
came into their heads were the horrifying records of real events.
<P>When Sally first came to see me, she was a relatively functional
person. Home schooling is very popular here, and she had been home
schooling her two boys for a couple of years. But after she started to
get the abuse memories, she became so emotionally fragile that she
decided to put her sons in public school. Sally would have horrible
nightmares and days of sitting in a dark room just staring at the
wall. She couldn't do her housework, so her husband had to do his work
and then come home and do hers.
<P>Sally's husband was very supportive of her, yet there were times he
would get really frustrated, watching his wife slip away before his
eyes. They had no sex life because she wouldn't let him touch her. He
would vacillate between being understanding and being really angry.
<P>Meanwhile, Sally decided to confront her Dad. I would say to
clients, "One of the issues facing you is whether to confront the
perpetrator or not." If a person decided to confront, we talked about
how to do it, how to craft a letter, or, if they were going to
confront in person, we would role-play. We always planned how they
would react if the perpetrator denied what happened, what boundaries
should be set. Sally wrote her father a letter. He called her and
completely denied everything, but we took that as evidence that he was
in denial.
<P>After confronting her Dad, Sally seemed to get a little better, but
it wasn't long before she started having more images, and another
round of memories would begin. Just when we would start to work on
current issues, like her troubled marriage or the problem she was
having with her youngest son, boom! there would be another image.
<P>Then one day, she came to me and said, "I had this image that
involved my mother." She closed her eyes, and we went back to a time
when she was a little girl living in Iowa, in this sleepy little
midwestern town. She remembered that her mother had a
miscarriage. Sally was seven years old; she found her mother in the
kitchen dismembering the baby with a knife on a chopping block. When
her mother saw her, she made her help. Sally remembered severing a
tiny leg, and then she had to fry it and eat it.
<P>I was horrified. During the week after this session, I began to
realize I was having a hard time believing this memory. I told myself
that it was so horrible that I probably just didn't want to believe
it. That year, I had attended a presentation at a local Baptist
church, where a patient described her experience in a
multi-generational satanic ritual abuse [SRA] cult, so I was somewhat
familiar with this type of story. She had been locked in a rat
infested basement with other children. They had been drugged and
programmed to cut themselves if they ever told. She described how she
had repressed all of this and recalled it in therapy. Her therapist, a
counselor at the church, was a man who seemed very caring, very
professional. I bought this presentation hook, line, and sinker.
<P>So now, when I was having troubled believing the memory, I put the blame on
myself. I realized that I had to tell Sally and, even worse, I realized that
I could no longer do therapy with her. We had built up such trust, and I was
really worried about Sally's reaction. She had begun cutting herself by that
point. I had been taught that it would mean a thousand years in purgatory to
doubt the memory of a client. Nonetheless, I knew that I could not be
effective in Sally's recovery as long as I harbored doubts. Furthermore, we
had crossed into the uncharted territory of SRA, and I felt that I was no
longer qualified to treat Sally. I referred her to an expert, the counselor
at the Baptist church.
<P>I later learned that after the first week or two of her new
therapy, her counselor suggested that she might have multiple
personality disorder [MPD]. By her fourth session, she had discovered
three personalities. From that point on, she developed more and
more. I understand that she now has 35 or so. She has been
hospitalized at least five times. She has overdosed and cut herself
again and again. After three years of weekly and sometimes twice
weekly therapy with a counselor and a psychiatrist, she shows no sign
of improvement. Her marriage is now on the brink of divorce, and her
two sons are tired of their Mom being so crazy. They are frightened of
her and for her. I get the feeling that they feel responsible for
keeping her alive. Her new counselor told Sally that things would have
to get worse before they got better. He sure was right about that!
<P>A couple of months later, a woman named Rebecca came to see me. She
was having images of ceremonial-type murders. In this case, there was
a corroborating witness who had instigated an investigation against
her parents. This involved a real unsolved murder from many years ago,
and the police were called in. I thought, "Here's an example of SRA
really happening." Before, I had queasy feelings, but here were the
police giving credence to it. Again, I referred this client to the
so-called experts, this time to a residential treatment center in New
Mexico called Cottonwood, where they specialized in the treatment of
SRA victims. The main focus was on recovering repressed memories. In
group, they would share any thoughts or dreams, and if a person had a
memory, they were highly praised for it. The worst thing you could say
was, "I don't know if this is true or not."
<P>Rebecca got much worse instead of better. She told me later that
the images never felt quite like her other memories, and she continued
to question their validity. She also found out that the corroborating
"evidence" of her friend consisted of recovered memories she had
retrieved in therapy. After the police investigation failed to turn up
any physical evidence to support the accusations, she decided to take
a break from all the stress of therapy and make an attempt to get back
to some kind of normal life with her husband and young children. As
time passed, she noticed that she felt better. The nightmares stopped,
her symptoms abated, and her thoughts cleared. In fact, she began to
seriously question whether any of her repressed memories were
true. She missed her family but was uncertain how to reconcile with
them, particularly with her father. Finally, when Rebecca became
seriously ill herself, she called on her mother for help.
<P>By this time, Rebecca's parents had discovered the False Memory
Syndrome Foundation and had tried to get some FMS literature to me
through my pastor. He gave it to me to read. I took one look at it,
and the tone seemed very anti-therapist. I said, "This sounds like
nonsense, like perpetrators trying to invent a safe haven." I didn't
pay much attention to it.
<P>Rebecca went through her surgery, and her parents were very loving
and supportive-pretty amazing, since she had accused her Dad of
murder. She finally allowed them to see her children, whom they had
not seen in over a year. In the past few months, I have met her
parents and tried to make amends for the damage I caused their
family. They have been incredibly kind and forgiving.
<P>After her surgery, Rebecca started reading the FMS material and
realized that she fit the pattern of the repressed memory victim to a
T. Instead of merely doubting her abuse memories, she began to
denounce them. In early 1993, she came to me with the article about
Paul Ingram from <EM>The New Yorker</EM>. That article was a turning
point for me. As I read it, I kept thinking of my experience with
Sally and how she had not gotten better, but worse. She had gone from
mere hell to sheer hell.
<P>I began to think maybe there was such a thing as false memory. I
wondered why the Vietnam vet doesn't forget being in Vietnam, or the
Chowchilla children being buried in a bus, or the Holocaust
survivors. Why don't flood victims forget? The problem with real
victims of trauma seems just the reverse-they can't forget about those
experiences. Does the mind work like a movie camera, recording every
detail of an event? How early can memories be retrieved? How can
people remember back to six months old? One of my clients had recalled
being sexually abused in her crib by her grandfather. Where is the
science to give credence to a belief like that? Or for that matter, do
women in their teens forget incidents of repeated abuse? One incident
might be forgotten, but repeated acts of torture, how do they get
repressed? And why was it only sexual abuse that was blocked from
memory? Why not physical abuse?
<P>I had just re-read <EM>The Crucible</EM> about the Salem witch
trials, and I began to see parallels. The same flimsy "evidence" that
condemned innocent people to die in Salem was now being used to accuse
and sometimes even charge parents of crimes, the only evidence being a
repressed memory. I realized that I had never once questioned the idea
of repressed memory. It was a presupposition that had been laid down
in my profession as a foundation, and I had just stepped out onto it
without questioning whether it was a solid foundation on which to
build beliefs. I began to read snippets of the FMSF literature, which
was based on scientific research in the field of memory and
hypnosis. I realized that I needed to rethink many of my fundamental
assumptions.
<P>In the fall of 1993, I attended my first local FMSF meeting. I
wasn't sure what to expect. These were the accused, after all. I
remembered all that I had learned about how all perpetrators are in
denial. I expected a room full of defensive parents. What I found
instead was a group of sad and shocked parents who asked the same
question their daughters asked: "How could she do this to me?" I had
been so supportive of women and their repressed memories, but I had
never once considered what that experience was like for the
parents. Now I heard how absolutely ludicrous it sounded. One elderly
couple introduced themselves, and the wife told me that their daughter
had accused her husband of murdering three people. Another woman had
been accused of being in a Satanic cult that had used babies for
sacrifices. This woman in a pink polyester suit was supposed to be a
high priestess. The pain in these parents' faces was so obvious. And
the unique thread was that their daughters had gone to therapy. I
didn't feel very proud of myself or my profession that day.
<P>I think that if I had been counseling only sex abuse cases, or if I
had pressed my clients further when they denied being sexually abused,
or if I had used "symptom lists" on clients, I probably would never
had gone to that FMSF meeting. I think that there is a point of no
return with repressed memory therapy, where admitting what you have
done to clients would be too terrible to ever face. Fortunately, I had
not yet reached that point. Still, I left that meeting with a
tremendous discomfort, realizing that I had clients who had cut off
all relationship with parents who would have looked exactly like these
people and would be in as much shock and disbelief. I felt like the
sorcerer's apprentice.
<P>After that FMSF meeting, I would frequently wake up in the middle
of the night in terror and anguish, thinking about clients who fit the
pattern for False Memory Syndrome. Sometimes I worried about being
sued. A number of the parents I had met were eager to sue their
child's therapist. Most of the time, though, I just thought about
those mothers and fathers who wanted their children back. Most of them
hadn't talked to their children in at least two years, often longer.
<P>There was one client who kept coming to mind. She had occasionally
voiced doubts about her memories-they had always been very vague, and
I had secretly wondered if she hadn't jumped to a false conclusion
when she accused her Dad. The next time she came in, I asked if she
would like me to attempt mediation with her father, and she was open
to the idea. He must have been stunned when I identified myself as his
daughter's therapist. He told me that he was so hurt that he never
wanted to speak to her again. But he also told me, "You know, my
daughter really was sexually abused by a babysitter when she was
five," which coincided with the age she had memories of being
abused. I told him a little bit about FMS and that his daughter had
not maliciously accused him. I gently pressed the issue and found that
he really did want to reunite with his daughter. Finally, after a good
deal of trepidation, she called him. Now they are on the path to
making peace with one another.
<P>Since then, I have been going back to former clients, one by one,
trying to undo the damage. I will meet with them and ask them to read
over some FMSF material. "Even if it turns out that your repressed
memories are true," I say, "you should know that information
questioning them is out there. I want you to read it, and then we'll
talk." Some clients, like the woman who thought her grandfather had
abused her in the crib, have retracted with evident relief. Others
have re-established some sort of relationship with their parents, but
they haven't taken back the allegations. One just shrugged and told
me, "I guess we'll never know whether these memories are true or
false." That attitude really disturbs me. And Sally won't hear what I
have to say yet, but some day, I hope she will retract.
<P>I have also changed the way I practice sex abuse therapy. I only
work with clients who have long-standing memories. Now I never ask if
a client has been sexually abused. I leave it up to clients to present
their own issues. And I no longer refer anyone to experts on Satanic
Ritual Abuse, since there are no real experts. There may really be
groups of people dabbling in ritual abuse, but I do not believe in
multi-generational everyone-in-town-is-involved SRA cults. The FBI and
police forces around the country have found no evidence to support
their existence.
<P>It is very disturbing to me that many who consider themselves
Christian counselors are among those searching for repressed memories,
particularly of SRA. Christians believe in the concept of an evil
force called Satan. Ritual abuse gives credence to that kind of evil,
a personal Satan with attendant spirits. It gives that spiritual
dimension to the counseling. One counselor I know tells clients to ask
God to tell them if they were sexually abused. God is supposed to
reveal their abuse in response to their prayers. This makes God
Himself an accessory to this dubious practice of retrieving
memories. In the name of God, thousands of families are being split
apart.
<P>I believe that therapists constitute a new priesthood. I think we
all have been sold a bill of goods that human misery can be attributed
solely to traumatic childhood events. I'm often struck by people who
have relatively normal lives who experience the same kind of misery. I
am not minimizing the effects of trauma, but as Jesus said, "In this
life, you will have tribulation."
<P>Another saying of Jesus also has great resonance for me now. He
said, "Perfect love casts out all fear." That's true, but I think the
reverse is also true, that perfect fear casts out all love. That is
what happens in recovered memory therapy.
<P>I recently got a call from an elderly gentleman who had heard about
my efforts to reconcile families. He wanted to talk to someone who
would understand his story. He's 84 years old and had just lost his
wife of 56 years. Five years ago, their only daughter had written them
a letter accusing him of sexually abusing her and vowing never to
speak to them again unless he confessed. He denied the charge and
hasn't heard from her since. Other family members have told him that
she now believes she has multiple personalities.
<P>When I told him that there was a support organization for accused
parents, he was really surprised. He and his wife had thought they
were the only ones. But he saw no point in attending an FMSF
meeting. At his advanced age, he didn't expect ever to see his
daughter again. Before he left, I said, "I have a prayer for these
lost daughters. Can I share it with you?" He agreed, and I began
quoting from Luke 15, the Parable of the Prodigal Son. "I will arise
and go to my father and will say unto him, 'Father, I have sinned
against heaven and before thee." Obviously recognizing the story, he
stood and continued: "But when he was yet a great way off, his father
saw him and had compassion and ran and fell on his neck and kissed
him." We finished together. "For this my son was dead and is alive
again. He was lost and is found." Together, we found a small glimmer
of hope in that moment, enveloped in an awful lot of charity. We both
cried. I wished him Godspeed, and then he left.

<BODY>
Mark Pendergrast is the author of <EM>For God, Country and Coca-Cola</EM>,
named a Notable Book of the Year by <EM>The New York Times</EM>.  A
Harvard graduate, Pendergrast now lives in New England.  Several
years ago he was informed by his adult daughters that after recovering
memories of their childhood through therapy they would no longer
communicate with their father.  Devastated by the sudden alienation and
determined to understand the social phenomenon behind it, Pendergrast
turned his investigative journalistic skills to this new phenomenon of
"Repressed Memory Syndrome," or "False Memory Syndrome" as skeptics
call it.

<BR>Free Speech & Copyright Infringement on the Information Super-Highway</H1>
<H2><A HREF = "03.3.about-jl-jj.html">By Jim Lippard and Jeff Jacobsen</A></H2>

The power to control the dissemination of information is the power to
influence the beliefs and actions of human beings. Nothing has
transformed civilization in such dramatic and unforeseen ways as the
development of information technology which affects that power. The
printing press, the telegraph, the telephone, radio, and television
have altered societies by increasing the speed of communication, the
quantity of information that can be communicated, and the potential
number of recipients of any message. As each new technology becomes
cheaper to use, the ability of individuals to create and spread their
own messages is enhanced, and control over the flow of knowledge
becomes decentralized. Institutions and individuals that require the
ability to control information to retain power have found themselves
ousted as technologies have undermined that ability.
<P>   The Internet, a global network of interlinked computers, has given
individuals the power to obtain information on virtually any subject
from all over the world. It has also put into their hands the ability
to communicate any message, almost instantly and at extremely low
cost, to a potential audience of millions. Further, the technology
exists and is used today to allow these communications to be anonymous
or private and readable only by the intended recipients. The possible
consequences of the technology of computer networking that worry many
people. Anonymous and private communication can be used by terrorists,
drug smugglers, and child pornographers, which the U.S. government
offers as argument in attempting to justify restrictions on the use
and export of encryption technology.  Businesses that exist by
controlling the distribution of music, film, and books rightly fear
obsolescence as individuals are able to transmit these works to each
other directly in digital form. Many organizations may rightly fear
having their innermost secrets broadcast over the Internet.
<P>   Falling into the last category is the Church of Scientology (COS),
which has seen texts of secret Scientology teachings, affidavits and
declarations from court cases, and even entire books by Scientology
critics, made publicly (and anonymously) available on both the
Internet and the Usenet, a collection of thousands of public
discussion forums known as newsgroups. Rather than answering the
criticism, Scientologists have responded in their standard manner-by
attacking their critics with confrontation and litigation. This
article is a summary of recent events in what began as the battle
between Scientology and its critics and, because of these tactics, is
now the battle between Scientology and the Internet.


<A NAME = "ars">
<H2>The alt.religion.scientology Newsgroup</H2>
</A>

The main forum for discussion of Scientology on the Internet is a
Usenet newsgroup known as <A HREF = "news:alt.religion.scientology">alt.religion.scientology</A> (a.r.s). This
newsgroup was created on July 17, 1991, with a forged "newgroup"
message from the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory posted under
the name of "David Miscaviage" (the misspelled name of the head of the
COS). In early 1992, three additional (non-forged) newgroup messages
for the group were posted from the Lockheed Corporation, New York
University, and the University of Maine in an attempt to increase the
propagation of the newsgroup throughout the Usenet. At first, the
newsgroup was mainly a forum used by members of the "Free Zone" (a
group founded by ex-Scientologists to promote L. Ron Hubbard's ideas
independent of the COS). As time went on, however, critics of both
Scientology's doctrines and techniques ("tech") as well as the
organization itself came to dominate the discussion on a.r.s, and the
Free Zoners formed a separate newsgroup-alt.clearing.technology.
<P>   Although there were the usual Usenet "flame wars" on a.r.s. between
Scientologists, Free Zoners, and critics, there was apparently no
coordinated action taken by the COS against its electronic critics
until 1994. In the summer of 1994, a disgruntled Scientologist
forwarded a copy of an electronic memo to an a.r.s critic. Elaine
Siegel of Scientology's Office of Special Affairs (OSA) had apparently
sent the memo to several Scientologists on the Internet and America
Online as a plan to handle electronic criticism of Scientology. The
memo was promptly reposted to a.r.s. It read:"As you know, there has
been quite a bit of false and derogatory information going out over
the Internet by a few detractors, squirrels [relapsed Scientologists],
etc....We have a plan of action that we are taking, to simply
outcreate the entheta on these newsgroups (alt.religion.scientology
and alt.clearing.technology)...." Ms. Siegel went on to explain that
critics should not be engaged in debate, but 40 to 50 Scientologists
should post pro-Scientology materials every few days so that "we'll
just run the SP's [suppressive persons] right off the system. It will
be quite simple, actually."
<P>   On September 14, an anonymous poster claiming to be a concerned
Scientologist also posted a plan to handle the Internet critics,
allegedly originating from the COS and filled with citations to
Hubbard Communications Office Policy Letters (HCOPLs), which are
organizational and administrative policies authored by L. Ron
Hubbard. This plan was more elaborate, with individuals assigned to
Legal, Security, Success Posting, and even Humor assignments. The goal
was to have "no less than 50 posts per day for the next month."
<P>   If these posts were genuine, it was clear that the church had begun
to take great interest in the a.r.s newsgroup. But while some signs
began to surface that some of these plans were being put in operation,
nothing particularly out of the ordinary occurred on a.r.s until
November 10, 1994, when 
<A HREF = "http://www.cybercom.net/~rnewman/scientology/net/threats/lerma-fax">two men came to the door of former
Scientologist Arnie Lerma</A>, who had been posting court documents
pertaining to Scientology on a.r.s., with a document for him to
sign. It was a yet unsigned affidavit in his name which declared that
he recanted his attacks on Scientology and that he had "left the
Church entirely because I could not maintain a high enough ethical
standard and wished to protect the organization from my destructive
behavior." Lerma refused to sign. Within an hour after the men left,
he received a fax accusing him of posting illicit materials to the
network and stating that "THE COS IS WILLING TO SETTLE THIS MATTER OUT
OF COURT AND WITHHOLD ANY FURTHER LEGAL OR INVESTIGATIVE ACTION IF YOU
WILL AGREE TO CEASE AND DESIST ALL YOUR ACTIVITY AGAINST THE CHURCH
AND ANSWER SOME OF OUR QUESTIONS TO CLARIFY THIS MATTER." Lerma
reported these events to the FBI and to the 
<A HREF = "http://www.cybercom.net/~rnewman/scientology/media/washpost-12.25.94"><EM>Washington Post</EM>, which
reported them on December 25, 1994</A>, as did the 
<A HREF = "http://www.cybercom.net/~rnewman/scientology/media/ap-1.3.95">Associated Press on January
3, 1995</A>.

<A NAME = "poodle">
<H2>The "Cancelpoodle" Arrives</H2>
</A>

Scientology teachings are sharply divided into two sections. First, a
member attains the state of "clear" by practicing the publicly
available psychological counseling techniques of Dianetics. This
supposedly involves the elimination of the "reactive mind," which is
responsible for all automatic, stimulus-response behavior. After one
becomes "clear," however, the next levels of training are secret and
their content is jealously guarded from the uninitiated. Of these
Operating Thetan (OT) levels, numbering I-VIII, only OTIII had been
publicly exposed after a court case included the teachings of this
level in court exhibits. On December 24, however, someone using an
anonymous remailer in the Netherlands posted OTI, OTII, and "New OT"
(NOTs) issues 34, 35, and 36 to a.r.s. These documents included such
things as a description of how "Teegeeack" (Earth) came to be
populated 75 million years ago by "thetans" (souls) when the evil
ruler Xenu of the Galactic Federation cast them into Hawaiian volcanos
and blew them up with a hydrogen bomb to solve his local
overpopulation problems. Former Scientologist Dennis Erlich, a regular
contributor to the a.r.s newsgroup since August 1994, posted articles
commenting on some of the material and pronounced it genuine.
Suddenly the material Scientology reveals only after the investment of
considerable time and money was accessible to a potential audience of
30 million Internet users.
<P>   On December 27, the COS contacted the Netherlands remailer
operator, who promptly announced to a.r.s that he had disabled the
anonymous account of the user responsible. On the same day, an event
took place which focused the attention of free speech activists on
a.r.s. A person using the name "Harry Jones" issued a cancellation for
an article posted by Dennis Erlich commenting on the OT materials. The
cancellation, issued from an account with Netcom, a San Jose-based
national Internet service provider, was easily traceable to its origin
but was soon followed by more sophisticated cancellation
messages. These later messages were all directed at postings by
Scientology critics, but now were done in such a way that they could
not easily be traced to the account which originated them. The unknown
person responsible for these cancellations was dubbed the
"Cancelpoodle," a variant on the name of the "Cancelmoose." (The
Cancelmoose, an anonymous individual who cancels indiscriminate mass
postings of articles known as "spam," is generally accepted by the
Usenet community. This is because the Cancelmoose does not cancel
articles on the basis of content, but only removes articles which are
widely duplicated and waste disk space and the time of Usenet
readers. He also makes reports on what is cancelled, including a full
copy of the original article, and performs the cancellations in such a
way that site administrators can refuse to accept them at their own
sites. The Cancelpoodle, by contrast, targets specific content in its
decision to cancel.)
<P>   Dozens of postings by a.r.s critics have been cancelled by the
Cancelpoodle, in many cases with a cancellation message that claims
the posting is "CANCELLED BECAUSE OF COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT." Many of
the articles by Scientology critics which have been cancelled,
however, contained either no copyrighted material whatsoever or only
brief quotations falling within the bounds of "fair use" for
commentary and criticism. One of the authors of this article
(Jacobsen) saw several of his critical postings which he considered
fell well within the bounds of "fair use,"cancelled. One of the
earliest articles cancelled by the Cancelpoodle was a "decree of the
commencement of oral trial," a court document from Spain dated
December 12, 1994, describing criminal proceedings initiated against
COS president Heber Jentzch, and leading Spanish Scientologists, for
"felonies of illicit association, threats, coercion, usurpation of
functions, false accusation, simulation of felony, illegal arrest,
crimes against the Tax Administration, crimes against freedom and
safety in the workplace, intrusion, crimes against the public health,
injuries, damages, abuse, slander and inducement to suicide."
<P>   After several weeks of cancellations, Netcom modified its Usenet
software to make it easier to trace the origin of bogus cancellation
messages. The result was that when Netcom cancelled the accounts of
several abusers, cancellations began to surface from accounts at other
Internet service providers. A series of cancellations posted from
Deltanet, a provider based in Orange County, California were issued
from an account obtained by 
<A HREF = "http://www.cybercom.net/~rnewman/scientology/net/deltanet">two persons who showed up late one night
at the Deltanet office shortly before it closed</A>. They had told
Deltanet that they needed immediate access, and paid in cash. The true
identity-or identities-of the Cancelpoodle has yet to become public
knowledge. The COS denies any knowledge or connection with these
activities.
   Regular participants on a.r.s have responded to the Cancelpoodle by
simply reposting whatever is cancelled. One regular even wrote a
program which automatically posts a public notice to a.r.s about any
articles which are cancelled from the newsgroup. Anonymous posters
have also responded by reposting the secret church materials to a wide
variety of other newsgroups on the Usenet, a tactic which has been
condemned by many Scientology critics for its violation of accepted
standards of "netiquette."

<A NAME = "attorneys">
<H2>Enter the Attorneys</H2>
</A>

While the Cancelpoodle was deleting specific postings on a.r.s, church
attorneys initiated action against the newsgroup itself. On January
3, Thomas Small, an attorney for the Religious Technology Center (RTC,
the corporate entity that holds the copyrights and trademarks of
Scientology) <A HREF = "http://www.cybercom.net/~rnewman/scientology/net/remailer-threat">sent notice to the operators of anonymous remailers</A>
stating that two newsgroups were being used to violate the COS's
copyrights. "The spread of infringements and misappropriations by the
users will be lessened if you lock out from your systems the two
newsgroups involved, alt.religion.scientology and
alt.technology.clearing [sic], limiting the potential for reposting
and downloading." Small's notice spoke of impending action against
individual copyright infringers and suggested that remailer operators
might also be the subjects of litigation. He concluded by asking that
remailers "confirm that you have blocked access to these newsgroups
through your remailer. If you are unwilling to do so, we ask that you
inform us as to the reasons for your position." A number of remailers
responded by limiting their ability to be used to post to newsgroups.
<P>   On January 10, RTC attorney Helena K. Kobrin issued 
<A HREF = "http://www.cybercom.net/~rnewman/scientology/net/rmgroup">an "rmgroup"
(remove group) control message</A> for the alt.religion.scientology
newsgroup. In the text of the message, Kobrin offered the following
justification for the removal of the newsgroup: "(1) it was started
with a forged message; (2) [it was] not discussed on alt.config; (3)
it has the name 'scientology' in its title which is a trademark and is
misleading, as a.r.s is mainly used for flamers to attack the
Scientology religion; (4) it has been and continues to be heavily
abused with copyright and trade secret violations and serves no
purpose other than condoning these illegal practices." Since most
Usenet sites don't automatically honor rmgroup commands and since
several prominent Usenetters immediately issued 
<A HREF = "http://www.cybercom.net/~rnewman/scientology/net/newgroup">additional "newgroup"
control messages for the newsgroup</A>, there was no negative effect on
alt.religion.scientology's distribution. In fact, the attempt had the
opposite effect, as it attracted the attention of site administrators
and free speech activists. Many responded to Kobrin's arguments,
pointing out that discussion on alt.config is not a necessity for alt
newsgroups; that the forged "newgroup" was followed by non-forged
"newgroup" messages; and that it is unacceptable practice to "rmgroup"
a newsgroup that is receiving heavy use. Perhaps realizing this tactic
to be a mistake, the church has made no further attempts to remove the
newsgroup. Instead, it has followed through on its threats of
litigation against individual posters mentioned in Thomas Small's
notice to the anonymous remailers.

<A NAME = "erlich">
<H2>The Dennis Erlich Case</H2>
</A>

At 7:30 a.m. on the morning of February 13, 1995, a group of people
showed up at the home of ex-Scientologist Dennis Erlich with a 
<A HREF = "http://www.eff.org/pub/Censorship/CoS_v_the_Net/erlich_seizure.order">"writ
of seizure."</A>  Erlich refused to answer the doorbell and called the
police, but the 911 operator informed him that he had to let his
morning visitors into his home because they had a warrant. Over the
next 7.5 hours, Erlich's personal papers and correspondence, financial
records, and computer were examined.  Photocopies were made, and over
300 floppy diskettes and two 120 MB tape backups were
confiscated. Numerous files were deleted from his computer, leaving it
in an inoperable condition. Erlich was also served with papers
declaring him the subject of a 
<A HREF = "http://www.eff.org/pub/Censorship/CoS_v_the_Net/cos_020895.complaint">lawsuit for copyright infringement,</A>
also naming Tom Klemesrud, system operator of the L.A. Valley College
Bulletin Board System (BBS) which Erlich used, and Netcom, the
Internet provider for that BBS, as defendants. Klemesrud and Netcom
were named on the grounds that they should have taken action to
prevent Erlich's alleged copyright violations from being posted to the
Usenet. A 
<A HREF = "http://www.eff.org/pub/Censorship/CoS_v_the_Net/erlich_tro_021095.order">temporary restraining order</A> was issued against Erlich,
Klemesrud, and Netcom prohibiting the publication of Scientology
materials on the net.
<P>   As early as August 1994, Erlich had exchanged correspondence with
RTC attorney Small about some of his postings to a.r.s. Up until the
raid, Erlich had been an active critic of the church on a.r.s, often
using information from his own experiences of many years in a high
position in the church, posting followup articles to anonymously
posted articles containing church scriptures along with his own
commentary. Erlich's follow-ups contained quotations from the
anonymously posted articles to which he was responding.  Small accused
Erlich of violating church copyrights by posting these church
scriptures without permission. Erlich responded in a September 7,
1994, letter that "I'll be happy to retract but you must first provide
me with the materials whose copyrights I supposedly violated." RTC
then persuaded Northern California District Judge Ron Whyte to approve
the writ of seizure used to raid Erlich's home.
<P>   In a posting to a.r.s on February 14, 1995, Helena Kobrin justified
the raid on the grounds that "Erlich has repeatedly posted published
and unpublished materials on the alt.religion.scientology newsgroup
which are subject to copyrights registered with the United States
Copyright Office.  Attempts by my clients to engage Mr. Erlich in any
meaningful dialogue have met with an absolute refusal to
communicate-he would not even speak with my clients' representatives."
Other Scientologists on the net began a campaign to discredit Erlich,
posting allegations that he had abused his wife and children and even
killed his pets.
<P>   After initial hearings, Klemesrud and Netcom were dropped from the
temporary restraining order, and Judge Whyte made it clear that Dennis
Erlich still had the right to post to a.r.s and comment on Scientology
materials so long as he stays within the bounds of "fair use." After
Erlich posted some additional Scientology materials to the net, the
church filed a motion to have him declared in contempt of court. The
San Francisco law firm of Morrison and Foerster took on Erlich's case,
and through their efforts Judge Whyte suspended further motions in the
case until a hearing scheduled for June 23, 1995. The Electronic
Frontier Foundation has set up a 
<A HREF = "http://www.cybercom.net/~rnewman/scientology/erlich-defense-fund">Dennis Erlich Defense Fund</A> to assist Erlich in paying his court costs.

<A NAME = "penet">
<H2>The Penet Raid</H2>
</A>

Finland is a country known for its respect for independence,
individuality, and privacy. It is fitting, then, that the most used
and best known anonymous remailer, known as anon.penet.fi, is in
Finland. Johan (Julf) Helsingius' Internet remailer handles an
estimated 7,000 postings per day.
<P>   On February 2, 1995, Helsingius was contacted by an American
representative of the Church of Scientology, informing him that his
remailer had been used to publicly post information stolen from a
private Scientology computer and requesting the identity of the
poster. When Helsingius responded that he could not reveal that
information, he was told that Interpol would be making a request to
the Finnish police for the information. The next day, Finnish police
contacted Helsingius requesting the same information, and informed him
that a warrant would be obtained if necessary.
<P>   On February 8, Finnish police arrived at Helsingius' home with a
warrant entitling them to seize information about all users of his
service, but he persuaded them to settle for the identity of the
single requested poster.  This marked the first time that any public
authority has required a remailer to divulge the identity of a
user. But what is perhaps more startling (because of their respect for
privacy) is that the Finnish police almost immediately gave this
information to the Church of Scientology. Helsingius reports that his
legal representative received acknowledgment of receipt of the
information by Scientology within an hour of divulging it to the authorities.
<P>   The Finnish newspaper, <A HREF = "http://www.cybercom.net/~rnewman/scientology/media/helsinki-news-2.18.95"><EM>Helsingin Sanomat</EM>, reported on February 18</A>
that someone had broken into a Scientology computer system and stolen
information that was publicly posted on the Internet via Helsingius'
remailer on January 23. This date led to speculation about what
information taken from the church would cause the Scientologists to
take such drastic measures in response. The speculation has focused
around an article posted to a.r.s via anon.penet.fi on that date by
someone using the name "-AB-" which has subsequently been confirmed to
be the user whose identity was sought and obtained by the Church of
Scientology. Oddly, this article had nothing to do with secret church
teachings, but was about an incident nine days previously involving
Tom Klemesrud, the system operator of the BBS used by Dennis Erlich.

<A NAME = "blood">
<H2>The "Miss Blood" Incident</H2>
</A>

On January 14, Tom Klemesrud visited a Los Angeles bar after returning
from a convention of BBS sysops in Denver. According to Klemesrud, a
woman came up to him at the bar, they began conversing, and then they
went to another bar.  At the second bar the woman allegedly told him
that she was an IRS agent, showing him a laminated ID card with the
letters "IRS" in blue. The subject of Scientology came up, and she
mentioned the names of IRS agents who had been involved with the
investigation of Scientology's tax-exempt status in the
1980s. Eventually, says Klemesrud, they ended up at his home where he
says she asked to see his BBS because she was supposedly investigating
Scientology's tax-exempt status. After asking a few questions about
users of the L.A. Valley College BBS, the woman excused herself to use
the bathroom.  When she did not return immediately, Klemesrud says he
went to check on her and saw blood on the floor through the partially
opened doorway. The woman spread blood around Klemesrud's bathroom,
carpets, chairs, and bed, and police were called to the
scene. According to the police report, the apartment was quiet, there
were bloody jeans on the hall floor, and blood was smeared in the
bathroom and on the bed. Klemesrud was sitting in a chair and the
woman was sitting on the bed. Klemesrud told the officers that his
shotgun was in the kitchen, and they retrieved it from a closet in the
kitchen area. The police report states that Klemesrud said he let her
into his apartment because she claimed to be an IRS agent, and that
she went into the bathroom and began cutting herself. He also reported
that she was trying to frame him in an attempt to silence Church of
Scientology critic Dennis Erlich (the police report confusedly states
that Klemesrud was a "critic for" Scientology). The woman's account in
the police report, on the other hand, stated that they had met in a
bar the previous week and she came to his apartment that evening. She
stated that he loaded his shotgun when she entered the bedroom,
pointed it at her, and stated, "How do you like that, I can kill
anybody I want." She explained the blood as the result of a medical
problem with rectal bleeding and hemorrhoids aggravated by alcohol and
stress, and denied any involvement with Scientology or acquaintance
with anyone in Scientology. Klemesrud says that while he originally
was under the impression that she was cutting herself in the bathroom,
he is now convinced that she was cutting open "a bag, bladder, or
balloon nestled in her crotch" which was filled with blood and which
he both saw and poked when she turned to sit on his bed and spread
blood on it. He maintains that "if this is a medical problem, then she
has an intestine or artery running outside her body filled with cold
almost coagulated blood."
<P>   Klemesrud was arrested on a charge of assault with a deadly weapon
and released on $30,000 bail the next morning, while the woman was
allowed to leave the scene without any examination. A police detective
was subsequently unable to contact her. The District Attorney rejected
the charges, refusing to prosecute.
<P>   Dennis Erlich posted a short account of the incident to a.r.s on
January 15, 1995, while another version of what happened was
anonymously posted on January 23 by "-AB-." The latter posting claimed
that its author "called in a very big favor owed me" to obtain the
name and telephone number of the woman involved in the incident with
Klemesrud, and sent "a trusted friend (aspiring investigative
reporter)" to interview her. This version of the story agreed with
Klemesrud's account that they had only met the evening of the
incident, rather than the week before. It then goes on to claim that
Klemesrud had accused her of being in the CIA, threatened her with a
shotgun, demanded that she have sex with him, and repeatedly
telephoned the Church of Scientology until she called 911. Klemesrud
says that he called the FBI and 911 as she single-mindedly moved
repeatedly between the bathroom and the bedroom and spread blood
around. He grabbed his shotgun from the corner of his bedroom and
placed it in the kitchen, then hid it in the closet. He says that he
never mentioned the CIA, and believed her to be an IRS agent until he
first saw the blood.
<P>   On January 24, the <EM>Los Angeles Times</EM> contacted Scientology for
comment on the story, but the request was declined. That evening,
however, the Church of Scientology's OSA faxed what was apparently a
signed declaration by the woman involved to the Times. This
declaration gives an account of the incident which is virtually
identical to that posted by "-AB-," including the erroneous detail
that Klemesrud had a 10-gauge shotgun (it was a 12-gauge, as described
in the police report). No newspaper article on the incident was
published.
<P>   This incident raises numerous unanswered questions: Who is "-AB-"?
Where did he obtain his information? Why did the Church of Scientology
later fax almost exactly the same information to the <EM>Los Angeles
Times</EM>? Why did the Church of Scientology take such extreme measures to
obtain "-AB-"s identity?  Why would a woman with no connections to
Scientology give her declaration to the Church of Scientology rather
than the police?

<A NAME = "protest">
<H2>Protesting the Church of Scientology</H2>
</A>

On March 13, the authors of this article along with three others
picketed the Scientology building in Mesa, Arizona to protest the
church's treatment of alt.religion.scientology. The Scientologists
called the police, but since picketing is legal in the U.S. provided
it is done in an orderly manner, the policeman advised the picketers
not to cause any disruptions and left. The picketing was quiet and no
disruptions or arguments occurred. Just before the protest ended, the
Scientologists photographed each of the picketers. As the picketers
left the scene, a man with a camera waited to take photographs of
their cars as they drove by, perhaps to obtain license plate
numbers. The protest was relatively uneventful, and prompted one
article in the Religion section of the 
<A HREF = "http://www.cybercom.net/~rnewman/scientology/media/scottsdale-3.18.95"><EM>Scottsdale Tribune</EM> on March 18</A>.
<P>   On March 24, however, 
<A HREF = "http://www.primenet.com/~lippard/pis.html">Eugene Ingram</A>, Scientology's principal
private investigator, showed up at the place of employment of one of
the authors (Jacobsen) and began taking photographs. Recognizing
Ingram, Jacobsen immediately asked him, "Do you have a warrant for
your arrest in Tampa, Florida?" Ingram replied, "Not anymore."
Jacobsen then checked and confirmed that the Tampa warrant for
Ingram's arrest for allegedly impersonating a police officer was still
valid, but Ingram had left. The next evening, Ingram visited
Jacobsen's sister's home and asked about Jacobsen's financial status.
He was told to leave and did so. Ingram was next seen driving through
Jacobsen's neighborhood in such an unusual and frequent manner that
neighbors called the police. At one point, Ingram questioned a
13-year-old neighbor, asking him if he knew Jacobsen, and showing him
one of the photographs taken on March 24. Ingram did not question any
of the adults who were present outside the home at the same time as
the young teen.
<P>   On March 28, Jacobsen was served with a subpoena ordering him to be
deposed by Scientology's in-house attorneys regarding a case filed by
the director of the Cult Awareness Network against a cult front
group. On April 4, Jacobsen received a telephone call from his local
phone company, reporting that someone claiming to be him had made
three attempts to access computer data from his phone bill. These
attempts were unsuccessful only because he had previously placed a
pass code on his phone accounts on the advice of another church critic
who had been subjected to the same intelligence-gathering
technique. These events suggest that the Church of Scientology took
the protest more seriously than an outsider might imagine.

<A NAME = "ruin">
<H2>"Ruin Him Utterly"</H2>
</A>

Why does the Church of Scientology use such an "iron fist" approach to
criticism? Consider what L. Ron Hubbard, founder of the church, taught
was the proper method of handling any perceived outside threat. For
example:
<P>   "The DEFENSE of anything is UNTENABLE. The only way to defend
anything is to ATTACK, and if you ever forget that, then you will lose
every battle you are ever engaged in, whether it is in terms of
personal conversation, public debate, or a court of law. NEVER BE
INTERESTED IN CHARGES. DO, yourself, much MORE CHARGING, and you will
win." (Emphasis in original. L. Ron Hubbard, <EM>Magazine Articles on
Level 0 Checksheet</EM>, p. 54.)
<P>   "The purpose of the suit is to harass and discourage rather than to
win.  The law can be used very easily to harass, and enough harassment
on somebody is simply on the thin edge anyway...will generally be
sufficient to cause his professional decease. If possible, of course,
ruin him utterly" (ibid, p.  55).
<P>   "ENEMY - SP [suppressive person] Order. Fair game. May be deprived
of property or injured by any means by any Scientologist without any
discipline of the Scientologist. May be tricked, sued or lied to or
destroyed" (HCOPL, 18 October 1967, Issue IV).
<P>   "This P/L does not cancel any policy on the treatment or handling
of an SP" (HCOPL, 21 October 1968, the supposed "Cancel" of Fair Game,
which really just abolishes use of the name "fair game.")
<P>   These passages are sacred scripture to a Scientologist, as are all
of Hubbard's writings on Dianetics and Scientology. So, to do other
than attack a perceived enemy would be to contradict church doctrine.

<A NAME = "recent">
<H2>More Recent Events</H2>
</A>

For several weeks, a group of pro-Scientology posters seemed intent on
overwhelming a.r.s with off-topic posts, single paragraph posts of
questionable interest, and single sentence follow-ups to long articles
which requote the entire posting being replied to. Between March 26
and March 30, 1995, for example, just two of these mass posters placed
139 articles on a.r.s between them, for an average of 28 per day. This
tactic was reminiscent not only of the Scientology plans for handling
the group mentioned above, but of a plan suggested by Scientologist
Russell Shaw, who on January 28 posted that the way to stop critics
was to out-post them. "Now, I'm not talking about a paltry 100-200
posts a day. I'm talking about ENOUGH of the success stories to really
'paint over' all of the graffiti. If a particular newsgroup had 100
negative posts a day going to it, then we would need to post at least
2000-3000 success stories a day to that newsgroup." Recently, however,
this technique has been all but abandoned, probably because it is very
simple to "killfile" particular posters so that you don't see their
articles at all.
<P>   More extreme responses have also occurred. Church attorneys have
sent letters suggesting potential legal actions for copyright
violations against at least four other critics. Another a.r.s critic,
Grady Ward, 
<A HREF = "http://www.cybercom.net/~rnewman/scientology/net/threats/grady-visit">received an unannounced visit on April 14</A>
from two Scientologists at his Arcata, California, home. One of the
Scientologists, Jeff Quiros of the San Francisco Church of
Scientology's OSA, drove five hours to Arcata only to leave and return
to San Francisco after Ward phoned police without speaking to him.
<P>   One of the most recent tactics adopted by Scientologists on a.r.s
has been to criticize anonymous posters or those using pseudonyms, as
well as investigate them and reveal their real names. In one case, a
user posting under the name
<A HREF = "http://www.cybercom.net/~rnewman/scientology/net/threats/tarla">TarlaStar was shocked to find her real
name posted to a.r.s</A> by Scientologist Andrew Milne after receiving a
strange phone call from someone named "Judy" claiming to be an
employee of Internet Oklahoma, her network access provider. (Internet
Oklahoma employs no one named Judy.) She was further surprised and
angered when Scientologist "Vera Wallace" (a pseudonym) reposted not
only her real name, but her home address and telephone number.
Wallace wrote to a.r.s on April 11 that "It is Andrew's right, as it
is mine, to post the name of anyone who is hiding behind a phony name
while spewing forth lies...No one is telling you to stop your tirades,
but at the same time, no one can tell me not to find out who you
really are and publish your name for all to see." Other Scientologists
on a.r.s have made similar condemnations of anonymous posting,
contradicting a statement by Los Angeles church spokeswoman Karin Pouw
<A HREF = "http://www.cybercom.net/~rnewman/scientology/media/anon-AP-2.28.95">in a February 28 AP story</A> that "We have nothing against anonymous
posters...It's a great freedom and the right of everyone to
communicate as long as anonymity is not used to cover up a crime."

<A NAME = "conclusion">
<H2>Conclusion</H2>
</A>

It remains to be seen what the long-term consequences of the Internet
conflict are for the Church of Scientology or its critics. Court
documents, declarations, and secret teachings of the church continue
to appear on a.r.s.  The church appears to be willing and able to
engage in further litigation against critics on the basis of copyright
infringement. At the same time, however, Scientology itself faces
legal battles as several high-ranking Scientologists are about to go
on trial in Spain. According to Lawrence Wollersheim, RTC chairman
David Miscavige continues to avoid subpoenas as Wollersheim attempts
to collect the multimillion dollar judgment he was awarded in his case
against the church which went all the way to the U.S.  Supreme Court.
<P>   One thing seems clear, and that is that the critics have the upper
hand on the Internet. The Church of Scientology's usual strategies for
handling critics backfire when harassment is reported on the network
whenever it happens, almost as soon as it happens, potentially to
millions all over the world.

<H1>The "Science" in Scientology
<BR>A Note From the Publisher to Scientologists Reading This Article</H1>
</A>

"Ideas and not battles mark the forward progress of mankind."
<BR>-L. Ron Hubbard, posted on the board room at the Religious Technology Center
in Los Angeles.

<P>It is the policy of <EM>Skeptic</EM> to offer individuals and groups the
opportunity to respond in a subsequent issue to anything written about
them or their claims. A quick glance through the Forum sections of our
back issues will reveal that we are more generous in space and open to
responses of any kind than any other magazine we know. We will extend
The Church of Scientology the same courtesy. The Church of Scientology
may submit a single response to the above article that will be
published in the next issue of <EM>Skeptic</EM>, up to 2,000 words in length.
<P>   Stories of how Scientologists often respond to articles about the
church are legion and legendary. Perhaps they are even exaggerated
(one hopes). Our interest in publishing this article is strictly in
the free speech aspects of communication and debate on the Internet,
not in Scientology or its claims.  <EM>Skeptic</EM> has made no public
statement about the church or its claims, and indeed, if a court
decides that some of what has been posted on the Internet is a
violation of copyright or trade secrets, or surpasses the fair use
guidelines, then we certainly would not endorse such postings (any
more than we would want people republishing our copyrighted articles
without permission). On the other hand, neither do we endorse the
tactics alleged to have been used by Scientologists to silence
actual or potential critics, especially those who have not violated
any copyright or trade secret laws and who merely wish to report on
the activities of the Church, which is perfectly moral and legal. Let
me try to convince you why it is to your benefit not to silence
critics:
<OL>
<LI>    It is bad publicity to try to silence critics. It makes the
public think that you have something to hide and that you are afraid
of something being exposed; like a secret cult or conspiratorial
cabal.
<LI>    It calls attention to the critic and his criticism that might
otherwise have gone unnoticed. E.g., raiding a critic's home resulted
in numerous articles in major newspapers and magazines, as well as
many more postings on the Internet that would not have happened
otherwise.
<LI>    Your critics might be completely right and you would have just
squashed the truth.
<LI>    Your critics might be partially right, and you would have missed
part of the truth.
<LI>    Your critics might be completely wrong, but in the process of
examining their wrong claims, you discover the truth, how thinking can
go wrong, and improve your own thinking skills.
<LI>    In science (and you do call yourself "scientology"), it is not
possible to know the absolute truth about anything, and so we must
always be on the alert for where we have gone wrong and how others
have gone right.
<LI>    Being tolerant of critics means you will have a greater chance
of being tolerated when you are critical.
</OL>
   All of these points, of course, assume an underlying foundation of
rationality, fairness, and an openness to those who do not necessarily
share one's viewpoints.
<P>   An interesting philosophical question that is raised in this debate
is whether religious doctrines received through some form of
revelation, or scientific doctrines discovered in nature, can be
copyrighted, protected, and held in secret. Certainly books, videos,
CDs, magazines, and other forms of communication and publication can
and should be copyrighted. But religious principles and scientific
discoveries themselves? Some say yes, though most scientists and
theologians would say no. The reason is simple. In order to determine
the truth about some claim, the best procedure is to broadcast to as
many people as possible, the claim, the evidence for the claim, and
the theory that best explains the claim (this is called publishing),
in order to get critical feedback. Darwin was a genius at this. He
literally wrote thousands of letters to experts all over the world
asking for criticisms of his theory before he published it. In this
way he defused most criticisms before his book was even
published. Since you have adopted the name "science" in the title of
your church, perhaps you would be interested in receiving critical
feedback on your claims in a scientific manner. If so, perhaps an
experimental protocol could be established to test your claims. If
not, we have no interest in engaging in any hostile exchanges with the
church. If you wish to keep your claims and doctrines secret that is
your business and we will respect this. But this is not how either
science or religion is normally done in the quest for truth. I look
forward to receiving your response.  -Michael Shermer, Publisher

<H1>WILL CREATIONISTS ABANDON CREATION-"SCIENCE"?</H1>
<H2><EM>Scientific Malpractice: The Creation/Evolution Debate</EM>,
<BR>by Ivan L. Zabilka, 1992, Bristol Books, 160 pp.</H2>
<H2><A HREF = "02.1.about-lippard.html">By Jim Lippard</A></H2>

As Ronald L. Numbers' wonderful recent book, <EM>The Creationists: The
Evolution of Scientific Creationism</EM> (1992, Alfred A. Knopf), has
shown, the "scientific creationism" at the center of the current
public creation/evolution debate is relatively new; most of the
best-known "creationists" of the early twentieth century held views
which would jeopardize affiliation with organizations such as the
Institute for Creation Research or the Bible-Science Association.  The
two weakest points of ICR-style creationism are (1) its commitment to
a young (i.e., less than 10,000-year-old) earth and (2) its reliance
on "flood geology," which attributes all fossils to a single
catastrophe, the Noachian deluge.
<P>These two weak points will, I believe, ultimately lead to the
downfall of "scientific creationism" and its replacement in
evangelical and fundamentalist Christian circles by old-earth
creationism, progressive creationism, and, to some extent, theistic
evolution.  While this may occur indirectly as a result of the
anti-creationist activities of organizations such as the National
Center for Science Education and the Skeptics Society, the direct cause
of the demise of young-earth/flood geology creationism is likely to be
popular Christian works which expose its origins and its scientific
and scriptural weaknesses.  Several such works have already been
published: Davis Young's <EM>Christianity and the Age of the Earth</EM>
(1982, Zondervan), Alan Hayward's <EM>Creation and Evolution: The Facts and
Fallacies</EM> (1985, Triangle), Howard Van Till, Davis Young, and Carl
Menninga's <EM>Science Held Hostage</EM> (1988, InterVarsity Press), and Hugh
Ross's <EM>The Fingerprint of God</EM> (2nd edition, 1991, Promise Press) are
four examples (of which the first two are now out of print).
<P>Ivan L. Zabilka's <EM>Scientific Malpractice: The
Creation/Evolution Debate</EM>, a slim paperback from Methodist
publisher Bristol House, appears at first glance to be a new
contribution to the popular Christian literature criticizing the
weaknesses of "scientific creationism."  Despite the title, however,
only a single cursory chapter (the fourth, "The Scientific Arguments
of the Creationists") addresses the scientific aspects of creationism.
The other chapters introduce and define the subject matter of
creationism (chapters one and two) describe the social, political, and
legal history of creationism (chapters three and six), criticize
creationist Bible interpretation (chapter five), and argue that there
is still a role for belief in God and Christianity to play for those
who believe in evolution (chapters seven and eight).
<P>The lack of emphasis on the scientific issues is no doubt at
least a partial explanation of the book's failure to mention any of
the above predecessor Christian works, except for a citation of Davis
Young's book in a footnote (page 155) as an example of someone wrongly
labeled a creationist by opponents of creationism.  (Although Young's
views are probably best described as old-earth creationism, Young
himself concedes the name "creationist" to the young-earth flood
geologists on page 10 of his book.)  I was still surprised to see no
mention of Langdon Gilkey's <EM>Creationism on Trial: Evolution and
God at Little Rock</EM> (1985, Winston Press) or to Roland Mushat
Frye's <EM>Is God a Creationist?</EM> (1983, Scribner's), both of
which would seem to me to be quite useful for a work such as
Zabilka's.
<P>Despite these omissions, Zabilka, who has advanced degrees in
both the history of science and theology, has done a fairly good job
of succinctly describing the issues for the layman with only a passing
interest in the creation/evolution debate.  It is not recommended for
anyone with greater interest, for it relies heavily on secondary
sources and there are much better books which address each of the
specific topics Zabilka covers.  The book is at its best in its
historical chapters; at its weakest in its chapter on the scientific
issues.  The main problem is superficiality; one simply cannot
adequately address the problem of "kinds," the fossil record, the
origin of life, the geological column, radiometric dating,
astronomical evidence for age, the second law of thermodynamics,
probability arguments, the Paluxy River footprints, and creationist
myths about Darwin's deathbed conversion and the "missing day" of
Joshua in a mere twenty- two pages.  A cursory treatment of these
issues is bound to lead to the conclusion, as Zabilka is surely right
to note, that "it is very unlikely that any Creationists can be
persuaded to amend their thought patterns and processes by the
arguments presented here" (p. 142).  Unfortunately, it is also
unlikely that this book will serve to prevent non-creationists from
being persuaded by, or even enable them to successfully argue with,
creationists with any degree of familiarity with the creationist
literature.  For one example, Zabilka's response to the now-infamous
second law of thermodynamics argument is simply that "the Earth and
the biological subsystems upon it are not closed systems since there
is a constant influx of energy from the Sun.  The second law simply
does not apply to evolution."  While this is correct, it is not
sufficient to deal with creationist arguments involving the alleged
necessity of a "program" or a "power converter" to generate order
(e.g., Henry Morris, <EM>Scientific Creationism</EM>, 2nd edition,
1985, pp. 43-44).
<P>There are some errors scattered throughout the book.  One
problem is with names: Zabilka refers several times to Joel
"Craycraft" and "Nils" Eldredge in footnotes (pp. 150-151) and to
creationists "Garry" Parker, "W.L." Wysong, Jimmy "Swaggert," and
Wayne "Friar" (pp. 24, 79, 100) in the main body of the text.  William
Jennings Bryan is branded a biblical literalist firmly in the
creationist camp (p. 46), despite the fact that Bryan was a day-ager
and not a biblical literalist (Numbers, The Creationists, p. 99).
Zabilka claims that the Creation Research Society "broke away" from
the American Scientific Affiliation and that the Creation Science
Research Center, in turn, split off from the CRS (pp. 24-25).  While
several of the CRS's founders were members of the ASA, it never had
any affiliation with that group.  The CSRC effectively split off from
the ICR, not the CRS.  (See Numbers, pp. 222-229 and 284-285.)
<P>Perhaps the two most serious errors are the statement on page
74 that "it is basically inappropriate to apply probability to
previous [i.e., past] events" and f.n. 27 on page 151 regarding
Karl Popper.  The statement about probability is simply false.  While
there is a sense in which past events all have probability 0 or 1
(depending upon whether or not they actually occurred), this is an
uninteresting sense of the word.  One can quite sensibly ask what the
likelihood of particular past actual events was, in light of observed
frequencies of events of certain types and known physical laws.
(Chapter one of John Pollock, <EM>Nomic Probability and the Foundations of
Induction</EM>, 1990, Oxford University Press, discusses various theories
of probability.)
<P>Zabilka's statement about Popper is this:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
A favorite Creationist quotation is from Karl Popper, the philosopher
of science, who once wrote that evolution was not falsifiable in the
same manner as the other hard sciences.  Creationists have quoted this
as meaning that evolution is not falsifiable, and therefore is not
science.  They neglect the phrase "in the same manner."  Popper stated
in an interview that he did not mean that evolution was not
falsifiable, only that the approach had to be different.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
Zabilka cites no sources for this description, which is no surprise
since it is quite inaccurate.  Popper never wrote that evolution was
not falsifiable; he stated that natural selection was not falsifiable.
The phrase "in the same manner" is Zabilka's quote, not Popper's.
Popper simply retracted his statement about natural selection
completely.  (The relevant quotations from Popper may be found in
Frank J. Sonleitner, "What Did Karl Popper Really Say About
Evolution?" <EM>Creation/Evolution</EM> XVIII(Summer 1986):9-14.)
<P>In the last two chapters of the book (especially the
penultimate chapter), Zabilka argues that scientists defending
evolution have occasionally engaged in excesses: using fallacious or
intemperate argument, engaging in metaphysical speculation while
claiming to be doing science, and improperly interpreting history to
draw conclusions about "warfare" between science and religion.  While
many of his comments do hit the mark, the example he selects for more
criticisms than any other work is C. Leon Harris' <EM>Evolution:
Genesis and Revelations</EM> (1981, SUNY Press), a critique of
creationism I had previously been unaware of and which Zabilka himself
admits "is seldom cited by other authors opposed to Creationism"
(p. 154, footnote 3).  Although Zabilka claims that "Some responses in
journals such as The <EM>Skeptical Inquirer</EM> and
<EM>Creation/Evolution</EM> are sarcastic, belittling, and
unprofessional," he gives no examples of such failings from either of
these publications.  He argues in favor of the argument from design,
stating that its opponents have "simply dismissed this issue as 'the
old argument from design,' which does nothing to refute it" (p.  122).
While he elsewhere expresses familiarity with
<EM>Creation/Evolution</EM>, he here ignores the exchange between
Norman Geisler and Fred Edwords on this very subject in that journal
(issues 13 and 17), as well as the voluminous philosophical literature
criticizing the argument from design, from David Hume to J.L.  Mackie
and Michael Martin.  While I agree with Zabilka that science itself
cannot refute the existence of God, it can certainly provide
alternative explanations for many phenomena which have traditionally
been attributed to God.  This has the effect of weakening purported
evidence for God's existence, while leaving a priori arguments
untouched--allowing philosophers of religion to continue debating the
issue.
<P>I can recommend the book to readers of this journal only for
its coverage of historical issues and perhaps for its discussion of
biblical interpretation.  The book as a whole can only be recommended
for those whose interest in the creation/evolution debate is as
superficial as the cursory coverage it offers of the central
scientific issues.

I've talked to many people however that seriously believe that the government has some hidden aliens locked up somewhere - perhaps in the Roswell area - Independence Day added to this craze. I haven't read much about psychic phenomena nor the various other ideas - right now I don't believe in any of it but can't say I've ever taken the time to hear the other sides case. Just ordered Randi's "Flim Flam" and am waiting for the library to get Sagan's "Demon Haunted World". I had to read the Celestine Prophecy a few months ago and I can see clearly why the general public tends to believe in such ideas and the guy did a hell of a good job selling his opinions but as of this moment - I think it's all a bunch of crap and a severe annoyance for a rational mind. Maybe I'm wrong.<br>

: : : : I am certainly open to evidence...As far as I know I can not know and 
: : : : therefore believe (or not believe) in anything...I certainly would
: : : : welcome any proof of anything.  I am totally open to new ideas/theories
: : : : because I have no believes of my own to close my mind.

: : : You wouldn't be human if you didn't have at least somes beliefs. Do you believe that the Earth is a sphere, do you believe in the laws of physics?

: : Who told you I was human...I came in on a UFO from a far away plant...
: : I don't have believes, not in anything...although just to function
: : here (as opposed to my home planet) one has to assume certain things
: : will happen (throw a ball up and it comes down) however I don't believe
: : this is nessasarily the way the universe works or even the world; thats
: : just how it seems right now.

: Don't you believe Descartes' Cogito: &quot;I think, therefore I am&quot;.  If you believe that, and I think it is pretty hard not to, you can start to build on that for other beliefs.

: : : I'm not talking self-programming...I'm saying I may be a machine, nothing
: : : more there is no self no self-determination...I do not think I am merely

: The original question was did I believe I think therefore I am...the answer
: is no-I don't believe that I think....I may simply be the voice of god.

<br>: I can't really think of anything I believe (but I may be wrong)...but<br>: sense I don't believe in my own reason/mind I know that I may not<br>: think anything.<p>What I was saying is that you believe (firmly, it seems) that you don't believe in anything.  A belief that you don't believe is still a belief, thus defeting your argument!  I understand what you are saying.  You should always keep an open mind, all beliefs should be tenative.  Your explaination, 'the way it seems' is correct.  Most people would use the word 'believe' in place of 'the way it seems'.  You choice a diffrent way of explaining it than most.  That is fine, but it is going to cause some confussion at times.  Your argument seems to me to be a samantical one.  The only diffrence is that when others explain the idea, in diffrent words, just about everyone understands.<p>maybe, I missed something.  Please explain it to me if I did.<p>-jeff<br>

: : I can't really think of anything I believe (but I may be wrong)...but
: : sense I don't believe in my own reason/mind I know that I may not
: : think anything.

: What I was saying is that you believe (firmly, it seems) that you don't believe in anything.  A belief that you don't believe is still a belief, thus defeting your argument!  I understand what you are saying.  You should always keep an open mind, all beliefs should be tenative.  Your explaination, 'the way it seems' is correct.  Most people would use the word 'believe' in place of 'the way it seems'.  You choice a diffrent way of explaining it than most.  That is fine, but it is going to cause some confussion at times.  Your argument seems to me to be a samantical one.  The only diffrence is that when others explain the idea, in diffrent words, just about everyone understands.

: maybe, I missed something.  Please explain it to me if I did.

: -jeff

<br>: It seems as though Grasshoper firmly 'believes' that he doesn't believe in anything.  Are you sure that you don't believe.  Do you believe that this way of thinking will create an open mind?<p>No, I don't.Like I had said, It is important to have an open mind, but not so open that one's brains fall out.<br>

<br>: I'm new to this page so I haven't read all these posts; I don't<br>: really know where people stand so I'll just throw out what I think.<br>: I am a full skeptic I do not believe in anything, not people, not history, <br>: not science-nothing, because I can think of alternatives, so I can't know<br>: anything about the nature of the universe or the world.<br>: I see a lot of skeptics not believe in some things, but then believe in<br>: other things?!-respectfully grasshopper<p>It is important to have an open mind, but not so open that one's brains fall out. On the adverse a mind that is so closed that it would make a clam jealous is not way to look at the world either.<br>

: It is important to have an open mind, but not so open that one's brains fall out. On the adverse a mind that is so closed that it would make a clam jealous is not way to look at the world either.

<br>: How about some of the consequences of Genetic Engineering.  Most people believe that you will soon be able to genetically engineer smarter, stronger, healthier etc children (constructive), however, at least initially this will only be available to the privileged and rich.  A lot of people would say that this is morally wrong (including religion?) even though it is constructive.<p>This comes under the heading of "Man Was NEVER meant to know such things" nonsense by those who fear anything which they don't understand. Technology is neither good nor bad in and of itself, it is the use in which it is put that could be considered either moral or immoral. Anything could be used for either for "good" or "evil" purposes. I.E. Atomic energy, it can be used to power our cities or to vaporize them. Is is exclusively good or evil?<p>: Don't get me wrong, I believe that you can construct a value system that does not depend on religion, I just think that it needs to be broader than constructive/destructive.<p>The world isn't black or white, it comes in many shades of grey (Sometimes even in colors) We have to construct a system which allows us to live our lives to their fullests without doing any real harm to others.<br>

: 
: : : I was under the impression that the flame in fire was an example of what physicists call 'plasma' - it's not a gas, or a iquid, or a solid but some fourth state of matter. And, if so, it's pretty common on earth.

: : You're correct about plasma being the most common form of matter/energy, but that is out in space, this state is actually no very common on a planetary surface.

: So, the flame in fire isn't an example of plasma then? I'll have to do some reading on this - when will they ever stop and give me time to catch up. GOD'S TEETH!

<br>: I see your point - I suppose I should have said that from all that science has uncovered there has yet been NO sign of a creator and when using science - a creator isn't taken into consideration unless evidence is found to support one. <br>You Big Bang Theory related to Genesis is probably a good example of an argument on their side - I haven't come across anything to defute it but there most likely is such out there. Can we really  call all that resulted from the Big Bang as light? It was matter and energy in its simplest forms - and while the cosmic egg was a whole there is a bit of evidence to say it was creating 'light' already - turning hydrogen to helium may have been occuring before the big bang - it actually may have had something to do with causeing the eruption in the first place. Anyway, how can you take the first part of Genesis as possible truth when some of the other parts are obviously wrong? Interesting though! I also liked your physics info - thanks for the lesson.<p><br>I do not take any of the "Big Black Book" as literal.  I read it as literature; it is creative writing and poetry.  There are a few examples in history where literary artists intuited the possible before science began tunneling into the matter.  There are even more examples of visual artists doing the same.  For an interesting read on this, look at "Art and Physics; Parallel Visions in Space, Time and Light" by Leonard Shlain.

<br>: <br>: : This idea to include creation "science" on equal footing as science is something crucially important to fight against. Science is by nature atheistic - any scientist must put his religious beliefs aside when experimenting with science. Many people assert that religion can live harmoniously with science but this I cannot agree with - they have always been in conflict, are still, and will continue to be for science denies a Creator. If the creationists make any more headway in this area - humanity will suffer. USA began as a product of the enlightenment - the constitution was based on rationality and intelligence and religion wasn't an influencial factor - we've lost sight of that somewhere and it's important to figure out what went wrong, how to return to the original idea but with modifications necessary due to new knowledge we've gained - though I may take an extreme view in this case - I believe it is imperitive that we keep the church and state separate and that we also keep the church and science separate. <p>: <br>: Hi Amanda,<br>: I'm not sure what you mean by "science denies a creator".  Actually, I'm not sure that it does.  Science is an endeavour which explains and describes features of the physical aspect of the universe (well, energy as well).  In cosmology anyway, it does not claim to explain events prior to what is known as the "Planck Time (10[-43] second).  All that we know does not work well in the time from 0 sec. to the Planck time; the physics is VERY different from what we observe now.  Astrophysicists are uncertain that we'll ever be able to work it out.  Sure, high-energy and quantum physics has demonstrated that particles can appear out of nowhere, but there is an apparent violation of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle... and it is baffling!  What is from before this Planck time is what philosophers and theologians cogitate over.  <p>: I do find a remarkable consonance btw. the Big Bang theory and the Genesis account though.  "Let there be light" and the idea of pure energy in the first 10[-60] sec. (before it crystallized into particles and matter).  Gifted insight, I'd venture to say.<p>I see your point - I suppose I should have said that from all that science has uncovered there has yet been NO sign of a creator and when using science - a creator isn't taken into consideration unless evidence is found to support one. <br>You Big Bang Theory related to Genesis is probably a good example of an argument on their side - I haven't come across anything to defute it but there most likely is such out there. Can we really  call all that resulted from the Big Bang as light? It was matter and energy in its simplest forms - and while the cosmic egg was a whole there is a bit of evidence to say it was creating 'light' already - turning hydrogen to helium may have been occuring before the big bang - it actually may have had something to do with causeing the eruption in the first place. Anyway, how can you take the first part of Genesis as possible truth when some of the other parts are obviously wrong? Interesting though! I also liked your physics info - thanks for the lesson.

: Can you explain this a bit slower and perhaps in more simple language - you've lost me. I once battled through first year physics and all I remember is that it was one heck of a struggle for me to stay afloat. Can you try to explain to me what it is Genesis aludes to and then what it is that has evidence to back it up regarding the Big Bang. Thanks.<p>I'd rather not get into too much fine detail about the physics; this is really not the forum for that.  What I would say about the evidence though is that there is much to support the notion of pure energy at the beginning, and was temporally precedent to matter.<p>1.  The discovery of the cosmic background radiation (which is radiating at a temperature of ~2.7K.  This is what is left of the pure energy at the universe's inception.  It is not matter, but pure radiation... and it is fairly evenly spread-out over the sky.  There are miniscule ripples in the temperature gradient that suggests that the early stages of development saw non-uniform distribution of energy, then matter.<p>2.  The neutrino background.  Neutrinos are similar to, but different from, photons; both are massless particles.  One might even conjecture them being a transitional state between energy and particulate matter.<p>3.  Helium abundance.  Much of the matter in the universe has been formed and reformed, and so has lost its "memory" of the Big Bang.  However, there may be first generation matter in stars and galaxies in the forms of hydrogen and helium.  Theoretical models predict roughly 24% of matter ought to be in the form of helium.  We observe between 23 and 25%; excelent agreement!<p>4.  Antimatter, mini black holes, features of the four fundamental forces, blah....blah....blah....<p>The point is that there is a lot of evidence around to support Mr. Big Bang.  Nucleosynthesis, the formation of atomic nuclei, began after the energy had cooled from expansion and allowed the electromagnetic and strong nuclear force to coagulate the fundamental particles into the more familiar atomic structures observed today.  The notion of an energy field at the beginning is echoed in Genesis, though I must admit that I'm not familiar with the assertion that Jason makes with regard to opacity.  My first guess is that he is correct in what he says, and it does conflict with a LITERAL interpretation of the Creation myth.  But I have already stated my assertion that it is figurative writing, and the allegory is pretty good.  We associate much of energy with photon emission; all you need to do is accelerate a charged particle to do it.  And, after all, kinetic energy is perhaps the most typical form of energy, eh?

: : Can you explain this a bit slower and perhaps in more simple language - you've lost me. I once battled through first year physics and all I remember is that it was one heck of a struggle for me to stay afloat. Can you try to explain to me what it is Genesis aludes to and then what it is that has evidence to back it up regarding the Big Bang. Thanks.

: I'd rather not get into too much fine detail about the physics; this is really not the forum for that.  What I would say about the evidence though is that there is much to support the notion of pure energy at the beginning, and was temporally precedent to matter.

: 1.  The discovery of the cosmic background radiation (which is radiating at a temperature of ~2.7K.  This is what is left of the pure energy at the universe's inception.  It is not matter, but pure radiation... and it is fairly evenly spread-out over the sky.  There are miniscule ripples in the temperature gradient that suggests that the early stages of development saw non-uniform distribution of energy, then matter.

: 2.  The neutrino background.  Neutrinos are similar to, but different from, photons; both are massless particles.  One might even conjecture them being a transitional state between energy and particulate matter.

: 3.  Helium abundance.  Much of the matter in the universe has been formed and reformed, and so has lost its &quot;memory&quot; of the Big Bang.  However, there may be first generation matter in stars and galaxies in the forms of hydrogen and helium.  Theoretical models predict roughly 24% of matter ought to be in the form of helium.  We observe between 23 and 25%; excelent agreement!

: 4.  Antimatter, mini black holes, features of the four fundamental forces, blah....blah....blah....

: The point is that there is a lot of evidence around to support Mr. Big Bang.  Nucleosynthesis, the formation of atomic nuclei, began after the energy had cooled from expansion and allowed the electromagnetic and strong nuclear force to coagulate the fundamental particles into the more familiar atomic structures observed today.  The notion of an energy field at the beginning is echoed in Genesis, though I must admit that I'm not familiar with the assertion that Jason makes with regard to opacity.  My first guess is that he is correct in what he says, and it does conflict with a LITERAL interpretation of the Creation myth.  But I have already stated my assertion that it is figurative writing, and the allegory is pretty good.  We associate much of energy with photon emission; all you need to do is accelerate a charged particle to do it.  And, after all, kinetic energy is perhaps the most typical form of energy, eh?

Those artisans were presenting objects as they would appear if viewed from all sides simultaneously- precisely what one would observe when traveling at luminal velocity<p>From what I've read - during the time the bible was written - the sun was not believed to be the source of the 'main' light - so, it was my understanding that those who wrote the bible believed that the light was created first and a few days later the sun. If I were to believe that these people of 2000 years ago could foresee the big bang - then I'd be willing to believe in anything - tarot cards, runes, alien abduction etc... I don't know anything about the Cubists foreseeing Einstein but if you are right, and considering the time span between one and the other - I think there is more to that possibility than the bible writers knowing something about the Big Bang. The Cubists prophecy might be compared to Nostradamus' prophecy on Hitler - he never actually foresaw WWII and fascism and nazism and Hitler per se - but out of all the prophecies he made (and he made plenty) some could be construed as pertaining to recent events since his death. I just can't see the evidence Tyler - Another book though that might be enjoyable is Tim Callahan's "Bible Prophecy" - I haven't picked it up yet - it's just coming out now - but it looks like a well done piece of work on topics such as this one.

: : : I do understand that there is evidence for the Big Bang - and I thank you for taking the time to write it out in detail - but I do not see at all how &quot;let there be light&quot;  can be interpreted to signify the Big Bang. Why was it not until the evidence was found for such a 'beginning' that people began finding the passages in the bible that might fit into this? What about all of the other passages of the SAME book that obviously do not agree with some of the evidence discovered by science?  

: : 
: : Well, I guess what I'd say to you that light is the most common manifestation of energy, and that the idea of a pure energy inception and &quot;Let there be Light&quot; really say the same thing.  The difference is that figurative writing uses metaphor and allegory and science frames information in mathematics and logical thought.  I am not sure how to eloquate this any better!  I do not feel that, if I am readng you correctly, we are scientifically describing, in retrospect, the events in that Book and that it holds absolute truth throughout its pages.  I am one of the last people you'll find that thinks it able to be taken as literal.  All that I'm stating is that science has described this model, and in looking back I think, &quot;Hmmm.  That is a remarkable coincidence.  Perhaps there was gifted insight here.&quot; I am not saying anything about Divine Revelation.  These human writers had a flash of artistic insight the way that the Cubists of late last century foresaw the developments that Einstein would usher in a decade or so later.  Those artisans were presenting objects as they would appear if viewed from all sides simultaneously- precisely what one would observe when traveling at luminal velocity

: From what I've read - during the time the bible was written - the sun was not believed to be the source of the 'main' light - so, it was my understanding that those who wrote the bible believed that the light was created first and a few days later the sun. If I were to believe that these people of 2000 years ago could foresee the big bang - then I'd be willing to believe in anything - tarot cards, runes, alien abduction etc... I don't know anything about the Cubists foreseeing Einstein but if you are right, and considering the time span between one and the other - I think there is more to that possibility than the bible writers knowing something about the Big Bang. The Cubists prophecy might be compared to Nostradamus' prophecy on Hitler - he never actually foresaw WWII and fascism and nazism and Hitler per se - but out of all the prophecies he made (and he made plenty) some could be construed as pertaining to recent events since his death. I just can't see the evidence Tyler - Another book though that might be enjoyable is Tim Callahan's &quot;Bible Prophecy&quot; - I haven't picked it up yet - it's just coming out now - but it looks like a well done piece of work on topics such as this one.

<br>: This idea to include creation "science" on equal footing as science is something crucially important to fight against. Science is by nature atheistic - any scientist must put his religious beliefs aside when experimenting with science.

In Reply to: <a href="776.html">Science Education crisis</a> posted by Tyler on January 03, 1997 at 08:11:02:<p>
<br>: I have recently been reawaken by the prospect of the religious right movements assertions that Creationism be taught on equal ground with evolution in the science classroom.  I suppose that clear distinctions must be made on what constitutes science, and what does not.  My feeling is that although scientific thinking has in some instances been, and may be in the future, almost doctrinaire in its view of the world, religion is wholly dogmatic in that it derives its truths from a single, unalterable, unverifiable source.  What would a pious person do if faced with evidence contrary to religious tenet?  Is it possible to convince a religious zealot the explanatory power of science in all venues of its reach?  Why is it that the same people who use their televisions and microwave ovens cannot extend their confidences in the scientific enterprise to aspects of the life sciences?  These are rhetorical questions and can be answered by anyone who gives them proper thought.  We are mixing two ways of knowing about the world when this inevitable confrontation arises.  Perhaps the Church should have just burned Galileo at the stake and not given him house arrest!<p>: All cynicism aside, genuine intellectual tolerance is entrenched in the desire to uncover the truth about things.  It must be accompanied by the suspicion that there may be some unwavering thinking going on and even if the theory is confirmed to the point of sending spacecraft to specific points in the Solar System at precise times, there may be something even more fundamental underpinning the appearance.  Science IS different than other ways of knowing in that there are observable consequences to inquiry, and it IS subject to verification. Now having said that, Id add that there can only be various levels of truth assigned to scientific theories according to how internally coherent they are and how well they fit the evidence, and their predictive power.  In science, credibility is the measure between myth and approximations/predictions about the world.  The mathematical ground will reduce the amount of interpretation in the physical sciences, but is less a factor in the life sciences (save population dynamics).  So this theory on evolution is an inductive endeavour, and will always have a larger measure of uncertainty about it than deductive processes- those described within a system of logic.  I believe that both material and abstract scientific truth is only to be found at the end of a correct line of mathematical reasoning.  Truths of an ineffable nature are the purview of artists, philosophers and theologians.  Lets separate them into two different arenas for discussion.  But this is not what the Creationist movement wants for public schools<p>: Now, as far as secondary education is concerned, a central question is whether open-mindedness requires attention to Creationism in the science curricula.  I think everyone agrees that science education is a necessary aspect in producing a well-rounded person, especially in a technological society.  So many decisions today are technically based, and anyone without an inkling of science is destined for apathy and can easily fall prey to charlatanism.  If these issues are to be understood, a familiarity with the natural sciences is requisite, as it has extended our appreciation and understanding of the known universe.  Creationists decree that student ought to be taught both ideas and left to decide the issue for themselves.  Well I think it is folly to expect a 14-year old to be able to make an informed decision on this terribly complicated issue.  We might as well have a surgeon ask this age group whether a heart patient would benefit more from an angioplasty or bypass.<p>: Often, Creationists forward the issue of indoctrination whereby accusations are made against public schools about the dogmatic exclusivity of teaching only the one viewpoint.  Nothing close to indoctrination occurs when the best theory is presented for what it is- a conjecture based on the observables.  Evolution does this, and it predicts quite well.  Creation science does neither.  Additionally, science ed. exposes students to beneficial critical thinking skills, which is of value whenever one wants to make assessments based on context, issues, purposes and consequences rather than on fixed, dogmatic precepts or upon emotional or wistful thinking grounds.<p>: There would be a few aspects about education that would be adversely altered by a Creation treatment in science rooms.  Educators would be put in the position of possibly misleading or confusing students about what otherwise is an eloquent theory that fits the facts.  It does explain a lot, and is not fed only by one avenue of inquiry.  Should we allow another, non-empirical viewpoint to dilute the well-evidenced, researched and documented theory?  Where else in our lives do we allow equal ideas of unequal merit enter into serious  personal or public debate?  The science that evolution researchers and Creation advocates do are uncomparable, primarily because one of them is not science.  How objective can ICR researchers be when they sign a contract which reads that there will be no avenues of inquiry opened that undermine the Biblical account?  If Creationism is to be taught along side of evolution, then we are forced to acknowledge the other mythical ideas about the world in the science classroom.  Who in this country subscribes to, or would allow, the teaching that Earth is supported on the back of an elephant, which in turn is supported by a turtle, which is supported....  It is impossible to instruct students in open-minded, unattenuated inquiry when pursuing these ideas.  Religion stops asking with the turtle.  Science would ask what supports the turtle and the further, necessary question of what supports the turtles support, ad infinitum.  To teach the fallacies of Creation science then, we are actually instructing doublethink- hardly a productive way of thinking!  The only way that I see Creation being discussed in a science setting would be as a comparative tool.  Then one may juxtapose the two ideas about origins in order to demonstrate the difference between free inquiry, and bound inquiry.<p>: A sensible thing to do would be to include the Creation account in a literature or mythology class, though I can hear the moans from the faithful regarding the latter.  But then there would be another issue to deal with.  There would be legal difficulties in presenting on religious veiw to the exclusion of all thers.  It would be folly to have teachers instructing in all 600+ religious outlooks; imagine the headache!  The Creationist cry of, Both or neither in the science classroom is senselessness and severely misguided.  For those unfamiliar with the zeal in which this is occurring, watch and listen to Ralph Reed and the Christian Coalition.<p>This idea to include creation "science" on equal footing as science is something crucially important to fight against. Science is by nature atheistic - any scientist must put his religious beliefs aside when experimenting with science. Many people assert that religion can live harmoniously with science but this I cannot agree with - they have always been in conflict, are still, and will continue to be for science denies a Creator. If the creationists make any more headway in this area - humanity will suffer. USA began as a product of the enlightenment - the constitution was based on rationality and intelligence and religion wasn't an influencial factor - we've lost sight of that somewhere and it's important to figure out what went wrong, how to return to the original idea but with modifications necessary due to new knowledge we've gained - though I may take an extreme view in this case - I believe it is imperitive that we keep the church and state separate and that we also keep the church and science separate.

Now having said that, Id add that there can only be various levels of truth assigned to scientific theories according to how internally coherent they are and how well they fit the evidence, and their predictive power.  In science, credibility is the measure between myth and approximations/predictions about the world.  The mathematical ground will reduce the amount of interpretation in the physical sciences, but is less a factor in the life sciences (save population dynamics).  So this theory on evolution is an inductive endeavour, and will always have a larger measure of uncertainty about it than deductive processes- those described within a system of logic.  I believe that both material and abstract scientific truth is only to be found at the end of a correct line of mathematical reasoning.  Truths of an ineffable nature are the purview of artists, philosophers and theologians.  Lets separate them into two different arenas for discussion.  But this is not what the Creationist movement wants for public schools

: : Now, as far as secondary education is concerned, a central question is whether open-mindedness requires attention to Creationism in the science curricula.  I think everyone agrees that science education is a necessary aspect in producing a well-rounded person, especially in a technological society.  So many decisions today are technically based, and anyone without an inkling of science is destined for apathy and can easily fall prey to charlatanism.  If these issues are to be understood, a familiarity with the natural sciences is requisite, as it has extended our appreciation and understanding of the known universe.  Creationists decree that student ought to be taught both ideas and left to decide the issue for themselves.  Well I think it is folly to expect a 14-year old to be able to make an informed decision on this terribly complicated issue.  We might as well have a surgeon ask this age group whether a heart patient would benefit more from an angioplasty or bypass.

: : Often, Creationists forward the issue of indoctrination whereby accusations are made against public schools about the dogmatic exclusivity of teaching only the one viewpoint.  Nothing close to indoctrination occurs when the best theory is presented for what it is- a conjecture based on the observables.  Evolution does this, and it predicts quite well.  Creation science does neither.  Additionally, science ed. exposes students to beneficial critical thinking skills, which is of value whenever one wants to make assessments based on context, issues, purposes and consequences rather than on fixed, dogmatic precepts or upon emotional or wistful thinking grounds.

: : There would be a few aspects about education that would be adversely altered by a Creation treatment in science rooms.  Educators would be put in the position of possibly misleading or confusing students about what otherwise is an eloquent theory that fits the facts.  It does explain a lot, and is not fed only by one avenue of inquiry.  Should we allow another, non-empirical viewpoint to dilute the well-evidenced, researched and documented theory?  Where else in our lives do we allow equal ideas of unequal merit enter into serious  personal or public debate?  The science that evolution researchers and Creation advocates do are uncomparable, primarily because one of them is not science.  How objective can ICR researchers be when they sign a contract which reads that there will be no avenues of inquiry opened that undermine the Biblical account?  If Creationism is to be taught along side of evolution, then we are forced to acknowledge the other mythical ideas about the world in the science classroom.  Who in this country subscribes to, or would allow, the teaching that Earth is supported on the back of an elephant, which in turn is supported by a turtle, which is supported....  It is impossible to instruct students in open-minded, unattenuated inquiry when pursuing these ideas.  Religion stops asking with the turtle.  Science would ask what supports the turtle and the further, necessary question of what supports the turtles support, ad infinitum.  To teach the fallacies of Creation science then, we are actually instructing doublethink- hardly a productive way of thinking!  The only way that I see Creation being discussed in a science setting would be as a comparative tool.  Then one may juxtapose the two ideas about origins in order to demonstrate the difference between free inquiry, and bound inquiry.

: : A sensible thing to do would be to include the Creation account in a literature or mythology class, though I can hear the moans from the faithful regarding the latter.  But then there would be another issue to deal with.  There would be legal difficulties in presenting on religious veiw to the exclusion of all thers.  It would be folly to have teachers instructing in all 600+ religious outlooks; imagine the headache!  The Creationist cry of, Both or neither in the science classroom is senselessness and severely misguided.  For those unfamiliar with the zeal in which this is occurring, watch and listen to Ralph Reed and the Christian Coalition.

: This idea to include creation &quot;science&quot; on equal footing as science is something crucially important to fight against. Science is by nature atheistic - any scientist must put his religious beliefs aside when experimenting with science. Many people assert that religion can live harmoniously with science but this I cannot agree with - they have always been in conflict, are still, and will continue to be for science denies a Creator. If the creationists make any more headway in this area - humanity will suffer. USA began as a product of the enlightenment - the constitution was based on rationality and intelligence and religion wasn't an influencial factor - we've lost sight of that somewhere and it's important to figure out what went wrong, how to return to the original idea but with modifications necessary due to new knowledge we've gained - though I may take an extreme view in this case - I believe it is imperitive that we keep the church and state separate and that we also keep the church and science separate.

So many decisions today are technically based, and anyone without an inkling of science is destined for apathy and can easily fall prey to charlatanism.  If these issues are to be understood, a familiarity with the natural sciences is requisite, as it has extended our appreciation and understanding of the known universe.  Creationists decree that student ought to be taught both ideas and left to decide the issue for themselves.  Well I think it is folly to expect a 14-year old to be able to make an informed decision on this terribly complicated issue.  We might as well have a surgeon ask this age group whether a heart patient would benefit more from an angioplasty or bypass.

: Often, Creationists forward the issue of indoctrination whereby accusations are made against public schools about the dogmatic exclusivity of teaching only the one viewpoint.  Nothing close to indoctrination occurs when the best theory is presented for what it is- a conjecture based on the observables.  Evolution does this, and it predicts quite well.  Creation science does neither.  Additionally, science ed. exposes students to beneficial critical thinking skills, which is of value whenever one wants to make assessments based on context, issues, purposes and consequences rather than on fixed, dogmatic precepts or upon emotional or wistful thinking grounds.

Where else in our lives do we allow equal ideas of unequal merit enter into serious  personal or public debate?  The science that evolution researchers and Creation advocates do are uncomparable, primarily because one of them is not science.

Who in this country subscribes to, or would allow, the teaching that Earth is supported on the back of an elephant, which in turn is supported by a turtle, which is supported....  It is impossible to instruct students in open-minded, unattenuated inquiry when pursuing these ideas.  Religion stops asking with the turtle.  Science would ask what supports the turtle and the further, necessary question of what supports the turtles support, ad infinitum.

In Reply to: <a href="776.html">Science Education crisis</a> posted by Tyler on January 03, 1997 at 08:11:02:<p>
<p>: I have recently been reawaken by the prospect of the religious right movements assertions that Creationism be taught on equal ground with evolution in the science classroom.  I suppose that clear distinctions must be made on what constitutes science, and what does not.  My feeling is that although scientific thinking has in some instances been, and may be in the future, almost doctrinaire in its view of the world, religion is wholly dogmatic in that it derives its truths from a single, unalterable, unverifiable source.  What would a pious person do if faced with evidence contrary to religious tenet?  Is it possible to convince a religious zealot the explanatory power of science in all venues of its reach?  Why is it that the same people who use their televisions and microwave ovens cannot extend their confidences in the scientific enterprise to aspects of the life sciences?  These are rhetorical questions and can be answered by anyone who gives them proper thought.  We are mixing two ways of knowing about the world when this inevitable confrontation arises.  Perhaps the Church should have just burned Galileo at the stake and not given him house arrest!<p>: All cynicism aside, genuine intellectual tolerance is entrenched in the desire to uncover the truth about things.  It must be accompanied by the suspicion that there may be some unwavering thinking going on and even if the theory is confirmed to the point of sending spacecraft to specific points in the Solar System at precise times, there may be something even more fundamental underpinning the appearance.  Science IS different than other ways of knowing in that there are observable consequences to inquiry, and it IS subject to verification.

I really don't think they are as aggressive as you believe them to be, although they are more aggressive than I would like them to be.  I think they are trying to prevent the elimination of the Christian point of view from the public forum, but I'm personally against school prayer at this point and I don't think a public school is the proper place to get into Creationism.  I certainly don't want someone teaching my child, or anyone elses child, a prayer or anything of a spiritual nature that conflicts with her beliefs.    <br>

: I have recently been reawaken by the prospect of the religious right movements assertions that Creationism be taught on equal ground with evolution in the science classroom.  I suppose that clear distinctions must be made on what constitutes science, and what does not.  My feeling is that although scientific thinking has in some instances been, and may be in the future, almost doctrinaire in its view of the world, religion is wholly dogmatic in that it derives its truths from a single, unalterable, unverifiable source.  What would a pious person do if faced with evidence contrary to religious tenet?  Is it possible to convince a religious zealot the explanatory power of science in all venues of its reach?  Why is it that the same people who use their televisions and microwave ovens cannot extend their confidences in the scientific enterprise to aspects of the life sciences?  These are rhetorical questions and can be answered by anyone who gives them proper thought.  We are mixing two ways of knowing about the world when this inevitable confrontation arises.  Perhaps the Church should have just burned Galileo at the stake and not given him house arrest!<p>: All cynicism aside, genuine intellectual tolerance is entrenched in the desire to uncover the truth about things.  It must be accompanied by the suspicion that there may be some unwavering thinking going on and even if the theory is confirmed to the point of sending spacecraft to specific points in the Solar System at precise times, there may be something even more fundamental underpinning the appearance.  Science IS different than other ways of knowing in that there are observable consequences to inquiry, and it IS subject to verification. Now having said that, Id add that there can only be various levels of truth assigned to scientific theories according to how internally coherent they are and how well they fit the evidence, and their predictive power.  In science, credibility is the measure between myth and approximations/predictions about the world.  The mathematical ground will reduce the amount of interpretation in the physical sciences, but is less a factor in the life sciences (save population dynamics).  So this theory on evolution is an inductive endeavour, and will always have a larger measure of uncertainty about it than deductive processes- those described within a system of logic.  I believe that both material and abstract scientific truth is only to be found at the end of a correct line of mathematical reasoning.  Truths of an ineffable nature are the purview of artists, philosophers and theologians.  Lets separate them into two different arenas for discussion.  But this is not what the Creationist movement wants for public schools<p>: Now, as far as secondary education is concerned, a central question is whether open-mindedness requires attention to Creationism in the science curricula.  I think everyone agrees that science education is a necessary aspect in producing a well-rounded person, especially in a technological society.  So many decisions today are technically based, and anyone without an inkling of science is destined for apathy and can easily fall prey to charlatanism.  If these issues are to be understood, a familiarity with the natural sciences is requisite, as it has extended our appreciation and understanding of the known universe.  Creationists decree that student ought to be taught both ideas and left to decide the issue for themselves.  Well I think it is folly to expect a 14-year old to be able to make an informed decision on this terribly complicated issue.  We might as well have a surgeon ask this age group whether a heart patient would benefit more from an angioplasty or bypass.<p>: Often, Creationists forward the issue of indoctrination whereby accusations are made against public schools about the dogmatic exclusivity of teaching only the one viewpoint.  Nothing close to indoctrination occurs when the best theory is presented for what it is- a conjecture based on the observables.  Evolution does this, and it predicts quite well.  Creation science does neither.  Additionally, science ed. exposes students to beneficial critical thinking skills, which is of value whenever one wants to make assessments based on context, issues, purposes and consequences rather than on fixed, dogmatic precepts or upon emotional or wistful thinking grounds.<p>: There would be a few aspects about education that would be adversely altered by a Creation treatment in science rooms.  Educators would be put in the position of possibly misleading or confusing students about what otherwise is an eloquent theory that fits the facts.  It does explain a lot, and is not fed only by one avenue of inquiry.  Should we allow another, non-empirical viewpoint to dilute the well-evidenced, researched and documented theory?  Where else in our lives do we allow equal ideas of unequal merit enter into serious  personal or public debate?  The science that evolution researchers and Creation advocates do are uncomparable, primarily because one of them is not science.  How objective can ICR researchers be when they sign a contract which reads that there will be no avenues of inquiry opened that undermine the Biblical account?  If Creationism is to be taught along side of evolution, then we are forced to acknowledge the other mythical ideas about the world in the science classroom.  Who in this country subscribes to, or would allow, the teaching that Earth is supported on the back of an elephant, which in turn is supported by a turtle, which is supported....  It is impossible to instruct students in open-minded, unattenuated inquiry when pursuing these ideas.  Religion stops asking with the turtle.  Science would ask what supports the turtle and the further, necessary question of what supports the turtles support, ad infinitum.  To teach the fallacies of Creation science then, we are actually instructing doublethink- hardly a productive way of thinking!

First of all, I think the evolutionist side benefits a lot by stating clearly what science is all about, and its value, rather than conducting the argument on a "we have the truth - you don't" level. Teaching science is inherently problematic. While, in my opinion, the basic point with science is to try to find out things on ones own, teaching has traditionally been a matter of handing down facts (or faith). I suspect that the older view is predominant among the creationist activists, and this would seem like the essential dividing line between the two fields. The issue then would boil down to whether our children shall be taught critical thinking or faith.<p>But of course, this argument hinges on science being characterized by critical thinking and open-mindedness. The fight against creationism and other scientifically disguised religious dogma must therefore go hand in hand with the fight against scientific dogma. As Tyler remarks, scientists from time to time act like doctrinaires. Though scientific doctrines have certain advantages over religious ones (repeatability, observability etc.) the two are closely related and can inflict similar dangers to their societies if taken as literal truth.<p>Therefore, in my opinion, the only faith that should be taught is the faith in oneself, in one's own ability to form opinions and to search the truth. Faith of this kind is is the essence of science, and should be the main argument against the creationists' claims.<p>

First of all, I think the evolutionist side benefits a lot by stating clearly what science is all about, and its value, rather than conducting the argument on a &quot;we have the truth - you don't&quot; level. Teaching science is inherently problematic. While, in my opinion, the basic point with science is to try to find out things on ones own, teaching has traditionally been a matter of handing down facts (or faith). I suspect that the older view is predominant among the creationist activists, and this would seem like the essential dividing line between the two fields. The issue then would boil down to whether our children shall be taught critical thinking or faith.

: But of course, this argument hinges on science being characterized by critical thinking and open-mindedness. The fight against creationism and other scientifically disguised religious dogma must therefore go hand in hand with the fight against scientific dogma. As Tyler remarks, scientists from time to time act like doctrinaires. Though scientific doctrines have certain advantages over religious ones (repeatability, observability etc.) the two are closely related and can inflict similar dangers to their societies if taken as literal truth.

: Therefore, in my opinion, the only faith that should be taught is the faith in oneself, in one's own ability to form opinions and to search the truth. Faith of this kind is is the essence of science, and should be the main argument against the creationists' claims.

: I've been hearing all over the news when ever some Republican or Evangelist comes on they keep talking about Christian family values and morals. Are these things any different than those for everyone else, or are Christians trying to claim that only they can have any of these values and morals in a positive way and that everyone else is automatically immoral and have no real values?

 <br>: I have found that one can tell which denimination a Christian is by the way they swear and curse.<p>Do you have any examples ? That's a funny thought. You should put together a list and make a t-shirt out of it. I have one t-shirt entitled "religions of the world" which covers a one-line philosphy of each - very funny. Never wear it though - I'm liable to get myself killed in these parts.

: Do you have any examples ? That's a funny thought. You should put together a list and make a t-shirt out of it. I have one t-shirt entitled &quot;religions of the world&quot; which covers a one-line philosphy of each - very funny. Never wear it though - I'm liable to get myself killed in these parts.

: : : : : BINGO! We have a BINGO! Stephen, you have hit the nail on the head. I have had many discussions about this and that is exactly what I have been told - every time - by christians. They just can't believe that morality can come from anywhere else.

: : : : It's a shame that so many of them believe this.

: : : 
: : : I have a question.  Who defines what is right and what is wrong?  Let's throw out everything we've got....the Bible and other various religious teachings, all of our civil laws ( which are often based on the ten commandments)...and start fresh.  No law has been written, therefore there is no fear of punishment.  No one has yet decided right or wrong, so there is no fear of retribution or hatred.  Wouldn't each indivual develop their own ideas of right and wrong according to his own point of view.  If so, who decides which ideas are the right ones to base the society on?  Is it the majority in a vote.  What if the majority felt that pedophelia is o.k.?
: : :  I submit that there are laws at work in the universe pertaining to right behavior.  Just as the law of gravity assures that an apple will fall to the ground, the law of God assures that we recieve back more than we give, and when we are selfish everything we grasp at slips through our fingers.  Some call it karma. I call it reaping what you sow.  Have you never found this to be true in your own personal experience?  I believe it works for everyone reguardless of their beliefs, or non-belief, therefore, through trial and error (or reward and correction) we gain a rough idea of right and wrong, reguardless of whether we have knowledge of God's existence or not.
: : : When I came to know Jesus and studied his teachings, and the more I endeavored to build on that relationship, the more sensitive I became to good and evil.  I began to see that it was not enough to hold in an angry thought or hateful feeling, although that's a start.  I began to understand that only love can heal those negative thoughts and feelings at their root.  When someone hurts me, I pray for them.  When someone despises me, I try to do something nice for them.  I may not change what someone else is feeling, but it gives me tranquility
: : : Having said all that, let me reiterate that I'm no angel.  I fall into temptation in many ways.  I lose my temper sometimes.  I feel sorry for myself and get depressed.

In Reply to: <a href="873.html">Christian values and morals?</a> posted by Stephen Charchuk on January 05, 1997 at 19:19:40:<p>
<br>: I've been hearing all over the news when ever some Republican or Evangelist comes on they keep talking about Christian family values and morals. Are these things any different than those for everyone else, or are Christians trying to claim that only they can have any of these values and morals in a positive way and that everyone else is automatically immoral and have no real values?<p><br>Hello Stephen,<p>There are those who are "a law unto themselves".  God esteems those who do what's right over those who claim to love Him and practice what is wrong.

: 
: : I've been hearing all over the news when ever some Republican or Evangelist comes on they keep talking about Christian family values and morals. Are these things any different than those for everyone else, or are Christians trying to claim that only they can have any of these values and morals in a positive way and that everyone else is automatically immoral and have no real values?

: 
: Hello Stephen,

: There are those who are &quot;a law unto themselves&quot;.  God esteems those who do what's right over those who claim to love Him and practice what is wrong.

I feel that I am a rational thinker, so I'm not sure what you mean.  <br>:      It is hard to understand why God chooses some for honor and some for destruction.  I believe it is a topic that every thinking Christian must wrestle with.  The Bible, my only reference on the topic, says we have no right to judge Him for choosing between men, and asks , "Does the potter not have the right to make of the clay what he chooses?  Should the creation ask the Creator, Why have you made me thus?" (not a direct quote...I don't have my bible in front of me)  These are hard sayings, especially to someone who has not had personal knowledge of his loving kindness. <br>:      I was raised in a non-christian home and was pretty much an agnostic 'til I was about 20.  I did not go to church then, nor do I now. (I'm not much of a joiner)  I didn't have any christian friends trying to save me.  I was just making bad choices and leading a miserable life when I decided to open a bible that had been lying around my house since I was a kid.  For the first time, the words jumped off the page at me and melted my heart.  I truely felt His warm, loving presence in my soul.  <br>:      I wish I had a great answer for you.  This one comes down to my faith in His justice, mercy and loving kindness.   I suppose that makes me irrational in your eyes. <p>I realize I might be asking the wrong person, but please let me expand a little. I posit that rational thinking is incompatible with religious faith. Or rather, _consistent_ rationality is. I also assume that free thinking is something good, that it is the way to personal and social health (read: democracy), and that it is intimately associated with rationality.<p>Now, if god gave us these capabilities, and put us in these circumstances, I have trouble understanding why he should not want us to seek the truth by ourselves. Why would he want us to live by faith when this is not only clearly dangerous but also violates the only really special thing about ourselves?<p>This is essentially an argument against fundamentalism, but I supppose most fundamentalists would not subscribe to my premises so it would not lead anywhere hith them. That's why I turn to a "thinking christian" like you. If you could expand a little on the "Does the potter not have the right to make of the clay what he chooses?  Should the creation ask the Creator, Why have you made me thus?" part, I would appreciate it greatly. It sounds to me like god disapproves of human rights (?!).<br>

In Reply to: <a href="447.html">The Problem of Fundamentalism in the World's Major Religions Today </a> posted by Clay S on December 05, 1996 at 07:53:21:<p>
<br>: THE PROBLEM OF FUNDAMENTALISM IN THE WORLDS MAJOR RELIGIONS TODAY <p>: Today I had an encounter with a Christian Fundamentalist while waiting on a student of mine in a school <br>: cafeteria.  I should have known that something was a little strange about this fellow from the "blissed out" <br>: look he gave the heavens as he said a prayer before his meal.  Afterwards, he asked me what I did for a <br>: living.  I told him that I teach Philosophy and Mathematics at a particular university in the USA.  This was <br>: sufficient to open the floodgates of Fundamentalist Proselytizing Zeal.  He asked me where I was going <br>: when I died.  My response was that the question makes little sense and that when human beings die, their <br>: consciousness is extinguished like a fire when water is poured over it.  He told me that it is our relationship <br>: with Jesus Christ that is all-important.  Depending upon this crucial association, he said, our Eternal Destiny <br>: in Heaven or Hell is settled.  When I told him that I left religion up to those who were interested in it and <br>: had little interest eschatological issues of this sort myself, he felt compelled to quote scripture to the effect <br>: that "It is appointed unto every man to live once" and that  "We will all stand before the Throne of <br>: Judgment and be judged according to our relationship with Jesus."  I told him that these views were little <br>: more than anthropomorphic and childish superstitions. He did not understand the word <br>: "anthropomorphism" and was unclear as to the definition of "superstition" as well.  When  he asked me <br>: what a "superstition" was  I told him that it is a belief compounded of legend, myth and wishful thinking <br>: and hence, one which will not withstand logical, empirical, scientific and philosophical scrutiny.  This had <br>: little impact, and he proceeded to talk of Heaven again.  I told him that I am enormously unimpressed with <br>: talk about Heaven especially when such talk seems to utilize religious imagery and religious ideas right out <br>: of Hollywood movies and comic books.  Rudolph Otto ("The Idea of the Holy") and Mircea Eliade ("The <br>: Sacred and the Profane") and Pierre Hadot ("Philosophy as a Way of Life" and "Plotinus or the Simplicity <br>: of Vision") this isnt!! Moreover, when asked where Heaven is located, he seemed at a loss for an answer.  <br>: Even if he had said that Heaven is really another "plane of existence, this would have made little <br>: difference.  This is so since no one has been able to give any intelligible content to another plane of being <br>: in the first place.<p>: Friends, the Fundamentalist Mentality worldwide is a fixed mindset characterized by diverse doctrine, but <br>: with an immutable underlying structure.  Fundamentalism is little more than a sustained  ARGUMENTUM <br>: AD BACULUM - the classic appeal to force.  The underlying structure of this Mindset is that unless one <br>: affirms view X, then God, or the Cosmos, or whatever will see to it that you ETERNALLY PAY for <br>: failure to do so.  Let us review some of the classic ad Baculum arguments in the worlds religions and <br>: philosophies today:<p>: -If you fail to be a Marxist and affirm the socialist and communist doctrines, then the inexorable sweep and <br>: tide of history toward the Classless Society will relegate you, forever, into insignificance.  Moreover, the <br>: Revolution Itself may take your physical life as well!<p>: -Arminian Christians:  Unless you freely choose Gods great gift of Jesus Christ, then you will be damned to <br>: Hell forever<p>: -Calvinistic Christians:  Your eternal salvation or damnation has already been DECREED, to His infinite <br>: Glory, by God in The Inscrutable Counsels of Eternity before the very creation of the world.  He does only <br>: and precisely THAT which PLEASES Him.  If you are unwilling to be Damned for his Sparkling Glory, <br>: then you are surely among the reprobate and unelect.<p>: -Mahayana Buddhist Fundamentalists:  Unless the Mahayana Buddhist Views concerning Inherent <br>: Existence (as taught by the Omniscient Nagarjuna), along with those regarding  Compassion and Nirvana, <br>: are affirmed, one is advocating a philosophical and religious outlook characterized by either Over Negation <br>: on the one hand,  or Under Negation on the other.

: : THE PROBLEM OF FUNDAMENTALISM IN THE WORLDS MAJOR RELIGIONS TODAY 

: : Today I had an encounter with a Christian Fundamentalist while waiting on a student of mine in a school 
: : cafeteria.  I should have known that something was a little strange about this fellow from the &quot;blissed out&quot; 
: : look he gave the heavens as he said a prayer before his meal.  Afterwards, he asked me what I did for a 
: : living.  I told him that I teach Philosophy and Mathematics at a particular university in the USA.  This was 
: : sufficient to open the floodgates of Fundamentalist Proselytizing Zeal.  He asked me where I was going 
: : when I died.  My response was that the question makes little sense and that when human beings die, their 
: : consciousness is extinguished like a fire when water is poured over it.  He told me that it is our relationship 
: : with Jesus Christ that is all-important.  Depending upon this crucial association, he said, our Eternal Destiny 
: : in Heaven or Hell is settled.  When I told him that I left religion up to those who were interested in it and 
: : had little interest eschatological issues of this sort myself, he felt compelled to quote scripture to the effect 
: : that &quot;It is appointed unto every man to live once&quot; and that  &quot;We will all stand before the Throne of 
: : Judgment and be judged according to our relationship with Jesus.&quot;  I told him that these views were little 
: : more than anthropomorphic and childish superstitions. He did not understand the word 
: : &quot;anthropomorphism&quot; and was unclear as to the definition of &quot;superstition&quot; as well.  When  he asked me 
: : what a &quot;superstition&quot; was  I told him that it is a belief compounded of legend, myth and wishful thinking 
: : and hence, one which will not withstand logical, empirical, scientific and philosophical scrutiny.  This had 
: : little impact, and he proceeded to talk of Heaven again.  I told him that I am enormously unimpressed with 
: : talk about Heaven especially when such talk seems to utilize religious imagery and religious ideas right out 
: : of Hollywood movies and comic books.  Rudolph Otto (&quot;The Idea of the Holy&quot;) and Mircea Eliade (&quot;The 
: : Sacred and the Profane&quot;) and Pierre Hadot (&quot;Philosophy as a Way of Life&quot; and &quot;Plotinus or the Simplicity 
: : of Vision&quot;) this isnt!! Moreover, when asked where Heaven is located, he seemed at a loss for an answer.  
: : Even if he had said that Heaven is really another &quot;plane of existence, this would have made little 
: : difference.  This is so since no one has been able to give any intelligible content to another plane of being 
: : in the first place.

: : Friends, the Fundamentalist Mentality worldwide is a fixed mindset characterized by diverse doctrine, but 
: : with an immutable underlying structure.  Fundamentalism is little more than a sustained  ARGUMENTUM 
: : AD BACULUM - the classic appeal to force.  The underlying structure of this Mindset is that unless one 
: : affirms view X, then God, or the Cosmos, or whatever will see to it that you ETERNALLY PAY for 
: : failure to do so.  Let us review some of the classic ad Baculum arguments in the worlds religions and 
: : philosophies today:

: : -If you fail to be a Marxist and affirm the socialist and communist doctrines, then the inexorable sweep and 
: : tide of history toward the Classless Society will relegate you, forever, into insignificance.  Moreover, the 
: : Revolution Itself may take your physical life as well!

: : -Arminian Christians:  Unless you freely choose Gods great gift of Jesus Christ, then you will be damned to 
: : Hell forever

: : -Calvinistic Christians:  Your eternal salvation or damnation has already been DECREED, to His infinite 
: : Glory, by God in The Inscrutable Counsels of Eternity before the very creation of the world.  He does only 
: : and precisely THAT which PLEASES Him.  If you are unwilling to be Damned for his Sparkling Glory, 
: : then you are surely among the reprobate and unelect.

: : -Mahayana Buddhist Fundamentalists:  Unless the Mahayana Buddhist Views concerning Inherent 
: : Existence (as taught by the Omniscient Nagarjuna), along with those regarding  Compassion and Nirvana, 
: : are affirmed, one is advocating a philosophical and religious outlook characterized by either Over Negation 
: : on the one hand,  or Under Negation on the other.  Moreover, if one fails to take the Bodhisattva Vows, 
: : then one is relegated to an inferior Nirvana Forever.  

: : -New Age Fundamentalists:  Unless you affirm that Spiritually involves Following  your Bliss to Infinite 
: : and Eternal Ecstasy along with the Omniscience and Perfection of both our Guru and our Timeless Yogic 
: : Paths,  then your are mired in delusion, hubris and Spiritual Ignorance.

: : Please see that the Fundamentalist Mindset is not only inimical to personal and social harmony, but it is,

THE PROBLEM OF FUNDAMENTALISM IN THE WORLDS MAJOR RELIGIONS TODAY <p>Today I had an encounter with a Christian Fundamentalist while waiting on a student of mine in a school <br>cafeteria.

Not only this, but Fundamentalism is really nothing <br>more than a "fill in the blank" mindset.  Thus the doctrines differ, but the obscurantism, intolerance and <br>implicit violence remain the immutable structural features of this phenomenon.<p>In closing, let me take this opportunity to invite all to construct ADEQUATE religious and philosophical <br>visions of the world that will withstand the most rigorous moral, axiological, logical, philosophical, <br>scientific and Authentically Contemplative scrutiny we can bring to bear upon them.<p>Clay S.<br>

: of Hollywood movies and comic books.  Rudolph Otto (&quot;The Idea of the Holy&quot;) and Mircea Eliade (&quot;The 
: Sacred and the Profane&quot;) and Pierre Hadot (&quot;Philosophy as a Way of Life&quot; and &quot;Plotinus or the Simplicity 
: of Vision&quot;) this isnt!! Moreover, when asked where Heaven is located, he seemed at a loss for an answer.  
: Even if he had said that Heaven is really another &quot;plane of existence, this would have made little 
: difference.  This is so since no one has been able to give any intelligible content to another plane of being 
: in the first place.

: Friends, the Fundamentalist Mentality worldwide is a fixed mindset characterized by diverse doctrine, but 
: with an immutable underlying structure.  Fundamentalism is little more than a sustained  ARGUMENTUM 
: AD BACULUM - the classic appeal to force.  The underlying structure of this Mindset is that unless one 
: affirms view X, then God, or the Cosmos, or whatever will see to it that you ETERNALLY PAY for 
: failure to do so.  Let us review some of the classic ad Baculum arguments in the worlds religions and 
: philosophies today:

: -If you fail to be a Marxist and affirm the socialist and communist doctrines, then the inexorable sweep and 
: tide of history toward the Classless Society will relegate you, forever, into insignificance.  Moreover, the 
: Revolution Itself may take your physical life as well!

: -Arminian Christians:  Unless you freely choose Gods great gift of Jesus Christ, then you will be damned to 
: Hell forever

: -Calvinistic Christians:  Your eternal salvation or damnation has already been DECREED, to His infinite 
: Glory, by God in The Inscrutable Counsels of Eternity before the very creation of the world.  He does only 
: and precisely THAT which PLEASES Him.  If you are unwilling to be Damned for his Sparkling Glory, 
: then you are surely among the reprobate and unelect.

: -Mahayana Buddhist Fundamentalists:  Unless the Mahayana Buddhist Views concerning Inherent 
: Existence (as taught by the Omniscient Nagarjuna), along with those regarding  Compassion and Nirvana, 
: are affirmed, one is advocating a philosophical and religious outlook characterized by either Over Negation 
: on the one hand,  or Under Negation on the other.  Moreover, if one fails to take the Bodhisattva Vows, 
: then one is relegated to an inferior Nirvana Forever.  

: -New Age Fundamentalists:  Unless you affirm that Spiritually involves Following  your Bliss to Infinite 
: and Eternal Ecstasy along with the Omniscience and Perfection of both our Guru and our Timeless Yogic 
: Paths,  then your are mired in delusion, hubris and Spiritual Ignorance.

: Please see that the Fundamentalist Mindset is not only inimical to personal and social harmony, but it is, 
: furthermore, merely a thinly veiled THREAT at best.  Not only this, but Fundamentalism is really nothing 
: more than a &quot;fill in the blank&quot; mindset.  Thus the doctrines differ, but the obscurantism, intolerance and 
: implicit violence remain the immutable structural features of this phenomenon.

: In closing, let me take this opportunity to invite all to construct ADEQUATE religious and philosophical 
: visions of the world that will withstand the most rigorous moral, axiological, logical, philosophical, 
: scientific and Authentically Contemplative scrutiny we can bring to bear upon them.

: Clay S.

:Hello Clay,<br>:I love your postings. They always get me thinking! I am somewhat of a "skeptic" within the Christian religion, in that I am researching the beliefs of all the various denominations, going back to the bible with an open mind, and then trying to "rightly divide the truth".<p>Greetings, Lynn.  Your posts are stimulating as well.  By why do you feel you have to "rightly divide the truth".  New phrase for me.  Is it fundamentalist Xian?<p>:I feel that the type of fundamentalist you are describing has a great love for Jesus and is in great need of a little diplomacy. The scripture tells us not to behave in this way. I do believe though that these people do what they do out of a genuine love for you, and not because they want to feel superior to you.<p>I think Clay was very diplomatic.  I would have politely told the bounder to take a hike and stop ruining my lunch.  My experience is that the vast majority of Xians who proselytize do it because of (1) their love relationship with their Master's admonishments to convert the world, and  (2) zeolotry is an emotional response, along the lines of "if misery loves company, bliss demands it." <p>:As far as going to hell is concerned, I'm not sure there is one, although I do feel there is some sort of punishment for sure.<p>Umm, confusing.  You're not sure theres's punishment when you die, (isn't that hell?) but you do feel there is some sort of punishment for sure?<p>:Perhaps it is only the knowledge that you blew it right before your conciousness ceases to exist. <p>Oh, I wrote too soon.  Perhaps a few seconds of intense regret on the lines of "Rats, I missed the cruise ship!"<p>:It's my understanding that the wages of sin is death, and that the bible says that those who believe in Christ will have eternal life. I have not found any indication that there is eteranl life of any sort for those who do not believe. <p>Now how did you arrive at these two "understandings"?  Are they based on divine revelation, or critical analysis of a broad body of evidence?  Are they based on comparative studies of a wide variety of religous/mystic inerrant revelation, or is your scope just the Bible and its myriad derivative writings?  In more mundane terms, do you buy a car or a house by just examining one item?<p>:And as far as missing out on heaven goes, I don't think people who reject God during their lives on earth would be anymore inclined to love him in the next and, therefore, would be quite unhappy there. <p>Ummm, Clay is this a variant of the _ad_baculum_ line of reasoning you were discussing above or is this something subtly different?  Personally, I'd be very happy with eternal life.  But on the light side, I'd like to do more than sing in the choir for a hundred millenia at a stretch and go "Yeeehaaaaaaa, Boss!! Smite those sinners!"  Would he let me off the hook and just let me spend eternity at the cosmic fishing hole?<p>Lynn, do you consider yourself to be a decent, honorable, loving woman? (Rhetorical question, of course you are, and it shows in your writing.) Is there any child that because of your great love you would comdemn to temporary or eternal torment just because they didn't agree that you were "Lynn" their whole life long?  If you knew of individual "X" who tormented people on that basis, would you think "X" was worthy of approval?<p>Is your vision of God such that "he" is superior to you in every quality?  If superior, why would "he" do what you in your lovingkindness would not?  If inferior, is such a deity worthy of your respect?<p>Hope I don't sound too brutal,<p>P Suster    "ubi dubium, ibi libertas"

: THE PROBLEM OF FUNDAMENTALISM IN THE WORLDS MAJOR RELIGIONS TODAY <p>: Today I had an encounter with a Christian Fundamentalist while waiting on a student of mine in a school <br>: cafeteria.  I should have known that something was a little strange about this fellow from the "blissed out" <br>: look he gave the heavens as he said a prayer before his meal.  Afterwards, he asked me what I did for a <br>: living.  I told him that I teach Philosophy and Mathematics at a particular university in the USA.  This was <br>: sufficient to open the floodgates of Fundamentalist Proselytizing Zeal.  He asked me where I was going <br>: when I died.  My response was that the question makes little sense and that when human beings die, their <br>: consciousness is extinguished like a fire when water is poured over it.  He told me that it is our relationship <br>: with Jesus Christ that is all-important.  Depending upon this crucial association, he said, our Eternal Destiny <br>: in Heaven or Hell is settled.  When I told him that I left religion up to those who were interested in it and <br>: had little interest eschatological issues of this sort myself, he felt compelled to quote scripture to the effect <br>: that "It is appointed unto every man to live once" and that  "We will all stand before the Throne of <br>: Judgment and be judged according to our relationship with Jesus."  I told him that these views were little <br>: more than anthropomorphic and childish superstitions. He did not understand the word <br>: "anthropomorphism" and was unclear as to the definition of "superstition" as well.  When  he asked me <br>: what a "superstition" was  I told him that it is a belief compounded of legend, myth and wishful thinking <br>: and hence, one which will not withstand logical, empirical, scientific and philosophical scrutiny.  This had <br>: little impact, and he proceeded to talk of Heaven again.  I told him that I am enormously unimpressed with <br>: talk about Heaven especially when such talk seems to utilize religious imagery and religious ideas right out <br>: of Hollywood movies and comic books.  Rudolph Otto ("The Idea of the Holy") and Mircea Eliade ("The <br>: Sacred and the Profane") and Pierre Hadot ("Philosophy as a Way of Life" and "Plotinus or the Simplicity <br>: of Vision") this isnt!! Moreover, when asked where Heaven is located, he seemed at a loss for an answer.  <br>: Even if he had said that Heaven is really another "plane of existence, this would have made little <br>: difference.  This is so since no one has been able to give any intelligible content to another plane of being <br>: in the first place.<p>: Friends, the Fundamentalist Mentality worldwide is a fixed mindset characterized by diverse doctrine, but <br>: with an immutable underlying structure.  Fundamentalism is little more than a sustained  ARGUMENTUM <br>: AD BACULUM - the classic appeal to force.  The underlying structure of this Mindset is that unless one <br>: affirms view X, then God, or the Cosmos, or whatever will see to it that you ETERNALLY PAY for <br>: failure to do so.  Let us review some of the classic ad Baculum arguments in the worlds religions and <br>: philosophies today:<p>: -If you fail to be a Marxist and affirm the socialist and communist doctrines, then the inexorable sweep and <br>: tide of history toward the Classless Society will relegate you, forever, into insignificance.  Moreover, the <br>: Revolution Itself may take your physical life as well!<p>: -Arminian Christians:  Unless you freely choose Gods great gift of Jesus Christ, then you will be damned to <br>: Hell forever<p>: -Calvinistic Christians:  Your eternal salvation or damnation has already been DECREED, to His infinite <br>: Glory, by God in The Inscrutable Counsels of Eternity before the very creation of the world.

If you are unwilling to be Damned for his Sparkling Glory, <br>: then you are surely among the reprobate and unelect.<p>: -Mahayana Buddhist Fundamentalists:  Unless the Mahayana Buddhist Views concerning Inherent <br>: Existence (as taught by the Omniscient Nagarjuna), along with those regarding  Compassion and Nirvana, <br>: are affirmed, one is advocating a philosophical and religious outlook characterized by either Over Negation <br>: on the one hand,  or Under Negation on the other.  Moreover, if one fails to take the Bodhisattva Vows, <br>: then one is relegated to an inferior Nirvana Forever.  <p>: -New Age Fundamentalists:  Unless you affirm that Spiritually involves Following  your Bliss to Infinite <br>: and Eternal Ecstasy along with the Omniscience and Perfection of both our Guru and our Timeless Yogic <br>: Paths,  then your are mired in delusion, hubris and Spiritual Ignorance.<p>: Please see that the Fundamentalist Mindset is not only inimical to personal and social harmony, but it is, <br>: furthermore, merely a thinly veiled THREAT at best.

In terms of evangelical fundamentalist<br>Christians this is the driving force behind the view of God as a "personal God".<br>When you are in the company of believers and someone recounts an "answer to<br>prayer" it is not cool to talk about probability or the mathematics of <br>statistics, or even about the circular logic of accepting yes, no, or maybe<br>as legitimate answers from the so called "God of the Universe". Wishful<br>thinking, in my opinion, is what sustains belief in the personal interaction<br>of God in the believers life.<p>The second appeal, and whether it is inherent to all "fundamentalisms" I <br>don't know, is the appeal of absolutes.  I think this is related to the<br>"Argumentum Ad Baculum" you describe, but also has to do with the nature<br>of the mind perhaps. The Christian fundamentalism subscribes to a God who<br>is absolute in every way. Omnipotent, omnipresent, omniscient, all loving, perfectly<br>just, eternal, etc. The appeal of this is as old as religion itself, the<br>perfect answer to all that is unknown. Just as the human mind tries to<br>understand "how things work" perhaps there also is a desire for an <br>answer that is not an answer, ie. an "absolute God belief".<br>

<p>: Obviously we all understand the foolishness of believing in certain<br>: things, but logically the denial of certain unknowable things is<br>: equally foolish...better to not have any beliefs at all <br>: one way or the other.  Because you can not show absolutely<br>: the nature of the universe any belief about it is not based on<br>: logic.<p><br>It's funny...I have the history of the Jews and Christians all written down in the Bible for me, yet to believe what these people say, who actually experienced these events first hand,  is considered foolishness.  No one questions the experiences of, say,  the early settlers in America.  We believe the history books even though we were not there.  You will probably say, "Then, why don't you believe other religious writings?"  I don't doubt the real, supernatural experiences of people of other religions, I just believe that what they are experiencing is not of God.  They have been decieved by lying spirits.<br>

: : Obviously we all understand the foolishness of believing in certain
: : things, but logically the denial of certain unknowable things is
: : equally foolish...better to not have any beliefs at all 
: : one way or the other.  Because you can not show absolutely
: : the nature of the universe any belief about it is not based on
: : logic.

: 
: It's funny...I have the history of the Jews and Christians all written down in the Bible for me, yet to believe what these people say, who actually experienced these events first hand,  is considered foolishness.  No one questions the experiences of, say,  the early settlers in America.  We believe the history books even though we were not there.  You will probably say, &quot;Then, why don't you believe other religious writings?&quot;  I don't doubt the real, supernatural experiences of people of other religions, I just believe that what they are experiencing is not of God.  They have been decieved by lying spirits.

: It's funny...I have the history of the Jews and Christians all written down in the Bible for me, yet to believe what these people say, who actually experienced these events first hand,  is considered foolishness.  No one questions the experiences of, say,  the early settlers in America.  We believe the history books even though we were not there.  You will probably say, "Then, why don't you believe other religious writings?"  I don't doubt the real, supernatural experiences of people of other religions, I just believe that what they are experiencing is not of God.  They have been decieved by lying spirits.<p>We don't take Greek or Egyptian myths as facts either and they are older than Christianity, because of the unprovable nature of their claims. One's experiences of the world around one shape how one will perceive it. If you were to take someone from even 300 years ago and brought them to a late 20th century city they would be amazed at all of the magic that was around them. Most of us know that it is not magic, but technology. We know far more of what is going on then they could ever know.<br>

{ First I want to thank Jason for a very intelligent and honest response to my last post.  The other day while in my bathroom I saw a very ugly sight.  A waterbug. call orkin quick.  Actually I smashed it.  But,not untill I looked and thought about something.  If the atheists were absolutley right.  Then that bug had as much dignity as I do.  The bug ends the same as a human.  <p>Online Webster's defines dignity as "the quality or state of being worthy, honored, or esteemed."  I don't think waterbugs are especially repulsive, and I tend to toss them out the window rather than squash em.  I'll go on record as an atheist that I esteem humans over arthropods.   As to ending the same, well, I think the marvel is that a human's legacy has much more potential than a waterbug.<p>:  Now I want to be careful here because the internet is wide open and I don't want to say anything that would disturb any unstable folks.  But,if I believed that  there was no more to me than a bug.  If I really thought that humans were simply intellegent beasts at heart. No soul.  Then I would be the meanest s.o.b. on the planet.  No limits.  What ever I could get away with. <p>To use your metaphor, we are more than the other intelligent beasts because we do have this remarkable set of evolutionary memes collectively called "intelligence" and "heart."  I submit that in the absence of the supernal overlord(s), the exercise of mercy, compassion, honesty and all other virtues are even more important.  In living one's life to the fullest, the Hebrew maxim of "don't do to others what you don't want to have done to you" is invaluable secular wisdom. I further submit that your exercise of any ethical priniciple because of your desire to succor your fellow man in need is far more go(o)dly than your desire to please a supernatural being.<p>: You have absolutely no right to judge Hitler,Stalin or Manson or Dalmer.  <p>If you and I agree it is desirable for our species to transcend what other species have accomplished, then we absolutely _do_ have the right and ethical responsibility to judge and restrain such monsters.  <p>: Now I am not and will never be a violent person.  I think the people I just named were monsters.  I'm simply giving you a point that any honest atheist has to at least aknowledge.  <p>I think your your point is that without "god" we are amoral and rapacious brutes devoid of virtue.  But I think it is our cultural mores (of which religion is a subset) that indoctrinates what we value and how we treat our fellow man.<p>Please don't start with the glourious evelution of mankind.  It does not change the banility of a souless world.  <p>Well, I can't speak for others but my life is anything but banal.  If you agree with me that thoughts and feelings are the expression of "soul" then we differ only whether it is a given that soul persists after death.  <p>:Fundlementalism always breaks down at it's core.  Reliogous or Atheistic.  It just will not stand up. to a thoughtfull mind.  I think that evelution (and yeah I need spell checker) should be taught as the best answer biologically for science classes.

First I want to thank Jason for a very intelligent and honest response to my last post.  The other day while in my bathroom I saw a very ugly sight.  A waterbug. call orkin quick.  Actually I smashed it.  But,not untill I looked and thought about something.  If the atheists were absolutley right.  Then that bug had as much dignity as I do.  The bug ends the same as a human.  Now I want to be careful here because the internet is wide open and I don't want to say anything that would disturb any unstable folks.  But,if I believed that  there was no more to me than a bug.  If I really thought that humans were simply intellegent beasts at heart. No soul.  Then I would be the meanest s.o.b. on the planet.  No limits.  What ever I could get away with.  You have absolutely no right to judge Hitler,Stalin or Manson or Dalmer.  Now I am not and will never be a violent person.  I think the people I just named were monsters.  I'm simply giving you a point that any honest atheist has to at least aknowledge.  Please don't start with the glourious evelution of mankind.  It does not change the banility of a souless world.  Fundlementalism always breaks down at it's core.  Reliogous or Atheistic.  It just will not stand up. to a thoughtfull mind.  I think that evelution (and yeah I need spell checker) should be taught as the best answer biologically for science classes.  But,be careful of substituting dogma for science.  One thing I have learned in my life.  Everyone has an agenda. on the new age pages you will get fluff and highminded cosmic evolved little gods.  On religion you get some honest quest for understanding and some reliogous mind controll dogma. Same for the new agers.  And on these pages you get the (we are to intellegent to believe in anything but ourselves and what mr.randi and mr.gardner will pat us on the back for.  Well to all of you I say Your god's too small.  And finally please remember.  We can caricature anyone.  From Carl Sagan to Hugh Ross.  But,only when we listen and search can we learn.<p><p><p>

I'm not at all convinced either of the notion that one requires a soul for morality.  How do agnostics and atheists refrain from mass murder, as Amanda pointed out?  I'd say that there are several reasons, religion notwithstanding.  The first may arise from a sense of self-esteem; one cannot bring oneself to the depths of such an act.  Another may be the fear of punishment, though it is clear that capital punishment is no more a deterrent than other forms). People want to direct their destiny in their life, and committing such an act puts that control in the hands of another.  The rather nebulous term "conscience" in my humble opinion, is perhaps the strongest deterrent.  A sane and right-minded person surely feels the dread of hatred directed at you from others.  Granted, Dahmer and Jerry Hessler (recently in my state of Ohio) did not have the capacity to feel shame, remorse and alienation.  But those people are the most distant exceptions to this rule.  If you ever were to carry out a murder, I think that most people here would be incapacitated with the terrible memory of the aftermath of the struggle; your victim's last moment, the lifeless body, not to mention the fear of being apprehended and judged before all (another problem for Biblical literalists).  <p>Psychologists will tell you that even the depraved do not indulge every impulse; desires are held in check by other desires that conflict.  Someone's socially destructive behaviour may be repressed by a fear of God, but it is equally likely that the same result can come from a desire to please friends, be held with esteem in their community, or to be able to reflect upon oneself without disgust.  BUT, if the person has none of these feelings or capabilities, then the abstract concepts of morality will not affect the individual.<p>Now Stephen, I do very much agree with you that atheism is the same one-dimensional thinking that plagues a fundamentalist Biblical literalist (read: Creationist).  Too often these people reduce the infinite down to something that is comprehensible and can be put on display on a fireplace mantle.  These types of people do not think about what they do, they just do it.  I have not observed that sort of constipated thought here from anyone, but I see it frequently in my wife's family, as well as in a few of my other contacts.  Perhaps my judgement has been poisoned by them, but I make an effort to repel them and look at these things without presumption as best I can.  I cannot go with you in saying that the bug is less meaningful than I am.  Yes, I am more evolved from a mental and physical standpoint.  But if you were to visit here from a distant place, say..... Andromeda, I think that what you consider mundane now would intrigue you.  Imagine a class of robots or androids encountering biological life of any sort!  I guess that's the issue isn't it? Perception and interpretation.<p>Incidentally, if you are into Star Trek:TNG, two episodesaddress this issue; The Measure Of A Man, and Silicon Avatar----- check 'em out!

<br>: Now Stephen, I do very much agree with you that atheism is the same one-dimensional thinking that plagues a fundamentalist Biblical literalist (read: Creationist).

Perception and interpretation.<p>: Incidentally, if you are into Star Trek:TNG, two episodesaddress this issue; The Measure Of A Man, and Silicon Avatar----- check 'em out!<p>I can't see at all where you might find similarities between atheists and fundamentalists - it seems that the group of atheists you have been subjected to are a rare bunch. One complaint I hear from many atheists is that they dislike very much having to label themselves at all as many doubt very much that their beliefs are exactly the same as a group of others. Most people call themselves atheists because it is a term that is understood by many and so avoids a long, drawn-out, explanation of one's beliefs. A common question I get asked is "What religion are you?" and I initially reply with "I am not religious" - this gets a puzzled reaction and a look of horror if that person happens to be a theist which is most likely the case - so then to relieve the confusion I make the claim of being an athiest. The only common belief I have found that I share with other athiests is that I do not believe in God. I do realize there are athiests out there that claim right out that there is no god but usually with a little bit of intelligent thought and logical thinking they will see that this is a claim that cannot hold up. All "isms" are a bit scary but it amazes me how many I actually subscribe to - usually though the definitions have been so warped with time that using them without a definition would result in a misunderstanding. If your a skeptic than there's on ism you subscribe to and it's quite obvious that this term is misunderstood by many. Feminism is terribly misunderstood - it means simply that you believe women should do as they please and I would have to agree with that. I suppose I would subscribe to Masculinism too if there were such a term. Anyway, as an atheist, I certainly do think before I act and my thoughts have more than one-dimension - but on issues such as after-life, the existence of God, the soul as a separate entity from the body and various others - I go in the direction of the evidence and the evidence is against the possiblility of all of those things. When the day comes, if it does, that the evidence leans in the other direction - I will happily change my beliefs. As for religious fundamentalists - from all I've read and seen - I at this moment think they are the most dangerous and craziest of the bunch and it's ignorance and fear that pays their way in this world. When the majority opens their eyes, I think we would see them die out (figuratively of course).

: : Now Stephen, I do very much agree with you that atheism is the same one-dimensional thinking that plagues a fundamentalist Biblical literalist (read: Creationist).  Too often these people reduce the infinite down to something that is comprehensible and can be put on display on a fireplace mantle.  These types of people do not think about what they do, they just do it.  I have not observed that sort of constipated thought here from anyone, but I see it frequently in my wife's family, as well as in a few of my other contacts.  Perhaps my judgement has been poisoned by them, but I make an effort to repel them and look at these things without presumption as best I can.  I cannot go with you in saying that the bug is less meaningful than I am.  Yes, I am more evolved from a mental and physical standpoint.  But if you were to visit here from a distant place, say..... Andromeda, I think that what you consider mundane now would intrigue you.  Imagine a class of robots or androids encountering biological life of any sort!  I guess that's the issue isn't it? Perception and interpretation.

: : Incidentally, if you are into Star Trek:TNG, two episodesaddress this issue; The Measure Of A Man, and Silicon Avatar----- check 'em out!

: I can't see at all where you might find similarities between atheists and fundamentalists - it seems that the group of atheists you have been subjected to are a rare bunch. One complaint I hear from many atheists is that they dislike very much having to label themselves at all as many doubt very much that their beliefs are exactly the same as a group of others. Most people call themselves atheists because it is a term that is understood by many and so avoids a long, drawn-out, explanation of one's beliefs. A common question I get asked is &quot;What religion are you?&quot; and I initially reply with &quot;I am not religious&quot; - this gets a puzzled reaction and a look of horror if that person happens to be a theist which is most likely the case - so then to relieve the confusion I make the claim of being an athiest. The only common belief I have found that I share with other athiests is that I do not believe in God. I do realize there are athiests out there that claim right out that there is no god but usually with a little bit of intelligent thought and logical thinking they will see that this is a claim that cannot hold up. All &quot;isms&quot; are a bit scary but it amazes me how many I actually subscribe to - usually though the definitions have been so warped with time that using them without a definition would result in a misunderstanding. If your a skeptic than there's on ism you subscribe to and it's quite obvious that this term is misunderstood by many. Feminism is terribly misunderstood - it means simply that you believe women should do as they please and I would have to agree with that. I suppose I would subscribe to Masculinism too if there were such a term. Anyway, as an atheist, I certainly do think before I act and my thoughts have more than one-dimension - but on issues such as after-life, the existence of God, the soul as a separate entity from the body and various others - I go in the direction of the evidence and the evidence is against the possiblility of all of those things. When the day comes, if it does, that the evidence leans in the other direction - I will happily change my beliefs. As for religious fundamentalists - from all I've read and seen - I at this moment think they are the most dangerous and craziest of the bunch and it's ignorance and fear that pays their way in this world. When the majority opens their eyes, I think we would see them die out (figuratively of course).

It is often attacked by Creationists as an attempt of scientists and their ilk to cover the failings of evolutionary thought.  What they do not realize is that neither deny gradual transition, or the mechanisms involved in traditional evolutionary biology.  I fear that what I do know of the physical sciences and mathematics is balanced by a thin understanding in the life sciences, though I'm working on it.

: The Gould example that immediately comes to mind is his and Mayr's Punctuated Equilibrium model.  It is often attacked by Creationists as an attempt of scientists and their ilk to cover the failings of evolutionary thought.  What they do not realize is that neither deny gradual transition, or the mechanisms involved in traditional evolutionary biology.  I fear that what I do know of the physical sciences and mathematics is balanced by a thin understanding in the life sciences, though I'm working on it.  So, if you haven't already, check out the link... it's a great deal of information!

: Thanx again for the comments- good to hear from you.

<br>: First I want to thank Jason for a very intelligent and honest response to my last post.  The other day while in my bathroom I saw a very ugly sight.  A waterbug. call orkin quick.  Actually I smashed it.  But,not untill I looked and thought about something.  If the atheists were absolutley right.  Then that bug had as much dignity as I do.  The bug ends the same as a human.  Now I want to be careful here because the internet is wide open and I don't want to say anything that would disturb any unstable folks.  But,if I believed that  there was no more to me than a bug.  If I really thought that humans were simply intellegent beasts at heart. No soul.  Then I would be the meanest s.o.b. on the planet.  No limits.  What ever I could get away with.  You have absolutely no right to judge Hitler,Stalin or Manson or Dalmer.  Now I am not and will never be a violent person.  I think the people I just named were monsters.  I'm simply giving you a point that any honest atheist has to at least aknowledge.  Please don't start with the glourious evelution of mankind.  It does not change the banility of a souless world.  Fundlementalism always breaks down at it's core.  Reliogous or Atheistic.  It just will not stand up. to a thoughtfull mind.  I think that evelution (and yeah I need spell checker) should be taught as the best answer biologically for science classes.  But,be careful of substituting dogma for science.  One thing I have learned in my life.  Everyone has an agenda. on the new age pages you will get fluff and highminded cosmic evolved little gods.  On religion you get some honest quest for understanding and some reliogous mind controll dogma. Same for the new agers.  And on these pages you get the (we are to intellegent to believe in anything but ourselves and what mr.randi and mr.gardner will pat us on the back for.  Well to all of you I say Your god's too small.  And finally please remember.  We can caricature anyone.  From Carl Sagan to Hugh Ross.  But,only when we listen and search can we learn.<p>I think you're right in stating that we should always listen and learn but I disagree with you that we "need" a soul in order to stop ourselves from becoming monsters. Your argument doesn't hold much weight when you claim Hitler, Mussolini, Manson and Dahlmer were monsters when you also claim that humans do have souls. Obviously if a soul was the prerequisite for avoiding monsterhood and if all humans possessed one then we wouldn't have ever heard of such people as you referred to. If you claim that they became monsters because they didn't believe they had a soul then this is an empty argument that could never be proved - many people alive today claim not to have a soul yet somehow they refrain from mass murder. I think there are a myriad of reasons why people become what they become - in Hitler's and Mussolini's case it was an abuse of power and a misunderstanding of reality. In Manson's case it was due partially by soceity's influence and in Dahlmer's perhaps a serious chemical imbalance in the brain. I'm sure there are a list of other reasons why they became what they did but I don't see where the soul comes in to the picture. Jason gives an excellent explanation of his beliefs concerning the soul/spirit/mind in the next posting and I agree with him. I think the main reason why people refrain from becoming monsters is that they see that certain actions cause harm to others and for some this is the criteria between right and wrong. This might be an area where science can't be that effective of a tool.

New Age Hedonism and New Age Narcissism<p>(adapted from The Unconscious Quantum by Victor J. Stenger)<p>A decade ago, Fritjof Capra, Marilyn Ferguson, Gary Zukav, and others had predicted that the 1980s would be a revolutionary time "because the whole structure of our society does not correspond with the world-view of emerging scientific thought."  They blamed Classical Physics for all the ills of society and saw the New Physics, especially Quantum Mechanics, as a savior.<p>In her 1990 book, The Quantum Self, Danah Zohar asserts that "Cartesian philosophy wrenched human beings from their familiar social and religious context and thrust us headlong intoour I-centered culture, a culture dominated by egocentricity."   The New Holistic Physics was supposed to teach people to be less selfish, to recognize that they are part of a greater Whole, and to work cooperatively for the benefit of everyone.<p>That no great Holistic Revolution has occurred is the understatement of the millennium.  The facts indicate that even more than the 1970s, which originally had the name, the 1980s were much more the "Me Decade."  Far from recognizing that we are each an inseparable part of the Whole, and everyone pitching in to make the world a better place for its inhabitants, life in the 1980s was characterized by an unprecedented level of individual self-absorption.  And the 1990s, so far, show no sign of a change in this focus on self, as every element of our society is geared to provide maximal short-term self-gratification for its members, while those who fail to be gratified view themselves as victims.<p>Now some will argue that the ever-increasing fixation on self only reinforces the need for a Holistic Philosophy like that of Capra, Ferguson, and Zohar.  They will say that the problem is simply that Holistic Philosophy has not yet taken hold.  This is a fantastic and ludicrous claim and has been used by every religion and philosophy with social and/or political aspirations ever since the beginning of civilization.  In fact, no small portion of the blame for the current excessive self-absorption lies at the feet of the New Age Mysticism.  Anyone listening to New Age Gurus cannot miss the emphasis on the individual finding easy gratification ("COME ONE, COME ALL.  FOLLOW YOUR BLISS TO INFINITE AND ETERNAL HAPPINESS!  ITS BETTER THAN THE BEST SEX!!") rather than sacrificing and selflessly laboring for a better world.  Similar remarks hold good  regarding the views these Gurus propound about meditation, viz., that its all bliss and should make you feel wonderful.  If not, you are doing something wrong.  <p>This is in stark contrast to the truth:  profound and transfigurative meditation is exceedingly painful.  St. John of the Cross did not call the Path to the Unitive State THE DARK NIGHT OF THE SOUL for nothing. <p>Holistic Hedonistic Philosophy is the perfect self-delusion for the spoiled brats of any age, all decked out in the latest fashions, who love to talk about solving the problems of the world but have absolutely no intention, or do not even see the need, of sacrificing and sweating a drop in achievement of this noble goal.  There is also the regrettable and wholly erroneous denigration of Classical Reductionist Physics and Scientific Materialism as wholly unspiritual and responsible for turning people into egotists.  The truth, however, is that Reductionist Classical Physics does not make people egoists.  People were egoists long before Classical Physics!  In fact, Classical and Quantum Physics have nothing to say about human beings except that they are material objects like rocks and trees, made of nothing more than the same atoms - just fantastically more complex and more cleverly organized by the impersonal forces of self-organization and evolution.  This is hardly a philosophical basis for narcissism!<p><br>This new Cosmythology, on the other hand, feeds our delusions of personal importance.  Quantum Holism tells us  that we are part of an Immortal Cosmic Mind with the power to perform miracles and, as actress Shirley MacLaine has said, to make our own reality.  Who needs God when we, ourselves, are God?  Thoughts of our participation in Cosmic Consciousness inflate our egos to the point where we can ignore our shortcomings and even forget our mortality.  <p>Yes indeed, New Age Religions mainly provide a means for escaping reality.  In the United States, where self-gratification has reached heights never dreamed of in ancient Rome, where self-esteem is more important than being able to read, and where self-help requires no more effort than popping in a cassette, the myth of  Quantum Consciousness is just what the therapist ordered.  <p>Quantum Consciousness is a grossly misapplied version of ancient Hindu and Buddhist philosophy which were and are based on the notion that only by the complete rejection of the delusive sense-of-self can one find inner peace in this world of incessant flux, suffering, and hopelessness.  The literal meaning of Nirvana as Extinction has been completely obscured by The Cosmic Bliss Seekers of The New Age Superstitions. Far from attempting the painful dissolution of  the ego, as advocated by any form of Authentic Spirituality, New Age Holism puts it on a pedestal and proposes that it, or the Guru, or both, be worshipped.  Capra and his colleagues say they are putting a modern face on ancient Eastern philosophy.  But, on the contrary, they are  covering a Noble Edifice with hedonistic graffiti.  Where they see similarities between the new and the old mysticisms, I see only contrasts.  Where they promote the new Cosmythology as an antidote for self-absorption, I assert that they are manufacturing a drug which <p>induces.  And while they blame Reductionist Rationalist Science and Scientific Materialism for the ills of the world, I hold both as a source of genuine hope for reducing their severity -  if only we and our successors can find the wisdom to use them properly and in time.  <p>Clay S.<p>From "The Unconscious Quantum" by Victor J. Stenger, published by Prometheus Press.

: New Age Hedonism and New Age Narcissism

: (adapted from The Unconscious Quantum by Victor J. Stenger)

: A decade ago, Fritjof Capra, Marilyn Ferguson, Gary Zukav, and others had predicted that the 1980s would be a revolutionary time &quot;because the whole structure of our society does not correspond with the world-view of emerging scientific thought.&quot;  They blamed Classical Physics for all the ills of society and saw the New Physics, especially Quantum Mechanics, as a savior.

: In her 1990 book, The Quantum Self, Danah Zohar asserts that &quot;Cartesian philosophy wrenched human beings from their familiar social and religious context and thrust us headlong intoour I-centered culture, a culture dominated by egocentricity.&quot;   The New Holistic Physics was supposed to teach people to be less selfish, to recognize that they are part of a greater Whole, and to work cooperatively for the benefit of everyone.

: That no great Holistic Revolution has occurred is the understatement of the millennium.  The facts indicate that even more than the 1970s, which originally had the name, the 1980s were much more the &quot;Me Decade.&quot;  Far from recognizing that we are each an inseparable part of the Whole, and everyone pitching in to make the world a better place for its inhabitants, life in the 1980s was characterized by an unprecedented level of individual self-absorption.

: Now some will argue that the ever-increasing fixation on self only reinforces the need for a Holistic Philosophy like that of Capra, Ferguson, and Zohar.  They will say that the problem is simply that Holistic Philosophy has not yet taken hold.  This is a fantastic and ludicrous claim and has been used by every religion and philosophy with social and/or political aspirations ever since the beginning of civilization.  In fact, no small portion of the blame for the current excessive self-absorption lies at the feet of the New Age Mysticism.  Anyone listening to New Age Gurus cannot miss the emphasis on the individual finding easy gratification (&quot;COME ONE, COME ALL.  FOLLOW YOUR BLISS TO INFINITE AND ETERNAL HAPPINESS!  ITS BETTER THAN THE BEST SEX!!&quot;) rather than sacrificing and selflessly laboring for a better world.  Similar remarks hold good  regarding the views these Gurus propound about meditation, viz., that its all bliss and should make you feel wonderful.  If not, you are doing something wrong.  

: This is in stark contrast to the truth:  profound and transfigurative meditation is exceedingly painful.  St. John of the Cross did not call the Path to the Unitive State THE DARK NIGHT OF THE SOUL for nothing. 

: Holistic Hedonistic Philosophy is the perfect self-delusion for the spoiled brats of any age, all decked out in the latest fashions, who love to talk about solving the problems of the world but have absolutely no intention, or do not even see the need, of sacrificing and sweating a drop in achievement of this noble goal.  There is also the regrettable and wholly erroneous denigration of Classical Reductionist Physics and Scientific Materialism as wholly unspiritual and responsible for turning people into egotists.  The truth, however, is that Reductionist Classical Physics does not make people egoists.  People were egoists long before Classical Physics!  In fact, Classical and Quantum Physics have nothing to say about human beings except that they are material objects like rocks and trees, made of nothing more than the same atoms - just fantastically more complex and more cleverly organized by the impersonal forces of self-organization and evolution.  This is hardly a philosophical basis for narcissism!

: 
: This new Cosmythology, on the other hand, feeds our delusions of personal importance.  Quantum Holism tells us  that we are part of an Immortal Cosmic Mind with the power to perform miracles and, as actress Shirley MacLaine has said, to make our own reality.  Who needs God when we, ourselves, are God?  Thoughts of our participation in Cosmic Consciousness inflate our egos to the point where we can ignore our shortcomings and even forget our mortality.  

: Yes indeed, New Age Religions mainly provide a means for escaping reality.  In the United States, where self-gratification has reached heights never dreamed of in ancient Rome, where self-esteem is more important than being able to read, and where self-help requires no more effort than popping in a cassette, the myth of  Quantum Consciousness is just what the therapist ordered.  

: Quantum Consciousness is a grossly misapplied version of ancient Hindu and Buddhist philosophy which were and are based on the notion that only by the complete rejection of the delusive sense-of-self can one find inner peace in this world of incessant flux, suffering, and hopelessness.  The literal meaning of Nirvana as Extinction has been completely obscured by The Cosmic Bliss Seekers of The New Age Superstitions. Far from attempting the painful dissolution of  the ego, as advocated by any form of Authentic Spirituality, New Age Holism puts it on a pedestal and proposes that it, or the Guru, or both, be worshipped.  Capra and his colleagues say they are putting a modern face on ancient Eastern philosophy.  But, on the contrary, they are  covering a Noble Edifice with hedonistic graffiti.  Where they see similarities between the new and the old mysticisms, I see only contrasts.  Where they promote the new Cosmythology as an antidote for self-absorption, I assert that they are manufacturing a drug which 

: induces.  And while they blame Reductionist Rationalist Science and Scientific Materialism for the ills of the world, I hold both as a source of genuine hope for reducing their severity -  if only we and our successors can find the wisdom to use them properly and in time.

Everyone will check this out no doubt!   Here's another discovery I don't understand. The cellular attraction which brings together the egg-cell and sperm is due to a chemical action allied to smell or taste!? What does that mean allied to smell or taste? All of these subjects I've been posting are written about briefly in a book I'm reading that isn't really scientific so instead of doing the time-consuming, exhausting research of the various ideas I thought I'd follow that path of least resistance and see if anyone here knew anything about it. The book was published in 1969 so I imagine there have been quite a few advances made in such areas - each new day, I find I'm falling further and further behind! This particular concept is also called "cellular affinity" or "sexual cell-love" - it certainly confirms my theory that scientists are the wittiest people around.

In Reply to: <a href="479.html">Re: creationism...Why is it necessary to refute Creationism in order to validate scientific discovery.  Of all people, scientists should find it impossible to believe otherwise.  The complexities of nature show that there is surely a Grand Designer.  To me, it's very hard to imagine that the universe appeared out of nothing and created itself.  Perhpaps scientists are merely discovering the means by which God did the creating.</a> posted by Lynn on December 09, 1996 at 15:11:03:<p>

: : : : Dear Peter,
: : : :      I feel you have missed my entire point.  When put it into the simplest terms, it comes down to this...You either believe that the universe has it's own intelligence and created itself, all this happened by accident, or that there is a God who created this universe.  It takes faith to believe whichever theory you choose, since no one can prove that his set of beliefs is the right one.  I choose the latter of the three possibilities.  Can you prove me wrong?

: : : I can't prove you wrong but as someone posted in an earlier note if you say 
: : : God created the universe you open yourself to the question &quot;Who created
: : : God?&quot;  And don't try to tell me that &quot;God is&quot; or you have to accept people
: : : who say &quot;The universe is&quot;.  As you rightly point out, you have to have a
: : : set of beliefs whatever you believe, its just that for me there is far
: : : more evidence to support a big bang than a God and again, to me, it is far
: : : more likely that matter is created from nothing than an all-powerful,
: : : omniscient super-being.

: : 
: : You have every right to your opinion.  Thanks for acknowledging my point.

: : Lynn

: I might be late in this discussion but some experiments you might not
: be aware of - Pulling particles out of the vacuum a nuclear experiment.
: Virtual particles in quantum electromagnetic theory have been 
: confirmed.
: The Big Bang theory calls for a universe that created itself. This is no
: big stunt anymore since self creation can be whitnessed in many labs.
: Apparently the initial point was nothing. Some time later and therafter
: the positive rest mass plus kinetic energy was canceled by the 
: negative gravitational potential energy so today it still adds up to
: nothing. Information like writing on ice can be easily erased and that
: is what our planet is made of.
: For a more rigorous treatment write me at pk3.14@juno.com.

When put it into the simplest terms, it comes down to this...You either believe that the universe has it's own intelligence and created itself, all this happened by accident, or that there is a God who created this universe.  It takes faith to believe whichever theory you choose, since no one can prove that his set of beliefs is the right one.  I choose the latter of the three possibilities.  Can you prove me wrong?

: I can't prove you wrong but as someone posted in an earlier note if you say

: God?&quot;  And don't try to tell me that &quot;God is&quot; or you have to accept people
: who say &quot;The universe is&quot;.  As you rightly point out, you have to have a

No Victoria, there isn't a Santa Claus.  Nature is a grand old show, to be sure.  Full of nooks and crannies we never could have imagined, even in our right minds.  Exciting new discoveries around every corner.  Our pathetic little twelve pound monkey brains try so valiantly to keep up.  Huff.  Puff.  Pass me that Prozac or I'll blow your house down.  But, alas, the scope of the endeavor is truly, madly, deeply, way beyond our capacity to begin imagining.  A=B: B=C: therefore A=C.  Sure, that's okay for moving a rhomboid around a point on a graph, but as far as accurately describing a dynamic, evolving, chaotic, system of staggering complexity, well, let's just say "Pathetically Inadequate" and leave it at that.  You could strap Marlon Perkins into a helicopter and forcefeed him Gatorade and banana Power Bars for the next thousand years, all the while ceaselessly circling the globe, and you still would not have witnessed one tenth of the crazy little dramas that unfold throughout Nature continuously.  Nature!  Heck, why stop there?  The Cosmos.  The unbounded, unfathomable expanse of space/time.  The fact that Nature's complexities remain more than a match for the fitful spark of human understanding should come as no surprise.  Sure, we've come up with some pretty impressive (by our standards) theories in this last hundred years or so, but many of our most revolutionary breakthroughs only lead us to equally more impressive conundrums.  Like where quantum theory informs us that if no one's in the forest to witness the falling of the famous tree, then not only are we unsure of the noise it may have generated, but we can't even say for certain that the forest exists at all.  Thus I am at ease with my ignorance.  In fact, I flaunt it.  "I have no truck with the inner workings of the universe", I tell people, "So don't come to me when the lights go out".  I do not suffer the need to have "It" all wrapped up for me in a pretty box with a big bow and curly ribbons on top.  And the fact that it's all beyond the limits of my puny brainpower most certainly does not lead me to assign some kind of Creator, or Prime Mover category at the root of it all.  In fact, just the opposite, because by imposing a human, limited, concept of "God" over top of everything, all I effectively accomplish is to thrust my own limitations over the boundless universe.  Sure it's complex.  Why does that mean somebody had to design it?  Sure, it's hard to imagine it appearing out of nowhere.  So what?  Am I then justified in saying "Because it's beyond my personal powers of comprehension, well then, here's how it was done--I'll leave the details to your imagination, of course."  No thanks.  I'm not that arrogant.

: No Victoria, there isn't a Santa Claus.  Nature is a grand old show, to be sure.  Full of nooks and crannies we never could have imagined, even in our right minds.  Exciting new discoveries around every corner.  Our pathetic little twelve pound monkey brains try so valiantly to keep up.  Huff.  Puff.  Pass me that Prozac or I'll blow your house down.  But, alas, the scope of the endeavor is truly, madly, deeply, way beyond our capacity to begin imagining.  A=B: B=C: therefore A=C.  Sure, that's okay for moving a rhomboid around a point on a graph, but as far as accurately describing a dynamic, evolving, chaotic, system of staggering complexity, well, let's just say &quot;Pathetically Inadequate&quot; and leave it at that.  You could strap Marlon Perkins into a helicopter and forcefeed him Gatorade and banana Power Bars for the next thousand years, all the while ceaselessly circling the globe, and you still would not have witnessed one tenth of the crazy little dramas that unfold throughout Nature continuously.  Nature!  Heck, why stop there?  The Cosmos.  The unbounded, unfathomable expanse of space/time.  The fact that Nature's complexities remain more than a match for the fitful spark of human understanding should come as no surprise.  Sure, we've come up with some pretty impressive (by our standards) theories in this last hundred years or so, but many of our most revolutionary breakthroughs only lead us to equally more impressive conundrums.  Like where quantum theory informs us that if no one's in the forest to witness the falling of the famous tree, then not only are we unsure of the noise it may have generated, but we can't even say for certain that the forest exists at all.  Thus I am at ease with my ignorance.  In fact, I flaunt it.  &quot;I have no truck with the inner workings of the universe&quot;, I tell people, &quot;So don't come to me when the lights go out&quot;.  I do not suffer the need to have &quot;It&quot; all wrapped up for me in a pretty box with a big bow and curly ribbons on top.  And the fact that it's all beyond the limits of my puny brainpower most certainly does not lead me to assign some kind of Creator, or Prime Mover category at the root of it all.  In fact, just the opposite, because by imposing a human, limited, concept of &quot;God&quot; over top of everything, all I effectively accomplish is to thrust my own limitations over the boundless universe.  Sure it's complex.  Why does that mean somebody had to design it?  Sure, it's hard to imagine it appearing out of nowhere.  So what?  Am I then justified in saying &quot;Because it's beyond my personal powers of comprehension, well then, here's how it was done--I'll leave the details to your imagination, of course.&quot;  No thanks.  I'm not that arrogant.

<br>: : I believe that the Bible IS the word of God.  It is my guidebook for truth.  Not everyone agrees with me, what can I say?<p>: How much of the actual history of the putting together, chosing, and editing of the books in the bible to you know?<p>If the bible is the word of God Lynn, which there is much evidence against, how can you possibly love a God that inspired such words? You will not find anywhere else in ancient writings women treated with more contempt and disdain than in those inspired fables. God tells Moses that a woman who gives birth will be unclean for seven days if it is a male child, two weeks if it is a female child and either/or she must at the end of her confinement make a sin offering - it also tells in great detail that all that she touches or all that touches her during this time will be unclean. Women of the bible are synonymous with slaves and domestic animals. Paul - the founder of Christianity has a philosphy that basically states - any male fool is even superior than the most intelligent of women. He also says "Let a woman learn in quietness with all subjection. But I permit not a woman to teach, nor to have dominion over a man, but to be in quietness...Let the woman keep silence in the churches; for it is not permitted unto them to speak. But let them be in subjection as also saith the law. And if they would learn anything, let them ask their own husband at home; for it is shameful for a woman to speak in the church." There's another line in there somewhere that was supposedly inspired by God that goes "Fierce is the dragon and cunning the asp; but woman has the malice of both." As I'm sure you know, one of the big steps that helped Christianity become the super power it has is when it was embraced by the Roman Emperor Constantine - before then Roman law was quite favorable to women but with Christianity this was all modified extremely. The most obstacles that were put in the way of woman's legal emancipation was from the church. The condemnation of women as a sex, the attributing to her of everthing that is vile, hateful and malicious, was responsible for the witch burnings that I'm sure you're familiar with. The Christian Church was responsible for 9 MILLION women being burned for sorcery and my educated guess is that not one of those women were witches. It was believed then that women were in league with the devil, they were the cause of plagues, epidemics, misfortunes, calamities, disasters. Solomon says "What is woman but an enemy of friendship, an aviodable punishment, a necessary evil, a natural temptation, a desirable affliction, a constantly flowing source of tears, a wicked work of nature covered with a shining varnish?" As you can see I hope, the bible is the cause of the oppression of women and the attitudes that still prevail today. Ask yourself what Christianity has done for women and if you still claim to be one - please, tell me your reasons.

Do you think they were treated as equals before the law was handed down?  Get real.  These people were barbarians.  The last thing a woman wants when she's on her period or just given birth, is some smelly nomad foisting himself upon her. <br>The quote sited by Solomon surely reflects the thoughts of any man who's been burned.  This also is not a description of a godly woman.<br>Perhaps you should also ready the Songs of Solomon or some of the many other passages that speak of women in the most affectionate terms.<br>Now...I will not disagree with anyone that the CAtholic church has done many horrible things.  They claim to be the first church, but I merely see them as the first government sanctioned church.  They  mixed Christianity with the pagan religions of Rome.  Christmas is a good example.  Besides, in those times, I'm sure it wasn't only christians who were ignorant and misguided.  Also, people were illiterate, and even if they could read, would not have had access to a bible in those times.  The teachings of a corrupt church were all they had.  You'll have to admit, that things are different now.<p><br>

: : : : 
: : : : : : I believe that the Bible IS the word of God.  It is my guidebook for truth.  Not everyone agrees with me, what can I say?

: : : : : How much of the actual history of the putting together, chosing, and editing of the books in the bible to you know?

: : : : If the bible is the word of God Lynn, which there is much evidence against, how can you possibly love a God that inspired such words? You will not find anywhere else in ancient writings women treated with more contempt and disdain than in those inspired fables. God tells Moses that a woman who gives birth will be unclean for seven days if it is a male child, two weeks if it is a female child and either/or she must at the end of her confinement make a sin offering - it also tells in great detail that all that she touches or all that touches her during this time will be unclean. Women of the bible are synonymous with slaves and domestic animals. Paul - the founder of Christianity has a philosphy that basically states - any male fool is even superior than the most intelligent of women. He also says &quot;Let a woman learn in quietness with all subjection. But I permit not a woman to teach, nor to have dominion over a man, but to be in quietness...Let the woman keep silence in the churches; for it is not permitted unto them to speak. But let them be in subjection as also saith the law. And if they would learn anything, let them ask their own husband at home; for it is shameful for a woman to speak in the church.&quot; There's another line in there somewhere that was supposedly inspired by God that goes &quot;Fierce is the dragon and cunning the asp; but woman has the malice of both.&quot; As I'm sure you know, one of the big steps that helped Christianity become the super power it has is when it was embraced by the Roman Emperor Constantine - before then Roman law was quite favorable to women but with Christianity this was all modified extremely. The most obstacles that were put in the way of woman's legal emancipation was from the church. The condemnation of women as a sex, the attributing to her of everthing that is vile, hateful and malicious, was responsible for the witch burnings that I'm sure you're familiar with. The Christian Church was responsible for 9 MILLION women being burned for sorcery and my educated guess is that not one of those women were witches. It was believed then that women were in league with the devil, they were the cause of plagues, epidemics, misfortunes, calamities, disasters. Solomon says &quot;What is woman but an enemy of friendship, an aviodable punishment, a necessary evil, a natural temptation, a desirable affliction, a constantly flowing source of tears, a wicked work of nature covered with a shining varnish?&quot; As you can see I hope, the bible is the cause of the oppression of women and the attitudes that still prevail today. Ask yourself what Christianity has done for women and if you still claim to be one - please, tell me your reasons.

: : : 
: : : Quite frankly, I think God was doing women a favor.  Do you think they were treated as equals before the law was handed down?  Get real.  These people were barbarians.  The last thing a woman wants when she's on her period or just given birth, is some smelly nomad foisting himself upon her. 
: : : The quote sited by Solomon surely reflects the thoughts of any man who's been burned.  This also is not a description of a godly woman.
: : : Perhaps you should also ready the Songs of Solomon or some of the many other passages that speak of women in the most affectionate terms.
: : : Now...I will not disagree with anyone that the CAtholic church has done many horrible things.  They claim to be the first church, but I merely see them as the first government sanctioned church.  They  mixed Christianity with the pagan religions of Rome.  Christmas is a good example.  Besides, in those times, I'm sure it wasn't only christians who were ignorant and misguided.  Also, people were illiterate, and even if they could read, would not have had access to a bible in those times.  The teachings of a corrupt church were all they had.  You'll have to admit, that things are different now.

: : There are many examples from the pre-christian era where women were treated as equals to men and in some instances they were even thought on higher terms. Many, many, many. Sure there were  a few nasties here and there but if your claiming that the world was a bunch of barbarians before the Christian era then dang it girl, you need to read some history books. Though the Greeks aren't known for their high opinion of women they certainly weren't barbarians - they are responsible for the beginnings of science which was then stiffled for many centuries thanks to the Godly Christians but luckily the Arabs saved the day and with the enlightenment and the reduction in church power - we saw thinking again in the Western World. I wonder how more advanced we'd be now if Christianity hadn't suppressed it in the first place.  
: : Back to women - in Sparta women were brought up as equals to men - Plato in his writing, makes no distinction between the sexes - in Egypt, women were thought of highly - pre-Christian Rome - the uncivilized Teutonic tribes even treated their women with esteem and confidence. Christianity undoubtedly made life much worse for women - this to me is something I am not skeptic about whatsoever. If you've read your old testament, you'll see that polygamy was quite a popular thing - the Ten Commandments were written for men - over and over again women are the lowest of the low and of course they are the ones responisble for the Fall and must pay, pay, pay. Do you truly believe that the pain of labor is something that God created? Medical science has long ago solved that mystery. And if you do follow the bible then you contradict yourself because it was God who made menstruation and painful labors in the first place - before then it was all a joyous experience so a smelly nomad wouldn't cause all that much grief.
: : Though the Songs of Solomon are well-written and almost as nice as a poem by Marlowe or Frost or Keats - I wouldn't be all that flattered if I were the woman being written about - comparing one to a horse or the other objects is not at all a compliment in my books - and more often than not in the songs - he is referring to God his beloved not a woman. It seems to me that it just might be an example of christian erotica - a man well versed and inlove and probably a little horny - the love he professes for God might be a result of halucenogenics or maybe a hidden desire for homosexuality. Those claims are about as believable as yours. As for paganism - though I don't agree with it either, it was certainly less harmful than christianity.

Sure, the stories in the NT aren't as cruel as those in the OT and love is much more common but still I see no evidence for the existence of God in either. The miracles Jesus performed have no proof to back them up - turning water into wine, raising the dead and healing the sick with a thought or a touch are alien concepts to science. History does seem to allow for the possibility of Jesus' existence but not as anything greater than a man - some of his teachings were quite admirable but like all philosphies - capitalism, socialism, communism, fascism etc.. they have not worked and though they may posess some useful ideas they have also been the cause of much horror. The belief that Jesus died on the cross for our sins and the belief that the Jews and Romans are evil because they killed Jesus totally contradict one another - anti-semitism was a common feeling among Christians after the crucifixion and led to much carnage but if the followers of Jesus really believed that it was God's will that caused his "earthly" death - then Christians should be thankful for the actions of the Jews and Romans. When I read the bibles - I read them not to prove my beliefs but to question them - I have not been an atheist all of my life and many times I have tried to believe in the Christian doctrines. My education and upbringing was in no way an atheist one and most likely any indoctrinating would have been in the other direction. It was due to independent thought that I broke away from the bondage of religion and I am very proud to call myself a freethinker. I suppose I could be compared with a fundamentalist in that my convictions are very strong but never to I profess that they are permanent - I continually question my beliefs and often I change them when they no longer agree with the evidence that we have. I have looked at the other side many times and as you advised in another post - I have also looked for God's existence with the proper attitude - I don't do any of this to prove my beliefs but so far, as this issue is involved, most of my research has had the side effect that has made my beliefs stronger as a result. I am not really angry about religion, I am more frustrated and surprised that such a concept could exist today with all that we know. I won't deny that at times I get angry about the harms I feel religion causes but I try to turn that anger into something constructive and by no means would I consider using that anger in a nasty way. We have discussed two issues in this thread - one - the likeliness or unlikeliness of God's existence - most of the information I've given on that is from science and I try to keep my personal bias out of the picture. I attempt to deal with the question in an intelligent and objective manner and am more than willing to entertain opposing evidence. The other issue is my hypothesis that religion has caused more harm than good and this is based on history, reality and my own personal observations and opinions so my prejudice is more apt to appear. I have looked at the other side of both issues however and continue to stand firm behind my beliefs. I do have an open mind Lynn and I have no qualms of giving up my beliefs or admitting that I'm wrong when the evidence is against such beliefs. I've been wrong many times - it's not something that might embarass me or make me feel less complete - in fact, I'm very much incomplete. Regardless of our differences - I wish for you a very happy and fulfilling life whether you are a christian or not - please remember that I am not attacking you personally but I am questioning your beliefs in a similar way that I question my own.

I do have an open mind Lynn and I have no qualms of giving up my beliefs or admitting that I'm wrong when the evidence is against such beliefs. I've been wrong many times - it's not something that might embarass me or make me feel less complete - in fact, I'm very much incomplete. Regardless of our differences - I wish for you a very happy and fulfilling life whether you are a christian or not - please remember that I am not attacking you personally but I am questioning your beliefs in a similar way that I question my own.

Keep in mind that a lot of us do not view the bible as the word of god, but as merely the word of a few men _alledgedly_ speaking for god. <p><br>I believe that the Bible IS the word of God.

: : Obviously I disagree with you.  I could take every argument you make and turn it around to prove my own point, but I doubt if I could convince you.  There is only one way to know for sure if God is real.  <br>: First you would have to accept the possibility that there is a God.  Then you would have to open you mind and heart and sincerely humble yourself before Him and just say "God, if you are there would you please reveal yourself to me?"  You'd have to have the right attitude and little persistence, but I guarantee if you "keep knocking the door will be opened".  I suspect that most people at this site would find that to be a very hard thing to do, since, even if there is a God, he has already been judged to be cruel, uncaring, judgemental,...pick your own adjective.  <p>: There is no truly objective way to prove or disprove the existence of a god while one is alive, you can accept and believe all you want, but that isn't proof. The only way that it could be proven either way is to die. <p>: The evidence for this "judgement" is his/hers/its believers' own writings.<p><br>It cannot be proven to the world, but it can be proven in the heart of the individual.  Once you die, it's too late Stephen.

In addition, he may require more than simple belief; almost all Christians believe that the Christian God requires an element of trust and obedience from his followers, and that destroys the assertion that if you believe but are wrong, you lose nothing.<p>Finally, if this God is a fair and just God, he will judge people on their actions in life, not on whether they happen to believe in him.

: : It cannot be proven to the world, but it can be proven in the heart of the individual.  Once you die, it's too late Stephen. 

: It is impossible to prove the improvable, and to believe that one can is an act of supreme arrogance.  You are using what is called Pascal's Wager.  As the following text will explain it better.
: ______________________________________________________

: Pascal's Wager (God is a safe bet)

: &quot;If you believe in God and turn out to be incorrect, you have lost nothing -- but if you don't believe in God and turn out to be incorrect, you will go to hell. Therefore it is foolish to be an atheist.&quot;

: This argument is known as Pascal's Wager. It has several flaws.

: Firstly, it does not indicate which religion to follow. Indeed, there are many mutually exclusive and contradictory religions out there. This is often described as the &quot;avoiding the wrong hell&quot; problem. If a person is a follower of one religion, he may end up in another religion's version of hell.

: Even if we assume that there's a God, that doesn't imply that there's one unique God. Which should we believe in? If we believe in all of them, how will we decide which commandments to follow?

: Secondly, the statement that &quot;If you believe in God and turn out to be incorrect, you have lost nothing&quot; is not true. Suppose you're believing in the wrong God -- the true God might punish you for your foolishness. Consider also the deaths that have resulted from people rejecting medicine in favour of prayer.

If, in fact, the possibility of there being a God is close to zero, the argument becomes much less persuasive. So sadly the argument is only likely to convince those who believe already.

: Also, many feel that for intellectually honest people, belief is based on evidence, with some amount of intuition. It is not a matter of will or cost-benefit analysis.

: Formally speaking, the argument consists of four statements:

: 1.One does not know whether God exists. 2.Not believing in God is bad for one's eternal soul if God does exist. 3.Believing in God is of no consequence if God does not exist. 4.Therefore it is in one's interest to believe in God.

He will spurn the latter... assuming he actually cares at all whether people believe in him. In addition, he may require more than simple belief; almost all Christians believe that the Christian God requires an element of trust and obedience from his followers, and that destroys the assertion that if you believe but are wrong, you lose nothing.

: Finally, if this God is a fair and just God, he will judge people on their actions in life, not on whether they happen to believe in him. A God who sends good and kind people to hell is not one most atheists would be prepared to consider worshipping.
