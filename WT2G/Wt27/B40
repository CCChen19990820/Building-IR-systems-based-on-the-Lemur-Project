<br>: I would desperately like to network with other homeschool moms that also have a business they run out of their home.  I could use some incouragement.  This is our 4th year homeschooling.  My husband and I have been wanting for some time to have a computer related business that we can run out of the home.  My husband is a firefighter, he works 24 hours on 24 hours off.  He also is a farrier (horseshoer) and up till this last August was leaving the fire station at 8 am and going directly out to shoe horses.  Needless to say we rarely saw much of him.  We decided it was now or never to start a home business the whole family could contribute to.  We got a home equity loan and got all the necessary things we needed to start our business.  I homeschool from 8-12, direct teaching to my 8yr old and 5yr old, our 14 year old works independently pretty well.  I work at the bus. from 1-5 four days a week and one day a week when my husband is off, I go out for the whole day and market our business.  My husband's pretty much got out of the horseshoing business and is working our new bus. on his days off.  He helps with the homeschooling and laundry, etc.  It is hard to get out of the business mode and in to the homeschooling mode sometimes.  I just have to focas all my attention on my teaching when I'm homeschooling  and re-focas back on the bus. when I'm done.  I would love to talk with other moms doing the same thing.  I sometimes feel quilty when I cannot devote more time to all the extra activities we used to do with homeschooling.  My goal is to get all the kids involved one way or the other eventually.  Look forward to hearing from you.  Kelly<br>I don't work at home, but I do go full-time to college and work part-time---there are many of us who work full-time jobs and also hs.  I understand the problem of getting into the hsing mode also.  I have to consciously pull my mind back to what I'm supposed to be doing!  With your business being as new as it is, I'm sure that is part of the problem.  As you get more used to the situation, things should ease up.  Could your 14-yr-old help out with the younger ones also---my 12 yr-old would love to do that---of course, she doesn't know the "reality" of having younger brothers and sisters, so she is not basing that desire on reality!!!<br>

Posted by <a href="mailto:daneenb@glasscity.net">Daneen</a> on December 04, 1996 at 09:12:33:<p>
I am looking for a GOOD, extensive, homeschool/home organization program for Windows 95.  I wish to be able to get rid of much of the paperwork involved by putting it on computer.  I would like to be able to assign work, have my son note what is finished, assign grades, print reports, and organize my housework and the children's chores.  Can anyone help me?  Also, I belong to a homeschool co-op that meets twice monthly.   Two of my children (ages 7 and 5) have been learning German (colors,numbers,body parts,ABC's).  They are very interested.  Does anyone know of a good German course for young children?  Thanks to all in advance for your help.

: : I am looking for a GOOD, extensive, homeschool/home organization program for Windows 95.  I wish to be able to get rid of much of the paperwork involved by putting it on computer.  I would like to be able to assign work, have my son note what is finished, assign grades, print reports, and organize my housework and the children's chores.  Can anyone help me?

SHE TOOK HER GIRL OUT OF PUBLIC SCHOOL FIRST BECAUSE SHE WAS IN SPECIAL CLASSES FOR READING AND WAS AT A 2ND GRADE LEVEL. HER SON WENT TO HIS FIRST WEEK AT MIDDLE SCHOOL AND THREATENED TO SKIP SCHOOL IF SHE DID NOT HOMESCHOOL HIM ALSO.  SHE IS CURRENTLY USING THE ACE PROGRAM, AND THE SCHOOL IN OUR STATE THAT ACCEPTS THIS PROGRAM IS KEEPING ALL TEST SCORES AND GRADES FOR HER.     HER PROBLEM IS HER EX-HUSBAND.  HE IS AGAINST HOMESCHOOLING OR PRIVATE CHRISTIAN SCHOOL.  SHE TRIED TO TALK WITH HIM ABOUT HOMESCHOOOLING THE CHILDREN BEFORE SHE DID IT, AND SHE EVEN GAVE HIM THE INFORMATION ABOUT THE SCHOOL.  NOW HE IS TAKING HER BACK TO COURT FOR CUSTODY OF CHILDREN JUST SO HE CAN PUT THEM IN PUBLIC SCHOOL.   HAS ANY ONE OUT THERE HAD A SIMILAR EXPERIENCE OR KNOW OF ANYONE WHO HAS?  SHE HAS HAD THE CHILDREN SEEN BY A PSYCHOLOGIST IN THE PAST SINCE HER DIVORCE AND THE EX-HUSBAND IS SAYING THAT THE PSYCHOLOGIST SAID IT WOULD HARM THE CHILDREN TO HOMESCHOOL THEM.. SHE CHECKED WITH THE PSYCHOLOGIST AND HE ONLY SAYS THAT THE GIRL NEEDS TO GO BACK TO PUBLIC  BECAUSE SHE NEEDS ADULT INTERACTION OR SHE WILL REGRESS.    PLEASE IF ANYONE HAS ANY IDEAS PLEASE E-MAIL  IMMEDIATELY.  HER ATTORNEY HAS ADVISED HER TO PUT CHILDREN BACK IN PUBLIC SCHOOL OR FIND A PSYCHOLOGIST WHO WILL SAY OK TO HOMESCHOOL. OTHERWISE SHE WILL LOOSE CUSTODY!!!!  HELP!!!!!!!!!!!!

OTHERWISE SHE WILL LOOSE CUSTODY!!!!  HELP!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>Carol-I didn't notice if you indicated what state you are in but I would make sure I was armed with a good report from a Christian psychologist who believes in homeschooling.  Check around with other Christians, your pastor, etc.  Will your pastor back you up and appear in your behalf?  Do you get "The Shepherd's Guide" in your area?  It would probably be available at your local Christian book store.  It may  list a Christian counselor.  If not, arm yourself with phone book and phone and start calling.  Call every psychologist in the book if necessary and ask the secretary outright if it is a Christian office.  Ask if they believe in homeschooling.  It doesn't hurt to hear the word "no".  The worst you can hear is "none of your business".  If they won't tell you about their religious convictions they are not Christian.  This woman has to be prepared when she goes to court.  Also, if the law in the state is "homeschooler friendly"  she has the law on her side.  She isn't doing anything illegal.  Also, as difficult as it may be to homeschool and get everything else done, I would make sure my house shines at all times right  now.  The court may order  a home visit if her negligence is being claimed.  Above all else,  she should have holes in the knees of her stockings by the time she goes to court.  The best thing is prayer and lots of it.  If God wants her homeschooling these children He alone is able to make sure it happens.  One last comment.  Does God want to her to restore her marriage?    Even if that is not  possible, she really should be showing their father  how well  they are doing.  A good relationship between the parents is important to the children.  I don't know  her name but will put the situation in my prayers.  In Christ,  Daneen<br>

: : I HAVE A GOOD FRIEND WHO IS IN HER FIRST YEAR OF HOMESCHOOLING.  HER CHILDREN ARE AGED BOY 11YRS 6TH GRADE AND GIRL 9YRS 4TH GRADE.  SHE TOOK HER GIRL OUT OF PUBLIC SCHOOL FIRST BECAUSE SHE WAS IN SPECIAL CLASSES FOR READING AND WAS AT A 2ND GRADE LEVEL. HER SON WENT TO HIS FIRST WEEK AT MIDDLE SCHOOL AND THREATENED TO SKIP SCHOOL IF SHE DID NOT HOMESCHOOL HIM ALSO.  SHE IS CURRENTLY USING THE ACE PROGRAM, AND THE SCHOOL IN OUR STATE THAT ACCEPTS THIS PROGRAM IS KEEPING ALL TEST SCORES AND GRADES FOR HER.     HER PROBLEM IS HER EX-HUSBAND.  HE IS AGAINST HOMESCHOOLING OR PRIVATE CHRISTIAN SCHOOL.  SHE TRIED TO TALK WITH HIM ABOUT HOMESCHOOOLING THE CHILDREN BEFORE SHE DID IT, AND SHE EVEN GAVE HIM THE INFORMATION ABOUT THE SCHOOL.  NOW HE IS TAKING HER BACK TO COURT FOR CUSTODY OF CHILDREN JUST SO HE CAN PUT THEM IN PUBLIC SCHOOL.   HAS ANY ONE OUT THERE HAD A SIMILAR EXPERIENCE OR KNOW OF ANYONE WHO HAS?  SHE HAS HAD THE CHILDREN SEEN BY A PSYCHOLOGIST IN THE PAST SINCE HER DIVORCE AND THE EX-HUSBAND IS SAYING THAT THE PSYCHOLOGIST SAID IT WOULD HARM THE CHILDREN TO HOMESCHOOL THEM.. SHE CHECKED WITH THE PSYCHOLOGIST AND HE ONLY SAYS THAT THE GIRL NEEDS TO GO BACK TO PUBLIC  BECAUSE SHE NEEDS ADULT INTERACTION OR SHE WILL REGRESS.    PLEASE IF ANYONE HAS ANY IDEAS PLEASE E-MAIL  IMMEDIATELY.  HER ATTORNEY HAS ADVISED HER TO PUT CHILDREN BACK IN PUBLIC SCHOOL OR FIND A PSYCHOLOGIST WHO WILL SAY OK TO HOMESCHOOL. OTHERWISE SHE WILL LOOSE CUSTODY!!!!  HELP!!!!!!!!!!!!
: Carol-I didn't notice if you indicated what state you are in but I would make sure I was armed with a good report from a Christian psychologist who believes in homeschooling.  Check around with other Christians, your pastor, etc.  Will your pastor back you up and appear in your behalf?  Do you get &quot;The Shepherd's Guide&quot; in your area?  It would probably be available at your local Christian book store.  It may  list a Christian counselor.  If not, arm yourself with phone book and phone and start calling.  Call every psychologist in the book if necessary and ask the secretary outright if it is a Christian office.  Ask if they believe in homeschooling.  It doesn't hurt to hear the word &quot;no&quot;.  The worst you can hear is &quot;none of your business&quot;.  If they won't tell you about their religious convictions they are not Christian.  This woman has to be prepared when she goes to court.  Also, if the law in the state is &quot;homeschooler friendly&quot;  she has the law on her side.  She isn't doing anything illegal.  Also, as difficult as it may be to homeschool and get everything else done, I would make sure my house shines at all times right  now.  The court may order  a home visit if her negligence is being claimed.  Above all else,  she should have holes in the knees of her stockings by the time she goes to court.  The best thing is prayer and lots of it.  If God wants her homeschooling these children He alone is able to make sure it happens.  One last comment.  Does God want to her to restore her marriage?    Even if that is not  possible, she really should be showing their father  how well  they are doing.  A good relationship between the parents is important to the children.  I don't know  her name but will put the situation in my prayers.  In Christ,  Daneen

My advice would be for her to pay the $100 to join HSLDA (Home School Legal Defense Association).  They have actually had several cases just like this and won.  They will provide her with attorneys free of charge who have dealt with cases like this unlike her current attorney who is obviously not acquainted with the benefits of homeschooling and whom she will have to pay to represent her.<p>Some local support groups qualify for a group discount where the fee is $85.  She might check with her support group.<p>Tell her we will be thinking of her and good luck!<p>Linda

My work seems too hard. My mom never pushes me, but I'm sinking to a 4th grade level in Math. I should be in a 6th or 7th grade level. I don't understand anything I work on, except writing. Mom trys to help me with stuff, but I just can't understand math. It is like another language!<br>-Emily (age 12)

Hi Emily!  I am a math teacher for homeschooled high schoolers.  I failed math every year through the 6th grade!  Then it suddenly made sense.  My advice to you would be to chill out about it.  Find a curriculum that is a better 'fit', if possible (lots of my students hated Saxon, too), but otherwise, just concentrate on the basic concepts (every day, to help you remember better).  Do you understand place value?  How about what the 4 basic operations mean?  If you stick with that for now, you'll do well.  You can easily do the math for 4th-8th in a year when you're ready.  Anxiety can shut down that part of your brain that does math (REALLY!), so also work on not being intimidated.  Just remember -- higher maths take a different type of thinking from general math.  I still count on my fingers (very well, thank-you-very-much!), but Algebra was easy for me.  I hope this is encouraging! I KNOW how frustrating it can be to work hard and still not understand math.<br>

We used Saxon math at first too.  And I hated it also.  It was way too boring and way too many problems.  It went too slowly and I hated having to rewrite the problems.  <p>Then we changed to A Beka and I really like it a lot.  They explain things pretty well, you only have to do one page front and back each day with not too many problems, and the pages are colorful with puzzles and fun word problems.  And you write in the book so you don't have to rewrite the problems.  And the problems gradually build on what you've learned before so that you aren't suddenly hit with something you don't know how to do.<p>You might want to start with the 3rd grade book (because that grade will teach you the basics ) and work your way up by doing more than one page a day.  But if you work on it each day, you will understand it and it won't seem so hard any more.<p>Darryl

: Despite a grade skip last year, my gifted 7 yr old is very bored in school. She's started goofing off in class and is slow to turn in her work-in the past few weeks she's made improvements in behavior (I explained that I couldn't persuade her teacher to change her assignments until she demonstrated that she was capable of doing the assigned work). I'm now coming in once a week to work with a Junior Great Books Group for her class (otherwise she gets no relief from the third grade reader even though her teacher is aware that she recently completed reading the Dairy of Anne Frank at home). Of coarse, it doesn't help that the new principal is openly hostile to making any accomidation for gifted children. And has twice tried to undo the grade skip-three weeks after school started she tried to persuade me to put my daughter in 2nd grade with 3rd grade reading instruction. Since she was performing at the level of an average 3rd grader I refused. Last month, she asked me to consider retaining my daughter in 3rd grade next fall, so that we could correct the error made earlier in the fall. I politely told her that I wouldn't consider that option. <p>: I've spent time in her classroom recently her teacher means well but he just doesn't realized that she's extremely bored. He can't understand (and stated that on her report card this week) why she is doing "fantastic projects at home," and only average to above average work in class. He's at least open-minded, caring, and willing to listen. However, that's not true of the 4th and 5th grade teachers. I'm also concerned about what the principal will say to prejudice next years teachers. Private schools in our area have huge waiting lists (some won't even accept additonal names) so private school does not appear to be an option for next year. So I'm thinking of home schooling.<p>: Things I'm worried about-I'm a single parent and work full-time. Does anyone have experience home schooling as a single parent? My other question-does anyone have experience with Cloronda (sp)? I live in Ann Arbor where they are based, so it might be possible for her to attend their campus program. <br>: Any advice will be appreciated.<p>Yes, we use Clonlara's home based education program.  Although I haven't visited their campus school, I've been to home school conferences and met several of the teachers and Pat Montgomery (the founder and director) and I can only say good things about their program.  You would not have to worry about your child being bored there.  They are so supportive of our child-led interest oriented way of homeschooling.  Definitely give Pat a call, and find out whether you can afford their school.  If not, I don't work full time, but do work part-time and h.s.  As Karl suggested, you may be able to make accomodations with your schedule.  Do you have any babysitting support?   Best of luck; it's really hard trying to find the best solution with so many variables but it sounds like you're on the right track.

<br>Dear Everybody:<p>Thank you so much for all of the advice.  We are going to make a decision over the holidays.  The semester ends January 16th and we will know what we are going to do by then.  After talking to Eddie some more this weekend, he said that it was hard going off to school when his dad, brother, sister and I are staying at home. I had a private post from a friend in Orlando that urged me to never let cost make my decision for  me.  What terrific advice.  I really do  want to do what is best for my children. Thanks for all of the suggestions.<p>Stef

: Dear Everybody:

: Thank you so much for all of the advice.  We are going to make a decision over the holidays.  The semester ends January 16th and we will know what we are going to do by then.  After talking to Eddie some more this weekend, he said that it was hard going off to school when his dad, brother, sister and I are staying at home. I had a private post from a friend in Orlando that urged me to never let cost make my decision for  me.  What terrific advice.  I really do  want to do what is best for my children. Thanks for all of the suggestions.

: Stef

: I agree.  I would take him out of school and I would relax as much as possible.  I've been homeschooling for going on 10 years.  At second grade level, I wish I could go back and do it different.  There's enough time for book learning!  Anyway, you could probably arrange with his school to bring home the books he's using now!  No cost!  But, from there I would springboard.

He loves science (father is a scientist) and is continually telling me things that I don't know.  we use Sonlight Curriculum only a grade ahead (third).  For math we have used Miquon because 1- it's cheaper ($5 a book, 2-3 books a year), and 2-it does make him think in a "higher" math way.<br>Don't worry about the cost.  There are probably enough books in the library to keep him busy for a year or so anyway!!  The academics aren't as important as the family harmony, his own feeling of being included, and the great spiritual/life training that can go on.  Don't worry about all the "cool" experiments he may be doing at school.  My son often says, "Why did we do all that?  I just read it in the book!"  So I guess the <br>concensus has been , GO FOR IT!  We'll be praying!

I'm really concerned. Is this truly how our children feel? Mine are still young(10,3,&1) and they want to please me,so they would probably never say these things to me. But I would be heart-broken to think that what I meant for their pleasure and their benefit only caused them pain and regret.Anybody out there with older kids who did (or did not) enjoy homeschool? or is that too much a sacred cow...:(<br>

One minute they have them for you to rent and the next they don't.  I would be interested to know what you have been told.  I wish I could locate these videos as they sound wonderful.

<body><h1>WWWBoard Frequently Asked Questions and Answers</h1>
Here is a brief explanation of some of the questions you may have 
about WWWBoard.<hr>
<ul>
<li><a href="#links">Can I use html tags anywhere in my posts?</a>
<li><a href="#colons">Why are there colons in the message section when I 
try post a followup?</a>
<li><a href="#reload">Why didn't my post show up?</a>
<li><a href="#getit">Where can I get the scripts for this program?</a>
</ul><hr><p>
<a name="links">Can I put html tags anywhere in my posts?</a><p>
No.  You can not use HTML tags in any field except body of the message.  
The maintainer of the script has the option of allowing or 
disallowing any HTML in the Message part of your posting.  If 
they disallow it, the script will just throw out everything in 
&lt;&gt;'s.  If they allow it, your html markup will appear in 
the posting.  It can't hurt to try.<p><hr><p> 

<a name="colons">Why are there colons in the message when I try to post a 
followup?</a><p>
Colons appear in the message dialog box when you try to followup up on a 
message to indicate that those lines are quoting the previous document. 
The owner of the WWWBoard can decide whether they wish to enable or 
disable the quoting of previous messages.<p><hr><p>


<a name="reload">Why didn't my post show up?</a><p>
Your post most likely did not show up, because your browser did not reload the 
page, it simply pulled it out of cache.  Please reload your browser and it 
should then appear.<p><hr><p>
<a name="getit">Where can I get the scripts for this program?</a><p>
The scripts are written in Perl and created by <a 
href="http://alpha.pr1.k12.co.us/~mattw/home.html">Matt Wright</a>.  They are 
free to anyone who wishes to use them and you can get them as well as other 
scripts at: <a href="http://worldwidemart.com/scripts/">http://worldwidemart.com/scripts/</a>.  
Enjoy!<p><hr>

The latest revision of the School Is Dead, Learn in Freedom site's Colleges That Admit Homeschoolers FAQ page has just been posted. Thanks to the many readers of this message board and of that page for the information they have provided to make that FAQ complete and accurate. Many college officers have written to me after seeing the link to the page on Yahoo's College Entrance Directory. At least one of those college officers is contemplating a research project based on the experiences of homeschoolers in college.<p>The Colleges That Admit Homeschoolers FAQ now features the new School Is Dead, Learn in Freedom! color scheme and has always included the most accurate, up-to-date, and comprehensive list available of colleges known to have admitted homeschoolers. More than 100 colleges are fully confirmed as having admitted one or more homeschoolers, on the basis of reliable information, and more than 300 colleges in total are listed as having welcomed, having admitted, or having been reported to have admitted homeschooled applicants. More than 80 of the confirmed colleges are "selective" colleges that not just everyone can get into. More than 250 of the colleges that appear on the Colleges That Admit Homeschoolers FAQ now appear with Web page links so you can surf right over to information about the colleges on the World Wide Web.<p>I hope you enjoy the Colleges That Admit Homeschoolers FAQ.

Posted by <a href="mailto:bunda002@gold.tc.umn.edu">Karl M. Bunday</a> on December 23, 1996 at 18:49:01:<p>
<center><img src="http://pages.prodigy.com/School_is_dead/kmbweb.gif"></center><p>
I've heard several times now about how useful homemade diplomas can be. Maybe you will need to make one to help your children go on to study or work outside the home.<p>Oddly, some states have now legal definition of what a diploma means, or have a definition that only applies to children enrolled in government-operated schools.<p>One mother who just wrote me said she looked up what her state requires, in statute, for issuance of a high school diploma, decided after careful consideration that her homeschool program amply met those requirements, and then made a home-made diploma for her children, which apparently helped them enroll at a state college. She specifically referred to "having met the requirements of [name of state] Statutes section . . . " on the face of the diploma. <p>Another family I know needed a diploma so their daughter could enlist in the Air Force. The Air Force recruiter is certainly no education expert, but simply needed a piece of paper so that the enlistment file was complete. So the family used their handy home computer and printer to print out a diploma, which is otherwise meaningless under the law of the state where they live. That state simply doesn't define the meaning of diplomas for learners not in the government-operated school system. Their daughter is now having a good time as a radar technician in the Air Force, working on the F-15 flight lines.<p>Maybe if you need a diploma, all you need to do is write one. Look up your state's laws (that can be done in most public libraries) and see what the possibilities are. You all have computers; now you can get some valuable use out of that printer.<p>

: I've heard several times now about how useful homemade diplomas can be. Maybe you will need to make one to help your children go on to study or work outside the home.

: Oddly, some states have now legal definition of what a diploma means, or have a definition that only applies to children enrolled in government-operated schools.

: One mother who just wrote me said she looked up what her state requires, in statute, for issuance of a high school diploma, decided after careful consideration that her homeschool program amply met those requirements, and then made a home-made diploma for her children, which apparently helped them enroll at a state college. She specifically referred to &quot;having met the requirements of [name of state] Statutes section . . . &quot; on the face of the diploma. 

: Another family I know needed a diploma so their daughter could enlist in the Air Force. The Air Force recruiter is certainly no education expert, but simply needed a piece of paper so that the enlistment file was complete. So the family used their handy home computer and printer to print out a diploma, which is otherwise meaningless under the law of the state where they live. That state simply doesn't define the meaning of diplomas for learners not in the government-operated school system. Their daughter is now having a good time as a radar technician in the Air Force, working on the F-15 flight lines.

: Maybe if you need a diploma, all you need to do is write one. Look up your state's laws (that can be done in most public libraries) and see what the possibilities are. You all have computers; now you can get some valuable use out of that printer.

: Sadly, the factory was purchased by another firm that 
: closed the factory and the school in August of this year.

: Since September 1st, our son has completed Calculus I at 
: the local community college.  He works a few hours a

Moreover, most college admissions officers work with "Carnegie unit" requirements. The Carnegie unit is attending one high school class for one semester.

Looks like the other day when I posted about nine messages the board was having technical difficulties--the replies are not visible today, even though I thought they were all posted that day. <br>I was advised by the manager of the Kaleidoscapes message boards that there was a problem the other day that prevented people from posting messages even though they could read messages. <br>I'll post this and see what happens, on December 10 about 11:40pm Central time.

Looks like the other day when I posted about nine messages the board was having technical difficulties--the replies are not visible today, even though I thought they were all posted that day. <br>I was advised by the manager of the Kaleidoscapes message boards that there was a problem the other day that prevented people from posting messages even though they could read messages. <br>I'll post this and see what happens, on December 10 about 11:40pm Central time.

Hi everyone,<p>I see alot about college for homeschooled kids, and I'm very glad!  But does anyone know about college for parents who have a career or don't have the time to go away to school?  I'm especially interested in going to school by e-mail or something.  If anyone knows of any good Christian online college opportunities, I'd really like to hear from you!<br>Write me either at the above address or at Robin@juno.com.<p>Thanks!<p>-Robin<br>

Posted by <a href="mailto:ariel1@startext.net">Cerelle Simmons</a> on November 10, 1996 at 07:30:05:<p>
Karl,<p>When Ariel (freed from school since 2nd grade) <br>interviewed the Sarah Lawrence representative last<br>month, she was told Sarah Lawrence welcomed homeschooled<br>applicants and had enjoyed more than satisfactory <br>results with homeschooled incoming freshmen. Her<br>unschooled status put not the slightest wrinkle in this<br>man's brow.<p>Ariel's SAT results came in the mail this week: 790<br>verbal, 610 math -- for a 1400 total.  Not shabby,<br>especially since the Sarah Lawrence rep. assured her<br>they evaluated the math and verbal scores separately.<p>At any rate, since I didn't see Sarah Lawrence's name<br>in your list of colleges that have admitted homeschoolers,<br>I thought you might want to check with them for a <br>confirmation.<p>Cerelle Simmons

: Karl,

: When Ariel (freed from school since 2nd grade) 
: interviewed the Sarah Lawrence representative last
: month, she was told Sarah Lawrence welcomed homeschooled
: applicants and had enjoyed more than satisfactory 
: results with homeschooled incoming freshmen. Her
: unschooled status put not the slightest wrinkle in this
: man's brow.

: Ariel's SAT results came in the mail this week: 790
: verbal, 610 math -- for a 1400 total.  Not shabby,
: especially since the Sarah Lawrence rep. assured her
: they evaluated the math and verbal scores separately.

: At any rate, since I didn't see Sarah Lawrence's name
: in your list of colleges that have admitted homeschoolers,
: I thought you might want to check with them for a 
: confirmation.

: Cerelle Simmons

<center><img src="http://198.83.19.39/School_is_dead/kmbweb.gif"></center><p>
Anne, you gave me a lot to think about with your last reply under the subject "What I've Found." There are two aspects of what you wrote that I've been mulling over, each of which I will turn to here.<p><p><br>The first issue is the definition of "giftedness." Lewis Terman, of course, was the psychometrician who popularized the term "gifted" for children with high IQ scores. He didn't think earlier terms quite fit the situation as he envisioned it. His cut-off score for participation in his longitudinal study of "gifted" persons was an elementary school score on his Stanford-Binet test of about 130, about two standard deviations above the population mean. (I'm sure you know this; this is written for onlookers.) That is, Terman's standard basically reserved participation in his study group to about 2 percent of the population. But, of course, if one takes IQ as a measure of "cognitive ability," or "general intelligence," the statistical distribution of scores is such that a person with an IQ of more than 160 (and I know such a person or two) would make up a smaller proportion of the Terman study group than the study group members themselves made up of the general population! That is why, for instance, I refer to Mensa (the organization that offers membership to persons with IQ scores in the top 2 percent of the general population) as "that overinclusive organization" [grin]. After all, my GRE scores, well in excess of the cut-offs for the 99th percentile on that test, which is only taken by people finishing a college degree, implies that I have a higher degree of whatever the GRE measures than most college graduates, who are themselves a population somewhat sorted out by whatever it is that IQ tests measure.<p><p><br>Thus on this first issue of the definition of "giftedness," as you rightly pointed out, there is the problem of overinclusive grouping. A child with an IQ of 160, by the statistical definition of IQ scores, would be as scarce among children in a "gifted" program (as defined by Terman's criterion, which is still used in many schools today) as those children themselves would be if Terman's criterion were rigorously applied to a school population, with no back doors into the program. A child who scores higher than 2,499 children out of 2,500 (which is roughly the definition of IQ 160) might be not appear for years at a time in whole schools, or even whole school districts. There are, by these statistical principles, about 100,000 people in the United States in this IQ score range, but no individual school will make a program suitable for such children, because such children make up such a small proportion of the population of any school. Schools operate by fitting the majority, mostly. Which is the problem you have already encountered. Because I knew before he was born that my son would have, presumably, a very favorable genetic and environmental background for high IQ (and for whatever reason, he does appear to be turning out to be profoundly gifted, more precocious than I was at the same age), I knew from the beginning I had little choice but to homeschool him. A privately operated classroom school would do little better than a government-operated school in concentrating children of his ability level to accompany him as he grew up, setting the pace for more challenging learning.<p><p><br>Anne, you mention you've been reading most all the literature available on gifted children. I presume you've read or are about to read Ellen Winner's Gifted Children: Myths and Realities (New York: Basic Books, 1996) (ISBN 0-465-01760-6). I just discovered that book since I saw your last reply to me on the College Tips Board. I'm impressed with how Dr. Winner marshals the latest research on childhood giftedness and provides references to the professional literature. She certainly agrees that school "gifted" programs are both overinclusive and largely ineffective for meeting the needs of any students in them, but especially for the most highly gifted students. She has some interesting comments on homeschooling and includes one brief case study of a homeschooling mom in her book. Dr. Winner makes the point, with which I agree heartily after my own research, that the IQ concept implying a unified, single "cognitive ability" profile for all people is descriptively inadequate. (My sources that help me reach this conclusion are posted on the Web at<p><p><br>http://198.83.19.39/School_is_dead/iqbooks.html<p><p><br>Now there is a large body of research confirming the "multiple intelligences" theory of Howard Gardner, which, however much it is spindled, folded, and mutilated by "professional educators," has been causing a major paradigm shift among psychometricians. I especially like the parts of Winner's book that show examples of children's drawings and other actual instances of the performance of children in creative tasks.<p><p><br>To me, one of the most striking parts of Joel Shurkin's book Terman's Kids (mentioned in my earlier reply under "What I've Found") is that quoted here: "Sometimes the testing simply missed bright children. Two youngsters who were tested but failed to make the cut grew up to become Nobel Prize winners: William Shockley, who co-invented the transistor, and physicist Luis Alvarez. None of those who made the study became Nobel laureates." -- Joel N. Shurkin, Terman's Kids: The Groundbreaking Study of How the Gifted Grow Up (1992). Quite a few of the Terman study participants turned out to be rather ordinary, if high-socioeconomic-status, adults. Shurkin's description of the life of the late Ancel Keys (probably the most eminent scientist known to have been in the Terman study) is interesting in what it shows about that "Terman kid." Keys was based for years at the U of MN, where I studied. His theory about cholesterol being linked to heart disease is enormously influential, of course, but never got him the Nobel Prize for medicine. All along, people could have wondered whether the influence of cholesterol on overall MORTALITY is as cut-and-dried as its clear statistical influence on heart disease. During most of Keys's life, the countries with the highest life expectancy at birth were precisely those with high average cholesterol intake.<p><p><br>The other thing that I thought was an extremely important observation in Shurkin's book was his observation of how much Terman interfered with his study subjects, pulling strings to make sure that they got into Stanford and so forth. Shurkin quotes from letters Terman wrote on behalf of study subjects and definitely presents a trail of evidence showing that the study was anything but "blind." I could have used a mentor like that when I was applying for colleges--I had the Stanford-Binet IQ score to warrant such intervention (to a greater degree than most of the Terman subjects), but I wasn't part of anybody's study group.<p><p><br>Which leads to the second issue, colleges as a social environment for gifted people. I think about this one every day, because every day I have to look for people with whom I can have a conversation without holding my vocabulary in check, and who can talk about policy issues above the level of bumper sticker slogans, and so on. Whatever it is that "giftedness" does, it certainly makes a person different from the average person. I think the SCHOOL experience of gifted children only magnifies this feeling, so I strongly urge parents of gifted children--by which I mean highly gifted children, as Ellen Winner describes them, to get their children out of school and homeschool them. (This is, by the way, only a "last choice" approach in Winner's opinion, but I don't think Winner's opinion takes sufficient account of the social life of homeschooled children. Winner is very good about listing studies of the gifted that show how much eminent adults hated school as children.) So, for childhood, the gifted child should first of all relate to parents and other adult relatives and neighbors, and with those children (who may be quite scarce) with whom the child has voluntary relationships of friendship.<p><p><br>But the issue I deal with daily, and which I think my son will have to deal with all the more, is having a wide enough adult circle of friends to include some of those one-in-every-2,500 people who can "know where I'm coming from." That's one reason I like online discussion--although only meeting people online is inherently dissatisfying, and I make much effort to meet in person people I've met online by attending conferences out of state and the like. I think my son will be the better off from not having attended school, as he can then develop, at HIS pace, interests that will provide him with points of commonality with other people rather than being stuck to a school-defined set of priorities. I remember playing with neighbor kids (both much older and much younger), Sunday School at church, scouting activities, and other youth activities based on voluntary participation as where I learned to have pleasant social dealings with other people, whether "gifted" or not. I remember school as where I was made to feel weird just for being myself. I am not at all surprised to hear that the prime suspect in the Unabomber case is a "gifted" man whose social life revolved around school and school clubs. The answer is not to have fewer gifted people, but to have gifted people spend less time in school.<p><p><br>But once my son grows up he <em>still</em> has to find a social circle, and I think one wider and more richly populated with "gifted" people than the one I have yet found. I know I have a problem when I notice how much I enjoy seeing physicians to monitor my ongoing medical treatment--at least when I talk to an M.D. I can assume he knows most words that I know. If I had known how much intellectual campanionship from co-workers would count to me as an element of job satisfaction, I would have pursued a different occupation. (Law doesn't cut it--most lawyers are only slightly above average people in intelligence, however much they are above average in income.) And you, Anne, have already referred under the "What I've Found" subject to the same way my dad got stuck in bringing me up--some places that concentrate people with brainpower do even better at concentrating people with money. For the parents who have a lot of compassion for their children's needs to grow and develop their potential, but not a lot of money, "gifted" children can be rather a white elephant gift at times. Ellen Winner discusses the cultural attitudes in the United States that aim scholarships in all kinds of directions other than at the most capable children. And Thomas Sowell (recommended by another participant in the College Tips Board too) discusses in several of his books how colleges price their services far out of relation with the economic value of college.<p><p><br>The simple fact is that most people who graduate from college differ more in INCOME from non-college-graduates than they do in intelligence, and most of the future income advantage of college attendance, as has been shown by economists of education, derives from the college-educated population's initial higher socioeconomic status, not from "education" received in college. Sowell points out that college "scholarships" are mostly really discounts on the list price of college attendance, which is set by the colleges themselves--often in collusion with other colleges, in a manner that would be an antitrust violation in private industry. Today, being a really smart applicant is not the most compelling factor, much of the time, for obtaining that discount. But I know people who paid out of pocket to go to college, and then graduate school, mostly to take on college teaching positions that don't pay particularly well, just to have the intellectual companionship of their other faculty members (while they endure the doofus undergraduate students). Maybe I would have done the same back in my twenties knowing what I know today about my preferences in job conditions.

: Anne, you gave me a lot to think about with your last reply under the subject &quot;What I've Found.&quot; There are two aspects of what you wrote that I've been mulling over, each of which I will turn to here.


: 
: The first issue is the definition of &quot;giftedness.&quot; Lewis Terman, of course, was the psychometrician who popularized the term &quot;gifted&quot; for children with high IQ scores. He didn't think earlier terms quite fit the situation as he envisioned it. His cut-off score for participation in his longitudinal study of &quot;gifted&quot; persons was an elementary school score on his Stanford-Binet test of about 130, about two standard deviations above the population mean. (I'm sure you know this; this is written for onlookers.) That is, Terman's standard basically reserved participation in his study group to about 2 percent of the population. But, of course, if one takes IQ as a measure of &quot;cognitive ability,&quot; or &quot;general intelligence,&quot; the statistical distribution of scores is such that a person with an IQ of more than 160 (and I know such a person or two) would make up a smaller proportion of the Terman study group than the study group members themselves made up of the general population! That is why, for instance, I refer to Mensa (the organization that offers membership to persons with IQ scores in the top 2 percent of the general population) as &quot;that overinclusive organization&quot; [grin]. After all, my GRE scores, well in excess of the cut-offs for the 99th percentile on that test, which is only taken by people finishing a college degree, implies that I have a higher degree of whatever the GRE measures than most college graduates, who are themselves a population somewhat sorted out by whatever it is that IQ tests measure.


: 
: Thus on this first issue of the definition of &quot;giftedness,&quot; as you rightly pointed out, there is the problem of overinclusive grouping. A child with an IQ of 160, by the statistical definition of IQ scores, would be as scarce among children in a &quot;gifted&quot; program (as defined by Terman's criterion, which is still used in many schools today) as those children themselves would be if Terman's criterion were rigorously applied to a school population, with no back doors into the program. A child who scores higher than 2,499 children out of 2,500 (which is roughly the definition of IQ 160) might be not appear for years at a time in whole schools, or even whole school districts. There are, by these statistical principles, about 100,000 people in the United States in this IQ score range, but no individual school will make a program suitable for such children, because such children make up such a small proportion of the population of any school. Schools operate by fitting the majority, mostly. Which is the problem you have already encountered. Because I knew before he was born that my son would have, presumably, a very favorable genetic and environmental background for high IQ (and for whatever reason, he does appear to be turning out to be profoundly gifted, more precocious than I was at the same age), I knew from the beginning I had little choice but to homeschool him. A privately operated classroom school would do little better than a government-operated school in concentrating children of his ability level to accompany him as he grew up, setting the pace for more challenging learning.


: 
: Anne, you mention you've been reading most all the literature available on gifted children. I presume you've read or are about to read Ellen Winner's Gifted Children: Myths and Realities (New York: Basic Books, 1996) (ISBN 0-465-01760-6). I just discovered that book since I saw your last reply to me on the College Tips Board. I'm impressed with how Dr. Winner marshals the latest research on childhood giftedness and provides references to the professional literature. She certainly agrees that school &quot;gifted&quot; programs are both overinclusive and largely ineffective for meeting the needs of any students in them, but especially for the most highly gifted students. She has some interesting comments on homeschooling and includes one brief case study of a homeschooling mom in her book. Dr. Winner makes the point, with which I agree heartily after my own research, that the IQ concept implying a unified, single &quot;cognitive ability&quot; profile for all people is descriptively inadequate. (My sources that help me reach this conclusion are posted on the Web at


: 
: http://198.83.19.39/School_is_dead/iqbooks.html


: 
: Now there is a large body of research confirming the &quot;multiple intelligences&quot; theory of Howard Gardner, which, however much it is spindled, folded, and mutilated by &quot;professional educators,&quot; has been causing a major paradigm shift among psychometricians. I especially like the parts of Winner's book that show examples of children's drawings and other actual instances of the performance of children in creative tasks.


: 
: To me, one of the most striking parts of Joel Shurkin's book Terman's Kids (mentioned in my earlier reply under &quot;What I've Found&quot;) is that quoted here: &quot;Sometimes the testing simply missed bright children. Two youngsters who were tested but failed to make the cut grew up to become Nobel Prize winners: William Shockley, who co-invented the transistor, and physicist Luis Alvarez. None of those who made the study became Nobel laureates.&quot; -- Joel N. Shurkin, Terman's Kids: The Groundbreaking Study of How the Gifted Grow Up (1992). Quite a few of the Terman study participants turned out to be rather ordinary, if high-socioeconomic-status, adults. Shurkin's description of the life of the late Ancel Keys (probably the most eminent scientist known to have been in the Terman study) is interesting in what it shows about that &quot;Terman kid.&quot; Keys was based for years at the U of MN, where I studied. His theory about cholesterol being linked to heart disease is enormously influential, of course, but never got him the Nobel Prize for medicine. All along, people could have wondered whether the influence of cholesterol on overall MORTALITY is as cut-and-dried as its clear statistical influence on heart disease. During most of Keys's life, the countries with the highest life expectancy at birth were precisely those with high average cholesterol intake.


: 
: The other thing that I thought was an extremely important observation in Shurkin's book was his observation of how much Terman interfered with his study subjects, pulling strings to make sure that they got into Stanford and so forth. Shurkin quotes from letters Terman wrote on behalf of study subjects and definitely presents a trail of evidence showing that the study was anything but &quot;blind.&quot; I could have used a mentor like that when I was applying for colleges--I had the Stanford-Binet IQ score to warrant such intervention (to a greater degree than most of the Terman subjects), but I wasn't part of anybody's study group.


: 
: Which leads to the second issue, colleges as a social environment for gifted people. I think about this one every day, because every day I have to look for people with whom I can have a conversation without holding my vocabulary in check, and who can talk about policy issues above the level of bumper sticker slogans, and so on. Whatever it is that &quot;giftedness&quot; does, it certainly makes a person different from the average person. I think the SCHOOL experience of gifted children only magnifies this feeling, so I strongly urge parents of gifted children--by which I mean highly gifted children, as Ellen Winner describes them, to get their children out of school and homeschool them. (This is, by the way, only a &quot;last choice&quot; approach in Winner's opinion, but I don't think Winner's opinion takes sufficient account of the social life of homeschooled children. Winner is very good about listing studies of the gifted that show how much eminent adults hated school as children.) So, for childhood, the gifted child should first of all relate to parents and other adult relatives and neighbors, and with those children (who may be quite scarce) with whom the child has voluntary relationships of friendship.


: 
: But the issue I deal with daily, and which I think my son will have to deal with all the more, is having a wide enough adult circle of friends to include some of those one-in-every-2,500 people who can &quot;know where I'm coming from.&quot; That's one reason I like online discussion--although only meeting people online is inherently dissatisfying, and I make much effort to meet in person people I've met online by attending conferences out of state and the like. I think my son will be the better off from not having attended school, as he can then develop, at HIS pace, interests that will provide him with points of commonality with other people rather than being stuck to a school-defined set of priorities. I remember playing with neighbor kids (both much older and much younger), Sunday School at church, scouting activities, and other youth activities based on voluntary participation as where I learned to have pleasant social dealings with other people, whether &quot;gifted&quot; or not. I remember school as where I was made to feel weird just for being myself. I am not at all surprised to hear that the prime suspect in the Unabomber case is a &quot;gifted&quot; man whose social life revolved around school and school clubs. The answer is not to have fewer gifted people, but to have gifted people spend less time in school.


: 
: But once my son grows up he &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; has to find a social circle, and I think one wider and more richly populated with &quot;gifted&quot; people than the one I have yet found. I know I have a problem when I notice how much I enjoy seeing physicians to monitor my ongoing medical treatment--at least when I talk to an M.D. I can assume he knows most words that I know. If I had known how much intellectual campanionship from co-workers would count to me as an element of job satisfaction, I would have pursued a different occupation. (Law doesn't cut it--most lawyers are only slightly above average people in intelligence, however much they are above average in income.) And you, Anne, have already referred under the &quot;What I've Found&quot; subject to the same way my dad got stuck in bringing me up--some places that concentrate people with brainpower do even better at concentrating people with money. For the parents who have a lot of compassion for their children's needs to grow and develop their potential, but not a lot of money, &quot;gifted&quot; children can be rather a white elephant gift at times. Ellen Winner discusses the cultural attitudes in the United States that aim scholarships in all kinds of directions other than at the most capable children. And Thomas Sowell (recommended by another participant in the College Tips Board too) discusses in several of his books how colleges price their services far out of relation with the economic value of college.


: 
: The simple fact is that most people who graduate from college differ more in INCOME from non-college-graduates than they do in intelligence, and most of the future income advantage of college attendance, as has been shown by economists of education, derives from the college-educated population's initial higher socioeconomic status, not from &quot;education&quot; received in college. Sowell points out that college &quot;scholarships&quot; are mostly really discounts on the list price of college attendance, which is set by the colleges themselves--often in collusion with other colleges, in a manner that would be an antitrust violation in private industry. Today, being a really smart applicant is not the most compelling factor, much of the time, for obtaining that discount. But I know people who paid out of pocket to go to college, and then graduate school, mostly to take on college teaching positions that don't pay particularly well, just to have the intellectual companionship of their other faculty members (while they endure the doofus undergraduate students).

I believe that it is unfair to the higher ability children to not allow them to be together where they can experience true competition among their peers.

Karl, regarding definitions of giftedness:  The problems that I see with the emphasis on the "multiple intelligence" theory is that it dilutes the very minimal resources that are available for the highly gifted, like my daughter, who are in the 160 and above range.  There are schools for children like our daughter, but they are rare and extremely expensive.  Our daughter was accepted into The Mirman School in Los Angeles last year.  The minimum IQ score for entrance is 145.  The school would be an hour drive each way, so is out of the question for us while she is so young.  Additionally, the tuition is $11,000/year.  We will continue to homeschool our daughter until she expresses a desire to go to school with other children, and at that time will look at Mirman again if she can manage the long commute.  The school was structured, but moved at a very accelerated pace.  The facilities were superb.  If we lived closer, we think our daughter would thrive in the environment of children more similar to herself.  Again, this is an exceptional place.  We would not consider putting her in a magnet school for the gifted, where the IQ minimum is 125 and there are other "intelligences" used for admission.  She would still learn at too different a pace than that population.<p>When it comes to social concerns, your experiences in school and as an adult mirror those of my husband and mine.  We both found most of school to be exquisitely easy (except for my husband's experiences at Claremont).  We both felt that we never fit in like some of our classmates did.  Fortunately, we are very well matched intellectually, so find our social needs addressed well by each other.  We have many friends, but very few that we have literary, political, philosophical discussions with.  My goal, is for our daughter to find contentment within herself.  I do not want her growing up to feeling that she can only be happy if there is a group of people that she fits in with, because I believe it will be difficult for her to find that.  While she enjoys playing with other children, we are extremely happy to see her enjoy the "friendships and adventures" she finds in books, playing with Legos, etc.  I do not believe that there is any career that has a plethora of "gifted" people, whether it is high or low income.  We know quite a few professors, physicians, lawyers, etc.  The point is that people with very high IQ's are uncommon in any field.  My experience with many professors has been that they think they are brilliant because of the position they are in, but there is little to back up their presumptions.  We had an experience when our daughter was two.  She was starting to try to read.  I met a UCLA professor of education to whom I asked what the best method would be to help her learn how to read.  (At the time, I had not studied the virtues/vices of whole language vs phonics).  The professor, who was head of the dept. replied that we should quit reading books with words in them and only show her wordless picture books until she was school age, because it was not the parent's responsibility to teach their children to read, only "teachers" should do it.  This is just one example of the unjustified arrogance of professors that I have met.  Needless to say, by 3 our daughter was reading with nothing more than my husband and me continuing to keep her well stocked in books and reading every day to her.  <p>Yes, I do have Ellen Winner's book.  I just got it, so am about halfway through.  I will reserve comment until I finish it.  I loaned out the rest of my library of books on giftedness to a friend.  There were several that I found more useful than what I have read so far in Ms. Winner's book.  Ms. Winner's writings about children with artistic "gifts" relate to my child's situation only in one way;  where there is exceptional ability, it needs to be nurtured.  A child with high IQ would certainly not gain great benefit from a program that identifies gifted artists as also included.  It seems the public is enamored of children who are prodigious in the arts, but are offended that some children are intellectually superior. <p>I am also aware of Terman's efforts on behalf of his "kids."  Frankly, it would be refreshing to find someone in society today who would take such an interest.  It does not bother me that none of his children were Nobel Laureates.  Neither does it bother me that people who have won the Nobel prize would not have been included in his study.  I recently read an article about how miserable many Nobel winners lives had become after winning.  While it is certainly a high honor, it does not represent to me, a fulfilled life.  One can lead a much less public life, with much less emphasis on public accolades, and have a great deal of satisfaction.  <p>While we are farther along in raising our child than you are, we are still just at the beginning (she is 6).  We won't have answers for many, many years.  I am confident that we are doing the best for her by giving her a strong and rich education here at home.  She is a delightfully happy child and we are enjoying every moment with her.

We will continue to homeschool our daughter until she expresses a desire to go to school with other children, and at that time will look at Mirman again if she can manage the long commute.  The school was structured, but moved at a very accelerated pace.  The facilities were superb.  If we lived closer, we think our daughter would thrive in the environment of children more similar to herself.  Again, this is an exceptional place.  We would not consider putting her in a magnet school for the gifted, where the IQ minimum is 125 and there are other &quot;intelligences&quot; used for admission.  She would still learn at too different a pace than that population.

: When it comes to social concerns, your experiences in school and as an adult mirror those of my husband and mine.  We both found most of school to be exquisitely easy (except for my husband's experiences at Claremont).  We both felt that we never fit in like some of our classmates did.  Fortunately, we are very well matched intellectually, so find our social needs addressed well by each other.  We have many friends, but very few that we have literary, political, philosophical discussions with.  My goal, is for our daughter to find contentment within herself.  I do not want her growing up to feeling that she can only be happy if there is a group of people that she fits in with, because I believe it will be difficult for her to find that.  While she enjoys playing with other children, we are extremely happy to see her enjoy the &quot;friendships and adventures&quot; she finds in books, playing with Legos, etc.  I do not believe that there is any career that has a plethora of &quot;gifted&quot; people, whether it is high or low income.  We know quite a few professors, physicians, lawyers, etc.  The point is that people with very high IQ's are uncommon in any field.  My experience with many professors has been that they think they are brilliant because of the position they are in, but there is little to back up their presumptions.  We had an experience when our daughter was two.  She was starting to try to read.  I met a UCLA professor of education to whom I asked what the best method would be to help her learn how to read.  (At the time, I had not studied the virtues/vices of whole language vs phonics).  The professor, who was head of the dept. replied that we should quit reading books with words in them and only show her wordless picture books until she was school age, because it was not the parent's responsibility to teach their children to read, only &quot;teachers&quot; should do it.  This is just one example of the unjustified arrogance of professors that I have met.  Needless to say, by 3 our daughter was reading with nothing more than my husband and me continuing to keep her well stocked in books and reading every day to her.  

: Yes, I do have Ellen Winner's book.  I just got it, so am about halfway through.  I will reserve comment until I finish it.  I loaned out the rest of my library of books on giftedness to a friend.  There were several that I found more useful than what I have read so far in Ms. Winner's book.  Ms. Winner's writings about children with artistic &quot;gifts&quot; relate to my child's situation only in one way;  where there is exceptional ability, it needs to be nurtured.  A child with high IQ would certainly not gain great benefit from a program that identifies gifted artists as also included.  It seems the public is enamored of children who are prodigious in the arts, but are offended that some children are intellectually superior. 

: I am also aware of Terman's efforts on behalf of his &quot;kids.&quot;  Frankly, it would be refreshing to find someone in society today who would take such an interest.  It does not bother me that none of his children were Nobel Laureates.  Neither does it bother me that people who have won the Nobel prize would not have been included in his study.  I recently read an article about how miserable many Nobel winners lives had become after winning.  While it is certainly a high honor, it does not represent to me, a fulfilled life.  One can lead a much less public life, with much less emphasis on public accolades, and have a great deal of satisfaction.  

: While we are farther along in raising our child than you are, we are still just at the beginning (she is 6).  We won't have answers for many, many years.  I am confident that we are doing the best for her by giving her a strong and rich education here at home.  She is a delightfully happy child and we are enjoying every moment with her.

: But I think it is still on its way to bookstores and libraries, while Cafi tries to find a new book publisher.

<br> Whoever it was that told you that homeschoolers "just aren't eligible for any scholarships" was very wrong! There are many colleges that accept homeschoolers! Try the link at the bottom of this page, as well as the message on this board " Selective" or "Good" Colleges for homeschoolers. Print out these two articles and read them. THe lists of colleges that admit homeschoolers is enourmous! There are 513 colleges on one list, and another several hundred on the other. Also, see the bullitin on this board "How to get the homeschool edition of the Christian College Handbook". This is a very good rescource for people trying to get into a college. Also, Homeschoolers are just as eligible for the NMSQT test as anyone else. NMSQT stands for National Merit Scholarship Qualifying test. Homeschoolers can take the SAT, PSAT and ACT tests. Look at the information on this board about "PSAT" and "More information on the PSAT". <p>As I am a Christian, high-school homeschooled student, I have been doing a lot of research on this, as I hope to enter a college in an Early- Entrance program. Homeschoolers actually have a better chance of getting a scholarship that public school students, as homeschoolers usually excell. Whether you are homeschooled or not, the biggest thing that will get you a scholarship is a high test score. GED tests are not used as much as the SAT, PSAT, and SAT tests. THe test the college will want to see depends on the college itself. I hope this will give you more information, and help you in your search for a college.<p>One last thing- A homeschooled student recently recieved a full scholarship to WEST POINT!<br>

     The Company that puts out  The Christian College Handbook is going to put out a homeschoolers edition. To get a free copy send a letter requesting it with your Student Name, age, and year of graduation, the Parent's name, and the address to Berry Publishing Services 701 Main St; Evanston, IL 60202 or FAX (847)869-4825.The company will put your name in "the most comprehensive list of high-school aged Christian homeschoolers and their parents." The company will ship you a free copy of the 1997 Handbook, and a free Resources Handbook. THey will probably ship out information on some of their other products as well, but I have recieved sopme of them , and they do not ship anything to you that you have to buy, in fact, I have not paid a single cent, and I have recieved The 1996 Great Commission Handbook, and The 1996 Christian College HAndbook. THe handbook has a lot af college information, and I doubt that you will ever have to pay for a copy, as they have so many free offers. Obviously, the company gets a lot of money from College advertising, but there is a lot of information like "What not to believe when choosing a college" " Surviving the financial Aid process" " Christian College versus Bible college: What's the diff?" You ought to get this Handbook if you would like additional information about colleges.

In answer to your questions: (1) What grade is appropriate time for taking PSAT? and (2) Do you ever take it more than once?<br>The answers are: you can take the PSAT as many times as you like, BUT.... SINCE THE PSAT is also the NMSQT, you can only take it ONCE as a qualifier for a scholarship. The first time you take the test could be in your Freshman or Sophmore year. (I'm told by non-homies that this means 9th or 10th grade). THe only time that you will be able to qualify as a NMSQT taker is your Junior year.(11th grade for homeschoolers). I really don't know terribly much about this, so here is the person I got all of this info from. He wrote a preparation for the SAT, which is almost the same thing (PSAT means Preparation for the SAT). He is a homeschooler. ---James P. Stobaugh R.D. 2 , Box 413 Hollsopple, PA 15935-9330. Write " Snail mail" or call 814-479-7710. I have bought his SAT prep course, and it has been improving my score. <p>

: In answer to your questions: (1) What grade is appropriate time for taking PSAT? and (2) Do you ever take it more than once?
: The answers are: you can take the PSAT as many times as you like, BUT.... SINCE THE PSAT is also the NMSQT, you can only take it ONCE as a qualifier for a scholarship. The first time you take the test could be in your Freshman or Sophmore year. (I'm told by non-homies that this means 9th or 10th grade). THe only time that you will be able to qualify as a NMSQT taker is your Junior year.(11th grade for homeschoolers). I really don't know terribly much about this, so here is the person I got all of this info from. He wrote a preparation for the SAT, which is almost the same thing (PSAT means Preparation for the SAT). He is a homeschooler. ---James P. Stobaugh R.D. 2 , Box 413 Hollsopple, PA 15935-9330. Write &quot; Snail mail&quot; or call 814-479-7710. I have bought his SAT prep course, and it has been improving my score.

I just remembered that the SAT info person, James Stobaugh, gave a seminar at the CHEO (Christian Home Educators of Ohio) convention. If you would like to get the tape, the company that makes the tapes is CTI Conference Taping: 1704 Valencia NE; Albuquerque, NM 87110. Or PHONE (505)265-1177 OR FAX 505 255 1270. THe tape is tape #324 from the CHEO Convention. It is called Preparation for SAT by James Stobaugh. Another tape you might like to get is #9 College Why and How by Linda Boney and Heather McCurdy. The tapes run $4.50 each, with $2.50 shipping and handling for 1-10 tapes. The total cost for the 2 tapes with shipping and handling should be- $11.50. I hope this helps you with your information finding.

Karl, my daughter is 6, but is almost done with 3rd grade and will probably complete 4th by spring.  Because of the grade advancement, I didn't think it was too early to get started finding about requirements for college.  My husband is an alumnus of Claremont McKenna College in Claremont, CA.  It is a highly regarded college in many circles.  I spoke with their admissions department and was told that they would certainly accept homeschoolers.  They just indicated that they would put more weight on the SAT's.  Also, Cal State will accept homeschoolers.  Many of the students in their early admissions programs have been homeschooled all the way through.  Additionally, there is a math program for gifted children through Stanford University.  While some of the participants do the program while attending regular schools, there are quite a few homeschoolers enrolled.  Since Stanford gives credits for it if your child attends there, I would assume they would accept homeschoolers.  I am trying to develop a portfolio of work as we go along.  Additionally, I will add regular achievement tests to the ones that we already have.  We are not using a formal curriculum for elementary school.  If our daughter does not attend high school elsewhere, I will wonder whether it will be more useful for college admission to use a formal curriculum?  Have you heard any pros or cons?

I did not contact other Cal State campuses other than Dominguez Hills.  They are the only campus that offers early enrollment-as young as 11, if I am not mistaken.  They do it by test scores that they offer a couple times a year.  Obviously, most of the kids who qualify to be admitted between ages 11-16, probably have not gone to a formal high school, and likely skipped or accelerated portions of any high school curriculum they use.  As far as Claremont, I did mean to mention that the admissions person I spoke to also said the interview would count for quite a bit.  The structure of the classes requires the maturity to defend your assertions and participate fully in their type of classes.  Since Harvey Mudd is one of the Claremont colleges, I would assume their admissions would allow for homeschoolers also.  Both schools have high admission standards, so I would be surprised that they would accept someone who was using community colleges as a reference for their ability, unless it is accompanied by a very impressive portfolio of accomplishments, test scores, and good interview.  After all the money we will have paid into Stanford for several years of EPGY, I certainly hope that they will be open to accepting our daughter, if she meets other valid criteria.  Of course, she may not even want to go there!

Karl, I read Terman's Kids, and almost every other work that has been published about gifted children.  Thanks for the suggestion though.  In fact, I find very interesting the dichotomy between some of the older studies, reports, and books on gifted children, and the current genre of material.  Most of the currently published material does not have the longitudinal basis that Terman's work does.  Additionally, so much of the modern literature is geared toward the pc "every child is a gifted child" philosophy which attempts to negate the differences that separate high IQ children from the average population.<br>My experience has been that there is very little support for families with highly gifted children.  Other parents don't like it when your child is academically ahead of their children, public schools define giftedness with such broad strokes, that even their minimal GATE programs are insufficient for high IQ children, and the only gifted school within a reasonable distance (1 hour each way), has a tuition of $11,000 per year.  It only goes up to high school.  At those prices, combined with a private high school, there would be no money left for college!

Posted by <a href="mailto:bunda002@gold.tc.umn.edu">Karl M. Bunday</a> on September 30, 1996 at 22:56:14:<p>
<center><img src="http://198.83.19.39/School_is_dead/kmbweb.gif"></center><p>
All the time I'm looking for a few good colleges, especially colleges and universities that have accepted homeschooled applicants. I have been researching the issue of college entrance for homeschoolers for several years. My Colleges That Accept Homeschoolers FAQ Web page (which is now listed in Yahoo's College Entrance category) appears at<p><p><br>http://198.83.19.39/School_is_dead/colleges_4_hmsc.html<p><p><br>I hope all of you enjoy the Web page, which is the original and the best of its kind. Accept no substitutes anywhere on the Web. And please let me know what other information you would like added to that Web page.<p><p><br>As part of continually improving the Colleges That Accept Homeschoolers FAQ, I've put together a list of "selective" or "good" colleges to see how many of those are known to have accepted homeschooled applicants. Many of the 513 entries below (which is at least 512 more colleges than anyone NEEDS to attend to obtain a good education) are not listed on my current FAQ page. I've now heard about sixty "selective" colleges that have admitted homeschoolers, but there are hundreds more listed below, and I don't mind hearing again about a college that I already know admits homeschoolers. Do you know of any college that has admitted a homeschooled applicant?<p><p> <br>In the past few years I've heard from parents of homeschoolers who were admitted to various colleges, from the admitted students themselves (at least three of whom have Web pages on a university server), from university admissions officers (both directly by E-mail and indirectly by letters forwarded to me by online friends), and from various mass media about homeschoolers being admitted to various colleges. But don't be afraid to doubly confirm anything you think I might already know. Consider me ignorant [grin]. Please let me know of ANY homeschooled child who was granted admission to ANY college listed below, or to any other college listed in The World Almanac and Book of Facts (which is based on the files of the Peterson's guides) or in the Information Please Almanac. (I use the almanacs to confirm the spelling and location of the colleges people tell me about.) The last time I posted this list, I received a great deal of help from a homeschooling mother in Pennsylvania who has been active in homeschooling circles there and knows of students who have entered just about all of that state's selective colleges. What is happening where you live? Are all the best colleges in your part of the world getting applications from, and ACCEPTING applications from, homeschoolers? I'll be posting this inquiry to the Prodigy and CompuServe commercial online networks, to one or two E-mail mailing lists related to homeschooling, and to various USENET newsgroups. Feel free to reprint this post in a local newsletter or to repost it or forward it to other online discussion groups and mailing lists.<p><p><br>The colleges listed below were found in various standard reference books available in public libraries, variously listing "the few hundred best schools in the country," "America's top liberal arts schools," "competitive colleges," colleges that "offer students the best opportunity to maximize their education," "public Ivy" colleges, "the best and most interesting" colleges, colleges that are "selective+," or "America's best colleges." For each time that a college was listed in one of the books I consulted, it gets a star (*) on the list below. As far as I remember, NO college listed got the maximum possible nine stars. My grandfather's alma mater gets six stars; so does my dad's (and grandmother's). So does mine. Because I had nothing to do with setting up the criteria for choosing colleges in any of those reference books, and because I reserve the right to disagree with the number of stars attached to any listing, don't complain to me if your own alma mater isn't even listed here [grin]. I AM happy to hear about any college listed in the two almanacs mentioned above that has admitted a homeschooler, and to hear about how you know that.<p><p><br>Abbreviations in the list below are<br><br>A&M = Agricultural and Mechanical (usually)<br><br>C = College<br><br>S = State<br><br>Sch. = School<br><br>Sci. = Science<br><br>Soc. Res. = Social Research<br><br>U = University<br><br>United States Postal Service abbrevations for states follow almost all entries, except for those where the name of the state in which the college is located is part of the college's name. Alphabetization follows the World Almanac whenever a college was listed in that source. Note particularly that SUNY Albany is listed by its FULL name (as abbreviated here), which means it is out of sequence from all the other SUNY schools listed. There are some other peculiarities of alphabetization, so don't be discouraged if you don't see your favorite school the first time you look through the list of 513 entries below.<br><p><p><br>Adelphi U NY * *<br><br>Agnes Scott C GA * * * *<br><br>Albert A.

: All the time I'm looking for a few good colleges, especially colleges and universities that have accepted homeschooled applicants. I have been researching the issue of college entrance for homeschoolers for several years. My Colleges That Accept Homeschoolers FAQ Web page (which is now listed in Yahoo's College Entrance category) appears at

: 
: I hope all of you enjoy the Web page, which is the original and the best of its kind. Accept no substitutes anywhere on the Web. And please let me know what other information you would like added to that Web page.


: 
: As part of continually improving the Colleges That Accept Homeschoolers FAQ, I've put together a list of &quot;selective&quot; or &quot;good&quot; colleges to see how many of those are known to have accepted homeschooled applicants. Many of the 513 entries below (which is at least 512 more colleges than anyone NEEDS to attend to obtain a good education) are not listed on my current FAQ page. I've now heard about sixty &quot;selective&quot; colleges that have admitted homeschoolers, but there are hundreds more listed below, and I don't mind hearing again about a college that I already know admits homeschoolers. Do you know of any college that has admitted a homeschooled applicant?


:  
: In the past few years I've heard from parents of homeschoolers who were admitted to various colleges, from the admitted students themselves (at least three of whom have Web pages on a university server), from university admissions officers (both directly by E-mail and indirectly by letters forwarded to me by online friends), and from various mass media about homeschoolers being admitted to various colleges. But don't be afraid to doubly confirm anything you think I might already know. Consider me ignorant [grin]. Please let me know of ANY homeschooled child who was granted admission to ANY college listed below, or to any other college listed in The World Almanac and Book of Facts (which is based on the files of the Peterson's guides) or in the Information Please Almanac. (I use the almanacs to confirm the spelling and location of the colleges people tell me about.) The last time I posted this list, I received a great deal of help from a homeschooling mother in Pennsylvania who has been active in homeschooling circles there and knows of students who have entered just about all of that state's selective colleges. What is happening where you live? Are all the best colleges in your part of the world getting applications from, and ACCEPTING applications from, homeschoolers? I'll be posting this inquiry to the Prodigy and CompuServe commercial online networks, to one or two E-mail mailing lists related to homeschooling, and to various USENET newsgroups. Feel free to reprint this post in a local newsletter or to repost it or forward it to other online discussion groups and mailing lists.


: 
: The colleges listed below were found in various standard reference books available in public libraries, variously listing &quot;the few hundred best schools in the country,&quot; &quot;America's top liberal arts schools,&quot; &quot;competitive colleges,&quot; colleges that &quot;offer students the best opportunity to maximize their education,&quot; &quot;public Ivy&quot; colleges, &quot;the best and most interesting&quot; colleges, colleges that are &quot;selective+,&quot; or &quot;America's best colleges.&quot; For each time that a college was listed in one of the books I consulted, it gets a star (*) on the list below. As far as I remember, NO college listed got the maximum possible nine stars. My grandfather's alma mater gets six stars; so does my dad's (and grandmother's). So does mine. Because I had nothing to do with setting up the criteria for choosing colleges in any of those reference books, and because I reserve the right to disagree with the number of stars attached to any listing, don't complain to me if your own alma mater isn't even listed here [grin]. I AM happy to hear about any college listed in the two almanacs mentioned above that has admitted a homeschooler, and to hear about how you know that.


: 
: Abbreviations in the list below are
: 
: A&M = Agricultural and Mechanical (usually)
: 
: C = College
: 
: S = State
: 
: Sch. = School
: 
: Sci. = Science
: 
: Soc. Res. = Social Research
: 
: U = University
: 
: United States Postal Service abbrevations for states follow almost all entries, except for those where the name of the state in which the college is located is part of the college's name. Alphabetization follows the World Almanac whenever a college was listed in that source. Note particularly that SUNY Albany is listed by its FULL name (as abbreviated here), which means it is out of sequence from all the other SUNY schools listed. There are some other peculiarities of alphabetization, so don't be discouraged if you don't see your favorite school the first time you look through the list of 513 entries below.

Hi, everyone, welcome. Come on in and enjoy the exchange of information.

I'm a dad of one son, just four years old, who has been a researcher on homeschooling since before my son was born. I have recently (that is, for the past few years) been keeping a Frequently Asked Question (FAQ) file on the names of colleges that admit homeschoolers. Over the years I've checked and rechecked entries in that FAQ, and have gathered lots of other information about college admissions. But I'm <em>not</em>, fortunately, going through the college search process right now myself. So I can be dispassionate and I hope objective as we share information about college opportunities for homeschoolers.<p><p><br>Indeed, the title of this message board should not lead us to presuppose that every homeschooled child belongs in college, any more than all children who have received other forms of education belong in college. I would be glad to join in discussions here on why <em>not</em> to go to college, and about what happens to homeschooled young people who choose not to go to college. If the issue relates to homeschoolers and college from any angle, it is fair game for discussion here.<p><p><br>I agreed to host this message board because of my ongoing research interest in college issues, begun when I started maintaining the FAQ. I shall have to invite my old online friend (whom I have met once in person, in May 1993), <a HREF="mailto:sbrk67b@prodigy.com">Cafi Cohen</a>, to join the discussion. Cafi is a homeschooling mom who has gone through sending her two children off to college. Now she is awaiting publication of her book <cite>And What about College?</cite>, which will provide a personal account of her experiences and present the results of much research on the subject.

: Hi, everyone, welcome. Come on in and enjoy the exchange of information. I'm really excited about the potential of Web-based discussion fora as they seem to be free of much of the &quot;spamming&quot; and flaming that, alas, characterizes USENET.


: 
: First, a little about me. I'm a dad of one son, just four years old, who has been a researcher on homeschooling since before my son was born. I have recently (that is, for the past few years) been keeping a Frequently Asked Question (FAQ) file on the names of colleges that admit homeschoolers. Over the years I've checked and rechecked entries in that FAQ, and have gathered lots of other information about college admissions. But I'm &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt;, fortunately, going through the college search process right now myself. So I can be dispassionate and I hope objective as we share information about college opportunities for homeschoolers.


: 
: Indeed, the title of this message board should not lead us to presuppose that every homeschooled child belongs in college, any more than all children who have received other forms of education belong in college. I would be glad to join in discussions here on why &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to go to college, and about what happens to homeschooled young people who choose not to go to college. If the issue relates to homeschoolers and college from any angle, it is fair game for discussion here.


: 
: I agreed to host this message board because of my ongoing research interest in college issues, begun when I started maintaining the FAQ. I shall have to invite my old online friend (whom I have met once in person, in May 1993), &lt;a HREF=&quot;mailto:sbrk67b@prodigy.com&quot;&gt;Cafi Cohen&lt;/a&gt;, to join the discussion. Cafi is a homeschooling mom who has gone through sending her two children off to college. Now she is awaiting publication of her book &lt;cite&gt;And What about College?&lt;/cite&gt;, which will provide a personal account of her experiences and present the results of much research on the subject. I will always be delighted to hear from any of you about colleges that have admitted homeschoolers, to make sure that they are noted in the FAQ file.

Karl M. Bunday is the creator of the Colleges That Admit Homeschoolers FAQ (http://198.83.19.39/School_is_dead/colleges_4_hmsc.html).  It is the most accurate resource of its kind, as well as the most informative about the ins and the outs of the college admission process. The FAQ is listed in Yahoo's Education: College Entrance directory, and thus is frequently visited by college admissions officers--the most reliable source on which colleges have admitted homeschoolers. There is also an extensive bibliography of college guides in the Colleges That Admit Homeschoolers FAQ.<p>In addition to a great deal of other work, Karl has also created a comprehensive bibliography on homeschooling (http://198.83.19.39/School_is_dead/bibliographies.html). It is perhaps already the largest resource of it's kind in the world, and certain to be the largest in the world after forthcoming revisions. Through years of research in consultation with many librarians he has found books on homeschooling for teenagers, for African-Americans, for children with special needs, and for parents in particular states of the United States. He has found titles not only in English but also in French and Japanese, and not only popular books about homeschooling but also videotapes and academic theses. If someone wants to start a research project on homeschooling, there is hardly a better place to start than in the bibliographies on the School Is Dead, Learn in Freedom! Web site (http://198.83.19.39/School_is_dead/Learn_in_freedom.html). <p>So join me in welcoming Karl to the growing network of homeschool message boards.<p>Cindy<br>

<body><h1>WWWBoard Frequently Asked Questions and Answers</h1>
Here is a brief explanation of some of the questions you may have 
about WWWBoard.<hr>
<ul>
<li><a href="#links">Can I use html tags anywhere in my posts?</a>
<li><a href="#colons">Why are there colons in the message section when I 
try post a followup?</a>
<li><a href="#reload">Why didn't my post show up?</a>
<li><a href="#getit">Where can I get the scripts for this program?</a>
</ul><hr><p>
<a name="links">Can I put html tags anywhere in my posts?</a><p>
No.  You can not use HTML tags in any field except body of the message.  
The maintainer of the script has the option of allowing or 
disallowing any HTML in the Message part of your posting.  If 
they disallow it, the script will just throw out everything in 
&lt;&gt;'s.  If they allow it, your html markup will appear in 
the posting.  It can't hurt to try.<p><hr><p> 

<a name="colons">Why are there colons in the message when I try to post a 
followup?</a><p>
Colons appear in the message dialog box when you try to followup up on a 
message to indicate that those lines are quoting the previous document. 
The owner of the WWWBoard can decide whether they wish to enable or 
disable the quoting of previous messages.<p><hr><p>


<a name="reload">Why didn't my post show up?</a><p>
Your post most likely did not show up, because your browser did not reload the 
page, it simply pulled it out of cache.  Please reload your browser and it 
should then appear.<p><hr><p>
<a name="getit">Where can I get the scripts for this program?</a><p>
The scripts are written in Perl and created by <a 
href="http://alpha.pr1.k12.co.us/~mattw/home.html">Matt Wright</a>.  They are 
free to anyone who wishes to use them and you can get them as well as other 
scripts at: <a href="http://worldwidemart.com/scripts/">http://worldwidemart.com/scripts/</a>.  
Enjoy!<p><hr>

Posted by <a href="mailto:stams@mail.kdsi.net">Monique Stam</a> on December 01, 1996 at 09:35:41:<p>
I am looking for some drama for early elementary students and either drama (short play)  or reader's theater to do with our home school group.  I would prefer it to have a specifically christian content, but historical is my second choice.  I *am not* looking for holiday specific material.  Thanks.  If you want to e-mail me privately, that would be helpful, as I don't get here as often as I'd like to.  Monique stams2mail.kdsi.net

: Does anyone know of a good art curriculum that isn't too expensive to use with a gifted six year old artist?<p>If you are looking for a well rounded program I would recommend "Art Adventures at Home" which I reviewed earlier (scroll down). This program teaches children the fundamentals and works with gifted or average.  If you are looking for a drawing program there are two books which come to mind: "Draw Squad" and "Drawing With Children". Both are available at most bookstores.  We use Draw Squad which teaches perspective (as does Drawing With Children I believe).<br>    Andrea<br>

If you live in So. California, KKGO @105.1 FM is broadcasting the series that includes Beethoven Lives Upstairs, Mr. Bach Comes to Call, etc.  They are broadcasting them Sunday mornings from 10 to 11 am, from October 6 - Nov. 17.  After Nov. 17, they said that they are going to continue a children's musical education hour in that time slot every Sunday.  Given the cost of the CD's, it's a good way for your kids to hear them.

I recently had a chance to take a look at Stewardship's Taking the Mystery Out of Art History unit study. It is well done, and has everything provided for those who would like to give  unit studies a try but are intimidated/lack time.  If I hadn't already purchased "35 Short Lessons In Art History" I would have picked Stewardship's product up.  <p>Charity

: <br>: Charity- you gave us just the bait....Tell me more about Stewardship's book...the where to obtain,what's it all about ect of it...thanks Marie<p>: <p>Ok, Ok, Marie, you're right. That was a lousy review. I looked at the material at a friend's house so it was a fairly quick perusal. But..one thing I really like about it was that it started with ancient history, Ancient Egypt, Ancient Rome, etc.  So many art history studies begin at the Ren and Ref. period.  The unit study contains a timeline with attractive graphics, some basic background information, worksheets, etc.  It can be purchased from the Stewardship company, PO Box 164, Garden Valley, CA 95633 (916)333-1642. I can't remember the price. I think it was around $20.00.  Like most unit study guides, it is not a stand alone product. I think it would be well-rounded by adding in Jansens, A Child's History of Arts as a text, reading some biographies and doing some hands-on projects.  There! Does that help?  :)  blessings, Charity

Hi!<p>    I've heard mentioned and seen somewhere in a catalog,<br>some CD's, one of which is called Beethoven Lives Up-<br>Stairs.(?)   Does anyone know about these.   Have you tried<br>them?  I thought they might be nice to use for music class.<br>It'd be nice, I think, to play something like this in<br>the background while working on an art project, too.<p>Any opinions? <p>Thanks,<br>Sue<p><br>

Midge<p>I forgot to mention (since you mentioned playing some music while doing art) the OptimaLearning Classics from Sing 'n Learn are great for background music.  They actually help maximize learning.  Through many of years of research, the producer of this program has discovered the types and moods of music that work best in every learning situation.  These tapes are pure, classical music -- no singing or talking -- designed to be used while memorizing, writing, studying, relaxing, painting, etc.  He suggests how they can be used on the J-Cards of the tapes.  They really have a nice effect while played during certain periods of the day when you are trying to maximize your learning and studying times.  You can get more information by calling Sing 'n Learn at 1-800-460-1973.  They also have a tape or CD called Mozart Makes You Smarter done around the same idea.

: : : :     I've heard mentioned and seen somewhere in a catalog,
: : : : some CD's, one of which is called Beethoven Lives Up-
: : : : Stairs.(?)   Does anyone know about these.   Have you tried
: : : : them?  I thought they might be nice to use for music class.
: : : : It'd be nice, I think, to play something like this in
: : : : the background while working on an art project, too.

: : : : Any opinions? 

: : 
: : There are also teacher notes for all of the classical kids collection:  Hallelujah Handel, Tchaikovsky Discovers America, Mozart's Magic Fantasy, Beethoven Lives Upstairs, Vivaldi's Ring of Mystery, and Mr. Bach Comes to Call.
: : There are tons of teaching helps and suggestions -- you can even make a unit study on each of these composers, his music, where he lived, etc.

: : There are also some wonderful composer videos out similar to Beethoven Lives Upstairs:  Bach's Fight for Freedom, Bizet's Dream (CARMEN), Liszt's Rhapsody, Strauss, The King of 3/4 time, and Rossini's Ghost.  They are excellent quality and are produced for children.  You can get them through Sing 'n Learn at 1-800-460-1973

: 
: : 
: : : : Thanks,
: : : : Sue

: : : Hi! Sue,
: : : In addition to the 4 tapes that Nancy listed, there are 3 more:  Tchaikovsky Discovers America; Hallelujah Handel!; and another one that centers around lullabies.  I have all of them but the last one.  I can't say enough about them.  I love them and since they capture the children's imagination by using excellent story lines, the children really remember what they have heard.  While in a bookstore, my son told his grandfather, &quot;Granddad, I know who that is, (music playing over the intercom), that's Beethoven!&quot;  What i like about the story lines are the props used to really take you back in time, to the setting where everything takes place.  I found all the tapes at my bookstore I use.  Beethoven lives upstairs is also on video cassette and the entire family really loved it, however, it differs slightly from the audio cassette.  Hope this helps.  Midge

: I forgot to mention (since you mentioned playing some music while doing art) the OptimaLearning Classics from Sing 'n Learn are great for background music.  They actually help maximize learning.  Through many of years of research, the producer of this program has discovered the types and moods of music that work best in every learning situation.  These tapes are pure, classical music -- no singing or talking -- designed to be used while memorizing, writing, studying, relaxing, painting, etc.  He suggests how they can be used on the J-Cards of the tapes.  They really have a nice effect while played during certain periods of the day when you are trying to maximize your learning and studying times.  You can get more information by calling Sing 'n Learn at 1-800-460-1973.  They also have a tape or CD called Mozart Makes You Smarter done around the same idea.

I would like for someone to give me an opinion regarding "Child Size Masterpieces of Fine Art" (formerly called "Mommy, It's a Renoir!").  It has a manual which shows how to study and present paintings to young children using 8 steps.  Then there are the postcard-size reproductions of the paintings that go along with it.  I would appreciate any comments on this program.<br>Thanks!

Hi- We have used  the Mommy It's A Renoir for the last year and will continue with it. Our kids are 7  and 10  and they do like it but I don't follow the book completely. I use the post cards as a jumping off sort of place. I would suggest getting the book first and if you have access to postcards get them and just let your kids play with them. We have a corner where we have an artist of the month and we chat about him or her- kids do research on the artist and the period and I will read a book or two and then we do a project or two following the same sort of artistic theme. I invested over $100 for the program and probably could of done without- the cutting out, laminating and folders were a bit of a pain too! But now that they are all neatly organized I am more open to suggesting the program- last year this time I would have been less than supportive of it! Good luck, Marie<p><p><br>: I would like for someone to give me an opinion regarding "Child Size Masterpieces of Fine Art" (formerly called "Mommy, It's a Renoir!").

   Next week we are going to begin a more formal introduction to music with the kids.  They have had some piano lessons (from me), listen to music often and have been to children's concerts.  This mini unit is to familiarize them with what is considered music, different instruments, vocabulary & concepts, and to help them recognize the instruments and the concepts that they have learned (like melody, rhythm etc) while listening to music.  Also, they will learn a little about composers and how there are different types of music.

: :: Tell us more please about Art Adven at Home? I have not seen it ever!!! Marie<p>Marie,  It is a complete art curriculum program designed by an art teacher and a homeschool mom.  It covers everything from painting, sculpture, pastles, block prints etc in an orderly and incremental fashion.  If you have ever seen Discover Art (a series used in many schools) it is comparable to that, only the book is not as "fancy" to look at (which is why the price is only $15.95 for 3 years as opposed to almost $30 for one year).  Volumn 1 begins with lines and patterns (using differnt materials) and moves on to more complicated material.  If you have children at different ages you can study the same thing but do different projects because concept and level are both listed in the book.  When I first saw the book I was disapointed, but after having used it I realize what a treasure it is and consider it one of my best teaching resources.  (They even tell you how to teach batique with rubber cement, paper and paint)<br>andrea

Posted by <a href="mailto:cccandc@alaska.net">Charity</a> on August 22, 1996 at 22:13:07:<p>
Hubby wants our 9yo son to start on music this year. I am unsure whether I should start with some basic Music Appreciation or Music Theory. And would also appreciate hearing suggestions for curriculum for either area. Have anyone used Keyboard Capers? If I go with Music Appreciation I want a much broader survey than most curriculums provide (which almost alway focus solely on classical). I want to cover Jazz, Classical, Modern, Broadway, etc.  Any suggestions? If I have to I'll put together my own curriculum but am already doing so in so many other areas that I really need a good supportive curriculum for music.  If I sounds desperate, it's because I am!!  thank you for any assistance,  Charity

: Hubby wants our 9yo son to start on music this year. I am unsure whether I should start with some basic Music Appreciation or Music Theory. And would also appreciate hearing suggestions for curriculum for either area. Have anyone used Keyboard Capers? If I go with Music Appreciation I want a much broader survey than most curriculums provide (which almost alway focus solely on classical). I want to cover Jazz, Classical, Modern, Broadway, etc.  Any suggestions? If I have to I'll put together my own curriculum but am already doing so in so many other areas that I really need a good supportive curriculum for music.  If I sounds desperate, it's because I am!!  thank you for any assistance,  Charity

Here's what I decided to do. I think I will teach some very basic music theory first, then go on to Music History (chronologically starting with the Roman Empire - to tie in with our history).  My reasoning is that my sons will need a basic knowledge of theory and the instruments before studying music history. Otherwise how will they know what I mean when I describe different types of music.  Example, Waltz always had 3 beat timing or Swing was typified by brass instruments. Make sense? Thanks for all your input. Charity

Your child does not need to know that a waltz has three beats in the beginning.  Right now just expose him to the different types of music -- not even mentioning the time periods right now.  You can ask him what instrument he thinks is playing, but don't concentrate too heavily on that at first.  There are so many wonderful types of music from Gregorian Chants through Bach right up to today.  You can also take a different direction and go with music from different countries and teach him those sounds by just listening to them.  Ear training is very important, plus a love of music.  Please tell him it is okay not to like a particular piece of music.  Everyone has different tastes, but I have had students whose parents have told them they must like a piece of music just because it's a *CLASSIC*.  Music theory can get very complicated very quickly especially if you are trying to explain what makes a certain piece of music what it is.  Hope you can use this info.  It also provides you with a few minutes of quiet as you listen to music.  My kids like to do that in the afternoon before all the neighbor kids get home from school.  It is a relaxing time for them.  We are on our second year of music appreciation.  There is just so much to listen to without repeating a composer. <p>Marty<br>

Your  advice makes sense and I will ease off the music theory for awhile. We have been listening to a wide variety of music as we study the different instruments. For example on "violin day" we listened to chamber music, bluegrass fiddle-playing, Broadway music and a variety of other styles. This week we are looking at Brass instruments and will be listening to Sousa marches, classical, Big Band, swing, jazz (Candy Dulfur's marvelous Saxuality tape), circus music as well as classical.  Again, thanks for your help.  Blessings,  Charity<br>

   I've seen Keyboard Capers and have talked to people who have used it.  They really enjoyed it and felt as though there kids learned a lot.  The only negative I heard was that the manipulatives take a long time to make.  Apparently Timberdoodle also sells a theory book that some enjoy. "Marsalis On Music", which was on PBS last year, is supposed to be one of the better introductions to music appreciation and would be a good start.  I'm hoping our library will have it soon (it goes for $72 for 4 videos).  There are lesson plans on the internet for it.<br>    We also want to cover all of the areas of music and will be doing that this year.  I will post our plan as we go along.  I'm starting out with a general introduction to music: the instruments, melody (harmony etc), then we will focus on classical (Mozart) and jazz (Duke Ellington) just as part of the introduction.  After that we are going to work through history starting with Byzantine.  <br>     A catalog with many good cassettes on music is the Education Record Center at 1-800-438-1637.  They sell the Marsalis tapes as well as others that are less expensive.  I have there general introduction to jazz....starts off goofey but is great.  Rainbow Resources sells a tape for about $2.99 on the instruments of the orchestra.  It is geared more toward the younger set (it has a cutsey but catchy tune) but my almost 9 year old son likes to hear it with his younger sisters.

:      A catalog with many good cassettes on music is the Education Record Center at 1-800-438-1637.  They sell the Marsalis tapes as well as others that are less expensive.  I have there general introduction to jazz....starts off goofey but is great.  Rainbow Resources sells a tape for about $2.99 on the instruments of the orchestra.  It is geared more toward the younger set (it has a cutsey but catchy tune) but my almost 9 year old son likes to hear it with his younger sisters.  We've can pick out most of the instruments now when we hear any type of music.

: : Hubby wants our 9yo son to start on music this year. I am unsure whether I should start with some basic Music Appreciation or Music Theory. And would also appreciate hearing suggestions for curriculum for either area. Have anyone used Keyboard Capers? If I go with Music Appreciation I want a much broader survey than most curriculums provide (which almost alway focus solely on classical). I want to cover Jazz, Classical, Modern, Broadway, etc.  Any suggestions? If I have to I'll put together my own curriculum but am already doing so in so many other areas that I really need a good supportive curriculum for music.

<br>I used "Ready-to-Use Music Reading Activities" with my two children 2 years ago, but I confess we didn't do the whole program.  I felt uncomfortable with it and the children were rather bored with it.  Last year, we all three learned to play recorder (I already play guitar, but am not an expert, and some piano).  Learning to play the recorder was easy and fun and both the children learned to read music as they played.  It seemed much more meaningful.  We had planned to start piano lessons this year (at the request of the children), but we haven't found a teacher that we liked yet, so we may just wait a while.  In the meantime, I am continuing with the recorder.<br> <br>Deanne

Kathy-<br>	I am a freshman in college currently majoring<br>in violin and engineering.  I started violin when I<br>was 3 and piano was added a few years later.

If you are considering homeschooling, here is a good general reference <a href="http://www.netc.com/gok/faq.html">Homeschooling FAQ</a>.
<P>
If you need a sample Ohio notification form that you can print out and send in to your county superintendent's office, you can use this <a href="http://www.kaleidoscapes.com/h_e_form.html">notification form</a>
<P>
There are plenty of resources out there for folks interested in home educating in Ohio, so rather than rewrite the resources, I'd just like to point you to Steve Thorn's outstanding resource page that covers just about every aspect of <a href="http://www.dgii.com/people/thorn/school.html">Homeschooling in Ohio</a>.  He has also compiled an assortment of Ohio homeschoolers' web pages.
<P>

If a state-wide email list interests you, Kaleidoscapes manages a free email list which was created  to be used as a support group and to give home educators in Ohio the opportunity to communicate with each other.  An <a href="http://www.kaleidoscapes.com/ohhs-faq.html">information page</a> about the list is available.  
Or you can join immediately by sending email to oh-homeschool-request@kjsl.com with SUBSCRIBE in the body of the message.
<P>

Finally, Kaleidoscapes offers many delights for homeschoolers all around the world, not just Ohio.  You will find many wonderful discussion boards for homeschoolers (or anyone), <BR>plus lots more!

There are several mail lists for homeschoolers. Following is the ones I know
of--there are others for specific states. For instance, I know Indiana has a
list that is pretty active.
<P>

HOME-SCHOOLING MAILING LISTS
<P>
	While this list strives to be as accurate as possible, it can be in no way
considered current.  One thing you can count on with the Internet is that
nothing stays the same.
<P>

Home Education - General<BR>
The broadest list, with lots of often rather tangential traffic. (Don't get
me wrong - it's a great list - but don't join it if you already have too much
email!).<BR>
To subscribe send a message to<BR>
home-ed-request@world.std.com

<P>
The Home-Ed-Kids list<BR>
This is a mailing list for homeschooled kids.The home-ed-kids mailing list is
setup to enable kids to share ideas and make friends via e-mail. 
To subscribe send mail to<BR>
majordomo@sara.zia.com<BR>
with the following in the body of the mail<BR>
subscribe home-ed-kids

<P>
Home Education Politics<BR>
Strong anti-government sentiments primarily from the "Christian" conservative
/ libertarians / anarchists end of the spectrum.  <BR>
To subscribe send a message to<BR>
home-ed-politics-request@mainstream.com
<P>

Homeschool_train_up_a_child@ mainstream.com<BR>
This list has been terminated and has been replaced by<BR>
hstuac@VMS1.CC.UOP.EDU<BR>
Entirely "Christian".<BR>
To subscribe send a message to <BR>
hstuac-request@VMS1.CC.UOP.EDU-
<P>
The Home Education Research list<BR>
Home Education Research is a list for scholars, researchers, and others
professionally interested in the area of home education.  The list will be a
forum to share information; research methodology and  findings; rare sources
and documents; and advice.
The list is limited to individuals who are or have done scholarly research in
the area of home education and continue to have an active  interest; or those
that have a professional or ministerial interest in serving the home
education community.
One will need to have moderator approval for membership and only those
individuals on the list will be able to post.<BR>
To subscribe to hmedrsch send the command - <BR>
subscribe hmedrsch to listserv@etsuadmn.etus.edu<P>


learning@sea.east.sun.com<BR>
A low-traffic list with an emphasis on unschooling. <BR>
To subscribe send a message to<BR>
learning-request@sea.east.sun.com<P></P>


Separation of School & State<BR>
The "SepSchool" mailing list has been established to promote the discussion
of the concept of separating *school* and state.  Discussion of the
activities, tactics, and strategy of the Separation of School & State
Alliance are also encouraged.
This mailing list is sponsored by the Separation of School & State Alliance.
The Separation Alliance is a grassroots nonprofit organization dedicated to
rediscovering the original American public education system -privately
operated, open to the public. 
Our mission is to inform Americans how education can be improved -especially
for the poor - by the full separation of school and state.  Full separation
means ending government compelled attendance, financing, curriculum, testing,
credentialing, and accreditation.
We have no political or religious affiliations.  We are strictly educational
and leave to others any ballot initiatives, lobbying, or electioneering
needed to accomplish Separation.<BR>
To subscribe (or unsubscribe) to the "sepschool" mailing list, send mail to
"sepschool-request@sepschool.org"<BR>
with the word "subscribe" (or "unsubscribe") in either the subject or text
fields. 
<P>

Taking Children Seriously<BR>
This list, sponsored by Sarah Lawrence of the eponymous British
home-schooling magazine, Taking Children Seriously, is not strictly a
home-schooling mailing list.  Rather, it is devoted to serious, intense, and
all too prolix discussion of what it means to raise children non-cocercively,
as human beings in their own right. <BR>
To subscribe send a message to<BR>
TCS-list [YOUR E-MAILADDRESS] to listserv@netcom.com

<P>
</P>The Unschooling Mailing List<BR>
The Unschooling Mailing List is a list for anyone who is interested in
discussing unschooling--experiences, advice, questions, and theory.
This list will undoubtedly reflect the varying "degrees" of unschooling.
 Most will agree, however, that trusting a child's ability to learn and
providing a stimulating and diverse environment define the essence of
unschooling."<BR>
Subscribe by sending mail to: <BR>
majordomo@nilenet.com<BR>
with subscribe unschooling-list as the message text.<P>

<font size="+7">What's New!<br>
</font>
<p>
December 28, 1996.  Have been adding Java applets and Active X controls throughout the site.  Wanted to make it more lively. :-)

<p>
Also, am continually adding cool stuff to the <a href="http://www.kaleidoscapes.com/kidsplace">Kids' Place</a> so check it out!
<p>
November 24, 1996.  Gave the site a new look.  Also gave the site a "What's New" page so folks can keep up on what's new with Kaleidoscapes discussion boards and the kid's area.  This is the page that tells you what is new.  
<p>
For starters, the image map (below) is new.  It was created to make navigating around the Kaleidoscapes website easier.  You can click on links, or pictures on the image map.  When you go to one of the pages with a corresponding picture, then you can always click on the corresponding picture to go back to the main image map.  You can also find your way back to the main page by clicking on the scope in 'Kaleid-o-scapes'.  You'll find some of the scopes twirling and some not, and they link you back to the main page.  
<p>
Also, an <a href="http://www.kaleidoscapes.com/calendarinfo.html">instruction page for the Home Educator's Calendar</a> was written up.
<p>
Finally, if you experience any problems navigating around Kaleidoscapes, please don't hesitate to let us know.

<CENTER><H1>Information, Command Instructions, and links to complement the Ohio Homeschool email discussion list</H1>
</CENTER><P>

<p>To <a href="mailto:oh-homeschool-request@kjsl.com">SUBSCRIBE</a> to the list, include the word SUBSCRIBE in the body of your message and email it to: <p>oh-homeschool-request@kjsl.com
<p>

This list is free and was created to allow Ohio homeschoolers a means of
sharing information that is beneficial to fellow Ohio homeschoolers.
Furthermore, I'd like to thank Javier Henderson for all his kind assistance.
This list would not be possible if not for him.  I am new to list managing,
but felt there was a need for one for Ohio homeschoolers.
<P>
The Ohio Homeschool list isn't moderated at this time.  So please be respectful of others, and no
flaming.  If such behaviour occurs that warrants moderation, then I will
solicit a volunteer for that task.   
<P>
Please do not use the email addresses of list members for any purpose other than list-related correspondence unless you have their written permission to do otherwise.
<P>
Thank you for your participation.

<CENTER>------COMMAND INSTRUCTIONS------
</CENTER><P>This mailing list processor supports both the Internet (listname)-request
interface and an emulation of BITNET LISTSERV (MXSERVER), providing a subset of
LISTSERV functions.
<P>
IMPORTANT!  Send commands to: oh-homeschool-request@kjsl.com (DO NOT SEND
THESE COMMANDS TO: oh-homeschool@kjsl.com -- that's the list, itself)
<P>
You don't need a subject (it'll be ignored).  In the body of your message
use the appropriate command:<P>
<pre>
    SUBSCRIBE           - to subscribe to a mailing list
    SIGNOFF             - to remove yourself from a mailing list
    REVIEW              - to get a list of subscribers
    QUERY               - to get the status of your entry on the list
    SET DIGEST        - to get the list in digest format
    SET NOMAIL          - to remain on the list but not receive mail
    SET MAIL            - to reverse the NOMAIL setting
    SET CONCEAL         - to conceal yourself from REVIEW listings
    SET NOCONCEAL       - to reverse the CONCEAL setting
    SET NOREPRO         - to prevent the list from sending you your own postings
    SET REPRO           - to reverse the NOREPRO setting
    LIST                - to get a list of mailing lists available on this host
    HELP                - to receive a help file
    QUIT                - to terminate processing (skipping signature, etc.)
</pre><P>
The syntax of these commands for use with the LISTSERV emulator (MXSERVER) is:
<P><pre>
    SUBSCRIBE oh-homeschool
    SIGNOFF oh-homeschool
    REVIEW oh-homeschool
    QUERY oh-homeschool

It is inbetween..."<br>I would really like to get a copy of thses songs, or contact the publisher to see about getting a copy. Anybody else remember them?<br>There were songs about clouds, water cycle too I think...

The discription of <br>: it from Eagle's Wings sounds great, but<br>: I would like to hear what someone who has<br>: actually used it liked or didn't like about it.<br>: Thanks!<p>We used it last year, and as we have not yet finished it, we will probably finish it this year.  It really is a great science program.  What I liked best about it was that EVERYTHING is laid out for you, lesson plans, what scripture you can tie into the lesson, and best of all exactly what the teacher needs to say and do.  The kids do an activity page every few days, but it is not just coloring...there are pop-ups, books within books, really neat kids stuff.  One page you lift up and all the planets (in the right order) dangle down from the page.  It is a great middle of the road curriculum.  If you don't have time for scavenging up everything for unit studies, but you find textbooks too dry, this is right in the middle.  And very reasonably priced when you consider you can use it for all your kids.  (They even have exercises to add to it for older kids to make it  more challenging.  I hope this all helps a bit!  God Bless - Nancy B.<br>

Here's a great site for both Mom and children. The site contains educational information on nutrition, particularly fruits and vegetables. Has lots of cute games and quizzes.  A free educational CD offer for educators (apply using your school name and title).  I sent for mine and should be getting it any day now. I'll let you know what it's like.  Have fun!<p>Charity

I did a seminar talk on the pros and cons of the high school chemistry curriculum available on the market today.  I reviewed the texts, lab supplies, lab texts of ABeka, Bob Jones and the worktext suppliers.  If anyone is interested in choosing an appropriate high school chemistry curriculum for their child(ren), leave a post here and I can get more specific.  If your child is interested in becoming a physician rather than a pet shop owner, you may want to base your choice of curriculum on their future plans.<br>-Barbara Page

Don't want to dumb down, but don't <br>want to overwhelm, either.  Suggestions for supplementation<br>would be really welcome.  Also, disirability of lab<br>work, availability of lab supplies at reasonable cost<br>would be great info to have.<br>Thanks!<br>Lois<p>

: ABeka Chemistry this year, one who will most likely
: have no trouble another who is more interested in the 
: &quot;pet shop&quot; route.  Don't want to dumb down, but don't 
: want to overwhelm, either.  Suggestions for supplementation
: would be really welcome.  Also, disirability of lab
: work, availability of lab supplies at reasonable cost
: would be great info to have.
: Thanks!

Posted by <a href="mailto:pageclan@msn.com">Barbara Butterfly Page</a> on August 11, 1996 at 05:02:25:<p>
Well, here it is.  The long, drawn-out tale of our science adventures:<br>About five years ago, we were walking along a nature trail near our home and saw some<br>pretty black, white and yellow-striped caterpillars on the milkweed plants.  Since I had<br>raised the caterpillars as a child, I knew that I could take them home, keep feeding them<br>milkweed and they would grow up to be beautiful monarch butterflies.  The entomology<br>'itch' attached itself to my children, especially the 5-year-old at that time.  We continued<br>our study and research into the literature available on Monarch butterflies.  We came upon<br>an issue of National Geographic where Fred Urquardt discovered the wintering grounds of<br>the migratory Monarch in the mountains of Mexico.  We saw that he followed the<br>migration of the butterflies by attaching tags to their wings.  "Hey," I reasoned, "Why<br>don't we give Fred a call and see if we can tag butterflies, too?"  So yes, I called<br>information in Toronto, Canada and asked for the home phone number of Fred Urquardt<br>and they gave it to me!  It was too easy.  Fred, was not tagging butterflies anymore.  He<br>retired from the project but gave me the name of O.R. Taylor at Kansas University who<br>was tagging Monarchs.  We contacted O.R. Taylor and began participating by subscribing<br>to the publications of Monarch Watch.  The following years we began tagging the<br>Monarchs that we raised.  My entomology-child has done every science project since our<br>first caterpillar raising experience on some aspect of Monarch Butterflies.  Here is where<br>the amazing part happens:  Our family purchased the computer in December and got<br>online.  This is when I emailed O.R. (Chip) Taylor and asked whether he needed or<br>wanted summer intern help from school children.  I finally did admit that we were<br>homeschoolers and that my children were the only ones that wanted to participate.  He<br>wrote back saying that he never tried it before but that he was willing to have us come out<br>to Kansas in July to help him in his research!!!!!!  We saved, we sold candy bars and<br>Tupperware, found baby-sitters for the four and two-year-olds and off we went on our<br>nine day adventure, along with all our camping stuff to Lawrence, Kansas.  Let me tell you<br>that the road trip wasn't that thrilling.  Driving from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania to Lawrence,<br>Kansas was educational at the most.  Did you know that Effingham, Illinois is exactly half<br>way between Pittsburgh and Lawrence?  But when we got there, it was the thrill of a<br>lifetime.  Chip had an entire teaching lab set up for us to 'work in.'  Here are the things that<br>my four boys and myself got to do:  strip milkweed seeds from their pods,  count and<br>weigh the seeds, construct caterpillar rearing cages, pack caterpillar rearing kits, inventory<br>tagging adhesive (2000 bottles!),  wash and disinfect butterfly rearing equipment, sweep<br>the floor, construct butterfly emergence chambers, collate butterfly rearing instructions,<br>repair and patch the biohouse/research facility (it looked like a greenhouse), transplant<br>food plants to the biohouse for butterflies and bumble bees,  apply fertilizer to about 500<br>hundred tropical milkweed plants, 'thresh' milkweed seeds and pods (you should have seen<br>the fuzz flying) outside.  Maybe someone else reading this list would be yawning by now,<br>but to me, this was the fulfilling of one of my childhood dreams...to actually assist a real<br>researcher in discovering new and amazing facts about one of God's amazing creatures. <br>We camped in the backyard of a homeschooling family in Perry, Kansas: Barb Michener. <br>We even found their names and phone number on-line after a search for Kansas<br>Homeschooling Support Groups!  She didn't even know her name was listed anywhere,<br>since she says she has a fear of computers.  They were wonderful hosts.  The time that we<br>were not 'working' in the lab for Chip, we toured the campus art and natural history<br>museum.  We also toured different parts of the Entomology Department and met an<br>Entomology professor with nine children and also homeschooled.  We practically had the<br>run of the campus since everyone was on summer break.  We met the graduate students<br>who were happy to explain what they were doing with the Monarch Butterflies.  We will<br>never forget this field trip.<br>-Barbara Page

Hi Barbara!<p>That sounds like it was an awesome trip!  Thanks for recording and sharing the adventure with us!  I remember reading about the Monarch migration in the N.G.   And a couple of years ago, our area was fairly populated with Monarchs during the migration.  But one day was particularly memorable.  It was very, very windy, and many Monarchs were just kind of blowing past our house.  It was the most unusual sight I've ever seen!  <p>I am interested in teaching my kids more about the Monarchs.  I hope this thread will really progress. :-)<p>I tried to reach the Monarch Watch site, but I guess their server is down or having technical problems.<p>Anyow, thanks for the wonderfully inspiring account of your experience.<p>Cindy

Hi everybody!<p>Our cat, Missy, just had a kitten (yes, just one...this was her first ever, and I guess she wanted to step into motherhood carefully <grin>).  Anyhow, we had a boy cat, Thomas, who is (sadly) no longer with us.  But the kids wondered how long a cat is pregnant before she has kittens (or in this case, a kitten), because they are curious if Thomas could have possibly fathered the kitten before his untimely departure. <p>Thanks!!<br>Cindy<p>

My absense from the Science Message Board has been conspicuous.  But my four boys and myself have just returned from the 'field trip of a lifetime'.  We drove from Pittsburgh, PA to Lawrence, KS to assist Dr. O.R. Taylor in his studies of the migration and life cycle of the Monarch Butterfly (Danius plexipus).  I don't want to bore everyone here with the details, e-mail if you want the whole story.  The point I would like to make is this:  follow the interests of your children,  make phone calls to people you have never met and you may end up participating in something tremendously exciting and (cough-cough) educational.  I raised monarch caterpillars as a child and so this trip was especially thrilling for me.<br>-Barbara Page

I'm faced with having to teach biology for my high school aged daughter, this school year. She has always hated science, and especially dreads biology. She hates hands-on projects, dissection, microscopes, and such. But she loves nature, ecology, and related things. I'd gladly write a biology course for her, more addapted to her interests, if I had some idea of how to go about it. Most of the "write your own curriculum" books are for kindergarten through 8th grade. Does anyone have any suggestions of what I read to give me some direction? Right now I have several different biology texts that we have invested in, that my daughter has resoundingly rejected as totally discusting.

: Here is the URL to a frog dissection on-line (including interactive quizzes)!  To get the maximum benefit, it requires a QuickTime viewer (I think they have a link to that site if you don't aleady have a QT viewer), and a lot of patience--because each QT movie takes awhile to download.

<br>These aren't Internet links, but they're great resources.  Contact your state wildlife, water conservaton, or forestry agencies.  There are books available with lesson lans adaptableto any age group called Projects WET, Wild, and Learning Tree.  They are about wildlife, water and forests, obviously, and have all sorts of great ideas.  they are available free or at cost.  If you can find your local contact, let me know and I'll look it up for you.  jkcook<br>: I need some lesson plans/links to nature:  birds, animals, animal habitats,nature studies, etc.  Has anyone found any good ones?<p>

Posted by <a href="mailto:double@bright.net">Linda Riordan</a> on July 16, 1996 at 07:47:37:<p>
I thought I'd post a neat project our family has completed.  Two years ago this fall, when our son was seven, we decided to conduct a landfill experiment in the backyard.  My son and I had read a few articles on recycling and landfills.  It was early November and the garden (a very small garden) was harvested.  In the middle of the garden area my husband dug a hole 18 inches square and 18 inches deep.  As we are in Ohio, he said we would be below the frost line and our landfill items would not be preserved by freezing.  We put a piece of what looked like plastic chicken coop wire in the bottom of the hole.  This would help us to find the bottom of the hole the next year, yet would let all water pass through and not hinder the experiment.  We then went through the house and collected items to put in.  Then, with video camera in hand, we made a big production of putting all this into the hole.  Items were placed in a single layer and my son drew a map of the location of each item.  We threw a bunch of<br>leaves into the hole, and my husband filled it all in.  We then took measurements from the corners of the hole to the edges of the garden so we would know exactly where to dig the following year.  While we waited for the decomposers to do their work, my son began the job of taking a survey.  We made a form which listed all items.  He then asked people to either take his survey verbally or fill out the form for him.  There were only two questions on the form, "Do you believe the item will still be there in a year?  And if so, what condition will the item be in?"  What an incredible variety of responses!  This past November, we excavated the landfill within three days of when we first put it in.  We had great fun excavating, and we were stunned at what we found - and what we didn't find!  It was really exciting.  I'll tell you just this much - our small backyard landfill was very different from a huge public landfill.  I realize there is so much more that could be done with this type of experiment than we<br>did.  The surveys could be charted, percentages computed, lots more research, etc.  But even though we just did some reading and the landfill itself, it was really neat!  To close, I'll just mention some of the items we chose to put in.  In retrospect, I wish we would have had less plastic and a few more unusual items.  Some of our list - a telephone book, a raw egg, a white sock, plastic of different types, a can, a penny, a carrot, an apple, a piece of bread inside a zip-lock bag, a box, and more!  Give it a try - it's way cool!

Give it a try - it's way cool!

Great idea. Thanks for posting. I've heard of something similiar being done in connection with a archaeological study. A  family buried pieces of broken pottery. The child was required  to dig them up and piece the pottery back together, determine its useage, make conclusions about the culture, etc.  Also, I know of a family who did this for a unit on dinosaurs. They buried the bones of a whole chicken (saved from their dinner) and the child had to dig it up, piece it together, identify the animal, etc.  Happy Homeschooling to you!  Charity Lovelace<p><br>

   I have at least a dozen of the more popular science experiment books, but I think I've just found the most exciting--"Turning Kids on to Science in the Home" by Dr. Tik Liem (I bought mine through Tobin's Lab--they have a web site but I don't have the address--e-mailed at Mike@Tobinlab.com)<br>  The focus is on discrepant events--that is, what you think is going to happen doesn't.  Example-tape 2 cone cups together and place at a bottom of a ramp (they tell you how to do it) and the cones appear to roll up the ramp.<br>  You can write directly for a listing of the various books (some Tobin's doesn't carry) Science Inquiry Enterprises, 14358 Village View Ln, Chiino Hills CA 91790

I have an article entitled Preventing Science Slip-ups I wrote for The National Homeschool Journal's Sept. 95 issue. I would be glad to e-mail it to anyone who thinks it may be of help.  Science is THE favorite topic at our homeschool.  The article contains tips on how to prevent botched science experiments and what to do should one of your science endeavors flop.  Just e-mail me and I'll be glad to forward the article to you by e-mail.  I cannot send to Mac computers. Sorry. You will need to have a microsoft works compatible word processing program to open the file.  Blessings, Charity Lovelace

We always look for the reasons behind any slip-ups and try to learn from them.  My 12-yr-old had the experience of using an analytical balance while we were at Kansas University and he thought he was messing up everytime that he weighed something because the weight came out different everytime.  This turned into a great opportunity to discuss precision and accuracy and the averaging of a sample of weights. (The balance was accurate to the 1000ths place!)<br>-Barb Page<br>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
First, you may want to print out these instructions, although once you go through the steps you'll see it is very simple to add events to the public Home Educators Calendar.<p>

Go to the calendar, then click on "Add Item".  If this is your first time, then click on "Register For An Account".  
<p>
Type in the requested information (User Name, Password, Password Again, First Name, Last Name, Email), then click on "Submit Information".
<p>
Then click on "Return to Logon Screen" and type in your new username and password.  Make sure you write them down somewhere and don't lose them, because we have no way of finding out what password you choose for yourself.
Then click "Logon To The System" and you're all set to fill in the information for an event you'd like to add.  Don't forget to check the month, day, and time before you click on "Add Item".
<p>
After you register, any time you want to come back and add more items, just go directly to "Logon To The System" and type in your username and password.
See?  Simple. 
<p>
Now go <a href="http://www.kaleidoscapes.com/cgi-bin/Calendar_3.0/calendar.cgi">add some events to the calendar</a> that would interest home educators.<p>
Thanks!!!

I am teaching Microbilogy to a small group of Jr/Sr High homeschooling students during our Support Group's Friday Enrichment Classes.  Here is a sight that I have enjoyed.  It changes every week.  It also contains a column on applying mathematics to different areas of your life.  This section would be appropriate for a Jr/Sr High level student to help make the subject of mathematics a little more relevant to what the study of math.  I also enjoy the section on microbiology.

Hi Folks,<p>This message board has finally been updated!  I took off a huge chunk of messages from the lower half of the page and placed them on an Old Science Message Board to make this one a bit faster to load into your browsers.

Sometimes dragging out all the equipment for one or a set of experiments can be daunting, especially if you feel overwhelmed by the prospect of doing it at least once a week.  We started a homeschooling cooperative in the fall of 95 where one mother teaches a class to one group of children while another mother teaches a class to another group of children.  My friend Jan is an expert in Shakespeare (GAG) while I taught the children basic dissection skills.  This worked out well especially when we found another mother who was willing to watch the babies while her children took the Shakespeare and Dissection class.  If you find science experiments a handful, cooperative teaching arrangements with another experienced mother may be the answer for you.

Some of the posts have gotten eaten by the computer, but someone wrote me and asked how to tie in science with their study of the American Revolution.  Here are some ideas:<p>Unit Studies sound like so much fun!  If I had to design one to include <br>science and connect it to the American Revolution, I might include researching <br>the topic of medicinal leaches, the discovery of the smallpox vaccine, why <br>gunpowder works, did George Washington really have wooden teeth, recreate some <br>of Benjamin Franklin's experiments, etc.<p>I have my book out called "The Timetables of History".  Here are all the <br>scientific discoveries listed for the years 1774-1778:<br>J.G. Gahn isolates manganese 1774<br>John Wilkinson's boring mill to facilitate manufacture of cylinders for steam <br>engine 1774<br>Pierre-Simon Girard invents water turbine 1775<br>James Watt perfects steam engine 1775<br>Joseph Priestly discovers hydrochloric and sulfuric acids 1775<br>Cook's first voyage to the Pacific 1776<br>David Bushell invents torpedo 1777 (I hope he was on our side!)<br>Lavoisier discovers oxygen 1777<br>James Cook discovers Hawaii 1778<br>Smeaton experiments with diving bell 1778<p>I hope I helped.<p>Barbara Page<br>

Thanks Barbara! Our unit study wasn't so much designed as evolved (with direction).  David Bushell designed the first combat submarine and torpedo for the Americans during the Revolutionary War.  It didn't do any damage, but it did scare the British into moving their fleet!  We have some drawing of his submarine and we are going to try to make a model and find out how subs work.<p>Thanks again!<br>Sharon

I am desperately searching for certain titles in the hardback series "Great Illustrated Classics."  I have some 20 titles, but discovered they have just gone out of print.  If you have any information, (or books you'd like to sell!), please help.  My six-year-old adores these, and I have several more children who probably will adore them as well!

: The following is the opening from the Meditations of Marcus Aurelius Antoninus.  (Philosopher and Emperor of Rome)  Although a Stoic, his philosophy came closer than many others to the New Testament.

: 	FROM my grandfather Verus I learned good morals and the government of my temper.
: 	From the reputation and remembrance of my father, modesty and a manly character.
: 	From my mother, piety and beneficence, and abstinence, not only from evil deeds, but even from evil thoughts; and further, simplicity in my way of living, far removed from the habits of the rich.
: 	From my great-grandfather, not to have frequented public schools, and to have had good teachers at home, and to know that on such things a man should spend liberally.
: 	From my governor,... I learned endurance of labour, and to want little, and to work with my own hands, and not to meddle with other people's affairs, and not to be ready to listen to slander.

: 	This was written in 175 AD.  What a joy it would be to see my children learn such as this.  What teachers in the public schools would dare to teach such &quot;controversial&quot; material.   And what a privilege it is that we can choose such literature for our children to study.  This is just a booster to all the home schoolers out there.  Keep to the path, for while it is difficult, it is leading ever in the right direction.

: 	I am not one to actually sit down and read ancient Roman literature, but I might be in the future.  We just purchased a CD-ROM with over 3,500 literary works.  (Entire works like The King James Bible, Great Expectations,  Plato's Republic, and so much more!)  All of this for just under thirty dollars.

We have been homeschooling our two sons (ages 5 and 7) since <br>August.  This decision came about partly from our own interest<br>and partly because the school was finding it impossible <br>to meet the needs of my older son, who was tested and <br>found to be highly gifted when he started kindergarten.<br>They actually got to a point where they suggested homeschooling<br>because his learning in certain areas had progressed to a point<br>that was beyond even the grade 8 level (the top grade in<br>the school) and he was beginning to experience constant<br>headaches and outbursts stemming from his frustrations. <br>He says he enjoys homeschooling much more than regular<br>school but I find I'm having trouble teaching him to "try<br>his best" when he does an assignment.  I feel this is in<br>part because of his school experience where the teacher's<br>standards (in terms of the actual work produced) where incredibly<br>low.  He has learned to do a bare minimum and not a inch more.<br>I have tried talking to him about self motivation and the<br>feeling of satisfaction you get from a job well done but his<br>lack of real effort is becoming a weekly battle.  He makes<br>careless errors and refuses to double-check his work.  I've tried<br>to move in directions that I know he has a real interest in, such as<br>historical events and the lives of famous individuals (Louis Braille, Amelia Earhart, etc.)<br>but even then it seems that although he is verbal about<br>his interest and he flies through the actual biographies he doesn't <br>seem inspired to take his interest further on his<br>own.  Also, whenever I give him any creative writing assignments<br>(even in relation to his interests) I get the minimum amount and<br>little imagination.  Does anyone have any suggestions on how I can<br>generate a little more self-motivation and effort? I  tell<br>both boys that I don't expect perfection, but I do expect them to<br>try their best. My younger son is much more self-motivated and sets goals<br>for himself to achieve.  My older son does try hard if he's competing<br>with his brother, or trying to get to a higher level in a computer<br>program (educational or recreational), but in terms of the little amount of work <br>I actual assign - he just seems lazy. I praise him when he produces work where I know he has made<br>a real effort in, and when he does try, he admits that he feels really good.<br>Has anyone else experienced this type of underachievement and what did<br>you do to change it? <br>Thanks

Are you using a curriculum?  When we first started homeschooling, we tried not using a curriculum.  But I soon found out that my son would rather play all day than do anything remotely educational.  He was bored and I had other children to deal with and could not spend a lot of time planning lessons.  So we finally bought the A Beka curriculum and it's worked really well since then.<p>My husband was also one of these kind of boys and he says they need structure.  If you're not using a curriculum, you need to have a set amount of work he should do each day before he can do anything else.  <p>My son has to do his work before he can go out to play.  And if he doesn't get his work done that day, he has to do it the next day along with that day's work.  The work keeps piling up in this way until he gets it done.  He's had a few times where he's had to do 2 days work in one day and even a few Saturdays where he couldn't play with the other children because he was finishing up work from the week.  Believe me, it only takes once or twice before he realizes he'd rather do his work than miss out on playing with his friends.<p>Another thing we do is he has to correct any mistakes before we move on to the next thing.  He hates making mistakes, but he hates having to correct his problems more.  I think school creates this problem because they just mark something wrong and just go on.  My position is that if you got something wrong, you need to correct it so that you won't make the same mistake again.  I get a lot of complaining about this, but he's beginning to work more carefully so he'll get it right the first time and not have to do the problem again.<p>I have a 6-yr-old daughter who has never been in school and she doesn't give me near as much grief.  I only wish I had known about homeschooling before I sent my son to school.  But I'm doing my best to overcome these "attitudes" he learned in school and gradually I am seeing positive results.<p>Hang in there.  It *will* get better.<p>Linda

This is a problem that many of us with highly gifted children experience.  What really makes it tough is that there are so many books about gifted children being so driven.  Our daughter who is 6 1/2, was only in school for a couple months.  We had her already in one grade beyond her age, and the teacher said that she didn't know what she could teach her because everything she taught she either already knew or learned without repetition.  Although we knew she was gifted, we weren't sure how much or how advanced she was academically, so had her tested.  That sealed the homeschooling decision for us.  There is really nothing in our area that would begin to meet her needs.  Last year, after we took her out of school, we attempted to finish out the year.  Our daughter was not motivated, did not seem to work up to her ability, etc.  So finally, I just said we were quitting for the rest of the year.  When we started this year, I laid out a very specific amount of work to be done and specific times that it needed to be done during.  I also said to myself that I need to constantly remember her age.  There are days that the writing, math, etc. are phenomenal, and other days that while they are still quite a bit above her grade level, she just isn't as motivated.  I do grade pretty specifically, but again, it is hard.  Do you grade on what you think their ability is, how much progress they are making, or how they rate compared to children in the grade level that they are working at?  The best thing I can recommend is to take a break for several months.  That seemed to help our daughter.  The other thing we did was quit providing so many "opportunities" for her.  We had let her take classes in everything-art, ballet, gymnastics, etc.  We saw that she always had an initial interest, but no follow through.  We quit everything except piano.  We have let her know that when she shows an interest for an extended length of time in an area and does as much to develop her ability at home, then we will provide the classes for her.  So far, she has only asked to take gymnastics again (summer Olympics was the motivation), but that lasted only a few weeks.  She will have to learn to be self motivated for these extracurricular activities from now on.  My husband also says that he believes children such as these, who never have to struggle to learn, need to experience failure to appreciate their abilities.  I have noticed that since I have decided that after one notice for things such as studying for spelling tests, getting up in the AM, etc., I quit reminding, and let her learn the consequences.  If she does not get ready for "school" in time, I have told her that we will add that day to the end of the year and that really has worked.  If she doesn't do as well on a spelling test from not studying, she gets very upset and we see a big improvement the next few weeks.  We certainly don't begin to have the answers.  I hope that this helps.

Suzy, you just described my entire schooling experience.  I can relate to this attitude.

After ten plus years of homeschooling my five children I am currently enrolled in a distance education program myself.  I am enrolled in the Educational Technology Leadership Program at the George Washington University in Washington, D.C. where I intend to obtain my Master's Degree and apply my learning to supporting home education for students of all ages.  All of the course work for the ETL program is conducted via internet listservs and videotape for most, but not all courses.<p>As part of my course work in one of my classes I am reviewing this web site!  Most of the coursework so far has dealt with University level distance learning and there has been a *noticable* skepticism of the usefulness of distance learning for elementary or secondary school-age students.  (I have often been the lone voice in support of home education.)  I would like to invite visitors of this websit (readers of this post) to email me with information on any links that would illustrate how the web presents new opportunites for learning/instruction for elementary and secondary age home educated students.  Including *links* that have been especially helpful in instruction of your home educated students would be most appreciated.  What I hope to do is totally amaze my professors and the other nay-sayers in my courses thus far, with the awesome potential of distance learning for students of ANY AGE and drive home the fact that distance education in any form is not just for adult learners.<p>Please email me at aweaver@erols.com with any suggestions.  This site will most likely be visited by several of my classmates and professor when I complete my review, and I am certain that they will be inspired by it's content as I have been.  Well done!

 We found inour support group last year that manu of the moms were getting depleted, and not built up. We therefore planned a concert with Deb & Dee jackosn ( since married) who homeschool their children in Wellington, Ohio and Seattle Washington. They have sung together for many years, write songs and minister to families and homeschoolers especially. Please join us in Galion, Ohio at 7 p.m. at Gospel Baptist Church for this uplifting time. The songs include "My ministry is You", "Daddy, Daddy ( you are still the key)", "Hearts Need a Place to call Home" and many others in a light and easy delivery.<br>For further information, please contact me at the email address above, and pleaase help us spread the news to support groups around the area. Thanks.

If you have a Christian homeschooling web site please register it with the 3 major Christian search engines.  We need to network with other Christians and this is a great way to do it!  (There is nothing wrong with registering your sites with the regular search engines but you really should get your Christian sites more available to the Christian net surfers!

Hi Folks!<p>This is just a friendly reminder that my offer of free spelling lessons expires next Saturday.  ( Nov. 30/96 )<p>My website is located in the Global Village Mall. Because it is relatively brand new on the internet, GVM is experimenting with new technology and that necessitates that it be offline for brief periods of time. The brief periods of time usually occur on weekends. Therefore, if you try to visit my website this weekend, you might experience difficulty. It is much better if you visit Mondays to Fridays. Of course, I will honor any requests for FREE lessons after the expiry date. ( at least for a few days )<p>Scroll down to:   PICKLE LEE PRODUCTIONS<p>Click on the RED lettering!!<p><br>Well, Folks!<br>Have a great weekend!<br>Barry Ross    :-)<p><br>

Hi folks,<p>My apologies to anyone who has experienced problems posting today.  The message boards will be going through some technical maintenance from the server end this weekend so expect a little bumpiness (but feel free to continue to post if the posts go through).  Also, I anticipate some down time as I give the whole site a graphical and navigational make-over (to make navigating around Kaleidoscapes easier and more pleasing to the eyes).<p>Sorry for the inconvenience, but there's always work to be done on a progressive website.  :-)<p>Thanks for your patience...<br>Cindy

I tried to post a message to "Abeka or Cornerstone". I would finish my message and push the "finish" button and then sit and sit and wait and wait while nothing happens, I had to abort each time.  And now I see it shows I left a message but my message isn't there.  Is anyone else having this problem?  Am I doing something wrong?  Do I just have to wait a long, long, long time for the message to post? Help! My appologies to C.M. who posted ABeka or Cornerstone.

The reason we are doing this is because she was diagnosed as diabetic this past year and<br>the closest English school is over an hour's drive away with a driver who doesn't speak English or know what to do with a diabetic child, and the mother just<br>had their third baby!  Find out what the legal situation is, bathe it in prayer, and see what the Lord says about it.  Hope this helps.<br>Sarah

Half cracked<br>: me up and the other half broke my heart...  What to do?<p>I can understand your concern.  Last year I helped homeschool my great-niece, who is from a broken home in custody of my niece.  She is distractible and a late bloomer, so was doing terribly in school.  She also had many emotional problems.  At the time I helped with her, there was not a defined h.s. law in MI, but as of 07/96, there is, and it specifies that the child must be h.s.'d in their own home.  So I'm not doing this any more.  I still help out with her occasionally. Even last year, I made it clear to her mother that she was the one who should be doing this, and that she should be working with her daughter the most.  I also sent home things for her to do with her daughter.  I told her books to read to her, etc.  It was a big job, planning for her, as well as my own 4.  I taught her one day a week, my girlfriend had her 2 days a week, her grama had her 1 day.  It's not the same as homeschooling, but maybe it's next best.  This year, she and her mother have moved in with my sister-in-law (the grandma). Her mother and grandmother are schooling her, she takes a science class at my girlfriends, and I have her over now and then for certain activities.  She goes to her father's every other weekend and he takes her to museums, and reads to her.  It isn't ideal, but it's better than what was happening in public school.  You are the only one who can decide if you are able to take this on.  I know how your heart goes out to little ones, and I also understand how frustrating it is to see children who long, desire and wish to be homeschooled, but their parents just aren't interested.  All the best, whichever you decide.  (Definitely find out if it's legal before you decide anything)

: : I am currently homeschooling my 6 yo son and having a
: : fairly good time of it all.  One of my sisters also
: : homeschools her 13yo and there are several other families
: : in our area.  Now my 11yo niece has asked, begged and
: : pleaded me to homeschool her as well.  Her mother is 
: : not opposed to the idea but won't consider taking on the
: : task herself.  Says she isn't patient enough...
: : Has anyone ever homeschooled a child that is not their 
: : own and does not live them?  I'm not completely sold on 
: : the plan, being a little nervous.  But I am considering
: : trying it out.
: : At first I tried to discourage her and told her to write
: : down 10 reasons she wanted to homeschool.  Half cracked
: : me up and the other half broke my heart...  What to do?

: I can understand your concern.  Last year I helped homeschool my great-niece, who is from a broken home in custody of my niece.  She is distractible and a late bloomer, so was doing terribly in school.  She also had many emotional problems.  At the time I helped with her, there was not a defined h.s. law in MI, but as of 07/96, there is, and it specifies that the child must be h.s.'d in their own home.  So I'm not doing this any more.  I still help out with her occasionally. Even last year, I made it clear to her mother that she was the one who should be doing this, and that she should be working with her daughter the most.  I also sent home things for her to do with her daughter.  I told her books to read to her, etc.  It was a big job, planning for her, as well as my own 4.  I taught her one day a week, my girlfriend had her 2 days a week, her grama had her 1 day.  It's not the same as homeschooling, but maybe it's next best.  This year, she and her mother have moved in with my sister-in-law (the grandma). Her mother and grandmother are schooling her, she takes a science class at my girlfriends, and I have her over now and then for certain activities.  She goes to her father's every other weekend and he takes her to museums, and reads to her.  It isn't ideal, but it's better than what was happening in public school.

Jennifer,<p>While there is no specific wording in the regulations<br>for Maryland that I can see, the homeschooling laws in<br>Maryland are such that parents are pretty much at the<br>superintendent's mercy when it comes to approval.  Since<br>the superintendent may review the child's work up to three<br>times per year (usually only twice), it might be awkward<br>for the parents to show up for these reviews and not the<br>child's actual teacher.  <p>For the complete scoop on Maryland, it is best to consult<br>with someone who may have already heard of someone<br>trying this, either successfully or unsuccessfully.  So<br>try emailing Manfred Smith at homebase@erols.com <br>He's the head of the MD Home Education Asso. and he will<br>be happy to answer any questions you have.  Tell him<br>I sent you!<p>Kathleen

Posted by <a href="mailto:mlvoc@ix.netcom.com">Mary Lynn</a> on November 20, 1996 at 19:31:40:<p>
My little boy is 6 years old. He went to preschool<br>at 4yrs and started biting his fingernails and<br>acting like quite a different little boy.<br>But I thought "well he has to go to<br>kindergarten so he'll just have to tuff it out."<br>Which he did. Then he started K and<br>after 3 mos. of fingernail biting and stomach<br>aches(he even threw up alot) I decided it just was'nt right.<br>So I took him out. The fingernail biting<br>and the stomach aches stopped almost immediately.<br> I had been talking to some people about<br> homeschooling andit sounded like the answer.<br>Now I'm beginning to think I made a<br>mistake. He doesn't say he wants to go to <br>school but he just doesn't seem interested<br>in doing anything(except goofing around). I've tried many things<br>to make things fun and unusual. Then I<br>tried a more classical approach and<br>all I get is frustrated. He just moans <br>at any suggestion I come up with. Am<br>I being too permissive with him. I<br>don't want him to hate learning things.<br>I just don't know what to do. He's an only <br>child and he says he wants someone to<br>learn with. And I must admit he seems <br>more interested in things when the<br>neighbor kids are around. I'm really<br>in a state. I feel like giving up and sending <br>him to school. But I get sick to my stomach<br>every time I think about that.<br>Is it possible to have a child that just<br>isn't cut out for homeschooling. Or maybe<br>I'm just not cut out for it.<br>Please help if you can.<br>Thanks

I have decided to follow some advice that I have heard from alot of poeple and read in books. I am giving my children a chance to deschool. I allowed my oldest son(12), the first year to explore those things that interested him. He had time to read, work on the computor, write in a journal, do community service, and hang out with the friends. My gut told me that he needed some time to recover from his public school experience. This year he is very interested in studying in a more structured way. He is reading 300 page books, doing pre-Algebra with great excitement. I have come to realize that I need to do the same thing with his brothers (7 & 8). We are very "unstructured", but I know that they are learning so much. They have a natural desire to learn, especially when I sit back and let them pursue their interests. Opposed to forcing worksheets and text books at them. Some afternoons we go to the library, pick out a book,  and then spend the rest of the afternoon on the couch reading the book. My 7 year old has started writing a book that he says he would like to publish. He just went to the computer one day and opened his own document, named it, and then started writing. When he doesn't know how to spell a word, he'll ask someone to spell the word for him. Two weeks ago, we went out into the forest to collect acorns, birch bark, moss, twigs, pebble; etc.. They spent two weeks playing with all of the nature items in a box, creating nature scenes. They made tepees, canoes, mountain scenes, river scenes. What a neat way to learn about the world. I also have to think about how much they learned on their own or with the help of me and my husband before they went to "school". We were very unstructured in the first five years of their lives. Why do we think that we have to get "structured" just because they turn 5. My 8 year old son was "sick to his stomach" every morning and every evening. My worst day of homeschooling doesn't even begin to compare to the best public school day. Day after day forcing them out through the door, having know idea or controll over what happened in their lives for 6 hours every day. Guess what . . . no more stomach aches. Hang in there!! You are doing a great thing for your son. Give yourself a year, I know that I can't do too much damage in a year. If your not pleased with your sons progress   after that time, then think about an alternative. If you want to e-mail me, feel free...  W_Dyer@nemaine.com     Good Luck!!!!

Or maybe<br>: I'm just not cut out for it.<br>: Please help if you can.<br>: Thanks <p>Mary Lynn,  My heart goes out to you.  What a wonderful mother; you saw your child was unhappy and when you found an option (homeschooling)that looked like it would help him, you went for it.  Now you are discouraged and frustrated.  Are you aware there are many types of homeschools and many types of homeschoolers out there?  As his mother, you need to decide what is best for your child, and sometimes you can only learn this thru trial and error.  May I suggest you read Raymond and Dorothy Moore's Book, "Better Late Than EArly", and also think about why your son isn't interested.  He obviously was not happy with structured learning and the setting at school, evidenced by his symptoms, nailbiting and stomach upsets.  Maybe Thomas Armstrong's books would be helpful to you in identifying your child's learning style.  He wrote "In Their Own Way; Discovering and Encouraging Your Child's Personal Learning Styles."  Also "7 Kinds of Smart; Identifying and Developing Your Many Intelligences."  There is also a video available about Multiple Intelligences from him, but it is $79.50 plus $5.00 S & H from 1-800-453-7561.  For his website:  http://www.nprinc.com.  I got the books at the library! :) Many homeschoolers, myself included, have started out with a structured program, only to find that it just doesn't work.  Why not?  If your child has been in school already (2 of mine were, for 6 and 4 years) they may be rebelling against a copycat edition of what they have already learned to hate. You may need to think about deschooling, meaning your child needs some time to do what he enjoys.  That may include lost of time spent reading (you reading to him), education videos that he has helped choose. Activities with a homeschool group may fill his need for "someone to do things with".  Invite neighbor kids over for "parties"; t-shirt painting parties, cookie decorating parties, and you may use your imagination to make these activities more educational as time goes on, w/o the structured emphasis; examples; cut out cookies shaped like the states, with their official abbreviations written on with tubes of frosting.  Seasonal parties may be helpful; get some craft books from the library, choose a few interesting ideas, and set up for some fun.  Attend library programs, museum programs, as you do these "fun" activites together an interest may be sparked that you can follow up with books, games, tapes, etc.  Many homeschoolers have found that following the children's interests leads to true internalization of the material, and often sparks an interest that may linger for a long time.  If you are interested in communicating more on this subject, feel free to e-mail me with questions.  I found the formula true; I was told it would take 6 weeks to 6 months for every year my child was in public school, to deschool him.  That is, for him to be back to being happy, interested in learning, etc.  May I also mention that he is now a certified auto technician working in a dealership, at only 17, attending vo-tech classes, and very happy.  He, by the way, is very definitely a kinesthetic/spatial learner.  He was like a square peg in a round hole in school, where so much of the learning is linguistic, or logical-mathematical.  At home, with hands-on projects, and as he grew, apprenticeships, mentorships, and volunteer work he blossomed.  I highly recommend reading Home Ed. Magazine.  e-mail home-edu@televar.com or call 800-236-3278 for info.  Good luck, and all the best to you as you follow your heart in meeting your child's needs.  Warmly, Marsha

: Mary Lynn,  My heart goes out to you.  What a wonderful mother; you saw your child was unhappy and when you found an option (homeschooling)that looked like it would help him, you went for it.  Now you are discouraged and frustrated.  Are you aware there are many types of homeschools and many types of homeschoolers out there?  As his mother, you need to decide what is best for your child, and sometimes you can only learn this thru trial and error.  May I suggest you read Raymond and Dorothy Moore's Book, &quot;Better Late Than EArly&quot;, and also think about why your son isn't interested.  He obviously was not happy with structured learning and the setting at school, evidenced by his symptoms, nailbiting and stomach upsets.  Maybe Thomas Armstrong's books would be helpful to you in identifying your child's learning style.  He wrote &quot;In Their Own Way; Discovering and Encouraging Your Child's Personal Learning Styles.&quot;  Also &quot;7 Kinds of Smart; Identifying and Developing Your Many Intelligences.&quot;  There is also a video available about Multiple Intelligences from him, but it is $79.50 plus $5.00 S & H from 1-800-453-7561.  For his website:  http://www.nprinc.com.  I got the books at the library! :) Many homeschoolers, myself included, have started out with a structured program, only to find that it just doesn't work.  Why not?  If your child has been in school already (2 of mine were, for 6 and 4 years) they may be rebelling against a copycat edition of what they have already learned to hate. You may need to think about deschooling, meaning your child needs some time to do what he enjoys.  That may include lost of time spent reading (you reading to him), education videos that he has helped choose. Activities with a homeschool group may fill his need for &quot;someone to do things with&quot;.  Invite neighbor kids over for &quot;parties&quot;; t-shirt painting parties, cookie decorating parties, and you may use your imagination to make these activities more educational as time goes on, w/o the structured emphasis; examples; cut out cookies shaped like the states, with their official abbreviations written on with tubes of frosting.  Seasonal parties may be helpful; get some craft books from the library, choose a few interesting ideas, and set up for some fun.  Attend library programs, museum programs, as you do these &quot;fun&quot; activites together an interest may be sparked that you can follow up with books, games, tapes, etc.  Many homeschoolers have found that following the children's interests leads to true internalization of the material, and often sparks an interest that may linger for a long time.  If you are interested in communicating more on this subject, feel free to e-mail me with questions.  I found the formula true; I was told it would take 6 weeks to 6 months for every year my child was in public school, to deschool him.  That is, for him to be back to being happy, interested in learning, etc.  May I also mention that he is now a certified auto technician working in a dealership, at only 17, attending vo-tech classes, and very happy.  He, by the way, is very definitely a kinesthetic/spatial learner.  He was like a square peg in a round hole in school, where so much of the learning is linguistic, or logical-mathematical.  At home, with hands-on projects, and as he grew, apprenticeships, mentorships, and volunteer work he blossomed.  I highly recommend reading Home Ed. Magazine.  e-mail home-edu@televar.com or call 800-236-3278 for info.  Good luck, and all the best to you as you follow your heart in meeting your child's needs.  Warmly, Marsha

Mary Lynn - Don't give up.  The first year is the hardest.  Everyone has a hard time at first, and probably everyone here would agree that they go through days when they contemplate sending their children to school.  It sounds like you need to take a few days (or more) off and work on "attitudes".  I am saying this not because I am a holier than thou type of person, but because I know the days the kids have a good attitude and obey me the first time, school goes smooooooothly.  But on those days that I let things slide, we all end up frustrated.  I am posting an article by Joyce Swann, and she offers really good advice on scheduling and what to expect.  Often times, when you pull a kid out of school, they only remember the fun stuff, and forget about the rest.  Just hang in there, it will really be worth it in the long run.  ;)  The article is at the "Homeschool World" site.  They have many other articles that may be of interest to you.  You can E-mail me if you want too.  Blessings!

We really enjoy it, but realize that it will get too expensive in the future.  Can anyone share with us their choices for good textbook hardcover/reusables?  We are looking for a Christian based classical type curriculum.  Also, drop us a line just to share Hm Schl experiences.

We also used Alpha Omega for our son for a time.  We didn't care for it, but if you do, one idea might be to have your children write their answers in their own notebooks, rather than in the<br>workbooks supplied.  We do this with our Saxon math book test booklet and it works out<br>fine.  There is also a site where you can look for and advertise used curriculum materials.  I'll try to find it and send it as well.

: We also used Alpha Omega for our son for a time.  We didn't care for it, but if you do, one idea might be to have your children write their answers in their own notebooks, rather than in the
: workbooks supplied.  We do this with our Saxon math book test booklet and it works out
: fine.  There is also a site where you can look for and advertise used curriculum materials.  I'll try to find it and send it as well.

<br>: We are home schooling our 4 children (only two are in it right now, the others are 3 yr and 9 months) with the Alpha Omega program.  We really enjoy it, but realize that it will get too expensive in the future.  Can anyone share with us their choices for good textbook hardcover/reusables?  We are looking for a Christian based classical type curriculum.  Also, drop us a line just to share Hm Schl experiences.<p>Look into ABeka Books or Bob Jones.  We use ABeka, and while challenging(my children just came out of public school) it is a good, solid curriculum.  Bob Jones also looks really good.  You might try Christian Liberty Academy....they use a variety of publishers and all are Christian based, classical curriculum.  My oldest daughter is in their CLASS program and I REALLY like her God and Government course.  Terrific for a teenager coming out of the public schools.....I know yours aren't that old yet, but worth looking into!<p>Lois <p>

If you really like the curriculum and cost is a really big factor, don't let them write in it.  I just had my kids put the answer in a notebook.  It taught them to organize it in a way that would be easily graded, page number, problem number, etc.  Or for the very young, when they need to write on the pages, maybe you could photocopy those at your church?<p>CLASS is a good program.  So is ABeka.  ABeka is more expensive, I believe.  CLASS actually uses some ABeka curriculum.  I thought their prices were great!

: Hi Folks!

: Regulars! --- Have you sent for your free lessons, yet?

: Brand new visitors! --- Try our ONLINE spelling test, yourself. Then test your children. And, if you want, you  can really go crazy testing the neighbors' children, too. Then send for the FREE lessons. The only cost to  you is the postage. You will be VERY SURPRISED at  what you receive, simply for the cost of postage stamps.

: REMINDER! --- The date of expiration for the free lessons is getting closer.  ---- NOV. 30/96

: 
: Have a great week, folks!

: : Where is the spelling test.  There was no link, and earlier, when there was one, I went to it, and still saw only advertising.  Am I missing something?  Thanks.

: Hi Kathy!

: I'm sorry about the absence of a link. When I posted the message, I completed the information for the Optional Link Url and Link Title, pressed Submit and it didn't come out right. 
: Thanks for pointing it out to me. I'm going to give it another try. If it doesn't work, please visit:

: Scroll down to:  PICKLE LEE PRODUCTIONS

: ***** Be sure to click on the RED lettering. *****That will take you to the spelling test and free lessons.

He is now 11 years old and now spells quite well - before he would write the spelling phonetically.  It is the only program that is flexible and really organizes the lists phonetically without mixing up the sound with a different spelling.  My only problem was at first when I was trying to figure out how to use the program.  A little confusing with all the options given, but it is wonderful for flexiablity and workability for those "unique spellers"!<p><br>

I am homeschooling four children right now.  My first was a "natural" at spelling, I suspect because he LOVES to read and it came through recognition.  My second child, however, is NOT an avid reader and has difficulty spelling.  She was adept at memorizing spelling lists, but didn't grasp the concept behind them.

I'm re-posting my reply to someone who is moving to the Houston area and wanted info on a support group in the area. I believe she said she's moving around today's date, so hopefully when her family gets hooked back up after the move she'll see this message and be able to respond. I'm a member of a group in the southwest part of town (the city of Sugar Land), which may be a little far from the Memorial area. Please e-mail me if you want more info about our group or others in the Houston area. Hope the move went smoothly!  :-)   Dee

Help!  Somewhere I read or heard about an idea for Christmas gift giving.  I can only remeber some of the details and would like all the details.  The idea was to give our children 3 gifts becasue the wiseman brought Jesus three gifts.  <br>The three gifts also represented something relating to what the wiseman had brought to Jesus.  If anyone has heard of this idea please pass along to me.  Thank you for your help.  Have a great day!

Hello again,<p>The message board had gotten pretty heavy and slow to load, so I cleaned it off; and this time, I successfully moved the 'cleaned off' messages over to the 'Old Message Board.'  :)<p>Also, quick update on the other boards.  After the recent problems with an obnoxious poster, I felt it was necessary to shut down the Kids Board until a more secure setup could be arranged (including password protection).   My apologies to all the children who used to post there for the this inconvenience.  <p>Alas, so far the project of setting up a secure Kids Board is moving slowly, I'm afraid.  Furthermore, no other boards are scheduled to be added now until I can work out all the kinks with the current message board system; perhaps by switching to different message board software.<p>Thanks for your continued participation.<br>Cindy Johns<p>

This is my second year in homeschooling and am involved in a wonderful group that is rather large.  However  I  realize my financial needs need to match a cirriculum that covers a number of grades.  I am currently interested in KONOS because of it's versatility and that it is one book.  I am not a type A personality and will glean from any type of cirriculum.  HELP!!! any kind of encouragement would be appreciated. <p>please E Mail.   nagel@psnw.com

Konos is great but I am using it more for ideas and reference because of time limitations.  "How to Create Your Own Unit Studies" by Valerie Bendt is a great book for anyone interested in unit studies.  It is easy to read; I go back and read it a couple of times each year, it is really helpful and seems to give direction when I need it.  Another great book(s) is the "Lessons From History" series by Gail Schultz.  Each book covers a time period: 1400s to 1700's, 1800's and 1900's.  It gives mini-bios on people in history, science, art and music; then it lists books to read, a few discussion ideas and activities.  I am using it with 5 children and it is just enough information to get us started and allows us to customize our studies by adding or deleting what we want.  There are pictures to photo copy and put on your own timeline, also.  If you enjoy reading and a few projects, this may be just right.  The kids and I like the variety and the "mini unit" concept; you can use them for a week or two... or more!

We used vol 1 for out first 2 years and loved it. I would have to agree with Nancy, it does require 3-4 hrs planning time each week,plus time gathering supplies. It is heavily library-dependent, which is great if you has access to a fine library system (we do.) The down-side of using library books is that almost everything is written from a secular perspective,so you must be careful about the books you rely on for curriculum. <p>KONOS taught me how to teach.

If you have a lot of time to coordinate lessons, gather materials, gather books (which sometimes you have to order from different libraries because your local library doesn't carry the ones suggested) then I'd say KONO's is good for you.  We had it and didn't make it past about the 4th chapter, because it takes so much work on the teachers part.  There are some really great ideas in the book though, with SOOOO much information, that if you can afford to buy the book for a reference, I would say it's worth it (we only had the 1st book).  There are some books out there I've seen like "How to Create Your Own Unit Studies" or something like that.  Maybe that would be another avenue to go down.

Posted by Wendy on November 16, 1996 at 06:59:05:<p>
I would like some input from people on what their experience has been with their children participating in sports through the public school. You can share your expiences before you homeschooled, or since you have been homeschooling. My son is playing b-ball at the local middle school. The coach yells, swears, and humiliates the kids. My son sits on the bench the entire game. He feels badely that he can't play. It's not because he's a homeschooler, there are others that don't play, also. Is this kind of experience more harm than good for him? We try to encourage him, and let him talk about how it feels to sit on the bench. He is concerned about the inappropriatness (sp?) of his coach. I'm afraid that if I address the issue of his coach being borderline "abusive" to the kids, that they'll just think that I'm a homeschooler trying to cause more trouble. I would like for him to play b-ball at the "Y", but it's an hour and a half away. ADVICE PLEASE!!

Pull your child from this situation is my advice.  My feeling is that we are homeschooling our children because we want them out of that corrupt system.  I personally will not put my children into public school sports, remedial or gifted programs, speech therapy, or other programs offered by them.  If I cannot find or organize what I am looking for we just don't do it.  My child is not going to suffer greatly from the lack of organized sports.  How about encouraging a musical instrument?   Does he have to be involved in competitive sports?  Why not organized a bimonthly game with other home-schooled children.  What?  Not enough children his age?  Isn't that one of the things you are trying to get away from with homeschooling?  They don't have to be the same age.  Older children learn alot from helping younger ones.  Just my opinion.  Hope it helps.  Daneen

Wendy, I don't know your entire situation, but let me say this.  Is Baseball that important?  Do you want him in this environment?  (My guess is no, since you are Home-schooling him.)  I attended public school, private school, and homeschooled.  One thing I learned then, was that who you spend your time with is so important.  And now, years later, I really remember the teachers most.  The good ones, and the bad ones.  Their views (some quite twisted) still pop into my mind at times.  Coaches are especially memorable to boys because of the emphasis we put on sports.  Remember, this man will influence him, one way or another.  Even if he "straightens up", your son will still know who this guy really is.<br>     Think about this and discuss it with your son.  <br>: I would like some input from people on what their experience has been with their children participating in sports through the public school. You can share your expiences before you homeschooled, or since you have been homeschooling. My son is playing b-ball at the local middle school. The coach yells, swears, and humiliates the kids.

: I would like some input from people on what their experience has been with their children participating in sports through the public school. You can share your expiences before you homeschooled, or since you have been homeschooling. My son is playing b-ball at the local middle school. The coach yells, swears, and humiliates the kids. My son sits on the bench the entire game. He feels badely that he can't play. It's not because he's a homeschooler, there are others that don't play, also. Is this kind of experience more harm than good for him? We try to encourage him, and let him talk about how it feels to sit on the bench. He is concerned about the inappropriatness (sp?) of his coach. I'm afraid that if I address the issue of his coach being borderline "abusive" to the kids, that they'll just think that I'm a homeschooler trying to cause more trouble. I would like for him to play b-ball at the "Y", but it's an hour and a half away. ADVICE PLEASE!!<p>Wendy, TALK TO THE PRINCIPAL OF THE SCHOOL!!!!! It doesn't matter if you home school and live on the planet Mars, any normal parent would object to a coach swearing or humiliating their children! I'd be willing to bet the other parents are upset too, have you asked them? You have nothing to feel silly or uncomfortable about. If the principal doesn't jump to your concerns, AND immediate changes aren't made, I would remove your son immediately! ( I'd probably remove him anyway. The principal may believe in "THE GOOD OLD BOYS CLUB" Other parents have probably complained already)Your son should realize, that you have respect for yourself and for him, and that no person should lower themselves or be subject to someone elses rudeness or stupidity! Our son has been with the same coach for 41/2 years and never, ever has there been any form of verbal abuse. These children have been in first place for all but this year because of hard work and encouragement. Proof enough to me that children rise to POSITIVE re-enforcement!! Don't ever doubt what your good sense tells you.  Good luck.<p>Andrea

I have not had any of my kids interested in group sports, but have screened lots of teachers for personal tuturing and private lessons.  I always speak with them re: my expectations in how they would deal with my children, and also, whenever possible observe them in class before enrolling my child, or call references.  I know this is not the same situation as public school coaches, but it's important that your child be treated in a way that you are comfortable with.  I personally, would never continue with a tutor or private instructor who acted like this "gentleman" does!  I expect my children to be treated with respect, definitely not be sworn at, and we discuss my belief that learning comes from within the child.  We can only facilitate the learner by nurture and guidance, being there to answer questions, and give advice when needed.  Our h.s. group has a basketball group that gets together for pickup games.  CAn you be instrumental in organizing something in your area?  Just some thoughts.  All the best to you and your child whatever you decide.

Hi!<br>I read your message with great interest.  I would like for my son to play sports in the future but have been concerned for all the reasons you mentioned in your post.  I personally would not let your son be exposed to this type of abuse.  You said that he basically sits on the bench and doesn't play so what's the point in keeping him there, anyway.    There has to be an alternative to this.  Have you looked into any churches in the area that may have a team that your son could join without having to actually join the church?  It's a long shot I know.  Just a suggestion.  Some churches, especially big ones, have teams that play against other churches in the area.  My sister's church has a team like this.  <br>Giovanna

Their phone number is (407)671-3343.  They are open M-F 10 am-5pm.  I've never been there but plan to go soon.  There is also the Central Florida School Supply.  I've been in there and it is HUGE!

: I would like to hear more from those who are trying a less structured approached. I'd like to hear from parents of kids with ADD or gifted. I need some ideas!<p>This is always a sticky subject.  My experience with my oldest son (who was almost labeled in public school as LD and ADD, but I would not let anyone attach any labels to him at his young age, thank goodness!), and was in a special ed class between K and 1, has been that unschooling has been his salvation.  We started homeschooling him in 5th grade, after he had almost reached the point of having no positive self-esteem left.  It took a while to get him to where he would willingly try anything remotely related to schoolwork.  We did a fairly structured program the first year, but this soon changed.  He learns best by doing, reading real books and following his interests.  Over the years those have included working on a train board set up (lots of electricity and science involved here, not to mention mechanics, having his own "Swiss family Robinson" style garden around a huge old tree beside our barn (after a visit to Disney World), building numorous tree houses and dams in our woods, taking an interest in small engine repair and being mentored by a friend of ours (he bartered a paint job on a tractor for a small Montgomery Wards tractor for Ryan), and helped him fix it.  This led to a mowing business, which his younger brother became a partner in the first summer, and just took over himself now that Ryan was working full-time this summer.  Ryan and Aaron had their business together for 4 years, maybe 5.  He is a certified small engine tech (correspondence course).  I learned the hard way that this unfocused kid could become very focused when it was something he wanted or was interested in.  The kid who couldn't keep his mind on the math problems, became so interested in reading automotive manuals that I couldn't get his attention.  Oh, following their interests does take listening to your child, research, and flexability.  (So does parenting!!)  And trust!  It's really hard to trust that they are learning anything.  (After all, most of us went to p.s.)  Ryan will graduate this spring, and I'm trying to remember as I work with his 9 year old brother (similar learning style) that these kids are not disabled; they are just kids with different learning styles;  mine are auditory (tapes, rhythm, music work)  Ryan has learned to compensate on his own; I learned that when he was taking the correspondence course from Foley Belsaw, that he waited til we were all in bed (house was quiet; no distractions), then read the material out loud to himself.  I didn't know he was doing this until I discovered one morning that he had completed 4 or 5 lessons that I knew he hadn't had done when I went to bed! I did not become involved with this; he learned about it from another h.s.'d kid who'd done it, paid for it himself, and accomplished it.  He even got a free course on transmission for completing it so quickly.  He now has 2 state certs for auto tech and is working in a dealership.  One thing I found is that quite often these kids are mechanically oriented, rather than visually/linguistically oriented (altho Ryan has become a good reader because he wants to read certain things; repair manuals)  Find hands on things; volunteer work, mentorships, etc.  How old are your kids?  Sometimes you have to do stuff with them until the people involved see that your child is ABLE.  That's been our biggest battle each new experience, but Ryan usually charms the most doubting adults with his ability to work hard.  Read Growing Without Schooling for inspiration!

I have set up a site on finding homeschool support on the internet through e-mail, message boards, chats, etc. A friend asked me to set one up for homeschoolers' whose children have special needs. Afterdoing a lot of cruising, I have found many specialized boards for various needs , but very little specifically aimed at the homeschoolers (1 message board & 1 e-mail loop aimed at physical & coordination problems). Is there a need for this kind of networking or do you just use the boards aimed at the specific needs? Where do YOU go to network & support with others on the web?<br>Thanks in advance!<p>Michele

In Reply to: <a href="152.html">Special Needs Homeschooling & the Internet HELP!</a> posted by Michele Tanis on November 14, 1996 at 08:08:26:<p>
: I have set up a site on finding homeschool support on the internet through e-mail, message boards, chats, etc. A friend asked me to set one up for homeschoolers' whose children have special needs. Afterdoing a lot of cruising, I have found many specialized boards for various needs , but very little specifically aimed at the homeschoolers (1 message board & 1 e-mail loop aimed at physical & coordination problems). Is there a need for this kind of networking or do you just use the boards aimed at the specific needs? Where do YOU go to network & support with others on the web?<br>: Thanks in advance!<p>: Michele<p><br>

We are in our third year and in our first year, both of my kids kinda felt that way.  They missed the recess time, lunch time, and before school time, but after a while (especially in the winter when the other kids were walking to school in real cold weather) they began to appreciate being home.  If I said last year that I wanted them to go back to school, they probably would have done it.  But this year, they are comitted to staying home.  It is such a more relaxed atmosphere here than in a stuffy classroom.  Besides, they have made so many friends in our local support group that they don't miss their other friends.  I wish you the best in the coming year.  Just relax and enjoy the time.<p>Jean

I hated that the kids board was shut down. Now I have to use another board for adults, and so does another girl, Hannah Ballou. I really wish that something ANYTHING could be done about this. It is not fair to us kids.<br>Please someone anyone do SOMETHING. The adults board is OK, my mom uses it, but it's mostly all adults. PLEASE get something done.<p>

: I hated that the kids board was shut down. Now I have to use another board for adults, and so does another girl, Hannah Ballou. I really wish that something ANYTHING could be done about this. It is not fair to us kids.
: Please someone anyone do SOMETHING. The adults board is OK, my mom uses it, but it's mostly all adults. PLEASE get something done.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated!<br>My daughter has been designated as G/T and has a tested IQ of 145.  We are considering home schooling because she is not challenged at all in the public school even though they have promoted her to second grade for the "Three R's." Living in a remote Alaskan village of 550 people seems to exaggerate our situation.  Our major concern with home schooling is the lack of interaction with other children; the usual answers to this problem (scouting, YMCA, dance classes, karate, etc.) are completely unavailable here and no interest exists with other residents for starting such.  We would love any suggestions that can be offered.  Has anyone ever worked with the public schools to have their child involved in the public program for part of the day and home schooled for the rest?  This is an option we want to address with our district as it is the only answer that we can come up with so far. Thanks for your advice!

This is an option we want to address with our district as it is the only answer that we can come up with so far. Thanks for your advice!<p><br>I just hit the enter key accidently, so I just put up a blank message .(Oops!) I also am homeschooling three gifted children ages 7, 8 & 12.. They are also diagnosed with ADD. One of my greatest concerns about homeschooling was the social aspect. I have found that since they have been at home, their social life has become much more positive, and certainly more active. Our boys are involved in scouting, church, and Tae Kwon Do lessons. That does allow them to socialize some. However, they now have the opportunity to have others in their social circle besides the children that they would come in contact with at school. They have always felt more at ease interracting with persons older than they are. Perhaps because they had more in common intellactually.(Spelling?) They enjoy spending time with adults, and seem to have little difficulty now interracting with peers when they have the opportunity. They still have contact with their friends from public school. We generally have someone over almost evey afternoon <br>after school. My oldest son had no time for a social life when he was in public school. He always had mounds of homework. The work could have been completed in a short amount of time. It took him forever to get it done each night! Partly because of the ADD, but mostly because it was so below his intellect that it bored him to death to complete the assignments. He now works on things that interest him during the day, and has the afternoon & evening to do as he pleases. He was always treated differently at school because he was always asking too many questions. He often understood the material presented by the teacher before she presented it. If it's socialization that concerns you about homeschooling, compare that to the negative experiences that will come from public schoo education.

: 
: I just hit the enter key accidently, so I just put up a blank message .(Oops!) I also am homeschooling three gifted children ages 7, 8 & 12.. They are also diagnosed with ADD. One of my greatest concerns about homeschooling was the social aspect. I have found that since they have been at home, their social life has become much more positive, and certainly more active. Our boys are involved in scouting, church, and Tae Kwon Do lessons. That does allow them to socialize some. However, they now have the opportunity to have others in their social circle besides the children that they would come in contact with at school. They have always felt more at ease interracting with persons older than they are. Perhaps because they had more in common intellactually.(Spelling?) They enjoy spending time with adults, and seem to have little difficulty now interracting with peers when they have the opportunity. They still have contact with their friends from public school. We generally have someone over almost evey afternoon 
: after school. My oldest son had no time for a social life when he was in public school. He always had mounds of homework. The work could have been completed in a short amount of time. It took him forever to get it done each night! Partly because of the ADD, but mostly because it was so below his intellect that it bored him to death to complete the assignments. He now works on things that interest him during the day, and has the afternoon & evening to do as he pleases. He was always treated differently at school because he was always asking too many questions. He often understood the material presented by the teacher before she presented it. If it's socialization that concerns you about homeschooling, compare that to the negative experiences that will come from public schoo education. The difficulties that can and will arise, will be more devistating that the socialization aspect of homeschooling. I hope that this will help in you decision. My advice would be to give it a try! If it doesn't work for you and
:  your family, than try something else. Their minds are to important to waste away on meaningless, busy work that most public schools have to offer. Good Luck!

My wife and Iare homeschooling are three sons. They are 7, 8, & 12. I think that things are going great so far. I love the idea that while I am at work, they are all at home together. I help each night, by doing reading with one of them. I also take them on walks on my days off. I have taken my oldest son with me to work a couple of times. What are some other things that I could do to help with their education. What other things to support my wife. I believe that we are in this for the long run! We were totally disgusted with our school system, and the whole educational system. I sometimes feel that I am not doing enough to support my wife. I hope to get some suggestions!

You've wimped out!<br>     <br>      <br>The right question should be: Homeschool moms.  .  .what can they do to help?<p><br>Every man instinctively knows that training the children is his responsibility. It's o.k. to let mom do it, but don't shirk the responsibility for it.<br>You take the lead. You take the responsibility.<br>Who says homeschooling has to be like public school at home?<br>Who says that your child needs to be institutionalized at home?<br>Who says that you have to test your child and compare him to other children?<br>Don't you realize that he is an individual?<p>Now, teach him to think as a hobby.<br>Teach him to "look it up,dear".<br>Teach him to read for fun.<br>Teach him to find answers to his own questions.<br>Teach him to enjoy character development.<p>Guess what dad, these things all come without academics. <br>They come by example.<br>They come by normal conversation. <br>They come by being a good dad.<br>These things have nothing to do with "schooling"<p>If your child has these things, he will get a good education if you give him nothing else.<br>You wont be able to keep him from learning what he needs to know.<br>

: : My wife and Iare homeschooling are three sons. They are 7, 8, & 12. I think that things are going great so far. I love the idea that while I am at work, they are all at home together. I help each night, by doing reading with one of them. I also take them on walks on my days off. I have taken my oldest son with me to work a couple of times. What are some other things that I could do to help with their education. What other things to support my wife. I believe that we are in this for the long run! We were totally disgusted with our school system, and the whole educational system. I sometimes feel that I am not doing enough to support my wife. I hope to get some suggestions!

: DAD: wrong question! You've wimped out!
:      
:       
: The right question should be: Homeschool moms.  .  .what can they do to help?

: 
: Every man instinctively knows that training the children is his responsibility. It's o.k. to let mom do it, but don't shirk the responsibility for it.
: You take the lead. You take the responsibility.
: Who says homeschooling has to be like public school at home?
: Who says that your child needs to be institutionalized at home?
: Who says that you have to test your child and compare him to other children?
: Don't you realize that he is an individual?

: Now, teach him to think as a hobby.
: Teach him to &quot;look it up,dear&quot;.
: Teach him to read for fun.
: Teach him to find answers to his own questions.
: Teach him to enjoy character development.

: Guess what dad, these things all come without academics. 
: They come by example.
: They come by normal conversation. 
: They come by being a good dad.
: These things have nothing to do with &quot;schooling&quot;

: If your child has these things, he will get a good education if you give him nothing else.
: You wont be able to keep him from learning what he needs to know.

Work together with your wife and figure out what talent or areas of interest that you have that you could teach or share with the children.  My husband has much more interest in politics, current events and geography than I do.  He has the boys look up a current event on the internet or newspaper.  He does this before he leaves for work and discusses it with them.  He periodically works with them a more involved project in the the evening.  Sometimes this takes the form of a more formal class time and other times he heads up discussions at the dinner table.

I think it sounds like you are already doing a lot more than you might suspect... encouragment and support are always the key things that can help a family feel like they are all working together!  Also, there are probably many interests of your won, or even hobbies, that you can take an active role in teaching to your boys.  Everyone has special talents and I'm sure it would enliven the children's day to have you lead in certain areas.  Keep up the good work!  Anne<br>

Posted by <a href="mailto:W_Dyer@nemaine.com">Wendy</a> on November 12, 1996 at 08:27:50:<p>
Are there any homeschoolers who have had any experiences accessing public school curricula, co-curricula, and extra curricula activities. My 12 year old son has  just started playing basketball at our local school. So far, so good. We have thought about  him  participating in art or music at the school. I am very hesitant. I am wondering if their are others whose have had some experience with this subject?

It depends on the school, the principal, etc.  Some schools wouldn't allow it.  We had our daughter in band and it worked out wonderfully!  There was only one secretary that didn't hesitate to remind my daughter that she was a homeschooler and didn't get the same privileges as the other students!  I'd use it sparingly and only if it doesn't conflict with your reasons for homeschooling!

Many of the exercises were designed for multiple children, and the worst for us was that it was all given at one grade level.  The advantage to homeschooling is being able to teach to your child's grade level in different subjects.  The other thing they wanted was a huge stack of papers every week.  They did not care about quality, just quantity.  They told us just to have my daughter draw so her stack of papers would be higher.  My biggest regret with it, is that now they know about us.  We filed an affidavit and would have anyway, but I just don't like the tie that occured because we had enrolled for a short time.

RE: INFO ON "HARD TO HOMESCHOOL" STATES</a> posted by Giovanna on July 16, 1996 at 18:58:19:<p>
Giovanna,<p>Well, this is always a sticking question to answer,<br>but it is quite a subjective-type opinion.  In the<br>states that I consider to be overbearingly oppressive<br>to homeschool, there are thousands of homeschoolers<br>homeschooling quite happily.  It seems that one adapts <br>to the conditions that are familiar to them. <p>Now, if one wants to *avoid* this necessity, please<br>tell your friends to avoid the following states like the<br>plague:<p>(In order of awfulness)<p>1.  Massachusetts<br>2.  New York<br>3.  Rhode Island<br>4.  Pennsylvania<br>5.  Utah<br>6.  Nevada<br>7.  Virginia (if they don't have a college degree)<br>8.  Maine<br>9.  Alabama (if they aren't Christian)<br>10. Michigan (because of the uncertain new laws)<p>Now, there are other not-quite-as-awful states, but <br>they usually have some pretty good exemptions (if you <br>know them.)<p>Here are the Top 10 (good ones):<p>1.  Idaho<br>2.  New Jersey<br>3.  Illinois<br>4.  Arizona<br>5.  Indiana<br>6.  Oklahoma<br>7.  Texas<br>8.  Mississippi<br>9.  Nebraska<br>10. Kansas<p>Please feel free to contact me if they need more details.<p><br>Kathleen Iuzzolino, President<br>The Homeschool Connection, Inc.<br>NJ and FL <p>

: Kathleen,<br>You had Maine as one of the most awful places to homeschool. <br>Why? From what I understand we are one of the  easiest states to homeschool in.<br>We do a portfolio review at the end of year and fill out the application at <br>the beginning of the year.  What could be easier?  We have never had a problem(this will be our 4th year homeschooling).<br>We have several friends who have homeschooled for many years now and have never had a problem either.<br>Also, homeschooling is very" big "<br> in our area of Maine.<br>Penni

When laws are written so<br>broadly, giving discretionary powers to local individuals, the likelihood<br>of abuses of power increases.  Example:  I know of some terrific districts<br>in Massachusetts where the local superintendents are very helpful to the <br>homeschoolers in their districts.  For these homeschoolers, MA is a great place<br>to homeschool.  Until their superintendent transfers to another district or <br>quits.  The new superintendent hates homeschoolers and all of a sudden life<br>is thrown into upheaval.

Hey, great flag!  How do you do that on a message board?<br><g>  I recognized the flag right away (I'm so proud of<br>myself) because my son did a report on GA and made a big <br>state flag.  Gee, too bad we've never been there!<p>So, how does GA fit into the list?  Somewhere in the <br>hazy middle, toward the bottom.  Mostly because the state<br>specifies that a child must be homeschooled for four and a half <br>a day, which is an unusual law, and that parents must write <br>progress reports.  GA was kept off the Bottom 10 lists by the<br>mere fact that even though children must take a standardized test<br>every three years, the scores are not required to be submitted to <br>the public school authorities!  Very strange laws <g><p>Kathleen Iuzzolino, President<br>The Homeschool Connection, Inc.

: Where does Missouri fit? We are thinking of moving there from MI. Thanks, Diane<p>You will have to do more recordkeeping in Missouri than you currently are doing in <br>Michigan.  Michigan only made it recently onto the Bottom 10 list because of the<br>uncertainty of the new laws and what they will entail.  Since most homeschoolers in<br>Michigan take the religious exemption, you probably aren't used to keeping much paperwork.<br>In Missouri compulsory ed is for children 7 to 16.  You may try to get your homeschool<br>qualified as a private school.  There are no teacher qualifications and no mandatory testing.<br>If you are not a private school, then you must maintain a plan book or other record indicating<br>subjects taught and activities and a portfolio of your children's work and a record of <br>evaluations of the children's progress OR other written, credible evidence.  <p>You will need to send a signed written declaration of enrollment by Sept. 1 or 30 days after<br>starting to homeschool to the county recorder of deeds.<p>It is highly recommended to keep a daily log showing your course of instruction for legal purposes.<p>There is a terrific webpage you could visit<br>www.win.org/library/staff/kmcmulle/mohome.htm<br>which is the Missouri homeschooling page.<p>Kathleen Iuzzolino<br>The Homeschool Connection, Inc.

Hi!  Well, Florida can be an okay place to homeschool<br>if you are aware of all of the "exceptions" to the<br>rules.  <p>First, compulsory ed is for children age 6 (by Feb. 1) <br>to age 16.  The homeschool statute is FL Stat. Ann.<br>232.02(4) which states that parents must be state-certified<br>teachers OR the parents must maintain a portfolio of<br>records and materials (log of texts and sample work sheets and <br>creative materials) for inspection upon request with 15 days <br>written notice AND file a letter of intent once for each child as<br>they become school age, giving their name, address, and birthdate.<p>There are no teacher qualifications.<p>There are testing options.  Children must either take annual tests <br>used by the school district OR use student assessment tests used by<br>the state OR be evaluated by a certified teacher of the parents' <br>choosing OR be evaluated by a mutually agreed upon method.<p>There is also a loophole of filing as a private school -- but the Courts<br>have found that one homeschool does *not* constitute a private school.  <br>If a group of homeschoolers legally incorporate and file an annual data<br>base form, they can be legally operating as a private school.<p>The general consensus is that having the privately hired certified teacher<br>to evaluate the child is your best bet.  The form that the teacher <br>fills out is very simple, stating "yes, the child has progressed," you know,<br>words to that effect.<p>Hope this helps.  <p>Kathleen Iuzzolino<br>The Homeschool Connection, Inc.

Hi Folks,<p>Sorry I am a little late with this introduction.  Hopefully you all will understand.<p>Anyhow, without further delay, I am very pleased to welcome Darryl MacKenzie as the host of the Social Studies board.<p>Darryl is the father of 4 children (ages 18 mnths to 8 years); and he and his wife Birgit have been homeschooling in the Northern Ontario, Canada area for 2 years. Darryl and Birgit work co-operatively in the development of curricula for their children.  Darryl thrives in the area of social studies (people and places) and science.  His focus this year will be on the life and times of ancient people such as the Romans, Greeks, Hebrews, Egyptians, Maya, Ancient Africans and Incas. As part of the studies the MacKenzies will be taking a closer looking at the ancient people and their spiritual beliefs; and hopefully that can be incorporated into this message board along with many other topics and threads.<p>When not homeschooling, Darryl works as a speech pathologist with children who have  developmental handicaps. His other interests include stamp collecting, genealogy, canoeing, horseback riding, hiking, cross-country skiing, wood working, and other hand crafts.

I was wondering if people could include what age group they were working with when posting a message on this list. That might make some difference as to how information is presented and what kind of activities/ lesson suggestions/ resource materials suggested. Just a thought.<br>Darryl

Try philsch.k12.pa.us/curriculum_areas.html for links to constitution and congress. Depending on the age of your friends children, how about trying to write a Family constitution? What was the process involved in the writing of the US constitution? What was helpful? Should we use the same process with our own constitution?<br>:     A friend has finally decided to let go of the old history textbooks that she's been having her kids read (they are in jr high) and try a more living book/unit study approach.  She has decided to start with the Constitution.  Unfortunetly my children are young and we are only up to Greece/Rome so I'm not much help (I wish she would start with something more exciting too).  Do any of you have suggestions that I could offer to her?  <br>: Thanks.  Andrea<p>

Subject: Re: College for parents<P>

 

: Hi everyone, <P>


: I see alot about college for homeschooled kids, and I'm very glad!  But does anyone know about college for parents who have a career or don't have the time to go away to school?  I'm especially interested in going to school by e-mail or something.  If anyone knows of any good Christian online college opportunities, I'd really like to hear from you!
: Write me either at the above address or at Robin@juno.com. <P>

: Thanks! <P>


: -Robin<P>


Robin, what you are asking about is, I think, going to be the next major market to develop for colleges. Many people don't go to college simply because of the inconvenience of bringing themselves physically to where the college is for several years out of their lives. I expect that "distance learning" (that is what this sort of thing is called) will be a bigger and bigger part of the services of most colleges in the next several years. I think there is already a way to get a full four-year degree by the Internet, but not necessarily from a "big name" school. You mentioned a Christian school, and I'm sure that many of those will be developing ways such as you mention to reach out to students. They will figure out how much to charge, and you and other students will figure out how much the credential and supervision is worth above just studying on your own. As both sides in this market develop a sense of the worth of this kind of service, and as technology improves, this sort of  opportunity will become more commonplace--and harder to distinguish from getting college credit for real-world experience, another service that will expand in years to come. <P>

: Thanks, <P>

Kathy, all of my research to date has not turned up anyone who claims to know of a Barnard admittee who was homeschooled. I'm still looking. I'm up to about 300 non-open-admission colleges that are reported to have admitted homeschoolers, over 100 of those well confirmed, including about 70 or so selective colleges. <P>


I've just posted another update of my FAQ page, after traveling from coast to coast on business. First time back in New York City in nine years; Giuliani has been good for that town, it appears. <P>

: aid would be greatly appreciated<P>


Mike, advertisements in homeschooling magazines now name several colleges (alas, not too many "competitive" colleges) that offer scholarships to applicants simply because the applicants were homeschooled. Nyack College in NY and Crown College in MN, both colleges affiliated with the same religious denomination, have such a policy, and I know one of the Crown students. More and more colleges are decided homeschoolers are, on average, a good quality addition to their student echelons. <P>


I would check recent issues of <cite>Growing Without Schooling</cite>, <cite>Home Education Magazine</cite>, <cite>Homeschooling Today</cite>, and <cite>Teaching Home</cite> to see which other colleges advertise in those places. My E-mail tells me that Oglethorpe, the Universiity of Judaism, Marlboro, and other colleges welcome homeschoolers, but I don't know with money or not. <P>

: i have a 15 yearold son who is a <BR>
: junior in high school and is homeschooled<BR>
: he took his SAT's last year when he<BR>
: was a sophomore and scored 470<BR>
: and 480...while he wants to take them<BR>
:  again i would like to know what<BR>
: colleges he can apply to in the new<BR>
: york, new jersey and conn. area. <BR>
: next year he plans to take english, <BR>
: and some other courses at a local<BR>
: community college to finish off<BR>
: his high school education...thanks<P>


Yehudah, I would encourage your son to <em>read, read, read, and read</em> to help perk up his SAT verbal score, which I think will be helpful for having more choices among more colleges, if college is really what your son is interested in. Test preparation courses are not as critical as developing a habit of reading a great deal for scoring well on the SAT. The score you mention is respectable for a 15-year-old; meanwhile, your son has a year or two to get ready to take the test again. He will surely do better the next time because of practice and because of more life experience. <P>


Several colleges are known to be pretty good colleges that admit applicants with average grades and SAT scores. One of those is Marlboro College, whose admission office E-mailed me specifically mentioning that the college likes homeschoolers. Marlboro is in Vermont, which may be close enough for you to think about. <P>

: Karl, <P>


: When Ariel (freed from school since 2nd grade) <BR>
: interviewed the Sarah Lawrence representative last<BR>
: month, she was told Sarah Lawrence welcomed homeschooled<BR>
: applicants and had enjoyed more than satisfactory <BR>
: results with homeschooled incoming freshmen. Her<BR>
: unschooled status put not the slightest wrinkle in this<BR>
: man's brow. <P>


: Ariel's SAT results came in the mail this week: 790<BR>
: verbal, 610 math -- for a 1400 total.  Not shabby, <BR>
: especially since the Sarah Lawrence rep. assured her<BR>
: they evaluated the math and verbal scores separately. <P>


: At any rate, since I didn't see Sarah Lawrence's name<BR>
: in your list of colleges that have admitted homeschoolers, <BR>
: I thought you might want to check with them for a <BR>
: confirmation. <P>


: Cerelle Simmons<P>


Cerelle, thanks, Sarah Lawrence is now listed in the Colleges That Admit Homeschoolers FAQ as it has now been reposted. Lots of "selective" colleges are now on the list--plenty for the "selective" parent to choose from, one might say. <P>

: : What's the point of going to college at all? <BR>
: : It costs lots of money, and who knows what it's worth? <P>


: I'd say that the degree itself, that is, the piece<BR>
: of paper which signifies a degree, is very important<BR>
: for job opportunities etc.  These days, though, just <BR>
: a BA isn't good enough--they now want you to <BR>
: have a masters! <P>


: But, let's ignore the economic aspect: <P>


: Why college?-- <P>


: The college experience lends great exposure<BR>
: to a great deal of subjects one might not even consider learning<BR>
: about if one had not gone to college--usually one<BR>
: ends up studying something completely different<BR>
: upon entering a college, than upon coming out of<BR>
: it!  Just one great teacher can change your entire <BR>
: life! <P>


: College serves to open you to PEOPLE, I guess that's<BR>
: what I'm saying.  That's the real difference. <BR>
: Whether through school activites, or<BR>
: classes, meeting people can be very important--<BR>
: to get into contact with those who share your<BR>
: pursuits and ideas, interests, etc...some would <BR>
: term these people as 'connections' but I prefer<BR>
: 'friends'. <P>


Syd, I've been thinking about your reply while on a business trip or two that took me from coast to coast and back again. Why wouldn't joining the Army, say, or becoming a migrant farm worker, not expose a person to even more different kinds of people than going to college does? That what I've been thinking after my recent traveling. <P>


Thanks for joining the discussion. Hope to hear from you at your convenience. <P>

: 
: : : What's the point of going to college at all? <BR>
: : : It costs lots of money, and who knows what it's worth? <P>


: What you said is true, but expensively true, both in time and money.  I think you have a much better education in the way you describe, by taking a few classes maybe, but more so, by working in the fields that you think interest you.  I know too many people that HAVE their masters, and have decided that in the work-a-day world, that is not where they want to spend their time!!!  They are not pursuing other avenues!  All that time and money!  They'll be paying for THAT education for a long time! <P>


Sis, I've read disturbing indications in the writings of economists of education that when you correct for the well-known fact that kids who go to college are, on average, richer than kids who don't, and that families with more money tend to have social and job-seeking advantages for their whole life spans, that going to college may have <strong>no</strong> economic benefit. That sounds pretty plausible to me, as a third-generation member of a family of test-wise, but never wealthy, college graduates. "House and wealth are an inheritance from fathers," and maybe college adds nothing to what a person already has in the form of economic advantage. In many countries, and perhaps the United States is one of them, government subsidies for college are a tax on the poor to benefit the wealthy. Senator Kerry's tax deduction plan, which President Clinton campaigns for, would have precisely the effect of transferring money from the poor to the rich. <P>

Subject: Re: Colleges as Social Environments for the Gifted<P>

 

: I read the rest of Ellen Winner's book yesterday. <P>


I'll have to catch up with reading it now that I am back from travel. I got to San Diego on my last business trip out west. <P>


[Some of your comments deleted here to save space.] <P>


: Ms. Winner did not write this as a book specifically about mentally gifted children and seemed to have a significant interest in artistically gifted children. <P>


Ms. Winner wrote an earlier book about artisitic intelligence, which I discovered as I requested her recent book from my public library to finish reading it. So, yes, drawing and the like have long been interests of Eileen Winner, probably since before her own children were born. <P>


: Their experiences are quite different from mentally gifted children, I would presume.  I would also educate these children in a much different way. <P>


I think I know what you mean by "mentally gifted," but I wouldn't adopt the same terminology. Profound art ability is just as "mental" as precocious facility with language. Children with those different profiles of giftedness do require differing sorts of upbringings, no doubt. I probably need to expose my son to more <P>


1) books without pictures<P>


and<P>


2) pictures without labels<P>


to maximize his opportunities for developing both kinds of intelligence. <P>


My sympathies about your story of talking to a professor about how to teach your daughter to read. That is a good argument for homeschooling, I think. <P>

<BR>
<P>

<b>Chrysler Corporation.</b>  Includes comprehensive basic necessary financial information of interest to investors in a well-organized format.  Link to SEC database of filings does the search for visitors and takes them directly to Chrysler's filings; search is already done for stock price databases as well. Rich cross references inside documents, such as the 10-K, that link to
product information located elsewhere in the site.<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.investor-rel.com/chrysler">http://www.investor-rel.com/chrysler</A><BR>
<P>


<b>Coca-Cola.</b>  Refreshing graphics and most importantly, one of the few IR sites where investors (share owners as Coca-Cola calls them) are allowed and encouraged to pose questions using a fill-in form.  Most IR sites do not even have an IR email contact.<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.cocacola.com">http://www.cocacola.com</A><BR>
<P>

<b>IBM.</b> Even the IR portion of the IBM site is interactive.  Cool charting device, a Java applet, allows visitors to create bar charts online using selected financial data. The financial report is available as a Lotus 1-2-3 spreadsheet. With an audio clip and QuickTime movie clip of IBM CEO's welcome.<br>
<A HREF="http://www.ibm.com">http://www.ibm.com</A><br>

<P>

<b>Xerox.</b> Enter IR page directly from home page instead of going through a guessing game to find IR materials.  Full Annual Report is available but broken down into a detailed table of contents making it easy for visitors to find the information they want.<BR>

In its October 6, 1995 release (No. 33-7233) the Securities and Exchange
Commission (the "SEC") stated that "the use of electronic media also
enhances the efficiency of the securities markets by allowing for the rapid
dissemination of information to investors and financial markets in a more
cost-efficient, widespread, and equitable manner than traditional
paper-based methods". 
<P>
<b>Speed of Distribution:</b>
<P>
In a proxy contest, where time is of the essence, you can gain an edge by
using a Web site.  Press releases, letters to shareholders, advertisements
and any other proxy material can be disseminated promptly after receiving
approval from the SEC Staff.
<P>
<b>"Equal Access":</b>
<P>
Electronic distribution of information enhances investors' ability to
access, research and analyze information and facilitates the provision of
information by issuers and others.  In a proxy contest, you can make sure
that your company's viewpoints will be disseminated both quickly and
efficiently. Individual investors and other stakeholders (such as employees,
vendors) can have access to timely, direct information just as large
institutional investors and arbitrageurs have.  Furthermore, by using a page
alert service and mailing list, you can create a network or community of
people interested in receiving notice of developments.
<P>
<b>Source of Unfiltered Information:</b>
<P>
Your investor relations/communications department can now be the direct
source of fast, unfiltered information.  Rather than reading day old
material that has been filtered by reporters and editors.
<P>
<b>Preferred Format:</b>
<P>
Many financial services firms prefer to receive their documents
electronically so that, for example, an assistant can monitor your company's
Proxy News page, download the relevant document, and send it on the
corporate e-mail system to 100s of interested parties, instantly and free.
<P>
<b>Cost:</b>
<P>
10,000 copies of a document can be distributed in minutes compared to the
extraordinary costs of advertising, or faxing or overnight mailing of material.

<h2>Concerns</h2>
</center>
<hr>

<b>The main concerns would be:</b>
<P>
Is this an effective way to distribute information and in a format that
interested parties would want to see it in ?
<P>
<i>SEC Regulations.</i> Electronic dissemination should be viewed as equivalent to
"paper" distribution and hence all electronic communication should receive
the same scrutiny that paper would.
<P>
<i>Security.</i> Can the documents be modified in an unfavorable way and
rebroadcast creating legal and PR problems ?
<P>
Representatives of the Contesting Group will benefit from the same fast
dissemination abilities of your company's Web site. There is no viable way
to prevent representatives of the contesting group from accessing the data.

<h2>Proposed Features of a Proxy Contest Section</h2>
</center>
<hr>

<P>
This section of your company's Web site would be able to disseminate the
latest information related to a proxy contest and visitors would even be
able to "sign up" to be notified of updates to the page.  A proxy news page
should include the following features:
<P>
An introduction to proxy news, including a reverse chronological record of
new documents filed in connection with the proxy contest.  When the visitor
comes to the page, he/she will be immediately be able to check the date of
the most recent filing.
<P>
Preliminary proxy materials should be available through a hypertext link to
your company's preliminary proxy materials in the SEC's database.  After the
final proxy materials are mailed to shareholders, this link should be
replaced by either a link to the final materials in the SEC's database or
the materials would be available directly within your company's own site.
<P>
The text of all other proxy contest-related documents such as:
<UL>
	a) Shareholder Letters<BR>
	b) Press Releases<BR>
	c) Advertisements<BR>
</UL>
All of your company's SEC filings should be accessible through a hypertext
link to the SEC's database.  A visitor would also be able to conduct his/her
own search on the SEC's database for a particular filing.
<P>
A section of hypertext links to other resources on the Internet related to
the proxy contest such as content from The New York Times, The Wall Street
Journal and other content providers.  Your company's stock quote and
historical price information could also be available.  
<P>
A page update alert service allowing a visitor to provide his/her e-mail
address in order to obtain notification of any changes to the proxy news
page.  This feature can keep followers of a proxy contest informed with the
most up to date information possible.  Visitors do not have to check the
site everyday for new information, but instead can receive an e-mail
promptly after an update is made.
<P>
The same database of e-mail addresses can be used for your company's
broadcast (one-way) mailing list  to receive updates or any additional
information that your company would like to distribute.  A visitor, however,
cannot send an e-mail message to anyone at your company using this feature
since this is a one-way broadcast.
<P>
An e-mail form  that allows a visitor to fill out a pre-determined form to
send e-mail to a contact person at your company.  After providing investors,
analysts and other visitors with comprehensive information, you may want to
provide a mechanism for visitors to ask questions to someone at your company
either through e-mail or by providing a toll-free telephone number.
<P>

<h2>Additional Options</h2>
</center>
<hr>


<P>
An additional feature to the Proxy News page could be authentication using
Public Key encryption (also know as PGP encryption). Some users of the
information at the site may want additional assurance that the document was
"signed" by your company's "private" key and that the contents have not been
changed in transit.  A typical key appears as a header on the document or
e-mail. Chrysler signs each document or e-mail with a private "key". Using a
"public key" the end user can determine if the document was in fact signed
by Chrysler's private key and that nothing has been changed, not even one
decimal place. While most users do not know how to use PGP encryption,
sophisticated financial users have come to rely on this as a means of
authenticating documents.
<P>
Audio / Video enhancements are also available so that more engaging clips
can be used, such as the CEO answering questions at a news conference, or
segments of a video clip distributed as part of a public relations strategy. 
<P>
<b>FOR MORE INFORMATION</b> on how your investor relations department can benefit
from publishing and distributing corporate information over the Internet,
please contact Rosamaria Caballero, Vice President, Sales and Marketing, The
Internet Factory by email at rcs@netfactory.com or by phone at 1.800.NET.0441.
