<p>
Dear Ms. Johnson:<br>
<p>
The teller position described in your recent Daily Record advertisement immediately caught my attention. My proven track record working for a financial institution makes me an ideal candidate for the job, and I have enclosed my resume for your consideration. You will find that my qualifications more than meet your requirements.
<p>
For example, you specify that you are looking for someone with customer service skills and experience handling money.  While attending college I worked for my university's credit union for two years. While there I handled cash transactions, opened accounts, prepared general ledger entries, took loan payments, cashed checks, and took deposits.  I am a skilled team player with exemplary customer service skills.
<p>
I look forward to discussing the position with you in more detail. If you feel that my qualifications are as much a match for State Street Investment Bank as I feel they are, please call me at your earliest convenience to schedule an interview. I look forward to hearing from you and thank you for your consideration.
<p>
Sincerely,
<pre>

Linda Smith

Dear Ms. Johnson:<br>
<p>
Thank you for taking the time to meet with me today regarding the teller position at State Street Investment Bank. I am particularly excited about the opportunity. As we discussed, my qualifications very closely match the requirements you have for the position. In addition, my two years of involvement in my university's credit union have given me experience handling cash transactions and dealing with customers -- traits you stressed as being important in your candidates.
<p>
If there is any way I can be of further assistance in the decision process, please feel free to give me a call. I look forward to hearing from you again shortly. Again, I appreciate your consideration.

<center><h2>Resume Tips from CollegeConnection</h2></center>
<p>


Some of the pointers below may seem like common knowledge but you'd be surprised how often the basic details get lost in the shuffle.  Be sure to remember the following:
<p>
<ol>
<li>Not only is your resume the first thing an employer sees from you -- it is what the employer will use to decide whether you move on to the next stage of the employment process. Make your first impression count.
<p>
<li>Be concise. Limit yourself to one page. A two-page resume is only acceptable when you have lots of experience to emphasize -- and even then it may be too much for an employer to browse. 
<p>
<li>When you are finished writing your resume, give it to other people to proofread. 
Typos and grammatical errors are inexcusable. Mistakes in your resume will cost you the 
opportunity to advance in the employment process. Check out our <a href=/cm/cc/cc19.html>Resume Proofreading 
Checklist</a> for some specific tips.
<p>
<li>Keep your contact information current. Reprint your resume if you move or get a new phone number.
</ol>

<center><h2>CollegeConnection's Writing Resources</h2></center>
<p>

When asked what skills are most desirable in a job applicant, employers inevitably mention communication skills -- often well ahead of the number of years of industry experience an applicant has, the college from which he or she graduated, or even the company for which he or she last worked. Your ability to write correctly will influence your ability to get a job.
<p>
Being able to write well means you will present yourself better in your resume and cover letter. Your language skills will improve. You will be able to speak with confidence and will handle yourself better on interviews, and your thank you letters and follow-up correspondence will impress employers. 
<p>
If you have questions about spelling, word usage, or simply want to explore sites that will help you improve your communication skills, here are some strong suggestions.
<p>

<a href="http://www.interlog.com/~ohi/inkspot/style.html">Grammer and Style Guides for Writers</a><br>

Job fairs and conventions are an excellent way for you to come face to face with many different employers in a short amount of time.  In addition to meeting managers who are looking to hire, it is a good place to collect information and network.  A meeting could very well turn into an interview on the spot -- and maybe even a job offer.  The links below will take you to lists of upcoming Job Fairs and Conventions.  Select the category that best fits you, and browse through the offerings to see what's coming to your area.  These lists were prepared by Bernard Hodes Advertising.

Moving up often means moving on -- to a new city, state, or country.  If you're being relocated or simply think the job opportunities are better in a different location, the resources below will help guide you through what can often be a difficult relocation process.

<h4>Relocating: How To Evaluate Your Opportunites
<br>
by <a href="mailto:careermv@ix.netcom.com">Jim Pawlak</a></h4>
<p>
The ad was interesting.  The job was out of town.  You sent in your resume and crossed your fingers. You survived the interview gauntlet and got the job offer.
<p>
Then the "fun" began.  Relocation.  Uprooting the household.  Leaving friends, family and the house that you planned on living in for a long time.  Pulling the kids out of school.  Worrying whether your spouse will be able to find a job.
<p>
Some fun.  But a reality many job hunters are dealing with.  The relocation process begins before you answer an ad.  Your job search homework should include a general assessment of areas you'd be willing to move to.
<p>
How should you evaluate a "relo?"  The first step is to look at the costs of living in your prospective new city.  These include:  housing, property taxes, sales and income taxes, auto insurance, gasoline and commuting, utilities.  Where to start?  Remember the out-of-town papers which you scan for jobs?  Get a current Sunday edition.  Comb through it for cost of living information.  Pay particular attention to "Houses for Sale" and "Apartments for Rent."  Look at your network and your relatives.  Does anyone live there?  Give them a call.  They'll fill you in.  Call the Chamber of Commerce there too.  Most have information packets.
<p>
Step two:  Keep your eyes open on the way to the interview.  Check out the pump prices at the gas stations.  Stop at a retail establishment;  ask a clerk about state and city sales tax.  If you're flying, look for "House for Sale" booklets at the airport.
<p>
Having cost-of-living information in hand will help you evaluate the offer and increase your ability to negotiate your overall compensation package.
<p>
An important part of that package is the relocation services.  Here are some key items included in many relocation packages:  two to three house hunting trips; moving costs;  temporary living expenses for you; the selling commission on your old home; all fees and closing costs on the new house; and getting-settled expenses - new drapes, wallpaper & paint, carpet cleaning, etc.
<p>
Buyout of your existing home may be part of your package too.  Make sure you get two appraisals.  But don't expect to get top dollar.  The realtors typically buy with the intention of making at least 5%.  They also want to sell fast.  The bottom line?  You'll get 7% to 12% below market.
<p>
My advice:  if they offer a buyout, swallow hard and take it.  If you don't, you run the risk of carrying two mortgage payments and trying to sell a vacant house.
<p>
That's what happened to a friend of mine who moved to San Francisco.  It took him 10 months to sell his old home.  It ultimately sold for only $1,000 more than the buyout figure.  Certainly not worth the 10 "extra" mortgage payments or the aggravation involved.
<p>
Dual-income families are likely to find their income a bit less than they planned the first year they move.  Why?  It takes time for the trailing spouse to find a job.  So find out if your new employer will provide career transition for your spouse.  For a relocation to go smoothly, both have to be happy.
<p>
What about the kids?  They're more resilient than adults when it comes to relocation, until they reach high school.  Moving them then is tough.  Their friends take precedence over family.  The alternative:  move them in with a relative or a friend and foot the bill.
<p>
The last thing you need to find out about your relocation package is whether the company will pay dollar for dollar (in which case you'll be in for a surprise at tax time), or whether they "gross up" the amounts paid to you by the taxes you'd owe.

<h3>How to Invigorate Your Career Without Changing Employers:</h3>
<h4>
Seek a Better Relationship with Others at the Office, and Take Steps to Boost Your Professional Contacts
<p>
by Taunee Besson
</h4>


<p>
 Do you feel stuck in your job? Burned out? In the dark about the big picture? Are you having nightmares that you're trapped in your office, unable to escape? Want to stretch a little and try something new? Any interest in increasing your marketability without giving up in the golden handcuffs?
 If you feel stymied, but assume that your career is doomed unless you move to another organization, think again. While some companies have rigid cultures that can't adjust to new ideas, most welcome a little creativity and out-of-the-box logic from longtime employees.
 Before you decide to jump ship and abandon your juicy benefit package, as well as the credibility you've built up with colleagues over the years, give some of the following suggestions a try. You may be surprised how easily you can convince management that your new ideas are brilliant. 
<p>
An Object Overview<br>
 While you've been in one position for a while, it's easy to become complacent. To broaden your perspective and boost your contributions, consider borrowing the philosophy of zero-based budgeting. In other words, clear the decks and take an objective look at everything you're doing. You'll undoubtedly find that some of the processes you use were developed by your predecessor(s) to fit their personalities or time requirements. If your methods or activities have outlived their usefulness, update them to fit today's needs. While the change may be painful, the results will be worth the effort.
 Think of your career as a small business and your job as your most recent consulting assignment. Where do you want your business to go from here? What are your one- to three-year goals? Are you on the right track to reach them? Because the corporate climate of the 90's makes no guarantees for long-term, progressive employment, you must actively pursue your career path without assuming your employer will help take care of you. If you think like an entrepreneur, you'll avoid corporate co-dependency and take charge of your future.
 If you've been wanting to learn a new skill or position, volunteer for a project within your department that will stretch your intellect, increase your knowledge and give you more visibility. Your manager and colleagues may be pigeoning you as someone who can only do XYZ. Working with them regularly on ABC may help them (and you) perceive you as the flexible, innovative person you really are, while simultaneously giving you the opportunity to grow into a more authoritative role. 
<p>
What Does Management Think?<br>
 Try to understand your manager's style, including his neuroses and idiosyncrasies. Does he assume people who arrive at 9:15 each morning lack ambition? Even if you think that's ridiculous, get to work earlier. Does she worry that employees who don't need her help are plotting to take her job? Make a point to check with her periodically, even if her opinion isn't critical to you.
 You may think going the extra mile to humor your boss is wasting time you could be using your more productively. But is it? Any successful careerist will tell you there are two keys to getting ahead: superior work and solid relationships. One without the other won't get the job done.
 Ask your manager for an informal performance appraisal once a quarter. Find out how he thinks your doing, get feedback on how you might improve, highlight your successes and brainstorm a plan of action for new and ongoing projects. Soliciting your manager's input will keep her informed about your progress and encourage her to invest in your future. It also will save you from embarrassing surprises during your formal appraisal.
 Also do everything politically expedient to build a relationship with your manager's boss, because he has the real power in determining your promotions, raises and transfers. Speak to him on a regular basis, even if it's small talk in the elevator. Send him copies of your "attaboy" letters from clients or colleagues. Make sure he knows who deserves the credit for your ideas and reports. Use him as a mentor, if possible. Just don't leave your boss out of the loop in the process.
<p>
Reach Outside Your Department<br>
 If you want to learn more about your company or eventually move beyond your current department, get to know people in other parts of your organization. Some good ways to do that include:

 <p><li>Join a company-wide task force. In a time of rampant reorganizations and re-engineerings, there are many opportunities to serve as a department's representative. If your manager recommends your for the role, take it. If she doesn't, volunteer. Working with professionals you wouldn't ordinarily meet can open your eyes to the big picture and put you in the running for jobs you've never considered (or been considered for). If you're anxious to move to a new position, it's a lot easier to be pulled from your department than push your way out of it. Fellow task-force members can remove you from your dead-end assignment and put you into a much more exciting arena - but they have to know you first.
 <p><li>Get involved in an extracurricular activity sponsored by your company. Lots of organizations have sports teams, annual picnic committees or volunteer groups who work together for fun, contacts and the welfare of their co-workers or community. These company-sanctioned groups will allow you to meet some fine people, learn new skills and make a satisfying contribution.
 <p><li>Sign up for an in-house training program. You'll learn something useful while participating with fellow professionals from many departments.
 <p><li>If there are no obvious vehicles for developing relationships with colleagues you wouldn't ordinarily meet, create some. Invite a co-worker to breakfast or lunch. Ask your manager and colleagues whom they know in other departments, then use them as  references to introduce yourself. If possible, regularly schedule one networking breakfast or lunch per week. It won't take long to gain a much more comprehensive picture of your company and make acquaintances who may become lasting friends or new co-workers.
<p>
Stretch Beyond Your Company<br>
 To meet interesting professionals throughout your community, join an organization that represents others in your career or industry. Sign up for a committee or volunteer to be a greeter. Attend regional and national conventions, and move up through the ranks if you're so inclined. Trade groups can be a great source of contacts and information about new opportunities, and they offer the chance to build skills faster than it might take in your corporation.
 You also might register for an evening or weekend class, or enroll in an advanced-degree program. The state-of-the-art in many professions is evolving at breakneck speed. Staying current will help you sharpen your intellect, provide new contacts and increase your marketability in and outside your company.
 Join a generic networking organization that attracts professionals from a variety of fields. If you attend meetings regularly, you may be pleasantly surprised by your expanding understanding of global economics and the interest other participants have in your perspective.
<p>
Take Care of Yourself<br>
Most workaholics lead unhealthy lifestyles because they're too focused on their careers. When they neglect their friends and family and forget how to have fun, they relegate themselves to rigid, one-dimensional existences. If you feel yourself becoming a poster child for the Puritan work ethic, try these alternatives:

 <p><li>Spend more time with people you love. Schedule them into your week just as you would any worthwhile business activity. And don't change your plans because your a client wants you to "save the day." When you're 70 and looking back on your life, you'll regret missing your daughter's All-Star game a lot more than refusing to play white knight for a customer or manager.
 <p><li>Make sure you devote energy to a favorite hobby, sport or volunteer activity. Being committed to a mission beyond your job gives you a healthier perspective and exercises "mind muscles" you're probably neglecting at work.
 <p><li>Work out, eat right and cut yourself some slack. Take a walk at lunch if you're feeling stressed. Better yet, skip out early and see a movie. You'll relish the freedom and give your brain a chance to rejuvenate.
 According to the famous Broadway character Auntie Mame, "Life is a banquet and most poor suckers are starving to death." If her message hits painfully close to home, it's not too late to take your seat at the table.

Telecommuting, also known as working from home.  We used to think it was the wave of the future but for many people, it is already here. Technology by way of personal computers, faxes, modems, beepers, and Internet connectivity now allow employees and entrepreneurs to operate within a virtual workplace.  There are advantages for both the corporation and the professional, but take note, there are also several important factors to assess when deciding if this type of employment situation is for you.

<h3>Networking Tips for Minority Professionals:</h3>
<h4>Increasing Your Visibility will help you Advance Faster
<br>
by Taunee Besson</h4>
<p>
In a corporate world still largely controlled by the "old boy network," minorities and women often face race and gender obstacles when seeking advancement. While most professionals must build alliances with key people to gain a competitive edge, minorities and women may find it harder to break into the existing corporate network. They often must overcome unique psychological hurdles, resulting from discrimination. But with the right approach, they can create their own effective networks of career mentors and facilitators, and the strategies they use can be helpful to all corporate climbers.
Some stellar networkers recently shared their tips. Barbara S. Cambridge, Ph.D., is an associate professor in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dr. Catalina Garcia is an anesthesiologist who also serves on her state's Board of Medical Examiners; Regina Montoya is the vice president of Westcott Communications, president of Jay Hawk, Inc. and member of the Board of Directors of Sallie Mae (Student Loan Mortgage Association); and Grace Young is the founder of Innovations, a diversity training and management consulting firm. The four were all asked to name three key reasons they've achieved success. Their pearls of wisdom follow.
<p>
<li>Find a mentor. Be prepared to hunt one down, since no one can count on being discovered. It doesn't have to be your immediate supervisor, or someone who shares your socioeconomic background. Try a savvy, friendly manager from another department. Consulting with a veteran who knows the ropes and isn't too close to your situation can help you avoid career-damaging mistakes. 
<p>
<li>Be visible in your company and community. Join a professional organization related to your career, industry or community. Become actively involved by serving on a committee or board of directors. Support your local Hispanic, African-American or Asian chamber of commerce, women's network or battered women the department or area coordinator for your company's United Way campaign or adopt-a-school program. These activities can give you recognition and network of colleagues. You'll also hone leadership skills that should speed your career advancement. (By the way, participating in outside organizations is one of the fastest ways for headhunters to find out about you.)
<p>
<li>Build a strong bank of personal, social and professional resources. Anyone from plumbers to professional friends can provide help and advice. Your family, especially, can serve as a continual source of support, encouragement, new ideas and feedback. You may think your parents and siblings can't relate to your situation, but they may surprise you. 
Be sure to meet with close friends every two or three months to share experiences, exchange ideas and provide mutual support. 
<p>
<li>Seek and maintain personal clarity. Know who you are, what you want and what you have to offer. Understanding your most valuable skills and personality traits will help you exhibit confidence. As a woman or minority you may find yourself the only one of your sex or color in a workplace group. You need the self-confidence to believe that you belong there and to avail the group of your honest viewpoints. 
To this end, don't become discouraged if goals and work-related demands seem overwhelming at times. Instead, interpret such challenges as more in a string of steep and slippery hills that most professionals face. 
<p>
<li>Unto whom much is given, much is required. Fair or not, like it or not, women and minorities who occupy managerial positions are the pacesetters for others of their sex and ethnicity. Their managers, peers, subordinates and clients watch them carefully and may form opinions, which reflect on others following in their footsteps. Gifted individuals should be aware of this role and reciprocate the mentoring and cheerleading they receive. 
<p>
<li>Develop a long-term strategy. Map out where you ultimately want to be and give yourself frequent "career checkups" to determine if you're on the right track. It helps to set short-term objectives that will lead you to the bigger one. Over the next year, focus on two or four goals, such as increasing your skills or gaining more visibility.
If you decide your career has derailed or you want to move to a different track, change your strategy to put yourself back in the running. And remember that if you don't know where you're going, you'll probably end up somewhere else. 
Seek out opportunities to show off your potential. Research and volunteer for new projects within your organization that could increase your skills and introduce you to new people and situations. Internal networking appointments with your manager or an HR professional may reveal possibilities you never knew existed. Corporate task forces, company-wide events and United Way campaigns are just a few of the vehicles you can use to broaden your horizons. 
<p>
<li>Seek wisdom; learning is perpetual. In the words of Auntie Mame, "Life is a banquet and most poor suckers are starving to death." Everyday we have the opportunity to feast on an incredible amount of new and fascinating information through interaction with other people.
As Dr. Garcia says, "We can do anything we choose if we believe we can."

<h3>Succeeding in a New Job:</h3> 
<h4>Take Steps to Excel before the Honeymoon Period Ends
<br>by Eugene Raudsepp</h4>

<p>
If you've just been hired or promoted, you'll probably enjoy a "honeymoon" during your first few weeks on the job. Your manager likely will be welcoming and complimentary, and allow you to learn the lay of the land, observe meetings and make a few mistakes of poor judgement calls.
But just as blissful honeymoon doesn't always portend a good marriage, this period isn't an accurate gauge of how well you'll do in your new job. In fact, the sooner you begin to excel, the better, since your initial performance is crucial to your career success. 
While overtly friendly, your manager will pay extra attention to your behavior during your first weeks, and his first impressions will be hard to shake. If you start slow, then improve later, you may not be able to change your boss's initial assessment of you. 
To garner good reviews in a new job, the best advice is to go the extra mile and enthusiastically meet your boss's expectations from the beginning. By heeding the following 13 guidelines, you can start off and stay on the right foot:
<p>
1. Be willing to do more than your share. Don't ever say, "This isn't my project," or "This assignment isn't part of my job description." Your willingness to shoulder more than your share tops the list of traits managers appreciate. Arrive early and stay late, and undertake every project with a  positive cooperative attitude. 
<p>
<p>
2. Please your boss. Find out what your manager and higher-ups expect of you so you can meet those needs form the outset. Learn your primary responsibilities and tasks by talking with your manager, than stepping out of your frame of reference and seeing things from his or her point of view.
To clarify your role, ask yourself these questions: 
<p>
<li>Why has the company hired or assigned me to do this job or project?
<li>What specific functions and activities does my boss want me to perform, and in what order and time frame? 
<li>What level of performance-both quality- and quantity wise- does the organization expect of me? 
<li>What results are expected of me?
<p>
From day one, your performance will be evaluated based on what you and your managers agree you should be doing from day one. That's why it's critical that you operate on the same wavelength when setting your objectives and priorities.
<p>
3. Adapt quickly to your new work situation. Fitting in is crucial to your success. 
Learn your company's culture and organization, how things are done and the top 
leadership's management style. 
<p>
4. Be friendly. Investigate the company's informal social networks and join those that seem appropriate, since participating in outings or functions can help you form useful work alliances. Being aloof and private, on the other hand, sends a message that you don't need or want to know others. 
<p>
5. Communicate effectively with subordinates. People who report to you may have more influence over your future than your superior, since you'll ultimately be judged by how well the group performs, not just on your solo efforts. 
Since the main reason people don't succeed at work is because they can't get along with others make good interpersonal relations a goal, says Henry Rozkowski, an engineering at Ford Motor Co. in Dearborn, Mich. Become known as someone who listens well and is cooperative and courteous. Also allow subordinates to discuss their needs and problems, as well as what they expect from you. 
"Ability and personality go hand in hand," says Mr. Rozkowski. "A person who can do the task but gets low marks for people skills won't get very far, but someone who has skill and gets high marks for personality will be seen as an exceptional employee."
<p>
6. Give clear directions. Look and act as if you're in control when giving directions. "When you're promoted, (it) must be very clear in your mind that you're management now," says Laura Shostack, a Los Angeles career consultant.Think of your group as a team, but realize you're the coach, not a player, says Lilian Buchanan, a counselor with Personnel Development, a career counseling firm in South Florida. Many unseasoned managers find it hard to assume this role, she says. 
"If you're a coach, you don't play second base, " says Ms. Buchanan. "A manager has to act like one, or he won't be taken seriously."
<p>
7. Praise others for their accomplishments. Everyone wants to be appreciated and recognized, and most corporate projects are joint efforts. When a project's completed with flying colors, tell higher-ups how others contributed to its success. Sharing plaudits will earn you the appreciation and goodwill of your colleagues and impress management. Your boss also may learn from your example and praise you for your contributions. 
<p>
8. Keep managers informed of your progress. Don't be secretive about assignments or behave as if they're solo operations. You may think acting this way shows independence, self-sufficiency or ambition, but your manager likely will find it suspicious or annoying. 
Be open about your activities by providing your boss with periodic updates, especially on important projects and assignments. 
Also, seek you're boss's opinions and advice so he or she stays abreast of and committed to your projects. Managers are more impressed with projects they've monitored than those handed to them as fait accomplis. Your briefings ensure that your boss is involved and interested and should lead to a favorable performance review. 
By the same token, if you're asked to complete a complex or troublesome assignment, gain your boss's approval in advance for your plans, goals and steps so you won't have to assume sole responsibility for foul-ups or mistakes. 
<p>
9. Be assertive and self-confident. Assertive people earn respect because they take responsibility for their actions, admit their mistakes and stand up for their beliefs. Demonstrate this behavior by being honest and direct about what you feel and think. 
Your body language and actions should correspond with your words. Don't give double messages or use indirect or manipulative tactics to reach your goals. 
If you don't feel assertive or confident, act like you do anyway. By acting self-assured, others will view you as confident and you'll surmount difficulties more easily. 
<p>
10. Eliminate self-sabotaging behavior. Some people feel resentful about having to prove themselves after working so hard to land new positions. They may complain that they're over-committed or overwhelmed with details. For them, the fun comes from winning the job or promotion, not actually doing it. 
A fear of failing in the new job may be at the core of these feelings. While some people only have nagging self-doubts, other may feel overwhelmed with terror. 
Despite good track records, some new hire lack confidence in themselves and think they'll be fired for making one mistake. Other people sabotage themselves because they fell guilty about achieving their goals. This "obstructive" guilt causes them to alienate bosses or customers, quit, injure themselves or fall ill just before being promoted, says Norman M. Lobsenz, a management consultant in Los Angeles. 
You may also feel obstructive guilt if you compromise your values to gain money or prestige, don't believe in the product or service you're asked to provide or think your promotion was earned by breaching your values or stepping on others. 
If you have a pattern of self-sabotaging behavior, consider consulting a professional to learn its cause. Otherwise, you'll never enjoy your full range of professional abilities or reach the level you deserve. 
It also helps to realize you don't have to handle everything perfectly as soon as you start a new job. Allow yourself time to learn to learn a new role and become acclimated to the environment. Although it's scary to take risks, doing so may help you reap your greatest professional rewards. 
"If you stay where you are, you risk being safe, secure-and bored. But if you plunge into a new job, you risk failure," says Madeline Klein, president of M.I. Klein, a Scarsdale, N.Y.,  consulting firm. 
<p>
11. Create and agenda. Many managers spread themselves too thin by trying to influence every issue that arises. By involving themselves in everything, their messages lack priority and accomplish little. To have more influence, concentrate your energies on four or five areas you feel are most important.
<p>
12. Stay organized and on top of projects. Do your homework so you'll anticipate and initiate follow-up steps without delay. Be sure you can fulfill promises before committing to them. 
Gather useful data relentlessly. Learn to absorb vast amounts of it, but don't just rely on officially sanctioned sources or commissioned studies. Power and influences depend on information. 
Delegate wisely, then keep tabs on others' progress so you won't be unpleasantly surprised. Holding regular meetings will help keep team members abreast of current projects. Invite their input, and learn to spot potential problems in time to make changes. 
Keep a current file for monthly updates about your abilities and accomplishments. Your ongoing records will help you summarize your performance during your annual review, and provide essential information for future resumes. 
<p>
13. Expect resistance from older subordinates. More experienced members of your group may act negatively or complain about your leadership. Their resistance on resentment stems from three issues: They feel it's humiliating to work for someone they view as "less experienced," they worry that their careers may be blocked by a younger person and, because of the age difference, they may disagree with some of your values. 
Although this situation can be difficult, don't take their criticism personally, reduce your authority or make excuses based on your age. By being consistent, good-natured, empathetic and goal-oriented, you'll eventually gain everyone's confidence.

<blockquote>

The U.S. Military has historically been recognized as a good source for qualified candidates with training in areas ranging from the latest electronic technology to medicine.  Over three million men and women (civilians included) on approximately 250 bases comprise the military market.  Over the past eight years, there has been a decline in military size by approximately 33%, and due to base closures an anticipated influx of thousands more military and civilian personnel will enter the work force over the next several years.  If you are a member of the military looking to the U.S. job market for employment, here are some resources you can utilize in your job search. </blockquote>

<h4>Format Your Resume to be Scanned by a Computer
<br>
by <a href=mailto:jeremy_shapiro@ny.hodes.com>Jeremy Shapiro</a></h4>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

Pretend for a moment that you find the perfect job in the classified section.  It's with a big 
Fortune 500 company - and they'll be getting hundreds of resumes. You decide to spruce up your 
resume for the job. You add a fancy font to the resume, elegantly italicize each position that you 
have held and top it off with an aesthetically pleasing black border surrounding each side of the 
paper.  Your descriptions concisely sum up your skills using lots of actions verbs to describe 
yourself. You xerox it on a blue resume paper, staple a cover letter on it and send it off.

<p>

<b>Then, you never hear from the company.</b>

<p>

You were qualified for this position and should have been called for it, but the hiring manager never got to see your resume. Why? The computer system they use could not read your resume.

<p>

<b>A computer reads resumes?</b>

<br>

More and more large companies are using computers to help them manage the volume of resumes for 
their job openings. It's called &quot;electronic applicant tracking&quot;. This new system is 
basically a database of resumes  with a built in artificial intelligence to read and extract 
information. However, if the text of the resume is hard for the computer to read, much of the 
information in the resume does not get into the database.

<p>

In our example, there are several big mistakes that will make a resume difficult to read. Let's start with the layout and format of a resume.

<hr>

<p>

<a name="res"></a>

<h3>Formatting and Printing your Resume</h3>


When the computer system receives your resume, it scans the resume into the system and then the 
computer literally reads it. The computer needs to be able to distinguish between the 
letter "m" and two "n"s placed closely together. Letters on a page can sometimes 
be blurry and fonts can be hard to read. The computer also likes to get information in a certain order. 
One software company suggests the following  to optimize a resume:

<p>

<b>When you prepare your resume:</b>

<br>

<ul>

<li>Avoid fancy text styles like italics, underlining, shadows, and reversed colors</li>

<li>Stick to commonly used fonts like Helevetica, Times, Palatino, Courier, and Universe</li>

<li>Keep the size of your font between 10 and 14 point (but don't use 10pt Times)</li>

<li>Do not condense the spacing between letters</li>

<li>Do not use vertical or horizontal lines</li>

<li>Do not use a two column format (like a newspaper)</li>

</ul>

<p>

<b>What should go first on the page?</b>

<ul>

<li><b>Put your name at the top of the page. It should be the first thing on the page</b></li>

<li>Use the standard address format:</li>
<p>
Joseph C. Newburgh<br>
123 Cherry Lane<br>
Lancaster, PA 11223<br>
<p>
<li>Bold or capitalize section heads (like Employment, Computer Skills)</li>

<li>List each phone number/fax number on its own line</li>

</ul>

<p>

<b>Printing the resume and sending it</b>

<br>

When you print your resume, use a white or light colored paper stock. Paper size should be standard U.S. 8.5x11. Send the company a laser printed original or your resume or a high quality xerox. A resume produced from a typewriter does work well with the computer system as long as the ribbon is dark.

<p>

When sending off the resume, don't staple pages together. When faxing, make sure that the fax machine (or fax software) is set to high resolution.

<a name="noun"></a>

<h3>Use Nouns instead of verbs</h3>

While writing your resume, use <b>nouns</b> to describe your qualifications, not verbs. When the  
hiring managers search through the database of resumes, they can only search by key words, and 
those key words tend to be nouns.   For instance,  "SQL Database Programmer" is generally 
easier to find in a database than writing, "Designed and implemented departmental database." 
Make sure that you use nouns that are usually used to describe your industry. Jargon is 
perfectly OK, as long as you spell out abbreviations. Put yourself in the manager's place. 
What words would you search on to fill a programming analyst position?

<p>

<b>An example:</b> 

<p>

A resume which would have said: &quot; Worked closely with writers and account coordinators in the development of client promotional materials&quot;

<p>

Should read: &quot;Art Director creating four color brochures, Director multimedia presentations, and newspaper ad books.&quot;

<hr>

<p>

<h3>Where to go from here....</h3>

You may be asking yourself how you know if the company uses a computer system? If it's a very large company, they are probably using the system. Sometimes the address where you send the resume will be a central depository. And, you can always ask a recruiter! 

<p>

Does this mean you need 2 different resumes? No, it does mean that you should have two *versions* of your resume. One, should be the one for people to look at (one that is probably more aesthetically pleasing) and one to send into computer resume systems.

<p>

The above format, printing and content guidelines will give you a strong start in 
optimizing a resume for computer systems.  Resumix, one software company who makes 
the &quot;electronic applicant tracking&quot; software, has developed a form to 
convert the format of a resume to a format that is optimized for their system.  
You can find the form  at <a href="http://www.resumix.com/resume/resume-form.html">www.resumix.com</a>.

<br><br>
<h4>TIPS on Using KEYWORDS for Electronic Resumes<br>
by <a href="mailto:online@ns.cencom.net">Wayne M. Gonyea</a>, President of OnLine Solutions, Inc.</h4>

<p>
Several electronic resume databases have been developed by a myriad of associations,
groups, and companies. They vary widely in size, content, accessibility and cost. Their primary commonality is that they are all searched in one way or another by computers.
<p>
On the far end of the spectrum are resume management systems. These systems scan
resumes into databases, search the databases on command, and rank the resumes according to the 
number of resulting "hits" they receive. At times such searches utilize multiple (10-20)
criteria. Such resume management systems are usually utilized by major corporations and
recruitment firms. The reliance upon resume management systems, coupled with the
downsizing of human resource departments in many corporations, has resulted in a
situation
whereby many resumes are never seen by human eyes once they enter the electronic
systems!
<p>
The lesson here, therefore, is to make the electronic resume as computer/scanner friendly as
possible so
that its life in a database will be extended and its likelihood of producing "hits" is
enhanced.
<p>
<b>Key Words are Key!</b>
<p>
In order to satisfy the idiosyncrasies of the scanning process, a new resume style,
utilizing
"Key Words", has developed. Key Words refer to those words or phrases that are used for
searches of databases for resumes that match. This match is called a "hit" and occurs
when one
or more resumes are selected as matching the various criteria (Key Words) used in the
search.
<p>
Key Words tend to be more of the noun or noun phrase type (Total Quality Management,
UNIX, Bio-Chemist) as opposed to power action verbs often found in traditional resumes
(Developed, Coordinated, Empowered, Organized).
<p>
"Key Word resumes are the integral ingredient of the job seeking process." James C.
Gonyea,
author of The Online Job Search Companion released by McGraw-Hill in November 1994,
goes on to say, "Key Words are the billboards that you can place on the Information
Superhighway to draw the attention of employers to your employment availability."
<p>
Another way to look at Key Word phrases is to think in terms of job duties. Detailing
your job
duties may require a modified mind set for those of you accustomed to traditional
resume
writing. However, the words and phrases that detail your job duties are the
phrases--the Key
Words-- that provide your resumes with "hits". 
<p>
<b>Traditional vs. Key Word Resumes!</b>
<p>
The Key Word resume must contain an adequate description of the job seeker's
characteristics and industry specific experience presented in Key Word terms in order
to
accommodate the electronic/computer search process. These are the words and phrases
that
employers and recruiters use to search the databases for "hits"!
<p>
The following guidelines enhance the
processing of
Key Word resumes through the electronic system:<br>
<ul>
<li>Left justify the entire document.
<li>Utilize a sans serif font in size 10.
<li>Avoid tabs.
<li>Avoid hard returns whenever possible.
<li>Avoid italic text, script, underlining, graphics, bold and shading.
<li>Avoid horizontal and vertical lines
<li>Avoid parentheses and brackets.
<li>Avoid compressed line of print.
<li>Avoid faxed copies which become fuzzy.
</ul>
<p>
As Joyce Lain Kennedy recommends in her "Electronic Resume Revolution", "The name of
the
game for OCR software is distinctive edges to each character." Key Word resumes should
be
clean, neat and detailed. Remember, they are designed to be scanned, to be computer
friendly,
to produce "hits", not necessarily for visual appearance or to be read by humans. The
more of
the above suggestions that are incorporated into the processing, the better the chances
of the
resume moving through the entire computer scanned system without corruption.
<p>
<b>Success on the Information Superhighway!</b>
<p>
This writer suggests, therefore, that successful job seekers will prepare two versions
of their
resumes. The traditional market driven resumes will continue to be designed to be read
by
"real people" in "20 seconds or less" and will follow the various formats presented by
untold
numbers of resume writers and resume writing programs. The Key Word resume, however,
should be developed, added to the successful job seeker's arsenal and utilized in any
situation
where computer scanning or posting online might possibly be involved.
<p>
Most employers are changing the way they use and retrieve information. Electronic
scanning
into databases using the Information Superhighway is no longer the "Way of the future" -- it is here now!

<p>
<blockquote>
Sometimes common-sense reminders bear repeating because details can get lost in the 
shuffle.  Make sure you haven't overlooked any of the following:
<p>

1. Not only is your resume the first thing an employer sees from you -- it is what the 
employer will use to decide whether you move on to the next stage of the employment 
process. Make your first impression count. 
<p>
2. Be concise. Limit yourself to one printed page. A two-page resume is only 
acceptable when you have lots of experience to emphasize -- and even then it may be 
too much for an employer to browse. 
<p>
3. When you are finished writing your resume, give it to other people to proofread. 
Typos and grammatical errors are inexcusable. Mistakes in your resume will cost you 
the opportunity to advance in the employment process. Check out our 
<a href="crc30.html">Resume Proofreading Checklist</a> for some specific tips. 
<p>
4. Keep your contact information current. Reprint your resume if you move or get a 
new phone number.
<p>
5. If you are interested in posting your resume online, read through some specific 
information about <a href="crc25.html">Electronic Resumes</a> as they require a 
different type of formatting.

<blockquote>
Read over the following information on the different types of resumes and click on the headings below to see an example of what each one looks like. There are three main types of resumes: Chronological, Functional, and Combination. These three standard "outlines" should be used as guides for printed resumes -- remember that your resume may include important details these do not. The type of resume you choose will be influenced by a number of factors described below.  If you are interested in writing a resume for online viewing, see our section on <a href="crc25.html">Electronic Resumes</a>.   
</blockquote>
<pre>

</pre>
<a href="crc32.html"><b>The Chronological Resume:</b></a>
The most popular of the standard resume forms is the Chronological Resume which allows you to present your work history and education in chronological order. Your information is arranged in categories; popular category headings include relevant work experience, education, and special skills. This type of resume is especially effective for entry-level job seekers or professionals who want to highlight their industry-specific job progression.
<p>
<a href="crc33.html"><b>The Functional Resume:</b></a>
The Functional Resume focuses more on the skills you have acquired than on the actual positions you have held. Again, information is presented in categories, some of which may include specific abilities, education, or jobs held. If you have extensive work experience, are seeking a job outside of your industry or have gaps in your employment history, this is the appropriate resume format for you. 
<p>
<a href="crc34.html"><b>The Combination Resume:</b></a>
The Combination Resume melds parts of the Chronological Resume with parts of the Functional Resume, making this an appropriate format for those changing jobs or careers. This can be most effective when skills and job experience need to be emphasized.

<title>CRC: Cover Letters -- Tips & Links</title>

<body bgcolor=#ffffff>

<img src=/cm/crc/images/L3cover.gif alt="CRC: Cover Letters -- Tips & Links" border=0>
</center>
<p>
<blockquote>


More than just window dressing for your resume, a cover letter is like a partner to that all-important document. Many employers today won't even look at your resume if you don't submit it with a cover letter. Your cover letter gives employers the opportunity to evaluate your ability to communicate -- do you know the proper form for a business letter? Can you string together coherent sentences? Are you able to express yourself well on paper? Your cover letter will give employers insight into all of these things. 
</blockquote>
<p>
<h4>Here are some things to consider when putting your cover letter together:</h4> 
<ul>
<li>Your cover letter should draw employers to your resume. Don't clutter it with needless facts.
<li>Keep it brief -- no employer wants to read your life's history. 
<li>Tailor it to the position and company to which you are applying -- a cover letter shouldn't be "canned." 
<li>Open by explaining why you are writing and where you heard about the opportunity -- you may want to say something similar to "your recent Daily News advertisement caught my attention." 
<li>Be sure to say why you think you would be a good match for the position. If the advertisement lists several traits or skills the employer wants to see in job applicants, reference those skills in your letter and say how you exemplify them. Mention traits that will set you apart from other candidates. 
<li>Refer the employer to your resume -- "you can see from my resume that I have the experience you are looking for" may be a good way to do so. Experiment with your own wording. 
<li>Remember to sign your cover letter. 
<li>Note "enclosure" or "enc." several lines after your signature if your resume is enclosed.
</ul>

<title>CRC: Thank You Letters -- Tips & Links</title>

<img src=/cm/crc/images/L3thank.gif alt="CRC: Thank You Letters -- Tips & Links" border=0>
</center>
<p>
<blockquote>

You crafted your cover letter. Written your resume. You've even been invited on an interview. Now one more important piece of correspondence lies between you and your potential job: The Thank You Letter.
<p>
Don't forget to follow up. Employers like a conscientious employee, and by sending a thank you letter you are showing them that you know proper business etiquette and appreciate the opportunity they have extended to you.  
</blockquote>
<p>

<h3>What should you include in a thank you letter? Here are some tips:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Thank the employer for his or her time during the interview -- this is, after all, a thank you letter.
<li>Mention some of the things you learned during the interview -- especially those things you feel you are qualified to do. For example, "I was especially excited to learn that you are looking for someone with QuarkXPress experience. As you may recall my mentioning, I have over five years of experiencing designing brochures using QuarkXPress."
<li>If you forgot to mention something during the interview, include it in the thank you note.
<li>Invite the employer to contact you for more information if necessary.
<li>Mention that you are looking forward to the employer's decision.
<li>If the employer requested that you submit samples of your work, you may attach them to the thank you letter. Be sure to mention the attachments in your letter: "As requested, I am forwarding samples of press releases I have written for your review."
<li>Be sure to sign your thank you letter.
</ul>

<blockquote>


<h4>Print a copy of the Resume Proofreading Checklist and mark it up to help you gauge your progress.</h4>
<p>
<dl>
<dt>__ Spelling Mistakes
	<dd>To avoid spelling mistakes:
		<dd>__ Don't use words with which you aren't familiar.
		<dd>__ Use a dictionary as you write.
		<dd>__ Perform a spell check on your finished resume.
		<dd>__ Carefully read every word in your resume. If you write "from" instead of "form," your spell check will be unable to detect your mistake.
		<dd>__ Have a friend or two proofread your resume for you.
<p>
<dt>__ Punctuation Mistakes<br>
	<dd>Things to look for:
		<dd>__ Periods at the end of all full sentences.
		<dd>__ Be consistent in your use of punctuation.
		<dd>__ Always put periods and commas within quotation marks. (i.e., Won awards including the "John H. Malcom Memorial Service Award.")
		<dd>__ Avoid using exclamation points.
<p>
	<dt>__ Grammatical Mistakes<br>
	<dd>Grammar hang-ups to watch for:
		<dd>__ Do not switch tenses within your resume. The duties you currently  perform should be in present tense (i.e., write reports), but ones you may 			have performed at past jobs should be in past tense (i.e., wrote reports).
		<dd>__ Capitalize all proper nouns.
		<dd>__ When expressing numbers, write out all numbers between one and nine (i.e., one, five, seven), but use numerals for all numbers above 10 
		(i.e., 11, 25, 108).
		<dd>__ If you begin a sentence with a numeral, spell out that numeral 
		(i.e., Eleven service awards won while employed.).
		<dd>__ Make sure your date formats are consistent (i.e., 11/22/96 or November 22, 1996, or 11.22.96.  Choose one and stick with it.).
<p>
<dt>__ Choose Your Words Carefully<br>
	<dd>Phrase yourself well:
		<dd>__ Be on the lookout for the following easily confused words:
			accept (to receive), except (to exclude)
			all right (correct), alright (this is not a word)
			affect (to bring about change), effect (result)
			personal (private), personnel (staff members)
			role (a character assigned or a function), roll (to revolve)
		<dd>__ Use action words (i.e., wrote reports, increased revenues, directed staff).
<p>
<dt>__ Other Potential Mistakes<br>
	<dd>Don't forget to check:
		<dd>__ Dates of all prior employment.
		<dd>__ Your address and phone number -- are they still current and correct?
		<dd>__ The number of returns separating your categories: are they consistent?
		<dd>__ Abbreviation of state names. All state abbreviations are two letters -- no 		periods. For example, New York is abbreviated NY, California is CA, and 			Florida is FL. Look up other state abbreviations.
<p>
<dt>__ Design Is Important<br>
	<dd>Keep the following tips in mind:
		<dd>__ Don't overcrowd your resume; Allow for plenty of white space.
		<dd>__ Keep your resume to one page whenever possible.
		<dd>__ Keep the number of fonts you use to a minimum -- two at the most.
		<dd>__ Use a font that is easy to read. Times Roman works well.
		<dd>__ Do not justify the lines of type on your resume. Allow the right side of the page to "rag."
		<dd>__ Do not over use capitalization, italics, underlines, or other emphasizing  features.
		<dd>__ Make sure your name, address, and a phone number appear on your resume and all correspondence, preferably at the top of the page.
		<dd>__ Print your resume on white or cream paper using a good-quality printer. Second and third-generation photocopies are a no-no.
		<dd>__ Print on one side of the paper only.
<p>
<dt>__ What To Omit<br>
	<dd>Do not put any of the following on your resume:
		<dd>__ Salary history.
		<dd>__ Sex, age, race, marital status, or other similar personal information.

<h4>How to Have a Successful Job Search</h4>
by <a href="mailto:therock@usaor.net">Kay LaRocca</a><br>
<p>
	You've got that professional resume ready and want to "hit the 
pavement" (or the computer) and begin your search of all searches, to 
find a job!  Your resume is just the beginning, so keep the following in 
mind:
<p>
	1.	Distribute your resumes and cover letters (in person 
whenever possible) anywhere you would like to work.  Never send a resume 
without a personalized cover letter.  Do research and get the name of who 
is doing the hiring.  This will come in handy when you're ready to do a 
follow-up.
<p>
	2.	Start a "job search file" and log pertinent information 
related to your job search.  Record dates, for example, the date you sent 
the resume.  Keep a separate file for all internet submissions.  After 
two weeks have passed since you first submitted your resume, follow-up 
with a phone call or visit and ask about the status of your resume.  Put 
notes in your file regarding any information you receive.
<p>
	3.	If after completing a follow-up you are still not 
receiving any response, wait a few more weeks and submit another resume. 
If a company is  not hiring, but states they will keep your resume on 
file, wait a few months and distribute another resume.  The squeaky wheel 
does get the oil and there is nothing wrong with being aggressive as long 
as you remain professional in your approach.
<p>
	4.	Well, you've done it!  A company called today and you are 
going on that important interview.  The resume got you the interview, but 
your performance in that meeting is crucial as it will decide whether the 
job offer will follow.  Their first impression of you is important so 
dress appropriately.  Relax, be positive, but be yourself!  Do your 
homework before going on that interview.  Know enough about the company 
so that you will feel comfortable and confident with your knowledge of 
the operation for which you would like to work.  Bring a typed reference 
sheet and letters of recommendation if you have these.
<p>
	5.	Last and most important remember to send the thank-you 
for the interview letter.  The interview thank-you letter is essential!
<p>  
	In closing, keep in mind that aggressiveness in the job market of 
today is the key.  You may need to submit a resume to someone more than 
once for them to take note.  Not to be overlooked are temporary agencies. 
Most temporary agencies offer a variety of positions.  This can be a life 
saving means of filling the void while still pursuing permanent 
employment.  It is also a valuable way of circulating your resume while 
actively displaying your skills and abilities.  Job placement services 
are another way to land a position.  Be sure to ask first about what the 
fee is, or what percentage of your salary they would command and for how 
long.  These fees can vary so be sure to "shop around" and do a thorough 
checking before using any placement agency.

<p>
There are millions of people and thousands of companies exchanging information over computer networks such as the Internet.  Within this complex network many different word processing applications exist (such as Microsoft Word, WriteNow, ClarisWorks, etc.) which operate on various computer platforms (for example a Macintosh computer versus a PC).  This can make it difficult to know how to send information because you may be unsure which specific program or platform the receiver uses to view documents.  Fortunately there is a standard, common text language which allows different word processing applications to read and display the same text information.   That common text language is known as ASCII text.</p>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<br>

<a name="text">
<h3>What is ASCII text?</h3>
<p>
ASCII (pronounced "askee") is an acronym which stands for "American Standard Code for Information Interchange" and is used to describe files that are stored in clear text format.  ASCII text is the simplest form of text, meaning there is no formatting mechanism within the document and the text is not platform or application specific.  For example, ASCII is the text widely used when you read and write e-mail because it is a simple text language whose main purpose is the exchange of text information (referring to information typed within the message body of an e-mail and not to enclosures or attachments).  This explains why the attempt to bold words or format paragraphs doesn't work in e-mail (resulting in the clever use of <a href="http://www.netlingo.com/smiley.html">ASCII art</a> to convey a mood or feeling).  Because of it's simplicity, ASCII text enables anyone to construct an on-line resume so when prospective employers retrieve your resume via the Internet or e-mail, they will be able to view it no matter what kind of computer they are using.</p>
<br>
<br>

<a name="work">
<h3>How does ASCII work?</h3>
<p>
In technical terms, ASCII is a coding scheme which assigns numeric values to letters, numbers, punctuation marks, and certain other characters. By standardizing the values used for these characters, ASCII enables computers and computer programs to exchange information regardless of platform. There are 128 standard ASCII codes, each of which can be represented by a 7 digit binary number: 0000000 through 1111111.  Because ASCII is the de facto world-wide standard for these code numbers, the standard ASCII character set is universal among microcomputer hardware and software.  This is good news for Internet users because now you can write or paste a text document, your ASCII resume, into an Employer's Online Respose Form, CareerMosaic's ResumeCM, or the message field of an e-mail document, and it will be easily viewed regardless of the type of computer platform you and the receiver use to transfer the information.</p>
<br>
<br>

<a name="write">
<h3>How do I write my resume in ASCII?</h3>
<p>
To create an ASCII resume, all you need to do is type your resume using your favorite word-processing application, and then save it as a text only document (sometimes also called Rich Text Format or RTF).  This should be an option under your "save" or "save as" command.  You can also use a simple text program to compose your resume.</p>
<p>
Since your resume will appear as ASCII text, it will not recognize special formatting commands specific to your word-processing program, therefore, you must watch for these common mistakes:</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>1.  Special characters</b> (such as "smart quotes," or mathematical symbols) - these do not get accurately transferred in the text save, avoid using special characters;</p>
<p>
<b>2.  Tabs</b> - do not use tabs, use your spacebar instead;</p>
<p>
<b>3.  Alignment</b> - the default for ASCII is to make everything left justified (which is the prefered format for scanning resumes and online viewing) so if you want to indent a sentence or center a heading, use the spacebar;</p>
<p>
<b>4.  Word wrap</b> - do not use this feature when composing your resume, instead use hard carriage returns to insert line breaks;</p>
<p>
<b>5.  Fonts</b> - fonts will become whatever a computer uses as its default face and size so boldface, italics, and various sizes will NOT appear in the ASCII version;</p>
<p>
<b>6.  Spell check</b> - check your document before you save it as a text file;</p>
<p>
<b>7.  Proofread</b> - make sure to read over your entire resume after you paste it in the message field and before you hit the submit button.</p>
<br>
<br>

<a name="post">
<h3>Where do I post my ASCII resume?</h3>
<p>
Once you've followed the above steps, you can start by posting your ASCII resume on  <a href="http://www.careermosaic.com/cm/cm39.html">ResumeCM</a>.  All you need to do is go to ResumeCM and follow the instructions.  Then you can use the other sections within CareerMosaic to <a href="http://www.careermosaic.com/cm/cm12.html">find Employers</a> and <a href="http://www.careermosaic.com/cm/usenet.html">search for J.O.B.S.</a> and send your ASCII resume to express your interest.  Remember, once you've constructed your ASCII resume, you can save this file and cut and paste it anywhere on the Web!  So when employers request that you forward your resume in ASCII text via e-mail, you'll already have the document ready to send.  Good Luck!</p>

<h1>Benefits</h1>
<p>
<strong>Coverage Choices</strong>
<p>
Coverage Choices is designed to provide flexibility in the type and cost of your employee benefits. You can scroll through our complete list of benefits, or click on a particular area of interest.
<p>
The program provides a wide range of benefit options. You have choices in medical, dental, vision, life and accidental death & dismemberment insurance, additional employee and dependent life insurance, long term disability, among other benefits.
<p>
The Company gives you a budget of Cypre$$ Dollar$ bi-weekly to pay for your Coverage Choices. Once you make all your choices if the premium cost ends up less than your benefit budget, (1) you can take the difference as taxable compensation added to your regular pay, or (2) you can apply the difference to your flexible spending account (for health care or dependent care) on a pre-tax basis.
<p>
If you choose coverage with a total bi-weekly premium cost of more than your Cypre$$ Dollar$, the additional costs will be deducted from your regular pay on a pre-tax basis (for medical, dental and vision) or post-tax basis (for life, supplemental life, AD&D and LTD).

<strong>GROUP INSURANCE</strong>
<br>
All full-time, regular employees are eligible for group Medical, Dental, Vision, Life, Long-Term Disability, Accidental Death & Dismemberment and Business Travel Insurance coverage.
<p>
<strong><a name="A">MEDICAL INSURANCE</a></strong>
<br>
Cypress offers many alternatives for medical coverage: EPO (Exclusive Provider Organization), PPO (Preferred Provider Organization) administered by NWNL (Northwestern National Life) as well as a number of HMO's, such as Kaiser in No. California. The basic provisions of the program are as follows:
<p>
<strong>NWNL EPO Plan</strong>
<br>
NWNL's EPO Plan provides the highest level of coverage at the lowest price. Employees must specify a Medical Clinic and Primary Care Physician (PCP) within NWNL's directory to receive the maximum benefit level. Employees also have the option of receiving services outside NWNL's EPO plan at reduced benefit levels. The specific revisions are as follows:
<pre>
                        <strong>EPO PLAN (Network)   EPO PLAN (Non-Network)</strong>

Deductible              No Deductible           $150/$300 family
Basic Coverage             100%                     70%
Physician Office Visits    $5.00                    70%
Hospital Semi-Private Rm   100%                     70%
(when pre-authorized)
Surgeon's Fees             100%                     70%
Lifetime Maximum           $1,000.00                $1,000.00
</pre>
<pre>

</pre>
<strong>NWNL PPO PLAN</strong>
<br>
NWNL's PPO Plan offers employees the flexibility of choosing any physician/medical clinic from NWNL's PPO directory to receive a higher level of benefits. Employees are not locked into one medical clinic or Primary Care Physician. Employees also have the option of seeking a provider outside the PPO network at reduced benefit levels.

Employees can reduce their taxes by paying for unreimbursed medical/dental/vision expenses and dependent care 
expenses using pre-tax dollars. Any income directed through the Flexible Spending Reimbursement Account 
Program will not assess Federal, State and Social Security taxes. Employees who wish to enroll are responsible to 
determine the amount of money they plan to budget for this purpose annually. This amount is divided equally 
between all of the pay periods in the calender years, and is deducted from each payroll into the flex account. 
As expenses are paid during the years, employees send their receipts to the benefits group responsible for 
tracking the flex accounts, and reimbursements are processed directly. Any money placed into the account <strong>but not 
used</strong> for medical/dental/vision or dependent care expenses during the year will not be refunded to the employee.
<p>
<strong><a name="H">401(K) EMPLOYEE SAVINGS PLAN</a></strong>
<br>
Cypress offers employees the opportunity to save and invest income on a before-tax basis through payroll deductions. You will be eligible to allocate your pre-tax contribution to 5 investment options. You may also roll-over monies from a previous 401(k) fund on a lump-sum basis without meeting the eligibility requirement. Eligibility for the 401(k) plan occurs on the first day of the month following your date of hire.
<p>
<strong><a name="I">PROFIT SHARING PLAN</a></strong>
<br>
Cypress offers a cash profit sharing plan to all full-time employees on or before the first day of the calender month preceding each quarter, and who remain employees as of the first day of the third month of the succeeding quarter.
<p>
<strong><a name="J">STOCK OPTION PLAN</a></strong>
<br>
Every employee receives a grant of Cypress shares at the beginning of employment. This grant enables an employee to purchase Cypress shares at a future date for a price fixed at the time of employment by the Board of Directors. The shares become available for exercise over a five year period at the rate of 1/60th per month with the first vesting occurring on the first anniversary of employment. After the first year, shares are available monthly on the hire date until all shares are vested.
<p>
Cypress issues additional grants each year for eligible employees through the Evergreen program. These shares become available for exercise over a five year period at the rate of 1/60th per month.
<p>
<strong><a name="K">EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN</a></strong>
<br>
Cypress offers employees the opportunity to purchase Cypress stock under the Stock Purchase Plan. Employees may have from 2% to 10% of their salary withheld through payroll deductions for stock purchase. The price at which the stock will be purchased by the employee will be 85% of the fair market value of Cypress stock on either the first or last day of a six-month purchase period, whichever is lower.
<p>

The company observes several holidays each calender year. Full-time and part-time employees are eligible to receive holiday pay for holidays which are designated on their normal shift. All employees receive an equal number of holiday hours each year. The holiday schedule is determined by management and published in the work week calendar.
<p>
<strong><a name="N">TUITION REIMBURSEMENT PROGRAM</a></strong>
<br>
Any regular, full-time employee taking academic courses related to their employment at Cypress and approved by their respective Vice President will be eligible for reimbursement of qualified educational expenses.
<p>
<strong><a name="O">COMPUTER PURCHASE PLAN</a></strong>
<br>
Employees who have completed 90 days of regular employment are eligible. Cypress will pay $1,200 toward the purchase price of a computer, subject to vesting. The Cypress portion ($1,200) will vest to the employee at a rate of 1/24th per month. Employees will be fully vested and have full ownership after two years.
<p>
<strong><a name="P">STANFORD INSTRUCTIONAL TELEVISION NETWORK</a></strong>

<p>
<strong><a name="Q">AUTHOR INCENTIVE PROGRAM</a></strong>

Cypress encourages employees to write articles for the trade press and business press. To this end, the authors of published, bylined articles written under the guidelines of the Cypress Articles Program are rewarded with generous bonus payments. Further, these bonus payments are tax-free to the recipients, as Cypress pre-pays all taxes that would be due.
<p>
<strong><a name="R">CREDIT UNION MEMBERSHIP</a></strong>

All regular employees are eligible for membership in the Technology Federal Credit Union. The credit union offers interest bearing checking accounts requiring no minimum balance, a VISA card below typical bank rates, access to your funds through a major banking network (STAR) and many other credit and loan conveniences.

<title>Tips & Links to Prepare Your Resume</title>

<img src=/cm/keye/images/keye.minicrc.gif alt="Career Resource Center" border=0>
</center>

<br><br>
<p>
<center>
<h3>When preparing your resume, be sure to keep the following in mind:</h3>
</center>

<br>

<p>
1. Not only is your resume the first thing an employer sees from you -- it is what the 
employer will use to decide whether you move on to the next stage of the employment 
process. Make your first impression count by using clean, good quality paper with no smudges.</p>
 
<p>
2. Be concise. Limit yourself to one or two printed pages. Anything beyond that is only 
acceptable when you have a lot of experience to emphasize -- and even then it may be 
too much for an employer to browse.</p>
 
<p>
3. When you are finished writing your resume, give it to another person to proofread. 
Typos and grammatical errors are inexcusable. Mistakes in your resume will cost you 
the opportunity to advance in the employment process. Go through the
<a href="/cm/keye/keye7.html">Resume Proofreading Checklist</a> to cover all the bases.</p>

<p>
4. Keep your contact information current. Reprint your resume if you move or get a 
new phone number or e-mail account.</p>

<p>
5. If you are interested in posting your resume online, read through some specific 
information on <a href="/cm/keye/keye8.html">Electronic Resumes</a> as this method requires a 
different type of formatting.</p>

This type of resume is especially effective for entry-level job seekers or professionals who want to highlight their industry-specific job progression.</p>


<p>
<font size=+1><b><a href="/cm/keye/keye10.html">The Functional Resume:</a></b></font>
The Functional Resume focuses more on the skills you have acquired than on the actual positions you have held. Again, information is presented in categories, some of which may include specific abilities, education, or jobs held. If you have extensive work experience, are seeking a job outside of your industry or have gaps in your employment history, this is the appropriate resume format for you.</p> 


<p>
<font size=+1><b><a href="/cm/keye/keye11.html">The Combination Resume:</a></b></font>
The Combination Resume melds parts of the Chronological Resume with parts of the Functional Resume, making this an appropriate format for those changing jobs or careers. This can be most effective when skills and job experience need to be emphasized.</p>

<h1>Cover Letters</h1>
</center>

<br>
<p>
<blockquote>
A cover letter provides employers with the opportunity to evaluate your ability to communicate -- do you know the proper form for a business letter? Can you string together coherent sentences? Are you able to express yourself well on paper? Your cover letter is meant to give employers insight into all of these things. 
</blockquote>

<br>

<p>
<h3>Here are some things to consider when putting your cover letter together:</h3> 
<ul>
<li>A cover letter should draw employers to your resume. Don't clutter it with needless facts.
<li>Keep it brief, no employer wants to read your life's history. 
<li>Tailor it to the position and company to which you are applying, in other words, a cover letter shouldn't be "canned." 
<li>Begin by explaining why you are writing to this person and where you heard about the opportunity.  You may want to say something similar to "your recent Daily News advertisement caught my attention." 
<li>Be sure to say why you think you would be a good match for the position. If the advertisement lists several traits or skills the employer wants to see in job applicants, refer to those skills in your letter and say how you exemplify them. Mention traits that will set you apart from other candidates. 
<li>Refer the employer to your resume, for example, "you can see from my resume that I have the experience you are looking for" may be a good way to do so. Experiment with your own wording. 
<li>Remember to sign your cover letter. 
<li>Note "enclosure" or "enc." several lines after your signature because your resume is enclosed.
</ul>

<h1>Thank You Letters</h1></p></center>

<br>

<blockquote>
You crafted your cover letter. Written your resume. You've even been invited on an interview. Only one more important piece of correspondence lies between you and your potential job: the Thank You Letter.
<p>
Don't forget to follow up with a thank you letter. Employers like a conscientious employee, and by sending a thank you letter you are showing that you know proper business etiquette and appreciate the opportunity they have extended to you.  
</blockquote>

<br>

<p>
<h3>What should you include in a thank you letter? Here are some tips:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Thank the employer for his or her time during the interview, this is after all, a thank you letter.
<li>Mention some of the things you learned during the interview, specifically those things you feel you are qualified to do. For example, "I was especially excited to learn that you are looking for someone with QuarkXPress experience. As you may recall my mentioning, I have over five years of experience designing brochures using QuarkXPress."
<li>If you forgot to mention something during the interview, include it in the thank you letter.
<li>Invite the employer to contact you for more information if necessary.
<li>Mention that you are looking forward to the employer's decision.
<li>If the employer requested that you submit samples of your work, you may attach them to the thank you letter. Be sure to mention the attachments in your letter: "As requested, I am forwarding samples of the press releases I have written for your review."
<li>Be sure to sign your thank you letter.
</ul>

<h1>Resume Proofreading Checklist</h1></center>

<br>


<p>
<h3>Print a copy and mark it up to help you gauge your progress.</h3></p>
<br>
<p>
<dl>
<dt><b>Spelling Mistakes</b><br>
	<dd>To avoid spelling mistakes:
		<dd>__ Don't use words with which you aren't familiar.
		<dd>__ Use a dictionary as you write.
		<dd>__ Perform a spell check on your finished resume.
		<dd>__ Carefully read every word in your resume. If you write "from" instead of "form," your spell check will be unable to detect your mistake.
		<dd>__ Have a friend or two proofread your resume for you.
<p>
<dt><b>Punctuation Mistakes</b><br>
	<dd>Things to look for:
		<dd>__ Periods at the end of all full sentences.
		<dd>__ Be consistent in your use of punctuation.
		<dd>__ Always put periods and commas within quotation marks. (i.e., Won awards including the "John H. Malcom Memorial Service Award.")
		<dd>__ Avoid using exclamation points.
<p>
	<dt><b>Grammatical Mistakes</b><br>
	<dd>Grammar hang-ups to watch for:
		<dd>__ Do not switch tenses within your resume. The duties you currently  perform should be in present tense (i.e., write reports), but ones you may 			have performed at past jobs should be in past tense (i.e., wrote reports).
		<dd>__ Capitalize all proper nouns.
		<dd>__ When expressing numbers, write out all numbers between one and nine (i.e., one, five, seven), but use numerals for all numbers above 10 
		(i.e., 11, 25, 108).
		<dd>__ If you begin a sentence with a numeral, spell out that numeral 
		(i.e., Eleven service awards won while employed.).
		<dd>__ Make sure your date formats are consistent (i.e., 11/22/96 or November 22, 1996, or 11.22.96.  Choose one and stick with it.).
<p>
<dt><b>Choose Your Words Carefully</b><br>
	<dd>Phrase yourself well:
		<dd>__ Be on the lookout for the following easily confused words:
			accept (to receive), except (to exclude)
			all right (correct), alright (this is not a word)
			affect (to bring about change), effect (result)
			personal (private), personnel (staff members)
			role (a character assigned or a function), roll (to revolve)
		<dd>__ Use action words (i.e., wrote reports, increased revenues, directed staff).
<p>
<dt><b>Other Potential Mistakes</b><br>
	<dd>Don't forget to check:
		<dd>__ Dates of all prior employment.
		<dd>__ Your address and phone number -- are they still current and correct?
		<dd>__ The number of returns separating your categories: are they consistent?
		<dd>__ Abbreviation of state names. All state abbreviations are two letters -- no periods. For example, New York is abbreviated NY, California is CA, and Florida is FL. Look up other state abbreviations.
<p>
<dt><b>Design Is Important</b><br>
	<dd>Keep the following tips in mind:
		<dd>__ Don't overcrowd your resume; Allow for plenty of white space.
		<dd>__ Keep your resume to one page whenever possible.
		<dd>__ Keep the number of fonts you use to a minimum -- two at the most.
		<dd>__ Use a font that is easy to read. Times Roman works well.
		<dd>__ Do not justify the lines of type on your resume. Allow the right side of the page to "rag."
		<dd>__ Do not over use capitalization, italics, underlines, or other emphasizing  features.
		<dd>__ Make sure your name, address, and a phone number appear on your resume and all correspondence, preferably at the top of the page.
		<dd>__ Print your resume on white or cream paper using a good-quality printer. Second and third-generation photocopies are a no-no.
		<dd>__ Print on one side of the paper only.
<p>
<dt><b>What To Omit</b><br>
	<dd>Do not put any of the following on your resume:
		<dd>__ Salary history.
		<dd>__ Sex, age, race, marital status, or other similar personal information.

<title>Tips & Links to Prepare Your Resume</title>

</center>

<br><br>
<p>
<center>
<h3>When preparing your resume, be sure to keep the following in mind:</h3>
</center>

<br>

<p>
1. Not only is your resume the first thing an employer sees from you -- it is what the 
employer will use to decide whether you move on to the next stage of the employment 
process. Make your first impression count by using clean, good quality paper with no smudges.</p>
 
<p>
2. Be concise. Limit yourself to one or two printed pages. Anything beyond that is only 
acceptable when you have a lot of experience to emphasize -- and even then it may be 
too much for an employer to browse.</p>
 
<p>
3. When you are finished writing your resume, give it to another person to proofread. 
Typos and grammatical errors are inexcusable. Mistakes in your resume will cost you 
the opportunity to advance in the employment process. Go through the
<a href="/cm/11online/11online7.html">Resume Proofreading Checklist</a> to cover all the bases.</p>

<p>
4. Keep your contact information current. Reprint your resume if you move or get a 
new phone number or e-mail account.</p>

<p>
5. If you are interested in posting your resume online, read through some specific 
information on <a href="/cm/11online/11online8.html">Electronic Resumes</a> as this method requires a 
different type of formatting.</p>

<h2>Compare Sample Resume Styles</h2></center>

<br>

<p>
<blockquote>
The following information outlines three different types of resumes.  Click on a heading below to see an example of what the style looks like. While these three styles can be used as "guidelines" for a printed resume, remember, your own resume may include important details which these do not contain.</p>
</blockquote>

<br><br>

<p>
<font size=+1><b><a href="/cm/11online/11online9.html">The Chronological Resume:</a></b></font>
The most popular of the standard resume forms is the Chronological Resume which allows you to present your work history and education in chronological order. Your information is arranged in categories; popular category headings include relevant work experience, education, and special skills. This type of resume is especially effective for entry-level job seekers or professionals who want to highlight their industry-specific job progression.</p>


<p>
<font size=+1><b><a href="/cm/11online/11online10.html">The Functional Resume:</a></b></font>
The Functional Resume focuses more on the skills you have acquired than on the actual positions you have held. Again, information is presented in categories, some of which may include specific abilities, education, or jobs held. If you have extensive work experience, are seeking a job outside of your industry or have gaps in your employment history, this is the appropriate resume format for you.</p> 


<p>
<font size=+1><b><a href="/cm/11online/11online11.html">The Combination Resume:</a></b></font>
The Combination Resume melds parts of the Chronological Resume with parts of the Functional Resume, making this an appropriate format for those changing jobs or careers. This can be most effective when skills and job experience need to be emphasized.</p>

<h1>Cover Letters</h1>
</center>

<br>
<p>
<blockquote>
A cover letter provides employers with the opportunity to evaluate your ability to communicate -- do you know the proper form for a business letter? Can you string together coherent sentences? Are you able to express yourself well on paper? Your cover letter is meant to give employers insight into all of these things. 
</blockquote>

<br>

<p>
<h3>Here are some things to consider when putting your cover letter together:</h3> 
<ul>
<li>A cover letter should draw employers to your resume. Don't clutter it with needless facts.
<li>Keep it brief, no employer wants to read your life's history. 
<li>Tailor it to the position and company to which you are applying, in other words, a cover letter shouldn't be "canned." 
<li>Begin by explaining why you are writing to this person and where you heard about the opportunity.  You may want to say something similar to "your recent Daily News advertisement caught my attention." 
<li>Be sure to say why you think you would be a good match for the position. If the advertisement lists several traits or skills the employer wants to see in job applicants, refer to those skills in your letter and say how you exemplify them. Mention traits that will set you apart from other candidates. 
<li>Refer the employer to your resume, for example, "you can see from my resume that I have the experience you are looking for" may be a good way to do so. Experiment with your own wording. 
<li>Remember to sign your cover letter. 
<li>Note "enclosure" or "enc." several lines after your signature because your resume is enclosed.
</ul>

<p>
<h1>Thank You Letters</h1></p></center>

<br>

<blockquote>
You crafted your cover letter. Written your resume. You've even been invited on an interview. Only one more important piece of correspondence lies between you and your potential job: the Thank You Letter.
<p>
Don't forget to follow up with a thank you letter. Employers like a conscientious employee, and by sending a thank you letter you are showing that you know proper business etiquette and appreciate the opportunity they have extended to you.  
</blockquote>

<br>

<p>
<h3>What should you include in a thank you letter? Here are some tips:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Thank the employer for his or her time during the interview, this is after all, a thank you letter.
<li>Mention some of the things you learned during the interview, specifically those things you feel you are qualified to do. For example, "I was especially excited to learn that you are looking for someone with QuarkXPress experience. As you may recall my mentioning, I have over five years of experience designing brochures using QuarkXPress."
<li>If you forgot to mention something during the interview, include it in the thank you letter.
<li>Invite the employer to contact you for more information if necessary.
<li>Mention that you are looking forward to the employer's decision.
<li>If the employer requested that you submit samples of your work, you may attach them to the thank you letter. Be sure to mention the attachments in your letter: "As requested, I am forwarding samples of the press releases I have written for your review."
<li>Be sure to sign your thank you letter.
</ul>

<h1>Resume Proofreading Checklist</h1></center>

<br>


<p>
<h3>Print a copy and mark it up to help you gauge your progress.</h3></p>
<br>
<p>
<dl>
<dt><b>Spelling Mistakes</b><br>
	<dd>To avoid spelling mistakes:
		<dd>__ Don't use words with which you aren't familiar.
		<dd>__ Use a dictionary as you write.
		<dd>__ Perform a spell check on your finished resume.
		<dd>__ Carefully read every word in your resume. If you write "from" instead of "form," your spell check will be unable to detect your mistake.
		<dd>__ Have a friend or two proofread your resume for you.
<p>
<dt><b>Punctuation Mistakes</b><br>
	<dd>Things to look for:
		<dd>__ Periods at the end of all full sentences.
		<dd>__ Be consistent in your use of punctuation.
		<dd>__ Always put periods and commas within quotation marks. (i.e., Won awards including the "John H. Malcom Memorial Service Award.")
		<dd>__ Avoid using exclamation points.
<p>
	<dt><b>Grammatical Mistakes</b><br>
	<dd>Grammar hang-ups to watch for:
		<dd>__ Do not switch tenses within your resume. The duties you currently  perform should be in present tense (i.e., write reports), but ones you may 			have performed at past jobs should be in past tense (i.e., wrote reports).
		<dd>__ Capitalize all proper nouns.
		<dd>__ When expressing numbers, write out all numbers between one and nine (i.e., one, five, seven), but use numerals for all numbers above 10 
		(i.e., 11, 25, 108).
		<dd>__ If you begin a sentence with a numeral, spell out that numeral 
		(i.e., Eleven service awards won while employed.).
		<dd>__ Make sure your date formats are consistent (i.e., 11/22/96 or November 22, 1996, or 11.22.96.  Choose one and stick with it.).
<p>
<dt><b>Choose Your Words Carefully</b><br>
	<dd>Phrase yourself well:
		<dd>__ Be on the lookout for the following easily confused words:
			accept (to receive), except (to exclude)
			all right (correct), alright (this is not a word)
			affect (to bring about change), effect (result)
			personal (private), personnel (staff members)
			role (a character assigned or a function), roll (to revolve)
		<dd>__ Use action words (i.e., wrote reports, increased revenues, directed staff).
<p>
<dt><b>Other Potential Mistakes</b><br>
	<dd>Don't forget to check:
		<dd>__ Dates of all prior employment.
		<dd>__ Your address and phone number -- are they still current and correct?
		<dd>__ The number of returns separating your categories: are they consistent?
		<dd>__ Abbreviation of state names. All state abbreviations are two letters -- no periods. For example, New York is abbreviated NY, California is CA, and Florida is FL. Look up other state abbreviations.
<p>
<dt><b>Design Is Important</b><br>
	<dd>Keep the following tips in mind:
		<dd>__ Don't overcrowd your resume; Allow for plenty of white space.
		<dd>__ Keep your resume to one page whenever possible.
		<dd>__ Keep the number of fonts you use to a minimum -- two at the most.
		<dd>__ Use a font that is easy to read. Times Roman works well.
		<dd>__ Do not justify the lines of type on your resume. Allow the right side of the page to "rag."
		<dd>__ Do not over use capitalization, italics, underlines, or other emphasizing  features.
		<dd>__ Make sure your name, address, and a phone number appear on your resume and all correspondence, preferably at the top of the page.
		<dd>__ Print your resume on white or cream paper using a good-quality printer. Second and third-generation photocopies are a no-no.

<center><h1>Panel on Gulf War Veterans' Illnesses Affirms Most U.S. Efforts</h1></center>


<em>By David Brown</em><br>


Tuesday, January 7 1997<br>
 The Washington Post
<p>

<p>
The Pentagon was slow in investigating whether chemical weapons could be causing Persian <B>Gulf</B> <B>War</B> veterans' health problems, though any nerve gas exposures that might have occurred are unlikely to explain their illnesses, a presidential panel has concluded.<p>
In its final report, the Presidential Advisory Committee on <B>Gulf</B> <B>War</B> Veterans' Illnesses generally praises the government's response to ailing veterans, concludes that their medical treatment has been "excellent" and states that current efforts to research their problems are "appropriate."<p>
But the report urges that all possible exposures to poison gas during the <B>war</B> be thoroughly investigated, noting that one of the "principal uncertainties" about veterans' illnesses concerns the possible long-term effects of exposure to chemical weapons.<p>
President Clinton today will receive the report, a copy of which was seen in advance by The Washington Post. He is expected to ask the 12-person committee to oversee efforts to implement more than a dozen recommendations in the report.<p>
A senior White House official said most of the committee's 24-person staff will remain on the job at least through the fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30. The committee, comprised of veterans, scientists, doctors, nurses, and policy experts, will meet periodically and review actions by the Departments of Defense and Veterans' Affairs, the official said.<p>
Clinton created the committee to investigate "<B>Gulf</B> <B>War</B> Syndrome," a constellation of chronic symptoms including fatigue, muscle and joint pain, memory loss and headaches afflicting <B>gulf</B> veterans. During 18 meetings around the country starting in August 1995, the panel heard from dozens of veterans, scientists and medical practitioners, as well as from people with unorthodox theories about what might be causing illness in veterans.<p>
In recent months, some veterans and politicians have criticized the Pentagon for not revealing until last June that thousands of soldiers may have been exposed to nerve gas in March 1991 when American troops blew up an ammunition dump in Khamisiyah, Iraq, in a mopping-up operation after the <B>war</B>.<p>
No soldiers showed clear symptoms of gas poisoning. Military officials said they had overlooked -- not suppressed -- information about the potential exposure. But critics argued that the Pentagon can't be trusted to investigate either that incident, or numerous other "exposure events" rumored to have occurred.<p>
A draft of the presidential commission's final report strongly recommended that any investigation of chemical weapons exposure be done outside the Defense Department. The Pentagon subsequently revamped and greatly enlarged its team looking into the issue.<p>
The committee's final 125-page report retains that recommendation, with the panel saying that the Pentagon's probe of chemical and biological weapons has "lacked vigor, fallen short on investigative grounds and stretched credibility."<p>
However, in a letter to the secretaries of defense, health and human services, and veterans affairs, the committee's chairwoman, Joyce C. Lashof, appears to accept that the Pentagon is not going to give up its inquiry.<p>
"The committee recognizes that in November 1996 DOD announced it was expanding its efforts related to low-level CW [chemical warfare] agent exposure. These initiatives -- combined with independent, vigorous oversight -- could begin to restore public confidence in the government's investigations of possible incidents of CW agent exposure," she wrote.<p>
That oversight apparently will now be done by the presidential committee itself.<p>
Lashof, a retired dean of the University of California at Berkeley's school of public health, also wrote that the panel "is pained by the current atmosphere of government mistrust that now surrounds every aspect of <B>Gulf</B> <B>War</B> veterans' illnesses."<p>
In previous years, expert panels convened by the National Institutes of Health, the Department of Defense, and the National Academy of Science's Institute of Medicine concluded that <B>Gulf</B> <B>War</B> Syndrome was almost certainly not a single disease, and that a search for a single cause was likely to be futile. Each also affirmed the importance of psychological stress as a frequent cause of physical complaints, particularly when the latter are unaccompanied by clear abnormalities on physical examination or laboratory testing.<p>
The presidential panel reaches the same conclusion.<p>
"Although somewhat slow to act at the end of the <B>Gulf</B> <B>War</B>, the government is now providing appropriate medical care to <B>Gulf</B> <B>War</B> veterans and has initiated research in the areas most likely to illuminate the causes of their illnesses," the report states. "The committee identified ways to fine-tune those efforts, but found that, for the most part, the government has acted in good faith to address veterans' health concerns."<p>
While there have been various estimates of the number of <B>Gulf</B> <B>War</B> veterans who may be suffering health problems, the committee concludes that any accurate estimate of the "nature and extent of <B>Gulf</B> <B>War</B> veterans illnesses" must await ongoing research.  <p>
But the report concludes that it is "unlikely" that any of nine frequently mentioned hazards of <B>Gulf</B> service explain the symptoms and illness some veterans report. In addition to chemical weapons, those hazards are pesticides, biological warfare agents, vaccines, the drug pyridostigmine bromide (given to protect soldiers against the nerve gas soman), infectious diseases, depleted uranium, smoke from burning oil wells, and petroleum products.<p>
On the contentious subject of poison gas at Khamisiyah, the committee said that "for nearby troops exposure should be presumed, although the exact levels are unknown." It added, however, that "the presumption of exposure does not include a presumption of long-term health effects."<p>
The panel put more credence in the deleterious effects of a 10th <B>Gulf</B> <B>War</B> hazard: psychological stress. "Recent animal and human studies reveal numerous pathways connecting the brain to the rest of the body, through which psychological stress can be physically expressed," the committee wrote. "Stress manifests in diverse ways, and is likely to be an important contributing factor to the broad range of physiological and psychological illnesses reported by <B>Gulf</B> <B>War</B> veterans."<p>
One of the more widely reported alleged results of the <B>Gulf</B> <B>War</B> was an increase in birth defects among the offspring of veterans. The committee concludes, however, that for numerous biological reasons it is "unlikely that acute exposures to environmental agents in Southwest Asia would result in adverse reproductive outcomes."<p>
The panel also said there is no evidence that a microorganism called Mycoplasma fermentans contaminated vaccines, or was otherwise transmitted to soldiers, as some people allege. The report noted that Garth Nicolson, a cancer biologist propounding this theory, has so far refused to accept government offers to test his hypotheses.<p>
The panel recommended that before troops are deployed, a sample of soldiers should undergo extensive medical testing. That would provide information about their "baseline" health that could be used for comparison if veterans later report widespread illness.<p>

<center><h1>The True Cost of Gulf War Syndrome</h1></center>


<em>By Patrick G. Eddington and  Mark S. Zaid  </em><br>

<br>
Wednesday, January 1 1997
<p>


<p>
      Charles Krauthammer's column "What Gulf War Syndrome?" [op-ed, Dec. 20] seeks to debunk one allegation -- that American troops were exposed to chemical or biological weapons -- and to trivialize the scope of another -- that the U.S. military was aware, prior to the gulf war, of the effect low-level chemical exposures could have on its troops. Krauthammer repeats the fiction that unless acute symptoms are visible, no damage has occurred. His blanket assertions do not stand up in the face of evidence already in the possession of the U.S. government.<p>
Ample scientific evidence suggests, for example, that exposure to low levels of chemical nerve agents (or their cousins, organophosphate pesticides) can cause serious long-term health problems. More than 20 years ago, the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute published a 47-page report detailing the chronic health problems associated with low-level exposures to such agents. The symptoms listed in the report are virtually identical to those being reported by more than 100,000 gulf war veterans.<p>
The Defense Department has known for years that there were significant risks associated with chronic low-level exposures. In 1990 members of the U.S. 330th Ordnance Company, 59th Ordnance Brigade, in Germany -- a repository location for more than 170,000 chemical nerve agent rounds -- were required to sign a document that outlined the potential risk associated with low-level chemical exposure.<p>
These risks, as detailed in the document, included memory loss, decreased alertness, decreased problem-solving ability and language problems -- some of the core symptoms now being experienced by our  veterans as a result of the allegedly nonexistent Gulf War Syndrome. After requiring the members of the 330th to sign these "information sheets," the Defense Department classified both the sheets and the medical records of the entire unit secret.<p>
Defense Department research into the effects of low-level exposure was conducted in 1991 at the Armstrong Laboratory at Brooks Air Force Base in Texas. The authors of the study explained that "[t]he military requirement that drove this program was concern about the bioeffects of single and repeated exposure to low levels of nerve agent."<p>
The results of the study are all too familiar. Motor skill deficits and other cognitive problems appeared in primates after only one week of exposure to the nerve agent soman, which is known to be within Iraq's chemical weapons arsenal. The primates showed few if any of the classic symptoms associated with nerve agent poisoning, yet their motor functions were demonstrably degraded.<p>
The key question yet to be answered is why, having suspected prior to the gulf war that there may be adverse affects to low-level exposures, the Defense Department took no action to further study the matter and seek to prepare a treatment.<p>
As for the rate of illness among gulf war veterans, Krauthammer cites as support for his thesis a recent study published in the New England Journal of Medicine, which concluded that gulf war veterans were not dying or being hospitalized at unusual rates, at least through 1993. But he chose to ignore the Nov. 26, 1996, announcement of two studies by the Centers for Disease Control and the U.S. Navy that found gulf war veterans are suffering illnesses at up to nearly six times the rate of their non-Desert Storm counterparts.<p>
Nor did he mention the announcement last month by Dr. Eula Bingham, chairwoman of the Department of Veterans Affairs' Persian Gulf Expert Scientific Committee, that gulf war veterans were clearly falling ill at unusually high rates, which might be explained by exposure to low levels of Iraqi chemical weapons and other agents. Finally, the low death rate of gulf war veterans clearly lacks any true significance. The passage of even five years after the war is unlikely to produce a high death rate based on low-level exposures.<p>
Krauthammer's characterization of Desert Storm as a "clean" war with few "dramatic, conventional war-related casualties" can only be seen as a mockery of the sacrifice and daily agony suffered by tens of thousands of gulf war veterans and their families. Notwithstanding his conclusion, the cold reality of the gulf war should now be recognized. Based on the number of Americans who likely sustained prolonged low-level exposure to Iraqi chemical and perhaps novel biological weapons, far from the victory we still perceive to have occurred, the gulf war was in actuality a defeat, with a tremendous cost that the United States must soon come to acknowledge and bear.<p>

<p>Pentagon says it hid drug risk from Gulf War troops</p>
<P>
WASHINGTON (CNN) -- <font size="-1">The Pentagon said Thursday it made a 
"conscious decision" not to tell U.S. troops that they were 
being given a drug to protect them from chemical weapons 
attacks.
</P>
<P>
The drug, which the Pentagon called "investigational," was 
intended to help ward off the effects of chemical weapons 
that the U.S. feared might be used by Iraq during the Persian 
Gulf War in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Pentagon spokesman Capt. Michael Doubleday said the military 
agency decided not to inform troops that they were taking the 
drug to keep Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein from finding out 
what chemical agents the United States was prepared to defend 
against.  Had he known, he could have adjusted the nerve 
agents in his chemical weapons, Doubleday said.
</P>
<P>
"I believe there was a conscious decision made at the time 
not to tell the troops and the reason that that was done was 
because there was enormous concern at the time of raising any 
specter, any concern on an intelligence level with the Iraqis 
that we were prepared to defend against certain kinds of 
chemical weapons," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, Doubleday added, in retrospect he thought the 
department should have told soldiers more about the drugs 
they were taking and their side effects.  "Had they been 
known to the individual that had been administered the drug, 
(the side effects) would have been of less concern," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon says only one-tenth of 1 percent of soldiers had 
symptoms serious enough to discontinue the anti-nerve gas 
agent, pyridostigmine bromide.  Side effects include 
gastrointestinal problems such as increased flatus, loose 
stools, abdominal cramps and nausea.
</P>
<P>
Of the 700,000 Americans who served in the Persian Gulf War, 
thousands came back reporting a wide variety of ailments. 
Those include fatigue, memory loss, or respiratory, digestive 
and skin problems.
</P>
<P>
A number of Gulf War veterans have also said they believe 
their health problems stemmed from chemical pollutants, such 
as germ warfare inoculations, fumes from oil fires set off by 
Iraq or possible chemical or biological attacks.
</P>
<P>
Although the U.S. government maintains it has found no 
evidence Iraq used its arsenal of chemical and biological 
weapons, the Pentagon admitted in June that thousands of U.S. 
troops may have been unknowingly exposed to chemicals, 
including sarin and mustard gas, when they destroyed an 
ammunition depot in Iraq after the Gulf War.

<H1>CIA director orders probe into alleged cover-up, release of

<H3>Pentagon appoints 'Gulf War Czar'</H3>

<P>
LANGLEY, Virginia (CNN) -- The CIA's inspector general will 
probe allegations that the agency may have covered up 
information on the possible exposure of U.S. troops to 
chemical weapons during the Persian Gulf War, a top official 
said Friday.
</P>

<P>
CIA Executive Director Nora Slatkin also announced that 58 
documents related to the controversy will be released.
</P>
<IMG SRC="slatkin.jpg" ALT="slatkin" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="135" BORDER="0" HSPACE="10" VSPACE="5">
<P>
In a rare news conference at agency headquarters, she said 
the CIA hid no information on chemical weapons exposure, 
because a "comprehensive review" revealed no evidence that 
Iraq used chemical or biological weapons during the Gulf War 
in 1991.
</P>

<P>
"In addition, our analysis indicates chemical agents released 
by aerial bombings of chemical warfare facilities did not 
reach U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia," Slatkin said.
</P>

<P>
However, she said, CIA Director John Deutch considered the 
charges serious enough to order the probe.  "This is an issue 
that goes to the core of our support for troops," Slatkin 
said.  "This is an issue that goes to the core of our 
commitment as part of the United States government.  We want 
to set the record straight."<BR>


</P>

<P>
Slatkin said there was evidence of possible exposure to 
American troops who were near an Iraqi storage bunker 
destroyed in southern Iraq.
</P>

<P>
Of the 58 documents that were allegedly suppressed, Slatkin 
said that 21 have now been released and 36 were being 
prepared for public release.  One document could 
not be released by the CIA, she said, because it belonged to 
another government.
</P>
<P>
Slatkin said that declassified CIA documents that had been 
placed on the federal government's "GulfLink" Internet site 
but later removed, were now being restored to the Web page.
</P>

<P>
Another set of documents removed from the Defense 
Department's Web page in February at the request of the CIA, were back on the 
GulfLink site as of Thursday, Slatkin said.
</P>

<h3>Former CIA analyst skeptical of self-review</h3>

<P>
Former CIA analyst Patrick Eddington, who has attacked the 
CIA for its handling of the reports and is writing a book 
about the alleged cover-up, told CNN he would not trust any 
findings of the CIA's inspector general, saying that the 
notion of the CIA investigating itself was "simply not 
credible."
</P>

<P>
"The spin doctors at CIA are in full gear," Eddington said.  
He claimed that in an internal CIA memo he uncovered, Slatkin 
ordered the Defense Intelligence Agency in March 1996 to 
block the release of any of the GulfLink material he had 
sought.
</P>

<P>
Eddington called for a bipartisan congressional investigation 
of the CIA cover-up.
</P>
<IMG SRC="eddingto.jpg" ALT="eddington" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="120" HEIGHT="157" BORDER="0" HSPACE="10" VSPACE="5">
<P>
"The notion that the CIA has conducted a comprehensive review 
is a fraud," Eddington said.  "The Central Intelligence 
Agency has refused to talk to Gulf War veterans who have 
evidence of chemical agent detections and exposures.  The 
(CIA) has refused to look at unit logs which detail similar 
exposures and similar detections," he said.
</P>

<P>
"So the notion that this has been a comprehensive review is 
simply an analytical fraud."
</P>

<P>
Eddington dismissed the suggestion that he was trying to blow 
the story out of proportion to make a profit off of his book.  
"We're publishing this book out of our own pocket, at our own 
expense, at our own risk simply because we want to get the 
message out about what really happened in the Gulf."
</P>

<h3>Pentagon to appoint Gulf Illness czar</h3>
<IMG SRC="pentagon.jpg" ALT="pentagon" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="180" HEIGHT="115" BORDER="0" HSPACE="10" VSPACE="5">
<P>
CNN has learned that the Pentagon intends to announce the 
appointment of a "czar" of Gulf War Illness issues.
</P>

<P>
The Defense Department will name Bernard Rostker, currently 
Assistant Secretary of the Navy, to be the point man on all 
matters relating to Gulf War Illness studies, reviews and 
investigations.
</P>

<P>
The Pentagon made the move after repeated public pummellings 
in the press over failures to deal with the issue.  
Pentagon officials, who have been accused by veterans and 
watchdogs of inaction, lack of compassion and cover-ups , 
hope to regain lost credibility and some control over the 
issue.
</P>

<P>
Rostker will report to Deputy Secretary of Defense John 
White.  His appointment is expected to be announced within 
the next several weeks.
</P>

<center><h1>A Theory of Chemical Interactions</h1>
<h2>Study Shows Additive Effects, but Relevance Appears Limited</h2></center>


<em>By David Brown  </em><br>


Washington Post Staff Writer<br>


Thursday, January 2 1997<br>
 The Washington Post
<p>


<p>
Some people seeking a cause for "<B>Gulf</B> <B>War</B> Syndrome" believe it wasn't poison gas that caused chronic illness, but the interaction of more benign chemicals.<p>
As evidence that unhealthy interactions could have occurred during the Persian <B>Gulf</B> <B>War</B>, they point to an experiment published earlier this year by Mohamed B. Abou-Donia, of Duke University Medical Center, and colleagues at three other institutions.<p>
The scientists used chickens, a species commonly employed in toxicology experiments. They gave the birds various combinations of pyridostigmine, the drug given soldiers as partial protection against nerve gas; permethrin, an insecticide used on uniforms and tents; and DEET, the active ingredient in the bug repellent used by the troops.<p>
Birds exposed to two of the compounds usually became ill, with muscular weakness, diarrhea and breathing problems the most common symptoms. Of the five birds given all three compounds, three died.<p>
While the study clearly demonstrated the "additive" effects of the chemicals, its relevance to <B>Gulf</B> <B>War</B> exposures is likely to be small. This is because the doses Abou-Donia and his colleagues gave the birds were far bigger than soldiers would have encountered.<p>
The animals every day took four times the amount of pyridostigmine a soldier would have taken in a day, and the birds took it every day for two months. The DEET dosage was 10 times that used by the best-studied population of heavy bug repellent users, employees of Everglades National Park. The daily permethrin dose was 7 million times what a soldier would have absorbed from a uniform each day.<p>
An alternative theory is that <B>Gulf</B> <B>War</B> Syndrome was caused only by pyridostigmine, which had unexpectedly bad effects on some soldiers who took it.<p>
For 50 years, physicians have used that drug to treat a muscle disease called myasthenia gravis. The doses prescribed are three to 50 times what soldiers took, and myasthenia patients take the drug every day.<p>
People with myasthenia gravis are not comparable to healthy soldiers. Nevertheless, there's no evidence the drug causes a chronic illness in them. Furthermore, the drug washes out of the body in less than a day, making persistent effects unlikely. It also rarely alters thinking or mood because very little gets into the brain.<p>
However, this is a drug that may have behaved differently on the battlefield.<p>
During the <B>Gulf</B> <B>War</B>, a team of Israeli scientists interviewed 213 soldiers who had recently taken pyridostigmine. One-quarter of them reported a brain-related symptom, such as headache, insomnia, nervousness, difficulty focusing attention or impaired ability to calculate. The complaints were four times more common in the soldiers than in a group of volunteers who had taken pyridostigmine in peacetime.<p>
Why might this have been true? A recent study suggests battlefield stress might have allowed the drug to get into the brain, where it could conceivably affect thinking and mood.<p>
Several scientists, led by Alon Friedman of Hebrew University in Jerusalem, produced stress in a group of laboratory mice by forcing them to swim. They then injected the animals with pyridostigmine, killed them and measured (indirectly) the amount of drug that had gotten into the animals' brains.<p>
The stressed mice needed only one-hundredth of the dose given unstressed mice to show a similar amount of pyridostigmine "activity" in brain tissue. This suggests that wartime stress could have made soldiers far more sensitive than usual to the drug's nervous system effects.<p>
However, it is not known if the veterans complaining of poor concentration and bad moods took an unusual amount of pyridostigmine -- or any at all -- during the <B>war</B>. Even if they did, there's no reason to believe the drug would still be showing its effects months or years later.<p>

<TITLE>DR. SHYH LO AND THE ARMY"S MYCOPLASMA MYSTERY </TITLE>
<CENTER>Credit goes to  JULIANNE HAMDEN</CENTER>
<P><ALIGN=CENTER>
<hr=center  width="80%" height="2"> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some questions remain about the "discovery" of a unique Virus-Like Infectious Agent dubbed Mycoplasma fermentans (Incognitus) Dr. Lo of the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology.  Dr. Lo's papers state that he found this Mycoplasma in
 HIV negative patients, and specifically in the time frame of Dec 1989 thru May 1990 an additional 10 cases were found.  What is not answered is where did these patients come from?  How did they get infected?  What is the mode of transmission?  Were sexua
l partners or other contacts infected?  Was the CDC brought in?  What was the long term prognosis of the patient treated with  and why was he treated with  to begin with?  Why did Dr. Lo first admit to finding  the Mycoplasma in Chronic Fatigue Immune Dys
function (CFIDS) patients and then later publish a letter with Drs. Kamaroff, Bell, and Cheney denying the presence of antibodies to Mycoplasma fermentans in patients with chronic fatigue syndrome?  Who were the patients in the initial studies done at Joh
n Hopkins and elsewhere?   
Where is the documentation of the transfection of mammalian cell lines and does it show infection in white blood cells as well as the red blood cells Dr. Lo says he finds the Mycoplasma in?  What were the 30 labs that Dr. Lo sent his samples to and did th
ey confirm his findings?  What was the controversary over Dr. Lo's probes?  Luc Montagnier looked for the Mycoplasma after trying antibiotics on HIV, why and how did Dr. Lo look for the Mycoplasma?  Did Luc Montagnier find the Mycoplasma  first?   In orde
r to fully investigate the findings of Dr.'s
Garth and Nancy Nicolson who have found Mycoplasma fermentans (incognitus strain) in Gulf War  Veterans
we must first ascertain the history of the Mycoplasma and answer the questions as to its "Discovery."
<hr>
<P><U><h3><CENTER>EXCERPTS FROM THE NEW YORK NATIVE:</font></CENTER></h3></U>
<hr>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1986, a researcher at the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology, Dr. Shyh Ching Lo, isolated a new organism from Kaposi's sarcoma tissue of "AIDS" patients.  He first believed this organism to be a virus or virus-like organism, so he called it "virus 
like infectious agent", or VLIA.  Subsequent research showed the infectious agent to be a new type of mycoplasma, a bacterium.  VLIA's designation was changed to Mycoplasma fermentans (strain Incognitus).
<P><U>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the years since its discovery M. fermentans has been found to be capable of something HIV is not:  The Mycoplasma causes an "AIDS" like illness in Monkeys.  It has also been found able to cause an acute fatal, flu-like illness in non "AIDS" patients.  
 In January 1991, Lo and his colleagues showed that M. fermentans is the probable cause of AAN, "AIDS" Associated Nephropathy, a fatal kidney ailment.   And in March1991, Lo and coworkers demonstrated that, in cells co-infected (in tissue culture) w
ith both HIV and M. fermentans, the "MYCOPLASMA APPEARED TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR KILLING INFECTED CELLS."  "When cells are infected with both HIV and M. fermentans, "THEY DIE."  When antibiotics are used against the mycoplasma  cell necrosis stops and they 
no longer die.  NOTE:   HIV alone is not capable of killing infected cells.</U>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ironically the man responsible for isolating HIV, Pasteur Institute's Dr. Luc Montagnier, reached the SAME CONCLUSION as did Lo and his colleagues at about THE SAME TIME.  Montagnier, too, has published research showing that, when cells cultures infected 
with both  M. fermentans and HIV are treated with mycoplasma inhibiting antibiotics cell death stops.  
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Montagnier and his colleagues went so far as to state,  "As HIV stocks produced in the presence of tetracycline analogs were unable to induce cell death, we suggested that cytopathogenicity of HIV may be due in some cases to the presence of tetracycline 
sensitive contaminating microorganisms.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words;  "HIV DOES NOT KILL CELLS IT INFECTS;  THE MYCOPLASMA HOWEVER; DOES."    
Montagnier first became interested in the possibility of mycoplasma infection in "AIDS" according to Lo, when the Pasteur Institute scientist was searching for anti "AIDS" drugs.  Montagnier's colleagues Lo explained, were testing all kinds of drugs, rather 
randomly, against cell cultures infected with HIV.  They noticed that "antibiotics stopped HIV from killing cells" Lo says.  Because Montagnier assumed that the antibiotics were not interacting with the virus (HIV), he began to look for a bacterium in 
the cell cultures.  What he found was M. fermentans, the same mycoplasma found by Lo in the United States.</CENTER>

<h1>What Gulf War Syndrome?</h1>


<em>By Charles Krauthammer  </em><br>


<br>


Friday, December 20 1996; Page A27<br>
 The Washington Post
<p>


<p>
<p>
After years of denial, the Pentagon now admits that perhaps 20,000 soldiers might have been exposed to poison gas when the allies blew up Iraqi arms depots shortly after the <B>Gulf</B> <B>War</B>. This news and the manner in which it dribbled out have fanned the darkest suspicions that the military is covering up its own responsibility for <B>Gulf</B> <B>War</B> Syndrome, that nebulous constellation of symptoms -- muscle pains, chronic fatigue, memory loss, mood changes, intestinal disorders, rashes -- that afflicts many <B>Gulf</B> <B>War</B> vets and whose cause is unknown.<p>
Now, there is no doubt that the soldiers who report these symptoms are suffering. But the scientific evidence suggests that 1) their suffering is not caused by exposure to poison gas, and 2) that they are not suffering from <B>Gulf</B> <B>War</B> Syndrome, indeed that <B>Gulf</B> <B>War</B> Syndrome is a fiction.<p>
Here's why: If these soldiers had been exposed to poison gas, the doses must have been exceedingly small. We know that because these are very deadly chemicals. The smallest amount, as we saw in the Tokyo subway attack, can kill almost instantly. (One-fifth of one gram of sarin can kill a person in eight minutes.) Yet there were no reports of any symptoms of acute chemical poisoning at the time of the supposed exposure.<p>
"There is no evidence," writes Dr. Edward Campion in the New England Journal of Medicine, "that brief, unrecognized exposure to nerve gas produces a chronic condition." Explains Dr. John C. Bailar III of the University of Chicago: "By the time you get down to a tiny number of molecules, an exposure like that is simply not going to have any effect."<p>
Thus, even if there was exposure, there is no link to <B>Gulf</B> <B>War</B> Syndrome. The Pentagon may have covered up the exposure -- it hates to admit foul-ups, especially potentially lethal ones -- but it is not covering up <B>Gulf</B> <B>War</B> Syndrome.<p>
It is hard, after all, to cover up something that almost certainly does not exist. Over the past several years five expert panels have looked into <B>Gulf</B> <B>War</B> Syndrome. None could find any scientific basis for the illness. <p>
And just last month came powerful new debunking evidence. Two studies published in the New England Journal of Medicine comparing <B>Gulf</B> <B>War</B> vets to a control group of other non-<B>Gulf</B> vets decisively demonstrated that the <B>Gulf</B> <B>War</B> group had (1) no excess deaths (other than from accidents, which is what occurred with vets from other <B>wars</B>) and (2) no excess rate of hospitalization.<p>
In fact, the death rate of <B>Gulf</B> <B>War</B> vets, as of other vets, is half what it is for other Americans. That is no comfort, of course, to the soldiers who are suffering from debilitating illnesses and who served in the <B>Gulf</B>. But a host of tearful anecdotes before congressional committees does not a syndrome make.<p>
Well, are these vets making up these symptoms? Of course not. They are real. But so are the vague debilitating symptoms seen by doctors all the time in great numbers of people who have not been in the military nor near the <B>Gulf</B>. About 700,000 U.S. soldiers rotated through the <B>Gulf</B>. Take 700,000 young people and you are going to find case upon case of unexplained illness whether they served in the <B>Gulf</B> or not. <p>
What, then, is going on with this "syndrome"? Why its national prominence? In its report on <B>Gulf</B> <B>War</B> illness, the Institute of Medicine offers this provocative speculation: <B>Gulf</B> <B>War</B> Syndrome seems to stand out more than other postwar syndromes because the <B>Gulf</B> <B>War</B> had so few dramatic, conventional <B>war</B>-related casualties.<p>
The world <B>wars</B>, Korea and Vietnam also produced thousands of vets with vague and debilitating (most likely stress-induced) postwar symptoms. But because so many were killed and maimed in actual combat, noncombat disorders received far less attention. The irony is that <B>Gulf</B> <B>War</B> syndrome stands out because the <B>Gulf</B> <B>War</B> was, from the allied point of view, so clean. <p>
I would add yet another irony. The <B>Gulf</B> <B>War</B> is remarkable not just for its swiftness but for the swiftness with which it disappeared from American consciousness. After a bare six years, it is hard now even to remember it. How often does it ever come up in discussion or in the popular media -- except in the context of <B>Gulf</B> <B>War</B> Syndrome? Indeed, the <B>Gulf</B> <B>War</B> lives in American consciousness almost exclusively in the form of <B>Gulf</B> <B>War</B> Syndrome.<p>
When our <B>Gulf</B> <B>War</B> soldiers came home after their astonishing, heroic victory, we gave them parades and 15 minutes of honor. The only way they touch our hearts today, however, is when they troop before congressional committees displaying their very real suffering. Once again we've shown that if you want care and sympathy -- and media attention -- in America, come not as a hero. Come as a victim.<p>

Thursday, December 26, 1996  3:40 pm EST 
<BR><P>




WASHINGTON (AP) -- Army scientists have agreed to investigate a
California researcher's claim that he has found a possible
bacterial explanation for some illnesses suffered by Gulf War
veterans.
<P>
Army Maj. Gen. Leslie Burger, commander of Walter Reed Army
Medical Center, will bring together federal and independent
scientists next month to determine how to probe biochemist Garth
<B>Nicolson</B>'s research into ``mycoplasma,'' microorganisms known to
sometimes cause disease.
<P>
<B>Nicolson</B> says he found a genetically altered version of
mycoplasma in the blood of half of the several hundred sick
veterans he has tested. He says antibiotics have successfully
treated some of them.
<P>
At a meeting Monday, infectious disease experts agreed that
investigating <B>Nicolson</B>'s work ``is not an unreasonable approach,''
Walter Reed spokesman Ben Smith said Thursday.
<P>
But Pentagon spokeswoman Donna Boltz cautioned that the
government has not agreed to fund actual medical research into
mycoplasma and veterans.
<P>
Thousands of veterans of the 1991 war complain of memory loss,
joint and muscle pain, depression, skin rashes and chronic fatigue.
While the government insists there is no single ``Gulf War
syndrome,'' suggested causes range from chemical weapons exposure
to an interaction between the medications and vaccines soldiers
were given.
<P>
<B>Nicolson</B>, director of the nonprofit Institute for Molecular
Medicine in Irvine, Calif., contends the mycoplasma was genetically
altered deliberately as a biological weapon.
<P>
The Pentagon had refused to collaborate with <B>Nicolson</B>, prompting
Rep. Norm Dicks, D-Wash., to arrange Monday's meeting.
<P>
``We owe it to the people who are still ill ... to look at this
more thoroughly,'' Dicks said.
<P>
<B>Nicolson</B> could not be reached Thursday, but told The
Post-Intelligencer in Seattle that only scientists independent of
the Pentagon could be trusted to do an objective study.
<P>

IAS is your source for scada systems.  Our experienced software engineers can increase your process awareness, optimize your system for efficiency, and minimize downtime due to tracking errors.
</P><HR><H2>
What is SCADA?
</H2><P>
SCADA is an acronym for supervisory control and data acquisition.  Scada systems provide real-time or semi real-time information on process variables.  For example, an automated electro-plating line would need to provide information on chemical temperatures, ph levels, and electrical conductivity.  A scada system would consist of various transducers which would measure these levels and report them back to a host computer, much as a group of human technicians would monitor gauges and report back to a supervisor.

Greystone: Automate Part Plating Line
</H4><P>
<IMG SRC="img/plate4.jpg" ALIGN="RIGHT">Greystone of Virginia, a company specializing in electroplating automotive parts, had a problem.  Their plating line was driven by a computer control, yet it required three operators to run the line.  Two operators would each drive a single hoist, while the third operator would look for their hand signals to begin a plating cycle from a touch panel located at the front of the line.
</P><P>
<IMG SRC="img/plate2.jpg" ALIGN="LEFT">Even worse, the hoists had to be manually positioned over tanks, which required the hoists to move slowly to allow for operator guidance.  This bottleneck in throughput limited the overall output of the plating line.
</P><P>
<IMG SRC="img/plate5.jpg" ALIGN="RIGHT">Once IAS took on this problem, we divided the problem into steps to minimize line downtime.  The first phase was to reprogram the control system to give the hoists a sense of current position and target position.  With this accomplished, the hoist speed was ramped up.  This allowed the operators to re-apportion their concentration from positioning the hoist to tracking multiple batches.
</P><P>
<IMG SRC="img/plate3.jpg" ALIGN="LEFT">The second phase consisted of fully automating the line from a touch panel operator console at the front of the line away.  This had the advantage of reducing the number of operators from three to one, and isolated the operator from equipment and chemical fumes.
</P><P>
The third and final phase, presently in progress, is to finish complete automation of the line from a remote SCADA platform.  This phase, when complete, will provide for better batch tracking, higher amounts of process coordination, and minimal oversight by operators.

Greystone of Virginia: improve part traying machine
</H4><P>
Our mission in this project was to improve the functional system of the part traying machine, shown in the following images.  The system suffered from the mis-alignment of the trays, which caused the machine to jam.  The system had no way of detecting this condition, and the PLC would happily continue the motion of the tray, shearing the parts and damaging the equipment.
</P><P>
<IMG SRC="img/guysan2.jpg">
</P><P>
Our solution to this problem was to install optical beam sensors to detect when parts became jammed.  The sensors were placed at a level just above the height of correctly trayed parts, and the PLC program was adjusted to stop the machine when the beam was broken.  When this error occurs, the machine stops and an audible alarm warns the operator to correct the problem.
</P><P>
IAS can solve your automation problem too.<IMG SRC="img/guysan3.jpg" ALIGN="MIDDLE">

The Spindle LoadMeter measures the amount of work-load on a motor.  If the load becomes too great, a motor can quickly burn out when it stalls.  The Spindle Loadmeter displays the amount of load for a spindle motor in percentage of full load.  When the load passes one hundred percent, the display turns red to indicate to the operator that the motor is undergoing extreme stress.  When the operator sees the indicator become red, appropriate action can be taken to increase the amount of drive power to the spindle

Pri-corder 8a
</CENTER>
</H1><H4>
What is it?
</H4><P>
The Pri-corder 8a is a device which converts an Epson compatible printer into an eight channel chart recorder.  Use either color or monochrome printers, the Pri-corder 8a supports both.  
</P><H4>
How do I use it?
</H4><P>
Plug your printer into the printer port on the back, using your existing printer cable.  Plug in one of several signal conditioning modules into the signal port on the back.  Plug in the wall transformer power supply (included).  That's all there is to it!
</P><H4>
Why would I want it?
</H4><P>
If you are currently considering getting a chart recorder, you have already seen that they are moderately expensive devices, starting at around six hundred dollars.  The Pri-corder 8a allows you to make use of an existing yet underutilized asset, namely, your old 9-pin printer.  Even if you do not have a printer, the total purchase of a cheap printer and the Pri-corder 8a is still less than a comparable chart recorder.
</P><P>
Most chart recorders require special graph paper, which generally costs twice as much as plain printer paper.  The Pri-corder 8a prints it's own graph lines on plain paper, and can adjust the output measurement range without changing paper stock.
</P><H4>
What is a chart recorder?
</H4><P>
A chart recorder is a device which produces a printed graph of some measured attribute over time.  These graphs are then used for analysis, such as correlating temperature to air velocity.  A chart recorder automates the task of taking measurements every so often (so that you don't have to watch a gauge closely for several hours).
</P><P>
For example, we installed the Pri-corder 8a at a local seafood market, so that the owner could look over a chart of the temperatures in his freezers and coolers.  The chart showed that the temperature of his back cooler dropped at night, and increased during the early morning hours.  It never rose to a dangerous temperature, but this brought up the question of whether the refrigeration circuit was changing.  As it turned out, his employees were merely leaving the door partially open, allowing the heat to enter.
</P><H4>
Plug-in signal conditioning modules
</H4><P>
IAS currently offers the following signal conditioning modules for the Pri-corder 8a:
</P><UL>
<LI>
Universal - Adapt process signals to the pri-corder
</LI><LI>
Pri-therm - type K, N, and T thermocouple inputs
</LI><LI>
More coming soon!

Paper punch tape.  What a great way to store machine programs and tooling files.  Well, at least it was thirty years ago.  Today, with hard disks, abundant memory and a variety of archival storage methods, paper tape has become an archaic monstrosity.
</P><P>
Wouldn't it be better if a paper tape reel could be replaced by a three and a half inch disk?  Or what about having a network interface card that could access any part program instantly?  That would be great wouldn't it?
</P><P>
<IMG SRC="img/btrex1.jpg" ALIGN="RIGHT">We thought so too.  So we developed the BTR-EX 10.  This device is a small unit which takes the place of a paper tape reader inside a numeric control.  It interfaces directly to the tape reader wiring, so no expensive adapter cards are necessary.
</P><P>
Dual  keypads and a 4 x 40 character LCD allow the operator to view and edit loaded programs.  The BTR-EX 10 stores as many as ten programs simultaneously, up to 120 kilobytes total.  The unit receives programs via a serial interface to a central computer (no, not a mainframe, just a plain vanilla PC).
</P><P>
When combined with our Fast-Net file transfer software, the BTR-EX 10 can totally eliminate the need for paper tape libraries.  Think about it.  No more searching through stacks of plastic canisters.  No more rustling through boxes of rolled tapes.  When you're done thinking, call us.  We'll set you free.

<H1>Report: Gulf War panel blasts Pentagon for 'ineptitude'</H1>

<H3>Clinton may extend probe into veterans' illnesses</H3>

</P>

<P>
WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A commission examining unexplained 
illnesses afflicting Persian Gulf War veterans has sent 
President Clinton a scathing review of its findings in which 
the panel accuses the Pentagon of "ineptitude and 
indifference in its investigation," according to CBS News.
</P>
<IMG SRC="gulf.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT ALT="U.S. soldiers" WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="150" BORDER="0" HSPACE="10" VSPACE="5">
<P>
A medical expert who is a member of the commission criticized 
the Pentagon for the way it investigated the cause of 
veterans' ailments, but he stopped short of accusing the 
Pentagon of a cover-up.
</P>

<P>
However, CBS said Friday the panel concluded that the 
Pentagon "did not take seriously reports U.S. troops had been 
exposed to chemical weapons." 
</P>

<P>
The Presidential Advisory Committee on Gulf War Veterans' 
Illnesses is to release its report on Tuesday.
</P>


<h3>Veterans' victory? </H3>


<P>
Meanwhile, commission member Arthur Caplan, a medical
ethicist at the University of Pennsylvania, spoke on the 
record with The Associated Press. He said the panel concluded 
that no single agent causing the illnesses could be 
identified.  But it also found that stress and other factors 
have not been adequately studied by the Pentagon. 
</P>
<IMG SRC="explosion.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT alt="explosion" WIDTH="174" HEIGHT="174" BORDER="0" HSPACE="10" VSPACE="-5">
<P>
Other factors, Caplan said, include low-level chemical 
exposure as well as the interactive effects of pesticides, 
oil fires, stress and other situations soldiers might have 
been exposed to during the 1991 war against Iraq. 
</P>

<P>
In what would be a victory for Gulf War veterans, Caplan said 
the panel has called for outside oversight. Veterans have 
long sought an independent investigation into the cause of 
their ailments. 
</P>

<P>
"There are questions about how aggressive earlier (Pentagon) 
efforts have been. There's some mistrust, so external 
accountability is going to be crucial," Caplan said.
</P>

<P>
A White House official, speaking on condition of 
anonymity, said President Clinton plans to extend the work of 
the commission.
</P>



<H3>Investigative continuity needed</h3>



<P>
Of four possible chemical weapons releases, the CIA has
said only one could have exposed U.S. troops to hazardous
agents: the March 1991 destruction of Iraqi rockets in an 
open pit at a site called Kamisiyah.
</P>

<P>
Many veterans have reported a variety of unexplained 
illnesses, such as memory loss, 
fatigue, diarrhea and insomnia. Some blame the ailments on 
exposure to Iraqi chemical weapons.
</P>

<P>
"It makes some sense to maintain continuity between what 
we've been doing and future oversight," Caplan said. "There's 
no sense in starting from scratch." 
</P>

<P>
He added that the commission, created in May 1995, may exist 
in some altered form or with new members if the president 
indeed extends its investigation.

ASSISTANT DIRECTOR FOR GULF WAR VETERANS<BR>
VETERANS AFFAIRS AND REHABILITATION COMMISSION<BR>
THE AMERICAN LEGION<BR>
<FONT SIZE=+1>TO THE<BR>
<B>THE JOINT SENATE VETERANS' AFFAIRS COMMITTEE</B><BR>
<B>SUBCOMMITTEE ON HUMAN RESOURCES AND INTERGOVERNMENTAL RELATIONS</B></FONT><BR>
UNITED STATES HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES<BR>
<BR>DECEMBER 10, 1996</FONT></CENTER>
<BR><BR>

<P><B>Mr. Chairman and members of the Subcommittee:</B></P>

<P>The American Legion commends you on convening the Subcommittee's fifth hearing investigating Gulf War veterans' Illnesses and associated issues.  Your leadership and dedication to sick veterans and their families is noteworthy.  These hearings have helped to keep this issue in the public awareness, and have asked important questions of senior government officials that need to be answered.  The American Legion looks forward to your continued investigation in the next Congress, where we are convinced it will continue to hold the federal government accountable for sick Persian Gulf veterans and their families.</P>

<P>Mr. Chairman, congressional oversight has played a major role convincing VA and DoD that Gulf War veterans are sick.  Now, Congress must ensure that VA and DoD will provide quality health care for sick veterans and determine whether a congressionally appointed commission, with subpoena powers, is necessary to investigate U.S. troops exposure to chemical and biological warfare agents in the Persian Gulf.  DoDs superficial investigation has severely undermined their credibility, and it has violated the trust and confidence of sick veterans, their families and the American public.</P>

<P>The federal government currently recognizes that tens of thousands of Gulf War veterans are suffering from poor health, and its response has grown exponentially over the last several years.  To date, over 80,000 Gulf War veterans have been examined as part of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Persian Gulf Health Registry, and the Department of Defense's (DoD) Comprehensive Clinical Evaluation Program.  VA and DoD now also provide health care for symptomatic Gulf War veterans.  Over 70 federally funded scientific and clinical studies are underway, or will begin next year, that will examine many of the risk factors present in the Persian Gulf that may have lead to illness today in Gulf War veterans.  These efforts, which were mandated by Congress, require Congressional oversight in order to become more effective.</P>

<P>There are several specific programs of VAs and DoD's, the two lead agencies of the federal government on Gulf war veterans illnesses, that need to be investigated by Congress.  This investigation should be conducted with the goal of making these programs more effective.</P>

<P><B>VA and DoD Health Care for Sick Gulf War Veterans</B></P>

<P>How effective is the health care being offered to sick Gulf War veterans?  Do Gulf War veterans feel better after they seek care from VA and DoD?  Many sick Gulf War veterans who seek care from the government do not receive a diagnosis.  Neither agency has formally measured outcomes in symptomatic Gulf War veterans and compared those outcomes with results in the private health care system.  The comparison is important: not only should VA and DoD measure the effectiveness of their health care, they should compare it to the effectiveness of health care provided in the private sector.</P>

<P><B>Tissue/Serum Sampling and CBW Exposures</B></P>

<P>Reports from the United Nations, and the Pentagon, state that U.S. troops in the Gulf were possibly exposed to chemical warfare agents.  As a result of a recent U.N. report concerning Iraqs biological warfare program and the Iraqi weaponization of aflatoxin, a biological warfare agent, the Pentagon now admits that it does not know for certain whether service personnel were exposed to biological warfare agents.  In light of these new revelations, The American Legion believes that tissue from symptomatic Gulf War veterans should be collected and stored until biological markers can be identified to determine whether sick veterans were exposed chemical and biological warfare agents; especially from those within 50 kilometers of the Khamisiyah ammunition bunker.  Studies will soon be underway to determine whether exposure to low levels of nerve and mustard agents can cause long term illness.  The missing piece of the puzzle is exposure data which would help researchers determine dose levels.  In other words, no one knows how much of these agents U.S. troops were exposed to in the Gulf, or in the case of aflatoxin, whether they were exposed at all.  Tissue sampling, if conducted soon, and in a thoughtful manner, could help answer this question.</P>

<P>The American Legion believes tissue sampling may be a key in resolving this issue.  Tissue samples were not collected from Vietnam veterans exposed to Agent Orange until a biological marker for dioxin was isolated in 1988.  By then, it was too late to determine dose levels in Vietnam veterans because it had been so long since their exposure.  Had tissue been collected and frozen immediately following the war, these samples could have been thawed in 1988 and analyzed.  Medical doctors and Vietnam veterans could have learned the level of their exposure to dioxin during the war.  Vietnam veterans, however, will never know.  The American Legion and Vietnam veterans have learned a hard lesson from the Agent Orange tragedy on the issue of tissue samples.  Biological markers for chemical and biological agents encountered in the Persian Gulf may be isolated soon, or not, perhaps, for many years.  We must, however, collect tissue samples today.</P>

<P><B>Persian Gulf Undiagnosed Illness Claims</B></P>

<P>Three reports, including one prepared by The American Legion, found flaws in the adjudication of VA disability compensation claims for Gulf War veterans who did not receive a diagnosis from a VA medical doctor, VA undertook a review of over 11,000 claims.  VA has recently reopened all of these claims, and is seeking evidence from these veterans so it can reconsider the claims.  VA should be commended on this effort.  However, The American Legion would like to recommend that Congress conduct oversight to assess this review.  Congress should also ask VA to assess how many Gulf War veterans who are sick as a result of their service in the Persian Gulf, were denied compensation because their illness became manifest outside the two year presumptive period established by VA.  The two year period was arrived at arbitrarily, and should be expanded if it is denying veterans the compensation that they deserve.  In congressional testimony and in a letter to the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, The American Legion expressed its concern about the two year presumptive period and urges Congress to examine this issue.</P>

<P><B>Investigation of Exposures to Chemical and Biological Weapons</B></P>

<P>The American Legion believes that DoD cannot investigate itself concerning the issue of chemical and biological warfare agent exposures and incidences during the Persian Gulf War.  Missing logs; slow release of information; repeated denials for several years in the face of overwhelming evidence; all have combined to undermine the credibility of DoD.  DoD's current efforts, and devotion of resources, are impressive, and appear sincere.  However, The American Legion would like to remind this Subcommittee that these current efforts, like past DoD efforts are the result of immense pressure from Congress, the Presidential Advisory Committee on Persian Gulf War Veterans Illnesses, The American Legion and sick Persian Gulf veterans.  DoD views the Khamisiyah announcement as a "watershed event," and it appears to be pursuing the Presidents call to "leave no stone unturned." It would be of great benefit to DoD, and the federal government as a whole, however, if a congressionally appointed independent commission, with subpoena powers, conducted this investigation.  This is especially true since new revelations everyday continue to undermine DoDs credibility.</P>

<P>The American Legion is also disturbed by the recent revelation from DoD that classified materials concerning possible deployment, exposures and incidences regarding chemical and biological warfare agents has been lost.  Mr. Chairman, this is of great concern because the loss of classified information is a criminal offense under the National Security Act (Title 18, United States Code, section 739).</P>

<P>Too much is at stake.  The shine of the great victory in the Gulf has been tarnished by bureaucratic bumbling at best, or a deliberate effort to conceal the truth at worst.  Only independent investigators with subpoena powers and without a vested interest can vouch for the accuracy of any final report from DoD. We all want to see DoD succeed in restoring its credibility.  This is how they can do it.</P>

<P><B>U.S. Preparedness to Fight a Chemical and Biological War</B></P>

<P>The evidence from before, during, and after the Gulf War suggest that the U.S. military is woefully unprepared to fight an adversary armed with such weapons.  The Department of Defense must devote more planning and resources into developing strategies and equipment that alert and protect our troops against these evil weapons.  More importantly, DoD should consider changes in the militarys warfighting doctrine regarding the protection and detection of sub-acute levels of chemical and biological warfare agents.  The American Legion believes that the inadequacy of U.S. forces to effectively protect and detect military personnel from low level chemical and biological warfare agent exposures represents a serious national security issue which must be addressed.</P>

<P><B>DoD's Use of Investigational Drugs</B></P>

<P>With some studies suggesting pyridostigmine bromide's (Pb) role in Gulf War veteran's illnesses and many more underway that are investigating Pb's role, DoD should immediately end the use of Pb as a nerve agent prophylactic.  The American Legion would also like to urge Congress to conduct oversight on DoDs efforts to implement accountability procedures regarding the distribution, record keeping  and tracking of inoculations and use of investigational drugs for future conflicts.</P>

<P><B>Depleted Uranium</B></P>

<P>Thousands of DU munitions were fired, or set on fire, in the Persian Gulf.  DU is a radioactive, and chemically toxic material, and thousands of Gulf War veterans were exposed to DU particles before, and after, the war.  Although its relation to the current illnesses is unknown, DoD has not properly investigated whether or not DU could cause short, or long term illness of veterans exposed to this material.  The American Legion also believes that DoDs efforts to investigate DU exposures is inadequate; especially since DU ammunition was widely used in the Persian Gulf War and will continue to be used in future conflicts.</P>

<P><B>Presidential Advisory Committee on Gulf War Veterans' Illnesses Final Report</B></P>

<P>The American Legion would urge Congress to recognize the Presidential Advisory Committee on Gulf War Veterans Illnesses (PAC) and ensure that all of the recommendations of the PAC Final Report, due out this month, are implemented by the federal government.  The American Legion believes that the PAC was instrumental in forcing DoD to reconsider its position on various issues, especially with regards to chemical and biological warfare agent exposures.</P>

<P>Mr. Chairman, legislation, appropriations, and federal regulations allow the federal government to care and compensate Gulf War veterans, and require it to seek the cause for their illnesses.  However, oversight is the tool that will ensure VA and DoD fulfill these mandates and resolve these issues.  Mr. Chairman, The American Legion and sick Persian Gulf veterans and their families truly appreciate your leadership on this issue and strongly urge you and your colleagues to continue your efforts in the 105th Congress.  This concludes my testimony.</P>

<p> 
<center><h3> COULD GULF WAR VETERANS NOW BE MAKING LOVED ONES SICK?</h3>
<p>
   THAT TROUBLING QUESTION.. AS WE CONCLUDE OUR SPECIAL REPORT ON GULF WAR
ILLNESSES.
<p>
   INVESTIGATIVE REPORTER TOM COBIN <br>
Stated that the controversial theory is that gulf war forces were poisened with BIOLOGICAL
WEAPONS....... That idea..  from a respected researcher..(Garth Nicolson, Ph.D.)..who says he's found a link
between GULF WAR ILLNESS.. AND AIDS.</center>
<p>
<hr size="1">
<p>
THE U-S FINALLY ADMITTED THIS YEAR.. GULF WAR SOLDIERS MAY HAVE BEEN EXPOSED TO
CHEMICALS FROM THE DESTRUCTION OF IRAQI WEAPONS. THE PENTAGON STILL INSISTS
THERE'S NO EVIDENCE CHEMICAL OR BIOLOGICAL WEAPONS WERE USED AGAINST COALITION
FORCES.
<p>
Interview:  NICOLSON
<p>
((The veterans we are helping are getting better.))
<p>
BUT RESEARCHER GARTH NICOLSON SAYS HE DID MORE THAN 170 BLOOD TESTS ON SICK
VETS AND IMMEDIATE FAMILY. HE CLAIMS HALF HAD AN ORGANISM CALLED, "MYCOPLASMA
INCOGNITUS," DISCOVERED ONLY 10 YEARS AGO IN AIDS PATIENTS.. AND APPARENTLY
SPREAD THROUGH THE AIR.
<p>

((Garth Nicolson, Ph.D./RESEARCHER: This is an illness that is moderately
infectious. It has a long latency, a long time before the clinical signs and
symptoms become apparent.)) 
<p>
NICOLSON SAYS HE HAS IDENTIFIED A GENE FROM THE VIRUS THAT CAUSES AIDS, THE
H-I-V ENVELOPE GENE.. ON THE MYCOPLASMA. HE SAYS IT'S THAT GENE THAT WOULD
ENABLE THE MYCOPLASMA, OR THE H-I-V VIRUS.. TO INVADE OTHER CELLS.

<p>
((This suggests that this might have been a <font color="red">microorganism that was tampered
with by man</font>.))
<p>
THE DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS SAYS.. NICOLSON'S RESULTS ARE INTERESTING..
BUT PRELIMINARY.
<p>
Comments from the VA:
<p>
((Dr. Frances Murphy/DEPT. OF VETERANS AFFAIRS: We think that they at this
point do not prove that any of the persian gulf veterans illnesses are due to
mycoplasma.))
<p>

THERE ARE PLENTY OF POTENTIAL CAUSES OF GULF WAR ILLNESS.. LIKE PESTICIDES,
WHICH CAN PRODUCE NERVE DAMAGE WHEN COMBINED WITH PYRIDOSTYGMINE BROMIDE, THE
EXPERIMENTAL ANTI-NERVE AGENT PILL GIVEN TO U-S TROOPS. ALSO CONSIDER: NOXIOUS
FUMES FROM OIL WELL FIRES.. OR, INFECTIOUS PARASITES. THE GOVERNMENT SAYS
VETERANS SUFFER TOO MANY DIFFERENT PROBLEMS.. TO IDENTIFY A SINGLE "SYNDROME."
SO WHY DID AN ARMY DOCTOR TELL VIRGINIA BEACH VET TED MYERS.. HIS DIAGNOSIS WAS
"GULF WAR SYNDROME?" THE V-A CALLS IT A POOR CHOICE OF WORDS.
<p>
The VA continues:
<p>

((It conveys the sense that there is a single gulf-related illness.)) 
<p>
Conclude Summary:
<p> 
  IT REMAINS UNCLEAR WHETHER THIS MYCOPLASMA IS THE ROOT CAUSE OF GULF WAR
ILLNESSES, OR SIMPLY ONE MORE INFECTION THAT ATTACKS AN IMMUNE SYSTEM ALREADY
WEAKENED BY SOMETHING ELSE.
   RESEARCHERS SAY THEY'D LIKE NICOLSON TO PUBLISH DETAILS OF HIS RESEARCH, TO
SEE IF IT CAN BE VERIFIED.
<p>
   BUT IT DOES APPEAR CERTAIN ANTIBIOTICS CAN RETURN PATIENTS INFECTED WITH
MYCOPLASMA.. TO NORMAL HEALTH.

<H1>Gulf War Syndrome report might need revision, scientist says</H1>

<P>
NEW YORK (AP) -- The Pentagon didn't tell a scientific panel 
investigating Gulf War Syndrome about an explosion at an 
Iraqi ammunition depot where chemical weapons were believed 
to have been stored, the scientist who led the study says.
</P>

<P>
Joshua Lederberg, a Nobel Prize-winning geneticist, said the 
1994 report that discounted links between chemical weapons 
and illnesses reported by some Gulf War veterans might have 
to be revised, The New York Times reported Tuesday.
</P>

<P>
The Defense Department had cited the Pentagon study for more 
than two years while insisting there was no evidence U.S. 
troops had been exposed to Iraqi nerve gas or other chemical 
weapons.
</P>

<P>
Then earlier this year, the government said thousands of 
troops may have been exposed to the nerve gas sarin when Army 
engineers blew up the Kamisiyah ammunition depot in southern 
Iraq shortly after the war's end.
</P>

<P>
Lederberg, a former president of Rockefeller University, said 
the Defense Department had not told him about the March 1991 
explosion before the report was written.
</P>

<P>
"We didn't get all the information, and I don't know where it 
was," Lederberg said.
</P>

<P>
Bryan Whitman, a Pentagon spokesman, said no information had 
been withheld from Lederberg or his Defense Science Task 
Force on Persian Gulf War Health Effects.
</P>

<P>
"They had full access to everything," Whitman told the Times.
</P>

<P>
But Lederberg said the Pentagon also failed to tell the panel 
that Czech soldiers who had detected chemical weapons during 
the war had been so concerned about the possibility of 
exposure that they immediately pulled on protective 
equipment, while American soldiers remained unprotected.
</P>

<P>
"'Un-lead' is probably a better word than 'mislead,'" 
Lederberg told the Times when asked why he thought the 
Pentagon had not shared some of the information.
</P>

<P>
"I know what a complex organization we're dealing with, how 
many different turfs there are," he said. "The intelligence 
units in particular are very jealous of anything they hold. 
They particularly defy access to their raw data. It's not 
surprising that there are goof-ups of this sort from time to 
time."
</P>

<P>
Since the war, many veterans have reported serious ailments, 
including chronic digestive problems, joint pain and fatigue. 
Lederberg said researchers should carefully examine whether 
low doses of nerve gas could cause long-term illnesses.
</P>

<p>	Hello.  As you can see from the title of this site my name is Zak.  
This page is designed to give you some background info about myself.  I
am a junior majoring in Information systems attending Old Dominion University 
in Norfolk VA.  I graduate in Spring of 1999 hopefully.  My roomate and 
myself wanted to start this site to talk about sports.  Since sports pretty
much rule our life and Chris Berman is our mentor,  we thought this would be 
great.  Little did we know that trying to design a creative yet informative 
page would be as time consuming as this.  We had hoped to be analyzing 
football right now but a few things still stand in our way.  We should have 
enough time over the Christmas break to finish the site.  Winter time is 
by far the worst time of the year; atleast here in Virginia Beach.

<center><h2> Panel Chief Says Agency Punishes Doctors for Speaking Out on Gulf Illnesses</h2>
</center>
<hr size=1>
<h5>By PHILIP SHENON</h5>
<p>   
<p> The lawmaker who has led the chief congressional
investigation of illnesses among veterans of the Persian Gulf War
accused the Department of Veterans Affairs on Friday of seeking to
purge the agency of doctors who publicly questioned the
government's stand on the issue.
<p>   The lawmaker, Rep. Christopher Shays, R-Conn., was responding to
reports this week that two doctors from the agency had been targets
for dismissal because they were outspoken in the view that some
veterans of the 1991 war had been made sick by exposure to Iraqi
chemical weapons or by an infectious agent endemic to the gulf.
<p>   "Anybody who comes forward is threatened with removal," said
Shays, the chairman of a House Human Resources subcommittee that
opened an aggressive investigation of gulf war illnesses last
March. "If you have a contrary view that maybe the Congress or the
public needs to hear, you are silenced."
<p>   While acknowledging that thousands of troops may have been
exposed to Iraqi nerve gas in the demolition of an ammunition depot
shortly after the war, the government has insisted that it has no
evidence that chemical weapons or infectious agents are linked to
the mysterious ailments reported by many veterans.
<p>   The Veterans Affairs Department insisted Friday that no doctors
were being punished for their views. Jule Moravec, a senior
department official who is a spokesman on the issue, said many
doctors throughout the Veterans Affairs system were being
transferred or let go as a result of budget cuts at many hospitals
and a move toward expanded out-patient care.
<p>   "It's a misconception to conclude that in reshaping this huge
organization of 200,000 people, that one or two are being
targeted," he said. "It's just so far from reality."
<p>   "To think that we're going to identify individuals and we're
going to go get them is really absurd," he said.
<p>   Still, department officials confirmed a report by the Gannett
News Service that one of the two doctors, Katherine Murray Leisure,
an infectious diseases specialist at the Veterans Affairs Medical
Center in Lebanon, Pa., had recently been informed that she was
being let go.
<p>   She was among the first doctors in the Veterans Affairs system
to note a pattern of health complaints among gulf war veterans, and
her work led to a study by the Centers for Disease Control that
documented striking differences in the health complaints of gulf
war veterans, compared with troops who were not deployed to the
gulf.
<p>   After protests from veterans' groups and members of Congress,
Dr. Leisure is expected to keep her position until at least next
spring. She did not return telephone calls Friday for comment.
<p>   The other doctor, William Baumzweiger, a psychiatrist and
neurologist at a Veterans Affairs clinic in Los Angeles, said in an
interview that he had been told he would be dismissed and that his
job was saved only through the recent intervention of Shays and two
other members of Congress.
<p>   He said in an interview that while he was retaining his job for
now, six of his colleagues in the neurology department at the
clinic were being dismissed this week in what Baumzweiger described
as an obvious effort to end the clinic's research on gulf war
illnesses.
<p>   "I'm the only one to survive the bloodbath," said Baumzweiger,
who treats dozens of gulf war veterans and has argued in testimony
on Capitol Hill that their health problems were probably the result
of exposure to low doses of Iraqi nerve gas during the war. "I've
obviously struck a nerve. If I were wrong, they'd ignore me."
<p>   Baumzweiger, who has worked for the Veterans Affairs department
since 1992, said his troubles with his superiors began after he
testified before Shays' subcommittee last September. "After that,
I was told I was in a lot of trouble," he said. "They told me
basically that it was their policy that there was no gulf war
syndrome. They told me that I was simply fabricating things."

<p></p>
<p>Study: Gulf War syndrome, viral infection may be linked
TAMPA, Florida (CNN) --<font size="-1"> A viral infection may help explain  
the mystery of so-called Gulf War Syndrome, according to new 
research.
</P> 
<P>
A microbiologist reported finding a certain genetic material 
in about 80 percent of Gulf War-era soldiers tested, compared 
with a rate of just 5 percent in the general population.
</P>
<P>
"We found a fragment, a piece of a virus, that's floating in 
the blood of Gulf War veterans, and it's not in the general 
population," said Dr. Howard Urnovitz, of Berkeley, 
California.
</P>
<P>
Urnovitz, who has been researching Gulf War syndrome for two 
years, also tested eight veterans not deployed to the Gulf. 
All showed the same genetic material, but did not develop 
syndrome symptoms.
</P>
<P>
That may imply most or all of the soldiers may have picked up 
the suspected virus before their deployment, then something 
in the Gulf triggered their illnesses.
</P>
<P>
Specifically, Urnovitz said he found unique genetic bands in 
29 of 36 Gulf War veterans from California and Arkansas, as 
well as in eight Arkansas veterans who did not serve in the 
region. A random selection of 22 civilians found the band in 
only one person.
</P>
<P>
Military officials declined to comment on Urnovitz's study 
until it could be analyzed.
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon recently conceded the destruction of an 
ammunition depot at Khamisiyah, Iraq, in March 1991 may have 
exposed more than 15,000 troops to nerve gas.
</P>
<P>
Veterans Affairs Dr. Robert Roswell said he doubts chemical 
exposure caused most of the Gulf War illnesses, and said the 
Urnovitz findings need further examination.
</P>
<P>
"It's important that much larger numbers be evaluated before 
we can draw even preliminary conclusions from such a study," 
Roswell said.
</P>
<P>
Urnovitz said symptoms found in veterans -- fatigue, memory 
loss and respiratory problems -- are similar to those in what 
he called epidemic fatigue syndromes, viral infections that 
have struck in industrial areas.
</P>
<P>
Estimates vary, but veterans' groups claim at least 70,000  
Gulf War vets suffer from the mystery symptoms.
</P>
<P>
Urnovitz presented his findings Monday to the National Gulf 
War Resource Center's conference in Tampa, Florida.

<P>
WASHINGTON (CNN) --  U.S. soldiers who operated chemical 
weapons detection units during the Persian Gulf War were 
scheduled to tell Congress Tuesday about several incidents in 
which chemical alerts were issued, then later classified as 
"false alarms" by commanders.
</P>

<P>
The testimony came as the Pentagon released records of some 
20 detections by sophisticated equipment both during 
and after the war. In all cases, the Pentagon said, further 
review and follow-up tests either failed to confirm the 
presence of chemical agents or were otherwise inconclusive.

<P>
The Pentagon received the records on magnetic tape from 
congressional investigators, who, sources said, got them from 
Gulf War veterans.  The Army has had the records since 
December 1993, but said the tapes were 
"inconclusive" because they did not contain dates, locations, 
or any follow-up analysis of the detections.
</P>

<P>
Marine Gunnery Sgt. George Grass is one of three chemical 
weapons specialists scheduled to testify about 
incidents in which equipment detected "a lethal vapor 
concentration" of a chemical agent, suspected to be mustard 
gas.
</P>

<P>
Grass has testified before, both to Congress and the 
Presidential Advisory Committee of Gulf War Illness. The 
Pentagon says that while his testimony "cannot be 
discounted," the judgment of commanders on the scene was that 
the readings were false alarms.
</P>

<P>
The Pentagon has notified some 20,000 troops who participated 
in the destruction of Iraqi munition stockpiles of the 
possibility they may have been exposed to minute amounts of 
chemical agents. 
</P>

<P>
In June, officials announced that chemical 
weapons were present at the Kamisiyah weapons storage 
facility in southern Iraq. U.S. troops blew up ammunition 
stored there in March 1991.
</P>

<P>
Many Gulf War veterans have reported serious ailments, 
including chronic digestive problems, joint pain and fatigue 
-- symptoms that have been loosely categorized as Gulf War 
Syndrome.
</P>

<P>
Tuesday's testimony is before the House Human Resources and 
Intergovernmental Relations Subcommittee, chaired by 
Rep. Christopher Shays, R-Connecticut.

<center><h1>Clinton to Prolong Panel Studying Gulf War Illness</h1>
<h2>Committee May Be Altered, Provide Oversight</h2></center>


Associated Press<br>


Sunday, January 5 1997<br>
 The Washington Post
<p>


<p>
President Clinton has decided to extend the life of a commission examining unexplained illness afflicting Persian <B>Gulf</B> <B>War</B> veterans, according to an administration official.<p>
Clinton planned to announce the extension Tuesday, when the panel releases its final report, the official said Friday. Clinton has been reading the report of the Presidential Advisory Committee on <B>Gulf</B> <B>War</B> Veterans' Illnesses while on vacation in St. Thomas in the Virgin Islands.<p>
In its report, the panel, which was created in May 1995, calls for independent oversight of the Pentagon's investigation into the cause of the veterans' ailments. The Defense Department has been criticized by veterans groups as not having pursued its probe as aggressively as the veterans wanted.<p>
"There are questions about how aggressive earlier efforts have been. There's some mistrust, so external accountability is going to be crucial," said commission member Arthur Caplan, a medical ethicist at the University of Pennsylvania.<p>
Clinton's decision to extend the panel's life is likely in reaction to the report's call for outside oversight, Caplan said. "It makes some sense to maintain continuity between what we've been doing and future oversight," he said. "There's no sense in starting from scratch."<p>
Caplan said he was told the commission would be extended, although it may exist in some altered form or with new members. The commission was to dissolve after issuing its final report.<p>
The report concludes that stress and other factors have not been adequately studied as the Pentagon tries to determine the cause of veteran illnesses. Other factors include low-level chemical exposure as well as the interactive effects of pesticides, oil fires, stress and other things soldiers might have been exposed to, Caplan said.<p>
In language agreed to by the panel in November, the report also concluded that no single agent causing the illnesses could be identified.<p>
<B>Gulf</B> <B>War</B> veterans have reported a variety of unexplained illnesses, such as memory loss, fatigue, diarrhea and insomnia. Some blame the ailments on exposure to Iraqi chemical weapons.<p>

<center><h1>The Gulf Between `Syndrome' and Poison Gas</h1></center>

<em>By David Brown</em>

<p>Thursday, January 2 1997
 
<p>
<p>
The theory that many veterans of the Persian <B>Gulf</B> <B>War</B> are ill because they were unwittingly exposed to nerve gas more than five years ago contradicts most of what's known about the health effects of chemical weapons.<p>
Such a scenario is unlikely because nerve gases almost always cause immediate symptoms in people who encounter them, and almost never cause permanent damage to those who survive. There is even less evidence they can cause illnesses that first appear months after contact.<p>
Those are the conclusions suggested by three decades of research on nerve gases, and affirmed by many scientists familiar with the chemical compounds and their effects.<p>
"Based on what we know about low-level exposure to this type of chemical, one would be very hard pressed to make that connection [between veterans' illnesses and gas exposure]," said John A. Thomas, president of the American College of Toxicology and a professor at the Health Science Center of the University of Texas in San Antonio.<p>
The current knowledge about chemical weapons does not jibe with widespread assertions by some veterans groups, politicians and commentators that thousands of veterans are chronically ill from exposure to poison gases during the Persian <B>Gulf</B> <B>War</B>.<p>
Those assertions in recent months have led the Defense Department to create a 110-person "task force" to investigate possible poison gas releases in the <B>gulf</B>. Two congressional committees plan to hold hearings on the issue this year. Some veterans organizations say they will push for further research on the effects of low-dose exposure to chemical weapons, which they believe may be causing the physical complaints known popularly as "<B>Gulf</B> <B>War</B> Syndrome."<p>
Almost since the <B>war</B> ended in 1991, reports of a mysterious illness -- characterized by mood changes, concentration problems, muscle pains, skin rashes, diarrhea and other complaints -- circulated among veterans. Some former soldiers, dissatisfied with their diagnoses and medical care, looked for a cause of the symptoms in the environmental hazards encountered in the <B>war</B> against Iraq.<p>
On that long list of hazards were smoke from oil fires, exotic infections, drugs and vaccines, depleted uranium used in projectiles -- and chemical weapons. Although the Pentagon studied each, for years military officials said chemical weapons could not directly explain any  illness a veteran might be suffering. That's because Iraq had not used chemical weapons. Except for one soldier who was accidentally exposed, no American troops were exposed to the toxic compounds, military officials said.<p>
Last June, however, the Defense Department amended its story.<p>
Investigators announced that thousands of soldiers may have been exposed to small amounts of poison gas when they blew up a munitions dump in Khamisiyah, Iraq, soon after the fighting stopped. It wasn't until months later that United Nations inspectors visiting the site learned that some of the missiles had contained chemical warfare agents. That information, passed on by the U.N. team, lay unnoticed in Pentagon files for years.<p>
The Khamisiyah revelation fueled many veterans' suspicions that the military was hiding information crucial to their health. This suspicion was bolstered by the Defense Department's acknowledgment, in various forums recently, that it had never thoroughly interviewed soldiers who had reported other possible exposures to poison gas.<p>
Furthermore, some veterans asserted that there were countless other "exposure events" besides the one Pentagon officials said might have occurred. According to one theory, the intense bombing of Iraqi military targets repeatedly sent poison gas into the atmosphere, creating a toxic fallout on the soldiers below.<p>
The idea that chemical weapons exposure caused <B>Gulf</B> <B>War</B> Syndrome rests on a number of assumptions. One is that there is, in fact, an unexpected amount of illness among veterans of the <B>Gulf</B> <B>War</B>. Another is that U.S. soldiers were actually -- as opposed to theoretically -- exposed to chemical weapons. Perhaps most important is the idea that nonfatal poisoning can cause the kind of health problems some veterans report.<p>
At the moment, however, none of those assumptions is proved. (None is disproved, either. But for reasons of logic, the second two assumptions can never be disproved: Research can never prove that something didn't or can't happen; only that it did, or that it can.)<p>
There are 104 government-funded studies, planned or underway, that seek to answer questions about the health of <B>Gulf</B> <B>War</B> veterans. A major part of that research is dedicated to investigating the long-term effects of "chemical hazards" soldiers may have faced in the <B>gulf</B>, including the hazards of poison gas.<p>
Nerve gases can cause symptoms that resemble some of the initial, relatively minor complaints some veterans have described. A small amount of research hints that the compounds could cause longer-lasting physiological changes. It is possible unexpected effects may be uncovered with further research.<p>
Current knowledge of these toxic chemicals, however, suggests it's highly unlikely they can cause health problems similar to those seen in <B>Gulf</B> <B>War</B> Syndrome.<p>
"There doesn't seem to be any plausible reason, nor does there seem to be good evidence, that at very low concentrations [of nerve agent] one would expect to see adverse health effects of the kind that are reported," said Lewis Smith, director of toxicology in Britain's Medical Research Council, and a longtime researcher in the field.<p>
Research on chemical weapons began immediately after the German army gassed the British on Dec. 19, 1915, at the Battle of Ypres, opening the era of chemical warfare. Scientists today have detailed knowledge about the chemistry and health effects of the five major types of chemical weapons: phosgene, arsenic, cyanide, mustard gas, and nerve agent.<p>
Iraq possessed the last two types. Although soldiers report detecting both in the Persian <B>Gulf</B>, most theories attribute chronic illness to nerve agent. This is, in part, because mustard gas is hard to miss. It kills cells and causes painful blisters on the skin, mouth and throat minutes after contact. No widespread symptoms consistent with mustard gas were reported in the <B>Gulf</B> <B>War</B>.<p>
In contrast, nerve agent in low doses causes symptoms -- runny nose, diarrhea, nausea -- that some soldiers said they experienced on the battlefield. Trace concentrations could theoretically have caused even more subtle (or overlooked) effects at the moment of exposure.<p>
Furthermore, because nerve agent (as its name suggests) alters nerve function, it's the poison more likely to alter mood and behavior over the long term, the kind of problems some veterans report.<p>
The nerve agents used as chemical weapons -- sarin, soman, tabun and VX -- are members of a large family of chemicals called "organophosphate cholinesterase inhibitors." Scientists understand their biological effects in great detail. They all drastically increase the "activity" of acetylcholine, an essential neurotransmitter in everything from insects to human beings.<p>
When a person is poisoned with organophosphates, the pupils constrict, muscles twitch, the person salivates, sweats and sometimes wheezes. Often there's nausea, vomiting and involuntary defecation. At higher doses, or with longer exposure, people have convulsions, lapse into unconsciousness, develop profoundly low blood pressure and stop breathing.<p>
Organophosphates are the most commonly used pesticides in the world, with hundreds of tons used every year by everyone from household exterminators to crop dusters. Unlike pesticides, however, the compounds designed as chemical weapons kill people and animals at extremely low doses. They're so potent that in practice there's little difference between the amount that causes sickness and the amount that causes death.<p>
This property has an important implication: It is difficult to get a response to nerve agents in a group of animals without making at least a few of them critically ill. This is true even under the most controlled laboratory conditions.<p>
If soldiers encountered nerve agents during the Persian <B>Gulf</B> <B>War</B>, the conditions would have been a far cry from those of a laboratory. The compounds would have been "delivered" imprecisely by the wind, contacting thousands of soldiers arrayed unequal distances from the exploded source of the poison. Under such circumstances, it's probable a few people would have received doses high enough to kill, or at least make them seriously ill. However, that does not seem to have happened.<p>
None of the 148 combat deaths of U.S. military personnel came from nerve gas poisoning, nor did any of the 145 off-battlefield deaths. Furthermore, there were no nonfatal injuries attributed to nerve agents, according to military medical records.<p>
Assuming however that gas released into the atmosphere actually came into contact with soldiers, the effects appear to have been unprecedented in their mildness and uniformity. There was no death, no serious illness, no moderate illness, perhaps some mild illness, and in most cases no illness at all.<p>
On the other hand, a more likely result would have been that seen in the best-studied, outdoor, mass exposure to nerve gas on record: a terrorist attack using sarin gas in Matsumoto, Japan.  <p>
On the night of June 27, 1994, wind blew nerve agent from the attack into a residential area of that city of 200,000 people. About 600 people were poisoned over several hours, with the physiological responses ranging across the entire spectrum of severity. Two-hundred fifty-three people consulted physicians, 56 were admitted to the hospital, four people died on the way to the hospital, and three were found dead.<p>
But did some American troops in the Persian <B>Gulf</B> exhibit the signs and symptoms of mild nerve gas poisoning? This seemingly straightforward question is a matter of great dispute.<p>
The Pentagon says no. Until recently (when intense criticism forced them to abandon the argument), military officials pointed to the total lack of definite cases of nerve gas poisoning as the best evidence against reports there had been mild cases. The latter, military authorities said, had to be something other than reaction to gas.<p>
The first rigorous compilation of possible "exposure events" was made by the staff of the Senate banking committee in 1994. That committee became involved, in part, because its chairman, then-Sen. Donald W. Riegle Jr. (D-Mich.), had received complaints of chronic illness from constituents who were veterans.<p>
James J. Tuite III and other banking committee staff members collected 16 accounts of times when missiles exploded, sirens sounded, strange smells were noticed, and symptoms such as itchy eyes and skin, runny noses and breathing problems were experienced by one or more soldiers.<p>
In a representative account, John Jacob, a mechanic with the 1st Infantry Division, told the committee staff that on Feb. 25, 1991, while riding in a vehicle in southern Iraq, he smelled something strange. "He recalled . . . a sudden burning in his throat and lungs, watery eyes, blurry vision and photosensitivity, nausea, dizziness and diarrhea," the staff wrote in its report. "He donned his mask and gloves, and sounded an  alarm."<p>
The Defense Department is investigating more than a dozen "credible" exposure events. However, it's difficult to sort out the cause of the symptoms Jacob and others describe. Traces of nerve gas could cause them, but so could the body's "fight-or-flight" response to battle, unknown environmental pollutants, and the drug pyridostigmine bromide.<p>
Pyridostigmine was given to soldiers sent to the Persian <B>Gulf</B> to protect them against the nerve agent soman. The drug binds to the acetylcholinesterase enzyme and temporarily "shields" it from irreversible damage by that nerve agent. Because of its chemical behavior, pyridostigmine's occasional side effects are similar to those of extremely low-dose nerve agent poisoning: diarrhea, nausea, breathing problems, salivation. These problems disappear in a few hours, as the body burns off the drug.<p>
The pills were distributed to the soldiers in blister packs. No records were kept of their use, which appears to have been highly variable. Some soldiers took them when they suspected a gas attack; others waited for instructions. Some took many doses; others only a few. Military authorities now estimate that about 250,000 service personnel took pyridostigmine at least once.<p>
It's unlikely that six years after the fact medical investigators will ever figure out what caused the runny noses, headaches and bouts of nausea some soldiers reported. But even if some are ultimately attributed to low-dose nerve agent exposure, there's little reason to believe they would be followed months later by a chronic disease.<p>
Research does show that long-lasting -- and possibly permanent -- changes sometimes occur in animals repeatedly exposed to nonfatal doses of nerve gas. These effects, however, do not always occur. And when they do, they are subtle and require sophisticated equipment to be found. More important, they're not illnesses in the common meaning of the term; the animals showing the changes are not sick in any obvious way.<p>
For example, rats given soman at doses that cause prostration or seizures sometimes showed subtle microscopic changes in their brains. Rhesus monkeys given the nerve agent at "symptomless" doses do worse than unpoisoned monkeys in a test of balance and dexterity. That problem, however, goes away within two days of stopping the poison. Even at doses that cause temporary physical collapse of the animal, the brain function returns to normal in three weeks.<p>
Acute poisoning by nerve gas causes characteristic changes in the brain wave, or electroencephalogram (EEG), tracings of human beings and other primates. In the 1970s, scientists at Harvard Medical School and Edgewood Arsenal, the Army's chemical weapons center, looked to see if these changes persisted over time.<p>
The researchers gave monkeys low doses of sarin once a week for 10 weeks, or a single dose that was large enough to cause seizures lasting more than an hour. Some of the animals had slightly abnormal EEG tracings for up to a year. Although the changes were of the sort sometimes associated with anxiety and memory problems, the animals did not behave abnormally. The same researchers found similar EEG changes in 77 men who had been exposed to sarin, in some cases multiple times, through industrial accidents.<p>
Although these findings are provocative, the conditions under which they occurred did not exist during the Persian <B>Gulf</B> <B>War</B>. The experiments either involved repeated exposures (often five to 10 times), or single exposures sufficient to cause immediate illness. Furthermore, despite the laboratory abnormalities, none of the animals was clearly ill. (The health of the sarin-exposed people was not addressed by the researchers.)<p>
In one of the few human experiments with nerve gas in recent decades, eight British soldiers volunteered to undergo low-dose sarin poisoning at a laboratory in Porton Down, England, in 1983 and 1984. The researchers found small changes in the electrical activity of muscle fibers. This lasted for up to 15 months in some cases. However, there was no muscle weakness or any other illness, and the changes eventually were reversed.<p>
There is, however, one report of a group of people exposed to nerve gas who developed symptoms quite similar to those of "<B>Gulf</B> <B>War</B> Syndrome." These were 129 Germans who worked in munitions factories in Berlin and Muenster between 1936 and 1945. They made many kinds of chemical weapons, including sarin and tabun, after the start of World <B>War</B> II. In 1963, a scientist named U. Spiegelberg reported on his examination of them.<p>
"The great majority of the examined persons showed persistently lowered vitality . . . headache, gastrointestinal and cardiovascular symptoms, premature decline in libido and potency, intolerance of alcohol, nicotine and medicines . . . [and] impression of premature aging," Spiegelberg wrote. Some also showed memory problems and mild dementia.<p>
This report contains no details about who was exposed to what, nor does it mention how often workers suffered sublethal exposures to the compounds. It also does not describe the underlying health and nutrition of the workers, which may not have been good during the <B>war</B> years. Because all had held their jobs at least two years (and some for as long as eight), the men's poison exposure almost certainly was far greater than any that might have occurred in the Persian <B>Gulf</B>. Despite those differences, this is the best evidence that the constellation of symptoms some veterans report could conceivably arise  from nerve gas.<p>
During the 1950s and 1960s, 1,116 American soldiers were exposed to low doses of nerve agent in Army experiments at Edgewood Arsenal. Frederick R. Sidell, a physician who worked at Edgewood for 31 years, said in a recent interview that he knows of no chronic, <B>Gulf</B> <B>War</B> Syndrome-like illness among those subjects. "I've not heard of any complaints about their health, and I worked at the institute where the complaints would have come," said Sidell, who retired last year.<p>
Even in recent decades, there were "dozens and dozens" of civilian workers at the arsenal who were accidentally exposed to sarin, some several times, he said. "I never heard one say a word that they had any effects of the agent," he said. "It was pretty much an ingrown community, and you'd think workers would have talked among themselves and complained if there had been problems. But there didn't seem to be any."<p>
Of course, it is possible sarin can cause long-term illness, and this fact simply has not been noticed yet.<p>
However, if that's the case, the long-term effect is one "that has not been seen in animal populations, and has not been seen in human populations, from this class of chemicals," said Palmer Taylor, chairman of the department of pharmacology at the University of California at San Diego, and an expert in this field.<p>
"It would have to be an action of sarin that is unique to sarin," he said, adding "it would be unlikely for such a unique property to exist."<p>
Pesticides, which touch far more people than nerve agents ever have, offer an indirect look at the question. Many scientists suspect those compounds, which are similar in some ways to nerve gas, can have subtle, long-term effects on human health. However, different studies have shown different effects, and the idea itself is far from proved.<p>
Among the abnormalities noted in some research are changes in mood, ability to concentrate, as well as minor sensation problems (such as decreased ability to sense vibration with the toes). In virtually all cases, however, the subjects had suffered poisonings severe enough to cause immediate illness. Many required overnight stays in the hospital.<p>
The issue of what may happen after truly "symptomless" exposure to organophosphates is even murkier. There are only a few studies of people whose jobs put them in frequent proximity to pesticides, but who had no history of being poisoned by them.<p>
Research on household bug exterminators and sheep farmers who periodically dip their animals in pesticide have found subtle abnormalities, or none. Importantly, these studies noted no constellation of brain, muscle, skin and intestinal problems that some veterans say they have gotten from far less frequent symptomless exposures.<p>
Are there long-term health effects from one or two exposures to doses of nerve gas too small to be noticed?<p>
A huge research program is gearing up to answer this question. Few biologists are willing to write off as impossible something that is merely unlikely. Nevertheless, many scientists would be surprised if it turns out that "<B>Gulf</B> <B>War</B> Syndrome" is the product of nerve gas poisoning that almost nobody suspected and, six years after the fact, nobody has proved actually happened.<p>
COMPARING SYMPTOMS<p>
     Nerve gas poisoning affects the body in ways that are understood and predictable. Symptoms begin within minutes of exposure and last hours, or in some cases days, in victims who do not die immediately. There is no firm evidence that nerve gas can cause long-lasting illness, like the symptoms of "<B>Gulf</B> <B>War</B> Syndrome." Some studies have demonstrated mild laboratory changes in some people exposed to the toxic compounds.<p>
Immediate effects of nerve gas exposure:<p>
Pinpoint pupils<p>
Headaches<p>
Impaired judgment<p>
Salivation<p>
Nausea and diarrhea<p>
Chest tightness and wheezing<p>
Muscle twitches<p>
Convulsions<p>
Death<p>
Long-term effects of nerve gas exposure:<p>
No symptoms or illnesses known for certain. <p>
Mild changes in the electrical activity of brain and muscle cells seen in some experiments.<p>
Symptoms of "<B>Gulf</B> <B>War</B> Syndrome":<p>
Mood changes <p>
Poor concentration<p>
Joint and muscle pain<p>
Skin rashes<p>
Diarrhea<p>
Complaints involving other organ systems<p>

<p>
<center><h2>Former Presidential Panel Staff Member Releases Report on possible Iraqi
biological weapons use during Gulf War</h2></center>
<p>
Dr. Jonathan B. Tucker, a former member of the staff of the Presidential
Advisory Committee on Gulf War Veterans Illnesses, has today released a
report indicating that Iraq may have used a biological weapon against
American forces at the Saudi port of Jubayl in January, 1991, during the
Persian Gulf War.
<p>
Dr. Tucker, whose story appears in todays edition of the New York Times, is
currently director of chemical and biological weapons proliferation issues at
the Center for Nonproliferation Studies, located at the Monterey Institute of
International Studies. Tuckers report concludes that Iraq may have used
trichothecene mycotoxin, a form of biological agent, against American forces
stationed at the Saudi port of Jubayl during the early morning hours of
January 19th, 1991.
<p>
Former CIA analyst Patrick Eddington praised Tuckers work. Dr. Tuckers
meticulously documented findings clearly suggest that Iraq employed a weapon
of mass destruction against American forces during the Gulf War. Deterrence
failed, and our troops paid the price.
<p>
Dr. Tuckers monograph, entitled Mycotoxins and Gulf War Illness: A Possible
Link, has been published exclusively by Insignia Publishing Company, a
Washington, D.C.-based publisher specializing in national security and
foreign policy related publications. Earlier this year, Insignia reposted
over 300 intelligence documents which the Central Intelligence Agency had
attempted to reclassify. Dr. Tuckers monograph may be viewed at

<center><h1>Mycotoxins and Gulf War Illness: A Possible Link</h1></center>

<h3>by Jonathan B. Tucker, Ph.D.</h3>


<ul>

<p>A tantalizing unsolved mystery of the Persian Gulf War took place on the early morning of January 19, 1991, the third day of the Coalition air campaign against Iraq.  Nearly 750 construction specialists (Seabees) with the 24th Naval Mobile Construction Battalion were housed in two camps near the port of Al Jubayl in northern Saudi Arabia.  Camp 13, also known as Camp Rohrbach, was situated west of the commercial port, while a smaller Air Detachment was located south of the port, at King Abdul Aziz Naval Air Station.

<p>At about 3:00 AM on the morning of January 19, a brilliant flash of red light appeared in the cloud-covered sky over the port of Al Jubayl.  The flash was followed by a loud double-explosion and a shockwave powerful enough to knock over tents at Camp 13 and awaken the sleeping troops.  According to one eyewitness, "The concussion was so strong that it knocked me to my knees." [1]

<p>Almost immediately, the general-quarters alarm began to sound.  Thomas Harper, communications chief for the Air Detachment, heard a warning message come over the camp radio net: "Alpha 6 Bravo [the units call sign], we have a confirmed chemical agent."  The radio then broadcast a message to all stations ordering the troops to don their gas masks and chemical-protective suits and proceed to bunkers.  There was also a call for chemical decontamination teams. [2]

<p>Near-panic broke out as the Seabees struggled to pull on their masks and rubberized suits.  As the troops emerged from their tents and ran to the bunkers, they smelled a sharp, acrid odor and saw a dense yellowish mist floating over the camp.  Many individuals did not mask in time or failed to achieve a good seal.  They began to choke, and a few had profuse nasal secretions that fouled their masks.  Fred Willoughby felt his mouth, lips, and face go numb, a sensation similar to Novocain at a dentists office.  Roy Morrow and Nick Roberts experienced a burning sensation on their exposed skin and a strange metallic taste, "like sucking on a penny." [3]

<p>A half-hour later, the all-clear sounded.  The Seabees emerged from the bunkers and ran to the water buffaloes to wash their burning skin, which had become red and inflamed.  Although many troops were convinced they had been exposed to a chemical attack, their commanding officers told them the explosion had been the "sonic boom" of a jet fighter passing overhead and ordered them to stop discussing the incident and return to barracks.  Radio operators in the command bunkers were later ordered to burn their log pages covering the period of the incident. [4]

<p>When the sun rose later that morning, Nick Roberts observed a thin coating of yellow powder on tents and vehicles.  Other Seabees noticed that an area near the entrance to the commercial port of Jubayl had been cordoned off with yellow hazard tape, and that a fenced-in herd of animals nearby had died.  Later that day, the battalions chemical officers collected each soldiers chemical-protective suit and replaced it with a new one, the only time such a gear exchange took place during the war.  Because of a shortage of equipment, routine replacement of chemical suits was extremely rare during the Gulf War, if it occurred at all.

<p>Within a few days after the mysterious double-explosion, those Seabees who had experienced burning skin, facial numbness, and choking began to suffer from flu-like symptoms, including fever, sweating, diarrhea, and muscle cramps and spasms.  Areas of skin that had been exposed during the incident broke out in rashes, welts, and small blisters, which eventually burst and turned into ulcerating sores that scabbed over and healed but later recurred.  The Seabees joints also began to ache, and the pain became progressively worse.  Several developed painfully swollen lymph nodes.

<p>For many of those affected, the symptoms have persisted ever since.  According to a telephone survey conducted by <i>The New York Times</i> in September 1996, of 152 veterans of the 24th Naval Mobile Construction Battalion who were contacted, 114 said they were sick with chronic illnesses they attributed to the war.  The symptoms they reported were strikingly consistent: chronic diarrhea, joint pain, muscle spasms, mysterious tumors and skin rashes, chronic fatigue, recurrent headaches, and memory loss.  Dozens of veterans said they had been hospitalized repeatedly and had been forced to give up their jobs and careers. [5]  Nick Roberts has been diagnosed with non-Hodgkins lymphoma, a cancer of the lymphatic system, and he claims that several other Seabees who served at Al Jubayl have developed lymphatic cancers as well. [6]

<br><br><br>
<p><b>The Pentagons Explanation</b>

<p>The Department of Defense (DoD) now contends that the loud noise heard by the Seabees on the early morning of January 19, 1991 was probably the explosion of an Iraqi Scud missile, contradicting the initial explanation by unit commanders that it had been a sonic boom.  According to a Pentagon statement, a review of battle records indicates that "a Scud missile aimed toward Dhahran [Saudi Arabia] was intercepted at high altitude in the area [of Al Jubayl] around the time of the... incident." [7]   DoD officials deny that the Scud carried a chemical warhead, since the burning skin and other acute symptoms reported by victims are not consistent with the effects of standard chemical-warfare agents. [8]  Mustard gas, for example, does not cause an immediate burning sensation on the skin, facial numbness, or a metallic taste in the mouth; instead, it induces painful skin blisters that appear between three and eight hours after exposure.

<p>The alternative explanation offered by the Pentagon is that the Seabees may have been exposed to a toxic propellant released from an intercepted Iraqi Scud as it broke up in the atmosphere.  It is known that the Iraqis used <i>red fuming nitric acid</i> (RFNA), a highly corrosive chemical, as an oxidizer for the kerosene fuel in their ballistic missiles.  When a Scud was damaged by a Patriot missile, the RFNA remaining in the oxidizer tank was often dispersed.  As a result, individuals downwind of a Scud intercept may have been exposed to droplets of nitric acid and toxic vapors of nitrogen dioxide, the reddish-brown smoke that RFNA gives off as it evaporates.

<p>According to a CIA analysis, individual exposures to RFNA released from an intercepted Scud would depend on several factors, including proximity to the impact site, level of shelter and chemical protection, the amount of RFNA remaining in the fuel tank, the amount released when the missile broke up, and the prevailing atmospheric conditions.  The worst-case hazard area could be as large as 2-3 kilometers downwind and 100 to 200 meters wide.  Toxicological studies of nitrogen oxides indicate that the first symptoms of exposure appear after a period of 4 to 30 hours, during which victims feel extremely fatigued and show signs of abnormally low blood pressure.  After this latent period, acute symptoms develop, including headache, dizziness, lassitude, nausea and vomiting, cyanosis (a blue tinge to the mucous membranes), anxiety, difficulty breathing, and suffocation. [10]

<p>There are three problems with the Pentagons hypothesis, however.  First, the U.S. intelligence community did not detect an Iraqi Scud launch against Saudi Arabia in the early morning of January 19, 1991.  The U.S. Central Command <i>Nuclear, Biological and Chemical (NBC) Desk Log</i> makes no mention of a Scud launch associated with the Al Jubayl incident.  Similarly, the intelligence chronology kept by the 11th Air Defense Artillery Brigade reports four Scud launches against Israel that night, but none against Saudi Arabia. [11]  Furthermore, no eyewitnesses of the Al Jubayl incident have reported a Patriot launch and intercept during the attack.

<p>A second problem with the Pentagons explanation is that although RFNA is a highly corrosive acid, none of the exposed troops observed any damage to their rubber gas masks, protective garments, weapons, ponchos, canteen containers, or tents.  Third, whereas nitrogen oxides produce a reddish-brown smoke, eyewitnesses of the Al Jubayl attack have consistently reported a "yellow-green fog or mist floating through the air." [12]

<p>These discrepancies suggest that the Al Jubayl attack probably come from another source.  Although a notarized affidavit prepared by eyewitness Thomas Harper reports the rumor that an Iraqi MiG jet fighter was shot down over the port, it is possible that some other type of aircraft was involved. [13]   Indeed, a 4:40 AM entry in the U.S. Central Command <i>NBC Desk Log,</i> recorded an hour and a half after the double-explosion, states that a British liaison officer near Al Jubayl "herd [sic] a propeller driven aircraft in the area" shortly before the incident.[14]   Iraq was known to possess several Swiss-made Pilatus PC-7 and PC-9 propeller-driven aircraft, which were based at Umm Qasr and used to deliver chemical weapons during the Iran-Iraq War. [15]

<p> Pentagon officials insist that no Iraqi aircraft could have penetrated Saudi airspace as far south as Al Jubayl, since it would have been detected by an AWACS radar aircraft stationed over the Persian Gulf and intercepted immediately by U.S. fighters.  The possibility remains, however, that a low-flying Iraqi plane or an unmanned drone could have been misidentified as an allied aircraft or simply lost in the ground clutter.  Indeed, the famous flight of the young German pilot Mathias Rust, who flew a propeller plane from West Germany to Moscows Red Square in May 1987 without being detected, suggests that even the densest air-defense networks can be fallible when it comes to small, low-flying aircraft.

<p>It is therefore conceivable that an Iraqi propeller-driven aircraft may have penetrated Coalition air defenses and sprayed or dropped a toxic agent over the commercial port of Al Jubayl, after which the plane was shot down by an air-defense missile.  The detonation of the missile warhead, followed immediately by the explosion of the planes gas tanks, would account for the double blast (detonation-concussion) and shockwave.  The cloud of  toxic agent may then have drifted downwind, exposing the Seabees in the two camps near the port.

<p>If such a scenario did occur, what type of toxic agent could have been involved?  None of the standard chemical-warfare agents (blister agents such as mustard or lewisite, nerve agents such as sarin or VX) have either acute and chronic effects consistent with those reported by victims of the Al Jubayl incident.  Only one known family of biochemical agents can cause many of the symptoms experienced by the affected troops: <i>mycotoxins,</i> a broad class of naturally occurring fungal poisons associated with serious illness and death in humans.  Two families of mycotoxins are potential suspects, the aflatoxins and the trichothecenes.

<br><br><br>
<p><b>Aflatoxins</b>

<p>Aflatoxins are a family of toxins produced by the fungal mold <i>Aspergillus,</i> which infects peanuts and other food grains.  Although aflatoxins are generally considered to be non-lethal in humans, they are of medical concern because they are extremely potent inducers of liver cancers, which may develop months to years after exposure.  Ingestion of large amounts of aflatoxin may also result in severe liver damage and acute symptoms, including death.  According to a U.S.Army field manual on chemical and biological warfare agents, "Aflatoxins are not only toxic; they also induce cancers, malformations, and mutations.  Because their effects, although severe, are relatively slow to appear, aflatoxins may not be viable as [warfare] agents." [16]

<p>In 1995, four years after the end of the Gulf War, inspectors with the United Nations Special Commission on Iraq (UNSCOM), the U.N. agency responsible for uncovering and eliminating Iraqs weapons of mass destruction, determined that Iraq had produced large quantities of aflatoxin.  According to an UNSCOM status report released in October 1995, Iraq admitted that it had begun studies of aflatoxin in May 1988 at a biological weapons laboratory near the town of Al Salman.  The U.N. report notes, "Research was conducted into the toxic effects of aflatoxins as biological warfare agents and their effect when combined with other chemicals." [17]  To this end, Iraqi scientists studied the effects of these toxins on sheep, donkeys, monkeys, and dogs in the laboratory and in a special inhalation chamber, as well as in the field.

<br><br><br>
<p><b>Iraqi Production and Weaponization of Aflatoxin</b>

<p>Iraq also admitted to UNSCOM that it had engaged in the large-scale production and weaponization of aflatoxin.  Beginning in 1988, Iraq cultivated the toxin-producing mold <i>Aspergillus</i> in five-liter flasks at the Al Salman facility.  In 1989, production of aflatoxin for biological-weapons purposes was moved to another plant near the town of Fudaliyah.  Here, between April and December 1990, Iraqi scientists produced a total of about 1,850 liters of concentrated aflatoxin in solution. [18]

<p>In November 1989 and in May and August 1990, Iraq conducted weaponization trials of aflatoxin in 122mm artillery rockets and R400 aerial bombs.  In December 1990, aflatoxin and two other biological-warfare agents (anthrax spores and botulinum toxin) were filled into R400 aerial bombs and warheads for the <i>Al-Hussein</i> missile, an extended-range version of the Soviet Scud.  To date, Iraq has admitted producing a total of 2,200 liters of concentrated aflatoxin, of which 1,580 liters were filled into 16 aerial bombs and two missile warheads. [19]

<p>Baghdad claims that all of its biological weapons, including those filled with aflatoxin, were deployed in early January 1991 at sites well north of the Kuwait Theater of Operations (KTO) and remained unused throughout the Gulf War.  According to Iraqi declarations, the aerial bombs filled with biological agents were deployed to three remote airfields, where they were placed in open pits, covered with canvas, and buried with dirt to shield them from attack.  The biological warheads for the Al-Hussein missiles were reportedly hidden in a railroad tunnel and in earth-covered pits near the Tigris canal. [20]  Given Iraqs long record of falsehood and deception with respect to its biological-warfare capabilities, however, these statements should not necessarily be taken at face value.

<br><br><br>
<p><b>Military Utility of Aflatoxin</b>

<p>Iraqs motivation for producing and weaponizing aflatoxin remains unclear.  It is possible that Iraq may have sought to induce long-term illnesses in Coalition troops, an approach that would be consistent with Iraqs strategy of attrition against Iran during the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq War.  Alternatively, aflatoxin have been intended to function as an incapacitant or a lethal agent in large doses.  Some Western experts speculate that the Iraqis learned from animal testing that high concentrations of aflatoxin, disseminated as an aerosol, have far more immediate and devastating effects than the slow induction of liver cancers associated with the ingestion of small doses. [21]
	
<p>According to a CIA report on intelligence and Gulf War illnesses, published on the Internet in August 1996,

<ul>
<p>With the possible exception of aflatoxin, all declared Iraqi agents were intended to cause rapid death or incapacitation.  The only documented effects of aflatoxin in humans are liver cancer months to years after it is ingested and symptoms--possibly including death--caused by liver damage from ingestion of large amounts.  Effects of <i>aerosolized aflatoxin are unknown.</i>  UNSCOM assesses that Iraq looked at aflatoxin for its long-term carcinogenic effects and that testing showed that large concentrations of it caused death within days.  <i>We have no information that would make us conclude that Iraq used aflatoxin or that it was released in the atmosphere when bombing occurred.</i> [22] [emphasis added]
</ul>

<p>The italicized sentences indicate that (1) little is known about the toxic effects of aflatoxin aerosols, and (2) the CIA has not obtained conclusive evidence that aflatoxins were either used deliberately by Iraq or were released inadvertently as a result of Coalition bombing of production or storage facilities.  Since it is doubtful that the CIA and Department of Defense have conducted a thorough investigation of this issue, the negative formulation reporting a lack of information does not rule out possible exposures.  As the saying goes, "Absence of evidence does not mean evidence of absence."

<br><br><br>
<p><b>Trichothecene Mycotoxins</b>

<p>Trichothecene  (pronounced tri-ko-thee-seen) mycotoxins are a large family of fungal toxins that produce nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, skin irritation, and internal bleeding.  <i>Fusarium, Stachybotrys,</i> and other trichothecene-producing molds can infect food grains such as corn, rye, barley, oats, and millet, as well as straw and hay.  Historically, trichothecene mycotoxins have been known to cause severe health problems in humans and animals who have eaten contaminated food. [23]  In 1944, for example, 30 percent of the population of Orenburg district, near Siberia, was affected by alimentary toxic aleukia (ATA), an often fatal disease caused by the ingestion of trichothecenes.

<p>T-2 toxin and diacetoxyscirpenol (DAS) are the most potent members of the trichothecene family.  They have an estimated lethal dose in humans of 3 to 35 milligrams (thousands of a gram), making them moderately toxic compared to chemical nerve agents such as sarin.  Nevertheless, microgram doses of T-2 toxin and DAS are sufficient to cause vomiting, sustained nausea, and skin and eye irritation.  According to one source, trichothecenes are approximately 10 to 500 times more potent than mustard gas in inducing skin necrosis. [24]
	
<p>Harvesting and extraction of infected grain can yield large quantities of trichothecenes for warfare purposes.  Crude extracts of <i>Fusarium</i> containing a mixture of trichothecenes are more potent than pure T-2 toxin, and aflatoxin interacts synergistically with trichothecenes to increase their combined toxicity. [25]

<p>Military dissemination of these toxins would probably be in the form of a powder or smoke aerosol or, alternatively, sprayed in large, liquid drops as a ground contaminant.  Trichothecenes can enter the body by absorption through the skin or eyes, inhalation (in aerosol form), or ingestion in contaminated food or water.  When solubilized in the solvent dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), T-2 toxin and DAS are readily absorbed through the skin. [26]  It is also known that trichothecenes are about 10 times more toxic when inhaled as an aerosol than by oral or subcutaneous administration. [27]

<p>An advantage of the trichothecenes from a military standpoint are that they are extremely stable, particularly in dry powder form.  They can be stored for years at room temperature with no loss of activity and retain their full potency even after being boiled in water for an hour.  Accordingly, these toxins are difficult to decontaminate from clothing and equipment and are highly persistent in the environment, although they are eventually broken down by soil bacteria. [28]

<br><br><br>
<p><b>Symptoms of Trichothecene Poisoning</b>

<p>Trichothecenes exert their toxic effects by inhibiting protein synthesis, and are therefore able to harm multiple organ systems simultaneously.  They do the most damage to rapidly dividing cells such as those in the lining of the gastrointestinal tract, the bone marrow, and the lymph nodes, giving rise to symptoms similar to those of radiation poisoning.  Because there is a large gap between the incapacitating dose and the lethal dose of trichothecenes, many casualties will become sick but not die.  The delay in the appearance of symptoms after exposure depends on the dose and the means of delivery.  Initial symptoms may occur within an hour of inhalation or as long as 12-24 hours after skin contact.  After a single low-level exposure, the peak effects tend to occur in one to three days. [29]

<p>Initial symptoms of trichothecene poisoning are burning and irritation of the mucous membranes, including conjunctivitis (eye inflammation), nasal irritation (with or without bleeding), and sore throat.  If the agent is delivered as an aerosol, coughing and shortness of breath are accompanied by burning of the lungs and secondary pulmonary edema.  Nausea and persistent vomiting are common, as are diarrhea (which may be bloody) and dehydration.  Damage to exposed areas of skin is often extensive: the symptoms range from redness and inflammation to the formation within several hours of small (1 centimeter diameter), hard, fluid-filled blisters. [30]  Other early symptoms are shortness of breath, dizziness, chest pain, low blood pressure and rapid heartbeat.

<p>Delayed symptoms of high-dose trichothecene exposure include hemorrhage and necrosis of the mucous membranes, including the lining of the gastrointestinal tract, resulting in bloody diarrhea; neurological disorders, and depressed bone-marrow activity leading to immune-system impairment and increased susceptibility to multiple bacterial and viral infections. [31]

<p>Because there are no known antidotes to the trichothecenes, treatment is limited to supportive care.  Decontamination is possible if the victim washes extensively with large amounts of soap and water, but must be performed immediately after exposure. [32]  Although T-2 toxin and DAS are broken down by the body, some of the resulting metabolic products--such as HT-2 toxin--are also highly toxic.  (HT-2 toxin is about two-thirds as toxic as T-2 toxin. [33])  Studies have also shown that both T-2 toxin and DAS are lipid-soluble and may persist for weeks in skin and fat tissue. [34]  Unfortunately, little research has been done on the chronic effects of sublethal trichothecene exposures.

<br><br><br>
<p><b>Alleged Use in Southeast Asia</b>

<p>Beginning in the 1930s, the Soviet Union did extensive research on trichothecene mycotoxins, which were responsible for serious epidemics in Russia resulting from the consumption of contaminated grain.  In 1981, the U.S. government accused the Soviets and their Vietnamese and Lao communist allies of employing mixtures of trichothecenes (popularly known as "yellow rain") for warfare purposes against resistance forces in Laos, Cambodia, and Afghanistan. [35]  The State Department subsequently published two white papers laying out a wide variety of evidence to support these allegations, including analyses of samples of toxic material and of victims blood and tissue, refugee testimony, defector reports, and classified intelligence such as communications intercepts. [36]  A group of independent scientists detected gaps and inconsistencies in the governments case and managed to undermine its credibility with the general public.[37]  To this day, however, members of the U.S. intelligence community stand by their conclusions and insist that the allegations of Soviet mycotoxin warfare were true. [38]
	
<p>Some of the immediate and delayed symptoms associated with reported low-level exposures to "yellow rain" in Laos and Cambodia in the late 1970s are similar to those described by Seabees who experienced the mysterious incident at Al Jubayl.  Victims in Southeast Asia who were exposed to a yellow powder, mist, smoke, or dust sprayed from low-flying aircraft experienced an immediate burning sensation on the skin, an acrid odor, and began to retch and vomit in a matter of minutes.  Unlike traditional vomiting agents, the vomiting induced by yellow rain was protracted over hours to days and often contained blood.  Victims also experienced severe diarrhea, passing bloody stools up to eight times a day.  Other symptoms included dizziness, rapid heartbeat, low blood pressure, chest pain, loss of far-field vision, and the blistering of exposed skin.  At higher doses, bleeding under the fingernails and around the eyes, severe bruising of the skin, and bleeding gums were also reported.  Finally, people who had been exposed to lethal doses of yellow rain suffered massive internal bleeding from the gastrointestinal tract, bloody vomiting, and death within a few days. [39]
	
<br><br><br>
<p><b>Iraqi Involvement with Mycotoxins</b>

<p> Some Western analysts suspect that the former Soviet Union may have transferred chemical and biological weapons technology and expertise to Iraq, possibly including mycotoxin agents.  Unsubstantiated evidence also suggests that Iraq may have used trichothecene mycotoxins against Iranian troops during the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq War.  According to one account, Iraqi forces employed trichothecenes along with standard nerve and blister agents (tabun, mustard, and lewisite) during a massive attack on Iranian troops at Majnoon Island in March 1984. [40]  Belgian chemical-weapons expert Aubin Heyndrickx also reported in 1989 that he had detected trichothecene mycotoxins in the blood, urine, and feces of Iranian soldiers treated as gas victims from the Majnoon Island battle. [41]  Heyndrickxs findings were controversial, however, and have not been confirmed by other scientists.

<p>Despite the lack of solid scientific evidence for Iraqi military use of trichothecene mycotoxins during the Iran-Iraq War, the following items are suggestive of a strong Iraqi interest in trichothecene mycotoxins for warfare purposes:

<ol><br>
<li> One of the chief scientists in Iraqs biological warfare program, Dr. Rihab Rashid Taha al-Azawi, was a specialist in biological toxins who obtained her doctorate in toxicology from the University of East Anglia in England.</li><br><br>

<li>In 1986, the Iraqi government paid nearly 30,000 West German marks to purchase samples of four trichothecene mycotoxins from Sigma-Chemie in Munich, a subsidiary of a St. Louis-based company that manufactures specialty biochemicals for research institutions. [42]  The West German government licensed this sale on the grounds that the quantities of toxin were too small to be useful for military purposes.  During subsequent hearings in the German Parliament, however, a representative of the Federal German Intelligence Service testified that Iraq could have made effective use of small quantities of mycotoxins for military research, and that trichothecenes are particularly well suited for sabotage missions and terrorist attacks. [43]</li><br><br>

<li>In the summer of 1989, Iraq purchased an identified fungus from an unknown source in The Netherlands for the production of mycotoxins, according to a declassified U.S. government intelligence report.  The report also notes: "The mycotoxins are being developed in a high security laboratory at the Saddam University (332100N/04425000E), Baghdad, IZ [Iraq] for possible biological warfare use." [44]</li><br><br>

<li>A captured pre-war Iraqi military record, dated April 10, 1990, refers specifically to trichothecene mycotoxins ("yellow rain").  The document is a communication addressed from Tank Battalion Headquarters, 55 Republican Guards, to the chemical company of the Tawakalna Ala Allah Forces Command of the Republican Guards.  This record, written on the back of a Form 102 (a receipt for chemical weapons-related equipment) in the space titled Weapons and assignment numbers, important characteristics of weapons and assignments, quantities, and other remarks," reads as follows:

<ul>
<p>In reference to your letter... dated April 2, 1990, we are sending you our commissioner ([Warrant Officer] Ghanem Nohad Jamell) who has 4 Forms 102.  Please give him the yellow rain manual (fungal toxins) number /894 delivered to our unit pursuant to delivery plan number 17.  Please review and respond. [45]
</ul>
<br>

	This document indicates that the Iraqi Chemical Corps had prepared <i>an entire manual</i> devoted to offensive and/or defensive operations with trichothecene mycotoxins, suggesting a major Iraqi military effort in this area.</li><br><br>

<li>A declassified U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) document dated March 1993 describes Iraqi research on a trichothecene-related illness in humans.  The report states that Iraqi scientists discovered the first known instance in humans of a chronic diaper dermatitis (skin inflammation) caused by the fungus <i>Stachybotrys atra,</i> which produces reridin A, a trichothecene mycotoxin known to produce disease in animals.  The Iraqi scientists reported incidents of humans becoming sick after exposure to <i>Stachybotrys</i>-contaminated straw, and found reridin A to be toxic at a dose of only 0.0001 nanogram.  A DIA field note attached to the report states:

<ul>
<p>Identifying a new trichothecene producer could well be related to [Iraqi] CBW research.  The agent suspected of being employed in Southeast Asia is T-2, a trichothecene which is a potent "blister-agent-like" toxin.  Also of interest is that these scientists mentioned sickness resulting from human exposure.  This may well be legitimate work in identifying diaper dermatitis; however, given the admitted stance that Iraq was working on BW agents, this research should be noted for future CBW targeting. [46]</li><br><br>
</ul>

<li>In December 1994, the Iraqi government sponsored a conference in Baghdad on "Post-War Environmental Problems in Iraq."  At this conference, Iraqi scientists reported that analyses of samples of vegetation, water, and soil had revealed the presence of high levels of five trichothecene mycotoxins that did not occur naturally in the areas of Iraq where the samples were taken.  Both T-2 toxin and HT-2 toxin (a metabolite) were also reportedly found in the blood and urine of Iraqi civilians complaining of vomiting, fever, headache, backache, swollen eyes, and chest pain. [47]  Based on these findings, Baghdad accused the United States of conducting mycotoxin warfare against Iraq.<br><br>

On its face, the Iraqi allegation is implausible.  Moreover, given the difficulty of identifying trichothecenes even with sophisticated analytical techniques, the claimed Iraqi detections must be viewed with skepticism.  Nevertheless, it is at least conceivable that mycotoxin weapons were produced and stockpiled <i>by Iraq</i> and then dispersed by U.S. bombing of munitions bunkers and/or forward-deployed bermed munitions, causing collateral exposures to Iraqi civilians as well as Coalition troops.  (Crudely bermed open-air storage sites would produce much greater fallout than munitions destroyed in steel-reinforced concrete bunkers.)</li><br><br>

<li>In 1995, Iraq admitted to UNSCOM that it had done research on milligram quantities of two trichothecene mycotoxins, T-2 toxin and DAS, although it denied any large-scale production of these agents. [48]  Given Baghdads long history of lies and deception, however, this statement should not necessarily be taken at face value.  Iraq has already admitted the large-scale production of aflatoxin, and it is at least possible that significant quantities of trichothecene mycotoxins were secretly produced and weaponized as well.</li></ol>

<br><br><br>
<p><b>Toxin Weapons and Iraqi Military Doctrine</b>

<p>One possible Iraqi motivation for producing and employing mycotoxins would be to debilitate enemy forces, an approach that Baghdad appears to have seriously considered.  Iraqi military planners understood that it is more disruptive to injure rather than kill enemy troops, since dead soldiers require far less attention and resources than wounded ones.  According to a U.S. defense analyst, "Perhaps the greatest problem is created when soldiers are physically or mentally incapacitated in such a way that renders them unfit for combat, and without the commander necessarily realizing what has happened or why." [49]  The insidious use of toxin-warfare agents would have been consistent with Saddams overall strategy during the Gulf War, which was to "bleed" the Coalition forces by inflicting high casualties.  The Iraqi leader calculated that large numbers of dead or injured American troops would generate strong political pressures from U.S. public opinion to end the war, forcing the Bush Administration to reach a political settlement on Baghdads terms. [50]

<p>Revealing insights into Iraqs offensive biological-warfare doctrine can be drawn from Iraqi military manuals translated by the U.S. Armed Forces Medical Intelligence Center (AFMIC), now part of the Defense Intelligence Agency.  In particular, the Iraqi manuals stress the use of chemical or biological agents to produce non-fatal casualties rather than deaths, with the aim of disrupting the enemys operations and overburdening his medical and logistical infrastructure.  For example, a field manual published by the Iraqi Chemical Corps in 1984, titled <i>Chemical, Biological and Nuclear Operations,</i> discusses the tactical utility of incapacitating biological and toxin agents:

<ul>
<p>It is possible to select anti-personnel biological agents in order to cause lethal or incapacitating casualties in the battle area or in the enemys rear areas.... Incapacitating agents are used to inflict casualties which require a large amount of medical supplies and treating facilities, and many people to treat them.  Thus it is possible to hinder the opposing military operations. [51]
</ul>

<p>This doctrine is consistent with Iraqs avowed experimentation with several incapacitating biological-warfare agents, including three non-lethal viruses: hemorrhagic conjunctivitis virus (which produces extreme eye pain and temporary blindness), rotavirus (which causes acute diarrhea that could lead to dehydration), and camelpox (which causes fever and skin rash in camels but may induce a non-fatal illness in humans who are not natives of the Middle East). [52]

<p>Since the end of the Gulf War, senior Iraqi officials have insisted that their biological weapons were strictly weapons of last resort, intended for retaliation against the major cities of regional adversaries (such as Riyadh and Tel Aviv) in the event of a nuclear attack on Baghdad.  They have also stated that Saddam Hussein predelegated the authority to launch aerial and missile strikes with biological weapons to the subordinate commanders of the bases where the weapons were deployed.  Thus, if Baghdads communications were cut off or the Iraqi military command destroyed in a "decapitating" enemy attack, a retaliatory strike could still be carried out. [53]  In an interview in October 1995, Iraqi Oil Minister Amer Rashid insisted that Iraq would have used biological weapons only in retaliation.  "Iraq had no intention of using biological weapons unless the allies or Israel attacked Baghdad with nuclear weapons," he said. [54]

<p>Nevertheless, the veracity of such statements is open to doubt.  For example, although Iraqi officials have assured UNSCOM that they destroyed all of their biological weapons after the Gulf War, they have been unable to provide any physical or documentary evidence to back up this claim.  Senior UNSCOM officials now believe that the Iraqi statement is false, and that as many as 16 Scud missiles armed with biological warheads may still be hidden on fast-moving trucks to evade detection.[55]

<p>Although UNSCOM has no concrete evidence that any of Iraqs biological and toxin weapons were actually used, none of the weapons has yet been accounted for.  Moreover, the fact that Iraq possessed a retaliatory biological-warfare option does not rule out the first use of the same capability, nor does it constitute proof that Iraqs biological arsenal was strictly a weapon of last resort.  In any event, Baghdad would clearly have nothing to gain, and much to lose both politically and economically, by admitting that it employed chemical or biological weapons during the Gulf War.  In particular, such an admission would make it much less likely that the U.N. Security Council would ever vote to lift the crippling economic sanctions imposed on Iraq in the aftermath of the war.

<br><br><br>
<p><b>Links to the Al Jubayl Incident</b>

<p>U.S. forces in the Gulf did not possess any field monitoring systems capable of detecting or identifying aflatoxin or trichothecene mycotoxins.  At the time of Operation Desert Storm, the only biological agents that U.S. intelligence believed Iraq had weaponized--and that U.S. forces were equipped to detect--were anthrax and botulinum toxin.  (The jury-rigged U.S. biological detection system involved the collection of particulate air samples at regular intervals, followed by an antibody-based analysis technique.  Because the system did not operate in real-time, it would have detected exposures of U.S. troops to anthrax or botulinum only <i>after</i>an attack had occurred.)  Moreover, although thousands of U.S. troops were vaccinated against anthrax and botulinum toxin, no vaccine or antidote against mycotoxins was (or is) available.

<p>It is known that U.S. Army Technical Intelligence teams conducted extensive environmental and biomedical sampling for chemical and biological warfare agents in Iraq, Kuwait, and Saudi Arabia during and after the Gulf War.  These samples were analyzed at the Naval Forward Laboratory in Al Jubayl or shipped back to Army laboratories in the United States for more sophisticated analysis.  The results of most of these analyses remain classified, however, and have not been released even to the Marine units that collected some of the samples. [56]

<p>Despite the lack of sampling data available in the public domain, several unusual characteristics of the Al Jubayl incident, recounted by eyewitnesses, are consistent with possible Iraqi use of trichothecene mycotoxins:

<ol><br>
<li>Victims of the Al Jubayl attack reported an immediate itching and burning sensation on exposed areas of skin, followed by the formation of small blisters after a delay of several hours, as well as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fever, and lassitude.  These symptoms are consistent with low-level exposure to trichothecenes.  (Unlike mustard gas, which produces painful blisters after a delay of three to eight hours, trichothecenes cause an immediate burning sensation on the skin.)</li><br><br>

<li>The "metallic taste" reported by several eyewitnesses is suggestive of the use of the organic solvent dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), which facilitates the dissemination of trichothecenes as a fine mist and their rapid absorption through the skin of exposed individuals. [57]  After dispersal, the volatile solvent would evaporate, leaving a dry powder residue on exposed surfaces.</li><br><br>

<li>The "yellow powder" that Nick Roberts observed coating tents and vehicles on the morning after the attack is suggestive of a crude extract of <i>Fusarium</i> fungus, which contains a yellow pigment in addition to a mixture of potent trichothecene toxins.</li><br><br>

<li>Some wives and children of veterans suffering from Gulf War illnesses report that they have come down with similar symptoms, suggesting that the causative agent may be transferable from one individual to another, perhaps in contaminated clothing or through intimate contact.  In addition, several civilian army depot workers who were never deployed to Saudi Arabia but were assigned to clean or repair military vehicles and other equipment returned from the theater have developed characteristic symptoms of Gulf War illnesses. [58]  Similar illnesses have also been reported among embalmers who handled the remains of dead U.S. soldiers in the military morgue at Dover Air Force Base.  These mysterious phenomena suggest the presence either of an unusually rugged infectious agent or a persistent toxic contaminant.  Since mycotoxins are known to be highly stable and difficult to decontaminate, they could provide a possible explanation.</li>
</ol>

<br><br><br>
<p><b>Anomalies</b>

<p>Two anomalies remain to be explained.  Shortly after the Al Jubayl attack, Harold Jerome Edwards, the chemical NCO with the Air Detachment of the 24th Naval Mobile Construction Battalion, detected blister agent (e.g., mustard gas or lewisite) in the air using M-256 kits, disposable "chemical labs on a card" that are considered highly reliable.  Edwards told Senate investigators in 1994 that after the explosion over the port, he had conducted three M-256 tests.  Two of the tests were positive for chemical blister agent; the third test was negative, but was done in a sheltered area between two rows of tents.[59]  The <i>Central Command NBC log</i> for the period covering the Al Jubayl attack also includes an entry stating that a nearby British unit reported detections of blister agent about an hour after the double-explosion, using two detection methods (M-9 paper and a hand-held Chemical Agent Monitor).[60]  As noted above, however, the symptoms reported by sick veterans are not consistent with blister-agent exposure.

<p>There are three possible explanations for this discrepancy.  First, although the M-256 kits is not designed to detect mycotoxins, it is possible the presence of these toxins in the air could cause the M-256 kit to give a positive reading for blister agent.   Controlled laboratory testing would be needed to test this hypothesis.  Second, the M-256 kits used at Al Jubayl may have generated a false-positive reading for blister agent if they were beyond their expiration dates.  Third, it is possible that the Iraqis used a mixed-agent attack against Al Jubayl involving a "cocktail" of dusty mustard and a crude extract of mycotoxins (trichothecenes and/or aflatoxin).  Indeed, the October 1995 UNSCOM status report states that Iraq did research on the toxic effects of aflatoxins as biological warfare agents and their effect <i>when combined with other chemicals"</i> [emphasis added].

<p>The second anomaly is that U.S. Marine units who were deployed in the same area near Al Jubayl as the affected Seabees--and hence should have experienced a similar toxic exposure--have not reported a high incidence of symptoms typical of Gulf War illnesses.  This discrepancy may perhaps be explained by the fact that while most of the Seabees were reservists, most of the Marines were active-duty and thus less likely to report illness for fear of receiving a medical discharge.  In any event, there is a need for an epidemiological study comparing the incidence of chronic illnesses in the two groups.

<br><br>
<p><b>Conclusions and Recommendations</b>

<p>A large proportion of the Seabees who were exposed to the mysterious attack at Al Jubayl have developed chronic symptoms considered typical of Gulf War illnesses: severe fatigue, joint aches, memory loss, mysterious gastrointestinal ailments, and skin rashes.  Although the evidence for Iraqi use of aflatoxin and/or trichothecene at Al Jubayl remains circumstantial, this hypothesis warrants further investigation.

<p>Iraq has admitted to large-scale production and weaponization of aflatoxin but insists it only did research on small quantities of trichothecene mycotoxins.  Given Iraqs record of deceit and deception, however, it would be premature to rule out the secret large-scale production of trichothecenes.  UNSCOM should pursue this possibility in future interrogations of senior Iraqi officials.

<p>The results of the extensive chemical and biological sampling operations undertaken by U.S. forces during and after Operation Desert Storm should be declassified and released to the public.  If environmental or biomedical samples were found to contain aflatoxins or trichothecene mycotoxins not indigenous to Iraq, this data would provide strong evidence of Iraqi use of toxin weapons.

<p>Scientific knowledge about the physiological effects of low-dose exposures to the trichothecene mycotoxins (particularly in aerosol form) is seriously lacking.  More research is clearly needed to assess the long-term medical consequences, if any, of such exposures.

<p>Finally, since lipid-soluble trichothecenes such as T-2 toxin and DAS may persist in fatty tissues for several weeks, if not longer, it would be worthwhile to analyze for mycotoxin residues in blood samples or fat or skin biopsies taken from veterans shortly after they developed symptoms of Gulf War illnesses.  Since the half-life of mycotoxins in the body is limited, their absence would not necessarily rule out exposures.  Conversely, the discovery of mycotoxin residues in the body fluids of sick Gulf War veterans would provide strong support for the hypothesis presented here.

<h5>By PHILIP SHENON</h5>
<p>   
<p>    Two American soldiers who manned the most
sophisticated chemical-detection equipment used in the 1991 Persian
Gulf war told Congress on Tuesday that chemical weapons were found
in Kuwait during and after the war, contradicting repeated
statements from the Defense Department.
<p>   The soldiers, who worked in a mobile chemical-detection
laboratory known as a Fox vehicle, said in testimony before a House
subcommittee that their reports of chemical detection were largely
ignored or dismissed by their superiors.
<p>   "Alarms were going off, detections were being made, and the
individuals who were actually responsible for manning these
detection systems knew what they were doing," said Maj. Michael
Johnson, a chemical-detection specialist with the Army. He said his
Fox vehicle detected mustard agent in a large metal tank found in
Kuwait in August 1991, months after the war ended.
<p>   "I believed that when they said detections happened, detections
happened," he said, adding that he believed the mustard agent had
been left behind by retreating Iraqi forces.
<p>   In the past, Pentagon officials have insisted that despite the
technical sophistication of the Fox vehicles, which are able to
detect 60 different chemical agents simultaneously using a
laboratory-quality mass spectrometer, most of the detections made
during the war were false alarms. The officials have also denied
that stores of chemical weapons were ever found in Kuwait.
<p>   The Defense Department said on Tuesday, however, that as part of
an expanded review of gulf war illnesses, it would go back and
review the evidence of chemical detections involving Fox vehicles.
"We've made a commitment to go back and look at these incidents
described today, as well as all other incidents," said Bryan
Whitman, a Pentagon spokesman.
<p>   Despite the Pentagon's new commitment, the testimony from
Johnson and Gunnery Sgt. George Grass of the Marine Corps provided
new ammunition to lawmakers who in the past have accused the
Pentagon of hiding evidence of Iraqi chemical exposures during the
gulf war.
<p>   Rep. Christopher Shays, R-Conn., who is the chairman of the
House panel, the Government Reform and Oversight Subcommittee on
Human Resources, said that valid chemical detections had been
"dismissed, discounted, discredited or denied" by commanders
eager to ignore the possibility that troops had been exposed to
chemical weapons.
<p>   Rep. Bernard Sanders, a Vermont independent, accused the
Pentagon of suppressing information about the chemical exposures by
the Fox vehicles. "Persian Gulf war veterans have every right to
know why this information was not forthcoming, and in fact who is
responsible for what might be termed an apparent cover-up," he
said.
<p>   The Pentagon has insisted that it learned only this year of an
incident in which large numbers of American troops may have been
exposed to chemical weapons  --  an event in March 1991, in which
American combat engineers blew up an Iraqi ammunition bunker that
was later determined to have contained tons of nerve gas and
mustard agent.
<p>   But the testimony on Tuesday from soldiers who manned the Fox
vehicles suggested that there were repeated, accurate detections of
chemical weapons in Kuwait during the war and afterwards. The two
witnesses remain in the military, although both have reported
health problems that they believe may have resulted from their
deployment to the gulf.
<p>   Grass, who was assigned to the First Marine Division during the
war, said his Fox vehicle detected traces of nerve agent as it
crossed from Saudi Arabia into Kuwait during the ground war in
February 1991, possibly as a result of Iraqi chemical mines. After
entering Kuwait, he said, the equipment detected lethal
concentrations of mustard agent.
<p>   He testified that when he reported the detection of mustard
agent to his division headquarters, the response came back that
"our readings were false and that the readings were produced by
the burning oil fire vapors  --  we explained to him that we already
knew what oil fire vapors looked like on the monitor, and the
readings were clearly distinct."
<p>   On Feb. 28, 1991, he said, his Fox vehicle was assigned to an
abandoned Iraqi ammunition storage area outside Kuwait City.
<p>   "The alarm on the mass spectrometer sounded with a full and
distinct spectrum across the monitor for a lethal vapor
concentration of mustard," he said. "We drove the Fox vehicle
closer to the dug-in ammo bunkers, and fully visible were the skull
and crossbones."
<p>   He said many of the shells containing chemicals appeared to have
been made in the United States.
<p>   The subcommittee also heard testimony on Tuesday from Maj. Randy
Hebert of the Marines, whose words had to be translated by his wife
and father because he is suffering from amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis, or Lou Gehrig's disease. He said he suspects his health
problems are the result of exposure to low levels of chemicals.
<p>   Pentagon officials, he said, "don't want to be held responsible
for all the people who are now sick and for the ones who have
died."

<h5>By WARREN HOGE</h5>
<p>   
<p>     The British government announced Tuesday that it would
study complaints of illness among veterans of the Persian Gulf war
and acknowledged that it had furnished Parliament incorrect answers
to questions about the matter in the past.
<p>   The studies will examine 12,000 soldiers, including gulf war
veterans and those who did not serve in the war, to compare their
medical histories since the war. One of the aims is to see if those
who went to the gulf have had "disproportionate difficulties" in
having children and whether their offspring have suffered birth
defects. The work begins in January and will last three years.
<p>   Britain becomes the fourth country in recent months, after the
United States, the Czech Republic and Slovakia, to announce an
expanded investigation of illnesses reported by gulf war veterans,
who were part of the U.S.-led coalition against Iraq.
<p>   Armed Forces Minister Nicholas Soames told the House of Commons
that previous questions from members of Parliament about British
troops' use of pesticides during the war and the harm they might
have caused had been "answered incorrectly because ministers were
given flawed advice."
<p>   He said that pesticides based on organophosphate chemicals
designed to combat fly-borne diseases were used by British soldiers
"on a much wider scale than previously reported."
<p>   He called the response to the questions a "grave error" and
said an investigation by the Ministry of Defense was seeking to
determine how it happened. He stressed that the government had not
"knowingly misled the House."
<p>   The government is maintaining "an open mind about the question
of whether there is or is not a gulf war syndrome," Soames added.
<p>   "Whatever the case," he said, "we are determined to get to
the bottom of it." He said the research would be "carefully
coordinated" with work in the United States and that a British
medical officer would be appointed to work with the Pentagon.
<p>   He said none of the 51,000 British troops who went to the Gulf
had been in the vicinity of the ammunition dump at Kamisiyah that
was destroyed shortly after the war, in March 1991, by U.S. forces
and may have released chemical agents.
<p>   Soames said the Ministry of Defense had checked more than 100
claims of chemical weapons use in the gulf, "all of which have
proved unfounded."
<p>   Dr. David Clark, the Labor Party's military affairs spokesman,
said Tuesday's announcement represented a long awaited victory for
those who had been campaigning for "more openness and more
urgency" in the government's response to the problem.
<p>   As in the United States, lawmakers and service groups in Britain
have been pressing the government to act on their reports of
widespread maladies, including chronic fatigue, asthma, skin
disorders, paralysis, reproductive problems and depression among
the gulf war veterans. Last month, a group of 1,000 veterans
announced they would take their case to court in January.
<p>   In response, Soames has repeatedly said there was no need for
the kind of epidemiological studies he announced Tuesday.
<p>   "Parliament, this country and our veterans have been misled,"
Clark said. "It is the veterans who have suffered as a result of
government incompetence and apathy."
<p>   Richard Barr, a lawyer representing 140 ill gulf war veterans,
said, "It's taken six years to get this far, and the studies are
going to take some considerable time to complete, so we are looking
at up to 10 years before we get some results. That's
unacceptable."
<p>   Under sharp questioning from legislators, Soames said families
would have to take court action and prove negligence by his
department to receive compensation.
<p>   Menzies Campbell, the defense spokesman for the Liberal
Democrats, said, "The circumstances which prompt your statement
Tuesday constitute a very substantial humiliation for your
department and have been the source of wholly unnecessary anger,
frustration and distress to gulf war veterans and their families."
<p>   Veterans groups had expressed concern that troops had not been
given instructions on how to protect themselves when deploying the
pesticides. Some of the batches were purchased locally with
instructions in Arabic that the soldiers could not understand and
are suspected by researchers of having carried a toxicity that was
more dangerous to humans than the Army-issued pesticides.
<p>   Since others exposed to the pesticides had not experienced the
adverse effects that many of those who went to the Gulf did,
veterans groups have theorized that their illnesses may stem from
reactions between the chemicals they used and the vaccinations and
anti-nerve agent tablets they received before going to the
battlefield. They argue that this "cocktail" produced the gulf
war syndrome.
<p>   The anti-biological-warfare vaccinations, which were given to
some U.S. troops, were intended to protect against anthrax,
botulism, plague and whooping cough, Soames disclosed Tuesday.
<p>   However, the vaccine against botulism could not be acquired in
time, and a serum for use after attack was bought. Since biological
agents were never detected, he said, the anti-botulism serum was
never used.
<p>   Soames also came in for criticism from members of his own party.
Edwina Curry, a former health minister said, "One of the most
distressing aspects of this whole business has been, for those of
us involved, to watch the deterioration of ex-servicemen and women
who suffered in the gulf and who three or four years ago, were
capable of holding down a job and no longer are so capable and
indeed are now having to have much more extensive hospital
treatment.
<p>   "Much of their concern is still that they don't know what
they're suffering from."<br>

<p>MEMORANDUM FOR Veteran's Administration

<p>SUBJECT:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Myers, Theodore E. SS ###-##-#### USNR(TDRL)

<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have been treating P02(TDRL) Myers since June of 1994. 
He was medically retired from the Navy on 24 Dec 1992 and has forwarded his extensive medical 
records to you. His diagnoses included <b>chronic fatigue, orthopedic problems with right knee
 (now with some degenerative changes), and PTSD</b>. He has not done well since discharge from the Navy, 
and has a <b>multitude of physical problems and limitations</b>.

<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On my first evaluation in June 1994, <b>I recommended hospitalization</b> as 
P02 Myers was suffering significantly. He was sweating proflisely, his heart rate was elevated (120), his 
pupils were dilated, he was extremely anxious with pronounced startle response, he was quite agitated and 
was breathing rapidly. He had been treated at NNMC at Bethesda for almost three 
years and had extensive and comprehensive medical and psychiatric evaluation. Despite this, he still has 
frequent periods of panic feeling, with <b>palpitation, shortness of breath, diarrhea, chest pain, and intense malaise</b>. 
These episodes <b>occur at least four times per week</b> and are severe enough to seriously interfere with his life. 
His<b> fatigue is present constantly</b>, as well as a <b>daily headache and diminished concentration</b>. Furthermore, he 
has constant joint and muscle pain, as well as stiffliess and weakness. His wife reported nocturnal sweating, 
and he has difficulty falling and staying asleep.

<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His wife clearly states that he has changed dramatically since his return from 
Southwest Asia. In the months I have been following P02 Myers I have been quite impressed by the physical 
aspects of his limitations, and of how much he is suffering. Although he works, he is occupationally far below 
where he was performing before the Gulf War, and <b>is not able to attain his potential</b>. His work performance 
before and during the war was excellent, and he supervised up to eight corpsmen directly, and at times he was 
responsible for over forty medical personnel. The difference in his work performance from before and during 
the war to the present is no less than profound.

<p>SUBJECT:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Myers, Theodore E. SS ###-##-####


<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Although there is a<b> real element of Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome, 
I strongly feel that this retired veteran has far greater problems, and that they are <font color="red">organic</b></font>. These coincide with
 the PTSD and make<b> his limitations severe and debilitating</b>. Since his service in the war, the quality of his life 
has seriously deteriorated and much work will be needed before this veteran is able to begin reaching his 
potential. Also, his home life has suffered seriously, and he requires weekly counseling and supportive sessions.

<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	<font color="red">In my opinion, he clearly meets the <b>criteria for Gulf War Syndrome</b>, and I 
suspect that he suffers from <b>Multiple Chemical Sensitivity Syndrome</b></font>. His disability from this and other medical 
and psychiatric problems is profound. <font color="red">I do not feel that the diagnosis of PTSD explains the majority of his 
symptoms, although it is clearly present and effects him daily</font> (his wife reports that he cannot tolerate loud 
noises, abrupt noises, sirens, airplanes, helicopter sounds or any loud sound. <font color="red">The PTSD and Gulf War 
Syndrome combined have left him virtually disabled</font>.

<p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	In conclusion, this veteran has the following diagnosis:
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.&nbsp;&nbsp;   <b>  Gulf War Syndrome, severe</b><br>

I can remember going to your chow hall.  MRE's were getting old, and our
chow hall wasn't yet fully operational, never mind un-chlorinated-and it
was such a joy to eat at FH5 chow hall.  I can remember saying to the
others with me, "Boy, I sure hope our hospital gets the same food as
these people do!  <b>Even ice cream--what a luxury!</b>"

DAILY NEWS SUMMARY:
<p>

CHEMICAL-WEAPON CLAIMS PROBED (AP, 6/27/93) Birmingham (AL) News, 6/27/93)
-- A Senate panel plans to question top Pentagon medical officers (6/30) about claims by Navy veterans that they were injured by chemical weapons during the Persian Gulf War and ordered to keep quiet about it, reports AP. Veterans of a Navy Reserve seabee unit told The Birmingham News they believe they were hit by a chemical weapon the night of Jan. 20, 1991, while stationed near an dir strip south of the port of Al Jubayl on the Persian Gulf.  They said they were told not to talk about the incident but decided to break their silence because they have been unable to obtain government medical care br health problems they believe stem directly from the attack, according to the wire service.  Sen. Richard Shelby, D-Ala., chairman of the Senate flrmed Services subcommittee on force requirements and personnel, said he hopes the hearing will be "the first step toward getting to the bottom of what happened on the night of Jan. 20, 1991.  We owe it to America's Desert Storm veterans to provide an honest appraisal of the cause of their medical problems.  But more than that, we owe them proper diagnosis and treatment," Shelby is quoted.  The Birmingham News article identifies the seabees as part of the 24th Naval Reserve Construction Battalion of Huntsville, Ala.  The unit suffered high casualties from mysterious illnesses linked to the war and those maladies have been the subject of an ongoing investigation by the paper.  Members of the unit report a tremendous explosion followed by a mist and almost immediate problems with burning skin and difficulty breathing, according to the paper.  One of the seubees is reported as saying that three teams of military personnel trained in chemical and biological warfare defense arrived at the base and began testing and decontamination.  He said British decontamination personnel told him all three teams found traces of "dusty mustard gas," reports the paper.

I am looking for any of our security people who can put me in touch with the Marines who helped patrol our compound. It was they that told us to go to the bunkers on the 19th of Jan. because they saw patriot missles fired. Eye witnesses to this event are needed to help with our illnesses. Thank you.

<HR NOSHADE>

<BR>

What's the truth about Persian Gulf War syndrome, and is the

Pentagon guilty of a cover-up? In recent weeks, two of the war's

heroes, generals Colin Powell and Norman Schwarzkopf, have said

they know of no evidence that U.S. troops were exposed to

chemical weapons during the conflict that could have made them

sick. But there are new indications that the generals, and even

a Nobel prizewinning scientist hired by the Pentagon to look

into the matter, were not told the full story. Since June 21 of

this year, Defense officials have begun to suggest that the

syndrome could be linked to troops' coming into contact with

traces of sarin and other nerve agents. Here are the facts to

date:<p>What is Gulf War syndrome?<p>It's a collection of symptoms, including chronic fatigue,

rashes, headaches, joint pain, digestive problems and difficulty

concentrating. Veterans have had babies born with twisted limbs,

congestive heart failure and missing organs--problems they blame

on their service in the gulf.<p>How many people have it?<p>About 70,000 U.S. troops among the 697,000 who served in the

Middle East during the Gulf War have complained to either the

Pentagon or the Department of Veterans Affairs that they are

suffering from one or more of the symptoms. They exhibit such

symptoms at a much higher rate than soldiers who didn't serve in

the theater. Up until now, they do not appear to be dying at a

higher rate.<p>Were they all in the same place during the Gulf War?<p>There is little correlation between ill soldiers and where they

served during the war. While certain units have more ailing

members than others, some investigators see that as evidence of

the stress shared by members of those units--combat, being away

from home and family, and poor living conditions. The main

concentration seems to be among reservists, who account for

nearly half of those reporting the problem but made up only 17%

of the troops serving there. The Pentagon attributes this

discrepancy to the reluctance of active-duty soldiers to

complain for fear of losing their jobs in a shrinking military,

on the reservists' greater age and on the fact that the war

disrupted their lives more severely than those of active-duty

troops.<p>Are residents of the region and soldiers from other nations

reporting similar ills?<p>The Kuwaitis and Saudis insist they are not, but authoritarian

states are unlikely to encourage such disclosures from their

citizens. Most of the complaints come from American and British

veterans, joined in smaller numbers by Canadians, Czechs and

Slovaks. Last week Britain appointed an independent panel to

study claims from about 1,000 veterans that they are suffering

from the syndrome. In Washington, U.S. veterans testified again

last week about their health problems before a congressional

subcommittee.<p>What do the medical experts say is the most likely cause of Gulf

War syndrome?<p>No single cause has been identified. It had long been Pentagon

doctrine that if a soldier didn't immediately become sick from

chemical weapons, he or she would never suffer any adverse

effects from them. But  recently the Pentagon has  conceded

there is little proof for that theory, and that low-level

exposure, perhaps combined with other environmental or medical

factors, may have played a key role in triggering the problem

years after exposure.<p>Is there one event that may have been responsible for

engendering the syndrome?<p>The Pentagon believes up to 20,000 U.S. troops may have been

exposed to such poisons when they destroyed chemical weapons at

the huge Kamisiyah depot in southern Iraq. But one leading

investigator, James Tuite, says the emphasis on Kamisiyah is

just the Pentagon's way of denying the scope of the problem.

Tuite, who did a ground-breaking Senate study on the topic in

1993, believes soldiers are ill because of widespread allied

attacks on Iraq's chemical-weapons factories and depots during

the 39-day air war that began Jan. 16, 1991.  During that

assault, the U.S.-led alliance destroyed 75% of Iraq's

chemical-weapons production capability, along with 21

chemical-weapons storage sites. But the Pentagon has said the

timing and methods of its pinpoint attacks minimized the spread

of the poison bombed by the allies. And it says there were no

reports of massive Iraqi casualties near the chemical-weapons

targets.<p>What evidence does Tuite have?<p>Czech chemical-weapons experts, deployed along the Saudi-Iraqi

border, detected sarin and mustard gas on three occasions in the

war's opening days. Chemical-weapons alarms sounded in U.S.,

British and French units at the same time. Tuite's correlation

of the detections and of satellite weather photographs taken at

the time  suggests that the tons of nerve agent atomized in the

allied strikes rose in a huge thermal plume that became stuck

behind a stationary weather front. He argues that this invisible

cloud drifted south over the entire theater, gently sprinkling

the soldiers with a poisonous rain. The Pentagon has disputed

his theory, arguing any fallout was too low to harm U.S. troops.

But some outsiders ask how the Pentagon can reach that

conclusion when it concedes it doesn't know the minimal amounts

required for such poisons to cause long-term damage.<p>What's the significance of all the chemical-weapons alarms

sounded during the war?<p>Thousands sounded during the war, and most were dismissed as

false alarms.  But in some ways, it doesn't matter if they were

false or not because, as designed, the equipment was not

sensitive enough to detect the kind of chemical danger Tuite

believes exists at very low levels. At least some in the Army

apparently agree, because chemical detectors used by Army

workers who handle the poisons are calibrated to detect far

smaller doses of chemical weapons than those used by troops on

the battlefield.<p>Is the Pentagon hiding something?<p>It sure looks that way. Pentagon officials say most of the

combat diaries of significant events kept by the U.S. Central

Command at General Schwarzkopf's headquarters--classified

documents, no less--are missing, including those of the

eight-day span during which U.S. troops destroyed the

chemical-weapons stockpiles at Kamisiyah. (The logs could be

reconstructed from the 30 million documents written by

individual units under Schwarzkopf's command, but that would

take years.) In the meantime, the Pentagon's acknowledgment that

U.S. troops may have been exposed came only under pressure: the

June 21 Kamisiyah announcement, for example, was made four days

before a soldier presented Congress with a videotape showing

U.S. troops blowing up a chemical-weapons bunker. There is

little evidence to support claims the Pentagon actively withheld

information about chemical weapons during the war. But in April

1992, the Pentagon declared in its official history that Iraqi

forces had never used such weapons against U.S. troops. Having

asserted that, the Defense Department has seemed

uninterested--until recently--in pursuing contrary claims.<p>Who is paying the soldiers' medical bills?<p>The taxpayers are. The Veterans Affairs Department and the

Pentagon are providing free medical help to any veteran who

believes he or she is suffering from Gulf War syndrome. Congress

has authorized such aid without the veterans' having to prove,

as is usually the case, that their ailment is connected to their

military service.<p>What is the U.S. government doing about the problem now?<p>The Pentagon is enlarging its staff studying the issue from 12

to 110. About $15 million is being spent on the first major

study of the long-term impact of low levels of chemical weapons

on humans.<p>What is likely to happen?<p>If what had been acceptable trace levels of chemical agents in

the battlefield are found to be harmful, the U.S. military will

have to revamp the way it protects its forces against even those

tiny amounts. It would be particularly tragic if the symptoms

are ultimately linked to Kamisiyah or fallout from the allied

bombing; that would mean that not only did "friendly fire"

account for nearly 25% of the Pentagon's 146 battlefield deaths,

but also that successful allied actions were responsible for the

war's most persistent and haunting pain.

<center><H1>Chapter 2, Part 1. <br>  Group I Exposures:  Reported Direct Exposure Events</H1>


<h2><b><i><font color="red">The following information concerns the port of Al Jubayl and is taken from the above mentioned Riegel Reports.</h2></i></b></p>
<hr width="75%">
</center></font>

<B>Event2:</B><P>
<I>January 19, 1991, early morning hours.
Camp 13, 6-7 miles west of Port of Jubayl, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia 
(Although some individuals reported this event as taking place on January 20, documentary evidence indicates that it took place on the 19th.)</I><P>

<I>Witness 01:</I>  Petty Officer Sterling Symms, then assigned to the
Naval Reserve
Construction Battalion 24, in an area south of the Kuwait border,
testified before the
Senate Armed Services Committee that between 2:00a.m. and 3:00a.m.
on January 20,
1991, there was a "real bad explosion" overhead.  The alarms went
off and everybody
started running towards their bunkers.  Petty Officer Symms said
there was a sharp odor
of ammonia in the air.  His eyes burned and his skin stung.  HIs
unit donned full
chemical gear for nearly two hours until the "all clear" was given.<P>

     Later, according to Symms, members of the unit were advised
that what they
heard was a sonic boom.  Petty Officer Symms said that he did not
believe that it was a
sonic boom because there was also a "fireball" associated with the
explosion.  Members
of the unit were ordered not to discuss the incident.  Petty
Officer Symms says he has
since experienced fatigue, sore joints, running nose, a chronic
severe rash, and open
sores which have been diagnosed as an "itching problem."  He has
also been treated for
streptococcus infections.  In his testimony, Symms stated that 4 or
5 other members of
his unit and two of their wives have been treated for similar
infections.<P>

<I>Witness 02:</I>  Mike Moore, assigned to the same unit as Symms, also
reported that on
January 20, 1991, at about 3a.m., he was awakened by a double
explosion.  As the sound
of the explosion faded the alarms went off.  The unit intercom
announced "Go to MOPP
level 4."  Everyone in the tent put on their gas gear and went to
the bunker.  They
stayed at MOPP level 4 until about 7a.m..  Later that day or the
next, everyone's
chemical suits and masks were collected and replaced.  According to
Mr. Moore, he was
told the explosion was a sonic boom, to quit worrying about it, and
to get back to work. 
Mr. Moore said that he later heard that what he heard was an
incoming SCUD, but he
also heard rumors that a Iraqi MIG was shot down in the area that
night.<P>

     Mr. Moore said that he did not feel a spray or smell ammonia. 
He had no
stinging or numb lips.  Since returning home from the Gulf, he has
suffered a severe
thyroid problem, a heart attack, memory loss, tired and aching
joints, rashes on his feet,
nervousness, and muscle cramps, although he reported no bleeding. 
According to Mr.
Moore, he has had about ten blood tests and two sets of x-rays
performed at the
Tuskeegee, Alabama, Veterans Affairs Medical Center.  In past calls
to the Tuskeegee,
Alabama, VAMC, however, he had been told that there is no
information in his record.<P>

     In February 1992, Mr. Moore's daughter began developing a
thyroid problem and
has been suffering from nervousness, headaches, and fatigue.  Over
the last year, his wife
has begun to develop these symptoms as well.   There is no history
of thyroid problems
in family.<P>

<I>Witness 03:</I>  Mr. William Larry Kay was an electrician assigned to
Naval Mobile
Construction Battalion 24.  He was also assigned to Camp 13.  On
January 20, 1991, Mr.
Kay heard two "booms", shaking the whole building.  Sirens began
going off.  The camp
intercom announced "confirmed mustard gas -- go to MOPP level 4." 
Mr. Kay was at the
Recreation Center when the blasts occurred.  He had fallen asleep. 
He went outside and
put his gas mask on.  It immediately filled with fumes.  He recalls
that it smelled like
ammonia.  Mr. Kay has been a  member of a Hazmat (Hazardous
Materials) team of the
fire department in Columbus, Georgia; he said the strong smell of
ammonia is unusual in
an open area.  There was an ammonia plant nearby, but he had never
smelled such a
strong odor of ammonia in the area.  He reported to his assigned
bunker.  Each member
of the unit had a duty during these attacks -- Mr. Kay was assigned
to a decontamination
team.  There were other people assigned to test for chemical
contamination.  A radio
call came in for these people to check for gas.  Then, almost
immediately, the intercom
announced "all clear."<P>

     Mr. Kay said that after the incident, in response to questions
from the unit as to
what had occurrred, the unit Commanding Officer said "Have you ever
heard of a sonic
boom?"  When members of the unit continued to question the unit
commanders about
what had occurred, they were ordered not to discuss the incident.<P>

<I>Witness 04:</I>  Mr. Terry Avery of Salem, Alabama worked on utilities
for Naval Mobile
Construction Battalion 24, and was also assigned to Camp 13. 
During the night of
January 20, 1991, Mr. Avery said that he heard a double explosion. 
The alert siren went
off.  He put on his gas mask and went to the bunker.  While in the
bunker, his unit
received the command to go to MOPP level 4 over the camp
loudspeaker.  He put on
his chemical suit.  Mr. Avery said he was almost completely dressed
when they
announced "all clear."  He left the bunker and returned to his
tent.<P>

     Mr. Avery was later told by his Master Chief that the noise he
heard was just a
sonic boom.  A veteran of Vietnam who had heard sonic booms before,
Mr. Avery felt
that it was not a sonic boom, but he never got a good answer about
the explosion.  He
reported that the rumor going around the camp was that an enemy
plane had been shot
down over the desert.<P>

     Late in the summer of 1991, Mr. Avery began feeling tired and
having headaches. 
He saw a private doctor, who said he was probably working too hard
in the sun.  He says
he does not think he is as ill as the rest of the men in his unit
(NMCB24).  He feels that
he has leveled out, but he still has good days and bad days.  He
currently suffers from
fatigue, headaches, weight gain, itching, muscle and joint pains,
and memory loss (inability to concentrate).<P>

     His wife is also ill.  Mr. Avery feels that she is more ill
than he is.  She has an
enlarged spleen, an enlarged liver and abnormal liver functions,
joint pains, night sweats,
fatigue, stomach problems, itching, and rashes, but has not
complained of memory loss. 
Two of his children are also complaining of headaches, joint pain,
and abdominal pains. 
His 13 year old daughter was diagnosed as having mononucleosis. 
She also has sinus
infections, and throat pains from the sinus drainage.  His 11 year
old son has had rashes,
headaches, joint pain, itching, sinus and throat infections, and
fevers.<P>

<I>Witness 05:</I>  The following are excerpts from one of two letters
written by a U.S.
serviceman present at Camp 13 during the January 19, 1991 incident. 
This individual has
been interviewed by U.S. Senate professional staff.  These original
letters confirm the
actual events of that morning.  This individual has requested
confidentiality.  The
original letters have been retained as evidence.<P>
<PRE>
                                        "8:00 pm
                                        19 Jan 91
</PRE><P>
<I>     Dear Mom,<P>

     I just talked to you on the phone.  I really didn't want to
call you and tell you
about the SCUD missile/gas attack so you wouldn't worry, but I
really needed to hear a
familiar voice...I'm trying like hell to keep my mind off the fact
that it's night time again,
and we could get hit again.<P>

     Mom, I can deal with getting shot at, because I can fight back
and even if I got
hit, I can be put back together, a missile, on the other hand,
doesn't work like that, but I
can even accept that.  But gas scares the hell out of me.  I know
how to put on the
protective suits and gear, but it's the thought.  Once the missile
hit (without warning!)
we were so busy getting dressed in our chemical suits we never had
time for it to sink in
and be scared.  I was proud of all of us because no one froze up -
we all responded like
we'd been trained to, but after we got suited up, we had to sit
there and force ourselves
to breathe slow and try and cool down - the suits are very hot. 
It's hard to slow your
breathing when your heart's beating a million times a minute...[a]
fire team [went] out
and...patrolled the camp and checked all of the towers.  The rest
of the camp were in
their bunkers except security and the chemical detection teams.  I
know they detected a
cloud of dusty mustard gas because I was there with them, but today
everyone denies it. 
I was there when they radioed the other camps north of us and
warned them of the
cloud...I talked to the look-outs that saw the air burst and cloud
and had to stay with
them for a few minutes to try and calm them down even though I was
just as scared
(probably more!).  Jubail is South East of us, and that's where the
Scud hit that was
confirmed, but the air burst my guys saw was only 200+ yards west
of us.  I don't know
what that was, but that's where most of the gas came from I think. 
But the wind was
almost blowing due North.  I probably won't sleep much tonight, but
at least I'll be able
to respond faster..."</I><P>

     In the interview with Senate staff, the individual said that
during patrols around
Camp 13 in the days just after the incident he wrote about, he
observed many animals
that were either sick or dead.  He also confirmed that after the
attack, their chemical
protective gear was replaced.<P>

<I>Witness 06:</I>  Mr. Mike Tidd was assigned to perform security duties
with Naval Mobile
Construction Battalion 24.  He currently suffers from joint aches
and pains, sinus
infections, diarrhea, urinary urgency and frequency, rashes, small
mosquito bite-like
sores, heartburn, dizziness, occasional low temperatures,
occasional night sweats, and
chronic fatigue.  Mr. Tidd kept a log while in Saudi Arabia.<P>

     According to his log, on January 19, a little past 0330hrs.,
Mr. Tidd was sitting on
Tower 6 when all of a sudden, there was a double boom off to the
northwest of the
camp, accompanied by a bright flash of light.  Within minutes, the
general quarters alarm
sounded.  Mr. Tidd's unit first donned their gas masks and ponchos,
and then minutes
later, the call came to go to MOPP level 4.  At about 0600hrs, the
"all clear" was sounded.<P>

     While Mr. Tidd heard the bang and saw the flash, which he
described as being
fairly close, he does not recall seeing a cloud.  He said that he
did not experience any
symptoms, but attributes that to having been in a covered guard
tower about 20 feet off
the ground with a 3' visibility area.<P>

<B>Event 3:</B><P>
<I>January 19, 1991, early morning hours (possibly January 20).
King Abdul Aziz Naval Air Station (NMCB24-Air Det), 3 miles south
of Port of Jubayl, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia</I><P>

<I>Witness 01:</I>  Mr. Larry Perry, of North Carolina, was a naval
construction worker
stationed near the port city of Al-Jubayl, at King Abdul Aziz Naval
Air Station.  He says
the explosion on January 20, 1991 sent his entire unit running for
the bomb shelter. 
When they emerged in their gas masks, they were enveloped by a
mist.<P>

<I>Witness 02:</I>  Mr. Fred Willoughby of Columbus, Georgia was with
Naval Mobile
Construction Battalion 24 - Air Det.  He currently suffers from
headaches, diarrhea,
aching joints, blood shot eyes, bloat, intestional problems, and
chronic fatigue.  He has
had a polyp removed from his colon, and suffered from rectal
bleeding in 1992.<P>

     Mr. Willoughby has reported that on January 20, 1991, at about
3-4a.m., he was
"hanging out" outside his tent when he heard a long, loud
explosion.  Shortly thereafter,
a siren sounded and he went inside the tent to get his gas mask. 
By the time he came
out, people were yelling 'MOPP 4, MOPP 4, not a drill'. 
Immediately, his mouth, lips,
and face became numb all over, a sensation he likened to novocaine
at the dentist's
office.  He was in the bunker for about an hour or an hour and a
half.  When he came
out of the bunker, he and the others in the unit were told by the
officers and chiefs that
what they had heard was just a sonic boom.  The next day, the unit
was told not to talk
about it.  But the unit's MOPP gear was collected and replaced the
next morning.  Mr.
Willoughby also heard that an enemy aircraft was shot down in the
Gulf, not far from
the base.<P>

     His wife has begun exhibiting similar symptoms, including
fatigue, diarrhea, and
aching joints.<P>

<I>Witness 03:</I>  Roy Morrow of Phenix City, Alabama was a builder with
NMCB24 and was
assigned to the Air Detachment at King Abdul Aziz Stadium.  On
January 20, 1991, he
heard two explosions between 3:00-3:30a.m.  He was awakened and
went to the bunker. 
The unit went to MOPP level 2 for 25-30 minutes.  The "all clear"
was then given.  When
he exited the bunker, Mr. Morrow noticed the Marines running and
screaming "MOPP
level 4."  The siren sounded again.  He began to feel a burning
sensation on his arms,
legs, the back of his neck, and on his ears and face.  His lips
felt numb.  His unit went to
full MOPP level 4.  Right before he went to the bunker the second
time, Mr. Morrow
saw a flash at the commercial port of Al-Jubayl.  He had a radio in
the bunker, and
heard a call for the decontaminaton teams to respond.<P>

     BU2 Edwards was the head of the decontamination team in Mr.
Morrow's unit. 
According to Mr. Morrow, BU2 Edwards said the next day that mustard
gas and lewisite
had been detected.  When they began to discuss it, according to Mr.
Morrow, the unit
was told that the two explosions were a sonic boom, and they were
ordered not to talk
about it any more.  The next day, all of their chemical gear was
collected and replaced
with new equipment.<P>

     The numbness experienced by Mr. Morrow remained for at least
a week.  Within
two to three days after the incident, unit members began to suffer
from rashes, diarrhea,
and fatigue.  The aching joints began a couple of weeks later.  Mr.
Morrow's symptoms
have been getting progressively worse until the present time.  He
currently suffers from
swollen lymph nodes, fatigue, diarrhea, night sweats, low grade
temperature, weight loss,
aching joints, muscle cramps, rashes (transient) blister, welts
(2-3 times a month), a
permanent hand rash, and short-term memory loss.<P>

<I>Witness 04:</I>  Mr. Harold Jerome Edwards, the chemical NCO in charge
of the
Nuclear/Biological/Chemical team for the Naval Mobile Construction
Battalion 24 Air
Detachment at King Abdul Aziz Naval Air Station was interviewed by
U.S. Senate staff
on January 13, 1994.  During that interview Mr. Edwards said that
he conducted three
M-256 tests for chemical agents on the evening of this event. 
According to Edwards, two
of the three tests he conducted were positive for chemical blister
agent.  He said that the
negative test was conducted in an area in between a number of rows
of tents.  He also
said that he reported this information to his unit commander.  In
addition, Mr. Edwards
said that a member of the unit, Tom Muse, blistered in the area
under his watch during
this event.  The "all clear" was given from a higher command.  Mr.
Edwards was called
out to serve on a chemical decontamination team that day.  He said
that  the Mark 12
decontamination unit assigned to the team was inoperative and that
he was assigned to
take out a 500 gallon water truck and stand by to decontaminate
incoming personnel. 
According to Mr. Edwards, no one was decontaminated by his team. 
He said that this
was the only time he was called out on this type of mission
throughout the entire war.<P>

<H2>Other Information Regarding the Detection of Chemical Agents at Jubayl.</H2><P>

     Ken Allison, then a Lance Corporal with the 174th Marine Wing
Support
Squadron, Group 37, was delivering supplies to Jubayl Airfield. 
During an interview with
Senate staff, he reported that sometime during his deployment
there, possibly in January
1991, he saw a sign posted on a guard shack at the airfield's
southern gate.  The sign
warned:  that the area had tested positive for chemicals; make sure
your MOPP gear was
ready; and that when the alarms go off it is for real.  Although he
did not recall the
exact wording on the sign, he remembered the content clearly.<P>

     In addition, a number of British military personnel suffering
from Gulf War
Syndrome who were stationed near the Port of Jubayl have come
forward and have
described similar events.<P>

continue to bolster initial accounts of events best explained as
missile and rocket attacks
or aerial explosions.  Units located in areas where these events
occurred are reporting
high rates of illnesses.  The areas in which these events occurred
were key logistic and
staging areas, as well as those areas which were breached during
the liberations of
Kuwait.  Many veterans of these units have reported seeing large
numbers of dead or
dying animals in the area after the attacks; one veteran noted that
"all the insects were
dead too."<P>

     Department of Defense conclusions that no chemical or
biological attacks
occurred seem to be based on the assumption that there was no
significant evidence of
immediate chemical and biological casualties.  However, since one
of the primary goals
of a biological attack is to debilitate your adversary's forces,
while retaining a high
degree of deniability, and since many of those interviewed describe
both immediate
physical reactions and long term debilitating effect, the issue of
what these individuals
may have been exposed to becomes highly critical.<P>

<center><h1>The Pentagon Didn't Do It   </h1></center>


<em>By Richard Cohen </em><br>


Tuesday, January 7 1997<br>
 The Washington Post
<p>


<p>
I have been to the Pentagon, and so I know, by virtue of experience, that it is a building and not, as it is often characterized, a person. For the longest time, however, this entity -- the Pentagon -- had been quoted as insisting that no U.S. troops were exposed to Iraqi nerve gas or chemical weapons, a statement the Pentagon now admits is not true. See: The building lied.<p>
But who, exactly, in that building either lied or bungled the facts -- what a presidential panel today characterized as a "slow and superficial" examination of <B>Gulf</B> <B>War</B> Syndrome -- is not at all clear. As far as I know, no one in the military has been fired, demoted, punished or even chastised for insisting -- against mounting evidence to the contrary -- that no American troops were exposed to chemical or biological agents during or after the <B>Gulf</B> <B>War</B>. In fact, the U.S. command was informed at the very outbreak of the <B>war</B> that chemical weapons had been detected.<p>
Two separate issues have to be considered here. The first is whether the chemical agents encountered by U.S. troops can be the cause of <B>Gulf</B> <B>War</B> Syndrome. This collection of maladies -- everything from mood swings to cancer -- has been studied again and again with the preponderance of scientific opinion being that <B>Gulf</B> <B>War</B> Syndrome, whatever it may be, was not caused by chemical/biological agents associated with the <B>war</B>. Scientists also found no connection between the syndrome and the environmental hazards created at the <B>war</B>'s end -- the burning of the oil fields, for instance.<p>
But if <B>Gulf</B> <B>War</B> veterans contest that conclusion, who can blame them? From the outset they were told that reports of chemical weapons use were wholly imaginary: sheerest rumor, unsubstantiated twaddle, a lie or a damned lie, depending on who the briefing officer was at the time.<p>
One of the first to offer such assurances was Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf, who called the initial reports of chemical weapons "bogus." Subsequently, however, he has had an equally terse assessment of how the Pentagon has handled the entire matter: "scandalous." Since the end of the <B>war</B>, evidence has surfaced that, indeed, American troops might well have been exposed to chemical weapons.<p>
The first reports of chemical weapons exposure occurred very early in the <B>war</B>. Czech, French and U.S. detectors picked up something, but since both troops and animals seemed unaffected, the reports were interpreted as misreadings and dismissed as bogus at headquarters.<p>
This often happens in wartime. But after the <B>war</B> had ended, it is now clear that some 20,000 troops may have been exposed to chemical or nerve agents when the Kamisiyah ammunition depot in southern Iraq was blown up in March of 1991. Here again, the consequences of this exposure are very much in dispute. What is not in dispute, though, is that it happened.<p>
Apparently, 20,000 troops is a mere nothing to the fellows and gals who run the military. They continued to insist that nobody -- but nobody! -- came into contact with chemical agents during or after the <B>war</B>, and their insistence was seconded by, among others, Defense Secretary William J. Perry, Secretary of Veterans Affairs Jesse Brown and Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala. They all added that there was no indication that American troops had been exposed. Yet, indication -- as opposed to hard proof -- there was, and that was enough to undermine their credibility. Since it is inconceivable that they all would lie, it seems they were all misinformed.<p>
By whom? A building, it seems. In all the news reports I have read, it is always the Pentagon saying and then the Pentagon conceding. It is the Pentagon announcing and then the Pentagon admitting. This is sheerest, purest, ultimate Washington -- a place where the buck is in perpetual motion. No one can tell you how, exactly, a Chinese arms merchant got to shake President Clinton's hand, and no one can tell you who in the Pentagon knew -- just for starters -- that maybe 20,000 troops did indeed get exposed to chemical agents.<p>
Given the evidence, it's hard to know what to make of the <B>Gulf</B> <B>War</B> Syndrome. But it is even harder to understand why real people in the Pentagon and others at the White House are not mad as hell that they were either lied to or led astray. If so, though, they are keeping their anger well-concealed and are not asking the relevant questions.<p>
If the search for truth was merely botched, then who botched it? And if the truth was purposely concealed, then who lied -- and why is he or she still working for thee and me? Don't tell me, please, that the Pentagon, a building, is at fault. That is just another way of covering up the truth.<p>

<h3><a name="oc6a85">GULF WAR ILLNESSES BROKEN DOWN INTO 
THREE PRIMARY SYNDROMES<br> 
Clusters of symptoms indicate brain and nerve damage; possible causes include 
chemical weapons and pesticides</a></h3> 
 
<p>WASHINGTON, D.C.--Evidence now exists linking military service during the 
Persian Gulf War to a variety of ailments, including neurologic injuries potentially 
caused by exposure to chemical weapons and government-issued insect 
repellent, and possibly by a drug taken to prevent poisoning from nerve gas, 
according to three articles in the January 15 issue of <i>The Journal of the 
American Medical Association (JAMA).</i> 
 
<p>Robert W. Haley, M.D., from The University of Texas Southwestern Medical 
Center at Dallas, and colleagues conducted a series of investigations on 249 
Gulf War veterans of the 24th Reserve Naval Mobile Construction Battalion from 
five southeastern states (Alabama, Georgia, Tennessee, South Carolina, and 
North Carolina).   
 
<p>Dr. Haley released the information today (Jan. 8) at a press conference in 
Washington. 
 
<p>In the first investigation, the researchers found that 63 (25 percent) of the 
249 veterans reported clusters of symptoms that appear to represent discreet 
syndromes which were identified by a mathematical computer technique.     
 
<p>They write:  "The results of this study identified six apparent syndromes, or 
variants of a single syndrome, and may help to explain why medical 
examinations of thousands of ill Gulf War veterans remaining on active duty did 
not.  Our findings were made possible by including non-ill and nonactive-duty 
veterans ..." 
 
<p>Three primary syndromes and three secondary syndromes were identified.  
The three primary syndromes are: 
 
<ul><li><b>Syndrome-1</b> or <b>"Impaired Cognition" Syndrome</b> - 
characterized by distractibility, difficulty remembering, depression, insomnia, 
fatigue, slurring of speech, confused thought process, and migraine-like 
headaches. 
<p>	 
<li><b>Syndrome-2</b> or <b>"Confusion-ataxia" Syndrome</b> - 
characterized by problems with thinking and reasoning processes such as 
reading, writing, and spelling; getting confused; getting disoriented when trying 
to locate a car in a parking lot; having problems with balance; having a 
physician's diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, or liver 
disease; and sexual impotence. 
<p> 
<li><b>Syndrome-3</b> or <b>"Arthro-myo-neuropathy" Syndrome</b> - 
characterized by generalized joint and muscle pains, increased difficulty lifting 
heavy objects, fatigue, and tingling or numbness of the hands, arms, feet, and 
legs.</ul> 
 
<p>The authors suggest that most of the symptoms that comprise the syndromes 
could be explained by varying combinations of injury to the brain, spinal cord, 
and peripheral nerves. 
 
<h4>Three Clusters Signal Neurologic Damage</h4> 
 
<p>Following the identification of the six syndromes, Dr. Haley and colleagues 
conducted a second investigation.  Detailed neuropsychologic exams were 
performed on 23 symptomatic veterans and 20 well veterans.  
 
<p>The researchers found that the three primary syndromes "appear to 
represent variants of a generalized injury to the nervous system."  The 23 
symptomatic veterans consistently scored more in the abnormal direction on 
objective tests of neurologic function than the well veterans.  
 
<p>The differences in illness severity among the veterans may be due to 
differences in the age of the veterans at the time of the war, according to the 
researchers.  They found that syndrome-1 was most common among younger 
veterans, while the risk for syndromes 2-3 increased with age.  
 
<h4>Chemical Nerve Agents, Insect Repellent, Anti-Nerve Gas Pills Linked to 
Neurologic Damage</h4>  
 
<p>A third analysis by Dr. Haley and colleagues revealed that wartime exposure 
to combinations of chemicals such as chemical nerve agents, flea collars and 
anti-nerve gas pills among some Gulf War veterans were associated with 
chronic neurotoxic syndromes, which may be variants of a rare disorder called 
organophosphate-induced delayed polyneuropathy.   
 
<p>The researchers found that veterans who reported wearing pet flea-and-tick 
collars to repel insects during the war had nearly eight times the risk of 
syndrome-1 than those who never wore the collars.  Veterans who believed they 
had been involved in chemical weapons exposure were nearly eight times more 
likely to have syndrome-2 than those who did not believe they were exposed to 
chemical weapons.  Veterans who had been in a sector of far northeastern Saudi 
Arabia along the Kuwaiti border on the fourth day of the air war were four times 
more likely to have syndrome-2.  The researchers also found that veterans who 
had adverse effects from the anti-nerve gas medication pyridostigmine bromide 
combined with a belief that they had been exposed to chemical weapons were 
five times more likely to have symptoms indicating syndrome-2 than veterans 
who had only one of the risk factors. 
 
<p>The risk of syndrome-3 increased with the amount of government-issued 
insect repellent (containing 75 percent DEET) the veterans typically applied to 
their skin; however this association did not hold true for veterans using other 
types of insect repellent.   
 
<p>The researchers write:  "The findings of our study provide, to our knowledge, 
the first epidemiologic evidence of associations between environmental risk 
factors and systematically defined syndromes in Gulf War veterans.  Each of the 
three primary syndromes were strongly associated with a different set of risk 
factors reflecting possible exposures to different cholinesterase-inhibiting 
chemicals [chemicals that interfere with normal transmission of messages 
between nerve cells or between nerve and muscle cells].  This evidence 
supports our prestated hypotheses that combinations of cholinesterase-inhibiting 
chemicals may have caused variants of a general nervous system injury ..."

the Perot Foundation.  Phillips Medical Systems of North America provided 
financial support for the second article.

<h3><a name="oc6a88"> GULF WAR VETS HAVE HIGHER RATE OF ILLNESS 
THAN OTHER MILITARY PERSONNEL<br> 
Cognitive problems are more than double that of veterans who served outside 
the Gulf</a></h3> 
 
<p>WASHINGTON, D.C.--An Iowa study finds that military personnel who 
served in the Persian Gulf War have a greater prevalence of self-reported 
medical and psychiatric conditions than those serving elsewhere in the military 
during the same time, according to an article in the Jan. 15 issue of <i>The 
Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA).</i> 
 
<p>Researchers in the Iowa Persian Gulf Study Group, developed a telephone 
survey to study a random sample of military personnel who listed Iowa as home.  
Their task was to determine the frequency and type of health complaints 
reported by veterans serving in the Gulf War region and to compare these rates 
of illnesses with those of military personnel serving outside of the Gulf War 
region.. 
 
<p>David A. Schwartz, M.D., M.P.H., the group's principal investigator, and a 
professor at The University of Iowa College of Medicine in Iowa City, released 
the survey findings of 3,695 subjects at a press conference today (Jan. 8). 
 
<p>"Compared with non-Persian Gulf War military personnel, Persian Gulf War 
military personnel reported an 11 percent higher prevalence of symptoms of 
cognitive dysfunction; a nine percent higher prevalence of symptoms of 
fibromyalgia; a six percent higher prevalence of symptoms of depression, a three 
percent higher prevalence of symptoms of anxiety disorder; a two percent higher 
prevalence of symptoms of alcohol abuse, bronchitis, and asthma; a one percent 
increase in post-traumatic stress disorder and chronic fatigue; and an increase 
in the prevalence of sexual discomfort in both the respondent and the female 
partner of the respondent," Dr. Schwartz said.  
 
<p>A total of 14.7 percent of Persian Gulf War military personnel versus 6.6 
percent of non-Persian Gulf War military personnel had symptoms of two or 
more medical and psychiatric conditions. 
 
<p>Persian Gulf War interviewees were asked about known exposures during 
the war.   The researchers found that most of the self-reported Persian Gulf War 
exposures are significantly related to many of the medical and psychiatric 
conditions. 
 
<p>They also found that being involved in the Persian Gulf War substantially 
affected the self-reported assessment of quality of life and functional health.  For 
instance, Persian Gulf War veterans reported significantly lower measures of 
social functioning, mental health and physical functioning.  In fact, among 
Persian Gulf War military personnel, the self-reported medical and psychiatric 
conditions were significantly related to interference with social activities and self-
reports of decreased performance at work.  These findings suggest that the 
Persian Gulf conflict and the medical conditions reported by Persian Gulf military 
personnel substantially impair their daily activities. 
 
<p>Finally, among Persian Gulf War veterans, researchers found relatively few 
differences between the frequency of medical and psychiatric conditions 
reported by the national guard and reservists versus those reported by regular 
military.  The national guard and reserve study group only reported a one 
percent increase in the prevalence of symptoms of chronic fatigue and a four 
percent increase in symptoms of alcohol abuse.  These findings suggest that 
their results apply to all military personnel involved in the Persian Gulf conflict, 
regardless of the type of military service. 
 
<p>The researchers say there may be several explanations for the results.  In 
addition to specific exposures in the Persian Gulf, the investigators consider the 
possibility that the medical and psychiatric conditions that were reported among 
Persian Gulf War military personnel may not be unique to the Persian Gulf War, 
but are analogous to conditions reported by veterans of other wars, dating back 
to the U.S. Civil War and may be caused by the experience of warfare rather 
than by a specific exposure.  Two of several limitations the authors cite 
regarding this study is that Iowa has a relatively low proportion of military 
personnel from minority groups and that the medical and psychiatric conditions 
as well as the exposure data are based exclusively in self-reported information 
and have not been fully characterized by objective physical examination or 
laboratory findings. 
 
<p>Note: This study was supported by a cooperative agreement  with the Iowa 
Department of Public Health and the University of Iowa from the National 
Centers for Environmental Health, CDC, Atlanta, Ga.

<h3><a name="ed6083">QUESTIONS REMAIN UNANSWERED REGARDING 
GULF WAR RELATED ILLNESSES<br> 
Veterans require resources, care, and support</a></h3> 
 
<p>WASHINGTON, D.C.--New studies presenting important findings that 
confirm previous clinical and epidemiologic investigations showing that Persian 
Gulf War veterans have a variety of troubling and sometimes disabling 
symptoms, according to an editorial in the January 15 issue of <i>The Journal of 
the American Medical Association (JAMA).</i> 
 
<p>In his editorial, Philip J. Landrigan, M.D., M.Sc., from the Department of 
Community Medicine at Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, N.Y., 
examines four Persian Gulf War studies appearing in the same issue of 
<i>JAMA</i>.  He presented the information today (Jan. 8) at a press conference. 
 
<p>Dr. Landrigan writes:  "The findings on risk factors should instill a sense of 
etiologic caution in medical practitioners.  Clinicians need to recognize that the 
precise causation of illness in most Persian Gulf War veterans may never be 
known with certainty.  The information on chemical warfare exposure is 
fascinating, and the delays in release of those data are troubling.  However, the 
link between chemical warfare exposure and disease in Gulf War veterans 
certainly has not been proven by these studies." 
 
<p>He asks for continued counseling, support, and symptomatic treatment of 
Gulf War veterans:  "As physicians we should not accept a diagnosis of stress-
related disorder in veterans prior to excluding treatable physical factors, but at 
the same time, we need to recognize the pervasive presence of stress-related 
illness such as hypertension, fibromyalgia, and chronic fatigue among Persian 
Gulf War veterans and manage these illnesses appropriately.  As a nation, we 
need to get beyond the fallacious idea that diseases of the mind either are not 
real or are shameful and to better recognize that the mind and body are 
inextricably linked."  
 
<p>In 1990 and 1991, 697,000 men and women of the U.S. armed forces served 
in the Persian Gulf War.  During their service these veterans were exposed to 
wide array of known and potential hazards to health.  These risk factors include 
extremes of heat and cold, blowing dust, smoke from oil well fires, petroleum 
fuels and their combustion products, pyridostigmine bromide (administered as 
pretreatment for potential poison gas exposure), anthrax and botulinum toxoid 
vaccines, depleted uranium (used in certain artillery shells), infectious diseases, 
chemical warfare agents, pesticides, and pervasive psychological and 
physiological stress, according to information in the editorial. 
 
<p>Dr. Landrigan states:  "Since returning home, many Persian Gulf War 
veterans have developed illness.  Some have specific diseases that clearly 
resulted from their military service ... But perhaps most notably, many more 
veterans have returned with an array of symptoms including fatigue, joint pain, 
gastrointestinal complaints, memory problems, emotional change, impotence, 
and insomnia--that defy diagnostic classification." 
 
<p>He continues:  "In future conflicts and peace-keeping actions, U.S. troops 
will be exposed to myriad adverse physical factors, potentially including 
chemical warfare and biological warfare agents, as well as high levels of stress.  
Good baseline examinations will need to be done on service personnel prior to 
future deployment to form a basis for clinical and epidemiologic studies...  A 
recurrent problem in the epidemiologic studies of Gulf War veterans is that they 
have been mounted after the fact with little baseline data available.  In addition, 
it will be important in the future to intervene proactively to prevent stress-related 
disorders.  The Department of Defense has now deployed a Combat Stress 
Reduction Team with troops in Bosnia and plans to do so elsewhere in the 
future.  While clearly these results need to be to be monitored, this direction is 
highly laudable and needs to be encouraged." 
 
<p>Dr. Landrigan concludes:  "Despite the limitations of current epidemiologic 
studies and clinical investigations and regardless of the unanswered questions 
surrounding the hazards of potential exposures during the Persian Gulf War, 
these veterans will need all the resources and all of the care they are owed by 
this nation that they have so generously and gallantly served."

GENETIC MATERIAL IN GULF WAR-ERA VETERANS</B></CENTER>
<P>
<P><CENTER>Mounting Scientific Evidence Shows Gulf War Vets Were Exposed
to Chemical Agents</CENTER>
<P>Tampa, FL, <B>October 7, 1996 </B>-- The detection of genetic material
found in the blood of Persian Gulf War-era veterans was announced today
at a national conference sponsored by the National Gulf War Resource Center.
 The study, led by research microbiologist Dr. Howard B. Urnovitz, is an
important step in determining the potential research course, consequences,
and treatments for Gulf War veterans.  <BR>
<BR>
Persian Gulf War Related Illnesses (PGWRI) have similarities to illnesses
associated with exposure to organophosphate poisons, such as chemical nerve
agents, as well as many epidemics described under a variety of names related
to epidemic fatigue syndromes (EFS). EFS have, in some cases, been described following specific
viral infections.  The ongoing study tested whether veterans suffering from
PGWRI also had evidence of infections associated with EFS. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;This study strongly supports the concept that microbiological markers
may be associated with this veteran population,&quot; said Dr. Urnovitz,
Chief Science Officer of Berkeley-based Calypte Biomedical.  &quot;We expect
these findings to lead to the development of a diagnostic tool that would
help identify individuals who may be susceptible to Persian Gulf War Related
Illnesses.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;We already know that the veterans appear to have immune anomalies
that might put them at risk for common infections.  The results of this
present study suggest that RNA can be isolated from the serum of Gulf War
veterans that appear to share some similarity to the enterovirus family.
 No similar RNA was found in the control civilian group,&quot; Urnovitz
concluded.<BR>
<BR>
The study examined whether military personnel who developed  symptoms of
PGWRI had the presence of genetic material related to the group of viruses
known as enteroviruses.  Enteroviruses belong to a common virus family (there are several hundred different
types ranging from common cold viruses (rhinoviruses) to those viruses that
cause paralytic polio) and use RNA as their genetic material.  Microbial
agents can be detected by testing for genetic material that makes each agent
unique.<BR>
<BR>
Serum was collected from subjects of three groups:  <BR>
- 22 randomly selected non-military civilians <BR>
- 36 subjects deployed to the Persian Gulf [23 from California and 13 from
Arkansas] <BR>
- 8 soldiers from Arkansas who were not deployed<BR>
<BR>
Using the new technology known as &quot;gene amplification,&quot; the sera
were analyzed for the presence of &quot;nucleic acid bands.&quot;  The presence
of several unique bands were observed in 19 of 23 of the deployed California
veterans, 10 of 13 of the deployed Arkansas veterans, 8 of 8 of the Arkansas
non-deployed veterans, and 1 of 22 non-military civilians.  Analyses of
the nucleic acid sequences indicated that they may be related  to the enterovirus
family.  The results of the study also indicate that some aspect of military
service may predispose individuals to the possibility of developing these
Persian Gulf War Related Illnesses.  The eight soldiers who were not deployed
are apparently healthy, indicating that other factors related to the Persian
Gulf War experience are required to trigger an onset of illness.<BR>
<BR>
Dr.  Marie Chow, Professor of Microbiology, Immunology and Pathology at
the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, one of the investigators
of the Arkansas group, and a known enterovirus expert, cautioned that &quot;while
an actual virus has not been identified, this is an important first step
in trying to determine what contributions microorganisms may play in the
development of PGWRI.  We still have a significant way to go before we understand
the complexity of this multifactorial disease.  There are clearly many factors
underlying these symptoms.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
One critical factor may be the exposure of veterans to chemical agents.
 &quot;This was the most toxic battlefield in the history of modern warfare.
 Studies since World War I show that individuals exposed to chemical agents
and related poisons have manifested symptoms similar to those of the Gulf
War veterans,&quot; said James J. Tuite, III, an international security consultant and former director
of the U.S. Senate Banking Committee investigation into the arming of Iraq
and the health effects of the Persian Gulf War.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The high explosive weapons used to destroy Iraqi chemical munitions
sites and secondary fires forced skyward vapors and toxic by-products from
chemical agents.  Weather patterns moved them as fallout over U.S. and coalition
soldiers.  As favorable conditions developed, the heavier-than-air gases
fell to the ground where their presence was confirmed by multiple scientific
techniques,&quot; he added.<BR>
<BR>
Tuite noted that other factors, including some preventive medicine measures
and other occupational hazards could have exacerbated the effects of this
toxic fallout.  Supported by a growing body of literature, these exposures
may have caused many of the veterans to develop a chronic autoimmune neurologic
disease.<BR>
<BR>
Dr. Robert Garry, Professor of Microbiology at the Tulane University Medical
School, and a known expert in the discovery of novel human viruses and autoimmune
neurologic diseases, emphasizes the importance of this study.  &quot;If
a virus is found to be associated with this disease, significant resources
need to be dedicated to learn whether these microbes are contributing to
the illnesses of returning veterans and their families, as well as birth
defects in their children after the war.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Studies designed to detect microbial agents associated with organophosphate-induced
delayed  neuropathies and epidemic fatigue syndromes are important to understand
the chronic diseases from which many veterans suffer,&quot; said Urnovitz.
 &quot;These symptoms would appear different than the acute symptoms of
toxic chemical exposure.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;PGWRI are not only multifactorial, but are probably multi-hit illnesses
- that is illness development actually requires a combination of several
events.  This study is important because it identifies a measurable factor
which may be associated with a potential hit.  Clearly additional research
must be done to identify the other &quot;hits&quot;  and to determine the
role of these findings in PGWRI,&quot; said Dr. Susan Guba, Assistant Professor
of Medicine and Pathology at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences
and the Little Rock Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, and study
coordinator for the Arkansas group.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;We are seeing many symptoms of chronic diseases that have always been
considered to have some viral component to them.  It will be important to
see if research yields the identity of a possible virus so that we can consider
antiviral therapies as a possible treatment modality,&quot; said Dr. Jean
Higashida, Assistant Clinical Professor of Medicine at the University of
California-Davis, Chief of Rheumatology, Veterans Affairs Northern California
Health Care System, and principal study coordinator for the California veterans
group.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Dr. Urnovitz received his Ph.D. in Microbiology/Immunology at the University
of Michigan Medical School in Ann Arbor, Michigan.  He began studying the
origins of PGWRI in 1994.  Dr. Urnovitz founded Calypte Biomedical (CALY:NASDAQ
small cap) which recently obtained a FDA license for its urine test for
antibodies to the AIDS virus.  <BR>

I wonder how or where or when
  The carousel comes round again
We ride it up
   We ride it down
  We ride so all our hopes are found

Round and round
   Up and down
   Listen - the music that echoes through town.

If I should be a hundred years
  Still it would be! the future mirrors!
We ride it up
   We ride it down
       We ride so all our hopes are found.

Can it be
  Do you see
      This is the lock that like love is a key.

        Now we are finished
    Slowly we stop
       Wait for a moment
Remember your ride.

      This is the story
                 God lead you now
   All our life is a merry go round
 We ride it up
We ride it down
     We ride it so all our hopes are found.

<H4>DESPAIR</H4>

Meaningless the words leap from my head and away,
   Leaving the pen as a barren as an old woman,
Leaving my world as dried and wrinkled and as useless
   As fallen leaves in a forest fire.

I am dead, I died, yet still I live though I died.
  Long ago I died, when I was born I died.
In death my life goes on in a living agony 
Of darkness smothered by the death that keeps my life,
That keeps my life forever.

When I am dead and face my dues,
   No matter where you make my bed
Or what Melodious songs you sing,
Leave me quickly with a prayer

Go your way, your needs attend
But if you should recall sometimes
That I was what I said I was
Then I am glad.

Little rain drops, lonely rain-
Tears of joy,
Tears of sorrow,
Love from the deep, deep sky,

Sweet rain drops, gentle rain,
Falling, falling endlessly,
Kissing each and every living thing,
Living wine to the thirsty Earth.
Cleansing rain-
Washing dirt and dust from a flower peddle,
Cleaning the face of a bird,
Leaving after a shiny new world.

Graceful raindrop, dancing rain
Rolling off a dripping cloud,
Falling upon a leaf
Jumping onto a blade of grass.

Wise raindrops, well traveled rain,
Dropping upon the small winding stream,
Flowing out to sea,
Climbing up a sun made bridge
  To visit land again.

<H4>The Burning Summer</H4>
<PRE>
Like dust the dry leaves blew away-
  Were whirled and tumbled and flown away-
On a wind as drying as the sun, that withered the 
     		grass to yellow-brown hues,
Hard and wild and straining, it crossed the land with the day
And burning, hot naked it tumbled back with the rise
     Of an orange-red moon.

There we  searched brooks,
	That were more than sun baked clay,
Then bare, brown animals we,
	We hung from trees and fell-
		Splashing into the wetness.
But with our shouts we heard-
	no cricket chirp or buzzing bee or rousing locust songs,
And soon to that silent chorus came the dusty throats of frogs.
	Not far we roamed that scorching land:
		Not bird or beast, or insect or boy-
The wild ones we - we waited out the heat.
All through the burning summer until the fall rains came.
	With life for the half dead world.
All through the burning summer we mocked the burning hot,
  Romping in our mud holes and sleeping in the shade.

The stormy wind sea goes rolling,
Tumbling, falling lifting,
Chasing down dusty roads:
In madness, it rushes
Over green fields,
Cut fields, plowed and harvested fields,
Dashes over breakers,
Crashing tree breakers,
The restless, roaring, endlessly tossing wind sea waves.

The clouds float away in an azure sky
Leaving the sun, golden like, shining in my eyes,
To high for me to reach.  And the green grass is too low
For the likes of me to stoop.  So I guess here I'll sit--
Till Mother brings the Cool-Aid.
Too hard to reach my sun glasses, a short two inches away.
A fly sits on my nose and   a-choo!  It flew away;
Crash.
I've reached the grass.  The chair collapses and is sticking 
In my back.  Oh, well.  Brother pours the Cool-Aid
Down his throat and someone turns the sprinkler on:
It's wetting down my clothes.
I wish I had a pillow.

Though I walk through endless days into endless nights,
And sleep upon hard beds and in Nature's unhappy rain.
My feet keep walking, waking to find the hidden ways.
My eyes and mind keep searching for meaning, even in pain.
The heart leads the mind astray in the eyes of  others,
But the mind will cry to say the soul, too, travels its way.
To the stars or the deep's, 
To heaven or damnation,
My feet walk a long, long, long path,
And I sing a soft, soft song.

God the Son is waiting for our fears and joys,
With embracing love for all that come.

Well, I had it with me - I know-
When I came into the house,
It was in my coat pocket-
Or was it with my gloves?
I set it on the radio,
Then moved it to the table - that's 
When I left it alone for - just -
A couple of minutes.
It isn't on this table, or under it,
Or on the chair.
Shake out my clothes?
No - It isn't there either,
But I'm sure it was on the table,
But Maybe it's in my room, though
I don't know how it could be

If I left it here.
Still it must be somewhere,
And, if I look, it might be there.

	  And if Thee wait it is told
 	   That in quiet man finds Gold

Thin lines that dare describe a life,
   Or paint a pale rose with sun light,
Or lift the lowly to exaltation.
Thin lines that rush together or separate,
Lines that create a world of own,
          How astonishing!

The love in me more than hid my human frailties
	But they could not bear my birth upon this green God given Earth.
With such love - so strong - so binding,
	If I should live the thing's they lost!  So I was kept far away.
Forbidden sight or sound or breath,
		The stilled my tiny heart beat.

	I would have given them my heart!
I would have brought them pride and joy!
But, so denied the life God promised I can only watch and wish,
Dear Lord,
	So many dreams untold!

Silver Gray the ship sailed off into a silver mist,
Silver black its smoke, outlined against a silver sky,
And silver sad the souls are that watched its silver wake.
The silver sky to gold turned with morning's glowing sun,
The silver mist became a cloud and the moving sea is calm
But silver sad the souls remain that watched the silver wake.

Margaret M. Leafe

He makes sick people dead
He takes a haughty satisfaction
In eradicating  useless sick people
He makes sad people dead
If they want to die 
Why shouldn't he help
He makes bored people dead
They have nothing else to do

He cries for humanitarian treatment of the sick
Kill them!
Put them out of their misery
Call it Assisted Suicide 
A "dignified" death

The non complaining customer
A  body in a car, parked
	In a park
		In front of the Police Station
	Behind the Hospital
		In an Alley
But not the mortuary

So brave defying law and dignity
	Arrogant and rude to all
		Who disagree
He flaunts his deeds
		Calls himself hero
	And
		Like a spider savoring its meal
The Doctor of Death Delights

How hard should I fight
	To preserve my life
		To keep my blood circulating
	Through my heart
			What purpose should I espouse
To what degree should I proclaim
		"I want to live!
	Preserve me in this present state"
What cost should I sacrifice
		What standards 
	Are sane
But if I should live, no longer able
	To pay for further preservation
What difference
	If when I have the means
I let my body do its cycle
	And when it fails
		Simply die
	Or if put in other words
Why should I stay on such an earth
	When my maker is so close
Why should I run and hid from Him
	When my body is at term
I have a great love of this place
	Of green and blue
		And rainbow hue
			He loves it too
And my whole being cries for Him
	My happiness  not absolute
My accomplishments not fully great
	Earthly existance is imcomplete
If I want to be in fullness
	With the Maker of this earth
		I  will accept when my time is done.

Margaret M. Leafe
August 8, 1996

Clouds mean more to me 
	Than stars
A cloud has shape and size and color
	Stars seem only dots of light

I can see clouds day or night
	 And in moonlight
		Clouds can hid stars

I can touch clouds
	 I can not reach stars

Clouds shift, 
	Come and go in endless
		Diversity
Stars march in abiding formation

I can enter a cloud 
	And come out again
A star would eat me up
		And not spit out my bones

I see fables in clouds
	Enchanting countries
		Infinite Impressions
I see
Stars shine, twinkle, glow
	Rise and set

		 I cannot apprise if stars still exist
	I see stars best in photographs

The human blood is red
No matter what the skin color
The blood is red
No matter the color of the hair
The blood is red
The shape of eyes, the shape of brow
The blood is red
It doesn't matter how smart the mind
The blood is red
Red with oxygen
Red with Platlets
It flows
It pulses
Pushed by a heart
No matter the nationality
The blood is red
No matter the body
A soul lives there
And the blood is red.

If Joy sparks, when wind brushes my face

When sunlight dances off the trees

When life is over then 
Joy will come in earnest

I saw the cormorants flying
Along the hidden shore
Above the buildings tall
They looked so out of place
There should have been Trees and Sand

I saw egrets, Great and White
Fishing in the city pond
While ducks rested in the shade
Of an apartment building
They looked so out of place
There should have been rushes

The careless act that brings so much
A baby's cry,
A broken heart,
Disease, 
Ignorance and Poverty.

The careless act for pleasures sake
Leaving responsibility 
Heaped with the clothes upon the floor,
With the broken heart,
And the baby's cry.

Before the sex there needs to be
Understanding of the deed,
	Willing obligation,
Love and caring,
	Unconditional. 
The Baby and the Heart
	For  Pleasure's sake
Are not meant to be
		 Displaced.

Spring trees tinged with red buds,
  Stand stark lace beside the pine,
Winter worn grass gleams blue and pink and white,
  Before drifting to pale gray,
    As shadow clouds ripple by,
Kissing leaf, twig and bud.
Flushing the earth to black and back,
  Chasing fluffy white flotillas,
     Sailing through
        Blue space.
Golden light,
  Gray light, 
     Black light,
The shadow clouds go dancing,
Lead by fluffy white flotillas.

It was not because....
	It was only that - he was!
		And we went walking hand in hand,
			We went talking word by word,
				Under the sky and across the land.

We found for us there were no days,
	We found for us there were no nights,
		There was just us - walking, walking,
			There was just us - talking, talking,
				Under the sky and across the land.

The altar boy has pictures on his sneakers
And
Who said girls can serve
That baby is crying take him out
Shorts in church!
Who does that Director of Religion think she is
Why does Father make us sing 3 verses
The Mass is too long,  I want to play golf
Do something about the child kicking the pew
And
The priest tells dirty jokes
Discord
Remember Paul writing  churches
Warning 
He said
Knock it off
We have better things to do 
There is no time to criticize each other
 Jesus invited the children
And fed the crowds
 Conciliate the outcast, protected the hooker?
He said
Love  as I love? 
We have no time to fret
About pictures on sneakers
We haven't time to hassle and denunciate
There is too much left to do
We are  the body of Christ
Not boils

NEW YORK (CNN) -- Eight days of military logs covering a 
period when U.S. troops might have been exposed to nerve gas 
and other Iraqi chemical weapons shortly after the 1991 Gulf 
War cannot be found despite an exhaustive search.   
</P>

<P>
The missing documents cover a period when U.S. troops blew up 
an Iraqi chemical weapons depot and could be crucial to Gulf 
War veterans who believe their health problems are linked to 
chemical weapons exposure.
</P>

<P>
A search began earlier this year when the Pentagon 
acknowledged the documents were missing.  On Wednesday, the 
Pentagon said it had failed to find any of the missing pages. 
</P>

<P>
Other portions previously made public show that U.S. 
commanders disregarded several reports of chemical  
detections during the war.
</P>
<A NAME="missing">
<h3>Missing records cover key period</h3>
<IMG SRC="iraq_amm.jpg" ALT="Map showing where ammunition depot was" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="151" HEIGHT="193" BORDER="0" HSPACE="10" VSPACE="5">
<P>
The logs, which appear to have been removed or lost, are from 
March 4 to March 11, 1991.  
</P>



<P>
During that period, U.S. combat engineers blew up the 
sprawling Kamisiyah ammunition depot in southern Iraq, which 
may have exposed thousands of U.S.  troops to nerve gas.
</P>




<P>
The Pentagon has said it only learned last year that  U.S. 
troops may have been exposed to chemical weapons when the 
weapons depot was blown up.  
</P>
<A NAME="logs">
<h3>Logs kept for Schwarzkopf</h3>

<P>
The logs, kept for Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf, were supposed to 
have recorded any incident in which chemical or biological 
agents were detected.
  
</P> 
<P>
"We're trying to determine how many more logs there might be,  
and how they might have been lost," said Bryan Whitman, a 
Pentagon spokesman.  
</P>
 <A NAME="veterans">
<h3>Veterans group request led to discovery</h3>

<P>
The Defense Department, which at one time had denied to  
Congress that such combat records existed, released them last 
year to a Georgia veterans group that sought them under the  
Freedom of Information Act.
</P>

<P>
When the veterans group noted several pages from the logs 
were missing for key dates, the Pentagon said it would  
investigate.
</P>

<P>
But the Pentagon on Wednesday said it had not turned up any 
additional pages that would fill the gaps.  
</P>

<h1>Epidemics of Misunderstanding: Gulf Vets Suffer From Shock of War, Not Gas</h1>
<h2>And Charges of a Coverup Only Make Matters Worse</h2>



<em>By Elaine Showalter  </em><br>

 The Washington Post

<p>
IT WAS a messy modern <B>war</B>, involving immobilized troops in a polluted environment, stores of chemicals and gases, untested new weapons and the threat of a vicious, unscrupulous enemy. When it was over, 80,000 veterans returned to the United States with mysterious symptoms ranging from headaches, joint pains, insomnia and stomach ailments to limps, paralysis and hearing disorders.<p>
No, not the <B>Gulf</B> <B>War</B>, but the Great <B>War</B> -- World <B>War</B> I -- produced these symptoms of what was then called shell shock and has since been named combat fatigue, post-traumatic stress disorder and <B>Gulf</B> <B>War</B> Syndrome. Throughout the 20th century, such psychologically-caused illnesses, whose specific symptoms mutate from decade to decade, have been the legacy of every modern <B>war</B>. Moreover, these syndromes tend to expand and spread when the <B>war</B> is over; by 1929, the number of World <B>War</B> I veterans receiving disability for <B>war</B>-related psychological illness had increased to 115,000.<p>
These symptoms are as genuine and as far beyond the patients' control as any virus or poison. Furthermore, combat neurosis is not a sign of weakness or cowardice but a reaction to conditions that can afflict the most physically fit, courageous and patriotic troops. Dr. Zahava Solomon, an Israeli physician who has studied combat stress reaction, sees it as the result of a process in which "the individual is stripped of his sense of safety and experiences the full thrust of his vulnerability and existential helplessness."<p>
Some <B>Gulf</B> <B>War</B> veterans have sought a single, less psychological explanation for their suffering. They claim that thousands of soldiers may have been contaminated with poison gas during air raids against Iraqi mili  tary targets, and when troops destroyed leftover enemy munitions. Of the 700,000 American troops who   served in the Persian <B>Gulf</B> conflict in 1990-91, 80,000 have now reported ailments from chronic fatigue to skin   rashes and memory loss. About 26,500 are already receiving government disability payments. In England, where the government does not pay disability, there have been only about 700 cases reported out of 45,000 veterans.<p>
But <B>Gulf</B> <B>War</B> Syndrome differs dramatically from earlier cases in the ways that American media have displaced the medical investigation of the illness with charges that the Pentagon and CIA covered up the troops' exposure to chemical agents. Increasingly, the debate has shifted from the causes of the syndrome to whether the government is hiding the truth. Although four independent panels have found no unusual pattern of illness among <B>Gulf</B> <B>War</B> veterans, and no link between chemical exposures and symptoms reported, conspiracy theories and parables of paranoia are so familiar (and even weirdly comforting) in contemporary American culture, that they seem to have overpowered reason.<p>
TV and print journalists have played a significant role in escalating anxieties and exacerbating distrust. Instead of publicizing the scientific consensus that such chemical exposure is highly unlikely to produce delayed health problems, they have cast doubt on the research findings and played up interviews with veterans who are outraged by the mention of psychological factors. <p>
The New York Times, for example, has been setting this tone. Not surprisingly, Kenneth Kizer, undersecretary of health for the Department of Veterans Affairs, wrote the Times complaining that "your coverage seems to focus on exploiting nuances instead of contributing to understanding." But Kizer's letter actually understates the degree to which the paper has covered suspicion rather than fact. In one front page article, published Dec. 3, reporter Philip Shenon wrote that Gen. Colin Powell knew of no evidence that American troops had been exposed to chemical weapons during the <B>war</B>, noting that Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf and former defense secretary Richard Cheney had declined to be interviewed. "Although there is no convincing evidence that American troops were made ill from exposure to Iraqi chemical or biological  weapons during the <B>war</B>," Shenon added gratuitously, "the silence of such major government figures from the <B>war</B> has added to the suspicion of ailing veterans that the Pentagon is withholding evidence that might explain their health problems."<p>
Meanwhile, the tragic stand-off between men and women suffering from the all-too-real after effects of <B>war</B> and government officials unable to pinpoint a specific cause while scientists and doctors are unable to combat the force of rumor and panic, is producing a secondary syndrome of suspicion, accusation and blame.<p>
Recently, for example, a special White House panel of independent experts, the Presidential Advisory Committee on <B>Gulf</B> <B>War</B> Syndrome, concluded that the symptoms were primarily produced by stress, a finding immediately challenged by veterans' groups. But at the same time the committee made front-page headlines for charging that the Pentagon has lost credibility. "There is a lot of suspicion that the government is hiding something," says Rolando Rios, a lawyer on the panel. The committee is recommending yet more investigation by an independent agency. But how can any investigation have credibility in such an atmosphere?<p>
So what should be done? First, journalists could remind readers of the atmosphere leading up to the brief period of combat in the <B>Gulf</B> <B>War</B>, and the many factors that contributed to chronic stress and disorientation for participants. As the Department of Defense reported in 1995, "U.S. troops entered a bleak, physically demanding desert environment, where they were crowded into warehouses, storage buildings and tents with little personal privacy and few amenities. No one knew that coalition forces eventually would win a quick <B>war</B> with relatively few battle casualties. Consequently, most troops did not fight a `four-day <B>war</B>' but spent months isolated in the desert, under constant stress, concern about their survival and their family's well-being at home, and uncertain about when they would return home." Fears that Iraq might use chemical and biological weapons further eroded the psychological immune system.<p>
Second, the media can help reassure Americans about the acceptability of psychotherapy. Studies of Vietnam vets show that many with problems did not seek help from mental health specialists because of ignorance of therapy, fear of stigma and ideals of masculine self-sufficiency. Education about these issues could have made a big difference in the way veterans perceived themselves and were able to seek care without feeling diminished as men. <p>
More important, if the government wants veterans to view the diagnosis of stress-related symptoms as dignified rather than disabling, it has to put its money where its mouth is. Mental-health disability insurance should be the equivalent of physical insurance. A record of combat-related neurosis, successfully treated, should not be a barrier to a distinguished military career. Instead of asking soldiers and   presidential candidates whether they have had psychological counseling as a way to disqualify them, we should honor and publicize public servants strong enough to seek psychological help when they need it.<p>
Third, responsible citizens need to resist the tendency to find answers for perplexing questions in charges of collusion and cabal. In his prophetic masterpiece "The Crucible," Arthur Miller dramatized the ways that a society's paranoia and fear during periods of uncertainty and change can turn into a witch hunt. Such conspiracy theories, as he said in a recent interview, are endemic to American consciousness: "It's always on the edge of our minds that behind what we see is a nefarious plot."<p>
The suffering of <B>Gulf</B> <B>War</B> Syndrome is real by any measure, and the symptoms caused by <B>war</B> neurosis are just as painful and incapacitating as if they were caused by Iraqi chemical weapons, parasites or smoke. But until we can acknowledge that <B>war</B>, even a just <B>war</B>, makes people sick, and that even heroes can be affected by the tensions of modern combat, no objective panels or costly studies can change the likelihood that veterans will seek to dignify their symptoms and reaffirm their patriotism by seeking answers in a nefarious plot.<p>

<center><h2>Pentagon Chief Denies Coverup on Gulf War Illnesses</h2></center>

<h5>By PHILIP SHENON</h5>
<p>   
<p>     Defense Secretary William Perry said Thursday that
any perception that the Pentagon had intentionally withheld
evidence from the public about the possible causes of illnesses
among veterans of the Persian Gulf war was "dead wrong."
<p>   He said the Pentagon had learned only recently of an incident in
March 1991, shortly after the war, in which as many as 20,000 U.S.
troops might have been exposed to chemical weapons as a result of
the demolition of an Iraqi ammunition depot.
<p>   "My concern here is a very deep concern," Perry said at a
year-end news conference at the Pentagon. "The perception among
some that the Defense Department is deliberately holding back
information or that the Defense Department does not care about the
suffering of the veterans of that war  --  those perceptions are dead
wrong."
<p>   He said they were perceptions shared by "some in the media and
a lot of the public."
<p>   Perry, who is about to step down as defense secretary, said the
recent controversy over the issue was one of the major
disappointments of his three-year tenure at the Pentagon.
<p>   "It's been an enormous frustration to me that we've not be able
to, first of all, deal with those perceptions, overcome those
perceptions, along with the frustration that we have not been able
to identify the illness," he said. "Therefore we have not been
able to provide a fully adequate treatment. But we are providing
the best treatment we know how to provide."
<p>   He also denied that any information had been intentionally
withheld from scientists who conducted a 1994 Pentagon
investigation that discounted links between chemical weapons and
the illnesses reported by thousands of gulf war veterans.
<p>   
<p>   
<p>   
<p>   The chairman of that panel, Joshua Lederberg, a geneticist who
is a Nobel laureate and former president of Rockefeller University,
said in an interview earlier this month that the panel's
conclusions would probably have to be revised as a result of newly
disclosed evidence suggesting that soldiers had been exposed to
chemical weapons.
<p>   He said the disclosures made clear the need for intensive
research to determine whether exposure to low levels of nerve gas
and other chemical weapons could lead to long-term health problems.
The Pentagon and the Department of Veterans Affairs have announced
that they are committing millions of dollars to new research on the
issue.
<p>   "Dr. Lederberg had all the information available to him that I
had available to me," Perry said. "We now know that we did not
have sufficient information." He added, "It was not the Defense
Department withholding information from Dr. Lederberg. He and I are
equally frustrated by the fact that information which was important
to his study was not available at that time."
<p>   Government studies have shown that while gulf war veterans did
not die and were not hospitalized at an unusual rate in the first
two and a half years after the war, they did report other health
problems, including digestive ailments, joint pain and chronic
fatigue, at far higher rates than troops who were in the gulf.
<p>   In a report scheduled to be released later this month, a special
White House panel is expected to condemn the Pentagon for its
handling of the investigation of the possible release of chemical
weapons during the gulf war. In a draft report, the panel accused
the Defense Department of a "superficial" investigation that was
"unlikely to provide credible answers to veterans' questions."

(CNN) -- Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf, commander of American 
troops in the 1991 Gulf War, said he did not believe that 
Iraqi chemical weapons had anything to do with the mysterious 
health problems reported by thousands of those troops, The 
New York Times reported on Friday.  
</P>

<P>
A Pentagon official said Thursday "there's no doubt" that 
sarin nerve gas and mustard gas were present at an ammunition 
dump in <A HREF="iraq_amm.jpg">southern Iraq</A> destroyed by U.S. troops shortly after 
the Gulf War.  
</P>

<P>
The Pentagon, which for years said there was no evidence of 
such exposure, also denied Thursday any effort to hide data 
that might show that U.S. military officials at the time knew 
American troops who blew up the Kamisiyah weapons dump in 
March 1991 were contaminated. 
</P>

<P>
<a name="incident"><h3>'I personally know of no incident'</h3></a>
</P>

<P>
In what the Times called the first detailed interview on the  
subject since the Pentagon's announcement this year that 
thousands of troops might have been exposed to nerve gas 
after the destruction of the Kamisiyah depot, the retired 
general said he did not recall any confirmed reports during 
the war that U.S. troops had been exposed to Iraqi chemical 
or biological weapons.  
</P>

<P>
"We had lots of alarms, but I personally know of no  incident 
in which there was any chemical uncovered," Schwarzkopf told 
the Times.

<P>
Schwarzkopf said he did not know why several pages were  
missing from a military log that should have recorded reports 
of chemical or biological detections during the war, the 
Times said. 

</P> 
<P>
Pentagon officials said on Wednesday that despite an 
exhaustive search they had been unable to track down the 
missing  entries from computer disks that had once contained 
the chemical warfare logs.   
</P>

<P>
Schwarzkopf told the Times he never saw the logs, and 
information from them was not routinely brought to his 
attention.   
</P>

</P>

<P>
In the interview with Times, Schwarzkopf also said he 
resented suggestions that he and other commanders hid in an   
airtight bunker in Riyadh to avoid exposure to deadly 
chemicals.  "We were just as susceptible as anybody else," he 
said.  
</P>

<P>
The Pentagon announced last June that U.N. investigators who  
visited the Kamisiyah site in southern Iraq in October 1991 
found canisters thought to contain the nerve gas sarin and 
mustard gas.

<h5>By PHILIP SHENON</h5>
<p>   
<p>     While the Pentagon continues to insist that it
has no evidence that U.S. troops were made sick from exposure to
Iraqi chemical weapons during the Persian Gulf war in 1991, more
than 150 veterans of a Naval reserve battalion have come forward
with details of what many of them describe as an Iraqi chemical
attack that has left them seriously ill.
<p>   Members of the unit, the 24th Naval Mobile Construction
Battalion, say something exploded in the air over their camps in
northern Saudi Arabia early on the morning of Jan. 19, 1991, the
third day of the gulf war.
<p>   Within minutes, many say, their skin began to burn, their lips
turned numb and their throats began to tighten. Several say
chemical alarms began to sound as a dense cloud of gas floated over
their camps.
<p>   "I put my gas mask on right away, but by the time I got to the
bunker, my hands and face were burning, and I couldn't breathe,"
said Roy Butler, a 53-year-old former Navy petty officer from
Columbus, Ga., who served in the 24th and who now said he suffers
from chronic fatigue, joint aches, memory loss and mysterious
gastrointestinal ailments and rashes  --  all symptoms that are
considered typical of "gulf war syndrome."
<p>   "Right after I got into the bunker, my lips started turning
numb, and the numbness lasted for several days" Butler said. "We
washed down and that seemed to help, but people started coming up
with blisters."
<p>   Battalion commanders later insisted that the explosive noise was
actually a sonic boom and that there was no need for alarm. But
within weeks of the blast, many of the men of the 24th were sick
with debilitating ailments that, they say, have lasted to this day.
<p>   Until this spring, the Defense Department had denied that it had
any evidence suggesting that large numbers of U.S. troops were
exposed to chemical weapons in the gulf war. Then in June, it
acknowledged that soldiers in an Army unit, the 37th Engineer
Battalion, could have been exposed when they destroyed an
ammunition depot in southern Iraq in March 1991 that was later
determined to have contained sarin, a deadly nerve gas.
<p>   In disclosing that incident, the Pentagon originally suggested
that 300 to 400 troops might have been exposed to chemical weapons
at the depot. Wednesday, the Defense Department said a second
explosion at the same depot a week later raised the figure to more
than 5,000 troops.
<p>   Pentagon officials continue to insist that they have no evidence
of other large-scale exposures. They said they had reviewed the
incident involving the 24th Battalion in Saudi Arabia and found no
sign of unusual illnesses.
<p>   Several of the Navy reservists called a reporter after the
Pentagon's earlier announcement about the 37th Engineer Battalion,
saying they believed that they might have also been exposed to
Iraqi chemical weapons.
<p>   Of the nearly 750 reservists who served in the 24th Naval Mobile
Construction Battalion who served in the unit in the gulf, 152
veterans were interviewed for this article; 114 said they were sick
with illnesses they attribute to the war. Dozens say that they have
repeatedly been hospitalized and that they have been forced to give
up their jobs and careers.
<p>   Their accounts, strikingly consistent, and supported in some
important points by newly declassified documents, present a new
challenge to the Pentagon, which has come under intense criticism
over its handling of the claims by thousands of gulf war veterans
who say they were victims of Iraqi chemical and biological weapons.
<p><a name=1>   
<p>   <b>THE CONTRADICTIONS: Similar Ailments And Explanations</b>
<p>   
<p>   Scientists remain baffled by the ailments suffered by gulf war
veterans, with some researchers suggesting that troops may have
been exposed to low levels of Iraqi chemical or biological agents.
<p>   Pentagon officials and other researchers remain skeptical,
noting that there is still no clear evidence showing that gulf war
veterans are more sickly than other troops, or that the chemicals
involved could have produced the broad range of symptoms reported.
<p>   But many of the veterans are clearly ill. Of the nearly 700,000
U.S. troops who served in the war, 80,000 have sought special
government health screenings to determine whether they are
suffering from ailments related to the war.
<p>   In a statement prepared in response to a reporter's questions,
the Pentagon confirmed that a review of its battle records showed
that the loud noise heard by members of the 24th Battalion on Jan.
19, 1991, was probably the explosion of an Iraqi Scud missile.
<p>   That contradicts initial reports from battalion officers who
insisted in 1991 that the noise had been a sonic boom produced by a
jet fighter or bomber passing overhead.
<p>   "Reports confirm that a Scud missile aimed toward Dhahran was
intercepted at high altitude in the area around the time of the
report incident," the Pentagon statement said. The air base at
Dhahran, a large city on the eastern coast of Saudi Arabia, was a
principal staging area for U.S. air strikes on Iraq.
<p>   But although the Iraqis had threatened before the war to arm
their Scud missiles with chemical and biological weapons, the
Pentagon said it had thoroughly investigated the complaints of
members of the 24th Battalion. The statement said that the burning
skin and other discomfort reported by the reservists in the camps
were not consistent with a chemical attack, and that the ailments
were probably caused by rocket propellent.
<p>   Still, that leaves open the mystery of why so many veterans of
the 24th Battalion report they are now sick with similar ailments,
and why their illnesses began shortly after the mysterious
explosion over the desert skies of Saudi Arabia that January
morning.
<p>   Chemical weapons were detected in the camps in northern Saudi
Arabia on Jan. 19, in the areas around the city of Jubail, where
the 24th Battalion was stationed.
<p>   
<p>   Newly declassified combat logs maintained by an officer working
for Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf, the U.S. commander in the war,
reported a "chemical attack at Jubail" early on the morning of
Jan. 19. A separate entry in the log shows that a British soldier
reported that night that chemical-detection paper had registered
"mustard positive," a reference to mustard gas.
<p>   Harold J. Edwards, a reservist who was a member of the 24th
battalion, remembered using three chemical detection devices, which
are known as M-256 kits, to measure the air after he heard the
explosions that morning. Two of the three tests, Edwards said,
showed that mustard gas was wafting over the reservists. "It's
damn hard to mess up those tests," he said.
<p>   The Pentagon said that the mustard-gas detections identified in
Schwarzkopf's logs later proved to be false alarms, and that a
reservist stationed a few miles away from Edwards had used similar
detection kits and found no chemical agents.
<p>   In its statement, the Defense Department said that rocket
propellent could produce false alarms on detection equipment, and
that this was probably the explanation for Edward's findings for
mustard gas. But that assertion is in some doubt, possibly even
within the military itself.
<p>   A spokesman for the U.S. Army Chemical School in Fort McClellan,
Ala., the military's premier training center for chemical
specialists, said the school knew of no research suggesting that
the rocket propellent, Red Fuming Nitric Acid, would cause a false
positive on an M-256 kit. "No, we have not tested with that
particular compound," said Hershal Chapman, the spokesman.
<p>   The interviews with the Naval reservists and an exhaustive
review of confidential military documents and combat logs about the
incident also show the following:
<p>    --  Gulf War veterans from the 24th Naval Construction Battalion
and the Army 37th Engineer Battalion, the unit that blew up the
ammunition Iraqi depot in March 1991, describe remarkably similar
health problems: gastrointestinal problems; mysterious tumors and
rashes, chronic fatigue and memory loss.
<p>    --  The 1994 Navy study that found no special health problems
among gulf war veterans of the 24th Battalion appears to have been
based on an incomplete investigation. Navy investigators
interviewed veterans who had remained in the reserves, ignoring
scores of other gulf war veterans who had left the reserves  -- or who
been forced out  --  for health reasons.
<p>   ("There are currently no indications that would lead us to
believe that active-duty members were any different from those who
left active duty," the Pentagon said, explaining why the former
reservists were not interviewed.)
<p>    --  Several gulf war veterans who remain in the 24th Battalion
said in interviews that they were sick with what they described as
war-related ailments. But they said they could not reveal their
illnesses to the Navy for fear that their outspokenness would
result in dismissal from the reserves on a pretext of health
problems, often at the cost of their military pensions.
<p>    --  A doctor with the Department of Veterans Affairs who has cared
for many of of gulf war veterans from the 24th Battalion said the
Pentagon and the department were ignoring obvious evidence that the
veterans had been made sick by their service in the gulf war,
possibly through exposure to chemical or biological weapons.
<p>   "There's something going on," said the physician, Dr. Charles
Jackson, who works in the Veterans medical center in Tuskegee, Ala.
"I don't know what they're hiding."
<p><a name=2>   
<p>   <b>THE EXPLOSION: 'Yellow-Green Fog,' 'Burning Sensation'</b>
<p>   
<p>   What happened in the dun-colored northern deserts of Saudi
Arabia at 3 a.m. on Jan. 19, 1991, the third day of the allied
attack against Iraq in the gulf war, remains a terrifying memory
for many members of the 24the Naval Construction Battalion.
<p>   The battalion, a reserve unit based in Huntsville, Ala., was
made up of about 750 construction specialists, or Seabees, drawn
from across the southern United States. Many of them were Vietnam
War veterans who had returned to civilian life and had chosen to
remain connected with the military through the reserves.
<p>   During the war, most of the reservists were housed in two camps
a few miles apart near the eastern port city of Jubail, along the
Persian Gulf.
<p>   "I remember getting woke up by this humongous explosion  --  it
almost knocked us out of our bunks," said Butler, who retired from
the reserves in 1991, after 26 years of military service because of
the health problems that he says began with the explosion that
night. "I'm a Vietnam War vet, and my thoughts were that it was a
rocket."
<p>   Several reservists said they were instantly convinced that the
explosion was caused by the detonation of one of the Iraqi Scud
missiles that had begun to rain down nightly on Jubail and other
cities in Saudi Arabia during those early days of the war.
<p>   It was a thought, they said, that terrified them, given the
threat of Iraq's president, Saddam Hussein, to arm the missiles
with toxins drawn from his arsenal of chemical and biological
weapons.
<p>   Jerry Jones, a 53-year-old mechanic from Leicester, N.C., said,
"The concussion was so strong that it knocked me to my knees." As
he ran to a bunker, he recalled "a yellow-green fog or mist
floating through the air." And it was then, Jones said, that his
skin began to burn.
<p>   "I went to the bunker and what skin I had exposed, like my
hands and my neck, had like a burning sensation to it," said
Jones, who said he was forced to take early retirement from the
North Carolina government because of ailments that developed after
the war, including chronic fatigue and memory loss. "The seal
broke on my protective mask around my jaw, and my lips had a
numbing sensation."
<p>   
<p>   Robert R. Nesselrotte, a 63-year-old retired technician from
Columbus, Ga., said it took him about three minutes to find his
rubberized chemical-protective suit and pull it on. By then,
Nesselrotte said, it may have been too late.
<p>   "I noticed that my lips felt numb, like I had novocain, and I
could taste a funny taste  --  metallic, like you had licked your
tongue over a piece of metal," he said. "I noticed my neck and my
cheeks were burning, and I knew for sure enough we'd gotten
gassed."
<p>   Nesselrotte says he suffers today from severe fatigue, chronic
headaches, spasms in his limbs and daily bouts of nausea.
<p>   "Before the war, I never had a serious health problem," he
said. "I was one of the healthiest guys there was. Now I wake up
every morning feeling sick."

<p>   <b>THE PROTECTIVE GEAR: Naval Reservists Certain of Attack</b>
<p>   
<p>   For Edwards, the petty officer who had the chemical-detection
equipment, there was no mystery about what was going on. The 24th
Battalion, he said, was under attack from mustard gas.
<p>   He recalled pulling on his gas mask and chemical suit and
testing the wind with M-256 detection kits. The M-256 is a
hand-held chemistry set that measures the air for chemical weapons;
tiny glass ampuls are broken above litmus paper that changes color,
depending on what chemical agents are in the air. The kits are
considered highly precise.
<p>   "When the sirens go off, I had a habit of getting the test kits
out," Edwards said. He recalled that two of the three test kits
detected mustard gas.
<p>   Edwards, 54, who is still in the reserves, said he was still
healthy, as were the troops who worked with him, because he
insisted that they learn to pull on their chemical-protection suits
at the first sounding of an alarm.
<p>   "I could put one on in probably 15 seconds," he said. "All my
guys could do that because we practiced our rear ends off."
<p>   Many of the reservists from the 24th Battalion who have since
gotten ill, he said, were those who had failed to pull on their
suits and gas masks.
<p>   "A lot of guys had the idea that a macho hombre can't get
hurt," he said.
<p>   Edwards said he immediately reported the mustard-gas detection
to his superiors in the camp. But the next morning, he said, the
word came back from the officers that "nothing had happened,
forget it, don't say anything."
<p>   Edwards said he had feared that he would be disciplined if he
continued to discuss his detection of chemical weapons. "What do
you do?" he said. "You shut up."
<p>   Other members of the battalion say they quickly came to suspect
that the military was trying to hide the truth of what had happened
that morning. Their suspicions began, they said, when officers in
the 24th Battalion told them that the blast that morning had been
caused by a sonic boom from a jet fighter of bomber passing
overhead. The reservists said they were ordered not to discuss the
matter again.
<p>   "Nobody believed it was a sonic boom  --  nobody," said James
Johnson, 38, of Phenix City, Ala., who complains today of severe
respiratory ailments, chronic diarrhea, fatigue and rashes "all up
and down my legs and forearms."
<p>   "I've been in the military most of my life," he said, "and I
know that a sonic boom doesn't leave a flash of red light in the
damn sky."
<p>   In a statement, the Pentagon said that there may have been a
sonic boom  --  but that it was produced by the missile that exploded,
not by a plane. James Turner, a Defense Department spokesman, said
he did not believe that there had been any attempt to deceive the
reservists. "There's been no attempt by anyone I'm aware of to
deceive anybody," Turner said.
<p>   An officer in the 24th Battalion, Lt. Craig Young, said he
continued to believe that the noise over the desert sky early that
morning was caused by a sonic boom from a plane. Young said he had
no idea why some of his fellow reservists were not falling ill.
<p>   "I honestly believe it was a jet flying over, a sonic boom,"
said Young, 33, who lives in Atlanta. "I doubt that this was
something that caused health problems."
<p>   Asked about the accounts by Edwards that he had reported the
detection of mustard gas that morning to his superiors, Lieutenant
Young denied it.
<p>   "If there was a positive response from Edwards, I would have
known about it," he said, suggesting that Edwards was a braggart
who was making up the story. "He would go around telling stories
to a lot of young petty officers way before this incident."
<p>   But Young confirmed that he and other officers had urged members
of the 24th Battalion not to discuss what had happened in the sky
over their camps on Jan. 19, for fear that rumors of a chemical
attack might spread, disrupting morale.
<p>   "We put out to the first-class petty officers that you
shouldn't go around talking about this stuff," said Young, who
said he had remained healthy since the war and who is still in the
reserves.
<p>   "I wouldn't call it an order, but we did say, 'Hey, look guys,
keep your guys calm, keep them focused.' " He said Edwards
"probably was told separately to keep his mouth shut," although
this was not meant as a "cover up or anything."

<p>  <b> THE MILITARY RECORDS: Two Allied Teams Detected Nerve Agents</b>
<p>   
<p>   Military logs maintained for Schwarzkopf, the U.S. commander in
the Persian Gulf War, suggest that something did happen early on
the morning of Jan. 19 near Jubail, where the men of the 24th
Battalion were stationed.
<p>   The newly declassified logs were obtained last year by a
veterans group, the Gulf War Veterans of Georgia, under a Freedom
of Information request. They show that at 4:30 on the morning of
Jan. 19, U.S. forces in Saudi Arabia received an alert of a
"chemical attack at Jubail."
<p>   Because the document was edited by the Defense Department on
security grounds, it is not clear from the document who sounded the
alert.
<p>   At 4:40, the log shows, a British soldier in the region  --  the
logs do not identify the soldier by name  --  reported that
chemical-detection paper was "getting a mustard positive."
<p>   
<p>   The logs show that after a time, "there were no positive
readings," suggesting that if mustard gas had been released in the
area, it had dissipated to the point where it could no longer be
detected.
<p>   That same day, chemical weapons were detected elsewhere in
northern Saudi Arabia. Detection equipment manned by Czech soldiers
found low levels of nerve agent at two separate locations near the
Saudi city of Hafr al-Batin, about 200 miles northeast of Jubail.
<p>   A team of French troops also reported "infinitesimal amounts of
nerve and blister agent" that day in the vicinity of the sprawling
military complex at King Khalid Military City, which is near Hafr
al-Batin.
<p>   The Pentagon has officially described the Czech detections as
"credible," given the sophistication of the Czech equipment, but
the Defense Department has said consistently that it has no
evidence that U.S. soldiers ever came into contact with the
chemical agents that were detected by the Czechs.
<p>   Pentagon officials have said that French chemical equipment is
less reliable. Still, according to a Defense Department report on
the issue released last month, the French report "cannot be
discounted."
<p>   <a name=5>
<p> <b>  THE SYMPTOMS: Formerly Healthy Men Now Report Sickness</b>
<p>   
<p>   Whatever happened on the morning of Jan 19, 1991, there is no
doubt that many of the reservists who served with the 24th Naval
Mobile Construction Battalion are ill, and that they are suffering
from the same host of ailments that are commonly dubbed Gulf War
Syndrome: chronic fatigue and headaches, gastrointestinal ailments,
rashes, aching joints and memory loss.
<p>   While the Gulf War veterans interviewed for this article are by
no means a scientific sample  --  they were located primarily through
battalion rosters and information provided by other veterans  -- 
there is a remarkable amount of illness among a large group of men
who were certified to be in good health and in good shape when they
left for the war.
<p>   Many of the former reservists in the 24th Battalion are still
young. Michael Tidd, a 40-year-old self-employed plumber, said that
"before the war I hiked, raced, backpacked, canoed."
<p>   But after the war, he fell ill, and he now suffers from joint
problems, chronic fatigue, and gastrointestinal ailments that force
him to take antacids and ulcer medicines. "I take Pepcid or
Tagamet every morning  --  every morning," he said.
<p>   Eddie Nichols, a 41-year-old police officer from Asheville,
N.C., said he was certain that his numerous health problems had
resulted from the Gulf War because "before the war, I had zero
health problems  --  I was a nonsmoker, fit.
<p>   "Now, I've got fatigue all the time," he said. "If I went to
bed tonight and slept 10 hours, I'd still feel like I didn't get
any sleep at all. I've had real bad headaches, diarrhea, a lot of
stomach problems."
<p>   He said that because of health problems, the state police force
had forced him off a special drug interdiction team about a year
after he returned from the war.
<p>   "They took me off it because of my physical condition,"
Nichols said. "They didn't want to take any chances. I might
endanger somebody else's life. And if my condition doesn't get any
better, they're going to have to release me from the force,
period."
<p>   Thomas E. McIlwain, a 59-year-old heavy equipment operator who
is also from Asheville, said that before the Gulf War, "I was in
superb shape. I could keep up with any 23, 24-year-old Seabee."
<p>   But shortly after the war, "I started feeling completely
fatigued, exhausted," he said. "And I couldn't keep up with my
job. A lot of times, I'd have to hide from people just to rest."
<p>   "I have severe nausea, I have a severe skin rash that comes and
goes," he said. "The top of my head is just scarred all over from
sores."
<p>   Many of the veterans complain of puzzling bouts of memory loss
since the war. "The thing that bothers me the most is my memory,"
said Gary Linder, a 49-year-old maintenance shop foreman of
Opelika, Ala.
<p>   "There are times when I can be sitting doing my reports at work
and forget what I'm doing," he said. "I literally have to write
myself a note to remember anything. I put the notes in my truck.
Sometimes there are 50 little notes in the truck. And sometimes my
memory is so bad that I forget to read the notes."
<p>   But like thousands of other Gulf War veterans, the men of the
24th Battalion say they face a wall of resistance when they seek
medical care for their ailments, especially from the Veterans
Administration hospitals that many of them turn to because they
lack the money for private health care.
<p>   "The VA is not concerned," said James L. Hallman, 48, a 24th
Battalion veteran from Remlap, Ala., who has suffered from chronic
fatigue, headaches, joint pains and respiratory ailments since the
war.
<p>   "If you're not shot or wounded by shrapnel or there's some
other obvious physical injury, then they say you're not sick, that
you don't deserve anything," he said. "They say it's in your
head."
<p>   Jackson, the Veterans Administration physician in Tuskegee, said
he had treated more than 20 Gulf War veterans from the 24th
Battalion and that he was "convinced that there was some chemical
exposure in the gulf  --  there's no question in my mind about it."
<p>   Still, he said, the Pentagon and the Department of Veterans
Affairs, seemed unwilling to listen to the evidence. "This is not
psychological," he said. "These people are sick."
<p>   <a name=6>
<p>  <b> THE NAVY STUDY: Former Reservists Were Not Screened</b>
<p>   
<p>   After several veterans of the 24th Battalion complained of
ailments that they related to the Gulf War, the Navy agreed in 1993
to study their illnesses.
<p>   But the study, completed in October 1994, largely dismissed
their complaints, finding that while many of the veterans had
complained of illness, "the overall types and numbers of diagnoses
appear to be what would be expected in a group this age who had not
served in Operations Desert Shield and Storm."
<p>   The methods used by the Navy investigators raise questions about
the study's thoroughness. Although the study was carried out more
than two years after the war, the Navy report shows that the
investigators only interviewed Gulf War veterans who had remained
in the reserves  --  not the scores of veterans who had left the
reserves soon after the war because of health problems they
attributed to the Gulf War.
<p>   And it is not clear that the investigators received truthful
answers from the reservists they did interview. Many of the Gulf
War veterans who remain in the 24th Battalion said in interviews
that they are sick, but did not tell that to the naval
investigators for fear of being forced out of the reserves on
health grounds.
<p>   "Nobody wants to hear that we're sick, that there's a
problem," said a reservist in his early 30s from North Carolina
who served in the Gulf War, and who spoke on condition that he not
be named. He said he suffered from severe memory loss and chronic
gastrointestinal problems that he attributed to the war.
<p>   "So we're keeping our mouths shut. We want to stay in the
reserves. We know they that they want to pretend that everybody who
came back from the Gulf War is healthy, even if they're not."

Web posted at: 11:20 p.m. EST</FONT>

<P>
From Correspondent Jeff Levine
</P>

<P>
WASHINGTON (CNN) -- While the Gulf War allies were victorious on the battlefield, researchers thus far are being defeated in efforts to find out what has made so many of the veterans sick.
</P>

<P>
But two new studies indicate the veterans are not much more likely to die or be hospitalized than soldiers who did not fight in the region.  
</P>

<P>
Such research may seem to some veterans to conflict with their medical complaints.
</P>

<IMG SRC="wagner.jpg" ALT="Wagner" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="100" HEIGHT="115" BORDER="0" HSPACE="10" VSPACE="5">

<P>
"I am now on prescribed medication, which I will have to continue for the rest of my life. I will never fly aircraft again, in the military or as a civilian," Maj. Matthew Wagner, of the Marine Corps reserve, told a presidential advisory committee Wednesday. 
</P>

<br clear=all>
<IMG SRC="tack.jpg" ALT="Tack" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="103" HEIGHT="115" BORDER="0" HSPACE="10" VSPACE="5">
<P>
Jeffrey Tack, 28, of Lexington, Kentucky, is now crippled by Lou Gehrig's disease.
</P>

<P>
"To me, it seems to be a simple case of cause and effect," Tack told the panel. "I was healthy before going to the Gulf. I spent five months in the Gulf, and I returned ill."
</P>


<P>
Whether Gulf vets have died at a rate higher than those who did not fight in the war has been an important question for researchers. 
</P>

<P>
A study of more than one million soldiers published in the New England Journal of Medicine shows a higher accidental death rate: 17 percent for men, 78 percent for women. One reason the rate for women appears so much higher may be that there were fewer women than men serving in the Gulf.
</P>

<P>
Doctors say the higher accidental death rate points more to stress or depression than physical illness. In other words, the overall health of Gulf vets was not observed to be that different from a comparable soldier population that did not serve there.
</P>
<IMG SRC="murphy.jpg" ALT="Murphy" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="100" HEIGHT="130" BORDER="0" HSPACE="10" VSPACE="5">
<P>
"Veterans should be reassured by this result, because it shows that there is no increase in life-threatening medical disease in Persian Gulf veterans," said Dr. Frances Murphy of the Department of Veterans Affairs.
</P>

<P>
Another large-scale study of troops that stayed on active duty after the war indicated they were not more likely to go to the hospital. In fact, the study reported in the medical journal they were less likely to be hospitalized than other soldiers.
</P>
<BR CLEAR=ALL>
<IMG SRC="committe.jpg" ALT="committee" ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="150" BORDER="0" HSPACE="10" VSPACE="5">
<P>
The Presidential Advisory Committee on Gulf War Veterans' Illnesses is winding up its analysis of Gulf War illness. It has all but ruled out a "syndrome," but the panel is considering everything from stress to possible chemical exposure.
</P>

<P>
"Our key findings, and my personal view about where the system let down the veterans of this war, are that it took too long to mount a serious investigation of the many possible causes for Gulf War illness," said committee member Arthur Caplan, of the University of Pennsylvania. 
</P>

<P>
Gulf War veterans have reported a variety of unexplained

<p><center>      5,000 U.S. Troops May Have Been Exposed to Nerve Gas in Iraq
</center><p></p>
<p>September 19, 1996
<p><font size="-1">By PHILIP SHENON
<p></p>   
<p>  ASHINGTON  --  The Defense Department announced Wednesday night
that more than 5,000 U.S. troops may have been exposed to chemical
weapons when a battalion of U.S. soldiers blew up an Iraqi
ammunition depot days after the end of the Persian Gulf war.
<p> The announcement by the Pentagon raises sharply the number of
troops who may have been exposed to sarin, a deadly nerve agent, as
a result of the demolition of the Kamisiyah ammunition depot in
southern Iraq in March 1991, and it will doubtless prompt
speculation about why the information is being revealed only now,
more than five years after the war.
<p>   Previously, the Pentagon had suggested that only about 300 to
400 troops may have been exposed to the toxic chemicals, and that
it knew of only one location within the massive Iraqi ammunition
site that may have contained chemical agents at the time of the
demolition by U.S. troops. That site, a concrete bunker, was
destroyed March 4, 1991.
<p>   In a statement released here Wednesday evening, the Defense
Department said its investigators had learned only recently of a
second site within the ammunition depot that had contained chemical
weapons  --  a pit area where U.S. troops destroyed Iraqi rocket
shells March 10.
<p>   Thousands of Gulf War veterans have complained of health
problems  --  especially mysterious gastrointestinal ailments, chronic
fatigue, headaches, and tumors  --  that they attribute to their
exposure in the Gulf. Some researchers have suggested that the
health problems are the result of exposure to low levels of Iraqi
chemical or biological weapons, although the Pentagon says it has
no evidence of a link.
<p>   The announcement Wednesday night suggests that two plumes of
chemical agents  --  released into the atmosphere less than a week
apart  --  may have wafted over U.S. soldiers miles away. "Low-level
exposures may have taken place out to 25 kilometers from the
Kamisiyah complex," the statement said. Twenty-five kilometers is
equivalent to about 15 miles.
<p>   The Pentagon said in the statement that it "will begin
notifications immediately to about 5,000 servicemen who were in the
possible dispersion area. As we learn more about Kamisiyah in these
next few weeks, we expect to identify more troops who might have
been exposed." It was not clear from the statement how many more
troops might have been exposed.
<p>   Capt. Michael Doubleday, a Pentagon spokesman, said the
information was released late in the day because "our goal is to
notify Gulf War veterans as quickly as possible."
<p>   He said it was only Wednesday evening that Defense Department
press officers and investigators studying the issue of gulf war
illnesses were able to complete a public statement, which was then
faxed to reporters. "As soon as we were certain of the
information, we announced it," he said.
<p>   The announcement that thousands of U.S. soldiers may have been
exposed to low levels of nerve gas will doubtless be taken by many
ailing Gulf War veterans as additional proof that their illnesses
are related to their service in the Gulf.
<p>   It may also raise new questions about the Pentagon's credibility
on the issue given its repeated statements until this year that it
had no evidence that large numbers of Americans were exposed to
Iraqi chemical weapons.
<p>   Earlier this month, a White House advisory panel accused the
Pentagon of conducting a "superficial" investigation of possible
chemical exposures and urged that the inquiry be turned over to an
outside body.
<p>   "This is a disclosure that really should have been made years
ago," said James J. Tuite III, a former congressional investigator
who led a Senate Banking Committee inquiry in 1993 and 1994 into
Gulf War illnesses. "It's a crack in the dike. The Pentagon
position is beginning to unravel, and they're going to have to
admit that many, if not all troops, were exposed to some level of
chemical warfare agents."
<p>   It was only this year that the Pentagon announced that U.S.
troops may have been exposed to chemical weapons when they blew up
a concrete bunker at Kamisiyah that, United Nations investigators
later determined, had contained sarin.
<p>   After interviewing veterans of the Army battalion involved in
the demolition, the 37th Engineer Battalion, the investigators
learned from the veterans "that members of the 37th Battalion
destroyed stacks of crated munitions in the pit area on March 10,
1991," the statement said. "Information about the destruction of
chemical weapons in the pit area has been developed since that
time."
<p>   Wednesday night's Pentagon announcement said that it was unclear
how many of the chemically tipped 122 mm Iraqi rockets had been
destroyed in the pit. In 1992, United Nations investigators used
the same pit to destroy 464 rockets containing nerve gas. Their
destruction techniques, unlike those used by the U.S. troops the
year before, were destined to prevent release of chemical weapons
into the atmosphere.
<p>   While the Pentagon has insisted that it did not know until last
fall of the possibility of exposures of U.S. soldiers to chemical
weapons at Kamisiyah, a government intelligence report recently
made public shows that the White House, the CIA and the Pentagon
were all alerted in late 1991 of the presence of chemical weapons
at the depot.
<p>   It was only this year, the Pentagon said, that Defense
Department analysts realized that U.S. soldiers had blown up the
same ammunition depot in March 1991, and that they might have been
exposed to chemical agents as the giant plume rose into the sky
over southern Iraq. Many of the veterans of the 37th Engineer
Battalion have since complained of debilitating health problems.

<p>   
<p>    Six months after the Pentagon's momentous
announcement that U.S. troops may have been exposed to clouds of
nerve gas and other Iraqi chemical weapons shortly after the
Persian Gulf war, no one yet knows the cause of the chronic health
problems reported by tens of thousands of Gulf war veterans.
<p>   Some of the illnesses may be the result of exposure to chemical
weapons, as many Gulf war veterans insist.

Here is a brief chronology of the American military's chemical exposure in
the Persian Gulf war, and the Pentagon's comments about it. <br><br>

<b>Jan. 20, 1991</b>  Logs from the American military headquarters in
Riyadh show evidence of chemical weapons in northern Saudi Arabia. <br><br>

<b>Feb. 24, 1991</b>  The ground war begins and lasts four days. Gen. H.
Norman Schwarzkopf, the allied commander, calls initial reports of
biological or chemical weapons "bogus." <br><br>

<b>March 4, 1991</b>  American combat engineers blow up part of the
Kamisiyah ammunition depot in southern Iraq.<br><br>

<b>October 1991 </b> Inspectors find evidence that chemical weapons had
been stored at Kamisiyah.<br><br>

<b>Late 1991</b>  The first gulf war veterans seek medical care.<br><br>

<b>March 16, 1994</b>  Senator Donald W. Riegle, a Michigan Democrat, asks
the Pentagon for log books maintained by the United States Central
Command.<br><br>

<b>April 15, 1994</b>  The Pentagon says the logs do not exist.<br><br>

<b>May 4, 1994</b>  Cabinet officials tell Senator Riegle that nothing
indicates enemy use of chemical or biological weapons.<br><br>

<b>January 1995</b>  The Pentagon releases portions of the
chemical-detection logs. Most of the pages are missing.<br><br>

<b>April 26, 1996</b>  The incoming Director of Central Intelligence, John
M. Deutch, says he believes "we have no compelling evidence of chemical or
biological use in the gulf war."<br><br>

<p>   Other veterans almost certainly suffer from the physical
aftereffects of wartime stress, a phenomenon seen after other wars,
or from exposure to a number of other chemicals, including
pesticides, smoke from oil-well fires, or the experimental drugs
that were given to the troops to protect them from nerve gas.
<p>   Yet even if the medical mystery is never solved, this much has
become painfully clear to many of the 700,000 men and women who
served in the brief but intense war against Iraq and its president,
Saddam Hussein, in 1991:
<p>   The files of the defense department and other government
agencies held extensive evidence suggesting that U.S. soldiers had
been exposed to Iraqi chemical weapons in the war, even as the
government assured the veterans and the public that no such
evidence existed.
<p>   After years of denials the Pentagon now acknowledges that more
than 20,000 troops may have been exposed when a battalion of U.S.
combat engineers blew up the Kamisiyah ammunition depot in the
southern Iraqi desert in March 1991.
<p>   Almost daily since that announcement in June, the government has
been confronted with new disclosures on the issue  --  about the
thousands of chemical-detection alarms that sounded throughout the
war, about the eagerness of U.S. commanders to dismiss what
soldiers considered to be valid chemical detections, about the
callousness that many veterans faced when they sought medical care
after the war.
<p>   While the relationship between these episodes and the veterans'
health problems remains unclear, the resulting credibility crisis
from so many years of denial has only added to the misery of Gulf
war veterans whose health has faltered since the war.
<p>   Many of them are now left with the suspicion that military
commanders cared more about the perception of the war as a military
triumph than about getting to the bottom of the health problems
reported by those who were sent to fight. Many ailing Gulf war
veterans are unwilling at this point to accept any explanation from
the Pentagon.
<p>   The government's denials may also have had a direct effect on
the way in which veterans' health problems were addressed.
<p>   The Department of Veterans Affairs, which is ultimately
responsible for the medical care of ailing Gulf war veterans, has
said that it held off for years on any major research on the health
effects of low-level exposure to nerve gas and other chemical
weapons because of the defense department's assertions that there
was no evidence of exposures.
<p>   James Turner, an investigator for a special White House panel
that has studied the issue, described the Pentagon's public policy
for most of the last five years as "the three no's  --  there was no
use, there was no exposure, there was no presence" of chemical
weapons.
<p>   It was a mindset that apparently took hold at the highest levels
of the government. In his Senate confirmation hearings last year as
director of central intelligence, John Deutch, who had been the
Pentagon's chief investigator on Gulf war illnesses, said he
believed that "at present we have no compelling evidence of
chemical or biological use in the Gulf war  --  presence or use."
<p>   In May 1994, three Cabinet officials  --  the secretary of defense,
William Perry; the secretary of veterans affairs, Jesse Brown, and
the secretary of health and human services, Donna Shalala  --  signed
a joint letter to the Senate in which they said that "there is no
classified information that would indicate any exposures to or
detections of chemical or biological agents."
<p>   Deutch said in a recent interview that his testimony was based
on the best information available to him at the time. But he
acknowledged that in light of the evidence about the Kamisiyah
depot, it was "understandable that people are skeptical" about
the Pentagon's motives.
<p>   Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf, the commander of the U.S.-led alliance
in the Gulf war, said that while he had no information during the
war to suggest that U.S. troops had been exposed to chemical
weapons, he considered the Pentagon's handling of the issue in the
first years after the war "almost scandalous."
<p>   A review of thousands of government documents and hundreds of
interviews with government officials, scientists, doctors and
veterans' advocates undermines the Pentagon's claims since the war
that it had aggressively investigated the causes of the illnesses
reported by Gulf war veterans.
<p>   The Pentagon has insisted that its earlier errors in public
pronouncements were the result of incomplete, inadequate
information. Perry said in December that any perception that the
defense department had tried to withhold information on the issue
was "dead wrong."
<p>   
<p>   <b><a name=1>The Initial Judgment: No Chemical Weapons</a></b>
<p>   
<p>   The denials began early. Only hours after U.S. ground troops
poured across the sandy border from Saudi Arabia into Kuwait at the
start of the ground war, Schwarzkopf stepped from his military
command bunker in the Saudi Arabian capital of Riyadh on Feb. 24,
1991, to announce that he was "delighted" with its progress.
<p>   The fear that the Iraqis would retaliate by using deadly
chemical and biological weapons seemed to be unfounded. "We've had
some initial reports of chemical-biological weapons  --  chemical
weapons  --  but those reports to date as far as we're concerned have
been bogus," he said. "There have been no reported chemical
weapons used."
<p>   The evidence gathered to date shows that in the early hours of
the ground war, Schwarzkopf had no proof that chemical or
biological weapons had been released on the battlefield. Yet, over
the next several hours  --  and days and months and years  --  evidence
arrived at the Pentagon suggesting that the initial judgments were
wrong.
<p>   Even as Schwarzkopf was meeting with reporters in Riyadh, U.S.
marines stationed 300 miles north along the Kuwait-Saudi border had
begun to detect nerve gas and mustard agent using the most
sophisticated chemical-detection equipment in the U.S. military  -- 
the Fox vehicle, a mobile chemical laboratory jammed with
computerized detection equipment.
<p>   
<p>   
<p>   Gunnery Sgt. George Grass, a chemical-detection specialist, told
Congress in December that his vehicle detected chemical weapons
repeatedly in Kuwait in the first days of the ground war.
<p>   Yet all of his reports, like those of other chemical
specialists, were dismissed by his commanders. Grass said he had
talked to several other Fox vehicle operators since the war "and
every one of them has verbally acknowledged the positive
identification of chemical weapons in their area of operation."
<p>   (Pentagon officials say that while the Fox vehicles can produce
false alarms, especially when chemicals are detected in the air
instead of on the ground, they are now studying all of the
detections to determine if they were in fact valid.)
<p>   The Americans were not alone in detecting chemicals. During the
earlier air war against Iraq, Czech and French soldiers in the
U.S.-led alliance said they had detected chemical weapons in
northern Saudi Arabia.
<p>   On Feb. 3, 1991, a French military spokesman, Gen. Raymond
Germanos, said low levels of nerve gas and other chemical agents
had been reported "a little bit everywhere" after the relentless
bombing.
<p>   
<p>   <b><a name=2>The Kamisiyah Depot and What It Contained</a></b>
<p>   
<p>   The ground war was over in 100 hours. As U.S. soldiers overran
areas of the southern Iraqi desert, they were under orders to
destroy Iraqi military equipment and ammunition sites.
<p>   An early, important target was the Kamisiyah ammunition depot,
about 100 miles northwest of Kuwait. The depot was vast, with
concrete bunkers spread across almost 20 square miles of desert.
<p>   Although the Pentagon has said the bunkers were inspected for
chemical weapons, members of the 37th Engineer Battalion, the unit
responsible for the demolition, said there was no time, equipment
or expertise for a thorough search.
<p>   "How would we really know what's inside those bunkers?" asked
James Riggins, a retired major who was the executive officer of the
37th. "We're obviously not chemical-weapons specialists." As the
detonations began on March 4, the chemical alarms began to sound
and soldiers pulled on their rubberized chemical-warfare suits.
<p>   Under the cease-fire that ended the war, U.N. weapons inspectors
were allowed to visit Kamisiyah and other Iraqi weapons-storage
sites in search of evidence of chemical or biological weapons.
<p>   In the fall of 1991, only months after the war, they found
evidence that chemical weapons had been stored at Kamisiyah. The
Iraqis who had worked at the site acknowledged that shells filled
with nerve gas had been stored there.
<p>   The inspectors then filed a series of public reports to the U.N.
Security Council, outlining what they had found at Kamisiyah. The
Pentagon has acknowledged that it received the reports but has said
that they were overlooked in the flood of other intelligence data
reaching the United States in the months after the war.
<p>   
<p>   <b><a name=3>The Riegle Investigation and Some Missing Files</b></a>
<p>   
<p>  By late 1991, groups of Gulf war veterans had begun showing up
at hospitals run by the Department of Veterans Affairs, complaining
of health problems that seemed unusual for men and women who had
been in peak physical condition when they were sent to the Gulf a
year earlier.
<p>   Recent studies suggest that while Gulf war veterans did not die
and were not hospitalized at unusual rates in the first two years
after the war, they did report health problems, including digestive
problems, chronic fatigue and pains in the joints, at rates far
higher than troops who were not deployed to the Gulf.
<p>   Donald Riegle Jr., then a Democratic senator from Michigan,
heard from several ailing Michigan veterans and agreed to begin an
investigation of Gulf war illnesses in 1993 under the auspices of
the Senate Banking Committee, of which he was chairman.
<p>   The committee had some jurisdiction over the issue because there
were questions about U.S. export laws and whether U.S. companies
had shipped chemical or biological agents to Iraq.
<p>   The inquiry began with a request for all Pentagon documents
relating to the "detection of, or investigations into, the
detection of chemical agents, biological agents or radiological
agents" during the Gulf war.
<p>   The letter, dated March 16, 1994, and signed by Riegle, asked
specifically for copies of the combat logs that had been maintained
during the war in the headquarters compound of the U.S. Central
Command, the element of the defense department that oversaw the war
under the direction of Schwarzkopf.
<p>   The response came on April 15, 1994, in a letter from Stephen
Preston, the Pentagon's acting general counsel. Preston said that
the Central Command had told him that the logs did not exist.
<p>   "Central Command has conducted a search and has identified no
documents that meet this description," he wrote. "If you provide
a more specific description of the documents that this category is
intended to cover, I will ask Central Command to repeat the
search."
<p>   James Tuite III, the Banking Committee's lead investigator, said
that in subsequent telephone conversations with the Pentagon he
made it clear that the committee wanted a new search, and that it
wanted any logs that recorded chemical or biological detections.
"They understood exactly what we wanted," he said. But the logs
were never made available to the committee.
<p>   In a joint letter to Riegle dated May 4, 1994, Perry, Brown and
Shalala said they were "committed to a full and accurate
resolution of the issues surrounding the health problems
experienced by the men and women who served in the Persian Gulf
war."
<p>   But they insisted that "there is no classified information that
would indicate any exposures to or detections of chemical or
biological weapons agents"  --  an assertion that has since been
shown to be false.
<p>   There were in fact detailed chemical-detection logs at Central
Command, and parts of them were eventually made public last year,
initially to a veterans group, Gulf War Veterans of Georgia, under
a Freedom of Information Act request.
<p>   Most of the pages of the log were missing, however, including
the entries for the eight-day period in March 1991 in which the
Kamisiyah depot was blown up. The Pentagon said in December that a
search had failed to turn up the missing portions. It had no
explanation for their disappearance.
<p>   The logs that have been made public show that the Central
Command received dozens of reports of chemical detections
throughout the war, including reports from the Czech soldiers whose
detections were later found by the Pentagon to be valid. During the
war, however, the reports were routinely dismissed as false alarms.
<p>   Preston, who now works at the justice department, said in an
interview that he denied the existence of the logs in his letter to
the Senate because this "was the information that was made
available to me" from Central Command. "I don't have reason to
believe that anyone was deliberately withholding any documents or
information," he said.
<p>   
<p>   <b><a name=4>The Pentagon Position: Some Second Thoughts</a></b>
<p>   
<p>   By early 1994 at least a handful of senior Pentagon officials
had begun to change their minds.
<p>   In a letter to the surgeon general dated Jan. 18, 1994, Maj.
Gen. Ronald Blanck, director of the Walter Reed Army Medical
Center, wrote that after meetings with military leaders in the
Czech Republic, France and the Middle East, he was convinced that
"clearly, chemical warfare agents were detected and confirmed at
low levels" during the war.
<p>   "The two issues that arise from this are: What was the origin
of such agents, and did the agents contribute to the illness
described by a small number of United States veterans of the
Persian Gulf," he wrote. "The answer to the first question has
political and military significance but little medical relevance.
Of far greater importance to military medicine and to the veterans
is the answer to the second question."
<p>   But his information apparently did not reach others in the
Pentagon. On May 25, 1994, Riegle, frustrated by his inability to
get important documents from the Pentagon, called a hearing of the
Senate Banking Committee to take sworn testimony from officials of
the defense department.
<p>   The witnesses included Edwin Dorn, undersecretary of defense for
personnel, and Theodore Prociv, deputy assistant to Perry for
chemical and biological weapons. In their testimony the two
officials insisted that they knew of no evidence in the
government's files to suggest that Americans had been exposed to
chemical or biological weapons during the war.
<p>   "I can say that I do not believe that any chemical agents
entered the theater of operations and exposed any of our
soldiers," Prociv testified. Reminded by Riegle that he was under
oath "with your professional reputation on the line," Prociv said
again, "I do not understand how any of our veterans could have
been exposed."
<p>   Dorn said that chemical-detection equipment had been
"strategically located, and although many detectors alarmed, there
were no confirmed detections of any chemical or biological agents
at any time during the conflict."
<p>   He said in his prepared statement that all of the Iraqis'
chemical weapons and related equipment "were found stored at
locations a great distance from the Kuwait theater of operations."
<p>   But in fact the Pentagon has made public evidence showing that
there were stores of weapons in at least two sites in Iraq within
the Kuwait theater of operations, or KTO, which included Kuwait and
much of southern Iraq.
<p>   Two former chemical-weapons specialists who operated Fox
vehicles testified before Congress in December that they told their
commanders that chemical weapons had been found in Kuwait itself.
<p>   Dorn had to be corrected later in the same hearing when a third
witness, John Kriese, an analyst with the Defense Intelligence
Agency, acknowledged under heated questioning that Dorn's testimony
was wrong. "I thought we had that fixed to be stricken from the
draft testimony," he said. "It is not correct to say that all
munitions were found far from the KTO."
<p>   Dorn, Prociv and Kriese declined to be interviewed for this
article. Riegle, who has since retired from the Senate, said it was
obvious that the Pentagon had tried to hide the truth from
Congress. "This is such a remarkable abdication of responsibility
after the fact that it takes your breath away," he said.
<p>   
<p>   <b><a name=5>The Effects of Denial: Health Research Delayed</b></a>
<p>   
<p>   The Pentagon's repeated public assurances after the war that it
had no evidence of chemical exposures held up research that might
have provided Gulf war veterans with at least an explanation of
what was responsible for their health problems.
<p>   The Department of Veterans Affairs set up a special registry and
testing program in 1992 for veterans who believed that their health
had been damaged in the Gulf.
<p>   But the department held off on research projects on the health
effects of low doses of chemical weapons  --  research that began only
last year.
<p>   Dr. Susan Mather, a senior public health officer at the
Department of Veterans Affairs, said that if the department had
known earlier about the evidence of chemical exposures, "I think
it definitely would have made a difference in our research
program."
<p>   Veterans groups say that the Pentagon's denials also affected
the reception that ailing Gulf war veterans received when they
sought medical care at hospitals run by the Department of Veterans
Affairs.
<p>   "Because doctors were told that chemicals had not been used,
many veterans were sent straight to the psychiatric department,"
said Paul Sullivan, a spokesman for Gulf War Veterans of Georgia.
<p>   A recent report by the General Accounting Office noted that as
of July 1995 the Department of Veterans Affairs had denied 95
percent of the more than 4,100 claims it had processed from Gulf
war veterans who were seeking disability payments for undiagnosed
war-related ailments. Said Sullivan: "The doctors believed that
the soldiers must be faking it."

<center><h2> Veterans Dept. Blames Pentagon for Delay in Gulf War Health Studies</h2></center>
<hr size=1>
<h5>By PHILIP SHENON</h5>
<p>   
<p>     The Department of Veterans Affairs acknowledged
Wednesday that it had waited more than five years to begin major
research studies on the health effects of exposure to low levels of
chemical weapons because of the Pentagon's repeated  --  and
inaccurate  --  assurances that there was no evidence that U.S. troops
had been exposed to Iraqi chemical weapons during the Persian Gulf
war in 1991.
<p>   The acknowledgment came in a congressional hearing at which
lawmakers accused the Pentagon and the Department of Veterans
Affairs of having ignored the accounts of ailing gulf war veterans
who reported that chemical alarms had sounded throughout the war,
and that the chemical detections had been ignored by U.S.
commanders.
<p>   "Research into low-level exposures had been a low priority,"
said Dr. Susan H. Mather, a senior public health officer at the
department.
<p>   The Pentagon announced earlier this year that more than 20,000
U.S. troops might have been exposed to chemical weapons through the
destruction of an Iraqi ammunition bunker in March 1991, shortly
after the war.
<p>   Dr. Mather said that if the Veterans Affairs Department had
known of that and of other reliable reports of chemical detections,
"I think it definitely would have made a difference in our
research program."
<p>   She added, "We would have been very much more interested in
additional research on low-level exposure, which still needs to be
done."
<p>   The newly disclosed evidence of chemical detections during the
war was "very disturbing," she said, adding, "I find the reports
that the alarms had gone off very troubling."
<p>   The department's principal spokesman on gulf war issues, Dr.
Francis M. Murphy, testified that with the research delay,
"there's a gap in the scientific knowledge."
<p>   Members of the House panel, the Government Reform subcommittee
on Human Resources, angrily questioned why the department had
relied almost entirely on the Pentagon for its information, instead
of gathering the accounts of ailing veterans who sought treatment
in Veterans Affairs hospitals and who told their doctors about
repeated chemical detections during the war.
<p>   "You didn't listen to the veterans  --  nobody has listened to the
veterans," said Rep. Christopher Shays, R-Conn., the
subcommittee's chairman. "If you were listening to the veterans,
why are we only now beginning to think that exposure to chemicals
might be credible? DOD denied from Day 1 that there was any
credible exposure, and the VA has basically bought into that
denial."
<p>   Dr. Mather rejected the criticism, insisting that physicians at
Veterans Affairs hospitals were repeatedly reminded in recent years
to be aware of at least the possibility that chemical weapons were
linked to some of the health problems reported by gulf war
veterans.
<p>   "I have listened to what the veterans have said," she
testified. "I have always kept in the back of my mind that this
was always a possibility."
<p>   Researchers have been unable to agree on an explanation for the
health problems reported by thousands of gulf war veterans. While
government studies show that gulf war veterans did not die and were
not hospitalized at unusual rates in the first two years after the
war, other studies show that they report serious health problems,
including digestive problems and chronic fatigue, at a far higher
rate than troops who were not deployed to the gulf.
<p>   After the Pentagon's disclosure in June that it had discovered
that U.S. troops might have been exposed to nerve gas in the
destruction of the Iraqi ammunition depot, the Defense Department
and the Veterans Affairs Department announced millions of dollars
in new research programs to determine whether low levels of nerve
gas and other chemical agents might lead to long-term health
problems.
<p>   Little research has been done on the question in the past,
although a study conducted for the Army in the 1970s seems to
suggest that exposure to low levels of nerve gas  --  doses too low to
produce immediate symptoms  --  could lead to the sorts of health
problems reported by gulf war veterans. Other studies have
suggested no link.
<p>   Two physicians employed at VA hospitals testified to the House
panel Wednesday that they had long suspected that the chronic
ailments of gulf war veterans might be a result of exposure to
Iraqi chemical weapons.
<p>   "In my opinion, the multiple unexplained illnesses in gulf war
veterans I have evaluated represent war injuries," said Dr. Victor
Gordan, an internist at the Veterans Affairs hospital in
Manchester, N.H. "The VA's primary mission is to take care of
these war injuries."
<p>   Dr. Charles E. Jackson, an ambulatory care specialist at the
Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Tuskegee, Ala., said his
treatment of gulf war veterans had been hobbled by the government's
delay in providing details about chemical exposures during the war.
<p>   "It's so important in medicine to have a history of a
problem," Jackson said. "And we have not been provided with this
history over the last five years."
<p>   Gordan and Jackson are routinely praised by their patients, but
other gulf war veterans who have sought treatment in Veterans
Affairs hospitals have complained of being treated with contempt.
<p>   "There are good doctors and there are bad ones," said Julia Y.
Dyckman, a nurse who served with the Navy in the gulf and has since
complained of a variety of health problems, including abdominal
pain and respiratory ailments.
<p>   But within the Veterans Affairs Department, Ms. Dyckman told the
House panel, "the overall attitude is that this is not a real
illness."
<p>   She continued: "Do we all have to die before you believe us,
that we are suffering and that a lot of other Persian Gulf war vets
are suffering? What we are dealing with is a system that doesn't
believe us."

<center><h2>Gulf War Panel Reviews Researcher's Ouster</h2></center>


<h5>By PHILIP SHENON</h5>
<p>   
<p>    A congressional panel said Monday that it was
investigating why a White House committee studying the illnesses of
veterans of the Persian Gulf War abruptly dismissed its respected
chemical-weapons investigator last year.
<p>   The investigator, Jonathan Tucker, a weapons researcher who had
worked for the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency and the State
Department, has said that he believes he was dismissed because he
refused to limit his investigation to evidence gathered only from
government agencies.
<p>   Tucker said he had been ordered not to talk to Gulf War veterans
or to government whistle-blowers, even though he believed that they
had valuable information about the possible release of chemical or
biological weapons in the war.
<p>   Tucker, a chemical-weapons researcher at the Monterey Institute
of International Studies, said he had decided to speak out as a way
to protest the committee's final report, which is scheduled to be
sent to the White House by the end of the year.
<p>   The panel, the Presidential Advisory Committee on Gulf War
Veterans' Illnesses, is expected to criticize the Pentagon harshly
in the report.
<p>   But the report is also expected to conclude that the Pentagon
should retain control over the inquiry and that wartime stress is
far more likely than chemical weapons to have been the cause of the
ailments of most Gulf War veterans.
<p>   Tucker said he thought the conclusions of the panel were
"vastly premature" in light of how little research had been done
on the health effects of exposure to low levels of chemical and
biological weapons. "Having spoken with many sick vets," Tucker
said, "it seems that we need to do a lot more research."
<p>   Rep. Christopher Shays, R-Conn., who is the chairman of the
House panel, the Government Reform Subcommittee on Human Resources,
said in an interview that the White House advisory committee was
"not so independent as it pretends."
<p>   "I want to know why the committee thought that talking to
independent sources  --  sources outside the Pentagon  --  would be
bad," Shays said. He added that Tucker had proved to be "of
immense help" to the subcommittee and would be called to testify
next year.
<p>   Several members of the White House panel said in recent
interviews that they had never been told about the decision to
dismiss Tucker  --  his departure was officially described as a
resignation, although Tucker retains a copy of his termination
letter  --  and were surprised to learn of it only now.
<p>   The panel's executive director, Robyn Nashimi, refused to
discuss her reasons for dismissing Tucker, but she added, "I can
assure you without equivocation that there was no outside influence
relative to Jonathan's departure."
<p>   
<p>   
<p>   
<p>   The panel's chairwoman, Joyce Lashof, the former dean of the
School of Public Health at the University of California at
Berkeley, said she had been aware of the circumstances of Tucker's
departure.
<p>   "I'm not going to get into a discussion about the caliber of
anybody's work," Ms. Lashof said, noting that the panel had been
praised for its investigation of chemical exposures in the Gulf
War. "I think the committee's work speaks for itself."
<p>   Tucker's departure alarmed veterans' advocates. "He's a very
smart guy," said Matt Puglisi, a spokesman for the American
Legion. "He certainly had the expertise to handle this issue, and
not knowing why he was dismissed is unsettling."
<p>   Other specialists on chemical and biological warfare were
surprised that Tucker would be dismissed from such an
investigation. "Jonathan is a very thoughtful, methodical, careful
man," said Matthew Meselson, a professor of biology at Harvard
University. "The government needs more people like him."
<p>   Tucker said he was called into Dr. Nashimi's office last
December and given an hour to clean out his desk. "I asked, 'What
are the grounds?' " he recalled, "and she said, 'I'm not going to
tell you that.' "
<p>   Tucker said that when he returned to his office, the hard drive
from his computer had been removed, and he was watched closely by
another supervisor as he cleaned out his desk "to make sure that I
didn't take any of the files."
<p>   "I thought things like this only happened in the movies," he
said.<br>

<center><h2> U.S. May Never Know How Many Gulf Troops Were Exposed to Chemical Weapons</h2></center>


<h5>By PHILIP SHENON</h5>
<p>   
<p>     A panel of independent scientists has determined
that there is a "very real possibility" that the Pentagon will
never know how many American troops may have been exposed to
chemical weapons in the demolition of an Iraqi ammunition depot
shortly after the 1991 Persian Gulf war, the Defense Department has
announced.
<p>   The Pentagon has estimated the number at 20,000, but the panel's
finding suggests that any estimate would be suspect given the
uncertainty about the weather at the time of the demolition, the
number of shells that were destroyed and the purity of the nerve
agents and other chemical weapons that were stored in the shells.
<p>   The Defense Department said in a news release that it had asked
the scientists to continue their studies "despite the many
uncertainties and the very real possibility that no model or
combination of models will significantly add to the knowledge of
possible exposure of U.S. forces to chemical agents at Kamisiyah."
<p>   The scientists' finding raises new questions about the
government's earlier assurances that American troops were not
exposed to chemical or biological fallout from the relentless
bombing of Iraqi chemical- and biological-weapons factories during
the war.
<p>   The news release was made available at the Pentagon late on
Friday afternoon, too late for television networks to include it in
their evening broadcasts, and without any notification to news
organizations that routinely cover the department. It is the latest
in a series of incidents in which the Pentagon has released bad
news about this and other issues late on a Friday afternoon or in
the evening.
<p>   After years of denials that it had any evidence suggesting that
American troops had been exposed to Iraqi chemical weapons in the
1991 Persian Gulf war, the Pentagon announced earlier this year
that it had received evidence suggesting that thousands of troops
may have been exposed to chemical weapons in the destruction of the
vast Kamisiyah depot from March 4 to March 15, 1991.
<p>   The depot was blown up by a battalion of American combat
engineers. While there were no reports of acute symptoms among the
troops at the time of the demolition, many have since reported
chronic, debilitating health problems that they link to the
explosion.
<p>   Pentagon spokesmen have taken to referring to the Kamisiyah
incident as a "watershed" in their efforts to understand if the
health problems of Persian Gulf war veterans might be linked to the
release of chemical or biological weapons during or after the war.
<p>   A special White House panel is expected to release a report late
this month condemning the Defense Department for its investigation
of whether American soldiers were exposed to Iraqi chemical or
biological agents. In a draft report, the staff of the panel, the
Presidential Advisory Committee on Gulf War Veterans' Illnesses,
accused the Pentagon of a "superficial" investigation that had
undermined the department's credibility.
<p>   The White House panel is separate from the panel of scientists
who were gathered by the Pentagon to study the Kamisiyah
explosions. The Defense Department panel, which included experts in
meteorology, physics and chemistry, had been asked to review CIA
models of the plume created by the demolition of the Kamisiyah
depot.
<p>   The Pentagon said that in a report on Wednesday, the scientists
"reported continued concern about the inability to describe the
many variables of the agent-munition release mechanism."
<p>   "The panel agrees with the CIA that huge uncertainties remain
in the number of rockets present for destruction and the number of
those rockets destroyed," the Pentagon said. "Among the other
major variables for which there remains much uncertainty are total
quantity of agent released, mechanism of release and purity of
agents."
<p>   Despite the confusion, the Pentagon has attempted to estimate
the number of American troops who might have been exposed at
Kamisiyah. The estimate has grown repeatedly, from 300 to 400, to
1,000, to 5,000, to 15,000 and most recently to 20,000.
<p>   The Defense Department has said that it is attempting to contact
all 20,000 of the Persian Gulf war veterans.<br>

   <center><h2>RECOGNITION OF MULTIPLE CHEMICAL SENSITIVITY</h2></center> 

     Multiple Chemical Sensitivity is a chronic condition marked
by greatly increased sensitivity to multiple different chemicals
and other irritants.  In addition to odor intolerance, some
patients also report increased sensitivity to bright light,
sounds, and temperature extremes.   MCS may be caused by
short-term or chronic exposure to one or more chemicals or other
irritants.  It can start at any age and includes many often
disabling symptoms affecting multiple organ systems, especially
the neurological, immune, respiratory, and musculoskeletal
systems.  Symptoms may include headache, fatigue, aching joints
and muscles, difficulty concentrating, and irritated eyes, nose,
ears, throat and/or skin.  The frequency and/or severity of these
symptoms are made worse by subsequent exposures at even very low
doses to a wider range of chemicals and other irritants (hence
the name MCS) from a great variety of sources (air pollutants,
food additives, fuels, building materials, scented products,
etc.).  Consistent with basic principles of toxicology, MCS cases
usually can be improved, although not completely cured, through
the reduction and environmental control of such exposures.  
<p>
     Many different terms have been used in professional and lay
literature over the past decade to describe all or part of what
often is more accurately called Multiple Chemical Sensitivity. 
Those marked below by an asterisk are also distinctly recognized
medical conditions and listed as such in the International
Classification of Diseases.

     Listed alphabetically below are the United States and
Canadian government authorities, U.S. federal and state courts,
and independent national and international organizations that
have adopted policies and/or published documents recognizing
MCS-like disorders (under one name or another) as a legitimate
medical condition and/or disability.  The exact meaning of
"recognition" varies with the context, of course, as each listing
makes clear.  Recognition by a court of law, for example, usually
refers to a verdict or appeal in favor of an MCS plaintiff, while
recognition by U.S. government agencies varies tremendously--from
passing acknowledgment of the condition in isolated publications
to research funding from Congress and legal protection of
disability rights.  The dates in parentheses refer to the
specific references, which are not necessarily the earliest
available.  
<p>
Complete and/or excerpted documentation of each reference is
available from MCS Referral and Resources for a fee of $.25 per
page ($.15 per page for MCS patients).    
<p>
<p>
RECOGNITION OF MCS BY FEDERAL AUTHORITIES 
<p>
U.S. Agency for Toxic Substances & Disease Registry, Board of
Scientific Counselors<br> 
     ... in a unanimously adopted recommendation calling on the
ATSDR to "take a leadership role in the investigation of MCS
(1992, 24 pages).  The ATSDR itself has taken no position on MCS
but is coordinating interagency research on the issue.  With
Congressional funding (see U.S. Congress, below), ATSDR has
helped pay for a feasibility study on detecting MCS in an
toxic-exposed community (co-sponsored by ATSDR and the California
Department of Health, 1994) as well as three national medical
conferences on MCS (sponsored by the National Academy of Sciences
in 1991, the Association of Occupational and Environmental
Clinics in 1991, and ATSDR in 1994).
<p>
U.S. Army, Medical Evaluation Board<br>
     ... on US Army Form 3947 (from the U.S. Army Surgeon
General), the U.S. Army Medical Evaluation Board certified a
diagnosis of "Multiple Chemical Sensitivities Syndrome" for a
Persian Gulf veteran on 14 April 1993 (1 page).  MCS is defined
on this form as "manifested by headache, shortness of breath,
congestion, rhinorrhea, transient rash, and incoordination
associated with exposure to a variety of chemicals."  The Board's
report further recognizes that this patient's particular MCS
condition began approximately in April 1991 (while the patient
was serving in the Gulf and entitled to base pay), that the
condition did not exist prior to service, and that it has been
permanently aggravated by service.  At least five other active
duty Persian Gulf veterans have been diagnosed by the Army with
MCS, as reported by the Persian Gulf Veterans Coordinating Board
in "Summary of the Issues Impacting Upon the Health of Persian
Gulf Veterans," (3 March 1994, 4 page excerpt).  The Army Medical
Department also has requested funding for a research facility to
study MCS (reported in an Army information paper on "Post Persian
Gulf War Health Issues," 16 November 1993). 
<p>
U.S. Congress<br>
     ... in a VA/HUD Appropriations Bill for FY1983 signed by
President Bush in 1992 appropriating "$250,000 from Superfund
funds for chemical sensitivity workshops."  These funds were used
by the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (see
above) to co- sponsor scientific meetings on MCS with various
other organizations (1992, 2 page excerpt). 
<p>
U.S. Department of Education<br> 
     ... in the enforcement by its Office of Civil Rights of
Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 which requires
accommodation of persons with "MCS Syndrome" via modification of
their educational environment, as evidenced by several "agency
letters of finding" (including San Diego (Calif) Unified School
District, 1 National Disability Law Reporter, para. 61, p. 311,
24 May 1990; Montville (Conn.) Board of Education, 1 National
Disability Law Reporter, para. 123, p. 515, 6 July 1990; and
three letters (along with an individualized environment
management program) in the case of the Arminger children of
Baltimore County, MD, in 1991, 1992 and 1993 (19 pages).  These
accommodations also are required under the terms of Public Law
94- 142, now known as the Individuals with Disabilities Education
Act (CFR34 Part 300).  The Department of Education as a whole,
however, has no formal policy or position statement on the
accommodation of students with MCS.  
<p>
U.S. Department of Health & Human Services, National
Institute of Environmental Health Sciences<br>
     ... in "Issues and Challenges in Environmental Health", a
publication about the work of NIEHS, research priorities are
proposed for "hypersensitivity diseases resulting from allergic
reactions to environmental substances" (NIH 87-861, 1987, 45
pages).  It is not clear from the context if this statement was
meant to include or exclude MCS, since the condition was still
thought by some at the time to be an allergic-type reaction.  In
1992, then director Dr. Bernadine Healy responded in detail to an
inquiry from Congressman Pete Stark about the scope of NIEHS
research into MCS: "It is hoped that research conducted at NIEHS
will lead to methods to identify individuals who may be
predisposed to  chemical hypersensitivities. ... NIH research is
directed toward the understanding of the effect of chemical
sensitivities on multiple parts of the body, including the immune
system." (1992, 3 pages).  
<p>
U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, National Library of
Medicine<br>
     ... in the 1995 Medical Subject Headings (MESH) codes used
to catalog all medical references, which started using Multiple
Chemical Sensitivity (and its variations) as a subject heading
for all papers indexed after October 1994 (2 page excerpt). 
<p>
U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development<br>
     ... in a letter from HUD Assistant Secretary Timothy Coyle
to Senator Frank Lautenberg, confirming HUD recognition of "MCS
as a disability entitling those with chemical sensitivities to
reasonable accommodation under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation
Act of 1973" and also "under Title VIII of the Fair Housing
Amendments Act of 1988" (26 October 1990, 2 pages).  This was
followed by a formal guidance memorandum from HUD Deputy General
Counsel G.L. Weidenfeller to all regional counsel, detailing HUD
acceptance of MCS and "environmental illness" as "handicaps"
within the meaning of section 802(h) of the Fair Housing Act and
its implementing regulations (1992, 20 pages).  Also recognized
in a HUD Section 811 grant of $837,000 to develop an
EI/MCS-accessible housing complex known as "Ecology House" in San
Rafael, CA, consisting of eleven one-bedroom  apartments in a
two-story complex (funds pledged in 1991 and paid in 1993, 2
pages).   See also Federal Courts, Fair Housing Act, below.
<p>
U.S. Department of Justice<br> 
     ... in its enforcement of the Americans with Disabilities
Act of 1990, under the terms of which MCS may be considered as a
disability on a case-by-case basis, depending--as with most other
medical conditions--on whether the impairment substantially
limits one or more major life activities.  The Office of the
Attorney General specifically cites "environmental illness (also
known as multiple chemical sensitivity)" in its Final Rules on
"Non- Discrimination on the Basis of Disability in State and
Local Government Services" (28CFR35) and "Non-Discrimination on
the Basis of Disability by Public Accommodations and in
Commercial Facilities" (28CFR36), as published in the Federal
Register, Vol.56, No.144, pages 35699 and 35549 respectively (26
July 1991, 2 pages).  "Environmental illness," also is discussed
in the ADA Handbook, (EEOC-BK-19, 1991, p.III-21, 14 page
excerpt), jointly published by the Department and the U.S. Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission.   The ADA Handbook describes
environmental illness as "sensitivity to environmental elements"
and, although it "declines to state categorically that these
types of allergies or sensitivities are disabilities," it
specifically asserts that they may be: "Sometimes respiratory or
neurological functioning is so severely affected that an
individual will satisfy the requirements to be disabled under the
regulations.  Such an individual would be entitled to all the
protections afforded by the Act..." 
<p>
U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs<br> 
     ... in recognizing MCS as a medical diagnosis (although not
as a "disability") in the case of at least one Persian Gulf War
veteran (Gary Zuspann, September 1992, 3 pages).  It is
impossible to know exactly how many other Persian Gulf veterans
may have been diagnosed with MCS since the diagnostic data
recorded in the VA's Persian Gulf Registry are based on the
International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9CM), which does
not yet include a specific code for MCS.  Since VA diagnostic
paperwork requires an ICD code, and since the VA has not issued
any guidelines to its environmental medicine physicians regarding
which ICD code to use in place of MCS, all VA physicians (like
their civilian counterparts) are free to choose whatever ICD code
they think offers the most semantically and/or medically
appropriate substitute.  In VA practice, the choice of which code
number to apply to the physician's diagnosis is usually left to
the discretion of the medical records coding department within
each VA hospital.  Since these departments also have received no
guidance on MCS, it is no surprise that a variety of alternative
codes are known to be in use, including 989.9 (Toxic effect of
other substances; unspecified substance, chiefly non- medical as
to source) and E866.9 (Accidental Poisoning; unspecified solid or
liquid substances).  Even if the VA could account for all the ICD
codes in its Persian Gulf Registry that are being intentionally
used as alternatives for MCS, the total number of MCS cases in
the Registry probably still would be grossly underestimated. 
This is because most of the physicians designated by the VA to
provide these Registry exams have little or no  training in
environmental medicine and are suspected of misdiagnosing
thousands of MCS cases, using ICD codes that reflect only one
aspect or another of MCS symptomatology (such as intrinsic
asthma, sinusitis, dermatitis, depression, or restrictive airway
disease).
<p>
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Research
and Development<br> 
     ... describes "chemical sensitivity" as an "ill-defined
condition marked by progressively more debilitating severe
reactions to various consumer products such as perfumes, soaps,
tobacco smoke, plastics, etc." in The Total Exposure Assessment
Methodology (TEAM) Study, Summary and Analysis: Volume 1, by L.
Wallace, Project Officer, Environmental Monitoring Systems
Division, EPA Office of Research and Development (1987, 2 pages). 
The Office of Research and Development also is conducting
clinical research at its Health Effects Research Branch in Chapel
Hill (NC) to identify possible diagnostic markers of MCS.  And in
1991, at the request of the EPA's Indoor Air Division, the
National Research Council sponsored a workshop on Multiple
Chemical Hypersensitivity Syndrome.  The EPA as a whole, however,
has no formal position on MCS.  
<p>
U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission<br> 
     ... in the ADA Handbook (EEOC-BK-19, 1991, 14 page excerpt),
jointly published by the EEOC and the Department of Justice (see
above) and in a Determination Letter signed by Issie L. Jenkins,
the director of the Baltimore District Office, recognizing MCS as
a disability requiring workplace accommodation, consisting in
this case of a private office with an air filter (Mary Helinski
v. Bell Atlantic, Charge No 120 93 0152, 17 May 1994, 2 pages). 
<p>
National Council on Disability (an independent federal agency)<br>    
 ... in ADA Watch--Year One, its "Report to the President and
Congress on Progress in Implementing the Americans with
Disabilities Act," which recommends that Congress and the
Administration "should consider legislation to address the needs
of people with "emerging disabilities," such as those ... with
environmental illness who are severely adversely affected by
secondary smoke or other pollutants in public places
(Recommendation 13, April 1993, 7 pages)."
<p>
President's Committee on Employment of People With Disabilities<br>   
  ... in its report to the President, entitled Operation People
First: Toward a National Disability Policy, which recommends that
the federal government "develop, refine and better communicate
methods of 'reasonable accommodation,' in particular, the
accommodation needs of people with ... chronic fatigue syndrome
and multiple chemical sensitivity" (1994, 5 pages). 
<p>
Social Security Administration<br>
     ... in enforcement of the Social Security Disability Act
(see Recognition by Federal and State Courts, below), and in the
SSA's Program Operations Manual System (POMS), which includes a
section  on the "Medical Evaluation of Specific Issues --
Environmental Illness" stating that "evaluation should be made on
an individual case by case basis to determine if the impairment
prevents substantial gainful activity" (SSA publication
68-0424500, Part 04, Chapter 245, Section 24515.065, transmittal
#12, 1988, 2 page excerpt).

RECOGNITION OF MCS BY CANADIAN AUTHORITIES
<p>
Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (a federal government
corporation)<br> 
     ... in The Clean Air Guide: How to identify and correct
indoor air problems in your home (published by the Public Affairs
Centre, 1993, 7 pages) and in two reports commissioned in 1990:
"Housing for the environmentally hypersensitive: Survey and
examples of clean air housing in Canada" (by O. Drerup et al, 119
pages) and "Survey of the medical impact on environmentally
hypersensitive people of a change in habitat" (by S.R. Barron, 92
pages). 
<p>
Health and Welfare Canada (now Health Canada, a cabinet level
department)<br>
     ... in the published proceedings of two workshops that it
sponsored on MCS in 1990 (Environmental Sensitivities Workshop, a
supplement to Chronic Diseases in Canada, January 1991, published
by Health and Welfare Canada) and 1992 (Multiple Chemical
Sensitivities and Their Relevance to Psychiatric Disorders,
Workshop Proceedings, Ottawa, Ontario, 7 December 1992, Health
Canada).  
<p>
Nova Scotia Department of Health<br>
     ... in establishing and funding an Environmental Health
Clinic with the specific purpose of examining and treating
"environmental illness" referrals from physicians throughout the
province (1989). 
<p>
Ontario Ministry of Health<br> 
     ... in the "Report of the Ad Hoc Committee on Environmental
Hypersensitivity Disorders," appointed and commissioned by the
Ontario Minister of Health, environmental hypersensitivity is 
described as "a chronic multisystem disorder, usually involving
symptoms of the central nervous system and at least one other
system.  Affected persons are frequently intolerant to some foods
and they react adversely to some chemicals and some environmental
agents, singly or in combination, at levels generally tolerated
by the majority" (1985, 313 pages).   This report--and its 30
specific recommendations--were subsequently reviewed and for the
most part endorsed in the Ministry's "Report of the Advisory
Panel on Environmental Hypersensitivity," also known as the
Zimmerman Report (1986, 48 pages).  The Ministry  sponsored a
networking workshop for MCS clinicians and researchers in 1990
and every year since it has funded a variety of MCS medical
research projects.   In 1994, it provided $1.5 million for the
creation of a new environmental health clinic at the Womens'
College Hospital in Toronto which will focus on diagnosis and
treatment of environmental hypersensitivity/MCS disorders in
collaboration with medical research projects at the University of
Toronto (1 page press release).  
<p>
Ontario Ministry of Housing<br>
     ... in providing startup funding and low-rate, long-term
mortgage guarantees for a project sponsored by the Barrhaven
United Church to build seven prototypical "healthy buildings" (a
combination of rowhouses and stacked dwellings) for people
suffering from "environmental hypersensitivity" (completed 1993). 
<p>
<p>
RECOGNITION OF MCS BY U.S. STATE AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES
<p>
Arizona Department of Economic Security, Rehabilitation Services
Administration, and Statewide Independent Living Council<br>
     ... in RSA's Interim Fiscal Year 1995 State Plan for
Independent Living, specifying that "Services Related to Housing"
include "modifications to accommodate people with EI/MCS"
(Attachment 12, 1 October 1994, 8 pages) and in an administrative
review decision issued 22 June 1992 in the case of a vocational

Notification Registry for persons with pesticide sensitivity or
chemical hypersensitivity, as long as their medical condition is
certified by a physician specializing in occupational medicine,
allergy/immunology or toxicology (Florida Statute 482.2265(3)(c),
1989, 8 pages).  The legislation requires lawn-care companies to
alert registry members 24-hours in advance of applying chemicals
within a half-mile of their home.  Note that pesticide
sensitivity registries also have been adopted in Colorado,
Connecticut, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey,
Pennsylvania, and West Virginia, but these do not refer
specifically (by any name) to MCS- type illness. 
<p>
Maryland State Legislature<br> 
     ... in Senate Joint Resolution No.32 directing the Maryland
Department of the Environment (MDE) to carry out a study of

subsequently rescinded under pressure from industry opponents,
the following notice is still included in all published
announcements of public meetings as required by Chapter 66 of the
city 's Sunshine Ordinance:  "In order to assist the City's
efforts to accommodate persons with severe allergies,
environmental illnesses, MCS or related disabilities, attendees
at public meetings are reminded that other attendees may be
sensitive to various chemical based products.  Please help the
city accommodate these individuals" (Section 66.15(d), as amended

Self-Evaluation/Transition Plan" (required by the Americans with
Disabilities Act), which includes several provisions for
accommodating individuals  with "MCS, also known as environmental
illness, resulting from acute or chronic chemical exposure"
(1993, 4 pages).  The comprehensive plan requires "wherever
possible, purchase and use of  less toxic, hypoallergenic and
non-fragrance materials;" reasonable accommodations for
"employees and persons doing business with the city [who] may
have this illness;" and the posting of notices at entrances to
public buildings warning of "construction, remodeling or toxic
cleaning activities."  The city also includes a notice in all
City Council agendas and other public program notices, stating
that "Individuals with sever allergies, environmental illness,
multiple chemical sensitivity or related disabilities should
contact the city's ADA office at (408) 984-3222 to discuss

RECOGNITION OF MCS BY NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS 
<p>
American  Academy of Environmental Medicine (Denver CO)<br>
     ... the first medical academy in the United States to
recognize EI/MCS as a legitimate physical condition (founded
1965).  Views detailed in "An Overview of the Philosophy of the
American Academy of Environmental Medicine" by Dr.  Gary Oberg
(1990, 77 pages). 
<p>
Association of Occupational and Environmental Clinics (Washington
DC)<br>
     ... in its directory of American Occupational and
Environmental Clinics, which describes the most commonly seen
occupational and environmental diagnoses seen at each clinic
(1993, 53 pages).  MCS is listed as one of the top three
environmental diagnoses by clinics at Massachusetts General
Hospital, Johns Hopkins University, Emory University, Robert Wood
Johnson Medical School, and others.
<p>
Association of Trial Lawyers of America, Consumer & Victims
Coalition Committee<br>
     ... in a resolution recognizing  Ecological Illness (MCS) as
"an emerging and potentially major public health problem" (1994,
2 pages). 
<p>
Environmental Employees Collectively Organized 
(the EPA Headquarters Professionals Union, formerly the National
Federation of Federal Employees, Local 2050, Washington DC)     
... in a statement on MCS issued by the local president regarding
the outbreak of Sick Building Syndrome in the EPA's Washington
headquarters (1994). 
<p>
International Labor Organization (Geneva)<br>
     ... in its 1994 World Labor Report, recognizing Sick
Building Syndrome as the major problem specific to office workers
in industrialized countries (6 page press release; full report
available for $18 from ILO, 518-436-9686). 
<p>
The Labor Institute (New York City)<br>
     ... in Multiple Chemical Sensitivities at Work, "a training
workbook for working people" and accompanying video entitled
"MCS: An Occupational Hazard" (1993, 95-page book and 1/2 hour
video available for $3 and $12, respectively, from MCS Referral &
Resources).
<p>
National Academy of Sciences / National Research Council
(Washington DC)<br> 
     ... in a collection of research papers describing the
neurologic, respiratory, and immune 
impairment of MCS patients, in Multiple Chemical Sensitivities --
Addendum to Biologic Markers in Immunotoxicology (1992, book
available from NAS).   Note that the NAS has not made any
statements or estimates on the incidence of MCS in the U.S.
population.  The often quoted figure of 15% attributed to the
NRC's Board on Environmental Studies and Toxicology, Commission
on Life Sciences actually refers to an estimate of the percent of
the U.S. population with "an increased allergic sensitivity to
chemicals commonly found in household products..." (in Evaluating
Sensory and Hyperactivity Reactions From Exposures to Inhaled
Pollutants, 1987, 6 pages). 
<p>

     Recognition of Multiple Chemical Sensitivity was compiled
and edited by Albert Donnay, MCS Referral and Resources,

<HR><B>Wecome to our own version of &quot;REAL SPORTS&quot;!! They are,
in our opinion, the only sports worth covering. Football, a great American
sport will be covered in great detail including links, stats, picks etc.
Baseball and hockey will be covered in much the same way. Our opinions
are not bias to any particular team, however, they are backed with plenty
of resource. If you have any objections we ask that you please send us
e-mail with your own opinion and if it is worthwhile we will post it on
our page with your name and our critique or praise. Please enjoy <BLINK>REAL

  <FONT=+1> <BOLD>Welcome to the  best football write up with a close 

second place going to ESPNet. We do not show any baised opinions, we olny 
tell it like we see it.  
Please do not be offended if we bust on your favorite team.  That is the
best thing about football,  what comes around goes around.  Sure, there always 
seems to be that one team that can never get out of last place year after 
year, but for the most part with free-agencies there is more of an 
equilibrium.   </BOLD>

<P>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</P>


<P><CENTER><H2>Criminal Probe of Missing Documents<BR>Urged by American Legion</H2></CENTER>
<P>
<HR>

<P>WASHINGTON, D.C. (December 10, 1996) -- An official of the nation's largest Persian Gulf veterans organization called today for Congress to begin investigating whether federal laws were broken in the loss of military logs dealing with reports about chemical weapons during the Gulf War.</P>
	
	<P>"The American Legion is deeply concerned that classified materials concerning possible deployment, exposure and incidents regarding chemical agents have been lost.  This loss of classified information is a criminal offense under the National Security Act," said Matthew L. Puglisi, director of the Legion's Persian Gulf Task Force.</P>
	<P>In <A HREF="gulf9.htm">testimony</A> submitted today before a panel of the House Committee on Government Reform and Oversight, Puglisi urged lawmakers to authorize an independent probe, with subpoena powers, into the Pentagon's and the CIA's handling of information about the possible exposure of U.S. troops to chemical and biological materials during the war.</P>
	<P>The American Legion, with about 45,000 members from the Gulf War, is the largest group representing the United States' most recent combat veterans.</P>
	<P>Puglisi, himself a Gulf War veteran, renewed the Legion's long-standing call for the government to begin collecting and preserving tissue samples from veterans who served in the Middle East.  Legion officials contend that future medical breakthroughs may enable researchers to find out from tissue samples whether individuals were in fact exposed to 
chemical or biological warfare materials.  Doctors don't have the ability yet to make those determinations from tissue samples.</P>
	<P>The American Legion's point-man on Persian Gulf issues also called upon the military to review the adequacy of its equipment used to protect U.S. troops from chemical munitions and to detect chemical warfare agents on the battlefield.  And he urged lawmakers to consider expanding the two-year "presumptive" period for Persian Gulf veterans with disability claims.</P>
	<P>"The shine of the great victory in the Gulf has been tarnished by bureaucratic bumbling," Puglisi told lawmakers. "Evidence from before, during and after the Gulf War suggest that the U.S. military is woefully unprepared. . . . Many sick Gulf War veterans who seek care from the government still don't receive it."</P>

Subject: EFFECT OF <strong>PATRIOT</strong> INTERCEPT

Not Finally Evaluated Intelligence



TO FACILITATE ELECTRONIC ACCESS, THIS DOCUMENT HAS BEEN

REFORMATTED TO ELIMINATE INFORMATION THAT DOES NOT PERTAIN

TO GULF WAR ILLNESS ISSUES OR THAT IS CLASSIFIED. A COPY OF

THIS REDACTED DOCUMENT, IN ORIGINAL FORMAT, IS AVAILABLE ON

REQUEST.



EFFECT OF <strong>PATRIOT</strong> INTERCEPT OF IRAQI CW OR BW

MISSILE WARHEAD




THE US <strong>PATRIOT</strong> AIR DEFENSE MISSILE HAS APPARENTLY BEEN

ENGAGING IRAQI SCUD-TYPE MISSILES AT ALTITUDES          .

OF CONCERN IS THE <strong>PATRIOT</strong>'S ABILITY TO KILL CHEMICAL

WARHEADS. A <strong>PATRIOT</strong> INTERCEPT WOULD TYPICALLY RESULT EITHER

IN DETONATION OF THE INCOMING MISSILE WARHEAD OR IN NUMEROUS

HOLES IN THE WARHEAD AND MISSILE BODY. IN EITHER CASE, CW

OR BW AGENT CARRIED IN THE BALLISTIC MISSILE WOULD BE

RELEASED INTO THE ATMOSPHERE.



IF THE <strong>PATRIOT</strong> WERE TO INTERCEPT A CHEMICAL WARHEAD

UNDER THE ABOVE CONDITIONS, THERE COULD ONLY BE A

GROUND-LEVEL CW HAZARD IF THE WARHEAD WERE FILLED WITH A

PERSISTENT CHEMICAL AGENT. A NONPERSISTENT AGENT THAT WAS

DISSEMINATED          WOULD NOT REACH THE

GROUND.



WE ASSESS THAT THE IRAQIS WOULD MOST LIKELY FILL AN SRBM

WARHEAD WITH EITHER THE NONPERSISTENT NERVE AGENT SARIN OR

THE SEMIPERSISTENT NERVE AGENT GF. IT IS ALSO POSSIBLE--BUT

LESS LIKELY AT THE CURRENT TIME--THAT THE IRAQIS COULD FILL

A MISSILE WARHEAD WITH THE NERVE AGENT



EITHER VX OR GF COULD CAUSE CASUALTIES IF INTERCEPTED AT

AN ALTITUDE          IF A CHEMICAL WARHEAD WERE INTERCEPTED

AT          THESE AGENTS WOULD LIKELY HAVE VERY MINIMAL OR NO

EFFECT AT GROUND LEVEL.



IF ONE OF THE INTERCEPTED SRBMs HAD A BW FILL,

CASUALTIES COULD RESULT



THE 350MM

PROJECTILE FOR THE SUPERGUN IS INTENDED FOR USE WITH BW

AGENTS.

<font color="red">BASED ON CALCULATIONS WE HAVE DONE FOR

IRAQ'S SCUD-TYPE MISSILES, WE ESTIMATE THAT THIS QUANTITY OF

ANTHRAX SPORES COULD, UNDER IDEAL CIRCUMSTANCES AND

METEOROLOGICAL CONDITIONS, LETHALLV CONTAMINATE AN AREA OF

SEVERAL HUNDRED SQUARE KILOMETERS</font>

<font color="Marroon" size=+1>Hot Dog</font>
<p>This is a very good HTML editor.  It's great for the beginner or the expert and offers a wide variety of tools to speed up development.  The latest version supports the addition of frames, Java-Script/Java, and ActiveX to your web page.  It even lets you see what your web page will look like in a browser.  Very Nice!</p>

<br><br>
<font color="Marroon" size=+1>MS FrontPage</font>
<p>This is a WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) editor.  This editor is a also very feature rich and it simplifies the process of adding forms and other complex features to your web page.  It also has a built-in web server so you can be your own administrator.  Unless you have a dedicated connection to your ISP you probably won't want to run your own server though.  This editor is best for someone who has a fast, dedicated connection to the net or has a host that supports FrontPage.</p>

<br><br>
<font color="Marroon" size=+1>HomeSite</font>
<p>This editor is fast and powerful!  It doesn't fill up the screen with tons of different controls but rather puts them on a tabbed index.  It includes special wizards for inserting frames and tables, even ActiveX!  This may not be the best tool for beginners, but if your accustomed to using NotePad and are looking for a fast editor to speed up development, this is the tool for you.</p>

<p>I really don't know much about this program since I don't have a Mac to test it with.  It's supports to support HTML 2.0, HTML 3.2, and Netscape specific extensions.  You'll need to visit the PageSpinner web page to get more information.</p>

<p>This is a very simple HTML editor for UNIX.  It is basically a text editor with several shortcuts to performing frequent tasks.  It doesn't support frames and its not WYSIWYG but it is fast.  If you already know what your doing, this may help you write pages a bit faster.  Its available for several of platforms.</p>

<font color="Marroon" size=+1>The GIMP</font>
<p>This <strong><u>G</u></strong>eneral <strong><u>I</u></strong>mage <strong><u>M</u></strong>anipulation <strong><u>P</u></strong>rogram for UNIX and X Windows is the best photo retoucing, image manipulation, and image creation program for its price.  It is totally free.  There are over 75 plugins available for the GIMP and more are being developed all the time.  It does many of the things you would expect from an expensive program such as PhotoShop for free.</p>
<table><tr><td><a href="http://www.xcf.berkeley.edu/~gimp/gimp.html"><img src="images/diskicon.gif" border=0 align=left><h4>Download</h3></a></td><td><font color="blue">Supported Platforms: It has binaries for Linux ELF and a.out,  FreeBSD-2.1,  FreeBSD-2.2, HP-UX, Solaris 2.4, SunOS 4.1.x, and Irix.  If your OS isn't listed you may download the source and compile it yourself.</font></td></tr></table>

<font color="Marroon" size=+1>Image Composer</font>
<p>This is Microsoft's new graphics program.  It does some pretty neat stuff and it supports many plugins. Image Composer was designed with the web developer in mind so it supports the saving of interlaced and transparent gifs.  Microsoft has made it easy to create profesional looking graphics for the web.  It is currently in beta but available for download.  <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/imagecomposer/">Click here to get more info.</a></p>

<br><br>
<font color="Marroon" size=+1>GIF Animator</font>
<p>Microsoft decided to make a gif animator to go along with its new Image Composer.  This program integrates into Image Composer, letting you import images directly from Composer into the GIF Animator.  It lets you control all the aspects of the animation, such as loop, spin, and fade.  Again, Microsoft was thinking of the web when they designed this so it even automatically assigns each image an 8-bit color palette, although you may load your own palette if you wish.  <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/imagecomposer/evaluate/gatour/gainfo.htm">Click here to get more info.</a></p>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Like most people, I have a rather regular routine really. I get up, eat, 
go to work, go home (occational stops on the way home), eat, reply to e-mail 
and other messages, work on my web page, go to bed.
<BR><BR>
What? That was a bit uninformative you say? Alright, I'll go into a bit 
more detail, so don't ever say I never did anything for you.
<BR><BR>
My 'day' (as it were) starts when ever I happen to get up, after eating 
(and sometimes before) I begin doing the general 'stuff' that needs to 
be done. Then at some point, I walk out the door and fight with the car 
to get it to start, then it's off to work. Work starts at 5:00pm (3:00pm 
on Saturday), and lasts until... I'm a customer support tech for and ISP 
called <A HREF="http://www.livenet.net/">LiveNet</A>
<FONT COLOR="#F0E0EE">, I use a phone (sorry, I've watched to many 
episodes of Dragnet). At some point in the evening, or morning, I go 
home. Though not always; some times I camp out in the office. Why, 
because I want to, *grin* but really, things just work out that way some 
times. Once home I try to find what was left of dinner (because everyone 
else keeps 'normal' hours) and then it's off to reading/replying to 
mail. Both e-mail (from the four people that send me e-mail) and 
messages from local BBSes. Some times I work on my web page, 
and then it's off to bed, which is usually about the same time that 
everyone else is getting up.
<BR><BR>
Well, that about covers it really. You see, I have no life, though I do 
have a pseudo-life that I keep up to make everyone think that I have a 
life. At times I even forget that I don't have a life.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>Just</B> what is poetry anyway? Some consider it a collection of 
words, written out in a given measure or structure, so as to give the 
words fluidity. I am NOT one of those people. I see poetry as a snapshot 
of ones soul, as a window (if you will) through which the very being of a 
person can be felt if only the reader wishes to feel it. Fluidity is 
simply the gravy of an already wonderful feast.
<P>
To read the works that follow is to read 'me', who and what I am. Within 
you shale see that there is nothing more to me than there is to any one of 
us.
<P>
I have placed my work in the order in which it was writen, or as best to 
my knowledge for I didn't date my first works until long after writing 
them.

"Good bye" I say
-But the words can not be said with out grief

"Good luck" I call
-And my heart is heavy with sorrow

"Fair well" I state
-As a tear runs down my cheek

"Take care" I exclaim
-As my mind is filled with thoughts of when we were together

"Hope to see you soon" I yell in a wishful voice
-And it becomes hard to see you through the tears

"I love you" I whisper, as you move out of sight
-But because I was afraid, you never knew

I hang up the phone
 your voice still fresh in my mind
You tell me all is well
 that you just need a little more time
I understand your fears
 I feel them to, they cause great pain
But my fear is not so much of what we're getting into
 but more of what we leave behind
No more are the days of innocence
 of carefree love, sheltered from pain
I hang up the phone
 your voice still fresh in my mind
I realize all you've given me
 and what you've taken away
And for all I've gained because of it
 innocence isn't that much to pay

<P>
<PRE>
To be with her
 A chance to be lost within myself
To be free in my thoughts
 In my emotions
To, if only within my world,
 feel love
  A love not known
   Not shared
 But held just as dear
  If not more so
   than any love ever shared
    Ever felt between two
 For the is a pure love
  Not clouded by worry or concern
   For this love is not known to her

Do I dare
 Show it
  Let her know it
Shall I risk what is
 Just to expose my soul
  The very fiber of my being
And maybe drive her away altogether

On air
 I float
She is here
 In my thoughts
A tear
 Falls
Then another
One
 Of joy
One
 Of sorrow
How
 Do I say
I think
 I
 I
 I
 I really don't know how I feel

When I'm with her
 I feel safe
 Warm
 Happy
I feel that if I were to touch her
 I could feel what she feels
 Know what she knows

If only my soul could speak
 Without my words confusing it's meaning
If only I could display
 My emotions
  Without the chance for misinterpretation
If only you could know
 How being with you makes me feel
I need you to know
 Even thought your knowing may hurt me

Down, low, deep within myself
 I know I had to
 I know that it would destroy me if I didn't
 Let it out.
So why, now that I have opened up my heart
 And allowed it out
 Does it still rip and tare at me so?
Wasn't it supposed to make the pain easier
 To take
 To live with?
Why do I now feel so
 Down
 Low
 Deep within myself?
So deep that only one thing is likely to bring me out
 The one thing that put me there
 Put me where I am now.
Down, low, deep within myself-

Cool
Crisp
Softly it nips
The breeze fills me

Chirp
Croak
Splash
Nature welcomes me

Trees
Clouds
Moon
Stars
Watch down on me

Summer is gone
It's children
All going home for the long night

Winter
Shows itself
Shows it's power
Shows it's grace
It will soon arrive

Stillness
Calm
Night envelops me

A new world
Awakens
The old passes
Into slumber

The Earth is chilled
It awaits it's
Soft
White
Blanket

I am not
Alone

Autumn
She is with me

Talk to you
 of things I don't understand
Tell you my wishes

Sit with you
 with nothing to say
Knowing all the while
 that that's ok
Exchange final words
 when my day is through
My day incomplete
 without speaking with you
I'll always have time
 to listen to you
For I know that you
 need someone too
I thank you friend

I thank you friend

I thank you friend
 for these things that you do
I thank you friend

Again
 night brings her beauty to the city
Darkness frees me from my prison
I am awake
 yet not alive

Like waves over the sand
 the feeling overcomes me
Hunger fills me
 try as I might, I can not fight it

Like the wolf
 I stalk
It knows not that I am there
I wait
Then
 just as I feel I can wait no longer
 it is there
  the moment I've waited for

I strike
Ahhh
 the bitter sweet fluid flows between my lips
It's warmth tickles my throat
It's power fills me

I lay the lifeless form down
 no more shale it see the day
 but then neither shale I

I hear her voice calling out to me
 Soft and sweet, it echoes in my ear
It seems to come from everywhere
 So far, yet so near

Again I hear her voice calling out to me
 But somehow closer than before
I turn to look, but can not see
 Beyond this void
  this empty sea

Her voice I hear, closer still
 My thoughts go back to times before
  I see her face
  I feel her soul

Her voice, once more, rings clear and true
 It's origin is familiar
  A place it has come from many times before
A special place, one of hopes and dreams
 That place within us all, when we grow old
  where fairies live and unicorns still roam
  where witches fly on broom sticks
   far above the trees
  and dragons rest on cloud tops
   with almost unbelievable ease
 That place where lost loves still hold us close
  where friends who've moved on
   still call on the phone
 That place within us all where the world is fair
  where hope and peace are everywhere

That's where she calls from
 Where with her I can be
 Where I mean to her, what she does to me

The cold night air seems to become colder
 I quicken my pace, but the ever increasing chill follows me,
  Closer,
   Closer,
    Closer still

Why do I feel the eyes of a demon upon me?
 A creature of my dreams awake and alive?
  It's breath,
   Hard,
    Fast,
     I hear it pound in my head

The splash of a puddle comes from behind.
 It knows I sense it,
 It's wait is over

In a blur of stars and stone I strike the cobble stone street.
 I look to see it's face, it's eyes dark as the deepest depths of any soul.

All at once I freeze, trying to fight, trying to cry out,
 But I can not.

I feel the icy touch of it's fingers upon my skin, why can I feel it there?
 What was the sound I heard, why is the breeze blowing against my chest?

My thoughts drift away, a time, and a place far detached.
 Yet the sudden pain rips me out of that world..
 I can almost hear the flesh tear as it pushes in!..

The shock, horror.. I know now what is happening..

'Why?' 'Had my life led me to this?' 'What have I done so wrong?'
 'Is it one of the many that I had turned down,
  or one of the many more I hadn't?'

Again the sudden pain relieves me of my thoughts..
 Deeper it pushes, ripping me apart inside!

Harder, faster.. 'Will it ever end?'

'Why must it hit me too?'

'Please, end this.. End this now.. To die would be pleasure..'

It stops, though still inside, it stops..

I close my eyes for a moment only to open them to a flash of metal..

My chest feels warm, tingly..
 I feel pressure there..

The images fade, yet my eyes are still open..
 Hard to think..
 Warm feeling..
 I feel lighter..
 I could almost float away..
                       away..
                         way..
                           ay..
                             y..
                               ..
                                 .  
My pleasure..
 The rescue from my pain..

Empty.. Why do I feel empty?
 The question echos through my mind.
Alone.. Why do I feel alone?
 The words linger in the hollows of my soul.

I awake to each day knowing that it shale be no different than the last.
 I have a life, or so I say.. Things I do that fill my day.
I have dreams, they come while I'm awake.
 They fill me with sorrow, they fill me with pain.
These dreams let me see how life might be.
 The things I don't have, they show to me.

Dear Friend,

    It was nice to see you again.  It has been so long since we have
had a chance to talk.  I'm glad you're doing well, and that things are
working out the way you want them to.  It's good to know that you're
happy with him, you do deserve it.  I wish the two of you the best.

    I know I haven't been here for you as much as I should have been,
or as much as I've wanted to.  Just remember that if ever you need me,
I'll find a way to be there.

    Well, I really must be going.  Many things to do.  Call me some
time, maybe the three of us can get together for lunch.  Take care,
and I'll talk to you soon.


                                                Your friend


P.S.

    I love you.

The morning comes, much as it did the day before.
 Much as it will for millennia more.

The sun casts it's light upon the Earth;
 to awaken it's children and bring them warmth.
It's done this before and shale again;
 a continuous cycle that seems without end.

Birds sing and crickets chirp,
 their melodious words are often heard.

Dew drops fall on bright green leaves;
 a sight that has before been seen.

Yet somehow this morning is something more.
 Something special to adore.

The golden beams the sun rains down;
 wash away the darkness that enveloped the world,
  in it's deep black shroud.
The children of day step forth and show;
 a vigor for life they've not before known.

Chirps and tweets, once a simple song,
 now a concerto lasting hours long.

Plants and trees sparkle and shine;
 wearing diamonds and pearls that fell from the sky.

For this day is special above all the rest,
 on this day the world must look it's best.

To pay honor and tribute;
 this time of the year.

It's own special way to say;
 Happy Birthday my dear.

<PRE>
By the field,
 upon which I lay
  and dream the dreams, of better days.
Near the trees,
 which stand so tall
  they are my strength, my impenetrable wall.
All about,
 are the wild things
  those through which my soul runs free.
Under deep blue skies,
 were birds take wing
  I learn to fly, I learn to sing.

That's where it is,
 that still, clear, lake
  safe and sound, no move it makes.
Not a ripple,
 not from even a breeze
  for nothing gets past, my fortress of trees.
Protected from others,
 in here I stay
  for my woodland friends keep strangers away.

A pebble,
 a simple stone
  yet a wondrous treasure to behold.
So much like I,
 t'is plain to see
  you too wish to fly, long to be free.
I cast you out,
 I give you flight
  a beauty to espy, a marvelous sight.
Into the lake,
 you gently sink
  with an easeful plop, the surface you break.

Settled deep,
 within my lake
  you formed a bond, with the waves you made.
Their force so much,
 they shook my trees
  letting in the mid day breeze.
So loud and full,
 the sound rang free
  bringing forth much curiosity.

From the moment since,
 that glorious day
  my world branches out in bold new ways.
I stand on my own,
 and though I may fall
  I no longer need my prison, my containing wall.
Venturing forward,
 on it's own
  my spirit seeks new paths to roam.
Held aloft,
 on air I float
  and fill the skies with the purest of notes.

A lonely pebble,
 longing to be free
  so very much alike are we.
To me you've opened,
 a world not yet known
  but given me the desire to make it my home.
And deep within,
 my once still lake
  my warmth and love are yours to take.

<p>Sure, there are a lot of web browsers out there, but there are really only two major contenders - <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/ie">Microsoft's Internet Explorer</a> and <a href="http://home.netscape.com">Netscape's Navigator</a>.  Navigator has been around longer, but that doesn't mean its the greatest.  Microsoft's latest version of its browser, Internet Explorer 3.0, supports most, if not all of the features Navigator supports.  Frames, Java, JavaScript, VBScript, ActiveX, StyleSheets, are all supported by Internet Explorer.  Netscape only offers Frames, Java and JavaScript.  Audio features have been built into both browsers.  To really decide which browser is best for your web page, you must first consider your audience.</p>

<p>If you're designing a web page for a company that wants the most exposure they can possibly get from the web, then you will want to support both browsers.  You may even want to include text versions of your web pages so that people with old browsers can still view your site.  You also won't want to support many plug-ins, since any one who doesn't have that plug-in would have to download it before viewing your site.  While this practice is great for business sites, it may not be the best for personal sites.<p>

<p>If you're designing a personal web page, you will probably want to exploit every new web feature possible.  Unless you're providing a service, you're really going to need to give viewers a reason to visit your site.  If they can see some cool new stuff that dazzles them, then they'll probably visit.  In this situation, your in the position to choose either browser based on its features alone.  Since Internet Explorer does support the latest and coolest stuff, choose it.</p>

<font color="blue"><b>Other Considerations:</b></font>
<ul>
<li>Netscape has been found to be the most stable browser and it is available for 14 platforms.  Microsoft's Internet Explorer is only available for Windows 95, Windows NT (3.51 and 4.0), Windows 3.1 and the Macintosh. A UNIX version is on the way though!
<li>Microsoft Internet Explorer v3.0 is now being installed on many new machines.  Chances are that your viewers will already have Internet Explorer so they wouldn't need to download Netscape.

<p align="center"><font size="7">Guitars &amp; Music</font></p>

<p><font size="4">In addition to other interests, I still have a
deep and abiding love of music - particularly hard rock and
bluegrass (quite the combo, huh?). I play guitar and try to sing.
A couple of bands I've recorded with are listed below. If you're
in the Tidewater area and are looking for a decent utility
guitarist/vocalist, </font><a
href="mailto:oscarhamoa@livenet.net"><font size="4">drop me a
line</font></a><font size="4">. I play anything that isn't too
hard (but if it's anything new you'll probably have to show me).</font></p>

<p><font size="4">In addition to playing, I still collect records
(yes, real genuine <em><u>vinyl</u></em><em>!!</em>). Why
records? Well, primarily because a lot of the music I really like
has never been released on CD. Also, I'm just a bit old
fashioned. God meant for music to be analog (if not, why aren't
there digital crickets?).</font></p>

<p><font size="4">So, where does one find records? At flea
markets, garage sales, or </font><a
href="http://pages.prodigy.com/skinnies/home.htm"><font size="4">Skinnies
Records</font></a><font size="4">. Skinnies is located on 21st
street, Norfolk, Virginia, and boy do they have vinyl. The web
site deals mostly with their CD trade (90% of which I've never
heard of), but the entire back room of the store is records. The
prices are reasonable and the selection is fantastic. If you're
feeling nostalgic for the music of your youth (or your parents'
youth) e-mail them and they'll probably have what you want. Or
better yet, just stop by and browse through the stacks. It's
amazing how many groups you've forgotten about.</font></p>

You've decided to find out what it is that causes me to do the things 
that I do, and so you've come here to do so. Well, normally I'd say that 
that was a good choice, except for the fact that I really don't know what 
it is that makes me 'tick'. I've actually thought about this for quite 
some time and am still at a loss. I suppose that the best I can offer you 
is that for the most part the things that 'drive' me are the same things 
that drive us all: Love, Freedom, Friendship, Dreams, (and of course) 
Envy, Lust, and Anger (for they are a part of what makes 'us' who we are).
<P>
I'm sorry that I can't offer you anything more than that, but I just 
don't know what to tell you.

<p align="left"><font size="4">Welcome to my Train Page, where I
get to talk about stuff I REALLY like. You might say that I have
a genetic predisposition toward trains; one of my paternal
great-grandmothers was struck and killed by a Big Four
(Cleveland, Cincinnati, Chicago &amp; St. Louis) train, and one
maternal great-grandfather was run over on the Illinois Central.
Growing up in the midwest, my railroading interests naturally
gravitate toward the flatland railroads. My humble little
hometown of Carthage was host to both the Wabash and the
Burlington Route. In fact, the CB&amp;Q</font><a
href="station.htm"><font size="4"> Station</font></a><font
size="4"> still stands (temporarily) on Main Street. Whenever
we'd go to visit my grandparents, invariably there would be a
wait at the tracks entering the Rock Island yard at Silvis,
Illinois. Many's the time I counted the 100+ cars of a long
Rocket Freight easing into or out of the yard. So, those are my
primary lines of interest.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="4">I dabble primarily in HO scale,
but also have ventured into the large (and expensive!) world of G
scale. My interest in G tapered off when I realized that I could
purchase an entire HO train for the cost of a single G
locomotive. I don't have a layout now, but do have a track plan,
and intend to begin construction when time and money permit. In
the meantime, I get my railie fix helping out with the</font><a
href="tidewate.htm"><font size="4"> Tidewater Division</font></a><font
size="4">, Mid Eastern Region of the</font><a
href="http://www.mcs.net:80/~weyand/nmra/"><font size="4">
National Model Railroad Association</font></a><font size="4">. I
also find time to keep adding to my collection of cars, locos,
buildings, etc., so that I will be ready when the tracks are
laid. Another way that I stay involved in the hobby is designing
track plans. </font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="7">Tidewater Division</font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="5"><em>November 1996</em></font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="4">This page is dedicated to the
Tidewater Division, Mideastern Region (MER) of the National Model
Railroad Association (NMRA). There is already an </font><a
href="http://www.electrictrains.com/td/td.htm"><font size="4">official
Division page</font></a><font size="4">, but there's really not
much there, so I started this one to broaden the representation
of the Division and the people in it. After all, the people are
the most important part of the hobby.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="4">Dues are $5 per year, a real
bargain. That $5 gets you into the Division only; MER and NMRA
dues are separate (and higher). You do <u>NOT</u> have to join
the MER or NMRA to be in the Tidewater Division. We hold meetings
(meets) about eight times a year, including the annual show,
usually held at the Virginia Beach Pavilion. A newsletter, the
Callboard, is published also about eight times a year.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="4">We do not have a permanent home or
club layout. What we do have are modular layouts in O, HO and N
scales. For those not familiar with modular type layouts, they
consist of a set of &quot;modules&quot;, of fixed dimensions,
that can be interconnected in any order to create larger or
smaller layouts. The Division owns the corner and yard modules
(have to have corners, or else it would just be a long straight
layout), but the other modules are property of individual members
and are decorated according to individual taste. Some of them are
quite striking, and I will feature pictures of them and profiles
of the artists (they really are works of art) in future
installments of this page. Be on the lookout for Pollyville.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="4">The Division also supports a G
scale group. We don't have modules; instead, we set up sectional
track to fit the space available, generally with a different
layout every time. If you like trains but don't have the money or
space for an elaborate layout, you should consider joining and
getting active in one of our groups. That way, you can play with
your trains (and everyone else's) on a much larger layout. That's
what I do.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="4">The next Division meeting will be
held jointly with the Chesapeake Bay Model Railroaders in
Grafton, VA on November 23rd. If you would like to attend and
need directions, e-mail me.</font></p>

<hr>

<p align="left"><font color="#FF0000" size="6"><em><strong><u>Layout
Feature</u></strong></em></font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="4">This page's
premier feature is the Dog Gone Lines, a G-scale backyard layout
at the home of David and Sherry Caldwell of Virginia Beach. The
layout, which covers a good-sized section of the back yard, is
named after the owners' deceased pets, whose final resting places
lie along the line. The landscaping includes a mountain, complete
with tunnel, and a running waterfall that flows into a lilly
pond.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="4">David, Sherry, and
Buddy Starks did most of the work, to a plan that Buddy devised.
The track is LGB and Aristocraft brass code 332 fastened to
pressure-treated lumber roadbed and ballasted with small gravel.
After laying the track, they soldered jumper wires across all the
rail joints. So far, this has produced flawless operation.
Operation is remote control using the Aristocraft Train Engineer
radio control. All of the switches are remotely controlled, and
electrical block control is managed through a removable control
panel (also designed by Buddy). The wiring is all underground.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="4">David and Sherry
have put a lot of work into the scenery. They have added plenty
of buildings, vehicles, people, and scenic details to really
bring the railroad to life. There is even a frog in the pond that
&quot;ribbits&quot; whenever a train rolls by. Miniature plants,
proportioned to the trains, help to create the illusion that the
layout is real and we are but giant observers.</font></p>

hold frequent open houses. David is also the G scale coordinator;
so if you're a Division member and interested in G scale, collar

Lets see... he spends most of his day trying to convence me that he is 
REALLY an adult in a little body, and some times he's rather good at it. 
He loves talking on the phone, even if it isn't pluged in. Actually I 
think he prefers it not to be pluged in.<BR><BR>
He's not much of a TV watcher, yet he seems to be convenced that one MUST 
be on at all times. Even if he isn't in the room.<BR><BR>
When it comes to 'going', he's there, no matter where there might end up 
being. If you're going somewhere you'd better have a REAL GOOD reason for 
not taking him with you.<BR><BR>
He LOVES M&Ms, can't get enough of them, not that I'm going to find out 
just how many he could eat at one time, but I imagine it would be a 
lot.

<p><font color="#FF0000" size="5">My mother found this recipe on
a flour sack late 50s or early 60s. It is the only recipe I ever
remember our family using. And yes, it has been shipped almost
world wide. Thanks Mom!</font></p>

<p><font color="#FF0000" size="5">1 Cup sugar</font></p>

<p><font color="#FF0000" size="5">Cream butter and sugar
together. Add egg and vanilla. Mix in salt and baking powder. Add
2 cups of flour, 2 Tbs milk, and then remaining flour. Chill for
at least 2 hours; I prefer overnite. Roll to desired thickness
(about 1/4 inch) and cut with cookie cutters. Using a third of
the dough at a time works best; referigerate the rest and any
scraps from cutting. I have found that metal or the open plastic
ones work best. Bake at 400 until lightly browned. Cool and ice
as desired. Makes 3-4 dozen cookies.</font></p>

<center><h1>The Conference FAQ and Answers</h1></center>

Here is a brief explanation of some of the questions you may have 
about the Developer's Conference<hr>
<ul>
<li><a href="#links">Can I use html tags anywhere in my posts?</a>
<li><a href="#colons">Why are there colons in the message section when I 
try post a followup?</a>
<li><a href="#reload">Why didn't my post show up?</a>
<li><a href="#getit">Where can I get the scripts for this program?</a>
</ul><hr><p>
<a name="links">Can I put html tags anywhere in my posts?</a><p>
No.  You can not use HTML tags in any field except body of the message.  
The maintainer of the script has the option of allowing or 
disallowing any HTML in the Message part of your posting.  If 
they disallow it, the script will just throw out everything in 
&lt;&gt;'s.  If they allow it, your html markup will appear in 
the posting.  It can't hurt to try.<p><hr><p> 

<a name="colons">Why are there colons in the message when I try to post a 
followup?</a><p>
Colons appear in the message dialog box when you try to followup up on a 
message to indicate that those lines are quoting the previous document. 
The owner of the WWWBoard can decide whether they wish to enable or 
disable the quoting of previous messages.<p><hr><p>


<a name="reload">Why didn't my post show up?</a><p>
Your post most likely did not show up, because your browser did not reload the 
page, it simply pulled it out of cache.  Please reload the page and it 
should then appear.<p><hr><p>
<a name="getit">Where can I get the scripts for this program?</a><p>
The scripts are written in Perl and created by Matt Wright.  They are 
free to anyone who wishes to use them and you can get them as well as other 
scripts at: <a href="http://worldwidemart.com/scripts/">http://worldwidemart.com/scripts/</a>.  
Enjoy!<p><hr>

My brother was with the 649th MP Co (Alameda, CA), with 10 other MP <br>companies, the 143rd and 402nd Battalion of the 800th MP Brigade, set up <br>the northernmost EPW Camp north of Hafar al Batin. <p>I am looking for anyone in the Hafar al Batin area during late March early <br>April 1991.

Brother <br>- MP- was taken to the hospital in early April because of inability to <br>walk, severe neck spasm so he was unable to move his head, sore throat, <br>breathing difficulties.  He was unconcious (maybe due to medication) for 3 <br>days and in hospital for two weeks with no firm diagnosis.  After his <br>release from the hospital someone from the MP unit took him out to see the <br>dead sheep with dead flies and no wounds in the area.<p>I realize that the confirmed Czech alarms in this region were in January.  <br>But does anyone else recall alarms late in the deployment?<p>Thanks for any help you can give me.

In the early morning hours at about 3:30 AM on 19 Jan, 1991, the city of Al Jubayl was hit by a Scud missle. As you might have seen on other sites, this event has been well documented. It is even found in the Riegle reports. It is also said that everyone that knows of this incident has been told that the blast we heard was a Sonic Boom. When my Commanding Officer made this statement, I just happened to be recording his announcement over our intercom system. If anyone needs proof that this is what we were told, I will have this recording on this site as a .wav file soon. I recorded the entire event from the time we went to the bunkers, then told nothing was wrong, through when we went to MOPP 4 after the fact, we had already been exposed by then. The Marines that patroled our perimeter saw the Patriots leaving the area to intercept the incoming Scud. 2 Patriots were replaced that day. The Sonic Boom theory was part of the cover-up. Contact me so we can get this out in the open even more than it is already. <br>Thank you. Ted<br>

Only two close scud shots for Al Jubayl.  The one in<br>that time frame hit 10 miles to the west.  One of<br>the CI guys and an NBC officer went and checked<br>the impact site and it was clean.

: : In the early morning hours at about 3:30 AM on 19 Jan, 1991, the city of Al Jubayl was hit by a Scud missle. As you might have seen on other sites, this event has been well documented. It is even found in the Riegle reports. It is also said that everyone that knows of this incident has been told that the blast we heard was a Sonic Boom. When my Commanding Officer made this statement, I just happened to be recording his announcement over our intercom system. If anyone needs proof that this is what we were told, I will have this recording on this site as a .wav file soon. I recorded the entire event from the time we went to the bunkers, then told nothing was wrong, through when we went to MOPP 4 after the fact, we had already been exposed by then. The Marines that patroled our perimeter saw the Patriots leaving the area to intercept the incoming Scud. 2 Patriots were replaced that day. The Sonic Boom theory was part of the cover-up. Contact me so we can get this out in the open even more than it is already.

Posted by <a href="mailto:tdwalls@erols.com">The Walls Family</a> on December 15, 1996 at 01:57:59:<p>
We would like to share an aspect which has not been mentioned in the Gulf War Syndrome.GWS symptoms affecting civilian expatriates in Saudi Arabia.  We lived and worked in Saudi Arabia from December 1990 through August of this year.  We are forever grateful to all those who served in the Gulf War! Civilians have also experienced many of the symptoms of GWS.   Three years ago our children had blistering hive-like skin rashes which lasted for 3 months. My husband and several of our Dhahran civilian/expatriate friends also had this same rash. The Oil Company doctors were unable to give us a medical reason for these rashes. Several of my friends on our camp were diagnosed with "fibromyalgia" a few years after the Gulf War. Most had stayed in Saudi throughout the Gulf War and during the times of the SCUD Missiles (reported as landing in "uninhabited desert areas", but in reality was just outside our camp). They were experiencing the severe joint and muscle pain, fatigue, forgetfulness and other symptoms we later learned you Gulf War Vets were also experiencing. We had several women under the age of 40 with rare breast cancers diagnosed in years following the Gulf War. Also RT(Ras Tanura Camp) has had civilians diagnosed with rare brain cancers. Is it something "blowing in the wind" over there or is it from the Black Oil Clouds present overhead for 8months following the Gulf War? We'll probably never know... The Medical Community over there kept telling us all our "symptoms were not related to the Gulf War, as there were no chemicals or biological agents used during the war". The News Reports keep saying there are no reports of Civilians affected by GSW. We are here to say we think so.  Many of the civilians have questions, concerns and worries about what we were exposed to during and after the war.  The nature of living over in Saudi is based on "everything's ok, business as usual" as a way of dealing with hard questions.  Denial is a big part of surviving in this most interesting country.  Also, many fear losing those high paying jobs in Saudi, if they were to push for more answers (we had phone, mail and E-mail censors over there).  I also think we don't support each other, when we wonder if we were affected by something during the war.  The doctors make us feel we are being "paranoid" and too worried as "there have been no reports of chemical/biological agents during the war" as they say.  But, the facts are the facts and I have heard so much more about GWS since we repatriated back to the States after the Dhahran Bombing this summer.  Can't stay silent anymore.  I have sent E-mail to a CBN Reporter, Lane, who covers GWS stories, the TODAY Show (just interviewed Ret. Gen. Schwarzkopf, who said the civilian population was not affected), and Sen. John Rockefeller.  I have not received any replies, other than form letters not related to GWS.  Hope this information we shared will be of some help to all of you.  Wish you all the very best as we KNOW you gave your very best!!<br>Sincerely Yours,<br>The Walls Family<br>

Wish you all the very best as we KNOW you gave your very best!!<br>: Sincerely Yours,<br>: The Walls Family<p>I had wondered if the local population in the theater of operations were experiencing the effects of GWS. Also I wondered if they had problems before the war. This may explain whether these problems are of a natural cause just because of the area or if these symptoms came about after the war, well that would mean just being in that area wasn't cause enough. I do believe that when this all comes about the government will indeed need to compensate civilians who were in the area as well as the military.

But, the facts are the facts and I have heard so much more about GWS since we repatriated back to the States after the Dhahran Bombing this summer.  Can't stay silent anymore.  I have sent E-mail to a CBN Reporter, Lane, who covers GWS stories, the TODAY Show (just interviewed Ret. Gen. Schwarzkopf, who said the civilian population was not affected), and Sen. John Rockefeller.  I have not received any replies, other than form letters not related to GWS.  Hope this information we shared will be of some help to all of you.  Wish you all the very best as we KNOW you gave your very best!!

: I had wondered if the local population in the theater of operations were experiencing the effects of GWS. Also I wondered if they had problems before the war. This may explain whether these problems are of a natural cause just because of the area or if these symptoms came about after the war, well that would mean just being in that area wasn't cause enough. I do believe that when this all comes about the government will indeed need to compensate civilians who were in the area as well as the military.

I received a new questionnaire today in the mail. It asks alot of questions about illnesses and symptoms. Also asks about reproductive problems and disorders that may have been passed onto the spouses. Did anyone else get this information? If you would like a copy of this questionnaire if you didn't receive it, write me and I'll get it to you.

You might already know that you can receive 100% disability for unemployability, but do you think that means that you can't work at all ??<p>No, it means that you can't hold down a full time job. If you can work a little or even part-time, you may still be able to get 100% even if you can't get disability for other diagnosises.

Remember when you are trying for a claim, the VA will give compensation for and Undiagnosed Illness but the military will not. If you are retiring from the service through TDRL/PEB, if your illnesses don't have a diagnosis, you need to seek compensation from the VA. Thank you.

Ok, so maybe I came a long a bit later, or maybe not... who's to know?
<BR><BR>
Anyway... 
<BR><BR>
It all started about 22 years ago in a city called Norfolk, Norfolk 
Virginia that is. Around 10:00 or 11:00pm July 10th, 1974 a little boy 
was born, me. (Bet you were expecting someone special weren't ya? Sorry 
to disapoint you like that, but it's my story and I'll tell it any way I 
please, so there!) Anyway, the lucky (or unlucky, depending on how you look 
at it) parents of this little boy were Wanda Lou Franklin and Ishmael Ray 
Franklin. Now, you would think that a young couple, such as they were, 
would be happy to have a little baby, (At least Wanda would be happy to 
have me out of her, seeing that I was 10lbs 7 oz at birth.) but the truth of 
that was soon to be realized. For not to long before that day they had 
decided on what to name this otherwise normal little boy. So on that 10th 
day of July in the year 1974AD began the life, and the little world of a 
boy named Jody Ray Franklin.

<b>Message:</b><br> Two Items:

1.  Since switching to Livenet.net from Livnet.com, every time
I log on, the modem just hangs up after about two minutes.  I
then log back on again and it works fine.  This is not a random
thing, it happens EVERY time.  What is causing this and how do
I make it stop?

2.  My transfer speed is below par.  My average FTP transfer is
1 K/sec and the highest I've EVER had is 1.4 K/sec.  Speeds of
0.5 K/sec are not uncommon.  I'm running Netscape navigator 2.01
(registered) and Trumpet Winsock over Windows for Workgroups 
3.11 with a Garnett 28.8 fax/modem.  The baud is set to 57,600
(changing to 115,200 has no effect) in both the port window in
Control Panel and Winsock setup window.  What am I missing?

Thanks,
Jon.

<IMG SRC="/gifs/bstar.gif"><B>Federal Volunteers Needed to Work on Blue Pages</B>
<BR>
The General Services Administration needs federal workers as volunteers to work with about 30 companies that publish 6,200 phone directories over the nation. 
<P>
Most federal government listings in the telephone directory blue pages read like an agency's organization chart--names of offices, not services. All that is changing. GSA is leading a Reinventing Government effort to improve government blue pages. More than 200 federal employees in 25 federal agencies received the Vice President's Hammer Award on November 15 for their work in phase 1 of the project. All the major phone companies across the country are participating as partners. Within the next few months, 18 million households in 10 cities will see improved blue pages.
<P>
To volunteer, federal workers should contact Jack Finley at (202) 501-3932 or e-mail: <A HREF="mailto:jack.finley@fed.gov"> jack.finley@fed.gov</A> or Bonnie Seybold at (202) 273-3440 or e-mail:<A HREF="mailto:bonnie.seybold@fed.gov"> bonnie.seybold@fed.gov.</A>

Redesigning a government that works better and costs less calls for new ideas and creative thinking. 
It also calls for leadership from agency officials; employee empowerment and teamwork; interagency 
cooperation; partnerships with employee unions, state and local governments, and the business community; 
Congressional action; and support from the American people.  We've already done a lot, but our 
achievements are among <A HREF="/library/nprrpt/annrpt/vp-rpt96/index.html">The Best Kept Secrets in Government.</A>
On this page are some of the initiatives and activities that are underway to move us to a customer-friendly, performance-based government for the 21st century.

In 1993, the year government reinvention began, only three agencies - the Social Security Administration, the Internal Revenue Service, and the United States Postal Service -- committed to customer service standards.  The number went to 150 agencies in 1994, and 214 in 1995.  Today most agencies are beyond just setting standards, they are putting those standards to work to improve services to the American people, our customers.

     <H1 ALIGN=LEFT><B>A Brief History of the <BR>
     National Performance Review</B></H1>

<BR CLEAR=LEFT>

<HR SIZE=6 NOSHADE>
<P>
     The National Performance Review is the Clinton-Gore Administration's initiative to
reform the way the federal government works.  Its goal is to create a government that "works
better and costs less."  Begun in the early days of the Administration, and with Vice President Al
Gore at its helm, the Review has operated the duration of the Administration through several
phases of initiatives.
<P>
<B>Preparing the Original Report</B>
<P>
     The National Performance Review was created by President Bill Clinton on March 3,
1993.  He appointed Vice President Al Gore as its leader.  The President gave the review a
6-month deadline -- report results to him by September 7, 1993.
<P>
     The review was largely staffed by about 250 career civil servants.  In addition, some
interns,  state and local government employees on loan, and a few consultants were also engaged
in the work of this interagency task force.  The core leadership included Elaine Kamarck, a senior
political advisor to the Vice President, Bob Stone, project director,  and four deputies:  Billy
Hamilton, who led a series of teams examining the 24 largest agencies (Agriculture, Commerce,
Defense, etc.); John Kamensky, who led a series of teams examining governmentwide systems
(procurement, budget, personnel, etc.); Bob Knisely,  who focused on special fiscal analyses; and
Carolyn Lukensmeyer, who focused on internal staff dynamics and communication.  
<P>
     They launched the effort with an initial training session for the newly formed staff on
April 15, 1993.  David Osborne, co-author of  "Reinventing Government" served as a key
advisor and spoke at this kickoff session along with the Vice President and the deputy director
for management at the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), Phil Lader.
<P>
     Vice President Gore visited a series of agencies during the next few months to learn
first-hand the problems facing these agencies.  He also hosted a June 1993 "Reinventing
Government Summit" in Philadelphia of corporate executives, government leaders, and
consultants who were leaders in organizational change.
<P>
     The President had also directed agencies to create their own internal reinvention teams
that worked with the corresponding NPR teams (many of which, such as NPR, continued on beyond
the end of the initial review to assist in implementing the resulting recommendations).  NPR
worked closely with these teams in developing the recommendations presented to the Vice
President.
<P>
     Vice President Gore was heavily involved in the decisions being made and, before
publishing the final report, met with each agency head to ensure his or her support for his
proposed recommendations.  The final report was based on a series of "accompanying" reports
prepared by the nearly  two dozen teams of NPR staffers.   The final report highlighted 119 of the
384 recommendations listed in an appendix.   The 38 specific accompanying reports total nearly
2,000 pages and expanded on the 384 recommendations by detailing 1,250 specific actions
intended to save $108 billion, reduce the number of "overhead" positions, and improve
government operations.
<P>
     The final report,
<A HREF="/library/nprrpt/annrpt/redtpe93/index.html"> <I>Creating a Government That Works Better and Costs Less</I>,</A> 
was presented to President Clinton in a ceremony on the White House lawn on September 7, 1993. 
Immediately after the White House event, the President and Vice President made a tour of the
country to promote the report and to issue 
<A HREF="/library/index.html#direct"> Presidential directives </A> to begin implementing its
recommendations. By December 1993, the President had signed 16 directives implementing
specific recommendations, including cutting the work force by 252,000 positions, cutting internal
regulations in half, and requiring agencies to set customer service standards.
<P>
<B>Implementing Phase I Recommendations</B>
<P>
     Shortly after NPR's 1993 report was released, most of the staff returned to their home
agencies.  About 50 staff remained on the task force to start implementation of a series of
over-arching initiatives.  These efforts included training federal employees about customer
service, creating reinvention laboratories to pilot innovations, promoting the streamlining of
headquarters functions, and staffing NPR-recommended cross-agency councils such as the
National Partnership Council, the President's Management Council,  and the Government
Information Technology Services Working Group.
<P>
     NPR also created a tracking system to follow progress on each of the 1,250 individual
action items.  Individual agencies were charged with following through on the two-thirds of the
recommendations that were specifically targeted to them.  The remaining one-third -- mostly
recommendations affecting all agencies, such as budget reform or civil service reform -- became
the responsibility of interagency groups (such as the Chief Financial Officers Council and the
Electronic Benefits Transfer Task Force), OMB, or NPR.  For example, OMB took the lead in
implementing the Government Performance and Results Act and NPR took the lead on customer
service standards.
<P>
     NPR worked with OMB and White House staffs to develop performance agreements
between major agency heads and cabinet secretaries, and the President.  As of  the end of 1995,
the heads of 8 of the 24 largest agencies had piloted the signing of  performance agreements with
the President -- something never before done.  OMB and NPR are coordinating the development
of additional agreements in 1996.
<P>
     The biggest challenge facing NPR was communicating its message to the federal work
force.  It developed a training video, which was shown by the Federal Executive Boards and
Federal Executive Associations around the country.  It prepared an interactive CD-ROM disk of
the original report, its accompanying reports, the customer service report, and the status report.  It
worked with the Federal Quality Institute to develop training curricula.  It also created a
newsletter for federal employees.
<P>
     NPR also sponsored the creation of a series of interagency initiatives under the umbrella
of "Net Results," an electronic interchange of information and ideas among federal employees
and the general public.  This now includes this web site and a series of other sites 
<A HREF="links/index.html">(go to Web Links). </A> 
It also sponsored an electronic forum on reinvention issues involving hundreds of people
across the country in late 1994 and is helping pilot a rule making initiative on-line in early 1996.
<P>
     NPR's biggest initiative in 1994 was helping agencies create their first sets of customer
service standards.  NPR held weekly training sessions during the summer of 1994 to help
agencies develop their standards.   By October 1994, about 150 agencies had prepared around
1,500 standards.  The previous year, only 3 agencies had standards.
<P>
     NPR also piloted a partnership with the State of 
<A HREF="http://libmail.chemek.cc.or.us/~rilg/OR_OPT/contents.htm">Oregon </A> to focus on jointly achieving
program results in children and family programs.  The Vice President co-signed an agreement in
December 1994 with the governor and local officials to work together in creating a
results-oriented service delivery system.
<P>
     The Vice President stayed personally involved in the reinvention initiative.  In March
1994, he presented his first progress report to the President on the first anniversary of the
President's creation of NPR.  The Vice President also made a major speech later that month at
Georgetown University outlining his vision of the new role of federal executives, in July he
spoke at the annual Federal Quality Conference, and throughout the year, he presented awards to
teams of federal employees who had reinvented their part of the government. By early 1996, his
<A HREF="/library/awards/hammer/index.html">"Hammer Award" </A>
 had been given to more than 250 teams of federal employees across the government.
<P>
     By  September 1994, the first anniversary of the release of the original report,  NPR
concluded that significant progress was being made in the implementation of its
recommendations.  It also found that many agencies were making changes that went far beyond
what NPR recommended and a number of these efforts were highlighted in its 
<A HREF="/library/nprrpt/annrpt/wrkcst94/create.html">status report </A> to the
President.
<P>
     Outside observers also examined the progress of NPR.  The 
<A HREF="/library/index.html#outside">General Accounting Office </A>
issued an initial report on NPR's recommendations in December 1993, and a one year status
report in December 1994.  The Brookings Institution released its  initial assessment in August
1994, and a book in January 1995.  Other observers also offered their assessments. 
<P>
     During this year, Congress enacted about one-quarter of the recommendations needing
legislative action.  The most significant included the "buyout" bill, which allowed agencies to
offer financial incentives to selected employees to leave the government.  This bill, signed in
March 1994, also raised the number of positions to be reduced over 5 years from the 252,000
recommended by NPR to 272,900.  The third, the "Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of
1994" was ultimately signed into law in October 1994. By the end of the 103rd Congress in
December 1994, 34 laws had been signed implementing about a quarter of those NPR
recommendations requiring legislation.
<P>
<B>Phase II of the Performance Review </B>
<P>
     NPR opened 1995 with the realization that the election of a new Congress meant that the
Administration would have an opportunity to expand its agenda for governmental reform. 
President Clinton asked Vice President Gore on December 19, 1994 to launch a "second phase"
of reinvention -- known as "Phase II."
<P>
     Agencies were asked to look hard at their missions and decide what government should
or should not be doing.  Initial agencies reviewed, such as the Departments of Energy and
Housing and Urban Development, proposed substantial changes.  As the agency, OMB, and NPR
teams completed their reviews, the President and Vice President made announcements regarding
their decisions.
<P>
     The Vice President also asked NPR to help lead a 
<A HREF="/initiati/common/index.html">major reform of the regulatory system.</A> 
A series of initiatives was undertaken in early 1995 to identify obsolete regulations that could be
eliminated, create partnerships between regulators and those being regulated, and identify
specific regulations that could be revised.  The President and Vice President held a series of
announcements during the Spring and Summer to release these new proposals.
<P>
     By September 1995, NPR Phase II proposed about 200 new recommendations, with
savings totaling nearly $70 billion over five years,  agencies continued to implement more of  the
original recommendations.  By September 1995, agencies claimed they had completed
implementation of one-third of the 1,250 original recommendations with savings totaling &#036;58
billion of the originally-recommended &#036;108 billion in savings.  Agencies also identified &#036;28
billion a year in reduced regulatory burdens and proposed eliminating 16,000 pages of
regulations.  They also proposed plans for changing the way they enforced regulations to increase
the use of partnership arrangements and reduce historical emphases on identifying procedural
violations unrelated to performance.
<P>
     NPR continued the implementation of a number of initiatives from Phase I, successfully
using benchmarking studies to encourage broad action across agencies on specific issues, such as
tele-servicing.  It also continued the Vice President's Hammer Awards and agencies expanded
the number of <A HREF="/initiati/reinvent/index.html">reinvention labs.</A>
   In addition, it expanded its work with state-local governments
on the use of performance agreements in place of restrictive grant programs.   A number of these
initiatives were detailed in the President's February 1995 budget proposals.
<P>
     Agencies also revised their customer service standards.  The 
<A HREF="/library/nprrpt/csrpt/cusfir95/index.html">October 1995 Customer Service Standards report</A>
 shows 214 agencies with over 3,000 standards of service to the public.
<P>
     Congress held numerous hearings on NPR-related recommendations and acted upon
several during the course of the year, including the elimination of "unfunded mandates" on states
and localities, reducing the number of congressionally mandated reports prepared by federal
agencies, and new flexibilities for the Federal Aviation Administration.  Several congressional
committees explored the need for a major reorganization of the federal government, but took no
action. 
<P>
<B><A HREF="/library/papers/bkgrd/balbud.html">Governing in a Balanced Budget World:</A> 
 New Initiatives for 1996</B>
<P>
     By early 1996, it became clear to most agencies that they would face declining fiscal
resources for the foreseeable future.  The President's fiscal year 1997 budget projected a balance
for the first time in several decades and proposed cutting domestic agencies on average by 22
percent over a 6-year period.  The Republican Congress had proposed cuts equivalent to a
35-percent cut over the same period.
<P>
     Vice President Gore recognized that, under either scenario, agencies needed a blueprint
for how they could approach these cuts and proposed a series of new initiatives intended to show
how the Administration would responsibly govern in a balanced budget world.  He observed that
agencies needed to focus on the ends, not the means, of what government does and must delegate
more authority to managers on the front line.  He also saw information technology allowing a
shift away from the traditional "one size fits all" approach to a more tailored "custom fit"
approach to the missions of individual agencies.  Building on the successes of NPR's 
<A HREF="/initiati/reinvent/index.html">reinvention labs</A> and other initiatives, he proposed agencies:
<P>
<U>Convert to Performance-Based Organizations</U>.  Agencies would take functions that deliver
measurable services and grant them greater autonomy from government-wide rules in exchange
for greater accountability for results.  This includes separating policy making out from these
organizations and hiring a chief executive on a performance contract for a fixed term.  This
approach is used successfully in the United Kingdom to improve services and reduce costs.
<P>
<U>Improve Customer Service Dramatically</U>.  All agencies would be challenged to set service goals
that were significantly better so everyone in American would see government service was getting
better.  The heads of the 11 agencies with the greatest customer contact made public
commitments to improve selected services during 1996, and other activities were announced to
improve government services.
<P>
<U>Increase the Use of Regulatory Partnerships</U>.  During the previous two years, the Environmental
Protection Agency and other regulatory agencies had piloted approaches to non-coercive
partnerships that focus on meeting environmental goals rather than on complying with regulatory
processes.  Gore announced that these approaches would become the mainstream strategy for
federal regulatory agencies.
<P>
<U>Create Performance-Based Partnership Grants</U>.  Gore proposed converting the existing 600 grant
system to federal-state-local partnerships based on achieving results rather than focus on process. 
By jointly developing goals and objectives for major programmatic areas, states and localities
would be given greater flexibility in using and accounting for federal grant funds.
<P>
<U>Establish Single Points of Contact for Communities</U>.  A major challenge for communities dealing
with the federal government is untangling the complexity of its programs to determine who is
responsible for what.  Gore recommended that a single point of contact be designated for the
nation's larger communities to create integrated accountability for the federal government's
actions in those communities.
<P>
<U>Transform the Federal Workforce</U>.  The existing civil service system, largely crafted in 1883, can
no longer respond quickly to change or the varying needs of different organizations in the federal
government.  Gore proposed major overhauls in 1993 and 1994 that had not received
congressional support.  While not backing away from his support for these changes, he
recommended quick action on issues where there was bipartisan support, such as expanding
existing authorities for agencies to tailor the present system to their individual needs.  He also
reiterated earlier recommendations to increase training investments in the workforce and hold
senior executives more accountable for achieving results.
<P>
     Like the Phase II initiatives, these initiatives were also included in the President's fiscal
year 1997 budget.  NPR created selected teams to lead the implementation of these initiatives
during Summer 1996.
<P>
     NPR is also working with a series of agencies that have substantial contacts with the
American public to improve their service levels over the coming year.  The objective of this
initiative is to meet Vice President Gore's commitment of improved customer service that every
American will see in the coming year.
<P>

<H1><B>Vice President Gore Answers Questions from the Internal Revenue Services' Leader's
Digest</B></H1>
</CENTER>
<P>
<B>Q: Can you tell us how the National Performance Review (NPR) came about and what its
mission is?</B>
<P>
A:   In March of 1993 the President announced that "the federal government is broken and we
intend to fix it," and he asked me to lead an effort to reinvent the federal government.  The effort
led to the National Performance Review.  Unlike past government reformers, I gathered insiders-experienced federal workers--organized them into teams to review government operations and
issues, and asked them to come back with ideas and solutions.  NPR is not about getting rid of
government--it's about making it work better and cost less.  It's about creating a government that
makes sense.  A government that regulates people and business by focusing on results--not red
tape, that recognizes that the American people are its customers and puts them first not last.
<P>
<B>Q: What do you feel is the most important measure to determine if reinvention is working?</B>
<P>
A:   There are many ways to gage the success of reinvention.  However, the first and foremost
is the American peoples' restored trust in their government.  The world has changed and so have
people's needs and expectations.  For years, we Americans complained that our government
wasn't serving us, that it had gotten so bogged down in process and that it had forgotten about its
purpose.  But now, throughout the government, federal employees are taking their cue from the
business world and asking the customer, you and me, what our needs are instead of telling us. 
They're eliminating programs that are obsolete, reforming agencies, and streamlining and
simplifying regulations.  Federal agencies are actually getting fan mail for these improvements.  I
know that the IRS web site, a Hammer Award winner, has gotten letters from people all over the
country complimenting them on the service.
<P>
<B>Q: In light of that, what is the most exciting aspect of the NPR so far?</B>
<P>
A:   I think the impact of customer service standards has created an entirely new relationship
between the federal government and its customers.  It puts customers first by calling on agencies
to set and publicly post standards so that people can know exactly what they should expect.  As
you know, the IRS was one of the first agencies to publish customer service standards and the
results have been outstanding.  Last year the IRS promised that you would send out refunds in 40
days or if they filed electronically a mere 21 days.  I understand that more than 98 percent of
refunds went out on time--as promised.  What better way to reform government then to make
promises to the public to fix the system and then stick to them.
<P>
<B>Q: What should management do to encourage risk takers and pioneers in reinvention?</B>
<P>
A:   All managers could take a lesson from what Secretary of Education Dick Riley is doing. 
He hands out wallet-size "reinvention permission slips" to every single employee in his
department.  That's a pretty powerful message from the secretary of a department to front-line
employees.
<P>
     Similarly, other government leaders hand out "forgiveness coupons" designed to
encourage managers and workers alike to take risks.  They can redeem them if necessary--and
sometimes it is necessary.  But the point is to encourage them to try something new, to innovate,
to take some changes, to try to learn.  Organizations that do not learn, do not change. 
Organizations that do not change eventually do not work.
<P>
<B>Q:  There has been public perception that reinventing is just another name for personnel
cuts.  How do you assure government employees that the "reforms" won't stop once the
staffing goals have been reached?</B>
<P>
A:   The reforms won't stop because federal workers won't want to go back to the red tape and
redundancy they are getting rid of.  One of our primary goals is to empower federal workers--to
free them from the burdens of overregulation and micromanagement.  NPR's recommendation to
shrink the federal workforce was mainly targeted at positions of overcontrol, especially
headquarters staff, supervisors, auditors, accountants and specialists in budget, procurement and
finance.  Reducing this structure will give us a more inspired, empowered and productive
workforce.  This goal is even more important now that we have a durable bipartisan consensus on
a balanced budget.
<P>
<B>Q: This issue of Leader's Digest is exploring the changes that managers will face in the
future.  What do you see the workforce challenges being and what skills will federal
managers need to assimilate?</B>
<P>
A:   That's a great question because the role of the federal manager is essential in helping
other federal employees believe in reinvention and the possibility of change.
<P>
     First, managers must involve all employees in developing  clear vision and a shared sense
of mission.  The vision--supplemented with clearly understood goals and shared values among
everyone in the organization--can be the basis of intelligent decisions.  Managers must help their
staff cross boundaries and work effectively with other organizations.  In intelligent organizations,
teams and their members must reach out to create a more integrated organization--one that puts
their customers first.
<P>
     It is essential that managers empower their employees to achieve the goals of the
organization.  Recently, I had the privilege of giving a Hammer Award to a joint union-management team of field and headquarters workers at OSHA.  This Design Team, as it's called,
developed a whole new way for OSHA area field offices to work and team members are now
"rolling out" the model all over the country.  I'm convinced that it's the future federal regulatory
approach--teams to reduce layers of management, partnership with those being regulated and
common, results-oriented goals--in OSHA's case to protect the health and safety of workers.
<P>
     Also, managers need to create clear accountability.  When the IRS signed on as a pilot
agency of the Government Performance and Results Act in 1993, it made a public commitment
to establish performance goals and to report to the taxpaying public how well they were meeting
those goals.  Managers need to be aware that they will now be expected to concentrate on
performance and carefully measure results--outcomes and outputs, not just inputs.
<P>
     Finally, managers need to surmount two major hurdles.  The first is cynicism--specifically
a belief that this new set of changes is not real.  If managers let cynicism stand in the way of
change they will face more and more hostility from an increasingly cynical public and from
restless employees who understand why this change is good from the workforce as well as for the
American people.
<P>
     The second obstacle is culture.  Many federal employees find security in the existing
work culture.  It limits individual accountability and protects against change.  But, because this
existing culture no longer services the public interest as well as it should, our challenge is to
create a new one--one that supports innovation and quality.  Then a new face of government will
appear--of leaders with vision, of employees newly empowered and newly motivated, and of
customers newly satisfied.

<CENTER><h3><b>VICE PRESIDENT GORE REVEALS GOVERNMENT SECRETS</b></h3></CENTER>
<br>
Vice President Gore presented his annual report on the National Performance Review- <A HREF="/library/nprrpt/annrpt/vp-rpt96/index.html"> The Best Kept Secrets in Government </A> - to the President on September 20 in Portland, Oregon. Many people havent heard that government is getting better, the Vice President reported. "Its time for these secrets to get out."
"We are also going to have to do better by our workforce," he wrote. "Any Fortune 500 company would be lucky to have a workforce like the federal governments. We need to invest in it: better tools and training, closer partnerships between labor and management, more opportunities and challenges for our senior executives."
The report features a front-line federal worker, a homemaker, a business executive, and a mayor. Their stories show that government culture is changing for the better, although many things need to be improved. The book highlights internal reforms (such as procurement), customer service, and partnerships with business and communities. 
<p>
Reinvention Highlights
<p>
The book reports the smallest federal workforce in 30 years and savings of $118 billion because of reinvention. Heres a sampling of what federal workers and their agencies are doing:
<ul>
 	<li>Health and Human Services slashed the approval time in half for new drugs and approved 13 new drugs to combat AIDS and HIV infection in record time.
 	<li>Justice reduced management layers in the Marshal Service from eight to four and consolidated 25 of its organizational units into 11.
 	<li>NASA went from a 77 percent cost overrun to a five percent underrun.
 	<li>Housing and Urban Development condensed 42 mortgage-backed securities processes, saving lenders $50 million annually by eliminating 180,000 sheets of paper that required 400,000 signatures. 
 	<li>Interior reduced the Park Services central staff by 25 percent, reduced its 10 regional offices to seven, and moved hundreds of employees out to the parks, serving visitors.
</ul>
<br>
Youll find many more examples in the book.

Federal agencies are finding that the Internets picture perfect World Wide Web is the place to be to offer information and services to their customers. Agencies are also using Internet technology to provide information and automate internal processes on intranets. At the very least, agencies are using the Internet to connect employees by e-mail all over the country and the globe.
<p>
"These technologies allow our government to increase its efficiency," said Vice President Gore in a statement released from the White House on August 1, 1996.
The Internal Revenue Services industry award-winning Web site <A HREF="http://www.irs. ustreas.gov"> (http://www.irs. ustreas.gov) </A>was immensely popular in 1996, with customers downloading more than 2.5 million forms and publications. The Social Security Administrations PEBES service <A HREF="http://www.ssa.gov">(http://www.ssa.gov)</A> allows customers to complete a form online requesting a statement of their Social Security earnings along with an estimate of their future benefits. In the past, customers had to call or visit the Social Security Administration to get the form. Here are just a few other activities underway.
<p>
Educations Award-Winning Site
<p>
The Department of Educations INet (Institutional Communications Network) has both Gopher and Web service <a href="http://www.ed.gov">(http://www.ed.gov)</a>. INet had 3.6 million hits in October, 1996, a 168 percent increase in just one year.
<p>
<i>Government Executive Magazine</i> recommends the site to Federal officials who want a lesson in how to set up an attractive, comprehensive, and user-friendly site. Cyberhound gave it a four-star rating for outstanding content, design, technical merit, and entertainment.

<a name="NIH"><CENTER><h3><b>NO TIME (KEEPING) ON THEIR HANDS</b></h3></CENTER>

The National Institutes of Health is taking the time out of timekeeping. A business engineering team developed a new automated system called "ITAS" for Integrated Time and Attendance System. ITAS is currently operational in two NIH Institutes that served as pilots and will be deployed agency-wide over the next few months.

<br>
<h3><b>Timekeeping by Exception</b></h3>

The user-friendly system does most of the work. It moved NIH toward timekeeping by exception, according to Gail Grossman, administrative officer at one of the pilots. If an employee is here an entire pay period and does not take leave, the system automatically generates the timecard, so the employee and the timekeeper do not need to do anything.

<br>
<h3><b>Responsibility Rests with the Federal Worker</b></h3>

The greatest benefit of the system, Grossman said, is that it can greatly reduce and possibly eliminate the timekeepers responsibilities. The system puts more responsibility on employees, allowing them to view and certify their own timecards prior to final supervisory approval. They can also schedule full-day absences in advance.

<br>
<h3><b>National Science Foundation Had the Model</b></h3>

ITAS is flexible enough to handle the full spectrum of employee work schedules. Linda Jackson, administrative officer at the second pilot, said the system runs on Macs as well as personal computers. A system developed at the National Science Foundation is the model for ITAS. The team selected it as the best after researching automated time and attendance systems at other federal agencies.
<p>
The National Performance Review recommended eliminating unnecessary, labor-intensive time and attendance paperwork and using technology for what was left. The General Accounting Office released <A HREF="/library/#gao">new policy guidelines</A> on March 25, 1996 that permit agencies to get rid of sign-in sheets. No excuses anymore, Vice President Gore told participants at a Reinvention Conference in 1996. Its time to change.

<br>
<h3><b>NIH Will Share the New System</b></h3>

Richard Drury, Director of Human Resource Systems at NIH, said We are open to partnerships with other agencies that want to share in the benefits of this initiative. Contact him at (301) 496-4368 or <a href="mailto:richard_drury@nih.gov">richard_drury@nih.gov</a>.

<a name="out"><CENTER><h3><b>OUT OF BLUE (PAGES)</b></h3></CENTER>

When you applied for your passport, did you know to call the State Department? Many people dont, and its frustrating to customers and phone operators alike.
<p>
For most Americans, their first contact with government at any level is the phone book. Unfortunately most federal blue page listings read like the agencys organization chartnames of offices, not services. 
<p>
A three-year National Performance Review initiative, led by the General Services Administration, set out in 1996 to make government Blue Pages more customer-friendly. The Blue Pages Team, made up of federal workers nationwide, is working with about 30 companies that publish 6,200 telephone directories in the United States.

<br>
<h3><b>200 Federal Workers Get Hammers for First Phase</b></h3>

The first phase of this mammoth project was celebrated on November 15, when 200 federal employees from 25 federal agencies received Vice President Gores Hammer Award. From Chicago and Indianapolis to New Orleans and Los Angelesall in all, more than 18 million households in 10 cities will see more user-friendly Blue Pages as new phone books hit their doorsteps, said Dave Barram, Acting Administrator, General Services Administration.
<p>
NPRs Greg Woods, who represented the Vice President at the awards ceremony, said, From the beginning, fixing the Blue Pages has been a true partnership within the government and with all the major telephone companies across the country. Some of the phone companies really got into it. In fact, Ameritech gave us our first project manager.
<p>
GSAs Ron Piasecki, who leads the effort for GSA, also praised Southwest Bell and Sprint. Sprint, he said, has decided that the Blue Pages should be a public service and will not charge for the listings.

<br>
<h3><b>Blue Pages Project Has a Dream Design</b></h3>

Piasecki also said the first phase improvementsmainly a revised agency template thats more user friendlyhave been so successful that the government teams decided to skip phase twoadding most frequently called numbers. Teams will move right into their third phase dream design. This new design is phone numbers organized by function or topics such as Medicare, passports, benefits, or Armed Forces recruiting. Blue pages will include e-mail and Internet Web addresses. This concept was developed by a sub-group of eight agencies, chaired by Carl Montoya at Health and Human Services. This design will be rolled out in Cleveland in May 1997.

<br>
<h3><b>Blue Page Pioneers</b></h3>

The inspiration for improving blue pages came from the Federal Executive Board in Denver. An FEB teamwith representatives from the General Services Administration, Office of Personnel Management, Government Printing Office and the FEB Boardpartnered with U.S. West to lead federal agencies in the Denver area to improve their listings in 1995. Some organizations that have high involvement with the publicsuch as Social Security, Agriculture, and Transportationare also pioneers in improving federal phone listings.

<br>
<h3><b>Volunteers, Please Call</b></h3>

As this initiative moves into more and more communities, Piasecki said, We need additional volunteersmovers and shakers from federal agencies all over the country. For more information, contact Jack Finley at (202) 501-3932 or <a href="mailto:Jack.Finley@fed.gov">Jack.Finley@fed.gov</a> or Bonnie Seybold at (202) 273-3440 or <a href="mailto:Bonnie.Seybold @fed.gov">Bonnie.Seybold @fed.gov</a>.

<a name="reinv"><CENTER><h3><b>REINVENTING REGULATIONS PAYS OFF BIG</b></h3></CENTER>

Regulatory agencies are using common sense to reinvent the federal regulatory process. Trusting businesses to do the right thing is working. 
<p>
A <A HREF="/library/direct/orders/2646.html">1993 Presidential Executive Order on Regulatory Planning and Review</A> laid the foundation for a regulatory system that meddles less and puts more responsibility in the hands of the people themselves.
<p>
The President and Vice President pulled out the stops in February 1995 when they summoned the heads of regulatory agencies to a press conference. Were going to change the regulatory culture, the President announced. Rethink the entire regulatory process, he told the regulators. Review every reg youve got. Cut obsolete regulations. Reward results, not red tape. Negotiate, dont dictate. Get out of Washingtoncreate grass roots partnerships. 
<p>
And while youre cutting back on regs, the Vice President added, write whats left in plain English. In a <A HREF="/library/direct/memos/reinvent.html"> Presidential memo </A> that followed, President Clinton said reform of the regulatory system is the central part of reinventing government.

<br>
<h3><b>Regulatory Culture Is Changing</b></h3>

Are federal workers changing the regulatory culture? Many outside observers say yes. In terms of affecting field operations, says Harvards regulatory expert Malcolm Sparrow, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration is moving very fast. Its going extraordinarily fast for any organization. For the federal government, its lightning speed. (See story on page 6.)
<p>
Richard Zanetti, editor of Chemical Engineering magazine, a McGraw-Hill trade publication, says the Environmental Protection Agencys first voluntary program worked. The program is a toxic emissions reduction program called 33/50. I would guess that the taxpayer return on investment...is light years ahead of that from traditionally run environmental programs...33/50 may be the harbinger of a changing regulatory rationale.(See box on page 5.)
<p>
Companies cut more than 750 million pounds of pollution in the time it would take EPA to write a reg. Its awesome, said Chris Tirpak, 33/50 deputy. We were stunned that companies signed up to make these reductions publicly. You take a risk in admitting that you are a big polluter. But companies even signed up for 90 percent reductions and some companies made it. All we did was set the national goals and identify the targets. The companies chose their own methods.

<br>
<h3><b>Building on What Works</b></h3>

The 33/50 program was started in 1991, but the Clinton-Gore Administration did not ignore it, rename it, or get rid of it. Vice President Gore asked federal workers to reinvent government by building on success, not just harping on problems. When the 33/50 program closed in September 1996after meeting its goals a year earlyit had spawned 80 more voluntary programs at EPA. Collectively, these programs are called Partners for the Environment and Regulatory Reinvention Initiatives.
<p>
With partnerships, EPA has changed its emphasis from cleaning up pollution to preventing it. Since 1992, the agency more than tripled the number of members in its partnership programs. More than 7,100 companies now participate.
EPA, OSHA, and other regulatory agencies did not give up their responsibility to enforce the rules and apply stiff penalties if its necessary. Because they no longer waste time on the good guys, they can do a better job going after the cheaters.

<br>
<h3><b>What Your Agency Can Do</b></h3>

The Food and Drug Administration, EPA, and OSHA started interagency meetings to share reinvention ideas. Joint meetings have been so successful that they invite other agencies to join. If you would like to join this growing group in the Washington, DC area, call FDAs Marie Urban or Audrey Borja at (301) 827-0946.

<br>
<h3><b>Easy to Read Rules Are Easier to Follow</b></h3>

Part of good customer service means eliminating bureaucratese and writing regulations in plain English. NPRs interagency Plain English team believes that if you write clearer regulations, users wont have to waste time figuring out what the government means.
<p>
Led by Annetta Cheek at Interiors Bureau of Land Management, the team opened a <a href="http://www.blm.gov/nhp/ NPR/plaineng.html">Plain English web page</A> in December at <a href="http://www.blm.gov/nhp/ NPR/plaineng.html">http://www.blm.gov/nhp/ NPR/plaineng.html</a>.

<h3><b>33/50 Program Achieves<br>
Major Environmental Goal Without One Word of Government Regulation</b></h3>

The Environmental Protection Agencys voluntary 33/50 partnership program challenged industry to voluntarily reduce 1.5 billion pounds of environmental releases of 17 high-volume toxic chemicals by 33 percent in two years and 50 percent in three years. More than 1,300 companies representing 5,000 facilities participated in the program.
On June 26, 1996, Vice President Gore released the most recent (1994) data from EPAs Toxics Release Inventory (industrial chemicals that pose environmental and health concerns). It shows that the program reached its goals a year early. Free of government regulations, paperwork, penalties, punishments, and lawsuits, each company developed its own goals and plans and let EPA know of its commitment in a simple letter.

<br>
<h3><b>Exchanging Blue Ribbons for Red Tape</b></h3>

One of the participating companies3Mnominated the 33/50 team for the Hammer Award, commending it for exchanging blue ribbons for red tape. It was the first time a company had nominated a government regulatory agency for the Vice Presidents award. NPR Project Director Bob Stone presented the Hammer at 3Ms headquarters in St. Paul on June 18, 1996. He also presented a companion award to 3-M, representing more than 1,300 industry partners, for participating in the 35/50 program.

<a name="OSHA"><CENTER><h3><b>THE NEW OSHA: 
<br>GETTING A <I>GRIP</I> ON WORKPLACE INJURIES, ILLNESSES, AND DEATHS</b></h3></CENTER>

<br>
<h3><b>GRIP Is Getting Results and Improving Performance</b></h3>

John Paulk, Safety Director for Horizon Steel Erectors Company, sometimes travels at company expense to tell the public how much his company appreciates the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. Stranger than fiction, perhaps, but trueand not an isolated incident.
<p>
More and more, businessmen and women are saying they like OSHAthe new OSHA, whose modus operandi has changed from mainly enforcement to increased partnership with industry and labor. The new OSHA is a symbol of the fast-moving reinvention of the federal governments regulatory system.

<br>
<h3><b>Calculating and Counting on Change</b></h3>

Despite a 57 percent drop in workplace fatalities since OSHA was created in 1970, the agencys job of protecting the health and safety of American workers has been expanding at the same time its resources have been declining. We simply cant protect 92 million workers in more than six million workplaces with 2,000 state and federal compliance officers, said Joe Dear, Assistant Secretary for Occupational Safety and Health.
<p>
So, Dear created a self-managed Design Team in 1994 composed of 17 OSHA employeescompliance officers, managers, union representatives, and support staff from all over the country. (The team later expanded to 27 employees.) Dear gave them a two-year mandate and a blank piece of paper. Their charge: design a new OSHA, drawing from best practices in government and the private sector. The effort is an <A HREF="/initiati/reinvent/index.html">NPR Reinvention Lab</A>. Team leaders are Leo Carey, representing management, and Ken Maglicic, Vice President, National Council of Field Labor Locals, American Federation of Government Employees. Maglicic works as a compliance officer in the Columbus, Ohio, office. 
<p>
Ive been on a lot of teams, said team member David Katsock, compliance officer at the OSHA area office in Parsippany, NJ, but all the others were management-directed. Not this one, Katsock said. People worked on an equal footing. Members left their titles at the door, he said.

<br>
<h3><b>Going to the Experts</b></h3>

Team members started by visiting more than 100 front-line staff in area offices to get firsthand information and ideas. Sometimes people were skittish about talking. When we asked them what worked best, they pulled out their rule books, said Joel Sacks, staff with OSHAs Office of Reinvention. But wed keep asking, even after hours, What really works?
<p>
They discovered the agency was relying on one toolinspectionsto do the job, though research showed it would take 87 years for OSHA inspectors to visit every worksite in the country. They concluded that OSHA should add other tools to its reliance on enforcement penalties and citations. We cannot be everywhere all the time, said team member Robert Kulick, Area Director at Parsippany.
<p>
The Design Team came up with new tools, such as incentives and partnerships with employers, trade associations, unions and other governmental organizations. Partners would work together on the common goal of eliminating hazards to prevent injuries and illnesses. Traditional enforcement would focus on those who chose not to participate in the partnership efforts.
<p>
The new OSHA would judge its own performance by its impact on worker health and safety, not the number of inspections, citations, and penalties. Inspectors would stop working autonomously, rulebook in hand, in a reactive, piecemeal approach. Instead, area office staff would work in self-directed, multi-disciplinary teams, using problem-solving techniques and creative approaches to address hazardous working conditions. Two team models emerged. Onethe response teamfocuses on immediate complaints, referrals, outreach, and fatalities. The othera strategic intervention teamworks on longer-range prevention and partnership. The overall design is called Getting Results and Improving Performance (GRIP).

<br>
<h3><b>Making the Design Work</b></h3>

How do you implement such a grand design? The Design Team decided on a pilot test in a couple of offices. The Parsippany and Atlanta East offices would test and refine the concept. If it worked, they would expand it to all area offices.
<p>
All the research and evaluation paid off when GRIP was put into practice. The two best parts of redesign...are employee participation and outcome measurement, according to Howard Eberts, a union steward on the strategic intervention team in Columbus, Ohio. By allowing field employees to actively participate in improving the way we do business, our employees have more ownership in our work and take more pride in making our office succeed, Eberts said.
<p>
By the summer of 1996, 15 (of 67) area offices had implemented GRIP and the roll-out continues. OSHA workers have come up with some creative approaches for improving worker safety and health:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Parsippanys staff found that a large number of workers had been killed on highway construction sites in New Jersey over the last five years, and that the State was planning a massive, multi-billion dollar highway improvement program. Further, with an anticipated increase in auto and truck traffic over the next decade, OSHA could expect additional fatalities on highway construction sites.
<p>
To counter these threats, OSHA joined with the New Jersey State Police, the NJ Department of Transportation, and the International Laborers Union. The program uses an already existing state highway construction police unit to be a second set of eyes at construction sites. When troopers observe a hazardous condition, they bring it to the immediate attention of the contractor and the NJDOT. If the problem isnt fixed, the troopers call OSHA. Since OSHA trained the police in hazard recognition, the troopers have reported four times as many interventions.
<p>
<li>The Savannah, Georgia, OSHA area office set up a partnership with pulp and paper mill employers to improve safety and health programs and find and fix hazards in local mills. During the first six months, employers found 453 situations that violated OSHA rules, and corrected 255. OSHA devoted 320 staff hours to the project. By contrast, in the previous four years, the agency had spent 7,180 staff hours inspecting the industry with a return of 159 violations found and corrected. The partnership yielded a 3,200 percent increase in the number of hazards abated per hour of staff work.
<p>
<li>OSHAs Atlanta East office, Argonaut Insurance Company, the Department of Defense, the Florida State Consultation Program (funded by OSHA to provide onsite technical assistance) and Horizon Steel formed a partnership on a project Horizon was building for DOD in Florida. The centerpiece of the agreement was commitment from Horizon that every one of its workers100 percentwould use fall protection and that all of its supervisors would enforce this commitment.
<p>
The partnership was a success. Three workers who fell from heights ranging from 60 to 100 feet were protected and uninjured. Without the full body harnesses they were wearing, plus the tie off, all three would have been killed. In the first 90 days, Horizon had a 96 percent reduction in accident costs per person hourfrom $4.26 to 18 cents. Over six months, total workers compensation claims costs fell from more than $1 million to $13,200. Horizon Safety Director John Paulk now travels at company expense to tell others about the new OSHA.
</ul>
<br>
Sometimes GRIP teams simply apply common sense and quality management principles to reinvent a traditional approach. For example, OSHA gets lots of informal complaintslike phone calls from people who report a workplace hazard, but are unwilling to identify themselves. Before reinvention, OSHA staff wrote a letter to the employer. Meanwhile, the hazard remained, the complainant stewed, and other complaints stacked upmany up to 30 days. OSHA workers in Cleveland and Peoria substituted a quick phone call for the traditional letter to the company and then accepted a faxed response to verify that the employer had fixed the problem.
<p>
Cleveland, which receives the highest volume of complaints in the country, reduced the average time between the complaint and abatement from 39 workdays to nine; Peoria reduced its response time from 23 days to five. Backlogs are now rare. OSHA implemented the phone/fax complaint handling process nationwide. 

<br>
<h3><b>Reinventing Headquarters</b></h3>

Headquarters staff are reinventing their regulations and internal processes as well. For example, OSHA is improving, updating, or eliminating confusing, inconsistent, and duplicative regulations. In partnership with industry and labor, OSHA is revising standards and rewriting them in plain English.
<p>
OSHAs national office has also improved its service to the public. The agency gets about 12,000 requests a month for publications. In the past, mail orders were backlogged, phones went unanswered, and publications were often out of print. The publications staff got a GRIP, too. They cut the time for processing phone or mail orders from six weeks to less than one day and the backlog from 3,000 pieces to under 100.
<p>
Information technology also plays a big role in OHSAs efforts to meet the publics requests for help. OSHAs popular Web site (see below) receives close to one million hits a month, mostly from industry. The agency produced a CD-ROM to deliver more information to clients in the swiftest way possible.

<br>
<h3><b>Helping Is the Goal</b></h3>

The new OSHA has moved beyond the old focus of punishing employers who fail to meet all its standards. People will know that we are there to help, not to nail them, said Design Team member Connie Behee from Boise, Idaho.
<p>
Vice President Gore recognized the changes as well when he presented OSHAs Design Team with a Hammer Award on June 12, 1996. There really is a new OSHA out there, the Vice President said. The fact that youre doing it will be an inspiration to others.
<p>
After the award presentation, Parsipannys Dave Katsock said, I would do any project with this team. This team could find a way to get to Mars.

The 1997 Defense Authorization legislation, signed by President Clinton into law on September 23, contains the biggest change in government travel rules in 40 years. The new travel provisions, which implement reforms recommended by the National Performance Review, had strong bipartisan support in the Congress.
<p>
Implementation is expected to greatly reduce the governments high expenses in administering travel. Although the new law does not require agencies to use credit cards for travel, the Congressional conference report urged agencies to use their discretionary authority to maximize its use.
<p>
A task force of the Joint Financial Management Improvement Program, a government-wide reinvention activity, developed the new legislation and implementing regulations. Call (202) 512-9201 for the name of a task force member who can discuss the travel provisions. Call (202) 512-6000 to get a copy of the JFMIP report, Improving Travel Management Governmentwide.

<CENTER><h3><b>A PENNY DIE SAVED IS A PENNY DIE EARNED</b></h3></CENTER>
In two years, the labor-management partnership at the U.S. Mint in Philadelphia produced $1 million in savings by extending the life of dies used to make impressions on pennies. The partnership at the Philadelphia Mint is one of seven that received 1996 awards from the National Partnership Council. 
<p>
By experimenting, the Mint teams increased the life of dies from 700,000 impressions to 1.2 million. This meant 20,000 fewer dies each year. Also, the team now ships 95 percent of its orders within two days, beating the customer service standards that call for shipping all orders within three days. The team shipped 100 percent of orders for the Atlanta Centennial Olympics commemorative coins in one day. The partnership also reduced the number of formal grievances by 65 percent.

<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF">


	<H2 align=center>VICE PRESIDENT AL GORE'S ADDRESS <BR>
	AT THE PRESENTATION OF THE<BR>
	1996 INNOVATIONS IN AMERICAN GOVERNMENT<BR>
	AWARDS CEREMONY</H2>
<H3>Washington, D.C.<BR>
December 3, 1996</H3>


VICE PRESIDENT GORE:  Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen.  It's a great honor to be with you this evening, and to Susan Berresford, thank you for your leadership.  I'm one of many who felt the great pleasure at the announcement, when you assumed the presidency of the Ford Foundation last April.  Ms. Berresford has worked at the Foundation for more than twenty-five years, as many of you know, and has helped shaped many of its most important activities:  scholarship programs, programs to advance women's rights, community and economic development.  Efforts to strengthen government, and many others.  And it's a pleasure to be with you this evening.
<P>
I want to acknowledge my colleague in President Clinton's Cabinet, Secretary Henry Cisneros, and his Assistant Secretary, Andrew Cuomo.  Also among the distinguished guests who are present, include Mayor Debbie Jaramillo, of Santa Fe, New Mexico, and Governor -- former Governor Bill Milliken, about whom I'll say a few more words in just a moment.
<P>
And I know there are probably all kinds of other distinguished guests, and I just want to ask you to forgive me for not knowing enough to list everybody who should be listed.
<P>
This is a wonderful, wonderful occasion.  And for those of us who are interested in reinventing government, this is one of the most important events of the entire year, every year.  And I want to acknowledge Elaine Kamarck, my Chief of Staff in our Reinventing Government operation in the federal government.  We call it our REGO program -- that's "Gore" spells sideways.
<P>
[Laughter]
<P>
VICE PRESIDENT GORE:  I've worked hard on this program.
<P>
[Laughter]
<P>
VICE PRESIDENT GORE:  The Ford Foundation has so many programs in so many parts of the world, we couldn't even name a small fraction of them.  But we can point out that the Foundation's efforts to provide opportunity and justice, and its programs to promote democratic values, are critically important to our American society, and to societies around the world.
<P>
The Foundation's work represents a vision that we can all admire and respect, and I'm certain the Ford Foundation will continue to be a very powerful force for helping people and governments contend with some of the world's most pressing problems under its new leadership.  And may I also say a special word about the leadership of Bill Milliken, who has chaired the Innovations program's national selection committee from the beginning.  
<P>
He is retiring from that position this year, and he brought to the position of chair experience resulting from his three terms as Governor of Michigan, a full career in public life, and Ford Foundation trustee.  And you list off those titles and experiences and you really don't get the full flavor for the intangibles that he has provided the program, including his deep commitment to the potential of government as a source of strength for the American people, his wisdom about the kinds of programs people need, and his experience with how hard it is for government to accomplish its objectives.  All combined with an infectious warmth that embraces everyone who participates in the program.
<P>
I've talked to so many who have worked with Bill Milliken, and say that they feel better about themselves and what they're doing when they come under his influence.  So thank you very much, Governor Milliken.
<P>
And we welcome David Gergen to take his place as chair of this great program.  I had the privilege of working with David Gergen in the administration before he returned to the pedestal of bipartisan objectivity --
<P>
[Laughter]
<P>
VICE PRESIDENT GORE:  From which position he now dispenses advice evenhandedly to --
<P>
[Laughter]
<P>
VICE PRESIDENT GORE:  I see Bill Nelson out here.  I'm just realizing there are all kinds of elected officials I haven't recognized, and just, please, forgive me.
<P>
But, David, thank you for taking on this challenge, and for your commitment to the values that are recognized and celebrated in this program.  I really think it's so important.
<P>
Many of you who have worked in organizations, public and private, have learned over the years that men and women who care about what they're doing will work incredibly hard when they realize their work is appreciated.  Some of them will do it anyway.  But when there is an opportunity to publicly acknowledge and reward excellence, and the highest levels of achievement, it unlocks a higher fraction of human potential.
<P>
And of course, the innovations that are recognized in this program come about because of new efforts to unlock human potential.  The new changes in organizational theory that swept a lot of the private sector in the business world, and then migrated into government -- slowly, at first, and now we're beginning to see the start of a flood -- I hope.  And I do believe.
<P>
This change in organizational theory really has come about because of a new understanding of human potential.  We were burdened for so long by the ways of thinking and the metaphors that came out of the industrial age.  When the idea of the machine convinced us to organize our efforts as if the individuals who worked together were parts in a mechanism, who could most usefully employed doing the same specific thing over and over and over again, without change, until there was some decision made high up the organizational pyramid, and instructions conveyed down through the layers of organization to bring about a change in the specific task.
<P>
Then all of a sudden, a few leaders of organizations understood that their greatest asset was the unused creativity and brain power of the men and women in those organizations.  And they experimented with new systems to make those individuals understand that their ideas were of value, to enlist them in the effort to share in a mutual effort to create a bigger understanding of what the organization was doing, to use their ideas, and enlist them in the effort to implement their ideas.  
<P>
And those businesses that use this new approach began to be successful -- more so than their competitors.  And a whole generation of management gurus sprang up with phrases like "Theory Z" and "Total Quality Management," and all kinds of other phrases that all referred to the same basic insight:  namely, that the individuals in these organizations are smart, and they have brains, and if they can be encouraged to pay attention to what they're doing, and the relationship between what they're doing and what the organization is doing, and if the leaders of those organizations will listen to them and implement their ideas, then the organization as a whole can function in a much more creative way.
<P>
There's absolutely no reason whatsoever that these same insights cannot be used successfully in public organizations in government, and they are being used in government.  Measure results, not bureaucracy.  Empower the individuals in the organization with the same vision, the same values, the same goals that everyone in the organization understands, and then the organization can deal with change when it encounters change at its edge, where change is most often encountered by an organization.  And decisions can be made by individuals in roughly the same way that the CEO or the Secretary or the President, or whatever the leader of that organization is called, even if the decision is made by the clerk behind the desk, or the secretary behind the word processor.
<P>
But, as circumstances change, the organization must be willing to change quickly.  And of course, innovation is at the heart of our American culture, from be-bop to the light bulb, from Pop Art to the World Wide Web.  American innovation stems from our faith that a single individual can change the world, and our willingness to work hard day after day and night after night to make our dreams come true.  And nowhere in America today is innovation more essential than in government.
<P>
Whether the task is to improve the quality of life in our neighborhoods, or enhance our competitive edge in the global economy, whether it's to protect the health of our children, or the healthy of our planet, we desperately need the kind of government that produces better solutions, quicker results, and lighter burdens on the American people.
<P>
We know, having experienced in our own individual lives the qualitative difference when we enter a private business that has adopted these new techniques, and compare the experience to the one we have in a business that is still locked in the old ways, the old organization.  We know, from seeing it work and seeing its benefit, we know that it can be done in government, and we want -- we, the American people --- want to reward those who are making it happen in government, and we want to spread far and wide the message of your success, so that others will take heart, and emulate what you are doing.
<P>
And so tonight, we are honoring innovators who are delivering what was needed by their communities, their states, all of our country, all of the American people.  These innovators have delivered government that works better and costs left.  And having worked very closely myself with a lot of federal employees who've been involved in this effort, I know how very hard you have all worked, and I have the deepest appreciation for what you have accomplished.
<P>
You have somehow overcome an old, outdated culture that's like a summer cold.  You think it's gone, and you wake up one morning and it's still there.  You just have to keep fighting against people who just don't get it.  
<P>
One federal employee told me that, "I'm afraid to stick my neck out, because I'll have my head chopped off."  Each of you has identical stories, anecdotes, experiences, culled from the experiences of thousands, millions of government employees at various levels in our country who have been afraid to innovate.
<P>
Well, tonight, and each year, in this program, we say:  "We want you to go forward full speed ahead.  We honor you.  We appreciate you.  And we ask others to follow you."
<P>
Your successes go beyond more affordable housing in Santa Fe, new opportunities for the arts in Arlington County nearby, or safer streets in New York.  Beyond better health care in Oregon and Florida.  Beyond independence from welfare and a cleaner environment in California.  
<P>
You are having an effect well beyond the boundaries of your programs or your cities and states, because you're helping to restore the faith that most Americans once had, and that too many no longer have.  The faith that we can, indeed, redeem the promise of self-government.  The faith that we can solve even our greatest national problems by working together through the institutions of representative democracy.
<P>
A faith in ourselves, as free citizens of this great nation.  A faith that is absolutely critical to the future of our children and grandchildren as we near the cusp of this century.  
<P>
Restoring that faith is the main reason President Clinton and I put such a high priority on celebrating the successes of innovators like you.  As I mentioned, we've been working to reinvent the federal government.  When we began, the so-called experts told us it would take at least eight years to completely change the culture of such a huge organization.  
<P>
The so-called experts were absolutely right.
<P>
[Laughter]
<P>
VICE PRESIDENT GORE:  But in the first four years, we really have made great progress.  And now with four more years -- ahem.
<P>
[Laughter]
<P>
VICE PRESIDENT GORE:  -- we have just barely -- 
<P>
[Applause]
<P>
VICE PRESIDENT GORE:  -- enough time to finish the job.  
<P>
[Applause]
<P>
VICE PRESIDENT GORE:  You notice how David doesn't clap at that line any more.
<P>
[Laughter]
<P>
VICE PRESIDENT GORE:  So innovators like you are an enormous help to us.  Obviously, some of your new solutions will be adopted by other government managers dealing with similar programs, solutions like the way HUD has switched its focus from red tape to results in community planning, and the way FEMA has used technology to enhance disaster response.  Solutions like the constructive regulatory partnership between the Labor Department and the garment industry.
<P>
Examples like those are very important for others to follow, but innovators like you are setting an even more important example of a less obvious kind.  You set an example by making it your job to improve your part of the world.  That's the example we would all like to see a lot more people follow.
<P>
And for my part, I would like to see every government manager, every government worker, everywhere, believe that your part of government can be better.  You know it can be.  Believe that you can make it better.  You know you can.  Make it your job to reinvent government.  You know it can be done.
<P>
So please copy the innovations we're honoring tonight and, more important, adopt the spirit of innovation that we're celebrating 
tonight.  You can do what these winners have done.  You can make the world better, as they have done.
<P>
So, in closing, allow me convey to each and every innovator here tonight, my personal congratulations, along with those of President Clinton, and to express the appreciation of our whole country for your work in solving some of our problems, for restoring some of our faith, and for setting an example that can make an innovative leader out of every man and woman who serves this nation.
<P>
Congratulations, and thank you.

<H2>Creativity Fringes<BR>
U.S. Forest Service - Eastern Region</H2>

 <h3> January 19, 1997<BR>
CREATIVITY, GREAT EXPECTATIONS</h3>
</center>

<hr>
Here we are again, awaiting the dawning of a new year.  Along with a new year comes new ideas, new challenges and new goals.  There is a strong pull toward tradition within the Forest Service.  While tradition must be kept alive, we must not be afraid of new ideas and ways to approach future goals.  Now, more so than ever, we have the opportunity to lead the Forest Service across that bridge to the 21st century.
<p>
Regardless of our own views on the merits of organizational change, leaders involved in these efforts deserve some praise for standing up and defending what they believe in. Leadership means taking a stand and pursuing change efforts that the leader believes are right.  It doesn't mean hiding from controversy and forever compromising in fear of being branded a rebel.
<p>
Whether you agree or disagree with the changes that have occurred over the past few years, you have to admire the tenacity and determination of some of our leaders who pursued these efforts.  But as we continue to move our organizations forward, we will need leaders who can demonstrate the kind of vision to take on some of their friends as they fight for these changes.
<p>
In the not too distant past, we were held together by a traditional workplace with formal rules and boundaries; hierarchy; walls, tall walls; policies and authority.  Today, these values are changing and unfortunately many people in our organizations have advanced and reached their positions of "authority" by climbing the traditional hierarchy.
<P>
But in today's world, we need to build relationships and alliances.  We must take advantage of the skills and knowledges of the real work experts, those who do the jobs.  These individuals should have a vital part in defining the work that needs to be done and how it gets done.  This will help people feel energized rather 
than overworked.  Let's involve all people in the fulfillment of their goals and plans.
<P>
Something we all may want to ask ourselves.....how has your work life changed over the past few years?  Is it better?  Has technology made improvements?  Has your work environment changed?  Do you have a voice on the changes?
<P>
The December issue of "Quality Digest" shared eight steps to change from the book "Leading Change" by John P. Kotter.  These steps are.....
<ul>
<li>Establish a sense of urgency:  Examine market and competition realities. Identify crises and opportunities quickly.<br>
<li>Create a guiding coalition:  Emphasize teamwork.<br>
<li>Develop a vision and strategy:  Focus on giving efforts direction and on motivating people.<br>
<li>Communicate the change vision.<br>
<li>Empower broad-based action:  Change those systems or structures that seriously undermine the vision.<br>
<li>Generate short-term wins:  Plan visible performance improvements and recognize the people who achieve them.<br>
<li>Consolidate gains and produce more change:  Use increased credibility to change any systems that don't fit the vision.<br>
<li>Anchor new approaches in the corporate culture:  Ensure that employees recognize the link between customer satisfaction and improved results.<br> </ul>
<br>
<center>
People must know that their ideas will be listened<br> to and, if they have merit, acted upon.  If they do,<br> it is possible to mobilize individual creativity on<br> a very broad scale.<br>

We do not succeed in changing things according to our desire,<br> but gradually our desire changes.  The situation that we hoped<br> to change because it was intolerable becomes unimportant.  We<br> have not managed to surmount the obstacle, as we were absolutely<br> determined to do, but life has taken us around it, led us past<br>
it, and then if we turn around to gaze at the remote past, we can<br> barely catch sight of it, so imperceptible has it become.<br>

<center><b>Guidelines For Managers To Enhance Creativity</b></center> 

The last eight of sixteen suggestions from Simon Ramo to enhance creativity from the "Handbook For Creative and Innovative Managers."
<P>
9.  Whether a company is large or small, innovation is most likely to be successful if proposal ideas are discussed with all entities who will be critical to success, from research lab to factory plant, from inventor to potential customer.
<P>
10. Don't overplan and overformalize in the early stages of the creative process.  Nothing can be more discouraging to someone pregnant with an idea than being pressed to prove what the embryo will turn into when fully developed, especially if the seed idea is then no more than a gleam in the inventor's eye. <P>
11. Do not think of creativity as always connoting breakthroughs, radical inventions, or major reorganizations.  Ingeniously conceived, well-implemented, small deviations from existing products or practices can yield spectacular results.
<P>
12. The right organization to turn small deviations into high payoffs may
differ greatly from one geared to seeking the big, super-valuable discontinuity.
Most companies will find that some sponsoring of each kind of creative effort
is appropriate.
<P>
13. Don't generalize too much about how to encourage and use creative effort. Doing it right depends on the detailed area of endeavor and current circumstances.  If the problems and opportunities are understood and a healthy respect exists for the potential of creative effort in handling them, the best way to employ creativity will virtually suggest itself.
<P>
14. Creative people need not be put on special pedestals, and extreme prima donnas need not be tolerated.  But the company must be prepared to act promptly on ideas coming from those individuals with proved creativity.  If the new idea should not be carried further, the decision should be made quickly.  A truly creative person will usually shift attention to something else.
<P>
15. To encourage creativity, it must be rewarded.  Cash bonuses are excellent but constitute only one dimension of the remuneration process.  Award dinners can be helpful.  The innovative accomplishments of individuals should be well publicized both inside and outside the organization.
<P>
16. A management that is reluctant to engage in special effort to put creativity to work is unlikely to realize productive yields.  Investment in creativity, however, will generate substantial corporate benefit.
<P>
 <center><b>Charting Trends</b></center> 
Decisions, Decisions
<P>
<center>
The next time your boss has a decision to make, suggest he or she flip<br> 
a coin.  A study by an Ohio State University professor has determined that<br> 
managers fail about half the time when they make business decisions about<br> 
their organizations.  A third of the decisions were so bad that the firms never<br>
implemented them.  When researchers figured in decisions that were only partially<br> 
implemented, the failure rate climbed to 50 percent.  The conclusions resulted from<br> 
a study of 163 decisions over 16 years. Professor Paul Nutt found that the most<br> 
successful technique was simply to ask those affected whether the idea would work.<br>  
That tactic had the lowest failure rate, at 30 percent, but was used least....<br>
in only 23 percent of the decisions.<br> <br>
--Chicago Tribune
</center>
<P>
Musical Chairs In The Office
<P>
The private office already may be on the endangered list.  A lot of them have been converted to workstations, those cubicles in which you hear every detail of your neighbor's boring life.  Now, Corporate America isn't even going to assign you a desk.  John Frank of Actoras Consulting Group in Schaumburg, Illinois, which redesigns offices for companies on a custom basis, believes that companies are creating mobile work forces, which don't necessarily need permanent desks of their own.  He has already helped IBM reduce office space by 40 percent nationwide and thinks that the scenario of the future may be so-called productivity centers where mobile staffers can come occasionally to retrieve their mail and sign up for work space on a temporary basis.  Mobile staffing is an ideal way to handle people who do much of their work at home or on the road outside of the office.
<P>
Kill Complacency If You Want Organizational Change <P>
If your organization needs to make dramatic changes, it's got to develop and maintain a sense of urgency.  Repeat:  "urgency," not "hysteria."  Your goal is not to make everyone anxious or bewildered, just to convince them that change is absolutely essential.  And though some argue that drastic change is not possible until an organization's problems drive it to the point of desperation, Harvard management professor John Kotter disagrees, and says you can change an organization even in good times by "relentlessly bombarding employees about problems (a new competitor is showing signs of becoming more aggressive), or potential opportunities (through technology or markets)."  Since an organization without a sense of urgency will never change, you need to create an artificial crisis if you don't have a real one.  Kotter says that Japanese entrepreneur Konosuke Matsushita would always overcome employee smugness over their past achievements by setting some new "stretch" goal (e.g., doubling revenues within four years): "Because Matsushita never pulled the goals out of thin air but instead put careful thought into what stretch objectives would be feasible, his ideas were always defensible"....and always productive of change!
<P>

</h5>
<b>Some thoughts from a few Dreamers.......</b> 
After reading some of the comments from the last couple of issues, I sense the feeling of despair in a lot of the readers.  I understand that there are a lot of places with managers that inhibit creativity, but that is no reason to give up hope or to quit trying to be creative.  I have been accused of being to optimistic at times, but I think that without optimism it is very tough, if not impossible, to be creative.  If you are not constantly aware of the chances for change, when the time comes and you get the chance to do something creative, you won't be ready, mentally or physically, to take advantage of the
situation.  So, keep your spirits up and remember that no matter what your situation currently is, it will change over time.  Take advantage of every opportunity, no matter how small.
<P>
<center>********************</center> <br>
I am primarily responding to some of the last comments.  I too have and am experiencing "Don't rock the boat", the boss knows best, "Business as usual" from some top managers  ---and--- I am seeing and experiencing much more support to be creative, innovative, self directed/team directed support from other top and most middle managers.  I do know and remind myself that I love being creative, that I have always had the opportunity to work/support myself--in and outside the government and I can choose to be "afraid" of loosing my job or trust that I want to be creative and support the creativity of others.  The hardest part is inside myself.  I am most frequently choosing my creative self and feeling better.
<P>

While most "civilians" see the Forest Service embodied in the "Sleepy Ranger District" myth, it turns out that the reality is more like the concept of Social Darwinism.  Many folks who couldn't care less about the Evolution of Species, embrace a strange and ultimately distorted "survival of the fittest" strategy in the workplace.  They see corporate "survival" as a grim series of head-to-head battles with superiors, subordinates, and peers to wrest power and control from others and maintain it at all costs--sort of the alpha-male
model.  While I doubt that alpha-male behavior really has much to do with the survival or prosperity of any species, it's application to social and economic situations is absurd.  Nonetheless, it prevails, wasting precious time and resources on turf battles, dirty office politics, and grandstanding.  The model is so universal that it is most often taken for granted--invisible to
scrutiny:  "It's a JUNGLE out there!"  Until we see the fallacy of this paradigm--that cooperative behavior is one of the great achievements of human history--we, our organization, and perhaps our culture, will stagger under the burden of these wasteful behaviors.

U.S. Forest Service - Eastern Region</H2>

<h3>December 19, 1996<BR>
CREATIVITY,  LOOKING AT THINGS FROM AN UNUSUAL PERSPECTIVE</h3>
</center>

<br>
<hr>
Many of us in the Forest Service are grappling with questions about how best to organize for the 21st century.  Clearly, as we approach the workplace of tomorrow, we will still need strong leadership.  Few of us would doubt the need for leadership in the next century even though many of us are advocating the creation of self-directed/self-managed teams.  One noted college professor from Harvard, John P. Kotter states in his latest book that we shouldn't overlook the need for strong leadership.  In fact, he says that "successful organizations in the 21st century will have to become more like incubators of leadership....people need to be encouraged to attempt to lead, at first on a small scale, both to help the organization adapt to the changing circumstances and to help themselves grow."
<P>
The recent push towards self-managed teams has greatly expanded the opportunities for leadership among different levels of the organization. Decision-making is being driven down to lower levels of the organization.  The hierarchical "top-down" management style so synonymous with the Forest Service tradition is being altered with the flurry of different organizational concepts being replicated on almost every Forest.  With change comes unique opportunities for employees to take responsibility for their own actions, and leadership comes from the teams.
<P>
In the past most of our jobs consisted of following detailed rules and instructions.  But, like the candlemaker who was replaced by the electrician and the blacksmith by the automobile and airplane mechanics, change will create new opportunities.  Now everyone's job has changed from following instructions to optimizing unit costs and increasing the levels of productivity.  Clearly, everyone has the opportunity to make choices, not just management any longer.
<P>
Many of us support these concepts and want to confront these changes.  It gives us the ability to take responsibility for our own actions.  Making this type of contribution and commitment to the Forest Service requires passion, initiative and dedication.  Everyone has the potential and ability to contribute.  It means looking at our jobs not as routine tasks, but as opportunities to contribute, develop and grow.
<P>
This is the dawn of a new era in leadership.  The acceleration of information, organizational change, changing budgets, calls for a different kind of leadership.  Leaders need the ability to persuade and teach.  Leaders can no longer afford to be arbitrary and need to be directly involved with employees in making decisions.  With the pace of communication and change; leaders need to be open and more action oriented.  The top down stuff just won't work any more!
<P>
But a closer look suggests otherwise.  We may never rise to meet this dawn if, as in the past, we overlook a key element.....employees.  In our rush to reinvent, reengineer, restructure, reorganize, downsize, cultural evolution, empowerment......without asking people, we may lose the real opportunity for significant organizational change.
<P>
Responding to this challenge, a number of organizations have committed themselves to align and focus the entire organization on creating solutions that work.  These units recognized the need for collaborative efforts because one of the first things their leaders realized is that they couldn't do it alone.  There just weren't enough ideas or support to get the job done.
<P>

<center>
You can't be the only person who comes up with ideas.<br>
The frustrating part for anyone in business is they<br>
 get to a point where they're thinking that they're<br>
the only person the ideas can come from, because then<br>
that company will stagnate at some point.<br>

To get people to be more creative, you must maintain an<br>
environment that's free of judgement.  It's a balancing<br>  
act.  While you want to consider any idea that comes up,<br> 
some of them may be dumb.  Your task is getting a lot of<br>
good ideas by letting the discussion go on a long time.<br> 
After all, you don't know if the first or the hundredth<br>
idea will prove the big winner.<br>

<center><b>Guidelines For Managers To Enhance Creativity</b></center>
 
The first eight of sixteen suggestions from Simon Ramo to enhance creativity from the "Handbook For Creative and Innovative Managers."
<P>
1.  If overall operating results over a substantial period are poorer than expected or desired, try something different.
<P>
2.  If at first you don't succeed with an idea, do not try it again and again.  Change it.
<P>
3.  If things are working out well, don't alter anything unless you have first asked why the success is 
occurring.  Plan to achieve future success through creative effort based upon understanding how present success was achieved.
<P>
4.  The best way to be confident about anyone's creative strength is to observe a steady record of 
proven-idea generation by that individual.  This means care must be taken to uncover creative effort 
that has worked out well, trace its origins to people responsible for it, and support those employees 
in their future proposals.
<P>
5.  Good communication is needed between a management interested in creativity
and the originators of creative ideas if there is to be useful assessment and employment of creativity.
<P>
6.  The development of a concept from seed to full utilization usually will involve multiple joint actions 
by many.  A group of creative people who communicate their rough ideas to one another will bring forth finished and beneficial innovation far more certainly and rapidly than will a collection of lone contributors.
<P>
7.  Steady mass touting and urging of novel proposals should not be confused
with generating true creativity because too many of the submitted ideas will be harebrained.
<P>
8.  A highly creative individual will make 10 times as many contributions as
one who is only marginally creative.
<P>

Decisions, Decisions
<P>
<ul>
The heyday of corporate counterparts to Captain Queeg, the USS Caine's domineering skipper, may be ending.  In a recent survey, executives predict their companies will move to less autocratic management within 10 years. The survey, by executive recruiter Korn/Ferry finds 61% believe they will shift to consensual management.  So far, this approach is used in only a few large corporations, such as Hewlett-Packard, Xerox, and Motorola. Basically, there's less hierarchy, more sharing of decision-making among
managers, and more responsibility given to workers.  The chief executive's
focus is solely on the big decisions.  Some experts are skeptical that this management style will be embraced quickly.  Warren Bennis, a business professor at the University of Southern California, expresses surprise at the survey results, noting that the consensus method is "not an easy thing to do."  Devotees of consensual management, however, say the increased emphasis on customer service, plus today's far-flung global operations, make corporate power-sharing a necessity.  The big boss can't be everywhere anymore.

Strategic Planning
<P>
<ul>
Now that organizations have spent the last decade streamlining operations to maximize productivity and efficiency, they're looking for more ways to wring profits from the downsized results.  Enter that old standby...strategic planning.  "The pure efficiency approach did very little to generate distinctive competitive advantages," says an industry consultant.  Today's strategic gurus advocate a democratized process rather than the closed door sessions among senior officers that were popular in the past.  Now, strategic planning is carried out by teams of line and staff people from different disciplines, and includes interaction with key customers and suppliers.  Along with new thinking come new buzzwords, of course.....look for more talk of "co-evolution" and "the business ecosystem," creating networks of relationships among customers, suppliers and rivals to gain greater competitive advantage.  In addition, expect to hear more about focusing on "core competencies," using "game theory" to decipher opponents' 

motivations, and discovering "white space opportunities"....potential areas of growth that often fall between the cracks because they don't naturally match the skills of existing business units.
<P>

<br>
Don't Expect The Boss To Lead The Revolution
<P>
<ul>
C.K. Prahalad, University of Michigan management professor in his book "Competing For The Future" co-authored with Gary Hamel, says that almost all traditional views of strategy are elitist and wrong, based on the incorrect assumption that top managers develop strategy and everyone else implements it, whereas in an effective organization strategic change is enabled by the people lower down in the organization, who are closer to new technologies, to customers and to competitors.  "If you think about strategy as revolution, strategy as discovery, strategy as innovation, strategy as changing industry norms and industry patterns, then you must acknowledge that no monarchy has ever fomented its own revolution.  In other words, senior management does not have a great propensity for change."  So how do you get the best ideas of people lower in the organization?  Select a group of 16-20 people with several years' experience in the industry, who have accomplished something, are respected by their peers, and have "a c

ontrary streak," people who think differently; then divide them up into two teams and have them compete with each other on developing a point of view about where their organization is going and how the organization should position itself; then let them make competing presentations to top management, so that management gets two views of the 
future rather than just one.

<b>Some thoughts from a few Dreamers.......</b>

In regards to the numbered suggestions...Reading those made me, well, rather sad.  On my district there is little or no money to be used for training and none for awards.  This is at the BEGINNING of a fiscal year - which does nothing to foster creativity or the spirit of worthiness.  The mindset of the management is that our funding is cut so do away with extras.  This comes in the wake of adding a few hundred thousand dollar addition to our Visitor Center/office building.  Why can money be allocated for an informational building to house exhibits while displacing employees from their offices with no forseeable hope of even adequate office space for all the necessary people, equipment, literature, etc to run this business of a District office.  I feel that our priorities are somewhat set askew.  It is important to foster education of the public, for without their interest there would be little need for many of our programs.  But in this time of dwindling resources, should not the emphasis be on joint use of

 funds - that of the public and internal needs?? Even with all of our displaced office space it is extremely difficult to get some of the managing forces to realize that alternate workplaces can be utilized in a beneficial manner.  Unfortunately it comes down to the "if I cannot see you, I don't trust you to be doing your work" mindset.
<P>
<center>********************</center>
<br>
Have you ever thought about leadership and teams and the comments about "coaching?"  There's much talk about employees assuming more accountability for their actions, yet what does our management conger up, but another buzz word; coaching.  Too me, coaching is synomyous with parenting.  Coaching is sort of cloning of parents; a sort of parent-child relationship.  Think about it.  How do we describe and use the word coaching in the Forest Service.  It's time to break out of this control mentality and let me choose, let me decide, let me create!
<P>
<center>********************</center>
<br>
A case can be made that all this hand-wringing about organizational change is missing the point.  The reality is quite different.  Change of course is very difficult.  But the depressing story I see is that all this change is not necessary and that things just bounce back after a while.  These messages and signals are strong in the Forest Service and the effects are mind-numbing.  The end result is that no real change is fostered on my unit and in fact, I'm constantly observing signals that suggest we not rock the boat.  Your myths about creativity are well and good, but when you hear these messages, there's not much hope.  With continued budget reductions, you ought to face reality and realize how lucky we are to still have jobs with the Forest Service.

<H3>Ten Changes to the Federal Supply Schedule That Make Federal Procurement Easier and Cheaper</H3>
	Federal customers talked, the National Performance Review talked, contractors talked, and the General Services Administration listened. GSA now offers  a new,  improved Federal Supply Schedule. Here are the top ten changes.
<OL>
<LI>	You may now pick a Federal Supply Schedule contractor of  your  choice if your order is under $2,500. GSA has competed everything and determined fair prices.

<LI>	You no longer need to supply a synopsis to the Commerce Business Daily for information technology requirements that are more than $50,000.

<LI>	You can buy off the schedule without a waiver if  schedule contractors cannot meet your needs. 

<LI>	You can select goods and services based on  best value," not lowest price (on or off the schedule).

<LI>  You no longer need to supply justifications/documentation for your purchases to GSA.

<LI>	You can use the schedules for any size order.  Maximum Order Limitations have been removed from 80% of the Federal Supply Schedules.  Maximum Order Limitations will be removed from all schedules by 11/97.

<LI>	GSA strongly encourages you to use Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs).  A new suggested BPA format is available on a new Web site (see address below).

<LI>	Federal Supply Schedule contractors can form "teams" to meet your needs.

<LI>	You can seek and contractors can give "spot reductions" to individual agencies without passing it on to the entire government under a schedule order. You are strongly encouraged to seek reductions when orders are above the new maximum order threshold.

<LI>  Schedule contractors can now expedite delivery.	
</OL>
	For more information check out the new <A HREF="http://pub.fss.gsa.gov/fcoc/sched.htm">Federal Supply Schedule Program Web site </A>at http://pub.fss.gsa.gov/fcoc/sched.htm. Contact <a HREF="mailto:GailL.Hauswirth@gsa.gov">GailL.Hauswirth@gsa.gov </A>or call (703)305-6566. 

<H3>Interagency Benchmarking and Best Practices 
Council Wins Hammer Award</H3>
	A self-initiated, self-managed team of federal employees from five agencies received the Vice President's Hammer Award on December 16 for setting up and guiding the work of the Interagency Benchmarking and Best Practices Council this year. The five charter agencies are Energy, Veterans Affairs,  IRS, Transportation, and the Patent and Trademark Office.
<P>
	The Council, which operates under the auspices of the Department of Energy, works to leverage government benchmarking capabilities, reduce duplication of effort, and develop common definitions and approaches. It sponsored the federal government's first benchmarking conference and set up a web site <A HREF="http://192.26.48.130/fedsbest/index.htm">(http://www.va.gov/fedsbest/index.htm)</A> with the cooperation of the Department of Veterans Affairs. It also established partnerships with the National Performance Review, the International Benchmarking Clearinghouse, the Strategic Planning Institute, Germany's Informationszentrum, and Canada's Innovation and Quality Exchange.
<P>
	The award was presented at a Council member's retirement luncheon--a first for a Hammer presentation. Delores Livingston, with 34 years of federal service, was the Council's guiding pioneer. She thanked Jay Cavanagh, her team leader at Energy,  for giving her the opportunity "not only to fly but to soar in my last year of government service."
<P>
	For more information, contact James J. Cavanagh at <A HREF="mailto:james.cavanagh@hq.doe.gov">james.cavanagh@hq.doe.gov</A> or (202) 586-8257. For information about NPR's Benchmarking Consortium, which expects to publish new studies in early 1997, contact Wilett Bunton at wilett.bunton@npr.gsa.gov or (202)  632-0367.

<H3>Defense Acquisition Deskbook Is Online</H3>
	The Department of Defense put its first automated reference tool for acquisition personnel online. The Defense Acquisition Deskbook is on the Web at <A HREF="http://deskbook.osd.mil/deskbook.html">http://deskbook.osd.mil/deskbook.html</A>. It contains mandatory policy, discretionary practices, and lessons learned. The Deskbook is also a quarterly CD-ROM release, but the Web site allows users to preview new policies and practices and make comments to acquisition leaders. For more information, call (513) 255-0423.

<H3>Deadline for Information Technology Proposals Is January 17</H3>
	The Government Information Technology Services Board and the Interagency Management Council are sponsoring a pilot program to provide seed money for innovative, multi-agency projects. The <A HREF="http://www.npr.gov/library/announc/itcall.html">call for proposals</A> is posted on the NPR Web site at http://www.npr.gov. Click on "Initiatives,"  then "Information Technology."

	<H3 Align=center>FIVE PHILADELPHIA FEDERAL TEAMS HONORED BY VICE PRESIDENT GORE <BR>
	Their Common Sense Innovations Cut Waste, Improve Service With Savings To Taxpayers
</H3>

PHILADELPHIA, PA--The "reinventing government " successes of five Philadelphia-based federal worker teams were cited today (12/16) by the Clinton-Gore administration's reinvention task force, the National Performance Review (NPR).  In ceremonies at Independence Park, each team received Vice President Al Gore's "Hammer Award" for significant innovations resulting in improved government services, less waste, and more savings for taxpayers.
<P>
The actual &#036;6.00 hammer is the Vice President's symbolic answer to the &#036;600.00 hammer of yesterday's government.  It is intended to highlight and encourage "islands of excellence" within the federal government.   
<P>
The awards were presented by Bob Stone, NPR Project Director, who praised the teams for meeting the NPR goals of putting customers first, cutting red tape, and getting back to basics.
<P>
"I'm proud of Philadelphia's federal government reinvention teams," said the Vice President, "for their common sense approach to serving customers.  Their work is an example of excellence.  They are showing that the federal government can reinvent itself." 
<P>
The "Philadelphia Five" include teams from the Health Care Financing Administration, the Internal Revenue Service, a joint Veterans Administration-U.S. Coast Guard team, the General Services Administration, and the Defense Personnel Support Center.  They were nominated for the award by their local Federal Executive Board (FEB), comprised of the top executives of the area's federal agencies.  The FEB represents more than 44,000 employees--the area's largest workforce. 
<P>
	Philadelphia Hammer Award Teams
<UL>
<LI>      	the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) Teleservice Team for development of a prototype "one stop" teleservice unit for its elderly and disabled Medicare beneficiaries who rely heavily on telephone service for assistance and information.  Lessons learned will eventually be applied to HCFA's current patchwork national system. 
<P>
 <LI>	the PATE  (Public Affairs, Taxpayer Education, Electronic Filing) team of the Philadelphia District of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS)  for successfully promoting, marketing and publicizing its new TeleFile system despite severe budget constraints and a shortage of staffing.  Using groups such as Certified Public Accountants, corporate resources, attempting non-traditional methods of communication, the team saved &#036;2.2 million and reached more than 25 million taxpayers. 
<P>
<LI>	the Philadelphia Veterans Affairs Medical Center and the U.S. Coast Guard Training Center at Cape May, NJ for forging an agreement resulting in both easier access to VA medical care for qualified southern New Jersey veterans and in new Optometry, Orthopedic, and Women's Health clinics aboard the Coast Guard base.  Savings of over &#036;1 million--from the cost differential between VA and civilian medical services, and decreased active duty lost time--are anticipated for 1996.
<P>
<LI>    the Regional Office of the General Services Administration's (GSA) National Furniture Center for developing the Packaged Room Program.  This allows the military to order whole rooms of furniture for its barracks and bachelor quarters using one purchase order, one stock number, all provided by one contractor.  Prior to the "Philadelphia way", some items were in federal supply depots, some were bought on the open market, and all had different delivery schedules.  Typically, up to a dozen purchase orders would be issued to seven to ten vendors for each room of furniture needed.  Another   contract was needed for installation.  The new way will save taxpayers &#036;140 million for the five year contract period.
<P>
<LI> the Commercial Initiatives/Electronic Commerce Team from Philadelphia's Defense Personnel Support Center for its providing U.S. military personnel with brand name, high quality garments in a fast, cost effective manner.  They talked to the troops, found out what they really wanted, then--working with suppliers like Jockey and Hanes--developed performance specifications that enables them to buy commercial products.  The old stuff took up to 46 days for delivery.  The new way uses electronic catalogs, etc., and gets it there in hours.

Project proposals for IT innovation funds will not be considered if they provide benefit to only one or a limited number of agencies. Those projects should be funded under the agency's own appropriation or through a collaborative agreement between
agencies.  The Innovation Fund is not meant to offset appropriations or to fund projects where appropriation requests have not been approved.
<P>
Proposals should be sent to Ms. Gayle F. Gordon, Chairperson, Information Technology Innovation Fund Committee at the Department of Interior, 1849 C Street, N.W., MailStop MIB-5312, Washington, D.C. 20240 to arrive by COB January 17, 1997.  The Committee expects to award funding to those projects selected by the end of February, 1997.

INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (IT) INNOVATION FUND PILOT PROGRAM
<P>
Purpose of an Innovation Fund
<P>
In today's budgetary environment, proposals for innovative interagency use of IT are often viewed as low priorities by Agency Heads because of their inherent risk when compared to operation, maintenance, and "modernization" of existing agency systems.  The IT Innovation Fund provides a mechanism to identify and fund crosscutting innovations that will have multi-agency or governmentwide impact.  It operates as the analog of a venture capital firm in the private sector -- allowing agency innovators to
compete for available funding.  Projects funded by this program draw the attention and participation of State and local governments and the IT industry, all of whom can improve service delivery to the public by implementing innovative IT in their respective organizations.
<P>
The objective of the Program is to identify and fund initiatives that present the best value to the government, considering both return on investment and risk.  The proposing agency needs to address
potential improvement of agency, interagency, and intergovernmental operations.  Implementation  costs, demonstrated savings, agency competency, technological feasibility, interagency and intergovernment commitments, and the participation of the IT industry will be carefully weighed.
<P>
Project proposals submitted for consideration are assumed to have the approval of the submitting agency, who may be expected to absorb overhead cost such as office space, and, in many cases, FTE cost for project personnel.
<P>
<H3>Funding</H3>

Funding for the Innovation Fund is from the General Services Administration's (GSA) Information Technology Fund.  In FY 1995, 1 percent of the projected FTS2000 income, or $5.5 M was contributed to the Fund.  In FY 1996, funding was from both GSA's Local Service account and FTS2000.  It is anticipated that in FY
1997 the Fund will contain at least $8M, including carryover finds from FY 1996.  Proposing agencies are encouraged to provide additional or matching funds and are expected to absorb overhead costs such as office space.
<P>
The use of this Fund is to provide "seed" money for innovative projects that provide more efficient and effective delivery of service to the public and/or multiple agencies.  The projects should be self-sustaining by a 2 year time frame and, within the Federal statutory and regulatory authority, provide for reimbursement to the Fund within 2-3 years.  The use of the IT Innovation Fund is not
meant to offset appropriations or to fund projects where appropriation requests have not been approved.
<P>
Selection of projects to be sponsored by the Fund are determined by a joint Committee comprised of representatives of the Government Information Technology Services Board (GITSB) and the
Interagency Management Council (IMC).  Administrative support and program management are provided by GSA.
<P>
The IT Innovation Fund Committee reserves the right to recommend revocation of funds for any projects that experience significant departure from the agreed upon proposal, changes in scope, benefits, repayment plan, or other major factors inhibiting the successful completion of the proposed project.
<P>
In order to be considered, a written proposal (see attached Proposal Format) must be submitted.  Each proposal must meet the following criteria:
<P>
<H3>Scope</H3>
<UL>
<LI>     Proposals must be for information technology, which includes
telecommunications as defined in the Information Technology Management Reform Act of 1996 (ITMRA), section 5002(3),
and be within the scope of the IT Fund established by 40 U.S.C. 757.

<LI>      Proposals should produce information technology capabilities
for all Federal agencies or multiple Federal, State, and local agencies. 
</UL>
<P>
<H3>Benefits</H3>

In order of preference, proposed projects should:
<UL>
<LI>      Provide substantial benefits to the public such as
increased/improved information dissemination, increased/improved timeliness or quality of service delivery, or reduced burden.

<LI>    Provide substantial benefit to multiple agencies or programs
through lower operating costs.
</UL>
<P>
<H3>Repayment</H3>
<UL>
<LI>     Projects should include an estimate of benefits and a proposal
for how to repay the Innovation Fund from those benefits that accrue to the government.
</UL>
<P>
While it is expected that most projects will achieve savings that may be used to repay the Fund, there may be projects that cannot provide repayments but would provide other significant benefits.  These projects will not be excluded from consideration.  However, it is a goal of this Program to create a self-sustaining Innovative Fund and, by necessity, projects that cannot repay will be given a lower rating.
<P>
Each proposal funded through the IT Innovation Fund will be required to submit periodic updates to the Committee so that progress can be monitored.
<P>
Agencies must identify the impact of not funding the proposed projects and whether or not an appropriations request has been made or is being considered for future years.
<P>
For agencies submitting multiple projects, please indicate order of priority.
<P>
Agencies should provide cost breakdowns for all hardware, software, personnel expenses, travel, whether contractor support will be required, etc. For equipment and other items to be procured, indicate the quantity and type.  In addition, agencies should identify all in-kind services and agency contributions to the project for both the long and short term.

<H2>11/06/96: President Clinton Thanks Federal Workers <BR>
       (Excerpt from post Election Speech)</H2>
</CENTER>

I want to thank the employees of the nation's government. They have had to do a remarkable job. We have reduced the size of our government to its smallest point since President (John F.) Kennedy served, and yet they have continued to serve the people better, year in and year out. They had to do it in the face of enormous challenges and outright hatred for momentary periods. They had to live with the horror of Oklahoma City and the difficulties that came along the way. But the people who serve us deserve our thanks, and I thank them.

<H3>REMARKS BY THE PRESIDENT <BR>
AT PRESENTATION OF THE <BR>
MALCOLM BALDRIGE NATIONAL QUALITY AWARDS</H3>
</CENTER>

The Sheraton Washington Hotel<BR>
Washington, D.C.            
<P>


12:35 P.M. EST
<P>

THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  Secretary
Kantor; Mrs. Baldrige; Senator Pressler; Congresswoman Slaughter; Congressman Ramstad; my good friend, Ernie Deavenport, Mary Goode -- let me thank all of you.  And let me say a special word of thanks to Arati Prabhakar, the Director of Standards and Technology for the work that she has done in this Baldrige process.  Thank you, ma'am.  (Applause.)
<P>
And, Senator Pressler, as you leave the United States
Senate after a distinguished career, let me thank you especially for the work you did to pass the telecommunications law, which will help America immeasurably and create hundreds of thousands of these kinds of good jobs in the years ahead.  Thank you, sir.  (Applause.)
<P>
I'd also like to thank the Army Band for doing such a good
job here today.  Thank you very much.  (Applause.)
<P>
You know, when they were playing The National Anthem, which
normally I sing out of tune at the top of my lungs, but my voice has been a little constrained lately -- my approval is at an all-time high when I'm hoarse and can't speak.  (Laughter.)  I couldn't help thinking as I was listening to The National Anthem what America was like when Francis Scott Key wrote that anthem, and what he would think about what we have just seen today -- how proud it would make the people who fought to start this country and who worked to hold it together to see what we have become after 200 years.  And for all of you, I thank you.
<P>
I was listening to all the speakers here and I was put in
mind of the first public speech I ever gave as an elected official -- almost 20 years ago now I was elected attorney general of my home state, and I was invited to the Rotary Club officers installation banquet in Pine Bluff, Arkansas, in January of 1977.  The banquet started at 6:30 p.m.  I was introduced to speak at 10 minutes to 10:00 p.m.  (Laughter.) There were about 500 people there, and all of them but three got to talk and they went home mad.  (Laughter.)
<P>
But it was a wonderful night.  There was entertainment from
the local school groups and, you know, everybody got to talk.  It was like it should have been, it was a community event -- a lot of people talked.  And then this fellow got up to introduce me.  And I was nervous as a cat -- my first speech as an elected official.  And the first words out of his mouth -- just how I feel after hearing them speak -- he said, you know, we could stop here and have had a very nice evening. (Laughter.)  I know he didn't mean it that way.  (Laughter.)  But we could stop right here and have had a wonderful, wonderful ceremony.
<P>
This is the third year I've had the privilege of honoring
the Baldrige Quality Award winners, and every year I feel more strongly that this is the way America ought to work.  This is the way all of our organizations ought to work.  This is the way our families should work, the way our charities should work, the way our religious institutions should work, the way our colleges and universities should work, the way our schools should work, and the way our government should work.
<P>
Recognizing companies that have proved that excellence and
good citizenship are compatible, that understand that business endeavors, like life, are much more a journey than a destination -- it's a very, very special thing for me.  And I hope that my presence here helps to get all of you the recognition you deserve around the country, and hope that it will inspire more and more business people, and more and more people in every organized form of human endeavor in our nation to follow your lead.
<P>
This is an especially meaningful day for me today also
because I used to do this with Secretary Kantor's predecessor, Ron Brown, and last March, we had a ceremony like this at the White House, which was one of the last official duties Ron Brown performed before his untimely death on his mission to the Balkans.  Let me say that he's probably smiling down at us today.
<P>
And let me also say how very grateful I am to my long-term
friend, Mickey Kantor, for his outstanding job as Secretary of Commerce. First he was our Trade Ambassador where he negotiated over 200 agreements -- unprecedented record in the history of American trade -- everything from big agreements like NAFTA and the GATT agreement, over 21 agreements with Japan.  In each of those areas in the aggregate, our exports to Japan have increased 85 percent in those 21 areas.  There is no precedent for it.
<P>
And I was thinking of, as he was up here talking, too much
of what Americans hear about public service is negative from time to time.  Most of the people who work for this department, and most of the people who have worked for your government make America a better place. And Mickey Kantor and the people here at the Department of Commerce are shining examples of that, and I thank them for it.  (Applause.)
<P>
I also want to thank the private sector partners in this
endeavor, the 28 previous winning companies, the examiners, the Baldrige Foundation.  For almost 10 years this award has been remarkably successful as a public-private partnership.  We will have to have more of these in the future if America is to meet the challenges of the 21st century.
<P>
I'm very pleased that there will be new winners in the
categories of nonprofit health and education organizations.  I can tell you that if you look at the percentage of our economy and more important, the stake in our quality of life and our future in health care and education, this is coming not a moment too soon.
<P>
Finally, let me say a special word of appreciation to the
Vice President for the work that he has led in our endeavors to have the federal government do more of what all of you are doing.  Our government has about a quarter of a million fewer people in it than it did the day I became President.  We've abolished hundreds of programs.  We've privatized more operations than ever before.  And we've been able to reduce the deficit by 60 percent and still continue to invest in education, in research and technology and environmental protection, the things that will keep our country strong in the future.
<P>
I'm proud of the fact that, thanks to you and millions like
you, our economy is strong and growing stronger every day.  Today we learned that in November, while there was a small increase in the unemployment rate, wage increases continued to come to American workers because of increasing productivity.  We had 118,000 more jobs, which means in the last three years and 10 months are economy has produced 11.9 million new working opportunities for the American people, something all of you can be very, very proud of.
<P>
Now we have to keep this going.  I'm very much committed to
passing a bipartisan balanced budget plan with the Congress which will keep our interest rates down, keep our economy growing, and continue to honor our commitments to our children, our future, our economy, our parents, and the quality of the environment.
<P>
But whatever we do, we know that ultimately American
progress will rise or fall on the performance of American business and American workers.  Both large and small, American businesses are the engine that will help to carry us into the 21st century.  Two decades ago our companies had little competition from abroad.  Today we know we compete in the world for jobs and markets.  The business community has led the way in sensitizing all Americans that we must measure ourselves by high standards.  We must achieve high global standards.  That is what I seek for the performance of your government, for the performance of our educational institutions, for every single endeavor in the United States.
<P>
ADAC Laboratories' commitment to the customers has resulted
in its phenomenal turnaround.  Just think about tripling your revenues in three years.  Now, if we could do that without a tax increase, there would be no deficit problem.  (Laughter and applause.)
<P>
Let me -- I applaud Dana Commercial Credit Corporation's
commitment to its customers, its employees and its community for the style of management that encourages employees to act on their own ideas and for your financial support of the Toledo School Board.  Now, let me say that Mr. Morcott and I have been friends for a long time, and the Dana Corporation has a different sort of plant in Arkansas, one of the most highly roboticized plants in the United States making truck transmissions.
<P>
One of the things I liked about that place the first time I
ever visited it was that there were no parking spaces dedicated to the big wigs.  So if the plant manager showed up late, he might have to walk a block and a half to work.  (Laughter.)  However, I rejected that suggestion for the State Capitol when I was governor -- (laughter) -- which just goes to show you, we all have work to do.  (Laughter.)
<P>
Custom Research Corporation has proved you don't have to be
the biggest to be the best, 97 percent of a clientele being delighted is something that any organization would be delighted to achieve.
<P>
When I heard them reading the measures of how they define
their success and they talked about the -- talking about all their employee endeavors, and I saw all of the cheers coming from all of you as well as from Trident Precision Manufacturing over there with their banners, again I say, think about the idea that every organization we're involved in ought to work this way.  If we invest in training and education as Trident has.  And one of the things I want to say about them that I especially appreciate that was not mentioned in this era of downsizing, I want to commend you for hiring people who had worked for larger companies and who were downsized.  A lot of people who have been downsized still have outsized contributions to make to the American economy and to American society.  And small businesses are going to have to take up that slack.  I thank you for making that a priority.
<P>
Just think:  satisfied customers; energized employees who
are involved; respect and commitment to the communities in which you're involved in; investing in technology and the future; still making a profit; and at least by the evidence we've seen here, having a good time doing it.  If every family in every organization of any kind in this country worked that way, we wouldn't have very many problems in the United States.  That's the message I want to go across America today, and I thank you for sending it loud and clear every day in your lives. (Applause.)
<P>
Let me finally close by asking one more thing of you.
America needs more strong companies like this and more organizations like this to be prepared for the next century.  I believe with all my heart we are entering an age of greater human possibility than ever.  It means in simple terms to me that in a place like America more children will have a chance to grow up and live out their dreams than ever before.  It means if we do the right things we will grow stronger and more prosperous while helping more people all around the world to do things that we take for granted now but which would fulfill their dreams and their God-given potential in a way that has never been possible before.
<P>
But to do it we have to understand that in times when
things are changing rapidly, we have to be able to open our eyes and open our ears and open our hearts; we have to be able to think anew and act anew; we have to be dedicated to the idea of community, the idea of partnership, the idea that we can each have more personal, individual fulfillment when we work together with other people to help them achieve the same objectives.  That's the only way we can move able-bodied people from welfare to work.  A lot of you are going to have to help with that.
<P>
We passed a law that says that able-bodied people can only
draw welfare so long, but what are they going to do?  Go into the street or go into the work force?  Every state ought to be willing to give those welfare checks to employers as job subsidies to move more people from welfare to work, and every vital company ought to be willing to examine themselves to see what they could do, because we don't have the money, and we shouldn't have these large-scale job programs funded by the government with only welfare workers in them.
<P>
We want to change a whole culture here and move people into
the mainstream of American life.  And that can best be done by a company hiring one or two or three, and then another company doing the same thing until we have a ripple effect all across America, and we don't have a welfare system and an unemployment system anymore, we have a system that deals with people when they're temporarily out of the work force, organizes those who can move into the work force, and helps those who, through no fault of their own, are simply unable to help themselves.  That is an America that would be worthy of the pride, the honor and the support of every single citizen of this country.  We cannot do it unless the private sector is a partner.
<P>
We cannot help our schools to meet the highest standards of
excellence unless those of you who understand the world in which we are living and the one toward which we are moving demand that we have, yes, a lot of local control and more schools that are committed to kind of creative excellence in the way that you are, but we also measure performance by national standards of excellence, and we know that the measurements are good.  Because I believe all children can learn and I am tired of people hiding behind various bureaucratic hedges to avoid measuring up and giving all our children a chance to learn.  You can lead the way, and we need you to do it.  (Applause.)
<P>
We have participated in a celebration of what is best about
America.  You have all thrilled me beyond measure.  I loved seeing all the different things you did.  I had the best seat in the house today. The Secretary and Ernie and I, we didn't have to worry about what we were going to say.  We didn't even have to worry about our constituents the way these folks did -- they were the political leaders here today. (Laughter.)
<P>
I got to spend this whole time looking into your faces.
Those are the looks I want to see on the faces on every American child and you can help us do it.
<P>
Thank you and God bless you.
<P>

	Thank you, Mayor Herron.   I'm very happy to be here, for at least two reasons.  First, because it's always a pleasure to be in the company of people who are making reinvention happen.  And, second, I'm glad to be here in the warmth of Coronado because winter has hit Washington.  Yesterday, I was relaxing out here, and called back to check in with my office.  It was cold.  It was snowing.   I felt so guilty that I hung up my cell phone, got off my surfboard, and went right inside.

	Aside from the warm weather, I'm here to congratulate a group of people who are demonstrating what reinventing government is all about. 
<P>	We're always proud when we can honor a group of people who have found a way to save taxpayers' hard-earned dollars.  We're very pleased when we can thank people for cutting out waste, or for making a system work better for Americans. 
<P>
	And, for me, it's especially rewarding to honor outstanding successes at our military bases.  Before Vice President Gore asked me to head up his reinventing government program, I spent my career at the Pentagon.  
For my first ten years at DOD, my job was to keep base commanders from being able to run their own bases.
<P>
	I was part of the system of checks and balances Secretary McNamara built.  I was an anonymous offensive lineman.  My job was to keep the opponents off my quarterback-- the Secretary of Defense.  He had all the money and rules. Just like in the NFL, you could tell the opponents by the color of their uniforms;  one week, Navy Blue.  The next week, Marine Green.  And so on.
<P>
	I protected him as zealously -- and more effectively than -- the San Diego Chargers protect Stan Humphries.  Don Rumsfeld and Harold Brown never got a dislocated shoulder when I was in the front line.
<P>
	Then, I read Tom Peters' ground-breaking book <I>"In Search of Excellence."</I>   I had the good fortune to hook up with people like General Bill Creech, who was doing some tremendously innovative things with management at the Tactical Air Command.  And, with Admiral Jim Service and Admiral Jack Fetterman right here on Coronado at AirPac headquarters.  And with Admiral Ben Montoya across the bay.  And I learned.  I learned about empowerment, decentralization, and delegating authority.  
<P>
	I gave up that headquarters-control mentality, and instead focused my efforts on getting out of the way of creative commanders like Captain Steuer, Captain Kelly, and Captain Johnson.  I started the Model Installation Program, which delegated decision-making authority to the people who should have it -- the people who have to live with the results of their decisions. 
<P>
	And, what do you know -- it works!  

	People who are on the front lines actually can do a better job of managing their lives and business than someone sitting in an office a few thousand miles away in the Pentagon.  That's certainly the case here.  In fact, Naval Air Station, North Island was one of our first Model Installations.
<P>
	And, that tradition of leadership has continued. These base commanders have taken initiative, and gone the extra mile to work together, with the community, and for the benefit of everyone working on and around these facilities.  Through the rideshare program, they're helping make sure that the military is a good neighbor.  The reality is that all the people working at these facilities here double the population of Coronado Island every day.  Given the traffic conditions and the need to improve air quality in the region, that means that the military can be a big part of the problem, or a major part of the solution.  
<P>
	These commanders have chosen to be part of the solution.  As a result of the rideshare program, the number of vanpools has grown by almost one thousand percent in the last year.  Over 500 people are biking to work.   Five million vehicle miles are being eliminated each year, as more than 260 cars have been taken off the road.  And, the burden on the region's infrastructure, like the Coronado Bridge, is being eased.  
<P>
	These are great accomplishments, and it's why the Vice President asked me to come out here and present this award.  But, there's another reason that makes this award noteworthy.  This whole program has been made possible because of partnerships formed with the City of Coronado, the San Diego Association of Governments, and the Coronado Transportation Management Association.   
<P>
	One of the ideas that Vice President Gore pushes hardest is partnership.  He  believes that the best way to achieve goals in public safety, health, the environment, and other areas is to look at local governments and industry as partners, not as adversaries.  It's a matter of focusing on  results.   If we set the goal and then work jointly to reach it, odds are that we'll get there faster, at less cost, and with a lot less headache.    
<P>
	Not too long ago, the concept of such a partnership was out of the question.  And, the thought of federal and local governments and industry actually working together was really far-fetched.  Why, it was about as likely to happen as .... well, Al Gore doing the "macarena" on national TV. 
<P>
	But, lo and behold, here we are.  The unthinkable is happening.  The partnership is working.
<P>
	The partners in this project are finding a better way.  And, they're helping achieve the basic goals that the Vice President set out when we started our reinvention program: giving Americans a government that works better and costs less.  
<P>
	I've been around enough to know that this type of  change hasn't happened everywhere.  But, it <B>is</B> happening in a lot of places, and it's making a difference.  These partnerships are producing real benefits for the American people.  A program like this one helps the military work with the community, as part of the community.  And, the results are a better quality of life for everyone, whether they work at one of the bases or not.     
<P>
	We're very proud of what you're doing, and you should be, too.   
<P>
	In recognition of what this group accomplished, in a moment, I'll present Vice President Gore's "Hammer Award."   He gives them to people who are breaking the old mold and making government work better and cost less.   Clearly, you all are doing just that.  
<P>

	And, if you find someone who's not with the program, you can use it to hammer some sense into them.  Just kidding.  <B>Of course</B> we don't condone the use of violence in reinventing government.   But, we'll do just about anything else to get results.  And, we're not the only ones saying that we<B> are</B> getting results.  In September, Vice President Gore presented President Clinton with his annual report on reinventing government. 
<P>
	It's called <A HREF="/library/nprrpt/annrpt/vp-rpt96/index.html">"The Best Kept Secrets in Government," </A>because stories about government working better and costing less don't seem to draw too much attention.   If you want to be in on the secrets, you can pick it up at your local bookstore.
	In it, there are stories of people outside of Washington -- front line workers, businesspeople, average citizens, and local leaders -- who see the change, and are talking about it.  They see a government that's becoming more efficient and that works better and costs less.   They see changes like those that this fine group of people have brought here.  
<P>





	So, let me get down to the business of handing out awards to some very deserving people: 
<P>
Mayor Mary Herron,
Dr. D. Elliott Parks, Chairman of the San Diego Association 	of Governments,
Captain Don Steuer, Commanding Officer of North Island 	Naval Air Station,
Captain Ed Kelly, Commanding Officer of the Naval 	Amphibious Base, Coronado,
Captain Tony Heinrich, Vice Commander, Southwest 		Division, NavFac, and
Cindy Radamaker, President of the Board of Directors, 	Coronado Transportation Management Association..
<P>
	And, to everyone who is involved in this effort, whether as an organizer, a walker, a biker, or as a passenger enjoying the ride in the back of a van, congratulations, and thank you.

<H2>The Reinvention Revolution</H2>
<H1>Town Hall Wall</H1>
<font size=+2>A</font>t the <i>Reinvention Revolution: Reports from the Federal Front Lines</i> conference held on March 25-27, 1996, six hundred women and men gathered together representing the 225 reinvention labs set up around the government as part of the National Performance Review.<p>
This was not a traditional conference, with one-way "speechifying."  Instead it emphasized the "bottom-up" nature of successful organizational change.  Much of the three days were devoted to intensive, facilitated discussions among attendees and reinvention leaders from across the federal government.<P>
A Town Hall Wall was constructed to encourage free and unrestrained discussion.  On this 8 foot high, 40 foot long wall, participants posted over 400 comments: ideas, obstacles and barriers, success stories, concerns, advice, and lessons learned.  <P>
The Wall was organized by four themes.  Choose one to begin exploring the comments posted by reinvention revolutionaries:<P><center>

<H2>The Movement Toward Improved Accountability</H2>

Most public managers work in environments that have echoed for years with rising demands for "performance," "accountability," and "results." Whether you work in Denver's economic development agency or Cuyahoga County's welfare office, in Florida's corrections department or the San Francisco office of a federal housing program, you know you must demonstrate real progress toward your agency's goals. 
<P>
And you must prove your results to many audiences. Citizens and elected officials are demanding tangible returns on the dollars they invest. Even within your agency, the scramble for scarce resources forces tough decisions among competing priorities.
<P>
Managers at every level of the intergovernmental system are moving toward improved accountability by managing for results.
<P>

<B>What Does "Managing Government for Results" Mean?</B>
<P>
Based on our review of best practices in federal, state, and local agencies from coast to coast, we've learned that managing for results can be about:
<UL>
<LI>	setting broad goals or outcomes that your customers care about;


<LI>	establishing measures of performance toward those broad goals;
 
<LI>	benchmarking your progress against yourself and against others;
 
<LI>	surveying customers as part of your measurement system to find out if they are satisfied;
 
<LI>	including stakeholders through performance partnerships;

<LI>	asking for funds based on results through performance-based budgeting;

<LI>	allocating resources based on results through performance grants and performance contacts;

<LI>	tying personnel systems to results through performance agreements and pay for performance; 

<LI>	evaluating programs with performance audits;

<LI>	reporting results through report cards, data maps, and other methods; and

<LI>	using results to make continuous improvements that is, to manage.
</UL>
You might say that managing for results is about making government work better and cost less.
<P>
<B>Increasing Accountability in the Federal Government</B>

<P>

	<I>"Major statutes now in their first years of implementation hold substantial promise for creating a more accountable and effective federal government."</I>
<DL>
     <DD>  Charles A. Bowsher
     <DD>  Comptroller General of the United States
</DL>	

<P>	
President Clinton and the Congress are changing the way the federal government works. Recently enacted federal statutes  and similar ones in states throughout the country have become a driving force behind governmentwide changes aimed at letting the public know what government is trying to accomplish with the tax dollars being spent, and then reporting on how well these programs are doing.
<P>
The four major federal statutes designed to improve accountability for results as envisioned by the National Performance Review (NPR) include the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA), the Chief Financial Officers (CFO) Act, the Government Management Reform Act, and the Information Technology Management Reform Act of 1996.
<P>
The <A HREF="/library/misc/s20.html">Government Performance and Results Act of 1993</A> provides the foundation for strengthening agency efforts to use strategic planning and performance 
measurement to improve results. It is transforming how the federal government is managed.

<P>
	<I>"The law simply requires that we chart a course for every endeavor that we take the people's money for, see how well we are progressing, tell the public how well we are doing, stop the things that don't work, and never stop improving the things that we think are worth investing in."</I>
<DL>
     <DD> President William J. Clinton  Statement  At the Bill Signing for the 
     <DD>Government Performance and Results Act 
     <DD>August 3, 1993
 </DL>   
	
GPRA requires federal agencies to prepare (1) strategic plans that define an agency's mission and long-term general goals, 
(2) annual performance plans containing specific targets, and (3) annual reports comparing actual performance to the targets set in the annual performance plans. 
<P>	
Twenty-eight departments and agencies have already begun a test run of GPRA through over 70 pilot projects for annual performance plans and reports; these were begun for FY 1994 in conjunction with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). Full-scale implementation of GPRA will occur for FY 1999.
<P>
The <A HREF="/library/misc/cfo.html">Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990</A> provides for CFO positions in 24 major agencies and requires annual reports on the financial condition of government entities and the status of management controls. Under the CFO Act, selected federal agencies are subject to the same kinds of audited financial reporting that have long been required in the private sector and by state and local governments.
<P>
The <A HREF="/library/misc/s2170.html">Government Management Reform Act of 1994 </A>expands the CFO Act requirements for an agencywide audited financial statement to all 24 CFO agencies. Audited financial statements for FY 1996 are to be completed by March 1, 1997, and include performance measurement information and discussions of progress toward established goals and objectives. For FY 1997, the Secretary of the Treasury and the Director of OMB are to coordinate the development of a consolidated governmentwide financial statement; the Comptroller General is to audit this statement.
<P>
The <B>Information Technology Management Reform Act of 1996  </B>requires, among other provisions, that agencies set goals, measure performance, and report on progress in improving the efficiency and effectiveness of operations through the use of information technology.
<P>	
This guide is intended to complement, not substitute for, these federal statutes, accompanying congressional reports, and guidance from OMB. OMB, for example, is helping federal agencies implement GPRA through <I>OMB Circular A-11, A Primer on Performance Measurement,</I> and other publications identified in this resource guide. These are important tools that federal readers should be sure to obtain and use, and that state and local readers may also find of use as well.
<P>

<H2>Increasing Accountability
Throughout the Country</H2>

While management reform continues in federal agencies, states, counties, cities, and nongovernmental service providers are also changing how they do business. Over the past decade, state -- and especially local -- governments have been pace setters in results-oriented management. This resource guide will lead you to information about many of them.  
<P>
Visit, for example, Florida's Web site set up by the Commission on Government Accountability to the People to learn about <I>Florida's Benchmarks Report</I> or about that state's<I> 1994 Government Performance and Accountability Act </I>which ties achievement of results to more flexibility in appropriations through performance-based program budgeting. Or visit Louisiana's Web site to see how that state is integrating performance accountability into its budget process. See <I>Texas' Guide to Performance Measurement</I> for a how-to instruction book that identifies the steps in that state's performance measurement process. Many other state and local Web sites and publications are described throughout this guide, as are compilations of case studies, such as those recently completed by the American Society for Public Administration. 
<P>
Federal agencies are working with their state and local partners in an array of cross-cutting government efforts to focus on results, establish performance partnerships, and measure progress. All of these intergovernmental partners are learning a great deal.  Publications found throughout this guide describe some of these partnerships and the lessons learned from them. See, for example, the Public Innovator, a newsletter published by the Alliance for Redesigning Government, for many articles in this area.
<P>

<H2>About This Resource Guide</H2>

NPR's intention in preparing this guide was neither to create something new nor to duplicate other efforts. Rather, we sought to compile and summarize existing resources and share that information as widely as possible. We have crafted this resource guide to help you find the information you need to manage government for results whether you're just beginning or are well along the way to a strong accountability system. 
<P>
Given the volume of information on everything from defining an agency's mission to strategic planning and performance-based budgeting, it would be impossible to provide a comprehensive catalog of all available resources. Instead, <B>Reaching Public Goals</B> is designed to point you in the right direction for obtaining how-to guides, step-by-step instructions, lessons learned, and helpful tips from other public managers.
<UL>
<LI>	We've included a section on the growing number of Internet-based information sources. These offer one of the best ways to stay up to date on public management strategies and successes.

<LI>	We provide an annotated list of selected publications, including guides; case studies; indices and reviews; federal, state, and local documents; other bibliographies and general references; and other useful materials. This section is divided into three parts: publications by organization, other publications and resources, and periodicals.

<LI>	We have identified organizations that can help you do this work as you move ahead.
</UL>
The Web sites and publications sections are annotated with key words to help you locate information on specific topics.

<P>


In general, the resources in this guide are aimed at those of you who are familiar with the fundamentals of results-oriented management, but are looking for help at a particular phase of the process. If you are <B>deciding what to measure,</B> you can look at specific examples of performance measures being used within federal, state, or local organizations across a wide range of issue areas; or at publications listing criteria for good performance indicators, such as Louisiana's <I>Manageware: A Practical Guide to Managing for Results.  </I>
<P>
If you have already developed performance measures and are looking for information on <B>how others have prioritized their measures,</B> you might want to focus on what Oregon terms its "urgent" performance measures or what Canada's Alberta province calls its "watch list."
<P>
If you are interested specifically in <B>measures of customer satisfaction,</B> see the NPR publications or visit the Web sites of the President's Vanguard Customer Service Agencies.
<P>
If you are beginning to <B>tie measures to your budget process,</B> you might look at The Alliance for Redesigning Government's <I>Deciding for Investment: Getting Returns on Tax Dollars,</I> Southern Growth Policies Board's Guide to <I>Public Sector Strategic Planning and Performance Measurement,</I> or Louisiana's Web site, among other resources found in this guide. 
<P>
If you are interested in <B>performance audits,</B> see the International City/County Management Association's <I>Performance Auditing for Local Government</I> or Arizona's <I>Program Authorization Review: 1997 Legislative Session Self-Assessment Guidelines.</I>
<P>
This guide is intended for use by all levels of government so that we can learn from each other. If you focus on <B>local government,</B> you might want to look at a recent report from the Pennsylvania Economy League,<I> Performance Measurement of Municipal Services: How Are America's Cities Measuring Up?,</I> which examines performance measurement and management systems in 16 cities. Or see the CD-ROM and various publications available from the International City/County Management Association, the Urban Institute, and others.  
<P>
To focus on the state level, there are numerous publications and Web sites from specific states as well as publications that highlight groups of states, such as those by the Southern Growth Policies Board, Financial World, and the Harvard Family Research Project, among others.  
<P>
For federal examples, you might visit the Web sites of selected agencies; look at agency-specific publications listed in this guide; or review some of the federal case studies compiled by the American Society for Public Administration, the U.S. General Accounting Office (GAO), and others.  GAO's<I> Executive Guide: Effectively Implementing the Government Performance and Results Act,</I> for example, will tell you how the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is using GPRA to increase forecast accuracy and warning times for severe weather.
<P>
If you're looking for <B>training opportunities,</B> you'll find some references throughout this document, but your first stop should be your own agency, department, or office. We discovered a number of training services that were being provided by federal, state, and local governments. 
<P>
Of course, there are also an unlimited number of nongovernmental training and consulting providers available to choose from. You can find out about many of these providers by contacting your counterparts at the federal, state or local level who have utilized such services.

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Benchmarking</H1>


Benchmarking is the process of continuously comparing and measuring against other organizations anywhere in the world to gain information on philosophies, policies, practices, and measures that will help your organization improve its performance.  It is not industrial tourism, instead it is a systematic study that facilitates quality improvement.  Benchmarking can be done one-on-one or in groups.  As part of the National Performance Review's Federal Benchmarking Consortium, federal agencies are working together to benchmark against world class private companies and high-performing government agencies. <P>

At President Clinton's direction, government regulators are relying more on

At the forefront of reinvention are 250 national Reinvention Laboratories - federal 
government organizations and activities across the United States that have
volunteered and been recognized to lead the transformation of government
 into the next century.  Reinvention Laboratories test radical new ways of
doing the governments business, and then share their ideas, successes, 
and lessons across government. <P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Fixing the Federal Workplace</H1><P>

This page is for federal workers.  Here's what Vice President Gore said to you in an August 1994 speech - and in many speeches since then.<P>
<CENTER>
<TABLE>
<TR> <TD><I>"If you're a front-line worker, challenge the system.  Think about entirely new and<BR>
 better ways to serve your customers.  Find out how the best in business accomplish<BR>
(their work)......If you are a manager, if you are a boss, we need you on the reinvention<BR>
 team.  Give your employees what they need to serve their customers better.  That's<BR>
 mainly encouragement and freedom... Grant freedom where you have the authority and<BR>
  push for more freedom up the line from your bosses... If you're a policy maker at <BR>
headquarters, make it your policy to put customers first.  Cut red tape, empower workers."</I><P></TD></TR>

To transform our organizational culture, you need tools.  Go to <A HREF="/library/news/common.html"> Common Sense Tools</A> and help us develop the resources to get the job done.

The National Performance Reviews September 7, 1993 report, 
>From Red Tape to Results, contained 384 major 
recommendations.  Of these, 254 were directed to major 
government agencies  and 130 were directed to reforming 
governmentwide management systems such as budget, 
procurement, financial management, and personnel. Separate 
accompanying reports detail the background for these 
recommendations and breaks them into about 1,250 specific 
action items.  NPRs 1995 report, Common Sense Government, 
added over 180 new recommendations.
<p>
NPR has tracked the implementation of these specific action 
items by asking agencies to report on their progress every 
six months.  NPR summarizes the highlights for the Vice-
President each Spring and publishes a summary in a report to 
the President each Fall.  NPR also provides the full text of 
all the status updates provided by the agencies to the 
General Accounting Office which periodically reviews the 
accuracy of agencies self-reported progress.  The GAOs 
assessment of progress in implementation has been published 
in two major studies, Management Reform: Implementation of 
the National Performance Reviews Recommendations, 12/5/94, 
(GAO/OCG-95-1) and Management Reform:  Completion Status of 
Agency Actions Under the National Performance Review, 
6/12/96, (GAO/GGD-96-94).
<p>
<strong>Users Guide</strong>
<p>
The status reported in this version of the database is based 
on reports from the implementing agencies provided in July 
1996.  Some of the initiatives have been updated to reflect 
legislative activity through August 1996.  The narratives 
are written largely in abbreviated technical language; the 
associated accompanying report should provide additional 
context for understanding the status narrative.
<p>
Please note that the existence of a bill pending in Congress 
containing an NPR initiative does not necessarily mean that 
the administration supports all provisions of that bill.
<p>
The status report for each initiative begins with an alpha-
numeric identifier (e.g., USDA01.01) and a brief description 
of the action.  This is followed by a status code and a 
narrative providing additional information regarding the 
status.
<p>
The status codes are as follows:
<p><pre>
1  - No action yet.
2  - Plan not yet established
3  - No further action expected
4  - On hold
5  - Not making expected progress
6  - Making expected progress
7  - Ahead of schedule
8  - Substantially completed, further action not expected
9  - Completed
10 - In progress, but no schedule established
95 - not applicable to agency
96 - Overtaken by events, no further action expected
</pre>
<p>
For a fuller description of the individual initiatives, 
please refer to the associated accompanying report.  By mid-
October, there will be hyper-text links between the 
accompanying reports and the status updates.

<H2 Align=CENTER>Reinvention Highlights</H2>
Your government is changing dramatically so that it makes sense and serves you better. Here's what the Clinton-Gore Administration is doing to deliver on promises made three years ago:<P>

<H2>"THE ERA OF BIG GOVERNMENT IS OVER"</H2>
<UL> 	
<LI>	Government has reduced its workforce by nearly 240,000 as of January 1996. Thirteen of the 14 departments have reduced the size of their workforce; the Justice Department grew because of the Administration's fight against crime and drugs.
	<LI>	We've cut government the right way by eliminating what you don't need bloated headquarters, layers of managers, outdated field offices, and ridiculous red tape and rules.
	<LI>	We've saved and improved the parts you want Social Security, our National Park system, and other agencies that protect you and your family.
	<LI>	We're closing nearly 2,000 obsolete field offices and have already eliminated nearly 200 programs and agencies, like the Tea-Tasters Board, the Bureau of Mines, and wool and mohair subsidies.
</UL>
<HR>
<P>

<H2>WE'RE RADICALLY CHANGING GOVERNMENT</H2>
Inside the federal government, radical changes are taking place to make it work better and cost nearly &#036;118 billion less than it used to:
<UL>
 	<LI>	Government workers can now buy &#036;4 staplers because we've cut out the red tape that ran the cost up to &#036;54 in the past.
	<LI>	We've negotiated better deals for services that the government uses a lot and saved a lot of money in the process, like &#036;3.62 for a three-pound FedEx delivery instead of &#036;27. And as little as 2 cents a minute for long-distance calls instead of 16 cents a minute.
	<LI>	Government workers are seeing much less of the illogical and bizarre rules and regulations:
  	 	
               <UL>
                  <LI>One-third of the federal workforce used to write rules for and micromanage the other two-thirds. We're getting rid of many of those jobs and are convincing agencies to trust their workers to use their common sense.
	 	<LI>We're cutting out superfluous layers of managers. We've eliminated nearly 54,000 supervisors and a few layers.
	 	<LI>In some cases, the Defense Department used to spend more on getting approval for employees to travel than it did on the travel itself. Now they're testing new automated systems that make sense and will save over &#036;100 million a year.
                    </UL>
 	<LI>	With new tools like the Line Item Veto and the ability to pursue people who are seriously delinquent in their debts to the federal government, we'll be able to do a better job of safeguarding taxpayer dollars.
</UL>
<HR>
<H2>WE'RE SERVING PEOPLE BETTER</H2>
President Clinton told federal agencies to make customer service to the public equal to the best in business. Over 200 agencies have committed to meeting more than 3,000 standards.
<UL>
 	<LI>	The Social Security Administration stunned the business world last year by coming in first in an independent survey on the country's best 1-800 telephone service.
	<LI>	We're changing the Blue Pages in the phone book so if you want a passport, you will look up "passport," without having to know you get it from the State Department.
	<LI>	Agencies are working together to provide unique services for you:
	<LI>	Veterans in New York can access Social Security and Veterans Services with one-stop service;
	<LI>	You can go to the "Trading Posts" that the Bureau of Land Management and the Forest Service have set up to get maps, fishing information, and guide permits all in one place and at times that are convenient to you.
	<LI>	In Houston, small business owners can go to the U.S. General Store to get information from federal, state, and local governments and even apply for loans.
	<LI>	Or just stay home and do government business on the Internet. You can do everything from signing on to the U.S. Business Advisor to get answers to questions, to downloading IRS forms, or filling out a Small Business Administration loan form.
</UL>
<HR>
<H2>WE'RE CHANGING THE WAY WE TREAT BUSINESSES</H2>
President Clinton and Vice President Gore told government regulators to cut obsolete regulations and to start acting like partners. Agencies are eliminating 16,000 pages of regulations and dramatically simplifying another 31,000.
<UL>
 	<LI>	We're doing it the right way -- rewarding companies that cooperate with us. But for those companies that don't work with us to ensure the public's safety and protect our environment, we will apply every penalty and sanction that the law allows.
	<LI>	The Health Care Finance Administration eliminated the Physician Attestation Form. This ended the filing of 11 million forms each year and saved doctors 200,000 hours of time.
	<LI>	The Department of Agriculture dropped three million pages of government forms.
	<LI>	We're slashing the regulatory and administrative burden of government on citizens and businesses by nearly &#036;28 billion a year.
</UL>
<HR>
<H2>WE'RE CHANGING THE WAY WE WORK WITH COMMUNITIES</H2>
We're letting states try new ways to reform health care and welfare so they can see what works best by focusing on results, not red tape. President Clinton and Vice President Gore have:
 	<LI>	Created more than 100 federal-local partnerships to focus on the needs of individual communities. These partnerships allow community residents to implement plans to solve what they -- not Washington -- see as their biggest problems.
	<LI>	Approved welfare demonstration projects in more than 40 states in the three years before President Clinton signed the welfare reform bill.
	<LI>	Approved 13 comprehensive Medicaid reform demonstrations in partnerships with states to expand coverage to 2.2 million low-income uninsured Americans.
	<LI>	Signed agreements with two states -- Connecticut and Oregon -- to pilot new ways of doing business with less burden, and dramatically streamlined planning and other processes in a range of programs in other states.

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Where Do We Go From Here</H2>

The point of this short book is just to show you that we "get it" President Clinton and I understand what's wrong with how the government has been doing things and we are turning things around. The battle against the old forces of big government, central control, and mistrust isn't won yet, but everything is moving in the right direction. And, we have a plan to continue the changes.<P>

First, we are turning some of today's agencies into smaller, sleeker organizations that won't look like government at all. They will be like private companies, with a real CEO on contract to cut costs, and a free hand when it comes to the remaining government rules about procurement, personnel, and the like. The British government did this a few years ago, and costs have been dropping steadily. We'll borrow their good idea.
On customer service, we'll stick our necks out even further. The top boss of every agency that touches millions of Americans like the IRS and VA and Customs is on the line to make dramatic improvements in service this year. <P>

Regulatory agencies are on orders to make partnership with businesses their standard way of operating. We have tested it long enough to know it increases compliance with the laws of the land. After all, compliance is what we're after not meaningless hassles. Now we can move beyond pilot programs for partnership into the mainstream.
The same goes for federal grants to state and local governments. No more having to follow the federal rule books to receive federal funds. We will focus on results and consider replacing many grant programs with performance-based partnerships. And to dispel the last vestiges of nameless, faceless bureaucracy, we will give each of our community partners a single, live federal employee, complete with name and face, who will help them with any and all business in Washington, regardless of which agency's turf it is.<P>

Finally, we are going to do better by our workforce. Any Fortune 500 company would be lucky to have a workforce like the federal government's. We need to invest in it: better tools and training, closer partnership between labor and management, more opportunities and challenges for our senior executives.<P>

All of the progress we have made, and all of our plans for the future are focused on one goal restoring the American people's faith in their own system of self-government the people's belief that we can solve our national problems by working together through the institutions of self-government. Faith in government is at a low point, and that lack of faith threatens the nation's future. Government can't do everything, and it certainly shouldn't try. But some national problems like drugs, violence, poverty, and pollution can be solved only by Americans working together through our system of self-government. If we lose faith in that, we abandon the future to chaos.
Reinvention restores our faith. Americans find government service improving over the counter and over the phone. Business leaders find federal regulators ready to use common sense and to look for common ground. Communities find the walls coming down between agencies and levels of government, and beyond the old walls they find partners ready to do whatever it takes to solve problems. Reinvention is securing the future of self-government in America.<P>

So, if you see government changing, don't keep it a secret. Tell your friends, your business associates, your neighbors. Tell them government can do things right. I'm the first to admit that government isn't the answer to all our problems. But when government has to be part of the solution, more and more, we Americans can count on getting results.

<TITLE>Details of National Performance Review Savings to Date</TITLE>

<H1>Details of National Performance Review<BR>
 Savings to Date</H1>
</CENTER>
<p>     
     <a href="/library/nprrpt/annrpt/vp-rpt96/appendix/sum.html">Appendix C</a> 
     of the 1996 status report, <a href="/library/nprrpt/annrpt/vp-rpt96/index.html">
     The Best Kept Secrets in Government</a>, summarizes the explanation of how 
     NPR's savings to date have been calculated. This information includes the 
     original estimate for savings for each year over a five-year period and the 
     savings achieved as a result of the implementation of the recommendation. 
<P>     
     The savings details for recommendations to individual agencies are 
     organized agency-by-agency and recommendation-by-recommendation in the 
     following four documents:
<P>
<OL>
<LI><a href="/library/papers/bkgrd/1993sav.html">1993 Agency Savings Achieved.</a>  
     Status of savings achieved as a result of recommendations contained in 
     NPR's original 1993 report, <a href="/library/nprrpt/annrpt/redtpe93/index.html">
     From Red Tape to Results</a>, Appendix A (<a 
     href="/library/nprrpt/annrpt/redtpe93/2266.html">Part I</a>
     and <a href="/library/nprrpt/annrpt/redtpe93/22f2.html">Part II</a>).
<P>     
<LI><a href="/library/papers/bkgrd/1993pen.html">1993 Agency Savings Pending in Legislation.</a>  Status of 
     savings currently pending in legislation as a result of 
     recommendations contained in NPR's original 1993 report.  
<P>     
<LI><a href="/library/papers/bkgrd/1995sav.html">1995 Agency Savings Achieved.</a>  
     Status of savings achieved as a result of recommendations contained in NPR's 
     1995 report, <a href="/library/nprrpt/annrpt/comsen95/index.html">Common 
     Sense Government</a>, <a href="/library/nprrpt/annrpt/comsen95/22aa.html">
     Appendix C.</a>
<P>     
<LI><a href="/library/papers/bkgrd/1995pen.html">1995 Agency Savings Pending in Legislation.</a>  Status of 
     savings currently pending in legislation as a result of 
     recommendations contained in NPR's 1995 report. 
</OL>
<p>     
     The achieved savings may differ from the original estimates because of 
     timing shifts in implementation (either faster or slower), changes to 
     the original proposal by Congress, or the approach used by the 
     agencies to implement the recommendation.  In some cases, savings are 
     a result of partial implementation.  In other cases, actual savings exceed 
     original estimates.
<P>     
     Savings are calculated based on the current services baseline 
     approach. They include mandatory as well as discretionary savings and 
     revenue increases.  Savings cover two five-year periods.  The 1993 
     report recommends savings for the period FY 1995 through FY 1999. Some 
     recommendations contain savings from FY 1994.  The 
     1995 report recommends savings for the period FY 1996 through FY 2000.

<P><I>Putting people first means ensuring that the Federal Government provides the highest quality service possible to the American people. Public officials must embark upon a revolution within the Federal Government to change the way it does business. This will require continual reform of the executive branchs management practices and operations to provide service to the public that matches or exceeds the best service available in the private sector.</I><BR>

<P><I>President Bill Clinton</I><BR>

<P>
<P>
<P><B>MESSAGE FROM THE DIRECTOR</B><BR>

<P>Each year the President's Quality Award (PQA) Program recognizes Federal organizations that have improved their overall performance and demonstrated a sustained trend in providing high quality products and services to customers. The highest recognitionthe Presidential Award for Qualityis the Federal Governments equivalent of the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award and recognizes organizations that have accomplished outstanding performance results through continuous improvement.<BR>

<P>The 1997 PQA Program Application and Information Package incorporates major Government-wide management improvement initiatives: the National Performance Review, the Government Performance and Results Act, the Chief Financial Officer Act and initiatives concerning customer service standards and information technology management systems and planning. Specific changes in this years package reflect closer alignment of the Award Criteria to those of the Baldrige Award.<BR>

<P>The programs Award Criteria are based on core values and operating standards found among the highest performing public and private sector organizations in the industrialized world today. Through use of the Criteria, an organization can establish an integrated management improvement process for accomplishing commonly shared goals and measuring progress and results in attaining those goals.<BR>

<P>I encourage agencies to apply to the President's Quality Award Program and to use the Award Criteria to continuously improve.<BR>

<P><B>MESSAGE TO FEDERAL EXECUTIVES</B><BR>

<P>This Message to Federal Executives provides basic information on the Presidents Quality Award Program and on the factors that might affect your decision to apply for one of the awards.<BR>

<P>The underlying principles and Award Criteria for the awards are based on the core values found among the highest-performing organizations in the industrialized world today. These principles and Award Criteria have for some time been used to recognize outstanding organizations in the private sector by the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award. They are equally applicable to organizations in the public sector. The President's Quality Award Program Award Criteria are based on the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award Criteria with modifications reflecting the unique aspects of federal government organizations.<BR>

<P>In June, 1995, at the Ninth Annual National Conference on Federal Quality, Vice President Al Gore was present to recognize the award winning organizations.  In his presentation, he emphasized that the principles embodied in the Presidents Quality Award Program are the same as those pursued by the Administrations efforts to Reinvent Government and of the National Performance Review.  In his remarks, he stated that these efforts are designed to bring the government to a stage of first class accomplishment, to a time when the statement Good enough for government work will convey a sense of high purpose and world class performance.<BR>

<P><B>The Award Program and the Award Assessment</B><BR>
- The Award Program recognizes organizations for operational performance excellence and improvement through two awards: the Presidential Award for Quality and the Quality Improvement Prototype (QIP) Award.  Both are awarded to federal organizations on an annual basis.  Award recipients need to demonstrate results and improvement in a wide range of indicators: customer-related, operational and financial. Results reported need to address all stakeholderscustomers, employees, suppliers, partners, special interest groups, Congress and the public.<BR>
-  The award assessment is tailored to your organization through a focus on factors important to your organization and strategy.  These factors are spelled out by you in your Organization Overview and in the Strategic Planning Category.<BR>
-  Your organization's participation as an applicant, as well as information you submit about your organization, are considered confidential.  Assignment of Examiners to your application is made in accord with the Award Programs strict rules regarding confidentiality and conflict of interest.<BR>
-  You will receive a detailed feedback report, highlighting your organization's strengths and areas for improvement, relative to the Award Criteria.<BR>

<P>
<P><B>The Award Criteria</B><BR>

<P>-  The Criterias seven categories and 24 Items focus on requirements that all organizations need to understand thoroughly if they are to function at the highest level.   The Criteria address all aspects of high-performance in an integrated and balanced way.  This includes improvement of: customer and mission-related performance, productivity in the use of all resources, speed and flexibility, product and service quality, cost effectiveness, and overall financial performance.<BR>
-  The Criteria address key operating processes and results and are designed for diagnosis and feedback.  All Criteria directly relate to improving organization performance; nothing is included merely for purposes of an award.<BR>
-  The Criteria do not call for specific practices or organizational structures, because there are many possible approaches.  The best choices depend upon many factors, including your organization's type, size, strategy, and stage of development.<BR>

<P><B>Benefits of Participation</B><BR>
Over the past 8 years, there have been 6 winners of the Presidential Award for Quality and 21 QIP Award winners. There have been hundreds of applicants.  Applicants and winners consistently report numerous benefits that far outweigh the direct benefits of winning.  They stress that the process of applying is an investment to see where the organization stacks up against the Award Criteria and provides an opportunity to improve.  Some commonly cited benefits are:<BR>
-  Responding to the Award Criteria forces a realistic self-assessment from an external point of view.  This disciplined self-assessment, when combined with the comprehensive feedback report received from the Examiners and Judges, provides learning and insights on improvement opportunities, and targets key gaps and priorities for improvement.  This in turn helps accelerate the pace of performance improvement. <BR>
-  The knowledge gained from assessment and feedback teaches new and better ways to work with partners, customers and suppliers to accomplish mission success, program goals and objectives.<BR>
-  Use of the Award Criteria in assessment leads to the integration and alignment of numerous activities that may be loosely connected.  The assessment process is an effective means to focus everyone in the organization to a commonly-shared set of goals and objectives, and to measure progress in attaining those goals.<BR>
-  The Award Program provides an excellent mechanism to recognize the heroes within the federal government who have made dramatic improvements to their agencies performance, and who have successfully dealt with the challenges facing those who lead in the current environment of declining budgets, restructuring and downsizing, and changing missions.<BR>
- Use of the Award Criteria helps organizations understand, select and integrate appropriate management tools, such as performance-based budgeting, quality management, reengineering, performance measurement, and benchmarking.<BR>
-  The Award Criteria and Scoring System provide a clear perspective on the distinction between typical performance and world-class performance.<BR>
-  The Award Program offers participants a unique opportunity to share their own successes and to benefit from the experiences of other high-performing organizations.  The Award process provides a common set of definitions, concepts and language to facilitate communication and comparisons among private, federal, state and local government organizations. <BR>

<P><B>Expectations of Award Winners</B><BR>
Award winners are expected to share nonsensitive and unclassified information with other organizations and promote quality improvement awareness throughout the federal government.  This is done through activities such as developing written and video summaries of the organization's management system, presenting at conferences, and hosting site visits. Award recipients serve as government models of excellence.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P><B>I.  OVERVIEW AND INTRODUCTION</B><BR>

<P><B>Background</B><BR>
The President's Quality Award Program is administered by the Office of Personnel Management.  The Program was created in 1988 and includes two awards: The Presidential Award for Quality and the Quality Improvement Prototype (QIP) Award.  Both are awarded on an annual basis to federal organizations. In addition, organizations may be recognized for their accomplishments in quality management and improvement through special achievement awards.    <BR>

<P>The Award Criteria are closely aligned with the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award Criteria, with several modifications to reflect the federal environment.   This close alignment is designed to foster cooperation and exchange of information between public and private sector organizations.   The Award Criteria are updated on an annual basis to reflect the best approaches within the private and public sectors to systematically improve performance. The Award Criteria are used extensively throughout the federal sector as a proven framework to guide customer-focused performance improvement efforts.  <BR>

<P><B>The Awards</B><BR>
The President's Quality Award Program is designed to recognize organizations which have documented high-performance management systems and approaches consistent with the Award Criteria.  Applicants document, in accordance with the Criteria, their management system and results.  The application information and data must be adequate to demonstrate that the applicants approaches are systematic, deployed to effectively yield high performance levels and meaningful results.<BR>

<P>Winners of the QIP Award have successfully deployed these approaches throughout most of the organization, and can demonstrate meaningful improvements in performance.  Winners of the Presidential Award for Quality also demonstrate approaches to delivering quality products and services to customers consistent with the Award Criteria.  In comparison to the QIP Award, Presidential Award winners demonstrate a high degree and consistent level of deployment of quality approaches throughout the organization, and are able to demonstrate high levels and sustained improvement in performance in virtually all parts of the organization over several years.  Thus, both awards recognize the same approaches to achieving and sustaining performance excellence.  The Presidential Award is reserved for those applicants which have demonstrated a significantly more mature development of performance excellence and have documented world-class results.<BR>

<P>Applicants for both awards must be part of the Executive Branch of the federal government and have at least 100 federal employees. The QIP Award may be given to as many as six organizations each year.  The Presidential  Award may be given to as many as two organizations each year.<BR>

<P><B>Purpose</B><BR>
The President's Quality Award Program is intended to:<BR>
-  recognize federal government organizations that have improved their overall   performance and capabilities and demonstrated a sustained trend in providing high quality products and services, resulting in effective use of taxpayer dollars;<BR>
-  promote sharing of the best management techniques, strategies and results-oriented performance practices among all federal government agencies, as well as with state and local governments and the private sector; <BR>
-  provide models for other organizations to assess their overall performance in delivering continuous value to customers; and<BR>
-  provide a systematic, disciplined approach to deal with the dynamics of change by providing a working tool (framework) for conducting assessments, analysis, training and performance improvement planning.<BR>

<P>
<P><B>II.  APPLICATION INFORMATION AND GUIDANCE </B><BR>

<P><B>General Eligibility</B><BR>
An applicant must meet the following conditions:<BR>
  be a part of the Executive Branch of the federal government;<BR>
  have no fewer than 100 full-time federal employees; <BR>
  be autonomous, with its own defined mission; and<BR>
  provide products or services to customers outside its own agency or be an administrative or support organization for a cabinet department or executive branch agency(as indicated in the Agency Limitations subsection, paragraph 2, found below).<BR>

<P><B>Future Eligibility of Award Recipients</B><BR>
  An organization and any of its sub-components may not compete in the President's Quality Award Program during the same year.<BR>
  Winners and their sub-components are ineligible to compete for the <I>same</I> award for four subsequent years. For example, U.S. Army Research, Development and Engineering Center, the 1995 winner of the Presidential Award, and all of its sub-components may not compete again for the Presidential Award until 2000.  Further, if a QIP Award recipient or any of its sub-components applies to the Program within four subsequent years of receiving the Award, they are eligible to compete for the Presidential Award only. <BR>
  A sub-component of a Presidential Award winner may compete for the QIP Award at any time.<BR>

<P><B>Agency Limitations</B><BR>
Each Cabinet department and executive agency may submit a maximum number of applications for the President's Quality Award Program, according to its size:<BR>
a)  up to 20,000 employees4 applications<BR>
b)  up to 50,000 employees5 applications<BR>
c)  over 50,000 employees6 applications<BR>
d)  Department of Defense may submit a maximum of 6 applications for <I>each</I> service (Army, Navy, and Air Force), and a <I>total</I> of 5 additional applications for the other Defense agencies.<BR>

<P><I>Included</I> in its quota, a Cabinet department or executive branch agency may submit <I>one</I> application for an administrative or support organization. The application must cover an entire function, not just a branch or division. For example, an application could be submitted for an entire finance department, but not for any office that is part of the department. An administrative organization is eligible only for the QIP Award.<BR>

<P>These limits are set to encourage agencies to conduct internal reviews and select the best nominations. The President's Quality Award Program should not be used as a substitute for internal agency organizational assessments.<BR>

<P>An application that does not satisfy the above requirements will not be evaluated. The applicant will be notified.<BR>

<P><B>Evaluation Process</B><BR>
Examiner teams from public and private sector organizations evaluate the applications. Points are assigned to the written descriptions of each Criteria Item based on the scoring guidelines in Section VI. Examiners do not review applications from organizations within their own agency, or from organizations with which they have a relationship.<BR>

<P><B>Final Selection</B><BR>
A Panel of Judges, comprised of public and private sector representatives, selects a maximum of two winners for the Presidential Award and six winners for the QIP Award based on the evaluations of the written applications and the results of site visits.<BR>

<P>A standard of excellence is the ultimate criterion for selecting award winners. The Judges are therefore not compelled to select the maximum number of winners, or any winners at all.<BR>

<P><B>IV.  DESCRIPTION OF CATEGORIES AND ITEMS</B><BR>

<P>The description of  Categories and Items contained in this Section include numerous references to management systems traditionally associated with the private sector that are increasingly applicable to government.  Concepts such as competition, pricing, and markets are increasingly applicable to many, although not all, federal programs.  Applicants are encouraged to exercise judgment in reference to such concepts, depending on their applicability to the organization's mission and function.<BR>

<P>The Award Criteria embody certain core values and concepts of quality management.  Major core values and concepts are summarized in Section VIII.<BR>

<P>
<P><B>1.0  Leadership</B><BR>

<P>Leadership is the focal point within the Criteria for the organization's leadership system, strategic directions, and expectations. The expectations include those that address the needs of all stakeholders. The Category highlights the key roles of senior executivesthose that cannot be delegated to others. <BR>

<P><B>1.1  Senior Executive Leadership</B><BR>
This Item addresses how the organization's senior executives set strategic directions and build and maintain a leadership system conducive to high performance, individual development, and organizational learning. Executive leadership needs to take into account all stakeholders: customers, employees, suppliers, partners, the public, and the community.<BR>

<P><B><I>Area 1.1a</I></B> calls for information on the major aspects of leadershipcreating values and expectations, setting directions, developing and maintaining an effective leadership system, and building organization capabilities. Senior executives need to reflect these values, and the leadership system needs to include teamwork at the executive level.  Setting directions includes creating future opportunities for the organization and its stakeholders.<BR>

<P>This Area includes executives' review of organizational performance and capabilities.  This aspect of leadership is crucial because of the fast pace of change.  A major aim is to create organizations that are flexible and responsivechanging easily to adapt to new needs and opportunities.  Through their roles in strategy development and review of organizational performance, the senior executives develop leadership and adapt organizations to changing opportunities and requirements.<BR>

<P><B><I>Area 1.1b</I></B> calls for information on how senior executives evaluate and improve the effectiveness of the organization and leadership system, including their own leadership skills. <BR>

<P><B>1.2  Leadership System and Organization</B><BR>
This Item addresses how the organization's leadership system is translated into an effective overall organization structure and management system that are focused on performance. <BR>

<P><B><I>Area 1.2a</I></B> calls for information on how the organization's management and work processes support its customer and performance objectives.  This information should include the roles and responsibilities of managers and supervisors.  Functional and management barriers that could lead to losing sight of customers and cause decision paths to be ineffective and slow must be prevented. Performance measures provide an effective means to ensure alignment of organization units.<BR>

<P><B><I>Area 1.2a</I></B> also calls for information on how the organization's values, expectations, and directions are made real and reinforced throughout the organization via effective communications. Although senior executives' communications are necessary for effective overall communications, making values, expectations, and directions real demands constant reinforcement and truth testing, as employees observe whether or not stated values and expectations are actually the basis for organization actions and key decisions.  Communications need to include performance measures and objectives which help provide focus as well as alignment of organization units.<BR>

<P><B><I>Area 1.2b</I></B> calls for information on how organization and work unit performance are reviewed. Important work process assessments should be included in these reviews. This information should address important aspects of reviewstypes, frequency, content, uses and who conducts them. Frequency, content, uses and who conducts reviews could vary greatly, depending upon many factors. Most commonly, a review system, blending on-going (real time) and periodic reviews, is needed to meet differing requirements. Reviews offer an effective means to communicate and reinforce what is really important, how performance is measured, and how well business objectives are being met. Important considerations in reviews are the content and organization of information to foster learning and to stimulate action. This means that reviews should include non-financial and financial information that together present a clear picture of status and trends relative to the organization's key business drivers<B>, </B>the needs of all stakeholders, progress relative to competitors or similar organizations within or outside government, and productivity of assets. Reviews also provide an effective means to set priorities and to assist units that may not be performing according to expectations. <BR>

<P>The value of reviews depends heavily upon creating an integrated information systemone that is complete and organized for understanding and action. Since a major purpose of reviews is to identify improvements and resource-use priorities, the information for reviews needs to connect financial and operational data. Traditional cost accounting methods usually do not provide an adequate basis for targeting operational improvements that will lead to the most significant performance improvements. Alternative accounting approaches such as activity-based costing might offer the best means to understand processes and activities in terms of true program costs and benefits.<BR>

<P><B>1.3  Public Responsibility and Corporate Citizenship</B><BR>
This Item addresses how the organization integrates its public responsibilities and corporate citizenship into its business planning and performance improvement practices.<BR>

<P><B><I>Area 1.3a</I></B> calls for information on three basic aspects of public responsibility: (1) making risk and legal requirements an integral part of performance improvement; (2) sensitivity in planning facilities, products, services, and operations to issues of societal concern whether or not these issues are currently embodied in law; and (3) making legal and ethical conduct visible in the organization's values and performance improvement processes. Fulfilling public responsibilities means not only meeting all local, state, and federal laws and regulatory requirements, but also treating these and related requirements as areas for improvement beyond mere compliance. This means that the organization should maintain constant awareness of potential public impacts related to its facilities products, services, and operations.<BR>

<P><B><I>Area 1.3b</I></B> calls for information on how the organization leads as a corporate citizen in its key communities. The issues in this Area relate to the organization as a member of different types of communities and being a positive influence upon other organizations. Opportunities for leadership and involvement include assistance by the organization to strengthen community services, education, health care, the environment, and practices of government, trade and business associations. This includes community service by employees, encouraged, supported, and recognized by the organization. For example, organizations and their employees could help to influence the adoption of higher standards in education.<BR>

<P>
<P><B>2.0 Information and Analysis</B><BR>

<P>Information and Analysis is the focal point within the Criteria for all key information to drive the improvement of overall performance. In simplest terms, Category 2.0 is the brain center for the alignment of an organization's information system with its strategic directions. The Category addresses the information and analysis requirements for performance improvement based upon the improvement of key processes.  However, the Category also addresses the possibilities that as information, information technology, and analysis might themselves be primary sources of program performance and productivity growth.<BR>

<P><B>2.1 Management of Information and Data</B><BR>
This Item addresses the organization's selection and management of information and data to support overall performance goals with primary emphasis on supporting process management and performance improvement.<BR>
<B><I>Area 2.1a</I></B> calls for information on how information and data needed to drive improvement of overall organization performance are selected and managed. The Area has three<B> </B>parts. The first part addresses selection and emphasizes key business driversstrategically important areas of performance. The second part addresses the design of the organization's measurement system and how it ensures the alignment of organization operations with business priorities. <B> </B>The third part addresses management of data and information, and emphasizes user needsrapid access and update, and reliability. <BR>

<P><B><I>Area 2.1b</I></B> calls for information on how the organization evaluates and improves its selection, analysis, and management of information and data.  The Area emphasizes alignment with business priorities, support of process management, and feedback from information and data users. The evaluation might take into account factors such as paths of data use, extent and effectiveness of use, gaps, sharing, and organization of information and data.  It might also include assessment of adequacy of the technologies used to meet internal and external data reporting requirements, (e.g. parent organization, higher headquarters, and customers).<BR>

<P>Overall, Item 2.1 represents a key foundation for a performance-oriented organization. This foundation should include non-financial and financial information and data.<BR>

<P>Although the main focus of Item 2.1 is on information and data for the effective management of performance, information, data, and information technology often have strategic significance as well. For example, information technology could be used to build and disseminate unique knowledge about customers<B>,</B> customer groups and/or markets and create the ability to operate more<B> </B>quickly and  successfully. Also, information technology and the information and data made available through such technology could be of special advantage in partnerships or alliances. Responses to Areas 2.1a and 2.1b should take into account such strategic use of information and data. Accordingly, users should then be interpreted as business partners<B><I> </I></B>as well as organization units<I> </I>or other special alliances<I>.</I><BR>

<P>
<P><B>2.2 Competitive Comparisons and Benchmarking</B><BR>
This Item addresses external drivers of improvementdata and information regarding  performance relative to competitors or similar organizations within or outside government.<B> </B> Such data may have both operational and strategic value.<BR>

<P><B><I>Area 2.2a</I></B> calls for information on how competitive comparisons and benchmarking information are selected and used to help drive improvement of overall organization performance. The Area focuses on needs, priorities, and criteria for selecting information and data. The Area addresses four key aspects of effective selection and use of competitive comparisons and benchmarking information and data: (1) determination of needs and priorities; (2) criteria for seeking appropriate informationfrom various sources within and outside the organization and/or the government;<I> </I>(3) use of information and data to improve understanding of processes and process performance, and<I> </I>set stretch goals; and (4) use of information and data to promote major improvements in areas most critical to the organization's performance strategy.<I>  </I><BR>

<P><B><I>Area 2.2b</I></B> calls for information on how the organization evaluates and improves its processes for selecting and using competitive and benchmark information to drive performance improvement.<BR>

<P>The major premises underlying this Item are: (1) to achieve their mission and goals, organizations need to know where they stand relative to competitors or similar organizations within or outside government and to best practice performance for similar activities; (2) comparative and benchmarking information often provide impetus for significant (breakthrough) improvement and alerts organizations to competitive threats and new practices; and (3) organizations need to understand their own processes and the processes of others before they compare performance levels.<BR>

<P>Benchmarking information may also support business analysis and decisions relating to core competencies, alliances, and outsourcing.<BR>

<P><B>2.3 Analysis and Use of Organization-Level Data</B><BR>
This Item addresses organization-level analysisthe principal basis for guiding an organization's process management toward business results.  Despite the importance of facts and data, usually they do not, by themselves, provide a sound basis for actions or priorities. Action depends upon understanding cause/effect connections among processes and between processes and business results. Process actions may have many resource implications; results may have many cost and performance implications as well.  Given that resources for improvement are limited, and cause/effect connections are often unclear, there is a critical need to provide a sound analytical basis for decisions.  In the Criteria, this role is served by analyses of many types. Item 2.3 plays the key linkage role in an integrated data and analysis system that is built around financial and non-financial data.<BR>

<P><B><I>Area 2.3a</I></B> calls for information on how data and information from all parts of the organization are aggregated and analyzed to support reviews, business decisions, and planning. The focus is on three key areas of performance: customers, operational performance,<B> </B>and performance relative to similar organizations.<B> </B>The analyses in this Area depend upon non-financial and financial data, connected to provide a basis for action.<BR>

<P><B><I>Area 2.3b</I></B> calls for analysis linking customer data, improvements in product and service quality, and improvements in operational performance to improvement in financial indicators. The purpose of this linkage is to guide the selection of improvement actions toward significant gains  focused on mission effectiveness, customer satisfaction<I>, </I>reduced operating costs, and effective use of assets<I>.  </I>Analysis should utilize indicators of financial and economic performance that permit meaningful comparisons over time and with similar<I> </I>organizations.  One such indicator is working capital productivity. <I> </I><BR>

<P>
<P><B>3.0  Strategic Planning</B><BR>

<P>Strategic Planning addresses strategic and business planning and deployment of plans, with a strong focus on effective translation and deployment of<B> </B>customer and operational performance requirements. The Category stresses that customer-driven quality, achievement of performance goals, and operational performance excellence are key strategic business issues that need to be an integral part of organization planning. Specifically: <BR>
-  Customer-driven quality is a strategic view of quality. The focus is on the drivers of customer satisfaction<B> </B>and performance goalskey factor<B>s</B> in program performance and competitiveness.<BR>
-  Operational performance improvement contributes to short-term and longer-term productivity growth and cost-effectiveness. The focus on building operational capabilityincluding speed, responsiveness, and flexibilityrepresents an investment in strengthening organizational performance and competitive fitness.<BR>

<P>The Award Criteria also emphasize that continuous improvement must be an integral part of the daily activity of all work units. The special role of Category 3.0 is to provide an effective focus for daily work, aligning it with the organization's strategic directions.<BR>

<P>In particular, planning is needed to:<BR>
-  understand the key customer and operational requirements as input to setting performance goals and strategic directions which helps ensure that on-going process improvements are aligned with the organization's strategic directions;<BR>
-  optimize the use of resources and ensure bridging between short-term and longer-term requirements that may entail capital expenditures, training, etc.;<BR>
-  ensure that deployment will be effectivethat there are mechanisms to transmit requirements and achieve alignment on three basic levels: organization/executive level, the key process level, and the work-unit/individual-job level.<BR>

<P>The Category requirements are intended to emphasize strategic thinking and acting.  The Category recognizes that an effective improvement system combines improvements of many types and extents, and requires clear strategic guidance, particularly when improvement alternatives compete for scarce resources.  In most cases, priority setting depends heavily upon a program or economic rationale.  However, there might also be critical requirements such as public responsibilities which are not driven by program or financial considerations. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P><B>3.1 Strategy Development</B><BR>
This Item addresses how the organization develops its view of the future, sets strategic directions, and translates these directions into actionable key business drivers, including customer satisfaction and program leadership requirements. The focus of the Item is on leadership in attaining achievement of performance goals. Such leadership<B> </B>depends on operational effectiveness.  Although no specific time horizon is included in the Item, the thrust of the Item is sustained leadership.<BR>

<P><B><I>Area 3.1a</I></B> calls for information on the key influences, challenges, and requirements that might affect the organization's future opportunities and directionstaking as long a view as possible. The main purpose of the Area is to develop a thorough and realistic context for the development of a customer-  and market-focused strategy to guide on-going decision making, resource allocation and organization-wide management.<BR>

<P><B><I>Area 3.1b</I></B> calls for information on how strategy and plans are translated into actionable key business drivers, which serve as the basis for operationalizing and deploying plan requirements, addressed in Item 3.2. This translation might include a determination of activities the organization should perform itself and those for which it might utilize partners or seek partners.<BR>

<P><B><I>Area 3.1c</I></B> calls for information on how the organization evaluates and improves its strategic planning and plan deployment processes. This might involve input from work units regarding key deployment factorseffective translation and communication of strategy and plans, adequacy of resources, and key new needs.  Of particular importance is the evaluation of how well key measures throughout the organization are aligned.<BR>

<P>Item 3.1 plays a central directional role in the Award Criteria. It seeks to focus organization leadership on developing a strategy and creating a clear basis (key business drivers) for communicating and<B> </B>operationalizing this strategy. Operationalizing the strategy in the form of key business drivers is intended to highlight the importance of clear and measurable performance goals and objectives. These goals and objectives serve to guide the design and management of key processes. They may also serve to align communications and compensation and recognition systems with performance goals and objectives.<BR>

<P><B>3.2 Strategy Deployment</B><BR>
This Item addresses how the organization's key business drivers are deployed. Also addressed is a projection of key measures of the organization's performance. The main intent of the Item is to focus on effective operationalizing of the key business drivers, including measures that permit the tracking of progress and performance.<BR>

<P><B><I>Area 3.2a</I></B> calls for information on the organization's key business drivers and how these drivers are translated into an action plan. This includes spelling out key performance requirements; alignment of work unit, supplier, and/or partner plans; how productivity, cycle time, and waste reduction are addressed; and the principal resources committed to the accomplishment of plans. Of central importance in this Area is how alignment and consistency are achievedfor example, via key processes and key measurements. The alignment and consistency are intended also to provide a basis for priorities for on-going improvement activitiespart of the daily work of all work units. <BR>

<P><B><I>Area 3.2b</I></B> calls for a two-to-five year<B> </B>projection of key measures and/or indicators of the organization's quality and operational performance. It also calls for comparing projected performance versus similar organizations and key benchmarks. This projection/comparison is intended to encourage organizations to improve their understanding of dynamic competitive and operational performance factors, and to take into account their rates of improvement relative to high-performing organizations<B> </B>as a diagnostic management tool.<BR>

<P>
<P><B>4.0  Human Resource Development and Management</B><BR>

<P>Human Resource Development and Management is the focal point within the Award Criteria for all key human resource practicesthose directed toward the creation of a high performance workplace. The Category addresses human resource development and management in an integrated way. This integration is concerned with how well the human resource practices tie into and are aligned with the organization's strategic directions.  The Category also includes key factors for the assessment of employee well-being and satisfaction so that they can be used as diagnostic tools.<BR>

<P><B>4.1 Human Resource Planning and Evaluation</B><BR>
This Item serves as the point of direct linkage between human resource planning and the organization's strategic directions. The strategic directions should address the development of the entire work force and the needs of a high performance workplace. The Item addresses how the organization aligns its human resource planning and practices with its business directions so that high performance workplace practices become part of a coordinated organizational strategy.<BR>

<P><B><I>Area 4.1a</I></B> calls for information on key human resource plans derived from organization strategic and business planning. The Area calls for the primary thrusts, broadly defined, of the organization's human resource plansthe ones needed to support its overall strategic directions. <B> </B>The Area calls for a summary of work designs, employee development, recruitment, compensation, and other factors.  This is intended to provide a multi-year context and guide for human resource planning, management, and evaluation. <BR>

<P>
<P><B><I>Area 4.1b</I></B> calls for information on how the organization evaluates and improves its overall human resource planning and management. This Area is the brain center for human resource processes and results, as it relies upon employee-related and organization-performance data and information, and ties the overall evaluation to organization strategy and business results. However, the evaluation must go beyond broad strategy to the essential details of human resource effectiveness. The evaluation needs to provide the organization's senior executives with information on strengths and weaknesses in human resource practices and development that might bear upon the organization's abilities to achieve its short-term and longer-term business objectives. For example, the evaluation should take into account the development and progression of all categories and types of employees, including new employees. The evaluation should also monitor the extent of deployment of education and training throughout the organization, and how well education and training support organization performance improvement. The overall evaluation needs to rely heavily upon the well-being and satisfaction factors addressed in Item 4.4 and the human resource results presented in Item 6.3.<BR>

<P>The linkage between human resource practices and business results is a particularly important and challenging part of the overall evaluation.  It is especially important that organizations seek to understand the factors in the work climate that contribute to or inhibit high performance.  Just as it is important to prioritize customer problems, it is also important to prioritize employee problems based on impacts on program benefits and costs.  This might include employee satisfaction data and customer satisfaction data.<BR>

<P><B>4.2 High Performance Work Systems</B><BR>
This Item addresses how the organization's job design, compensation, and recognition approaches enable and encourage all employees to contribute effectively, operating within high performance work units. The Item emphasizes that high performance requires effective work design and reinforcement.<BR>

<P><B><I>Area 4.2a</I></B> calls for information on job design and work organizations. The basic aims of such design and organizations should be to enable employees to exercise more discretion and decision making, leading to greater flexibility and more rapid response to the changing requirements of the customer. Effective job design and flexible work organizations are necessary but may not be sufficient to ensure high performance. Job and organization design needs to be backed by information systems, education, and appropriate training to ensure that information flow supports the job and work designs. Also important is effective communication across functions and work units to ensure focus on customer requirements.<BR>

<P><B><I>Area 4.2b</I></B> addresses the important alignment of incentives with work systems. The Area calls for information on employee compensation and recognitionhow these reinforce high performance job design, work organizations, and teamwork. These are important considerations because there should be consistency between the organization's compensation and recognition system and its work structures and processes. Also, compensation and recognition may need to be based upon demonstrated skills and evaluation by peers in teams and networks. <BR>

<P><B>4.3 Employee Education, Training, and Development</B><BR>
This Item addresses how the organization develops the work force via education, training, and on-the-job reinforcement of knowledge and skills. Development is intended to meet the needs of a high performance workplace on an on-going basis. This means that education and training need to be on-going as well.<BR>

<P><B><I>Area 4.3a</I></B> calls for information on how the organization's education and training serve as a key vehicle in building organization capabilities and employee capabilities. The Area focuses on these two capabilities, treating them as investments the organization makes in its long-term future and the long-term future of employees.<BR>

<P><B><I>Area 4.3b</I></B> calls for information on how education and training are designed, delivered, reinforced, and evaluated, with special emphasis upon on-the-job application of knowledge and skills. The Area emphasizes the importance of the involvement of employees and line managers in design of training, including clear identification of specific needs. This involves job analysisunderstanding the types and levels of the skills required and the timeliness of training. The Area also emphasizes evaluation of education and training. Such evaluation could take into account line managers' evaluation, employee self-evaluation, and peer evaluation of value received through education and training relative to needs identified in design. Evaluation could also address factors such as the effectiveness of education and training delivery, impact on work unit performance, costs of delivery alternatives and cost-benefit ratios of training.<BR>

<P><B>4.4 Employee Well-Being and Satisfaction</B><BR>
This Item addresses the work environment and the work climate and how they are tailored to foster the well-being, satisfaction, and development of all employees.<BR>

<P><B><I>Area 4.4a</I></B> calls for information regarding a safe and healthful work environment to determine how the organization includes such factors in its planning and improvement activities.  Important factors in this area include establishing appropriate measures and recognizing that employee groups might experience very different environments.<BR>

<P><B><I>Area 4.4b</I></B> calls for information on the organization's approach to enhance employee well-being, satisfaction, and growth potential based upon a more holistic view of employees as key stakeholders. The Area emphasizes that the organization needs to consider a variety of mechanisms to build well-being and satisfaction. Increasingly, these mechanisms relate to development, progression, employability, and external activities. This might include family or community service activities.<BR>

<P><B><I>Area 4.4c</I></B> calls for information on how the organization determines employee satisfaction, well-being, and motivation. The Area recognizes that many factors might affect employee motivation. Although satisfaction with pay and promotion potential is important, these factors may not be adequate to assess the overall climate for motivation and high performance. For this reason, the organization may need to consider a variety of factors in the work environment to determine the key factors in motivation. Factors inhibiting motivation need to be prioritized and addressed. Further understanding of these factors could be developed through exit interviews with departing employees.  The Area also addresses how the information and data on the satisfaction, well-being, and motivation of employees are actually used in improvement activities.  Such activities might draw upon human resource results presented in Item 6.3.<BR>

<P><B>5.0 Process Management</B><BR>

<P>Process Management is the focal point within the Criteria for all key work processes. Built into the Category are the central requirements for efficient and effective process managementeffective design, a prevention orientation, evaluation and continuous improvement, linkage to suppliers, and overall high performance.<BR>

<P>An increasingly important concept in all aspects of process management and organizational design is flexibility.  In simplest terms, flexibility refers to the ability to adapt quickly and effectively to changing requirements.  Depending on the nature of the organization's strategy and operating environment, flexibility might mean rapid changeover from one product or service to another, rapid response to changing mission or demand, or the ability to produce a wide range of products.  Flexibility might demand special strategies such as modular designs, sharing of components, and specialized training.<BR>

<P><B>5.1 Design and Introduction of Products and Services</B><BR>
This Item examines how the organization designs and introduces products and services. A major focus of the Item is the rapid and effective integration of production and delivery early in the design phase. This integration is intended to minimize downstream problems for customers and/or eliminate the need for design changes that might be costly to the organization.<BR>

<P><B><I>Area 5.1a</I></B> calls for information on the design of products, services, and their production/delivery processes. Three aspects of this design are examined: (1) the translation of customer requirements into the design requirements for products and services; (2) how the product and service design requirements are translated into efficient and effective production/delivery processes; and (3) how all requirements associated with products, services, and production/delivery processes are addressed early in the design process by all appropriate organization units to ensure integration and coordination. Many organizations also need to consider requirements for suppliers and/or business partners at the design stage. Overall, effective design must take into account all stakeholders.<BR>

<P>It should be noted that although the main focus of Area 5.1a is on the design of products, services, and processes to meet customer requirements, effective design must also consider cycle time and productivity of production and delivery processes. This might entail detailed mapping of production or service processes to achieve efficiency as well as to meet customer requirements.<BR>

<P><B><I>Area 5.1b</I></B> calls for information on how product, service, and production/delivery process designs are reviewed and/or tested in detail prior to full-scale operation. Such review and/or testing is intended to ensure that all parts of the production/delivery system are capable of performing according to design. This stage could be a crucial onewith a positive or negative customer reaction and potentially high cost to the organization if pre-operation changes are significant.<BR>

<P><B><I>Area 5.1c</I></B> calls for information on how designs and design processes are evaluated and improved to progressively improve quality and cycle time. This Area is intended to determine how organizations extract lessons learned to build capabilities for future designs. Such evaluation might take into account delays and problems experienced during design, feedback from those involved, and post-operation problems that might have been averted through better design. The evaluation and improvement should strive for a continuous flow of work in the key design and delivery processes.<BR>

<P>If many design projects are carried out in parallel, or if the organization's products utilize parts, equipment, and facilities used for other products, coordination of resources might be a major concern and might offer means to significantly reduce unit costs and time to delivery.<BR>

<P><B>5.2 Process Management: Product and Service Production and Delivery</B><BR>
This Item addresses two different but related concernshow the organization maintains and how it improves key production and delivery processes.<BR>

<P><B><I>Area 5.2a </I></B>calls for information on the maintenance of process performance to ensure that processes perform according to their design. The information required includes a description of the key processes and their specific requirements, and how performance relative to these requirements is known and maintained. Specific reference is made to a measurement plan. Such a plan requires the identification of critical points in processes for measurement or observation. Implied in this plan is that measurements or observations be made at the earliest points in processes to minimize problems that may result from variations from expected (design) performance. When measurements or observations reveal such variations, a remedyusually called corrective actionis required to restore the performance of the process to its design performance. Depending on the nature of the process, the correction could involve technical, human, or both factors. Proper correction involves correcting at the source (root cause) of the variation. In some cases, customers may directly witness or take part in the process, and contribute to or be a determinant of process performance. In such cases, variations among customers must be taken into account in evaluating how well the process is performing. This might entail specific or general contingencies depending on customer response. This is especially true of professional and personal services.<BR>

<P><B><I>Area 5.2b</I></B> calls for information on how processes are improved to achieve better performance. Better performance means not only better quality from the customer's perspective but also better operational performancesuch as productivityfrom the organization's perspective. Area 5.2b anticipates that organizations use a variety of process improvement approaches. Area 5.2b calls for information on how the organization uses or considers four key approaches.  These are: (1) process analysis and research; (2) benchmarking; (3) use of alternative technology; and (4) information from customerswithin and outside the organization.  Together, these approaches offer the widest range of possibilities, including complete redesign (reengineering) of processes.<BR>

<P>
<P><B>5.3 Process Management: Support Services </B><BR>
This Item addresses how the organization designs, maintains, and improves its support service processes.<BR>

<P><B><I>Area 5.3a</I></B> calls for information on the design of key support service processes. Such design needs to be based upon the requirements of the organization's customers and of other units (internal customers) within the organizationthose within the organization who use the output of the process. The requirements of effective design are as outlined in Item 5.1coordinated and integrated to ensure efficient and effective performance.<BR>

<P><B><I>Area 5.3b</I></B> calls for information on how the organization maintains the performance of the key support service processes. This information includes a description of the key processes and their principal requirements and a description of the measurement plan and how it is used. The requirements of Area 5.3b are similar to those described in Area 5.2a.<BR>

<P><B><I>Area 5.3c</I></B> calls for information on how the organization evaluates and improves the performance of the key support service processes. The Area calls for information on how the organization uses or considers four key approaches.  These are: (1) process analysis and research; (2) benchmarking; (3) use of alternative technology; and (4) information from customerswithin and outside the organization.  Together, these approaches offer the widest range of possibilities, including complete redesign (reengineering) of processes.<BR>

<P><B>5.4 Management of Supplier Performance</B><BR>
This Item addresses how the organization manages performance of external providers of goods and services. Such management might be built around longer-term partnering relationships, particularly with key suppliers.<BR>

<P><B><I>Area 5.4a</I></B> calls for basic information on the organization's principal requirements for its key suppliers, expected performance and measures used to assess performance, how the organization determines whether or not its requirements are being met, and how performance information is fed back to suppliers.<BR>

<P><B><I>Area 5.4b</I></B> calls for information on how the organization evaluates and improves its supplier management. This includes three main elements: improving supplier abilities to meet requirements; improving its own supplier management processes; and reducing costs associated with the verification of supplier performance.<BR>

<P>For many organizations, suppliers are an increasingly important part of achieving not only high performance and lower-cost objectives, but also strategic objectives. For example, key suppliers might provide unique design, integration, and communication capabilities. Exploiting these advantages requires joint planning and partner relationships. Such planning and relationship building might entail the use of longer-term planning horizons and customer-supplier teams.  Successful exploitation might also entail special information linkages and rapid data exchanges.<BR>

<P>
<P><B>6.0 Business Results</B><BR>

<P>Business Results provides a results focus for all processes and process improvement activities. Through this focus, the Award Criterias dual purposesuperior value of products and services as viewed by customers and the marketplace, and superior organization performance reflected in operational and financial indicatorsis maintained. Category 6.0 thus provides real-time information (measures of progress) for evaluation and improvement of processes, aligned with overall business strategy. <B> </B>Analysis<B> </B>of business results data and information is called for in Item 2.3.<BR>

<P><B>6.1 Product and Service Quality Results</B><BR>
This Item addresses current levels and trends in product and service quality using key measures and/or indicators of such quality. The measures and/or indicators selected should relate to requirements that matter to the customer, the marketplace and enabling statutory requirements. These features are derived from customer-related Items (listening posts) that make up Category 7.0. If the features have been properly selected, improvements in them should show a strong positive correlation with customer and marketplace improvement indicatorscaptured in Item 7.4. The correlation between quality and customer indicators is a critical management toola device for focusing on key quality requirements. In addition, the correlation may reveal emerging or changing markets, changing importance of requirements, or even potential obsolescence of products and/or services.<BR>

<P><B><I>Area 6.1a</I></B> calls for data on current levels and trends in product and service quality.  The levels and trends might reflect changes in existing products and services or include new offerings. The Area also calls for comparative information so that the results reported can be evaluated against similar organizations or other relevant external measures of performance.<BR>

<P><B>6.2 Organization Operational and Financial Results</B><BR>
This Item addresses the operational and financial performance of the organization. Paralleling Item 6.1, which focuses on requirements that matter to the customer, Item 6.2 focuses on factors that best reflect overall organization operational and financial performance. Such factors are of two types: (1)<B> </B>genericcommon to all organizations; and (2) organization-specific. Generic factors include financial and economic<B> </B>indicators, cycle time, and productivity, as reflected in use of labor, materials, energy, capital, and assets. Productivity,<B> </B>cycle time or other operational indicators should reflect aggregate organization performance.  Organization-specific effectiveness indicators vary greatly.  Examples include rates of grants or loans processed, cost per client served, and environmental quality. <BR>

<P><B><I>Area 6.2a</I></B> calls for data on current levels and trends in organization operational and financial performance. The Area also calls for comparative information so that results reported can be evaluated against similar organizations or other relevant external measures<B> </B>of performance.<BR>

<P><B>6.3  Human Resource Results</B><BR>
This Item addresses the organization's<I> </I>human resource resultsthose relating to employee development, effectiveness, well-being, and satisfaction.<BR>

<P>Results reported could include generic and business- or organization-specific factors.  Generic factors include safety, absenteeism, turnover, and satisfaction.  Business- or organization-specific factors include those commonly used in the industry/agency or created by the organization<I> </I>for purposes of tracking progress.  Results reported might include input data, such as extent of training, but the main emphasis should be placed on measures of effectiveness.<BR>

<P><B><I>Area 6.3a</I></B> calls for data on current levels and trends in key human resource areasdevelopment, well-being, satisfaction, self-directed responsibility, and effectiveness.  The Area also calls for comparative information so that results can be meaningfully evaluated against similar organizations or other relevant external measures of performance.<BR>

<P><B>6.4  Supplier Performance Results</B><BR>
This Item addresses current levels and trends in key measures and/or indicators of supplier performance.  Suppliers are external providers of materials and services, upstream and/or downstream from the organization.  The focus should be on the most critical requirements from the point of view of the organizationthe buyer of the products and services.  Data reported should reflect results by whatever means they occurvia improvements by suppliers within the supply base, through selection of better performing suppliers, or both.<BR>

<P><B><I>Area 6.4a</I></B> calls for data and current levels and trends in supplier performance.  Measures and indicators of performance should relate to all key requirementsquality, delivery, and price. The Area also calls for comparative information so that results reported can be meaningfully<B> </B>evaluated against similar organizations or other relevant external measures<B> </B>of performance.<BR>

<P>
<P><B>7.0  Customer Focus and Satisfaction</B><BR>

<P>Customer Focus and Satisfaction is the focal point within the Award Criteria for understanding in detail the voices of customers and the marketplace. The Category emphasizes relationship management as a key requirement and calls for a variety of listening and learning strategies as well. <B> </B>Much of the information needed for this understanding comes from measuring results and trends. Such results and trends provide hard information on customers' views and their marketplace behaviors. This provides a useful foundation for setting priorities and focusing improvement activities. The results and trends offer a means to determine whether or not priorities and improvement activities are appropriately directed.<BR>

<P><B>7.1 Customer Knowledge</B><BR>
This Item addresses how the organization determines current and emerging customer requirements and expectations. The thrust of the Item is that many factors may affect customer preference and customer loyalty, making it necessary to listen and learn on a continuous basis.<BR>

<P><B><I>Area 7.1a</I></B> calls for information on the organization's process for determining current and near-term requirements and expectations of customers. The information sought includes identification of groups of customers served by the organization and how everyone in the organization is made aware of their customers and how they should be treated; and completeness of the customer pool, including recognition of segments and customers of similar organizations. Other information sought relates to sensitivity to specific product and service requirements and their relative importance to customer groups. The Area is concerned with overall validity of determination methods. The validity should be backed by use of other data and information such as complaints and gains and losses of customers.<BR>

<P><B><I>Area 7.1b</I></B> calls for information on how the organization addresses future requirements and expectations of customersits key listening and learning strategies. Such strategies depend a great deal upon the nature of the organization's products and services, the competitive environment, and relationships with customers. The listening and learning strategy selected should provide timely and useful information for decision making. <BR>

<P><B><I>Area 7.1c</I></B> calls for information on how the organization evaluates and improves its processes for determining customer requirements and expectations. Such evaluation/improvement could entail a variety of approachesformal and informalthat seek to stay in close touch with customers and with issues that bear upon customer loyalty and preference. The purpose of the evaluation called for in Area 7.1c is to find reliable and cost-effective means to understand customer requirements and expectations on a continuous basis.<BR>

<P><B>7.2  Customer Relationship Management</B><BR>
Item 7.2 addresses how the organization provides effective management of its responses and follows-up with customers. Relationship management provides a potentially important means for organizations to gain understanding about, and to manage, customer expectations. Also, frontline employees may provide vital information relating to building partnerships and other longer-term relationships with customers.<BR>

<P><B><I>Area 7.2a</I></B> calls for information on how the organization provides easy access for customers specifically for purposes of seeking information or assistance and/or to comment and complain. This Area also calls for information on service standards and their use.<BR>

<P><B><I>Area 7.2b</I></B> focuses on the complaint management process. The principal issue addressed is prompt and effective resolution of complaints including recovery of customer confidence. However, the Area also addresses how the organization learns from complaints and ensures that production/delivery process employees receive information needed to eliminate the causes of complaints.  Elimination of the causes of complaints involves aggregation of complaint information from all sources for evaluation and use throughout the organization.<BR>

<P><B><I>Area 7.2c</I></B> calls for information on how the organization follows up with customers regarding products, services, and recent transactions to determine satisfaction, to resolve problems, to build relationships and to gather information for improvement or for new services.<BR>

<P><B><I>Area 7.2d</I></B> calls for information on how the organization evaluates and improves its customer relationship management.  Such improvements may be of several types.  Examples include improving service standards, such as complaint resolution time and resolution effectiveness, and improving the use of customer feedback to improve production/delivery processes, training, and hiring.  The Area also addresses how knowledge about customers is accumulated, an important aspect of relationship building.<BR>

<P><B>7.3  Customer Satisfaction Determination</B><BR>
This Item addresses how the organization determines customer satisfaction and satisfaction relative to similar organizations.<BR>

<P><B><I>Area 7.3a</I></B> calls for information on how the organization gathers information on customer satisfaction, including any important differences in approaches for different customer groups or segments. The Area highlights the importance of the measurement scale to focus on the factors that reflect customers' behaviors.<BR>

<P><B><I>Area 7.3b</I></B> calls for information on how satisfaction relative to similar organizations is determined. Such information might be derived from organization-based comparative studies or studies made by independent organizations. The purpose of this comparison is to develop information that can be used for improving performance.<BR>

<P><B><I>Area 7.3c</I></B> calls for information on how the organization evaluates and improves its processes and measurement scales for determining customer satisfaction and satisfaction relative to similar organizations. This evaluation/improvement process is expected to draw upon other indicators such as gains and losses of customers and<B> c</B>ustomer dissatisfaction indicators such as complaints. The evaluation should also consider how well customer satisfaction information and data are used throughout the organization. Such use is likely to be enhanced if data are presented in an actionable form meeting two key conditions: (1) survey responses tying directly to key business processes, so that what needs to be improved is clear; and (2) survey responses translated into cost-benefit implications to support setting of improvement priorities.<BR>

<P><B>7.4  Customer Satisfaction Results</B><BR>
This Item addresses the principal customer-related resultscustomer satisfaction and customer satisfaction relative to competitors or similar organizations within or outside government. The Item calls for the use of all relevant data and information to establish the organization's performance.  Relevant data and information include:  customer satisfaction and dissatisfaction; gains and losses of customers and customer groups; and competitive awards, ratings, and recognition from independent organizations, including customers.<BR>

<P>The reason for including measures of both satisfaction and dissatisfaction is that they usually provide different information.  That is, the factors in high levels of satisfaction may not be the same factors as those that relate to high levels of dissatisfaction.  In addition, the effect of individual instances of dissatisfaction on overall satisfaction could vary widely depending upon the effectiveness of the organization's resolution (recovery) of a problem.<BR>

<P><B><I>Area 7.4a</I></B> calls for information on current levels and trends in key measures and/or indicators of customer satisfaction and dissatisfaction.<BR>

<P><B><I>Area 7.4b</I></B> calls for information on current levels and trends in key measures and/or indicators of customer satisfaction relative to competitors or similar organizations within or outside government.  The presentation of results might include information on gains and losses of customers and customer groups relative to competitors or similar organizations within or outside government.<BR>

<P><B>Notes:</B><BR>
(1)  Item 2.3 focuses primarily on analysis for organization-level purposes, such as reviews (1.2b) and strategic planning (Item 3.1). Data for such analysis come from all parts of the organization and include results reported in Items 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, and 7.4.  Other Items call for analyses of specific sets of data for special purposes. For example, the Items of Category 4.0 require analysis to determine effectiveness of training and other human-resource practices. Such special-purpose analyses should be part of the overall information base available for use in Item 2.3.<BR>
(2)  Analysis includes trends, projections, cause-effect correlations, and the search for deeper understanding needed to set priorities to use resources more effectively to serve overall business objectives.  Accordingly, analysis draws upon all kinds of data: operational, customer-related, financial, and economic.<BR>

<P>b.  How strategies and plans are translated into actionable key business drivers, which serve as the basis for deploying plan requirements, addressed in Item 3.2.<BR>

<P>c.  How the organization evaluates and improves its strategic planning and plan deployment processes.<BR>

<P><B>Notes: </B><BR>
(1) Item 3.1 addresses overall organization strategy and business plans, not specific product and service designs.<BR>
(2) The sub-parts of 3.1a are intended to serve as an outline of key factors involved in looking toward the future as a context for strategic planning. Strategy and planning refer to a future-oriented basis for major business decisions, resource allocations, and organization-wide management. <BR>
(3) Key business drivers are the areas of performance most critical to the organization's success. They include customer-driven quality requirements and operational requirements such as productivity, cycle time, deployment of new technology, strategic alliances, supplier development, employee productivity and development, and research and development. Deployment of plans should include how progress will be tracked, such as by using key measures.<BR>
(4)  Customer values and expectations (3.1a) might include pricing factors.  That is, program success might depend upon achieving cost levels dictated by anticipated market prices rather than setting prices to cover costs. <BR>
(5)  The purposes of projecting the program or business environment are to anticipate emerging needs and requirements, to shorten reaction time, and to identify opportunities.  If the organization uses modeling, scenario, or other techniques to project changes in the operating environment, such techniques should be briefly outlined in 3.1a (2).<BR>
(6)  Examples of strategy and business plans that might be the starting points for the development of key business drivers are:<BR>
  new product/service lines;<BR>
  new manufacturing and/or service delivery approaches, such as customization;<BR>
  launch of joint ventures and/or partnerships;<BR>
  new R&amp;D thrusts;<BR>
  new product and/or process technologies.<BR>
(7) How the organization evaluates and improves its strategic planning and plan deployment process might take into account the results of reviews (1.2b), input from work units, and projection information (3.2b). The evaluation might also take into account how well strategies and requirements are communicated and understood, and how well key measures are aligned.<BR>

<P><B>3.2   Strategy Deployment	(20 pts.) (A-D)</B><BR>
Summarize the organization's key business drivers and how they are deployed. Show how the organization's performance projects into the future relative to competitors or similar organizations within or outside government and<B> </B>key benchmarks.<BR>

<P><B><I>Areas to Address</I></B><BR>
a.  Summary of the specific key business drivers derived from the organization's strategic directions and how these drivers are translated into actions. Describe: (1) key performance requirements and associated operational performance measures and/or indicators and how they are deployed; (2) how the organization aligns work unit and supplier and/or partner plans and targets; (3) how productivity and cycle time improvement and reduction in waste are included in plans and targets; and (4) the principal resources committed to the accomplishment of plans. Note any important distinctions between short- and longer-term plans.<BR>

<P>b.  Two-to-five year projection of key measures and/or indicators of the organization's customer-related and operational performance. Describe how product and/or service quality and operational performance might be compared with key competitors or similar organizations within or outside government and key benchmarks over this time period.  Briefly explain the comparisons, including any estimates or assumptions made regarding the projected product and/or service quality and operational performance of competitors or similar organizations within or outside government or changes in key benchmarks.<BR>

<P><B>Notes: </B><BR>
(1)   The focus in Item 3.2 is on the translation of the organization's strategic plans, resulting from the process described in Item 3.1, to requirements for work units, suppliers, and partners. The main intent of Item 3.2 is alignment of short- and long-term operations with performance goals and strategic directions. Although the deployment of these plans will affect products and services, design of products and services is not the focus of Item 3.2. Such design is addressed in Item 5.1.<BR>
(2)  Productivity and cycle time improvement and waste reduction [3.2a(3)] might address factors such as inventories, work-in-process, inspection, downtime, changeover time, set-up time, and other examples of utilization of resourcesmaterials, equipment, energy, capital, and labor.<BR>
(3)  Area 3.2b addresses projected progress in improving performance and in learning from competitors or similar organizations within or outside government.   This projection may draw upon analysis (Item 2.3) and data reported in results Items (Category 6.0 and Item 7.4). Such projections are intended to support reviews (1.2b), evaluation of planning (3.1c), and other Items.  Another purpose is to take account of the fact that competitors, similar organizations<B> </B>within or outside government, and benchmarks may also be improving over the time period of the projection.<BR>
(4)  Projections of customer-related and operational performance (3.2b) might be expressed in terms of costs, revenues, measures of productivity, and economic indicators.  Projections might also include innovation rates or other factors important to the organization's competitive position. <BR>

<P><B>4.0  HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT AND MANAGEMENT   140 points</B><BR>

<P>The Human Resource Development and Management Category examines how the work force is enabled to develop and utilize its full potential, aligned with the organization's performance objectives.

<P><B>4.1   Human Resource Planning and Evaluation	(20 pts.) (A-D)</B><BR>
Describe how the organization's human resource planning and evaluation are aligned with its strategic and business plans and address the development and well-being of the entire work force.<BR>

<P><B><I>Areas to Address</I></B><BR>
a.  How the organization translates overall requirements from strategic and business planning (Category 3.0) to specific human resource plans. Summarize key human resource plans in the following areas: (1) changes in work design to improve flexibility, innovation, and rapid response; (2) employee development, education, and training; (3) changes in compensation, recognition, and benefits; and (4) recruitment, including critical skill categories and<B> </B>expected or planned changes in demographics of the work force. Distinguish between the short term and the longer term, as appropriate.<BR>

<P>b.  How the organization evaluates and improves its human resource planning and practices and the alignment of the plans and practices with the organization's strategic and business directions. Include how employee-related data and organization-performance data are analyzed and used: (1) to assess the development and well-being of all categories and types of employees; (2) to assess the linkage of the human resource practices to key business results; and (3) to ensure that reliable and complete human resource information is available for organization planning and recruitment.<BR>

<P><B>Notes: </B><BR>
(1) Human resource planning addresses all aspects of designing and managing systems to meet the needs of both the organization and the employees. This Item calls for information on human resource plans, but does not imply that such planning is separate from strategic and business planning.

-  won/lost analysis relative to competitors or similar organizations within or outside government; <BR>
-  post-transaction follow-up (see 7.2c); and <BR>
  analysis of major factors affecting key customers.<BR>
(8)  Examples of evaluation and factors appropriate for 7.1c are:<BR>
-  adequacy and timeliness of the customer-related information;<BR>
-  improvement of survey design;<BR>
-  best approaches for getting reliable and timely informationsurveys, focus groups, customer-contact personnel, etc.;<BR>
-  increasing and decreasing importance of product/service features among customer groups or segments; and<BR>
-  most effective listening/learning strategies.<BR>
Evaluation might also be supported by organization-level analysis addressed in Item 2.3.<BR>

<P><B>7.2   Customer Relationship Management	(30 pts.) (A-D)</B><BR>
Describe how the organization provides effective management of its responses and follows-up with customers to preserve and build relationships and to increase knowledge about specific customers and about general customer expectations,<B> </B>to improve organizational performance, and to generate ideas for new products and services.<BR>

<P><B><I>Areas to Address</I></B><BR>
a.  How the organization provides information and easy access to enable customers to seek information and assistance, to comment, and to complain. Describe contact management performance measures and service standards and how these requirements are set, deployed, and tracked.<BR>

<P>b.  How the organization ensures that formal and informal complaints and feedback received by all organization units are resolved effectively and promptly. Briefly describe the complaint management process and how it ensures effective recovery of customer confidence, how it meets customer requirements for resolution effectiveness,<B> </B>how it ensures that complaints by organizational units are aggregated and analyzed for use throughout the organization, and how it seeks to eliminate the causes of complaints.<BR>

<P>c.  How the organization follows up with customers on products, services, and recent transactions to determine satisfaction, to resolve problems, to seek feedback for improvement,<B> </B>to build relationships, and to develop ideas for new products and services.<BR>

<P>d.  How the organization evaluates and improves its customer relationship management. Include: (1) how service standards, including those related to access and complaint management, are improved based on customer information; and (2) how knowledge about customers is accumulated.<BR>

<P><B>Notes:</B><BR>
(1)  Customer relationship management refers to a process, not to an organization unit. However, some organizations may have units that address all or most of the requirements included in this Item. Also, some of these requirements may be included among the responsibilities of frontline employees in processes described in Items 5.2 and 5.3.<BR>
(2)  How the organization maintains easy access for customers (7.2a) might involve close integration, electronic networks, etc.<BR>
(3)  Performance measures and service standards (7.2a) apply not only to employees providing the responses to customers but also to other units within the organization that make effective responses possible. Deployment needs to take into account all key points in a response chain. Examples of measures and standards are: telephonic, percentage of resolutions achieved by frontline employees, number of transfers, and resolution response time.<BR>
(4)  Responses to 7.2b and 7.2c might include organization processes for addressing customer complaints or comments based upon expressed or implied guarantees. <BR>
(5)  The complaint management process (7.2b) might include analysis and priority setting for improvement projects based upon potential cost impact of complaints, taking into account customer retention and satisfaction related to resolution effectiveness. Some of the analysis requirements of Item 7.2 relate to Item 2.3.<BR>
(6)  Improvement of customer relationship management (7.2d) might require training. Training for customer-contact (frontline) employees should address: (a) key knowledge and skills, including knowledge of products and services; (b) listening to customers; (c) soliciting comments from customers; (d) how to anticipate and handle problems or failures (recovery); and (e) how to manage expectations. Such training should be described in Item 4.3.<BR>
(7)  Information on trends and levels in measures and/or indicators of complaint response time, effective resolution, and percent of complaints resolved on first contact should be reported in Item 6.1.<BR>

<P><B>7.3   Customer Satisfaction Determination	(30 pts.) (A-D)</B><BR>
Describe how the organization determines customer satisfaction, and customer satisfaction relative to competitors or similar organizations within or outside government; describe how these determination processes are evaluated and improved.<BR>

<P><B><I>Areas to Address</I></B><BR>
a.  How the organization determines customer satisfaction. Include: (1) a brief description of processes and measurement scales used; frequency of determination; and how objectivity and validity are ensured. Indicate significant differences, if any, in processes and measurement scales for different types of customers and customer groups or segments; and (2) how customer satisfaction measurements capture key information that reflects customers' likely future behavior.<BR>

<P>b.  How customer satisfaction, compared with that for competitors or similar organizations within or outside government is determined. Describe: (1) organization-based comparative studies; and (2) comparative studies or evaluations made by independent organizations and/or customers. For (1) and (2), describe how objectivity and validity of studies or evaluations are ensured.<BR>

<P>c.  How the organization evaluates and improves its overall processes and measurement scales for determining customer satisfaction and satisfaction relative to competitors or similar organizations within or outside government. Include how other indicators (such as gains and losses of customers) and customer dissatisfaction indicators (such as complaints) are used in this improvement process. Describe also how the evaluation determines the effectiveness of the use of customer satisfaction information and data throughout the organization.<BR>

<P><B>Notes: </B><BR>
(1)  Customer satisfaction measurement might include both a numerical rating scale and descriptors assigned to each unit in the scale. An effective (actionable) customer satisfaction measurement system is one that provides the organization with reliable information about customer ratings of specific product and service features and the relationship between these ratings and the customer's likely future market behaviorrepurchase and/or positive referral.  Product and service features might include accessibility, ease of use, overall value and price.<BR>
(2)  The organization's products and services might be delivered to end users via other government organizations or businesses.  Thus, customer groups or segments should take into account these other entities and end users.<BR>
(3)  Customer dissatisfaction indicators include complaints, claims, repeat services, replacements, downgrades, repairs, mis-shipments, and incomplete orders.<BR>
(4)  Organization-based or independent organization comparative studies (7.3b) might take into account one or more indicators of customer dissatisfaction as well as satisfaction. The extent and types of such studies may depend upon factors such as organization size.<BR>
(5)  Evaluation (7.3c) might take into account:<BR>
-  how well the measurement scale relates to actual customer behavior;<BR>
-  the effectiveness of pre-survey research used in survey design; <BR>
-  how well customer responses link to key business processes and thus provide actionable information for improvement; and<BR>
-  how well customer responses have been translated into cost and performance implications and thus provide actionable information for improvement priorities.<BR>
(6)  Use of data from satisfaction measurement is called for in 5.2b(4) and 5.3c(4). Such data also provide key input to analysis (Item 2.3).<BR>

<P>
<P><B>7.4   Customer Satisfaction Results	(160 pts.) (R)</B><BR>
Summarize the organization's customer satisfaction and dissatisfaction results using key measures and/or indicators of these results. Compare results with competitors or similar organizations within or outside government.<BR>

<P><B><I>Areas to Address</I></B><BR>
a.  Current levels and trends in key measures and/or indicators of customer satisfaction and dissatisfaction. Results should be segmented by customer groups and product and service types, as appropriate.<BR>

<P>b.  Current levels and trends in key measures and/or indicators of customer satisfaction relative to competitors or similar organizations within or outside government. Results should be segmented by customer groups and product and service types, as appropriate.<BR>

<P><B>Notes:</B><BR>
(1)  Results reported in this Item derive from methods described in Items 7.3 and 7.2. <BR>
(2)  Measures and/or indicators of satisfaction relative to other entities (7.4b) might include gains and losses of customers to competitors or similar organizations within or outside government.<BR>
(3)  Measures and/or indicators of satisfaction relative to competitors or similar organizations within or outside government might include objective information and/or data from independent organizations, including customers. Examples include survey results, competitive awards, recognition, and ratings. Such information and data should reflect comparative satisfaction (and dissatisfaction), not comparative performance of products and services (called for in Item 6.1). <BR>
(4)  Customer retention data might be used in both 7.4a and 7.4b. For example, in 7.4a, customer retention might be included as a satisfaction indicator, while in 7.4b, customer retention relative to competitors or similar organizations within or outside government might be part of a switching analysis to determine competitive position and the factors responsible for it.<BR>

<P>
<P><B>VI.  SCORING SYSTEM AND GUIDELINES</B><BR>

<P><B>Scoring System</B><BR>
The system for scoring applicant responses to Criteria Items (Items) and for developing feedback is based upon three evaluation dimensions:  Approach, Deployment, and Results.  All Items require applicants to furnish information relating to one or more of these dimensions.  Specific factors associated with the evaluation dimensions are described below.<BR>

<P><B><I>Approach</I></B><BR>
Approach refers to the design or methodology in reference to the Item requirements.  The factors used to evaluate approaches include:<BR>
-  appropriateness of the methods to the requirements;<BR>
-  effectiveness of use of methods;<BR>
-  degree to which approach is systematic, integrated, consistently applied;<BR>
-  degree to which approach embodies evaluation/improvement cycles;<BR>
-  degree to which approach is based upon objective, reliable data/information;<BR>
-  degree to which approach is prevention based;<BR>
-  evidence of innovation, including significant and effective adaptations of approaches used in other types of applications.<BR>

<P><B><I>Deployment</I></B><BR>
Deployment refers to the <U>extent</U> to which the approach is applied to all requirements of the Item.  The factors used to evaluate deployment include:<BR>
-  use of the approach in addressing operational and Item requirements;<BR>
-  application of the approach to all business products/services, transactions with customers and suppliers, and support functions/processes;<BR>
-  use of the approach by all appropriate work units.<BR>

<P><B><I>Results</I></B><BR>
Results refers to <U>outcomes</U> in achieving the purposes in the Item.  The factors used to evaluate results include:<BR>
-  current performance levels;<BR>
-  performance levels relative to appropriate comparisons and/or benchmarks;<BR>
-  rate, breadth and importance of performance improvements;<BR>
-  demonstration of sustained improvement and/or high-level performance.<BR>

<P><B><I>Item Classification and Scoring Dimensions</I></B><BR>
Award Criteria Items are classified according to the kinds of information and/or data applicants are expected to furnish.<BR>

<P>The two types of Items and their designations are:<BR>
1.  Approach/Deployment  (A-D)<BR>
2.  Results  (R)<BR>

<P>Approach and Deployment are linked to emphasize that descriptions of Approach should always convey Deploymentconsistent with the specific requirements of the Item.  Although Approach and Deployment dimensions are linked, feedback to the applicant reflects strengths and/or areas for improvement in either or both dimensions.<BR>

<P>Results Items depend on data demonstrating performance levels and trends.  However, the evaluation factor, breadth and importance of performance improvements, is concerned with how widespread and how significant an applicant's improvement results are.  This is directly related to the Deployment dimension.  That is, if improvement processes are widely deployed, there should be corresponding results.  A score for a Results Item is thus a composite based upon overall performance, taking into account the breadth and importance of improvements.<BR>

<P><B><I>Relevance and Importance as a Scoring Factor</I></B><BR>
The three evaluation dimensions described above (Approach, Deployment, and Results) are all critical to assessment and feedback.  However, evaluation and feedback will also consider the relevance and importance to the applicant's organization of reported improvements in these dimensions.  The areas of greatest relevance and importance should be addressed in the Organization Overview, and are a primary focus of Items related to the organization's customers, and final products and services, such as Items 3.1, 5.1, 5.2, 6.1, and 7.1.  Of particular importance are the key customer requirements and key business drivers.<BR>

<P><B><I>Assignment of Scores to Applicants' Responses</I></B><BR>
President's Quality Award Program Examiners observe the following guidelines in assignment of scores to applicants' responses:<BR>
-  All relevant Areas to Address should be included in the Item response.  Also, responses should reflect what is relevant and important to the organization's operations and mission.<BR>
-  In assigning a score to an Item, an Examiner first decides which scoring range (e.g., 40% to 60%) best fits the overall Item response.  Overall best fit does not require total agreement with each of the statements for that scoring range.  Actual score <I>within the</I> <I>range</I> depends upon an Examiner's judgment of the closeness of the Item response in relation to the statements in the next higher and next lower scoring ranges.<BR>
-  An Approach/Deployment Item score of 50% represents an approach that meets the basic objectives of the Item and that is deployed to the principal activities covered in the Item.  Higher scores reflect maturity (cycles of improvement), integration, and broader deployment.<BR>
-  A Results Item score of 50% represents clear indication of improvement trends and/or good levels of performance in the principal results areas covered in the Item.  Higher scores reflect better improvement rates and comparative performance as well as broader coverage.<BR>

<P><B>VII.  ORGANIZATION OVERVIEW AND CRITERIA RESPONSE </B><BR>
<B>GUIDANCE</B><BR>

<P><B>Organization Overview</B><BR>
Applicants will provide an overview of their organization.  The overview sets the stage for the evaluation and helps the Examiners understand: 1) what is relevant and important to the applicant's mission and function, 2) key factors influencing how the organization operates, and 3) future directions of the organization.<BR>
  <BR>
The Organization Overview should contain four sections:<BR>
<B><I>1.  Basic Organization Description</I></B><BR>
	This section should provide the following information about the applicant:<BR>
	-  its mission, products, and services;<BR>
	-  its size, location and profile of employees, including number, types, educational levels, bargaining units, and safety requirements;<BR>
	-  chart depicting current organizational structure;<BR>
	-  major equipment and technology used; and<BR>
	-  brief history of when and how quality principles and tools have been/are used to improve organizational performance.<BR>

<P><B><I>2.  Customer Requirements</I></B><BR>
	This section should provide the following information:<BR>
	-  list of principal customers and their category (voluntary, entitled, compelled) where appropriate;<BR>

	-  description of significant differences, if any, in requirements among customer groups.<BR>

<P><B><I>3.  Supplier Relationships</I></B><BR>
	This section should provide the following information:<BR>
	-  types and numbers of principal suppliers; and<BR>
	-  limitations or special requirements that may exist in dealing with some or all suppliers.<BR>

<P><B><I>4.  Other Factors Important to the Applicant</I></B><BR>
	This section should provide information on:<BR>
	-  principal factors determining competitive or program success, such as cost reduction, product innovation, technology, productivity or other changes taking place in the agency affecting program success;<BR>
	-  major new thrusts or future challenges; <BR>
	-  introduction of new technologies;<BR>
	-  laws or regulations significantly affecting operations; and<BR>
	-  new organizational alliances/partners.<BR>

<P><B>Criteria Response Guidance</B><BR>
Writing an application for the President's Quality Award Program involves responding in 60 or 70 pages or less (depending on size of the organization) to the requirements given in the 24 Criteria Items.  The guidelines given in this section are offered to assist applicants to respond most effectively to the Item requirements.<BR>

<P>The guidelines are presented in three parts:  (A.) General Guidelines regarding the Award Criteria, including how the Items are formatted;  (B.) Guidelines for Responding to Approach/Deployment Items; and  (C.) Guidelines for Responding to Results Items.<BR>

<P><B><I>A.  General Guidelines</I></B><BR>
<B><I>1.  Read the entire Application booklet</I></B><BR>
The main sections of the booklet provide an overall orientation to the Criteria, including how applicants' responses are evaluated.  Applicants should be thoroughly familiar with the following sections:<BR>
-  Award Criteria  Section V<BR>
-  Scoring System and Guidelines  Section VI<BR>
-  Glossary of Key Terms  Section X<BR>
-  Descriptions of Categories and Items  Section IV<BR>

<P><B><I>2.  Review the Item format</I></B><BR>
The Item format (see Item Format figure ) shows the different parts of Items, what each part is for, and where each part is placed.  It is especially important to understand the Areas to Address and the Item Notes.  All Items and Areas to Address are described in Section V.<BR>

<P>Each Item is classified either (A - D) or ( R ), depending on the type of information required.  The meaning of these classification symbols is given on page 49.  Guidelines for responding to Approach/Deployment Items are given on page55-56.  Guidelines for responding to Results Items are given on page 56-57.<BR>

<P><B><I>3.  Start by preparing the Organization Overview</I></B><BR>
The Organization Overview is the most appropriate starting point  for writing an application.  The Organization Overview is intended to help everyoneincluding the agency's application writer(s) and reviewer(s)to understand what is most relevant and important to the applicant's business.  Guidelines for preparing the Organization Overview are given on page 53.<BR>

<P><B><I>B.  Guidelines for Responding to Approach/Deployment Items</I></B><BR>
The Award Criteria focus on performance results.  Results Items (6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, and 7.4) require applicants to summarize results of all kinds, including operational, customer-related, and financial.  However, results by themselves offer little diagnostic value.  For example, if results are poor in some areas or improving at rates slower than other similar programs, it is important to understand why this is so and what might be done to accelerate improvement.  Approach/Deployment Items permit diagnosis of the applicant's most important systems, activities and processesthose that offer the greatest potential for fast-paced improvement of the applicant's performance.  Diagnosis and feedback depend heavily upon the content and completeness of Approach/Deployment Item responses.  For this reason, it is important to respond to these Items by providing key process information.  Guidelines for organizing such information follow.<BR>

<P><B><I>1.  Understand the meaning of how.</I></B><BR>
Items that request information on approach include Areas to Address that begin with the word how.  Responses should outline key process information such as methods used, measures of progress and assessment, how the approach is deployed, and evaluation factors.  These should be designed to permit the reader to gain an understanding of the key operating factors of the approach, how it functions on a continuing, systematic and day-to-day basis, in order to provide a basis for diagnosis and feedback.<BR>

<P><B><I>2.  Write responses(s) with the following guidelines in mind:</I></B><BR>
<I>  - Describe key processes and how they work</I><BR>
It is important to give basic information about what the organization's key processes are, how they work and who is responsible.  It is not sufficient to state who is responsible for a given process, such as customer satisfaction data are analyzed by the Customer Service Division.  The application should describe when, how and by whom the data is analyzed and what is done with the information so that the reader can understand the mechanics of how the process is carried out.<BR>

<P><I>  - Show that activities are systematic</I><BR>
Provide information to show that approaches are systematic in contrast to examples or anecdotal accounts of activity.  Systematic approaches are carried out continuously over time, with built-in cycles for improvement.  Systematic approaches over time permit continuous learning, improvement and maturity.  Scores above 50% rely upon clear evidence that approaches are systematic.  <BR>

<P><I>  - Show deployment</I><BR>
Responses should provide information to clearly indicate the extent to which approaches are deployed to appropriate units within the organization.  If information is provided regarding an activity or approach in only one part of the organization, evaluators will assume it is isolated to that unit.<BR>

<P>An effective technique to show deployment compactly is use of summary tables that outline what is done in different parts of the organization.  Where tables are used, they should be supported by a summary of the basic approach in the accompanying narrative.<BR>

<P><I>  - Show focus and consistency</I><BR>
Responses should provide clear evidence that the organization is focusing on key processes (those that have the greatest impact on performance of the organization's mission) and improvements that offer the greatest potential to improve performance.<BR>

<P>There are four areas where focus and consistency should be evident: (1) the Organization Overview should make clear what is important; (2) the Strategic Planning Category, particularly key business drivers, should highlight areas of greatest focus and describe how deployment is accomplished; (3) descriptions of organization-level analysis (Item 2.3) should show how the organization analyzes performance information to set priorities; and (4) organization-level review (Item 1.2b) should show how performance information is tracked and used.  When describing activities in the Approach-Deployment Items, focus and consistency can be demonstrated when accompanied by reporting corresponding results in appropriate Items (Category 6 and Item 7.4.)<BR>

<P><I>  - Respond fully to Item requirements</I><BR>
Responses should respond to all information on important parts of each Area to Address.  Missing information will be interpreted as a gap in approach and/or deployment.<BR>

<P><B><I>3.  Cross-reference when appropriate.</I></B><BR>
Applicants should try to make each Item response self-contained.  However, there may be instances when responses to different Items are mutually reinforcing.  It is then appropriate to reference responses to other Items, rather than to repeat information.  In such cases, applicants should use designators (for example, see Sec. 2.3a below).<BR>

<P><B><I>C.  Guidelines for Responding to Results Items</I></B><BR>
The Award Criteria place greatest emphasis on results.  Results Items (Category 6 and Item 7.4) call for results related to all key requirements, stakeholders, and goals.  The following information and guidelines relate to effective and complete presentation of results.<BR>

<P><B><I>1.  For presenting results data effectively, use the following key statements as guidance:</I></B><BR>
  - Trends show directions of results and rates of change.<BR>
 -  Performance levels show performance on some meaningful measurement scale.<BR>
 -  Breadth of results shows completeness of deployment of improvement activities.<BR>
 -  Focus shows that results reported are consistent with and cover the most important requirements for business success, highlighted in the Organization Overview and included in responses to other Items.<BR>

<P><B><I>2.  Include trend data covering actual periods for tracking trends.</I></B><BR>
No minimum time is specified for trend data. Time periods might span five years or more for some results.  Trends might be much shorter for some of the organization's improvement activities.  However, important new data should be included even if trends and comparisons are not yet well established, particularly to show the extent to which activities are deployed and the organization is focused on important areas of improvement.<BR>

<P><B><I>3.  Use a compact format.</I></B><BR>
Every effort should be made to provide key information in concise and compact form.  One way to accomplish this is by use of graphs and tables.  Label graphs and tables for easy interpretation.  Results over time or compared with others should be normalized presented in a way (such as use of ratios) that takes into account various size factors.  For example, if an organization's work force has been declining, reporting safety results in terms of accidents per 100 employees would permit more meaningful trend data than total accidents.<BR>

<P><I>4.  </I><B><I>Integrate results into the body of the text.</I></B><BR>
When the response uses graphs or tables, descriptions of results should be integrated into the text in summary form and should be presented close to the graphical or table information.  Use figure numbers that correspond to Items.  For example, the third table providing information for Item 6.1 might be captioned Table 6.1-3.<BR>

<P>
<P><B>VIII.  CORE VALUES AND CONCEPTS</B><BR>

<P>The Award Criteria are the basis for applying for the Award and for providing feedback to applicants.  They define a quality systemthe key elements of a quality improvement effort and the relative importance and interrelationship of these elements.  The Award Criteria are supportive of the Administrations efforts to reinvent the government.<BR>

<P>The Award Criteria embody certain core values common among world class public and private sector organizations, which, when adopted have proven to result in improved performance, mission success, and value to the ultimate customerthe American public.  These values and concepts are the foundation for integrating customerand organizationperformance requirements within a results-oriented framework.  These core values and concepts are:<BR>

<P><B>Customer-Driven Quality:  </B>Customers are those who use or are directly affected by the organization's products or servicesthose for whom the organization is in business.  Customers can be grouped into classifications according to their relationship to the government as a supplier:  voluntary, entitled and compelled users of the organization's products or services.  Voluntary users choose to use the product/service, such as visitors to national parks and users of government statistics.  Entitled users have an automatic legal right to benefit from the program, such as recipients of social security and users of veterans hospitals.  Compelled users fall under the jurisdiction of government programs that are prescriptive in nature, where punitive action can be taken if users do not comply (e.g., prison inmates and taxpayers).<BR>

<P>Quality is judged by customers. All product and service features and characteristics that contribute value to customers and lead to customer satisfaction and preference must be a key focus of an organization's management system. Value, satisfaction, and preference may be influenced by many factors throughout the customers overall experience in using the organization's products and services. These factors include the organization's relationship with customers that helps build trust, confidence, and loyalty. This concept of quality includes not only the product and service characteristics that meet basic customer requirements, but it also includes those features and characteristics that enhance them and differentiate them from competing offerings. Such enhancement and differentiation may be based upon new offerings, combinations of product and service offerings, rapid response, or special relationships.<BR>

<P>Customer-driven quality is thus a strategic concept.  Customer requirements drive the organization's strategic plan of how it will realize its goalshow it will achieve performance results that lead to customer satisfaction, recognizing the inherent differences in relationships with different categories of customers.  Processes are developed to meet customer needs, measurement systems are developed to track progress, and information is collected and used to improve work processes and the products and services delivered to customers.  In high performing organizations, everyone in the organization shares the vision, has a sense of community and commitment to a common purpose of meeting customer requirements, and works together to create an alignment of the goals of the organization.<BR>

<P><B>Leadership:  </B>An organization's senior leaders need to set directions and create a customer orientation, clear and visible values, and high expectations. Reinforcement of the values and expectations requires personal commitment and involvement. The leaders basic values and commitment need to address all stakeholders and include areas of public responsibility and corporate citizenship. The leaders need to guide the creation of strategies, systems, and methods for achieving excellence and building capabilities. The systems and methods need to guide all activities and decisions of the organization. The senior leaders need to commit to the development of the entire work force and should encourage participation and creativity by all employees. Through their personal involvement in planning, communications, review of organization performance, and employee recognition, the senior leaders serve as role models, reinforcing the values and building leadership and initiative throughout the organization.<BR>

<P><B>Continuous Improvement and Learning:  </B>Achieving the highest levels of performance requires a well-executed approach to continuous improvement. The term continuous improvement refers to both incremental and breakthrough improvement. Improvement needs to be embedded in the way the organization functions.  Embedded means: (1) improvement is part of the daily work of all work units; (2) improvement processes seek to eliminate problems at their source; and (3) improvement is driven by opportunities to do better, as well as by problems that must be corrected. Sources of improvement include: employee ideas; research and development; customer input; and benchmarking or other comparative performance information.<BR>

<P>Improvements may be of several types: (1) enhancing value to customers through new and improved products and services; (2) reducing errors, defects, and waste; (3) improving responsiveness and cycle time performance; (4) improving productivity and effectiveness in the use of all resources; and (5) improving the organization's performance in fulfilling its public responsibilities and serving as a corporate citizenship role model. Thus, improvement is intended not only to provide better products and services, but also to be more responsive and efficient. To meet these objectives, continuous improvement must contain cycles of planning, execution, and evaluation. This requires a basispreferably a quantitative basisfor assessing progress and for deriving information for future cycles of improvement. Such information should directly link performance goals and internal operations.<BR>

<P><B>Employee Participation and Development:  </B>An organization's success in improving performance depends increasingly on the skills and motivation of its work force. Employee success depends increasingly on having opportunities to learn and to practice new skills. Organizations need to invest in the development of the work force through education, training, and opportunities for continuing growth. Such opportunities might include classroom and on-the-job training, job rotation, and pay for demonstrated skills. Structured on-the-job training offers a cost-effective way to train and better link training to work processes. Work force education and training programs may need to utilize advanced technologies, such as electronic support systems, computer-based learning, and satellite broadcasts. Increasingly, training, development, and work organizations need to be tailored to a diverse work force and to more flexible, high performance work practices.<BR>

<P>Major challenges in the area of work force development include: (1) integration of human resource managementselection, performance, recognition, training, and career advancement; and (2) aligning human resource management with business plans and strategic change processes. Addressing these challenges requires acquisition and use of employee-related data on skills, satisfaction, motivation, safety, and well-being. Such data need to be tied to indicators of organization or unit performance, such as customer satisfaction, customer retention, and productivity. Through this approach, human resource management may be better integrated and aligned with business directions.<BR>

<P><B>Fast Response:  </B>Success in cutting red tape increasingly demands ever-shorter cycles for new or improved product and service introduction. Also, faster and more flexible response to customers is now a more critical requirement. Major improvement in response time often requires simplification of work organizations and work processes. To accomplish such improvement, the time performance of work processes should be among the key process measures. There are other important benefits derived from this focus: response time improvements often drive simultaneous improvements in organization, quality, and productivity. Hence it is beneficial to consider response time, quality, and productivity objectives together.  <BR>

<P><B>Design Quality and Prevention:  </B>Performance management should place strong emphasis on design qualityproblem and waste prevention achieved through building quality into products and services and efficiency into production and delivery processes. In general, costs of preventing problems at the design stage are much lower than costs of correcting problems that occur downstream.  Design quality includes the creation of fault-tolerant (robust) or failure-resistant processes and products.<BR>

<P>Increasingly, design quality includes the ability to incorporate information gathered from diverse sources and data bases, that combine factors such as customer preference, alternative offerings, societal changes, and external research findings and developments.  Therefore, an emerging  element of performance excellence is the strategic use of integrated information systems to enable electronic performance networking and to improve and measure mission performance. Government and industry alike face, and in many cases have solved, information management challenges by developing enterprise information systems; that is, systems that operate across entire organizations of unique and diverse functional elements<B>.</B>  <BR>

<P>From the point of view of public responsibility, the design stage is a critical decision point.  The government organizations responsibility is to be proactive; i.e., beyond compliance.   Design decisions affect process waste streams and the composition of municipal and industrial wastes. The growing demands for a cleaner environment mean that organization's design strategies need to include environmental factors.<BR>

<P>Consistent with the theme of design quality and prevention, improvement needs to emphasize interventions upstream at early stages in processes. This approach yields the maximum overall benefits of improvements and corrections. Such upstream intervention also needs to take into account the organization's suppliers.<BR>

<P><B>Long-Range View of the Future:  </B>Successful pursuit of an organization's goals and mission  requires a strong future orientation and a willingness to make long-term commitments to all stakeholderscustomers, employees, suppliers, the public, and the community.  Planning needs to anticipate many types of changes including those that may affect customers expectations of products and services, technological developments, changing customer segments, evolving regulatory requirements, community/societal expectations, and thrusts by alternative service and product providers.  Plans, strategies, and resource allocations need to reflect these commitments and changes. A major part of the long-term commitment is developing employees and suppliers and fulfilling public responsibilities.<BR>

<P><B>Management by Fact:  </B>Modern performance management systems depend upon measurement, data, information, and analysis. Measurements must derive from the organization's strategy and encompass all key processes and the outputs and results of those processes. Facts and data needed for performance improvement and assessment are of many types, including: customer, product and service performance, operations, market, competitive comparisons, supplier, employee-related, and cost and financial. Analysis refers to extracting larger meaning from data to support evaluation and decision making at all levels within the organization. Such analysis may entail using data to reveal informationsuch as trends, projections, and cause and effectthat might not be evident without analysis. Facts, data, and analysis support a variety of organization purposes, such as planning, reviewing organization performance, improving operations, and comparing organization performance with others working in similar environments or with best practices benchmarks.<BR>

<P>A major consideration in the use of data and analysis to improve performance involves the creation and use of performance measures or indicators. Performance measures or indicators are measurable characteristics of products, services, processes, and operations the organization uses to track and improve performance. The measures or indicators should be selected to best represent the factors that lead to improved customer, operational, and financial performance. A system of measures or indicators tied to customer and/or organization performance requirements represents a clear basis for aligning all activities with the organization's goals.  Through the analysis of data obtained from the tracking processes, the measures or indicators themselves may be evaluated and changed. For example, measures selected to track product and service quality may be judged by how well improvement in these measures correlates with improvement in customer satisfaction.<BR>

<P><B>Partnership</B> <B>Development:</B>  Organizations should seek to build internal and external partnerships to better accomplish their overall goals.<BR>

<P>Internal partnerships might include those that promote labor-management cooperation, such as agreements with unions. Agreements might entail employee development, cross-training, or new work organizations, such as high performance work teams. Internal partnerships might also involve creating new working relationships among organization units to improve flexibility and responsiveness.<BR>

<P>External partnerships might be with customers, suppliers, and education organizations for a variety of purposes, including education and training. An increasingly important kind of external partnership is the strategic partnership or alliance. A partnership might permit the blending of an organization's core competencies or leadership capabilities with complementary strengths and capabilities of partners, thereby enhancing accomplishment of each partners mission. Internal and external partnerships should seek to develop longer-term objectives. Partners should address the key requirements for success of the partnership, means of regular communication, approaches to evaluating progress, and means for adapting to changing conditions. In some cases, joint education and training could offer a cost-effective means to help ensure success.<BR>

<P><B>Corporate Responsibility and Citizenship:  </B>An organization's leadership should stress corporate responsibility and citizenship. Corporate responsibility refers to basic expectations of the organizationoperating ethics and protection of public health, safety, and the environment. Health, safety, and environmental considerations include the organization's operations as well as the life cycles of products and services. Organizations need to address factors such as resource conservation and waste reduction at their source. Planning related to public health, safety, and the environment should anticipate adverse impacts that may arise in facilities management, production, distribution, transportation, use and disposal of products. Plans should seek to prevent problems, to provide a forthright organization response if problems occur, and to make available information needed to maintain public awareness, safety, and confidence. Inclusion of public responsibility areas within a performance system means meeting all local, state, and federal laws and regulatory requirements. It also means treating these and related requirements as areas for continuous improvement beyond mere compliance. This requires that appropriate measures be created and used in managing performance.<BR>

<P>Corporate citizenship refers to leadership and supportwithin limits of an organization's resourcesof publicly important purposes, including areas of organization responsibility. Such purposes might include education improvement, improving health care value, environmental excellence, resource conservation, community services, improving operating practices, and sharing of non-sensitive quality-related information. Leadership as a corporate citizen also entails influencing other organizations, private and public, to partner for these purposes. For example, individual organizations could lead efforts to help define the obligations of other government entities to their communities.<BR>

<P><B>Results Orientation:  </B>An organization's performance system needs to focus on results. Results should be guided and balanced by the interests of all stakeholderscustomers, employees, suppliers and partners, the public, and the community. To meet the sometimes conflicting and changing aims that balance implies, organization strategy needs to explicitly address all stakeholder requirements to ensure that actions and plans meet the differing needs and avoid adverse impact on any stakeholders. The use of a balanced composite of performance measures offers an effective means to communicate requirements, to monitor actual performance, and to marshal support for improving results.  The government executive has the basic responsibility of balancing the necessity of being entrepreneurial with directed missions and functions.<BR>
 <BR>

<P><B>IX.   SUMMARY OF 1997 PRESIDENT'S QUALITY AWARD PROGRAM  CHANGES</B><BR>

<P>The President's Quality Award (PQA) Program continues to evolve toward comprehensive coverage of performance, addressing the needs and expectations of all stakeholders potential applicants, organizations applying the Awards' principles on their own (e.g., for self assessment), customers, employees, suppliers and the public.  The 1997 PQA Program reflects a recognition that the differences in best practices between the public and private sectors are becoming less clear, and further strengthen and integrate the high performance themes emphasized in the 1996 Program.<BR>

<P>The 1997 Application package incorporates management principles and practices that are consistent with those of major government-wide management improvement initiatives, particularly concerning customer service standards, strategic planning and performance measurement, financial management and information technology management systems and planning.  Also, numerous changes to the Application package were made so that it conforms more closely to standards of the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award, particularly those dealing with competitiveness, pricing and markets, concepts increasingly applicable to government.<BR>

<P>One of the most significant changes for 1997 impacting the application and examination process is to the system for scoring applications.  In the 1997 application review process, scores will be developed for each of the 24 Items as well as for the seven Categories.  This change has implications for a number of sections of the Application booklet.<BR>

<P>The following highlights specific changes in the 1997 PQA Program Application booklet resulting from the above and other improvements.<BR>
- A <I>Message to Federal Executives</I> was added to provide a broad perspective on the meaning of performance in the Award Criteria and on the larger benefits from participating in the Award process.<BR>
-  Category point values are more closely aligned to those of the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award.  The value of Business Results (Category 6) was increased (from 200 to 220 points) and slight downward adjustments were made in Leadership, Strategic Planning, and Human Resource Development and Management.<BR>
-  Point values were assigned to the 24 Criteria Items.  The values assigned to each Item are a proportional allocation of the Category scores in the PQA Program and correspond directly or very closely to the Item allocations in the Baldrige Award.<BR>
-  The <I>Scoring System and Guidelines</I> section was revised and includes the following changes and new material:<BR>
  -- guidance on Item-level scoring; <BR>
  -- more complete explanation of Approach, Deployment and Results;<BR>
  -- clarification of relevance and importance to scoring;<BR>
  -- explanation of the approach Examiners will take in assigning application scores;<BR>
     and<BR>
  -- modification of the Scoring Guidelines Summary to eliminate overlapping percentages.<BR>
 -  The detailed Scoring Guidelines contained in last years Application have been eliminated.  The use of Item-level scoring makes last years Guidelines inapplicable because they were designed for Category-level scoring.  Organizations which find the Category-level guidelines useful for their internal planning and assessments can refer to those contained in the 1996 Application Package.<BR>
  - An <I>Organization Overview and Criteria Response Guidance</I> section was added to help applicants and other users of the Award Criteria prepare responses that will support more thorough evaluation and better feedback, particularly at the Item level.  Particular emphasis is placed on helping applicants provide clear and complete information on Approach, Deployment and Results.  Also, specific guidance is provided to help applicants prepare a more comprehensive Organizational Overview.<BR>
  - The number of Criteria Items remains at 24, however, one Item was added to the Business Results Category (6.4), and two Items in the Customer Focus and Satisfaction Category (Items 7.4 and 7.5 in 1996) were combined creating a new Item (6.4).<BR>
  - A <I>Core Values and Concepts</I> section was added.  The section summarizes the values and concepts that constitute the foundation of the PQA Program.<BR>
 - A <I>Glossary of Key Terms</I> section was added to better define and help tie together the major performance themes of the Criteria.<BR>

<P>Applicants and other users of the Application package should note that some changes in wording have been made in many Items and Item Notes.  Major changes by category are:<BR>

<P><B>1.0  Leadership</B><BR>
Area 1.1b now calls for information on how senior executives evaluate and improve their own leadership skills.  Item 1.2 now has two Areas compared with three in 1996.  Areas 1.2a and 1.2b from 1996 were combined, thus better integrating communications with other related organizational requirements.  In addition, the Organization Performance Review Area (1.2b and 1.2c in 1996) is now more explicit in its requirements.  The Area now calls for non-financial and financial data related to the needs of all key stakeholders.  It also calls for information on tracking progress relative to plans, competitive performance, and productivity.<BR>

<P><B>2.0  Information and Analysis</B><BR>
Item 2.1 (Area 2.1a) now includes a requirement to provide information on the design of the organization's performance measurement system.  This change is intended to enhance the diagnostic value of the Item and strengthen the feedback to applicants.  Item 2.3(a) includes a requirement to analyze competitive performance.<BR>

<P><B>3.0  Strategic Planning</B><BR>
Major planning concepts, particularly those relevant to the private sector such as key business drivers, competitiveness, and other private sector terms were included.  Item 3.2(b) calls for comparisons to competitors or operational benchmarks.<BR>

<P><B>4.0  Human Resource Development and Management</B><BR>
The meaning of high performance work, the focus of Item 4.2, was included in the Glossary of Key Terms.  Linkage with results is emphasized by including an Item in Business Results (Item 6.3) for reporting all human resource results.<BR>

<P><B>5.0  Process Management</B><BR>
The meaning of process was included in the Glossary of Key Terms.<BR>

<P><B>6.0  Business Results</B><BR>
The Category makes clear that results should be compared to competitors or other similar organizations within or outside government.  A new Item, Human Resource Results (Item 6.3) was added.  This Item is intended to provide a better focus on and a more comprehensive treatment of the human resource results required by the Human Resource Development and Management Category.  In 1996, Human Resource Results were addressed in Item 6.2 (Organization Operational and Financial Results).<BR>

<P><B>7.0  Customer Focus and Satisfaction</B><BR>
Two 1996 Items (Customer Satisfaction Results and Customer Satisfaction Comparison) were combined.  The new Item (Customer Satisfaction Results) integrates the requirements included in the two 1996 Items.  The Category includes selected private-sector concepts.  Item 7.2(b) requires explanation of how complaints are analyzed and acted upon.<BR>

<P>
<P><B>X.  GLOSSARY OF KEY TERMS</B><BR>

<P>The Glossary of Key Terms defines and briefly describes concepts that are important to performance management and used throughout the Award Criteria.<BR>

<P><B>Alignment</B><BR>
Alignment refers to unification of goals throughout the organization and consistency of processes, actions, information, and decisions among organizational units in support of these goals.<BR>

<P>Effective alignment requires common understanding of purposes and goals and use of complementary measures and information to enable planning, tracking, analysis, and improvement at three levels:  the organization level, the key process level, and the work unit level.<BR>

<P><B>Benchmarking</B><BR>
Benchmarking is the continuous process of systematically comparing and measuring products, services, and processes against leading organizations to improve performance.  At its essence, benchmarking involves systematically looking at proven ways to provide better customer service and adapting these to the operations.  It turns the not-invented-here philosophy on its head, by focusing on the best practices of other organizations. <BR>

<P><B>Cycle Time</B><BR>
Cycle time refers to responsiveness and completion time measuresthe time required to fulfill commitments or to complete tasks.  Cycle time and related terms are used in the Award Criteria to refer to all aspects of time performance.<BR>

<P>Time measurements play a major role in the Award Criteria because of the great importance of time performance to improving competitiveness.  Other time-related terms in common use are:  set-up time, change-over time, delivery time, and time to market.<BR>

<P><B>High Performance Work</B><BR>
High performance work refers to work approaches systematically directed toward achieving ever higher levels of overall performance, including quality and productivity.<BR>

<P>Approaches to high performance work vary in form, function, and incentive systems.  Effective approaches generally include:  cooperation between management and the work force, including work force bargaining units; cooperation among work units, often involving teams; self-managed/self-directed responsibility (sometimes called empowerment); individual and organizational skill building and learning; flexibility in job design and work assignments; an organizational structure with minimum layering (flattened) where decision making is decentralized and decisions are made closest to the front line; and regular use of performance measures, including comparisons.  Some high performance work systems use monetary and nonmonetary incentives based upon factors, such as organizational performance, team and/or individual contributions, and skill building.  Also, some high performance work approaches attempt to align the design of organizations, work, jobs, and incentives.<BR>

<P>
<P><B>Key Business Drivers</B><BR>
Key business drivers is a term used in the Award Criteria in connection with strategic planning and related goal setting.  Key business drivers refer to principal organization-level requirements, derived from short- and long-term strategic planning.  Key business driver development represents the critical stage in planning when general strategies and goals are made sufficiently specific so that effective organization-wide understanding and ongoing action are possible.  In simplest terms, key business drivers are those things the organization must do well for its strategy to succeed.<BR>

<P>An effective planning approach results in a clear basis (key business drivers) for consistent focus, communications, and deployment at three levels:  the organization level, the key process level, and the work unit level.  Deployment of key business drivers requires analysis of overall resource needs and creation of aligned measures for all work units.  Deployment might require specialized training for some employees or recruitment of personnel.<BR>

<P>An example of a key business driver for a supplier in a highly competitive industry might be to develop and maintain a price leadership position.  Deployment should entail asset use, and creation of related measures of resource and asset productivity for all work units, aligned for the organization as a whole.  It might also involve adoption of a cost-accounting system that provides meaningful activity-level cost information to support day-to-day work.  Unit and/or team training should include priority setting based upon costs and benefits.  Organization-level analysis and review should emphasize overall productivity growth.  Ongoing competitive analysis and planning should remain sensitive to technological and other changes that might greatly reduce operating costs for the organization or its competitors.<BR>

<P><B>Leadership System</B><BR>
Leadership system refers to how leadership is exercised throughout the organizationthe way that key decisions are made, communicated, and carried out at all levels.  It is based upon shared values, expectations, and purposes; communicated and reinforced via interactions among leaders and managers; reflected in the decisions the leaders make; and evident in the actions of the organization.  It includes the formal and informal bases and mechanisms for leadership development used to select leaders and managers, to develop their leadership skills, and to provide guidance and examples regarding behaviors and practices.<BR>

<P>An effective leadership system creates clear values respecting the requirements of all stakeholders of the organization and sets high expectations for performance and performance improvement.  It builds loyalties and teamwork based upon the values and the pursuit of shared purposes.  It encourages and supports initiative and risk taking, subordinates organization to purpose and function, and minimizes reliance on chains of command that require long decision paths.  An effective leadership system includes mechanisms for the leaders' self-examination and improvement.<BR>

<P><B>Measures and Indicators</B><BR>
Measures and indicators refer to numerical information that quantify (measures) input, output, and performance dimensions of processes, products, and services.  Measures and indicators might be simple (derived from one measurement) or composite.<BR>

<P>The Award Criteria do not make a distinction between measures and indicators.  However, some users of these terms prefer the term indicator:  (1) when the measurement relates entirely to performance and not to inputs; (2) when the measurement relates to performance but is not a direct or exclusive measure of such performance (e.g., the number of complaints is an indicator of dissatisfaction, but not a direct or exclusive measure of it); and (3) when a performance or measure is a predictor (leading indicator) of some more significant performance (e.g., gain in customer satisfaction might be a leading indicator of increased demand).<BR>

<P><B>Performance</B><BR>
Performance refers to numerous results information obtained from processes, products, and services that permits evaluation and comparison relative to goals, standards, past results, and to others.  Most commonly, the results address quality, efficiency and time, and might be expressed on nonfinancial and financial terms.<BR>

<P>Four types of performance are addressed in the criteria:  (1) operational,  (2) product and service quality,  (3) customer-related, and  (4) financial.<BR>

<P>Operational performance refers to performance relative to effectiveness and efficiency measures and indicators.  Examples include cycle time, productivity, and waste reduction.  Operational performance might be measured at the work unit level, the key process level, and the organization level.  <BR>

<P>Product and service quality performance refers to performance relative to measures and indicators of product and service requirements derived from customer preference information.  Examples include reliability, on-time delivery, defect levels, and service response time.  Product and service quality performance generally relates to the organization as a whole.<BR>

<P>Customer-related performance refers to performance relative to measures and indicators of customers perceptions, reactions, and behaviors.  Examples include customer retention, complaints, customer survey results, and changes in demand for products and services.  Customer-related performance generally relates to the organization as a whole.<BR>

<P>Financial performance refers to performance using measures of cost and revenue.  Financial measures are generally tracked throughout the organization and are also aggregated to give organization-level, composite measures of performance, including cost-benefit and productivity.<BR>

<P><B>Performance Goal</B><BR>
Performance goal refers to a target level of performance expressed as a tangible, measurable objective against which actual achievement can be compared, including a goal expressed as a quantitative standard, value or rate.<BR>

<P><B>Process</B><BR>
Process refers to linked activities with the purpose of producing a product or service for a customer (user) within or outside the organization.  Generally, processes involve combinations of people, machines, tools, techniques, and materials in a systematic series of steps or actions.<BR>

<P>In some situations, process performance might require adherence to a specific sequence of steps, with documentation (sometimes formal) of procedures and requirements, including well-defined measurement and control steps.<BR>

<P>In many service situations, particularly when customers are directly involved in one or more steps of the service, process is used in a more general wayto spell out what must be done, possibly including a preferred or expected sequence.  If a sequence is critical, the service needs to include information for customers to help them understand and adhere to the sequence.  Service processes involving customers require guidance to the servers on handling contingencies related to differing circumstances and to customers' actions or behaviors.<BR>

<P>In some cases, such as strategic planning, research, and analysis, process does not necessarily imply formal sequences of steps. Rather, process implies general understandings regarding competent performance, such as timing, options to be included, evaluation, and reporting.  Sequences might arise as part of these understandings.<BR>

<P><B>Productivity</B><BR>
Productivity refers to measures of efficiency of the use of resources.  Although the term is often applied to single factors, such as manpower (labor productivity), machines, materials, energy, and capital, the productivity concept applies as well to the total resources consumed in producing outputs.  Overall productivityusually called total factor productivityis determined by combining the productivities of the different resources used for an output.  The combination usually requires taking a weighted average of the different single factor productivity measures, where the weights typically reflect costs of the resources.  The use of an aggregate measure such as total factor productive allows a determination of whether or not the net effect of overall changes in a processpossibly involving resource tradeoffsis beneficial.<BR>

<P>Effective approaches to performance management require understanding and measuring single factor and total factor productivity, particularly in complex cases when there are a variety of costs and potential benefits.<BR>
