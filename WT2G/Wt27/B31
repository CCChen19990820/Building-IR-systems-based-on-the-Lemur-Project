Dunston, University of Washington, <br>S. "Ranji" Ranjithan and Leonhard E. Bernold, North Carolina State University</h3><font size=4><i>Automating the process of cold-bending steel reinforcing bars forconcrete structures can save time, prevent serious injuries, andincrease productivity. Neural network models can play a key role inthe adaptive control of this process.</i></font><P>Operational objectives such as just-in-time (JIT) production anddelivery of materials have fostered the need for real-time control ofconstruction processes. Intelligent, adaptive control models areneeded to automate these construction tasks. One such task is the coldbending of steel reinforcing bars, called <i>rebars</i>. This task involvesaccurately deforming a material, with variable mechanical properties,into a specified shape for a reinforced concrete structure.<P>The traditionally manual process, performed with a table bender, istedious and can involve serious and sometimes permanentinjuries. Moreover, frequent pauses for setup and recalibration of therebar bending machine with each new bundle of rebars hampersproductivity.<P>An automated intelligent-control process, suitable for handlingmaterial with inherently variable properties, can alleviate some ofthese problems. Two options are available for modeling the materialbehavior: the more traditional empirical statistical approach and anapproach that uses a machine-learning technology such as a neuralnetwork. In this article, we explain why a neural network is anappropriate choice and how it can be used to predict springback-thevariable elastic recovery after rebar bending.<P><h2>The need for control accuracy</h2>To automate rebar bending, we must model this cold forming process sothat it accurately responds to variable material properties. A primarymeasure of quality in rebar fabrication is bending accuracy. Theelastic properties of reinforcing steel result in springback, asFigure 1 illustrates. When a rebar specimen is bent, unbalancedstresses in the steel cause an elastic recovery once the rebar isreleased. This phenomenon represents the major obstacle in automatingthe bending task.<P><img src = "x40451.gif"><P><b>Figure 1. Springback in a 90&#176; bend.</b><P>Although researchers have studied springback in the context of othermetal forming processes, no documented research specifically addressesspringback in rebar bending. (<a href = "#1">1-3</a>) Existinganalytical models predict springback in other cold bending operationswhere the workpiece dimensions and properties are more preciselycontrolled. But surface deformations on the rebar and unique toolarrangements severely limit the application of these models to thisproblem. A first step in achieving accurate automated rebar-bendingcontrol is to establish a means of modeling the rebar behavior topredict springback.<P><h2>Machine learning and neural networks</h2>The classical approach to control relies on extensive knowledge of theproblem domain and on the condition that all significant parametersare known, measurable, and accounted for in the control laws. Aproblem occurs, however, when a new condition arises that is eithernot considered by the control program or too complex for modeling. Thecontrol program, which has no way of recognizing the inadequacy of itssolution, cannot respond to the new parameter. Meeting the challengeof rebar bending requires a truly adaptive controller that can adjustits prediction via machine learning. One option, a neural network,represents one of the more active research areas in machinelearning.<P><h2>Neural network features</h2>The design of neural networks is loosely based on the idealizedrepresentation of biological neural connections.(<a href="#4">4</a>) Figure 2 shows thegeneric structure of a multilayered neural network. Individual nodesor units receive input values from either the external environment <i>I<font size=-2>i</i></font>or from nodes in a preceding hidden layer in the network environment <i>O<font size=-2>j</i></font>. Theindependent nodes are linked to each other through weights (<i>w<font size=-2>ij</font>, w<font size=-2>jk</font></i>),which determine the connection's strength or the <i>signal</i> betweennodes. The overall weight structure represents the network's knowledgeand determines its output. The neural network assigns and reassignsweights as it goes through its learning phase, which it accomplishesby introducing data from cases with known solutions.<P><img src = "x40452.gif"><P><b>Figure 2. Generic structure of a multilayered neural network.</b><P>Four characteristics make neural networks suitable for springbackprediction. First, they continually learn when an operation routinelyrequires adjustment to changes in hardware and stock material. Second,their insensitivity to noise is particularly useful in heavyindustrial applications. Third, their real-time capability for makingdecisions on the basis of operational data avoids processdelays. Finally, a neural network's capacity for generalization lets acontroller recognize classes of steel that exhibit similar magnitudesof springback. These strengths should enable a well-designed neuralnetwork to efficiently handle the numerous variables present in thecold bending of rebars.<P><h2>Real-time data from the bending operation</h2>Real-time adaptive control requires up-to-the-moment data collectionfor monitoring and decision making. Figure 3 compares the time-seriesbending-torque data from two 90&#176; bends of the same rebar. The primaryfeatures of interest observed in both curves are the initial elasticbending, the yield torque, the maximum bending torque, and thespringback. Different rebar orientations account for the distinctdifferences in maximum bending load and curve shape. The distinctridges in one of the two curves stem from surface deformations, andindicate the rebar's orientation. (<a href="#5">5,6</a>)<P><img src = "x40453.gif"><P><b>Figure 3. Pattern features in the bending torque curve.</b><P>The bending-torque data and the bending angle, when analyzed in realtime, provide a moving picture of the reinforcing steel's bendingbehavior, which is critical to predicting the springback for theindividual bend. A classical mathematical approach would requireextensive knowledge of the variables contributing to springback and anability to recognize features in the bending torque data representingsuch variables. Neural networks can analyze, in real time, thebending-torque data for feature patterns that a classical (empirical)approach might not recognize.<P>Certain known variables and feature values measured from the datastream can serve as inputs to the neural network. In addition, tocapitalize on the neural network's strength for pattern recognitionand generalization, the initial segment of the data stream can serveas a source of additional inputs to the network. With this approach,springback prediction can include relevant factors or patternsunrecognized by the human programmer and unavailable to a human benderoperator.<P><h2>Developing the neural network</h2>We selected an adaptive learning strategy for training the networkused in this application. This strategy uses an algorithm thatintegrates the Quickprop learning scheme discussed by Scott Fahlmanand the dynamic node-creation concepts discussed by Tim Ash, ScottFahlman, and Christian Lebiere.(a href="#7">7-9</a>)In this learning strategy, we firstset the number of hidden units to a low number (two in each hiddenlayer). If the network can't achieve a given error tolerance after aspecified number of cycles, the algorithm (neural network software)lets the user increase the number of nodes in the hidden layers andcontinue training. During this process, the algorithm sets the weightsof the new connections to random values, and the weights of theexisting connections continue from the previous values. We alsoadaptively increase the number of training cases presented to thenetwork. We initially present only a small set of cases and train thenetwork until it achieves the desired error tolerance. Then weincrease the number of training cases and repeat the above processuntil we've successfully trained the network for all the cases.<P>This incremental, adaptive learning process determines an appropriatenumber of hidden nodes, defining a network configuration that canlearn the springback prediction process. This adaptive learningstrategy eliminates the need for a computationally intensivetrial-and-error process, which would involve iteratively changing thenumber of hidden nodes with no carry-over information about existingconnection weights. Furthermore, such an adaptive scheme is useful forupdating an existing network as additional training cases becomeavailable.<P><h2>Experiments with a shop bender</h2>We equipped a large table bender with electronic sensors forcollecting real-time data during laboratory bend tests. The photographin Figure 4 shows the mounted positions of a load cell (lowerforeground) and an optical encoder (upper background), which we usedfor measuring bending torque and bending angle, respectively. Acomputer collected these real-time measurements for subsequentanalysis and testing.<P><img src = "x40454.gif"><P><b>Figure 4. Table bender equipped with sensors for measuring bendingload and angle in real time.</b><P>We performed test bends using a scheme that varied the parameters ofbar orientation, bending angle, and rebar size. They bent each bar atseveral locations along its length-each bend at a different angle(45&#176;, 90&#176;, 135&#176;, and 180&#176;). We organized a statistically based testingscheme, best described as an unbalanced block design, to test twobatches for each of three rebar sizes. The technicians executed thetest design once for each bar size, and then repeated it with rebarsfrom new batches of steel, so that the overall size of the data setwas 144 samples.<P>We selected bending accuracy, in the form of the difference betweenthe predicted and measured springback angle, as the comparativemeasure. We used an industry standard of &#177;2.5&#176;,normally applied to only 90&#176; hooks and bends, as a minimum-levelcriterion for evaluating the performance of an individual controlmodel for any bending angle.<P>An empirical prediction model for comparison. Previous experience witha laboratory prototype table bender, as well as other reportedresearch, indicated that a statistically based empirical model forspringback prediction could be developed for specific machine-toolsetups. (a href="#10">10</a> We hypothesized that this approach could determinesignificant parameters in rebar bending and could quantify theireffects and that a neural network model would compare favorably withsuch an empirical model.<P>We have recorded and statistically analyzed several parameters fortheir value in predicting springback. Given the specific shop-bendermachine setup and the data obtained, the final and most successfulstatistical model, which we applied as a general equation for rebarsizes #4, #6, and #8, had the following form:<P>In this equation, represents the bending angle, the rebar size, andthe parameter coefficients whose values are unique to the machine-toolsetup. The final squared term relates to the nonlinear effect ofchanging rebar sizes.<P>Using the same division of data for training and testing, we alsoformulated an alternative, size-specific empirical springback modelthat was independent of the general equation. The resulting equationwas a reduction of the general model, as follows:<P>The neural network prediction model. Figure 5 illustrates ourbackpropagation-type neural network for springback prediction. Thenetwork’s input layer had 20 nodes: 15 for load valuescorresponding to integer bending angles from 0 to 14&#176;, and one eachfor rebar size, target bending angle, elastic slope, the estimatedyield torque, and a bias node (input = 1). The next two hidden layerscomprised seven and six layers, respectively. The (final) output layercontained a single node, representing the springback angle. Wedetermined the number of nodes in the hidden layers using theaforementioned training procedure.<P><img src = "x40455.gif"><P><b>Figure 5. Structure of a neural network for springback prediction.</b><P>We achieved the best neural network performance when we combined thecases for different rebar sizes, thus obtaining a larger trainingset. Training used two-thirds of the total 144 data sets, and wetested network performance with the remaining sets. We basedcomparisons with the statistical models on the same division of thedata as for model development and testing. Figure 6 summarizes thedetails of the neural network training. Because we had to normalizethe data for input into the neural network, the error percentages inFigure 6 represent results from normalized data and do not applydirectly to the actual springback measurements.<P><table><tr><td>Number of training cases</td><td>96</td></tr><tr><td>Constraint error (normalized)</td><td>1%</td></tr><tr><td>Final network configuration</td><td>20-7-6-1</td></tr><tr><td>Training cycles with final configuration</td><td>100,000</td></tr><tr><td>Final maximum error (normalized)</td><td>7%</td></tr><tr><td>Final root-sum-of-squares (RSS) error (normalized)</td><td>2%</td></tr></table><b>Figure 6. Summary of neural network training information.</b><P><h2>Comparative evaluation of shop-bender control models</h2>Figure 7 compares the neural network model springback predictions withthe actual springback. The springback prediction error demonstrated bythe neural network performed remarkably well with respect to theobjective range of &#177;2.5&#176;. The prediction error fell outside this rangein only one test case. Table 1 shows how the performance of thebackpropagation neural network compared with that of the two empiricalmodels. The minimum negative and maximum positive errors describe howthe range of error compared with the objective, while theroot-mean-squared (RMS) error represents the average error in absoluteterms. From a practical standpoint, let us consider these calculatedmeasures significant to only one-half-degree precision.<P><img src = "x40457.gif"><P><b>Figure 7. Performance of neural network model.</b><P>Table 1. Error feedback in the neural network versus the statisticalmodels.<P><table><tr><th>Model</th><th>Maximum negative error (degrees)</th><th>Maximum positive error (degrees)</th><th>Mean error (degrees)</th><th>Standard deviation of error (degrees)</th><th>Root-mean-squared error (degrees)</th></tr><tr><td>Neural network predictor</td><td align = right>4.3</td><td align = right>1.5</td><td align = right>-0.6</td><td align = right>1.2</td><td align = right>1.4</td></tr><tr><td>General predictor</td><td align = right>3.0</td><td align = right>2.7</td><td align = right>-0.1</td><td align = right>1.4</td><td align = right>1.4</td></tr><tr><td>Size-specific predictor</td><td align = right>3.0</td><td align = right>2.4</td><td align = right>-0.1</td><td align = right>1.3</td><td align = right>1.3</td></tr></table>The RMS errors of 1.4&#176; and 1.3&#176; (see Table 1) indicate similarperformance between all three models; the range of error was about thesame in each case. Mean error was nearly 0&#176; for both statisticalmodels. Therefore, applying the absolute measure of standarddeviation, about 95% (two standard deviations) of the springbackpredictions were within 2.6&#176; of the actual springback for thesize-specific model and within 2.8&#176; for the general model. Theseresults compare quite well with the objective range.<P>The neural network model demonstrated less of a central tendency inits prediction performance, as implied by its error range andconfirmed by its mean error being about a half degree below zero(compare with Figure 7). This deviation of the mean error from zeroimplies a systematic discrepancy in the neural network'spredictions. The cause of this discrepancy was difficult toconclusively assess and remains unexplained, because the knowledgecontained in the neural network is not transparent. Furthermore,selective examination of the data also failed to reveal the cause ofthe discrepancy. Hence, more controlled tests are necessary todetermine the cause of this apparent systematic underestimation ofspringback.<P>Despite the systematic deviation, however, the smaller standarddeviation of 1.2&#176; does indicate favorable performance, with about 95%of the test cases falling between -3.0&#176;  and +1.8&#176;  from the targetbending angle. In a practical sense, because virtually none of thetest cases indicated overcompensation for springback, we could remedythe few cases of undercompensation through a standard adjustment oranother bending cycle, as long as the automated bender has a capacityfor measuring the final bending angle.<P><h2>Implications of test results</h2>As pointed out in the comparative analysis, the mean error and thestandard deviation of error are useful indicators of how close a modelcomes to achieving satisfactory bends. If a systematic deviationoccurs, as it did with our neural network model, we can make astandard adjustment, even though we don't know the source of thediscrepancy.<P>Alternatively, the apparent tendency to underestimate springback mightrequire another bending cycle. This alternative for achieving qualitybends is not desirable, however, because it consumes a lot of time andenergy resources. Slight overestimation resulting in overbending isnot usually a critical problem. In practice, a small overbend in thefinished product is more acceptable than not bending far enough.<P>Although the neural network model performed quite well considering thenumber of variables and the relatively small units of the qualitymeasure, it did not conclusively (100%) meet the qualitycriteria. Moreover, in an indirect comparison, the network did notout-perform a highly skilled human operator. One day spent randomlymonitoring the accuracy of bends produced by a skilled master benderoperator revealed that human accuracy tended to fall below theobjective criteria only when the person attempted complex bendpatterns. When specifications called for numerous bends on one rebar,especially in different planes, quality fell below the objectiverange.<P>THESE FACTS IMPLY THAT THE MOST PRACTICAL approach to control is ahuman-in-the-loop control strategy where a skilled operator and anautomated controller share control responsibilities. A logicalextension of our research would be to conduct field tests thatincorporate such a human-machine interface, where the neural network'sfunction could extend from predicting springback to controlling themachine operation. This type of shared-control scenario also raisesthe question of how knowledge of real-time sensor measurements wouldimpact the operator's judgment.<P>Because bending accuracy depends on some factors that are eitherunknown or hidden from the user, a rebar-bending controller that canlearn is desirable. Variables such as the wearing of machine parts orchanges in the production source of stock material would likelygenerate a need to periodically refit the model. Therefore,researchers should test neural networks for their long-termperformance under these conditions.<P><b>Acknowledgments</B><P>We thank the KRB Machinery Co. and the Florida Steel Corp. for theirsupport of this research through contributions of materials andequipment.<P><b>References</b><P><ol><a name = "1"><li>G.

(<a href="#2">2</a>)Over the years, the conference has had a large participationthroughout the world, with about 70% of the papers coming from the USand 30% from the rest of the world. Historically, participation hascome from both universities and industry.<P>In 1995, conference participants presented 45 papers (of which 40 werepublished in the proceedings) and 12 poster papers (full papers werealso published in the proceedings). There were 101 authors andcoauthors of the 40 published and presented papers. Authors forroughly 90% of those papers came from academic organizations and 10%from industry, representing organizations from nine countries:Australia (9), Canada (6), France (8), Japan (10), Norway (2),Singapore (2), Taiwan (5), UK (6), and the US (55).<P>Of the 40 published papers, we are featuring five as a special AIApplications track in this and the current and the following twoissues of <i>IEEE Expert.</i> Each received "outstanding" recommendationsfrom its three reviewers.<P><ul><li>C.W. Liew's "Using Feedback to Improve VLSI Designs" describes a newtechnique called <i>constrained redo</i> that uses feedback to improve thepower and coverage of an existing system for VLSI design. Typicalknowledge-based expert systems are static, incorporating large amountsof domain-specific knowledge to generate good initialsolutions. However, these systems cannot use information generatedfrom analysis of the solutions to provide improved solutions. As aresult, the authors use an approach that is part of thefeedback-directed optimization framework to help generate improveddesigns.<P><li>Chih-Hung Wu and Shie-Jue Lee's "Knowledge Verification with anEnhanced High-Level Petri Net Model" uses enhanced high-level Petrinets to model rule-based systems. After modeling the system as a Petrinet, their approach uses <i>markings</i> to facilitate verification of thesystem by determining redundancy, subsumption, conflict, cycles, andunnecessary conditions.<P><li>Jonathan Lee, Lein F. Lai, and Wei T. Huang's "Conceptual Graphs as aBasis for Expressing Task-Based Specifications" identifies severalissues for mapping a task-based specifications methodology intoconceptual graphs, including representation of constraints and statemodeling, rigid versus soft post conditions, and the distinction andexistence of different operators used to model specifications. Inparticular, the authors propose using conceptual graphs to expresstask specifications in which the specifications are driven by the taskstructure of the problem-solving knowledge. The approach permitsverification of specification representations.<P><li>Timothy Lenz, James K. McDowell, Martin C. Hawley, Ahmed Kamel, andJon Sticklen's "A Decision Support Architecture for Polymer CompositesDesign: Implementations and Evolution," a multidisciplinary study,develops an architecture for a knowledge-based system for polymercomposite material design. The authors use the generic task approachto develop an intelligent support system for polymer design. Theytrace the evolution of multiple systems designed to assist decisionmaking, and contrast the different versions of the systems. Throughoutthe growth and development of the material design methodology, theoverall vision for polymer composites design has evolved as well.<P><li>James Mayfield, Marty Hall, and Tim Finin's "Using AutomaticMemoization as a Software Engineering Tool in Real World AI Systems"describes how memoization can be made viable on a large scale. Memofunctions and memoization refer to the tabulation of results of a setof calculations to avoid repeating the calculations.

However, thecomplexity of most AI constructs makes this impractical, forcing usto rely on the same experimental approach that has been so useful inthe natural sciences. Many of the same issues and methods applydirectly to AI systems, including the need to identify clearly one'sdependent and independent variables, the importance of carefulexperimental design, and the need to average across random variablesoutside one's control.</P><P>However, beyond these obvious features, a compelling experimentalstudy of intelligent behavior must satisfy two additional criteria:it must have <I>relevance</I> and it must produce <I>insight</I>. Iwill illustrate these ideas with examples from machine learning, oneof the most experimentally oriented subfields within artificialintelligence. Moreover, because AI researchers are often concernedwith extending some existing method to improve its behavior, I willfocus on this paradigm.</P><P>An experimental study of AI methods has relevance if it hasimplications for problems on which those methods will be used inpractice. Researchers can best satisfy this criterion by runningtheir experiments on <I>natural</I> domains from the real world. Forexample, in the machine-learning community, most papers reportexperimental results on data sets from the repository at theUniversity of California, Irvine, a collection of files that containdata on a variety of natural classification tasks, such as medicaldiagnosis. Experiments with natural domains are essential becauseextensions to existing algorithms, although intuitively plausible,often make little difference in practice. Consider the naive Bayesianclassifier, a simple learning method that uses training data toestimate the conditional probabilities of attribute values given theclass. Because naive Bayes assumes that each attribute isconditionally independent, given the class, it would seem easy toimprove it by using more sophisticated methods. However, experimentsrun by both Igor Kononenko and myself revealed little or noimprovement with extensions to naive Bayes on a number of real-worlddata sets.<A HREF="#2">(2,3)</A> Those studies, although givingnegative results, were relevant in that they tested our intuitions onnatural domains.</P><P>However, experimental studies on natural domains alone do notsatisfy our insight criterion. The machine-learning community, inparticular, has come to rely almost exclusively on experiments thatcompare alternative methods on a variety of standard domains (20 orso data sets from the UCI repository), then conclude that onetechnique or another is superior because it fares better on most ofthe domains. Such "bake-offs" tell us very little about the reasonsfor results, and thus do not provide the understanding about causesthat we expect in science.</P><P>Researchers can best obtain insight by running experiments onsynthetic domains that have been designed to test explicithypotheses, typically motivated by the intuitions behind the originalextension. For example, I have reported experiments on syntheticdomains that involve target concepts with disjoint decision regions,which violate another assumption made by naiveBayes.<A HREF="#3">(3)</A> The importance of using synthetic domainsis not because they let one generate some new task, but because theylet one vary systematically some dimension of interest, and thus testhypotheses about the conditions under which one method will farebetter than another. Of course, by themselves, studies with syntheticdomains do not ensure relevance; my study found major differencesbetween naive Bayes and its extension on the predicted syntheticdomains, but these differences did not carry over to real-worldinduction tasks.</P><P>Thus, truly compelling studies, in machine learning and elsewhere,will include experiments on both natural and synthetic domains, thefirst to establish relevance and the second to achieve insight.Ideally, they will also <I>relate</I> the findings in the two typesof study. For instance, if one finds the same shape of results (saywhen varying some other factor, such as number of training cases) ina synthetic and natural domain, this suggests that the natural domainhas similar characteristics to the synthetic one. This strategy letsone move beyond causal accounts in artificial domains toward reasonsfor success or failure in natural ones, thus giving relevance andunderstanding at the same time.</P><P>Of course, insights about the sources of an algorithm's power areas important as insights about the effects of domain characteristics.Thus, a well-rounded experimental paper will also include lesionstudies, which remove algorithm components to determine theircontribution, and studies that examine sensitivity to specificparameter settings. Experiments that systematically vary externalresources, such as the number of training cases available forlearning, should also play a role in any complete empirical study.These recommendations are not new; Dennis Kibler and I proposed theseresearch strategies in an early paper on the experimental study oflearning,<A HREF="#4">(4)</A> and Paul Cohen makes a broader case fortheir use with any intelligent system.<A HREF="#5">(5)</A></P><P>I have drawn my examples from machine learning, but the same basicarguments hold across AI. Research on planning, natural language,diagnosis, perception, and robotics would all benefit from a morebalanced mixture of experiments. Although some work along these linesexists, papers in every AI subfield would be more compelling if theyincluded systematic experiments designed with both relevance andinsight in mind. I encourage AI researchers to take both of thesecriteria into account in their experimental evaluations, and thus tospeed progress toward the day when our field becomes a true scienceof the artificial.</P><b>References</b><P><A NAME="1"></A></P><P>1.

In this context,they must</P><P> </P><OL><LI>select a machine-learning tool suited to the task,</LI><LI>set the parameters that control the tool's behavior, and </LI><LI>run the tool, analyze the results, and stop or return to steps 1 or2.</LI><P> </P></OL><P>Running this loop might often be difficult and tedious. Selecting theappropriate tool might take time, and finding parameter settings well-suitedto the problem's characteristics might also be time-consuming and difficult.Systems that provide a family of learning algorithms in a unified, ratherthan a single environment, can lessen this loop's complexity and duration.</P><P> </P><H3>Configurable machine-learning systems</H3><P>An initial solution to these problems has emerged from the Esprit MachineLearning Toolbox Project. (<A HREF="#1">1</A>) This project has implementeda tool box that gathers a set of machine-learning tools within a unifyingglobal framework. The framework defines a common language for inputs andoutputs; a <I>consultant</I>, implemented as an expert system, helps usersselect algorithms suited to their specific needs.</P><P> Although this system makes valuable progress, the integration levelof the different algorithms is weak. Also, its building blocks are verylarge (full-fledged learning systems), and user support is relatively feeble,considering the great variety of learning systems available. This approachworks well only for experienced users who know the properties of the differenttools and are willing to experiment with a variety of learning techniques.</P><P> <B>Accessing a family of learning algorithms.</B> We are working ona different approach that offers increased user support, while restrictingthe range of available learning techniques. Our work aims at implementinga machine-learning tool that provides access to a family of generate-and-test(G&amp;T) learning algorithms. It also allows users to configure graphicallydifferent variations of algorithms and control parameters for those algorithms(called <I>biases</I> in the machine-learning community). </P><P>Such a tool offers two advantages:</P><P> </P><UL><LI><I>Adaptability</I>: Depending on their goals and the nature of theavailable input information, users can assemble a set of learning proceduressuited to a problem's characteristics and instantiate the definition ofthe control parameters. This approach greatly simplifies experimentationwith different learning algorithms.</LI><P> </P><LI><I>Simplicity and homogeneity</I>: Users configure a given learningsystem by assembling a set of predefined learning operations and instantiatingbiases related to the selected components. The unified graphical notationrepresenting the possible decompositions of each learning algorithm steplets users graphically specify a given configuration intuitively.</LI><P> </P></UL><P>User-interaction support relies on a knowledge-level model of the G&amp;Tsystems. Our knowledge-level model provides both the set of modeling formalismsfor representing the family of algorithms and the set of graphical notationsfor interacting with the user. Users-knowledge engineers who would liketo use a learning system to develop their knowledge-based applicationsfaster or more reliably-choose a specific learning model by selecting high-levellearning operations and setting appropriate control parameters. </P><P>(Please see the <A HREF="#context">Context sidebar</A>.)</P><P> <B>Knowledge-level models.</B> We maintain that complex learning systems,like any complex apparatus or computer program, should provide the userwith some information about the way they perform and, consequently, someway to customize them to meet user needs. Walter Van de Velde and AgnarAamodt have discussed the knowledge level's adequacy for this purpose andfor comparing learning methods and eliciting implicit (control) knowledge.(<A HREF="#2">2</A>)</P><P> Because modeling machine-learning systems\ processes at the knowledgelevel is a very ambitious task, we address a limited class of learningsystems (as opposed to machine-learning techniques). We do not claim toprovide a complete guide of biases for such learning systems. But we doexpect to provide better support and smaller-grained adaptation capability.The knowledge-level model should also enable us to provide simpler, moreefficient user interaction. Finally, our knowledge-level model will provideeasier access to, and understanding of, the addressed machine-learningtechniques.</P><P> </P><H3>Modeling generate-and-test learning systems</H3><P>The machine-learning systems discussed here learn to define a targetconcept <I>TC</I> from <I>TC</I> examples and background knowledge representinga partial domain model of the application domain. The target concept'sfinal definition usually must be complete (it should cover all positiveexamples of the target concept) and correct (it should not cover any negativeexamples).</P><P> We focus here on machine-learning systems that use a G&amp;T strategyaccording to Tom Mitchell's definition. (<A HREF="#3">3</A>) Roughly speaking,G&amp;T learning systems first generate hypotheses for the target conceptby following a learning strategy independent from the yet-observed <I>TC</I>examples. The system then validates these hypotheses against examples ofthe target concept. The G&amp;T strategy is adapted (although not restricted)to incremental learning situations such that examples of the target conceptare not available at once and therefore must be carefully acquired froma user. (<A HREF="#4">4</A>) , (<A HREF="#5">5</A>)</P><P> <B>Selected formalism.</B> The objects to be represented are the learningoperations and their parameters and connections. For complex learning operations,we also need to represent their various possible decompositions. (Constraintson admissible ways to assemble learning operations and to set parametersfor a given assembly of learning operations regarding a specific knowledge-acquisitiontask also must be represented, but that is outside the scope of this discussion.)We represent the learning models at the knowledge level using an extensionof the CommonKADS notations. (<A HREF="#6">6</A>), (<A HREF="#7">7</A>)We designed these models using KADS-Tool,6 a case tool that supports theCommonKADS method, extended to the decomposition of inference steps.</P><P> We relied primarily on two formalisms:</P><P> </P><UL><LI>A <I>task decomposition tree</I> that graphically represents the possibledecompositions of the learning procedures into subtasks; a specific notationmakes explicit the possible alternatives while decomposing a task.</LI><P> </P><LI>A <I>inference structure</I> notation that provides a simple meansfor expressing the dataflow in a task's decomposition. It also providesa notation for specifying the configuration parameters to set during configuration.These entities are the data used by the configurer. The configurer's outputrepresents the resulting learning system, which is a set of connected learningoperations with values for the associated control parameters.</LI><P> </P></UL><P>To describe G&amp;T systems at the knowledge level, we adopt a problem-solvingview of machine learning first introduced by Mitchell.3 This approach viewslearning as a search for an appropriate definition of the target conceptin a set of candidate definitions for <I>TC</I>. For the rest of this discussion,we call a (partial) candidate definition for <I>TC</I> a hypothesis anddenote the search space for a learning algorithm as <I>HS</I>.</P><P> The learning task represented by the inference structure of Figure1 decomposes into two subtasks: computing an initial representation for<I>HS</I> and searching <I>HS</I>. These subtasks (represented by doubleellipses in the figure) further decompose. Single ellipses would representa terminal task, whose behavior is not modeled at a finer grain.</P><P> <IMG SRC="x40501.gif" HEIGHT=180 WIDTH=318></P><P>Figure 1. The problem-solving view of empirical learning.</P><P> The learning task takes two inputs-the domain theory and the sourceof examples-and produces the target concept definition. The two inputsand the output (represented as simple rectangles) illustrate the dataflowbetween the learning operations.</P><P> The language bias, which defines the allowed language for the targetconcept, mainly controls the computation of the initial representationof <I>HS</I> (not detailed here). To a lesser extent, this computationis also controlled by a search bias that defines the direction of the searchthrough <I>HS</I>-that is, whether the search of <I>HS</I> will go fromspecific to general or vice versa.</P><P> Search biases control the search process in <I>HS</I>. This processincludes criteria to guide the search through <I>HS</I> as well as criteriato assess a search path through <I>HS</I>. The learning process loops onthose two tasks until learning succeeds with regard to the validation bias,or until learning fails.</P><P> </P><H3>Bias decomposition</H3><P>In introducing a decomposition of biases for G&amp;T algorithms (Figure2), we illustrate the role of each bias by commenting on the decompositionof the Search <I>HS</I> inference structure. For all biases, we providea list of typical instantiations in G&amp;T systems, as well as some (yetinformal) rules about how to tune them to meet a user's goals.</P><P> <IMG SRC="x40502.gif" HEIGHT=267 WIDTH=412></P><P>Figure 2. Decomposition of bias for G&amp;T systems.</P><P> There are several possible decompositions of the Search <I>HS</I> inferencestructure, depending primarily on the chosen representation for <I>HS</I>(see Figure 3). We detail here the decomposition of Search <I>HS</I> underthe following assumption: a generality relation (a partial ordering) ofthe <I>HS</I> hypotheses is explicitly given. With this generality relationship,<I>HS</I> is represented by one of its upper or lower bounds-that is, theset of most specific or most general hypotheses of <I>HS</I>. We denotethis bound as <I>CBD</I> (current best definition). </P><P><IMG SRC="x40503.gif" HEIGHT=200 WIDTH=304></P><P>Figure 3. Decomposition of the Compute <I>CBD</I> alteration. </P><P>Language bias. The language bias defines the language used to expressthe target concept. This includes</P><P> Restrictions on the syntax and vocabulary of hypotheses of <I>HS</I>.For instance, if the target concept language is a restriction of first-orderlogic, the language bias might specify constraints on the maximum numberof literals in the body of hypotheses, or restrictions on variables occurringin the hypotheses (Claire NÚdellec extensively surveys common languagebiases used by the inductive logic programming community (<A HREF="#8">8</A>)).</P><P> Syntax of the target concept. The target concept language might beconjunctive; in this case, the final <I>TC</I> definition must containa single hypothesis that has to satisfy the stopping criterion. If thetarget concept language is disjunctive, the final <I>TC</I> definitionis a set of hypotheses whose conjunction satisfies the stopping criterion.</P><P> The language bias acts statically when defining the initial representationfor <I>HS</I> and dynamically during the search (see Figures 4 and 5).During search, it can be used to check that the successive alterationsof the bound of the search space generated by the learning operator satisfythe language bias.</P><P> <IMG SRC="x40504.gif" HEIGHT=135 WIDTH=470></P><P>Figure 4. Decomposition of the inference Generate candidate alterationsof <I>CBD</I>.</P><P> <IMG SRC="x40505.gif" HEIGHT=182 WIDTH=472></P><P>Figure 5. Generation of candidate alterations of the current best definition.</P><P> Search bias. In the search process model in Figure 3, the learningsystem modeled represents the search space <I>HS</I> by one of its bounds,<I>CBD</I>. Learning thus proceeds by successive allocations of <I>CBD</I>through a learning operator. The process first builds candidate <I>CBD</I>alterations by applying a learning operator (Figure 4). Then it checksthe validity of the generated alterations against examples of the targetconcept (Figure 6).</P><P> <IMG SRC="x40506.gif" HEIGHT=261 WIDTH=304></P><P>Figure 6. Validity checking of candidate <I>CBD</I> alterations.</P><P> Because an explicit generality relation is available to such learningsystems, dynamic pruning of <I>HS</I> might occur during search. For example,when the learning direction is bottom-up and when a given <I>CBD</I> isnot validated against examples of <I>TC</I>, all hypotheses more generalthan <I>CBD</I> are also incorrect and must be ignored during the learningprocess. Such failed hypotheses must be stored in the learning session'sarchive for use as a filter for further alterations of <I>CBD</I> (seeFigures 5 and 6). The search biases are the central control of G&amp;Tsystems; a strategy independent from observed examples of <I>TC</I> mustguide the search.</P><P> Learning direction. A G&amp;T learning session modifies <I>CBD</I>by applying a learning operator taken from a list of generalization orspecialization operators. If it selects a generalization operator, thesystem will search <I>HS</I> from specific hypotheses to more general ones;<I>CBD</I> will therefore be a lower bound for <I>HS</I>. Conversely, ifit selects a specialization operator, the system will search <I>HS</I>from general to more specific hypotheses, and <I>CBD</I> will be the upperbound of <I>HS</I>. Because we only consider search processes that monotonicallyreduce <I>HS</I>, the alteration of <I>CBD</I> will always proceed fromspecific to general or from general to specific.</P><P> The other search biases (see Figures 4 and 6) in G&amp;T learning systems,which operate on a representation of <I>HS</I> by a bound, define dynamicconstraints on possible alterations of <I>CBD</I>. They can decompose intoapplicable learning operators, search strategies, and hypothesis validationcriterion.</P><P> Applicable learning operators. We have extracted from the inductivelogic programming literature the following partial list:</P><P> </P><UL><LI>the truncation operator, which generalizes a clause by dropping a literalin its body, and its dual operator for specialization, which adds literalsto the body of a clause; and</LI><P> </P><LI>the inverse resolution operator, absorption, and its dual operatorfor specialization, resolution, which both dynamically use the domain theory.</LI><P> </P></UL><P>Each learning operator generates its own search space, denoted <i>H<font size=-2>Op</i></font> (theset of hypotheses that can be generated from the initial bound of <I>HS</I>by iteratively applying the learning operator). This set might not coincideexactly with <I>HS</I>. An operator might not be complete with respectto the language bias-it might not reach all hypotheses satisfying the languagebias. Thus, choosing an operator that is incomplete regarding the languagebias is one way to prune <I>HS</I> hypotheses. Conversely, a learning operatormight generate hypotheses that do not satisfy the language bias, makingit necessary to test all generated hypotheses against it (see Figure 4).</P><P> Search strategy. The search strategy defines an ordering on hypothesesthat the learning operator will generate. For instance, using a breadth-firststrategy requires that all <I>CBD</I> alterations generated by applyingthe learning operator once are examined and validated before any <I>CBD</I>alteration that requires two applications of the learning operator. Theset of possible strategies here includes the usual ones found in problemsolving: depth-first, breadth-first, iterative deepening for uniformedstrategies, best-first, hill-climbing, stochastic, and so on. Given a hypothesis,and possibly the domain theory, the operator might still be nondeterministic.This case requires a strategy for choosing one candidate alteration amongthe possible ones, if only a single alteration of <I>CBD</I> is sought(that is, if <I>CBD</I> is conjunctive).</P><P> Validation of a path through Hop. Once the operator generates a newhypothesis, it must be validated against <I>TC</I> examples to evaluatewhether the learning system is still on course toward the correct solution.Control at that step splits into</P><P> Hypothesis validation criterion (see Figure 3). This criterion decideswhen an alteration of a given hypothesis is validated with respect to <I>TC</I>examples. For instance, when the learning direction is bottom-up (the learningsystem therefore proceeds by successive generalizations of the lowest boundof the search space), a new hypothesis may be validated when it coversmore positive examples of <I>TC</I> than its ancestor.</P><P> Selection of testing examples (see Figure 6). The hypothesis validationcriterion must check candidate alterations of hypotheses of <I>CBD</I>against examples of <I>TC</I>. Only a subset of <I>TC</I> examples is pertinentfor validating the alteration of a given <I>CBD</I> into a new bound (N<I>CBD</I>).For a bottom-up strategy, it is the set of examples covered by N<I>CBD</I>and not by <I>CBD</I>. (In a bottom-up strategy, because N<I>CBD</I> ismore general than <I>CBD</I>, it covers more examples than <I>CBD</I>.)Symmetrically, for a top-down strategy, it is the set of examples coveredby <I>CBD</I> and not N<I>CBD</I>. Still, this example set might be large;when the validation mode is a set of queries to the user, enumerating allsuch examples might be tedious. Diverse heuristics can help reduce thisset, sometimes to a single example. Those heuristics are admissible-theywill not allow the validation of a hypothesis that is not on a path towarda (partial) target concept definition-under specific conditions over thedistribution of examples in the instance set. They might still be appliedif those conditions are not met, thereby increasing the risk of validatingan invalid hypothesis.</P><P> Validation bias. Empirical learning uses two criteria to evaluate ahypothesis: completeness and correctness. The validation biases in ourmodel decompose into</P><P> A stopping criterion that decides when learning should stop for thistarget concept (typically, when the learned definition is correct and complete).</P><P> A partial validation criterion that decides, for a disjunctive targetconcept language, when a hypothesis is acceptable as a partial conceptdefinition, and therefore when it should be added to the target conceptdefinition. For instance, for a bottom-up strategy, a hypothesis adds tothe target concept definition when it cannot be further generalized withoutcovering at least one negative example. </P><P>Those two criteria are not necessarily the same, depending on the <I>CBD</I>and target concept languages. For instance, when both the target conceptand <I>CBD</I> languages are disjunctive, a hypothesis of <I>CBD</I> maybe learned when it is correct but not necessarily complete, whereas thefinal target concept definition must be correct and complete (see Figure5).</P><P> </P><H3>Configuring the generic G&amp;T system</H3><P>The two tasks of computing an initial representation of <I>HS</I> andsearching <I>HS</I> and its associated biases are interdependent. The chosenrepresentation for <I>HS</I> determines the type of search to perform andconsequently the search biases. When considerable information about theform of the target concept to be learned is available, it is computationallyinteresting to compute a representation of <I>HS</I> that precompiles thesearch process. Defining an adequate language bias alleviates most of thesearch problems. But, when little information is known beforehand aboutthe target concept, computing a representation for <I>HS</I> might be trivial.In this case, most of the learning effort stays with the search processthat, by combining an efficient search strategy and clever access to theinformation stored in the target concept examples, will allow the learningsystem to reach the expected target concept definition.</P><P> The influence of the language bias on the learning process and itsresults is crucial: for learning to succeed, the definition for the targetconcept must satisfy the language bias. For learning system performance,the size of <I>HS</I> and the complexity of the search through <I>HS</I>increase as the language bias weakens.</P><P> The exact influence of the <I>HS</I> hypotheses' syntax on machine-learningsystem performance is still an open research issue. Moreover, acquiringor even tuning such a bias might be quite difficult for a naive user ofmachine-learning systems. Operationally, the language bias can neverthelessvery effectively bind the complexity of the search.</P><P> Tuning the language bias usually involves starting with a very strongbias, both for the hypothesis and concept language, and gradually shiftingto a more complex language should learning fail. For instance, users wouldfirst choose to look for a conjunctive target concept definition (whichmeans that learning will succeed only if one <I>HS</I> hypothesis satisfiesthe stopping criterion). The choice of the hypothesis language vocabularyis critical. If learning fails, the user might shift to a disjunctive targetconcept language that can describe more complex concepts. In this case,the choice of the vocabulary of hypotheses is less crucial for learningsuccess, but it makes the search much more expensive.</P><P> The choices of learning direction and validity criterion for the finaltarget concept definition are mutually dependent. A top-down learning algorithmworks better when learning (maximally) discriminant concept definitions-whenthe user would rather learn a complete concept definition than a correctone. Symmetrically, a bottom-up learning algorithm yields more specificconcept definitions. Consequently, it is more conservative and better suitedwhen a user prefers correctness over completeness-when it is not necessaryto cover all positive examples but it is crucial that the target conceptdefinition cover none of the negative examples.</P><P> Users can define any strategy to search <i>H<font size=-2>Op</i></font>. A user might choose toexhaustively search through <i>H<font size=-2>Op</i></font> (smallest step), which is a careful strategy-consideringeach generated alteration must be validated against <I>TC</I> examples.This strategy works when the user wants to preserve theoretical propertiesof the learning algorithm, or when the domain theory is incorrect or incomplete.The largest possible step concerning a given operator lets the user minimizememory storage. A dichotomy search minimizes the number of examples neededfor learning.</P><P> Users can adapt each of these strategies to specific learning situations,or more particularly, to distributions of <I>TC</I> examples in the instancespace (the space of all possible example descriptions). They can also selectsearch strategies based on complexity issues, such as minimizing the numberof intermediate <I>CBD</I>s to build before learning, bounding the estimationof the error rate of the target concept definition learned, or minimizingmemory storage.</P><P> </P><H3>A sample learning session</H3><P>The Haiku prototype implements this generic G&amp;T model, using QuintusProlog.4 The toy application we have selected to illustrate a Haiku learningsession concerns learning the definition for the concept of &quot;arch&quot;from a set of positive and negative examples and a small domain theory.(The arch concept is a structural domain learning problem frequently usedin machine-learning research to illustrate various system behavior. Theproblem involves learning the concept of an arch by providing examplesof arches, described in terms of their components-pillars and lintels-andsometimes their relative positions.) The learning session starts with thefollowing domain theory (written in Prolog syntax):</P><P> </P><PRE><TT>volume(X) :- sphere(X).volume(X) :- flat_top(X).volume(X) :- pointed_top(X).flat_top(X) :- parallelepiped(X).flat_top(X) :- cube(X).pointed_top(X) :- pyramid(X).</TT></PRE><P>These clauses represent in a definite clause language a hierarchy ofgeometrical shapes. The initial positive example of arch is a ground clause:</P><P> </P><PRE><TT>arch(a,b,c) :- parallelepiped(a), parallelepiped(b), pyramid(c).</TT></PRE><P>where <TT>a</TT> and <TT>b</TT> represent the two pillars of the archand c its lintel. </P><P>Assume that Haiku has the following configuration (see Figures 1 and2):</P><P> </P><UL><LI>the learning direction is bottom-up: <I>HS</I> is represented by itscurrent lower bound; </LI><LI>the initial bound of <I>HS</I>, denoted <I>CBD</I>0, is the variabilizedinitial positive example; </LI><LI>no explicit language bias is available (the language bias is inducedby the learning operator and is therefore implicit); and </LI><LI>the learning operator is absorption. (Absorption generalizes a clauseCs in relation to a clause Ct of the domain theory by replacing Ct's bodyby Cs's head in the body of Cs. Given a hierarchical domain theory, applyingabsorption amounts to generalizing by replacing a literal in the exampleby its father in the hierarchy.) </LI></UL><P>This subset of the learning system's bias configuration is sufficientto define its actual search space <i>H<font size=-2>Op</i></font> (Figure 7 shows a part of <i>H<font size=-2>Op</i></font>). Inthe figure, darkly shaded nodes are more general than rejected hypotheses.They have been generated by the learning operator, but have been discardedwithout any test-against examples.</P><P> <IMG SRC="x40507.gif" HEIGHT=258 WIDTH=471></P><P>Figure 7. The lattice of hypothesis <i>H<font size=-2>Op</i></font>. The head of all hypotheses in the graph arch(X,Y,Z) cannot be generalized by the learning operatorand is therefore implicit in the figure, except on the bottom clause. Thelearning system has generated and validated the lighter nodes in the lattice.The clear nodes belong to <i>H<font size=-2>Op</i></font>, but have not been developed, given the learningstrategy.</P><P> The other search bias parameters set the learning strategy-the waythe system searches <i>H<font size=-2>Op</i></font> during learning. Here, the strategy is to search<i>H<font size=-2>Op</i></font> depth-first: <I>CBD</I> contains a single hypothesis, and backtrackingmight occur when a given alteration of <I>CBD</I> is not validated regardingexamples of the target concept. If the learning operator is nondeterministicfor a given <I>CBD</I> and the domain theory, the system applies a Prolog-likestrategy. It selects the first applicable clause in the domain theory andgeneralizes the left-most set of literals in the body of <I>CBD</I>.</P><P> The hypothesis validation bias sets that an alteration (<I>NHyp</I>)of a given <I>CBD</I> hypothesis (<I>H<font size=-2>yp</font></I>) is validated if the followingcondition holds for a single positive example <I>E</I> of the target concept:<I>E</I> was not covered by <I>Hyp</I> and is now covered by <I>NHyp</I>.This validation strategy is very weak because the new hypothesis, in additionto this single positive example, might also cover many negative examplesof the target concept. It is nevertheless quite efficient because it onlyrequires a single example to confirm the alteration. The stopping criterionis to find a target concept definition that is both correct and complete.The search starts from</P><P> </P><PRE><TT>CBD<FONT SIZE=-2>0</FONT>: arch(X,Y,Z) :- parallelepiped(X), parallelepiped(Y), pyramid(Z).</TT></PRE><P>The system first builds the first candidate alteration of the bound</P><P><code><PRE><TT>CBD<FONT SIZE=-2>1</FONT>: arch(X,Y,Z) :- flat_top(X),parallelepiped(Y), pyramid(Z).</TT></code></PRE><P><TT>(parallelepiped(X)</TT> has been generalized into <TT>flat_top(X)</TT>).This hypothesis is validated against examples; for instance, </P><code><PRE>E : arch(c,d,e) :- cube(c),parallelepiped(d), pyramid(e).</code></PRE><P>is a positive example of <I>TC</I>. The new bound <I>CBD</I><FONT SIZE=-2>1</FONT>is thus now the newly validated hypothesis. Following the same scheme,the system generates this alteration for <I>CBD</I><FONT SIZE=-2>1</FONT>:</P><P><code><PRE>arch(X,Y,Z) :- volume(X), parallelepiped(Y),pyramid(Z).</code></PRE><P>This alteration is not validated against the <I>TC</I> examples (allexamples that are covered by this new hypothesis and not by <I>CBD</I>1are unstable constructs that have as a pillar either a pyramid or a sphere).The system stores this failed hypothesis in the learning archive; no hypothesismore general than this one (which would necessarily be incorrect) willbe validated against examples (see Figure 3). The learning system backtracksto an alternative alteration of <I>CBD</I><FONT SIZE=-2>1</FONT>,</P><P> </P><code><PRE>CBD<FONT SIZE=-2>2</FONT>: arch(X,Y,Z) :- flat_top(X), flat_top(Y), pyramid(Z).</code></PRE><P>Which is validated against examples and becomes the new current lowestbound of H<font size=-2>Op</font>.</P><P> The first possible alteration of <I>CBD</I><font size=-2>2</font>,</P><P><code> <pre>arch(X,Y,Z) :- volume(X), flat_top(Y),pyramid(Z).</code></pre><P> is more general than the previously rejected hypothesis. The systemtherefore immediately rejects it without validating it against examples.The second candidate alteration of <I>CBD</I><font size=-2></font>,<P> <code><pre>arch(X,Y,Z) :- flat_top(X), volume(Y),pyramid(Z).</P></code></pre><P> is found incorrect against <I>TC</I> examples. The third alterationof <I>CBD</I><font size=-2>2</font></P><P><code><pre> <I>CBD</I><font size=-2>3</font>: arch(X,Y,Z) :- flat_top(X), flat_top(Y), pointed_top(Z).</code></pre><P> is validated and becomes <I>CBD</I><font size=-2>3</font>. Similarly, the system only validatesa single alteration of <I>CBD</I><font size=-2>3</font> against examples:</P><P> <code><pre><I>CBD</I><font size=-2>4</font>: arch(X,Y,Z) :- flat_top(X), flat_top(Y),volume(Z).</code></pre><P> <I>CBD</I><font size=-2>4</font> cannot be generalized further without becoming incorrect,and thus becomes the concept definition of the arch concept.</P><P> Nevertheless, this concept definition for arch is obviously very poor.The provided domain theory only allowed for hierarchical generalizationsof the shapes of the arch's subparts. Because the selected validation strategywas also very rough (finding a single positive example that was coveredby the new hypothesis), the system validated unsound alterations of thebound. The generalization of <tt>pointed_top(Z)</tt> into <tt>volume(Z)</tt> is incorrect-forinstance, <i>Z</i> cannot be a sphere because a sphere is not stable on any geometricalshape in this theory. The domain theory was thus ill-formed to learn anadequate concept of &quot;arch.&quot; To overcome this problem, the userneeds to enrich the learning system's domain theory. Assume for the sakeof clarity that the expert in architecture is only interested in learninga definition of <tt>arch(X,Y,Z)</tt> that ensures that <i>Z</i> is stable on both <i>X</i> and<i>Y</i>. The new domain theory is thus enriched with the clauses</P><P> </P><code><PRE>is_stable_on(Y,X) :- flat_top(X), flat_bottom(Y).flat_bottom(X) :- cube(X).      flat_bottom(X) :- pyramid(X). flat_bottom(X) :- parallelepiped(X).</code></PRE><P>that is, an approximate definition of <tt>stable(X,Y)</tt> and the definitionof predicate <tt>flat_bottom(X)</tt>. This domain theory is not a simple hierarchyanymore: literals such as <tt>cube(X)</tt> or <tt>parallelepiped(X)</tt> now have two ancestors,<tt>flat_bottom(X)</tt> and <tt>flat_top(X)</tt>. Moreover, the clause defining <tt>is_stable_on(X,Y)</tt>has two premises. Given this enriched domain theory, and the bias configurationbeing unchanged, Figure 8 shows a part of the new <i>H<font size=-2>Op</i></font>.</P><P> <IMG SRC="x40508.gif" HEIGHT=247 WIDTH=475></P><P>Figure 8. The lattice of the new hypothesis <i>H<font size=-2>Op</i></font>.</P><P> Provided that the absorption operator is destructive, only a singlegeneralization of <tt>parallelepiped(X)</tt>, namely <tt>flat_bottom(X)</tt> or <tt>flat_top(X)</tt>,can be reached given this learning-system configuration. This has the verypractical implication that a definition of <tt>arch(X,Y,Z)</tt> cannot contain,given this bias configuration, both literals <tt>flat_bottom(X)</tt> and <tt>flat_top(X)</tt>.(This argument also stands, symmetrically, for possible generalizationsof <tt>parallelepiped(Y)</tt>.)</P><P> Given that the learning system follows the path through <i>H<font size=-2>Op</i></font> up to <I>CBD</I><font size=-2>3</font>,the same problem arises again. Absorption cannot build a clause that containsboth <tt>stable(Z,Y)</tt> and <tt>stable(Z,X)</tt>, which would be an acceptable definitionof <tt>arch(X,Y,Z)</tt>. To learn such a definition and to simulate a nondestructiveabsorption (at the price, unfortunately, of some growth of <i>H<font size=-2>Op</i></font>), one solutionis to set the search bias of the learning system to</P><ul><li> saturate for building the initial lower bound of the search space.Saturation involves making all possible deductions on the body of the initialexample, given the domain theory. With this process, all possible generalizationsof literals in the body of the initial example are made explicit in thebody of the initial bound of <i>H<font size=-2>Op</i></font>;</P><li> drop one of the most specific literals in the hypothesis body as alearning operator;</P><li> use range restriction as language bias: each variable in the head ofhypothesis of <i>H<font size=-2>Op</i></font> should also appear in its body, and vice versa.</ul><P> </P><P>ALTHOUGH THIS WORK IS STILL PRELIMINARY concerning configuration issues,our initial experiments seem to validate the approach. As a useful sideeffect, the knowledge-level modeling emphasizes bias and its role in thelearning process. The next step is to complete the model, formalize theconfigurer (and especially answer questions concerning the dynamic configurationprocess), and acquire through experiments some configuration expertise.</P><P> </P><b>Acknowledgments</b><P> Esprit III BRA 6020 (inductive logic programming) and the French MRTthrough PRC-IA partially supported this work.

The department distinguished itself through contributions in the development of the KADS and CommonKADS engineering methods for knowledge-based systems. CommonKADS, used in both research and commercial applications, is the most widely used method for KBS development.</p><p><b>Taking root</b></p><p>During the sixties and seventies, SWI took root in the cognitive science research at the University of Amsterdam's department of psychology. In 1980, the faculty cofounded a department for social science informatics (of which SWI is the Dutch abbreviation). For its general goal, it focused on studying "the relation (in the broadest sense) between information technology and social processes at the individual, organizational, and societal level." To further this objective, SWI participated in numerous projects on related topics including intelligent help systems, teaching systems, reflective architectures, technical diagnosis, knowledge-acquisition workbenches, medical systems, effects of IT on human labor, and software project management.</p><p>In 1983-84, SWI joined in one of the first European IT research projects of the Esprit Program. (See the box "<a href=#Research>EU-sponsored research</a>" for details.) The project focused on using cognitive models for the interpretation of problem-solving expertise data. This research then expanded into a series of projects on methodological aspects of KBS development. SWI reached its peak in size in 1990, employing 40 people, paid mostly through external funds. Currently, approximately 30 people work at SWI putting out over 100 scientific publications per year.</p><p><b>Knowledge technology</b></p><p>Historically, knowledge-based systems in AI research developed mainly through trial and error. The methodology received little attention, despite a clear need for guidelines and techniques to structure and control the development process. Accordingly, systems developers greatly appreciated the attempts made by KADS and CommonKADS to fill this gap. The situation was much like the proverb: "In a kingdom of the blind, the one-eyed man is king." Although far from complete and often confusing, the first versions of KADS provided the only options. This gave SWI the opportunity to further develop KADS, in two large Esprit projects (KADS-I and KADS-II), into a reasonably comprehensive approach.</p><p>Baseline KADS consists of two elements:</p><ul><li>A framework for the implementation-independent specification of knowledge, combined with a set of reusable knowledge models for frequently occurring tasks (such as assessment and diagnosis).</li><li>A life-cycle model indicating phases, activities, and products relevant for a KBS project. </li></ul><p>The passing years saw many additional ingredients to the methodology. Practical use of KADS showed that many KBS projects failed because of a <i>technology-push</i> approach. An organization can only successfully implement KBS technology if both the system's role and its potential impact on the organization are explicated and agreed upon before and during system development. Thus, the introduction of methods and techniques for organizational analysis signaled a major advance. Organizational analysis aims at creating an <i>application-pull</i> situation. This approach provides some assurance that the system will actually solve a problem within the organization.</p><p>Other additions deal with modeling of user-system interaction, the introduction of custom-tailored formal-specification techniques, and the definition of a cyclic, risk-driven configurable life-cycle approach to replace the old classical waterfall model. (See recommended readings.)</p><p>Many people outside SWI contributed to the CommonKADS work, in particular Hans Akkermans (ECN, The Netherlands), Rob Martil (Lloyd's Register, London), and Walter Van de Velde (Free University of Brussels).</p><p><b>Technology transfer</b></p><p>Early on, companies began using the knowledge technology products developed at SWI. This factored greatly into the products' success. As early as 1986, the Dutch firm Bolesian Systems exploited the first version of KADS and refined it into their in-house method for KBS development. They built a considerable number of commercial systems, mostly in the financial sector. Many banks and insurance companies in The Netherlands have systems, developed with a variant of KADS, in daily use for assessing loan and mortgage applications. A well-known application in the UK is the credit-card fraud detection program developed by Touche Ross (a partner in the KADS and CommonKADS project) for Barclay Card. All the "Big Six" accounting firms generally integrate smaller or larger parts of KADS into their in-house development method.</p><p>Also, SWI's work with KBS frequently serves as a baseline for research-oriented, system-development projects, such as Esprit and government projects. The CommonKADS methods have recently served for purposes other than pure system development, such as knowledge management and business process analysis. The US-based Carnegie Group has applied CommonKADS in this way in a project for US West. Similarly, Unilever adopted CommonKADS as an in-house standard and uses it on both system development and knowledge management.</p><p>Inadequate documentation of the methodology used to be a major technology transfer problem. Until 1992, documentation consisted primarily of technical Esprit reports, which contained fragmented and not easily accessible information. The production of a number of extensive journal publications as well as a source book somewhat alleviated this problem. A good textbook is still needed, and one is slated for publication in the beginning of 1997. SWI as well as other CommonKADS partners offer courses that teach their approach. Furthermore, universities all over the world have included CommonKADS in their knowledge engineering courses.</p><p>An advantage of CommonKADS lies in its potential to bridge the gap between knowledge engineering and software engineering. CommonKADS employs notations and diagrammatic conventions that are mainly extensions of more traditional ones. This is an important factor, because in practice, the development and use of KBSs always run in conjunction with more conventional software systems. With this arrangement in mind, SWI offers a knowledge-engineering course that treats CommonKADS and the popular object-oriented method (OMT) in an integrated fashion.</p><p>This research has led to a number of software products, ranging from high-level implementation and user-interface languages to a prototype knowledge engineering workbench (see the box "<a href=#Software>SWI Software</a>" for more details).</p><p><b>Other research areas</b></p><p>Although KADS-related research at SWI attracts the most attention, the department as a whole studies a much broader field. A main research area consists of the social and economic impact of information technology. To explore this other side of the IT coin, PhD projects are underway that study diverse technology-assessment subjects such as women and IT, privacy, cost-benefit analysis of knowledge-based systems, and the analysis of scientific and sociological trends.</p><p>SWI also has a group that specializes in educational systems. A series of EU-funded projects (Eurohelp, Smisle, EAST, Servive) develops tools and techniques for creating teaching and training tools, relating in particular to quantitative and qualitative simulations. This is a typical SWI research area, which heavily intertwines technical aspects, human-computer interaction aspects, and cognitive aspects.</p><p>In knowledge-engineering research, the emphasis at SWI has shifted over the last few years from modeling reasoning processes to modeling ontologies. Ontologies are potentially reusable pieces of domain knowledge. In our view, this area will soon become a prime focus of AI research. Building a new generation of intelligent, interacting IT systems requires getting a grip on a number of standard ways of "viewing the world," albeit in a limited and pragmatic, engineering-oriented fashion. The main project at SWI in this area is Kactus, which proposes to develop a number of reusable ontologies for technical systems. Application domains in Kactus include ship design, oil platforms, and electrical service networks. Kactus seeks to link CIME (Computer Integrated Manufacturing and Engineering) research on standard product models for engineering (ISO STEP, the International Standards Organization's Standard for the Exchange of Product Data) and emerging standards in knowledge engineering.</p><p>Finally, knowledge management shows promise as another area of research. This follows as a natural progression from the work done at SWI on knowledge modeling and organization analysis. Companies begin to recognize knowledge as an asset of their organization, in the same category as money, material, people, and products. Consequently, techniques for cataloging the expertise in an organization have drawn greater attention. CommonKADS techniques have proven themselves useful in these endeavors. This is consistent with our findings from previous system-development projects. Often the document describing the knowledge model outlives the application and emerges as the most valuable outcome of the project.</p><p>By its nature, research at SWI is very much a multi-disciplinary and team-oriented activity. Evidence of this lies in the diverse backgrounds of the staff members, which range from psychology to computer science and physics. We firmly believe that this new IT age will engender an increasing need for SWI-type of research, to show that people, organizations, and society as a whole can develop and apply these technologies in a new and beneficial way.</p><p><B>Recommended Readings</B></p><p>B.J.

<TITLE>AI IN CIVIL AND STRUCTURAL ENGINEERING</TITLE><body bgcolor="#ffffff"><img src="../../../expert.gif"><p><a href="../../../feature.htm">Features</a><P><blockquote><h3>Support for Integrated Value-Based Maintenance Planning</h3><P><B>John C. Kunz, Yan Jin, Raymond E. Levitt, Shouh-Dauh Lin, andPaul M. Teicholz, Stanford University</b><P><font size=4><i>The Intelligent Real-Time Maintenance Management system helps process-plant engineers and owners perform value-based plant maintenance. With IRTMM, they can inspeact subsystems, identify components operating parameters, and review and make notes regarding component performance or operational and maintenance history.</i></font><P>THE MAINTENANCE OBJECTIVE FOR ANY MANUFACTURING or power plant is that plant systems should always be available to support plant function,without ever limiting plant production. More precisely, the cost ofany maintenance activity should be less than the expected marginalvalue of production enabled by the planned activity. In planningmaintenance to meet this time-varying objective, a plant's operatingengineers and owner need to share information about current plantcomponent status and the business situation.<P>Supporting this objective is difficult. Assessing the risk posed by anobserved noncritical problem to future production ischallenging. There are multiple goals, goals change and conflict, andindicator data are almost never completely reliable oradequate. Furthermore, the problem has multiple aspects:interpretation of observed data, problem diagnosis, repair andmaintenance planning, and business evaluation of different repair andmaintenance options. Finally, interpreting available engineering andbusiness data demands good judgment, and the ability to define thevalue of maintenance requires a clear business policy.<P>As this article shows, our Intelligent Real-Time MaintenanceManagement (IRTMM) system helps process-plant owners performvalue-based plant maintenance-not simply periodic maintenance orrepairs following a breakdown, but maintenance motivated byengineering or business concerns. Implemented using object-orientedsoftware with associated objects; displays; and systems-interfaceutilities, rules, and methods, the system performs three coupledfunctions-situation assessment, planning, and value analysis-eachimplemented as an independent software module. The modules share asymbolic plant model that describes plant components, theirattributes, and their connectivity. IRTMM has performed successfullyon test cases from power company utilities and from a large processplant.<P><h2>Three-module design</h2><P>The IRTMM system provides integrated subsystems for three aspects ofthe maintenance and repair planning problem:<P><ul><li><i>Situation assessment.</i> The SA module interprets observed data as normalor abnormal, and diagnoses causes and effects of plant equipmentproblems. It also analyzes system performance to identify indicationsfor condition-based maintenance.<P><li><i>Planning.</i> Given a set of problems to repair, provided by the SA or bya user who is considering maintenance, the planner builds plans of theactivities needed to repair a diagnosed problem. It can also mergerelated plans for the same or different components that can beperformed during the same plant outage.<P><li><i>Value analysis.</i> The VA module identifies the monetary costs and thepredicted benefits of performing every selected repair plan atdifferent times. Using predicted power demand and plant operating andmaintenance cost data, this subsystem assesses the net unit operatingcosts associated with performing plans at different possible times.</ul><P>The IRTMM system provides interactive analyses to facilitateengineering decision making, not automate it. Given data from adata-acquisition system, the system identifies candidate problemcauses and predicted effects. The user selects one or more componentsto analyze in more detail. After reviewing the system-generated plansand value analysis, the user selects the one or more components forrepair, indicating both the desired repair activity and the plannedrepair time, after considering the system-generated options.<P>Designed to reside on a computer network, IRTMM can receive componentstatus information from an on-line data-acquisition system or anyavailable diagnostic expert systems; staff- and equipment-availabilityinformation from a computerized maintenance management system (CMMS);and projected product demand, cost, and selling price data from abusiness database. Users can log recommended work in the CMMS.<P><h2>Shared plant model</h2><P>At the heart of the system is a shared symbolic plant model, used bythe three IRTMM modules. The model explicitly represents the form,function, and behavior of the plant systems, components, andprocesses. Form describes the layout and part composition ofcomponents and systems. If the application were extended to supportother purposes, the form model would also represent componentfeatures, dimensions and tolerances, and materials. Function describesdesign intent for the component or system-for example, for pumping-andspecifies methods to compute the simulated values of component outputparameters, given values of input parameters. Behavior describes thepossible, measured, and simulated values of parameters, includingstates (operating, startup, or failed), engineering parameters such asvibration and temperature, and relationships.<P>IRTMM processing control involves shifting the system's focus ofattention from the SA to the planner to the VA modules (see Figure1). Each module requests data from its information source.<P><img src = "x40351.gif"><P><b>Figure 1. IRTMM architecture. Each module has a copy of the genericplant model. When it receives control from the user, a module requestsdata from its data source. The querying module receives and stores therequested data, specifically the attribute values of instance objects.</b><P>Figure 2 shows the most important entities represented in the sharedplant model; characterizes their roles as form, function, andbehavior; and identifies the module that uses each modelconstituent. The different IRTMM modules use the model constituents,as shown by x's in the rightmost three columns.<P><img src = "x40352.gif"><P><b>Figure 2. Entities defined in the shared plant model. Shadingindicates data items shared among two or more modules. The plant modelrepresents numerous classes of plant components, including filters,headers, heat exchangers, instruments, pipes, process equipment,pumps, and valves.</b><P>The model explicitly represents each parameter. Each has a value,which is often numeric. Numeric parameters also have a state. Aparameter's state attribute value is normally high, normal, low, oroff. The SA and planner use the model as a source of the plant'scomponents and their connectivity, engineering functions, and possiblebehaviors.<P><h2>Situation assessment</h2>The SA system diagnoses plant equipment problems. Given specializedinput data from instrumentation (pressures or flow rates, for example)and possibly from specialized expert diagnostic systems (such asvibration analysis), the SA provides a systems diagnosis. Itidentifies potential root causes and effects of component problems,where some causes and effects might be in the component with a problemand others in subcomponents or connected systems.<P>The SA uses a combination of methods to perform this assessment:model-based diagnosis (MBD) to identify the details of a large classof possible problems, heuristic classification to identify thepresence of a set of idiosyncratic problems, and case-based reasoning(CBR) to compare observed data with previously identified casesidentified by the MBD technique. The SA uses the shared symbolic plantmodel of the plant systems, components, and parameters. Users interactwith the system using interactive process and instrumentation diagrams(P&IDs) for different selected subsystems, identify componentoperating parameters, and review and make notes regarding componentperformance or operational and maintenance history.<P>The SA provides a systematic monitoring and component diagnosiscapability for facility equipment and systems. Henny Sipma implementedthe first versions of the SA in the BB1 software environment. (<a href= "#1">1</a>) <P><b>SA purposes</b>. The SA includes the following capabilities:<P><ul><li><i>Check reported data for consistency</i>. The SA reports alarm conditionsfor data that is out of the expected range or inconsistent with othermeasured data. This process checks data value with respect tocontext-dependent limits to classify data as normal, high, low, orartifact. Plant-monitoring systems now largely perform theout-of-expected-range test, but the SA includes it for those cases inwhich a plant-monitoring system does not do the check.<P><li><i>Hypothesize possible component faults</i>. For processes that are out ofstatistical control, the SA identifies candidate causes and reportsevidence for and against hypothesized faults. It reports causes,effects, supporting data, missing data, and recommended actions.<P><li><i>Show a shared, annotated P&ID to plant staff</i>. Any IRTMM user can bringup a subsystem P&ID and view the following information provided by anySA user: measured data currently in the plant model system (such astemperatures), staff comments (for example, to let one user store thefact that a component was repaired and is now back on line and letanother user discover the fact), and inferred data (such as when thecomputer concludes that a component is unreliable and should not beused except in emergencies).<P><li><i>Use a uniform environment (the shared plant model) to describe thecurrent facility, including components, their roles, and theirconnectivity.</i> The plant model stores measured data values, faultpossibilities, and component history as concluded by the SA orreported interactively by staff.<P></ul>The SA system operates in either the <i>periodic</i> or <i>demand mode</i>. In theperiodic mode, the system queries the monitoring system every period(for example, every hour) for the current status of all measuredparameters, assesses each component's diagnostic status, and displaysa summary status assessment of all monitored subsystems, includingtrends when available. Plant maintenance supervisors, the principalperiodic users, review the situation assessment at least once a weekand prepare work orders as appropriate. The SA operates as amaintenance advisor, not a control system.<P>In the demand mode, when initiated by a user or a monitored eventreported by the data-acquisition system, the SA queries the monitoringsystem for the current status of components in a selected subsystem,assesses the diagnostic status of that subsystem, and displaysanalysis results on an annotated subsystem P&ID. When requested by auser, it queries or updates the work-management system historyfile. Individual plant maintenance staff and management, the principaldemand users, review outstanding work orders; review component status,history, trends, and comments; plan maintenance activities; and logcomments about their actions, observations, and conclusions.<P><b>SA reasoning</b>. Knowledge systems now routinely do diagnostic reasoningusing MBD, heuristic classification, and CBR. The SA uses acombination of these.<P><i>Model-based diagnosis</i>. MBD involves qualitative simulation of systembehavior. (<a href = "#2">2</a>) First, a user (or an algorithm) setsup the plant model, selecting components to represent in the system,their connectivity, their states (such as on, off, open, or closed),and their assumed behaviors (for example, as-designed orleaking). Next, the user injects a change into a system model-forexample, by closing a valve or starting a leak-and runs a simulationto propagate the change through the system to determine the completesystem behavior, given the assumed system parameter states. Finally,the user compares the simulated and observed data.<P>With consistent data, users assume that the physical system and modelstates are consistent. If the observed and simulated data areinconsistent, users vary their assumptions about the model untilsimulated and observed data become consistent. Any abnormalities inthe model state are sufficient to explain abnormalities in theobserved system.<P>The SA uses MBD to analyze the behavior of a process plant's processcooling water (PCW) system. The method generally applies to situationsin which relatively simple rules describe the propagation of behaviorfrom one system component to another.<P><i>Heuristic classification.</i> This method is the basis for classic expertsystems. (<a href = "#3>3</a>) It abstracts evidence in the form ofmeasured data and relates it to a predefined potentialproblem. Heuristic classification matches the problem with a solutionand refines the solution. The SA uses this method to analyzesituations having idiosyncratic causal behavior-for example, thecauses and effects of bearing failure and shaft imbalance.<P><i>Case-based reasoning.</i> CBR is the basis for some diagnostic systems andmany recent help-desk applications. (<a href = "#4>4</a>) An expertcreates a set of cases, each including descriptions of a situation (acase) and an associated statement of a cause and suggestedrepair. Thus, the CBR method aggregates the heuristic classificationsteps. Diagnosis involves simple matching of observed data with thedata of each case. This method reports relevant cases as appearingsimilar to the observed situation.<P><i>Integrating MBD and CBR. MBD uses no notion of fault.</i> Systems simplyhave behavior. Observed and simulated behaviors either do or do notcompare. Separate from the MBD technique, a user might choose tomodify a system (physical or model) to change its behavior. In the SA,the MBD technique generates a set of cases. The user then annotateseach case with a recommended change and an expected outcome if thechange is applied. The SA diagnostic procedure then matches observeddata with case data and reports the cases that best match theobservation, the evidence for and against each case, the recommendedaction, and the expected outcome.<P><i>Reasoning procedures</i>. The SA model performs the following reasoningprocedures:<P><ul><li><i>Set up a test case.</i> The SA lets a user introduce a problem into themodel and record both a description of the problem and the appropriaterepair. This setup method then identifies consequences of theintroduced problem (by invoking the Propagate! method) and collectsthese secondary parameter values into the case record (by invoking theSnapshot! method).<P><li><i>Propagate a component's qualitative behavior to its downstreamcomponents</i> (Propagate_Behavior!). For example, the SA checks thecomponent-inlets state parameter and determines the componentdischarge state parameters. For a normally functioning component, thepropagation method sets a component's discharge state parameters to bethe same as the states of corresponding inlet parameters-for example,high, normal, or low temperature for the inlet gets propagated tohigh, normal, or low outlet temperature. Heating components, forinstance, set the discharge temperature to high if fluid inlet ishigh.<P><li><i>Record subsystem snapshot values</i> (Snapshot!). The SA records a user'sparameter state assignments and the associated states of all abnormalparameters after behavior propagation. The user can (and should) checkthat the case makes sense and also annotate the case with suggestedrepair actions and the expected result if the suggested action istaken.

From aplanning viewpoint, the engineering planning problem is likely to becomplex, because it is highly contextual and might involve many typesof objects, actions, and resources.<P>Early AI planners showed that computers could identify plan activitiesand infer activity precedence. (<a href = "#5">5</a>) While such earlyStrips-style planners evolved by the mid 1970s, they remain ill-suitedto most engineering domains because of the limited activityrepresentation these planners adopted. (<a href = "#6">6</a>)General-purpose planners in the tradition of Strips (Stanford ResearchInstitute Problem Solver) still have not found broad use forgenerating realistic engineering plans. Conversely, narrowly scopedexpert planning systems work for specific domains but have littleapplicability to even slightly different domains.<P>The engineering planning research we describe here attempts to addressthe shortcomings of overly general or overly specific planningapproaches by modeling the behavior of plan elements. Oarplan(Object-Action Resource Planner), a model-based planner, definesactivities in an engineering plan by their constituent objects,actions, and resources.  (<a href = "#7">7</a>) That is, an activityspecifies an object-action-resources set, as well as traditionalattributes of times (start and end) and relationships (for example,successors). It generates a plan by reasoning about objects, actions,and resources of a specific engineering domain.<P>Oarplan uses generic models of objects (pumps and valves) contained inthe shared plant model. In addition, it uses models of actions (forexample, close or remove) and resources (plumbers and cranes).<P>Planning in Oarplan involves activity generation and activityordering. Oarplan planning is hierarchical because it recursivelygenerates activities at lower planning levels by elaborating those athigher levels, based on object-action-resource models. Activityordering proceeds after all required activities are generated and isbased on satisfying constraints represented in the form of relationsamong components and methods. A final plan results after Oarplanperforms all elaboration and examines and satisfies all constraints.<P>Planner purposes. The planner can clear a component, generateactivities based on elaboration and refinement of a top-levelactivity, order planned activities, and merge plans that aremergeable.<P>Planner reasoning. The planner uses a model-based approach toengineering planning. Planning explicitly considers the form andfunction of plant components. The clearance procedure identifies fluidinlet valves to close and discharge and drain valves to open forisolating a component and safeguarding workers. If a valve isdisabled, the procedure searches upstream from the component for othervalves to close or open.<P>Activity generation builds on planning knowledge of how actionselaborate. Actions can have relationships that specify how theyelaborate into more detailed actions; objects can have relationshipsthat specify how they decompose into parts. For example, theactivity-generation procedure recursively generates detailedsubactivities to elaborate a given top-level activity (see Figure 5).<P><img src = "x40355.gif"><P><b>Figure 5. Oarplan plan activity tree. Oarplan builds activities withobject-action-resources triples. The top-level repair activityelaborates into a set of more detailed activities, based on thecomposition of the pump and the elaboration of the repairaction. Similarly, the repair shaft activity elaborates into a set ofmore detailed activities based on the elaboration of the repairaction. Boxes indicate activities that are included in the final plan.</b><P>In this example, the diagnosis was that the pump required maintenanceto repair a bent shaft, and a planner chose to send the shaft out forrepair (rather than replace the pump or repair the shaft in-house.) Inthe model, UNIT_3_MBFP_Shaft is part of UNIT_3_MBFP_Pump, and therepair action elaborates into five more detailed actions. Thegeneration procedure takes a given top-level task, (RepairUNIT_3_MBFP_Pump Some-Resources) and elaborates an activity (Figure5). By exploiting the component composition constraints with arelatively simple reasoning algorithm, the planner hierarchicallygenerates required activities for achieving a given project goal. Thefinal plan includes the leaf activities that cannot be expandedfurther, shown as boxes in the figure.<P>Activity ordering now has a simple procedure that places and ordersthese activities in a way that constructively satisfies the parallelor sequential elaboration constraints. The plan-merge procedure willoffer to merge two plans if they have activities that work oncomponents within the same clearance boundary or if some activitiesare shared-if they have the same object, action, andresources. Merging plans is desirable when users can perform a mergedplan faster than several independent plans and when they can performopportunistic maintenance relatively inexpensively while alsoperforming another required maintenance activity.<P>Planner testing. The SA reported that the main boiler feedwater pump(MBFP) required maintenance because vibration indicated a bent shaftproblem. Figure 5 shows the generated repair activity tree. The planitself is a linearized list of boxed activities.<P><h2>Value analysis</h2>Decision analysis recognizes that making choices means takingchances. Given a choice of time to maintain a component, the failingcomponent might break at any time prior to scheduled maintenance, withlikelihood given by a prescribed probability distribution, or it mightsurvive to the scheduled maintenance. The VA uses a decision-theoreticapproach-decision analysis-to analyze the expected value of eachchoice on the basis of each possible chance's likelihood and the valueof its outcomes.<P>Figure 6 shows how decision analysis computes a choice's expectedvalue as the sum of the values of the chance outcomes, weighted by theprobability of their occurrence. For a study period that is q unitslong, there are q + 1 choice alternatives: schedule repair at the ithhour, i = 1, (, q; or defer repair until after the end of the studyperiod. Each choice has some number of chance outcomes. For theith-hour repair alternative, for example, we can represent thepossible chance outcomes by the tree shown in Figure 6.<P><img src = "x40356.gif"><P><b> Figure 6. A choice-chance tree. The expected benefit of a choice, such as the choice to repair at time i, is the probability weighted sum of the benefits of the chances. Pi = probability of failure during the ith hour; Bi = net benefit of repair and revenue loss if the component fails in the jth hour, j < i; and (Pi Bi = expected benefit of choice of repairing at the ith hour. Summation takes place over each of the chance occurrences: 1 ( j ( i..</b><P>The size of the decision space depends on the size of both the studyperiod and the data's grain size: a seven-year study period mustconsider seven outcome possibilities if the problem assumes an annualdata grain size. It considers 84 outcomes if the problem assumes dataprecision of one month. Each decision's impact is measured by theexpected value of the objective function, weighted by the probabilityof occurrence associated with each outcome. The "best" decision isthus the one that has the optimal expected value.<P><b>VA purposes</b>. For each maintenance plan produced by the planner andselected by the user, the VA identifies several timing choices:perform the maintenance or repair as soon as possible, at the nextperiod of low demand that is long enough to do the activity, or at thenext scheduled outage that is long enough; or defer maintenance untilafter the end of the study period. Then it computes the expected costsand net value for a given repair plan at each time option.<P>The VA considers only one failing component at a time, so only onemaintenance activity at a time passes from the planner for study bythe VA. The VA assumes that the failing component is critical to thesystem. If the component fails unexpectedly or is under plannedrepair, the VA assumes that the system goes down. If repaired ormaintained, a component will not fail again within the study period bythe same mechanism. The only random aspect of the analysis is thefailing component's life. Unplanned repair begins immediatelyfollowing component failure, but the VA is built with the assumptionthat the time to perform unplanned repair includes both a wait time toassemble parts and crew plus actual repair time.<P>Components deteriorate only during operation, so when a component isidle, its performance does not deteriorate. Once repaired, a componentreturns to an as-good condition and will not fail again within thestudy period. The VA assumes that the component failure always occursat the beginning of each hour. For example, the component failing atthe kth hour means that the breakdown happens at the beginning of thekth hour. To simplify the analysis, the VA computes the benefit of achoice relative to a reference value, called the baseline. Thesimplest baseline assumes performing no maintenance activity during astudy period and no unexpected failure.<P>The VA assumes that a failing component's life distribution isWeibull, the most widely used parametric family of failuredistributions. The Weibull distribution takes the form:<P>where<br>T = failing component's life<br>( = scale parameter<br>( = shape parameter<br>The VA gets the estimate's mean-time-to-failure and standarddeviation from the model and converts these parameters to the twoWeibull distribution parameters.<P><b>VA reasoning</b>. For this discussion, we take the time unit to be onehour and the study period to be n hours. The benefit of a chance B isa value associated with the chance outcome computed from the followingthree parts:<P><ul><li>cost savings <i>S</i> of operational mode relative to the baselineoperational costs, during a time period;<P><li>cost of downtime Cdowntime due to buying replacement power from othersources during a time period. This cost will vary depending onduration-whether the repair is planned or unplanned.<P><li>cost of repair Crepair, either planned or unplanned, during a timeperiod.<P></ul>We can compute a chance occurrence's expected benefit by summing thecosts, weighted by the probability of failure at each time period, todetermine the expected net benefit of a choice:<P>Suppose the component fails at the kth hour. The total cost of failure would be:<P>Total cost if the component fails at the kth hour equals costs due todeterioration from the first to the (k–1)th hour (for example, thecost of deration, or running the component at less than its designrating capacting, and marginal costs of operating an agedcomponent-cost of production loss) + costs due to shutdown (forrepair) from the kth to the (k + tr -1)th hour, including the cost ofreplacement power while the plant is down; + costs of unplanned repairlabor and materials<P>where tr = repair time.<P>The total expected repair cost at the kth hour also considers the time value of money.<P>The user provides the following input to the VA module:<P><ul><li>Baseline case with predicted cost outcomes-typically an option tocontinue current operational mode throughout the study period.<P><li>Choices that can be made immediately-modes of operation and corresponding cost savings.<P><li>Chances-failure modes and corresponding relative probabilities following each choice.<P><li>Failing component and its lifetime probability of failure distribution.<P><li>Demand prediction over a study period.<P><li>Durations and costs for planned and unplanned maintenance.<P><li>Discount rate of money.<P><li>Study period duration.<P><li>Time options when the maintenance plan could be performed.</ul><P>Using this information, the VA generates a decision tree with eachbranch representing a possible chance outcome. It then computesbackwards to obtain the expected benefit for each choice optioncompared to the baseline option. For each choice, the returned valuesfrom VA include probability of survival to the start of maintenance;expected cost savings, replacement power cost, repair cost, andbenefit; best- and worst-case benefits; and break-even probabilitybetween two selected timing options.<P><b>VA testing.</b> While investigating excessive fan motor vibration, anengineer recommends that a component needs its bearing oil changed. Ifthe oil is not changed, the bearings might fail and bring down theplant. Arbitrarily, the engineer chooses to analyze the economic valueof maintenance options for a one-week study period. The engineeridentifies the following choices: (1) change oil off line as soon aspossible, bringing down the plant during the procedure; (2) change oilon-line ASAP, keeping the plant operating during the procedure; or (3)defer to the end of the study period.<P>Each choice has a set of chance occurrences: (1) unexpected bearingfailure prior to any maintenance; (2) oil spill during oil change,requiring immediate plant shutdown until the problem is corrected; or(3) survival of the bearing until the next planned outage (after theend of the study period).<P>The engineer makes a number of assumptions:<P><ul><li>Oil spill and unexpected bearing failure are independent.<P><li>Oil spill can only occur at the beginning of an on-line oil change,assumed to be planned for the first period, with a probability ofPspill.<P><li>If oil spill occurs, engineers must shut down the system and change oil completely.<P><li>After oil is changed, no failure occurs within the study period.<P><li>The material costs for changing oil off line and changing oil on-line are the same.<P><li>The time to change oil on line is short enough so that no bearingfailure will occur during the work.</ul><P>The time unit for this test case was one hour, with a study period ofone week and 168 periods to analyze during the study period.<P>We define the baseline case as the defer case: schedule oil changeafter the end of the study period. The baseline has no downtime cost,only the cost of the off-line oil change. The benefit for the baselineis zero.<P>Figure 7 shows the best alternative and associated expected benefit,relative to the ASAP/off-line alternative, as a function of theprobability of bearing failure and the probability of an oilspill. For example, when the oil-spill probability is high and thebearing-failure probability is low, the best strategy is to defer theoff-line oil change. When both probabilities are high-the riskiestsituation-engineers should immediately shut the system down and changethe oil off line. Otherwise, the best strategy is to change the oilon-line. Figure 7 shows the optimal decision for the bearing-failureand oil-spill probabilities. It also lists each decision's expectedbenefit (K$) relative to the second best's expected benefit.<P><img src = "x40357.gif"><p><b>Figure 7.

An important part of the IRTMM system's power comesfrom the model's engineering content, specifically the representationof plant function, form, and behavior in the shared plant model, andfrom the reasoning about these issues by the applications. As Figure 2suggests, the function, form, and behavior describes commonengineering knowledge about a system. Thus, it is readily availablefrom knowledgeable plant engineers. It is also very general,applicable to a broad class of process plants. For example, weinitially implemented SA for a power plant and later for a processplant's water-handling subsystem, and we needed to make only minorextensions to the generic plant model's functional definitions.<P>Similarly, we have used the planner for both maintenance planning andbuilding-construction planning, with only minor extensions to defineactions for the new applications area. The form model representsrelatively standard content of a product model, such as would be builtusing the ISO STEP standard. However, an important part of the totalsystem power comes from the behavioral methods defined in the functionmodels. While such methods are standard capabilities ofobject-oriented technology, they are outside the normal capabilitiesof STEP-style product models.<P>As Figure 1 shows, each application module has a copy of the genericplant model. Thus, each module shares the complete plant modelontology. In fact, as Figure 2 illustrates, two or more modules shareonly very limited form and behavior data items, and no functionalmethods are shared among modules. Rather than sharing the completemodel ontology, it would have been sufficient for each module to shareonly a top-level ontology-the classes in which mutually referencedslots are defined.<P>One knowledge-sharing architecture is to share a complete ontologywith the entire form, function, and behavior of every class andinstance object. The simplest alternative is to share minimaldata-values of selected slots of a few instances-with each modulemaintaining its own ontology of classes to describe generic form,function, and behavior in support of its own perspective. The currentIRTMM implementation uses the former alternative, but we conclude inretrospect that the latter would have been adequate.<P>In general, two different applications can use differentrepresentations of the same information. An integration architectureneeds to support appropriate transformation of the data generated byone application into the perspective and actual data structureexpected by a successor application. For example, in IRTMM, theplanner produces activity start and end times. The VA needs activitydurations; the planner transforms these times into durations. Eithermodule could report the same information under two names or make anyother appropriate parametric transformation. In an alternativeintegration architecture, an external agent could do thetransformation after one module registers that it can produceparticular data and another module registers its interest in thedata. (<a href="#8">8</a>)<P>We are reluctant to generalize our limited results to some of themajor efforts to share large ontologies, such as STEP.  (<a href ="#9">9</a>) However, our work does let us conclude that it is probablyvery worthwhile to identify the engineering problem to be solved asclearly as possible-that is, our formulation of the maintenanceproblem-and then assess the information that needs to be shared andhow different integration architectures can support the definedneed. We have found that the sharing mechanism can easily become farmore complex than necessary to support the engineering objective.<P><b>Situation assessment</b>. The SA hybrid MBD, heuristic classification, andCBR approach offers a number of benefits; it<P><ul><li>Uses knowledge of plant design, specifically of the form, function,and behavior of the plant, because the MBD approach reasons aboutcomponent definitions, processes, and topologies explicitly.<P><li>Uses diagnostic knowledge of plant operators, because operators canadd important cases at will, using the CBR technique or heuristicclassification rules, and because they can annotate all cases with theproper engineering response to the situation, again using the CBRapproach.<P><li>Identifies implications of situations, because the MBD techniquepredicts behavior.<P><li>Does not require staff to identify all failure modes, because the MBDtechnique can be invoked exhaustively to find the behaviors thatemerge from various input conditions.</ul><P>On-line data-acquisition systems are finding broad use in the processindustry. While engineers always want more sensory data points, themonitoring systems often have valuable information that is not alwayseasy to use for maintenance management. The SA supports maintenancemanagement by integrating and interpreting the available data frommultiple sensors and multiple components.<P>The SA is designed to assist with systems diagnosis, not performspecialized diagnosis of individual isolated components. Potentially,it can accept input from specialized expert system diagnosticroutines, such as a vibration expert diagnostic system. The VAanalyzes an entire system to identify the potential system-levelcauses and effects of problems with individual components. The SA doesnot now do any data trending or quantitative prediction of theseverity or timing of predicted degradation.<P><b>Planner</b>. Oarplan represents the object, action, and resources ofplanned activities. Both planning and merging plans consider theseentities and their attributes. The number of such entities in themodel is far fewer than the number of activities that would otherwiseneed to be represented-the sum of the numbers of objects, actions, andresources is far less than the product of those three numbers.<P>In addition, the descriptions of objects, actions, and resources andthe topological and compositional relationships among objects describefundamental knowledge about designed systems. Reasoning from suchengineering principles gives generality to the planning procedure.<P>Also, the action elaboration and refinement lets the planning becomespecialized to support a particular planning purpose. Our experienceindicates that Oarplan shows both power and generality not previouslyfound in AI planning systems.<P>Oarplan does hierarchical planning. However, it is good engineeringpractice to aggregate some activities in a nonhierarchical order-forexample, to do resource-leveling in support of scheduling and to avoidundoing useful setup activities. Rather than attempt to compromise theconceptual simplicity of hierarchical planning and consider specialcases during the initial plan generation, the IRTMM planner uses asecond pass to merge activities and to introduce efficiencies andremove conflicts that are possible with hierarchical planning. Thefirst pass gives the generality to the planner; the second pass allowsit to accommodate specialized engineering details.<P>The IRTMM planner's effectiveness is limited by the quality of theplant and action models on which it works. As with all model-basedapplications, the quality of the planning model limits the quality ofthe generated plans. Thus, the model builder controls both the objectabstraction at which the planner works and the abstraction of theaction details generated during plan elaboration.<P><b>Value analysis</b>. The fan bearing problem fits the VA frameworknaturally. As shown by this and several other power industry testcases, the VA handles many power plant maintenance problems verywell. Given the power demand prediction, monetary information, andcomponent failure modes, the VA can provide maintenance choicesregarding timing, probability of survival, and the break-evenanalysis.<P>However, the calculation rests on the simplifying assumption that themaintenance returns the failing component to a new condition such thatit will not fail again by the same mechanism within the studyperiod. That is, the maintenance is assumed to be perfect. Thisassumption is plausible for those (frequent) cases when the studyperiod is short compared with the expected life of the repairedcomponent. If it is not short, the VA will return an overly optimisticresult, because it will underestimate the effects of recurrentfailure.<P>The perfect repair assumption also implies that the VA does notaccurately assess benefits of partial repairs. In both recurringfailure and partial repair cases, the VA produces an overly optimisticnet benefit because it normally ignores the cost of recurring repairs,the expected cost of failure introduced by an initial repair, and thecost of continued degraded performance following a partial repair.<P>The VA system has a forms-based graphic user interface that allowsusers to input required information. Thus, the VA user requires aknowledge of plant operational design and current status details. Itis important to understand the concepts of decision analysis, but thesystem protects the user from both its theory and the details of treegeneration and expected-value computation.<P><b>Implications for process plant operations</b>. Successful implementationof integrated maintenance systems such as IRTMM can favorably affectthe following risk factors for plant downtime:<P><ul><li><i>Procedure errors</i>--reduce their incidence, so that operators can predictthe effects of planned operations, which represent direct risk ofdowntime.<P><li><i>False alarms (proper response is to ignore)</i>--reduce their incidence,because they waste time, indicate a process that is not well managed,divert attention from real problems, and contribute to staffinsensitivity to true alarms.<P><li><i>Phone calls to technicians and engineers at home</i>--reduce theirincidence, because they indicate that staff lacks the access toknowledge or data to perform a job properly.<P><li><i>Phone trouble calls to technicians and engineers in the plant</i>--reducetheir incidence, because they indicate that staff lacks the access toknowledge or data to perform a job properly.<P><li><i>Alarms that do not indicate production impact (proper response is tofix a component, but production is not affected)</i>--increase theirincidence, because they indicate effective predictive maintenance.<P><li><i>Rework</i>--reduce its incidence, because it detracts from effectivemaintenance and is costly.<P><li><i>Timeliness</i>--reduce the time from the decision to perform maintenance orrepair to the time that repair is successfully completed, becausedelayed definitive repair simply adds breakdown risk.<P><li><i>Personnel and equipment use</i>--by reducing equipment downtime and helpingtechnicians to do the work right the first time with fewer calls forhelp, the system should help improve personnel and equipment use.</ul><P>We expect the following collateral, qualitative benefits to facilityoperation following implementation of a system with the capabilitiesof IRTMM: improved continuous training in details of as-built design,diagnosis, planning, and evaluation procedures; reduced stress forengineers and technicians, especially on short-staffed 12-hour shifts;qualitatively decreased time to design facility retrofit projects; andstartup and help operators to bring new plant facilities to peakproduction capacity faster. As the "Desktop engineering" sidebardescribes, the IRTMM system also affords great ease of use.<P>(See the <a href = "#sidebar">Desktop engineering sidebar</a>)<P>Plant engineers have suggested some possible extensions. Imminentfaults should be predicted on the basis of statistical process-controltrend analysis and potential failure modes. Also, P&ID objects shouldbe able to highlight themselves in layout diagrams, and components inlayout diagrams should be able to highlight themselves in theP&ID. Finally, P&ID objects should be able to show componentschematics and disassembly sketches.<P>SINCE COMPLETING THE ORIGINAL IRTMM research, we have done severalstudies of the potential feasibility of implementing some of the IRTMMideas.<P>We did major detailed studies of current maintenance managementpractices and methods in two industrial and governmentalagencies. Both organizations had plans to implement a CMMS, a databasesystem that would collect plant operational data from a distributedcontrol system and make it available in a database. The CMMS willprovide the operational plant data needed for the SA operation, and itcould hold generic plan and current demand and cost data for thePlanner and VA. Thus, current CMMSs provide an enabling technology forIRTMM, and IRTMM provides services that are not included in any CMMSconsidered by our clients.<P>The IRTMM system requires an accurate symbolic plant model. In onecase, a plant had reasonably accurate P&IDs, but because they wereavailable only in CAD vector form, the IRTMM system could notinterpret them as a symbolic model. In the other case, the owner didnot have accurate P&IDs. Creating an accurate P&ID would have involveda significant cost. Some of us have since started a promising researchproject to build symbolic models from P&IDs in CAD format. Finally,most plant engineers and technicians were highly enthusiastic aboutadding IRTMM capabilities to their technology-support infrastructure.<P><b>References</b><ol><a name = "1"><li>B.

The user can do what-if analysesconsidering changes in engineering, management, and business operatingassumptions. What-if analysis thus allows analysis from any of theseperspectives. It lets a user do holistic studies to explore the waysin which different perspectives interact. The symbolic plant model islargely nonnumeric, describing components, their functions andinterconnections, and their behavioral modes. The symbolic model couldbe complemented with a quantitative thermodynamic model.<P>Like a desktop publishing system, the IRTMM system has severalproperties:<P><ul><li><i>One or a few users.</i> Authority and decision-making responsibility arehighly centralized. The decision maker can obtain automatedsuggestions from multiple perspectives and can send recommendations toother human analysts.<P><li><i>Multiple integrated software applications.</i> Data can be taken readilyfrom one to another, both automatically and under usercontrol. Sometimes the applications will be built to beinteroperable-for example, in the IRTMM system-while in other casesspecial effort will be used to make diverse systems interoperate.<P><li><i>Presentation of a natural idiom (the P&ID) in a Wysiwyginterface.</i> Users can view their products in a natural way; changethem; review the effects of the change; and accept, modify, or retractthose changes. Interactive computer-aided design and P&ID displayswill be useful for many building- and facility-analysis applications.</ul><P>The IRTMM system includes several features not normally found indesktop publishing systems:<P><ul><li><i>ystem model.</i> In desktop publishing, the Wysiwyg interface changes theactual document. In desktop engineering, the Wysiwyg interface willnormally change a model of the system, rather than the system itself,so that the user can safely use simulation to test a what-ifoutcome. In some cases, the user will also use the interface tocontrol the modeled system.<P><li><i>Simulator.</i> In desktop publishing, a change propagates immediately tocause other changes without need for feedback. Engineering systemshave feedback in their control. The dynamics of change, as the finalstate, are of interest as well. A time-dependent simulator shows thosedynamics.<P><li><i>Open architecture.</i> In desktop publishing, a small set of vendorsprovide all the software applications. Users normally do not want toadd proprietary applications to the tool suite. For desktopengineering, users often have useful legacy systems that they want tocontinue to use, and they will continue to want to develop and usespecialized engineering applications.<P><li><i>Integration management.</i> Desktop engineering users need a manageableprocess to control passing of information among a changing set ofapplications.  <P></ul><P><BR><hr><i><a href="../../../expert.htm">IEEE Expert Online</a></i> | <a href="../../../depart.htm">Departments</a>| <b>Features</b> | <a href="../../../ai-www/ai-www.htm">AI onthe WWW</a> | <a href="board/board.htm">Editorial Board</a><br></p><p><a href="../../../../pubs.htm">Computer Society Publications</a> | <a href="../../../../../cshome.htm">ComputerSociety home page</a> </p><p>Send comments and questions about <i>IEEE Expert Online</i> to AnneHumphreys and Managing Editor Dick Price, <a href="mailto:ah34+@andrew.cmu.edu,dprice@computer.org">ah34+@andrew.cmu.eduand dprice@computer.org</a></p><p>Send general comments and questions about the IEEE Computer Society's Web site to <a href="mailto:webmaster@computer.org">webmaster@computer.org</a></p><p><font SIZE=-1>Copyright (c) Institute of Electrical and ElectronicsEngineers, Inc.

<TITLE>Internet Services</title><body bgcolor="#ffffff"><img src="../../../expert.gif"><p><a href="../../../depart.htm">Departments</a><P><blockquote><h2>Time for the Web to grow up?</h2><P><h3>Michael McCandless, MIT Laboratory for Computer Science<a href = "mike@sls.lcs.mit.edu">mike@sls.lcs.mit.edu</a></h3><P>New technologies often pass through similar stages indevelopment. First, the creators of the technology, driven by a visionto improve the world, push the technology forward. Once the technologyreaches a critical threshold, society adopts it and pulls it inunexpected directions. The Web is no exception. Until recently, theWeb was used primarily for fun by a small segment of society made upof folks who were comfortable with computers and networks and whothrived in the unmanaged, free spirit of the Internet. Now, as forcesunite to integrate the Web into society, it's time for the Web to growup.<P>The strongest of these integrating forces, technological progress, wasthe focus of the Fifth International Conference on the World Wide Webin Paris from May 6-10, just five months after the previousone. During his keynote speech, the creator of the Web, Tim-BernersLee, expressed disappointment over the Web's highly corporate natureand encouraged development of smaller communities based ontrust. Indeed, the Web has already grown beyond what he envisioned. Inthis column, I review the technological issues discussed at theconference and describe some of the other forces fueling the Web'sexplosive growth.<P><h3>Security and commerce</h3>One of the most effective uses of the Web for society will be on-linecommerce. Although many view the Web's perceived lack of security as amajor limitation, Adam Cain's excellent repeat tutorial on Websecurity makes it clear that technology will provide security wellbeyond what we tolerate in off-line commerce. It is only a matter oftime before society grasps the superior protection afforded by thesenew technologies.<P>The Secure Electronic Transactions protocol is an on-line paymentprotocol supported by corporations such as Microsoft, Mastercard,Visa, and CyberCash. SET, based on RSA Inc. cryptography, will leton-line customers pay merchants with credit, debit, orcorporate-purchasing cards. Unlike off-line customers, on-linecustomers will not expose their credit card numbers or personalinformation (names and addresses). Instead, they will use anauthenticated <i>permission slip</i> from their bank agreeing to pay exactlythe amount of the transaction. Credit card numbers cannot be stolen,and customers cannot be double-charged.<P>Other secure protocols are being developed for check-based payments aswell as for nontraceable cash payments. Related to SET, the World WideWeb Consortium (W3C) is developing the Joint Electronic PaymentsInitiative (JEPI), a prepurchase protocol that will let customers andmerchants negotiate which discounts apply and how to pay.<P><h3>Digital signatures</h3>The digital signature is a main component in secure protocols such asSET and JEPI. It looks like a random series of characters appended tothe end of a document or e-mail, but a nonreversible algorithmcalculates it using both the contents of the document being signed andthe signer's cryptographic key. Like a paper signature, a digitalsignature authenticates the signer's identity and indicates acceptanceof the signed document. Unlike a paper signature, a digital signatureuses strong cryptography to ensure that it cannot be forged. Otherscan later inspect the document to validate the signature, and thesigner cannot later deny having signed it.<P>The primary use of digital signatures is for authentication, but manyother uses are on the way. Users will be able to go to an off-linecompany, prove they are at least 18 years old, and obtain theircertification in the form of a digital signature. This certificationcan then be routinely used on line as proof of age. When userspurchase software on line, they'll have to sign it before running it,so that any distributed copies of the software will trace back tothem-the original users. Respected authorities will certify Javaapplets and other plug-ins, and browsers will run only certifiedapplets.<P>Software packages supporting digital signatures, such as Pretty GoodPrivacy (PGP), have been available for some time, making the creationof cryptographic keys used in digital signatures a simpleprocess. California and Utah have already passed laws regardingdigital signatures, and other states have bills pending. In thefuture, everyone will have her own cryptographic key for digitallysigning documents, just as everyone now has a telephonenumber. Because of the power and simplicity of digital signatures,they will play a critical role in all on-line interactions and in theWeb's integration into society.<P><h3>Web consortium protocols</h3>The W3C is developing many new protocols to improve our browsingexperience. Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) 3.2, announced during theconference, represents an effort to unify the many proprietaryextensions that various components have made. HTML math extensions, indevelopment now, will let authors include sophisticated mathematicalequations in their documents. The next generation of hypertexttransfer protocol, HTTP-NG, promises to improve overall performance,including support for efficient parallel loading of images.<P>Platform Independent Content Selection (PICS) is the W3C's proposalfor empowering parents to control what their children can see on theWeb. All Web content will be rated along dimensions such as violence,profanity, and nudity, by either content providers or independentorganizations. Parents will subscribe to rating services to set limitson what kinds of documents children can browse.<P>A system like PICS is a necessary step toward bringing the Web to themasses, but the issues and questions raised after this well-attendedtalk make it clear that PICS will encounter much opposition from thoseenjoying the unmanaged and free Internet spirit. Will sophisticatedsearch engines use more document categories, so that documents willhave to be rated along all dimensions? Will PICS backfire and make iteven easier to locate controversial sites? How can dynamic content,such as Java applets, be tagged? Will PICS attain the critical mass tocatch on? Will rating agencies become too powerful?<P>Cascading Style Sheets is a new protocol similar in spirit to LaTeXstyles, which will give authors better control over the detailedpresentation of HTML documents. CSS will let an author specify anincluded style sheet, which can recursively include other stylesheets, atop an otherwise standard HTML document. When loading andpresenting a document to a user, browsers will consult the author'sstyle sheet and merge it with the user's preferred style sheet.<P>The Protocol Extension Protocol is a proposed extension to http thatwill let a browser and a server negotiate and customize new protocolson the fly. Developers are creating various protocols using PEP,including JEPI and PICS. Using such immediate and automaticextensibility will be much faster than manually downloading newversions of browser software.<P><h3>The small-business explosion</h3>During his presentation, Stephen Fink from Digital described how theWeb is enabling incredible changes in business models. The Web greatlyreduces the advantages that large companies have over smallones. Small businesses are appearing all over and easily competingwith their large established counterparts.<P>Both CDnow (<a href ="http://www.cdnow.com">http://www.cdnow.com</a>), which sells musicCDs and some video tapes, and Amazon Books (<a href ="http://www.amazon.com">http://www.amazon.com</a>) are entirelyon-line ventures. They offer a much larger selection than theirclosest off-line competitors, because they do not keep aninventory. When a customer places an order and payment has cleared,they instruct the appropriate distributor to send the item directly tothe customer. They offer second-day shipping and secure methods forproviding credit card numbers (CDnow accepts a PGP-encrypted creditcard number via e-mail). Their ordering systems are highly automated;they neither rent retail space nor pay electric or heating bills; and,with no inventory, they rent minimal real estate. Customers can shopanytime, anywhere, without driving to a store or waiting in checkoutlines.<P>As Fink asked, "Can you feel the world changing?" His presentationmade me wonder: How will this impact the businesses that now thrive inour capitalistic economy? What will happen to the business model? Willthese on-line companies have any competitors? These new companies willsoon throw our economy, especially retail, into chaos.<P><h3>A few good links</h3>While these new technologies will soon improve our browsingexperience, the Web already provides useful resources for thosewanting to go beyond merely surfing for fun. Here are some of thesites I use. I bank with the Security First Network Bank(http://www.sfnb.com), an entirely on-line bank. I can check myaccount wherever and whenever, and pay bills on line by pressing a fewbuttons, without licking stamps, writing checks, or stuffingenvelopes. I purchase books at <a href ="http://www.amazon.com">http://www.amazon.com</a>, and compact disksat <a href = "http://www.cdnow.com">http://www.cdnow.com</a>. Inbuying my personal computer, the Web was an excellent source forcomparing prices and features and researching magazine articles. Ifind menus and other information for Boston restaurants athttp://www.hubnet.com; and all kinds of movie information, includingtimes, reviews, and short clips, at http://www.movielink.com. When Ihave a question about a medical condition or procedure, I consult AltaVista or Yahoo. I use many sources of up-to-date news and stockinformation (http://www.quote.com), and I visit home pages beforemeeting the people behind them.<P>These useful resources constitute another force that is pushing forthe integration of society and the Web. They save much time andenergy, and offer many benefits.<P><h3>A network computer</h3>The controversial Network Computer is poised to address the issue ofhow the world will be able to access useful resources on theWeb. Perhaps because it does not represent radically new technology,the NC received surprisingly little attention at the conference. TheNC, proposed by various companies, including Oracle and Sun, will be areduced PC, costing around $500 and dedicated to letting users easilybrowse the Web. It will be more like an appliance than a PC in that itwill turn on immediately and will be simple and intuitive to use. Itwill attach to the television and live next to the cable box, if itdoesn't replace it. Prototypes exist, and various companies arebuilding retail versions.<P>The NC has its share of skeptics. Andy Grove, CEO of Intel, describeshis customers' unending appetite for faster, more powerful, and betterPCs as evidence against the NC. Bill Gates, speaking recently at MIT,believes the NC is unnecessary because, under normal market pressures,PCs will soon be cheap enough to fill the same role. Toward this end,Microsoft is working on technology to make PCs easier to use.<P>Nevertheless, I believe the NC will soon have a major impact on theWeb. First, the NC will succeed because of the services it makesavailable. The French Mini-Tel system is a very simple telephone-baseddevice, yet it is widely used because of the services itenables. Second, our population is being bombarded daily with Webaddresses on radio and television, in newspapers, and inmagazines. Most people are not technologists and do not know muchabout PCs or Internet service providers, but they are eager to catchup with the Web. A simple appliance and corresponding service thatprovides cheap and easy access to the Web will catch on quickly. Mostlikely, people will not have to pay directly for the appliance but,rather, will pay a monthly subscription fee much like the existingpricing model for cable boxes and cellular telephones.<P>In marketing the NC, the question of software is far more importantthan the question of hardware. The challenge will be to design aninterface that is simple and intuitive, yet powerful enough so thatusers can do all they need to do on the Web. Given the difficulty ourmarket has had in designing the VCR, it could be a while before wesettle on an adequate NC interface.<P><h3>Growing pains</h3>Although necessary, some of the changes the Web will experience arenot viewed as positive in the climate of today's Internet. RobertMetcalfe, this year's IEEE Medal of Honor recipient, predicts that theInternet will effectively collapse in 1996, because it is being usedfor something it was not designed for. He jokes about companiesoffering software to enable free "long-distance telephone calls"across the Internet. Access will become prohibitively slow, hosts willnot be found, and other problems will spread.<P>James Clark, chair of Netscape, speaking recently at MIT,disagrees. He feels that the evolution of the current Internet, simplythrough the extension of existing connections and backbones, will besufficient to accommodate increased traffic.<P>Metcalfe's prediction might seem gloomy, but its fulfillment wouldhave some positive effects. If the Internet collapses, it will bepainful for a short while, but thereafter a new network would quicklyevolve, courtesy of eager telecommunications companies. This networkwould charge users for the bandwidth they use, and in return would beable to provide guaranteed bandwidth, real-time performance, and morereliability. These new network companies will use the money they earnto invest in new technologies such as asynchronous transfer mode(ATM), which will enable the new network. Such a for-fee network runsagainst the current Internet culture, but would enable many newservices. Perhaps this new fee-based network could coexist with theInternet, and those willing to pay for guaranteed performance could doso.<P>In addition, we must address the issues behind cryptography. Internetusers should compromise with governments. Governments understand justhow secure modern cryptographic technology is--and this, rightfully,scares them. A public-key escrow system will let government agencieswith proper cause decrypt our communications. I would like thegovernment to be able to enforce the laws that protect me, and apotential loss of some of my privacy is a fair price topay. International laws must evolve so that governments can worktogether on issues of cryptography.<P>These forces--new technology, existing Web resources, the NC, and arestless segment of our population-are now working together tointegrate the Web into our society. There will be questions to answerand setbacks to overcome. We must devise means to protect intellectualproperty. We need a fee-based infrastructure that can merge theIntranets with the Internet and enable more reliable, secureperformance. We must settle the issues behind global cryptography, sothat governments can protect their citizens with minimal invasion ofprivacy. And we should tag the documents we publish on the Web so thatothers can more effectively search them and control what theirchildren are exposed to. Finally, new laws must be enacted to addresson-line monopolies and to protect buyers.<P>Moreover, many off-line retail stores will go out of business and bereplaced by their more efficient on-line counterparts. Many otherquestions remain, but they'll have to be answered on the fly, becausethe Web is quickly growing on its own.<P><P><BR><hr><p><i><A HREF="../../../expert.htm">IEEE Expert Online</A></i> | <a href="../../../depart.htm">Departments</a> | <a href="../../../feature.htm">Features</a> | <A HREF="../../../ai-www/ai-www.htm">AI on the WWW</A> | <A HREF="../../../board/board.htm">Editorial Board</A><BR><p><P> <A HREF="../../../../pubs.htm">Computer Society Publications</A> | <A HREF="../../../../../cshome.htm">Computer Society home page</A> </P><p>Send comments and questions about <i>IEEE Expert Online</i> to Anne Humphreys and Managing Editor Dick Price, <a href=mailto:ah34+@andrew.cmu.edu,dprice@computer.org>ah34+@andrew.cmu.edu and dprice@computer.org</a></p><p>Send general comments and questions about the IEEE Computer Society's Web site to <a href=mailto:webmaster@computer.org>webmaster@computer.org</a></p><P><font size=-1><i>Copyright (c) Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc.

<h2>40 years and counting</h2> 


<h3>Stephen E. Cross</h3>

<p><img src="x2002a1.gif" hspace=10 border=0 height=203 width=150 align=left>

This summer marks the 40th anniversary of artificial intelligence as an identifiable field of study. The Dartmouth conference-actually a summer-long retreat of five researchers: Marvin Minsky, Oliver Selfridge, Allen Newell, Herbert Simon, and John McCarthy-marks the beginning of our field. I remember (has it been 15 years?) a panel discussion at the 1981 International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Vancouver, Canada, to commemorate AI's birth. The Dartmouth conference attendees described their early dreams, the accomplishments, and the unanticipated roadblocks.
<p>
What is the status of AI on the verge of its 40th anniversary? I guess it depends on whether you are an optimist or pessimist. Certainly the challenges that have been overcome can be credited with launching many other areas of computer science (for example, time-shared systems and object-oriented programming). I continue to be optimistic about AI for three reasons:

<p>
<ul>

<li><i>Excitement.</i> It is still the most exciting area of computer science.<p>

<li><i>Applicability.</i> AI technology has proven itself time and time
again in multiple domains.<P>

<li><i>Challenge.</i> Many of the visions mapped out at the Dartmouth
conference and discussed in the late fifties seem achievable before
our 50th anniversary.

</ul>

<p>

We will have more on the 40th anniversary in our August issue. One of
our board members, Peter Selfridge, will conduct an interview with his
brother and his father, one of the original founders. This "look back
and look forward" interview involving one of AI's first families
promises to be very interesting. But let me turn our attention to this
issue and describe how it illustrates the three points I mentioned
above.  <p>

<b>Excitement.</b> In this month's "Expert Opinion," where different
editorial board members share their expert views on a topic they think
is timely, Ernest Davis describes something of the malaise that has
descended on those of us in AI and contrasts it with the sheer
excitement of the field only a few short years ago. I think it is time
to get excited about AI again!<p>

<b>Applicability.</b> I can't think of any better argument that AI is
applicable than to look at the many engineering domains that are
exploiting the techniques developed over the past 40 years. I'm
grateful to Jim Garrett and Ian Smith for organizing the special track
of articles in AI in civil and structural engineering. April's track
on intelligent control continues in this issue. Sara Hedberg's
"Executive Insight" piece provides an update on "green engineering," a
field where AI continues to have an impact.<P>

<b>Challenge.</b> Please read the "Trends and Controversies"
department on digital libraries, organized by Craig Knoblock. One of
the visions discussed back in the 1950's was on-line, intelligently
organized libraries. Perhaps we were naive to think that this vision
was achievable solely through AI. Clearly it has taken 40-plus years
to develop an enabling infrastructure so that anyone can reach out
from anywhere and obtain the information he or she requires. It seems
that this infrastructure is almost here. The Internet (which has been
with us since the 1960's) and, more recently, the World Wide Web are
only the start to ubiquitous access. Soon we will have "anytime,
anywhere" access to vast stores of multimedia information, through the
integration of many kinds of networks (telephone, TV cable, satellite,
and so on). Those outside (and inside) AI are just beginning to
realize that AI is a key technology that can help organize, find,
retrieve, combine, and support use of this vast body of data and
information. This department on digital libraries illustrates these
opportunities and challenges.  <p>

I hope you will find this issue useful and enlightening. I thank the
guest editors, the members of the editorial board, and all those
listed on the masthead for continuing to improve <i>Expert's</i>
quality. Please let me know if you like what you read; if you have any
ideas for improvements or suggestions about areas we should cover,
drop me a line.<P>

Cross</h4><p>Many view us as the magazine that  deals with expert systems.  That has certainly been, and continues to be, an important coverage area  for the magazine.  But for several years, the magazine's major focus has been on intelligent systems and their applications.  During this time we have provided extensive coverage of technologies and applications generally considered  outside of set of the techniques used in knowledge-based systems (or more specifically expert systems).  Examples include genetic algorithms, neural networks, and evolutionary programming.  The "rest of our name" also means we seek to cover systems and the engineering aspects of developing, fielding, and maintaining large information systems that exploit AI technology.  Since not everyone means the same thing by intelligent system, I'd like to share with you my views (and biases).   It is based on an invited talk I gave at the National Conference on Artificial Intelligence in 1993 (see October 1993 issue, p. 80).<p>I'm motivated by the fact that AI has also been at the forefront of new ideas in computer science.  I view intelligent systems as the new frontier that will extend this legacy.  Intelligent systems are the "power tools" that enable people and organizations to cope with the overwhelming avalanches of multiumedia data and information that are available to them through the World Wide Web, through our office networks, and through our faxes, phones, and televisions.John Sculley created one vision of an intelligent system, the articulate information agent, in his 1988 Apple  "Knowledge Navigator" video.  This video depicted an intelligent agent that cooperatively solved problems with a human, engaged in human language dialog, and defined and solved problems, albeit within a limited domain of expertise.  A few years ago I viewed this as science fiction and was concerned that others viewed it as hype.  Now I'm confident that we have made progress in underlying technologies to allow us to consider building such systems (though still within bounded domains).  To do so, we must adopt a systems view.<p>A system is defined Webster as a "a regularly interacting or interdependent group of items forming a unified whole" and "a group of devices or artificial objects or an organization forming a network especially for distribution of something or serving a common purpose." Thus, in my view, an intelligent system requires the integration and interdependency of a variety of techniques for perceiving, thinking about, and acting in the world.  It is what I call the TACTful model since such systems must be taskable (in a natural way to humans), articulate (able to communicate effectively with humans and others systems), competent (can define problems and apply knowledge to solve those problems), and teachable (able to learn from experience - either through mentoring or a discovery process).  I suggest that such systems are at least an order of magnitude more difficult to build than expert systems because of the interdependency and integration required between what we usually view as disparate artificial intelligence techniques and methods.<p>The good news is that there are already many examples of intelligent systems today.  One kind of intelligent system is the autonomous systems with robotics being a member of that class.  The April issue was devoted to Robotic Systems. Two other classes are intelligent assistants and associates.  Assistants amplify human abilities in the search, filtering, fusion, and formatting of huge information spaces.  In terms of the TACT model, they are human-directed in that they employ domain specific communication and problem solving skills that are easily understood by and extended by a human user.  Victor Zue's paper in the October issue is a current example of an intelligent assistant for Web browsing and domain specific problem solving based on the Web search findings.  It uses both conventional internet technology coupled with speech understanding and other intelligent system techniques to provide information to a human user in a "decision ready form."  (Perhaps we should coin the term WOWSER  to illustrate its impact over more conventional browsers).  Another category is the associate system.  In terms of the TACT model, associates employ behavior which I call computer-initiated problem solving.  Through training with a human counterpart, they learn to infer the goals and plans of the human counterpart and have the ability to initiate problem solving in anticipation of demands for information. We have not built too many of these kind of systems yet, but their need is clearly us.  I'll be sharing more about my thoughts in coming EIC columns and I encourage you to share your thoughts with me.<p>In the coming issues we will be focusing on state of the art applications of intelligent systems in a number of application domains.  We will also include papers of significance with respect to new technology.  Beginning this month, we have revamped the <a href=../../../expert.htm><i>IEEE Expert</i> home page</a>. In the coming months you will be able to joint on-line discussion groups about topics of importance to you and have a constantly updated reference source for relevant information about intelligent systems.  We are exploring an option to include on-line publication of short papers (no more than 1000 words) with demonstrable software or active graphics.

Cross</h3><p><img src="x2002a1.gif" hspace=10 border=0 height=203 width=150 align=left>Moreon the title shortly, but first, welcome to another exciting issue of theIEEE Computer Society's magazine on intelligent systems. With each issueI seem to say that this one is our best yet. This one really is! We arealmost up to full speed with all the new departments I told you about lasttime. This issue begins a special track on intelligent control systemsand also includes two feature articles-one describing an autonomous vehiclethat completed a &quot;Hands-Free Across America&quot; tour last August,and another surveying recent expert systems. Craig Knoblock's &quot;Trends&amp; Controversies&quot; department looks at machine translation, andSara Hedberg's &quot;Executive Insight&quot; column highlights AI applicationsin tax systems (a timely subject for our US readers). In conjunction withour ongoing knowledge acquisition special track, the &quot;World Impact&quot;department focuses on work at the University of Amsterdam.</p><p>This month, we introduce two new departments. &quot;Expert Opinion&quot;provides an opportunity for <i>Expert</i>'s editorial board members toshare their visions and insights with our readers. Dan O'Leary, AssociateEditor-in-Chief, initiates this department with an overview of knowledgenavigation. Our new &quot;Internet Services&quot; department reviews lastDecember's &quot;Web Revolution&quot; World Wide Web Conference in Boston.Also, we're featuring an interview with Raj Reddy, 1995 Turing award winner,on the health of AI.</p><p><b>Reviewers are the bedrock of success</b> </p><p>I continue to get compliments on this magazine, which I readily accepton behalf of <i>Expert</i>'s Editorial Board and Managing Editor Dick Priceand his staff (see our masthead). However, we do not acknowledge the effortsof our reviewers nearly often enough. On page 11, we list the 87 men andwomen from all over the world who reviewed submissions to <i>Expert</i>during 1995. To each of them, on behalf of the readership, I extend myheartfelt appreciation. Their efforts are directly responsible for thesuccess of this publication. If you would like to serve the Computer Societyas a reviewer, please contact me at <a href="mailto:scross@cs.cmu.edu">scross@cs.cmu.edu</a>or Dick Price at <a href="mailto:dprice@computer.org">dprice@computer.org</a>.</p><p>The feedback we have gotten from Craig Knoblock's initial &quot;Trends&amp; Controversies&quot; department has been very gratifying. Upcomingpieces will deal with the AI's 40th anniversary, digital libraries, andlarge knowledge-base systems. If you have not read Craig's February installment,entitled &quot;The Future of Lisp,&quot; I suggest that you do. You'llalso find it on our home page, <a href="http://www.computer.org/pubs/expert/expert.htm">http://www.computer.org/pubs/expert/expert.htm</a>.Many thanks to Anne Humphreys (<a href="mailto:ah34@andrew.cmu.edu">ah34@andrew.cmu.edu</a>)for making this the best of the Computer Society's home pages.</p><p><b>Technology transfer challenges</b> </p><p>Recently, I had the opportunity to serve on the program committee forthe Innovative Applications of Artificial Intelligence Conference. Forpublication at this conference, a paper must describe a successfully deployedAI system. It is perhaps an attribute of our field that building such systemsis an effort both in software development and technology transfer. Manyof us have faced the challenge of being the first in our application areato introduce a user community to an AI application. That is often a frustratingexperience, at least initially.</p><p>In this column, I'd like to share some thoughts about technology transfer.I've been thinking a lot about it lately. It has been the major focus ofmy professional life for over 15 years now. <i>And it is hard!</i> About10 years ago, one of my masters students made an astute observation aboutsoftware development that I think is directly analogous to technology transfer.He said that there is a &quot;Bermuda Triangle&quot; phenomena in softwaredevelopment. As you may recall, the Bermuda Triangle is the region offthe US's Carolina coast where many ships and planes have mysteriously disappearedover the years. He observed that software requirements are often lost inthe &quot;triangle&quot; formed by software engineers, management, andend users. Consequently, the end product is often not what the end usersexpect or need. My experiences in technology transfer are very similar.</p><p>I have been involved in more than 20 major transfer efforts involvingnew or advanced intelligent systems technologies. These transfer effortshave primarily used demonstrations in an application context as the majortool to facilitate the transfer. We frequently used a rapid applicationdevelopment paradigm-hence, the similarities between my experience in technologytransfer and previously mentioned observations on software development.There have been failures (more than I care to remember, but each one instructive),many minor successes, and a few knockouts that have had profound and lastingimpacts.</p><p>As with my student's observation, technology transfer's Bermuda Triangleinvolves the triad of a technology community, a user community, and a communitythat maintains and supports an organization's information systems. I'llsimply call these technologists, users, and maintainers-names for eachvertex on the triangle may change, but the roles stay relatively constant.Simply put, technologists invent new technology and are usually more comfortablewith a <i>technology pull</i> approach to transition. They generally preferthat people who might benefit from the technology come to them and takeresponsibility for transferring it. (For reasons I will shortly address,this rarely works.) Users have real-world problems to solve and are generallyopen to using any technology or approach to solve the problems, as longas the effort to use the technology is minimal. Maintainers are cost-consciousand do not want to introduce solutions that do not meet standards or thatincur increased support or training costs.</p><p>In some cases, an organization's users or maintainers are interestedin advanced technology, and its organizational culture aspires to be &quot;hightech.&quot; These organizations are commonly called <i>early adopters</i>,but as Geoffrey Moore describes in <i>Inside The Tornado</i>,<a href="#ref1">[1]</a>typically only about 5% of organizations fall into this category. Mostusers and maintainers will stick close to the neighborhood surroundingtheir vertex on the triangle. The trick in successful technology transferis to figure out how to penetrate both user and maintainer neighborhoods.Getting into one is not good enough. You have to get into both. That meansyou have to move off your technology-centered vertex and into the spacesurrounding their user-centered vertices.</p><p>Some of the projects I've been involved in-the ones that failed-areones where I naively assumed that because my technology was the best, peoplewould flock to me to use it. They never did! Any introductory text on expertsystems teaches us to talk to the domain experts early and in their ownlanguage-that is, take a user-centered, rather than a technology-centered,view. When I took the effort to talk to end users in their own language,I could describe the impact of my technology in domain-specific terms.Thus, I was able to more easily create advocacy for the transfer projectsI wanted to do. </p><p>In the mid-eighties, some colleagues and I formalized this process andused it in several transfer projects. At the time, there were many otherpapers published on how to do expert-system domain selection (for example,the sections on domain selection in Waterman's 1986 <i>Guide to ExpertSystems</i><a href="#ref2">[2]</a> are still quite relevant). Our approachwas greatly influenced by this body of work, which is still quite applicableto technology transfer in general, not just expert systems. Our work producedsome interesting prototype systems, which we most often demonstrated onmanufactured (or toy) data. We also made the common mistake of prototypingour new technology on special equipment that did not easily migrate intothe users' world. Not surprisingly, not many of these applications madeit into production. Much later, I realized that engaging the maintenancepersonnel in the same kind of discussions we did with the users was critical.</p><p><b>Getting everyone on the same wavelength</b> </p><p>In the two most successful projects I've ever been associated with,we got users, maintainers, and technologists all on the same wavelengthearly in the project. By talking in the right language and assuming theresponsibility for making the transfer happen, we identified high-payoffapplication candidates early on. We also got agreement from the maintainerson how to accurately compare benefits versus insertion and support costs.We convinced influential people in each camp to be advocates of the transfer.We adopted a strategy of incremental integration into operational use,where metrics-based tests designed by the users and maintainers precededeach increment. I called these the mid-term and final exams. </p><p>The evaluation used metrics developed by, and meaningful to, the userand maintainer communities. Users provided test data to stress the systemand ensure the presence of the functionality they desired. Maintainersdeveloped similar tests dealing with robustness, their ability to makesoftware fixes, adequacy of training materials, and so forth. Significantly,the test data in these two cases faithfully replicated real-world datasets (complete with all the errors and nuances of the real world). Thus,we conducted and evaluated the exams in the real world. </p><p>Because we had good communication with both users and maintainers, wekept expectations bounded while still maintaining considerable enthusiasm.No one expected us to score 100% on the exams. Most often, improvementover the last exam sufficed. By scheduling the exams frequently (at leastevery three months), we sustained momentum at a pace new to the users andmaintainers. The bottom line in these efforts is that it was relativelyeasy to show return on investment. In fact, I never had to advocate the&quot;goodness&quot; of my technology. The users and maintainers did thatfor me.</p><p><b>&quot;No excuse&quot; technology transfer</b> </p><p>What I'm sharing with you, in a rather open way, is probably commonsense to many of you. But I see many in our community continually strugglingwith these issues, some much more successfully than I did and many significantlyless so. Others have published insightful works on the subject. For example,George Heilmeier's experiences are illuminating. Heilmeier, Bellcore'sCEO and winner of the National Academy of Engineering Founder's Medal in1992, described seven basic tenets of his &quot;no excuse&quot; technologytransfer policy:<a href="#ref3">[3]</a></p><ol><li>Formulate a &quot;catechism&quot; to include a description of whatyou are trying to do, how it is done now, the new ideas, its anticipatedimpact, and schedule and costs.</li><li>Recognize &quot;productization&quot; as a necessary, crucial activity.</li><li>Identify receivers of the technology and ownership of the transferearly.</li><li>Make maximum use of common equipment.</li><li>Initiate the transfer process immediately after demonstrating feasibilityin the laboratory.</li><li>Make sure manufacturing proves the methods developed in the laboratorybefore initiating efforts to improve them.</li><li>Keep the laboratory involved in the productization and manufacturingphases through completion of product qualification and achievement of costand performance goals.</li></ol><p>Heilmeier's rules grew from his experiences in introducing new electronicsand manufacturing technology into production use when he was at RCA Laboratoriesin the early sixties. They are words to the wise to those of us in intelligentsystems, nonetheless.</p><p>If any of this strikes you as interesting or useful, please drop mea line at <a href="mailto:scross@cs.cmu.edu">scross@cs.cmu.edu</a>.

<TITLE>AI Models</title><body bgcolor="#ffffff"><img src="../../../expert.gif"><p><a href="../../../feature.htm">Features</a><P><blockquote><h3>AI Models for Business Process Reengineering</h3><P><b>Eric S.K. Yu and John Mylopoulos, University of Toronto<br> Yves Lesprance, York University</b><P><font size=4><i>Most models fail to capture the rationale behind processes, makingbusiness reengineering less effective. The authors describe their i*framework, which views organizations as collections of actors withstrategic interests, and interdependencies involving goals, tasks, andresources. The authors also describe the ConGolog framework, whichsupports reasoning about the dynamics of processes under incompleteknowledge.</i></font><P>Competitive pressures, customer demands, and ever-changing regulatoryconditions are forcing many companies to rethink the way they dobusiness. A fundamental part of this rethinking process is to linkproduction procedures and organizational services to business goalsand objectives. At present, there is little formal support for thiskind of reasoning. Business process design is usually done informally,and individual design decisions are hard to relate to businessobjectives.<P>Traditional modeling techniques-structured analysis, dataflowdiagrams, and entity-relationship diagrams-describe what a businessprocess is, but they cannot express the why of the process-themotivations, intents, and rationales behind the activities andentities. This is a serious drawback. A central argument in businessprocess reengineering is that if you don't understand why things aredone the way they are, you are likely to automate outdated processes(leading to the proverbial "paving of the cow path") and miss theopportunity to innovate the process itself.<P>In choosing among alternative business processes, analysts must beable both to describe relationships and to propose and argue aboutsolutions from strategic perspectives. Artificial intelligence ingeneral and knowledge representation in particular can help inmodeling organizations and in analyzing alternatives.<P>Recognizing the value of AI in this area, we developed a framework formodeling and analyzing organizations in support of severalapplications, including business process reengineering. (<a href ="#1">1,2</a>) The i* framework (i* stands for distributedintentionality) views processes as involving social actors who dependon one another for goals to be achieved, tasks to be performed, andresources to be furnished. The i* framework includes two models:<P><ul><li> Strategic Dependency Model, which describes the network ofrelationships among actors.<li> Strategic Rationale Model, which describes and supports thereasoning that each actor has about its relationships with otheractors.</ul>We have formally represented these models in the conceptual modelinglanguage Telos (<a href = "#3">3</a>) and have based their semanticson intentional concepts-goal, belief, ability, and commitment-studiedin work by Philip Cohen and Hector Levesque. (<a href = "#4">4</a>)<P>To complement the i* framework's strategic level of reasoning, we usea logic-based framework, ConGolog, to model the detailed dynamics ofthe business environment and processes being redesigned. The frameworksupports the validation and verification of business processes usingsimulation and automated reasoning techniques. Users can reason aboutprocesses even with only a partial description of the world state.<P>In this article, we show how the i* models and ConGolog aid theredesign of claims processing in an automobile insurance company. Wealso describe a toolset that aids analysis using these models, whichwe are currently developing at the University of Toronto. The modelsand their associated tools incorporate a number of AI techniques,including means-ends analysis, qualitative reasoning, agent modeling,and theories of action.<P><h2>The problem</h2>In business processes-and the information systems that supportthem-there is a kind of understanding entrenched as implicitassumptions. Organizations often ignore these assumptions duringanalysis because they are using traditional modeling techniques. Yet,without this deeper level of understanding, an organization will findit difficult to meet changing needs, as evidenced by the problem oflegacy business processes and legacy information systems.<P>Most business processes involve many participants or players, withcomplex relationships among them. These relationships are strategic inthe sense that each party is concerned about opportunities andvulnerabilities and seeks to protect or further its interests. Toillustrate our framework, we borrow a hypothetical example fromMichael Hammer and James Champy, who describe a redesign of anautomobile insurance company's business processes. (<a href ="#5">5</a>) Our focus here is the attempt to redesign claimsprocessing.<P>In analyzing the problem, the team might ask<ul><li> Why does it take so long to have a claim settled after anautomobile accident?<li> Why does the company hire appraisers to assess damages?<li> How else can claims be settled?<li> What other concerns would arise if these new ways of handlingclaims were adopted?</ul>The parties concerned are the company and its representatives and thecustomer. The company wants to minimize payout to claimants, so ithires appraisers, who keep repairs to the necessary minimum. At thesame time, it wants to keep customers happy so that they continue torenew their policies. Car owners (the customers), on the other hand,want repair damages to be assessed fairly, and are likely to get bodyshops to give repair estimates that maximize the payout. Theinformation that the claims representative collects and uses (accidentparticulars, witness statements) and that the appraiser collects anduses (photographs of damage, multiple repair estimates) reflect thestrategic interests of these parties.<P><h2>Strategic Dependency Model</h2>The Strategic Dependency Model is a graph in which each noderepresents an actor, and each link between two actors indicates thatActor 1 depends on Actor 2 for something that will let Actor 1 attainsome goal. Without that something, Actor 1 would not be able toachieve the goal as easily, as well, or at all. We call Actor 1 thedepender, and Actor 2 the dependee. The object around which thedependency centers is the dependum. The depender is vulnerable to thedependee. If the dependee fails to deliver the dependum, the dependerwould be adversely affected in its ability to achieve its goals. A carowner, for example, can have his car repaired by a body shop, even ifhe does not have the ability to do the repairs himself. However, he isvulnerable to the car not being repaired.<P>Figure 1 shows the Strategic Dependency Model for a traditionalautomobile insurance business configuration. The model specifies fourtypes of dependencies, according to the type of freedom allowed in therelationship between the depender and the dependee.<ul><li> In a goal dependency, an actor depends on another actor to bringabout a certain state or condition in the world. The dependee is giventhe freedom to choose how to accomplish it. The car owner in Figure 1,for example, just wants the car to be repaired; he does not (usually)tell the body shop how to repair it.<P><li> In a task dependency, an actor depends on another to carry out anactivity. The task specification prescribes how the task is to beperformed. In Figure 1, for example, an appraiser must follow companyprocedures when appraising damages.<P><li> In a resource dependency, an actor depends on another for theavailability of some entity. Resources can be physical orinformational. In Figure 1, for example, the body shop expects the carowner to pay for repairs.<P><li> A soft-goal dependency is similar to a goal dependency exceptthat there are no a priori, sharply defined criteria for success. Themeaning of the soft goal is elaborated on and clarified between thedepender and the dependee in terms of the methods that might be usedto address it. In Figure 1, for example, insurance companies can usevarious methods to attract and keep customers, but it is up to thecustomers to decide which methods make them happy.<P></ul><img src ="x40161.gif"><P><b>Figure 1. Strategic Dependency Model of traditional claims processingin an automobile insurance company (the "as is" arrangement).</b><P>The model also distinguishes three levels of dependency strength-open,committed, and critical-according to vulnerability. We do not showthese in the figure, but briefly they are<P><ul><li> Open. Not obtaining the dependum would affect the depender tosome extent but not seriously.<P><li> Committed. Not obtaining the dependum would cause some action tofail that the depender has planned in achieving a goal.<P><li> Critical. Not obtaining the dependum would cause all actions tofail that the depender has planned in achieving a goal.<P></ul>Figure 1 captures several dependencies. The car owner depends on theinsurance company to reimburse him for the repairs from an accident(ClaimsPayout). For this, the car owner pays an insurance premium toget coverage (RepairsBeCovered). The insurance company wants to offergood service to the customer to keep the business(CustomerBeHappy). To maintain profitability, the company depends onappraisers to appraise damages so that only the minimal necessaryrepairs are approved. The car owner depends on the claims appraiserfor a fair appraisal. However, the appraiser can be expected to act inthe interests of the insurance company, because she depends on thecompany for employment. The car owner, in turn, can depend on the bodyshop to give an estimate that maximizes his interests, because thebody shop depends on the car owner for repeat business.<P>This kind of analysis reveals important aspects of the claims processthat traditional process models would miss.<P>Figure 2 shows the changes in dependencies when the process-redesignteam explores innovative solutions to claims processing. Because itcosts as much to process a small claim as a large claim, one way toreduce administrative costs is to reduce insurance company involvementin handling small claims. The team asked, "Why not let the insuranceagent handle small claims?" The insurance agent would do all theinquiry and payout, while the insurance company would concentrate onlarge claims that more significantly affect profit. The agent gets tocement his relationship with the customer, while the customer is morelikely to get a fair hearing from the agent about a fair payoutamount. This keeps the customer happy, which is what the insurancecompany wants.<P><img src ="x40162.gif"><P><b>Figure 2. Strategic Dependency Model for redesign proposal "Let theinsurance agent handle the claims."</b><P>As Figure 2 shows, shifting the claims-handling responsibilities fromthe appraiser to the insurance agent means that the agent'sinformation needs must change radically. For example, the appraiser isnot even involved in small claims. Using the new configuration ofstrategic dependencies, the team can derive the information that mustbe shared among or sent to insurance agents and the insurance company,and decide how accurate and up-to-date the information must be.<P>Once the team ventured from the traditional wisdom of how an insurancebusiness should run, even more radical solutions emerged. One was "Whynot let the body shop handle the claims?" Traditionally, body shopsare not likely to be on the side of the insurance company. Forexample, you wouldn't expect an insurance company to be willing to payaccording to a body shop's repair estimates, because the body shop ison the customer's side, as Figure 1 illustrates. However, for smallclaims, it might not be a bad idea to bypass all the paperwork andhelp the customer get his car fixed as quickly as possible. This meetsthe customer's goal of having his car fixed promptly and, at the sametime, reduces costs dramatically for the insurance company.<P>Figure 3 shows the Strategic Dependency Model for this proposal. Thisproposal raises concerns about possible fraud, as indicated by theinsurance company's dependencies on the car owner and on the body shopnot to be fraudulent.<P><img src ="x40163.gif"><P><b>Figure 3. Strategic Dependency Model for redesign proposal "Let thebody shop handle the claims."</b><P>The Strategic Dependency Model encourages a deeper understanding of abusiness process by focusing on intentional dependencies among actors,beyond the usual understanding based on activities and entityflows. It helps identify what is at stake and for whom, and whatimpacts are likely if a dependency fails.<P>Although a Strategic Dependency Model provide hints about why aprocess is structured in a certain way, it does not sufficientlysupport the process of suggesting, exploring, and evaluatingalternative solutions. That is the role of the second model.<P><h2>Strategic Rationale Model</h2>Figure 4 shows the Strategic Rationale Model for the claims handlingrole in the redesign problem. Again, the graph has four nodetypes-goal, task, resource, and soft goal-but it also describes thereasoning behind each actor's relationships with other actors.<P><img src ="x40164.gif"><P><b>Figure 4. Strategic Rationale Model to support reasoning aboutreengineering the claims-handling process.</b><P>Process components. A process is often depicted as a collection ofactivities with entity flows among them (as in a workflow analysis). Aclaims-handling process includes activities such as verifying policycoverage, collecting accident information, determining who is atfault, appraising damages, and making an offer to settle. In theStrategic Rationale Model, we arrange these into a hierarchy ofmeans-ends and task decomposition links.<P>A means-ends link indicates a relationship between an end and a meansfor attaining it. For example, HandleClaimCentrally is one way toachieve ClaimBeSettled. Figures 1 through 3 represent three ways toachieve the same goal: As is, Alternative 1, and Alternative 2. "Asis" represents the approach in Figure 1; the alternatives representthe redesign approaches in Figures 2 and 3, respectively. Eachapproach contributes to the soft goals in different ways, such aslowering administrative costs or keeping customers happy.<P>By explicitly representing means-ends relationships, the StrategicRationale Model provides a systematic way to explore the space ofpossible new process designs.<P>A task-decomposition link describes the components of a task in termsof its subgoals, subtasks, resources, and soft goals. For example,HandleClaimCentrally consists of the subtasks VerifyPolicy,PrepareSettlementOffer, and MakeOfferToSettle.<P>Some task decompositions may involve dependencies on external actors.<P>Goal-based reasoning. In seeking ways to redesign a business process,goals are good places to look for improvement. An ambitious redesignmust both discover and rethink high-level goals. The redesign teamdiscovers high-level goals by asking why questions. Once the teamidentifies the high-level goals, they can seek alternatives by askinghow else the organization can accomplish those goals. In the sampleproblem, the redesign team wanted to consider radical solutions. Theyfirst identified the high-level goal "Claims must be settled" and thenbegan to think about how that goal could be accomplished other than tohandle claims centrally.<P>As Figure 4 shows, each alternative has different implications forseveral soft goals, such as CustomerBeHappy, FastProcessing, andProfitable. Although you can measure and quantify some soft goals, aqualitative approach is suitable at this stage of exploringalternatives. Contributions to soft goals can be positive or negative,and are judged to be adequate or inadequate. (Our treatment of softgoals is based on a framework developed by Lawrence Chung for dealingwith nonfunctional requirements in software engineering. (<a href ="#6">6</a>) <P>Means-end links and soft-goal correlations can be viewed asinstantiations of generic methods and rules. Consequently, processreengineers can use a knowledge base of generic business-processdesign knowledge in the form of methods and rules to suggest newsolutions and to identify related goals during process design. (<a href=#2>2</a>)<P><h2>ConGolog framework</h2>The i* models support strategic reasoning in exploratory designstages, but for validation and verification, process reengineers needa more precise characterization of the proposed processes. Forexample, a reengineer might want to simulate a process to observe itsbehavior under different conditions.<P>Most existing process models are deficient in that they cannot dealwith partial descriptions of world states. Such models describeprocesses only in terms of operations that produce new output states,given completely specified input states. Analysis of these modelsinvolves stepping through a process by instantiating it with a fulldescription of a world state. However, business processes haveuncertainties and are frequently open-ended or only partiallyspecified. In modeling such processes, it is important to be able tospecify and analyze partial models of business processes in thecontext of partial models of the world.<P>To address this need, we are adapting a logical framework forrepresenting and reasoning about actions and processes. (<a href ="#7">7,8</a>) The ConGolog (for concurrent Golog) framework addressesincompleteness in business-process specifications. The analyst modelsprimitive actions by specifying their preconditions and postconditionsin a logical language. Given a specification for a set of primitiveactions, the analyst can then specify complex processes using variouscontrol structures, including nondeterministic choice and concurrentexecution.<P>Figure 5 is an example of a ConGolog specification for a process thatdetermines the cost to settle an insurance claim. Note how ConGologspecifications include declarations of pre- and postconditions for theprimitive actions as well as procedures.<P><code><pre>precondition consultClaimFile(claim):	ClaimMade(claim) and ClaimFileOpened(claim)causes consultClaimFile(claim):	KnowWhoIs(agent, claimant(claim))% other preconditions and causes declarations left outprocedure determineCostToSettle(claim)	consultClaimFile(claim);	% concurrently get vehicle and medical appraisals	(	% pick a vehicle appraiser		choose v [VehicleAppraiser(v)?;			request(v,doVehicleAppraisal(claim))		]	((		if ClaimInvolvesMedicalExpenses(claim) then			% pick a medical appraiser			choose m [ MedicalAppraiser(m)?;				request(m,doMedicalAppraisal(claim))			]	(;	consultMedicalAppraisalReport(claim);	consultVehicleAppraisalReport(claim);	fileCostToSettleReport(claim)end procedure</pre></code><b>Figure 5. Example in ConGolog of a complex process specification.</b><P>ConGolog's modeling constructs make it suitable as a declarativemodeling language for business processes. The constructs include notonly sequencing (';'), conditional (if-then) and iterative constructs(while <condition> do() but also concurrent activity ('||'),nondeterministic choice (choose), and others. We have implemented aConGolog interpreter in Prolog, which supports the simulation of amodeled process. Noteworthy features of the framework include thefollowing:<P><ul><li> The primitive actions appearing in ConGolog processes can bearbitrary actions that change the world state (filing aclaim-settlement report, for example), rather than just assignments tovariables as in ordinary simulation languages like Simula; this worksbecause the user declares the action's preconditions andpostconditions.<P><li> The tests in ConGolog processes can refer to any world conditionmodeled; the interpreter automatically maintains the world modelrequired to simulate the processes on the basis of the pre- andpostconditions.<P><li> The framework incorporates a solution to the so-called frameproblem (discovering through a computationally tractable procedure allthings that the specified process does not change). In the context ofbusiness reengineering, it relieves the redesigner from having tospecify what aspects of the world don't change when an action isperformed.<P></ul>Analysts can evaluate process specifications in the framework using avariety of sophisticated reasoning methods. They can also use theframework to prove, simulate, and validate processproperties. Finally, the framework includes a model of what agentsknow and how they can acquire additional information throughknowledge-producing actions, such as communicating with users or otheragents or searching the environment for information.<P><h2>Analysis and design tools</h2>Apart from offering an inadequate ontology for organizationalmodeling, traditional organizational modeling techniques offer fewtools to support the analysis of organizational models. In designingthe i* framework, we kept in mind the need for such tools. Ourtoolset, which is still under construction, simplifies businessreengineering by assisting in the validation and verification of anorganizational model and the exploration of design alternatives.<P>The toolset consists of tools to analyze strategic relationships,redesign strategic relationships, perform qualitative reasoning,validate a model, and verify a process.<P>Strategic relationships analysis. This tool, based on the StrategicDependency Model, lets analysts construct, refine, and analyze thenetwork of strategic dependencies among actors: on the one hand, theyopen up opportunities (by letting actors achieve goals that areotherwise not achievable or not achievable to the same extent), but onthe other hand, they bring vulnerabilities (because the dependeeactors might not deliver). Analysis with this tool focuses onopportunities and vulnerabilities, and patterns of dependencies basedon the concepts of enforcement, assurance, and insurance. For a moredetailed analysis of dependency relationships, analysts can furtherdifferentiate actors into physically embodied agents, the roles theyplay, and the positions they occupy. (<a href ="#1">1</a>)<P>The tool also includes a graphical user interface for presenting andmanipulating the model.<P>For example, an analyst might use the tool to construct and analyzethe claim-processing model of Figure 1 (or its alternatives in Figures2 and 3), noting goals not being achieved, tasks not beingaccomplished, or resources not being furnished. The tool can also notelong chains of dependencies that suggest vulnerabilities, ordependency patterns that define conflict-of-interest situations.<P>Strategic relationships redesign. This tool, based on the StrategicRationale Model, explicitly supports the means-ends reasoning behindthe design of business processes. The basic idea of the tool is thatyou can obtain an understanding of the why behind process elements (orsteps) by following (querying) their links to process design goals (upthe means-ends hierarchy), extending the Strategic Rationale Modelwhen appropriate. Alternatively, given some design goals, you canexplore alternative ways for achieving them (down the means-endshierarchy). A knowledge base of generic means-end knowledge (methodsfor reducing errors, preventing fraud, and so on) and someknowledge-structuring mechanisms, such as classification andgeneralization, might simplify the process of traversing the means-endhierarchy. You could also use correlation rules6 to help detectcross-impacts among goals and identify design tradeoffs. We expectthis tool to be highly interactive and iterative.<P>One of the challenges in constructing a tool like this is to collect arepresentative body of means-ends knowledge in business processredesign to illustrate the tool's practical utility. We have taken afirst step toward meeting this challenge by collecting methods toachieve security, accuracy, and performance soft goals in the contextof nonfunctional requirements for information system design. (<a href ="#6">6</a>)<P>Qualitative reasoning support. This tool, adapted from work byLawrence Chung,6 is designed to make it easier to analyze a collectionof interdependent soft goals. In particular, given a soft-goaldependency graph and a list of satisficed and unsatisficeablesoft-goal nodes, the tool can label other soft goals as satisficed,unsatisficeable, or otherwise, depending on the types and destinationsof the interdependencies for each soft goal. (We adapted the terms"satisficed" and "satisficeable" from work by Herbert Simon,9 whocoined the word "satisficing." The terms mean that the soft goal hasbeen met to a sufficient, satisfactory degree.) The algorithms forpropagating labels across the soft-goal dependency graph usequalitative reasoning techniques. (<a href ="#6">6</a>)<P>The qualitative component of design reasoning is essential insupporting business process redesign. While quantitative measures areimportant in evaluating finished designs, they are of limited useduring the iterative design phase, when many competing (orcomplementary) goals must be traded off and new alternativesexplored. There is virtually no support for this type of analysis inexisting tools.<P>Process model validation. This tool helps confirm that a process modelis consistent with the modeler's understanding of the process. Thetool validates the process model by letting the user simulate processexecution. Given a description of the conditions in effect at thebeginning of a business process, the tool answers queries about theworld state as the process proceeds. The tool offers a declarativelanguage for process specification and can simulate processes evenwhen a process or its initial state are only partially specified.<P>This tool, under development, derives from the ConGologinterpreter. Given a process specification and a partial descriptionof an organizational state, the simulation tool will answer questionsabout the state of the organization during and after the process hasbeen carried out. Such symbolic simulations require a sophisticatedtheoretical foundation for reasoning about action, including handlingthe frame problem.<P>Process verification. Along similar grounds, the goal of the processverification tool, also being developed, is to help verify that aspecified process satisfies given properties-in particular, stateconstraints (analogous to integrity constraints in databases). Given aset of process specifications and a set of constraints that theprocess must maintain, the tool will suggest strengthenedspecifications to ensure that those constraints are maintained.<P>Like the validation tool, this tool must address long-standing AIdilemmas, such as the frame problem (how to specify actions withoutenumerating all the properties of the world that are not affected) andthe ramification problem (how to compute the indirect effects ofactions). Although these two tools are based on the same theoreticalfoundation, we expect them to use different inference engines, employdifferent algorithms, and handle different classes of problems.<P>Integration issues. Although each tool now exists separately as aresearch prototype, we plan for them to work synergistically through aknowledge management layer. Figure 6 illustrates the proposedintegration.( <a href ="#10">10</a>)<P><img src ="x40166.gif"><P><b>Figure 6. Tool-integration architecture.</b><P>The integrated architecture will employ a message bus, whose functionis to support information interchange among tools that, althoughdeveloped independently, can benefit from information sharing. The buswe plan to use, the Telos Message Bus, was developed in the context ofa software-engineering research project. In its current form, the bususes an extensible object model, Telos, (<a href ="#3">3</a>) along with a message-basedcommunication protocol system called mbus. In addition, theintegration architecture includes a repository, which uses the Telosknowledge-base management system to store sharable information amongthe integrated tools. We have already implemented the repository inC++, using a commercial object-oriented database system as itspersistent storage manager.<P>AS ORGANIZATIONS STRIVE TO KEEP UP, there will be a greater demand formodeling and analysis tools that can help capture and analyze thestrategic relationships among business work units and externalplayers, such as customers, suppliers, and business partners. Adoptinga knowledge representation and reasoning approach to organizationalmodeling and reengineering makes it easier to connect businessprocesses and underlying business objectives. It also provides theformal foundation for several different analysis tools that can helpanalysts explore alternatives and lend credibility to the product oftheir work. Models constructed in terms of our approach also make iteasier to develop information systems to support the reengineeredbusiness processes.<P>Our current effort is to complete the integration of the toolset andintegrate the i* models and the ConGolog framework into a singleframework, which we plan to call Tropos. Among other things, Troposwill use a context mechanism to support the management of multipleactor viewpoints and to keep track of design alternatives. We are alsoexploring the use of verification techniques. (<a href ="#11">11</a>)<P>Efforts are also underway to explore methodological issues in applyingthe modeling and reasoning techniques to several case studies,including one involving procedures for power-plant operators.<P><h2>Acknowledgments</h2>This research is funded in part by the Information Technology ResearchCentre of Ontario and by the Natural Sciences and Engineering ResearchCouncil of Canada.<P><b>References</b><ol><a name = "1"> <li>E.

Worldwide, Siemens currently has morethan 20 neural-network applications running in a dozen plants, 24hours a day. For example, its metallurgy plants use neural-networkcontrol applications in their electric arc furnaces (EAFs) and hotrolling mills to predict such factors as rolling force, rolling-stocktemperature, natural spread, and short-stroke or electrode positions.<P>Several aspects of neural networks contribute to their usefulness forthe steel industry. First, they speed the development of newapplications. In the past, steelmakers had to develop and programspecial analytical models, a laborious and time-consumingprocess. Neural networks are simple mathematical structures thatgather knowledge by learning from examples, which a computer can doautomatically. Besides being so much quicker and easier, neural modelsalso often achieve better performance than do analytical models inpractical applications.<P>Second, neural networks can handle highly nonlinear problems, makingthem vastly superior to classical linear approaches. Finally, neuralnetwork are able to adapt on line. Steel plants experience dailyprocess fluctuations, called the <i>drift</i> or <i>daily condition</i> bysteelworkers, which can wreak havoc for static analyticalmodels. Mathematically, this drift represents some missing input tothe network. A special neural topology developed at Siemens can adapton line to these long-term fluctuations.<P>Applying our solutions to real-world technical processes at Siemensrequired that we surmount several challenges, which involved extensiveengineering effort. In particular, we needed to<P><ul><li>Improve the control system without discarding existing solutions.<li>Cooperate intensively with experts to analyze the importance of thevarious process inputs.<li>Develop user-friendly software and algorithms with few controlparameters for the application engineers.<li>Develop robust, efficient learning algorithms capable of on-linelearning.<li>Design additional learning strategies such as initial learning when nodata are available before the production starts or when the planthardware changes suddenly.<li>Pre- and post-process robust data and filter it for the very noisy datatypically encountered in steel plants.<li>Install data-acquisition systems with fast databases for on-linestorage of enormous amounts of data.</ul>Most of our neural solutions involve second-level control, which meansthe neural networks serve to predict the setpoints of the basiccontrol (Level 1). This also helps guarantee stability in the steelindustry's rough environment.<P><b>Electric arc furnace-a hybrid system</b>. Steelworkers melt steel scrap inEAFs to produce high-grade steel. Such highly efficient plants accountfor 30% of all raw steel produced worldwide.<P>At Siemens, we developed a method of optimizing EAF control thatcontinuously feeds the highest possible power into the process. Thismethod involved developing a new analytical model (Figure 2) thatcombines with a neural network to form a hybrid system. Because theneural network-and thus the hybrid model-is adapted on line, the modelcan determine the ideal operational parameters. Switching off ourneural-based optimization decreases electric efficiency by 9.5%(Figure 3). A neural network capable of on-line adaptation andlearning from the past considerably enhances conventional methodsbased on static lookup tables.<P><img src = "x40042.gif"><P><b>Figure 2. This hybrid model optimizes the operation of an electric arcfurnace under constantly changing conditions.</b><P><img src = "x40043.gif"><P><b>Figure 3. Power curve using the optimization technique at KruppNirosta. Neural network-derived optimization increases the activepower of the melting process, while satisfying all boundaryconditions.</b><P>From the electrical engineer's viewpoint, the EAF is an unbalancedload with nonlinear, time-dependent characteristics. The hybrid-modeloptimization method provides the optimal setting parameters, which acascade-regulating circuit then maintains at a constant level (Figure2). Cascaded optimization calculations provide the boundaryconditions, which involves making trade-offs between the maximum powerabsorption (resulting in a shorter melting time) and increased thermalstress. Steelmakers can tailor the weighting of these incompatibletarget variables by setting economic, technical, and legalparameters. In all, this method provides an intelligent tool thatallows steel manufacturers to maintain required target variables.<P>In September 1994, the Krupp Nirosta plant implemented the neuralnetwork-based optimization in a furnace for stainless steel with anannual capacity of 720,000 tons (Figure 4). Having a 150-ton capacity,it is one of the world's largest EAFs used in the production ofspecial steels. The new system cuts energy costs by over one milliondollars a year. Also, the tap-to-tap time, a measure of plantproductivity, has improved by 5%.<P><img src = "x40044.gif"><P><b>Figure 4. At the Krupp Nirosta plant, a neural network-basedoptimization method manages one of the world's largest electric arcfurnaces used in the production of special steels.</b><P><b>Predicting rolling stock temperature with on-line adaptation.</b> In hotrolling mills, the temperature of the material is an important factorfor precalculating specific control parameters. Steelworkers, however,cannot determine the stock temperature at each gap in the roll ofsteel beforehand. Instead, they must predict it using a hybridmathematical-model/neural-net system. The mathematical modelcalculates the steel stock's temperature variation from its entry toits exit in the finishing mill, based on measurements that follow thestock's passage through the roughing mill, which precedes thefinishing process. During the next strip pass, steelworkers measureand postcalculate the temperature curve. This measurement provides newtraining data for the net's on-line adaptation.<P>On-line adaptation was the breakthrough in most of our steel industryapplications. To guarantee stability in the on-line adaptation (theadaptation process of the neural network in combination with the plantis a closed-loop process), Siemens developed a new topology of neuralnetworks. Figure 5 shows the efficiency of our rolling-stocktemperature prediction approach. Compared to conventional solutions,neural nets improved temperature prediction accuracy by 25%.<P><img src = "x40045.gif"><P><b>Figure 5. On-line adaption versus static network. On-line adaptiondecreases the effort in temperature prediction. The error of a staticnetwork (upper line) increases dramatically over time. The error ofthe adaptive network (lower line) remains at 1&#176;C.</b><P>In conclusion, unlike conventional control and regulation techniques,neural networks can modify their responses and dynamic characteristicsthrough a learning process. Like humans, they recognize keyprocess-specific features and derive optimal strategies to control theprocess. The concept behind the techniques we have described can applyto many areas that require nonlinear or hybrid modeling and theoptimization of nonlinear objective functions under any linear ornonlinear constraints.<P><b>References</b><P><ol><a name = "1"><li>T.

Cross</h4><P>Welcome to another issue of <I>IEEE Expert</I>. I think this isour best issue yet! It should be interesting to see how two differentindustries-steelmaking and telecommunications-are exploiting intelligentsystems technology. And in this issue we start a special trackon knowledge-based acquisition.<P>I'm indebted to the guest editors, J&uuml;rgen Dorn, V. Seshardi,and Walter Van de Velde, for their efforts. (Note that Walter'sknowledge acquisition guest editor introduction will appear inthe April issue, along with a related World Impact report on theSWI knowledge technology department at the University of Amsterdamby Guus Schreiber and Bob Wielinga.)<P>I'd like to review the changes we have made over the past yearand some of our plans for 1996. Probably the most obvious changeappears our cover, which now more accurately reflects the contentsinside. As I've described in several past EIC messages, our charteris <I>intelligent systems</I> and our cover now explicitly reflectsthat.<P>Another change is our length. The IEEE Computer Society approveda request we made at the annual meeting last December in San Diegoto increase <I>Expert's </I>page budget by 48 pages per year.These extra pages will allow us to publish more feature articlesand departments. The approval represents a significant vote ofconfidence by the Computer Society, as this was the only magazineto receive approval for an increased page budget.<P>Finally, I'm happy to introduce a new department with this issue: &quot;Trends and Controversies.&quot; Craig Knoblock at the University of Southern California Information Sciences Institute will be the permanent department editor. His first installment deals with the future of Lisp. Craig has assembled an excellent set of commentaries and insights from leaders in the field. We intend this department to be an active feature and encourage your comments to Craig at <a href=mailto:knoblock@isi.edu>knoblock@isi.edu</a>. We will post the resultant discussions onto a department bulletin board on Expert's home page (<a href=../../../expert.htm>http://www.computer.org/pubs/expert/expert.htm</a>). Future department features will deal with very large knowledgebases, the role of AI in digital libraries, and statistical versusknowledge-based approaches to machine translations. We'd appreciateyour ideas for other topics as well.<P>I'm gratified by the positive press our technology seems to bereceiving from various quarters. One of my favorite sources forinformation about the general field of intelligent system applicationscontinues to be magazines such as <I>Business Week</I>. Of lateI have noticed many short articles about innovative, successfulapplications of data mining, speech understanding, and neuralnetworks, to name a few. It is also gratifying that our parentmagazine, <I>Computer</I>, is focusing many of its upcoming specialissues on &quot;hot topics&quot; in intelligent systems-amongthem natural language processing, agent technology, neural networks,and intelligent systems.<P>Although I'm very happy with the status of the magazine and theexcellent support from both the Computer Society staff, the EditorialBoard, and the many people who have volunteered to review papers,I must admit that much remains to be done. This was reinforcedby the excellent comments you provided to our &quot;Sound Off&quot;request in a recent issue. (See the Soundoff Feedback on page81.)<P>You responded with many excellent suggestions for interviews,enhanced case studies, assessment methodology and criteria, andspecial issues in technology areas such as data mining, intelligentagents, natural language, and medical applications of AI. We willtry to accommodate these requests during the next 18 months, bothin this magazine and in collaboration with other Computer Societymagazines.<P>I want to briefly address one comment that struck me as a seriousneglect in my previous editorial policy. One of our colleaguescriticized <I>Expert's</I> lack of emphasis on evaluation. I couldnot agree more! One of my major goals for 1996 is to rectify this.To this end, I will do three things:<UL><LI>I hope to have a mini-symposium on the topic of evaluation.<LI>I plan to feature our Industry Advisory Board's position andinsights on this topic (more on the IAB in my April EIC message).<LI>I hope to reflect great emphasis on evaluation in our futureselection process.</UL><P>On behalf of your Editorial Board, I welcome James Hendler tothe board. Jim is a professor of computer science at the Universityof Maryland, College Park, and a well-known authority in naturallanguage understanding, planning, intelligent agents, and parallel-processingimplementation of AI methods. Jim did not hesitate to sign upfor challenging tasks. He is coordinating our October 1996 issueon intelligent agents, which will appear in conjunction with anupcoming special issue of <I>Computer</I> on the same topic.<P>There are two significant changes on the Computer Society staffto report as well. John Charles, an assistant editor on <I>Expert</I> for the past year, has returned to the University ofVirginia to complete his PhD in literature. John will continueto supply occasional news stories (see pp. 82-82). Tom Centrellais the new assistant editor. Tom previously supported <I>Computer</I> and is already making a significant impact. He is a formerUnited States Air Force officer, high school teacher, and engineeringgraduate who writes songs in his spare time. The quality of themagazine is directly related to the high powered credentials andenergy of the Computer Society staff. <I>Expert</I> is lucky tohave the best of the best!<P>Please keep sending me your comments, suggestions, and criticisms.I'm at <a href=mailto:scross@cs.cmu.edu> scross@cs.cmu.edu</a>. And please recommend this magazine to your colleagues.<h3>Coming in April</h3><P><B>Intelligent Control</B><P>Special theme edited by Kevin M.

<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>AI &amp; taxes</TITLE></HEAD><body bgcolor="#ffffff"><img src="../../../expert.gif"><p><a href="../../../dept4-96.htm">Departments</a><P><blockquote><h2>Executive Insight</h2><P><h3>AI &amp; taxes</h3><P><B><a href=#Hedberg>Sara Reese Hedberg</a></B><p>Many of us in the United States have a love/hate relationship with April. Days are warming, gardens are awakening, spring is springing, and taxes are due.</p><p>For more than a decade, the Internal Revenue Service, the US government agency responsible for tax collection, has had an AI Lab. This article looks at some IRS AI systems in production and field testing, as well as some future directions for AI at the IRS.</p><p>In keeping with the tax theme, I'll also look at Kiplinger TaxCut, a tax-preparation program for individual US tax returns. (To long-time AI watchers, this program started as AskDan in the mid-eighties.) In a recent review of this year's tax software, <i>Business Week</i> gave TaxCut top rating.<a href=#ref1>[1]</a> Look under the covers of this off-the-shelf package, and you'll see an expert system--one of the most widely used expert systems in the world.</p><p><b>IRS expert systems</b></p><p><a name=return>The</a> IRS has a big job. Each year, individuals, businesses, and corporations file more than 200 million tax returns with the IRS; about 115 million of these are from individuals. Processing these returns, ensuring that they are accurate and complete, and communicating with taxpayers is a monumental task. As part of its efforts to automate some IRS practices, the IRS established an AI Lab in the mid-eighties. More than two dozen staff went through two years of intensive training in applied AI at Bolt Beranek and Newman, MIT, Carnegie Mellon University, and the University of Pennsylvania. A number of expert systems have been the result. While some applications, for various reasons such as budget constraints and changing priorities, never made it to production, a number of expert systems are in full production (see the <a href=#sidebar>sidebar</a>), and others are under development.</p><p>Other applications have gone through something of a metamorphosis, such as the Taxpayer Service Expert Assistant system. The AI Lab designed TSEA as a help desk of sorts to aid IRS staff in answering taxpayers' questions when they called in for advice. Although this system was a technical success, it never went into production because it would have been too costly. The lab, however, is rolling the expert system into an on-line Tax Self-Help System that is under development. The idea is that the self-help system will make such advice directly accessible to taxpayers over the Internet--an attractive option in this era of Congressional budget cutting.</p><p>Another application that was built in the late eighties has almost worked itself out of a job. Intended to examine employee pension plans for compliance with federal regulations, the Revaluator system was installed nationwide at the IRS. Revaluator helps IRS staff perform knowledgeable audits. Because most IRS staff handling such audits are trained as accountants--not auditors or actuaries--they are not as well prepared to identify questionable practices as is an actuary. Before Revaluator appeared, a number of firms took advantage of this. Once word got out that the IRS had an automated "expert actuary in a can," these firms shaped up and started playing by the numbers, so to speak. Revaluator is still running, and in 1991 the IRS estimated that between 1991 and 2001 the system would save the IRS $350 million. Revaluator shows what can happen when people know they're being watched--the problem goes away.</p><p>Some applications have fallen victim to Washington's budget cuts, like an expert classification system that flags returns to audit. Developed in the late eighties, it reviews individual tax returns to determine the type of audit needed and specific issues to audit. Although this system promises to consistently identify questionable returns and reduce staff time, it is currently in limbo. When more returns are filed electronically, such an automatic review process might well earn its keep at the leaner IRS.</p><p><b>The AI Lab reorganizes</b></p><p>About a year ago the AI Lab reorganized and split into two groups: Lab I and Lab II. Lab I is largely an applications development group, using expert systems technology. It is also working with emerging AI technologies such as machine learning and natural language. The group has 12 staff members: nine AI specialists, two general computer specialists, and the head of the Lab.</p><p>Lab II has more of an R&amp;D flavor. It has 10 staff members, split 50-50 between AI specialists and general technologists. While some of Lab II's work is AI, the group is also working on some non-AI projects such as electronic-signature and voice-signature technology to facilitate the electronic filing of tax returns.</p><p><b>Fraud detective under development</b></p><p>One sensitive area that Lab II is working in is the detection of fraudulent returns. The Electronic Fraud Detection System is an expert system that uses machine learning and rule-based reasoning to identify fraudulent returns that are claiming tax refunds. The lab is developing this application with the criminal-investigation arm of the US Treasury. EFDS reasons about and looks for fraud and patterns of fraud, using information from a variety of sources. Evaluation of the system, which has been under development and testing since 1993, is scheduled for completion later this year.</p><p>EFDS sounds akin to FinCEN, another US Treasury application, which detects potential money laundering by digging through a variety of information sources.<a href=#ref2>[2]</a></p><p><b>IRS going on line</b></p><p>With the growing push to get on the National Information Infrastructure/Web/Internet, the IRS intends to give taxpayers direct electronic access to help desks from IRS offices and libraries, and eventually from home. Natural language could be an important enabler of this self-help system. "Language technologies will be more critical to the next level in delivering and receiving (information) directly to and from taxpayers," says Karen Freeman, Chief of AI Lab I.</p><p>Along with this is the IRS's push to have taxpayers submit all tax forms electronically. Currently only 10 to 15% are electronic. The IRS commissioner recently told the US Congress he hopes to have 80 million electronically filed returns by the year 2001--40% of the returns the IRS processes annually. "Electronic filing is one of the crucial links to make AI work for the Service," notes Gary Morris, Chief of AI Lab II.</p><p>Given the good track record AI systems already have at the IRS, AI will likely continue to play a role in cutting costs, efficiently helping taxpayers, and automatically checking returns for compliance.</p><p><b>TaxCut: expert assistant for taxpayers</b></p><p>Fortunately for us mere mortal taxpayers, AI is also helping us comply with the tax code. A decade ago, Dan Caine, then a lawyer with a large firm, had an idea for new tax software. "The goal was to enable people who knew nothing about taxes to be able to sit down with the program," explains Caine, "and emerge a few hours later with a correct, complete, and deducted-to-the-hilt tax return." To accomplish this, he set out to develop a tax program with an expert system interface of interviews that function much as an accountant does when collecting information from a client.</p><p>To bone up on expert systems, Caine went to MIT. "I went to the AI library at MIT and looked up the first papers by Patrick Winston, Randall Davis, and others, which talked about expert system algorithms," he says. "This was before expert systems were explained in textbooks."</p><p>Then, he sat down at his computer and wrote AskDan in Pascal. The program first appeared on the market in 1988, and has proven so successful that H&amp;R Block bought it in 1993. Now called Kiplinger TaxCut, hundreds of thousands of copies are sold each year, making it one of the most widely distributed expert systems in the world. Yet, as with most AI programs, users don't know there's an expert system in there. What they know is that TaxCut facilely guides them through their tax preparation.</p><p>"TaxCut has probably saved people millions of hours by now," says Caine proudly, "hours that people can spend working, or being with their families, or whatever. And it has reduced stress levels in hundreds of thousands of households throughout the country. And the technique I introduced has now been imitated by all the leading tax programs. So I feel as if I have contributed to all the free hours that all those customers are enjoying as well." Caine is looking toward free hours himself soon, because this will be his last season leading the TaxCut development team and working for H&amp;R Block. "It's been a good run," he says. Now he'll sit back for a while and look at his options. Meanwhile, hundreds of thousands of taxpayers will be having a t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te with TaxCut as they race toward that April 15th filing date.</p><p><b>Top rating</b></p><p>Recently, <i>Business Week</i> had a certified public accountant test the leading tax packages such as TaxCut, TurboTax, and MacInTax. He subjected them to a highly complex hypothetical tax return that <i>Business Week</i> described as the "return from hell." Although he determined that such programs are not really appropriate for high-income households with extensive deductions and lots of tax shelters, he concluded that "for the rest of us, the best program might be TaxCut, which allows you to complete your return using an interview format that's more intuitive and logically arranged that those of rivals." (That's the expert system at work making computers behave more intelligently--the raison d'&ecirc;tre of AI.)</p><p>While TaxCut has been extended and fleshed out since its first incarnation, the expert system is the one piece of code that has remained intact, according to Caine. TaxCut has grown considerably from about 15 tax forms with expert system interviews for only some of them, no overall interview to guide you, and no depreciation or other more complicated tax matters. Today there's a soup-to-nuts interview; over 100 forms, schedules, and worksheets; and a host of other features. Whereas the original version sold for $89.95, it now costs $19.95, with add-ons for electronic filing and 23 state returns.</p><p>"TaxCut helps people feel comfortable that they have not missed anything. For many people (myself included)," says Caine, "it makes tax preparation a lot faster than doing it by hand. It makes it much easier to change things in one's tax return as one discovers new receipts, or learns that something else is deductible. And it empowers people. Surprising numbers of people use TaxCut just to understand the process and to feel comfortable with what their accountant hands back to them."</p><p>"I do feel that I have made some small contribution to society," concludes Caine. Indeed, AI will be helping taxpayers get their taxes done more quickly this spring so that they can get outside to enjoy the warming days of April--while the IRS processes all those returns.</p><p><b>References</b></p><ol><li><a name=ref1></a>D.

The IRS estimates that about $2 billion in revenue is lost annually through misclassification of workers. This expert system can tell whether someone is truly self-employed or working as an employee of a company. It then generates a letter informing both the worker and the firm of the worker's status. This application won an Innovative Applications of Artificial Intelligence award in 1994.<a href=#sbref1>[1]</a> At that time, the IRS estimated that Determiner would save $1 million annually, and anticipated increased revenues of $22 million annually. The system is used nationwide, running in two centralized IRS processing centers. It has been completely weaned from the AI Lab, and is maintained by a field office in Vermont.</li><li><i>Magnetic Media Waivers Expert System</i> (Maggie). Since 1986, some larger businesses are required to file their tax return information (for example, dividends and interest paid) on magnetic media. Waivers may be granted based on various criteria such as hardship. This expert system processes waivers, applying consistent guidelines to a heretofore manual process. Maggie enables lower-graded IRS employees to enter the information, which the system then automatically processes. It has been in full production nationwide since 1989, running at a master computer site. Although the IRS won't go on record with exact savings, it has made clear that the system does reduce staffing costs, and improve consistency and accuracy of waiver processing.</li><li><i>Reasonable Cause Assistant</i> (RCA). Sometimes when taxpayers have not filed their tax returns on time, they request that no penalty be applied. The IRS must determine whether that request has a reasonable cause that warrants waiving the penalty fees. This area can be highly subjective, and different IRS personnel perceive reasonable cause differently, resulting in inconsistent determinations. RCA has automated this paper-intensive manual process, with consistent and accurate determinations. This expert system is being rolled out over the next year or so.</li><li><i>Correspondence generators</i>. Each year the IRS sends out some 15 million letters to taxpayers through the Correspondex Expert System. CES helps IRS staff compose letters. It generates large chunks of these letters automatically, drawing on a knowledge base to guide users in selecting paragraphs and enclosures. It also has expert spell checking, word editing, and on-line assistance for users. The system now runs on some 8,000 PCs across the US, eliminating approximately 60% of previous errors, saving billions of keystrokes, and saving an estimated $160 million over the application's ten-year life cycle. Another such system, the Letter Generation Module, automatically generates a letter--in English or Spanish--from a given set of facts. "These automatically generated letters address specific concerns of the taxpayer," explains Karen Freeman, AI Lab Chief. "They're not canned." In fact, the RCA application (see above) passes the facts to this module for the correspondence. This module is generic enough that in the future it may be applied to other areas within the IRS.</li></ul><b>Reference</b><ol><li><a name=sbref1></a>C. Wagner and G.

I give particular attention to the impact of such systems on issues such as privacy and electronic commerce.</p><p><b>Agents that directly assist Web browsing: tour guides</b></p><p>Some intelligent agents directly facilitate browsing by offering the user a tour guide for the Internet. These systems function while the user browses. Two of the better-known systems are WebWatcher and Letizia (see sidebar "<a href=#Websites>Web sites</a>").</p><p>WebWatcher offers several capabilities beyond browsing, including finding pages related to the current page, adding hyperlinks to the starting page to meet user search goals, and giving advice on the basis of user preferences.</p><p>With Letizia, the user browses via, for example, Netscape, while the agent collects information about the user's behavior and tries to anticipate additional items that might interest that user. By incorporating this data and various heuristics, the system infers a user's interests and then feeds information back to that user.</p><p>Browsers that assist browsing provide increased access to different parts of the Web. However, these tour guides will not necessarily be free from bias. For example, a browsing assistant might guide the user to the pages that its developer or sponsor wants users to see, whether those pages directly or indirectly meet that user's needs or interest profile. In addition, tour-guide browsers can influence privacy. Theoretically, the agent could capture records of browsing activity and periodically report back to some server regarding that activity. Knowledge discovery could then be used to investigate the large databases of individual or groups of users' behavior for trends.</p><p><b>Agents find products or information on the WWW</b></p><p>Several intelligent systems can find information or products on the WWW. Typically, an agent depends on the users providing information either directly or indirectly through their choices, so that it can learn about their interests. Four of the more well-known systems include</p><ul><li><i>Firefly</i>. This system helps users find music that they are likely to enjoy. Firefly uses information gathered from others, similar to the users in tastes and opinions, to suggest new music.</li><li><i>Webdoggie</i>. This agent attempts to mitigate the impact of information overload. Either on-demand or periodically, the system recommends WWW documents based on user-expressed preferences (for example, interesting, boring, and so on).</li><li><i>NewsWeeder II</i>. This Mosaic-based net-news reader learns a user's reading interests and then uses machine learning to find new Web pages and news articles.</li><li><i>Bargain Finder</i>. This system helps the user find the lowest price for a CD.</li></ul><p>The WWW is enormous and is becoming larger all the time. Without agents, it could easily become intractable. Accordingly, information and product-finding agents can facilitate and improve Web use.</p><p>Information from product-finding agents isn't necessarily free from presentation bias. Such agents might have sponsors whose information sources or products are among the first provided to the user. In the airline industry in the seventies and eighties, several reservation systems had so-called screen bias. Requests for information favored the system sponsors and developers at the expense of other suppliers by providing developer information first, at the top of the list of available flights. Many travel agents used the first or second items a large percentage of the time, thus leading to a bias in favor of those developers.</p><p>Furthermore, such agents might structure the presentation of information in other biasing ways. For example, suppose an agent provided information on where to purchase different products. Depending on the physical location of the agent's sponsor and the sponsor's competition, there are incentives to present location data at different levels of aggregation (a single zip code or a range of zip codes) on the basis of which is more likely to lead the user to the sponsor. Users might assume that a travel agent represented a relatively comprehensive list of sources. Instead, unbeknownst to those users, the agent might direct them to only a subset of available sources.</p><p>Finally, the information found might not be legitimate. Recently, there was a scam on the Internet where airline tickets were sold for an unbelievably low price. As it turns out, the product source was apparently a fraud. The buyers paid their money, but received no ticket.</p><p>Agents that search the Web for the lowest-priced version of some relatively homogeneous products are likely to significantly impact the long-term price for such products. Widespread availability of information lets agents easily compare the price of comparable items. Furthermore, making price information available and assuming that the product is the same effectively turns that product into a commodity. If all that appears to differentiate products is price, then prices will likely fall as information about availability increases. Similarly, intelligent agents can influence the value of knowledge. Freely available knowledge that agents can readily search can become a commodity.</p><p><b>Frequently asked questions</b></p><p>FAQ files are compendiums of the semi-structured wisdom of news groups on topics of frequent interest. FAQs are found at home pages of centers of knowledge about particular issues, and thus are dispersed around the world.</p><p>FAQFinder, a meta-FAQ, is an automated question-answering system that uses files of FAQs.<a href=#ref3>[3]</a> The system takes a query from a user and tries to find the FAQ file that would most likely provide an answer. Then the system searches that file for similar questions and provides the answers given by the FAQ source.</p><p>FAQFinder faces an extremely difficult and dynamic environment, complicating development of such systems. First, FAQs can change considerably over time. Those regarding personal computer suitability have probably changed substantially over the last few years. As a result, there are likely to be important issues of maintenance. Second, there can be multiple FAQs for roughly the same domains. Accordingly, developers must try to choose the most correct and least biased ones. Furthermore, multiple camps might represent different knowledge sources with different answers to the same questions-for example, questions answered from the political right and left are likely to be quite different. Third, new FAQ groups emerge on the Internet everyday. Finding and adding them can be a difficult task, particularly in light of the potential for overlap with existing FAQ groups.</p><p><b>Search engines and metasearch engines</b></p><p>WWW robots, wanderers, and spiders are all names for programs that traverse the Web automatically. They can perform many functions on the WWW, such as doing information retrieval and discovery, staying within a directory and sleeping between requests, validating links or HTML, and generating statistics. A list of agent robot systems include Lycos, InfoSeek, World Wide Web Worm, Web Crawler, and Wandex (World Wide Web Wanderer).</p><p>Metasearch engines use more than one source of information for their search. For example, they might use some of the search engines mentioned above. Metasearch engines include Find-it, All-in-One, Savvy Search, LinkSearch, Configurable Unified Search Interface (CUSI), IS Workgroup, and Spider. Different search engines use different rating systems to compare the request to the source that was found. Hence, metasearch engines must integrate the findings of multiple search engines. This can be a difficult task, because different search engines use different schemes to rank the closeness of the source to the request.</p><p>Search engines can manipulate what the user sees, on the basis of queries. The extent to which queries and advertisements are linked varies per search engine. Some search engines link the content of user queries and advertisements to the user. For example, a search I conducted recently for Singapore Airlines brought up an advertisement from Cathay Pacific, a direct competitor. Another search for Intranet brought up an advertisement for Netscape's Intranet Server Solutions. Moreover, search engines potentially could bias responses to some queries in favor of certain sponsors or developers, by either limiting the search or by biasing the ranking process.</p><p>Most users navigating on the Internet heavily use both search and metasearch agents. Because they form the basis of network searches, such agents generate important data regarding user interests. Search data can be used to determine which topics need to be added or updated, so that agents can search for specific types of information. Queries for which there are no good answers provide a basis for system updates.</p><p><b>Intranet and Internet</b></p><p>Increasingly, WWW Internet technology is being used for intra-organizational communication and workgroups. In addition, specific Intranet software, such as Lotus Notes, can facilitate communication and data sharing between workgroups. A journal and a FAQ about the Intranet are also available.</p><p>Internet technology has improved productivity. Globenet, developed by IBM (presented at the symposium by Benjamin Grosof and Davis Foulger), does knowledge-based retrieval and handling of heterogeneous databases. Rule-based agents provide control for information retrieval.</p><p>Globenet reasons about both structured and unstructured aspects of qualitative databases-in particular, network news-group filtering. Globenet is currently deployed in a customer-service support application within IBM, assisting the staff with customer questions and problems. Early tests with the system suggest that productivity can be improved by more than 30%.</p><p><b>Intelligent browsing of qualitative databases</b></p><p>Although most of the focus of browsing has been on the WWW, there is interest in browsing qualitative databases such as those developed in Lotus Notes. This has been of particular interest for the major consulting firms, such as Andersen Consulting and Price Waterhouse, which have been among the first users of Lotus Notes.</p><p>For example, Andersen Consulting Education has developed an approach similar to Richard Osgood's ASK system. Osgood's system facilitates search (of video or text databases) by employing two types of user interfaces: zooming interfaces that provide the content to the user, and a browsing interface that facilitates exploration. To help the user find helpful content, Osgood and Cynthia Bernstein (at the symposium) cited the need for a zooming feature that anticipates what content will be useful, when it will be needed, and how it must be explained. To facilitate browsing, the system provides elaboration, explanations, comparisons, or other advice. Osgood and Bernstein have also developed an indexing process that creates and maintains the zooming and browsing relationships.</p><p>Bruce Krulwich and Chad Burkey's ContactFinder is designed to replace the "good ole boy network" with the "good-old-bot [robot] network." Although groupware such as the Internet and Lotus Notes let users answer questions and share data, such groupware products are limited by the amount of time that people can spend reviewing questions. ContactFinder has been running on an Andersen Consulting worldwide bulletin board. To date, it has read more than 5,000 messages, given referrals to more than 10% of the questions it has seen, and been accurate about 86% of the time.</p><p>Query Planning Environment Assistant, developed by Scott Huffman and David Steier of Price Waterhouse, helps information-retrieval specialists such as librarians select and combine heterogeneous data sources to produce new information services. In particular, QPEA provides decision support for planning a search, including the choice of databases.</p><p><b>Browsing large documents</b></p><p>Intranet applications might include browsing one large database made available on the company's Intranet. Marti Hearst, David Karger, and Jan Pedersen discussed a system called Scatter/Gather that clusters data into semantically similar groups and then presents findings to the user. Scatter/Gather can identify interesting data subsets or can select subsets for further analysis.</p><p><b>Corporate browsing</b></p><p>Knowledge navigation is not limited to individuals or even groups. Corporate interaction also requires knowledge navigation. Currently, the US business community makes heavy use of electronic data interchange over value-added networks. However, this could change in the future, as corporations take advantage of cost savings available through the Internet.</p><p>Agents might be responsible for finding suppliers (or guiding users to them), soliciting bids for products (or finding those to bid), and several other agent demand or retrieval functions.<a href=#ref4>[4]</a> Similarly, information supply agents might be responsible for engaging demand agents to provide information to discover resources for inclusion in virtual organizations.</p><p><b>Monitoring</b></p><p>Ultimately, perhaps the biggest impact of agents comes from their ability to monitor heterogeneous databases, such as those on the WWW. Anything that goes on a Web site can rapidly be discovered. Furthermore, any browsing on the WWW can provide information to Web sites about user interests.</p><p>Agents can monitor Web site changes, and Web sites can use agents to monitor users in order to create profiles of user interests. First Floor has developed some tools that allow the generation of agents designed to find Web site changes, facilitating various tasks such as gathering news and industry analyses.</p><p>Furthermore, some browsers provide Web sites with the ability to monitor users. For example, Web sites can track users by using the IP address or other approaches. Probably the best known is Netscape's Navigator feature, which provides Web sites user-activity information. An agent captures information in a file that is kept on the user's system (for example, "cookies.txt"), so that the site can track what a user does at that site and how long the user is there. Since the cookies file can be deleted, such a file gives the user a certain amount of control.</p><p>Perhaps some of the most "interesting" future developments (greatest threats to privacy or greatest value creations, depending on your perspective) will come when multiple sites pool their data to generate knowledge about users. Such a pooling of data will facilitate an understanding of correlated search: When users go to one site, are they likely to visit another? If so, which other sites? And so on. It will also permit sites to work together in their pursuit of visitors and their analysis of determining what works and what doesn't.</p><p><b>Acknowledgments</b></p><p>I haven't provided any references to papers in the Fall Symposium on AI Applications in Knowledge Navigation and Retrieval because the cover of the symposium notes says "Do Not Cite Papers."

<ul><h2>AI in Steelmaking- Scheduling High-Grade Steelmaking </h2>
<P><B>J&uuml;rgen Dorn and Reza Shams, Christian Doppler Laboratory
for Expert Systems</B>
<P>
<I>This expert system for scheduling high-grade steel production cuts engineering planning time, allows for greater what-if experimentation, and improves quality control. The complexity of production-cycle scheduling problems had defeated earlier, purely conventional software approaches.</I>
<P>
High-grade steelmaking plants produce a great variety of specialized
grades of steel for use in the aircraft industry and other exacting
applications. Lot sizes in such plants are typically small, and
the chemical composition of each lot, or <I>heat</I>, is critical.
Chemical infiltration in the plant's electric arc furnace between
consecutive heats, for instance, can ruin an entire lot, making
production-cycle scheduling quite tricky.
<P>
Austria's B&ouml;hler Uddeholm, a leading European producer of
high-grade steel, had earlier attempted to solve its scheduling
problems with conventional software approaches. Finding a schedule,
however, that observes all compatibility constraints between production
runs can theoretically be an NP-hard problem. (Because sequences
cannot be excluded a priori, schedulers would need to examine
each permutation in a sequence of jobs. For 10 jobs, that would
mean 3,628,800 comparisons. But B&ouml;hler has over 30 jobs to
be scheduled.) These earlier attempts failed because they sometimes
simply left difficult-to-schedule jobs unscheduled. (See the <a href="sched.htm">sidebar</a>
for a description of scheduling basics.)
<P>
In a joint project between the Alcatel Austria-ELIN Research Center
(AERC) and the Christian Doppler Laboratory for Expert Systems,
we developed an expert system that solves these scheduling problems
by first determining the criticality of jobs and then applying
a heuristic, or rule, based on the criticality values to guide
the search for a feasible schedule. The system also provides local
control of the use and relaxation of constraints, enabling engineers
to make on-the-spot adjustments.
<P>
Implemented in Pamela, a rule-based language developed by AERC,
this system supports the steelmaking shop's technical staff in
generating weekly steel heat schedules. It has operated successfully
at B&ouml;hler's Kapfenberg plant since 1992, freeing engineers
for their regular production supervision duties.
<P>
<B>The problem</B>
<P>
High-grade steel is crude steel refined with alloying metals such
as manganese, tungsten, or chromium. These alloying metals have
many desirable effects, including compression strength and impact
strength. Because B&ouml;hler's customers use its steel to build
aircraft parts, turbine blades in power plants, and other high-tech
equipment, they demand high quality and need relatively small
amounts of steel goods.
<P>
A production-planning system matches orders to jobs and chooses
required process plans. This system determines which weeks to
process these jobs, according to the shop's capacity. For each
week, it works out two sets of jobs to be processed on two production
lines. (The steelmaking plant's first shift customarily starts
Sunday night, and the last shift ends Saturday. Sometimes, the
scheduler will fix sequences for two or three jobs to facilitate
scheduling in subsequent plants. Read <a href="sched.htm">Scheduling basics</a> for more information.)
<P>
The scheduler must find a possible sequence for all jobs that
violates as few compatibility constraints between jobs as possible,
and must allocate resources over time without violating temporal
and capacity constraints. This scheduling process may mean that
some orders are rejected and shifted to the next week. To reduce
the number of rejected orders, the production-planning system
establishes general rules that explain what combinations of orders
can be produced in a single week.
<P>
The steelmaking plant produces slabs or ingots of a specific quality
for different subsequent plants such as the forge, the rolling
mill, or the foundry. The destination is important for the scheduling
process, because the production plan must consider the working
hours of these plants. Sometimes, because the next plant cannot
process the jobs in the same sequence as the steelmaking plant,
products must sit for several days in intermediate stockyards.
Because the stored steel cools down, it must be warmed up again
in the next plant, adding extra costs. To reduce costs and improve
quality, some orders have due dates, which further complicates
scheduling.
<P>
<B>The steelmaking process. </B>Pig iron produced in blast furnaces
usually contains more than 4% carbon, making it brittle. To get
a deformable product, the carbon in pig iron must be reduced to
0.2%. Many high-tech products demand even higher-quality steel,
so the percentages of various chemical elements still in the steel
must be further reduced. If the Kapfenberg plant could deliver
the steel immediately from the blast furnace, this reduction process
could occur in LD converters (named for Linz and Donauwitz, Austria).
Because the plant has no blast furnace, they melt the crude steel
and scrap iron in electric arc furnaces (EAFs), reducing costs
by using scrap iron with high percentages of desirable alloying
elements.
<P>
The steelmaking shop in Kapfenberg has three production lines
that share some aggregates (machines or units). Each steel quality
has a process plan that describes which operations to perform
on which aggregates to produce the specified quality. Schedulers
need only replan these operations and sequences when failures
occur.
<P>
The steelmaking process begins with the charge of crude steel
and scrap iron in one of the three EAFs. The filling of one furnace
(a heat) already contains the main alloying elements. Furnace
capacities range from 17 to 55 metric tons. The time to melt one
heat depends on its size and ingredients as well as external factors
(such as the availability of power in the small city of Kapfenberg).
Because the furnaces consume considerable electric energy, plant
managers sometimes switch them off during voltage peaks. A melt
can take up to five hours, but two to two-and-a -half hours usually
suffice. This interval includes a fixed setup time and a 20-minute
maintenance interval.
<P>
The liquid steel is poured into ladles that a crane transports
to a <I>ladle furnace </I>(LF). If the preceding heat has a long
processing time in the LF, the current heat must wait. The slack
time between operations must not exceed two hours. The next step
is a heat treatment in the ladle furnace where the fine alloying
occurs. Its duration is usually about the same as melting. Later,
the process might include a special treatment in the <I>vacuum
oxygen decarburation </I>(VOD) unit or <I>vacuum decarburation
</I>(VD) unit. A three- to four-hour changeover process can convert
the VD unit to a VOD unit.
<P>
The last step is the processing of the steel in a <I>horizontal
continuous caster </I>(HCC) to form slabs or its casting into
molds to form ingots. The <I>teeming rate, </I>or speed<I>, </I>for
the HCC is about 50 tons per hour. If the casting format must
change, the scheduler needs to include setup time as well. Casting
ingots requires space in one of the four <I>teeming bays </I>(TB),
where ingots can solidify in the molds. Normally, the solidification
time for ingots in hours is half as much as their weight in tons:
a 52-ton ingot needs one day and a 1-ton ingot needs half an hour.
<P>
For large ingots, B&ouml;hler uses a special casting technique
called <I>B&ouml;hler-Electro-Slag-Topping</I>. There is only
one place in the teeming bays (TB1) for these large ingots after
they pass through the BEST unit. Also, the ESU (<I>Elektro Sonderumformung</I>)
unit handles certain extra-clean steel qualities. Figure 1 shows
all aggregates and heat routings. (Because the plant rarely uses
the third production line with the EAF5 and ESU units, we will
not regard it further.)

<P>
<B>Scheduling constraints.</B> Constraints involved in the construction
of steelmaking shop schedules are often vague and can conflict.
Given the uncertainty involved in the shop floor execution of
any plan, steel shop engineers cannot hope to generate optimal
schedules. They can decide that some schedules are better than
others.
<P>
<I>Compatibility constraints. </I>The main scheduling problem
is that residuals of one heat may pollute the next. As a rule
of thumb, engineers figure that 3% of a chemical element in a
heat will remain in the wall of the EAF, and the second heat will
assimilate 3% of the difference of the elements in two consecutive
heats. The 3% rule of thumb is always on the safe side, and the
expert sometimes relaxes this factor. A sample rule might be as
follows:
<blockquote>
<I>Assume heat </I>h<I><sub>1</sub> contains 20% nickel and heat </I>h<I><sub>2</sub>,
which is processed afterward in the furnace, should have 4% nickel.
The second heat will take approximately</I>
<P>
<I>(20% - 4%)/3% = 0.48% nickel from the wall.</I>
<P>
<I>When scrap iron is inserted in the furnace, only 3.52% of the
nickel is taken. If the second heat might contain only 0.25% nickel,
this sequence of heats is not allowed.</I></blockquote>
<P>
Although the rule is effective for 42 chemical elements, schedulers
usually only consider eight: nickel (Ni), chromium (Cr), manganese
(Mn), molybdenum (Mo), tungsten (W), cobalt (Co), vanadium (V),
and iron (Fe). Amounts of the other 34 are usually very small,
and their restrictions present no scheduling problems. Because
elements do not all react uniformly, exceptions arise that require
separate handling. Because of the diversity of qualities, these
compatibility constraints often cannot be met, and some heats
are destroyed. Steelmakers melt these again and reuse them for
other, less-critical orders. 
<P>
Although these compatibility criteria hold for every unit in the
production process, including ladles, as a rule schedulers usually
only observe EAF constraints. The ladles present no great problem
because the plant uses 12 of them in turn. Conversely, chemical
constraints are even more stringent on the caster, but this presents
no practical problem because B&ouml;hler uses the caster for so
few heats.
<P>
Besides avoiding such destruction because of infiltration, we
do not want to waste expensive rare elements. If one job demands
a high percentage of an expensive element such as cobalt, the
next job should use as much of this residual as possible.
<P>
<I>Temporal constraints. </I>In principle, the plant can store
the cast steel in intermediate stockyards before treating it further
in one of the subsequent plants. However, the steel then needs
reheating, at considerable cost, and some qualities should not
cool down at all. Consequently, managers make appointments between
the steel shop and subsequent plants that must hold to within
a tolerance of &#177;2 hours. On average, about 10% of the jobs
have such due dates. These constraints are not truly hard, because
they may be relaxed through negotiations with the subsequent plant.
Nevertheless, managers want to hold these due dates to reduce
the time needed for negotiations. The subsequent plants must also
consider different compatibility constraints from those of the
steel shop. For some jobs, managers make no appointments to prevent
inconsistencies, even though subsequent treatment of these jobs
should occur immediately after casting. They try not to schedule
these jobs at the end of the week, when subsequent plants do not
operate.
<P>
The plant should perform some jobs with difficult treatments during
the day shift, so that an engineer can supervise. Usually, treatment
times in the steps following the EAF are shorter than the melting
time, but for very high qualities the duration in the ladle furnace
is longer. The waiting intervals between operations must not exceed
a certain limit. The goal is to keep these intervals as small
as possible, which minimizes job-flow time and reduces production
costs. However, this objective is only secondary, because the
main goal is always to have as few destroyed heats as possible.
Because this primary objective cannot always be achieved, schedulers
rarely regard the secondary goal.
<P>
<I>Capacity and related constraints.</I> The plant casts about
70% of jobs into ingots and processes the remaining 30% on the
continuous caster. For both casting technologies, these capacity
constraints apply:
<UL>
<LI>Both production lines can supply steel to the continuous caster.
If two subsequent heats should both be cast on the continuous
caster and have almost the same steel quality, the caster should
process both jobs without interruption. Late-arriving steel will
entail an expensive setup process. Continuously cast jobs, or
<I>serial castings</I>, are possible only if the steel comes from
one production line. If both production lines require the caster,
planners must schedule these jobs so that they do not conflict.
<LI>Big <I>forging-grade ingots</I> (&gt;19 tons) and BEST ingots
have a limited dedicated storage place. If a 52-ton ingot is cast,
the ingot occupies the whole space during solidification. Because
such an ingot requires about one day for solidification, the plant
can produce only one per day.
<LI>Casting steel in ingots is very labor-intensive. Workers set
up the molds, use a casting crane to fill each mold, and strip
off the molds after solidification. When casting a heat in many
small ingots, the workload for the workers that set up and strip
off the molds is larger than for a few large ingots. The handling
of every mold takes approximately the same time no matter what
its size. In principle, because the cranes and manpower are available,
the plant could cast two heats from two production lines at the
same time. However, because we want to evenly distribute worker
workloads, schedules should avoid casting two heats simultaneously
that must be cast in small ingots.  Also, work should be equally
distributed between shifts.
<LI>If an order arrives for an amount of steel that does not make
a full heat, schedulers combine it with another of compatible
quality to form a <I>double</I> or <I>triple casting</I>. The
workers pour only a part of the heat from the arc furnace into
the refinement ladle, and the refinement and casting processes
are shorter.
</UL>

<P>
<B>Heuristics. </B>Steelmaking shop experts apply heuristics to
construct schedules. These serve to master the complexity of the
construction and control the uncertainties of the application.
If no schedule emerges from the initial attempt, the experts relax
some of the constraints, knowing that there will usually be enough
freedom during execution to correct the violated constraints.
Again, heuristics control this relaxation.
<P>
<I>Bottleneck resource.</I> Although in principle steelmaking
is a flow shop process, planners cannot schedule jobs on only
one resource. A promising approach for restricting the search
heuristically is to first sequence the operations on the bottleneck
resource and then check the constraints on the other resources.

<P>
In most steelmaking plants, this bottleneck is the continuous
caster, which is very sensitive to compatibility constraints and
must be delivered in time to cast without interruptions. In our
application, the plant casts most heats into ingots, which have
no compatibility constraints and whose temporal constraints are
not especially hard. Because the infiltration of heats by predecessors
is the most constraining issue, the scheduler plans a sequence
of heats in the EAFs. Schedules constructed by the experts do
not contain temporal slots for continuous casting although they
also regard the constraints on the caster.
<P>
<I>Alloying cycles. </I>The alloying cycle, an important concept
for the scheduling process, is a series of heats in which the
amount of a chemical element slowly decreases. For example, the
concentration of chromium could decrease over several heats from
26% to 10%. Although other constraints prevent steelmakers from
ordering all jobs in one alloying cycle, several alloying cycles
for one element can occur in sequence and several alloying cycles
for different elements can overlap in time. 
<P>
Figure 2 illustrates the alloying cycles for nickel and chromium
based on real data from 12 jobs. Heats should be scheduled in
the order indicated by the figure, remembering also that the quality
produced at the end of a week affects heats in the beginning of
the next week. The recognition of possible alloying cycles is
one important task driven by heuristics, one that engineering
experience in the plant supports: the amount of an element should
decrease slowly over a sequence of heats, but can increase very
quickly. The number of peaks in this saw-blade curve should also
stay at a minimum.
<P>
<a href=fig2.gif><img src=litfig2.gif width=150></a>
<P>
Figure 2. Overlapping alloying cycles.
<P>
<I>Scheduling BEST Ingots. </I>These ingots present several problems.
Typically, there are groups of such jobs, all having the same
chemical quality requirements. They are usually forging-grade
ingots, should be delivered hot to the forge, and are low-alloyed
(their amount of alloying metals is very low). For compatibility,
they should be produced in sequence. Unfortunately, they solidify
slowly and have only one slot available for them in the teeming
bay.
<P>
Because they are low-alloyed, the furnaces will probably be high-alloyed
in the interim. And because they should be delivered hot, they
cannot be scheduled before weekends or public holidays. (On weekends,
the furnaces are generally high-alloyed and produce many small
ingots.)
<P>
<I>Conflicts on the continuous caster. </I>The HCC unit is most
economical for continuously casting several heats with the same
quality and format. Whenever such groups of jobs arrive, planners
try to schedule them one after the other. However, all jobs of
this group must be in time for their casting. After the processing
of some jobs on the caster, planners must schedule a maintenance
interval and also must reserve a setup time lasting several hours
when converting formats. Given the very uncertain operational
durations of the steelmaking process, engineers prefer to charge
the caster only with heats from one furnace. However, they sometimes
change furnaces once per week. In this case, they decide when
this change should take place before scheduling single jobs. Furthermore,
they accept only one format conversion. Experts also schedule
this conversion beforehand. Later, they assign each job that requires
the HCC unit to one part of the week. Of course, schedulers cannot
apply all these heuristics in a fixed sequence, so finding good
points to switch between them is very important.
<P>
<B>The solution</B>
<P>
Two design decisions characterize our solution to these scheduling
problems. First, we have tried to model the way human experts
solve the problem. Humans do not consider any global evaluation
function but only local decisions about good practice. Further,
they use heuristics to construct a schedule, and they avoid backtracking.
Second, the knowledge on compatibility of consecutive heats and
temporal constraints is vague. For instance, although it is better
to have a small difference in elements between heats, in some
cases the difference can also be greater than 3%.
<P>
The expert system receives two lists of jobs for two production
lines from the production-planning system. Each list contains
about 35 jobs. The system needs between 5 and 10 minutes to generate
a solution for both production lines. Control information tells
the user what the system is doing, and the user can break the
search anytime. After a break or completion, the user can manually
change the schedule. The system then rechecks the schedule for
any constraint violations. The problem-solving process consists
of three phases:
<UL>
<LI>A preprocessing phase evaluates the difficulty of scheduling
individual jobs in the actual planning horizon.
<LI>A scheduling phase allocates jobs starting with the most difficult
one.
<LI>A postprocessing phase modifies the schedule to repair constraint
violations.
</UL>

<P>
<B>Evaluating jobs. </B>Each week, the system evaluates jobs to
determine any bottlenecks for the current week. For example, if
the schedule calls for casting many jobs on the continuous caster,
the caster is the bottleneck. The system then considers these
jobs as early as possible. If many big forging-grade ingots are
to be cast, these jobs are the most critical. If there are orders
for more than five big ingots, it will be impossible to schedule
them all in one week. If there are exactly five, the list is characterized
as having many big ingots.
<P>
We use symbolic variables like <tt>many</tt> and <tt>few</tt> so that the system
can easily adapt to modifications in the plant. For a scheduling
strategy it is important whether there are many big ingots, but
not how many there are. We use the data structure shown in Figure
3 to characterize individual jobs.
<pre>
JobList
    ContinousCasting         (too_many, many, normal, few, no)
    BigForgingGradeIngots    (too_many, many, normal, few, no)

    AlloyingCycles           (Enumeration of Elements)
</pre>
<P>
Figure 3. Data structure.
<P>
<I>Runaways</I> are jobs that demand one element in an unusual
amount. Finding a successor or a predecessor for these jobs can
be impossible. For example, orders sometimes come in for steel
with a large percentage of cobalt. If no other heats allow cobalt,
the plant must schedule an additional heat after the cobalt heat
for cleaning the furnace. Apart from this function, the heat will
be useless. Because the spatial constraints concerning the caster
and the teeming bay affect both production lines, schedulers cannot
evaluate one furnace's list independently of the other lists.
<P>
After characterizing a given set of jobs, planners assign a criticality
value to each job, which describes its relative difficulty. A
job whose allocation is strongly constrained gets a high criticality
value and will be scheduled early. (&quot;Early&quot; does not
mean that we schedule it early in the week, or even that we will
leave it in the schedule, but only that we decide early in the
planning process where to schedule it. The best place in the schedule
may be late.) We assign each job a <tt>very difficult</tt>, <tt>difficult</tt>,
<tt>normal</tt>, <tt>easy</tt>, or <tt>very easy</tt> attribute.
<P>
The compatibility of heats is critical for constructing successful
schedules. So, we construct a matrix of successor/predecessor
entries that shows how the chemical elements of two jobs fit together.
This matrix shows which jobs have many good predecessors and successors.
We classify jobs that can combine only with one other job as very
difficult to schedule. Thus we first schedule very difficult jobs
that would otherwise remain unscheduled, because no possible neighbor
remains. Figure 4 shows such a matrix for 12 jobs.
<P>
<a href=fig4.gif><img src=litfig4.gif></a>
<P>
Figure 4. The compatibility matrix. If we wanted to determine
the compatibility between heats <I>h<sub>i</sub></I> and <I>h<sub>j</sub></I>, we would
select row <I>i </I>and column <I>j </I>in this figure. A dark
color indicates good compatibility. From the small number of dark
fields in the row for heat <I>h</I><sub>7</sub>, we can conclude that it
may be difficult to schedule this heat because only a few good
successors exist for it. Also, heats <I>h</I><sub>4</sub> and <I>h</I><sub>5</sub>are
not particularly useful as successor heats.
<P>
The matrix shows that the compatibility relation is not symmetric.
It helps us decide whether two jobs <I>can</I> be scheduled after
each other and if two jobs <I>must</I> be scheduled after each
other. The expert system  distinguishes between jobs already scheduled
and those yet to be scheduled. The system modifies the matrix
dynamically so that it always reflects which potential successors
and predecessors still exist for a given job.
<P>
<B>Job scheduling. </B>Because the experts primarily regard heats
in the EAFs, the expert system also constructs a schedule for
the furnaces. Although scheduling is mainly a sequencing problem,
a pure list is not a sufficient representation for the schedule
because temporal constraints must be checked. Although the users
are not interested in exact time points, the system must not violate
simple temporal constraints. Thus the system represents a schedule
as a list of temporal intervals with predefined length. In general,
schedules allocate the furnaces in a cycle of 3, 3, and 4 hours.
This is a general assumption that will be refined later if the
heats are allocated.
<P>
If we have a job with a due date, we first compute its most likely
flow time to get its optimal start time.
<P>
Criticality values drive the scheduling of jobs. We schedule very
difficult jobs first, but which jobs are the most difficult depends
on all the jobs to be scheduled. Typically, these are jobs that
have a due date and must be cast on the continuous caster, or
heats that have a difficult chemical analysis and are to be cast
into BEST ingots. However, there is no order between the difficult
orders, and we select them randomly.
<P>
We also consider the difficulty of finding a job for a particular
interval. When the system has scheduled some of the jobs, it may
become important to fill the neighboring intervals with compatible
heats. Small gaps between two scheduled jobs are usually most
critical, because the heat that will be scheduled must fit to
both neighbors. If gaps appear, we must change the scheduling
strategy and look for a job to insert into the gap. We must do
the same thing when we have only one possible successor or predecessor.
Finally, we schedule easy jobs in accordance with the alloying
cycles.
<P>
The difficulty of jobs can change during the scheduling phase.
A job that was at first easy to schedule because it had many possible
successors can become difficult because only one successor remains.
<P>
<I>Reasoning with necessary sequences.</I> As mentioned earlier,
a sequencing problem becomes tractable if we can enforce some
sequences. The order list already contains double castings, or
predefined sequences that must be processed in this sequence.
The production-planning system has not yet determined serial castings
on the continuous caster, so one of the first tasks of the expert
system is to decide whether serial castings are available.
<P>
Furthermore, we can constrain the heat <I>h<sub>i</sub></I> to be an immediate
predecessor of some heat <I>h<sub>j</sub></I> if <I>h<sub>i</sub></I> is the only allowed
predecessor of <I>h<sub>j</sub></I> or if <I>h<sub>j</sub></I> is the only allowed successor
of <I>h<sub>i</sub></I>. So, if we can schedule heat <I>h<sub>i</sub></I>, heat <I>h<sub>j</sub></I>
will be scheduled, too. If <I>h<sub>i</sub></I> is not yet scheduled and
<I>h<sub>j</sub></I> is scheduled, then <I>h<sub>i</sub></I> must be automatically scheduled
as well. Moreover, if heat <I>h<sub>k</sub></I> has only two possible successors,
<I>h<sub>j</sub></I> and <I>h<sub>l</sub></I>, <I>h<sub>l</sub></I> can be associated to <I>h<sub>k</sub></I>
because <I>h<sub>j</sub></I> is already given away.
<P>
Usually, there is more than one possible successor, as the matrix
in Figure 4 shows. Typically, one job is highly compatible and
one is slightly worse. We choose heuristically the better one
if no other constraints advise the second.
<P>
These inferences occur during the main scheduling phase. If the
system schedules heat <I>h<sub>i</sub></I> according to some heuristic, it
refreshes the matrix accordingly. If the scheduled heat is now
the successor of heat <I>h<sub>j</sub></I>, the matrix now shows that <I>h<sub>i</sub></I>
can no longer succeed another heat. Perhaps, then, a third heat
<I>h<sub>k</sub></I> that had two possible successors, <I>h<sub>i</sub></I> and <I>h<sub>l</sub></I>,
now has only one possible successor, <I>h<sub>l</sub></I>.
<P>
This kind of inference occurs concurrently with other inferences.
Because no fixed deterministic course of inferences can be specified
for this scheduling problem, a solution with a procedural approach
seems to be difficult. However, a rule-based system easily solves
the problem.
<P>
<I>Relaxing constraints and repairing constraint violations. </I>The
system must check several constraints anytime a new job is introduced
into the schedule. For example, if the plant must produce five
big forging-grade ingots, the system must schedule these jobs
early to distribute them over the whole week at intervals that
will allow their solidification in the teeming bay. There may
be other jobs already scheduled, so compatibility constraints
must be checked too.
<P>
The expert system tries to schedule jobs to satisfy constraints
as well as possible. For compatibility constraints it tries to
find neighbors that fit with very high or high compatibility.
If one heat has only one successor with a high compatibility,
the system takes this heat. However, if no high compatibility
is available, the expert system relaxes the constraint and accepts
a medium compatibility. Further relaxation requires an acknowledgment
from the human expert. If the expert system does not find a medium
compatibility, it looks for a heat that has only low compatibility.
Then it asks the expert whether this sequence may be scheduled.
If the expert denies the sequence, the job cannot be scheduled.
The relaxation of temporal constraints proceeds similarly.
<P>
Sometimes, the expert system allocates a job at a poor interval.
When distributing five large ingots over the whole schedule, only
the distance between ingots-not their order-is important. However,
because these jobs are difficult, the schedule will fix their
order early. Later, it can perhaps improve the schedule by exchanging
two of these jobs. Thus, after having scheduled all jobs, the
expert system examines whether unscheduled jobs can be scheduled
by first exchanging other jobs in the schedule. It also examines
constraint violations and again tries to get rid of them by exchanging
jobs.
<P>
<B>Implementation. </B>We implemented our expert system with Pamela,
a rule-based forward-chaining expert system language especially
suited for building real-time applications.
<P>
Because Pamela code is precompiled to pure C code, the expert
system can execute on all machines that support C. Pamela code
can also combine with C, which facilitates the interface to the
external environment and integration with procedural components.
For example, we used a C program for evaluating jobs, a process
that is basically counting. It was also easy to integrate the
expert system in the existing environment consisting of a production-planning
system and a real-time control system.
<P>
Pamela's ability to handle interrupts lets users interrupt the
planning at any time to look at the schedule in progress. They
can also propose a time for a job, and the system will respond
whether such a time is possible and which constraints will be
violated. Although Pamela is forward-chaining, users can freeze
a state of the expert system and return to this state later if
the expert system or the user recognizes that the chosen solution
path is unfavorable. Users thus can easily investigate different
schedules, playing what-if games.
<P>
Our expert system splits up its rules into groups to structure
the set of rules. Each group has its own task, such as selecting
a job from the list, finding a possible place for a job in the
schedule, or checking constraints. By activating or deactivating
a rule group, users can dynamically instruct the system whether
to use a particular rule group to contribute to the solution.
<P>
<B>User interface. </B>Scheduling is a complex task. Because of
legal and other considerations, users must first accept a schedule
before it is submitted to the shop floor and from there to subsequent
plants. To accept a plan, users must first understand it and must
easily identify all the problems involved. If the system presents
them with a solution, users will rely on it only if they can easily
recognize the solution's key features. For example, the compatibility
must be visualized graphically. Otherwise, users would need to
read every entry before deciding whether compatibility is satisfied.
Consequently, the user interface is critical. The interface must
show the result of the system such that the user focuses on the
main decisions. In our case, the system should show the scheduling
of problematic jobs and highlight chemical compatibility.
<P>
By pressing a single button, the user can switch between furnaces.
Figure 5 shows a screen shot of the expert system. (Because the
representation of the schedules for both furnaces would be too
complex for the display, we show only one furnace.)
<P>

Figure 5. Screen shot of the user interface.
<P>
The middle column of the screen lists all heats scheduled for
one week. Each line describes the start time of a job, an abbreviation
of its type, its number (identity), and the steel quality coded
in a name. If the type is C, the heat is cast on the caster. B
signifies a BEST ingot, D a double casting, and F a job with a
due date.
<P>
The eight buttons on the right let us choose chemical elements,
whose curves then appear in the logarithmic diagram between the
buttons and job list. In the screen shot, we have selected tungsten
(yellow), nickel (red), and chromium (green).
<P>
If we use the mouse to select a job in the job list, its characteristics
appear in the upper-left box. The attributes are its name, the
time when the heat is poured into the ladle (<I>Abstichzeit</I>),

<B>Evaluation</B>
<P>
Before our expert system project began, the plant attempted to
schedule the heats with traditional software methods, but canceled
the program because it handled the constraints too rigidly. It
could not relax constraints. It scheduled many correctly that
were easy to schedule, but eventually stopped without scheduling
the difficult jobs. (An exhaustive search is prohibitive, because
for 35 heats we would have to examine 35! possible sequences.)
<P>
Because of the complexity and uncertainty in the application,
the plant's managers decided to try an expert system. In 1990,
we developed a first prototype, which we used to evaluate the
compatibility rules and the user interface. In 1991, we developed
the actual expert system and fielded it successfully in the beginning
of 1992.
<P>
Two factors led to our success. First, and most important for
the project, was that the management and the experts were really
interested in having such a tool. We had no problem in getting
cooperation from the plant's experts. The second, more technical
reason was the ability to express knowledge more qualitatively
and to neglect details that were not critical for solving the
problem. To determine criticality values for jobs, we have defined
classes of satisfaction degrees for constraints and have developed
a problem-oriented solution method based on the concept.
<P>
The main development goals were to relieve the plant engineers
from work and to standardize decisions. Before we installed the
expert system, the engineers spent one day each week planning,
even though their proper work is production supervision. The expert
system eliminates a lot of annoying paperwork and reduces weekly
planning time to half an hour. Although plant engineers must always
acknowledge the expert system's schedules, only in a few specific
cases involving the production of extraordinary steel qualities
do they sometimes modify the expert system's solution. As a bonus,
the experts can perform now more experiments or what-if games
to find good sequences.
<P>
The secondary aim seems to be more important for the company because
a more deterministic decision framework better supports quality
assurance. For example, if chemical infiltration destroys a heat,
we will likely modify the appropriate rule. The expert system's
rules thus become a kind of production law.
<P>
Knowledge acquisition in constructing the expert system made explicit
some implicit knowledge of the experts that the plant's managers
did not know. Management revised several rules as a consequence
of the project. However, no direct and measurable improvement
in production has emerged. Neither the flow time of jobs nor the
percentage of destroyed jobs has changed significantly. Perhaps
we achieved such an improvement, but organizational changes make
a valid comparison impossible.

<P>ALMOST THREE YEARS OF OPERATION HAVE REVEALED several drawbacks
that a new version needs to overcome. One problem is the modification
of the production process. In 1992, the plant erected a second
strand, or endless run of steel, for the continuous caster, enabling
the plant to cast more jobs on the continuous caster, and thus
slightly changing the scheduling bottleneck. The expert system
must now apply compatibility rules on the sequence of jobs on
the caster as well. We could adapt the software by inserting a
new rule group. However, the main problem involves the strategy
to be adopted. Our first strategy was motivated by the experience
of the experts, but the experts had no experience with the new
situation. Thus we had to implement more common sense than experience.
<P>
The ability to react to shop floor events that the schedule has
not foreseen would greatly enhance our system. Many production
uncertainties can regularly invalidate any schedule. Currently,
engineers can reuse the expert system, but prefer to make small
changes manually. The expert system schedules from scratch and
produces a totally new schedule, which is not what the engineers
need. They want only a patch of the old schedule.
<P>
Case data from this application shows how the expert system could
support reactive scheduling by representing constraints as fuzzy
sets and by a repair with Tabu Search.8 Such a repair technique
is also a very general technique to optimize solutions. It can
start with any randomly generated schedule and find a good one
in a reasonable time. Even with its generality, we could improve
the strategy with rules of thumb.
<P>
A further improvement would be to support the cooperation between
the different plants. Schedulers often use due dates to synchronize
production between plants. However, such data is very restrictive,
and the cooperation could be improved through fuzzy sets that
allow more flexible negotiations. To make the coordination between
plants more flexible, we are proposing to describe not only due
dates but also sequence relations by fuzzy sets.9

Jobs are usually identified with deliverableproducts, which have to meet a certain quality standard. Associatedwith each job is some formal product specification. In the steelmakingshop, the products are slabs or ingots for casting. Their specificationconsists of a chemical analysis or profile, which specifies certainamounts of alloying metals and limits the amount of other chemicalelements. It also dictates the size of slabs or ingots to produceand the casting procedure to use.<P>A <I>process plan </I>describes the processing for a certain productor group of similar products. Manufacturers typically must performa set of operations with certain resources. Technical constraintsoften restrict the temporal sequence of these operations. In a<I>flow shop,</I> these operations always require the same processingsequence. Steelmaking is usually organized as a flow shop, withthe sequence on one unit implying the same sequence on other unitsbecause steel should not cool down excessively between operations.(If job <i>j</i><sub>1</sub> is first in line on the first unit and job <i>j</i><sub>2</sub> second,and if <i>j</i><sub>2</sub> would be first on the second unit, then the second operationof <i>j</i><sub>2</sub> could immediately follow its first operation. However, thesecond operation of <i>j</i><sub>1</sub> must wait until both operations of thesecond job are finished, which would mean that the steel wouldcool down while it waits.) <P>When a number of jobs must execute together, their resource requirementsimpose additional ordering constraints, which prohibit simultaneousdemands on resources that cannot be shared. In our application,for example, two production lines share the same continuous caster,creating synchronizing constraints. A scheduler must considerboth the explicit ordering constraints imposed by the processplans and the implicit ordering constraints arising from resourceavailability. The schedule must also account for release and duedates, working hours, setup times, and maintenance intervals.<P>These restrictions can sometimes over-constrain scheduling problems.Scheduling theory therefore differentiates between hard and softconstraints.1 If a process plan observes all hard constraints,the resulting schedule is feasible. The satisfaction of soft constraints,such as due dates, then becomes the subject of optimization. Plannersdifferentiate all feasible schedules by their aggregated lateness,then search for the schedule with the least lateness. In manycases, such evaluation functions are sequence-dependent, and nosimple, constructive algorithm exists for more complex problems.In the worst case, a planner must generate and evaluate each possiblesequence to find the best solution, making  even very simple problemsintractable.2 <P>Although flow shop problems seem easier than those in generaljob shops, which don't require the same processing sequence foroperations, the theoretical complexity is the same. The difficultproblem is always the sequencing, not the temporal allocation.However, in practice, scheduling problems are often easier thanthey first seem because hard constraints dictate certain sequences.For instance, our application prohibits some sequences, so welook for jobs that are strongly constrained by such restrictionsand sequence them first.<P>While most scheduling theory focuses on approaches for findingoptimal solutions in terms of average job flow time, make span(time to complete processing), or aggregated lateness of all jobs,1such evaluations are not very useful in practice. The differencebetween the best solutions is usually not great, and many timespans assumed during planning are only vaguely known, thus leadingto a questionable optimum. Unexpected events in the shop floormight also regularly invalidate any such schedule.<P>Many application-oriented researchers consequently propose somekind of opportunistic scheduling.3 Such approaches look not onlyfor theoretically optimal solutions, but also for good ones thatcan accommodate possible shop floor disruptions. Steelmaking expertsseldom seek a single optimal solution. Rather, they assign hardconstraints to sequences that are not allowed and establish rules(or soft constraints) to identify good sequences. In steelmaking,the knowledge of the quality of solutions only concerns localdecisions and does not easily apply to the entire schedule.<P>Because the steel industry's capital expenditure is so high, improvementsto the organization of the steelmaking processes promise highreturns on investment. Consequently, the automation of processscheduling has attracted many solutions, as Roger M. Kerr's surveyof steel industry scheduling systems over the last decade shows.4 <P>Kerr's study indicates that the great diversity of steel qualitiesthat we produce makes our situation unique. By contrast, the Scheplansystem, which Masayuki Numao and Shin-ichi Morishita5 describe,optimizes the throughput of a steelmaking shop with many casters.The compatibility of consecutive jobs plays a less dominant rolethere because they produce fewer steel qualities and can castdifferent qualities on different casters. L. Richard Woodyattand his colleagues report on a solution at Bethlehem Steel thattries to match a set of customer orders with a minimal set ofproducts to best fulfill the customer's requirements.6<P>A number of other technical and capacitive constraints stem fromorganizational considerations. For example, our plant has restrictedspace available for solidifying large forging-grade ingots, makingit impossible to produce more than one of these ingots per day.We could suggest that the plant produce a less diverse group ofproducts, or that the plant's managers make more space availablefor large ingots. Our task, however, was not to improve this organizationbut to find a good solution under the given organizational constraints.<p><B>References</B><OL><LI>S.

<h3>G&ouml;del, Escher, Bach <i>redux</i></h3>
<H4><a  href="mailto:davise@cs.nyu.edu">Ernest Davis</a>, New York University</h4>

Recently, while trying to think deep thoughts about Deep Blue, I recalled a passage from Douglas Hofstadter's <i>G&ouml;del, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid</i>. <a href=#ref1>[1]</a>

<p><ul>Question: Will there be chess programs that can beat anyone?<br>
Speculation: No. There may be programs that can beat anyone at chess, but they will not be exclusively chess programs. They will be programs of <i>general</i> intelligence, and they will be just as temperamental as people. "Do you want to play chess?" "No, I'm bored with chess. Let's talk about poetry."
</ul></p>
<p>If memory serves and I am not deceived by 20/20 hindsight, this prediction seemed far-fetched even in 1979, and it has, of course, been thoroughly disproved. We now have a chess program that can beat almost anyone--soon, perhaps, a program that can beat absolutely anyone--built on the narrowest possible principles. Deep Blue doesn't discuss poetry, nor does it possess the capacity for learning or abstraction. In fact, it knows astonishingly little about chess. The program has no concept of strategies, tactics, gambits, or forks. It cannot answer elementary chess questions such as "If a bishop is now on a black square, will it ever be on a white square?" or even "What is checkmate?" It can only generate a next move of extraordinary quality.</p>
 <p>
But in a deeper sense, the match between Deep Blue and Garry Kasparov proves that Hofstadter was profoundly right. The theme Hofstadter really pursues lies in the relationship between object levels and metalevels, and the need of a reasoner capable of moving between them. This power of abstracting, of stepping outside the game to a higher-level view, enabled Kasparov to find Deep Blue's weaknesses and win his match. Even if a future chess program defeats the human opponent's ability to abstract during a chess match, Hofstadter's essential point remains: a reasoner who can abstract has creative and adaptive capacities immeasurably beyond those of a reasoner who cannot.</p>

<p>Having taken <i>G&ouml;del, Escher, Bach </i>off the shelf, I indulged myself by rereading it for the first time in years. I enjoyed and appreciated it much more than I did 16 years ago. At that time, I did not sufficiently appreciate the extraordinary patience and clarity of the presentation of G&ouml;del's theorem and its underlying concepts. Formal proof, logic and metalogic, and self-reference are all presented in a form accessible to the lay reader, with no cheating or inaccuracy, omitting only the number-theoretic details of G&ouml;del's proof.</p>

<p>After 13 years of trying to teach and write, I now marvel at Hofstadter's pedagogical skill in presenting this difficult material. The dialogues interspersed between the chapters are often contrived, arch, heavy-handed, and excessively cute, but they have virtues that far outweigh these drawbacks: they are uniformly clear, vivid, memorable, and thought-provoking. (My particular favorite, "The Magnificrab Indeed," imagines a creature able to determine mathematical truth through aesthetic judgment.)</p>

<p>The only aspect of the book that really does not work for me is the attempt to integrate music. Since music does not denote, issues of representation and self-reference levels do not apply. Similarly, the attempt to reflect musical structures mars the dialogues and accounts for much of their contrived and arch feeling. All the same, because it is so clearly an expression of love on Hofstadter's part, I don't really object. Like an unsuccessful attempt by a man to introduce old bachelor buddies to a new wife; it may not work, but one can hardly blame him for trying.</p>

<p>Rereading <i>G&ouml;del, Escher, Bach, </i>I become nostalgic for the era when it was written. Partly, I think of the halcyon years of AI when funding agencies had more money to throw around than researchers to take it, universities had more tenure-track slots than PhDs to fill them, and I was young and had the world before me. But beyond nostalgia, <i>G&ouml;del, Escher, Bach </i>reflects the feeling that computer science and AI in particular could generally contribute, not just computational tools, user interface, and fast information retrieval, but also ideas and insights of profundity and interest. I encounter this feeling less and less these days.</p>

<p>I wish I could convey this spirit to my students. I would consider it a greater accomplishment than having them master Cormen, Leiserson, and Rivest, or Russell and Norvig, or the internals of Windows95. But I do not assign <i>G&ouml;del, Escher, Bach </i>to them. How could I? After all, college education does not focus on conveying a spirit; it deals with problem sets, programming assignments, and exams. <i>G&ouml;del, Escher, Bach </i>is too wild and wooly, too full of tangents, too unconcerned with technique, to serve as a textbook. So I point it out, and hope they read it on their own. I don't think any of them do, anymore.</p>

<p>Likewise, the effervescent energy that bubbles over in <i>G&ouml;del, Escher, Bach </i>in a playful torrent of imaginings, jokes, dreadful puns, and digressions on everything under the sun--this energy reflects the enthusiasm and creativity of AI in the late 70s. Since 1979, AI has "matured" as a field, and like other types of maturing, this is a decidedly mixed blessing. I remember very well, and have no wish to revive, the methodological sins so brilliantly excoriated by Drew McDermott:<a href=#2>[2]</a> the programs, described in loving detail, that never existed or that ran on two examples; the extreme infrequency of precise evaluations, either empirical or theoretical; the tendency to pile together ill-fitting, inappropriate, and ill-understood computational mechanisms; the gaps of Hacker; the kludges of NOAH; and the cheats of AM. Nevertheless, the best work of that time offered creative approaches to large problems in a way that I rarely see today. We have gotten much more scrupulous about technique, but we have forgotten where we are supposed to be going.</p>

<p>One can see the change in the work of individual researchers. Compare Doug Lenat's PhD thesis on AM--startlingly original, clear, and insightful--with his book on CYC; .<a href=#ref3>[3, 4]</a>  one can hardly believe that the same person wrote them. 
<p>
Or, in a more fair and revealing example, compare Eugene Charniak's PhD thesis with his recent book <i>Statistical Language Learning</i>.<a href=#5>[5, 6]</a>  The later book has many advantages: it presents material solidly grounded in statistical theory, has been extensively tested and implemented, and serves as a model of clear writing. By contrast, the earlier thesis (if I remember correctly; I haven't seen a copy since 1981) was not implemented and often vague.</p>

 <p>But, the doctoral thesis dealt with a profound problem-the relation of knowledge and inference to natural language understanding-and pointed our understanding of this issue in a potentially revolutionary direction. By contrast, <i>Statistical Language Learning </i>deals with a narrower and more technical issue--the extraction and use of statistical patterns from vast textual corpora--and, though very valuable is intellectually quite conservative. I am still romantic enough to believe that, in the long run, Charniak's earlier work will be more influential.</p>
<p>
<i>G&ouml;del, Escher, Bach </i>was a masterful presentation of difficult concepts for a popular audience. Nothing else like it has appeared in computer science before or since. Why not? AI possesses many ideas and insights appreciable by an intelligent general readership: knowledge representation, heuristic search, inductive learning.... Why then are the only serious, popular books discussing AI today written by opponents like Roger Penrose?</p>

<h3>Green  engineering: AI pioneers cutting a trail</h3>
<P><B><a href="#hedberg">Sara Reese Hedberg</a></B>

<p>

Green engineering, an approach to product development that balances
environmental compatibility with economic profitability, is fast
becoming a necessary business practice. Leading automakers, computer
manufacturers, and others are recognizing the economic and legislative
pressures that necessitate going green. From design to disposal, green
engineering is finding ways to extend a product's life cycle through
reuse, remanufacturing, and recycling (see <a href =
"#sidebar">sidebar</a> "The three Rs of green
engineering"). Innovative consortiums, such as the <a
href=http://www.ce.cmu.edu/GreenDesign/>Green Design Initiative</a> at
Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), are pioneering green methodologies,
tools, and techniques that in some cases include artificial
intelligence. As a stronger foundation of green manufacturing
knowledge is built, AI's green role is likely to increase.

<p>

<h3>The magnitude of waste</h3>

<p>

In 1960, 90 million tons of municipal solid waste (MSW) were produced
in the United States. By 1990, that number had grown to over 190
million tons annually and was increasing by about 1.5% per year. By
2000, analysts expect that 215 million tons of MSW will be
produced. As we keep making more garbage, many landfills are reaching
capacity. But no one wants a landfill in their back yard, so new sites
are hard to find. There were 14,000 open landfills in the US in 1978
and 5,500 in 1992, and, if projections are correct, there will be only
1,400 open landfills by 2003.<a href="#1">[1]</a>

<p>

However, MSW was only 2% of the waste generated in the US in
1990. According to the US Office of Technology Assessment,
approximately 87% of all waste in the US is from material extraction,
processing, and manufacturing necessary to get products to market. (<a
href = "#1>[1]</a>) According to the National Academy of Sciences, fully
94% of the raw materials pulled out of the earth enters the waste
stream within months. (<a href = "#2">[2]</a>) Thus, billions of tons of
waste are actually being generated in the US annually. With decreasing
landfill space, not to mention the other environmental impacts, it is
vital that we reduce the amount of societal waste.

<p>

<h3>Global economy going green</h3>

<p>

Several factors are pushing companies toward green engineering:
environmental legislation, rising waste-disposal costs, and (to a
lesser degree) corporate image and public perception. Current and
anticipated European laws are pressuring companies that want to
compete in the global economy. Germany has led the way with its vision
of a new closed-loop economy. Legislation there already makes
manufacturers responsible for disposition of their products'
packaging. Soon, laws across Europe may force manufacturers to take
back used products.<a href = "#2">[2]</a>  Companies that want to compete in the European
marketplace will have to follow suit.

<p>

This notion of <i>stepped obsolescence</i>, where companies remanufacture
products and sell them again, is beginning to take hold among major
manufacturers. Automakers around the world--including Chrysler, Ford,
General Motors, BMW, Fiat, and Volkswagen--are already on the
bandwagon. The big computer manufacturers, such as Hewlett-Packard,
IBM, and Digital Equipment, are on board, as well.<a href = "#2">[2]</a> Even
consumer-products companies like Kodak are going green. The disposable
35-mm cameras Kodak introduced in the late eighties are now
reusable. Consumers essentially buy the film and lease the camera. The
camera is easily disassembled, reconditioned, and resold. Look on one
of these cameras and you will likely see several stickers--one for each
time it was remanufactured.

<p>

<h3>Green economics are compelling</h3>

<p>

Experience with reuse and remanufacturing is building a strong case
for the financial benefits of green engineering. First, it can lead to
production simplification. For example, D. Navin-Chandra, a pioneer in
the field of applying AI techniques to green engineering and an
assistant professor of computer science and civil engineering at CMU,
worked with a manufacturer that was using dozens of different plastics
to produce a product. It turned out that only half a dozen different
specifications were involved. This meant the manufacturer could design
the product with fewer types of materials, which translated into fewer
vendors, smaller material inventories, a more limited variety of glues
and epoxies, and fewer assembly operations. Implementing these design
changes reduced production costs and increased reusability. (<a href =
"#3">[3]</a>)

<p>

Xerox is widely touted as the leader in reaping the benefits of green
engineering. In 1991, the company saved approximately $200 million by
remanufacturing copiers after the leases ran out. Now, that figure is
up to about $500 million a year.

<p>

Today, most of the machines it leases have recycled or refurbished
parts. Xerox gives the same warranty on remanufactured as on new
machines. "This approach has tremendous impact on the valuation of the
design," explains Chandra. "If you design for recycling or
refurbishing, the design is different than if you plan to throw it
away. You use better materials, because you want to get 15 years out
of it. You make and sell it three times.

<p>

"If I need a midrange copier," he continues, "I may not need all the
latest features. I may be happy with a five- to six-year-old machine
that I can lease for less than I would pay for a new one. I pay less,
they reuse. If you do this two or three times, the manufacturer's
numbers--and I've seen the same thing with the auto industry--result in
about a one-third reduction in the total number of copiers
produced. They satisfy the demand for the country while making
one-third less copiers. There is no more powerful environmental impact
than that." Indeed, Chandra believes the Environmental Protection
Agency could lift all its rules today and companies would keep
reusing--because the practice makes money.

<p>

<h3>Pioneering green design</h3>

<p>

Xerox earned its strong green color through years of concentrated
effort internally, with some assistance from Chandra. In 1989, he
became a trailblazer in the green engineering field, forming the
Product Design Engineering Consortium at CMU. Funded by industrial
partners, the consortium's goal was to develop tools to help engineers
arrive at optimal, green product design at the front end of the life
cycle. PDEC's goals went beyond concurrent engineering (which strives
to design for assembly, diagnosis, and maintenance), to include
environmental impact. PDEC took a multidisciplinary approach,
combining AI with operations research, environmental science, public
policy, and other disciplines, to build green engineering tools and
methodologies.

<p>

PDEC has evolved into the Green Design Initiative, which was formed in
1992. GDI's charter has expanded slightly from PDEC, and now includes
product and process design, environmentally conscious engineering,
manufacturing, and architecture. GDI applies many of the lessons
learned from the PDEC days. Of foremost importance, perhaps, is that
the role of the university in the green process has its limits. For
instance, once Ford and Xerox understood the basics of green
engineering, they hired internal staff for implementation, because so
much of the work is proprietary. IBM would only open its vest so far
to PDEC, unwilling to disclose the proprietary materials used to
manufacture its PCs.

<p>

So now, GDI is developing the theoretical aspects of green design. GDI
is also educating corporate executives and senior engineers, as well
as graduate and undergraduate students, in the principles and
practices involved. One student, for instance, is now at AT&T, where
she is helping to develop the corporation's green strategy.

<p>

"The role of the university is not technology development. It is to
develop the methodology and teach the approach," notes
Chandra. Implementation should be industry's responsibility.

<p>

Since 1989, Chandra has been developing his expertise in green
design. He has also been developing ReStar, an AI-based
software-planning tool to design for disassembly (see Figure
1). Recently, two CMU students founded the Green Engineering
Corporation (Pittsburgh), a four-person consulting company that uses
ReStar in engagements. Clients include Fiat and an
as-yet-to-be-made-public large furniture manufacturer (see Table 1).

<h3>Design for disassembly</h3>

<p>

In 1995, <i>Fortune</i> magazine called Design for Disassembly "the
hottest new production trend in the world."<a href = "#2">[2]</a>  ReStar, already
several years in use by that time, has cut the trail for advanced DFD
tools. Disassembly is a fairly traditional AI planning
problem--the traveling salesperson with a slight
twist. Disassembly can be a very complex problem, given the number of
components involved, so optimizing for speed was important.

<p>

"We were looking at how to disassemble physical things with 30 to 40
parts," explains Chandra. "We constrained the problem so we could plan
200 to 300 steps in linear time and optimize. We assumed that no two
parts exist at the same time, in the same place, and that there were
only six degrees of freedom." ReStar uses the A* algorithm, a form of
dynamic programming that guarantees an optimal solution over multiple
objectives.<P>

But simply solving the problem of how to disassemble a product does
not address the business issues involved. The plan must be optimized
to balance the cost per hour of disassembly with what can be
sold. This so-called <i>recovery problem</i> is where ReStar shines. It
ensures that the disassembly plan makes more money than it costs.

<p>

"We have learned that not all disassembly investments are worth it,"
notes Chandra. A major European company had built a vacuum cleaner,
and then invested heavily in disassembly design to remove a toxic
filter. The company ran the design through ReStar and discovered that
the cost of disassembly was more than throwing the whole thing into a
landfill--not very popular with environmentalists, but the CMU green
group recognizes the hard realities of business.

<p>

"As we get deeper into the disassembly process," says Chandra, "what's
left may not be worth the cost of further disassembly. ReStar
optimizes between full disassembly and none." Thus, it is a special
case of the traveling salesperson problem: the peddler doesn't have to
visit every city--all parts don't have to be disassembled or recovered.

<p>

ReStar plots a cost curve of the effort required for disassembly,
testing, repair, remanufacturing, and product changes that enable
recovery. It also plots a curve of the revenue from resale and
reuse. The tool helps design engineers find the optimal meeting point
of the two curves.

<p>

<h3>A lesson in KISS</h3>

<p>

In its first instantiation, ReStar was built in Lisp. Its developers
have since recoded it in C, and are in the process of porting it to
Windows. ReStar developers have talked to industry to find out what is
useful. They've learned that the biggest benefit of ReStar is its
ability to spin multiple what-if scenarios: "What if we change
materials?" "What if the cost of plastic goes up?" And so on.

<p>

On the basis of these discussions, they have removed many features
from the original architecture. "Some of the complex AI features are
turned off," explains Chandra. "As a researcher, this is difficult to
accept. Why did AutoCAD take off more than ComputerVision? Because
AutoCAD was simple. Microsoft is simple technology, but it has
business savvy--it knows how to meet customers where they are."

<p>

So the developers removed features from ReStar--showing that once again
the KISS (keep it simple, stupid) principle holds true. For example,
they turned off an automated facility to find subassemblies. The
ability to run sensitivity analysis, cross-correlating as many as 10
parameters, was elegant but was the system's least used and least
liked feature. It wasn't going to help design engineers do a better
job, so the designers turned it off. Another fancy feature enabled
users to visualize the trade-offs among multiple objectives. But users
wanted to think only about cost--and maybe one other dimension--so it
was canned.

<p>

<h3>The greening of AI</h3>

<p>

"Even though no green design approaches are in this special issue of
<i>Expert</i> magazine," says James Garrett, guest editor for this issue and
an associate professor of civil and environmental engineering at CMU,
"many applications [of AI] for traditional design could be made for
green design. Traditionally, designers must consider lots of
constraints and objectives--economic, material strength and safety, and
such. Now the same techniques ought to be used to support green
design--such as energy evaluation and disassembly analysis [Chandra's
work]."

<p>

While Chandra has effectively applied one AI technique to the green
arena, the gating factor for wider use of AI for green engineering
seems to be knowledge, or the lack thereof. "Until recently," Garrett
notes, "there hasn't been a good definition of what 'green' means. So
it's difficult to develop knowledge-based systems when the knowledge
required is not yet there. We rely on researchers to develop the
knowledge; then we technologists can incorporate it into systems."

<p>

As the green gets greener, AI is one tool in the bag that the Green
Design Initiative plans to use. Experiments using AI are already under
way at GDI, for brokering environmental regulations on the Web. GDI
researchers are experimenting with search techniques that can help
identify which particular regulations apply in particular
situations. They are also looking at automatic classification and
search of the data. Lexical analysis may prove useful in indexing
these rapidly changing standards and regulations. The initiative's
work in life-cycle analysis is about ready for implementation in an AI
system. Genetic algorithms, having passed muster in product design,
will likely find a place in the green tool suite of the future.

<p>

<h3>Environmentalism and the bottom line</h3>

<p>

We often perceive environmentalism and capitalism as antithetical
concepts. But in the emerging field of green engineering, they are
becoming partners. "Green design works," asserts Chandra, "because of
conservation and recovery--every time a part or material is recycled,
one saves the energy, material, and environmental impacts of creating
the product from scratch. This translates to cost savings for
industries and leads to the creation of new jobs in remanufacturing
and recycling." (<a href = "#4">4</a>)

<p>
"We help companies do well by doing good," explains Lester Lave, director of GDI and an economics professor at CMU. "By reducing costs, they can increase revenues." And that's the bottom line.

<h3>The three <i>Rs</i> of green engineering</h3>
<p>
The three <i>Rs</i> of green engineering are reuse, remanufacturing, and recycling:
<ul>
<li><i>Reuse</i> means using a functional component from a retired product.
<li><i>Remanufacturing</i> means bringing a product to "like new" condition through reusing, reconditioning, and replacing components.
<li><i>Recycling</i> involves taking component material and reprocessing it into the same material or breaking it down into constituent materials. (<a href = "#1_side">1</a>)
</ul>
<p>
According to the US Office of Technology Assessment, the most dramatic reduction in environmental impact can be made through product reuse and remanufacturing, where the geometric form of the product is retained and the product is reused for the same purpose as during its original life cycle. (<a href = "#2_side">2</a>) By contrast, recycling destroys the product and its value, and its constituent materials are used in a new cycle.
<p>
"Every time a part is reused, all the energy and emissions that were produced in its manufacturing and the processing of its materials are salvaged," notes CMU's D. Navin-Chandra, a pioneer in the field of applying AI techniques to green engineering. (<a href = "#3_side">3</a>)

<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>IEEE Expert - Interview: Raj Reddy</TITLE></HEAD><body bgcolor="#ffffff"><img src="../../../expert.gif"><p><a href="../../../dept4-96.htm">Departments</a><P><blockquote><h3>Interview</h3><h2>Raj Reddy speaks from experience</h2><p><i>Interviewed by Dick Price, Managing Editor</i></p><blockquote><img src=x20080a1.gif align=left hspace=10><p>Raj Reddy, dean of the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University and long a seminal figure in speech understanding and vision recognition, traces his interest in the field to his first year of graduate studies at Stanford in 1963. John McCarthy, his professor at the time and a participant at the original conference on artificial intelligence at Dartmouth in 1956, had just brought a PDP-1 computer into the classroom. McCarthy mentioned in passing that it might be possible someday to process speech into thought. Reddy, who had already spent several years as an applied science representative for IBM in Australia, was piqued by the comment and soon devoted himself to the problem of machine-based speech recognition. A long track record of accomplishment ensued. </p><p>Victor Lessor, his contemporary at the University of Massachusetts, reckons that Reddy's PhD thesis "stands as a landmark in showing how heuristic knowledge can play an essential role in the interpretation of sensory data from noisy signal data" (see <i>IEEE Expert,</i> Feb. 1995, p. 69). Reddy's early ground-breaking work also showed that complex and computationally intensive signal processing was not necessary for extracting meaningful data characterizations. Lessor points to Reddy's "guidance, intuition, sheer drive, and unwillingness to admit defeat" as key factors in creating such developments as the Hearsay System, which underlies blackboard problem-solving architectures in general, and the Dragon, Harpy, and Sphinx speech technologies.</p><p>In 1969, Reddy founded Carnegie Mellon's Robotics Institute, which he then led for 10 years. He also helped found the American Association for Artificial Intelligence and served as one of its early presidents. In 1994, his lifetime of contributions earned him the A.M. Turing Award as a co-winner with fellow AI pioneer, Ed Feigenbaum. Reddy's award honored him for "pioneering the design and construction of large-scale AI systems, demonstrating the practical importance and potential commercial impact of this technology." Also, in recognition of his work for the World Center for Computer Science and Human Resources, which works to bring advanced technology to developing countries, Reddy received the Legion of Honor from France's President Francois Mitterand in 1984.</p><p>Recently, Raj took a few minutes to share with <i>IEEE Expert</i> readers his historical perspective on the problems involved in speech understanding as well as an outline of his current interests and general assessment of AI's prospects.</p></blockquote><b>IEEE Expert:</b> <i>Why has computer-based speech understanding been such a hard problem to solve?</i><blockquote><p><b>Reddy:</b> Speech involves many different disciplines, ranging from linguistics to acoustics and speech science to acoustic phonetics. Besides mastering those, you need to be an expert in computers, hardware, operating systems, and real-time input devices. And you need to be fairly conversant with statistics and statistical modeling of language and acoustics. In addition to the language aspects of semantics, syntax, and acoustic phonetics, you also need to know how to model task-specific information and dialogue.</p><p>A wide range of problems crop up in these systems. This wasn't fully appreciated in the beginning. People thought we would only have to recognize the words and that would be it. We did develop a word recognizer in a couple years, but it was only for one speaker on a small vocabulary. That was not good enough to have spontaneous conversational speech. After all this time, we still don't know how to do that.</p><p>Over time, we have developed a continuously better understanding of what works and what doesn't. Two main developments from the seventies have stayed with us. First came the idea of modeling sounds and phonemes as a sequence of states, which we can represent as a hidden Markov model for automatically discovering speech properties. Second, when you have a very large search space, you cannot even afford to do an optimal search, such as A* search, on the whole space. So we invented a new technique called beam search. That was in the seventies during the days of the Harpy system, which is still widely used throughout the AI community. Today, almost every system uses hidden Markov models and beam search.</p><p>That was 20 years ago. Since then, a lot of advances have occurred, all dealing with the question: Can we have a single, speaker-independent representation--one that works for all speakers? Can we have environments where you change microphones, speakers, and rooms and still not have the system fall apart? This turned out to be possible, although that possibility was not accepted even as late as 1988. We're still working on it.</p><p>Finally, as you move toward spontaneous speech, people hesitate, use umhs and ahs, repeat themselves, stop in the middle, and never speak grammatically. So there's a whole class of problems posed by unrehearsed, spontaneous speech. This was not fully appreciated in the beginning. We have only partially solved these problems.</p></blockquote><i>What commercial successes have come out of speech understanding?</i><blockquote><p>Currently, the main commercial systems come from Dragon Systems--Dragon Dictate and a number of similar systems. Systems from Dragon, IBM, Kurzweil AI, Microsoft, and Apple all provide respectable recognition performance, but they're not robust under changing environments. Unlike research groups where we have unlimited memory and computational power, commercial systems have to work in constrained environments, such as on a 486 with 16 Mbytes of memory. You can do some tasks with such systems--you can easily do the digit recognition--but you can't do dictation with 20,000-word vocabulary.</p></blockquote><i>What progress will these systems make in the next five years?</i><blockquote><p>We'll see lots of progress, not the least because of the higher-speed computational power that will become available routinely on desktops and laptops. For example, we fully expect to have a giga-PC, where you have a billion operations per second, a billion-byte system, by the year 2000.</p><p>The toughest problem is to achieve better performance at a faster rate using limited resources. It's a continuum. Right now, the hard problems are the robustness problems--what happens when you change microphones and environments and so on. The other problem is spontaneous conversational speech phenomena, which are not fully understood.</p><p>Then there are some fundamental problems in acoustics, where human beings seem to sense nuances perfectly well that current systems can't seem to handle. There are fundamental limitations in our current models. We'll have to see what it'll take to get beyond that. </p></blockquote><i>How would you rate the whole field of artificial intelligence today?</i><blockquote><p>I am very enthusiastic and upbeat about it. Others seem to think that we're on a plateau or in a rut. To them, not a lot is happening. I think there are lots of great things happening. Many of them will have a fundamental impact on society.</p><p>I see a number of "Grand Challenges" in AI--interesting, challenging problems we can do. One that fascinates me in particular is the problem of giving the computer a chapter in accounting or physics or whatever of a freshman text and asking it to answer the questions at the end of the chapter. We just don't have any system that can do that, whereas human beings, freshman students, especially if they're bright enough, don't even need a teacher. They can read the chapter and begin working on the problems by themselves.</p><p>Also, we don't know how to build systems that improve with experience. You run a computer program and you run it again--it takes exactly the same amount of time. But with a human being, if I teach you how to do something, the next time you do it, you'll get a little better. And you'll keep getting better, up to your human limitations. We don't have computers that can get better with experience.</p><p>Another challenge is to build computers that can discover, say, mathematical results or play chess and beat the world champion, computers that can help reproduce themselves--as in self-reproducing factories. What knowledge must exist so that a factory can make a copy of itself?</p></blockquote><i>What stands in the way of these developments?</i><blockquote><p>First, somebody has to determine that these are important problems. Each of these grand challenges is similar to putting a man on the moon. They're literally billion-dollar problems. Certainly, we need coordination between government, universities, and the private sector. In addition, as John McCarthy would say, we need 1.3 Einsteins, 2 Maxwells, and something else we don't even know about yet. We need new conceptual advances, but we haven't even begun working on those problems.</p><p>For instance, we have been working on speech now for 30 years and we have made progress. That doesn't mean we have solved the problem of speech recognition, but we have made substantial gains. You need the same sort of effort devoted to these other challenges.</p><p>Sure, people are working on the learning problem, for example, but nobody is working on this problem in such a way that you can actually measure success or failure crisply--either the system can answer the questions at the end of the chapter or it can't. If it can answer 13 out of 16 questions, at least we know where we stand. But if somebody simply works on general-purpose learning, we won't know what we have. </p></blockquote><i>How do you rate the current coordination between AI research centers, the government, and the commercial sector?</i><blockquote><p>There isn't any well-defined coordination. After the hype of the eighties, people became somewhat disenchanted with the whole field, except we hard-core believers. The people who jumped in because it was fashionable have left, which is a good thing. Now we can get back to doing the hard work that needs to be done. The enterprise we're involved in is an enormous undertaking. It may take 100 years, or even multiples of that. We'll need people with the dedication to carry through.</p></blockquote><i>With the explosion of interest in the Internet, there's some concern about the future role of printed magazines and journals. Do you have any thought on this?</i><blockquote><p>Yes, ultimately all magazines will become multimedia vehicles and will be available in digital form, and be on the Web. But, 90% of the people will not have a computer to see them there.</p><p>Rather than doing centralized printing, I will subscribe to a magazine, which will be available on the Net. I will print out the articles I want to read on my own printer. I will still need all the infrastructure and people that are already there, including editors, writers, and artists. The only people I won't need are the ones who print and ship the printed copy.</p><p>We'll save a lot of paper this way, because most articles in most of the magazines I get, I simply don't read--I don't have the time or interest. As it is, I throw away a basket full of paper every day. With multimedia magazines, I can scan articles on the screen and print hard copies of the ones I want to read. If I don't have a subscription, I can go to the library and print them out there--and pay a copyright fee if necessary.</p><p>Besides working on speech recognition, I'm also interested in digital libraries--how to scan all the books and journals and get them on-line. The issue for digital libraries is not so much the research itself, because a lot of it is being done in various places, but the effort of conceptualization and coordination of what it will take to get the Library of Congress, for example, on-line and available. There are questions of intellectual property issues, the roles different people and groups will need to play to get it done, the scanning itself, the optical character reading and corrections of errors--all kinds of things. Getting huge content on-line is one of the challenges that most interests me. (See June's "Trends &amp; Controversies" department, which will address the issue of digital libraries and also include Raj Reddy's point of view.)</p></blockquote></blockquote><p><hr></p><p><i><a href="../../../expert.htm">IEEE Expert Online</a></i> | <a href="../../../depart.htm">Departments</a>| <a href="../../../feature.htm">Features</a> | <a href="../../../ai-www/ai-www.htm">AIon the WWW</a> | <a href="../../../board/board.htm">Editorial Board</a></p><p><a href="../../../../pubs.htm">Computer Society Publications</a> | <a href="../../../../../cshome.htm">ComputerSociety home page</a> </p><p>Send comments and questions about <i>IEEE Expert Online</i> to AnneHumphreys and Managing Editor Dick Price, <a href="mailto:ah34+@andrew.cmu.edu,dprice@computer.org">ah34+@andrew.cmu.eduand dprice@computer.org</a></p><p>Send general comments and questions about the IEEE Computer Society'sWeb site to <a href="mailto:webmaster@computer.org">webmaster@computer.org</a></p><p><i><font SIZE=-1>Copyright (c) Institute of Electrical and ElectronicsEngineers, Inc.

<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>Almost there: a new medium on the Web</TITLE></HEAD><body bgcolor="#ffffff"><img src="../../../expert.gif"><p><a href="../../../depart.htm">Departments</a><P><blockquote><h2>Internet Services</h2><P><H3>Almost there: a new medium on the Web</H3><p> <b><a href=mailto:flammia@sls.lcs.mit.edu>Giovanni Flammia</a>,MIT Laboratory for Computer Science</b><P>In his famous article, (<a href = "#1">1</a>) Vannevar Bush envisioned<i>memex</i> (memory extension), "a device in which an individual stores allhis books, records, and communications, and which is mechanized sothat it may be consulted with exceeding speed and flexibility." Memexstores, links, and retrieves annotated text, photographs, speech,video, and film recordings. One of its important functions is that itallows annotation and retrieval, or "selection" of multimodalinformation on the basis of semantic content. According to Bush, tofacilitate content retrieval, "there is a new profession oftrailblazers, those who find a delight in the task of establishinguseful trails through the enormous mass of the common record." (<ahref = "#2">2</a>) At the beginning of the article, he predicted thatthe interface to memex would use speech recognition andunderstanding. By the end, he envisioned an interface that coulddetect the electric waveforms from our brain to record thoughts anddreams and transform them into retrievable memex documents.  <P>The dramatic consequences of widespread addiction to such adream-recording device is the subject of the 1991 movie by WimWenders, <i>Until the End of the World</i>, starring William Hurt. Addictedto viewing one another's dreams, the characters fall into a passivestate of confusion, preferring the visual wonders of virtual realityover the physical world.  <p>That same year, Tim Berners-Lee invented theWeb, which is materializing many features predicted bymemex. According to statistical records, many of us are alreadyaddicted to it, and some of us post our intimate journals, thoughts,and visions in a manner perhaps not so different from what isdescribed in Wim Wender's film.  <P>In my opinion, the Web will eventually evolve into a truly dynamicmultimodal medium without its current bias for staticpresentations. This medium will be different from and coexist withprint, radio, cinema, television, cable, and video rentals. One of thefeatures of memex that will materialize on the Web is the availabilityof audio and video media that can be linked and retrieved in much thesame way as hypertext is.  In their present form, Web documents tendto very closely follow the more static printed-media paradigm. <p>Most Web documents have the familiar look and feel of the printed page,with section/subsection hierarchical structure, an index, a table ofcontents, and links that let us jump to other documents. Searchengines and <i>trailblazers</i> have a bias for the printed word.2 Video andaudio content is accessible as separate downloadable, monolithic filesthat record data produced for other noninteractive media, such astelevision and radio broadcasts.  <P>However, when first introduced, every new medium borrows content fromexisting media, and then eventually evolves into its own particularform. Cinema derived from live theater. Television derived from livetheater and cinema. The Web inherits features from printed media aswell as from all other modern communication media, including TVadvertising (embedding animated text into short, eye-catching videoclips), film animation, and more interactive media such as telephoneconversations, electronic mail, newsgroups, and video on demand.  <P><H3>Infrastructure</H3> To fulfill some of the memex predictions,access to multimedia Web documents requires a real-time distributioninfrastructure, efficient indexing and retrieval, and machine-assistedcontent creation. Effective live transmission of continuous media ondemand requires high bandwidth connections--at least 1.5 kilobits persecond for MPEG-quality (Moving Picture Expert Group)--and a reliablereal-time infrastructure such as the asynchronous transfer mode (ATM)network.(<a href = "#3">3</a>) The transmission-controlprotocol/Internet protocol (TCP/IP) and full file-transfer mode arenot well-suited for such a demanding task.  <P>High-bandwidth multimedia running on the Integrated Services DigitalNetwork (ISDN) and cable modems should be supported by a reliable,open infrastructure beyond a heterogeneous collection of proprietarybrowser plug-ins. One solution is to use new protocols for real-timedata, such as Video Datagram Protocol (VDP) and multimedia HypertextMarkup Language (HTML) extensions proposed by the Vosaic team atUrbana-Champaign. (<a href = "#4">4</a>) Another solution is to embedreal-time features into the kernel of the operating systems that driveWeb-enabled appliances.  <P>Some examples of real-time operating systems are Lynx, (<a href ="#5">5</a>) Microware's OS-9, and David. (<a href = "#6">6</a>) OS-9,initially developed for interactive television set-up boxes andinteractive CD-ROMs, can be embedded into portable Internet devicessuch as personal digital assistants (PDAs) and cellular phones, andincludes a real-time compiler for the Java virtual machine. A commonfeature of real-time protocols is that they provide two communicationchannels for multimedia applications: a high-speed data channel thatcarries audio and video content, and a lower-speed control andsignaling channel.  <P><H3>Browsing</H3>Let's assume that we all have our fire-hose connection to theInternet. How will the trailblazers search the whole Web for the clipwhere Tom Hanks interprets the famous "Houston, we have a problem"? Tobe certain, a multimedia search engine is not available yet, butrecent research shows promise about how such a program could scout theWeb and could index audio and video files. The key challenge will beto combine fast video- and audio-indexing techniques.  <P>At least two recent research contributions demonstrate the feasibilityof video indexing. Philippe Aigrain and Philippe Joly from IRIT,France, (<a href = "#7">7</a>) have developed a digital-imageprocessing algorithm that detects and indexes shot transitions infeature films. The method uses statistics about differences betweenpixels of successive images as an indicator of shot change. The basicprinciple is that pixel intensities are correlated between successiveframes within the same shot, while they tend to be uncorrelated acrossdifferent shots.  <P>Another algorithm parses video news sequences using a priori knowledgeabout the clip's genre. (<a href = "#8">8</a>) News broadcasts follow a structure: there areshots of one or more anchorpersons talking to the audience in astudio, interspersed with on-location footage, interviews,commercials, weather reports, and so on. All these shots have specificshort-term and long-term visual and textual cues that we can derivefrom image-processing algorithms. We can use these cues to segment andlabel the shots according to their genre.  <P>Audio indexing is also making exciting progress. Research projects atBBN Hark Systems are using large-vocabulary speech recognizers andkeyword spotters to identify the topic of telephone conversations, (<ahref = "#9">9</a>) and the CMU Infomedia project is using them toindex and retrieve documentary video footage. (<a href = "#10">10</a>)<P>Meanwhile, at MIT, Michelle Spina and Victor Zue are demonstratingthat it is possible to index radio broadcasts into individual segmentssuch as monologue, dialogue, music, and speech over music. (<a href ="#11">11</a>) Once they segment and label the video stream intosmaller units by combining video and audio techniques, they canorganize those units into a database that information-retrievalalgorithms can help search.  <P><H3>Presentation</H3> Traditionally, television and radio broadcastshave followed a linear thread imposed by the film director and theeditor. Once the video stream has deconstructed into smaller units ofdiscourse that are separately accessible, why must the presentationfollow a linear thread? For example, we can view news stories,political debates, and history and science documentaries, fromdifferent perspectives and with a varying level of detail.  <P>A well-designed hypermedia presentation should allow almost any levelof summarization or detail and should permit critical viewing fromdifferent points of view. But once a hypermedia document is on theWeb, the author cannot rely on only one entry point and exit point tothe document. Viewers can potentially access any segment in anyorder. This poses a serious design problem for Web authors. How canthe author effectively convey her point of view in a coherent manner,whether it is a main theorem or a political opinion, without theability to control the presentation's context and time schedule?  <P>One interesting solution is an intelligent system for hypermediadocumentaries, called ConText, (<a href = "#12">12</a>) whoseprinciple is the following. The viewer accesses a ConText documentary,for example a collection of related video segments about Boston'sNorth End. The authors have annotated each segment with a semanticframe that stores its who-what-when-where content. While the user isbrowsing, an interface logs all the clips viewed by the user into ahistory list. This interface presents on the screen one or more stillframes linked to video clip files. The user selects one frame with themouse, to view the corresponding clip. While the clip is playing, theinterface suggests how to proceed in the navigation, depending on theviewing history. It pulls to the foreground frame stills of some otherrelevant video clips, and pushes to the background and out of focusframe stills belonging to unrelated clips. Clearly, the author canbias the navigation path to ensure that the user views certainsegments in a particular order.  <P>ConText is a good example of what I would call a dynamic, rather thanstatic, presentation. We can extend this paradigm to the entirecollection of Web documents. Future Web documents will store theircontext-sensitive state in variables and adapt their presentationon-the-fly, depending on the viewing history.  <P>Current trail-blazer Web sites introduce some AI techniques forbrowsing the Web in a top-to-bottom fashion, with the search engine atthe top and the collection of Web documents at the bottom. We can alsothink about incorporating some intelligence, in a bottom-up fashion,into the documents themselves. That would truly be a new medium. Andthe exciting thing is, we're almost there. I know <i>I'll</i> be addicted toit, recording my dreams on my battery-operated memex ..."Houston, wehave a problem. . . ."  <P><h3>References</h3><OL><a name = "1"><LI> V.

<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>IEEE Expert - The Future of Knowledge Acquisition: a European Perspective</TITLE></HEAD><body bgcolor=#ffffff><img src="../../../expert.gif" border=0 height=41 width=510><p><a href="../../../feature.htm">Feature Articles</a> </p><blockquote><h3>Guest Editors' Introduction</h3><h2>The Future of Knowledge Acquisition: a European Perspective</h2><p><b>Walter Van de Velde, AI Lab, Free University, Brussels</b><br><b>Guus Schreiber, SWI, University of Amsterdam</b></p><p>Knowledge acquisition is critical for constructing any intelligent system. For small or noncritical applications, acquisition often proceeds in an ad hoc fashion, typically driven by rule-based technology. For these applications, rules directly represent knowledge and a general-purpose, rule-based inference engine accounts for the reasoning capabilities of experts. Larger applications with higher industrial-quality requirements, however, clearly demand more solid methodologies.</p><p>During the eighties, several key contributions shaped our current perception of the knowledge-acquisition problem: Allen Newell's notion of knowledge level, William Clancey's critical analyses, and the broader wave of second-generation expert-system research. Central to this perception is the <i>knowledge model</i>, which views knowledge acquisition as the construction of a model of problem-solving behavior-that is, a model in terms of knowledge instead of representations.</p><p>The concept of knowledge-level modeling has matured considerably since Newell introduced it. As currently practiced, the notion differs considerably from the original proposal.<a href=ref1>[1]</a> Practical knowledge-level models incorporated in today's methodologies not only reflect the knowledge content of a system. They also make explicit the structures within which the knowledge operates in solving particular classes of problems, which enables reuse of models across applications.</p><p>The structures provide a framework for knowledge acquisition and a decomposition of the overall acquisition task. Identified parts of knowledge-level models-domain models or problem-solving methods-can serve in different systems or in different roles in the same system. Also, certain knowledge structures are more apt to be put into operation systematically in certain computational architectures, a characteristic that facilitates the mapping from knowledge level to symbol level or implementation. The main advantage remains: the knowledge level focuses attention on the knowledge that makes systems work, rather than on the symbol-level, computational design decisions that provide the operational framework (see also B. Chandrasekaran<a href=ref2>[2]</a>).</p><p><b>This special series</b></p><p>This series of four articles, which started in the February issue of <i>IEEE Expert</i>, highlights representative developments in knowledge-level modeling. Conceptually, the knowledge-modeling frameworks are well established.<a href=ref3>[3]</a> Two major lines of work build on these frameworks. One refines existing knowledge-level frameworks, with a particular emphasis on formalization. Formal knowledge-level models are an important step toward making these frameworks unambiguous, exchangeable, and more easily operational. In <i>Expert</i>'s February issue, Frank van Harmelen, Manfred Aben, Fidel Ruiz, and Joke van de Plassche ("Evaluating a Formal KBS Specification Language," <i>IEEE Expert,</i> Feb. 1996, pp. 56-62) gave criteria for evaluating formal languages for knowledge-level modeling and applied these criteria to the ML<sup>2</sup> language. (See also the "World Impact" report in this issue, which discusses the Department of Social Science Informatics (SWI) at the University of Amsterdam, where much of the work for this article took place, pp. 74-76.)</p><p>A second line of work applies knowledge-level modeling in various ways, some less obvious than others. Traditionally, designers have attacked the range of problem-solving tasks in constructing a library of reusable knowledge models.<a href=ref4>[4]</a> These libraries provide the basic material for reuse. When a substantial group of people use these knowledge models, research can focus on identifying generic components. Such efforts are now underway to identify generic task structures, problem-solving methods, and ontologies for reuse across applications. As a typical example, Dolores Cañamero ("Modeling Plan Recognition for Decision Support," June issue) investigates an important class of problem-solving methods geared toward recognizing plans from observed behaviors.</p><p>Two other articles illustrate how to apply knowledge-level modeling to learning, validation, and knowledge-engineering know-how. That this can be done is not really a surprise: these activities involve problem-solving anyway. But the prospect of applying knowledge-level modeling to a broader range of knowledge-engineering problems could enable much greater integration of results. For example, one approach is to investigate modeling and reuse of the knowledge-acquisition process. Sabine Geldof, Aurelien Slodzian, and Walter Van de Velde ("From Verification to Life Cycle Support," this issue, pp. 67-73) describe a set of reusable components for metaprojects-knowledge-based system projects about knowledge-based system projects. Using verification as a case study, they illustrate how a reflective implementation of a knowledge-acquisition tool can capture and reuse knowledge-engineering expertise on the basis of exactly the same knowledge-modeling framework as the object-level project. </p><p>Another fascinating direction is to apply knowledge-level modeling to describe learning components. Knowledge-engineering researchers have tried this for many years, but only with the richer type of knowledge-level models available today are they producing useful results. For instance, Céline Rouveirol and Patrick Albert ("Knowledge-Level Model of a Configurable Learning System," August issue) describe the use of knowledge-level models to configure learning algorithms and systems. Their approach makes explicit the alternatives in the algorithms and the selection of appropriate biases. The greatest promise of treating machine learning and problem solving in a uniform modeling framework is their integration in single systems.</p><p><b>Tomorrow's knowledge-technology opportunities</b></p><p>The topics these articles explore thus have more than academic value. The ap-plicability of precise knowledge models to a wide variety of knowledge-engineering problems makes these models essential for dealing with tomorrow's knowledge-technology opportunities. A bright future for knowledge engineering is taking shape as a result. For example, business process re-engineering, knowledge management, and social learning are hot topics and crucial features of tomorrow's successful organizations. European organizations, in particular, are finding this to be so, because the large but diverse European market requires ever-greater flexibility and adaptability. The knowledge-engineering community contributes its particular view on the business process: the knowledge perspective. For this community, "knowledge as a crucial asset for success" is more than a cliché, but is backed up by solid techniques and methodologies.</p><p>Also, technological developments in hyper- and multimedia, and in networking, are creating new ways to put this expertise into practice. These developments perfectly complement the new uses we have been discussing. For example, wide-area networks provide the infrastructure needed for effective knowledge management in small- and medium-sized organizations. Similar technology on a larger scale-such as the information highways planned for Europe and the US-will allow easier exchange and reuse of knowledge descriptions. Intelligent on-line services and software agents are gradually appearing. These developments will enable us to apply years of research in knowledge engineering with an impact never before envisaged.</p><p>But, enough hype: some elements in this puzzle are still missing, which will force us to go back to "old" problems. Knowledge elicitation, the very first step of turning raw material into a knowledge model, is more relevant than ever. The problem may be eased because knowledge models provide greater guidance on what to seek in the primary material. The amount of such material and its potential sources, however, is huge. For example, the knowledge may be on the World-Wide Web, but it is scattered and in different forms, us-ing multiple media and different words and languages. Turning this into a well-structured knowledge model is one of the challenges now facing us, as is the need to extract knowledge from databases. We can expect a resurgence of work on knowledge elicitation and a wider use of machine-learning tools.</p><p>The articles in this series are based on material presented at the Eighth Euro-pean Knowledge Acquisition Workshop (EKAW) held in 1994 in Hoegaarden, near Brussels.<a href=ref1>[5]</a> EKAW-96 will meet in Nottingham, England, on May 14-17; both of us are on its International Program Committee.</p><P><B>REFERENCES</B></P><ol><li><a name=ref1></a>W.

With each issue of <i>IEEE Expert</i>, we will keep you posted on interesting and innovative Web technologies. This first installment looks at the latest Web conference. Future columns will discuss issues related to commerce and security, live and on-demand real-time multimedia, new protocols, and proposed standards.</p><p>These are exciting times for everyone involved with the Web. New sites appear by the minute and use is growing exponentially. The Web is rapidly becoming the ideal medium for disseminating and retrieving multimedia information and for conducting financial transactions. At the same time, the technology underlying the Web and the content it carries are still evolving, which presents new challenges at every turn.</p><p>We hope to involve you in these discussions. We are interested in your experiences with the Web. Do you integrate Web technology in your intelligent systems? Do you find the Web useful or a waste of time? Are you overwhelmed by information and concerned about your privacy across the net? Share your thoughts with us.</p><p><b>The Web Revolution</b></p><p>Last December, the Fourth International World Wide Web Conference in Boston gave us a bird's-eye view of today's Web technology and where it's headed. Called "The Web Revolution," this sold-out event attracted more than 2,000 participants, leaving hundreds on the waiting list. Naturally, most of the material from the conference is available on the Web.</p><p>Underneath the conference's steady buzz of excitement and anticipation was a sense that today's Web is in its infancy and lacks crucial features. For example, the Web is quickly becoming a commercial marketplace, with many sites accepting credit cards or various forms of electronic currency for purchases. Security concerns, however, are lagging and need tremendous attention. The "Business to Business" panel session, chaired by MIT's Peter Roden, emphasized that until the Web is truly secure, businesses cannot trust the Internet for commerce. An excellent tutorial by Adam Cain from the National Center for Supercomputing Applications looked at the issues and implementation of security measures, which the "Payment" session later examined in more detail.</p><p>As Cain described, security means many things, including </p><ul><li>authentication (proving who you say you are), </li><li>privacy (so others cannot read your files traveling across the network), </li><li>access control (limiting who has access to your service), and </li><li>system security (preventing security loopholes in your system). </li></ul><p>Well-known cryptographic technologies have emerged, including RSA Lab's public-key system and the US government's Data Encryption Standard (DES). People are now investigating how to incorporate them into the Web. Proposed standards include Netscape's Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Enterprise Integration Technology's Secure-http (shttp).</p><p>Accounting issues, which principally involve devising electronic currencies to pay for purchases and Web-site visits, pose a related dilemma: charging for browsing could scare people away, but services would likely improve if profits were available. Proposals for digital currency abound, some proposing an entirely new currency and others trying to link the currency to the US dollar. The Millicent Protocol, discussed during the "Payment" session, aims to support purchases costing less than a cent. Privacy is another critical issue for accounting. Individuals need protection so that their account numbers and purchases cannot be widely traced, yet governments also desire sufficient access to this information for law-enforcement purposes.</p><p>The Web usually displays information using long text files that are hard to read on screen and filled with obscure, button-like symbols and banners. In his tutorial on designing better Web sites, Sun Microsystems' Jakob Nielsen described several systematic methods for improving the usability of corporate Web home pages. Drawing from his long experience as a usability engineer, he advocated an iterative design process. Such a process presents several hypertext interface options to real users and systematically evaluates their use, or misuse, to produce a more usable, graphically pleasing Web site. In decrying current visual displays on the Web, Disney Imagineering's Bran Ferren advocated enlisting communication artists and writers to replace the hackers who now design the great majority of existing home pages.</p><p><b>Web censorship</b></p><p>How to limit what children are allowed to see on the Web is a great concern and current political hot potato. The newly enacted Communications Act of 1995 brought a storm of protest throughout the Web in the form of blue ribbons and black backgrounds. Many see this law as a politically motivated attack on Constitutionally guaranteed rights to free speech under the guise of protecting children. It is a drastic solution, especially when there potentially are free alternatives for protecting children. PICS (Platform for Internet Content Selection), a standard formulated by the Web Consortium and presented at the conference, supports both a self rating system and a third-party rating system. It would give parents fine control over what their children can see, while still allowing them access to legitimate material. Surfwatch, another proposal, uses an up-to-date database subscription of adults-only sites to protect children. These alternatives might allow parents to limit what their children see without paying the price of outright censorship.</p><p><b>Java's star turn</b></p><p>Today's Web technology limits the communication between browsers and servers to insecure text and file transfers mediated by numerous, inefficient cgi-bin scripts. The most advanced programming technique on the Information Superhighway is to save some of the state of the interaction into the arguments of a perl script. Current form-based and image-map interfaces that use scripts cannot go beyond simple menu-based request-response interactions. The most popular browsing technique is to save as many pages as possible in bookmark lists (the Hansel and Gretel technique).</p><p>Java, the new programming language developed by Sun, which was by far the star of the conference, might surmount many of the Web's technical limitations. An object-oriented language designed specifically for the Web, Java incorporates unique properties such as built-in multimedia and database access, a security enforcement scheme, platform-independent runtime environments, and background garbage collection. </p><p>Java, already licensed by numerous companies, enables immediate browser extensibility. Currently, to extend a browser's functionality, users must install new software packages, a time-consuming process. Instead, a Java-aware browser, when faced with a new file format or transfer protocol, immediately downloads the appropriate Java source code (applet) and extends the browser to handle the new format. Web page designers thus have greater freedom to create new and improved "live" content. To promote Java as a standard for the Web, Sun gives Java software away for free. When asked about their business model, Sun's John Gage simply declared that "a rising tide raises all boats."</p><p>A new video-transfer protocol incorporated into the browser called Vosaic, or Video Mosaic, developed at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, offers one solution for efficiently transmitting continuous media on the Internet. Vosaic can incorporate one or more video widgets in a hypertext page. Associated with each widget is a buffer for receiving time-aligned frames of data. Communication between the browser and the server uses two continuous channels, an unreliable one for high-bandwidth audiovisual data and a reliable one for control. Adaptive algorithms balance the workload between server and client, automatically adjusting the frame rate and resending lost frames, taking into account network congestion and the available CPU power of the client and server. At the same time, Progressive Networks, based in Seattle, is delivering Real-Audio servers and browsers, which allow real-time broadcast of audio content on the Internet.</p><p>Images on the Web are often of poor quality, with resolutions and colors that don't match the client's capabilities. Christopher Dobbs described Kodak's steps to define a standard for Web images. Using their PhotoCD technology as a base, Kodak is developing some impressive standards, and has designed a version of Mosaic enabled with the new technology. While new multimedia formats are currently handled by different applications, a platform-independent programming language such as Java could allow future browsers and servers to immediately extend their functionality.</p><p>The current Web navigation paradigm is an inefficient, depth-first search of a very bushy tree, involving much backtracking. This is overwhelming to many browsers, and the relevant information is difficult to filter. Searches can be mediated by impressive keyword-based search engines such as Digital's very fast Alta Vista site, which updates its immense indices daily by mapping out every reachable page on the Web. The navigation could improve further if complex information were presented by more intuitive (perhaps 3D) visual interfaces or mediated by intelligent information-filtering software. The "Client-Side Techniques" session described some interesting new graphical-user interfaces for exploring the Web, including one proposed by Ayers and Stasko, which extends Mosaic with a graphical tree to display previously explored sites.</p><p><b>A revolutionary input device</b></p><p>Also at the conference, MIT's Victor Zue and Dave Goddeau advocated a more revolutionary and yet simple input device: speech. They demonstrated an experimental client-server system called Galaxy (see <i>IEEE Expert,</i> Oct. 1995, pp. 39-43). Its browser lets the user access selected information sources on the Internet, such as weather reports, airline timetables, and classified ads, simply by asking questions in plain English over the telephone or through a microphone attached to the computer. Galaxy delivers answers by hypertext as well as by synthesized speech, and the system helps the user narrow complex requests via simple dialogues.</p><p>In a popular talk, Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the Web, discussed current and future trends for the Web. He warned against building larger and more complex browsers that monopolize the Web. He also reminded his many listeners that the Web was originally developed to foster collaboration among researchers worldwide by enabling them to share text and graphics resources with hyperlinks.</p><p>In the wrap-up keynote address, International Data Group's Robert Metcalf predicted that the Web will collapse in 1996, access will become exceedingly slow, the present hype will fail to produce as expected, and people will reprint their business cards to remove their http addresses. Only time can judge the accuracy of these predictions, and there is not much of it! The next conference is scheduled for May 6-10 in Paris.</p><p><b>Michael <a name=McCandless>McCandless</a></b> is a graduate student in the Computer Science Department at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

<P>

Structures such as high-rise buildings, highway bridges, and subway stations are a vital part of our lives, but few people stop to think much about them. In fact, few of us give much thought to any of the infrastructure we have come to rely on so heavily to support our modern lives. It is not common these days to read about a structural collapse. Such collapses might occur during devastating earthquakes or ferocious hurricanes, but in most circumstances we expect large structures to be safe and remain functional over their lifetimes--even though the lifetime of a large structure usually exceeds the lifetime of its designers. In fact, many might not even know that the construction industry is the largest of all international industries, generating about 15% of the Gross National Product (GNP) of most countries. Only when structures fail, as in San Francisco in 1989 and Kobe in 1995, do we realize their importance to our society and its economy.
<P>

Structural infrastructure is prevalent and fundamental in our society; hence, you might be tempted to believe that designing, constructing, and maintaining structures is straightforward and simple. Not so. The design stage of large structures can consume years of effort. The person who begins a structural design project is usually not the one who completes it. Indeed, structural design, construction, and maintenance tasks are not trivial, especially since we never have enough knowledge about the behavior of structural systems and structural materials. We need to consider the complexity of each structural problem. For example, how do we select a structural form or shape to provide a desired structural behavior where many uncertainties in the loads, material strengths, and soil conditions influence behavior?
<P>

We hope that this special track will illustrate to you the difficult problems facing structural and construction engineers and the potential for AI to help them develop our vital structural infrastructure.
<p>
Designing a structure involves many iterations of several knowledge-intensive steps. The following tasks provide examples of such steps:
<P>
<ul>

<li>	Designers must determine the structure's functional requirements (for instance, how many people will use the structure and for what purpose?).
<P>

<li>Designers must understand the environment--the soil conditions, the seismic activity, and the wind loadings--where the structure will be built. Sometimes social and political factors are also important.
<P>

<li>Designers usually generate various alternatives for the structure, such as alternative structural configurations, component sizes, and material selections. They must predict behaviors such as stresses, deflections, and vibrations, as well as costs (for example, development and maintenance) under great uncertainty. Modeling these structures and making predictions about behavior and cost also requires a large amount of experience and knowledge.
<P>

<li>From these early predictions, designers develop more detailed designs of a few alternatives. Owners use these detailed designs to acquire bids from construction companies for building the structure.
<P>

<li>Construction companies use their expertise to predict how they will build the structure, what resources they will use, how much it will cost, and how long it will take to build it.
</ul>
<p>
During the construction process, construction managers constantly must respond to unexpected delays and changing economic conditions to remain on time and within the estimated budget. Often they must modify their detailed schedules and resource allocations to accomplish this.
<p>
Once built, owners must monitor the structure for signs of deterioration, maintain it when deterioration occurs, and modify it to accommodate new functions. Determining when and which structures are maintained with limited resources is a major issue for organizations and municipalities with a significant structural inventory.
<p>
Thus, structures are complex to design, and expensive to build and maintain. Moreover, they affect the lives of many people; a single structural failure has the potential to take lives. When creating computer-aided tools for assisting structural and construction engineers, we must consider several aspects of this domain. First, all knowledge needed to perform a given task is not easily acquired or represented. Second, structural engineers and construction companies have a strong professional and legal responsibility to society when creating the built environment, and they must be able to understand and make professional assessments of the knowledge used by their computer-aided engineering tools. Third, many structures are "one of a kind," but engineers can apply components and concepts in one design to other designs; hence, design case bases are extremely valuable. Fourth, structural life cycles are measured in decades or centuries. Finally, the context in which the structure must perform is never completely known; engineers and construction companies must manage uncertainty throughout the design and construction processes.
<p>
Some of the aforementioned design and construction knowledge cannot be modeled completely. This leads to a requirement for interactivity, where users provide the context-dependent interpretation of what is not modeled. Interactivity is not due to certain tasks being too hard for computational models. Rather, interactivity is necessary because the knowledge needed to complete certain structural engineering tasks cannot be modeled completely.
<p>
Some of the knowledge is standardized in codes of accepted practice. The profession acquires this knowledge over a period of time; changes to the codes usually occur after major catastrophic structural failures. Often, provisions of codes of practice become ambiguous during their development, as their authors strive for consensus.
<p>
A strong professional responsibility reinforced by local and national laws exists within this domain. Hence, engineers must understand and assess, using their own professional judgment, all information offered by computer-aided engineering tools. They are legally responsible for all decisions they make, with or without a computer. In our society, structural collapse is--and historically has been--unacceptable. Society has a very low tolerance for structural failure, as opposed to inferior product performance in other areas of engineering, such as indoor environmental controls. Therefore, all recommendations made by computer-aided engineering tools must be clear and understandable, and modifying their knowledge bases must be easy.
<p>
As already stated, structures are built over years and are used for tens or hundreds of years. Errors in design or construction are often expensive. Unfortunately, some structural engineering tasks occur under conditions of nearly complete uncertainty. For example, we can measure what lies below the ground surface only at points; a complete subsurface picture is always too expensive to acquire. In addition, structural loads and overload conditions are never known exactly; designers must estimate them on the basis of other experiences with the location and of the intended use of the structure. Nevertheless, each new major storm or earthquake can exceed those expectations. In any given structure, hundreds or thousands of people would be injured or killed in the event of structural collapse. This immense responsibility forces the construction industry to be conservative users of new technology. Changes take years--even generations--to occur.
<P>

In an industry where proven success is a requirement, few engineers latch onto fads. Fortunately, AI is coming out of the fad stage, and understanding of appropriate and effective uses of AI is increasing. The next 10 years should witness a tremendous increase in the applications of AI in this field. Because the contribution to the GNP is so large, the potential gain from using such technology is great. Imagine if computer technology could slice just one of those 15 percentage points off the GNP. This is not only possible; it is beginning to happen now. The reason the penetration of advanced computer applications in this field is low is that all these conditions contribute to what are very hard problems. We are just beginning to offer appropriate tools for such tasks. The articles in this special issue are representative of how engineers can effectively use AI in this field.
<P>

Six articles are part of this special track: three in this issue and three in the next. They describe applications of various AI techniques and methods to different stages of the engineering/construction/maintenance process. The three articles in this issue describe application of AI to design and modeling.
<P>

While great progress has been made in algorithms that analyze a structure, formal representations of the knowledge needed to model real structures and interpret the behavioral results derived from that model are lacking. The article by George Turkiyyah and Steven Fenves describes a knowledge-based framework that assists modeling and model interpretation tasks of structural engineering.
<P>

The design of a structure is actually the design of many interacting subsystems and components--for example, the structural system; the enclosure system; and the heating, ventilating, and air conditioning system. A given structure design is usually a unique combination of the possible forms for each of these component systems. Nevertheless, in some cases, engineers can benefit from component designs used in previous structures, and use them in subsequent designs as well. Making use of past design cases in the design of a new structure is the subject of the article by Mary Lou Maher, which discusses several incarnations of a case-based structural design system.
<P>

Due to a structure's complexity (as it consists of many interacting subsystems), its design involves many different disciplines. The article by Renate Fruchter discusses a computer-based collaborative design environment where the different participants in the conceptual structural design process can interact using a shared graphical description of the design.

<P>

The three articles in the next issue describe applications of AI in construction, condition monitoring, and maintenance-resource allocation. The article by Phillip Dunston, S. "Ranji" Ranjithan, and Leonhard Bernold describes the development and use of a neural network for predicting the amount of spring-back in a reinforcement bar. Engineers must account for this measure in setting the bending angle in a rebar bending machine. The article by Paolo Salvaneschi, Mauro Cadei, and Marco Lazzari describes four decision-support systems that they developed to help monitor dams and monuments and to assess the seismic risk of buildings. Finally, the article by John Kunz, Yan Jin, Raymond Levitt, Shouh-Dauh Lin, and Paul Teicholz describes a system they developed to help process-plant owners perform plant maintenance only as needed, rather than on a regular basis whether that maintenance is needed or not.
<P>

In presenting this special track of articles, we hope to show the breadth of applications of AI in the field of civil and structural engineering. These articles represent a small sample of the effort underway; many other exciting applications exist. From the applications we have included, it is easy to see that AI plays and will play a strong role in providing computer-aided support for this complex and challenging problem of design, delivery, and maintenance of structures.

What has been accomplished? This article surveys justhow broadly and deeply AI is affecting the industry today-andwhere it may have an impact in the future.<P>The experience of AT&amp;T is representative of most telecommunicationscompanies today: &quot;At one time, we promoted AI within AT&amp;T,&quot;explains Gregg Vesonder, technical banager of the Software DevelopmentTechnology Group. &quot;Towards the end of the 1980s we had achieveda fair amount of that. Now expert systems are very widely accepted-theyare one part of a checklist. When we start working on an application,we ask, 'What database should we use?' We also ask, 'What expertsystem should we use?' We often put one in.&quot;<P>Today, telecommunications networks are highly advanced, rapidlyevolving systems of complex, interdependent technologies. As telecommnetworks fuse with computer networks, and as the underlying technologiescontinue their rapid evolution, these networks will become increasinglydifficult to manage. AI is playing a large and growing role intelecommunications.<P><B>Network management</B><P>The largest number of deployed AI systems to date are expert systemsfor network management tasks. There are dozens of maintenanceand diagnosis systems deployed within AT&amp;T alone, accordingto Vesonder. Automated network management systems containing AImodules for problem diagnosis, repair and service dispatchingcapabilities are very widespread today. (See Table 1.) Besidesdiagnosis and repair, other AI techniques are beginning to emergesuch as case-based reasoning (CBR) and multi-agent systems. Someof these intelligent network management systems are being sold.AT&amp;T's ACE maintenance expert system, for example, was firstinstalled in Fort Worth, Texas, in the early 1980s. Today, ACEhas been sold and installed in more than 100 Regional Bell OperatingCompany (RBOC) sites in the US. GTE's Impact has been bundledinto commercially available network management software, and SingaporeTelecom is setting the wheels in motion to productize AutoCell.<P><I>Table 1.

Many of these are to support sales functions,while others are to support internal operations. (See Table 2.)US West, for instance, the RBOC serving much of the Southwest,Rocky Mountain, and Northwest US, has a half dozen internal helpdesks supporting internal PC and computer network users. Some100 internal help desk staff are supporting approximately 18,000end-users with this suite of help desks based on the CarnegieGroup's Test Bench troubleshooting shell. One of these applications,Predictor, helps maintenance administrators use a sophisticatedsoftware package that predicts and reports phone line problems.The system reduces the time required to solve the problem by 87.5%(from 2 hours to 15 minutes using the system), shortens the trainingcycle, reduces costs, and solves 80% of problems called in witha 25% increase in productivity.<P><I>Table 2.

AT&amp;T Bell Labs, for example,has developed a generalized intelligent product configurationplatform to process equipment orders. A Lab group began developinga configuration platform, Prose, in 1989. There are now a familyof 15 configurator applications using Prose to process ordersfor complex AT&amp;T equipment. Now, four Unix servers provideservice to 600 AT&amp;T users worldwide for configuring, pricing,and ordering those products. In 1995 alone they configured over$1 billion worth of AT&amp;T equipment. While AT&amp;T won't talkspecific benefits, the time from order to service has fallen dramatically;rework has been eliminated at three to five stages of the previousorder process; and there is consistency between the order, whatis shipped, and what is billed. Prose is a Unix-based platform.Four configurators built using a Windows-based version are justmoving into deployment.<P><B>AI in an RBOC</B><P>AI has been widely adopted by the RBOCs. US West, for example,has been active in AI since 1986. While the company was unwillingto go on record about the specifics of the approximately one dozenapplications their AI group of 20 has put into production, theydid talk in general terms. Their AI efforts are leveraged by theinvestment in the Carnegie Group (CGI) in the late 1980s. WhenPittsburgh's CGI dropped out of the expert systems tools market,they formed a consortium of major corporations to develop whatwas then the next-generation knowledge-based toolset, called Rock.In exchange for helping fund the effort, US West was activelyinvolved in the specification process, and could use the technology.This alliance was recently renewed.<P>Some of applications the group has worked on include:<UL><LI><B>Expert systems</B>: One such system, for example, resolvesdiscrepancies in 30,000 new service orders each week that haveflaws in the information such as an incorrect or uninterpretableaddress. There is enormous cost benefit from this data cleaningsystem, according to US West sources.<LI><B>Neural networks for proactive fault diagnosis</B>: Thegoal with this work, now in the prototype stage, is to move fromtraditional reactive fault diagnosis after a customer complains,to proactive diagnosis that predicts where faults are likely tooccur. This problem deals with analysis of complex patterns ofsignals that give information about a device's function; it iswell-suited to neural networks. The group started this applicationlast summer and has some promising preliminary results.<LI><B>Real-time activation of service:</B> The group is investigatingthe use of AI techniques to activate new services. The goal isto respond to customer's phone orders for new service in a matterof minutes, rather than days as is now the case.<LI><B>Strategic management consulting/business process reengineering:</B>Even before the term BPR became fashionable, AI applications havebeen either the cause or effect of a BPR effort, depending uponthe situation. Many knowledge-based system have resulted in streamliningprocesses, reducing staffing levels, and resulting in substantialcost savings-all goals of BPR. On the other hand, now that manycompanies are actively restructuring, AI systems are often onetool in this process. At US West, the AI group is being calledupon as the company goes through a major BPR effort.</UL><P>&quot;Ten years ago, someone in management thought AI soundedlike an attractive technology,&quot; explains Peter Eriggs, memberof US West's technical staff, in the Knowledge-Based Engineeringgroup. &quot;Now, we're getting involved in the bigger pictureat US West-looking at the deep cause-and-effect factors of thebusiness to understand them for purposes of change. We analyzepeople's mental models of the business from semi-isolated areasand build a bigger picture.&quot;<P><B>GTE's active AI group</B><P>The AI group at GTE Labs began in 1982 and is now part of theComputer and Intelligent Systems Lab where about half the staffof 50 work on AI systems. The group works in five distinct areas:network management, intelligent mobile support systems, networktraffic management, knowledge discovery and data mining, and researchin distributed AI. A number of systems have been put in productionand others are in the works.<P>In the network management area, the group has built several expertsystems. The first, Compass, was a stand-alone expert system fieldedin the late 1980s to diagnose faults and recommend repairs onan old, legacy switch that was facing retirement. &quot;It spannedthe gap at the tail end of that technology,&quot; explains RalphWorrrest, Principal member of the technical staff in the Computerand Intelligent Systems Lab. It was deployed on a Xerox Lisp machine,and lived a useful life until the last of these switches was retiredin the late 1980s.<P>Another system, SSCFI (pronounced <I>Scuffy</I>), receives customer-reportedtroubles for special services circuits-all those that are notplain home voice lines (such as data lines). It determines theappropriate circuit tests, conducts the tests, diagnoses problems,and makes dispatch decisions. Built from 1989-91, GTE began deploymentin GTE Florida in 1991 where it has been running continuouslyever since. By mid-1994 it was operating in every one of GTE'scompanies. The system uses Brightware's ART-IM, runs on RS 6000s,and performs about 40,000 diagnoses each year. SSCFI has evolvedfrom running initially in terminal emulation mode to a client-serverenvironment with direct computer-to-computer requests.<P>Eventually the vision is that other programs will be able to driveSSCFI. Field staff, for example, will be able to directly requestassistance from SSCFI in testing. In addition, customer supportrepresentatives will be able to log on directly to SSCFI and initiatetests. This will move more functionality to the front-line andtheoretically cut repair time. A prototype and early trials ofthis capability are expected for early 1996. The differences betweenthe early Compass system and SSCFI reflect the evolution of AIapplications in general-from the early stand-alone off-line toembedded on-line systems.<P>GTE's Intelligent Mobile Support Systems Group has built severalapplications to optimize services. One of the projects resultedin the Impact shell, which provides generic capabilities for makingsense of complex sets of alarms on hundreds of network elementsto pinpoint faults. This can be quite complex-for example, twoalarms may or may not be related, and the order of the alarmsis important. Faults cannot be judged based on the alarms, sothe system must perform network connectivity tests on the actualphysical elements. So far, Impact has been used for two differentlarge applications, and has been bundled into two network managementsoftware packages sold by GTE.<P>The mobile group has also built Perfex, which provides smooth,consistent cellular signals to customers on the move across thecountry. It tunes the very complex hardware switches and cellcites providing smooth hand-off between sites for customers onthe move. Perfex acts as an assistant to human controllers, andis deployed across all GTE cellular markets.<P>In 1987, the Lab staff envisioned a system for network trafficmanagement. The result is Nettrac, which receives network performancedata from groups of switches, recognizes and interprets anomalies,and plans and implements the solutions. &quot;The objective isto increase the quantity of information an individual networkmanager can take into account,&quot; explains Rich Brandau, aprincipal member of the lab's technical staff. &quot;When networkswere smaller, they could control individual switches. Now we haveto elevate it above individual switches. The system takes careof the details. If the manager can look beyond the details tothe big picture, that's important. In the future, as telecommsystems expand this will be even more important. &quot; The CBRcomponent of this system, which broadens the diagnostic capabilitiesof Nettrac, is now being tested and deployed.<P><B>Data mining and intelligent agents at GTE Labs</B><P>GTE Labs is one of the leading arenas for advanced knowledge discoveryand data mining. A small team has developed a generic KDD tool,Kefir (KEy FIndings Reporter), which summarizes changes in databasesand can be adapted to application-specific problems. The firstapplication using Kefir is Health-Kefir, which reviews healthcare service utilization for all of GTE's 100,000-plus employeesand their dependents. The system pinpoints areas where costs couldincrease over the next year, identifying those where specificmedical interventions could save the company money and improvethe health of employees and their families. The system can sliceand dice the data in various ways, considering multidimensionalsubcategories of data. Prior to Health-Kefir, an analyst wouldsift through small amounts of data searching for a few well-knowtrends. Health-Kefir, by contrast, does an exhaustive search ina fraction of the time and cost. Since 1994, it has searched anew terabyte of data every quarter. Plans are underway to productizethe system.<P>The Lab also has research underway in distributed AI for interoperabilityof heterogeneous distributed computer systems. They are investigatingcooperating intelligent agents for cooperative problem solving.To this end, GTE has a testbed attempting to resolve the problemof control between a customer's private network traffic managerand the public network manager.<P><B>Opening AT&amp;T Bell Lab's doors</B><P>AI activities are widely scattered at AT&amp;T. There is a SoftwareDevelopment Technology Group within the RBOC portion of the business,for instance, that includes AI in its toolkit along with object-orientedprogramming, Windows, and so on. &quot;We have fairly broad deploymentof expert systems within AT&amp;T,&quot; notes Gregg Vesonder,the group's technical manager. &quot;Dozens of maintenance anddiagnosis systems are in place, some in configuration and equipment,and to a lesser but growing extent, internal help desks usingexpert systems technology.&quot; One such diagnostic system, Autotestfor special service circuits testing, has been widely sold tothe RBOCs.<P>Ron Brachman, one of the most well-known names in the world ofAI knowledge representation research (for example, KL-ONE), joinedAT&amp;T Bell Labs in 1985. By 1994 the AI Principles Researchdepartment, headed by Brachman, had grown to 18, and he was promotedto the director of Software and Systems Research at Bell Labs.Among his contributions was directing the design team that builtthe Classic description logic system. Classic has been used tobuild 20 internal applications. It allows engineers to defineterms used in a domain, and then automatically organizes theminto a generalized taxonomy, enforcing implied constraints, andautomatically recognizing when objects are instances of the terms.It can also serve as an integrity checking engine and active inferenceengine.<P>The AI Principles Research group is responsible for a number ofsystems at AT&amp;T. Among them is the configuration platformcalled Prose, described earlier, which is based upon Classic.The group has also used Classic to develop Imacs (InteractiveMarket Analysis and Classification System) for data mining. Thistool is a generic system that can be applied to different problemareas. Information Manifold is a Classic-based research systemdesigned to help users find information on the World Wide Web.There are now plans in the group for building a more robust systemwith possibilities for integrating this technology with some AT&amp;Tservices.<P>Research is also underway in the AI Principles Group in SoftwareAgents for Agent-Amplified Communication. Researchers have developedan agent-based framework to automate person-to-person e-mail forinformation gathering. Today, such searches are performed by areferral chain. For example, I may be looking for someone withexpertise in intelligent agent research in the telecomm industry,.I e-mail several people I know conducting IA research at universities,who refer me to several people in AT&amp;T. Such referral searchescan have many layers. The group has built a prototype system thatis being tested within this research center.<P>Bell Labs has other groups doing AI research. The Adaptive SystemsResearch Department of about 15 has been investigating machinelearning for about a decade. Its most successful work is in characterrecognition for a new generation of automatic teller machinesthat are just beginning to be installed. Other machine-learningapplications include tools for predicting sales in retail chainstores allowing more accurate inventory management, predictionof impending failures of T3 communication lines allowing preventivemaintenance, and predictions of customer response to direct mailoffers. The Human-Computer Interface Research Department is workingon IA messaging applications, development of electronic communities,voice response systems, and assigning intonational variation intext-to-speech systems.<P><B>Where's AI headed in telecomm?</B><P>The future vision of our homes and offices does not include atelephone, but rather a computer loaded with capabilities suchas speech recognition, natural-language translators, schedulers,and so on. The computer will be hooked to a wireless intelligentnetwork that will make it possible to send and receive voice,fax, data, and images. These intelligent networks will self-diagnose,engage in distributed cooperative problem-solving, and performproactive network management. We will all have instant accessto information through intelligent agents that can navigate heterogeneousdata sources, finding and presenting the information we need,participate in electronic commerce, and provide call managementservices and voice response systems, to name a few. From all indications,AI will play an important enabling role in the communicationsnetwork of the future.<P>&quot;AI is a niche technology,&quot; according to AT&amp;T'sVesonder. &quot;It won't be a domineering technology like databases,object-oriented programming or the World Wide Web.

<h3>Expert Systems and the Web</h3>
<h2>Expert Systems as Knowledge Servers</h2>


<b>Henrik Eriksson, Link&ouml;ping University</b>
<p>

<I>Wide-area networks and the internet-based World Wide Web allow
developers to provide intelligent knowledge servers. Expert systems
running on servers can support a large group of users who communicate
with the system over the network. In this approach, user interfaces
based on Web protocols provide access to the knowledge servers. Users
do not need special hardware or software to consult these services
with appropriate Web browsers.</I> <P>

Providing expert advice to a large group of end users has proved
surprisingly difficult. In the eighties, many researchers and
practitioners predicted that expert-system technology would lead to
the development of many small and medium-sized <i>advisory systems</i> that
could help many categories of novice users in performing expert-level
tasks. Although technical progress in the last decade has been
satisfactory, the number of widespread expert systems in use is
disappointing. Because they circumvent the usability problem, embedded
expert systems, however, tend to be more successful than advisory
systems. (<a href = "#1">1</a>) The design of truly usable advisory
systems has proved more difficult than initially expected.  <P>

A major problem in making expertise readily available is that,
compared to other applications such as word processors, users
typically run advisory systems infrequently. This usage pattern stems
from the relatively few critical cases users cannot handle
normally. Therefore, developers must design advisory systems for
infrequent operation. In this context, program distribution is a
serious problem for many types of expert systems. Because most
knowledge bases must be updated regularly, users must upgrade their
software frequently. When expert systems require access to large
databases, the volumes of data to be updated can be significant. The
effort required to keep system installation current can overwhelm
developers and users.  <P>

The widespread use of the Internet and World Wide Web provides an
opportunity for making expert systems widely available. (<a href =
"#2">2</a>) By implementing expert systems as <i>knowledge servers</i> that
perform their tasks remotely, developers can publish expertise on the
Web. Technologies and infrastructures that make this approach feasible
are emerging. Simultaneously, interest in artificial intelligence
support for network navigation services is growing. Several research
groups are working on <i>intelligent agents</i> that help users find
information and perform other tasks on large networks. (<a href =
"#3">3</a>) We can view these agents as expert systems that
incorporate knowledge on how to find appropriate network services.
<P>

To make knowledge servers available, developers must distribute the
<i>software front ends</i> that allow users to communicate with the
servers. The Web supports the Common Gateway Interface, which can
provide form-based front ends to databases, and to expert systems with
simple user interfaces. Currently, developers are experimenting with
CGI-based programs for various services. This approach, however, does
not allow user interaction beyond form filling and the use of Web
documents as program output.  <P>

Sun Microsystems' Java programming language, conversely, provides a
powerful basis for implementing user interfaces to knowledge servers:
(<a href = "#4">4</a>), (<a href = "#5">5</a>) Developers can include
programs written in Java in HyperText Markup Language (HTML)
documents; Web browsers can download these programs over the Internet
and run them locally. Java programs can then act as user interfaces to
expert systems by opening network connections to knowledge
servers. This article will show how developers can design and
implement such systems, and will describe a prototype implementation
of an expert system with a Java-based user interface.  <P>

<b>Delivering expertise</b>
<P>

Improving the usability of expert systems and making them available to
end users can be difficult. When users perform tasks infrequently, the
time and effort required to install and maintain a current version of
the program is unsatisfactory compared to the relative benefit of the
program. Such infrequency of operation forms a common pattern in the
use of expert systems, so the relative benefit of the system is often
questionable. Figure 1 illustrates the relationship between the
frequency of use and the installation, training, and maintenance cost
per use. Reducing such costs for rarely used programs is advantageous.
<P>

<img src="x300141.gif"><br>
<p>
Figure 1. The relationship between the relative maintenance cost for
the user and use frequency. Users may not find it cost-effective to
use advisory systems for rare tasks.  <P>

There are several approaches to the problem of expert-system
distribution. Let us examine three major system categories that apply
different approaches to the distribution problem.  <P>

<i>Self-contained advisory systems</i>. These expert systems require complete
program installation and maintenance. Self-contained systems need not
necessarily be stand-alone. While they can naturally communicate with
other systems such as databases, such communication tends to increase
the installation problem. Successful self-contained systems must
provide extremely valuable advice to offset the development and
delivery costs. Wine selection and automobile troubleshooting are
often cited as examples of everyday tasks that may require expert
advice. Indeed, expert systems that provide such advice are available
(free of charge as programming examples), but are used
rarely. Developing a sophisticated wine-advisor program, for example,
is feasible. But it is much more difficult to make the product viable
commercially, because it takes too much effort for the user merely to
install the system. (A few commercial wine advisors exist, such as
Micro Wine Companion published by the Lifestyle Software Group. The
primary purpose of the Micro Wine Companion, however, is to allow
users to create and search databases of their wine cellars. In this
case, the expert system is a small part of the overall software
product.)  <P>

<i>Systems that support rare but difficult tasks</i>. Sometimes tasks
performed infrequently can be sufficiently complex and time-consuming
to warrant costly advisory systems. Tax-advisory systems exemplify
expert systems that assist users in a difficult task they must perform
infrequently. Users must upgrade computer-based tax advisors annually,
which means that most users must upgrade each time they use the
system. Although the cost for each run is relatively high compared to
the use of a word processor, the user can still save considerable time
and effort, because these systems provide powerful support for
time-consuming tasks.  <P>

<i>Embedded expert systems</i>. One approach to reducing the effort required
to install a program is to bundle it with other
software. Consequently, developers bundle certain expert systems with
conventional software. This approach simplifies program distribution,
but developers must synchronize the upgrades with the upgrades of the
main program. The use of a single installation program for both the
main program and the expert system simplifies the installation process
for the user. Examples of such bundled expert systems are grammar
checkers packaged with word processors.  <P>


Besides these distribution approaches, some conventional system
architectures separate the user-interface front end and the program
component. Such <i>two-component architectures</i> are common for many types
of software. Graphical front ends to services, such as those to
commercial on-line and billboard services, can provide graphical user
interfaces to command-line systems that are difficult to use. The
front-end programs, however, are service-specific, so users cannot
readily use them for other services. In the Java approach, the process
of downloading programs from Web servers for execution is automatic
and transparent to the user.  <P>

The <i>client-server approach</i> is similar to the front-end
approach. Client-server architectures that provide client
user-interface front ends to servers are relatively common. An example
of this type of architecture would be front ends to databases. Until
recently, however, developers have custom-built user-interface clients
for each type of server. The Java approach allows developers to create
public front ends to servers such as databases that users can
capitalize on immediately. (See the "Java applets" <a href =
"#sidebar">sidebar</a> for details.)  <P>

<H3>Client-server architecture</H3> <P>

Dividing an integrated expert system into a two-component architecture
with a narrow communication channel is difficult. Let us examine some
of the design considerations for such systems. Figure 2 illustrates
the knowledge-server approach with a user-interface front end. For
networks such as the Internet, we can expect the data transfer rates
to vary widely. Because of the finite (and unpredictable)
communication bandwidth, we must minimize the communication between
the user-interface front end and the knowledge server, to ensure an
acceptable response time for the end user.  <P>

<img src="x300142.gif"><br>
<p>
Figure 2. A two-component architecture that separates the user
interface from the problem solver.  <P>

To provide rapid response, the front end must perform computationally
intensive user-interface operations, such as mouse
dragging. Naturally, users could eliminate the server completely and
perform all computations in the front end. However, there is a
trade-off between front-end functionality and size. The load time for
sophisticated and large front ends can be unacceptable with slow
network connections. However, local caching on proxy servers can
improve average download performance. Simultaneously, applications
that take advantage of large knowledge bases and databases can avoid
the distribution of large data sets by storing the data on the
knowledge server. In this situation, developers can reduce the network
communication by designing a relatively small front end.  <P>

Besides dividing the architecture into two parts, the developer must
select an appropriate communication protocol for the network
connection. For instance, if the system uses a character pipeline such
as a TCP/IP stream, the developer must use character encoding for any
high-level data (attribute-value pairs and objects, for example) that
are to be communicated. Naturally, creating application-specific
protocols for each system is possible. However, a systematic approach
to protocol design has several advantages over informal approaches and
ad hoc protocols. General protocols that developers can reuse in
several applications save implementation and test time.  <P>

If the user-interface front end and the knowledge server are
object-oriented, protocols that support shared objects can be
useful. Object communication models, such as the Common Object Request
Broker Architecture (Corba), can be used as a standard protocol. (<a
href = "#6">6</a>) Moreover, for user interfaces it is often better to
use approaches that support remote procedure and method calls, such as
to implement callbacks.  <P>

When developers design new systems, it is relatively easy to
incorporate client-server approaches in the system architecture from
the beginning. However, the process of dividing preexisting systems
that have integrated user interfaces into two-component systems is
challenging. For certain systems, such reengineering can be highly
time-consuming. Nevertheless, most preexisting systems separate
user-interface and reasoning components sufficiently.  <P>

<H3>Simulation of a nuclear power plant</H3>
<P>

Let us examine a straightforward system that uses a Java program as a
front end to an expert system implemented as a knowledge server. We
use this system to illustrate the knowledge-server approach and to
provide a platform for teaching undergraduates expert-system
technology. This knowledge server provides a (very rough) simulation
of a nuclear power plant. The power plant consists of three major
components: the <i>reactor, turbine</i>, and <i>condenser</i>. There are also three
<i>pumps, four valves</i>, and one </i>turbine. Water boils in the reactor,
generating steam to run the turbine. Downstream from the turbine, the
condenser cools the steam. (In turn, external cooling water cools the
condenser.) Cooling pumps transport the condenser water back to the
reactor tank.  <P>

The simulator calculates values for reactor-tank pressure,
condenser-tank pressure, water levels, and so on, and displays them
graphically. When components fail, the simulator calculates and
displays the effect on the running power-plant system. For instance,
if a cooling pump fails and the corresponding valve is not closed,
water may flow backwards from the reactor tank to the condenser
tank. This process will then drain the reactor tank and expose the
reactor core.  <P>

Originally, teachers at Link&ouml;ping University designed the
simulator as a demonstration system and as the basis for a programming
assignment in undergraduate courses on artificial intelligence and
expert systems. They implemented the original version (in the
mid-eighties) in the expert system shell Epitool and in Interlisp-D,
which ran on Xerox Lisp machines. The reimplementation of the system
as a knowledge server (in Clips, the C Language Integrated Production
System (<a href = "#7">7</a>)) with a Java front end has several
advantages over the original version. Two of the most important are
that it runs on standard hardware and is publicly available. Moreover,
because Java programs are portable, Web browsers on multiple platforms
run the simulator. (Currently, there are Java-compatible browsers for
the Solaris, Windows 95/NT, and Macintosh platforms. Additional ports
are pending.)  <P>

Let us examine the user-interface front end. Figure 3 shows a sample
applet window from the nuclear-power-plant simulator. Users invoke
simulation sequences by clicking on the sequence buttons. Sequences 1
through 3 start the simulation and introduce a component failure after
a certain time. The button labeled "random" starts random failure
sequences. When a simulation sequence is running, users can control
valves, pumps, and moderator rods by clicking on them. The user
interface graphically displays steam pressure, water levels, and the
component states. Figure 4 illustrates the system architecture and the
communication between the front end and the knowledge server.
<P>

Figure 3. The nuclear power plant. This
applet simulates the dynamics of a nuclear power plant, and displays
the (simulated) state of the process graphically. The applet animates
the process changes, such as changed water levels in the reactor and
condenser tanks.  <P>


<img src="x300144.gif"><br> Figure 4. The architecture of the sample
knowledge server. The Java-based front end (left) communicates with
the knowledge server (right) through a TCP/IP stream. The knowledge
server, which is Clips-based, uses a Java module for communication
with the front end.  <P>

Java applets allow us to design user interfaces that are more
interactive than CGI-based interfaces. For instance, we used Java to
animate the bubbles in the reactor and condenser tanks (Figure 5a),
and rotating pumps (Figure 5b). Because Java supports mouse-tracking
callbacks, we could enhance the user interface by allowing the user to
mouse-drag the moderator rods (Figure 5c).  <P>

<img src="x300145.gif"><br>

<p>

bubbles; (b) rotating pumps; and (c) dragging of moderator rods.  <P>

The simulator and knowledge server are primarily teaching tools. The
purpose of the current assignment is to teach students basic skills in
rule-based programming and allow them to experiment with the
knowledge-server approach to implementing expert systems. When the
students have learned to control the nuclear power plant and to avoid
reactor-core meltdown as a result of component failure, they can
continue with the design of a small knowledge base that performs this
task automatically. Thus, the students' task is to augment the
preexisting simulator with safety rules that control and stabilize the
nuclear power plant when components fail. Figure 6 shows a sample
Clips rule that takes appropriate actions in case of turbine failure.
<p>
<code><pre>
(defrule R1 
	"Take appropriate actions if the turbine blows up" 
	(object (is-a turbine) 
		      (blown TRUE)) 
	=> 
	(send [valve1] close) 
	(send [valve2] open) 
	(send [reactor] put-moderatorPercent 100) 
	(send [pump1] put-rpm 0) 
	(send [valve3] close)
)
</code></pre>
<p>
Figure 6. Rule that controls the nuclear power plant in the case of
turbine failure. The precondition of the rule checks for blown
turbines, and the conclusion closes Valves 1 and 3, opens Valve 2,
sets the moderator rods to 100%, and turns off Pump 1.  <P>

To test the safety rules, users can start several simulation sequences
where components of the power plant fail (by clicking on the sequence
buttons--see Figure 3). In Sequence 1, the turbine fails, and the state
of the power plant changes accordingly. (The precondition of rule R1
in Figure 3 matches this situation.) In Sequences 2 and 3,
cooling-water pump 1 and the external-cooling water pump fail. The
randomize button invokes a sequence where two random components
fail--for instance, as when the turbine fails and then a few seconds
later a cooling pump fails.  <P>

In addition to the simulator knowledge server and its applet
user-interface front end, there is a demonstration applet available
publicly at <a href=http://www.ida.liu.se/~her/npp/demo.html> http://www.ida.liu.se/~her/npp/demo.html</a>. (Use a Web
browser that supports Java technology, such as HotJava or Netscape
2.0.) The demonstration applet is self-contained in that it includes a
Java-based simulator (without safety rules), and runs stand-alone
without a knowledge server.  <P>

<H3>Discussion</H3>
The major advantages of the knowledge-server approach are:
<P>

<li><I>Public expert systems.</I> Knowledge servers allow developers to
provide public expert systems. For example, such systems can off-load
help desks. Moreover, individuals using personal computers can run
expert systems that would normally require expensive or nonstandard
hardware. For example, one of the reasons early medical expert systems
had difficulties gaining physician acceptance was that doctors did not
have access to the hardware and software required to run the systems
at that time.  <P>

<li><I>Simplified program distribution.</I> The knowledge-server approach
also greatly simplifies program distribution. Although program
transmission over low-bandwidth network connections can be
time-consuming, browsers and proxy servers can cache programs
locally. By keeping the bulk of the programs as well as the data and
knowledge bases required for problem solving on the knowledge server,
we can restrict the network traffic to the communication required for
the user interface.  <P>

<li><I>Multiplatform support.</I> Because Web browsers exist for most
platforms, programs such as applets transferred over networks for
local execution in browsers must run on multiple platforms. In the
Java approach, the developer uses the Java compiler to produce
machine-independent byte code from the Java source code. Java browsers
then use an emulator that implements a virtual machine for the byte
code. This approach allows developers to create platform-independent
services.  <P>

Although these advantages are compelling, there are also several
disadvantages in the knowledge-server approach. In certain situations,
the approach is inappropriate. The principal disadvantages are: <P>

<li><I>Lack of network connection and server availability.</I>
Architectures based on client-server technology require up-and-running
servers and a network connection to the servers. Although servers and
networks are usually fairly reliable and often have more than 99%
availability, we cannot trust them completely for critical
applications. Nevertheless, installing mirror sites for knowledge
servers can increase server robustness and availability. Establishing
sufficient network connection for mobile computing is also
difficult. In some locations, wireless links do not work, and, in
certain situations, authorities regulate the use of wireless links
such as radio links while traveling on airplanes.<p>

<li><I>Security concerns.</I> Security can be a major concern in many
applications. Given the openness of the Web and Internet, guaranteeing
security in terms of privacy in consultations and protection against
unauthorized use can be problematic. Encrypted communication and user
passwords can increase the level of security. Also, Java includes
certain security functions intended to restrict unwanted operations in
Java programs, such as malicious behavior. In public expert systems,
of course, security in terms of <i>unauthorized use</i> is less
important. (<a href = "#8">8</a>) Furthermore, public expert systems
raise the question of consultation privacy on the part of the
knowledge server. Users may worry that servers log their consultations
and take advantage of this information for purposes other than problem
solving. Unfortunately, unauthorized use of user data by the server
operator can be difficult to control. Ultimately, users must trust the
server operators' reputation for discretion.  <P>

<li><I>Difficult to charge for services.</I> Currently, there is no
established and universal mechanism for charging users for services on
the Internet. Again, the knowledge-server approach works best for free
and public expert systems. Besides improved customer service and
reduced help-desk costs, server operators can use, for example,
advertisements as a source of revenue for such systems.  <P>

Along with these disadvantages, certain technical issues are currently
open to question. To facilitate implementing expert-system servers and
the corresponding front ends, we need better integration between
established expert-system technology and Java-based browser
clients. For instance, <i>shared objects</i> between the expert-system server
and its front end could simplify the design and implementation of such
systems. An alternate approach to client-server architectures is to
perform problem solving in the browser client. Naturally, developers
can use Java as an implementation language for expert systems. Because
Java does not support rule-based programming, it can be inappropriate
for the implementation of expert systems. Also, the size of typical
knowledge bases can make running expert systems in browser clients
impractical.  <P>

Applets may not require a special programming language. It is
questionable whether we need a language such as Java to implement
programs that run locally in Web browsers. Although Java has the
advantage of being much cleaner than C++, alternate languages for
applet implementation are conceivable. SmallTalk, for instance, is a
potential alternative to Java, because it is object-oriented and
because many SmallTalk systems are based on byte-code emulation. An
alternative to using Sun's Java compiler might be to retarget a
preexisting compiler for another programming language to produce the
appropriate applet byte code. In principle, we could retarget
expert-system shells and AI languages for execution in Java-compatible
browsers using this approach. The Java Expert System Shell (Jess) is a
Java-based inference engine developed by Ernest Friedman-Hill at
Sandia National Laboratories. Jess supports a subset of Clips. The
Jess applet reads a Clips source file and runs it locally in the Web
browser.  <P>


CURRENTLY, THERE ARE FEW widely available expert systems that a
significant user community uses. Although developers can implement
broad-market and public advisory systems technically, the usability of
such systems is questionable. Because such advisory systems are used
infrequently, it can take too much effort for users to acquire and
install the system on their computers. The use of network-based
knowledge servers with user-interface front ends can reduce these
obstacles significantly.  <P>

Just as Web servers provide information to the Internet community,
knowledge servers can assist users in performing complex
tasks. Corporations, government agencies, and other organizations can
extend their Web services with public advisory systems that perform a
significant subset of the tasks handled currently by manual help
desks. Developers can integrate these intelligent services with
preexisting Web services, and, in the Java approach, users can take
advantage of the Web browser for conventional browsing, as well as
interaction with knowledge servers. Researchers can use the
knowledge-server approach to make results and research prototypes
publicly available. The scientific community then can run and examine
the programs quickly. Our experiments with prototype architectures for
knowledge servers illustrate how developers can build such systems.
<P>

In the short and medium term, knowledge servers are a viable
architecture for expert systems. The use of Java-based front ends to
knowledge servers allows developers to create public advisory systems
in ways that were not possible a few years ago. Our experiments show
that available Java technology is a solid foundation for such front
ends. These technologies enable expert-system developers to create new
and innovative systems that can perform new tasks for new groups of
users. We believe that the network technologies now emerging will
redefine the role of expert systems. In the long term, however, to
create a solid foundation for the next generation of knowledge
servers, we need more research on approaches to knowledge servers and
to the integration of network and expert-system technology.  <P>

Java is an object-oriented programming language that allows developers
to create programs that can be transported over networks, and can be
run in special Web browsers. Compiled Java programs are portable,
because the compiler produces machine-independent <i>byte code</i> (similar
to Pascal p-code), which an emulator in the run-time system
interprets. Although the run-time performance of Java programs is
poorer than for programming languages such as C and C++, the emulation
speed is acceptable for most applications. (To improve performance, it
is possible to design a run-time system that can translate this byte
code dynamically to native machine instructions.)  <P>

The Java language syntax resembles that of C++, and many programming
constructs in these languages have similar semantics. Nevertheless,
there are certain significant semantic differences between Java and
C++. For instance, Java has built-in memory management and garbage
collection, and supports multithreaded programming. However, Java does
not support pointers. Analogous to C, C++, and SmallTalk, Java offers
standard library packages that contain classes and appropriate methods
for mathematics, input and output, network communication, graphics,
and so on. The object-oriented organization of these packages makes
them easy to use.  <P>

An <i>applet</i> is a small Java application program that is suitable for
execution in Java-compatible browsers. HTML documents can refer to
applets just as they refer to images and sounds. Web browsers that
incorporate Java technology recognize <i>applet tags</i> in HTML documents,
and assign an area of the document displayed to the applet (just as
they display images in documents). The browser then invokes the applet
(see Figure A). Java-based user interfaces are more flexible than
their CGI-based counterparts, because applets are Turing complete and
can perform complex computations rather than just submit information
from forms to the Web server (as in the CGI approach). CGI-based
programs can generate restricted graphic output by rendering images,
which can serve as image-map active regions. Java programs, however,
can implement callbacks that respond to user-interface events such as
typing, mouse clicking, and mouse dragging.  <P>

<p>
Because downloaded applets can behave maliciously and can include
viruses, worms, and so on, browsers must restrict applet
operations. Sun's HotJava browser applies several levels of security
to code transferred over the network. It checks the incoming byte code
for inconsistencies, and it asks the user before allowing applets to
perform certain high-level operations, such as input or output. Thus,
the user can allow (by setting browser preferences, or by manually
confirming access requests from the emulator) applets to read and
write, and to open network connections to processes on other machines
such as server processes.  <P>

Passino and &Uuml;mit &Ouml;zg&uuml;ner, Ohio State University</b></p><p><a name=return>The</a> Special Track on Intelligent Control beginning in this issue of <i>IEEE Expert</i> spans topics in intelligent control that range from control architectures, hierarchies, and distribution to learning, expert systems, neural networks, fuzzy systems, and genetic algorithms. As the <a href=#sidebar>sidebar</a> shows, the applications that our selection of articles cover include several robotic problems, automated highway systems, submarine control, space-based process control, and medical drug-delivery control. We hope that you enjoy reading these articles and find them useful in identifying new tools to solve challenging technological problems.</p><p><b>Intelligent control</b></p><p><i>Control</i> is the act of affecting a dynamic system to accomplish a desired behavior. In developing <i>control design theory</i> over recent decades, control engineers have used well-defined system goals to produce many effective techniques for implementing a wide range of system controllers. The newly coined term <i>intelligent control</i> refers both to the control design approach or philosophy and to implementation techniques that emulate certain characteristics of intelligent biological systems.</p><p>Intelligent control as a discipline owes much to both computer science and computer technology. For instance, engineers use software development and validation tools for expert systems to construct <i>expert controllers</i> that automate the actions of a human operator controlling a process. Other knowledge-based systems such as fuzzy systems (rule-based systems that use fuzzy logic for knowledge representation and inference) and planning systems (which emulate human planning activities) find similar use in automating the perceptual, cognitive (deductive and inductive), and action-taking characteristics of humans who perform industrial control tasks.</p><p>Artificial neural networks crudely emulate biological neural networks. For instance, they have been used to learn how to control systems by observing the way that a human performs a control task. Alternatively, neural networks can learn in an on-line fashion how to best control a system by taking control actions, rating the quality of the responses achieved when these actions are used, and then improving system response by adjusting the recipe used for generating control actions. </p><p>Developers use genetic algorithms to evolve controllers via off-line computer-aided design of control systems or on-line by maintaining a population of controllers and using survival-of-the-fittest principles--<i>fittest</i> being defined by the quality of the controller's response. In addition to software development tools, several computer chips are available for fuzzy, genetic, and neural systems that provide efficient parallel implementation of complex reasoning processes in real time. </p><p>All these approaches fall into the realm of intelligent control. In each, both the biological background and the effect of computer science and computing technology drive developments of the field of control by providing alternative strategies for the functionality and implementation of controllers for dynamical systems. In fact, the control field is moving toward integrating the functions of intelligent systems, such as those just listed, with conventional control systems to form highly autonomous systems that can independently perform complex control tasks--such as for robotics and vehicular applications. This trend toward intelligent autonomous control systems is gaining momentum as control engineers solve many existing problems and naturally seek new control problems that involve broader issues and require the full capabilities of available computing technologies.</p><p>The development of such sophisticated controllers does, however, still fit within the conventional engineering methodology for constructing control systems. This development involves mathematical modeling using basic principles or data from the system, along with heuristics. Some intelligent control strategies rely more on the use of heuristics (such as direct fuzzy and expert control). Others use mathematical models in the same way they are used in conventional control. Still others use a combination of mathematical models and heuristics. </p><p>Needed now are systematic controller construction methodologies that apply to a wide class of applications. Some methodologies for constructing intelligent controllers are quite ad hoc--such as for the fuzzy or expert controller. Still, they are often effective because they provide a method and formalism for incorporating and representing the nonlinearities needed for high-performance control. Other methodologies--such as for certain neural and adaptive fuzzy controllers--are no more ad hoc than ones for conventional control.</p><p>To help verify the performance of the control system being implemented, control engineers still need analysis of stability, controllability, and observability properties. Although we have seen significant progress recently in stability analysis of fuzzy, neural, and expert control systems, much more work is needed in nonlinear analysis of intelligent control systems. Simulations and experimental evaluations of intelligent control systems are needed to validate performance levels. Also needed are engineering cost-benefit analyses involving the evaluation of competing control techniques, performance, stability, ease-of-design, lead-time to implementation, complexity of implementation, cost, and other issues. Ultimately, the careful evaluation of intelligent control approaches will help attenuate the hype that sometimes surrounds them and lead to the best-possible engineering solution.</p><p>Although the intelligent control paradigm typically focuses on biologically-motivated approaches, it is not clear that the resulting controllers behave drastically differently--they are not mystical; they are simply nonlinear, often adaptive controllers. This is, however, not surprising, because every new intelligent control approach seems to have a precursor in an existing conventional control approach (see Table 1). While some new concepts grow from the field of intelligent control, a crucial role certainly remains in evaluating and developing the emerging field of intelligent control for the control engineer and control scientist with the standard control background.</p><table border=1 cellpadding=5><caption>Table 1.

While still relatively young, intelligent control methods have found various applications in robotics, manufacturing, automotive systems, underwater vehicles, ships, spacecraft, aircraft, process control, engine control, missiles, weapon control, automated highway systems, and elsewhere. All these areas, of course, have reliably used conventional control techniques for many years. </p><p>The important question is then, what, if any, will be the niche of intelligent control? What applications is it good for, and not good for? Will intelligent control simply provide some techniques to add to the standard control engineering toolbox? Or will intelligent control provide a whole new philosophy for approaching the design and control of large complex dynamical systems? This Special Track should help answer these questions.</p><p><b>The Special Track on Intelligent Control</b></p><p><a name=return2>As</a> the variety of topics we have just discussed demonstrates, intelligent control is quite diverse and wide-ranging. Traditionally, the fields of control, artificial intelligence, and operations research have made major contributions. Many other fields, cutting across a variety of disciplines, are also involved--electrical engineering, computer science, mechanical engineering, chemical engineering, aeronautical engineering, industrial engineering, mathematics, psychology, and so on. The wide variety of relevant topics and viewpoints makes it somewhat difficult even to define the boundaries of the field and agree on the essential ingredients of what we mean by intelligent control.

Ralph has performed well underextensive tests, including a coast-to-coast, 2,850-mile drive</i> </p><p><font SIZE=+3>N</font>early 15,000 people die each year in the US insingle-vehicle roadway-departure crashes.<a href="#ref1">[1]</a> Theseaccidents often stem from driver inattention or impairment (for example,fatigued or intoxicated drivers). A system could eliminate many of thesecrashes if it warned drivers when their vehicle was departing the roadwayand controlled the vehicle's lateral position to keep it in its lane. Nearly70% of such crashes occur in rural or suburban settings on undivided, two-laneroads.<a href="#ref1">[1]</a> Because these roads will most likely notbe upgraded in the foreseeable future, a crash-prevention system must relyon the existing road structure. </p><p>In this article, we describe Ralph (Rapidly Adapting Lateral PositionHandler), a vision system developed jointly by Carnegie Mellon Universityand AssistWare Technology Inc. Ralph decomposes vehicle steering into threesteps: sampling the image, determining the road curvature, and assessingthe lateral offset of the vehicle relative to the lane center. Ralph combinesthe outputs of the latter two steps into a steering command, which it cansend to the steering motor on our Navlab 5 testbed vehicle (see Figure1) for autonomous steering control.<a href="#ref2">[2]</a> As a road-departurewarning system, Ralph can also compare this command with the human driver'ssteering direction. </p><p><a href="x20171.gif"><img src="x20171z.gif" border=2 height=61 width=150></a><br>Figure 1. The Navlab 5 testbed vehicle: (a) exterior; (b) interior.</p><p><b>Other steering systems </b></p><p>Research on other steering systems has focused on machine-vision techniquesthat detect particular features in video images of the road in front ofthe vehicle and determine the desired vehicle trajectory on the basis ofthe relative positions of these features. Many of these systems track specificfeatures, such as lane markings, from one image to the next.<a href="#ref3">[3-6]</a>Others detect regions of the image that represents the road on the basisof features such as color<a href="#ref7">[7,8]</a> or texture.<a href="#ref9">[9]</a>Nevertheless, all of these systems share one characteristic: They havea detailed, a priori model of the road's appearance, and they locate specificfeatures via hand-programmed detection algorithms. Unfortunately, roadsare not always cooperative. Road markings vary dramatically, dependingon the type of road and the state or country where the road is located.For example, many California freeways embed regularly spaced reflectors-notpainted markings-to delineate lane boundaries. Further challenges arisefrom the environmental context, which can greatly affect road appearance.The road's appearance often varies dramatically because of changes in illuminationdue to shadows, glare, or darkness and because of obstructions by othervehicles, rain, snow, salt, or other objects. These variations often invalidatethe assumptions underlying vision algorithms, leading to poor road-detectionperformance. </p><p>Alternative approaches combine machine-vision and machine-learning techniquesfor enhanced systems capable of handling variations in road appearance.<a href="#ref4">[4,10,11]</a>One such system, Alvinn (which we've developed), uses an artificial neuralnetwork to learn the characteristic features of particular roads underspecific conditions. Alvinn uses this learned road model to determine howto steer the vehicle to keep it in its lane. </p><p>Although systems of this type have been quite successful at handlinga wide variety of road types under many different conditions, they haveseveral shortcomings. First, the process of adapting to a new road requiresa relatively extended &quot;retraining&quot; period (at least several minutes).While this adaptation process is relatively quick by machine-learning standards,it is unquestionably too long in domain-like autonomous driving, wherethe vehicle may be traveling at nearly 30 meters per second. Second, theretraining process invariably requires human intervention of one form oranother. These systems employ a supervised learning technique such as backpropagation, where the driver must physically demonstrate the correct steeringbehavior for the system to learn. </p><p>A truly flexible system should exploit whatever features are availableto determine vehicle location, adapt almost instantly when the availablefeatures change, and perform this adaptation without human supervision.Ralph demonstrates these characteristics. </p><p><b>Ralph's sensor configuration </b></p><p>Figure 2a depicts a typical scene of the road ahead, as imaged by avideo camera mounted next to the rearview mirror on Navlab 5. Ralph canuse either black-and-white or color images via a color-based contrast-enhancementtechnique.<a href="#ref10">[10]</a> Obviously, many parts of this imageare not relevant to the driving task (for example, the parts depictingthe sky or showing the vehicle dashboard). Ralph eliminates these parts,and processes only the portions of the scene inside the red trapezoid.Although the lower and upper boundaries of this trapezoid vary with vehiclevelocity (moving further ahead of the vehicle, toward the top of the image,as vehicle speed increases), they are typically about 20 and 70 metersahead of the vehicle, respectively. </p><p><a href="x20172.gif"><img src="x20172z.gif" border=2 height=75 width=150></a><br>Figure 2. (a) Forward-looking image; (b) Ralph's sampling strategy.</p><p>The second, and perhaps more important, aspect of the trapezoid's shapeis its horizontal extent. It is configured so that its width on the groundplane is identical at each row of the image. The horizontal distance thateach row of the trapezoid encompasses is approximately 7 meters, abouttwice the width of a typical lane. The trapezoid is selectively sampledaccording to the strategy depicted in Figure 2b. This sampling processcreates a low-resolution (30x32 pixels) image where important featuressuch as lane markings (which converge toward the top of the original image)appear parallel. This image resampling is a simple geometric transformationand requires no explicit feature detection. </p><p><b>Curvature calculation.</b> The parallelization of road features iscrucial for the second step of Ralph processing: curvature determination.To determine the curvature of the road ahead, Ralph hypothesizes a possiblecurvature, subtracts it from the parallelized low-resolution image, andtests to see how well the hypothesized curvature has &quot;straightened&quot;the image. </p><p>Figure 3 depicts the process Ralph uses to determine curvature. In thisexample, Ralph has hypothesized five curvatures for the original image.In each curvature, Ralph has differentially shifted the image's rows to&quot;undo&quot; the curve and straighten out the image features. For left-curvehypotheses Ralph shifts rows toward the right, and for right-curve hypothesesit shifts rows toward the left. For the more extreme hypothesized curvatures(on the far left and right), Ralph shifts the rows of the original imagefurther than for the less extreme curvatures (in the middle). For all hypothesizedcurvatures, Ralph shifts rows near the top of the image (correspondingto regions on the ground plane further ahead of the vehicle) further horizontallythan rows near the bottom of the image. This differential shifting compensatesfor the road's greater displacement at the top of the image (far aheadof the vehicle) than at the bottom. The exact shift distance for each rowin the transformed images depends on both the geometry of the camera andthe particular curvature hypothesis being tested. </p><p><a href="x20173.gif"><img src="x20173z.gif" border=2 height=65 width=150></a><br>Figure 3. Ralph's curvature hypotheses. </p><p>In Figure 3, the second curvature hypothesis from the right (correspondingto a shallow right turn) yields a transformed image with the straightestfeatures and is, therefore, the &quot;winning&quot; hypothesis. Figure4 illustrates how Ralph scores the straightness of each hypothesis. Afterdifferentially shifting the rows of the image according to a particularhypothesis, Ralph vertically sums the columns of the resulting transformedimage to create a scan-line intensity profile (shown in the two curvesat the bottom of Figure 4). When the visible image features are correctlystraightened, sharp discontinuities between adjacent columns occur in theimage (right scan-line intensity profile in the figure). In contrast, whenthe hypothesized curvature has shifted the image features too much or toolittle, there are smooth transitions between adjacent columns of the scan-lineintensity profile (left profile in the figure). By summing the maximumabsolute differences between intensities of adjacent columns in the scan-lineintensity profile, Ralph can quantify this property to determine the curvaturehypothesis that best straightens the image features. </p><p><a href="x20174.gif"><img src="x20174z.gif" border=2 height=85 width=150></a><br>Figure 4. Ralph's curvature scoring technique. </p><p>An important attribute of this technique for determining road curvatureis that it is entirely independent of the particular features present inthe image. As long as visible features run parallel to the road, this techniqueexploits them to determine road curvature. Those features need not be atany particular position relative to the road, and they need not have distinctboundaries (characteristics required by systems that use detailed a prioriroad models and edge detection). </p><p><b>Lateral offset calculation.</b> Next, Ralph determines the vehicle'slateral position relative to the lane center. It uses a template-matchingapproach on the scan-line intensity profile generated in the curvatureestimation step. The scan-line intensity profile is a one-dimensional representationof the road's appearance as seen from the vehicle's current lateral position.By comparing this current appearance with the appearance of a templatecreated when the vehicle was centered in the lane, Ralph can estimate thevehicle's current lateral offset. </p><p>Figure 5 illustrates this lateral-offset estimation procedure in moredetail. The current scan-line intensity profile is on the left, and thetemplate scan-line intensity profile (generated when the vehicle was centeredin the lane) is on the right. By iteratively shifting the current profileto the left and right, the system can determine the shift required to maximizethe match between the two profiles (as measured by the correlation betweenthe two curves). The shift distance required to achieve the best matchis proportional to the vehicle's current lateral offset. </p><p><a href="x20175.gif"><img src="x20175z.gif" border=2 height=33 width=150></a><br>Figure 5. Ralph's technique for determining lateral offset. </p><p>As with curvature determination, this process does not require thatany particular features be present in the image. As long as the visiblefeatures produce a distinct scan-line intensity profile, the correlation-basedmatching procedure can determine the vehicle's lateral offset. In particular,even features without distinct edges, such as pavement discoloration dueto tire wear or oil spots, generate identifiable profile variations thatRalph can exploit to determine lateral offset. This is a performance featurethat edge-based road detection systems do not share. </p><p><b>Adaptation to changing conditions.</b> Another important featureof Ralph stems from the simplicity of its scan-line intensity profile representationof road appearance. For Ralph to handle a new road type, only the 32-elementtemplate profile vector need be modified, and this is extremely easy. Inthe current Ralph implementation, there are four ways to adapt the templateto changing conditions. </p><p>In the first method, the driver centers the vehicle in its lane andpresses a button to indicate that Ralph should create a new template. Inunder 100 milliseconds, Ralph performs the processing steps described aboveto create a scan-line intensity profile for the current road, and thensaves it as the template. From that point on, Ralph can either activelycontrol the steering wheel (the driver lets go of the wheel) or warn thedriver of road-departure danger (the driver continues to steer manually),using the newly created template to determine the vehicle's position relativeto the lane center. (In another warning mode, the driver continues steeringmanually; but instead of merely warning the driver when the vehicle startsto drift off the road, Ralph can give a momentary nudge to the steeringwheel to bring the vehicle back into the lane.) </p><p>In the second method, Ralph selects the template from a library of storedtemplates recorded previously on various roads. Ralph selects the besttemplate for the current conditions by testing several of these previouslyrecorded templates to determine which has the highest correlation withthe scan-line intensity profile created for the current image. </p><p>The third method of template modification occurs after an appropriatetemplate has been selected. During operation, Ralph slowly evolves thecurrent template by adding a small percentage of the current profile tothe existing template. This lets the current template adapt to gradualchanges in the road's appearance, such as those caused by changes in thesun's angle. </p><p>Ralph handles more abrupt scene changes, such as changes in lane-markerconfiguration, via the final and most interesting template-modificationstrategy. In this technique, Ralph uses the appearance of the road justahead of the vehicle (the foreground) to determine the vehicle's currentlateral offset and the curvature of the road ahead. At the same time, Ralphis constantly creating a new <i>rapidly adapting template</i> based onthe appearance of the road far ahead (typically 70 to 100 meters) of thevehicle. Ralph creates this rapidly adapting template by processing thetop rows of the image, far ahead of the vehicle, in the same manner asdescribed previously. Ralph assumes that the road's curvature between theforeground and the background is nearly constant, so it can project wherethe road will be and, hence, what the new template should look like whenthe vehicle is centered in its lane. </p><p>In places where the road's appearance changes dramatically, such asthe entrance to a tunnel or an on-ramp to a highway, Ralph uses this techniqueto quickly create a template appropriate for the new road appearance. Whenthe vehicle actually reaches the new road, Ralph determines that the templateit was previously using is no longer appropriate, because it does not matchthe scan-line intensity profile of the current image. It therefore swapsin the rapidly adapting template and continues driving. This rapid adaptationoccurs in about 2 seconds without any human intervention. </p><p><b>Ralph's performance </b></p><p>We have conducted extensive laboratory, test-track, and on-road experimentswith the Ralph system as part of a program by the National Highway TrafficSafety Administration (NHTSA) to assess roadway-departure collision-avoidancesystems.<a href="#ref12">[12]</a> The results indicate that Ralph can accuratelyestimate a vehicle's lateral position on the road along with the curvatureof the road ahead, under a wide variety of conditions. </p><p><b>Laboratory tests.</b> An important factor in determining autonomousdriving effectiveness is the sensing system's accuracy. The crucial accuracymetric for Ralph is how well it can estimate the location of the road aheadof the vehicle, because road location determines the direction in whichto steer the vehicle. </p><p>To quantify Ralph's capability to accurately determine the positionof the road ahead, we conducted controlled laboratory tests to accuratelymeasure the road's actual location. To facilitate these measurements, wecollected high-quality video sequences of road scenes, using a Umatic 3/4-inchVCR. We gathered these scenes with the Navlab 5 test vehicle, using thesame camera mounted in the same location (next to the rearview mirror)as in the on-vehicle experiments (described later). These sequences includedboth day and night operation as well as images of various road types, includingrural roads and multilane divided highways. The test road sequences recordedon videotape were all between 4 and 9 miles long. While recording the sequences,the driver repeatedly changed the vehicle's lateral position within thelane to obtain a wide range of images. </p><p>After replaying the video sequences in the laboratory, we used Ralphto track the road. More specifically, Ralph combined its estimates of thevehicle's lateral offset and the curvature of the road ahead into an estimateof the lane-center location at 1 second (about 25 meters) ahead of thevehicle. </p><p>In real time, we compared Ralph's lane-center position estimate withthe estimate that the experimenter provided manually. The experimentercontinuously indicated his estimate of the lane-center location, usinga computer mouse to keep a crosshair centered over the right-lane markingat 1 second ahead of the vehicle in the image. </p><p>Table 1 summarizes the results of these tests. For each condition tested,the table shows the mean and standard deviation of the difference betweenRalph's and the experimenter's estimate of the lane-center position. Ingeneral, Ralph's performance was quite good in all the conditions tested,with a total mean disagreement between Ralph and the experimenter of 13.2cm-just slightly larger than the width of a typical lane-edge marker.</p><p><b>Table 1.

Figure 6 shows one suchsituation, depicting a daytime highway scene where the lane markers areclearly visible. Under these conditions, the mean disagreement betweenRalph and the experimenter was 11.4 cm. The variance of the disagreementwas 14.3 cm. However, we can attribute a substantial portion of the disagreementto inconsistency in the experimenter's estimate of the lane-center position.Using a mouse to accurately indicate the lane position 20 meters aheadis difficult. In fact, in a series of repeatability tests, we determinedthat the experimenter's estimate of lane position over two different trialson the same section of videotape varied by an average of 7.3 cm. </p><p><a href="x20176.gif"><img src="x20176z.gif" border=2 height=124 width=150></a><br>Figure 6. Ralph processing a daytime highway image. </p><p>On the same stretch of highway, under conditions of heavy shadows (seeFigure 7a), the mean and standard deviation of Ralph's lane-position estimationerror increased to 13.8 cm and 18.9 cm, respectively. These error increaseswere due primarily to the camera's limited dynamic range, which causedthe shadowed regions of the image to be black and the areas in the sunlightto be saturated. </p><p><a href="x20177.gif"><img src="x20177z.gif" border=2 height=132 width=150></a><br>Figure 7. Ralph processing (a) a daytime highway image with heavy shadows;(b) a nighttime highway image; (c) a daytime rural-road image; (d) an early-morning,rural-road image with glare off the road. </p><p>Ralph's estimation of lane location on the same stretch of highway atnight improved slightly. As Figure 7b shows, the lane markers were verydistinct in this situation, resulting in a mean error of 11.1 cm and astandard deviation of 13.8 cm. </p><p>Ralph's performance on rural roads such as the one in Figure 7c wasfairly similar to the highway results. The mean and standard deviationunder favorable daytime conditions did increase slightly over the correspondingfigures for favorable daytime highway images, to 13.7 cm and 16.2 cm, respectively.Two factors were primarily responsible for these increases. First, hillson the rural roads changed the perspective of the camera relative to theroad. This resulted in slight additional errors in lane-position estimation,particularly at grade transition points. Second, several cross streetsintersected the section of rural road tested, which occasionally resultedin momentary inaccuracy when the lane markers disappeared. Nevertheless,the error increases due to these effects were small, on the order of 2cm. </p><p>One problem with lane-tracking systems that rely exclusively on lanemarkers to locate the road ahead is that they sometimes have difficultywhen glare off the pavement makes the markers hard to find. This type ofglare typically occurs when the pavement is wet or the sun is low on thehorizon. To quantify how these conditions affect Ralph, we collected avideo sequence on the same rural road during the early morning hours headinginto the rising sun. Figure 7d presents a sample image from this sequence.As expected, the mean and standard deviation of Ralph's error increasedto 15.8 cm and 17.2 cm. However these increases were slight, again in therange of 2 cm. Ralph still accurately located the road ahead by adaptingits processing to exploit the boundary between the bright pavement andthe dark shoulder. This capability to adapt to changing conditions provedparticularly valuable in the on-road tests. </p><p>In summary, the laboratory tests indicate that under various conditions,Ralph can localize the position of the road ahead of the vehicle to approximatelywithin the width of a single lane marker. To further characterize Ralph'scapability to perform repeatedly and reliably, we also performed extensivetest-track and on-road experiments. </p><p><b>Test-track experiments.</b> We conducted additional controlled experimentson a road segment outside of Pittsburgh that is often used for testing.These tests involved repeatedly driving on the same stretch of roadwayat different speeds, with no other vehicles around. </p><p>In the videotape experiments presented above, the goal was to quantifyRalph's capability to project the position of the road ahead by combiningits estimate of the vehicle's lateral position and its estimate of theroad's curvature. In the first set of test-track experiments, the goalwas to tease apart this combination and measure Ralph's capability to estimatethe curvature. In this experiment, we manually drove the Navlab 5 testvehicle through the S-curve shown in Figure 8a. </p><p><a href="x20178.gif"><img src="x20178z.gif" border=2 height=34 width=150></a><br>Figure 8. Experiment to assess Ralph's effectiveness in estimatingcurvature: (a) S-curve used for testing Ralph; (b) Ralph's curvature estimateon two traversals through the S-curve. </p><p>Careful measurement of the first curve indicated an average radius ofcurvature of approximately 343 meters. Figure 8b shows Ralph's estimateof the road curvature during two traversals of the entire S-curve at 55mph. </p><p>Note the consistency in the curvature estimate between the two traversals.Ralph's mean estimate for radius of curvature during the first traversalof the first curve was 373 meters, and the mean for the second traversalwas 374 meters. Not only are the two estimates extremely close, but theycorrespond quite closely with the measured radius of 343 meters. Moreover,we can at least partially attribute the 30-meter discrepancy between themeasured curve radius and Ralph's estimate to uncertainty in the manualcurvature measurement. </p><p>The next set of experiments tested whether Ralph could detect anomalousdriver behavior. This information is valuable not for autonomous driving,but rather for determining Ralph's applicability as a tool for preventingroadway departure crashes. Again, the driver drove twice through the S-curveat 55 mph. The first time, the driver concentrated on accurate driving.The second time, the driver was momentarily distracted by an in-cab distractortask, which required the driver to glance toward the back of the vehiclefor up to two seconds. The goal was to determine if the lane-tracking outputthat Ralph produces could detect the lane deviations resulting from thismomentary inattention. </p><p>Figure 9 graphs Ralph's estimate of the vehicle's lateral position,both during normal driving and while the driver performed the distractortask. As the graph indicates, the relatively large magnitude of the lanedeviations resulting from momentary distraction are clearly discerniblecompared with the driver's normal lane deviations. This characteristicis extremely useful when using Ralph as a roadway-departure warning system.</p><p><a href="x20179.gif"><img src="x20179z.gif" border=2 height=79 width=150></a><br>Figure 9. Lane deviations in normal driving and when the driver isdistracted. </p><p>The results of these test-track experiments indicate that Ralph canrepeatedly detect both the curvature of the road ahead and excessive lanedeviation by the driver. However these experiments neglected two importantaspects of the autonomous driving task. First, in the test-track experiments,Ralph was passively monitoring the vehicle's position on the roadway andthe curvature of the road ahead. These tests did not assess Ralph's capabilityto combine those measurements into a command for the steering wheel thatwould keep the vehicle centered in its lane. Moreover, we conducted theseexperiments under favorable weather and lighting conditions. </p><p><b>Open road tests.</b> One of the most significant potential drawbacksof driving systems that rely on video cameras for sensor input is theirsusceptibility to adverse conditions. Systems that rely on visible featuresto determine the vehicle's position on the road can have trouble when thesedistinctions become difficult to detect because of adverse weather, poorlighting, or degraded pavement. To quantify this effect, we conducted aseries of on-road tests of the Ralph system. </p><p>The culmination of these experiments was a 2,850-mile drive from Washington,D.C., to San Diego, in which we used Ralph's steering commands to controlthe Navlab 5 testbed vehicle. Except for a few detours, the trip exclusivelyinvolved highway driving. The trip included many of the difficulties typicallyencountered during normal driving: driving at night, during sunset whenthe sun is low on the horizon, during rain storms, on poorly marked roads,and through construction areas. </p><p>During the trip, we collected statistics on Ralph's driving performance.The primary metric was the percent of the total trip distance for whichRalph was controlling the steering wheel. To measure this value, we assumedthat if the steering wheel position disagreed significantly from Ralph'scommanded position, the safety driver had taken control of the wheel. Specifically,when the steering direction suggested by Ralph differed from the actualsteering wheel position such that following Ralph's steering arc at thecurrent speed would result in a difference in lateral acceleration of 0.04g (where 1 g = 9.8 meters/second<sup>2</sup>) or greater, then we judgedthat the safety driver had overridden Ralph. </p><p>Overall, the results were quite encouraging. Using the above metric,Ralph was able to steer the vehicle autonomously for 98.1 percent (2,796/2,850miles) of the trip. Because the system adapts to changing conditions, Ralphwas able to drive in situations that would be difficult for other lane-keepingsystems, particularly those that rely on finding distinct lane markers.Figures 10 and 11 illustrate some of the different situations that Ralphhandled. </p><p><a href="x201710.gif"><img src="x201710z.gif" border=2 height=64 width=150></a><br>Figure 10. (a) Road with severely worn markings; (b) unpaved road.</p><p><a href="x201711.gif"><img src="x201711z.gif" border=2 height=64 width=150></a><br>Figure 11. Challenging images from city driving. </p><p>Some of the roads were just as you might expect for a major highway:nice pavement and good lane markings. Even when the lane markers were missing,Ralph continued driving by exploiting the boundary between the pavementand the off-road area. However, stretches of road without lane markersproved quite difficult at night, when the edge formed by the pavement boundarywas no longer visible. In particular, on the third night of the trip, a10-mile stretch of new, unpainted highway accounted for a significant portionof the 1.9% of the distance that Ralph couldn't drive. </p><p>Rain proved to be less of a problem. Even when the specular reflectionoff the wet pavement obscured the lane markings, Ralph keyed off other,more subtle variations in the road's appearance to determine how it shouldsteer. These additional features typically formed from water pooling inruts on the road and by the tires of vehicles ahead leaving tracks on thewet pavement. </p><p>West of the Rocky Mountains, there were stretches of very poor roads,two of which are shown in Figure 10. Often the lane markers were nearlyinvisible because of wear (Figure 10a). And there were several long stretchesof construction where the road was composed of very fine, packed gravel,without any lane markings (Figure 10b). During these stretches, Ralph continueddriving by exploiting the differences in appearance between the packedand loose gravel. </p><p>The freeways in California posed an interesting challenge. Instead ofhaving painted markings to delineate lanes, they have reflectors that arenearly invisible during the day. In these situations, Ralph followed thediffuse discoloration from the oil spot down the center of the lane. Ralphalso performed well on the Interstate-15 High Occupancy Vehicle (carpool)lane into San Diego, which has no visible lane markings but a strong boundarybetween the cement road surface and the asphalt shoulder. </p><p>The situation that most challenged the system was in city traffic, whenthe road markings were either missing or obscured by other vehicles (seeFigure 11). In such cases, Ralph was often able to lock onto the vehicleahead and steer to follow it. In fact, Ralph used this technique to followtwo trucks around nearly the entire Denver beltway. In the rare situationswhen Ralph became truly confused, it typically recognized that it couldnot correctly steer and signaled to the safety driver to take control.</p><p><b>Conclusion</b> </p><p>Extensive tests of the Ralph vision-based lane-position estimation systemindicate that it can accurately detect a vehicle's position and orientationrelative to the roadway in a wide variety of situations and can use thisinformation to steer our testbed vehicle. Current work on Ralph focuseson minimizing those few remaining conditions that are difficult for Ralph.To help Ralph overcome those difficulties, we are exploring techniquessuch as active camera control to focus the system's attention on importantaspects of the scene. In addition, work is under way to develop techniquesthat will let Ralph reliably determine error bounds as it estimates thelocation of the road ahead. </p><p>The simplicity of the Ralph algorithm suggests that a custom hardwareimplementation is feasible. This has the potential to dramatically reduceboth the size and cost of subsequent versions of Ralph. Our eventual goalis to build a system that is small enough to fit behind the rearview mirrorand inexpensive enough to sell as an option on passenger cars. Initially,such a system would simply warn the driver when he is drifting off theroad. But, in time, a system might assume at least partial control, relievingthe driver of the monotonous task of steering-just as standard cruise controlhas done for maintaining vehicle speed. </p><p><b>References </b></p><p><a name="ref1"></a>1.

 The Terrain Analyzer is the planner's  only source of information
where terrain is concerned and thus the planner  uses the TA quite
extensively during the planning process. The TA is responsible for
route planning, finding tactical positions, computing Line of Sight
and answering questions about terrain features. The interface between
the TA and the planner is established by four types of calls;
Route_Request, Define_Tactical_Position, Line_Of_Sightand 
Terrain_Feature.

<P>
From Figure <A HREF=subsection3_3_1.html#demo>2</A>, we observe that any friendly units traveling on
route 4 is likely to engage in combat with the enemy unit stationed
at (45000, 46250). The friendly unit may not be totally destroyed but
considerable amount of strength may be lost during combat and therefore
will result in a lower score. Thus, any plan that includes route 4
will have lower scores compared to other plans. The evaluation scores produced
by the mission planner for the demonstration mission are listed
below in the order of decreasing scores.
<P>
For the NO_SPLITsubtree: (Note that routes 1 and 2 are not considered 
since they end at Support_By_Firepositions.)
<P>
<PRE><TT>
Route 3 -&gt; 6 : 128.0
Route 5 -&gt; 8 : 128.0
Route 4 -&gt; 7 : 89.8068</TT></PRE>
<P>
For the SPLIT subtree with platoon combination AC,B: (Note for route 
combination 3,1 it means platoons A and C travel on route 3 and 
platoon B travels on route 1.)
<P>
<PRE><TT>
Route 3,1 -&gt; 6,- : 158.000000
Route 3,2 -&gt; 6,- : 158.000000
Route 5,1 -&gt; 8,- : 158.000000
Route 5,2 -&gt; 8,- : 158.000000
Route 3,4 -&gt; 6,7 : 152.525711
Route 3,5 -&gt; 6,8 : 144.205093
Route 4,5 -&gt; 7,8 : 116.941719
Route 4,1 -&gt; 7,- : 112.500000
Route 4,2 -&gt; 7,- : 112.500000</TT></PRE>
<P>
The planner chooses the plan with the highest score and, in the case 
above, any one of the 
four highest score plans can be chosen. A good approach is to 
choose plans at random in such cases to display unpredictable behavior.

<P>
Since simulation-based planning is a fairly new concept, we need to perform 
more in-depth studies through various experiments to analyze the methodology 
thoroughly. For the experiment, we propose to incorporate 
simulation-based planning into Soar. The Soar architecture provides a 
stratified approach to specifying, designing, and building Knowledge-Based 
systems. The system is first described at the knowledge-level, then at the 
problem-space level the system is defined in terms of how the task is 
computationally accomplished, and finally at the implementation level. 
It supports metalevel reasoning which allows the system to recursively 
reason about problems.  Soar also integrates multiple problem-solving 
methods and knowledge sources. Soar is well known in the military 
simulation field through the Soar/IFOR project <A HREF=bibliography3_9.html#rose1>[10]</A> where Soar 
is being used to generate the behavior of an automated agent for the 
Tactical Air Simulation. No extensive mission planning is involved in 
the project; the goal is to simulate the behavior of a single pilot. 
A recent attempt by the Soar group to solve the planning problem 
produced a methodology called Multi-method planning. Realizing that 
no one fixed method can solve a wide range of problems, they proposed 
the use of different methods for different problems. 
We further extend the idea of using different methods by 
employing simulation-based models within the Soar planning 
framework. Instead of using rule-based models to simulate and 
evaluate different candidate plans, we will use models 
to simulate and evaluate.
<P>
We will build two planning systems; one that employs the 
simulation-based models and one that is entirely rule-based.
Then, we will compare the results through several problem domains. 
First, we will experiment with classical AI problems such as the 
blocks world problem and the machine shop scheduling problem. 
We will then experiment with the mission planning problem.
The comparison criteria between the two systems are 
(in no particular order):1) Speed - number of plans generated per unit time.
2) Success - the rate of success of plans. 3) Model complexity - how easy 
is it to design, 
build and comprehend the system model? 4) Maintenance - extensibility and 
modifiability. 5) Reactiveness - ability to react during or after the 
planning process. 6) Adaptability - ability to adapt planning to dynamic 
changes of the environment during planning.
<P>
In order for the experiment to be valid, we must maintain several 
variables such as 1) Knowledge: the set of knowledge 
that is used in both the 
planners must come from the same source, 2) Data: the data provided 
to the planner such as Terrain Analysis data must be the same, 
and 3) Evaluation function: the same objective function must be used to 
choose the best plan.
 By successfully maintaining the 3 variables as above, 
we can ensure the validity of the experiments-allowing us to observe 
the strong and weak points of the systems.

<P>
Figure  <A HREF=section3_3.html#arch>1</A> displays the architecture of our planner in relation
to the Institute for Simulation and Training (IST) Computer Generated Forces
(CGF) Testbed  <A HREF=bibliography3_9.html#clark>[7]</A>. Our mission planner is an integral part 
of a larger project of the IST called ``Intelligent Autonomous Behavior 
by Semi-Automated Forces in Distributed Interactive Simulation&quot; which is 
funded by the U.S. Army Simulation Training and Instrumentation Command 
(STRICOM). The goal of the planner is to
automatically derive plans for a semi-automated force or CGF, at the company
level initially, so that the force will provide an Army trainee with
an effective training experience. Planning is only a small part of
the overall project, which includes efficient line of site (LOS)
determination, terrain reasoning, intelligent target acquisition and
behavior representation for CGF entities. The planner takes orders
from the battalion level and translates these orders, with a tight
coupling with the terrain analyzer, into efficient plans for the CGF
platoon entities. In addition to planning for its subordinate units,
the planner must also  also be able to monitor the execution of the plan,
react to unexpected situations and replan if necessary.
<P>
Each commander in the IST testbed is
simulated by a Command Entity (CE) whose major functions are 
performed by the Planner.  The planner has two phases:
the Reactive phase and the Planning phase. A Phase is a group of states
that collectively display a behavior. Only one phase is active at any
given time. The starting phase is the Reactive Behavior. 
Based on the inputs, the current active phase makes the decision
as to which phase becomes active next.
There is no single `main' algorithm that controls
the whole process. Thus, the decision is  made in a distributive manner.
We will describe each component of the planner through a demonstration 
scenario illustrated in figure <A HREF=subsection3_3_1.html#demo>2</A>.
The friendly company unit 1 (the company entity receiving the Oporder)
is situated at Assembly Area(AA) located at (50000, 52500).
Company unit 1 is made up of 3 platoons: platoon A is made up of 4
M1 Abrams Main Battle Tanks and each of the remaining 2 platoons B and C are
made up of 4 Bradley Infantry Fighting Vehicles.
There are two enemy platoons: platoon A is made up of 4 M1 tanks
located at (32500, 28750) and platoon B is made up of 4 M2 fighting
vehicles located at (45000, 46250). The Operation order given to
company unit 1 is to ``SEIZE the Objective at (32500, 28750)&quot;.
The company unit boundaries are given as the rectangular area drawn
in the figure.
The goal of the command entity is to accomplish
the mission with minimal loss of strength.

<P>
The Planning Behavior module generates orders for its subordinate 
entities from an Oporder given by a higher level
entity. This module is made up of the following smaller modules where
the order in which they are presented actually coincides with the algorithm
steps of a typical planning process.
<P>
<OL><LI> <b>Sitrep/Oporder Analyzer</b> parses the Situation Report(Sitrep) or 
the Operation Order(Oporder) to update the World DB. In the case of an Oporder, 
it is further parsed to generate a list of task(s) to be
achieved. The Situation Analyzer is called next with this list.
In the case of a Sitrep, it is analyzed to decide if any immediate
action is required, if any replanning is required, or if any Sitrep
needs to be generated. Then, the Execution Monitor is called with the
decision.
<P>
<LI> <b>Situation Analyzer(SA)</b> uses a set of rules to
  analyze the given situation using the World DB and performs a set 
  of alternate calls of Route_Requestand Define_Tactical_Positionproducing a number of alternate routes.
<P>
<LI> <b>Course of Action(COA) Tree Generator</b>, using the set of
  alternate routes produced by the SA, generates a COA
  Tree where the 1st level contains alternative subunit or platoon 
  combinations and 2nd level contains alternative route combinations.
  The following levels can contain other alternatives such as
  varying the role of platoons in different formations.
<P>
Figure <A HREF=subsubsection3_3_1_3.html#coa1>3</A> shows the COA tree generated by the prototype.
The SPLIT subtree describes the course of action for a company where
the company  will be split up. Given that a company has 3 platoons,
the number of routes needed is at most 3. 
If two platoons go one route
and one platoon go another, two routes are needed in total. If each platoon
goes on a different route, three different routes will be necessary.
The 1st level of this subtree will contain all the possible
combinations of splitting a 3 platoon company. The heuristic used in 
this scenario is not to allow Platoon
A to travel alone at any time since M1s are considerably slower and
lower power than M2s. This restricts the SPLIT combination
to 4 sets: (AC,B) (B,AC) (C,AB) (AB,C).
From these combinations, the Create_COA_TREEgenerates
possible combinations of route sets. Since the mission is SEIZE,
at least one route should lead the platoons to an ASSAULT_POS.
These routes are 3,4,5 according to figure <A HREF=subsection3_3_1.html#demo>2</A>.
Thus, the possible set of route combinations are (3,1), (3,2), (4,1)
(4,2), (5,1), (5,2), (3,4), (3,5), (4,5).
The second level of route combinations in the COA tree contains
the routes that connect each of the 1st level routes to OBJ if possible.
For example, route 6 extends route 3 to OBJ.
However, route 1 is not extended to the objective because it's a
SUPPORT_BY_FIREposition.
The NO_SPLITsubtree has a single subunit combination
(ABC) since no split up is allowed
in the unit combination. Therefore only a single route set alternatives that
lead to an assault positions (3,4,5) are possible. The second level routes are
(6,7,8) respectively.
No pruning is being done in the current implementation but heuristics 
can be used for pruning when necessary.
Next, the COA Tree Simulator is called with the COA Tree.

<P>
<LI> <b>The COA Tree Simulator</b> takes each level of the COA 
subtree and simulates each route and calculates a score for each
friendly platoon per each route. 
This is done by creating a Simulated World
(SIMDB) and performing the simulation of friendly and enemy units by time 
slicing between actions (move, look, fire) and observation by each unit. 
In the current version, the enemy
unit is simulated in a very limited manner. The enemy unit is assumed
to remain stationary and only engage in combat when an opposing force
unit has been sighted. The model that is used is the Aggregate Combat 
Model <A HREF=bibliography3_9.html#davis>[2]</A>.
An alternative  method is to allow the
enemy units to have the same planning capabilities as the friendly units
but with different tactics. This method would be quite realistic,
but it can be quite time consuming. 
If computing capabilities are limited, we can perform simulation at different
levels of abstraction  <A HREF=bibliography3_9.html#tomacs2>[4]</A><A HREF=bibliography3_9.html#lee>[8]</A> where each higher level will use less
computational power. 
The actual simulation algorithm is as follows:
<i><P><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_25163_tabbing88.xbm"><P>
</i>
In low mobility areas or areas with a steep
terrain gradient, the movement is slower. Also, for some
terrain features, as with fords or chokepoints, a simple queuing model
can be executed to keep track of entities that must wait for entities
that are blocking the path. Service times and speed values are obtained
by sampling from a probability distribution appropriate for the blocked
area. A line of sight (LOS) check and range calculation is done between
the entity being simulated and known enemy locations. If the enemy
is within range of certain weapons (such as a HEAT or Sabot round),
an engagement will ensue. 
The simulation proceeds until either the plan has been
fully simulated, or the planner is interrupted.
<P>
The simulation result is recorded in the form of an integer
number,
the evaluation score, which is calculated using the following formula:
<P>
<IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="_25163_tex2html_wrap304.xbm">
<P>
The overall simulation strategy is branch and bound. Depending on
the order of the calls, however, it is possible to simulate
the COA tree in a somewhat depth-first manner.
<P>
There are several advantages to using Simulation to predict the
results of plan execution.
<OL><LI> Simulation provides a uniform method without resorting to adhoc solutions.
In simulation, each entity in the environment
is simulated in a uniform and consistent manner by using models that
represent both the physical and behavioral properties. Thus, simulating a
plan is a natural consequence of simulating each of the entities by itself
without having to worry about the global state change as a result
of each entities action.
<P>
<LI> Because there is no central reasoning node for the simulation
but many individual simulation models for different entities,
scalability is a natural consequence.  Extendibility is another
advantage simulation provides. The effects of adding
a new type of entity will be clear, only the behavior models of each
entity must be updated to recognize and reason about this new entity.
<P>
<LI> Similar to how simulation is used for visualization, simulation
can be easily used to perform visual playback of how a plan was
simulated to explain the planner's decision.
</OL>
<P>
<LI> The <b>Execution Monitor</b>
<P>
The Execution Monitor is the main driver of the Planning Behavior
module. It issues a set of chosen subtasks  in the plan to each units 
in an Oporder format and executes its own subtask if there is any.
If any Sitrep is received, it updates the world DB with any new 
information included in Sitrep such as sightings, destroyed units 
and changed location of units. Then it calls the Sitrep/Oporder Analyzer.
If the decision returned calls for immediate action,  the  control 
is given to the REACTIVE behavior module. If it calls for replanning, 
the SA  is called to start a planning process with the newly updated 
World DB. Finally, if the decision is to give up planning at the 
current level, the CE sends a Sitrep to its higher unit reporting of 
its current status and waits for further orders.

Through the design and construction of a C-based simulation 
module which evaluates candidate plans created by varying the route and 
subunit combinations, we have shown how we are able to perform planning 
using simulation. By allowing the use of different simulation models for 
different domains, the planner has the potential to solve a wide-range of 
problems.
The simulation-based planner runs in real-time on 
an IBM 486 PC. Our near term plan is to create and run the experiments 
that was discussed in section <A HREF=section3_6.html#exp>6</A> to thoroughly evaluate 
the simulation-based planning method. After these experiments, we plan  
to apply the simulation-based approach to other areas of planning 
such as traffic control.

The World Database is not a complete spatial representation of the 
battlefield (the Terrain Analyzer(TA) has this information) but a 
simplified database
which mainly contains information that is only known to the CE.
Since the TA does not have any information
regarding the location of enemy or friendly units and does not keep
track of the locations, the planner needs to keep track of these locations
and the status of the units in the World DB.
This database is created as soon as the CE starts to exist. Initially it
contains its own location and will be updated with new information as
it  becomes available to the CE via Sitreps or Oporders.

The Distributed Interactive Simulation Environment provides the ability 
to create large virtual worlds by linking 
individual simulators, allowing them to interact in real-time. 
And the Department of Defense has used these capabilities to revolutionalize 
the way the military train their forces, prepare for a combat and 
plan and rehearse operational missions. 
Even before the DIS revolution, the military has used the 
simulation-based approach to planning in the form of 
conflict simulation (or wargames).
Conflict simulations of the constructive type involve aggregate simulations
using discrete time (turns) and space (terrain). During a planning
phase, a commander would perform ``what if&quot; scenarios by setting up
a course of action on a hexagonally tiled map of the terrain. Engagements,
instead of being fought with individual entities, are abstracted using
a stochastic method in the form of a combat results table (CRT) or
through Lanchester equations for force attrition.
Related work by Czigler et al. <A HREF=bibliography3_9.html#martin>[1]</A>
demonstrates the usefulness of simulation as a decision tool in 
military planning.
<P>
Through a sample application in the domain of mission planning for 
Computer Generated Forces (CGF), we shall illustrate how we 
extend the classical planning method by using simulation of 
more detailed models, where the models simulate entity queuing at fords
and bridges as well as engagements. Currently, our engagement simulation
uses many of the features of constructive models, such as
probabilistic combat results tables, but we will eventually create
plans that involve simulated entity-level interaction since this
is the most accurate way to learn if a plan will fail or succeed.

Fishwick <A HREF=bibliography3_9.html#fish>[6]</A> defines simulation as `` the discipline of
designing a model of an actual or theoretical physical system, executing
the model on a digital computer, and analyzing the execution
output&quot;.
In the AI planning literature, Dean <A HREF=bibliography3_9.html#dean>[3]</A> states that the idea of 
using model to formulate sequences of actions is central to planning and
given a sequence of actions, a robot can use the model to simulate
the future as it would occur if the actions
were carried out. So simulation provides the robot with 
information which can be used to suggest modifications or to compare the 
proposed sequence with alternative sequences.
Thus, simulation-based planning integrates these two ideas.
Simulation has always been used within planning, although 
in a very abstract way, using operators and rules for example.  
The idea is to use more detailed simulation models originally built for 
simulation purposes in place of the highly abstract rule-based models.
Therefore, once simulation models are built for a system, 
simulation can be used as a tool to provide the system with information 
useful for evaluating its hypothesis which are a set of generated plans.

General-purpose planners <A HREF=bibliography3_9.html#tate>[13]</A><A HREF=bibliography3_9.html#vere>[14]</A><A HREF=bibliography3_9.html#wilk>[15]</A><A HREF=bibliography3_9.html#sdoti2>[12]</A> claim to  
solve planning problems for many different domains. They may, in fact,
be able to solve all the different planning problems but the problem is 
that they may not be able to solve it in an efficient and timely manner.
Since many of these general-purpose planners use a single methodology,
they are usually restricted in their ways of representation and reasoning.
Therefore, they do not have the flexibility to adequately express and 
reason about all the different domains in an efficient way. 
This is not a problem when the planner does not have to plan,  
interact and execute at the same time.
However, for any planner that has to work in an interactive 
environment such as the Distributed Interactive simulation Environments,
a planner must not only plan and react at the same time but it must do 
so in a time period that is at least close to real-time.
<P>
Our solution is to use simulation-based planning which uses  
simulations to evaluate different candidate plans after they have been 
generated by the planning system. A typical way to view the planning 
process is to divide it into three steps. The first step is plan generation 
where several plans, if possible, are generated that are likely to 
be good candidates. Second, the set of candidate plans are evaluated 
by performing a temporal projection into the future 
in virtual time and accessing the results prior to the execution. 
The results are then compared and a plan is chosen for execution 
in the final step.  If appropriate models can be used that best captures 
the behavior of actions and reactions of each agent, the evaluation of 
plans will be more accurate allowing better selection of the best plan.

Multimodeling <A HREF=bibliography3_9.html#lee>[8]</A><A HREF=bibliography3_9.html#fish>[6]</A><A HREF=bibliography3_9.html#tomacs2>[4]</A><A HREF=bibliography3_9.html#tomacs>[5]</A> will be used to model
processes and agents at multiple abstraction levels.
Related work <A HREF=bibliography3_9.html#swlee>[9]</A> suggests the use of a coordinated 
set of methods, each method having different scope and performance.
Some experimental implementations of this approach has been done on 
Soar <A HREF=bibliography3_9.html#rose>[11]</A>.
<P>
In section <A HREF=section3_2.html#sim>2</A>, the general concept of Simulation-based planning is 
described. We discuss the mission planning problem as an application in 
Section <A HREF=section3_3.html#mplan>3</A>.
Then in section <A HREF=section3_6.html#exp>6</A>, we propose the design of planned 
future experiments and finally some conclusions in section <A HREF=section3_7.html#conc>7</A>.

<P>
<em>General-purpose planners have been proposed but 
few have shown to work effectively and efficiently enough 
for many domains to be really called general-purpose. 
A general-purpose planner that uses a single methodology is often too 
restrictive and therefore cannot plan effectively for all domains. 
As planning problems become more complicated, having multiagents of 
different types in dynamic environments, evaluating candidate plans 
and choosing the best plan becomes prohibitively complex if not 
impossible within a single methodology.  To overcome this problem, 
we propose simulation-based planning where simulation is used 
to evaluate the candidate plans. By allowing appropriate simulation model types 
to accurately express each type of agent in the domain,
the task of measuring the success and effects of each candidate plans
is simplified and the resulting evaluation will be more accurate
since plans are simulated using dynamic models.
We describe an application along with the implementation of simulation-based 
planning in the domain of Mission Planning.
Possible future experiments related to Soar are also discussed.</em><A NAME=tex2html1 HREF=ieee-paper.foot.html#33><IMG ALIGN=MIDDLE SRC="http://www.cis.ufl.edu/images/latexicons/foot_motif.gif"></A>

In an effort to contain the stream, thousandsof Soviet workers converged on the site to erect a steel and concretesarcophagus around the reactor building. However, because of thelife-threatening conditions, the welders were unable to seal the24-story structure, which to this day remains leaky and unsound.Many workers, called &quot;liquidators,&quot; were saturated withradiation, resulting in acute radiation sickness and even death.<P>In the midst of this disaster, Russian scientists called all overthe world in a desperate search for remote-operated equipment,hoping to protect their exposed workers. There was little equipmentavailable and much of what they did use failed. What the Russiansneeded was a fleet of Rosies.<P><B>Rosie </B><P>Designed to decontaminate and dismantle aging nuclear facilities,Rosie is a construction-grade, remotely-operated worksystem capableof tearing a building down from the inside out. At the time ofthe Chernobyl accident, Soviet officials contacted researchersat Carnegie Mellon University about Rosie's grandmother, the &quot;Workhorse,&quot;a multipurpose, remote worksystem for the Three-Mile Island nuclearpower plant. Although the system wasn't ready for release, theChernobyl incident inspired a group of CMU researchers to formRedZone Robotics, a company that develops remote technology forhazardous environments. Now, almost a decade later, RedZone hasreleased the Workhorse's progeny for its commercial debut.<P>No small potatoes, Rosie weighs 14,000 pounds and stands 6 feetwide by 12 feet long and 8 feet high (see Figure 1). The systemboasts a crane-like manipulator that can carry up to 2,000 poundsat a distance of 20 feet and four-wheel steering that lets itmaneuver in cluttered environments. As many as 10 on-board camerasprovide the operator several views of the work environment.<P><a href="x02foc01.gif"><img src=litfoc01.gif></a> file size= 215 K<br><P>Figure 1. Rosie's boom can handle 2,000-pound loads.<P>Rosie needs to be both rugged and flexible to decommission a nuclearfacility. Decontamination and dismantlement (D&amp;D) includesa variety of activities in an unstructured, dynamic environment.Unlike manufacturing tasks, there are few situations during D&amp;Dwhen a robot repeatedly performs the same activity in preciselythe same way. Consequently, Rosie builds on a base of teleoperation,rather than autonomy. However, RedZone would like to automateas many tasks as possible and will do so as soon as the technologybecomes available. &quot;Rosie is designed for upward integration,&quot;says Leona Bares, Rosie's project manager. &quot;We are workingwith dual-arm manipulation (Figure 2) where you can utilize advancedsensors, such as laser scanners or stereo vision, to create amap of the environment. After operating on the map in a simulationpackage, the robot will then execute that motion in reality.&quot;<P><a href="x02foc02.gif"><img src=litfoc02.gif></a> file size= 152 K<br><P>Figure 2. Rosie's dual-arm maniupulators.<P>In preparation for its first real-world task, Rosie is completinga series of endurance tests at the Oak Ridge National Laboratoryin Oak Ridge, Tennessee. As the lead site of the Department ofEnergy's D&amp;D robotics activity, the Oak Ridge lab has thesize and infrastructure to accommodate full-scale mockups. Themockups simulate the type of equipment that the robot will decommission,thus allowing researchers to evaluate the performance of a roboticsystem in a &quot;cold,&quot; comparable environment. &quot;Ifyou're really going to do remote operation, you don't wait untilyou get there to figure out how you're going to do it,&quot; saysDennis Haley, D&amp;D specialist in the Oak Ridge robotics technologydevelopment program. &quot;You try to understand the tasks, buildthe mockup, and do a lot of training.&quot; Haley points out thatthere are always unknowns when dismantling a reactor, but bringinga tested system and trained personnel to the task helps forestallmany problems. The duplicate environment offers another advantageas well. &quot;If you run into a real problem in a contaminatedenvironment you don't have the opportunity for everybody to goin and look at it or to bring the system out,&quot; Haley says.Scientists can safely work in the mockup's clean environment tofind solutions to unexpected problems.<P><B>Leaving the nest</B><P>Beginning in the fall of 1996, Rosie will assist in decommisioningthe CP-5 research reactor facility at the Argonne National Laboratoryin Chicago. As part of a large demonstration project where upto 40 other D&amp;D technologies will participate, Rosie and adual-arm manipulator will do most of the reactor dismantlement.Bares sees the CP-5 reactor as an ideal first job: &quot;We getreal experience to find out if the equipment can perform, andto test maintenance and reliability issues.&quot; But if thereis a problem, she says, &quot;the exposure levels are not so highthat we can't send people in for a very brief amount of time.&quot;Reliability is a top priority in reactor dismantlement. Baressays RedZone is eager to show that Rosie really works and is robust,that it's not just &quot;sandbox technology.&quot;<P>Although the CP-5 reactor is fairly small-20 feet across and about15 feet tall-its dismantlement is no mean feat. The reactor vessel,which contained the nuclear fuel, sits in the center of the structureand is 6 feet in diameter and nearly 9 feet tall. The vessel issurrounded by 2 feet of graphite blocks, a 10-foot diameter steelshell, a layer of lead bricks, another 2 feet of high-densityconcrete, and, finally, another steel shell. Many reactor componentsmight be highly radioactive, so Rosie must first remove them andthen &quot;size reduce&quot; and package them in hazardous wastecontainers. Rosie may also decontaminate some components, usinga high-pressure wash-down system, and then box them up for storage.<P>Dismantling a nuclear reactor is a complex task that demands awide array of tools. As Dennis Haley points out, &quot;Rosie,like most robotic systems, is a tool to get you there. It's adeployment system that moves other things around, such as tooling,decontamination processes, or characterization sensors.&quot;Rosie will deploy both small, dexterous tools, such as shears,grinders, and plasma torches, and large tools, such as jackhammers,scoops, and vacuums to pick up the debris.<P><B>Any takers?</B><P>After the Argonne reactor there'll be no shortage of work. Rosiewill start by tackling other Department of Energy and Departmentof Defense sites, including some that date back to the Manhattanproject-the wartime effort to design and build the first nuclearweapons during World War II. There are a lot of messes to cleanup, Bares says. &quot;We were in a tremendous hurry to producea lot of bombs, so there were a lot less concerns about waste-handlingpractices and about spills,&quot; Haley says. The military wasnot only less aware of the dangers that the contaminants posed,but it lacked safe, long-term disposal methods.<P>There are many commercial sites that require Rosie's servicesas well, but one thing stands in the way: &quot;the commercialnuclear power plants in the US and outside don't have the moneyto take their plants apart,&quot; says Bares. At approximately$750,000 per unit, Rosie is beyond the means of most individualsites. Bares predicts that a big part of Rosie's market will bethe service provider industry. Service providers may cover severalsites within a region, enabling them to amortize the cost overseveral jobs.<P>Rosie can also earn its keep as an emergency response system asthere is little difference between decommissioning and accidentresponse. Bares explains, &quot;you are dealing with a dynamic,unknown environment, a sort of move-and-discover operation. Thekind of activities you have to do-cutting, material handling,removing concrete and debris, and dealing with highly radioactivematerials-is much the same.&quot;<P>While Rosie's price tag might seem prohibitive, the cost of disasterslike Chernobyl are astounding. The Chernobyl cleanup currentlyaccounts for 15 percent of Ukraine's budget. Moreover, estimatesfor building a second sarcophagus around the first poorly constructedone range from $10 million to $15 billion. Because the Chernobylaccident was the genesis of RedZone Robotics, Bares hopes to putRosie to work there: &quot;I would like to make an impact on thataccident, 10 to 15 years later, to close that circle.&quot;<P></ul><P><BR><hr><p><i><A HREF="../../../expert.htm">IEEE Expert Online</A></i> | <a href="../../../depart.htm">Departments</a> | <a href="../../../feature.htm">Features</a> | <A HREF="../../../ai-www/ai-www.htm">AI on the WWW</A> | <A HREF="../../../board/board.htm">Editorial Board</A><BR><p><P> <A HREF="../../../../pubs.htm">Computer Society Publications</A> | <A HREF="../../../../../cshome.htm">Computer Society home page</A> </P><p>Send comments and questions about <i>IEEE Expert Online</i> to Anne Humphreys and Managing Editor Dick Price, <a href=mailto:ah34+@andrew.cmu.edu,dprice@computer.org>ah34+@andrew.cmu.edu and dprice@computer.org</a></p><p>Send general comments and questions about the IEEE Computer Society's Web site to <a href=mailto:webmaster@computer.org>webmaster@computer.org</a></p><P><font size=-1><i>Copyright (c) Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc.

<B>The Ultimate Predator</b><P>
The largest of the big cats, the tiger is a massive predator.  The 
largest individual on record was a Siberian tiger that weighed 700lbs!  
Because of their large size, tigers prefer to ambush and sprint after 
their prey rather than chasing it for long distances.  Tigers are 
camouflaged to help them get as close as possible to their prey.  Their 
yellow/orange coat with black stripes allows them to blend into the under 
brush and tall grass and virtually disappear.  Tiger are the only cats 
(felids) with stripes. <P>
<IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="tiger.jpg">
<B>The Secret Life of Tigers</b><P>
Tigers are generally solitary animals, but young remain with their mother 
until nearly mature.  As young tigers reach maturity they must leave 
their mothers territories and try to establish one of their own. Tigers 
need a lot of space, the typical female needs about eight square miles to 
support both her and her cubs.  Males tigers need even more space than 
females.  The typical male's territory overlaps with several female's 
territories.  Tigers protect their territories by scent marking special 
scent "posts" with urine. After checking to see if anyone has left a 
"message" for them, they like to leave a special message of their own. 
Scent posts can be any prominent landmark, like a large tree or rock.  
Also, tigers will scratch large trees with their front claws up to eight 
feet up the sides of the trunk, which lets any visitor know that they are 
in tiger territory. <P> 
<B>Tigers in Trouble</b><P>
There are eight subspecies of tiger that live in different climatic zones 
throughout the Asain continent.  These subspecies include:  Bengal, 
Siberian, South China, Sumatran, Indo-Chinese, Caspian, Javan and Bali.  
The Caspian, Javan, and Bali tigers are now extinct, while the other five 
are endangered species.    The bad news is that tiger specialists 
consider all but one subspecies to have populations too small and 
separated from one another to survive for very long.  These isolated 
populations are surrounded by the growing human population.  As a result 
people compete with tigers for living space and food.  The irony is that 
tigers are protected in all of their range by legislation, but poaching 
still occurs.  Many Asain people respect and revere the tiger- to some it 
is a god.  In order to share its divine powers, however, tiger parts are 
bought and sold.  Every portion of this animal's body (from bones to 
whiskers) has a perscribed medical use even though their value to 
medicine is unproven and modern cures already exisist.    <p>

The problem is that saving tigers is very expensive, and many of the 
countries where tigers live are poor and can not afford to enforce their 
own laws.  Also, many of these countries have a rapidly growing human 
population.  In India alone the human population increased by 161 million 
people from 1980 to 1990.  People need space too, and in many cases they 
are taking it from tigers. The best way to save tigers is to protect 
their habitat and through conservation education. Secondly, international 
trade laws (like CITES) that have been put in place to protect tigers and 
other endangered species need wide public support both internationally 
and in the countries where tigers still exist.   Support means strict 
enforcement of existing laws which means there must be financial and 
political support from the international community if there are to be 
tigers in the future.<P> 
<B>Did You Know?</b><P>
Tigers are nocturnal hunters.  They like to travel along well used trails 
at night and look for prey.  Their striped pattern helps them blend into 
the shadows of the forest so they can surprise their prey.  Tigers have a 
really big appetite.  An adult tiger can eat 65 pounds of meat in a 
single meal.<P>

<H3>What is the Conservation Fund?</H3>

<P>Founded in 1873, the Cincinnati Zoo & Botanical Garden has consistently
taken a leadership role in the effort to preserve and protect animal species
throughout the world. Our work in the area of conservation stands out among
American zoos, and is admired by members of the conservation community across
the globe.</P>

<P>Nevertheless, wildlife populations continue to decline, and many species
face outright extinction. The major cause of the crisis is habitat loss,
particularly in the tropical rain forests of the world. Home to 50% of all
plant and animal species, the rain forests covered 20% of the Earth&iacute;s
surface. Devastated by deforestation, they now account for less than 7%.
Accordingly, our mission has evolved beyond the conservation of species
to that of habitat preservation - saving the ecosystems in which these species
belong.</P>

<P>In 1990, the Zoo Conservation Fund was established so that our institution
could join habitat preservation efforts around the world. The fund now helps
to support four rain forest ecosystems - each unique and biologically diverse.</P>

<P><BR>
<HR ALIGN=LEFT><BR>
</P>

<H3>Suriname</H3>

<P>Suriname&iacute;s vast rain forests are among the most pristine wilderness
areas in South America, and are home to thousands of plant species and hundreds
of species of birds, mammals, reptiles, and amphibians. They are alive with
eight species of primates, including golden-headed tamarins, red howler
monkeys, and white-faced sakis, as well as jaguars, tapirs, peccaries, and
tamanduas &shy; all dependent on the rain forest for survival.</P>

<P>Strengthened by the efforts of Conservation International, many Surinamese
have a deep commitment to preserving this fragile habitat. The Zoo Conservation
Fund assists by creating educational guides for the visitors to the Raleighvallen-Voltzberg
Nature Reserve. Fund contributions also support public awareness campaigns
to protect endangered species, including the poison dart frog, <I>Dendrobates
azureus</I>.</P>

<H3>Gabon</H3>

<P>The Gamba Reserve, located along the coast of Gabon in West Africa, unites
diverse marine, tropical forest, and savannah habitats to create a true
wildlife paradise. It is the only place in the world where elephants and
forest buffalo roam the beaches, African manatees live in the lagoons, and
humpback whales and leatherback sea turtles feed offshore. Within the virgin
forest, bongo antelope, duiker, hippopotamus, leopard, and 20 species of
primates, including chimpanzees, are thriving. There 400 of Gabon&iacute;s
650 bird species nest in the green canopy and along the rich waterways.</P>

<P>The Zoo Conservation Fund supports the work of the World Wildlife Fund
in building ranger stations now staffed by full time guards who monitor
wildlife populations and deter poaching within the reserve.</P>

<H3>Zaire</H3>

<P>Zaire&iacute;s Ituri Forest is one of the most remote areas on the continent
of Africa. Forest wildlife includes bongo, duiker, Congo peafowl, and chimpanzees
as well as the rare okapi. The indigenous Lese and Efe people have lived
in harmony with the Ituri Forest for thousands of years, and are dependent
upon its resources for food, medicine, clothing, and shelter.</P>

<P>Like most indigenous groups in emerging cultures, the people of the Ituri
Forest struggle to maintain control over policies that affect their lives.
The Ituri Fund assists the Efe and Lese in establishing schools and providing
health care services. The Zoo Conservation Fund contributes to the effort
by supporting teacher salaries. The Fund also supplies educational materials
promoting literacy awareness of ecological issues.</P>

<H3>Sumatra</H3>

<P>The Gunung Leuser National Park is Indonesia&iacute;s largest remaining
wilderness area. Unrivaled in biological diversity, the park encompasses
a broad range of habitats, from coastal rain forests to mountain peaks.
The Sumatran orangutan, Sumatran tiger, Asian elephant, great argus pheasant,
rhinoceros hornbill, flying fox, sun bear, binterong, and the very endangered
Sumatran rhino all live within the park boundaries.</P>

<P>Working with the World Wildlife Fund, the Zoo Conservation Fund protects
these habitats through support of a Geographical Information System (GIS)
which helps park rangers to strike a balance between wildlife conservation
and encroaching human needs.</P>

<P><BR>
<HR ALIGN=LEFT><BR>
</P>

<H3>A Call to Action</H3>

<P>Every species on the planet is a part of a fragile and unique habitat,
and the frightening reality of our world is this: if we do not protect our
habitats, our most wondrous species will surely disappear from our midst.</P>

<P>Your support of the Zoo Conservation Fund will go a long way toward protecting
endangered habitats throughout the world, including those of many of the
species on display at the Cincinnati Zoo & Botanical Garden. Please join
this important effort today. Conservation cannot wait.</P>

<H1>Habitat = Wildlife</H1>

<P>Many problems face the world&iacute;s wild creatures, but none are more
pressing than the shrinking of wild areas. Ask any hunter, fisherman or
bird watcher how they know where to find their quarry and the answer will
be the same: HABITAT. If enough viable habitat for the species exists, odds
are you will find them there. In the words of conservation leader, David
Brower, &quot;wild species are only 2 percent flesh and bone and 98 percent
place.&quot;</P>

<P>It sounds fairly simple; but the trouble is that many of the Earth&iacute;s
wild plants are in a deadly game of habitat musical chairs when it comes
to their homes. Each year when the migrating birds return to nest, or another
young organism attempts to establish a territory, there are often fewer
options than the previous year.</P>

<P>That is the very reason that the Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Garden
works so hard to help our visitors and members understand the vital importance
of wild habitat for wild species. It is also why we work with a worldwide
network of conservation organizations like the Nature Conservancy and Conservation
International to help protect critical wild areas.</P>

<P>When the Cincinnati Zoo first opened its gates in 1875, the world was
a vastly different place. Over much of the world, wild areas dominated the
landscape, with pockets of human habitation and cultivation interspersed
between. Today, however, with nearly 6 billion people, there are only islands
of wild areas remaining in a sea of human development and agriculture.</P>

<P>With wild areas under siege and at greater risk than ever, the role and
message of a modern zoo has evolved into becoming that of an environmental
resource center - a place where students can learn how natural ecosystems
work and what it will take to protect them. William Conway, Director of
the Bronx Zoo and leading guru of the zoo field, puts it this way, &quot;zoos
have too much to do to subside into 'Ye Olde Williamsburg'- like museums
representing idealized habitats of yesteryear. Teaching about a living nature
demands saving is a compelling mission. Teaching about a world that no longer
exists is much less so. Zoos must focus their central efforts upon the preservation
of nature.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;The Idea of Wilderness needs no defense, only more defenders.&quot;
- Edward Abbey</P>

<P>Zoos are community resources dedicated to nurturing in their visitors
the interest and love of wildlife, and increasingly, to incite action for
the preservation of nature.</P>

Yet these forests cover only 5% of the Earth's land. Imagine so much life

When you become a Zoo member, you and your family will enjoy a full year 
of entertaining events and educational programs available only at the 
Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Garden. Your membership helps support the 
Zoo's diverse collection of more than 750 animal species - many of which 
are endangered or extinct in the wild. You help make possible 
award-winning Zoo educational programs serving schools throughout the 
tri-state region and unique reproductive research programs at the Zoo's 
Center for Reproduction of Endangered Wildlife. You also become an 
important partner in the Zoo's cooperative effort with conservation 
organizations around the globe to conserve habitat and endangered wildlife.

If future generations are to remember us more with gratitude than with 
sorrow, we must achieve more than just the miracles of technology. We 
must also leave them a glimpse of the world as it was created, not 
just as it looked when we got through with it. <br>
					<b>	-Lyndon B. Johnson </b><p>
 
 
The beauty of our land is a natural resource. Its preservation is linked to 
the prosperity of the human spirit.<br> 
						<b>-Lyndon B. Johnson </b><p>
 
 
The earth can be an abundant mother if we learn to use her with skill and wisdom- to tend to her wounds, 
replenish her vitality, and utilize her potentialities. <br>
					<B>	-John F. Kennedy </b><p>
 
 
The earth we abuse and the living things we kill, will in the end, take their revenge; for in exploiting their 
presence, we are diminishing our future. <br>
					<b>	-Marya Mannes </b><p>
 
There is a true music of Nature; <br>
	the song of the birds, <br>
	the whisper of leaves, <br>
	the ripple of waters upon a sandy shore,<br> 
	and the wail of wind or sea. <br>
					<b>	-John Lubbock </b><p>
 
 
We enjoy the lonesome and the empty because, unlike our ancestors, we are too familiar with the crowded 
and the confined. <br>
					<b>	-Joseph Wood Krutch </b><p>
 
 
Touch the earth, love the earth, honor the earth, her plains, her valleys, her hills, and her seas; rest your 
spirit in her solitary places. <br>
					<b>	-Henry Beston </b><p>
 
 
To deprive the globe of physical wilderness would be to give a deep wound to 
our own kind. <br>
					<b>	-F. Fraser Darling and 
						Noel D. Eichorn </b><p>
 
 
In the long war on wildlife, man has steadily advanced and wildlife retreated. We are now in danger of 
achieving total victory. We have the capability to wipe out competing life on a tremendous scale. In such a 
victory we would surely find catastrophic defeat. <br>
					<b>	-Faith McNulty </b><p>
 
 
Man is demolishing nature...We are killing things that keep us alive.<br> 
					<b>	-Thor Heyerdahl </b><p>
 
 
 
You find yourself alone, finally freed from all reminders of civilization, 
encountering (and maybe beginning to understand) the rhythms of nature itself.
 As you camp beside a mountain lake, and wander its shores, peer under its 
banks, sit on its boulders and stare at the slowly changing colors in the 
water, you begin to conceive of yourself once again as a natural being, a 
single pure note in the harmony surrounding you. The sound of your own breath 
will become the sound of the wind; the lap of the water will keep time with 
the pulse of your blood. And you'll know why you went to all that effort to 
get there. And you'll wonder why you didn't do it sooner. Home again. 
For the first time. <br>
					<b>	-Jon Carroll </b><p>
 
 
This we know. The Earth does not belong to man; man belongs to the Earth. This we know. All things are 
connected like the blood which unites one family. All things are connected. Whatever befalls the Earth 
befalls the sons of the Earth. Man did not weave the web of life; he is merely a strand in it. Whatever he 
does to the web, he does to himself. <br>
					<b>	-Chief Seattle </b><p>
 
 
This curious world we inhabit is more wonderful than convenient; <br>
more beautiful than it is useful;  <br>
it is more to be admired and enjoyed than used. <br>
					<b>	-Henry David Thoreau </b><p>
 
 
Suddenly a man realizes that the age of universal iron and steel, smog and clamor, glass and plastic and 
aluminum, is almost upon him. It seems as if our children may someday read of the America wilderness... 
as we read of lost Atlantis. <br>
					<b>	-Edward Abbey </b><p>
 
 
The love of wilderness is more than a hunger for what is always beyond reach, 
it is also an expression of loyalty to the earth (the earth which bore us 
and sustains us), the only home we shall ever know, the only 
paradise we ever need- if only we had the eyes to see. <br>
					<b>	-Edward Abbey </b><p>
 
 
Something will have gone out of us as apeople if we ever let the remaining 
wilderness be destroyed... if we pollute the last clean air and dirty the 
last clean streams and push our paved roads through the last of the 
silence.<br> 
					<b>	-Wallace Stegner </b><p>
 
 
The world needs a place where wolves stalk the strand lines in the dark, because a land that can produce a 
wolf is a healthy, robust, and a perfect land. <br>
					<b>	-Robert B. Weeden, 
						wildlife biologist </b><p>
 
 
Man depends on wildlife for survival, and wildlife depends equally on man. The two must find means for 
living together on planet earth or there will be no life on earth. <br>
					<b>	-Raymond R. Dasmann </b><p>
 
 
The beauty and genius of a work of art may be reconceived, though its first material expression destroyed; 
a vanished harmony may yet again inspire the composer; but when the last individual of a race of living 
things breathes no more, another heaven and another earth must pass before 
such a one can be again. <br>
					<b>	-William Beebe </b><p>
 
 
Come into the mountains, dear friend <br>
Leave society and take no one with you but your true self <br>
Get close to nature <br>
Your everyday games will be insignificant <br>
Notice the clouds spontaneously forming patterns <br>
And try to do that with your life <br>
					<b>	-Susan Polis Schultz </b><p>
 
 
Remember the circle of the sky <br>
	the stars and the brown eagle <br>
	the great life of the sun <br>
	the young within the nest <br>
Remember the sacredness of things <br>
					<b>	-Pawnee </b><p>
 
 
Is civilization progress? The challenge, I think, is clear; and, as clearly, the final answer will be given not 
by our amassing of knowledge, or by the discoveries of our science, or by the speed of our aircraft, but by 
the effect our civilized activities as a whole have upon the quality of our planet's life- the life of plants and 
animals as well as that of men. <br>
					<b>	-Charles A. Lindbergh, Jr </b><p>
 
 
Conservation is not so much a science  as an ecological point of view, a morality, an ethics inseparably 
linked to the science of biology and to human welfare. <br>
					<b>	-Hugh H. Iltis </b><p>
 
 
During an inexplicable and meaningless moment we will have appeared, peered about, and disappeared. 
A vertical rising and instantly descending line on a graph in the indifferent eons of time. Nothing more. 
So- if you can, wring the most out of that nothingness!... Quickly now- get on your way! Start exploring, 
navigating this small life-saturated, indefinably wonderful only 
planet that we will ever know. <br>
					<b>	-Robert Hittredge </b><p>
 
 
Animals were once, for all of us, teachers. They instructed us in ways of being and perceiving that 
extended our imaginations,  that were models for additional possibilities. We watched them make their 
way through the intricacies of their lives with wonder and with awe. Seeing the wolf pick his delicate way 
across the snowy forest floor, the eyes of the owl hold the image of the mouse, the dark shape of the whale 
break the surface of the sea- 
reminded us of the grand sweep and diversity of life, of its infinite 
possibilities. <br>
					<b>	-Joan McIntyre </b><p>
 
 
 
We have not inherited the Earth from our parents, we have borrowed it from 
our children. <br>
					<b>	-IUCN </b><p>
 
 
One does not meet oneself until one catches the reflection from an eye 
other than human. <br>
					<b>	-Loren Eiseley </b><p>
 
 
 
The fact is that no species has ever had such wholesale control over 
everything on earth, living or dead, as 
we now have. In our hands now lies not only our own future but that of all other living creatures with 
whom we share the earth. <br>
					<b>	-David Attenborough </b><p>
 
 
Nature will deliberately reveal itself... if only we look. <br>
					<b>	-Thomas Edison </b><p>
 
 
It takes a very long period of watching to really become familiar with an animal and to attain a deeper 
understanding of its behavior; and without love for the animal itself, no observer, however patient, could 
ever look at it long enough to make vauable observations on its behavior. 
<br>
					<b>	-Konrad Lorenz </b><p>
 
 
Life outside a person is an extension of the life within him. This compells him to be part of it and accept 
responsibility for all creatures great and small. Life becomes harder, when we live for others, but it also 
becomes richer and happier. <br>
					<b>	-Albert Schweitzer </b><p>
 
 
A man is ethical only when life, as such, is sacred to him, that of plants and animals as well as that of his 
fellowman, and when he devotes himself helpfully to all life that is in 
need of help. <br>
					<b>	-Albert Schweitzer </b><p>
 
 
This world, after all our science and sciences, is still a miracle, 
wonderful, inscrutable, magical and more, to whosoever will think of it. <br>
					<b>	-Thomas Carlyle </b><p>
 
 
The worst sin towards our fellow creatures is not to hate them, but to be indiffernet to them; that's the 
essence of inhumanity. <br>
					<b>	-George Bernard Shaw </b><p>
 
 
It is the responsibility of all who are alive today to accept the trusteeship of wildlife and to hand on to 
posterity, as a source of wonder and interest, knowliedge and enjoyment, the entire wealth of diverse 
animals and plants. This generation has no right by selfishness, wanton or international destruction, or 
neglect, to rob future generations of this rich heritage. Extermination of other creatures is a disgrace to 
humankind. <br>
					<b>	-World Wildlife Charter </b><p>
 
 
We need another and a wiser and perhaps a more mystical concept of animals. Remote from universal 
nature, and living by complicated artifice, man in civilization surveys the creature through the glass of his 
knowledge and sees thereby a feather magnified and the whole image in distortion. We patronize tham for 
their incompleteness, for their tragic fate of having taken form so far below ourselves. And therein we err, 
and greatly err. For the animal shall not be measured by man. In a world older and more complete than 
ours they moved finished and complete, gifted with extensions of the senses we have lost or never 
attained, living by voices we shall never hear. They are not brethren, they are not underlings; they are 
other nations, caught with ourselves in the net of life and time, fellow prisoners of the splendour and 
travail of the earth. <br>
					<b>	-Henry Beston from The Outermost 
House </b><p> 
 
 
Mechanized recreation has already seized nine-tenths of the woods and mountains; a decent respect for 
minorities should dedicate the other tenth to wilderness. <br>
					<b>	-Aldo Leopold </b><p>
 
I go to Nature to be soothed and healed, 
and have my senses put in tune once more. <br>
					<b>	-John Burroughs </b><p>

<h3>The Botanical Garden at the Cincinnati Zoo</h3>

        As soon as visitors set foot in the Zoo they are also
among our naturalistic botanical garden, a living museum
with over three thousand kinds of plants from around the
world. <p>

         Ever since the Cincinnati Zoo was founded 120 years ago a
combination of animals and plants has been a part of the
institution's vision. In nature plants and animals are
intimately connected. Their ecological relationships are
incredibly complex and a fundamental part of life on earth.
Plants capture the solar energy of the sun and make it
available to practically all of the other life forms on
earth. Plants provide animals with shelter and cover and in
turn, various animals provide plants with fertilizer,
pollination and seed dispersal.  <p>

        From a human perspective, plants are intimately connected
to people in a myriad of ways. Plants provide food,
shelter, medicine, chemicals, and many other raw materials.
Beyond our nutritional and economic dependence upon them,
plants and flowers are inherently pleasing and interesting
to people. Plants, gardens, and natural landscapes have an
emotionally relaxing, restorative, influence on humans,
that is a part of our natural, genetic roots.    <p>

        At the Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Garden our
award-winning naturalistic landscapes and gardens
demonstrate the complexity and diversity of nature, its
beauty and its excitement. Labeling and educational
programs inform visitors of the vital relationships of
plants, animals, and people, fulfilling  an important part
of our institution's conservation and recreation mission. <p>

        The Cincinnati Zoo was originally planted in the 1870s as
an experimental garden with a large number of exotic trees
and shrubs from around the world. Some of the historic 19th
century trees still stand today. Visitors can see the giant
Japanese pagoda tree (the Ohio Champion) near the Vine
Street pedestrian entrance, the two hundred year old red
oak  and pin oak near the gazebo, and the big catalpas
between Swan Lake and the Education Center. <p>     

        Botanical gardens share some physical and aesthetic
qualities with conventional parks. In both one will find
ornamental trees, shrubs, and flowers.  Botanical gardens,
however, consist of labeled specimens that are available
for study, research, and enjoyment.      <P>

        Ever since 1894 the Zoo has endeavored to label its many
unusual trees and shrubs for visitor education and
enjoyment. Today one can see thousands of  trees, shrubs,
bulbs, annuals, perennials, ornamental grasses, and
tropical plants labeled with their identity, a description
of their ornamental characteristics, their region of
origin, and other information. <p>

         In botanical gardens horticulturists maintain plant
records, now generally on computer systems,  which keeps
track of the origin and location of each plant. Unlike many
typical botanical gardens, our botanical displays does not
include separate gardens of roses, lilacs, or
rhododendrons.  In general, our naturalistic plantings
blend with a multitude of animal exhibits to demonstrate
the complexity and diversity of the natural world rather
than human gardens.      <p>

        In many botanical gardens there is a strong interest in
preserving endangered plant species and in educating about
conservation. At the Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Garden
there are a number of endangered plant species in our plant
collection, including several American species. Many of
these can be seen in the new McIlheeny Endangered Species
Garden in front of the Zoo's research center, C.R.E.W.
(Center for the Reproduction of Endangered Wildlife).
C.R.E.W.'s Plant Division works through the technologies of
tissue culturing, in-vitro fertilization, and
cryopreservation (freezing) of seed to help preserve
endangered plants.        <p>

        At the Zoo's Botanical Center, located between the
Education Center and the gift shops visitors can learn
about plants and the symbiotic relationships of plants and
animals. Informative signs, photographs, special exhibits,
and stories from trained volunteers cultivate an
understanding of the riches of the natural world.
Throughout the year garden volunteers offer tours of the
gardens and landscape to garden clubs and other groups. For
further information regarding a garden tour for your group
call (513) 281-4701 ext. 8307. <p>

<h3> April 12 through May 12</h3>
</CENTER>

<IMG SRC="conifer.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT>
Each year more than half a million bulbs and other early flowers bloom 
here, making the Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Garden one of the nation's 
outstanding Spring Floral displays.  The Floral Festival is the result 
of much planning and hard work.  Last fall, over 17,000 tulips and 6,000 
daffodils were planted, as well as thousands of hyacinths, Spanish 
bluebells and crocus to create a fabulous floral display for this year's 
Festival.<p>

Among this year's highlights are new hardy varieties of forsythia, 
flowering cherries, magnolias, tulips, lilacs and dozens of other 
flowering trees and shrubs.  Perhaps nothing is more symbolic of Spring 
however, than the daffodil, and the Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Garden 
will display more than 100 cultivars of this flower with descriptive 
names such as  February Gold, March Sunshine and Water Music.<p>

There are also many Spring blooming annuals and perennials to brighten 
the landscape. Winter Aconite, Primrose  and  Windflower are a few of 
the earlier bloomers, but Columbine and Foxglove are not far behind. 
Pansies and Forget-me-nots are also  planted  for additional Spring 
color and interest.<p>

 Since 1875 the Cincinnati Zoo has played a vital role in the 
life of Cincinnati and the surrounding region where it has served as an 
important educational and recreational institution, civic center, and 
tourist destination. The Zoo opened its doors on September 18, 1875. It 
was the second major zoological garden in the U.S.A., following the 
Philadelphia Zoo, which began fourteen months earlier. The Cincinnati 
Zoo's original managing organization, the Zoological Society of 
Cincinnati, was founded in 1873. A particularly important and unique 
aspect of the Zoo's past is its early German influences. The Zoo's 
founder, Andrew (Andreas) Erkenbrecher was a German-born immigrant and 
animal lover who worked persistently to establish a zoological garden in 
Cincinnati. The Cincinnati Zoo was largely patterned after the Frankfurt 
Zoological garden along with other major European zoos. The Cincinnati 
Zoo opened with 65 acres, the same as the Berlin Zoo, then the largest 
zoo in Europe.<p>

A well-financed, comprehensive plan of architectural and 
landscape design resulted in much of the Cincinnati Zoo's extensive 
original buildings being completed in 1875. Notable buildings still stand 
from this date, including the oldest zoo building in America, the Reptile 
House, which was originally built as the <a href="monkey.html">Monkey 
House</a>. The Passenger 
Pigeon Memorial was also built in 1875. <A HREF="hortpix/elephant.gif">The 
Elephant 
House</a>, built in 1906 and patterned after similar exotic architecture 
at the Berlin Zoo, is 
today one of the most spectacular historic zoo buildings in the world. 
The Cincinnati Zoo also has some of the nation's earliest <a 
HREF="hortpix/grotto.jpg">barless exhibits</a>, completed in the 1930s, and 
designed by the Hagenbeck firm of 
Hamburg, Germany. Today the Cincinnati Zoo is one of two zoos that has 
been designated as a National Historic Landmark, for its "... 
significance in commemerating the history of the U.S.A." by the National 
Park Service, U.S. Department of the Interior.<p>

The long history of the Cincinnati Zoo has included a number of 
ups and downs. The original Zoological Society of Cincinnati was a 
for-profit corporation modeled after similar European zoo societies. The 
first years were plagued with financial hardships because of high 
property rental costs and the poor public transportation of the time. In 
1898 the Society went into receivership and the following year a 
non-profit Cincinnati Zoological Company was formed to operate the Zoo. 
In 1902 the local public transit company, the Cincinnati Traction 
Company, purchased controlling interests in the Cincinnati Zoological 
Company and provided funds for a variety of zoo improvements. In 1917 the 
Zoo was purchased by two prominent philanthropists, Mrs. Mary Emery and 
Mrs. Anna Sinton Taft, after the Cincinnati Traction Company was no 
longer able to support the Zoo. A new Zoo operating organization was 
developed, the Cincinnati Zoological Park Association. Its president was 
Mrs. Taft's husband, Charles Phelps Taft, the half brother of President 
William Howard Taft. In 1932 the Zoo was purchased by the City of 
Cincinnati and a new zoo management organization was formed, the present 
day Zoological Society of Cincinnati. <p>

The early Zoo was hampered by the high turnover of its 
superintendents. The first superintendent was Dr. Heinrich Dorner, who 
had previously been Scientific-Secretary of the Hamburg (Germany) Zoo. 
Dorner only lasted one year and a series of superintendents followed 
until 1886 when the head keeper, Sol Stephan, was appointed as 
superintendent. Stephan served until 1937 when he retired at the age of 
88. One of America's pioneering zoo directors, Stephan was nationally 
renowned for his knowledge of animal management, breeding, and zoo 
operations. Sol Stephan was Carl Hagenbeck's American animal sales agent  
in the early 1900s and an early advocate of Hagenbeck's barless exhibits 
and other innovative husbandry practices. Stephan was followed by John 
(Jack) Heusser who served as Executive Director until 1961. After a short 
transitional period under the leadership of William Hoff, Edward M. 
Maruska became Executive Director in 1968. Since that time Maruska has 
led the Zoo in  wide-ranging programs of dramatic improvement, ranging 
from collections, exhibits, education, research, attendance and 
membership.<p>

Throughout much of its history the Cincinnati Zoo has had one of 
the nation's outstanding animal collections. Most of the Zoo's original 
animal purchases were from Carl Hagenbeck of Hamburg, Germany. Until the 
1940s the Zoo's collections were generally outstanding. The Zoo played an 
important early role in captive breeding and had a number of American zoo 
breeding firsts including: California sea lions (1878), trumpeter swans 
(1880), bison and giraffe (1889). Some of the most notable animals 
through Zoo history have included "<a href="pigeon.html">Martha</a>," the 
last passenger pigeon who 
died in 1914 and "Incas," the last Carolina parakeet in captivity who 
died in 1918. The Zoo's most popular animal in the 1930s and 1940s was 
"Susie," a female lowland gorilla, who was trained to eat at a table with 
her trainer. She died in 1947 at the age of 22, establishing a longevity 
record for the species at that time. In recent decades the Zoo has had 
notable success in breeding lowland gorillas, black rhinoceros, Komodo 
dragon monitor lizards, and a number of cat species among many other 
species. In recent decades research programs at the Zoo have focused on 
reproductive research. The Zoo's Center for Reproduction of Endangered 
Wildlife or "CREW" has had many significant successes with embryo 
transfer and cryopreservation technologies. In 1988 the Zoo began 
operations on a satellite breeding facility, the Mast Farm.<p>

Since its founding the Cincinnati Zoo has emphasized plantings 
and landscape. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s the role of plants 
increased. In 1987 the official name of the institution was changed from 
the Cincinnati Zoological Garden to the Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical 
Garden.<p>
 
Since the 1890s the Zoo has had close relationships with public 
and private schools. In recent years education has played an 
ever-increasing role at the Zoo.<p>

One of the Zoo's most unique historical features was the <A 
HREF="hortpix/Opera.jpg">Zoo 
Summer Opera</a>.  When the Zoo opened in 1875 it followed the German zoo 
tradition of having band concerts.  Musical performances continued over 
the years and in 1920 a summer season of opera began. Within a few years 
the Zoo Summer Opera became nationally famous.  To the amusement of 
audiences, opera singers often had to compete with  choruses of Zoo 
wildlife. World famous stars performed over the years including Placido 
Domingo, Beverly Sills, as well as Cincinnatian James Levine, who 
conducted the last performance at the Zoo in 1971.  The following year 
the Opera moved from the Zoo to Music Hall.<p>

<P>
</B>In 1993, with the opening of Jungle Trails, wildlife exhibitry reached a new pinnacle.  Within this misty, vine-shrouded exhibit, designed by McCollow and Associates, Inc. of Cincinnati, Ohio, visitors are immersed in a rain forest habitat.  As they w

alk along a jungle trail, Asian and African primates and other animals bring the exotic rain forest world to life.  Orangutans and gibbons live in trees and bonobo chimpanzees frolic on a grassy hillside resembling their native African home.  All of these

 natural behaviors and environments help make the visitor develop a better understanding and a deeper appreciation for wild animals and their natural habitat..  The American Zoo & Aquarium Association agreed, awarding Jungle Trails its 1993 Exhibit Award.

<P>
<B>ENRICHED PRIMATE LIFESTYLE          </B><P>
In recent years, zoos have discovered that, along with proper diet and veterinary care, behavioral enrichment activities lead to healthier, more reproductive animal groups.  In designing Jungle Trails, the award-winning rain forest exhibit at the Cincinna

ti Zoo and Botanical Garden, a great deal of consideration was given to enhancing the lives of the intelligent primates that are housed there.<P>
The majority of primates have intricate and complex social structures, utilize a variety of vertical and horizontal climbing devices in their daily lives and view their surroundings, as humans do, in color.  Keeping these ideas in mind, the Cincinnati Zoo

 designed both indoor and outdoor exhibits to maximize its primate enrichment program, preventing boredom and monotony for these animated animals.<P>
In the early days of maintaining primates, it was believed that because of their vulnerability to human diseases, monkeys and their relatives needed to be kept in rather stark enclosures that could be easily maintained and sanitized.  This often resulted 

in relatively barren walls and climbing structures consisting of "metal monkey-bars."  However, because of advances in zoo veterinary care and exhibitry techniques which minimize these health concerns, the Jungle Trails visitor views each species in a re-

creation of its natural environment.<P>
Spacious outdoor grassy exhibits, complete with real and artificial trees and vines, allow for the development of groups of social primates.  Exhibits that display some of the more temperature
sensitive species have special heated sections, allowing these animals an extended season to enjoy the sights, sounds, smells and touch of the outdoors.<P>
Once colder weather sets in, the primates are moved to their interior exhibits featuring realistic, hand-painted dioramas, man-made trees, vines and rockwork, termite mounds and stream beds.  Here, the enrichment program continues to provide activity, cha

llenge and diversity throughout winter.<P>
Although the exhibits have supplemental lighting, each also has a large skylight to allow natural sunshine to play an important part in altering the animals' activity.  The natural movement of the sun, as well as the variety and unpredictability of cloud 

cover casts a variety of shadows in the displays and, as they do in the wild, the primates will need to reposition throughout the day if they wish to "sun" themselves.  <P>
Foraging for food occupies a great deal of time for many primates.  This natural behavior is encouraged in Jungle Trails by scattering food about in their enclosures.  A variety of seeds, nuts and raisins are used in both indoor and outdoor exhibits to pr

ovide hours of activity.<P>
In the bonobo chimp exhibit, we have developed a method of dispersing foraging material into the indoor exhibit by incorporating a series of plastic tubing into manmade tree branches, termite mounds and rockwork.  The food is placed into one of several ce

ntrally located tubes and, at a keeper's discretion, is blown through the tube by an air compressor into a pocketed area in the exhibit.  The bonobos soon learn that once they hear the sound of air swooshing through the tube, they will find some tasty sna

cks somewhere in the exhibit and the search begins.<P>
When making the artificial trees and termite mounds in the bonobo exhibit, the Zoo's in-house design team incorporated behavioral enrichment devices where they are most visible, thus <B><BR>
</B>allowing visitors to view behaviors once only seen in the wild by field researchers.  Various holes and crevices within the trees and termite mounds are filled with honey, peanut butter or similar substances which the animals can only retrieve with th

e use of "tools" such as twigs.<P>
Hopefully, by visiting a sophisticated and advanced exhibit such as Jungle Trails, where the emphasis is on closely mimicking the animal's natural habitats, our Zoo visitors gain a better understanding of and appreciation for these wonderful animals -- ma

n's closest relatives.  They will be able to see how these animals not only make use of their environment but have adapted to thrive there.<P>
<B>A GLIMPSE INTO RAIN FORESTS<P>
</B>Only covering about five percent of the earth's land mass, rain forests are home to over half of all plant and animal species.  Jungle Trails takes a close look at some of these marvelous animals.  When visitors can see these amazing animals in their 

own habitat, instead of in a tile cell with iron bars, they are able to witness the animals behaving and interacting as they would in the wild.  With detailed signage and environmental messages, zoo visitors learn about the complex and fragile rain forest

 ecosystems -- which hopefully leads to an understanding of the urgent need to save them.<P>
Year-round warm temperatures and heavy rainfall combine to make tropical rain forests richer in species than any other place on Earth.  In comparison to a temperate forest in Ohio where one might find 15 different kinds of trees, the number of tree specie

s in a rain forest would quadruple.<P>
Rain forests don't just happen, they develop.  It may take aeons of evolution or decades of caring conservation or, at the Cincinnati Zoo, years of planning, earth shaping, planting and artistry.  In November, 1991, the Zoo's renowned horticulture departm

ent began planting some 25,000 trees, shrubs, perennials, bulbs and groundcovers to create an outdoor "rain forest" that will become even more lush throughout the life of the exhibit.<P>
The botanical collection in Jungle Trails, worth about a half million dollars, recreates the habitats of the animals displayed.  A variety of tropical plantings, as well as hardy tropical look-alikes able to winter the Midwest, have been used to create a 

tropical forest.  Jungle Trails features some species of plants and trees never before displayed at the Zoo, including sandpaper plants, ramie plants, chittimwood trees and cassia shrubs.  Windmill palms and bananas add their exotic form and splendor thro

ughout the exhibit.  Showy groundcover plants carpet the forest floor along with ferns and stands of bamboo.<P>
Visitors enter Jungle Trails along a narrow forest trail lined with unusual flowering trees and shrubs, while akebia and berchemia vines festoon the slopes and neighboring plants.  Colorful orchids and other epiphytes grow in trees and rock outcrops.<P>
Continuing through the exhibit, a pair of gibbons swing through the trees on a small island surrounded by a monsoon forest, including exotic plantings like wingnut trees, bamboo, sandpaper plants and flowering magnolia.  Flowering vines grow through the c

anopy creating a colorful backdrop for visitors as they view the acrobatic apes.  The akebia vines produce large, purple fruits that are relished by several species of Asian monkeys.<P>
A shady, secluded nook overviews a pair of large, spectacular birds, called hornbills, in their forest setting surrounded by evergreen bamboos, towering trees and flowering vines.  Southern magnolias from the American South have been planted here and in o

ther areas of Jungle Trails because they resemble a number of diptocarp trees that are characteristic of Asian tropical forests.  Diptocarp trees are valued for their lumber and are a major reason that the forests of Southeast Asia are being so rapidly cu

t down.<P>
The trail continues further and enters a dense thicket of giant reeds.  Beyond is a jungle clearing, where several orangutans and gibbons clamber about in the trees and on the ground.  They are surrounded by a forest of toon trees, keaki trees, rubber tre

es, catalpas and crapemyrtle growing on a hilly slope.  Along the forest pathway, a variety of fascinating flowers, groundcovers, ferns and bamboo grow under the overhead tree canopy.  This simulated monsoon forest is dominated by catalpa trees, which hav

e been planted because their large leaves resemble the leaves of teak trees.  Teak, one of the most characteristic trees of India and Southeast Asia, is a very valuable lumber with a rich orange color and is very rot resistant.<P>
Further on, lion-tailed macaques climb about on the trees surrounded by a number of rare plants.  Some of these include thorny silkworm trees, the yellowhorn tree and umbrella magnolia.  Asian palms, bananas and other plants luxuriantly spill out over the

 walkway.<P>
The trail continues out onto a wooden boardwalk over a swampy exhibit area.  Here the large and peculiar shoebill storks and saddle-bill storks are found in a simulated African papyrus swamp.  Large plantings of giant reeds recreate these swamps along wit

h patches of real papyrus in the summer and masses of water lilies and Egyptian lotus.  Along the shores, exotic flowering hibiscus, corkwood, buttonbushes, groudsel bushes, peashrubs, mimosa trees and empress trees add colorful beauty.<P>
A number of unusual trees, shrubs and wildflowers grow in a lemur forest setting and represent the remarkably unique vegetation found on the island of Madagascar.  Some of these species include jujube trees, yellowood trees, pistache trees and bamboo.<P>
The extremely rare bonobo chimpanzees are found in Jungle Trails in a simulated African forest filled with trees, shrubs, vines and wildflowers.  Some of these include hardy oranges, sugar berry trees, golden-rain trees, trumpet vines and dutchman's pipe 

vines.  African dracaenas, palms, plumbago and Abyssinian bananas grow along the lush trail.<P>
The Debrazza's Guenon and Dik Dik antelope are surrounded by trees, including unusual species of hackberry trees.  In the wild, one of the favorite foods of black and white colobus monkeys are African hackberry leaves.  Hackberry trees have a wide range a

nd also grow in North America, Asia and Europe.  Several hardy species of hackberry have been planted in this area to simulate the African hackberry species, which are so important in the diets of colobus monkeys (which are on exhibit outside the African 

Building).<P>
The pathway enters into an exhibit building where fascinating indoor displays can be seen amid a recreated forest of artificial trees, rock outcrops and painted murals.  Further on outside, the pathway goes through steep banks covered with vines, orchids,

 ferns and other epiphytes.  A small pool along the way is filled with showy aquatic plants.  The trail continues up a hill through a lush growth of bamboos, magnolias and exotic foliage before reaching the end of the Jungle Trails exhibit.<P>
<BR>
Under a canopy of 100-foot trees, the rain forest shelters more than just wildlife.  Indigenous people have lived in tropical areas for thousands of years, reaping the bounty from the forest.  And still today, our own lives are tied to the jungles.  Over 

half of the pharmaceuticals available in modern drug stores have origins in plants in the tropics.  Tea, coffee, citrus fruits, tomatoes, and chocolates all originate in the tropics.<P>
The push to make people aware of these remote and fragile places is working.  Today, it is broadly recognized that Earth's rain forests play a major role in regulating global rainfall and climate patterns.  People also are coming to understand that widesp

read deforestation is adding drastically to the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, leading to increased global warming.<P>
Education is an integral part of the mission of the Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Garden.  With nearly a million and a half visitors every year, 10 percent of whom are school children, communication is a vital priority.  And the message is clear: it takes 

more than just experts and scientists to save wildlife.  People save species.  Wildlife is saved from the bottom up, with broad
based support compelling our "leaders" to get involved and draw the line.  As Margaret Mead says, "Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world.  Indeed it's the only thing that ever does."<P>
Conservation means using resources wisely, not just using them up.  Already one-half of the world's rain forests have been cut down, most in the last 50 years, and we don't even know what has been lost.  Conservation is not a four-letter word.  It does no

t mean we have to quit farming, logging, hunting, building and fishing.  It does mean we should pay attention, think ahead and act as if the future matters.<P>
The Cincinnati Zoo hopes that the Jungle Trails exhibit will give visitors a better appreciation of the rain forest and all of the life forms that exist in it, showing that conservation of these lush areas is of utmost importance. <BR>

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Timu, The World's First Test-tube Gorilla<BR>
Visits Dad in Omaha</H2>

<P> <IMG SRC="timu.gif" WIDTH="158" HEIGHT="181" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG=
"3"><BR>
<BR>
	Timu, the world's first test tube gorilla, left Cincinnati on Friday, August
23, 1996 to visit her father Mosuba at the Henry Doorly Zoo in Omaha. Mosuba
is the male gorilla whose sperm was used to fertilize (<I>in vitro)</I>
eggs from Rosie, a female gorilla at the Cincinnati Zoo. Timu was born October
9, 1995 and was cared for in the Zoo's Nursery until this trip.<BR>
</P>

<P>	Timu's birth was the result of assisted reproduction techniques conducted
by scientists at the Zoo's <B>Center for Research of Endangered Wildlife
(CREW)</B>, the College of Medicine at the University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati's
Christ Hospital, the Henry Doorly Zoo in Omaha, Nebraska, and Cincinnati's
Bethesda Hospital<B>.</B> These researchers are developing methods to assist
managing the lowland gorilla captive population in a manner that optimizes
genetic diversity and reproduction &shy; critical steps in preserving any
species.<BR>
</P>

<P>	Gorillas are just one of the many species with a shrinking gene pool
both in the wild and in captivity. When genetically valuable individuals
fail to reproduce naturally, assisted reproduction may be used to ensure
the production of offspring containing these important genes. Current reports
indicate that traditional management practices &shy; which historically
focused positive growth rates and the maintenance of a mentally and physically
healthy captive population &shy; now are broadening to include consideration
of genetic management.</P>

<P>	In addition, special emphasis is being placed on the collection and
cryopreservation (or banking) of sperm from animals of under represented
lineages. Therefore, the work of CREW scientists at the Cincinnati Zoo and
Botanical Garden is becoming even more important for conserving species
worldwide<BR>
</P>

<P>	Timu was an important step for wildlife conservation because her birth
used technology that will allow animals in captivity to contribute to the
growth of their species, even if they have not previously produced offspring.
However, it is necessary to understand that this technology alone can not
save endangered wildlife; more important is the preservation of natural
habitat of these endangered species.</P>

can become part of the solution.</P>

<P>These trips offer virtually everything for one price &shy; including
accommodations at some of the world's finest hotels, lodges and tented camps,
almost all meals, air fare from Cincinnati, professional naturalist/driver

<H1><FONT SIZE=+4>Windows to the Wild:<BR>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=+2>Cincinnati Zoo's 1997 Barrows Conservation Lecture
Series</FONT></H1>

<P><I>The task of reaching a jungle explorer who may be high up in a rain
forest canopy or an oceanographer 1,000 feet down in the ocean depths can
require some perseverance. But if their work didn't take them to these exciting
places, the lectures wouldn't offer the opportunity to explore the world
of wonder, from tigers in the forest to sharks in the sea.<BR>
</I></P>

<H3>Peter Matthiessen<BR>
February 6, 1997</H3>

<P>World famous author Peter Matthiessen bases the majority of his writing
on his personal travels. He writes about vanishing cultures, exotic wildlife
and landscapes, combining scientific observation with lyrical, intellectual
prose that connects the world of art and the world of the natural sciences.
Among his many fiction and non-fiction works are &quot;Wildlife In America,&quot;
&quot;The Cloud Forest: A Chronicle of the South American Wilderness,&quot;
&quot;Under the Mountain Wall,&quot; &quot;At Play In the Fields of the
Lord,&quot; &quot;Far Tortuga,&quot; &quot;The Snow Leopard,&quot; &quot;In
Sand Rivers,&quot; &quot;African Silences&quot; and &quot;In the Spirit
of Crazy Horse.&quot; Matthiessen's writings have been referred to as 'an
ecstatic contemplation of our beautiful and inexplicable planet.' Matthiessen's
current travels throughout Asia and India have been the basis of study on
cranes and tigers for his latest writings.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3>Dr. Russell Mittermeier<BR>
April 24, 1997</H3>

<P>A world leader in the field of tropical forest conservation, Mittermeier
has developed innovative programs for conserving environments and wildlife.
Equally important are his contributions to the study of monkeys, lemurs,
and other primates (hence his nickname &quot;Russell of the Apes&quot;)
and his work in herpetology. &quot;I was never really interested in being
anything other than a wildlife biologist,&quot; he has said. Today he ranks
as one of the top field researchers in the world. He has written five books
and more than 200 publications, and has assisted with several nature films.
Mittermeier's fluency in over six languages, along with his understanding
and respect of indigenous cultures, has played a vital role in his success
as a conservationist and biopolitician. He has significantly furthered primate
conservation and, indeed, the conservation of all species, everywhere on
earth. Dr. Russell Mittermeier has been chosen as the 1997 recipient of
the Cincinnati Zoo's Wildlife Conservation Award.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3>Dr. Warren Thomas<BR>
May 22, 1997</H3>

<P>Warren Thomas, D.V.M., began his career at the Columbus Zoo where he
assisted with the first captive gorilla birth. Later, as director of the
Oklahoma City Zoo, Henry Doorly Zoo, and the Gladys Porter Zoo his expertise
and vision was instrumental in their design, planning and growth as a zoological
institution. In 1974, he became Director of the Los Angeles Zoo where he
established an endangered species breeding program and one of the most respected
animal collections in the world. Dr. Thomas has been a consultant to many
U.S. zoos, as well as zoos in Canada, Peru, Mexico and Taiwan. He was instrumental
in setting up conservation efforts in Madagascar and directing a consortium
to save the Sumatran rhino in Indonesia. Dr. Thomas collaborated in the
writing of &quot;Dolphin Conferences and Elephant Midwives,&quot; and has
served as technical advisor for the TV series &quot;Peaceable Kingdom&quot;
and &quot;Zoo Life.&quot; His talk is entitled &quot;The Evolution of Zoos:
Gorillas I Have Known and Loved.&quot;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3>Dr. Sylvia Earle<BR>
August 21, 1997</H3>

<P>Dr. Sylvia Earle is known worldwide as an ambassador for the sea. During
her lifelong interest in underwater exploration, Earle has pioneered underwater
observations of dolphins and whales, and set new diving records while exploring
unknown waters throughout the world. She has led or participated in expeditions
totaling more than 6,000 hours underwater. She has already achieved a solo
descent to more than 3,000 feet and one of her goals is to reach the deepest
sea realm, &quot;Ocean Everest,&quot; seven miles down. Sylvia Earle is
the former chief scientist of the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric
Association, and is currently president of Deep Ocean Exploration and Research.
Her commitment to safeguarding the Earth's oceans along with her sense of
wonder and excitement about the living underwater world, opens our eyes
to the magnificence of what lies below the ocean's surface. In her book
&quot;Sea Change,&quot; she examines the impact humans are having on the
Earth's oceans and offers real suggestions for guaranteeing the survival
of the seas including the establishment of marine sanctuaries and protected
areas and the development of global policies recognizing the interdependence
of life and the need for nations to agree on measures to protect and maintain
the oceans.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H3>Dr. Daniel Janzen<BR>
November 20, 1997</H3>

<P>Prominent biologist and restoration ecologist Dr. Janzen has conducted
tropical field research since the early 1950s. A man who works tirelessly
at understanding and then educating about biodiversity, he was instrumental
in the establishment of the Guancaste National Park in Costa Rica &shy;&nbsp;which
expanded a small and severely threatened park of tropical dry forest into
a 120,000 hectare full-sized dry forest ecosystem. Dr. Janzen also helped
establish Costa Rica's National Biodiversity Institute which, under his
direction, is conducting a seven-year biodiversity inventory of the Guancaste
Conservation Area now estimated at 230,000 species. Working closely with
the Costa Rican government, Dr. Janzen has facilitated the initiation of
national legislation for the sustainability of wildland biodiversity. Based
out of the University of Pennsylvania, Dr. Janzen has written more than
300 scientific papers and edited two multi-authored volumes about tropical
biology. Costa Rica has become a conservation role model and it is through
the work of Dr. Janzen that many of these conservation initiatives have
met with such astounding success.</P>

<h3>Take a look around you.  Can there be any doubt that we are 
part of a delicate system.  Life on the planet is a mysterious intricate web 
that we call the biosphere.  The story of our own survival is written there.  
To deny that fact is to ignore the most basic of truths:  that we are made of 
flesh and blood.</h3>

Diversity.  It's what makes  this planet such an interesting place.  But one
species is crowding out every other living thing on the planet.  And nothing
can replace an animal once it  is gone.  Take a closer look at the creatures
who share the world with us.  They are disappearing before our
eyes.

<h3>Every ecosystem begins and ends with plants.  They provide abundant
resources that we rely on every day:  medicines, food and oxygen.  These are
things that we know.  What we cannot measure is the vast potential that may
never be realized if they are lost.  Without plants, we have no future.

About Our Text Only Version
</center>
Many people have been asking for a text only version for many reasons: faster
response time, can only access via a program such as Lynx, and for disability
reasons.  We feel that we certainly cannot leave them out, and so we are
undertaking making our information available in this form.  <P>

<B>Most</B> of the pages that you encounter will be the same as the full
version.  There is always a banner on the top of the page that include two
images, and those include tags to be available to a text only reader.  If you
find a page that needs to have the text only portion of it touched up. Please
send email to <a
href="mailto:webmaster@cincyzoo.org">webmaster@cincyzoo.org</a> and let me
know. Comment are also welcome. Thanks.<P><P><P>

<HEAD><TITLE>Help on Making Queries</TITLE></HEAD>
<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" TEXT="#000000" LINK="#FF0000" ALINK="#0000FF">
<A NAME="Making Queries"></A><H1>Making Queries</H1>
Excite for Web Servers gives web users access to a sophisticated concept-based
searching engine. But even though the search engine is advanced, users
can form queries without using a complicated query language. This page
will help you to choose the queries that will give you the best
results.
<P>
<A NAME="Query Basics"></A><H2>Query Basics</H2>
A query is simply a description of an information need. Unlike Boolean
systems that search for just those documents containing <I>all</I> the
words in your query, Excite for Web Servers will search for documents that are a
best match for the words in your query. Excite for Web Servers will also search for
documents that are about the same concepts that your query describes,
so sometimes Excite for Web Servers will bring back articles that don't mention
<I>any</I> of the words in your original query.
<P>
What this means is that your query -- the description of your
information need -- can be as detailed as you like. Don't worry about
providing too many words; the more words, the better. Additional words
in your query will help Excite for Web Servers figure out what concepts you're
really interested in. On the other hand, Excite for Web Servers will do a pretty
good job of figuring out what documents are interesting to you even if
your query is vague.
<P>
For example, let's say you're searching a web site for documents about
customer support for the Widget2000 product you're using. A good
starting point would be
<P>
<PRE>
        customer support for the Widget2000
</PRE>

If you have a question about a particular feature of the Widget2000,
for example the Blurfl upgrade package, you might choose a query like
<P>
<PRE>
        customer support for the Blurfl upgrade package
        of the Widget2000
</PRE>

Even if there are no documents that are actually about the Blurfl
upgrade, Excite for Web Servers will still show you documents about Widget2000
customer support.
<P>
<A NAME="Advanced Query Tips"></A><H2>Advanced Query Tips</H2>
Here are some suggestions for getting the best results out of
Excite for Web Servers.
<p>
<b>Use More Words</b>
<br>
The easiest way to narrow your Excite for Web Servers search and the first thing
you should try is to simply use more words in your query.  The
greater the detail you provide, the better Excite for Web Servers is able to find
precisely what you're looking for.  Also try using the
Query
By Example</A> option on the search results page.
<p>
<b>Use + to Require Words</b>
<br>
 Put a <A HREF="#anchor1">plus sign (+)</A> in front of a search word and Excite for Web Servers
 will
make sure that ALL of the documents it returns contain the word.
 Example search: Travel +France.
<p>
<b>Use - to Exclude Words</b>
<br>
Put a <A HREF="#anchor2">minus sign (-)</A> in front of a search word and Excite for Web Servers
 will make sure that NONE of the documents it returns contain the word.
 Example search: Jaguar -car -automobiles.
<p>
<b>Use AND, OR, NOT, AND NOT, ( )</b>
<br>
Excite for Web Servers supports full <A HREF="#anchor3">Boolean operators</A> and syntax.  You c
an use the AND, OR, NOT, and AND NOT operators, and parentheses ( ) for grouping
.  Example search: swimming AND (man OR woman).<p>
<hr>
<p>
<A NAME="anchor1"></A><b>Using a Plus Sign (+) to Require Words</b>
<p>
<b>What it does:</b>
<br>
Excite for Web Servers will make sure that ALL of the documents it finds include
the word(s) you specify as being required.

<p>
<b>How to use it:</b>
<br>
In your search text, put a plus sign (+) in front of words that
must be in documents that Excite for Web Servers finds.  Do not put a space between
the plus sign (+) and the word.  For example, to find documents
about hockey, but only those with the term NHL in them you could
enter:
<p>
hockey +NHL
<p>
<b>What's different about it:</b>
<br>
Without the plus sign (+), Excite for Web Servers looks for documents about any
of the words in your search text.  Excite for Web Servers will rank documents
that have all of the words higher, but will also list documents
that have only some of your search words as well as documents
that may have none of your search words, but that appear to be

conceptually related.
<p>
<b>The downside:</b>
<br>
You may miss related documents that don't have the words you specify
as required.  For example, the search &quot;hockey +NHL&quot;
would not include documents that have the words National Hockey
League, but not NHL.
<p>
<hr width=50% align=center>
<p>
<A NAME="anchor2"></A><b>Using a Minus Sign (-) to Exclude Words</b>
<p>
<b>What it does:</b>
<br>
Excite for Web Servers will make sure that NONE of the documents it finds contain
any word(s) you specify to exclude.
<p>
<b>How to do it:</b>
<br>
In your search text, put a minus sign (-) in front of words that
must not be in documents that Excite for Web Servers finds. Do not put any space
between the minus sign (-) and the word. For example, if you want
to find documents about zeppelin aircraft but not the rock band
Led Zeppelin, you could enter: Zeppelin -Led<BR>
<p>
<b>What's different about it:</b>
<br>
Without the minus sign (-), Excite for Web Servers looks for documents that are
conceptually-related to all the search words you provide, rather
than looking for items to exclude from the results.
<p>
<b>The downside:</b>
<br>
It's easy to exclude too much. For example, if you were looking
for information on greyhound dogs and not the bus company, the
search &quot;greyhound -bus&quot; would exclude a document that
was all about greyhounds, but that had the sentence &quot;the
greyhound trainers arrived by bus.&quot;
<p>
<hr width=50% align=center>
<p>
<A NAME="anchor3"></A><b>Boolean Operators: AND, OR, NOT and ()</b>
<p>
<b>What they do/How to use them:</b>
<br>
<b>AND</b> - Documents found must contain all words joined by the AND
operator. Note that this is equivalent to putting a plus sign
(+) in front of the word. For example, to find documents that
have all of the words wizard, oz and movie, you could enter: wizard
AND oz AND movie
<p>
<b>OR</b> - Documents found must contain at least one of the words joined
by OR. For example, to find documents that have either the words cat
or kitten you could enter: cat OR kitten
<p>
<b>AND NOT</b> - Documents found cannot contain the word after the term AND NOT.
 Note that this is equivalent to putting a minus sign
(-) in front of the word. For example, to find documents that
have the word pets, but not the word dogs, you could enter: pets
AND NOT dogs
<p>
<b>( )</b> - Parentheses are used to group portions of Boolean queries
together. For example, to find documents that have the word fruit, and either
the word banana or the word apple in them, you could enter: fruit
AND (banana OR apple)
<p>
<b>What's different about it:</b>
<br>
Allows for excluding and requiring words, and complex combinations
of words.
<p>
<b>The downside:</b>
<br>
It's often difficult to specify exactly what you want to include
or exclude. You can also get unexpected results if you are not
careful about your use of operators and parentheses. For example,
the search bananas OR apples AND oranges is the same as the search
bananas OR (apples AND oranges). Both queries will find documents
that contain both apples and oranges, together with documents
that contain the word bananas. However, the query (bananas OR

apples) AND oranges is not the same. It will find documents containing
the word oranges and, in the same document, either bananas or
apples. Be careful out there!

</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<I>By <B>Penny Geary</B>, Conservation Program Coordinator</I></P>

<P>The Cincinnati Zoo's conservation efforts include support of The Ituri
Fund which helps the Lese and Efe people of Andisengi in the Ituri Forest
of Zaire establish schools and provide health care services for themselves.
The assistance provided them has been used wisely. By providing education
resources to the local people, they will have the tools to protect their
own livelihood and their forest in which a great diversity of wildlife,
such as the okapi, chimpanzee, and congo peafowl co-exist.</P>

<P>Two of the four directors of the Ituri Fund, David Wilkie and Gilda Morelli
(other directors are Robert Bailey and Bryan Curran), spent their summer
in the Ituri Forest and reported the progress these indigenous peoples have
made in supporting their children's education. Two more school buildings
have been built and two additional teachers hired. Community support has
been tremendous and 215 children now attend primary school, grades 1-6.</P>

<P>The Efe people so recognize the value of education that they have set
up living arrangements for 12 of the children so they may stay in school
during the time their parents go deep into the forest to harvest honey.
The children have gotten involved in their future by growing crops of cassava
&shy; a nutritious root. The children keep half of the cassava for their
families and grind the rest to a powder, which they sell on the roadside
to raise money for school supplies.</P>

<P>A parent leader, Ngutcha, is a driving force behind these improvements.
In hopes of replacing the mud schools now in use, he recently contacted
the owners of a closed plantation to inquire about dismantling vacant buildings
in order to recycle usable parts to build a permanent school. Ngutcha regularly
bicycles 120 km to pick up the teachers' salaries, notebooks, and pencils.</P>

<P>The children learn Swahili in the primary grades, and add French to the
coursework in the secondary grades. The schools focus on literacy and enumeration,
and also teach geography, ecology, and the history of African people. After
children complete six years of secondary school they can go to the 2 to
3-year technical schools that teach nursing (primary health care) and truck/car
mechanics. Unfortunately, the teacher training colleges and universities
that were once run by the state are basically closed.</P>

<P>Literacy and computation skills last a lifetime, and now these children
can defend their families from unscrupulous individuals who heretofore appropriated
their goods with false documents. In the future, these children will be
able to become involved in development planning which affects their resources,
traditional practices, and autonomy. For now, they help their parents in
the marketplace, and are able to understand the government rulings which
affect their family.</P>

<P>These schools desperately need books. For example, the geography text
now in use dates back to the 1940s! A direct contribution can also be made
using the following form. The children of the Ituri greatly appreciate your
gift.</P>

It took us more than 2,000 miles by plane, 22 miles by ferry, 
and over 900 by car (we took the scenic route) to reach Port 
McNeill on northern 
<a href="http://www.islandnet.com/~cvcprod/victoria.html"> 
Vancouver Island</a> in British Columbia. We arrived without 
reservations and, it would seem, without a room as well. But 
the second (and last) hotel "has one room left"and we set up 
our base camp.<p>

<CENTER>
<IMG SRC="ecotourism.gif" ALT "Killer Whales">
<h5>Once persectuted as &quot;killers&quot;, Orcas (or Killer Whales)
now draw tens of thousands of visitors to northern waters.</h5>
</CENTER>


 We have traveled this distance, paid our fares, tolls, and 
 taxes with one primary objective: to see killer whales in 
 the wild.<p>
 
 Yet there is a second objective as well. We have come to see 
 not only the whales themselves, but to also see how the 
 popularity of these charismatic "sea pandas" (as our witty 
 boat captain calls them) has boosted the northern Vancouver 
 Island economy. Amidst declining salmon yields and the 
 questionable ecological impact of current timber practices, 
 the economy of this little port is thriving. The reason? 
 People come to see the whales. Ecotourism has arrived in 
 Port McNeill and Ð as it has in many other ports, peaks, 
 and plains Ð it is providing direct economic incentive for 
 the preservation of wild species and the wild spaces they 
 need to survive.<p>
 
 The World Wildlife Fund defines ecotourism as "tourism 
 designed to protect natural areas as a means of economic 
 gain through natural resource preservation." This economic 
 gain is no small pennies.<p>
 
 Travel is the second largest industry in the world and 
 produces more than $200 billion in revenue each year worldwide. 
 Ecotourism is the fastest growing segment of this business Ð 
 growing at the rate of 30 percent each year. For a growing 
 number of countries, ecotourism has provided not only a positive 
 economic boost, but also has given them reason to protect and 
 preserve their wildlife and the often fragile ecosystems in 
 which they live.<p>

 For example, the East African country of Kenya, one of the 
 global leaders in ecotourism, receives more $400 million 
 from tourism each year Ð a very strong incentive to maintain 
 the wild savannahs with healthy populations of wildlife.<p>

 <a href="http://www.yahoo.com/Regional/Countries/Costa_Rica/">Costa 
 Rica</a>, in Central America, has caught on to the idea that 
 tropical rain forest habitats can earn more long-term money 
 intact than cut. Since 1970, Costa Ricans have set aside nearly 
 30 percent of their small country's land in national parks, 
 preserves, and private wildlife sanctuaries. By 1986, tourists 
 were spending nearly $140 million per year to experience some 
 of the incredible biodiversity in this country which is only 
 half the size of the state of Ohio.  <p>

 For some areas ecotourism wields a double-edged sword. The 
 Galapagos Islands, off the coast of Ecuador, have become 
 such popular ecotourist destinations that conservationists 
 fear the impact of so many visitors will disrupt the fragile 
 nature of the archipelago. The government has set limits on 
 the number of visitors to the islands and strictly controls 
 the access and activities of visitors to these sensitive ecosystems.<p>
 
 You don't necessarily even need a passport to visit some of 
 the planet's most popular ecotourism sites. In 1872, 
 <a href="http://www.webcom.com/earthtlk/earthscience.html">
 Yellowstone National Park</a> was set aside for future 
 generations to enjoy the unique geological and biological 
 features. Today, more than 10 million of those future 
 generations visit the 14 million-acre Greater Yellowstone 
 Ecosystem, bringing in $1 billion to the state of Wyoming 
 alone. It was the support of many of those visitors that 
 helped push the return of the wolf to its ancestral range.<p>
 
 Just as ecotourism is a major part of the travel industry, 
 "birding" is a big part of ecotourism. The money birders 
 spend searching for their feathered quarry provides strong 
 economic incentive for preserving critical bird habitat. 
 The geography of Cape May, New Jersey has made it an 
 important stopover point for spring migrants and a natural 
 funnel for hawks and other migrants in the fall. Birders 
 flock to this small community during both seasons and 
 contribute $10 million dollars to the local economy while 
 they're at it.<p>
 
 Money spent while on an ecotour goes far beyond the guide 
 and tour company you're with. Hotels, campgrounds, 
 transportation companies, restaurants, gift shops and, 
 of course, film suppliers all benefit from these tourism 
 dollars. <p>
 
 Perhaps more importantly, though, preserving ecosystems 
 for ecotourism may provide benefits less quantifiable 
 than money (but no less vital) for local communities. 
 Protecting a watershed may ensure a clean source of water 
 year round and reduce the risks of floods and loss of 
 topsoil from erosion. Careful management may permit regular 
 harvest of sustainable products and resources (plant and 
 animal) from the region. Large protected areas allow natural 
 selection to maintain the genetic health of populations of 
 wildlife. And lastly, in many ecotourism destinations 
 preserving the environment may also aid in preserving the 
 integrity of the human cultures who have adapted to survive 
 there as well.<p>
 Ecotourism is no panacea. It alone cannot save the diversity 
 of life on Earth. But by placing some extrinsic economic 
 value on the plants and animals that make up a natural 
 ecosystem, hopefully, it will maintain their integrity 
 until we realize the intrinsic value of wild species and 
 wild spaces.  Our draw to these slices of wilderness our 
 sense of wonder for the world around us may be what Henry 
 David Thoreau was thinking about when he penned, "in 
 wildness is the preservation of the world."

<i>By <b>David Oehler</b>, Aviculture</i><p>

The Cincinnati Zoo's Aviculture Department has embarked on a  mission of restoring Blue &amp; Gold Macaws, Ara ararauna, back into the wilds of Trinidad.  Project coordinators David Oehler and Bernadette Plair have been working with Trinidad's Division of


 Wildlife/Forestry Division to reintroduce the macaws back into their historic range within the Nariva Swamp, located on the east side of this Caribbean Island.  Blue &amp; Gold Macaws once flew freely over this area before the wild population was extirpa


ted due to the pressures of over-collecting for the pet industry.<p>

<IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="macaw.gif">

Steve Malowski, of the Zoo's Aviculture Department, traveled to Trinidad in August, 1995 to assist the rangers in setting up a group of captive macaws into potential breeding pairs; constructing a bird blind and release flight in the swamp; coordinating a


n educational effort between the Forestry Division and the Emperor Valley Zoo, Trinidad; and to observe the local registration program for macaws in private hands in Trinidad.  Previous visits by Zoo staff were made to assist the Forestry Division in the 


surgical sexing and care of the captive flock.<P>
     The Nariva Swamp was once the center of the historical range of the macaws on Trinidad.  This lush tropical swamp still supports the many palm trees and other fruiting vegetation that the macaws would naturally feed upon.  The local government has se


t this area aside as a reserve to protect other birds endangered in Trinidad such as the Red-bellied Macaw, Ara manilata, and to protect the manatees that inhabit the waters of the swamp.<P>
     Working with the Centre for the Rescue of Endangered Species of Trinidad &amp; Tobago (CRESTT), the Forestry Division approached the Cincinnati Zoo for assistance in reintroducing Blue &amp; Gold Macaws two years ago and the project began to develop.


  The first step was to have a ranger from the Forestry Division of Trinidad trained in the care of the macaws during a visit to Cincinnati in 1993.  Our Veterinary Staff, led by Dr. Mark Campbell, staged an Avian Seminar in Trinidad to train the veterina


rians and rangers to properly care for, handle and surgically sex the birds.  <P>
     Bernadette Plair, a Research Associate with CREW and board member with CRESTT, has been assisting in the evaluation of the plant life to see what damage recent fires may have done in the Nariva Swamp.  Her report was positive and laid the foundation 


for the next step, the construction of the release flight and an observation platform for the future release of macaws that will be produced in the next several months.<P>
     Steve Malowski's expedition has proven successful.  They completed a large flight and blind which the rangers will use to observe the future release of macaws.  An education program -- that will be coordinated between the Forestry Division, the Emper


or Valley Zoo, CRESTT, and our own Education Department -- will educate the local residents and, hopefully, instill a sense of pride in having such wonderful birds flying over their land.  All seven pairs of Blue &amp; Gold Macaws were set up in breeding 


enclosures and provided with proper nest-sites and food items.  The offspring produced will be surgically sexed, permanently identified with the implantation of microchips and leg bands and then be conditioned for their life in the wilds of Trinidad.<P>
     The Aviculture Department would like to thank the many benefactors that made this program possible.  Our deepest thanks to long-time supporter Ed Thayer whose love of birds was matched by his generous support and enthusiasm.<P>

<p>In 1980, the editors of Harvard Magazine asked a number of Harvard professors what they considered the most important problem facing the world.  One scholar, evolutionary biologist Dr. E. O. Wilson choose the loss of the world’s biological diversity.  
He stated that “the one process ongoing that will take millions of years to correct is the loss of genetic and species diversity by the destruction of natural habitats.  This is the folly our descendants are least likely to forgive us.”  Since 1980, the b
iodiversity crisis has continued to cut away the safety net which keeps ecosystems functioning to maintain life on Earth as we know it.   Scientists today estimate that we are losing approximately six species each hour; that is equal to 50,000 species per
 year.  Most of these species doomed to extinction are small, unseen creatures which are difficult to study and hardly ever displayed in zoos.  However, what we can see is that most of the big cats, the great rhino species, the majority of migratory birds
, avariety of amphibian species and many other forms of life familiar to us are in decline.  These endangered creatures we study in the wild and enjoy learning about in zoos are today indicators of a much greater crisis. Kathryn Fuller, president of World
 Wildlife Fund, states that “biodiversity experts indicate that we are experiencing an extinction wave of greater scale and impact than at any time in recorded history.</p>
<H3>What is Biodiversity</H3>
<p>Biodiversity is the word commonly used to describe the incredible variety of life on Earth.  From the huge blue whale to mites riding on the back of an ant, scientists have discovered 1,400,000 different species of life on Earth.  This may sound like a
 lot, but in truth it is only a small percentage of the plants, animals, and microorganisms that exist in yet unstudied habitats.  In total, scientists estimate there may be between 30 and 100 million species on Earth.  Biodiversity is more than just spec
ies, however.  It encompasses all plant, animal, and microorganism species, the genes that comprise them, as well as the ecosystems (rain forests, deserts, wetlands, woodlands, coral reefs, etc.) and ecological processes of which they are a part.  Therefo
re, when  a species becomes extinct, we loose not only the organism but the role it played in an ecological community.</p>
<H3>Why Is It Important to Protect Biodiversity?</H3>
<p>Most of us don’t often think about how much we depend upon the three-tiered hierarchy of biodiversity: species, genes, and ecosystems.  Ecosystems, for example, do more than provide a home for species - they purify our water, clean our air, generate ox
ygen for us to breathe, recycle nutrients, and even regulate our climate. Genes from wild tomatoes, rice, corn, and other crops help improve the varieties grown by farmers.  The list of biodiversity benefits goes on and on, and we all depend on species, e
cosystems, and genes for food, recreation, medicines, and much more.  No matter what you call it, biodiversity, the web of life, or the circle of life, it is, as Dr. Wilson states, the Earth’s safety net and we need to protect it.<p>
<H3>How Can People Help Slow the Loss of Biodiversity?</H3>
<p>Protecting biodiversity is very complex work, but it isn’t as hard as it sounds.  We must first work to understand the connections among living things.  The Cincinnati Zoo is your “window to the wild,” providing a glimpse of the vast diversity of life 
on Earth.  Through our education programs, we are committed to utilizing our collection of wild plants and animals to show Zoo visitors the importance of biodiversity, and how each of us can take effective action to help preserve natural ecosystems.  Ulti
mately, the job of protecting biodiversity is up to everyone in every walk of life - scientists, teachers, political and religious leaders, farmers, attorneys, and children need to get involved.  Every day people can help by working to protect natural hab
itat “in our own backyard.”  When we practice simple conservation in our daily lives by using less resources, we teach our children to respect nature and the environment by example: our most powerful tool.</p>

<P>Tropical forests circle the globe, and have even been called the Earth's
emerald necklace. The rain forest is one of the planet's oldest and most
stable ecosystems. Combine longevity with a kind climate, and the result
is a place teeming with one-half of all the plants and animals in the world.
Yet these forests cover only 5% of the Earth's land. Imagine so much life
in so little space.</P>

<P>The rain forests must be protected, to preserve the life that is found
there, and to sustain the quality of our lives as well. Look at all of the
animals, medicines, food sources and climate stability we gain from a healthy
rain forest.</P>

<H3>Diversity of Life</H3>

<P>So many species of plants and animals are found only in the tropical
rain forests of South and Central America, Africa and Asia. Imagine half
of all species are found in this small percentage of the Earth's land surface.
Not only are there so many species, but there are so many that are not found
anywhere else.</P>

<H3>Species found only in rain forests...</H3>

<P>Volumes of species of plants and animals that are found in rain forests
have very limited ranges. Many are found only on a single mountain, inhabit
a sole island or find a home only inside the protected boundaries of one
park. This type of distribution of life is called endemic distribution &shy;
species that occur nowhere else in the world.</P>

<P>Tropical forests are home to millions of species of plants and animals.
A single park in Costa Rica contains more than twice as many species of
animals as are found in the entire state of California. One volcano in the
Philippines has more types of woody plants living on it than the entire
continent of North America. Many of these plants and animals have very limited
ranges and they are extremely vulnerable when the forest is threatened.</P>

<P>The island of Madagascar is an incredible example of endemic distribution
of plants and animals. Due to millions of years of geographic isolation
thousands of species of plant and animal life have evolved in very distinct
forms and are found only on this island. A unique group of primates called
lemurs are represented by 22 species, and all but two species are found
only on Madagascar, while the remaining two specie's ranges spread to a
nearby island.</P>

<P>Due to this phenomenon of endemism, rain forests are crucial in the survival
of life on Earth.</P>

<H3>A Natural Medicine Chest</H3>

<P>In addition to being home for millions of species of plants and animals,
the rain forest stores a wealth of plants used to make many of the pharmaceuticals
we use everyday. At least half of all medicines used are plant derived.
When we look at all of the prescription drugs that are employed to keep
us healthy, a quarter of them are derived from plants from the rain forest.
Science has had time to analyze only a tiny percentage of tropical plants
for disease fighting properties the plants may harbor.</P>

<P>An example of a landmark find is a small flower from the forests of Madagascar,
the rosy periwinkle. Drugs derived from this unassuming little flower have
resulted in 80% remission rates in Hodgkin's disease and 99% remission in
childhood leukemia cases. Before this plant's properties were known, less
than 20% of people afflicted with these diseases ever recovered.</P>

<P>Many medicines that we take quite for granted such as cortisone and hydrocortisone
are the backbone of a hospital pharmacies inventory for fighting arthritis,
allergies, Addison's disease and many other ailments. All of these cortisone
based products are derived from diosgenin, a compound that is produced by
a tropical plant called the Mexican yam.</P>

<P>As we can see, the value of plants from the rain forests to help us and
our families directly is amazing. Imagine where we would be without these
wonder drugs. Consider where we're going if we don't take a closer look
at what the forest has to offer us. Less than ten percent of the plant species
have been analyzed by botanists for their medicinal value and they are disappearing
fast!</P>

<H3>A Nutritional Warehouse</H3>

<P>Do you love banana splits, crave chocolate or dig a cheeseburger in paradise?
Then we better keep the rain forest around for these and many other food
sources.</P>

<P>Foods we take for granted, such as chocolate and bananas, are from the
tropical forests. Our domestic cattle were bred from the wild banteng cattle
of Java, and chickens are descendants of Asian jungle fowl. Tomatoes originated
in South America, coffee in Africa. Nearly everything on your grocery store
shelf probably has its origin in tropical habitats, and many of those very
foods are still only grown in the tropics.</P>

<P>A cornucopia of food sources are waiting to be fully appreciated and
many more can be utilized to improve and strengthen both well-known plants
and animals. Some of the more recent exciting discoveries are a tasty vine
from Asia which produces a fruit juice that has 18 times more vitamin C
than orange juice. There is the possibility a species of wild corn, a relative
to domestic corn, may have properties which could improve disease resistance
in our corn crops. We aren&iacute;t the only ones who rely on a corn crop
for food, most of our livestock industry uses corn to feed cattle, pigs
and many other kinds of animals that we in turn depend on.</P>

<P>Speaking of livestock, there are many wild species of bovine, cattle-like
animals, that are found in the forests of Asia. Some of these such as the
anoa and the gaur could genetically enhance the common varieties of cattle
that we have on American farms. Many of these wild species are resistant
to disease, can live on poorer diets in harsher climates and can be easier
on the land by not overgrazing.</P>

<P>When you consider that we produce 90% of what we eat from about twenty
species of plants, it only makes good sense to fully explore what the tropical
forest has to add to the menu!</P>

<H3>Lungs for the Planet</H3>

<P>The rain forest provides us with volumes fresh air and fresh water. The
great tracks of trees inhale massive quantities of carbon dioxide and exhale
oxygen. The result is a degree of atmospheric stability that cannot be replaced
by any manmade technology.</P>

<P>We burn millions of tons of fossil fuel in our cars and factories producing
huge amounts of pollution in the form of carbon dioxide and monoxide and
other noxious gases. As these levels of gases increase in our atmosphere
beyond natural levels, the phenomenon of global warming from the &quot;greenhouse
effect&quot; is a problem that needs to be addressed.</P>

<P>It just so happens that we have a place to go with all of this excess
carbon dioxide and monoxide. Tropical forests are capable of inhaling vast
quantities of gases through the process of photosynthesis. Photosynthesis
is how plants take energy from the sun and carbon from the atmosphere to
build compounds like sugar and starch which in turn are used to make their
leaves, roots, limbs and all their plant parts! All the while these carbon
conversion factories known as plants are cranking out a lot of good clean
oxygen for all of us to use and naturally controlling the greenhouse effect.</P>

<P>As little as 2.5 acres of rain forest can exhale 30 tons of pure oxygen
in one year! Now you know why the tropical rain forests are &quot;lungs
for the planet.&quot;</P>

<H3>Now You Know</H3>

<P>The tropical forests of the world warehouse so many crucial resources
that it seems obvious this natural wealth needs to be conserved. Plants
for food and medicine, half of all animals, and massive amounts of fresh
air and water are all part of the Earth's vibrant emerald necklace &shy;
the rain forest.</P>

<P>Rain forests are being destroyed at an alarming rate. Now that we know
the problem what is the solution? Everyone can do their part whether it
is recycling, conserving energy or simply being aware that there is a problem
that needs to be solved.</P>

<P>People in the nations where there are tropical rain forests need to be
part of the solution by learning agricultural practices that do not depend
on slash and burn agriculture. Profits can be made from all the products
the rain forest can provide us. Income can be produced by encouraging travel
to parks in these areas. People need to use the land to survive as well,
we just need to learn to use it wisely.</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER>&quot;Never doubt that a small group of concerned citizens
can change the world, indeed it the only thing that ever has.&quot;</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER>Anthropologist Margret Meade</P>

<H2>Layers of the Forest</H2>

<P>Animal and plant species find their own &quot;niche&quot; in their habitats.
A niche provides all of the ecological requirements the species needs to
live &shy; requirements such as food, water, shelter and space. Here in
their niche, species fill a role in the community where they are found.
Some are predators while others are herbivores. Some form unique partnerships
with other species, providing the services of seed dispersal, pollination
or even protection.</P>

<P>The trees in the rain forest can be over 100 feet in height. If you were
to ride up the tree on a biological elevator you would see much of the life
around you change every 30 to 50 feet. Each layer of the forest has its
own climate with temperature, sunlight, humidity and even wind changing
from layer to layer.</P>

<P>The <B>forest floor</B> is ground level on our elevator tour of a tropical
forest. Sunlight is often in short supply as it is blocked out by layers
of trees, vines and other plants towering above. There are many sounds,
rhythms and choruses from insects and frogs and birds that call from far
overhead but are rarely seen. The dimly lit interior is inhabited by animals
both small and large occupying their role in the forest floor community.</P>

<P>The next stop is the <B>understory</B> at 30 to 60 feet. At this first
level from the ground floor are found animals that may only be visiting
the trees, and many animals that regularly visit the ground. Animals like
the highly intelligent bonobo and gorilla will forage on the ground and
in the trees for fruit and leaves and return to the trees at night to sleep
in safety. Animals of the rain forest have a wide menu to choose from and
often become very specialized in their diet. Animals that feed on fruit
are called <I>frugivores</I>. If their diet is made up of leaves, as in
the case of they silvered langur monkey, they are termed <I>folivores</I>
while animals that have a combined diet like humans are defined as <I>omnivores</I>.
<I>Carnivores</I> are predators like the golden cat who patrol the forest
floor and the understory in search of prey in the form of small mammals
and birds.</P>

<P>The <B>canopy layer</B> of the forest ranges from 60 to 90 feet where
sunlight is now available in abundance. Most of the animals that are found
here can be described as arboreal or tree dwelling species. Arboreal species
are adapted to spending most or all of their lives in trees, rarely coming
to the ground for any reason. Some of their adaptations are long fingers
and hands for grasping branches and limbs, lanky arms for a long reach,
feet that may have the ability to hold on. Birds at this layer not only
have the ability of flight but often have strong beaks and feet for climbing
about their canopy home.</P>

<P>The top floor of our rain forest tour is the <B>emergent layer</B> which
starts at about 90 feet and extends to the tips of the tallest trees in
the forest which soar to well above 100 feet. Here are animals that fly
high over the forest such as the crowned eagle who crashes into lower forest
layers when the opportunity for a kill presents itself. Many primates like
the white-cheeked gibbon with its long arms, extended hands and fingers
swing from branch to branch. This highly specialized type of locomotion,
swinging through the trees, is called brachiation.</P>

<P>At the Zoo's rain forest exhibit, Jungle Trails, you can observe a diverse
array of animals from the layers of African and Asian rain forests living
in large displays that resemble their homes in the wild.</P>

Conservation Issues In The US
</CENTER></H1>


<P>We live in a world of immense beauty and wonder.  It is a living system
that has a phenomenal capacity to heal itself.  That’s why it’s easy to lose
sight of the fact that the planet is facing some grave environmental
problems.  They are complex, varied and solely of our making.  Here are a
few of the major issues we face right here in the United States and some
possible solutions.</P>

<H2>The Land:</H2>

<H4>The Problem:  Solid Waste</H4>

<P>Most of our waste is generated by the elaborate packaging and containers
of the products we buy.  It’s also made up of yard waste in the form of
leaves and clippings, paper from offices, and the general waste from living
in a country that values the convenience of disposable items.  The average
American produces one-half ton of garbage each year.  We’re running out of
places to put it all.</P>

<P><STRONG>What Can You Do:</STRONG>  Buy products that don’t yield as much
waste.  Recycle your yard waste, cans and bottles.  The City of Cincinnati
offers curbside recycling of yard waste as well ass drop-off centers.</P>

<H2>The Water:</H2>

<H4>The Problem:  Polluted Groundwater</H4>

<P>Inadequate waste disposal practices, agricultural runoff and industrial
waste are polluting our groundwater.  It is estimated that we use around 89
billiion gallons of water each day in the United States.  In many areas, we
are using far more than what is replaced by rainfall.  We are not the only
living things that depend on clean water to live.  Our wetlands are one of
our most endangered ecosystems in the counrty, putting our creatures that
live there at seriuos risk.</P>

<P><STRONG>What Can You Do:</STRONG>  Conserve water.  Get involved in local
clean-up efforts.  Support legislation that protects our waterways.  Donât
use pesticides.</P>



<H2>The Air:</H2>

<H4>The Problem:  Smog</H4>

<P>The exhaust from our cars and other pollutants react with nitrogen oxides
and hydrocarbons in the sunlight to form ground level ozone.  It contributes
to the Greenhouse Effect, damages crops, kills vegetation and affects our
health.</P>

<P><STRONG>What Can You Do:</STRONG>  Conserving fossil fuels is one of the
most effective ways to reduse acid rain, slow the Greenhouse Effevt, and
improve our air quality.  Very recently, Cincinnati has witnessed a high
level of smog that is not only lowering our air quality, but has an economic
impact on the city as well.  Keep your home well-insulated, cut down on air
conditioning, cut your grass in the evening and weâll all start to breathe a
lot easier.</P>

<H2>The Animals:</H2>

<H4>The Problem:  Loss of Habitat</H4>

<P>All of the problems that are described here have direct impact in native
wildlife.  In some cases the impact is so severe that whole species of
animals are disappearing.  Those on the critical list include the grizzly
bear, the grey wolf, and the whooping crane, as well as some lesser-known
species such as the Texas blind salamander and the California gnat catcher.
The primary threat is the loss of habitat as humans continue to encroach on
natural ecosystems.<P>

<P><STRONG>What Can You Do:</STRONG>  Write to your congressperson in
support of the Endangered Species Act.  Be aware of local habitats and
ecosystems that are in danger.  Join a conservation organization that
protects wild areas.</P>

<CENTER><H1>Saving the Wild for the Wildlife</H1>

<H1>Cincinnati Zoo Conservation Fund</H1>

<BR></CENTER>



<H3>What is the Conservation Fund?</H3>
<P>Founded in 1873, the Cincinnati Zoo & Botanical Garden has consistently
taken a leadership role in the effort to preserve and protect animal species
throughout the world.  Our work in the area of conservation stands out among
American zoos, and is admired by members of the conservation community
across the globe.</P>
<P>Nevertheless, wildlife populations continue to decline, and many species
face outright extinction.  The major cause of the crisis is habitat loss,
particularly in the tropical rain forests of the world.  Home to 50% of all
plant and animal species, the rain forests covered 20% of the Earth’s
surface.  Devastated by deforestation, they now account for less than 7%.
Accordingly, our mission has evolved beyond the conservation of species to
that of habitat preservation  - saving the ecosystems in which these species
belong.</P>

<P>In 1990, the Zoo Conservation Fund was established so that our institution 
could join habitat preservation efforts around the world.  the fund now helps 
to support four rain forest ecosystems - each unique and biologically diverse.
</P>
<BR>
<HR>
<BR>

<H3>Suriname</H3>
<P>Suriname’s vast rain forests are among the most pristine wilderness areas 
in South America, and are home to thousands of plant species and hundreds of 
species of birds, mammals, reptiles, and amphibians.  They are alive with 8 
species of primates, including golden-headed tamarins, red howler monkeys, 
and white-faced sakis, as well as jaguars, tapirs, peccaries, and tamanduas 
- all dependent on the rain forest for survival.</P>

<P>Strengthened by the efforts of Conservation International, many Surinamese 
have a deep commitment to preserving this fragile habitat.  The Zoo 
Conservation Fund assists by creating educational guides for the visitors to 
the Raleighvallen-Voltzberg Nature Reserve.  Fund contributions also support 
public awareness campaigns to protect endangered species, including the 
poison dart frog, Dendrobates azureus.</P>

<H3>Gabon</H3>

<P>The Gamba Reserve, located along the coast of Gabon in West Africa, unites 
diverse marine, tropical forest, and savannah habitats to create a true 
wildlife paradise.  It is the only place in the world where elephants and 
forest buffalo roam the beaches.  African manatees live in the lagoons and 
humpback whales and leatherback sea turtles feed offshore.  Within the virgin 
forest, bongo antelope, duiker, hippopotamus, leopard, and 20 species of 
primates, including chimpanzees, are thriving.  Four hundred of Gabon’s 650 
bird species nest in the green canopy and along the rich waterways.</P>

<P>The Zoo Conservation Fund supports the work of the World Wildlife Fund in
 building ranger stations now staffed by full time guards who monitor 
wildlife populations and deter poaching within the reserve.</P>

<H3>Zaire</H3>

<P>Zaire’s Ituri Forest is one of the most remote areas on the continent of 
Africa.  Forest wildlife includes bongo, duiker, Congo peafowl, and 
chimpanzees as well as the rare okapi.  The indigenous Lese and Efe people 
have lived in harmony with the Ituri Forest for thousands of years, and are 
dependent upon its resources for food, medicine, clothing, and shelter.</P>

<P>Like most indigenous groups in emerging cultures, the people of the Ituri 
Forest struggle to maintain control over policies that affect their lives.  
The Ituri Fund assists the Efe and Lese in establishing schools and providing 
health care services.  The Zoo Conservation Fund contributes to the effort by 
supporting teacher salaries.  The Fund also supplies educational materials
 promoting literacy awareness of ecological issues.</P>

<H3>Sumatra</H3>

<P>The Gunung Leuser National Park is Indonesia’s largest remaining
wilderness area.  Unrivaled in biological diversity, the park encompasses a
broad range of habitats, from coastal rain forests to mountain peaks.  The
Sumatran orangutan, Sumatran tiger, Asian elephant, great argus pheasant,
rhinoceros hornbill, flying fox, sun bear, binterong, and the very
endangered Sumatran rhino all live within the park boundaries.</P>

<P>Working with the World Wildlife Fund, the Zoo Conservation Fund protects
these habitats through support of a Geographical Information System (GIS)

<H3>A Call to Action</H3>

<P>Every species on the planet is a part of a fragile and unique habitat,
and the frightening reality of our world is this:  if we do not protect our
habitats, our most wondrous species will surely disappear from our
midst.</P>

<P>Your support of the Zoo Conservation Fund will go a long way toward 
protecting endangered habitats throughout the world, including those of  many 
of the species on display at the Cincinnati Zoo & Botanical Garden.  Please 
join this important effort today.  Conservation can not wait.</P>

and the probability of our own survival.&quot;</I></P>

<P>&shy; unknown</P>

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>CREW MISSION<BR>
To use science and technology to understand, preserve and propagate endangered<BR>
flora and fauna and facilitate the conservation of global biodiversity.</H4>

<P><BR>
Since its founding in 1981, the Carl H. Lindner Jr. Family Center for Research
of Endangered Wildlife (CREW), the research division of the Cincinnati Zoo
and Botanical Garden, has become internationally recognized.</P>

<P>In 1991, CREW moved into a new, 18,000 square foot state-of-the-art research
facility which is devoted exclusively to the study and conservation of endangered
flora and fauna. The facility has laboratories for plant cloning, animal
<I>in vitro</I> fertilization, and embryo transfer; a medical suite for
animal medical procedures; a greenhouse; tissue culture facilities; cryopreservation
lab (Frozen Zoo and Garden); and permanent public exhibit.</P>

<P>Here, CREW is trying to enhance the survival of wild species through
a comprehensive research program. CREW goals include improving the quality
of life for captive populations, enhancing reproduction growth and development,
and preserving the genetic diversity of endangered flora and fauna.</P>

<P>CREW has had more than 10 &quot;world first&quot; breakthroughs since
its inception. Due in part to these successes, the program's expertise is
being tapped worldwide as nations seek knowledge and technology to preserve
endangered wildlife.</P>

<P>CREW's <B>Animal Conservation Division</B> is developing assisted reproduction
techniques such as <I>in vitro </I>fertilization, artificial insemination,
sperm and embryo cryopreservation and embryo transfer to enhance animal
reproduction and help genetically manage small, endangered populations.</P>

<P>The <B>Plant Conservation Division</B> is pioneering techniques such
as tissue culture propagation (&quot;test tube plants&quot;) and <I>in vitro</I>
collection to save endangered plants, focusing on species which have challenged
traditional methods of plant preservation and propagation.</P>

<P>The heart of CREW, for both its Animal and Plant Conservation Divisions,
is the <B>International Wildlife Germplasm Bank</B> better known as the
<B>Frozen Zoo and Garden</B>. This is where tissues from animals and plants
are cryopreserved (frozen in liquid nitrogen at -196&middot; C) and preserved
for future use.</P>

<P>CREW researchers must collect and freeze the germplasm of as many species
as possible before these plants and animals are lost to extinction. In the
future, researchers will thaw these samples of genetic material and try
to bring to life individual plants or animals using any number of cloning
techniques for plants, or employing surrogate mothers of the same or related
species for animals. This unique repository has the potential to ensure
genetic diversity which is so critical to healthy populations. In some cases,
the Frozen Zoo and Garden is serving as a safety net -- preserving the chance
for a species' future.</P>

<P>There is an urgency to the work carried out at CREW in and around the
Frozen Zoo and Garden. Some of the animal and plant species which CREW hopes
to cryopreserve may disappear from the wild within the next five or ten
years.<BR>

 Since 1875 the Cincinnati Zoo has played a vital role in the 
life of Cincinnati and the surrounding region where it has served as an 
important educational and recreational institution, civic center, and 
tourist destination. The Zoo opened its doors on September 18, 1875. It 
was the second major zoological garden in the U.S.A., following the 
Philadelphia Zoo, which began fourteen months earlier. The Cincinnati 
Zoo's original managing organization, the Zoological Society of 
Cincinnati, was founded in 1873. A particularly important and unique 
aspect of the Zoo's past is its early German influences. The Zoo's 
founder, Andrew (Andreas) Erkenbrecher was a German-born immigrant and 
animal lover who worked persistently to establish a zoological garden in 
Cincinnati. The Cincinnati Zoo was largely patterned after the Frankfurt 
Zoological garden along with other major European zoos. The Cincinnati 
Zoo opened with 65 acres, the same as the Berlin Zoo, then the largest 
zoo in Europe.<p>

A well-financed, comprehensive plan of architectural and 
landscape design resulted in much of the Cincinnati Zoo's extensive 
original buildings being completed in 1875. Notable buildings still stand 
from this date, including the oldest zoo building in America, the Reptile 
House, which was originally built as the <a href="monkey.html">Monkey 
House</a>. The Passenger 
Pigeon Memorial was also built in 1875. <A HREF="hortpix/elephant.gif">The 
Elephant 
House</a>, built in 1906 and patterned after similar exotic architecture 
at the Berlin Zoo, is 
today one of the most spectacular historic zoo buildings in the world. 
The Cincinnati Zoo also has some of the nation's earliest <a 
HREF="hortpix/grotto.jpg">barless exhibits</a>, completed in the 1930s, and 
designed by the Hagenbeck firm of 
Hamburg, Germany. Today the Cincinnati Zoo is one of two zoos that has 
been designated as a National Historic Landmark, for its "... 
significance in commerating the history of the U.S.A." by the National 
Park Service, U.S. Department of the Interior.<p>

The long history of the Cincinnati Zoo has included a number of 
ups and downs. The original Zoological Society of Cincinnati was a 
for-profit corporation modeled after similar European zoo societies. The 
first years were plagued with financial hardships because of high 
property rental costs and the poor public transportation of the time. In 
1898 the Society went into receivership and the following year a 
non-profit Cincinnati Zoological Company was formed to operate the Zoo. 
In 1902 the local public transit company, the Cincinnati Traction 
Company, purchased controlling interests in the Cincinnati Zoological 
Company and provided funds for a variety of zoo improvements. In 1917 the 
Zoo was purchased by two prominent philanthropists, Mrs. Mary Emery and 
Mrs. Anna Sinton Taft, after the Cincinnati Traction Company was no 
longer able to support the Zoo. A new Zoo operating organization was 
developed, the Cincinnati Zoological Park Association. Its president was 
Mrs. Taft's husband, Charles Phelps Taft, the half brother of President 
William Howard Taft. In 1932 the Zoo was purchased by the City of 
Cincinnati and a new zoo management organization was formed, the present 
day Zoological Society of Cincinnati. <p>

The early Zoo was hampered by the high turnover of its 
superintendents. The first superintendent was Dr. Heinrich Dorner, who 
had previously been Scientific-Secretary of the Hamburg (Germany) Zoo. 
Dorner only lasted one year and a series of superintendents followed 
until 1886 when the head keeper, Sol Stephan, was appointed as 
superintendent. Stephan served until 1937 when he retired at the age of 
88. One of America's pioneering zoo directors, Stephan was nationally 
renowned for his knowledge of animal management, breeding, and zoo 
operations. Sol Stephan was Carl Hagenbeck's American animal sales agent  
in the early 1900s and an early advocate of Hagenbeck's barless exhibits 
and other innovative husbandry practices. Stephan was followed by John 
(Jack) Heusser who served as Executive Director until 1961. After a short 
transitional period under the leadership of William Hoff, Edward M. 
Maruska became Executive Director in 1968. Since that time Maruska has 
led the Zoo in  wide-ranging programs of dramatic improvement, ranging 
from collections, exhibits, education, research, attendance and 
membership.<p>

Throughout much of its history the Cincinnati Zoo has had one of 
the nation's outstanding animal collections. Most of the Zoo's original 
animal purchases were from Carl Hagenbeck of Hamburg, Germany. Until the 
1940s the Zoo's collections were generally outstanding. The Zoo played an 
important early role in captive breeding and had a number of American zoo 
breeding firsts including: California sea lions (1878), trumpeter swans 
(1880), bison and giraffe (1889). Some of the most notable animals 
through Zoo history have included "<a href="pigeon.html">Martha</a>," the 
last passenger pigeon who 
died in 1914 and "Incas," the last Carolina parakeet in captivity who 
died in 1918. The Zoo's most popular animal in the 1930s and 1940s was 
"Susie," a female lowland gorilla, who was trained to eat at a table with 
her trainer. She died in 1947 at the age of 22, establishing a longevity 
record for the species at that time. In recent decades the Zoo has had 
notable success in breeding lowland gorillas, black rhinoceros, Komodo 
dragon monitor lizards, and a number of cat species among many other 
species. In recent decades research programs at the Zoo have focused on 
reproductive research. The Zoo's Center for Reproduction of Endangered 
Wildlife or "CREW" has had many significant successes with embryo 
transfer and cryopreservation technologies. In 1988 the Zoo began 
operations on a satellite breeding facility, the Mast Farm.<p>

Since its founding the Cincinnati Zoo has emphasized plantings 
and landscape. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s the role of plants 
increased. In 1987 the official name of the institution was changed from 
the Cincinnati Zoological Garden to the Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical 
Garden.<p>
 
Since the 1890s the Zoo has had close relationships with public 
and private schools. In recent years education has played an 
ever-increasing role at the Zoo.<p>

One of the Zoo's most unique historical features was the <A 
HREF="hortpix/Opera.jpg">Zoo 
Summer Opera</a>.  When the Zoo opened in 1875 it followed the German zoo 
tradition of having band concerts.  Musical performances continued over 
the years and in 1920 a summer season of opera began. Within a few years 
the Zoo Summer Opera became nationally famous.  To the amusement of 
audiences, opera singers often had to compete with  choruses of Zoo 
wildlife. World famous stars performed over the years including Placido 
Domingo, Beverly Sills, as well as Cincinnatian James Levine, who 
conducted the last performance at the Zoo in 1971.  The following year 
the Opera moved from the Zoo to Music Hall.<p>

<H1>Cat Ambassador Program</H1>
</CENTER>
<P>

	Since its creation in 1980, the Cincinnati Zoo's Cat Ambassador 
Program has travelled to area schools and other community organizations 
to raise awareness of the plight of the world's cat species, many of 
which are in grave danger of disappearing forever.  Cathryn Hilker, 
Director of the Cat Ambassador Program, and trainers educate audiences 
about endangered cat species and what people can do to prevent these 
magnificent animals from becoming extinct.  Helping the staff present its 
message are the program's feline ambassadors.  These trained cats are 
ambassadors of good will who demonstrate some of their survival skills 
during the presentation.  The feline ambassadors represent such species 
as cheetah, serval, mountain lion, caracal, tiger, and ocelot.<p>
	Cathryn Hilker began the Cat Ambassador Program with one cat, a 
young female cheetah named <A HREF="angel.html">Angel</a>.  Through the 
generosity of 
Frisch's Restaurants, the program was founded and a special area of the 
Cincinnati Zoo, known as the Animal Recreation Center or ARC, was set 
aside to become the home for the friendly feline ambassadors.<p>
	Because of the Cat Ambassador Program, at least 100,000 people 
delight in the opportunity to view these wonderful cats up close.  Each 
summer the cats and staff present the show "Cats, Cats, Cats" at the 
Cincinnati Zoo.<p>

	As many as 50,000 school children see the cat ambassadors each 
year either at the zoo or in their own <A HREF="schools.html">schools</a>.  
The cat ambassadors travel to approximately 80 schools in the tri-state area 
annually.  
Cathryn Hilker and her cats are even TV celebrities, having appeared on 
national television shows to promote conservation.  Cathryn Hilker closes 
each program with this advice:  "Lead your lives more simply so that 
these beautiful animals might simply live."<p>

<title>CAPTIVE BREEDING: Is It The Answer?</title>

<i>by <b>Edward Maruska</b>, Zoo Director</i><p>
For years the zoo profession has prided itself on 
captive breeding and the hopeful reintroduction of 
endangered species. Although captive breeding has 
been relatively successful with most species and 
we have become almost self-sustaining in terms of 
exhibit animals, the captive breeding effort is 
not the panacea that it was once thought to be in 
terms of the reintroduction of endangered species.<p>

<IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="captive.gif" HSPACE=3 VSPACE=3 ALT "Picture of a 
California Condor"><p><br><p>

Reintroductory efforts have been expensive and in 
a large part unsuccessful with most species. A 
classic example of captive, breeding and 
reintroduction is the conserxation efforts 
regarding one of our most impressive bird 
species-- the <B>California Condor</B> ( mnogyps 
californianus).<p>

By the 1960s there were only 60 condors left in the 
xad. Over a period of years there was a continual 
decline in the vAd population until only 16 were left 
in the wild by the mid-I 980s. A decision was made by 
the U.S. Department of Fish and Wildlife and the State 
of California to pug the remaining birds into captivity. 
The last wild condor was captured in April, 1987. The 
condors were placed at both the Los Angeles Zoo and 
the 
<a href="http://www.sddt.com/files/realestate/communities/sandiegozoo.html">San 
Diego Zoo</a> where a cooperative breeding California 
Condor effort had been put into effect.<p>

This effort was largely successful with the condor 
population reaching more than 60 birds during a 
three-year period of time. However, the attempt at 
reintroduction has not proved as promising. One 
major problem is that we are reintroducing birds 
into an environment that caused their very extinction, 
i.e. high power lines that snagged the birds, carcasses 
baited for predator control, etc. Perhaps in the near 
future there will be enough wisdom used to look at the 
historic range of this species which included the Grand 
Canyon and hopefully introduce the birds propagated in 
captivity, to a more healthy habitat.<p>

While captive breeding for future reintroduction Will 
continue to be an important part of zoo conservation 
efforts, our objective in captive breeding should not 
be to have a lot of frozen animals in straws or living 
museum pieces with no habitat to place them in. A more 
critical role that we will continue to play is in 
environmental education. Educating our public about 
the necessity and urgency of preserving viable habitat 
is essential to the survival of endangered species. Our 
main efforts should be focused on ways to protect habitat 
worldwide and on using our captive breeding efforts and 
technology to shore up endangered populations of 
existing species.

<P>
There are several events that we are looking forward 
to with great anticipation. Late last year we sent 
our Asian elephant, My Thai, on a breeding loan to 
the Dickerson Park Zoo in Springfield, Missouri. I 
am happy to report that there were several days when 
breeding behavior was observed between My Thai and 
their bull elephant, Onyx. Once it is determined that 
My Thai is pregnant, Schottzie will be the next elephant 
sent on breeding loan. Hopefully, this will be a successful 
venture as well.<P>
     In terms of exhibit changes, the completion of 
the Bird House renovation is coming along on schedule. 
We are anticipating opening that building in late June 
or early July. It will be one of the most exciting 
exhibits that we have undertaken to date. &quot;Wings 
of the World&quot; will portray birds in the way people 
should see them to appreciate their beauty and diversity. 
A highlight of this new exhibit will be the large alcid 
display containing puffins, auklets, murres, and guillemots. 
Collected by our Aviculture staff during two exhibitions 
to St. Lawrence Island in 1993 and 1994, several of 
these species will be displayed for the first time 
in captivity.<P>
     In addition, we are in the process of developing 
an &quot;eagle's eye view&quot; of our bald eagle display. 
Visitors will enter a rustic shelter that includes 
not only seating but a television monitor  with a camera 
mounted above the eagles' nest. Visitors can view these 
magnificent birds in a barless and wireless environment. 
With the help of the monitor, they can observe the 
eagles raising their young. A &quot;bird's eye&quot; 
view from egg to fledgling will be possible.  The addition 
is the result of a trust fund established by Elizabeth 
Furber for &quot;the preservation, breeding, and upkeep 
of the American Bald Eagle&quot; at the Cincinnati 
Zoo.<P>
     I'm sure that 1996 will bring us another fine group 
of new babies to celebrate during Zoo Babies Month 
and additional exciting happenings to add to your enjoyment 
of this outstanding zoological garden. A happy and 
healthy New Year to all our  members and may you have 
many entertaining and educational trips to the Cincinnati 
Zoo and Botanical Garden.<P>

<i>By <b>Edward Maruska</b></i><p>

There are certain animals that people automatically expect to find in a zoo and elephants are one of them. In fact, in surveys and focus groups conducted by our Marketing Department, visitors have repeatedly indicated that elephants are the most popular zoo animal. <p>
	The Cincinnati Zoo has made a commitment to working with Asian elephants because their numbers are extremely low in the wild and because we have an excellent nucleus of animals to work with at our facility.  Habitat for the Asian elephant has diminished greatly due to expanding human population throughout Asia. With the decline in habitat comes a decline in the wild elephant population as well. In fact, the last two elephants that we received from Asia are probably going to be among the last coming out of the wild. 
	If zoos are to continue exhibiting elephants, we have to develop methods to maintain and breed these animals on a more routine basis. And with our own growing elephant family, the Cincinnati Zoo needs a modern facility to accomplish this since there is really no justification in keeping elephants if we can't add to their diminishing population.<p>

<IMG SRC="elehouse.gif" align=left>	During the holiday season of 1995, Marge Schott, a long-time friend of the Cincinnati Zoo and our pachyderms, presented the Zoo with funds earmarked for a new "Vanishing Giants" exhibit as a gift to the children of Cincinnati. Beginning in 1961 when Mrs. Schott and her late husband Charles donated Schottzie I to the Cincinnati Zoo.  With her continued love for the Zoo and the elephants, Mrs. Schott's generosity continues to benefit the species as well as our visitors to this world-class zoo.<p>
	Elephants are extremely social and intelligent animals that are better kept in small family groups as they would be in the wild. This new exhibit, the Schott-Unnewehr Vanishing Giants Exhibit, will allow us to do just that. The project involves a complete renovation of the existing Elephant House while still maintaining the main structure Ð a Cincinnati landmark listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It will provide us with a state-of-the art facility, expanded exhibit and holding areas, and a work room for researchers. In addition to our Asian elephants, this area will also house okapi and a family of giraffes. <p>
	We are committed to the conservation of these marvelous animals and this new exhibit will allow us to expand the scope of this commitment.<p>

Zoo Volunteers</H1></TD></TR></TABLE>

 April 21-27 has been set aside as this year's National Volunteer Week,
a time designated to honor the ever-increasing number of individuals who
are the lifeblood of so many non-profit institutions and organizations.
According to Webster, to &quot;volunteer&quot; is &quot;to freely choose
to offer or give without being asked or obliged.&quot; Without this unselfish
involvement, many organizations would find it difficult to effectively accomplish
their goals and objectives. <BR>
<BR>
The Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Garden is no exception. In fact, we were
one of the first non-profit institutions to use volunteers. The areas and
activities that our volunteers are involved with are as diverse as the Zoo.
Without their help and the tremendous efforts they put forth, we would not
be able to accomplish many of our own goals. <BR>
<BR>
This was pointed out most recently when we went through an accreditation
program facilitated by Dr. Ron Kagan, director of the Detroit Zoological
Park. He was amazed at what we have accomplished with such a relatively
small work force until he realized what a substantial volunteer base we
have behind us. <BR>
<BR>
Our volunteers are here most days of the year and can be found working in
almost every aspect of the Zoo. We have volunteers who work in the gift
shops and volunteers who help educate our visitors about the natural world
and our place in the ecosystem. We have volunteers who make it possible
for visitors to see and touch animals in the contact yard or enjoy them
in animal presentations in the Frisch's Discovery Center. There are also
volunteers who help in the various offices throughout the park or serve
as volunteer observers to assist our animal staff. The horticulture aspect
of the Zoo would suffer greatly if it were not for the countless hours of
work put forth by our 70 horticulture volunteers. They help prepare the
Zoo's landscape after the winter season, plant bulbs and lead garden tours.
The results of all their hard work are extremely evident as we celebrate
our annual Spring Floral Festival. 
<P><CENTER><IMG SRC="volunteers.jpg" WIDTH="300" HEIGHT="203" ALIGN=top
NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></CENTER>
<P>Much of our fund raising is accomplished with the help of volunteers.
The countless hours and creative efforts that are put into our annual Zoofari
is a prime example of this. <BR>
<BR>
Our Board of Trustees is made up mostly of volunteers with a few city and
county appointees. All are public spirited individuals who give generously
of their time and effort because they take pride in our city and the accomplishments
of the Cincinnati Zoo. <BR>
<BR>
When I think about our volunteers, I immediately think of a wonderful group
of individuals who choose service above self in order to provide support
for their zoo and service to its visitors. I'm sure you will join me in
thanking them and in realizing that it would take much more than one week
to adequately express our appreciation. <BR>

<BR>
June is traditionally Zoo Babies Month at the Cincinnati Zoo. It's the time
of year we set aside to celebrate the numerous births which occur during
the year and the continued success we've had in breeding endangered species.
<BR>
<BR>
It is always our hope that babies remain with and be raised by their mothers.
When &shyp; for one reason or another &shyp; this is not possible, they
are taken to the Zoo's Nursery. Located in the Joseph H. Spaulding Children's
Zoo, the Nursery is one of the most popular places for our visitors. <BR>
The decision to put an infant in the Nursery, however, is always a difficult
one to make and a last resort decision. An animal would not be separated
from its mother simply to exhibit it. A baby is brought to the Nursery for
several reasons. If the baby shows signs of not doing well, not wanting
to nurse properly, or the mother is not producing enough milk for the demands
of the youngster, these would be reasons to move the baby to our Nursery.
If the mother neglects the baby, which sometimes happens with a first-time
mother, or there are signs of a potential disease problem indicating that
the baby needs to be treated by the veterinarians, we would again place
the animal in the Nursery.

</H5>
For us, total success is achieved if the parent animal raises its own young.
But when it is necessary to hand raise a baby, a dedicated, around the-clock
staff trained to work with an incredible variety of youngsters is a must.
The Cincinnati Zoo has such a staff. Carol Schottelkotte and Dawn Strasser
have a total of more than 28 years of experience between them. They have
taken care of everything from baby birds to numerous primates such as gorilla,
orangutans, and bonobo chimpanzees. Most recently, they have provided 24-hour
care for Timu, the world's first test tube gorilla &shyp; in addition to
caring for two other gorilla babies, a Mhorr's gazelle and a zebra duiker.<BR>
<BR>
Because we have so many gorillas, a record number of six born in 1995 alone,
it is not unusual to have more than one youngster at a time in the Nursery.
Socialization with its own kind is very important in gorillas. Because they
are such highly gregarious animals, it is essential that gorillas grow up
and interact with their peers. If a gorilla is isolated too long, it will
imprint on human behavior and it then becomes difficult for that animal
to adjust when it is returned to a group. By about eight months of age,
if we only have a single primate in the Nursery, we will either move it
to another zoo or bring an animal in similar circumstances here.<BR>
<BR>
Not only do our Nursery animals get excellent care from the Nursery keepers
but our night watch staff is often involved in giving night feedings once
the babies are doing well. Due to the level of constant care and monitoring
required by these animals, the Nursery is an area that the veterinary staff
visits frequently. Again, we are very fortunate in the expertise and dedication
of our veterinary staff. <BR>
<BR>
When you come to the Zoo during Zoo Babies Month, or any time you come,
take time to stop at the Nursery. And while you're enjoying the antics of
the various animal babies, take a minute to wave hello to two special women
who give their charges so much loving care. <BR>

<BR>
<BR>
<I>By <B>Edward Maruska</B>, Director</I><BR>
<BR>
Wings of the World: A Celebration of Flight, the final exhibit project funded
by The Zoo Challenge Fund, opened last month. Originally built in the 1930s
for reptiles, it was converted to a bird house in 1951. <BR>
<BR>
The Bird House was something I inherited when I came on board and it was
one of the buildings that, as a Zoo Director, really bothered me. The exhibit
areas were far too small to allow the full expression of bird flight or
activity. In addition, it was poorly ventilated with the animal areas often
too cool in winter and too hot during the summer months. Even the penguin
pool, which had been remodeled, was still antiquated by today's standards
and technology. <BR>
<BR>
As a result, we had to be very selective about the kinds of birds we could
display. It was impossible to even think about displaying such delicate
birds as the attractive puffins and other related auklets that are now featured.
Despite the challenges presented by this outdated building, the aviculture
staff continued to do a remarkable job maintaining and even breeding many
birds. <BR>
<BR>
Obtaining funding for a major renovation of this exhibit became a high priority.
Not only would the modernization of the present building provide much needed
space and light, but it would also serve as a dramatic celebration of birds
&shyp; their origin, flight and habitat. <BR>
<BR>
Birds have fascinated man for thousands of years and their beauty has been
reflected in art throughout history. Perhaps the greatest fascination with
these winged creatures, however, resulted from their capacity for flight.
In all probability, this capacity provided the inspiration for the development
of manned flight. Even Greek mythology tells the tale of Icarus and his
attempt to flee Crete by flying with wings fashioned with wax.<BR>
<BR>
Wildlife observation, in one form or another, is a favorite pastime for
many Americans. Birdwatching has become extremely popular and can be enjoyed
in your own backyard or by traveling to specific observation areas. It can
take a small investment of time or it can become an avocation. Ironically,
even as this popularity continues to increase, birds are suffering from
the environmental problems that beset the earth. The greatest pressures
seem to fall on the migratory species that depend on both summer and winter
homes. These species generally have a long journey from one location to
the other, often along what has become an almost inhospitable route due
to pollution and loss of habitat.<BR>
<BR>
The issue of bird conservation is not a new problem. At the turn of the
century many beautiful birds were facing extinction because of the use of
feathers in the millinery industry. The Migratory Bird laws were a result
of this concern as well as the establishment of the National Audubon Society.
Unfortunately, it was already too late to save the passenger pigeon and
the Carolina parakeet.<BR>
In 1914, Martha, the last living passenger pigeon, died at the Cincinnati
Zoo and Incas, the last Carolina parakeet, died here in 1918. At one time,
the passenger pigeon was the most abundant of all land birds and literally
flew over the area in the millions. The Carolina parakeet was our only native
psittacine that nested throughout the southeastern United States. 
<P><CENTER><IMG SRC="martha.jpg" WIDTH="200" HEIGHT="304" ALIGN="BOTTOM"

<H5><CENTER>Martha, the last Passenger Pigeon</CENTER>
</H5>
Telling the story of birds, their magnificence and their plight, is important
in the overall efforts to save further species from extinction. It is our
hope that &quot;Wings of the World: A Celebration of Flight&quot; will both
educate and fascinate our visitors &shyp; that interest will be generated
not only in birds and their diversity, but also in the role we can play
in saving their habitat.<BR>

<BR>
Recently I had the honor of giving the keynote address at the PAAZAB (Pan
African Association of Zoological Gardens, Aquaria and Botanical Gardens)
meeting in Cape Town, South Africa. PAAZAB is a new organization. Their
current member concentration is South African but their ultimate goal is
to incorporate all the zoos, reserves and aquariums on the continent of
Africa.<BR>
Not only did I learn a good deal from the excellent papers that were presented
during this five-day meeting, but it provided an opportunity to visit with
colleagues and meet zoo associates from some of the smaller zoos and aquariums.
<BR>
<BR>
After the conference, I visited several zoos. At the Johannesburg Zoo I
met the new director, Dr. Patrick Condy, and toured the Zoo. The grounds
looked wonderful. Years ago a lot of European trees were planted at this
zoo. Dr. Condy is working to reestablish African plantings and trees on
the grounds. He pointed out that there were no native birds nesting in the
exotic trees, but where he had started planting acacia and other African
species, bird nests and bush babies were visible. <BR>
<P><CENTER><IMG SRC="director.gif" WIDTH="244" HEIGHT="161" ALIGN="BOTTOM"
NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></CENTER>
<H5><CENTER>An elephant grazes next to Lake Kariba</CENTER>
</H5>
<BR>
I also went to the Pretoria Zoo where I met Willy Labuschagne (the director)
and his wife Irene. This is a wonderful zoo with an outstanding collection
of hooved animals. In addition to touring the zoo, I had the opportunity
to see their 9,000-acre breeding farm in Lichtenburg. It is a drive-thru
area of hooved animals only - no predators - that is open
to the public. Driving through this farm is like driving through a wild
part of Africa. <BR>
<BR>
Next, I went to Zimbabwe to check on the rhino situation. Poaching is rampant
still and the current rhino population might be no more than 150 300. Out
of those, a number are on private ranches. When I was there in the 1980s,
rhinos numbered about 2,000. It looks like the most stable black rhino population
right now is in South Africa.<BR>
<BR>
The Hwange National Park was another stop on my trip. Because of the exceptionally
heavy and unseasonable rainfall, game was dispersed - you didn't see
the concentration of animals at the water holes that you would in drier
seasons. In fact, I only saw three elephants which is most unusual. Normally,
you would expect to see hundreds. The elephant population both in Zimbabwe
and Botswana is currently exceeding the habitat. There are probably 150,000
elephants, maybe twice the number that the range can accommodate.<BR>
<BR>
The next location I visited was Lake Kariba, where I was able to do some
game viewing by boat. Then I had an opportunity to take an extensive walking
safari and track elephants in very close proximity. It is amazing how large
an elephant is and how quietly they can move in heavy forest areas. You
could hear us walking a lot easier than you could hear the elephants. All
we could hear was what sounded like the rumbling in their stomachs. The
guide told us the elephants knew we were there because they were communicating
to each other. Our group eventually did sight one animal.<BR>
<BR>
While in Africa, I saw areas that I would really recommend others visit,
such as Lake Kariba. Seeing wild animals in their own habitat is an invaluable
experience. Not only does it teach us to appreciate these animals but also
helps us see the incredible need to preserve this habitat for future generations.
I would recommend that anyone who has the opportunity to see animals in
their natural habitat take that opportunity and relish every moment of it.
Seeing the magnificence and the dignity of animals in their own environment
is an experience and a privilege not to be missed. <BR>

<P><B>By <I>Edward Maruska</I>, Director</B></P>

<P>The Cincinnati Zoo is the second oldest zoo in the country. Over the
past 30 years we have strived to rebuild and expand our exhibits, not only
for the enjoyment of our visitors but also for the betterment of our animals.
One of the remaining remnants of the old zoo is the Elephant House whixh
opened in 1906. Originally called the Herbivora Building, it has been listed
on the National Register of Historic Places since 1975. </P>

<P>Built on the Zoo's highest point, the Elephant House is one of the most
spectacular historic buildings in the zoo world. Its design was modeled
after a variety of Islamic architectural influences, including the Taj Mahal
in India. At the time of construction, it was the largest concrete animal
building in the world and had the first steel-reinforced concrete doom in
the United States.</P>

<P>While we are committed to maintaining the character of the Elephant House
and its historic designation, the reality is that the building itself is
of the &quot;old zoo&quot; style with bars and small, antiquated outside
areas for the animals. Renovation of the building with new naturalistic
displays for elephants, giraffes and okapi is a top priority. A two-phase
total revamping of the exhibit will be undertaken with the first phase to
be included in our next capital fund drive - &quot;The Circle of
Life&quot; Campaign.</P>

<P>The initial phase of the Vanishing Giants exhibit will deal directly
with the building and the enlargement of the outside animal areas. To accomplish
this goal, it will be necessary to utilize the Elephant House parking lot.
This would make the outdoor animal area five times the size it is now. The
treatment of the inside of the building was suggested by Jack Huelsman,
the Zoo's associate director. Instead of a vertical walkway with animals
to the left and right as we have now, two distinct entries to the building
would be created - one at the east end and one at the west end. On one
side we would house elephants and on the other side house a herd of giraffe
with a smaller exhibit area for okapi. </P>

<P>This design would enlarge the indoor elephant exhibit three times the
size of the current area with the central section becoming a non public
access area. State-of-the-art animal holding facilities for mothers and
their young, as well as a containment area for handling medical problems
with elephants, would be located in this portion of the building. Although
the main theme of the exhibit will be African, we are committed to continuing
our work with Asian elephants. They are currently more endangered than the
African pachyderms and are in need of captive propagation. Perhaps in the
distant future we may once again have African elephants on zoo grounds.</P>

<P>A small elephant museum may also be incorporated into the exhibit. Elephants
are flagship species. As long as we can provide habitat and protection for
these species, other species benefit as well. The museum would stress the
need for the preservation of their habitat in addition to spotlighting man's
relationship with elephants for many thousands of years.</P>

<P>The second phase of the expansion would include the utilization of the
Erkenbrecher parking lot to create an expanded area for our hoofed animals
and a new hippo display with an underwater viewing area. All the Veldt animals
would be moved to this area with the Veldt becoming the new exhibit area
for Indian, white and black rhinocerous.</P>

<P>Funding for an endeavor of this magnitude is always the result of generous
giving by many individuals as well as members of the corporate community.
A cornerstone gift, naming the exhibit the Schott-Unnewehr Vanishing Giants
Exhibit, was presented to the Zoo last Christmas by Marge Schott as a gift
to the children of Cincinnati and the tri-state and as a tribute to the
family men in her life. This year, the dedicated men and women who volunteer
their efforts to make our annual Zoofari such a resounding success have
chosen to give a portion of the event's proceeds to the Vanishing Giants
exhibit. Without this kind of commitment and generosity to the Cincinnati
Zoo, reaching our goals would be impossible. I am indeed grateful to everyone
for continuing to help us fulfill our mission. Your support and encouragement
are greatly appreciated.</P>

<i>by <b>Doug Feist</b>, Curator of Children's Zoo</i><p>

When you visit the Elephant House this winter you will 
notice the absence of some of the usual residents that 
you have come to know over the years. The animals are 
being relocated to make more room for housing the Zoo's 
four Asian elephants Ð Mai Tai, Schotzie, Sabu and 
Jati. Plans for renovation of the building have been 
drawn by architects and the Zoo hopes to start the work 
when funds are available.<P>

<IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="tapir.gif" VSPACE=3 HSPACE=3 ALT "Picture of a Tapir">

The collection of <B>Malayan tapirs</B> (Tapirus indicus) 
have been sent to other zoos across America. Denise, 
the adult female tapir is at a private facility in Florida while her last born, Spike, 
is at the Woodland Park Zoo while his sire Patrick is in El Paso Zoo in Texas. 
The Zoo is also looking for a good place to move Cleopatra, 
the <B>Nile hippopotamus</B> (Hippopotamus amphibius) in order 
to make more personal space for elephants.<P>
<H5>A Malayan tapir (left)</H5>
Another benefit in relocating tapir and hippo involves 
the management of small captive populations of rare 
animals. It is important and common to spread out the 
gene pool to maximize genetic diversity and therefore 
manage the whole population instead of just individuals. 
 Zoos work together in organized Species Survival Plans 
(SSP's) to effectively place animals in the best breeding 
situation.<P>
     The renovation of the Elephant house will protect 
the historic architectural elements of the ninety-year-old 
building.  <P>
     &quot;The Elephant House is one of the most spectacular 
zoo buildings in the world,&quot; says David Ehrlinger, 
director of horticulture and author of &quot;The Cincinnati 
Zoo and Botanical Garden, From Past to Present.  &quot;It 
is from an age when ethnographic architecture was in 
vogue and the building reflects Islamic architectural 
design.&quot; <P>

<IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="hippo.gif" VSPACE=3 HSPACE=3 ALT "Picture of a Nile Hippopotamus">

     &quot;In the 19th and early 20th centuries it was 
important to depict exotic origins of animals through 
architecture, which reflected the people of the world,&quot; 
Ehrlinger adds.<P>
     So from past to present the history of people and 
elephants continue at the Cincinnati Zoo. A nearly 
century old architectural landmark will receive well 
deserved improvements that will take it into its second 
century of service to the Zoo.<P>

<i>by <b>Doug Feist</b>, Curator of Children's Zoo</i><p>

In early January the Zoo's popular Cat House will be closed 
for a  much needed interior facelift. With more than a million 
visitors each year the time has come to clean up this greatly 
appreciated building with new carpet, wallpaper and interior painting.

<P>
The wallpaper is a special challenge for our Graphics 
and Exhibits Department because there are more than 
30 educational graphics that need to be silk-screened 
onto the paper. All of the panels need to be replaced 
and some need to be updated. Several of the interpretive 
panels will deliver a more current message regarding 
the future of cats in the wild. <P>
     If you are looking for cats on display, there are 
other opportunities around the Zoo to observe a good 
variety of beautiful animals.  The large outdoor Cat 
Grottos are home to impressive African lions and the 
highly endangered Indochinese or Corbett's tigers which 
remain active throughout the winter. In Big Cat Canyon, 
you will find the and stunning &quot;white tiger&quot; 
which is the white color phase of the Bengal tiger. 
<P>
  There are several outdoor displays that wrap around 
the Cat House exterior which are active throughout 
the winter with elegant snow leopards, sturdy Siberian 
lynx and our own local bobcats on display. All three 
of these species are well adapted to our cold winters 
and should be easy to observe.<P>
  The Cat House will be closed for several weeks and 
will re-open in late February.<P>

<IMG SRC="guenon.gif" align=left><i><FONT SIZE=5>S</FONT>hrieks of 
distress fill the hillside as the nimble primates jump and leap through 
the trees with amazing speed and agility.  A sentinel at his post 
detected danger and had alerted the group with his warning. </i><p>
	This is a common scenario in Gabon, a country in West Africa which has 
a rich diversity of wildlife.  One of Gabon's habitat strongholds is the 
Gamba Reserve, an area supported in part by the Zoo's Conservation Fund. <p>
	The colobus monkey and the crowned guenon are two species of primates 
found in Jungle Trails whose natural range includes parts of Gabon. The 
crowned guenon can be found within the Gamba Reserve while the colobus 
monkey is found in the northern part of the country.<p>
	These two species of monkeys are in the same family, "the old world 
monkeys" (<i>Cercopithecidae</i>), but quickly diverge in classification 
into two subfamilies. The colobus monkey is in the subfamily of "leaf 
monkeys" (<i>Colobinae</i>) while the crowned guenon is in the subfamily 
sometimes refered to as "typical monkeys" which includes guenons, 
macaques and baboons (<i>Cercopithecinae</i>).  Most leaf monkey species 
are found in Asia, with the exception of the colobus species, while the 
"typical monke ys" range includes both Africa and Asia. <p>
<IMG SRC="colobus.gif" align=left>	There are several physiological 
traits which separate the crowned guenon and the colobus monkey into two 
separate subfamilies; and these traits greatly affect their diet and 
distribution. The leaf monkeys have a more complex digestive system to 
help them break down the leaves which comprise a large part of their 
diet and are difficult to digest.  Their stomach is separated - an upper 
region breaks down the leaves with the help of bacteria; then a lower 
acid region continues the digestive process and absorbtion of nutrients. 
The bacteria breaks up the cell wall of the leaves (which is comprised 
of cellulose, a substance that cannot be digested without the help of 
bacterial action). <p>
The "typical monkeys" such as the crowned guenon do not have this 
special stomach arrangement; therefore, their diet contains more fruit, 
seeds, bulbs and even insects and other prey. In the complex habitats 
that are found in the forests of Gabon, these monkeys often form groups 
of several species that live and forage together.<p>
	The Zoo offers a wonderful opportunity to observe not only these old 
world monkeys, but several other old world primate species as well.  
During warmer weather, the colobus monkey and the crowned guenon can 
also be seen in their outdoor exhibits at Gorilla World.<p>

<BR>
If you ever wanted to get a &quot;bird's-eye&quot; view of a bald eagle
nest, now you can! Recent renovations to the Bald Eagle Exhibit give you
the opportunity to see these great birds without wire mesh screening your
view. Special hi-tech equipment allows you to peer down into their nest
from above.<BR>
<BR>
 An eagle-sized bird blind has been outfitted for the flight cage by removing
a large section of the wire mesh. Now you can walk into an eagle interpretive
area where the story of the bald eagle's plight in Ohio is told. From there,
you can go out onto a deck and see the eagles at eye level without visual
interference. <BR>
<BR>
In addition, a camera is mounted high above the nest site. From the visitor's
optical perch, you can operate the &quot;Eagle Cam's&quot; zoom lens to
observe the birds as they go about the business of constructing the nest,
incubating eggs and feeding young eaglets. You can even record your eagle
observations to share with others. Simply hook your camcorder up to a port
to record all the eagle action on the screen. 
<P><CENTER><IMG SRC="eaglenest.jpg" WIDTH="300" HEIGHT="187" ALIGN=middle
NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></CENTER>
<P>The bald eagles at the Zoo have successfully raised eight eaglets. At
the appropriate age, these youngsters are removed from their nest and placed
in foster nests of wild eagles or are &quot;hacked&quot; into the wild with
the help of surrogate human parents. &quot;Hacking&quot; is an old falconry
practice of putting the birds in an artificial nest where they are unaware
that their food is provided by human supporters. As the birds grow more
independent, they begin to fly and hunt on their own. At this point, the
falconer would catch the bird and begin training it in earnest. Biologists,
however, employ the hacking technique for eagles simply to allow the birds
to go off on their own. <BR>
<BR>
As much as 20% of the wild eagle population in Ohio is a result of captive
released birds and their subsequent offspring. Three birds hatched at the
Cincinnati Zoo in 1979 and 1981 have flown free at Sandusky Bay nest sites.
Later hatchings in 1984, 1990, and 1995 (a total of five eaglets) were released
in Tennessee. <BR>
<BR>
<I>The interpretive panels about eagles in Ohio are made possible by a grant
from the Ohio Department of Natural Resources Division of Wildlife. &quot;Eagle
Cam&quot; is funded by the Zoosters, one of the Cincinnati Zoo's many hardworking
volunteer groups. <BR>

<B>Hogs of a Different Color</B><BR>
Pigs are not beautiful in the eyes of many people. Their stout build, pugnacious appearance and intimidating tusks give them an appearance that only a sow could love. Now if you can get beyond the gruff exterior, the swine family members are actually high
ly adaptable, physically strong and quite intelligent. <P>
Swine are members of the diverse mammalian order Artiodactyla which in greek means even (artios) + toed (daktylos). Most of the members of the order have two toes &shyp; frequently in the form of hooves. It is a highly successful order which includes deer
, antelope, cattle, goat, hippopotamus and camel species.<P>
This spring when you visit Wildlife Canyon look for the red river hog (Potamochoerus porcus) also known as the African bush pig, on display alongside other unique hoofed mammals. The red river hog is really quite striking in appearance with its coat of re
ddish hair which has white and black accents. Their ears are adorned with long streamer-like hair tufts while the back has a pronounced mane running the length of their body.<BR>
The red river hog is found throughout Africa south of the Sahara desert wherever they can find dense vegetation and moist soil. These simple requirements allow the hog to be abundant in forests, river valleys and even around human habitation. On a recent 
visit to Kenya, I found the red river hogs quite bold after sunset as they wandered about the lawns of the lodge in which we were staying.<P>
The hog is primarily nocturnal, traveling in groups called "sounders" by night as they forage for a wide range of foods including plant parts, small animals and insects if they are lucky. By day the group digs into the moist soil to escape the heat of the
 sun.<BR>
<BR>
Here at the Zoo we have a pair of hogs and plans are being made to acquire two more females or sows. Most wild sounders are comprised of four to six animals that are led by a dominant boar. With our hopeful additions we would have the ideal sounder to get
 the North American population of red river hogs back on sound footing.<P>

<BR>
<I>By <B>Doug Feist</B>, Childrens's Zoo Curator</I><BR>
<BR>
We live in an enlightened era where political correctness is the status
quo and everyone's talking about traditional family values. But what are
&quot;traditional&quot; family values? As is the case with almost anything,
it depends on who you ask.<BR>
<BR>
The same is true in the animal world. If animals could talk, they would
probably tell us that a variety of parenting styles and flexible working
hours are a good thing. While some animals are intimately associated with
their young, others maintain a loose connection with their offspring at
best. At the far end of the spectrum there are those species that would
actually eat their own young if given the chance. 
<P><CENTER><IMG SRC="gorillamombaby.jpg" WIDTH="250" HEIGHT="224" ALIGN=
"MIDDLE" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></CENTER>
<H5><CENTER>Gorilla Mother and baby</CENTER>
</H5>
The way youngsters develop influences the amount of parental involvement
as well. Some young are weak and helpless while others are quite mobile
from the start but still need guidance from their parents. Once again, though,
the extreme cases are those progeny that never know or need the help of
their parents.<BR>
<BR>
Many species of mammals &shyp; such as primates and hoofed animals like
goats, antelope and sheep &shyp; develop strong bonds between mother and
young. The same is true for many species of birds. Young that are helpless
early in life are termed altricial. All of their needs are met by the parents,
food is provided, protection is given and some of these young even rely
on their parents for warmth.<BR>
Female lowland gorillas spend three to five years of their lives dedicated
to the rearing of their offspring. The young are nursed by the mother, carried
about or ride on her back, and are constantly groomed. This long period
of infancy and childhood prepares young gorillas for their social life in
the group. At the Zoo you can see female gorillas caring for their young
at Gorilla World.<BR>
<BR>
A different strategy in the survival of offspring is observed in precocial
young. From the start, many animals are out on their own with little or
no help or protection from their parents. Our Zoo is famous for hatching
Komodo dragon eggs and successfully raising the rare dragons. But the young
monitors spend most of their time in trees, well away from the adults who
would &quot;take them to lunch&quot; if given the opportunity!<BR>
<BR>
There are no bad parents in the animal world, but there are certainly many
ways to get the job done. The Zoo offers a unique chance to observe the
many strategies employed by animal parents. Take a walk during Zoo Babies
month to make some animal baby observations of your own!<BR>

<H3><CENTER>Exhibit Evolution</CENTER>
</H3>
<BR>
<I>By <B>Doug Feist</B>, Children's Zoo Curator<BR>
</I><BR>
From its inception, the Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Garden has been an
innovator in the changing role of the modern zoo. Our support of in situ
conservation efforts, diverse environmental education programs, specialized
reproductive research, and award-winning exhibits have helped establish
new standards for zoos worldwide.<BR>
<BR>
As zoos evolved, exhibitry has changed from very basic structures to today's
beautiful areas filled with sight, sound and texture. Early zoos resembled
menageries where exhibits were simple cages and the focus was on learning
how to keep unusual animals alive and healthy &shyp; and, if luck allowed,
an occasional animal was born. <BR>
<BR>
In the 1970s and '80s zoos evolved into living museums where naturalistic
dioramas played an important part in exhibitry design. Institutions also
began to work together to manage species of animals keeping the entire animal
population's welfare in mind. The cages have been replaced with natural
exhibits and breeding endangered species has become commonplace. 
<P><CENTER><IMG SRC="oldbirdline.jpg" WIDTH="401" HEIGHT="275" ALIGN="BOTTOM"
NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"><BR>
<B>Old Aviary Line</B></CENTER>
<P>Today the pressures on wildlife and wild places have added new purpose
to the mission of the modern zoo. Zoos are now &quot;immersing&quot; visitors
in wild ecosystems, where animals and plants live together. When visitors
see wild animals in their own habitat, instead of in a tile cell with iron
bars, they are able to witness the animals behaving and interacting as they
would in the wild. With detailed signage and environmental messages, zoo
visitors learn about the complex and fragile rain forest ecosystems &shyp;
which hopefully leads to an understanding of the urgent need to save them.
<BR>
With this new mission in mind, our newest display &quot;Wings of the World:
A Celebration of Flight&quot; takes you to ecosystems in Alaska, Australia,
Asia Africa, and South America. As in most habitats, there are more than
just birds to encounter.<BR>
<BR>
Some of the animals to look for include the small and elusive Kirk's dik
dik (a diminutive antelope from the plains of Africa) lurking in the savannah
display. A group of giant fruit bats in the Australasian exhibit shows that
mammals have also achieved flight. And a keen observer can find the small
but beautiful basilik lizard at home in the brush of the South American
rain forest. <BR>
<BR>
Take an ecosystem exploration in our new &quot;Wings of the World: A Celebration
of Flight&quot; and discover a window to the wild. <BR>

<H2><CENTER>The Bear Necessities</CENTER>
</H2>
<B>By <I>Doug Feist</I>, Curator of Children's Zoo <BR>
<BR>
</B>Bears have long instilled fear and joy - from the myth-inspiring
grizzly to the cuddly &quot;teddy bear&quot; - &nbsp;and are a constant
source of fascination. Although there are only seven distinct bear species,
they are highly adaptive and diverse in behavior. Because of their adaptability,
bears manage to survive in a wide variety of habitats - from the frozen
tundra of the Arctic to the tropical rain forests of the southern hemisphere.
<BR>
<BR>
The family of bears, <I>ursidae</I>, is classified in the mammalian order
<I>carnivora</I> or meat-eating mammals, along with other carnivores such
as cats, dogs, wolves and weasels. Bears are some of the most intelligent,
physically strong, and social of all animals. Perhaps that is why the Zoo
has been exhibiting bears for more than a century beginning with the old
bear pits in 1875 and continuing with the establishment of the bear line
grottos in 1933. <BR>
<BR>
Today Cincinnati Zoo visitors can see three species of bears: the powerful
polar bear; curious spectacled bear; and unusual sloth bear. These animals
are an excellent example of bear diversity in both lifestyle and habitat
utilization. Unfortunately, all three are also endangered in the wild. <BR>

</H5>
<BR>
Polar bears come from the Arctic where they inhabit a range that is farther
north than any other bear species. It is also the most carnivorous of all
the bear species. In the wild, its diet consists of everything from lemmings
to whale calves. Adult polar bears, however, have almost no predators. They
are only vulnerable to adult walruses and humans. Before they were protected
in 1973, polar bears were hunted extensively by trophy and fur hunters.
Today, their number in the wild has been steadily increasing. <BR>
<BR>
Spectacled bears are so named for the rings of yellow fur around their eyes.
They are the only bear species found in South America where their diet consists
of fruits, leaves, and even the occasional cactus. Spectacled bears are
very interesting because, unlike other bear species who sleep in dens on
the ground, they mainly sleep in trees. They are also one of the smallest
and rarest of the bear species. Their endangered status is due to habitat
loss from logging and farming. <BR>
<BR>
Sloth bears come from India and Sri Lanka. They are unique because they
are the only bear species that is specially adapted to feed on insects.
They have long claws which they use to tear open ant and termite mounds
and bee hives. After they gain access to the insects, they use their long,
sticky tongues to lap them up. Unlike other species where only the females
care for the young, both the male and female sloth bear participate in raising
the young. Sloth bears have become scarce in the wild because much of the
habitat has been taken over by humans. <BR>
<BR>
On your next visit to the Zoo, walk along the bear line and discover what
makes these creatures so unique. <BR>

Zoo Notes: African wild dog</H1></TD></TR></TABLE><!--/NOEDIT--></P>

<P></P>

<P><B>by <I>Doug Feist</I>, Curator of Children's Zoo</B></P>

<P>Tall, lean and long legged, the African wild dog (Lycaon pictus) is one
of Africa's most fascinating predators. The calico-colored canine is about
the size of a doberman and is capable of running amazing distances in the
pursuit of their prey. A pack, which consists of about 10 dogs, can inhabit
a home range of up to 500 square miles in open country such as the Serengeti
Plain in Tanzania. </P>

<P>In recent years the dogs' wild population has dropped to precariously
low levels. This was due to an intense and misguided effort by game administrators
and farmers to kill off dogs which they erroneously considered a problem
for livestock. Also, rabies and canine distemper began to take a toll on
now small, isolated pockets of remaining wild dogs. The result is that today
the African wild dog is the second most endangered carnivore in all of Africa,
second only to the Ethiopian wolf. </P>

<P>Recent studies have shed light into the dynamics of wild dog populations
and brought good news for their future in the wild. Wildlife biologist Joshua
Ginsberg has tracked wild dogs in Zimbabwe's Hwange National Park and has
learned that wild dog populations, while small, may not be doomed to extinction
after all. For many years it was thought that the African wild dog was primarily
a plains animal. Out in the wide open veldt the dog competes with other
well organized predators such as lion and hyena for water, den sites and
food, and is an easy target for human persecutors.</P>

<P><IMG SRC="zoonotes.gif" WIDTH="300" HEIGHT="193" ALIGN="LEFT" NATURALSIZEFLAG=
"3">Ginsberg's studies show that healthy populations of African wild dogs
exist in forest ecosystems in Tanzania, Zimbabwe and South Africa. In fact,
these woodlands are now considered the primary habitat for the wild dog
and their population should continue to thrive there into the future.</P>

<P>At the Zoo we are in the process of assembling a breeding group. Pat
Callahan, Head Keeper of the Cat House is responsible for the care of our
African wild dogs which are displayed in the large outdoor grotto next to
the lions. &quot;Most of the wild dogs in captivity are from South Africa
and zoos would like to strengthen the gene pool by obtaining animals from
an East African population,&quot; Callahan said. </P>

<P>Renewed hope for the African wild dog in the woodlands of Africa combined
with a solid genetic base in captive populations may help one of Africa's
most endangered predators slip through the closing noose of extinction.<BR>

<TD WIDTH=432 ALIGN=CENTER VALIGN=CENTER><H1>Interview With A Field Zoologist</H1></TD></TR></TABLE>

<i>By <b>Stan Rullman</b>, Conservation Coordinator</i><p>
<i>Conservation involves research, research and more research as Dr. Alan Rabinowitz (field zoologist for the Wildlife Conservation Society) can attest.  As one of the world's leading field biologists, Rabinowitz has an "Indiana Jones"-style reputation for his work in the field.  And just like the fictional movie character, Rabinowitz inspires young people (such as the ZooÕs Junior Zoologist Club) to develop their interest in science.<p>
   The following is the first of a two-part story developed from conversations with Rabinowitz, a 1995 Barrows Conservation Series lecturer.<p></i>
	As with many people, Rabinowitz started down his career path early in his childhood.  "I was a very shy, introverted child and I had a speech impediment Ð a very serious stuttering handicap that set me apart from people," Rabinowitz said.  "For whatever reason, I could speak to animals without this impediment so animals became my friends."<p>
<IMG SRC="rabino.gif" ALIGN=LEFT>	Years later, when Rabinowitz was studying at the University of Tennessee in Knoxville, he met Dr. George Schaller (Director of Research for the Wildlife Conservation Society) who really set him on the path toward where he is today.  "Dr. Schaller had come to Tennessee to look at what we were doing with the black bears we were studying in the Smoky Mountains," added Rabinowitz. "We got along OK but not famously.  When we parted, we parted as people who had just spent the day together Ð we talked but it was nothing special."<p>
	Rabinowitz never expected to see or hear from the man again.  Then a week later Schaller called one of RabinowitzÕs professors to ask if Rabinowitz wanted to go to Brazil and Belize to survey for jaguars. <p>
	"He gave me $600 to fly down to Belize.  I was supposed to try and estimate in just two months how many jaguars are in the country," noted Rabinowitz.  "What I realized later is that he was testing me for my ability as a field biologist."
	Schaller also wanted to know a count for the jaguar population.  They were getting reports of jaguars being killed on the single road that ran through Belize. There was only one road and a handful of cars and yet there were roadkill jaguars.  So Schaller wanted to know what the story was Ð was this really a little paradise for jaguars?<p>
	Even though heÕd been given only $600 for two months, Rabinowitz ended up staying three months and getting all kinds of data.  He put together a report that set the basis for what happened eventually at Cockscomb.  The government of Belize set aside more than 100,000 acres of subtropical rain forest to establish the Cockscomb Basin Jaguar Reserve, the planet's first (and only) wildlife preserve set aside specifically for a wild cat species.  "That was the start of it all.  That was the beginning."<p>
	Education is, of course, an important part of becoming a field biologist but ... "schools can't teach the passion," according to Rabinowitz.
	"We get people wanting to go out in the field with us all the time ... It doesn't matter, for this field in particular, if someone graduated from Harvard summa cum laude or that they had straight A's," he adds.  
	Although it does matter that they have done well and know their mammal taxonomy or bird taxonomy, Rabinowitz would just as easily take someone with field experience who flunked biology than take someone who has no field experience but has straight A's at Harvard. <p>
	Working in the field, however, is not for everyone.  "Being in the field is wonderful, it's exhilarating, it's inspiring, it's mind-opening.  That's one side of it," Rabinowitz declares.  "The flip side is that it's incredibly lonely and monotonous."<p>
	To do good science, it has to be monotonous by definition, according to Rabinowitz.  "There's some excitement that makes it all worthwhile," he said.
	But it is difficult mentally "Even if you're with other people, you're in a different world, a different culture.  It's not your world," Rabinowitz adds.  "Even if you speak the language, it's not your world.  The longer that you spend out in these countries, the more you find that your whole being is pulled between worlds.  You're never living fully in any one world.  Sometimes that can be exhilarating; sometimes that can become very confusing inside not really knowing where your home is."<p>
     For young people interested in the biological field, Rabinowitz recommends starting in your own back yard.  "A notebook and pen is all that you need to go into the forest.  And for young people who are really interested in nature, in the wild, the best thing you can do is to read as much as possible. Read about nature. Read about animals. Learn what the different animals are," he said.  
	"You should start off locally Ð always start off locally. Learn both the common names and the scientific names of the birds, mammals, and reptiles in your local area," Rabinowitz adds.  "Because those kinds of skills of learning something in your own backyard Ð believe it or not Ð those skills can be translated very easily over into the furthest reaches of the earth."<p>
	"The skills that you need to be a field biologist can and should start no further than in your own backyard," Rabinowitz reiterates.  "The technology is not going to teach you the field skills. You can only learn field skills by going out into your backyard with paper and pencil."<p>

Gabon</H1></TD></TR></TABLE>

<I>By <b>Stan Rullman</b>, Conservation Coordinator</i><P>
Cicadas scream, exotic birds perform elaborate mating calls and 
creatures rustle the delicate underbush.  The jungle is alive across the 
ocean and here in Cincinnati as visitors immerse themselves in the 
sights and sounds of the jungle.<P>
	Zoos use these "immersion" exhibit sounds to transport zoo visitors 
into the private domains of some of the world's most fascinating 
creatures.  The Cincinnati Zoo used this type of exhibit to full effect 
with the opening of award-winning Jungle Trails in 1993.  <P>
	When designing a natural ambient sound system for our "Gorilla World" 
exhibit, the zoo wanted authenticity.  So I thought, "wouldn't it be 
neat to record the sounds in prime lowland gorilla habitat that the 
Cincinnati Zoo is actively involved in helping to protect?"<P>
	<IMG SRC="station.gif" ALIGN=LEFT>Seven months later, I found myself 
lugging cameras, microphones, and a digital audio tape recorder through 
one of the largest protected areas in the greater Congo Basin Ð the 
Gamba Reserve in the Central African country of Gabon. Since 1993 the 
Cincinnati Zoo Conservation Fund has worked cooperatively with the World 
Wildlife Fund's Programme for Gabon in contributing much-needed dollars 
toward conservation projects in the heart of this nearly 900,000-hectare 
reserve. <P>
	My mission to the Gamba Reserve was three-fold: 1) to record several 
hours worth of insects, birds, frogs, and primates to be edited into a 
multi-channel  aural backdrop for our lowland gorilla exhibit; 2) to 
photographically document the wildlife of the reserve, as well as our 
involvement with the World Wildlife Fund (WWF); and 3) to figure out how 
to take our involvement with the WWF to a higher level of cooperation. <P>
	To accomplish these goals I went from wearing a tie in meetings with 
government officials to hiking barefoot through the jungle and having to 
fish for my dinner. <P>
	My arrival in Gabon was timed for the arrival of the rainy season Ð 
typically the noisiest time of the year in a rain forest. These early 
sporadic rains spark the courtship songs and calls of many insects, 
birds and frogs. <P>
	Unfortunately, it rained more than I expected because, in the jungle, 
it rains twice. The first rainfall loads the canopy with water and, 
hours after the clouds have passed, the trees continue to drip their wet 
burden to the forest floor. No big deal unless you're using 
ultra-sensitive audio equipment. Then every drip is like a rifle-shot.<P>
	It wasn't too long ago that rifle shots were common in this region. 
Much of the Gamba Complex had been set aside in domaine de chasses or 
hunting preserves. While commercial "big game" sport hunting brought 
some income to the local community, it did so at a very high cost for 
hundreds of forest elephants, African buffalo, leopards, and even 
chimpanzees and gorillas. Fortunately, with the protected status of the 
African elephant and recent Gabonese land usage laws, sport hunting has 
ceased in the Gamba Re serve.<P>
	The threat to Gabon's wild creatures, though, is not over.  For 
decades, Gabon's human population was held in check by a low fertility Ð 
and thus a low reproductive Ð rate (when compared to much of the rest of 
the continent). Modern medicine may be on the verge of solving that 
problem, but in so doing creates another problem for the wildlife. <P>
	A large percentage of the Gabonese people prefer "bush meat" as their 
protein source. "Bush meat" is the term given to wild game harvested 
from the forests, savannahs, and waterways and includes such species as 
African brushy-tailed porcupines, duikers, pythons, pangolins, 
elephants, primates, and almost anything else that moves. (I was told my 
best bet for seeing a gorilla or chimpanzee in Gabon was in the local 
market- quartered for human consumption.)  This amounts to more than 
four tons of bush meat per year being sold in the capital city of 
Libreville alone!<P>
	One WWF-supported project is trying to breed one of Gabon's local 
agricultural pests, the cane rat, for the bush meat market. The cane rat 
is a large rodent, just a little smaller than a groundhog, that also 
happens to be a prefered bush meat item. By catching these cane rats 
from the fields and raising them in large pens, the people can reduce 
the effects of a pest and take some of the hunting pressure off of the 
more threatened bush meat animals such as gorillas, chimpanzees, forest 
elephants, pangolins, and West African manatees. Since captive breeding 
skills are a Cincinnati Zoo specialty, we are pledging our assistance to 
this worthwhile project. <P>
   Because of bush meat demand and previous sport hunting, much of the 
wildlife in Gabon still maintains a cautious flight distance, making 
photography and recording audio rather challenging. As such, my first 
couple of attempts to record audio were rather unsuccessful. Wearing my 
usual "jungle attire" (long pants, a loose, long-sleeved shirt, poncho, 
insect repellant, and hiking boots, as well as a huge backpack full of 
equipment) made me sound like a herd of elephants crashing through the bush. <P>
	Over time though, I began to leave unnecessary gear behind, carrying 
only the minimum equipment required to get the sounds I needed. I also 
began to hike barefoot Ð resulting in a more cautious pace and careful 
placement of my feet. Suddenly wildlife I had only heard racing off in 
the woods could be seen (and recorded) without scaring them to Timbuktu 
(only about 1,600 miles to the northwest)! <P>
	This shedding of barriers between myself and the jungle was a big step 
in getting a good selection of sounds, but it was much more than that. I 
realized that this was a big part of my work at the Zoo as a naturalist 
Ð removing the filters and barriers be tween us and the natural world. <P>
	Many environmental problems have occurred because we are removed from 
the effects of our impact. We don't spend time hiking the creeks that 
end up carrying away our wastes from old ineffective septic systems. In 
an effort to leave the crowded cities, we carve up the remaining 
woodlots into tiny parcels of land. And during our drives to work, our 
vision is often clouded by the haze we helped create the day before. <P>
	Immersion exhibits are just one way we are removing old barriers 
between us and the natural world. Our work as environmental educators is 
another.  Sometimes you have to go halfway around the world to get a 
better perspective of how important your work is at home. And sometimes 
you have to go barefoot.<P>

<TD WIDTH=432 ALIGN=CENTER VALIGN=CENTER><H1>Indonesia: Tales of a 
Komodo Dragon Adventure</H1></TD></TR></TABLE>

<I>By <b>Michelle Padilla</b>, Publicity Intern</i><P>
	Plotlines for some of Hollywood's greatest action flicks can't compare 
with the real life adventures of <b>Johnny Arnett</b> on a recent 
expedition to Indonesia. <P> 
In December, Arnett (Zoo Area Supervisor of Reptiles, Amphibian, and 
Fish) traveled to Bogor, Indonesia for an international meeting of zoos, 
conservation societies and governments concerned with the status of 
Komodo dragons.<P> 
	Komodo dragons, the world's largest lizards, can grow up to ten feet 
long and can weigh as much as 300 pounds.  They are quick, aggressive, 
carnivorous and occasionally cannibalistic animals.  The dragons live in 
Indonesia on the Lesser Sunda Islands of Komodo, Flores, Padar and 
Rintja.  They were unknown by the outside world until 1912 and are now 
considered a national treasure of Indonesia and are protected by 
national and international treaties.<P> 
	The purpose of the meeting was to do a Population and Habitat Viability 
Analysis (PHVA).  A PHVA is a report that looks at the state of a species 
in its natural habitat and in captivity to determine the outlook for the 
animal's future.  The groundbreaking work accomplished will be used as 
baseline information for ongoing and future studies.<P> 
	After the meetings concluded, the real fun began.  Arnett joined Donal 
Boyer of the San Diego Zoo, Rick Hudson of the Fort Worth Zoo, and Terry 
Fredeking of Antibody Systems, Inc. on a trip to the islands of Komodo 
and Rintja to see the dragons.  <P> 
	"We were concerned about the state of the wild population," Arnett 
said.  "The dragons are an island species and even minute changes can 
adversely affect their survival."<P> 
The travelers planned to fly to their destination because the 
Indo-nesians warned them that traveling by boat would be hazardous due 
to strong currents and whirlpools. But, after getting stuck at a Bima 
airport, they decided to forgo the advice and rented a fishing boat to 
finish their journey.  <P>  
They quickly discovered what the Indonesians already knew.  The crossing 
was harrowing as rough waters churned around the boat which, 
unfortunately, didn't happen to have any life vests or night lights.  
After 10 hours of knucklesplitting, they finally landed at Flores (they 
wouldn't say if they kissed the ground.) Ð the base camp for their side 
trips. <P> 
 The next day, they took a boat ride to the island of Rintja where they 
spent seven hours walking off their sea legs.  They saw three Komodo 
dragons as well as water buffalo and other wildlife before returning to 
Flores.<P> 
The next morning, a speedboat took them to Komodo Island.  During a 
long, hot hike they saw a lot of wildlife including dragons, boars, Rusa 
deer, cockatoos and megapode birds.<P> 
They learned  new behavioral information from the rangers.  
"Obser-vations from people working with wild animals can help those of 
us working with the captive populations to provide optimal living and 
breeding conditions," Arnett added.  They also learned that their travel 
excitement was not quite finished.  They still had to fly from Flores to 
Bali.  Along the way the engines went dead while they were in the air 
and, though the pilots were able to get them running again within a few 
minutes, the group's nervousness stayed with them until they were 
standing safely on solid ground.<P> 
Despite the hazardous travel, the trip was quite a success.  "We found 
our concerns for the wild populations were unfounded, the population is 
stable," Arnett added.  "We also found that the Indonesians are very 
competent with these animals, both in zoos and in the wild."<P> 
	To make an already successful trip even better, discussions were 
started with the director of the Jogjakarta Zoo in Java, Indonesia about 
bringing a female Komodo dragon to the Cincinnati Zoo.<P> 
	"Since she is not related to any of the other dragons in the United 
States, her bloodline will add diversity to the gene pool," Arnett 
explained.   The Cincinnati Zoo currently owns two adult male dragons 
and 16 baby dragons.<P>

Work</H1></TD></TR></TABLE>

<I>By <B>Stan Rullman</B> Conservation Coordinator <BR>
<BR>
This is the second part of a two-part story based on conversations with
Dr. Alan Rabinowitz, field zoologist for the Wildlife Conservation Society
and a 1995 Barrows Conservation Series lecturer. <BR>
<BR>
</I>Working on the front line of wildlife conservation is an &quot;Indiana
Jones&quot; style of life without the glamour or Hollywood screenings. When
Dr. Alan Rabinowitz recounts his many experiences, the stories run the gamut
of field sites and emotions. From the joy of releasing a jaguar in a protected
area to the despair of seeing the effects of abject poverty, a field zoologist
sees it all. It can be exhilarating as well as physically and mentally draining.
<BR>
<BR>
Rabinowitz learned this on his very first &quot;field trip.&quot; Because
the trip to Belize was his first, he regards Belize as his favorite place
to study. &quot;But the fact of the matter is, when I was in Belize at the
time, it was torturing me,&quot; Rabinowitz said. &quot;It was so hard,
I had to leave. I felt I was physically and mentally drained as a person.&quot;
<P><CENTER><IMG SRC="cat.gif" WIDTH="250" HEIGHT="171" ALIGN=middle NATURALSIZEFLAG=
"3"><B>Jaguar in Belize</B></CENTER>
<P>It was his first big, new, international field experience and, according
to him, no other place, no matter how wonderful and how beautiful could
ever match your first.' The fact that it was such a success story for him
also makes it even more special. His work there culminated in the planet's
first and only wildlife preserve set aside specifically for a wild cat species.
<BR>
<BR>
But most field work involves a lot of highs and lows. His work in Asia,
for example, was a real &quot;love/hate relationship.&quot; He loved the
culture and the Asian values but hated what he saw happening with the wildlife,
politics and corruption. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;But that's a part of it all,&quot; he added. So a place may be great
culturally but environmentally, in terms of working with the wildlife and
the hunters, they can be 'depressing.' <BR>
<BR>
That is why field work is so essential. Places such as Borneo, Burma and
Laos are just now in the making. They're beautiful, they're awe inspiring,
but they are very sad as well. You see the poverty. These are not vacation
spots. <BR>
<BR>
And, of course, there are scary moments. &quot;The absolute scariest was
the plane crash in Belize, because I truly felt I was going to die in those
few seconds before the crash,&quot; Rabinowitz emphasizes. &quot;That was
the most life-threatening scare to me.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
But frightening experiences often involve some things even more volatile
than mechanical equipment. Once, when Rabinowitz was releasing a jaguar
as part of a relocation project, the angry animal jumped at him as he stood
on top of the animal's enclosure. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Instead of running off into the forest, it turned around and leaped
at me, and I jumped back into the back of the pick-up truck,&quot; he said.
&quot;It tried to jump into the bed of the pickup truck with me. It roared
and I was convinced it was going to tear me apart.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Fortunately, it leaped too soon and knocked its belly into the rear of the
pickup truck causing it to fall back, knocking the wind out of it. It could
have just as easily jumped back into the bed of the pickup but instead it
looked at him and walked off into the forest. <BR>
<BR>
Despite that scare, Rabinowitz's love of cats remains intact. As head of
the global tiger campaign, he is concerned about the future for tigers in
the wild. <BR>
<BR>
Tigers are declining at a fairly rapid rate. Not just because people are
killing tigers for the medicinal trade but, even more importantly, because
of the massive poaching of the tigers' prey. That is why, in areas where
there are good numbers of tigers, they are turning to killing cattle because
their natural food is becoming scarce. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Local hunters are literally taking the food out of the tiger's mouth
which is as bad as putting a gun to the tiger's head and killing it,&quot;
Rabinowitz said. <BR>
<BR>
But Rabinowitz has hope. He believes that they are catching it early enough.
Although tiger numbers are down tremendously, there are still adequate populations
spread out over a large area, with some good habitat remaining in Siberia,
Sumatra, India and Indochina. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;They're disjunct populations but they're good and they're viable,&quot;
he maintains. &quot;We are not looking at situations like we have with certain
other species like the Sumatran Rhino in which we're trying to bring an
animal back from near extinction.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
This is good because a massive campaign now is going on to save tigers which
are in trouble and declining but not yet at the brink of extinction. According
to Rabinowitz, that means they can save viable numbers. And, since tigers
breed well both in captivity and in the wild, with good key populations
protected they can come back. <BR>
<BR>
Rabinowitz is also excited about field work involving discoveries of new
species (such as the Pseudooryx in Vietnam and Laos). There could be other
undiscovered large vertebrates around the planet, especially in rugged,
remote areas. &quot;I think a lot of places hold new and exciting discoveries,&quot;
Rabinowitz said. <BR>
<BR>
It may not be glamorous but working in field zoology has immeasurable rewards,
both tangible and in tangible. <BR>

<BR>
<BR>
Wetlands. The word conjures up images of swamps, bogs and marshes. But wetlands
are much more. They are wet meadows, the floodplains of rivers, the shorelines
of lakes, and the mineral-rich areas known as fens. All of these are areas
with water at or near the surface of the soil for at least part of the year.
All have plants that can tolerate and grow in very wet, saturated conditions.<BR>
Only 200 years ago, Ohio included 5 million acres of wetlands &shyp; about
one-fifth of the state's total area. Since that time, about 90% of these
acres have been drained, primarily for agriculture. This is a significant
loss, considering the value of wetlands for maintaining water quality, flood
control, and harboring a great diversity of plant and animal life.<BR>
<BR>
Many endangered and threatened plant species can be found in Ohio's wetlands.
While the rarity of these species is documented, little is known about the
plants themselves. The Center for Reproduction of Endangered Wildlife's
(CREW) Plant Conservation Division is asking the question, &quot;can the
seeds of these species be preserved in liquid nitrogen in CREW's Ohio Seed
Bank, as are the seeds of other rare Ohio plants?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The research on these species centers on whether or not the seeds can survive
drying out &shyp; a process that is very normal for many types of seeds.
For example, seed packs we buy for our gardens have seeds which are dry
and need to take up water before they start growing. Researchers have found
that seeds which are in the dry state are very adaptable to cryopreservation
in liquid nitrogen.<BR>
Because they live in such wet conditions, it is thought that some wetland
species have seeds which cannot tolerate drying. If this is true, they also
cannot be frozen for storage in a seed bank. But very few wetland seeds
have been studied to confirm this.<BR>
<BR>
Two grants &shyp; from the Robert H. Reakirt Foundation and the L & L Nippert
Charitable Foundation &shyp; and the collaboration with the Division of
Natural Areas and Preserves at the Ohio Department of Natural Resources
have helped CREW study the seeds of wetland species to determine their tolerance
for drying and freezing. Zoo intern Nyree Conard is working on this project.<BR>
Surprisingly, the research thus far indicates that a number of these species
do very well and these have been added to the Ohio Seed Bank. Work is continuing
this summer to study more of Ohio's endangered and threatened species in
order to help preserve the rich diversity of these very special areas.<BR>

<BR>

<BR>
One of the most celebrated animals in the Cincinnati Zoo is the Pacific
walrus, Odobenus romarus divergens. Their charismatic charm and antics have
endeared these aquatic giants to the public from the first time they waved
to, or &quot;accidentally&quot; soaked the visitors at their exhibit in
1987. The Zoo's resident walruses, Bruiser and Aituk, became well known
personalities and were the first walruses ever to be exhibited in Cincinnati.
These two appealing creatures were captured together when an expedition
led by Eskimo and Sea World personnel collected the orphaned pups from the
ice flows of the Bering Sea. <BR>
<BR>
In 1995, Aituk passed away due to liver disease. Now, Bruiser will be traveling
to Florida, where the Zoo's computer dating service has found a group of
adult females that are anxiously awaiting his arrival. While it will be
difficult to see Bruiser leave, it will also be an opportunity to place
this animal in a situation where he can propagate. This cooperative effort
among zoos helps ensure a secure future for the captive population of walrus.
<BR>
<BR>
Permits were granted by the United States Fish & Wildlife under the Marine
Mammal Act to collect orphaned pups in the Bering Sea off the coast of St.
Lawrence Island. The expedition was led by a Zoo team made up of Matt Miller
and David Oehler &shyp; seasoned travelers to Savoonga on Puffin and Auklet
expeditions in 1993 and 1994. The remainder of the group included Dave Jardine
who had worked with Bruiser and Aituk and Zoo Veterinarian Dr. Ken Cameron.
Scott Drieschman, of Wildlife Concepts International, assisted us in the
logistics of the expedition and the care of the walrus pups. We were fortunate
to have Clarence Waghiyi as our guide in Savoonga; he was on two other Zoo
excursions. Two other natives of the village, Nelson and Julius Alowa, volunteered
to join us in our adventure.
<P><CENTER><IMG SRC="walrus.jpg" WIDTH="220" HEIGHT="332" ALIGN="BOTTOM"
NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></CENTER>
<P>When the Zoo began to look for a mate for Bruiser, we searched all the
zoos and aquariums in the United States but there were no single females
available to move to Cincinnati. Sea World of Florida was then contacted
and they were very excited at the prospect of Bruiser returning to their
facility and joining the group of walruses there. While this would be great
for Bruiser, it would leave us with an empty walrus exhibit. The only alternative
would be to acquire other walruses by means of purchasing, having another
zoo loan us their walruses, or collect individuals from somewhere else.
Due to the popularity and rarity of walruses in other facilities, there
were no other animals available to us in the United States. <BR>
<BR>
Sometimes events seem to fall into place. Over the last several years, Zoo
staff members have been traveling to the village of Savoonga on St. Lawrence
Island to bring back puffin and auklets for the new &quot;Wings of the World&quot;
display. Savoonga, or as the Eskimo call it &quot;The Walrus Capital of
the World,&quot; consists of subsistence hunters. These people live a hard
life almost totally dependent on their hunting skills and the other meager
sustenance the land offers. The Eskimo have harvested Pacific walrus for
thousands of years on this subsistence basis for food and supplies with
a negligible impact on the population. <BR>
<BR>
Despite the difficulties they face, the Eskimo opened their homes to our
staff. When the Eskimo learned we were looking for walrus pups, we were
invited to come back to Savoonga and accompany the Eskimo on their boats
so we could search for orphaned pups on the ice flows north of the island.
We soon learned that accompanying the Eskimo meant being in their skin-bottom
or small aluminum boats among ice flows in the freezing waters of the Bering
Sea for up to several days at a time, since this was the only way to find
any of these orphaned pups. <BR>
<BR>
Once the walrus pups were found, they were taken back to Savoonga as rapidly
as possible where Zoo staff began to care for them. A chartered flight was
then needed to move the pups off St. Lawrence Island to Anchorage and special
arrangements were made with a cargo air-carrier to move our precious packages
to Cincinnati while maintaining the appropriate temperature and air pressure.
Ken Cameron flew with the pups and constantly checked their condition and
made sure the crates were iced down to keep each walrus comfortable. Once
Ken and the pups reached the airport a refrigerated truck carried them back
to the Zoo.<BR>
<BR>
These walrus pups will serve as ambassadors for the delicate environment
of the far north. While the walrus population is relatively healthy, the
Arctic environment they need to survive is sensitive to disturbances by
man. Other marine life depend on the walruses to displace nutrients from
the ocean floor as they search for food in order to survive. Predators such
as the polar bear and killer whale utilize the walruses directly as an important
source of food. Oil spills and exploration are an obvious threat to marine
life including the walrus, while other perils are more obscure. Toxins found
in the environment &shyp; such as mercury, cadmium and others &shyp; are
a risk to the marine mammals over a longer period of time. These toxins
are stored in the fat of the walrus and not only cause health problems for
the adults but the same toxins are concentrated in the milk fed to the pups,
resulting in their death.<BR>
<BR>
The walrus pups can be seen taking their bottles of formula four to five
times a day at the Walrus exhibit. These three- to four-week-old babies
look like little old men with their pudgy whiskered faces. For the next
year and a half, each pup will take more than a quart and a half of formula
per day from their bottles. In a month or two they will be introduced to
solids but will continue to be fed formula until they are weaned onto a
diet of fish, clams and other seafood (after they have gained 350 pounds!).
Explore a world of wonder, explore the walrus &shyp; the giants of the Arctic.<BR>
The walrus pups are scheduled to go on display in June.<BR>

<BR>
Walruses are found in the frigid waters of the Northern Hemisphere, with
the largest subspecies inhabiting the Bering and Chukchi Seas. Weighing
as much as two tons, these large members of the pinniped family apparently
derived their English name from the Dutch &quot;walrus&quot; or &quot;walros&quot;
meaning &quot;sea horse&quot; and &quot;sea cow.&quot; The Eskimo know them
by the Inuit name of &quot;aivik&quot; or &quot;amak&quot; and &quot;amaghak&quot;
by the Aleut.<BR>
<BR>
In the water, walruses use their hind flippers to gracefully propel themselves
and use the front flippers as rudders to change direction. Walruses can
even sleep in the water. Floating around like huge bobbers, they inflate
their neck pouches with air and rest comfortably. <BR>
<BR>
It is in the water that walruses feel most at home and where they use their
swimming abilities to dive to the bottom of the sea to clam-dig for the
invertebrates they feed on. It is believed the walrus uses their 400 sensitive
whiskers &shyp; called mystacial vibrissae &shyp; to feel for mollusks on
the sea floor in a manner that is really better described as grazing. While
diving to great depths in search of food, the walrus pumps blood from the
blubber to the underlying tissues and organs. That is why when the animals
surface their skin appears to have been bleached, but quickly turns a reddish
brown as the blood returns to the surface of the skin.<BR>
<BR>
Walruses are very social animals, traveling through the water in small groups.
When they haul out on the shore or ice, they are in groups of up to several
thousand. The population of the Pacific walrus is now strong throughout
its range and has a population of more than 232,500 individuals &shyp; up
from the estimated 170,000 in 1972 when the population had not yet recovered
from the over exploitation of non-Eskimo hunters. While the population now
appears stable, environmental threats such as future oil exploration could
jeopardize all the wildlife in the areas they are found.<BR>

<I>By <B>Michelle Padilla</B>, Publicity Intern</I><BR>
<BR>
We fry them for breakfast, color them at Easter and find their shells in
the spring grass. Eggs &shyp; they're everywhere. And they are not exclusive
to birds. Most reptiles, amphibians, fish and insects lay them, even a few
mammals.<BR>
<BR>
Everyone is familiar with bird eggs because they are the most visible and
accessible. The size of bird eggs varies tremendously. The ostrich, the
largest living bird, lays white eggs that weigh up to 3 pounds. In contrast,
the Cuban bee hummingbird, the world's smallest bird, lays eggs no larger
than peas!<BR>
<BR>
Oology (the collection and study of eggs) shows us that shapes and colors
of birds' eggs are often related to protective strategies. Birds that nest
in holes or other cavities, like owls and woodpeckers, lay eggs that are
rounded and white so they can be seen in the dark nest by the parent. Birds
that nest on ledges, like seabirds, usually have a pyriform or pointed egg
to keep them from rolling out of the nest. Birds that nest in the open lay
colored eggs to camouflage them with the environment.
<P><CENTER><IMG SRC="woodeggs.jpg" WIDTH="220" HEIGHT="201" ALIGN="MIDDLE"
NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></CENTER>
<P>While birds are nesting and caring for their eggs, most reptiles are
busy laying and burying them. Because they are usually buried and don't
need to be camouflaged, reptile eggs are white. According to Johnny Arnett,
area supervisor of reptiles, amphibians and fish at the Cincinnati Zoo,
&quot;reptiles don't give much parental care, though some species will protect
their nests.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Some pythons will actually incubate their eggs by contracting their muscles
to raise their body temperature. Because reptiles are cold blooded, incubation
depends on the ambiant temperature. &quot;Eggs are subjected to external
factors, such as heat and humidity,&quot; said Arnett.<BR>
<BR>
All bird eggs have hard shells, but not all reptile eggs do. According to
Arnett, there are two basic kinds of reptile eggs &shyp; hard-shelled eggs,
which turtles and crocodilians lay, and leathery or flexible eggs, which
some snakes and lizards lay. To hatch from their eggs, snakes are endowed
with an egg tooth that they use to cut their way out of their shell.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The reproductive cycles of amphibians are very bizarre,&quot; said
Robin Saunders, keeper at the Reptile House and Aquarium. According to Saunders,
all amphibians lay eggs, but some are incubated internally. Gastric brooding
frogs will swallow their eggs and incubate them in their stomach until they
hatch, then the young will be regurgitated. Suriname toads deposit eggs
on the female's back where a thin layer of skin soon grows over them. When
the tadpoles are ready to hatch, they burst out from underneath the skin
and swim away.<BR>
<BR>
The brightly colored poison dart frogs, according to Saunders, will aggressively
protect their eggs. &quot;They will try to frighten predators away,&quot;
said Saunders. &quot;They've even tried to frighten me away!&quot; Poison
dart frogs lay their eggs on land and urinate on them to keep them from
drying out. The eggs will start to wiggle when they are ready to hatch.
This alerts the parent who will step on the eggs to break them open and
free the babies. Once they are hatched, the babies will crawl on the parent's
back for a ride to the water. <BR>
<BR>
Insect eggs are as diverse as amphibians are bizarre. &quot;Insect eggs
range in size from as small as a pinpoint to as large as one-fourth of an
inch across,&quot; said Randy Morgan, head keeper at Insect World. Similar
to reptiles, insects can have hard egg cases, like most walking sticks,
or soft eggs, like most aquatic insects.<BR>
<BR>
The New Guinea walking stick lays its dark grey eggs underground where they
stay for about two months before hatching into nymphs that look like miniature
adults. The female giant water bug deposits her eggs on the back of the
male who carries them around for about three weeks before they hatch. Social
insects, like ants, actually have workers who care for the eggs and larvae.
This is a big job because, according to Morgan, &quot;leafcutting ants can
lay up to a million eggs per year!&quot;<BR>
Eggs are an important adaptation for many creatures. The size, shape, surface
and color of eggs all play a part in their survival strategy which has been
shaped by evolution. <BR>

<BR>
<BR>
<I>By <B>Angela Osborne</B>, Editor <BR>
<BR>
</I>Centuries of &quot;flight envy&quot; have given way to admiration, fascination
and even commiseration for our winged comrades. Now man can explore the
wonder of winged wildlife in the Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Garden's newly
renovated and expanded bird house &shyp; &quot;Wings of the World: A Celebration
of Flight&quot; which opened June 29 with a special member preview. Often
taken for granted, birds are actually &quot;flying feathered dinosaurs&quot;
and have much to teach us about adapting to our environment. While man has
only climbed into the sky within the last century, birds have evolved their
flying &shyp; and non-flying habits for over 150 million years. <BR>
<P><CENTER><IMG SRC="puffin.jpg" WIDTH="200" HEIGHT="257" ALIGN="BOTTOM"
NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></CENTER>
<P>&quot;Birds have a great diversity of adaptations of form and behavior
that is closely related to their habitats, so we have a lot to learn from
them,&quot; said Dr. Edward J. Maruska, executive director of the Cincinnati
Zoo and Botanical Garden. &quot;Their characteristics make them excellent
indicators of biodiversity and serve as a natural barometer for the health
of habitats or ecosystems.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The bird house, originally built in 1937 as a reptile house, was converted
to hold birds in 1951. The $4 million renovation now allows exotic birds
to fly. In addition to enlarging and modernizing exhibit areas, the renovation
also includes extensive upgrading and repairs to the building's infrastructure.
Behind the scenes are state-of-the art holding areas, nursery, and keeper
areas.<BR>
<BR>
This new exhibit also marks another Zoo milestone. It is the first time
a zoo in the United States has successfully kept three alcids &shyp; least,
crested and parakeet auklets &shyp; short-winged marine diving birds found
in the Arctic region. Other alcids in the new exhibit include horned puffins
and murres.<BR>
<BR>
While many zoo-goers are familiar with the birds of the south pole &shyp;
the penguins &shyp; northern birds are not quite as familiar. &quot;We're
displaying them to increase awareness of species that live in delicate habitats
other than just rain forests and wetlands,&quot; said David Oehler, who
directs the Aviculture department. &quot;We need to care for and protect
these habitats so we don't place undue pressures on the animals within them.&quot;
<BR>
<P><CENTER><IMG SRC="penguin.jpg" WIDTH="220" HEIGHT="334" ALIGN="BOTTOM"
NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></CENTER>
<P>Alcids are a group of 22 species of short-winged marine birds from northern
coastal regions. They are adapted to life in chilly waters, shooting through
the sea to catch fish. <BR>
<BR>
In August, 1992, Oehler and his staff went to St. Lawrence Island in the
Bering Strait off the western coast of Alaska on a trip funded by PNC Bank
to bring back these beautiful birds. Auklets in the wild make their home
in boulder fields along the coast while puffins are found in nesting burrows
in sea cliffs.<BR>
<BR>
Because alcids are delicate creatures requiring exacting conditions in the
wild and delicate care in captivity, both exhibits required the Zoo to duplicate
the birds' habitat. Water quality and air quality have to be perfect. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;The display includes special air and water filters employed to insure
the animals' health,&quot; Oehler added. &quot;It just demonstrates how
delicate polar habitats are, especially around the coasts.&quot;<BR>
The auklet exhibit mimics the coastline of the islands off Alaska, having
special burrows and ledges to allow the birds to breed readily. The puffins,
meanwhile, live in cliff-like surroundings much like their natural habitat.<BR>
<BR>
Each microhabitat display both inside and outside the new exhibit allows
the delicate avians to demonstrate the power of their species. Visitors
can climb into large nests to see how birds use flight to access otherwise
inaccessible areas &shyp; giving them an advantage over other animals. <BR>
<BR>
Once inside, visitors can walk through a tropical habitat of South America
and stand on an elevated deck peering into a rain forest canopy where the
vibrant hue of more than 200 small, free-flying tropical avians fill the
sky. Within this humid climate, waterfalls crash, turtles run amok and mist
hangs in the air. Children have their own bird blind where they can watch
the birds up close through binoculars and check their field guide just like
a real biologist. <BR>
<BR>
Interactive exhibits demonstrate the ageless wonder and engineering excellence
of the avian body with its hollow bones, air sacs and lack of teeth. A flight
interpretive station demonstrates lift, motion, and adaptations with fun
hands-on activities. Turn a crank to create wind blowing across the cutaway
section of a wing. The faster it's turned, the stronger the wind will be
and the faster the wing will rise. Nearby, use a CD-Rom and push a computer
mouse to make a bird fly &shyp; making wings extend and fold with each stroke.
<P><CENTER><IMG SRC="decal.gif" WIDTH="211" HEIGHT="197" ALIGN="BOTTOM"
NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></CENTER>
<P>Parents might want to avoid the bird scale but children will delight
to stand on a scale to see how much they would weigh if they had the weight-reducing
adaptations of the eagle which increases their strength and efficiency.
Next, a chart shows how long a person's wingspan would need to be if they
could fly like an eagle.<BR>
<BR>
Visitors can also discover the diversity of microhabitats which show how
a lot of animals exploit smaller areas or niches in a vast area. A montane
exhibit shows thick-billed parrots and masked bobwhite quail living the
harsh climate of high altitudes. Next, a savannah grassland is home for
royal starlings and carmine bee-eaters where, because there are few trees,
they have adapted to take advantage of the resources found in the grasses.<BR>
<BR>
Conversely, the Zoo's swampy marsh exhibit shows visitors the importance
of waterways to flight. Watch African pygmy geese and see how water transforms
their way of life. Meanwhile, the always popular penguin exhibit takes you
right up to the frolicking King penguins, Magellan penguins and Rockhopper
penguins.<BR>
<BR>
It's an avian adventure by land, air or sea. Visit the new &quot;Wings of
the World: A Celebration of Flight&quot; and discover the majestic beauty
of flight.<BR>

<BR>
CREW (the Carl H. Lindner, Jr. Family Center for Reproduction of Endangered Wildlife) is as much a learning center for guests as it is for researchers. By visiting CREW's Endangered Species Garden and Public Exhibit, visitors can learn more about CREW, it
s ongoing research and the role it plays in preserving endangered species from extinction.<P>
The Endangered Species Garden &#173; located on either side of the entrance &#173; has four habitat areas with rare plants from Ohio and around the world. New this year is a Medicinal Garden where visitors can see a number of plants which are used in phar
maceuticals and traditional medicine. In the spring you can see the Mayapple plant &#173; a semisynthetic derivative of its root is used for testicular and small-cell lung cancer. You'll also find a species of willow &#173; the salicylic acid in its bark 
was the precursor to aspirin.<P>
Inside the building there is a new video game, Sim Life, where you are challenged to successfully solve the problems presented in areas such as: creating and modifying worlds, creating and modifying plants and animals at the genetic level, designing envir
onments and ecosystems and more. <P>
Another exhibit is the new American Express&#129; display which will allow visitors to see the similarities between natural reproduction and artificial (or assisted) reproduction in both plants and animals.<P>
The greenhouse window has been redone with a naturalistic display of various tropical plants, thanks to the hard work of Tony Wetzel, horticulture staff member, and Nyree Conard, a horticulture and CREW intern. <P>
If you haven't been to CREW before, you'll also want to see the video monitor which shows some of the procedures used in CREW's Animal Conservation Division and the Family Album displaying the animals produced as a result of high-tech procedures used in c
onservation efforts.<P>
So on your next trip to the Zoo, don't forget to visit CREW and experience the world of scientific research and what it can mean for the conservation efforts of plants and animals worldwide. CREW is located next to the Coors Pavilion and is open daily, no
on-4 p.m. <P>

When you visit &quot;Wings of the World: A Celebration of Flight&quot; be
sure to notice the new landscape which displays plants that you can use
to attract birds to your yard. With their songs, colors, and fascinating
activity, songbirds are some of the most welcome visitors to our homes and
gardens. <BR>
<BR>
You can increase your garden's appeal by adding plants that birds prefer
for food, cover, and nesting. Use plants that produce flowers, fruits, and
seeds at different seasons. Provide cover and nesting sites by planting
a variety of evergreen and deciduous trees and shrubs. Add bird baths for
drinking and bathing. 
<P><CENTER><IMG SRC="hornedowl.jpg" WIDTH="230" HEIGHT="348" ALIGN="BOTTOM"
NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"><BR>
<B>A Great Horned Owl</B></CENTER>
<P>Many attractive landscape plants have fruits and berries that are irresistible
to our native songbirds. Some of these include dogwoods, firethorn, viburnums,
and hollies. For seed-eaters like goldfinches, plant colorful sun-loving
perennials like purple coneflower and black-eyed Susans to provide food
and snacks when they go to seed. One of the most delightful of native birds
are the tiny ruby-throated hummingbirds. Our new hummingbird garden area
displays many of their favorite flowers, including columbine, coralbells,
bee-balm, and trumpet vine.<BR>
<BR>
Plants throughout the garden area are labeled, providing valuable information
about the plants and their ecological relationships with birds. Gardening
for birds is an enjoyable way to beautify your yard and learn about wildlife.
Creating habitats for songbirds benefits our feathered friends, our property
values, and our local ecology.<BR>
<BR>
To find out more about gardening for birds a class will be offered on July
25 at 7 p.m., taught by <B>Dave Ehrlinger</B>, Director of Horticulture.

Daylilies are one of the easiest plants to grow and care for but also one
of the largest varieties of perennials. Every gardener knows the delightful
color daylilies add to the landscape. Be sure to stop by the Botanical Center
on July 13, noon-4 p.m., to see the colorful daylily display brought to
us by the Daylily Society. Members will be on hand to answer daylily care
and cultivation questions and offer daylilies for sale.<BR>
The Indoor Bonsai Company will have a display of bonsai plants in the Botanical
Center the week of August 12-August 18. These miniature delights are always
intriguing and a great conversation piece. Jim Davis of the Indoor Bonsai
Company will be on hand Sunday, August 18, noon-4 p.m., to answer bonsai
questions. There will also be bonsai plants for sale. Be sure to mark your
calendar for these upcoming events.<BR>

<B>By <I>Susan M. Charls</I> and <I>Virginia M. Geiger</I>, CREW Co-ops,<BR>
and <I>Dr. Valerie Pence</I>, Acting CREW Director<BR>
</B><BR>
CREW moved another large step forward in their plant conservation research
on their latest sojourn to the Caribbean isle of Trinidad. By testing the
use of fungicides and combinations of antibiotics, CREW researchers found
that plant tissue &quot;contamination can be fairly well controlled&quot;
 an important step in their ultimate goal of preserving and propagating
endangered plants.<BR>
With the addition of two well-trained co-ops to lend a hand, CREW was also
able to collect a record 3,000 samples samples which they are now
attempting to regenerate in the CREW Plant Lab. <BR>
<BR>
Here is their story:<BR>
With calluses on our fingers, sunburn on our backs and fatigue still in
our bones, we returned from our excursion to Trinidad. We had the privilege
of accompanying CREW staff members Dr. Valerie Pence and Bernadette Plair
on a collection trip to Trinidad.<BR>
<BR>
Over the past year we have worked in the Plant Lab as co-op students from
the College of Mount St. Joseph in a program funded by the Charlotte R.
Schmidlapp Fund. Our work with the in vitro collection (IVC) project in
Cincinnati prepared us for the IVC work we did in Trinidad.<BR>

<BR>
This was the fourth CREW trip to Trinidad to study the IVC technique. Four
days were spent in the lush, tropical forest gathering small pieces of plant
tissue to bring back to the CREW research facility in small vials for further
study. While in the forest, we encountered the native wildlife most
notably, a red-tailed tree boa (known to the locals as Macajuel), which
we nicknamed &quot;Norton.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
On this trip, we worked to refine methods of gathering plant tissue for
growth in the lab. We tested the effectiveness of antibiotics and various
media on controlling contamination in tropical plant tissue cultures. <BR>
<BR>
The four of us worked well as a team collecting a record number of samples.
If our experiments are successful in stimulating tissue growth and in controlling
contamination, it will move IVC one step closer to its application as a
collecting technique for botanical expeditions.<BR>
<BR>
The tissue cultures can be seen in the culture room of CREW's public exhibit.
Two plants from previous collection trips to Trinidad can also be seen in
the CREW greenhouse. Ultimately, these methods can be used on endangered
plants to prevent their extinction.<BR>
<BR>
On this trip we also visited the Emperor Valley Zoo where blood samples
for genetic sexing were collected from two juvenile blue and gold macaws
donated by the Zoo to the Macaw Breeding and Reintroduction Project. The
results indicated one male and one female. This pair can now be added to
the breeding program which already has four breeding pairs established at
the wildlife section. Their young would eventually be released into the
wild to replenish the island's extirpated macaw population.<BR>
<BR>
We also visited the flight cage built by Trinidad's Wildlife Section Forestry
Division with the help of Steve Malowski from our Aviculture Department.
This enclosure will temporarily house the birds before their release into
the wild. <BR>
<BR>
Thanks to all those who helped make this trip possible. Hopefully, our research
will prove successful in furthering conservation efforts.<BR>

<BR>
<B>By <I>Dr. Ken Cameron</I>, Zoo Veterinarian <BR>
<BR>
</B>Arriving in Tashinga Camp, a ranger station in Matusadona National Park,
we got an unexpected and heartwarming greeting as Chewore, a 22 month old
black rhino, came walking through the tall grass to meet us. This 500 pound
calf was rescued when her mother stopped producing milk. When I asked Peter,
the ranger responsible for protecting her from poachers, how he liked his
job he replied with a smile, &quot;I am her mother now.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Earlier in the day, as we crossed a damp riverbed, I was exhilarated to
find rhino spoor (footprints) in the sand. Now I hoped that this young calf
would someday leave such tracks of her own. For me, Chewore is a symbol
of hope for the future of black rhinos. This was one of countless encounters
with wild Africa that helped me to understand and appreciate the broader
context of wildlife conservation on my most recent trip to Zimbabwe. <BR>
<BR>

<BR>
In February I traveled to Zimbabwe to represent the Cincinnati Zoo as a
co-leader of a group organized by the International Wildlife Veterinary
Service (IWVS) - a non-profit organization of veterinarians which supports
wildlife projects worldwide. Each year IWVS sponsors veterinarians and other
animal professionals to attend a course on the capture of free-ranging African
wildlife held in Harare, the capitol of Zimbabwe. I attended the course
with IWVS in 1994 and helped lead this year's group of nine veterinarians
and biologists. <BR>
<BR>
The annual course, hosted by the Zimbabwe Veterinary Association's Wildlife
Group, teaches many skills necessary to safely capture free ranging wildlife
including darting equipment, immobilizing drugs and safe anesthesia. Such
skills are crucial when animals are to be captured or anesthetized for medical
procedures, disease monitoring, wildlife population studies or relocation
to safer areas. Successful completion of the course and exam are required
in Zimbabwe for anyone doing such work. <BR>
<BR>
Attending the course this year were veterinarians, veterinary students,
game ranchers, biologists and other researchers from Africa, Europe and
the U.S. I taught the wetlab (the &quot;hands-on&quot; portion of the course)
about some of the darting equipment and its uses. I shared with them the
differences in how we handle and care for animals in a zoo setting. Since
zoos are uncommon in that part of the world, it provided a unique opportunity
to share information about the role of the Cincinnati Zoo in wildlife conservation.
<BR>

</H5>
<BR>
For those in the group who work with wildlife in the U.S., this was an opportunity
not only to learn additional skills, but to discover the ways their individual
professions fit into the bigger picture of wildlife conservation. It was
a chance for everyone to learn about important conservation issues facing
southern Africa and, perhaps more importantly, a chance to exchange ideas,
experiences and expertise with people from different parts of the world.
<BR>
<BR>
After nearly a week of classroom activities, the group was ready to see
more of Zimbabwe. With Drs. Mike Kock and Mark Atkinson, veterinarians with
the Department of National Parks and Wildlife Management, we visited Zimbabwe's
largest national park, Hwange. Our hosts took us on an exciting journey
into remote, seldom-traveled areas of Hwange. This year's plentiful rains
ended the region's ten-year drought, bringing new life to the mopane, ironwood
and baobab trees, flowers and seemingly endless variety of grasses. The
animals thrived amidst the wealth of new growth; unusually large numbers
of zebra, giraffe, eland, sable antelope and elephants grazed and browsed
the verdant vegetation. <BR>
<BR>
Travel in Hwange was not without its hazards. On our way to Sinematella
Camp to meet with park rangers and rhino researchers both of our huge Land
Rovers got stuck in mud in a remote area of the park. As we walked through
the thick, ten-foot grass looking for solid ground, clapping our hands so
as to not surprise any buffalo (a potentially deadly mistake), I realized
how vulnerable we really were. After some hard work we made it back to the
road, then on to Sinematella. <BR>
<BR>
The country's black rhino population, decimated in recent years by poaching,
may be as much 300. In a meeting with black rhino researchers, I got to
see a new tool that will help them keep track of these magnificent animals;
a program that computer-enhances photographs of black rhino spoor, allowing
individuals to be identified by their footprints. <BR>
<BR>
Another endangered mammal found in this area is the African wild dog. Frequently
killed by automobiles and still hunted as pests, they are becoming a rarity
in most of their range. Seeing one of these would have &quot;made the trip&quot;
for me. As it turned out, we were able to report three sightings of these
&quot;painted wolves&quot; to researchers, including one pack not previously
studied. I was fascinated to see these beautiful, inquisitive and trusting
animals move within feet of us as they crossed our path. <BR>
<BR>
The last stop on our journey was at Lake Kariba, along the country's northern
border. Its blue water contrasts sharply with the red earth, green grasslands
and the dark hills of Matusadona beyond. This manmade lake, the second largest
in the world, has had some unexpected benefits for the wildlife. In addition
to acting as a barrier against poachers coming from neighboring Zambia,
the expansive grasslands and mopane woodlands along its shores support an
impressive variety of animals including elephants and large herds of impala
and cape buffalo. <BR>
<BR>

<BR>
<BR>
It is along these picturesque shores that elephants are being stricken by
an unusual disease. Called flaccid trunk paralysis, it affects mostly bulls
(adult males), slowly paralyzing the animal's trunk. Because elephants use
their trunks to eat, progression of the disease can lead to starvation.
Dr. Nancy Kock, a veterinary pathologist at the University of Zimbabwe,
has been investigating it for several years. We assisted Dr. Kock in her
investigation, immobilizing a bull elephant showing signs of the disease.
Part of his trunk dangled, nearly useless, and he was thin despite this
year's abundant food supply. After insuring that the animal would be safe
from dangers, he was darted with an anesthetic. Elephants also breathe through
their trunks. So, as the anesthetic took effect and the enormous animal
slumped to the ground, it was important to keep him from lying on his trunk.
<BR>
<BR>
Tissues from diseased animals can give important clues to the cause of the
disease, so blood was collected from an ear vein and biopsies were taken
of the animal's trunk. It is quite an experience to be so close to such
an amazing creature, particularly one of such staggering size. Listening
to the animal's breathing and feeling its heart beat filled me with awe.
Given an injection to reverse the anesthesia, the animal recovered quickly
and within minutes was rejoining his companions. Although the origin of
flaccid trunk paralysis has not yet been determined, researchers are now
concentrating on a plant toxin as the possible cause. <BR>
<BR>
This year's trip, once again, presented the opportunity to share ideas and
perspectives from around the world on the increasing concerns for some of
Africa's most endangered wildlife. In addition, it helped to affirm the
zoo's conservation efforts as a vital component of the global effort to
educate wildlife professionals and the public on current conservation issues.
I left Africa inspired by its incredible diversity of life and more acutely
aware of the need to continue developing a more comprehensive understanding
of wildlife conservation in both the scientific community and the general
public. <BR>

<P><B>by <I>Cathryn Hilker</I>, Director of Cat Ambassador Program</B></P>

<P></P>

<P>We had been walking for over two hours and the house seemed as far away
as it had the moment my husband Carl buried our rental car in the sand.
I could tell we were headed in the right direction because of the banner
that was flying high on its pole beside the distant house. My right leg
felt paralyzed from trudging through the deep sand and Carl's limp, caused
by a perpetually swollen ankle, was noticeably more pronounced. I noted,
rather smugly, he was wearing moccasins which made walking even harder.
I figured he deserved what he got.</P>

<P>I had warned him not to try and cross &quot;that&quot; part of the large
open field. The sand trap had claimed many victims who did not take African
deserts seriously. But the sight of several hundred eland, kudu and gemsbok
was too much for Carl's Ohio instincts and, as we tried to &quot;head them
off at the pass,&quot; we paid the ultimate price. Our Mazda Midge ground
to a solid halt, buried in sand up to what only those over 50 would call
the &quot;running board.&quot; In simpler terms, we were stuck. We watched
from our car as all the animals disappeared in the bush surrounding the
open field.</P>

<H5 ALIGN=CENTER>Laurie Marker-Kraus and Cathryn Hilker with a cheetah cub.</H5>

<P></P>

<P>As we continued our hike back to the house, I reflected on the circumstances
that had brought my husband and me to a remote farm in the desert country
of Namibia, Southwest Africa. CHEETAH!</P>

<P>My association with these cats began 15 years ago when Angel, a cheetah,
came to live with our family. Until her death three years ago, Angel and
I were about as inseperable as one can be with a wild animal. Giving me
the gift of acceptance and allowing me into her private world, Angel changed
my life. At her death, the Cincinnati Zoo established the Angel Fund. As
part of my debt to her, Carl and I - along with several other
&quot;cheetah believers&quot; - purchased a farm that was to become the
Center for Cheetah Conservation.</P>

<P>The cheetah is an elusive cat that a visitor seldom sees in Namibia,
although that country is probably the cheetah's last chance for large scale
survival. The largest population of free ranging cheetahs in Africa is in
Namibia.</P>

<P>Laurie Marker-Kraus, a young American, was already in Africa and had
done extensive field work on the cat and the problems the animal faced.
Like all predators, the cheetah needs a prey base. The Namibian cattle farmers
view the cheetah the same way the U.S.'s western settlers viewed the wolf
and cougar - the best predator is a dead predator.</P>

<P>Laurie is in Namibia to tell the cheetah's story. The story is simple.
Give the cheetah a healthy prey base and the cattle, sheep and goats are
safe. Take away the prey base and the cheetah, to survive, becomes a stock
killer. Before Laurie and her story arrived, cheetahs were being trapped
and killed at the rate of over 100 a year. This had already depleted the
cheetah population from an estimated 6,000 in Namibia in 1970 to less than
2,500 today. It does not take a mathmetician to see that the cheetah's time
is running out.</P>

<P>Laurie and a steady stream of volunteers take this story into schools,
farm meetings, and international conferences. The purchase of an 18,000-acre
farm, Elandsvreugde (Afrikaans for &quot;Eland's Joy&quot;), provides Laurie
and her organization (the Cheetah Conservation Fund) with a permanent base
of operations.</P>

<H3></H3>

<H3></H3>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>&quot;The story is simple. Give the cheetah a healthy prey
base and the cattle, sheep and goats are safe. Take away the prey base and
the cheetah, to survive, becomes a stock killer.&quot;<BR>
</H3>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER></H3>

<P>The farm has two houses, a &quot;khuta&quot; (meeting place) used as
kitchen and eating area, and four rondavels for guests. There are four large
cheetah pens which are used to house captured cheetahs until a suitable
release site can be found. After Laurie talks to a farmer, many cheetahs
are simply released from the farmer's capture cage back onto the same farm.
Releases like this are a certain sign of success.</P>

<P>Days on Eland's Joy are a mixture of emotion. When cheetahs come in after
being held in captive cages for days before Laurie is called to help, the
animal is often so severely stressed it dies despite Laurie's best efforts.
These are the bad days. Good days happen more frequently now when a farmer
- who previously killed the cat - calls Laurie just to tell her
that one of her collared cheetah was seen at a water hole and all is well.</P>

<P>Laurie's efforts to save the cheetah are now internationally recognized
and she counts our Zoo and many Cincinnatians among her supporters. As Ed
Maruska, Cincinnati Zoo Executive Director, said to Laurie on one of her
visits here, &quot;I consider you a member of my staff. You simply do your
work in the field.&quot;</P>

<P>This is good news for Laurie and the cheetah. With a lot of hard work
and a little good luck, that slender, elegant hunter will survive for future
generations to appreciate.</P>

<P></P>

<P><HR></P>

<H3>Cheetah (<I>Acinonyx jubatus)</I></H3>

<P>The fastest animal on land, the cheetah can sprint up to 60 miles per
hour. A slender build and highly flexible spine enable the cheetah to make
astonishingly long and rapid strides; and, unlike other cats, the cheetah's
claws when retracted are not covered by a sheath but are left exposed to
provide additional traction during rapid acceleration. But with great sprinting
prowess comes limited endurance and this means that the cheetah can only
hunt effectively in open country where there is enough natural cover for
stalking.</P>

<P>While cheetah numbers have diminished in great part because of the demand
for their fur, a more substantial threat to the cheetah's survival is the
loss of habitat which deprives it of suitable prey, reduces its hunting
success, causes more cubs to die of starvation and fall victim to predators,
increases the proportion of kills stolen by other large carnivores, and
causes conflict with man through increased attacks on domestic livestock.
Captive breeding, although successful, is not a suitable alternative to
preserving the natural habitat. <B><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT></B></P>

<P>Guests at Zoofari 1996 can truly explore a world of wonder during &quot;Twilight
in the Treetops,&quot; the Zoo's spectacular black tie fundraising gala
on Friday, September 20 at the Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Garden. Set
amid a twinkling rain forest canopy, guests will experience the same delicate
environment they are funding to protect.</P>

<P>Sponsored by the Miller-Valentine Group and Provident Bank, &quot;Twilight
in the Treetops&quot; is the theme for Zoofari 1996 named in honor of the
projects it benefits - a new &quot;Vanishing Giants&quot; exhibit and
the Cheetah Conservation Fund in Namibia, West Africa. The event is chaired
by Darlene and Jeff Anderson and Nydia and Richard Tranter.</P>

<P>The festivities begin at 7 p.m. with the sights and sounds of the rain
forest presented by Platinum Video and a dream-like ambiance complete with
thousands of white lights, a forest of towering palms, and live, exotic
botanical displays. </P>

<P>Throughout the evening, guests can dine on extraordinary culinary offerings
from 40 of Cincinnati's finest restaurants -&nbsp;all brought together
by the discriminating tastes of Zoofari's restaurant committee chaired by
Felicia and Devinder Mangat and Sheila and Nick Sanders working in conjunction
with Shari Einsel and Jimmy Gherardi.</P>

<P>At 9 p.m., guests can dance to the sounds of the popular Texas showband
Dash Riprock and The Dragons who will perform favorite tunes from the 1950s
to the 90s. Entertainment is underwritten by Richard Tranter, Esq./Thompson
Hine and Flory P.L.L., Mr. and Mrs. Jeffrey R. Anderson, and University
of Cincinnati College of Medicine and Medical Center. </P>

<P>During the evening, guests can meet Gilbert M. Grosvenor, past president
and current chairman of the National Geographic Society, who will be on
hand to discuss the society's message of geography education. &quot;Mr.
Grosvenor speaks to all of us on why we need to understand geography and
man's impact on his environment,&quot; said Darlene Anderson, Zoofari chairperson.
</P>

<P>The National Geographic Society's purpose is to diffuse and increase
the knowledge of geography - which they have done successfully for more
than 106 years through print and more than 30 years through high quality
feature films. &quot;This is not unlike the Cincinnati Zoo which, for over
121 years, has promoted the knowledge of life and the diversity of our world
- not only in the animal world, but how man interacts with his
surroundings,&quot;
Anderson adds.</P>

<P>On Saturday morning, Grosvenor will join the Zoo's Education Department
in kicking off an educational initiative with the Ohio Geographic Alliance's
Teacher Workshop. The workshop, &quot;Exploring a World of Habitats,&quot;
is also the theme for National Geographic's Geography Week in November,
1996.</P>

<P>Over the past 13 years, Zoofari has raised $1.7 million for major capital
projects such as Gorilla World, Jungle Trails, CREW, and Wings of the World:
A Celebration of Flight. Zoofari 1996 will benefit two important conservation
projects.</P>

<P>The new elephant exhibit, to be called the &quot;Schott-Unnewehr Vanishing
Giants Exhibit,&quot; involves a complete renovation of the Zoo's existing
Elephant House - a Cincinnati landmark listed on the National Register
of Historic Places. The new exhibit will include state-of-the art holding
facilities, greatly enlarged display and holding yards, and a work room
for researchers.(<A HREF="director.shtml">see directors's article</A>)</P>

<P>Because of increasing threats to wild populations, the American Zoo and
Aquarium Association (AZA) has developed a Species Survival Plan for these
magnificent creatures. With Zoofari raising funds for this important project,
the Zoo can continue to expand its commitment to Asian Elephant Conservation.
</P>

<P>Felines are also an important part of Zoo conservation. By contributing
to The Cheetah Conservation Fund (CCF), the Zoo supports an 18,000-acre
farm in Namibia, Southwest Africa which serves as an International Cheetah
Research and Education Center. The farm, known in Namibia as &quot;Elandsvreugde&quot;
(&quot;Eland's Joy&quot;), is run by Laurie Marker-Kraus. Envisioned as
both a research facility and a public education center, the goal is for
the farm to be self-supporting. </P>

<P>Plans also include building holding facilities for cheetahs captured
by local farmers, continued relocation of captured cheetahs, as well as
expansion of the CCF's efforts to track cheetahs through the use of radio
collars in order to develop a &quot;safe passage area&quot; for cheetahs
crossing local farms and into the neighboring country of Botswana. Long-range
plans also include the development of ecotourism.</P>

<P>In addition to raising funds for Zoo projects, the focus of &quot;Twilight
in the Treetops&quot; is also to foster goodwill within the greater Cincinnati
community and to thank the Zoo's major donors. Cost for the black tie event
is $150 per person. For further information, please call Zoo Development
at (513) 559-7740.</P>

<P>Special thanks goes to the more than 40 committee chairs for their efforts
in bringing the gala together.</P>

<P><B>By<I> Jennifer Kress</I>, Media Specialist</B></P>

<P></P>

<P>The <A HREF="http://www.panda.org/">World Wildlife Fund (WWF)</A> has
given the Zoo a $6,100 Innovation Grant to develop and conduct training
workshops for environmental educators.</P>

<P><IMG SRC="wwflogo.gif" WIDTH="125" HEIGHT="166" ALIGN="LEFT" NATURALSIZEFLAG=
"3">The &quot;train the trainers&quot; workshops are part of a larger initiative
called Windows on the Wild, a national environmental education program of
WWF. These workshops, which are designed for middle-school educators, will
give participants an opportunity to provide input into the new Windows on
the Wild curriculum, which is currently being piloted in school systems
across the country.</P>

<P>The educators the Zoo trains will use Windows and other high quality
education materials to enhance their environmental education efforts.</P>

<P>WWF, in partnership with the American Zoo and Aquarium Association, will
sponsor eight additional train-the trainers workshops this summer in the
United States and Canada.</P>

<P>&quot;Modern zoos really are around to provide a 'window on the wild,'&quot;
said Thane Maynard, Cincinnati Zoo director of Education. </P>

<P>The Cincinnati Zoo has worked on conservation programs with World Wildlife
Fund since 1983.</P>

<P>The grant will enable the Zoo to develop and hold a two-day &quot;Biodiversity
Institute&quot; designed to introduce middle-school teachers and administrators
and nonformal educators to biodiversity issues. Bringing science teachers
together with teachers from complementary disciplines, the program will
facilitate the integration of environmental education across the curriculum.
The Zoo will involve educators in hands-on activities that will broaden
their understanding of the environment and inspire them to take positive
environmental actions. Participants in the Biodiversity Institute will provide
workshops for other educators at their schools or facilities.</P>

<P>Biodiversity is the incredible variety of life on Earth. Windows on the
Wild uses biodiversity as an organizing theme to help educators, students
and the public understand what biodiversity is, why it is important, what
the status is, and what people are doing to help protect biodiversity worldwide.</P>

<P>Funding from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and from Eastman
Kodak Company makes Windows possible.</P>

<TR></TABLE>


Put on your walking shoes and get set for a walk in the park with the 1996 edition of the Zoo's Celebrity Winter Walks.  Four days in March, a special celebrity will lead visitors on a unique tour of the Zoo. <P>
	Each walk gives visitors a chance to see the Zoo from a new perspective as Zoo staff members guide the public and each weekend's guest on a specialized tour customized for each celebrity's particular interest.  Each walk is different and gives an in-depth look at the highlighted areas.<P>
	The hour-long tours all begin in the Special Events Building where a reception kicks off the festivities.  Visitors can enjoy refreshments and meet each celebrity before proceeding on the tours.  All walks are included in the cost of regular Zoo admission.<P>
	March to a new rhythm with the Cincinnati Symphony's new assistant conductor John Morris Russell.  On Saturday, March 9 at 1 p.m., Russell will join Zoo Assistant Director of Education Dave Jenike on an ecletic tour highlighting "animal communication."  Just watch where his baton will take you.
	Experience a different "duck tail" or two when you join Grease cast members Sally Struthers and Adrian Zmed on Wednesday, March 20 at 1 p.m.  Led by Zoo Director of Education Thane Maynard, their tour will focus on animal courtship.  The Fifth Third Bank Broadway Series presentation of  Grease appears at the Aronoff Center March 19-24.  Call (513) 241-7469 for performance times and ticket information.<P>
	Trekkies have something to cheer about!  No, it's not a new movie ... it is Professor Lawrence M.  Krauss, author of The Physics of STAR TREK.  On March 23 at 11 a.m., Professor Krauss (an internationally known physicist) joins Children's Zoo Curator Doug Feist on a tour in search of "hi-tech animals."  Warp-Factor six, Mr. Sulu!  Krauss is in town for the <b>STAR TREK</b>: Federation Scienceª exhibit on display until April 28 at the Cincinnati Museum Center.  Krauss will also hold a lecture and booksigning at the Museum Center at 2 p.m. on March 23.  Call (513) 287-7010 for information.<P>
     Get set for Saturday, March 30 when Cincinnati Bengals offensive lineman <b>Bruce Kozerski</b> makes his way through our jungle for the final winter walk at 1 p.m.  Kozerski joins the Zoo's General Curator Mike Dulaney as they go in search of "predatory animals."<P>

<I>By <B>Jeff Murphy</b>, Education Dept. Intern</i><P>
"It is an honor when a wild animal accepts me in its proximity." 
Those few words vividly depict the nature of Frans Lanting's work Ð one 
in which his innovative wildlife photography is worth much more than a 
mere thousand words.<P>
	As one of today's foremost wildlife photographers, Frans Lanting, 
shares his photographs, anecdotes and recollections for the Zoo's 1996 
Barrows Conservation Lecture Series at 7:30 p.m. on April 18 at Rockdale 
Temple, 8501 Ridge Road.<P>
	Born in the Netherlands, Lanting became a professional photographer in 
1980.  Since then, he has travelled the world to photograph wildlife in 
their natural environment.  Lanting's pictorial portrayal of the 
wildlife of Madagascar was featured in National Geographic as the 
magazine's longest ever wildlife article.  In 1991, he was given the 
esteemed title of BBC Wildlife Photographer of the Year by Sir David 
Attenborough.  <P>
	His photographic portrayal of the Okavango Delta, published in 1993 in 
his book Okavango: Africa's Last Eden, is equally as thrilling.  The 
Okavango Delta stretches 8,500 square miles across the Kalahari desert 
and is the largest inland delta in the world.  A final refuge for many 
otherwise-endangered species, the Okavango is home to cheetahs, lions, 
zebras, and hippos, as well as Africa's last, great herds of elephants.  <P>
	This lecture promises to integrate Lanting's diverse ecological 
knowledge and charisma for conservation with his delightfully eccentric, 
yet always powerful photographic style.  His arresting images of 
Madagascar's flora and fauna prompted an influx of conservation efforts 
to the island, and his work on the Okavango is already beginning to 
spark the interest of many Ð perhaps even yours as well!<P>
	Mr. Lanting's other books of stunning wildlife photographs include 
Feathers, Islands of the West, Madagascar: A World Out of Time, and 
Forgotten Edens.  For tickets please use this order form.<P>

<I>By <B>Melissa Kurzhals</B>, Education Intern<BR>

</I> As you wind down misty paths, budding plants greet the new season and animals vocalize salutations. Scents of wet rich earth, new grass, young jonquils, and tulips saturate your starved winter olfactory nerves. A crescendo of chattering, hooting, and chirping intermingles and awakens somnolent eardrums. It is Earth Weekend at the Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Garden. 

Earth Weekend is the ideal way to prime yourself for a greater commitment to Mother Earth. There are hundreds of ways in which you can take action. Songbirds returning from the tropics need a place to have a family - put up birdhouses and plant trees. Add butterfly friendly flowers to your garden. Visit a local park. Gather up litter. Recycle everything you can. Go to the Zoo to enjoy and learn about wildlife. Volunteer your time on an Earth project. Read a book to a child about the rain forest. 

Every person can make a positive change to improve the environment. As an individual, you make decisions daily; what to buy, how to locomote, what to wear. Choices accumulate. Keep in mind your impact on the Earth, choose a path for yourself and you will be setting an example that can be followed by others. Spring is the perfect time to renew your spirit and mind, and start down a new path to benefit all creatures great and small. 

<I>Our thanks to Step Lightly and the Hamilton County Soil & Water Conservation District for their participation.</I>

<H1>Gary Chapman Headlines WAKW Fellowship Days</H1>
</TD></TR></TABLE><BR>
<BR>
At one time or another, everyone needs a little shelter. From the rain.
From the cold. From a world where things don't always make sense. For singer/songwriter
Gary Chapman, &quot;Shelter&quot; is not just the name of his latest album,
it's a deep sense of love and protection, a peace that holds us ... &quot;like
when I'm holding my daughter Sarah ... that's shelter,&quot; Gary says.<BR>

Cheetahs may be able to outrun olympic sprinters, but they cannot outrun
extinction without some help. You can help save the cheetah by joining in
the Cheetah Run, September 1 at the Zoo.<BR>
The Cheetah Run events begin at 8 a.m. with a run or a jog around the 2.5
mile course through the Zoo's lush and beautiful grounds. Next, the children
have their turn during a &quot;Fun Run&quot; around our Swan Lake. An awards
ceremony in the Zoo Amphitheater follows the Fun Run. The top 15 percent
in each of the 15 Cheetah Run age categories receive awards and each &quot;Fun
Runner&quot; receives a colorful ribbon. <BR>
<BR>
To pre-register for the run, fill out the following form and send it with
your $8 fee to the address listed. Entries must be postmarked by Saturday,
August 26. Registration on the day of the race is $10. This year's t-shirt
is only $8 when you pre-register and $10 on race day. Runners should arrive
before 7:15 a.m. to allow ample time to park and prepare for the race. Enter
the Employee Entrance on Erkenbrecher Avenue and park in the Peacock Parking
lot at the base of the hill by the Whiting Grove Picnic area.<BR>
<BR>
For more information about the Cheetah Run, please contact race coordinator,

Building Teams <BR>
For Conservation</CENTER>
</H2>
<BR>
<B>By <I>Julie Childers</I>, Education Intern</B><BR>
<BR>
Over the past decade, the Cincinnati Zoo has teamed with many conservation
organizations including Ohio Division of Wildlife, Conservation International,
World Wildlife Fund, and the Nature Conservancy. These team efforts have
allowed each organization to fill their own niche while combining to promote
conservation both globally and locally. On August 24-25, the Zoo will host
the 10th Annual Wildlife Weekend during which various organizations will
show you how to join the conservation team.<BR>
<BR>
You can learn how to become actively involved in conserving wildlife through
this fun weekend filled with interactive booths, animal demonstrations,
and special entertainment.<BR>
<BR>
<B>INTERACTIVE BOOTHS</B><BR>
Wildlife Weekend participants will include environmental organizations,
governmental agencies and corporations including: Sierra Club, Raptor, Cincinnati
Herpetological Society, Metropolitan Sewer District, Ohio Division of Wildlife,
Hamilton County Soil and Water Conservation District, Cincinnati Parks,
and Cinergy.<BR>
<BR>
<B>ENTERTAINMENT</B><BR>
On Saturday at 1 and 3 p.m., the free-spirited Kratt Brothers present a
live animal show utilizing their off-the-wall humor at the Zoo Amphitheater.
A number of Zoo Ambassadors will take the stage along with the Kratts. On
Sunday, folk singer and storyteller Greg Jowaisis plays his banjo, hammer
dulcimer, auto harp and guitar while passing on a tale or two throughout
the Zoo grounds. On both days, David Arcadian and Company present a unique
wildlife message with a variety show of puppetry, magic and audience participation
at the Kahn's Children's Theater (within the Children's Zoo) at 12, 1, 2
and 3 p.m. Children can also get their face painted and enjoy interactive
games at various booths.<BR>
<BR>
<B><BR>
ANIMAL DEMONSTRATIONS</B><BR>
Our animal demonstrations showcase the beauty, diversity and importance
of wildlife. &quot;Cats, Cats, Cats&quot; is a face-to-face experience with
rare and exotic cats which includes a tiger, ocelot, mountain lion, serval
and cheetah displaying their natural behaviors at noon and 2 p.m. both days
at the Zoo Amphitheater. &quot;Wings of Wonder&quot; takes flight on Sunday
at 1 and 3 p.m. in the Zoo Amphitheater as more than 20 different species
of birds show off their free-flying abilities and down-to-earth mobility.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Dr. Birut&eacute; Galdikas </H3>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>A Voice for Orangutans and Forests </H3>

<P></P>

<P>Known as Louis Leakey's &quot;third angel,&quot; Birut&eacute; Galdikas
has studied the orangutans of Borneo for more than twenty years. Her autobiography
&quot;Reflections of Eden&quot; was released last year. </P>

<P>Dr. Galdikas' interest in apes began at an early age. As a child she
loved to visit zoos and watch the primates interact. Later in college, Dr.
Galdikas went to a lecture given by Dr. Louis Leakey. She approached him
about doing an orangutan study project. Her desire and committment to do
a long term study became readily apparent to Leakey.</P>

<P>In 1971, Birut&eacute; Galdikas and her husband Rod Brindamour moved
to Borneo. Living in a primitive camp, she became surrogate mother to a
&quot;family&quot; of ex-captive orangutans and began to learn their ways.
Her hope was to collect enough data on orangutan life so that the forces
shaping their lives in the wild could be better understood.</P>

<P>Seven years into Dr. Galdikas' study of orangutans, over 12,000 hours
of orangutan observation had been logged. Camp Leakey grew from a single
logger's hut to eight buildings where other researchers, who had come to
add their expertise to the orangutan study, could stay.</P>

<P>Patterns of orangutan behavior emerged. Adult females were seen mingling
with both males and females of all age groups, while adolescents mingled
with each other and with adult females. Adult males, however, were much
less social than females or adolescent orangutans. While they accepted females
of all ages, adult male orangutans avoided other males, except to fight
one another in the presence of a female ready to mate. This is quite different
behavior from what is seen in other great apes.</P>

<P>Dr. Galdikas discovered that early perceptions of orangutans being solitary
animals were wrong. They do have contact with each other, only less often
and in a more limited way than other primates. Yet, it is only by keeping
to themselves that these large animals can find enough fruit to survive.
However, Dr. Galdikas has observed mother and daughter orangutans embracing
after going several years without any contact.</P>

<P><IMG SRC="barrows.gif" WIDTH="182" HEIGHT="270" ALIGN="LEFT"
NATURALSIZEFLAG=
"3">Many changes in Borneo have occurred since Birute began her studies
in 1971. While orangutans are being poached from the wild, the wild itself
is disappearing. Indonesian rain forests are being destroyed by the logging
industry at an uncontrolled rate. Logging roads cut deep into the forest
make it easy for poachers to find the orangutans. Human population has escalated
dramatically on the island of Borneo requiring more land to be developed.
Today, only 10-20,000 orangutans remain in the wild - down from the
hundreds of thousands in the past.</P>

<P>With the work of many dedicated conservationists like Dr. Galdikas, promising
accomplishments have been made. They include the establishment of national
parks such as Tanjung Puting in Borneo and Gunung Leuser in northern Sumatra.
Strict laws to protect the forests in Indonesia and Malaysia are now in
effect, and conservationists are making sure their voices are heard. Dr.
Birut&eacute; Galdikas continues to be a voice for the forest and orangutans.</P>

<P>Dr. Birut&eacute; Galdikas will speak September 26 at 7:30 p.m. at the
Rockdale Temple. She will receive the Zoo's 1996 Wildlife Conservation Award
and will be available for a book signing after the lecture. Please use the
order form on page 11 to receive lecture tickets.</P>

<H1>Young Friends Bird Seed Sale</H1></TD></TR></TABLE><!--/NOEDIT--></P>

<P>The Zoo will be holding its annual bird seed sale in October, sponsored
by the Young Friends of the Zoo (YFOZ). By purchasing your winter stock
from us, you will not only enjoy feeding our feathered friends this winter,
but also support the educational efforts of the Zoo.</P>

<P>Many birds remain in our area for the winter and really can use a well-stocked
feeder to get through these tough months. In order to help you help them,
we have four seed types available at very competitive prices. The Wild Bird
Mix is comprised of 40% cracked corn, 20% milo, 20% millet, 10% wheat, and
10% sunflower. This mix attracts mourning doves, many species of sparrows,
and finches. If you really want a traffic jam at your feeder, order our
Premium Mix, made up of 30% milo, 35%, millet, 25 % wheat and 10% sunflower.
Most of our wintering birds, including grosbeaks, cardinals and titmice
find this mix irresistible.</P>

<P>Many of the plastic tube type feeders are designed to hold a special
type of feed, and allow you to attract a more limited clientele of birds.
For this type of feeder we have sunflower seed and thistle seed for attracting
finches and cardinals in abundance.</P>

<P>You may order your seed by using the form on this page. All orders must
be received by October 5. The seed can be picked up on Saturday, October
19 from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. in the Zoo parking lot (enter through the employee
entrance on Erkenbrecker Ave). You will receive a bird seed order confirmation
card which you must present to the guard at the employee entrance.</P>

<P><I>The Young Friends of the Zoo is a volunteer group of adults who share
the Zoo as a common interest. YFOZ's goals are: to educate its members about
the Cincinnati Zoo and the conservation and preservation of the earth's
flora and fauna, to raise money for various Zoo wildlife programs, and to
create a fun and unusual social network for its members. Started in 1986,
YFOZ has raised well over $500,000 through its fund raising efforts. These
efforts have contributed revenue to various Zoo projects including donations
to CREW, the renovation of the Komodo Dragon exhibit, landscaping in Jungle
Trails, the renovation of the Wings of the World exhibit and, this year,
a donation to the renovation of the Elephant House.</I><BR>

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Wildlife Discovery Days </H2>

<P></P>

<P>Teachers and their students (kindergarten through 6th grade) are needed
to help us locate Harriet Habitat and her evil associates - &nbsp;Slash
and Burn the forest destroyers. You and your students will have to follow
the clues and help us round up these environmental disasters before they
can strike. They are threatening to cut down all the trees in the remodeled
Eagle Eyrie where visitors can walk right into the exhibit with these magnificent
birds.</P>

<P>We have been advised that Harriet and her henchmen will be trying to
sneak into the Zoo during Wildlife Discovery Days, <B>September 12, 13,
16, 17, and 18, 1996</B>. </P>

<P>Of course, these five days are also filled with live programs including
&quot;<B>Wings of Wonder</B>,&quot; &quot;<B>Cats, Cats, Cats</B>&quot;
&quot;<B>Elephants and Man</B>,&quot; <B>Reptiles are Special Too, Rumpke
Recycling, Native American Storytelling, Frisch's Discovery Center</B>,
and much more. Remember, the whole Zoo is waiting for your students to explore
and our volunteer interpreters will share their knowledge and love of plants
and animals with your students.</P>

<P></P>

<P>Call the Zoo's School Services at (513) 559-7737 or (513) 559-7760 to
register your classes for one of the five days. Admission is <B>$3 per student</B>;
school staff, buses, and drivers are free; one volunteer chaperon for each
10 students is free; all others are $3 each; private vehicle parking is
$4.50 each.</P>

<P></P>

<P><I>For the second year, Mercantile Stores Co., Inc. and McAlpin's are
sponsoring this week of programs. We thank them for their continued support!</I><BR>

<TD WIDTH=432 ALIGN=CENTER VALIGN=CENTER><H2>Zoo's Outreach Program Reaches Out</H2></TD></TR></TABLE>


<i>by <b>Pat Brooke</b>, Director of Volunteer Services</i><p>


The first time volunteers took the Zoo into the 
classrooms was in 1977.  Since then, the program 
has experienced tremendous growth, reaching more 
than 62,000 students last year.  The Outreach 
Program is so popular with preschoolers and high 
school students that today there are not enough 
volunteers and animals to fill all of the requests 
for programs.<P>



Connie Smiley was a volunteer in the Outreach Program 
before becoming a staff member.   She gets as much 
out of this program as she gives, which is a lot.  
&quot;I love kids and I love animals.  Putting them 
together is the best of both worlds,&quot; Smiley says. 
 &quot;The most satisfying thing about the Outreach 
Program is watching the children's attitudes change 
and watching their awareness increase.  Even the most 
unruly child seems awed by the animals and is ready 
to listen to the education  message we give.&quot;<P>

     Being an Outreach volunteer is also a good way 
to overcome shyness as Nancy Heckel can attest.  After 
Nancy completed the Animal Handling Classes taught 
by staff member Jan Dietrich, someone suggested she 
work in the Outreach Program.  She was terrified at 
the thought.  This was uncharted territory for her 
but she did not say &quot;No.&quot;   Instead, she 
was trained and mentored then, three months later, 
she presented her first solo program at Pleasant Hill 
Elementary.  She's been hooked ever since.  <P>

     &quot;It is a privilege to help educate kids,&quot; 
Heckel said.  &quot;Some children never have a chance 
to come to the Zoo and they get very little attention 
at home.  This enrichment means a lot to them and it 
has been very good for me.&quot;<P>

     Teaching people about Ohio's native animals is 
an enriching mission for Outreach volunteer Harold 
Burke.  He became a volunteer because he was curious 
and wanted to learn.  Now when he makes his presentations, 
he raises the awareness of area residents about their 
backyard animal  neighbors and he wants to make people 
care. <P>
     &quot;There are many animals and much habitat right 
here in the tri-state that needs help,&quot; Burke 
says.  &quot;It is easier for people to take action 
here at home than in other parts of the world.  Think 
globally, act locally.&quot;<P>

     Sue Guttag,  another veteran volunteer, likes the 
Outreach Program because &quot;when a child touches 
an animal, a connection is made; then they are more 
likely to care about all animals.&quot;<P>

     Dean Froelich has been an Outreach volunteer for 
eight years.  Dean worked with special education children 
before becoming a Zoo volunteer; now he brings the 
world of animals to special education students through 
Outreach.  <P>

     &quot;It's just plain fun.  I am constantly learning 
and, in the process, I help others to learn too,&quot; 
Froelich said.  &quot;Being a Zoo volunteer is one 
of the neatest things I've ever done.&quot;<P>

     Today the Outreach Program has twenty-five volunteers 
and three paid staff members who develop the programs, 
work with the teachers on the curriculum and give the 
presentations.  The waiting list to receive one of 
these programs is long.  However, additional Outreach 
volunteers can shorten the wait.  If you have completed 
one season of interpretive work at the Zoo and want 
to join the ranks of the Outreach volunteers, please 
contact Jan Dietrich at (513) 559-7760 to sign up for 
the next Animal Handling class.  Help us reach out 
and make a difference.<P>

<H3>What’s the Problem?</H3>
<P>Did you know that the way we live has an impact on animals and plants locally and around the world?  What you eat, the things you but at the store, and the way you get to school - all of these things affect the natural world in some way.</P>
<P>Where an how we get energy and resources is a major part of the problem.  Everything we buy takes energy and resources to produce.  Where do these resources come from?  The natural world!  Take a look around you and see if you can find something made f
rom the products listed on this page.  Notice what part of nature the products are made from!
<P>The problem is that we treat these resources as if there will be plenty of them forever.  In reality, we’re using too many too fast!  Many of these resources are non-renewable.  Once they’re gone, they are gone forever.  It won’t be long before we have
 used up all of our resources.</P>
<P>Whenever we remove a resource faster than nature can replace it, we create a problem that will affect all of us in the future!  Can you think of anything wrong with using too many resources?  Habitat loss, air and water pollution, and garbage dumps are
 all major problems that this causes!</P>
<UL>
<LI>glass - sandstone
<LI>paper - trees
<LI>electricity - dead plants (oil & coal)
<LI>wood - trees
<LI>metals - rocks
<LI>plastics - oil
</UL>
<BR>
<H3>What is a Sustainable Earth?</H3>
<P>A sustainable way of living is one in which people get what they need without harming others, wildlife, or wild places today or in the future.  For example, cutting trees for paper is only sustainable if enough trees are left or replanted to support th
e diversity of life within the forest.</P>
<P>Is this a new idea?  No!  Indigenous people around the world have lived here in harmony for thousands of years.  They take no more than nature can naturally replace.  This preserves the natural world for future generations.</P>
<P>It wasn’t until the last 200 years that modern society began to threaten the balance of nature.  As population sizes grow, cities expand, industry increases and people begin consuming more natural resources.  This endangers plants, animals and their ho
mes.</P>
<P>To build a sustainable earth, we need to change our lifestyles and our attitudes.  This is hard to do!  Where do we begin?  Starting to see the connection between ourselves and nature is the first step in the direction of building a sustainable earth. 
 Identifying the problems and following the 4 R’s - Reduce, Reuse, Recycle, Respect - is a great way to help out!</P>


<a name=reduce>
<H1>Reduce</H1>
<H4>Did you know that plants are great water conservers?</H4>
<P>Most plants, especially tropical ones, have a waxy coating on all their leaves that helps prevent valuable water within the plant from seeping out into the air.</P>
<P>If the problem is that we use too many of nature’s resources, what is the easiest way to help out?  Use less!  Americans buy more stuff than any other people in the world!  Is this because we need or want more?  Reducing means producing less waste and 
using less energy in our daily lives!</P>

<P><STRONG>Reduce Electricity at Home:</STRONG>  Turn out the lights, limit the use of air conditioners and heat.</P>
<P><STRONG>Water Watch:</STRONG>  Look for leaks in pipes, faucets, and toilet bowls, take shorter showers and turn off the water while brushing your teeth.</P>
<P><STRONG>Pricy Packaging:</STRONG>  Look at how the things you buy are packaged and remember most of the packaging ends up in a landfill.</P>
<P><STRONG>Compost It:</STRONG>  Recycle your kitchen and garden scraps into fertilizer.</P>
<P><STRONG>Car Crunch:</STRONG>  Ride a bike instead of driving.</P>

<a name=recycle>
<H1>Recycle</H1>
<P>People produce ENORMOUS amounts of trash and most of it ends up in a landfill.  Landfills take up space, and creating that space usually requires destroying habitats.  Recycling is one way to keep garbage out of a landfill.  Instead of wasting the ener
gy that went into making a product like an aluminum can, we can recycle materials and reuse them to make more aluminum cans.  Do animals recycle paper, cans glass, and plastic like we do?  Of course not!  But insects and decomposers in the natural world a
re always recycling dead plants and animals into soil.</P>

<a name=reuse>
<H1>Reuse</H1>
<P>Animals in nature don’t use too many resources so they don’t have to reuse... But they still do!  Nests, burrows, waste products, and food are all reused in the natural world.</P>
<P>If we reuse the things we have, we buy fewer products.  This conserves energy, reduces waste, and saves money.</P>
<P><STRONG>Don’t bag it:</STRONG>  Bring your own shopping bags to the grocery store instead of using paper or plastic.</P>
<P><STRONG>Buy Recycled:</STRONG>  Do you buy things made from recycled products?  Look for packaging that says, Made from Recycled Products.</P>
<P><STRONG>Reusable containers:</STRONG>  Buy products in returnable or refillable containers.  Instead of using small plastic bags for food, use reusable containers.</P>
<P><STRONG>Bio-Bottles:</STRONG>  Plastic 2-liter bottles and milk cartons can be made into many things - bird feeders, plant pots, small aquariums and more.</P>
<P><STRONG>Old Stuff:</STRONG>  What do you do with your old toys, clothes, and things you just don’t want anymore?  Instead of tossing them out, have a garage sale or give them away.</P>

<a name=respect>
<H1>Respect</H1>
<P>Protecting and preserving the natural world begins with you!  You can help make a tremendous difference!  Take the time to appreciate nature by watching birds and other local wildlife around your house, visiting parks, going to zoos, or joining a local
 nature center or club.  As you learn more about the natural world, you will come to respect nature’s amazing creatures.</P>
<P>You can show your respect by remembering the 3 R’s:  reduce, reuse, recycle.  The next time you drive in a car, buy something, or turn on the lights, remember that you are affecting the world in which we live!  If  you reduce the amount of stuff you us
e and energy you waste, you will be helping nature in a BIG WAY.</P>
<CENTER><H3>Here are Three Activities You Can Do to Learn<BR>about a Sustainable Earth!</H3></CENTER>
<STRONG><H4>1.  Bottle Mania - Bringing wildlife to Your Backyard</STRONG></H4>
<OL TYPE=A>
<LI>Remove the plastic bottom cap (use hot water) from the 2-liter soda bottle and save.
<LI>Cut off both ends of the bottle.
<LI>On one end on the bottle, cut two semi-circle openings.  <LI>Tape bottle onto pie tin with duct tape.  Make sure the end with the semi-circle openings face down.  <LI>Punch two holes in the bottom of the pie tin and place a piece of duct tape between the two.  <LI>Run a loop of string through the holes and up through the bottle.  <LI>Thread the string through the two separate holes on the plastic end cap.  Tie the string together at the top.  <LI>Fill with bird seed and hang from a nearby tree.  </OL> <H4><STRONG>2.  What Did Your Lunch Cost Wildlife?</STRONG></H4>
<P>Indigenous people get all the food they need from the land and its creatures.  But did you know that what you eat affects nature in many ways?  Thinks about something as simple as a slice of bread.  Where does it come from?  Think of all the energy spe
nt on transportation!</P>
<CENTER><STRONG>Bread -> Grocery Store -> Packaging and Processing Plant -> Farm</STRONG>
</P>Think of Something you like to eat and figure out how it affects wildlife.</P>
Send what you find out to the Zoo with your pledge card!</CENTER>
<H4>3.  Carry your Trash</H4>
<P>People throw away an average of 7 pounds of garbage every day!  How much trash do you produce in a day?  Carry a trash bag around for a day and throw all of your trash into it.  You might be surprised at how much you’ve thrown away by the end of the da
y!</P>
<H3>Did you know?</H3>
<OL>
<LI>The average person in Ohio produces 7 pounds of trash every day.
<LI>An average American uses 7 trees a year in the form of paper, wood and other tree products (1 1/2 billion trees total).
<LI>If you leave the water running while you brush your teeth, you can waste up to 5 gallons of water.
<LI>Americans use 2.5 million plastic bottles every hour.
<LI>We throw away 28 billion bottles and jars every year.
<LI>1/3 of the garbage in dumps is from packaging materials.

<B>One Great Ape!</B><BR>
Gorillas are the largest of all the primates, weighing as much as 600 
pounds.  However, not all gorillas are such giants -- the males are 
generally twice as large as the females!<P>

<IMG SRC="gorilla.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT>

<B>Gentle Giants</B><BR>
Contrary to popular belief, gorillas are not chest-beating savages. In 
fact, they are actually very gentle and docile.  Scientists who have 
studied gorilla activity have determined that the only time these animals 
are aggressive is when they are protecting their family groups.  These 
groups often consist of one fully adult male called the "silverback", 
five 
to ten females that he protects, and their offspring.  The silverback 
plays a very important role in the group, not only as the protector, but 
also as the key link among females.  Young females leave their family 
when they mature, so all of the adult females in the group are 
unrelated.  
It is their common link to the silverback that keeps them together.<P>

<B>A Folivorous Feeder</B><BR>
The peace-loving gorillas feed mainly on leaves and other plant parts.  
This type of feeding strategy is described as "folivorous."  Since leaves 
are abundant in their natural habitat, gorillas have fairly small ranges. 
Thus, family groups consisting of 10 to 30 gorillas gather their food 
throughout the morning and late afternoon, and often take long, mid-day 
siestas.<P>

<B>The Gorilla Family Tree</B><BR>
There are three races of gorillas in the wild:  the Eastern lowland, the 
Western lowland, and Mountain gorillas. What separates the Eastern from 
Western lowland gorillas is the Zaire River.  What is the reason for this 
separation?  Unlike people, gorillas cant swim!  The Mountain gorilla 
lives in the highland forests of Rwanda.<P>

<CENTER>
<b>Did You Know?</b>
</CENTER>
If a big male silverback gorilla spread his arms out wide, it would 
measure 8 feet from finger tip to finger tip!<P>

<B>The "Forest Giraffe"</B><BR>
The okapis appearance has left many people scratching their heads.  
Although it looks like part zebra, part horse, its closest relative is 
actually the giraffe. The most striking similarity between the okapi and 
the giraffe is their long, prehensile tongues.  These tongues are used 
for 
pulling leaves off branches, as well as grooming hard-to-reach places.  
In 
fact, the okapis tongue is so long that it can be used to clean its ears!<P>

<B>A Well Kept Secret</B><BR>
As one of the last large mammals to be "discovered", the okapi was not 
known to scientists until 1901, when it was first observed by British 
explorer Sir Henry Johnston.  Even though a century has passed since its 
"discovery", there is still much to learn about this elusive animal.  The 
okapis dark color and striped markings make it difficult to spot in the 
Ituri Forest of Zaire, its native habitat.  In addition, its great speed 
and acute hearing make this rare animal difficult to track.  Increased 
knowledge, however, is essential if we are to protect this endangered 
species.  <P>


<B>A Fragile Future</B><BR>
For centuries, people of the Ituri forest have relied on 
subsistence hunting.  This type of hunting has had little impact on wild 
populations of okapis. Commercial poaching, however, has had a 
devastating 
effect on all of the animals in the Ituri forest. Since 1933, the 
government of Zaire has protected the okapi.  Enforcing these protective 
laws, however, is very difficult in the remote areas where okapi live.  <P>

Laws are also essential for protecting the Ituri Forest from the demands 
of an ever growing human population.  The survival of all of the Ituri 
animals, including the okapi, is dependent upon maintaining this region 
as a heathy, liveable habitat.<P>

<CENTER><B>Did You Know?</B></CENTER>
All hoofed mammals, including okapi, have tiny friends living inside of 
them!  Bacteria living in the okapi's stomach helps it to digest the 
plant 
parts that it eats.  Bacteria breaks down cellulose (which forms the cell 
wall of plants) and thus enables the okapi to digest its meals.<P>

<B>Old Man in the Forest</B><BR>
Legends that began deep within the steamy jungles of Sumatra and Borneo 
tell of the "old man of the forest."  These tales actually referred to 
one of the five species of great apes, the orangutan. Its distinctive 
reddish-brown hair makes it easy to identify.  Although skeletally 
similiar to humans, an orang&#185;s arms are one and one-half times 
larger than its legs and carry most of the animal's weight.<P>


<IMG SRC="orang.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT>
<B>Tree Top Traveler</B><BR>

Orangutans are an aboreal, or tree-dwelling, species. One reason orangs 
live the "high life" is safety - none of its natural enemies live in the 
upper levels of the forest.  As they swing from tree to tree, the main 
danger that they face is the possibility of a bone-breaking fall.  
Since orangutans are superbly adapted for life in the trees, however, 
this seldom happens.<P>

Some of this tree-dweller's adaptations include: long arms, which allow 
it to swing from branch to branch; and an ability grab with both its 
hands and feet. Since orangs find food, water, shelter, and space in the 
trees, they rarely come to the ground.  In fact, orangs actually build 
nests to sleep in the trees!<P>



<B>A Solo Artist</B><BR>

As the largest-bodied, fruit-eating animal, orangutans spend most of 
their day searching for food. This all-consuming search even affects its 
social life.  Since fruit trees do not grow in clusters and are thus 
widely separated, orangs usually live alone.  They only come together for 
mating or to occasionally share fruit from the same tree.  Even when they 
are eating in the same area, they pay little attention to each other.  
Mother orangutans, however, are very close to their young.  Orangutan 
babies are not weaned until they are three years old.  They often stay 
with their mothers until the age of seven.<P>

Orangutans have a natural amplifier! By inflating its large throat pouch, 
an adult male orangutan adds volume to his call<P>

<IMG SRC="bonobo.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT>             
<B>What is a Bonobo?</B><P>


The bonobo is one of two members of the Chimpanzee family (with the 
common chimpanzee as the other member). At one time, the bonobo was 
called a "pygmy" chimpanzee.  The name "pygmy" is misleading because the 
two species are about the same height (bonobo having a 
slightly lighter build). Bonobos may be  more intelligent than common 
chimpanzees, exhibiting more complex social behaviors. They are less 
aggressive, more playful and share parenting roles 
more than common chimpanzees.<P>



<B>Talk it Up!</B><P>


Bonobos communicate in a variety of ways just like we do. Vocalizations, 
facial expressions and body postures are all used to convey important 
information to each other. Expressing affection, 
anger, curiosity and fear must be clearly understood by everyone in order 
to maintain a stable social group.<P>



<B>Socially Acceptable Behavior</B><P>


All bonobos prefer to live in a social group.  The size of the group may 
vary, but the number of males and females in the group is nearly equal. 
Sometimes the community breaks up into smaller groups called "parties." 
These smaller "parties" travel throughout their range looking for the 
plants and animals that make up the bonobo's diet.  Traveling in 
"parties" helps ensure that all the members of a group find enough food 
and don't deplete local resources. <P>



<B>Bad News for Bonobos</B><P>


Currently, bonobo populations number less than 20,000 individuals.  This 
number is assumed to be dropping.  Political unrest in Zaire is 
preventing researchers from entering the country, and has led to the end 
of negotiations with the government to set aside more protected land for 
bonobo habitat.  Previous to the war in Zaire, reserves were being 
patrolled regularly in order to protect existing bonobo populations from 
poaching.  Today, the guards have left their stations because of a lack 
of financial support and the threat of war.  This leaves bonobos 
completely unprotected.  Researchers fear the worst.  <P>

   

<CENTER>	<B>Did You Know?</B></CENTER>
The bonobo is more closely related to humans than any other animal alive 
today. They are 99% genetically identical to humans, and are very social 
and highly intelligent!<P>

<B>Land Giants</B><BR>

Elephants are the largest living land animals on the Earth today. There 
are two species of elephants, the African and the Asian elephant. The 
African elephant can weigh up to 13,000 pounds, and the smaller Asian 
elephant, which tips the scale at 11,000 pounds, is no light weight 
either!  <P>

<B>A Nose for Business</B><BR>

A feature unique to elephants is of course their long trunk, which is a 
nose and an upper lip all rolled into one. Elephants have short necks, 
which makes eating things on the ground or above their heads impossible.  
The trunk can lift food up to their mouth as well as grasp food from high 
above their head. This multi-purpose organ is also designed for drinking 
water, sensing odors, pushing and pulling, communicating through touch, 
vocalizing, and even acting as a snorkel for river crossings!<P>



<B>A Future in the Wild</B><BR>
Fewer than 50,000 Asian elephants exist in the wild today.  In order to 
protect Asian elephants, governments, conservationists and local people 
will need to work together to insure their future.  While African 
elephants numbers are approximately 500,000, their 
future will also depend upon people working together to protect habitat 
for wildlife. <P>



	<CENTER><B>Did You Know?</B></CENTER>
Elephants have a finger-like tip on the end of their trunk that is very 
sensitive and can pick up tiny objects; Asian elephants have one tip 
while African elephants have two.<P>

<b>Length:</b> 90cm<br>
<b>Wing Span:</b> 92cm<br>
<b>Habitat:</b> Tree tops of mature rain forest<br>
<b>Range:</b> East of the Andes mountains, North to Columbia, South to 
northern Argentina<br>
<b>Longevity:</b> Up to 60 years in captivity<br>
<b>Diet:</b> Seeds, nuts, fruit, berries, and vegetable matter found in 
tree tops<br>
<b>Reproduction:</b> Usually two elliptical eggs, hatching after 37 days.<p>


<IMG SRC="grenwing.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT>
<b>Color in the Canopy</b><br>
The Green-wing macaw is an impressive animal.  It measures three feet 
from head to tail, 
making it the second largest parrot in the world.  Not only is it big, 
but it is also 
strikingly beautiful.  The green-wing macaw is washed in red plumage, 
which gradually 
changes to green just past the shoulders.  From there to the tips of the 
wings, it is 
blue.  The tail starts as blue at the base,  is red in the middle and 
then ends in blue.  
This impressive tail can be half of the length of the entire bird.  A 
bird this bright
 should stand out like a sore thumb in a mainly green rain  forest.  Any 
predator worth 
its weight in teeth and talons would be able to pick off an animal that 
stands out like a 
macaw in a rain forest.  The good news for macaws is that most of the 
predators that 
would prey on macaws are color blind. Their color is not to advertise 
their availability 
as a food source, but is used more for staying in visual contact with 
other macaws in a 
very green and leafy rain forest.<p>

<b>Go Eat Dirt!</b><br>
No, this is not a common insult among macaw kind.  It is something that 
any macaw in 
their right mind would do or run the risk of death.  In 1983, scientists 
were on an 
expedition in Peru studying birds.   While trekking through the rain 
forest, they came 
to a river and on the other side were hundreds of macaws swarming over a 
clay bank at 
the rivers edge.  A closer look revealed that the macaws were eating the 
clay!  At first 
this seemed to be really weird behavior and they wrote it off as an 
isolated incident.  
Years later, researchers were studying the diet of macaws in the wild, 
and discovered 
that macaws were eating a large amount of fruit seeds.  What was amazing 
was that the 
seeds that they were eating were known to be very poisonous.  Plants in 
the rain forest 
often package their seeds in tasty fruit in order to entice animals to 
eat the fruit and 
in the process spread their seeds around, but most plants do not plan on 
macaw ingenuity. 
 Scientist think that the reason that macaws eat clay is to detoxify the 
poison in the 
seeds that they feed on.  How macaws came to this solution is unknown, 
but you have to 
take into account that many parrots -including macaws - have a very large 
brain for 
their body size.  <p>

<b>Macaw Maladies</b><br>
Worldwide, there are 330 species, or types, of parrots.  There are 140 
parrot species 
found in the Americas, with a full 42 species being at risk of 
extinction.  If you think 
that sounds bad then listen to this: Of the remaining 98 non-threatened 
species, nearly 
all are in decline and may require conservation efforts on there behalf 
to avoid a 
crisis.  So why are parrots in so much trouble?  The reasons are often 
complex, but in 
the case of the green wing, it is easier to pinpoint two basic reasons: 
habitat loss and 
the pet trade.  
<p>

Green-wing macaws prefer to live in the canopy - the middle layer - of a 
mature rain 
forest.  Since rain forests are disappearing at a rate of one acre of 
forest per second, 
the animals that live in the forest - like macaws - are vanishing with 
the trees.  Macaws 
are cavity nesters which means that they have to have large mature trees 
in which to 
excavate a hole that is big enough for one parent and the eggs.  It takes 
a long time 
for a tree to grow large enough to replace a macaw nest tree, or it may 
never be replaced
 if an area is clear cut.  
<p>

There were 703,000 parrots from Central and South America imported into 
the United States 
for the pet trade from 1981 to 1985.  The sad fact is that the people 
that buy these 
birds are contributing to the decline of the species in the wild.  Today, 
there are laws 
in place that ban the import of birds for the pet trade.  Even though it 
is illegal, 
there is a very healthy poaching  industry dedicated to smuggling birds 
around the 
world.  To buy a bird today, the bird has to have been bred and born in 
captivity.  
Before you run out to buy a parrot, consider these points:<br>
<ul>
<li>Parrots learn to mimic any sound that they like.  If it is a baby cry 
or a drippy faucet 
then you will be hearing those noises for years after your baby has grown 
up and you have 
fixed your faucet. 
<li>Parrots live a very long time.  The record is 120 years, so you can 
enjoy your "baby" and 
your "faucet" for your lifetime.
<LI>The Zoo does not want your parrot when you get tired of it.
<LI>Parrots are very expensive, both to feed and to provide adequate 
health care for.
<LI>You will have to spend a large amount of money for a metal cage for 
your parrot.  A 
wooden or wire cage will not do.  A large macaw can chew through a two by 
four in less 
than a hour.  
</ul><p>
<center>
<b>Did You Know?</b>
</center><p>
A green-wing macaw can exert several hundred pounds of pressure per 
square inch with it's
 beak .  Simply put they can crack a broom handle in half with just their 
beak.  In the 
wild, it is used for cracking open nuts to get at the meat inside.<p>

<p>This 1973 act is the single most important piece of environmental legislation ever created.  It is based on the assumption that each life form may prove valuable in ways we cannot measure, and each is entitled to exist for its own sake as well.  It is,
 essentially, a bill of rights for all living creatures.  One of the ESA’s major achievements is that is has broadened our conservation focus to include the great majority of species that were previously neglected.  Since its inception in 1973, the list o
f endangered species has risen from 109 to 900, with 3,500 species on the waiting list.  The act is credited with having literally saved such animals as the grizzly bear, the peregrine falcon, the American alligator and the bald eagle.</p>

<p>After more than 20 years in operation, the ESA has taught lessons that are far-reaching.  However the core message is that whole ecosystems, from alpine summits to wetlands, are being altered as the individual species that live there are disappearing. 
 This new approach is shifting the focus from saving species to preserving whole ecosystems. </p>

<p>The ESA has come under attack recently by  anti-environmentalists in 
key leadership positions.  Many of its basic tenets are in danger of being 
undermined.  The act will be up for re-authorization this summer, so it 
is vital that your voice is heard in support of it now.  We urge you to 
lend your help to this critical issue.  In doing so, you’ll be saving 
more than the animals on the endangered species list.  You’ll be saving 
yourself.</p>

<h4>
Cincinnati Zoo Hosts Annual Spring Floral Festival April 13 through May 12
</h4>
	Once again spring arrives at one of the most visited public 
gardens in the United States, the Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Garden.  
Be prepared to "stop and smell the roses" because this year's "Hearts & 
Flowers" promises even more flowering bulbs than last year.<P>
<IMG SRC="gaztrain.gif" align=left>	The Spring Floral Festival features 
over a million flowering bulbs and tens of thousands of other blooms.  
This year's event will feature new hardy varieties of flowering shrubs, 
flowering cherries and magnolias.<P>
	Many other trees and shrubs can be found; other beauties on Zoo 
grounds include 110 varieties of daffodils and 20 varieties of tulips, as 
well as dogwoods, viburnums and forsythia.  With every passing day that 
the weather gets warmer, one of the most impressive displays of flowering 
plants in the Midwest will change. And since 40,000 new bulbs were 
planted this year, the 1996 version of "Hearts and Flowers" promises to 
be a unique experience.<p>
	During the event, tours, workshops and a plant sale will take 
place, along with a few surprises.<p>
	"Hearts & Flowers" will be open daily from 9 a.m. until 5 p.m. at 
the Cincinnati Zoo.  However, the park remains open until dusk.  Zoo 
admission fees are $8 for adults and $5.75 for senior citizens.  Children 
ages 2-12 are $4.50 and children under 2 are free.  For more information,

<H4>Botanical Highlights of the Spring Floral Festival</h4>

	Every year at the Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Garden hundreds of 
thousands of bulbs and early flowers bloom for a beautiful and colorful 
display of Spring.  The difference at this year's Spring Floral Festival 
however, is that 40,000 new bulbs have been planted, resulting in over a 
million bulbs throughout the Zoo.  "Hearts & Flowers" in 1996 will show 
off both old and new Spring Floral Festival beauties, so it won't be hard 
to live up to its reputation as one of the outstanding spring bulb 
displays in the United States.<P>
<IMG SRC="reptileflowers.gif" ALIGN=LEFT>	"Hearts & Flowers" will feature 
daffodils, forsythia, flowering 
cherries, magnolias, tulips, lilacs and dozens of other flowering trees 
and shrubs.  This year there will be 110 varieties of daffodils 
including, appropriately enough, the White Lion, Flowerdrift and Barret 
Browning.  Twenty varieties of tulips will be on display, and with names 
like White Dream, Red Emperor and China Pink, one can only imagine the 
resplendent display in store.  <P>
	Of course, all of the old favorites will be back, including 
plenty of magnolias, dogwoods and forsythias of numerous varieties and 
types.  In total, over 3,000 kinds of ornamental plants will be on 
display during "Hearts & Flowers."<P>

The 80th Anniversary of the Death of the Last Passenger Pigeon
</H1></TD></TR></TABLE>

<i>by David Ehrlinger</i><p>

        On September 1, 1914 one of the most notable events in the
history of American wildlife occurred when the last passenger
pigeon died at the Cincinnati Zoo. She was called "Martha," and
evidently named for Martha Washington, the wife of the "Father"
of our country.  Martha was a famous bird in her last years and
visited by many authorities as well as multitudes of older Zoo
visitors who could then remember the huge flocks of pigeons from
many years before.  <p>

<IMG SRC="hortpix/Martha.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT>
         Passenger pigeons were one of the most remarkable 
and unique birds to ever live. Native to eastern North America, they once
were the most numerous species of bird on earth, numbering in
the billions and in dense multitudes they flew, roosted, fed,
and nested. No other bird has ever lived in such abundance. They
flew in enormous flocks that filled the sky and sometimes
extended for dozens of miles. Their nesting sites were vast,
sometimes holding all of the nesting birds from several states
in one expansive area.  These sites sometimes stretched over two
hundred square miles of forests with each individual tree
holding dozens of nests. The abundance of passenger pigeons and
their colonial nesting habits were their undoing because they
became an easy prey for commercial hunters who slaughtered them 
by the millions for city food markets in the years after the
Civil War. Unlike mourning doves, their familiar relatives,
passenger pigeons evidently required dense aggregations to
successfully breed and thrive in the wild and they could not
survive when their numbers were reduced beyond a certain level.
In the 1880s people began to notice a diminished number of wild
pigeons, but because of their former abundance this scarcity was
not taken seriously. Finally, by the 1890s it was evident to all
that passenger pigeons, as well as a number of other native
species such as bison, were threatened with extinction.  <p>

        The Cincinnati Zoo first exhibited passenger pigeons in 1876
and by 1885 fourteen birds were had been hatched in captive
broods. There are two conflicting accounts of the origins of the
last passenger pigeon, Martha, which have created confusion in
literature since. The first account is based on a letter in 1907
from the Zoo's General Manager Sol Stephan in which he wrote
that the Zoo's last female passenger pigeon was acquired from
Professor Charles Whitman of the University of Chicago in 1902
from birds reared in Wisconsin. However, from 1914 until his
death in 1949 Sol Stephan steadfastly maintained in interviews
and articles that Martha had been hatched at the Zoo in 1885.
The reasons for the discrepancy are unclear, possibly, a mistake
was made in the  identity of the last female bird by Zoo staff
prior to the 1907 correspondence. Whatever her origins, Martha
outlived all others of her species. After 1899 the Zoo had a
standing offer of $1000 to buy another pair but, the birds were
gone from the wild. The Zoo even tried to breed Martha with
other species of pigeons to no avail. Martha finally died on
September 1, 1914. Her body was preserved in ice and sent to the
Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D. C., where it remains
today. <p>

        Martha lived in one of seven aviaries, one of which still
stands across from the Cat House exit. The building has been
preserved as a museum memorial to passenger pigeons and other
extinct and endangered species. The pagoda-style aviary building
is an architectural delight and part of the original Zoo that
was constructed in 1875. It is the second oldest zoo building in
America, following the Zoo's Reptile House that was completed
earlier that same year. The next time you visit the Zoo, stop at
Martha's memorial, take a few minutes to study its displays, and
consider this wonderful species of bird that has for eighty
years now been gone from this earth. <p>

<H3>What is the Conservation Fund?</H3>

<P>Founded in 1873, the Cincinnati Zoo & Botanical Garden has consistently
taken a leadership role in the effort to preserve and protect animal species
throughout the world. Our work in the area of conservation stands out among
American zoos, and is admired by members of the conservation community across
the globe.</P>

<P>Nevertheless, wildlife populations continue to decline, and many species
face outright extinction. The major cause of the crisis is habitat loss,
particularly in the tropical rain forests of the world. Home to 50% of all
plant and animal species, the rain forests covered 20% of the Earth&iacute;s
surface. Devastated by deforestation, they now account for less than 7%.
Accordingly, our mission has evolved beyond the conservation of species
to that of habitat preservation - saving the ecosystems in which these species
belong.</P>

<P>In 1990, the Zoo Conservation Fund was established so that our institution
could join habitat preservation efforts around the world. The fund now helps
to support four rain forest ecosystems - each unique and biologically diverse.</P>

<P><BR>
<HR ALIGN=LEFT><BR>
</P>

<H3>Suriname</H3>

<P>Suriname&iacute;s vast rain forests are among the most pristine wilderness
areas in South America, and are home to thousands of plant species and hundreds
of species of birds, mammals, reptiles, and amphibians. They are alive with
eight species of primates, including golden-headed tamarins, red howler
monkeys, and white-faced sakis, as well as jaguars, tapirs, peccaries, and
tamanduas &shy; all dependent on the rain forest for survival.</P>

<P>Strengthened by the efforts of Conservation International, many Surinamese
have a deep commitment to preserving this fragile habitat. The Zoo Conservation
Fund assists by creating educational guides for the visitors to the Raleighvallen-Voltzberg
Nature Reserve. Fund contributions also support public awareness campaigns
to protect endangered species, including the poison dart frog, <I>Dendrobates
azureus</I>.</P>

<H3>Gabon</H3>

<P>The Gamba Reserve, located along the coast of Gabon in West Africa, unites
diverse marine, tropical forest, and savannah habitats to create a true
wildlife paradise. It is the only place in the world where elephants and
forest buffalo roam the beaches, African manatees live in the lagoons, and
humpback whales and leatherback sea turtles feed offshore. Within the virgin
forest, bongo antelope, duiker, hippopotamus, leopard, and 20 species of
primates, including chimpanzees, are thriving. There 400 of Gabon&iacute;s
650 bird species nest in the green canopy and along the rich waterways.</P>

<P>The Zoo Conservation Fund supports the work of the World Wildlife Fund
in building ranger stations now staffed by full time guards who monitor
wildlife populations and deter poaching within the reserve.</P>

<H3>Zaire</H3>

<P>Zaire&iacute;s Ituri Forest is one of the most remote areas on the continent
of Africa. Forest wildlife includes bongo, duiker, Congo peafowl, and chimpanzees
as well as the rare okapi. The indigenous Lese and Efe people have lived
in harmony with the Ituri Forest for thousands of years, and are dependent
upon its resources for food, medicine, clothing, and shelter.</P>

<P>Like most indigenous groups in emerging cultures, the people of the Ituri
Forest struggle to maintain control over policies that affect their lives.
The Ituri Fund assists the Efe and Lese in establishing schools and providing
health care services. The Zoo Conservation Fund contributes to the effort
by supporting teacher salaries. The Fund also supplies educational materials
promoting literacy awareness of ecological issues.</P>

<H3>Sumatra</H3>

<P>The Gunung Leuser National Park is Indonesia&iacute;s largest remaining
wilderness area. Unrivaled in biological diversity, the park encompasses
a broad range of habitats, from coastal rain forests to mountain peaks.
The Sumatran orangutan, Sumatran tiger, Asian elephant, great argus pheasant,
rhinoceros hornbill, flying fox, sun bear, binterong, and the very endangered
Sumatran rhino all live within the park boundaries.</P>

<P>Working with the World Wildlife Fund, the Zoo Conservation Fund protects
these habitats through support of a Geographical Information System (GIS)
which helps park rangers to strike a balance between wildlife conservation
and encroaching human needs.</P>

<P><BR>
<HR ALIGN=LEFT><BR>
</P>

<H3>A Call to Action</H3>

<P>Every species on the planet is a part of a fragile and unique habitat,
and the frightening reality of our world is this: if we do not protect our
habitats, our most wondrous species will surely disappear from our midst.</P>

<P>Your support of the Zoo Conservation Fund will go a long way toward protecting
endangered habitats throughout the world, including those of many of the
species on display at the Cincinnati Zoo & Botanical Garden. Please join
this important effort today. Conservation cannot wait.</P>

<H1>Habitat = Wildlife</H1>

<P>Many problems face the world&iacute;s wild creatures, but none are more
pressing than the shrinking of wild areas. Ask any hunter, fisherman or
bird watcher how they know where to find their quarry and the answer will
be the same: HABITAT. If enough viable habitat for the species exists, odds
are you will find them there. In the words of conservation leader, David
Brower, &quot;wild species are only 2 percent flesh and bone and 98 percent
place.&quot;</P>

<P>It sounds fairly simple; but the trouble is that many of the Earth&iacute;s
wild plants are in a deadly game of habitat musical chairs when it comes
to their homes. Each year when the migrating birds return to nest, or another
young organism attempts to establish a territory, there are often fewer
options than the previous year.</P>

<P>That is the very reason that the Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Garden
works so hard to help our visitors and members understand the vital importance
of wild habitat for wild species. It is also why we work with a worldwide
network of conservation organizations like the Nature Conservancy and Conservation
International to help protect critical wild areas.</P>

<P>When the Cincinnati Zoo first opened its gates in 1875, the world was
a vastly different place. Over much of the world, wild areas dominated the
landscape, with pockets of human habitation and cultivation interspersed
between. Today, however, with nearly 6 billion people, there are only islands
of wild areas remaining in a sea of human development and agriculture.</P>

<P>With wild areas under siege and at greater risk than ever, the role and
message of a modern zoo has evolved into becoming that of an environmental
resource center - a place where students can learn how natural ecosystems
work and what it will take to protect them. William Conway, Director of
the Bronx Zoo and leading guru of the zoo field, puts it this way, &quot;zoos
have too much to do to subside into 'Ye Olde Williamsburg'- like museums
representing idealized habitats of yesteryear. Teaching about a living nature
demands saving is a compelling mission. Teaching about a world that no longer
exists is much less so. Zoos must focus their central efforts upon the preservation
of nature.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;The Idea of Wilderness needs no defense, only more defenders.&quot;
- Edward Abbey</P>

<P>Zoos are community resources dedicated to nurturing in their visitors
the interest and love of wildlife, and increasingly, to incite action for
the preservation of nature.</P>

Yet these forests cover only 5% of the Earth's land. Imagine so much life

If future generations are to remember us more with gratitude than with 
sorrow, we must achieve more than just the miracles of technology. We 
must also leave them a glimpse of the world as it was created, not 
just as it looked when we got through with it. <br>
					<b>	-Lyndon B. Johnson </b><p>
 
 
The beauty of our land is a natural resource. Its preservation is linked to 
the prosperity of the human spirit.<br> 
						<b>-Lyndon B. Johnson </b><p>
 
 
The earth can be an abundant mother if we learn to use her with skill and wisdom- to tend to her wounds, 
replenish her vitality, and utilize her potentialities. <br>
					<B>	-John F. Kennedy </b><p>
 
 
The earth we abuse and the living things we kill, will in the end, take their revenge; for in exploiting their 
presence, we are diminishing our future. <br>
					<b>	-Marya Mannes </b><p>
 
There is a true music of Nature; <br>
	the song of the birds, <br>
	the whisper of leaves, <br>
	the ripple of waters upon a sandy shore,<br> 
	and the wail of wind or sea. <br>
					<b>	-John Lubbock </b><p>
 
 
We enjoy the lonesome and the empty because, unlike our ancestors, we are too familiar with the crowded 
and the confined. <br>
					<b>	-Joseph Wood Krutch </b><p>
 
 
Touch the earth, love the earth, honor the earth, her plains, her valleys, her hills, and her seas; rest your 
spirit in her solitary places. <br>
					<b>	-Henry Beston </b><p>
 
 
To deprive the globe of physical wilderness would be to give a deep wound to 
our own kind. <br>
					<b>	-F. Fraser Darling and 
						Noel D. Eichorn </b><p>
 
 
In the long war on wildlife, man has steadily advanced and wildlife retreated. We are now in danger of 
achieving total victory. We have the capability to wipe out competing life on a tremendous scale. In such a 
victory we would surely find catastrophic defeat. <br>
					<b>	-Faith McNulty </b><p>
 
 
Man is demolishing nature...We are killing things that keep us alive.<br> 
					<b>	-Thor Heyerdahl </b><p>
 
 
 
You find yourself alone, finally freed from all reminders of civilization, 
encountering (and maybe beginning to understand) the rhythms of nature itself.
 As you camp beside a mountain lake, and wander its shores, peer under its 
banks, sit on its boulders and stare at the slowly changing colors in the 
water, you begin to conceive of yourself once again as a natural being, a 
single pure note in the harmony surrounding you. The sound of your own breath 
will become the sound of the wind; the lap of the water will keep time with 
the pulse of your blood. And you'll know why you went to all that effort to 
get there. And you'll wonder why you didn't do it sooner. Home again. 
For the first time. <br>
					<b>	-Jon Carroll </b><p>
 
 
This we know. The Earth does not belong to man; man belongs to the Earth. This we know. All things are 
connected like the blood which unites one family. All things are connected. Whatever befalls the Earth 
befalls the sons of the Earth. Man did not weave the web of life; he is merely a strand in it. Whatever he 
does to the web, he does to himself. <br>
					<b>	-Chief Seattle </b><p>
 
 
This curious world we inhabit is more wonderful than convenient; <br>
more beautiful than it is useful;  <br>
it is more to be admired and enjoyed than used. <br>
					<b>	-Henry David Thoreau </b><p>
 
 
Suddenly a man realizes that the age of universal iron and steel, smog and clamor, glass and plastic and 
aluminum, is almost upon him. It seems as if our children may someday read of the America wilderness... 
as we read of lost Atlantis. <br>
					<b>	-Edward Abbey </b><p>
 
 
The love of wilderness is more than a hunger for what is always beyond reach, 
it is also an expression of loyalty to the earth (the earth which bore us 
and sustains us), the only home we shall ever know, the only 
paradise we ever need- if only we had the eyes to see. <br>
					<b>	-Edward Abbey </b><p>
 
 
Something will have gone out of us as apeople if we ever let the remaining 
wilderness be destroyed... if we pollute the last clean air and dirty the 
last clean streams and push our paved roads through the last of the 
silence.<br> 
					<b>	-Wallace Stegner </b><p>
 
 
The world needs a place where wolves stalk the strand lines in the dark, because a land that can produce a 
wolf is a healthy, robust, and a perfect land. <br>
					<b>	-Robert B. Weeden, 
						wildlife biologist </b><p>
 
 
Man depends on wildlife for survival, and wildlife depends equally on man. The two must find means for 
living together on planet earth or there will be no life on earth. <br>
					<b>	-Raymond R. Dasmann </b><p>
 
 
The beauty and genius of a work of art may be reconceived, though its first material expression destroyed; 
a vanished harmony may yet again inspire the composer; but when the last individual of a race of living 
things breathes no more, another heaven and another earth must pass before 
such a one can be again. <br>
					<b>	-William Beebe </b><p>
 
 
Come into the mountains, dear friend <br>
Leave society and take no one with you but your true self <br>
Get close to nature <br>
Your everyday games will be insignificant <br>
Notice the clouds spontaneously forming patterns <br>
And try to do that with your life <br>
					<b>	-Susan Polis Schultz </b><p>
 
 
Remember the circle of the sky <br>
	the stars and the brown eagle <br>
	the great life of the sun <br>
	the young within the nest <br>
Remember the sacredness of things <br>
					<b>	-Pawnee </b><p>
 
 
Is civilization progress? The challenge, I think, is clear; and, as clearly, the final answer will be given not 
by our amassing of knowledge, or by the discoveries of our science, or by the speed of our aircraft, but by 
the effect our civilized activities as a whole have upon the quality of our planet's life- the life of plants and 
animals as well as that of men. <br>
					<b>	-Charles A. Lindbergh, Jr </b><p>
 
 
Conservation is not so much a science  as an ecological point of view, a morality, an ethics inseparably 
linked to the science of biology and to human welfare. <br>
					<b>	-Hugh H. Iltis </b><p>
 
 
During an inexplicable and meaningless moment we will have appeared, peered about, and disappeared. 
A vertical rising and instantly descending line on a graph in the indifferent eons of time. Nothing more. 
So- if you can, wring the most out of that nothingness!... Quickly now- get on your way! Start exploring, 
navigating this small life-saturated, indefinably wonderful only 
planet that we will ever know. <br>
					<b>	-Robert Hittredge </b><p>
 
 
Animals were once, for all of us, teachers. They instructed us in ways of being and perceiving that 
extended our imaginations,  that were models for additional possibilities. We watched them make their 
way through the intricacies of their lives with wonder and with awe. Seeing the wolf pick his delicate way 
across the snowy forest floor, the eyes of the owl hold the image of the mouse, the dark shape of the whale 
break the surface of the sea- 
reminded us of the grand sweep and diversity of life, of its infinite 
possibilities. <br>
					<b>	-Joan McIntyre </b><p>
 
 
 
We have not inherited the Earth from our parents, we have borrowed it from 
our children. <br>
					<b>	-IUCN </b><p>
 
 
One does not meet oneself until one catches the reflection from an eye 
other than human. <br>
					<b>	-Loren Eiseley </b><p>
 
 
 
The fact is that no species has ever had such wholesale control over 
everything on earth, living or dead, as 
we now have. In our hands now lies not only our own future but that of all other living creatures with 
whom we share the earth. <br>
					<b>	-David Attenborough </b><p>
 
 
Nature will deliberately reveal itself... if only we look. <br>
					<b>	-Thomas Edison </b><p>
 
 
It takes a very long period of watching to really become familiar with an animal and to attain a deeper 
understanding of its behavior; and without love for the animal itself, no observer, however patient, could 
ever look at it long enough to make vauable observations on its behavior. 
<br>
					<b>	-Konrad Lorenz </b><p>
 
 
Life outside a person is an extension of the life within him. This compells him to be part of it and accept 
responsibility for all creatures great and small. Life becomes harder, when we live for others, but it also 
becomes richer and happier. <br>
					<b>	-Albert Schweitzer </b><p>
 
 
A man is ethical only when life, as such, is sacred to him, that of plants and animals as well as that of his 
fellowman, and when he devotes himself helpfully to all life that is in 
need of help. <br>
					<b>	-Albert Schweitzer </b><p>
 
 
This world, after all our science and sciences, is still a miracle, 
wonderful, inscrutable, magical and more, to whosoever will think of it. <br>
					<b>	-Thomas Carlyle </b><p>
 
 
The worst sin towards our fellow creatures is not to hate them, but to be indiffernet to them; that's the 
essence of inhumanity. <br>
					<b>	-George Bernard Shaw </b><p>
 
 
It is the responsibility of all who are alive today to accept the trusteeship of wildlife and to hand on to 
posterity, as a source of wonder and interest, knowliedge and enjoyment, the entire wealth of diverse 
animals and plants. This generation has no right by selfishness, wanton or international destruction, or 
neglect, to rob future generations of this rich heritage. Extermination of other creatures is a disgrace to 
humankind. <br>
					<b>	-World Wildlife Charter </b><p>
 
 
We need another and a wiser and perhaps a more mystical concept of animals. Remote from universal 
nature, and living by complicated artifice, man in civilization surveys the creature through the glass of his 
knowledge and sees thereby a feather magnified and the whole image in distortion. We patronize tham for 
their incompleteness, for their tragic fate of having taken form so far below ourselves. And therein we err, 
and greatly err. For the animal shall not be measured by man. In a world older and more complete than 
ours they moved finished and complete, gifted with extensions of the senses we have lost or never 
attained, living by voices we shall never hear. They are not brethren, they are not underlings; they are 
other nations, caught with ourselves in the net of life and time, fellow prisoners of the splendour and 
travail of the earth. <br>
					<b>	-Henry Beston from The Outermost 
House </b><p> 
 
 
Mechanized recreation has already seized nine-tenths of the woods and mountains; a decent respect for 
minorities should dedicate the other tenth to wilderness. <br>
					<b>	-Aldo Leopold </b><p>
 
I go to Nature to be soothed and healed, 
and have my senses put in tune once more. <br>
					<b>	-John Burroughs </b><p>

<h3>The Botanical Garden at the Cincinnati Zoo</h3>

        As soon as visitors set foot in the Zoo they are also
among our naturalistic botanical garden, a living museum
with over three thousand kinds of plants from around the
world. <p>

         Ever since the Cincinnati Zoo was founded 120 years ago a
combination of animals and plants has been a part of the
institution's vision. In nature plants and animals are
intimately connected. Their ecological relationships are
incredibly complex and a fundamental part of life on earth.
Plants capture the solar energy of the sun and make it
available to practically all of the other life forms on
earth. Plants provide animals with shelter and cover and in
turn, various animals provide plants with fertilizer,
pollination and seed dispersal.  <p>

        From a human perspective, plants are intimately connected
to people in a myriad of ways. Plants provide food,
shelter, medicine, chemicals, and many other raw materials.
Beyond our nutritional and economic dependence upon them,
plants and flowers are inherently pleasing and interesting
to people. Plants, gardens, and natural landscapes have an
emotionally relaxing, restorative, influence on humans,
that is a part of our natural, genetic roots.    <p>

        At the Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Garden our
award-winning naturalistic landscapes and gardens
demonstrate the complexity and diversity of nature, its
beauty and its excitement. Labeling and educational
programs inform visitors of the vital relationships of
plants, animals, and people, fulfilling  an important part
of our institution's conservation and recreation mission. <p>

        The Cincinnati Zoo was originally planted in the 1870s as
an experimental garden with a large number of exotic trees
and shrubs from around the world. Some of the historic 19th
century trees still stand today. Visitors can see the giant
Japanese pagoda tree (the Ohio Champion) near the Vine
Street pedestrian entrance, the two hundred year old red
oak  and pin oak near the gazebo, and the big catalpas
between Swan Lake and the Education Center. <p>     

        Botanical gardens share some physical and aesthetic
qualities with conventional parks. In both one will find
ornamental trees, shrubs, and flowers.  Botanical gardens,
however, consist of labeled specimens that are available
for study, research, and enjoyment.      <P>

        Ever since 1894 the Zoo has endeavored to label its many
unusual trees and shrubs for visitor education and
enjoyment. Today one can see thousands of  trees, shrubs,
bulbs, annuals, perennials, ornamental grasses, and
tropical plants labeled with their identity, a description
of their ornamental characteristics, their region of
origin, and other information. <p>

         In botanical gardens horticulturists maintain plant
records, now generally on computer systems,  which keeps
track of the origin and location of each plant. Unlike many
typical botanical gardens, our botanical displays does not
include separate gardens of roses, lilacs, or
rhododendrons.  In general, our naturalistic plantings
blend with a multitude of animal exhibits to demonstrate
the complexity and diversity of the natural world rather
than human gardens.      <p>

        In many botanical gardens there is a strong interest in
preserving endangered plant species and in educating about
conservation. At the Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Garden
there are a number of endangered plant species in our plant
collection, including several American species. Many of
these can be seen in the new McIlheeny Endangered Species
Garden in front of the Zoo's research center, C.R.E.W.
(Center for the Reproduction of Endangered Wildlife).
C.R.E.W.'s Plant Division works through the technologies of
tissue culturing, in-vitro fertilization, and
cryopreservation (freezing) of seed to help preserve
endangered plants.        <p>

        At the Zoo's Botanical Center, located between the
Education Center and the gift shops visitors can learn
about plants and the symbiotic relationships of plants and
animals. Informative signs, photographs, special exhibits,
and stories from trained volunteers cultivate an
understanding of the riches of the natural world.
Throughout the year garden volunteers offer tours of the
gardens and landscape to garden clubs and other groups. For
further information regarding a garden tour for your group
call (513) 281-4701 ext. 8307. <p>

<H1>Cat Ambassador Program</H1>
</CENTER>
<P>

	Since its creation in 1980, the Cincinnati Zoo's Cat Ambassador 
Program has travelled to area schools and other community organizations 
to raise awareness of the plight of the world's cat species, many of 
which are in grave danger of disappearing forever.  Cathryn Hilker, 
Director of the Cat Ambassador Program, and trainers educate audiences 
about endangered cat species and what people can do to prevent these 
magnificent animals from becoming extinct.  Helping the staff present its 
message are the program's feline ambassadors.  These trained cats are 
ambassadors of good will who demonstrate some of their survival skills 
during the presentation.  The feline ambassadors represent such species 
as cheetah, serval, mountain lion, caracal, tiger, and ocelot.<p>
	Cathryn Hilker began the Cat Ambassador Program with one cat, a 
young female cheetah named <A HREF="angel.html">Angel</a>.  Through the 
generosity of 
Frisch's Restaurants, the program was founded and a special area of the 
Cincinnati Zoo, known as the Animal Recreation Center or ARC, was set 
aside to become the home for the friendly feline ambassadors.<p>
	Because of the Cat Ambassador Program, at least 100,000 people 
delight in the opportunity to view these wonderful cats up close.  Each 
summer the cats and staff present the show "Cats, Cats, Cats" at the 
Cincinnati Zoo.<p>

<center>

</center>

	As many as 50,000 school children see the cat ambassadors each 
year either at the zoo or in their own <A HREF="schools.html">schools</a>.  
The cat ambassadors travel to approximately 80 schools in the tri-state area 
annually.  
Cathryn Hilker and her cats are even TV celebrities, having appeared on 
national television shows to promote conservation.  Cathryn Hilker closes 
each program with this advice:  "Lead your lives more simply so that 
these beautiful animals might simply live."<p>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>CREW BEGINS NEW ERA</H1>

<P>	No scientist stands alone. Research simply cannot happen without collaboration.
 At the Cincinnati Zoo's Center for Reproduction of Endangered Wildlife
(CREW), that entails the cooperation of donors, visiting researchers, students,
veterinarians, animal keepers, other institutions and innumerable supporters.</P>

<P>	Dr. Terri Roth, Ph.D., the new director of CREW, and Dr. Bill Swanson,
D.V.M., Ph.D., the new head of CREW's animal division, are eager to bring
all these individuals together to expand an already strong research program.
First on Roth's agenda is evaluating CREW's resources and needs.</P>

<P>	&quot;(The focus of CREW) will be quality science with real conservation
applications,&quot; said Roth. &quot;We'll build on the foundation already
in place and incorporate more scientific disciplines to develop novel, more
efficient methods of studying diverse species.&quot;</P>

<P>	Both researchers were gamete biologists at NOAHS (New Opportunities
in Animal Health Science) &shy; based at the National Zoo's Conservation
and Research Center - where they conducted a variety of research projects
in collaboration with national and international organizations, including
a cheetah project with the Cincinnati Zoo. Their experience runs the gamut
from goats and horses to rhinos, scimitar-horned oryx, and a variety of
small cats such as the Pallas's cat, black footed cat and ocelot. They bring
both projects and funding with them to Cincinnati. </P>

<P>	Cincinnati is a great location for researchers seeking cooperation with
other organizations. &quot;There are zoos in Cleveland, Columbus, Toledo,
and Louisville and conservation centers such as The Wilds, all within a
reasonable distance,&quot; Swanson said.  &quot;We do a lot of collaborative
work so it's a natural for us.&quot;</P>

<P>	This 'reasonable distance' will really come into play if their plans
go through to develop an active mobile lab to take into the field.  &quot;We've
done that at NOAHS and it's been essential for conducting large-scale studies
of rare species,&quot; Roth adds. The lab would allow access to animals
at other institutions and other countries.  Working in conjunction with
assisted reproduction, a mobile lab would also limit the expense and stress
associated with moving animals between institutions for breeding.&quot;</P>

<P>	Additional plans further illustrate their collaborative outlook on research.
They want to expand on the rhinoceros work, further involving collaborators
at The Wilds and also developing partnerships in South Africa.</P>

<P>	Swanson's experience with felids in the Caribbean complements the Plant
Division's work in Trinidad and Tobago &shy; &quot;it's a natural connection'.
Already working on felid projects with scientists in Brazil, Swanson plans
to expand conservation efforts to South American countries and Mexico.</P>

<P>	Involving a variety of researchers is also at the top of Roth's agenda.
 She would like to bring in post-doctorates, nutritionists, geneticists,
and behaviorists to broaden the scope of research projects conducted at
CREW.  Another wish list item is an off-site breeding and research facility.</P>

<P>	Throughout it all, they want to spread knowledge.  &quot;I want to serve
in a facilitating role for scientists who want to do work here,&quot; Roth
adds. &quot;We want to make the most effective use of resources by incorporating
university scientists and experts in the field.&quot;</P>

<P>	Their aim is always the same &shy;&nbsp;quality science with real conservation
applications. This is most aptly demonstrated when their research projects
'leave something behind'.</P>

<P>	In one project, Swanson trained Brazilian veterinarians to do artificial
insemination. With that training, they were able to produce offspring in
ocelots and tigrinas (little spotted cats). &quot;Now they can begin to
do independent projects,&quot; says Swanson. &quot;They're grabbing onto
the technology, they really want this to work.&quot;</P>

<P>	These eminently qualified scientists will join with CREW's current staff
to take conservation research into the next century. By working together,
they hope to lessen the incidence of animals and plants standing alone as
the last of their kind.</P>

<P>	Roth began her duties effective October 1, 1996. Swanson will continue
to work with NOAHS until he joins CREW full-time effective August 1, 1997.</P>

<P>	Dr. Terri Roth is a California native. She earned both B.S. and M.S.
degrees at the University of California, Davis, and a Ph.D. at Louisiana
State University in Baton Rouge. She completed her post-doctoral training
at the National Zoological Park in Washington, D.C.</P>

<P>	Dr. Bill Swanson is a Texas native. He earned his B.S. in Zoology at
the University of Texas, Austin; B.S. in Veterinary Science at Texas A &amp;
M; and D.V.M. at Texas A &amp; M.  He attained his Ph.D. at Louisiana State
University, Baton Rouge, and completed his post-doctoral training at the
National Zoological Park in Washington, D.C.</P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Dr. Terri L. Roth<BR>
Director of CREW</H1>

<P>Dr. Terri L. Roth earned both B.S. and M.S. Degrees in Animal Science
at the University of California, Davis. She then was awarded a Board of
Regents Fellowship at Louisiana State University where she earned a Ph.D.
degree in Animal Reproductive Physiology. After completing her post-doctoral
training with the National Zoological Park's NOAHS (New Opportunities in
Animal Health Science) organization in Washington, D.C., she was employed
at the National Zoo's Conservation and Research Center as a gamete biologist
for three years before joining CREW on October 1, 1996.</P>

<P>As the new CREW director, Dr. Roth looks forward to building on the foundation
already in place. &quot;During the last decade, scientists have successfully
demonstrated the potential of biotechnology for assisting in the conservation
of endangered species,&quot; Dr. Roth says. &quot;In the next decade, we
need to focus on using this technology for conducting basic scientific research
that will allow us to learn more about the species, and the problems with
the species we are trying to save. Through this work, CREW will be able
to turn the potential of science and technology for conserving endangered
species into a reality.&quot;</P>

CREW Public Exhibit</H1>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>	The public exhibit, designed to educate visitors of all ages about the
important reproductive research being conducted at CREW, is open daily from
noon to 4 p.m., Memorial Day through Labor Day.  A CREW volunteer interpreter
explains the science and technology CREW is using to facilitate the conservation
of flora and fauna.</P>

<P>	The public exhibit consists of a main exhibit area and a side room.
 Science and research are demystified for Zoo visitors while they try their
hands at interactive displays and watch scientists work in laboratories.</P>

<P>	A detailed globe, five feet in diameter, is suspended on an axis in
the center of the main exhibit room.  Visitors are encouraged to touch any
one of the numerous points of light on the globe, each of which represents
an area where CREW staff are working and research is ongoing.  When a particular
area is touched, a video plays and describes CREW's conservation efforts
in that part of the world.  The globe is closely tied to other exhibits
in the room which also describe CREW's plant and animal research.</P>

<P>	To the right of the main room, visitors enter the &quot;Process Room,&quot;
featuring a window that looks into the Frozen Zoo and Garden.  Large liquid
nitrogen storage tanks containing the germplasm of rare animals and plants
are visible in the lab below.  </P>

<P>	A small video monitor next to the window is linked to the microscopes
in the lab and allows visitors to view the same images the scientists are
seeing.  This lab is the heart of the CREW facility because it holds tremendous
potential as a powerful tool for preserving wildlife.</P>

<P>	The main focus of the Public Exhibit is to enable visitors to learn
more about CREW, its ongoing research and the role it plays in saving endangered
species from extinction.</P>

CREW GARDEN SHOWCASES</H1>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>ENDANGERED PLANTS</H1>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>	A unique and attractive garden area devoted to endangered plants opened
Saturday, June 25, 1994 outside the Carl H. Lindner, Jr. Family Center for
Research of Endangered Wildlife (CREW) building at the Cincinnati Zoo and
Botanical Garden.  Most species of tree, shrub and wildflower included in
the landscaping are endangered -- some in Ohio, others throughout the United
States, others throughout the world. A handful of these plants are actually
extinct in the wild.</P>

<P>	The Gertrude MacRae McIlwain Endangered Species Garden, which was envisioned
for years by CREW researchers, has been made possible thanks to a generous
gift from Mary Ann Dodson in memory of her mother, Gertrude MacRae McIlwain.</P>

<P>	In addition to providing an attractive and naturalistic setting for
the CREW research facility and public exhibit, the garden reminds Zoo visitors
of CREW's vital research to save endangered plant and animal species. Through
signs and an educational brochure, visitors to the garden can learn about
the natural history of the plants on display, including information on what
threatens species.</P>

<P>	The garden will also serve as a tool for CREW's plant conservation research.
Plants that have germinated following freezing and thawing procedures at
CREW will be planted out to determine their general hardiness and ability
to reproduce naturally. CREW's plant research also focuses on propagating
various species with a technique called tissue culture. After plants propagated
by this method outgrow their test-tube environment, they too will be transplanted
to the garden.</P>

<P>	The Endangered Species Garden was designed by David Ehrlinger, the Zoo's
director of horticulture, and Dr. Valerie Pence, head of CREW's Plant Conservation
Division. The garden is divided into four distinct regions (woodland, prairie,
wetland and limestone outcrop), each representing a habitat in Ohio where
rare and endangered plants are found. Each habitat, accordingly, contains
a number of locally endangered species. Native trillium bloom in the woodland
area, and royal catchfly abound in the prairie region. Wild rice &shy; common
in some states but endangered in Ohio &shy; will be planted in the garden's
wetland area, and in the limestone outcrop area, the lakeside daisy resides
&shy; considered the rarest of the more than 200  species endangered in
Ohio.</P>

CREW's Animal Division Gets Jump Start</H1>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>	Within a short period of time, several projects have been initiated
in the Animal Division of the Center for Research of Endangered Wildlife
(CREW).</P>

<P>	One of the most efficient methods for conducting research with endangered
wildlife is to form collaborations and work as a team with other organizations.
 One example of this team approach is a project conducted in October, just
two weeks after my arrival at CREW. </P>

<P>	The project involved artificial insemination of scimitar-horned oryx
and was an extension of some of the work I was involved in while working
at the National Zoological Park's NOAHS organization.  During the third
week in October, 12 scimitar-horned oryx were artificially inseminated at
The Wilds in Cumberland, Ohio by a team of researchers including three scientists
from NOAHS (Drs. Steve Monfort, Barbara Wolfe and Catherine Morrow), myself
from CREW, and the research veterinarians (Drs. Evan Blumer and Mark Atkinson)
at The Wilds. </P>

<P>	Most people do not realize that the scimitar-horned oryx once ranged
throughout most of Northern Africa but recently became extinct in the wild.
 A close relative, the Arabian oryx, also became extinct in the wild approximately
30 years ago. But a reintroduction program was established in which animals
were taken from zoos in the United States and released into the wild where
they now freely roam the desert sands of Saudi Arabia. </P>

<P>	Hopefully, a similar program will repopulate Northern Africa with the
scimitar horned oryx.  Meanwhile, zoos must manage the species very carefully
so we do not lose any of the genetic variability in the captive population.
 For that reason, CREW, NOAHS and The Wilds are establishing a frozen reserve
of oryx sperm and developing artificial insemination procedures for effectively
utilizing this valuable genetic material.</P>

<P>	Another project that is already under way involves our Sumatran rhinos.
 There are approximately 400 Sumatran rhinos left in the wild and only 21
in captivity worldwide.  Historically, this species has not reproduced in
captivity.  The Cincinnati Zoo is responsible for taking care of the only
three Sumatran rhinos in the United States.  Therefore, it is essential
that CREW takes this tremendous opportunity to learn more about this critically
endangered species.  Our initial goal is to evaluate hormone levels in our
two females to determine if they are exhibiting regular reproductive cycles.
 This is the first step to understanding why reproduction has been unsuccessful
to date.</P>

<P>	CREW also is involved in studying both the white and black African rhinos
&shy; research funded through a grant from the  International Rhino Foundation.
 For this project, I am working with  approximately 15 zoological institutions
across the United States.  All of these collaborating institutions are conducting
behavioral observations and collecting samples from their rhinos for hormone
analysis.  We hope the information from this research will help us understand
rhino behavior and physiology as well as provide insight into how we can
better manage these impressive animals in captivity.</P>

CREW Volunteer Educators Make A Difference</H1>

<P>	A volunteer interpreter in the Public Exhibit pushes a wall button and
a large opaque glass window clears like magic...and 20 medical students
from Taiwan gaze in amazement at the miniature tropical rain forest in CREW's
greenhouse.  One young man exclaims excitedly in broken English, &quot;There's
the Rose Periwinkle we just learned about in the lecture!&quot;  </P>

<P>	Scenes like this occur regularly at CREW where educating the public
about conservation through scientific technology is a major goal.  Whether
it is a group of high school biology students, or visiting doctors from
Ethicon Endo-Surgery, or foreign exchange students, experienced volunteers
will eagerly interpret CREW's vital mission in hope of changing attitudes
and feelings about conserving the diversity of life.</P>

<P>	CREW's educational mission began with three volunteers giving slide
presentations in 1986. Now there are forty trained interpreters who work
in three major educational areas:  The Speakers Bureau, Public Exhibit,
and scheduled building tours.</P>

<P>	The Speakers Bureau reaches out to local, state, and adjoining state
audiences.  Three fascinating slide presentations have been scripted to
meet the needs of various age levels. The Seeds for the Future shows the
world's first test-tube gorilla and explains how this was achieved and its
importance in primate breeding.  The &quot;Science Careers&quot; program
hopes to stimulate career interest in the sciences and in conservation research.
&quot;An Evergreen World&quot; emphasizes CREW's 'world's first' successes
in plant research.  It increases public awareness of the ancient interdependence
between plants and animals, highlighting current work in the rain forest
of Trinidad and new technologies of collecting live plant specimens in vitro.
 Since last September nine volunteers have given 78 programs reaching 3,128
people.  Eleven universities and colleges were among them.</P>

<P>	CREW's Public Exhibit educates hundreds of Zoo visitors seven days a
week from Memorial Day to Labor Day and weekends during the spring and fall.
 Most folks are fascinated by a video of an actual sperm injection or the
splitting of an embryo.  They can also look into the Frozen Zoo and Garden
on the level below. </P>

<P>	The most exciting CREW educational experience is a pre-scheduled tour
through the working facility.  Through large glass walls, visitors can easily
view researchers at work as their guide explains the procedures.  In the
Plant Division, visitors might see plant tissue culture procedures in progress
or they might witness someone preparing media for new baby test tube plants.
 A common sight might be a view into the surgical suite to hear a guide
explain the fascinating procedures of egg retrieval, sperm injection or
embryo transfer.</P>

<P>	All these educational programs have been initiated and carried out by
CREW volunteers.  The very supportive and appreciative staff make it possible,
often participating in teaching programs.</P>

<P>	CREW volunteers are headed by Arlene Thorwarth, Speakers Bureau leader
is Nancy Wickemeyer, Public Exhibit volunteers are led by Jean Hodil, and
Debbie Maruffi leads the Tour Guides.  All have backgrounds in either education
or in administration.</P>

<P>	Time after time, we hear leading scientists and ecologists stress that
education is the solution to the conservation crisis, not only by teaching
facts, but changing attitudes.  Educators are as vital in saving life forms
as are scientists in the laboratory or biologists in the field.  CREW is
educating a wide variety of people in the community as well as in the labs.
 It is imperative that we do this now or education in the future will consist
of reading about the precious species that suffered extinction.</P>

CREW Continues Work</H1>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>On IVC Techniques in Trinidad</H1>

<P>	Over the past two years, the Plant Conservation Division at CREW has
worked on the development of in vitro collection or IVC -- a technique which
involves taking specially prepared vials of nutrient media into the field,
sterilizing plant pieces on site and initiating tissue cultures immediately.
Tissues are collected using several simple methods such as a hole punch
or a hypodermic needle, placed onto the sterile media and brought back to
the laboratory where they are sorted for contamination. Sterile samples
are cultured  for further growth: the goal is to then stimulate them to
produce shoots which can be rooted to form whole plants. </P>

<P>	At first the Plant Division researchers experimented with tissue samples
from CREW's greenhouse, then collected samples from different sites in the
Cincinnati area. This work paved the way for collection of tissues in the
tropical forest. Experiments using IVC tissues collected locally proved
particularly helpful in improving the technique for work in the tropical
forests where the extremely high levels of bacterial and fungal spores are
problematic for any aseptic work in the field. </P>

<P>	Since April 1994, researchers have made four trips to the Morne Catherine
Reserve, a protected rain forest site in Trinidad operated by the Centre
for the Rescue of Endangered Species of Trinidad and Tobago (CRESTT). Identification
of the tropical species collected on each IVC expedition has been provided
by the National Herbarium of Trinidad and Tobago. After being brought back
to Cincinnati the first species to regenerate fully from a tiny leaf piece
and bloom in the greenhouse at CREW was Hippobroma longiflora,  a common
roadside plant called the star flower which produced about five blooms last
August. </P>

<P>	Bacterial and fungal contaminants from collected samples are also being
studied and identified in the laboratory. The challenge of combatting the
high levels of contamination in the tropical forest can be met by incorporating
appropriate antibiotics and fungicides into the media to improve sterility.
	</P>

<P>	The hormonal stimulation of growth and regeneration of the callus into
shoots and roots is another very important aspect of IVC and work in this
area is ongoing in the lab.  </P>

<P>	IVC allows researchers to collect and culture thousands of specimens
quickly and efficiently in the field and serves as an alternative method
to collecting entire plants or waiting for a plant to go to seed. If plant
tissue collected in the field can be grown in the lab, frozen, then regenerated
as whole plants, a technique for creating frozen living collections of plant
tissues would be available. Successfully cryopreserving those cultures would
serve as a back-up for unusual or endangered species should they disappear
from their natural habitat. This is an important concern for all plants
but especially for those from the tropical forests.  So little is presently
known about the incredible diversity of rain forest plant life which is
under increasing threat of disappearance due to population pressures worldwide.<BR>

Seven Endangered U.S. Species<BR>
Targeted in IMS Funded Project</H1>

<P>	In 1995, CREW's Plant Division and  the Center for Plant Conservation
(CPC), which coordinates conservation efforts in 25 botanical gardens around
the country, received a $65,000 grant from the Institute of Museum Services
(IMS) to work on the propagation of seven highly endangered plant species.
</P>

<P>	Four of the CPC's member gardens nominated the seven species. Two, Aster
vialis, a woodland relative of cultivated asters, and Sisyrinchium sarmentosum,
a small member of the iris family native to wet meadows and prairies, come
from the Berry Botanic Garden (Portland, Oregon); another two, Primula maguirei,
a relative of cultivated primulas threatened by development and overcollecting,
and Schoencrambe suffretescens, a small member of the mustard family, come
from Red Butte Garden and Arboretum (Salt Lake City, Utah); Calamagrostis
porteri spp. insperata, a Midwestern grass known from only four populations,
is from the Missouri Botanical Garden (St. Louis, Missouri); and Asimina
tetramera and Deeringothamnus rugelii, rare relatives of the pawpaw, are
from Bok Tower Garden (Lake Wales, Florida).</P>

<P>	All of these species have been difficult or impossible to propagate
by traditional methods because they are producing few or inviable seeds.
The two-year IMS funding is providing the opportunity to examine the effectiveness
of tissue culture techniques in solving reproductive problems in these endangered
species. </P>

<P>	Using culture techniques, seeds and other tissues are isolated and placed
onto sterile medium in test tubes. These are stimulated with plant hormones
to produce shoots or embryos which can grow into whole plants.  Once plants
are obtained, they are moved out of the test tube into soil in the greenhouse
for normal growth.  The goal of this project is to produce plants which
can be returned to the collaborating botanical gardens for growth and research.
 Tissues will also be cryopreserved at CREW to maintain the culture lines
as a back-up.</P>

<P>	The capable work of research assistants Hongyi Zhang, Sudha Avasarala
and Kirsten Stewart has led to the establishment of cultures of six of the
seven species. By spring of 1996 some of these had produced complete plants
which are now growing in the greenhouse.</P>

The 80th Anniversary of the Death of the Last Passenger Pigeon
</H1></TD></TR></TABLE>

<i>by David Ehrlinger</i><p>

        On September 1, 1914 one of the most notable events in the
history of American wildlife occurred when the last passenger
pigeon died at the Cincinnati Zoo. She was called "Martha," and
evidently named for Martha Washington, the wife of the "Father"
of our country.  Martha was a famous bird in her last years and
visited by many authorities as well as multitudes of older Zoo
visitors who could then remember the huge flocks of pigeons from
many years before.  <p>

<IMG SRC="hortpix/Martha.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT>
         Passenger pigeons were one of the most remarkable 
and unique birds to ever live. Native to eastern North America, they once
were the most numerous species of bird on earth, numbering in
the billions and in dense multitudes they flew, roosted, fed,
and nested. No other bird has ever lived in such abundance. They
flew in enormous flocks that filled the sky and sometimes
extended for dozens of miles. Their nesting sites were vast,
sometimes holding all of the nesting birds from several states
in one expansive area.  These sites sometimes stretched over two
hundred square miles of forests with each individual tree
holding dozens of nests. The abundance of passenger pigeons and
their colonial nesting habits were their undoing because they
became an easy prey for commercial hunters who slaughtered them 
by the millions for city food markets in the years after the
Civil War. Unlike mourning doves, their familiar relatives,
passenger pigeons evidently required dense aggregations to
successfully breed and thrive in the wild and they could not
survive when their numbers were reduced beyond a certain level.
In the 1880s people began to notice a diminished number of wild
pigeons, but because of their former abundance this scarcity was
not taken seriously. Finally, by the 1890s it was evident to all
that passenger pigeons, as well as a number of other native
species such as bison, were threatened with extinction.  <p>

        The Cincinnati Zoo first exhibited passenger pigeons in 1876
and by 1885 fourteen birds were had been hatched in captive
broods. There are two conflicting accounts of the origins of the
last passenger pigeon, Martha, which have created confusion in
literature since. The first account is based on a letter in 1907
from the Zoo's General Manager Sol Stephan in which he wrote
that the Zoo's last female passenger pigeon was acquired from
Professor Charles Whitman of the University of Chicago in 1902
from birds reared in Wisconsin. However, from 1914 until his
death in 1949 Sol Stephan steadfastly maintained in interviews
and articles that Martha had been hatched at the Zoo in 1885.
The reasons for the discrepancy are unclear, possibly, a mistake
was made in the  identity of the last female bird by Zoo staff
prior to the 1907 correspondence. Whatever her origins, Martha
outlived all others of her species. After 1899 the Zoo had a
standing offer of $1000 to buy another pair but, the birds were
gone from the wild. The Zoo even tried to breed Martha with
other species of pigeons to no avail. Martha finally died on
September 1, 1914. Her body was preserved in ice and sent to the
Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D. C., where it remains
today. <p>

        Martha lived in one of seven aviaries, one of which still
stands across from the Cat House exit. The building has been
preserved as a museum memorial to passenger pigeons and other
extinct and endangered species. The pagoda-style aviary building
is an architectural delight and part of the original Zoo that
was constructed in 1875. It is the second oldest zoo building in
America, following the Zoo's Reptile House that was completed
earlier that same year. The next time you visit the Zoo, stop at
Martha's memorial, take a few minutes to study its displays, and
consider this wonderful species of bird that has for eighty
years now been gone from this earth. <p>

Nocturnal Adventure Program
</CENTER></H1>

<i>by <b>Dan Marsh</b>, Nocturnal Adventures Coordinator</i><p>

When Cincinnati nightlife comes to mind, you probably think of Mt. Adams, 
Over the Rhine, and the Kentucky riverfront.  But without a doubt, the 
wildest nightlife in town is at the Cincinnati Zoo. <P>

As darkness falls and the gates are locked, the party at the Zoo is just 
getting started.  Now, this is not your typical Cincinnati nightlife 
experience:  you'll find no &quot;lounge lizards&quot; here - only Komodo 
dragons.  If you are looking for a chugging contest (water only, of 
course), the elephants will give you a run for your money.   As for dancing 
til dawn, this may not be the place - although our Japanese cranes might 
oblige you if you &quot;speak&quot; the right body language.  And if you're 
looking to meet that &quot;special someone,&quot; you may be in luck; we do 
have a reputation for being the country's sexiest Zoo.  Here at the Zoo, 
you'll have a Nocturnal Adventure that will put the true &quot;wild&quot; 
back into your nightlife in a way the typical night scene can't.  Plus, 
you'll have an unforgettable experience to talk about for years to come.  <P>

     What is this happenin' nightspot?  It's the Cincinnati Zoo's Nocturnal 
Adventure program. Nocturnal Adventures is one of the Education Department's
 most unique programs: an overnight held on Zoo grounds to allow you to 
experience the Zoo in a way most people only imagine.  After dark, the Zoo 
offers sights and sounds the daytime visitor normally doesn't encounter.  A 
typical night starts with excited children pouring out of a bus.  Then, it's 
into the Education Center for an introduction and welcome from the Nocturnal 
staff, followed by a chance to meet some of our animal ambassadors for 
up-close encounters.  After that, we go out into the Zoo to explore a few of 
the animal buildings and take a sneak peak behind the scenes.  <P>

<IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="nocturnal.gif">

     After all of this activity, it's time to trek back to the Education 
Building for a break.  Next, it's time to try your hand at being a nocturnal 
animal, and participate in hands-on activities that show you just how 
nocturnal predators catch their prey and how prey animals find protection in 
the dark.  We finish up our outdoor activities with a late night hike around 
the Zoo, without flashlights, to discover the mysterious senses of nocturnal 
animals.  We'll answer questions such as, how do cats see in the dark?  How 
can a bat catch a tiny mosquito?  How do nocturnal animals &quot;talk&quot; 
to each other, and even, where do all those peacocks go after dark?  We'll 
finally call it a night back at the Education center as you snuggle down in 
your sleeping bag and watch a late video.  Wake up to the calls of peacocks 
and gibbons, breakfast served by the Nocturnal staff, and an early morning 
tour in which you officially are recognized as Nocturnal Adventurers.  <P>

     Sound like kid stuff?  Don't be too sure.  This program can be catered 
to people of all ages.  College groups, teacher organizations, and families 
have all spent the night at the Zoo.  Like all of the programs offered by the 
Education Department, Nocturnal Adventures is committed to providing quality 
experiences that develop awareness, understanding, and knowledge of our 
natural world.   However, the only way you'll really know is if you come see 
for yourself -- but don't forget to bring a flashlight!<P>

     For more information about Nocturnal Adventures call Dan Marsh at 
(513) 559-7725, or to register call Marcy Avrett at (513) 559-7767.<P>

  <H3>CHEETAHS - A RACE AGAINST EXTINCTION</H3>
  <P><BR>
  The cheetah is the fastest land animal on Earth, but is it fast enough
  to outrun extinction? In order to save the cheetah, people need to work
  together, and that requires team work and problem solving skills. Each
  participant will receive a new curriculum which inspires students to develop
  action plans to help the cheetah survive. Hands-on activities, based on
  episodes from the public radio program, the &quot;90 Second Naturalist,&quot;
  will bring a new level of interest and enthusiasm to your science classroom.
  Naturalists from the Zoo's Cat Ambassador Program will introduce participants
  to the behavior, ecology, and conservation of this magnificent cat. The
  program will be highlighted by a visit from one of the Zoo's Cat Ambassadors.
  This workshop is limited to 25 participants.<BR>

Explore the World with the 1996 Barrows Conservation Lecture Series
</CENTER></H1>



<i>by <b>Penny Geary</b>, Conservation Program Coordinator</i><p>

<h4>The Cincinnati Zoo &amp; Botanical Garden is pleased to 
announce the unparalleled lineup of guest speakers for 
the 1996 Barrows Conservation Lecture Series.  Throughout 
the year you will have the opportunity to hear first hand 
about a unique rain forest culture that has existed  for 
over two thousand years, view some of the very best 
wildlife photographs ever taken, hear the tales of one of 
the premiere birders, and spend an evening with a woman 
who has spent 25 years living with and studying the 
orangutan, &quot;man of the forest&quot;.  Breathtaking 
slides and intriguing stories await you.   Be sure to get 
your tickets and mark your calendar for the best lecture 
series in town.</H4>

<h3>Dr. David Wilke<BR>
Director of The Ituri Fund<br>
March 14, 1996</h3>
     Imagine planning your summer vacation to a remote 
region in Africa where it will take you weeks of travelling 
over gutted and washed out roads to reach your destination. 
 Dr. David Wilke and his wife Dr. Gilda Morelli do 
just that in order to study and provide assistance 
to one of the most fascinating African cultures still 
intact today.   As the first guest speaker, Wilke - 
who is a noted cultural anthropologist and Co-Director 
of the Ituri Fund - will share his intimate knowledge 
and understanding of African cultures with an in-depth 
look at the lives of the people of the Ituri Forest 
in a captivating slide presentation.<P>
     Within the northeastern corner of the Ituri Forest 
of Zaire live the Lese farmers and Efe foragers - two 
peoples that have intertwined their lives to mutually 
benefit each other.  The Lese practice the traditional 
slash-and-burn farming on the edge of the rain forest 
utilizing a small area for no more than two years. 
 The Efe set up temporary camps within the forest to 
hunt animals such as monkey and duiker and gather various 
fruits, nuts, honey and medicinal plants.   <P>
     Their seemingly simple lives are in fact full of 
challenges which require tremendous energy, strength, 
and agility.   To gather honey the Efe men climb up 
60 feet into the trees while the Efe women watch the 
movement of the river waters to catch fish with their 
bare hands.   In a symbiotic relationship the Lese 
and Efe people exchange crop foods for rain forest 
foods, thereby providing each other with needed resources. 
 These traditional practices have stood the test of 
time and, though their lives have been improved by 
the health care and education made available through 
the Ituri Fund, modern technology has yet to significantly 
alter their traditional practices and celebrations. 
 <P>
     The Ituri Fund  - started in 1987 by David Wilke 
and other concerned anthropologists and psychologists 
- provides education and health care to the Lese and 
Efe because assistance was not otherwise available 
in the extremely poor nation of Zaire.  Realizing that 
local people are the key to wildlife conservation, 
the Cincinnati Zoo became involved with the work of 
the Ituri Fund.  Supporting the health care and education 
of the Efe and Lese people will allow them to be a 
voice for the forest which has come under increasing 
pressures. A great diversity of wildlife exists within 
the Ituri Forest.  In addition to many birds, insects, 
bats and monkeys found in the forest canopy, the Ituri 
forest has many ground dwelling animals such as okapi, 
elephant, buffalo, and duikers.  Wildlife survival 
is intrinsically linked to cultural survival.  Dr. 
Wilke will not only give an inside look at the lives 
of the Lese and Efe people, but will also address what 
efforts are being made to protect the integrity of 
the forest.<P>

<H3>Frans Lanting
Wildlife Photographer<Br>
April 18, 1996	7:30 p.m.</H3>
     Award-winning photographer and naturalist, Frans 
Lanting's widely acclaimed books include &quot;Okavango: 
Africa's Last Eden,&quot; &quot;Feathers, Islands of 
the West,&quot; &quot;Madagascar: A World Out of Time,&quot; 
and &quot;Forgotten Edens.&quot;   Lanting's presentation 
on the Okavango Delta tells the miraculous story of 
a wetland oasis of more than 8,500 square miles in 
the middle of Botswana's Kalahari Desert with a richness 
and diversity of wildlife that rivals any place on 
Earth.  In a breathtaking series of photographs of 
the region's landscapes and wildlife - including leopard, 
crocodile, zebra, giraffe, hyena, impala, and elephants 
- Lanting takes you on an incredible journey to the 
Okavango Delta.  <P>

<H3>Dr. Avecita Chicch&oacute;n<br>
Conservation International, Peru Program Director<br>
June 6, 1996 	 7:30 p.m.</H3>
     Chicch&oacute;n will speak on saving the diversity 
of the Tambopata-Candamo region of Peru which borders 
Bolivia on the eastern slopes of the Andes.  This important 
area is inhabited by Amazonian indigenous groups and 
covers 1.5 million hectares of rain forest.  It also 
has Peru's highest single site species diversity with 
well over 500 bird species, 14 kinds of primates, and 
more than 1,000 butterfly species. <P>

<H3>Pete Dunne<br>
Director of the Cape May Bird Observatory<br>
August 8, 1996	7:30 p.m.</H3>
     Acclaimed nature writer, Dunne is the author of 
&quot;The Wind Masters,&quot; &quot;Tales of a Low-Rent 
Birder,&quot; &quot;More Tales of a Low-Rent Birder,&quot; 
and &quot;The Feather Quest.&quot;  Referred to as 
the second most famous birder in North America (Roger 
Tory Peterson being the first), Pete Dunne is above 
all a master story teller.  His wisdom and wit speaks 
not only of birds, but also of birdwatchers - their 
craft, their passion, their heroes, and their idiosyncrasies. 
<P>

<H3>Dr. Birute Galdikas<br>
President of the Orangutan Foundation<br>
Sept. 26, 1996 	 7:30 p.m.</H3>
     Galdikas is a dedicated primatologist and leading 
field researcher of orangutans for 25 years and author 
of &quot;Reflections of Eden.&quot;  Even blood-sucking 
leeches, swarms of carnivorous insects, and constant 
humidity could not dissuade Galdikas from her work 
as she continued her studies of these elusive red apes 
in the remote jungles of Indonesian Borneo, protecting 
them from poachers and complementing the research of 
Leakey's other two protegees: Jane Goodall and Dian 
Fossey.  Dr. Birute Galdikas will be the recipient 
of the Cincinnati Zoo's 1996 Wildlife Conservation 
Award. <P>

<h1><a href="/education/"><IMG SRC="/books-apple.jpg"
align=middle border=0></a>Angel</h1>

Angel, the cheetah ambassador of goodwill, spent her life teaching school 
children about the earth's wildlife heritage.  In her twelve years, Angel 
was seen by hundreds of thousands of children while visiting more than 
1,000 tri-state area schools.  Angel was seen on television talk shows to 
further support cheetah conservation.<p>
Upon her death in December 1992, the Cincinnati Zoo established the 
"Angel Fund" in her memory.  Those who saw and remembered Angel 
contributed sufficient funds to insure the construction of a cheetah 
breeding facility for the zoo.  The new cheetah breeding facility at Mast 
Farm in Loveland, Ohio will be expoecting its first residents in the 
spring of 1995. The Angel Fund also reaches out to the wild, where 
cheetah struggle for survival in the few areas of Africa where they 
remain.  An 18,000 acre farm in Namibia, SW Africa provides a permanent 
base of operations for the <A HREF="cc.html">Cheetah Conservation 
Fund</a> (CCF).  Co-directors 
Laurie Marker-Kraus and Danial Kraus live at the farm, "Eland's Joy".  
Recognizing the important part that humans now play in the survival of the 
cheetah, CCF is working to promote a greater understanding of the role 
the cheetah plays in a healthy ecosystem.  <p>
The Angel Fund, a project that truly supports this critically endangered 
cat, is set up to continue its vital role in cheetah conservation, both 
captive and wild, well into the 21st century.

educational assemblies.<p>
Available to all age groups except Preschool.  Programs are available 
September through mid-April, Monday-Fridays and evenings by special 
arrangement.  The cost is $225.00 per class or assembly and $50.00 for 
each additonal assembly on the same day.  A mileage fee of 30 cents per 
mile will be charged for any distance over 20 miles.  Non-school or 
evening programs are $325.00 (as of fall, 1996). <p>

The Asian elephant once ranged from Mesopotamia (now known as Iraq) throughout Asia, south of the Himalayas all the way to Northern China.  Today, Asian elephants are found scattered only in isolated pockets of India, Nepal, Sumatra, and Southern Asia.

</P>

<BR>

<H3>Not All Elephants Look Alike</H3>

<P>

Elephants are the largest land mammals in the world today.  There are two species of elephants: the Asian and the African.  When the two are together, it is quite easy to tell them apart.  The Asian elephant is usually smaller than the African and has considerably smaller ears.  It also has smoother skin and less prominent tusks.  Another difference between the two is the trunk.  The African elephant has two "lips" on the end of its trunk to grasp food and other items it needs to pick up, while the Asian elephant relies on only one "lip."

</P>

<TABLE>

<TR ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP>

<TH WIDTH=299><IMG SRC="asian_elephant.gif"></TH>

<TH WIDTH=301><H3>The Vanishing Elephant</H3>

<P>

You may think an elephant is too big just to disappear, but for centuries the Asian elephant has been overhunted for its ivory tusks that are traded to the Far East.  The ivory is used for carvings, jewelry, and statues.  Today, Asian elephants are in even greater danger of extinction because of loss of their natural habitat.  Only an estimated 29,000 to 40,000 still remain in the wild, while field studies show that there are still half a million African elephants.  

</P></TH>

</TABLE>

<BR>

<H3>Not Just Elephants.....</H3>

<P>       

Suffer from poaching.  Don't let your family or friends buy products made from animals or plants that are endangered or exploited - no ivory, furs, reptile skins or tortoise shells, and not even tuna fish unless it has a dolphin-free label.  Remember that all living things, from elephants to grasshoppers, have value, dignity, and a reason for being here.

</P>

<BR>

<H3>Elephant Record Breakers</H3>

<P>

Elephants have the largest ears, legs, feet, teeth and noses in the world.  Bull African elephants can weigh over 12,000 pounds.

</P>

<P>

The trunk of an elephant doesn't have any bones in it, yet it is one of the strongest appendages possessed by any animal.  Working by the use of over 30,000 inter-connecting muscles and tendons, the trunk is strong enough to pick up giant logs and drag them through the forest, while being so sensitive it can pick up a coin or peanut off the ground.

</P>

<P>

The tusks are elongated upper incisor teeth which, on a bull African elephant, can weigh as much as 200 pounds each!   These giant teeth allow the elephants to dig into and completely knock over trees in search of moisture and food.

<STRONG>

<H3>Who Was That Banded Critter?</H3>

<P>

The banded linsang, a resident of the Indonesian rain forest, is a very secretive and elusive animal.  It is one of the rarest and least known of the civets, a group of animals in the mongoose family.  Civets share many traits with the cats, and may closely resemble the extinct ancestor of all cats, from our house cat to the tiger.  The linsang is the most catlike of all the civets.  Its claws are retractable, like those of cats, in order to keep them sharp. 

</P>



<P>

Linsangs live solitary lives.  Young females stay with their mothers until they are mature, but males are on their own soon after they are weaned.  Linsangs are also semi-arboreal (tree dwelling) and nocturnal.  They sleep in leaf- and stick-lined nests under roots or logs and in trees during the day, emerging to hunt through the trees at night.

</P>



<CENTER><IMG SRC="banded_linsang.gif"></CENTER>

<H3>A Snake With Fur</H3>

<P>

Linsangs are very long and slender with short legs and long noses.  They are built perfectly for hunting in trees and small places and what hunters they are!  With razor-sharp incisors and long canines, linsangs eat mainly small vertebrates like squirrels, rats, birds and lizards.  These prey are all very fast and alert, so how does the linsang catch them?  Its long tail serves this graceful animal as a balancing pole in its treetop home.  It moves almost like a snake, sliding along close to the ground or branch, then waiting in ambush, using its camouflage and speed to catch its dinner.

</P>



<H3>Vanishing Homeland</H3>

<P>

The banded linsang is only one of thousands of plants and animals that live in the rain forests of the world.  Most of these are found only in the rain forest, so when it disappears, they will, too.  It is hard to think about places as far away as the rain forests of South America or Indonesia, but they are closer than you think.  The rain forests are responsible for an endless list of products which we use everyday, including such things as medicines, wood for furniture, rubber for your Reeboks, citrus fruits and even chocolate.  Without the rain forests, all these things will be gone, too.  But don't despair, you can help save the rain forests by recycling and by learning all you can about the environment and how you can help save it.

</P>

<STRONG><P>

The black rhinoceros could once be found in Africa, south of the Sahara Desert, in bush country, grasslands and open forests.   However, due to poaching, they now are found only in small isolated populations, the two largest being in Tanzania and Zimbabwe.

</P>

<TH WIDTH=350><H3>The Rhino's Biggest Enemy</H3>

<P>

The rhino's most distinguishing feature may very well be the cause of its extinction.  Their horn has been prized for many years by traditional Eastern cultures.  It has been carved into daggers and also ground into powder that is thought to have healing powers.  No other large mammal has been as devastated by poaching.  Once the most numerous of all rhino species, the black rhino has been the target of the greatest hunting pressure of all.  In 1970 the world population of black rhinos was 65,000.  By 1980 it dropped to 15,000, and today it is thought that fewer than 3,000 black rhinos remain.  Most of those illegal rhino horns were shipped to the tiny country of North Yemen, where they were fashioned into the handles of daggers and other trinkets.

</P></TH>

<TR>

</TABLE>



<BR>



<H3>When is a Horn </H3>

<H3>Not Really a Horn?</H3>

<P>

The name "rhinoceros" is derived from the distinctive horn on the animal's snout.  Unlike the horns of cattle, sheep and antelope, the rhino's horn does not have a bony core; instead it is made of the same keratin protein fibers that make up horses' hooves and our own fingernails.  The black rhino, white rhino, and  Sumatran rhino all have two horns protruding from the end of their noses, while the other two species of rhino, the Indian and Javan, have only one.  The black rhino, unlike the other species, has a prehensile upper lip for grasping food.  This type of lip allows the animal to increase the amount of food it gathers per bite from woody plants.   Black rhinos have a reputation for unprovoked aggression, but very often their charges are bluffs designed to get rid of any intruder.  But anyone who has been on an African safari knows never to provoke a rhinoceros.  They are huge animals which can run over 30 m.p.h. and will forcefully chase off threats to themselves and their young. 

</P>

<BR>

<H3>Species Survival Plan</H3>

<P>

The Cincinnati Zoo is the leader in an international effort to save the black rhinoceros.  As they are being wiped out in Africa, it is more important than ever to breed these endangered animals in captivity.  So zoos around the world are cooperating in the Species Survival Plan(SSP)  in order to maximize the rhino's chances.   Under this plan zoo researchers study the genetics of captive rhinos and then make sure the best pairs are mated to insure long-term survival, in zoos and back in the wild.  Dr. Edward Maruska, Executive Director of the Cincinnati Zoo, is Chairman of the Black Rhino SSP.

<STRONG>

<P>

The clouded leopard is about the size of a Labrador retriever and can be found living in southern China, Indonesia and parts of Southeast Asia.  It has a long body, relatively short legs, and a tail that can be almost equal in length to its head and body combined.  This cat's coat is unique, ranging from dark brown to yellow, marked with elongated, irregular, cloudy blotches of darker shades.  The tail is very thick and is encircled with black rings.

</P>



<TABLE>

<TR ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP>

<TH WIDTH=300><IMG SRC="clouded_leopard.gif"></TH>

<TH WIDTH=300><H3>Modern-Day Saber-tooth</H3>

<P>

Because of its large upper teeth, which are relatively longer than in any other cat species, the clouded leopard is sometimes referred to as the "modern-day saber-tooth."   The name for this cat in Malay is "rimaudahan" which means "tree tiger," derived from its habits of sleeping in trees as well as laying in wait from above for prey to pass by.

</P>

</TH>

</TABLE>



<H3>Too High a Price To Pay</H3>

<P>

The clouded leopard has been persecuted for its coat for many years.  Because of the unique pattern, many people desire coats made of this beautiful fur.  Unfortunately it takes about 20 to 30 cats to make one full-length coat.  However, lately it seems that more and more people are beginning to realize that these furs do look better on the animals themselves.   Hopefully, soon these animals will no longer have to worry about losing their furs.  

</P>

<P>

Clouded leopards are rain forest creatures and depend upon the forest and its intricate web of plants and animals for survival.  As the jungles go, so do the clouded leopards.  But saving the rain forests isn't just about saving leopards, parrots or pythons.  It's really about saving ourselves.  Because as the forests go, so do we.

</P>

<TH WIDTH=300><H3>Largest Antelope</H3>

<P>

The giant eland derives its name from the fact that it is the largest of all antelopes.  Unlike many hoofed animals, both the males and females have long spiral horns, used in food gathering as well as for competition with other giant eland.  Primarily a woodland species, it is found in small populations in Western and Central Africa, and in slightly more stable populations in Eastern Africa.  During most of the year males and females live separately in small herds.  However, during the mating season eland will group by the hundreds.  

</P>

</TH>

<TH WIDTH=300><IMG SRC="giant_eland.gif"></TH>

</TABLE>

<P>

The giant eland is also known as the Lord Derby Eland, named after E.S. Stanley, the 13th Earl of Derby and President of the Zoological Society of London in 1831.

</P>

<H3>Domestic Elands</H3>

<P>

Domesticating elands can be beneficial in many ways.  In Africa, elands can produce milk and meat at a better price than cattle.  Also, herds of elands are kinder to the environment than cattle, which can graze the land to desert.  The Masai people of the Serengeti have kept herds of eland for centuries, principally for their blood, with hardly any ill effect on the environment.

The Cincinnati Zoo's Center for Reproduction of Endangered Wildlife (C.R.E.W) has had great success since its establishment in 1981, working with a variety of wild animals.  Elands have been used in a procedure called embryo transfer, which involves placing a fertilized egg of one animal into a surrogate mother.  As with domestic cattle and sheep, embryo transfers can help increase the number of births of wild animals.

<STRONG>

<P>

While cheetahs are found in many parts of Africa in small numbers, the king cheetah is found only in southern Africa, in the countries of Botswana, Zimbabwe and South Africa.

</P>

<H3>What is a King Cheetah?</H3>

<P>

Once considered a separate species, this rare color variant is quite distinct from the normal cheetah.  In many animals, color variations are common, but cheetahs are genetically very similar, and most look almost identical.  That's what makes the king cheetah so special.  In fact, the king cheetahs at the Cincinnati Zoo were the very first ever displayed in the United States.

</P>

<P>

The main difference between the two cheetahs is the coat pattern, much like the difference between a tabby cat and a calico.  The cheetah is generally a yellowish or buff color with black spots, while the king cheetah's spots run together to form black stripes down its back, with large irregular blotches on its sides.  The king cheetah's hair is also longer and his spots stand out more because the hair is set at a different angle from the background hair.   King cheetahs generally are also larger than normal cheetahs.

</P>

<CENTER><IMG SRC="king_cheetah.gif"></CENTER>

<H3>The Disappearing Spots</H3>

<P>

Cheetahs were once numerous across Africa, Asia, and the Middle East.  Today they are considered endangered throughout their African range and probably extinct in most of their 	                                                       former Asian and Middle Eastern range.  The fur trade has been a major factor in the cheetah's decline, along with great habitat loss and its persecution as a pest.  During the "cat fur boom" of the late 1960's, cheetah furs were used to make coats, shoes, handbags, and wallets.   As many as 3,000 to 5,000 cheetah skins were brought into the United States each year.   Fortunately, today that trade has stopped.  Over 100 nations have signed an agreement called the Convention on International Trade of Endangered Species (CITES), banning the sale of endangered  plant and animal species and products made from them.  

</P>

<H3>Feline Sprinters</H3>

<P>

The cheetah's feet are unlike any other cats,  for they do not have retractable claws, much like the dog.  In fact, the king cheetah's native name, nsuifisi, means "hyena-leopard," for the natives thought it to be a cross between the hyena, which is dog-like, and the leopard.  The cheetah is the fastest land animal, reaching speeds of up to 70 m.p.h., but for all his tremendous speed the cheetah has one serious shortcoming: his lack of endurance.  He is a sprinter, not a long-distance runner.  If his chase for food lasts more than three hundred yards, he literally runs out of steam.

</P>

<H3>How Did the King Get His Spots?</H3>

<P>

Cheetahs who are normal-colored, but have the king cheetah gene, can produce king cheetah cubs, because parents who carry both the normal-colored gene and the king gene can give either to their babies.  The king gene is recessive, or hidden, so only the offspring who receive it from both parents will be king cheetahs.

</P>

What A Great Ape!

The gorilla is the largest living primate, weighing up to 500 pounds.  But not all gorillas are such giants; the males are almost twice as large as the females.  Gorillas are one of the four apes.  The others are the orangutan, the chimpanzee and the gibbons, which are sometimes called "lesser apes."  Humans can also be called a great ape.  In fact, some scientists believe gorillas and chimps are more closely related to humans than to orangutans.   Also, like chimps, gorillas are considered to be very intelligent and some have even learned sign language.



There are three races of gorillas - eastern and western lowland, and mountain gorillas.  The Cincinnati Zoo has western lowland gorillas.   What separates the western from the eastern lowland gorillas is the Zaire River, formerly called the Congo.  The reason: unlike people, gorillas don't swim.  Mountain gorillas live in the central African country of Rwanda and have longer hair than the lowland gorillas, especially on the arms.   All three races are in danger of extinction.

<TH WIDTH=300><H3>The Gentle Giants</H3>

<P>Contrary to rumors that they are ferocious creatures, gorillas are actually very gentle and docile.  Tourists 	          often get as close as several meters to wild gorillas.  The only time they are aggressive is when 	                they are protecting their family groups.

These groups often consist of one fully adult male called the silverback, five to ten females that he protects, and their young offspring.  The silverback plays a very important role in the group, not only as protector, but also as the key link among the females.  You see, young females leave their family when they mature, so all the adult females in a group are unrelated.  It is their common link to the silverback that keeps them together.

<H3>What You Can Do....</H3>

<P>

Have your class or family rent the video "Gorillas in the Mist."  It is about the work of Dian Fossey to save the mountain gorillas.  Discuss gorillas and conservation with your class, and, once you're informed about the issues, make your views known.  Letters to our congressional representatives, the editor of the newspaper and corporate executives can influence those in power and promote public debate.

</P>

<BR>

<H3>Come See the Gorillas</H3>

The primary threats to gorillas are deforestation and poaching.  Poaching has been especially devastating, because hunters are often interested in live babies.  By the time one live baby gorilla reaches the traders, at least two others have died in transport and several adults have died trying to protect it.  Recently, though, gorillas have started to become a success story, because parts of Africa have finally realized that a live gorilla is not only more beautiful than a dead one, it is more valuable.  Many tourists visit Africa every year just to catch a glimpse of live, wild gorillas.  Tourism is more profitable than poaching, so gorillas are starting to receive the protection they deserve.  Local people are now involved in protecting the gorillas and their habitat because they realize that without the forest, there would be no gorillas, and without the gorillas, there would be no tourists.  And so on.

<TH WIDTH=300><H3>The Forest Giraffe</H3>

<P>When the okapi was first discovered, people thought it was a type of horse or zebra, but when they looked closer they realized it was related to the giraffe.  Both giraffes and okapis have skin-covered horns (on males only), lobed canine teeth, and an extendible long, blackish tongue that they use to grab leaves.  The main difference between them is where they live--giraffes live in a wide range on the open savannahs of Africa, while okapis are found only in the rain forests of Northern Zaire.  Hence, their name "forest giraffe."</P></TH>

<TH WIDTH=300><IMG SRC="okapi.gif"></TH>

</TABLE>

<H3>A Well-Kept Secret</H3>

<P>Until l90l, when British explorer Sir Henry Johnston became interested in rumors of a horse-like animal being hunted by pygmies in the Belgian Congo, no westerners had ever heard of an okapi.  Even the pygmies found them elusive, so their meat was highly prized.  Since their discovery, we still don't know much about the shy, secretive okapi.  We do know that they are solitary animals, and that males are territorial, using glands on their feet to mark their territory.  Females are very protective of their calves and will kick to fend off leopards, the animal's primary predators.  Young calves stay close to their mothers, using vocalizations and mom's zebra-striped haunches to find and follow her.</P>

<H3>Supply and Demand</H3>

<P>Although it works well with human-made products, supply and demand can be devastating to wild animals.  The less common an animal is in the wild, the more money a collector will pay for it or, even worse, its body parts.  Because of their rarity, many live okapis were exported from Africa by collectors.  However, because transportation was bad, only one out of ten survived.  This practice depleted the wild population and endangered an already rare animal.  But people acted quickly; transportation and captive environments improved, so more okapis survived in captivity and fewer were taken from the wild.  Since l933, okapis have been protected by law in Zaire, and successful captive breeding makes their future look brighter.  Today, very few of the animals you see in zoos are taken out of the wild.  Every attempt is made to help increase the populations through breeding, especially of endangered species.</P>

<H3>The Ghosts of Madagascar</H3>

<P>Lemurs might be called the ghosts of Madagascar; after all, the name "lemur" is the Latin word for ghost.  Lemurs are primitive primates found only on the island of Madagascar, today known as the Malagasy Republic.   They have a habit of sunning themselves early in the morning, and because of this, they were once protected as holy sun worshippers embodying the souls of native ancestors.  Since the arrival of civilization, lemurs have lost this protection and are gravely endangered by the destruction of nine-tenths of Madagascar's forests.</P>

<P>Since Madagascar is an island, lemurs have evolved in many forms with little outside competition.  The ruffed lemur is one of the larger species of lemurs, and can weigh up to 11 pounds.  Its coat is so dense that it sheds water even during a heavy downpour, which is handy for life in the rain forest.  The hair is also used to line the nest which the female makes for her young.  Ruffed lemurs can be either black-and-white or black-and-red.  The males and the females are usually about the same size.  Like most lemurs, they are very active and agile in trees, where their loud calls can often be heard.</P>

<TABLE>

<TR ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP>

<TH WIDTH=300><IMG SRC="ruffed_lemur.gif"></TH>

<TH WIDTH=300><H3>A Tell-Tale Smell</H3>

<P>Like many mammals, lemurs have a much better sense of smell than we do.  But they don't just use their noses for finding plants to eat in the jungle.  They use their sense of smell as a means of communication by marking branches of trees or even each other with their scents.  Primatologists, scientists who study primate behavior, believe that the lemurs communicate different messages with different scents.  Some are to protect a territory and keep competing lemurs out, while other smells may be to attract the attention of mates.</P></TH></TABLE>

<P>Lemurs don't talk only with their smells; in fact, ruffed lemurs can be one of the noisiest mammals in the world.  They use loud calls to draw attention to possible sources of danger and to maintain spacing between groups.</P>

<TH WIDTH=300><H3>A Whale of a Bird</H3>

<P>The shoebill stork, also known as the whale-headed stork,  stands 
about four feet tall and has an eight-inch beak which is almost as wide 
as it is long. It is a very large, slow-moving bird and is usually found 
alone or in pairs.  Its large bill is an 
adaptation that helps it feed on its favorite foods, which include 
lungfish, frogs, young turtles, and even small mammals and birds.   When 
feeding, it stands with its bill pointed down, its neck and wings 
outstretched.  Then it hurls itself downward and 
grabs its prey, parting the thick vegetation with its massive bill.  The 
prey is then ground apart by a scissoring action of the jaws, and any 
vegetation that was picked up is spit out. </P>

<TH WIDTH=300><IMG SRC="stork.jpg"></TH>

</TABLE>

<H3>Big Foot</H3>

<P>The shoebill stork has huge feet, built for walking on the matted reeds of their swampy home.  In fact they are the largest feet of any of the 9000 species of birds.  Its seven-inch-long toes help distribute its weight evenly as it tramps along in sear
ch of fish and other delectable treats.  As a result, shoebill storks are most often described as ungainly birds, moving slowly over the wetlands.</P>

<h3>The Loss of a Giant</H3>

<P>Like many highly specialized large birds which require special habitats, the shoebill stork is quickly becoming low in numbers.  While the species is not persecuted directly by people, the drainage of wetlands and disturbance by cattle and people have 
caused its numbers to drastically decrease.  It is thought that only 1,000 to 2,000 birds still remain in the African wild.</P>

<H3>Where in the World is The Shoebill Stork?</H3>

<P>The shoebill stork can be found in central East Africa, principally in the papyrus swamps of Uganda. It is a very shy bird and usually keeps its distance from humans.</P>

<P>Spectacled bears get their name from the light-colored rings around their eyes that sometimes resemble eye-glasses.  These markings can vary from bear to bear; however, most of the bear's markings are similar to a pair of glasses.   The rest of the bear's coat is black and is somewhat shaggy.  Adult spectacled bears can weigh from 175 to 275 pounds and can stand about two-and-a-half feet at the shoulder when on all fours. </P>

<H3>The Family of Bears </H3>

<P>There are eight species of bears in all, varying widely in size and range.  The spectacled bear, unlike the rest of the bear family, has only 13 pairs of ribs--the others have 14 pairs.</P></TH>

<H3>Range</H3>

<P>The spectacled bear is the only species of bear from South America.  Today they are found mostly in the Andes Mountains from Venezuela to Chile. In small populations, spectacled bears can be found from the coastal deserts at 600 feet, all the way up to 13,800 feet at the snow line.  Some spectacled bears have also been found in Colombia and Bolivia.</P>

<H3>A Home for Bears</H3>

<P>The major problem facing the spectacled bear is loss of habitat.  Although it is hard to estimate how many bears there are, it is thought that as few as 2,000 remain in the wild. The lowlands and foothills where the bears were once found in abundance have long  been taken over by people for agriculture.  However, this land can no longer support all of the people, so now farmers are moving into the last wilderness strongholds, destroying both the forest and the bears as they clear the land.   Sometimes the bears and the farmers don't get along, since the spectacled bear is mainly a vegetarian. They have been known to raid a farmer's corn crops, eating up to half of the crop in a single night.</P>

<P>Around the world habitat loss is the main problem facing endangered species.  Today conservationists work closely with local residents and farmers to strike a balance between human and wild needs.</P>

<TH WIDTH=300><P>Walruses live only in arctic waters of the far north, but there are two different populations - one in the Pacific Ocean and the other in the Atlantic Ocean.M</P>

<H3>Hunting Was Not the Problem</H3>

<P>For many hundreds of years native peoples hunted walruses for food, clothing, and shelter, generally never killing more than they needed for their families to survive.  But European and North American hunters have killed walruses for commercial uses since the early 17th century, primarily for their ivory tusks.  Like whales, they were also hunted for blubber that is used to make oil.  As a result of overhunting, the world walrus population was decimated by the early 1900's.</P>

<TH WIDTH=300><IMG SRC="walrus.gif"></TH>

</TABLE>

<H3>Protection Acts Do Work</H3>

<P>The United States' Marine Mammal Protection Act, which prohibits the import and sale of walrus products, has helped the species make a comeback.  The Pacific population has increased from 100,000 in 1950 to 233,000 in 1989.  The Atlantic population, although not as plentiful, has increased to 25,000.  The United States is not alone in its fight to save the walrus.  Canada, the Soviet Union and Greenland also have policies that protect the species.  Today, only Alaskan natives who have traditionally hunted walrus for food and clothing are allowed to continue their hunt, on a very limited basis.</P>

<H3>Food-Gathering

Moustache</H3>

<P>Walruses have about 450 coarse whiskers on their snout.  Called vibrissae, these whiskers are very sensitive and are used to find food in dark water.  A walrus can even use its whiskers to pick up food off the bottom and maneuver it into its mouth.</P>

<H3>Can You Make A Walrus Blush?</H3>

<P>You might on a hot day!  Walruses blush to keep their cool, not when they lose it.  The skin becomes filled with blood so heat can be released from the surface.  This makes the walrus' skin redder than usual.  It works in all kinds of weather.  They need to be able to automatically adjust their blood flow to the surface of their skin so they can survive a life of extreme temperatures.  In the very cold weather up in the Arctic Circle, walruses can lower their loss of body heat by reducing the flow of blood to their skin. </P>

<P><B>*Insect World</B> (Available on Tuesdays and Wednesdays) <I>Meet your
guide at Insect World at 10:00 a.m.</I> While walking through the award-winning
Insect World, students examine the incredible physical and behavioral adaptations
of this misunderstood group while learning that insects are vitally important
to our personal lives. (A live insect demonstration is included!) </P>

<P><B>*Bats</B>-The Flying Mammals (Available Monday through Friday) <I>Held
in the Education Building - Parking Lot Level.</I> Flying mammals! Of course!

animals. A slide presentation will feature many bat species that share the
planet with us.</P>

<P></P>

<P><B>*Horticulture Tour </B>(Available Thursdays beginning at 10:00 a.m.)
<I>Meet your guide in front of Education Building - Parking Lot Level.</I>
How do plants survive droughts, floods, and browsing animals? What adaptations
have plants made to attract pollinators and seed dispersers? Tour the Zoo
to learn about the relationships plants have with animals and their environment.
Tours are for groups up to <B>50 students</B>. (Slide presentations will
replace walking tours during inclement weather.)</P>

<P><B>*Zoo Careers! </B>(Available Monday, Tuesday, and Friday) <I>Held

Monday, Tuesday, and Friday) <I>Held in Education Building - Parking Lot
Level.</I> &quot;Running out of time&quot; is a frequent problem in our
daily lives. However, &quot;Running Out of Time&quot; for wild animals quite
literally means they are losing the race for survival. This program explores
some of the problems and many of the solutions to help them win the race
against extinction. The first program in the series focuses on <B>Cheetahs</B>
and their race for survival. We add the program <B>Rhinos</B> in January
1997. </P>

<P></P>

<P>Enter a world long kept in the dark: the Zoo at night. Nocturnal Adventures,
the Zoo's overnight program, will show you what most Zoo visitors only imagine.
Tour with trained naturalists who will interpret the nocturnal activities
of our Zoo residents, and experience the sights and sounds that most Zoo
visitors miss. This special program is available six days a week (Mon.-Sat.),
January through mid-November, at a cost of $20.00 per person.</P>

<P><IMG SRC="crewlogo.jpg" WIDTH="161" HEIGHT="217" ALIGN="LEFT" NATURALSIZEFLAG=
"3">Your adventure begins at 7:00 p.m. at the Education Building. Then you
are off on a special tour and a sneak peek behind-the-scenes. Back to the
Education Building for a quick break to refuel with a snack that you've
packed. After your break, you will have close encounters with a few of the
Zoo's animal ambassadors. Games and a late night hike through the Zoo will
prepare you to settle down in your sleeping bag to watch a video of the
groups' selection. Rise and shine to the sound of peacock calls, pack your
belongings into your vehicles, and enjoy a complimentary breakfast. Complete
your program with an early morning guided hike through the Zoo. The program
ends at 9:00 a.m., but your group is welcome to stay and enjoy our Zoo for
the remainder of the day.</P>

<P></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#FF1A09">Experience the WILDEST night life in town!</FONT></B></P>

<P>Nocturnal Adventures now offers two programs! Our old standby - &quot;Creatures
of the Night&quot; - features the nocturnal adaptations of the animal world.
We recommend this program for younger audiences due to its more focused
theme.</P>

<P></P>

<P><IMG SRC="Puffin.gif" WIDTH="50" HEIGHT="48" ALIGN="LEFT" NATURALSIZEFLAG=

wildlife program entitled - &quot;A Last Look: Endangered Wildlife.&quot;
This program lends itself to group discussions of the factors that lead
to the endangerment of the world's wild animals and plants. We will also
give your students ideas for positive action on the behalf of wildlife.</P>

the Cincinnati Zoo can bring them right to your school! The &quot;Wings
of Wonder&quot; program is offered to tri-state schools by the Education
Department of the Cincinnati Zoo. This program features birds from around
the world: parrots, macaws, birds of prey, a kookaburra, and maybe a surprise
or two. This is a 45-minute program that can be geared toward all age groups
(K-12), and can be easily adapted to classroom or school assembly presentations.</P>

<P>Education staff from the Zoo will interpret our birds' behaviors, explain
their role in the environment, and give your students ideas of what they
can do to help endangered species everywhere.</P>

<P></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#FF1A09">WHEN &amp; COSTS</FONT></B><BR>
&quot;Wings of Wonder&quot; is available Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday,
from November 1996, to April 1, 1997, at a cost of $200.00 per session,
and $100.00 for each additional class or assembly on the same day. Weekend,
evening, and non-school programs are also available by special arrangement
at a cost of $600.00 per program. A mileage fee of 30 cents per mile will

The Cincinnati Zoo is the only zoo in the country to offer students the
unique and thrilling experience of having leash-trained cats right in their

yet are disappearing today.</P>

<P>This program enables students to see endangered predators up close, without
bars, and provides a chance for them to interact with a Zoo naturalist to
learn about these animals. This 45-minute program brings 3 of the following
cats to your school: cheetah, cougar, serval, ocelot, caracal, and tigers
when available. The program is available for classroom or educational assemblies.</P>

also be charged for any distance over 20 miles. Non-school or evening programs
are $350.00.</P>

<P><B>Special Consideration:<BR>
</B>Every effort will be made to insure that students have the opportunity
to see the cats up close. However, due to the nature of wild cats, students
will not be permitted to &quot;pet&quot; our animals. </P>

<P>The Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Garden is proud to introduce a new program
for teachers - The &quot;ZOO INSTITUTE.&quot; During the 1996-1997 school
year, the Zoo will present a series of teacher workshops on varied topics
from rain forests to wild cats; from hands-on science to environmental education.
Each session will be informative, inspirational, and provide some of the
best educational resources and materials available to all who attend. The
Zoo will partner with other conservation organizations to insure that teachers
receive the most up-to-date and useful information. Partnerships include
The National Geographic Society, The Ohio Division of Wildlife, and The
World Wildlife Fund.</P>

<P>As a &quot;Window on the Wild,&quot; the Cincinnati Zoo offers an outstanding
setting for science discovery that will benefit both you and your students.
The Zoo Institute for Teachers will highlight how the Zoo's unique resources

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#FF1A09" SIZE=+1>Exploring a World of Habitats<BR>
September 21, 1996<BR>
</FONT></B><IMG SRC="ngeo.gif" WIDTH="200" HEIGHT="77" ALIGN="RIGHT" NATURALSIZEFLAG=
"3">The Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Garden, <B>The National Geographic
Society</B>, and the Ohio Geographic Alliance team up to provide an incredible
opportunity to explore a world of HABITATS. <B>Mr. Gilbert Grosvenor</B>,
President and Chairman of the National Geographic Society, will give the
opening address. This will be followed by a full-day of presentations by
Zoo and National Geographic speakers. Kindergarten through eighth grade
teaching ideas, hands-on activities, cross curriculum lesson plans, and
an abundance of free materials are all included.</P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#FF1A09" SIZE=+1>A Journey Through the Rain Forest<BR>
January 18, 1997</FONT></B><BR>
<IMG SRC="ohiogeo.gif" WIDTH="200" HEIGHT="200" ALIGN="RIGHT" NATURALSIZEFLAG=
"3">This five-hour workshop will provide a new perspective into the lives
of the plants, animals, and people of the rain forest of Zaire. Based on
the children's book by Mark and David Jenike, A Walk Through the Rain Forest,
this experience will enable you to share the excitement of rain forest diversity
with your students, and explore their role in preserving rain forests for
the future. Expect a visit from some of the Zoo's rain forest friends. This
workshop will be limited to 20 participants.</P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#FF1A09" SIZE=+1>The Zebra Mussel Connection<BR>
November 2, 1996</FONT></B><BR>
Educators! This is your chance to learn all there is to know about aquatic
ecosystems and the animals and plants that call them home. This workshop
will introduce a new educator resource that is available for use in your
classroom. The &quot;Zebra Mussel Traveling Trunk&quot; is packed full of
hands-on activities and lesson plans that are multi-disciplined while introducing
learners to one of our more bothersome alien species - the Zebra Mussel.
The &quot;Zebra Mussel Traveling Trunk&quot; was created by the Indiana-Illinois
Sea Grant for use in fifth and sixth grade classrooms, but can easily be
adapted to younger or older groups. As a personal challenge to all attendees
of the workshop, I (Dave Jenike) will personally buy a bowl of clam chowder
for the first teacher who can use all the resources in the ZMTT. Come join
the fun and learn what you and your students can do to improve water quality
and halt the spread of introduced species such as the Zebra Mussel.</P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#FF1A09" SIZE=+1>Go Wild!<BR>
November 9, 1996 (Fall) and March 15, 1997 (Spring)</FONT></B><BR>
This workshop provides teachers and scout leaders with hands-on activities
designed to stimulate student interest in nature. Participants will receive
the nationally-acclaimed and user-friendly Project Wild and Aquatic Project
Wild guides, as well as other educational and informative materials. The
workshop is limited to 30 participants.</P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#FF1A09" SIZE=+1>WOW - Windows on the Wild<BR>
October 19 and 26, 1996</FONT></B><BR>
The &quot;Windows on the Wild&quot; workshop is the result of a unique collaboration
between the Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Garden and the World Wildlife Fund
(WWF). WOW is all about biodiversity. This two-day seminar for middle school
teachers will introduce participants to the amazing diversity of life on
Earth and help them learn about the causes and consequences of biodiversity
loss. The seminar will be a combination of introductory lectures, hands-on
activities, and field experiences. Participants will be selected as a team
(minimum of three teachers or administrators from each school) and will
be expected to implement a biodiversity program in their school. All participants
will receive biodiversity education materials developed by the WWF and the
Zoo.</P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#FF1A09" SIZE=+1>Cheetahs - A Race Against Extinction<BR>
April 12, 1997</FONT></B><BR>
The Cheetah is the fastest land animal on Earth, but is it fast enough to
outrun extinction? In order to save the cheetah, people need to work together,
and that requires team work and problem solving skills. Each participant
will receive a new curriculum which inspires students to develop action
plans to help the cheetah survive. Hands-on activities, based on episodes
from the public radio program, the &quot;90 Second Naturalist,&quot; will
bring a new level of interest and enthusiasm to your science classroom.
Naturalists from the Zoo's Cat Ambassador Program will introduce participants
to the behavior, ecology, and conservation of this magnificent cat. The
program will be highlighted by a visit from one of the Zoo's Cat Ambassadors.</P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#FF1A09" SIZE=+1>Get Wet!<BR>
March 8, 1997</FONT></B><BR>
Are you anxious to add a little &quot;splash&quot; to your water curriculum?
Then &quot;Project Wet&quot; (or Water Education for Teachers) is for you!
This national program is designed to introduce the scientific, social, and
cultural aspects of water to K-12th grade students. Workshop participants
will receive a booklet containing 90+ water-related activities that are
hands-on, easy-to-use, and fun! The workshop is limited to 30 participants.</P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#FF1A09" SIZE=+1>Bald Eagle - A True American Success
Story<BR>
May 3, 1997</FONT></B><BR>
There is no species in this country that better signifies a hopeful sign
for nature than the bald eagle. Their recovery has been impressive. But
as it is with all environmental issues, there are no final chapters - only
future challenges. At the Zoo's new Bald Eagle Eyrie, participants will
learn about the behavior, ecology, and conservation of the bald eagle -
a true American success story. Each participant will receive a new curriculum
which inspires students to learn from past conservation success, and develop
action plans to ensure that the bald eagle has a future in the wild. Hands-on
activities based on episodes from the public radio program, the &quot;90
Second Naturalist,&quot; will bring a new level of interest and enthusiasm
to your science classroom.</P>

<P><P>&nbsp;<B><FONT COLOR="#FF1A09">WHO</FONT></B> - Kindergarten through
Sixth Grade.</P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#FF1A09">WHAT</FONT></B> - Five days of exciting animal
presentations, Native American storytelling, recycling, and Discovery Center
programs.</P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#FF1A09">WHERE</FONT></B> - The entire 69 acres of the
Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Garden.</P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#FF1A09">WHEN</FONT></B> - September 12, 13, 16, 17,
18 - 1996 (Thurs., Fri., Mon., Tues., and Wed.)</P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#FF1A09">WHY</FONT></B> - To enable students to share
in the beauty and wonder of the natural world, and to learn how each of
them can help protect it. </P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#FF1A09">HOW</FONT></B> - Teachers make phone reservations
Monday through Friday (9:00-5:00) by calling (513) 559-7737 and 559-7760.</P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#FF1A09">HOW MUCH</FONT></B> - $3.00 per student; paid
staff, buses, and drivers free; one adult chaperone for each 10 students
free; all other adults $3.00 each; private vehicle parking $4.50 each.
</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B>Because habitat protection is critical to the survival
of all species, $.50 of each admission fee will go to Zoo Conservation Programs
around the globe.</B></P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><HR></P>

<P>Where in the world is Harriet Habitat this year? She's up to no good
and this time she has been joined by her evil associates: Slash and Burn,
the forest destroyers. You and your students will have to follow the clues
to help us round up these environmental disasters before they can strike
again. They are threatening to chop down the trees in the wonderful new
Eagle Eyrie, where we can walk right into the exhibit with these magnificent
birds without barriers of any kind. We really need your help to stop them!</P>

<P>Your students will delight in the antics of our baby walruses, wonder
at the baby gorillas, and be amused by the young Tasmanian devils. Plus,
no one will want to miss the exciting <B>Wings of the World Exhibit</B>
(former Bird House) where puffins, penguins, and auklets abound.</P>

<P>Of course, the days are also filled with live programs by the Wings of
Wonder Bird Show; CATS! CATS! CATS!; the Elephant Show; Reptiles are Special,
Too; Rumpke Recycling; Native American Storytelling; Frisch's Discovery
Center; storytime; and much, much more. Remember, the whole Zoo is waiting
for your students to explore - and our volunteer interpreters will share
their love of the world of plants and animals with them.</P>

<P>Packets of activities will be sent to you before your expedition day
so you can use the pre-visit suggestions and then follow up with the ideas
for post-Zoo visit learning. These have been designed to meet state-mandated
requirements and to develop your students' science proficiencies.</P>

The Zoo Shops are staffed with volunteers and the profits are returned to
the Zoo. We realize that to most visitors, the trip is not complete without
a visit to the Shops. During the months when there are many school visits,
the shops become very crowded. In an effort to make school visits more enjoyable
without having to deal with the crowds, we are offering 4 pre-made souvenir
bags. The bags will range in price from $3.00 to $10.00 and should be reserved
and pre-paid at least seven (7) days before the scheduled visit. The bags
will be ready and waiting for the teacher to pick up at the Thorn Tree Shop

The Cincinnati Zoo offers a special way for individuals and school classes
to join our family of endangered species. When your class chooses to ADOPT
an animal, you will receive a packet of information on the animal of your
choice, including a picture of the animal, a fact sheet, and a certificate
of ADOPTion. To learn more about how your class can become involved in this
fun and educational program, call the Development Department at <B>559-7716.</B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#FF1A09" SIZE=+1>All It Takes is a Little Change</FONT></B><BR>
The Cincinnati Zoo invites teachers and students to become part of an exciting
conservation program. On your next visit to the Zoo, take a moment to stop
at the Conservation Parking Meter located at the newly renovated &quot;Wings
of the World&quot; Bird House, and put some change in the meter. The collaborative
effort of many individuals putting coins into the meters at Zoos, Aquariums,
and other host organizations has raised over $1,000,000.00 for conservation.
Individually, all it took was a nickel, dime, or quarter, yet the combined
effort has made a BIG difference.</P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#FF1A09" SIZE=+1>Where Does the Money Go?</FONT></B><BR>
The Cincinnati Zoo's Conservation Parking Meter raises funds for the Maya
Biosphere Reserve in Guatemala. <B>All</B> of the funds from our meter go
toward conservation within Guatemala. The Reserve area includes 5 national
parks, 3 biological reserves, and multiple-use areas that surround the various
protected regions. The focus of the conservation work is currently in the
Peten region of northern Guatemala. Illegal lumber extraction, expansion
of cattle lands, uncontrolled agricultural colonization, and commercial
hunting have severely degraded this area.</P>

<P>The Center for Ecosystem Survival initiated the Conservation Parking
Meter and has collaborated with the Nature Conservancy, USAID, the Comision
Nacional de Areas Protegidas (CONAP), the Guatemalan Park Service, and ARCAS
(a non-profit conservation organization) to help provide the assistance
needed for a successful conservation effort in Guatemala. Very limited local
funding exists in Guatemala, so money is needed from outside the country.
Money is used for habitat acquisition, environmental education, biological
research, and training of park guards, reserve managers, and administrators.
Proper training in topics such as boundary marking, principals of patrolling
protected areas, and biological monitoring help to ensure adequate protection
for the these areas.</P>

<P>Local interest in the biological diversity of the area is also paramount
to the success of any conservation effort. ARCAS has developed environmental
education programs for area school children, opened a natural history library
for the community, assisted in a tourist-guide training program for members
of the Uaxactun community, and also operates a Wildlife Rescue and Research
Center (where confiscated wildlife is rehabilitated and then released back
into the  wild). ARCAS is partially funded through monies raised from the
Zoo's parking meter.</P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#FF1A09" SIZE=+1>Why the Maya Region is Important to
All of Us</FONT></B><BR>
Follow the skies southward. Every fall and spring, flocks of songbirds arrive
in the Maya Biosphere Reserve to rest and feed during their seasonal migration.
In fact, the Maya Region is a stop-over for an amazing 40% of North American
songbirds. Ornithologists have pointed out that the presence of suitable
habitat along migratory routes is crucial to the birds' ability to survive
and reproduce successfully each year. The longer a bird must search for
a satisfactory stop-over area, the less time and energy it has to complete
migration, set up and defend a territory, and raise young. Many of our favorite
bird species, such as hummingbirds, flycatchers, warblers, tanagers, and
orioles could not make their journey without a stop at the Maya Biosphere
Reserve.</P>

<P>Other distinctive fauna species include jaguars, pumas, tapir, howler
monkeys, harpy eagles, jabiru storks, crocodiles, and oscillated turkeys.
Both jaguar and puma are on display at the Zoo's Cat House. In the wild,
these large cats cannot survive unless large territories such as the Maya
Biosphere Reserve remain intact. The actual biodiversity of the Maya Biosphere
Reserve has yet to be thoroughly researched and holds new discoveries for
the aspiring biologist.</P>

<P>The Maya Region also contains remnants of one of the world's greatest
civilizations - the Maya. The Guatemalan Institute of Archaeology and History
estimates that there are more than 2,500 archaeological sites in the Maya
Region, but to date, only 260 are registered and a mere 25 protected. Without
adequate funding and solid conservation planning and implementation, these
historical treasures may be lost along with much of the area's biological
wealth.</P>

<P>With every crank of the Conservation Parking Meter, long lasting benefits
for people and wildlife are achieved. </P>

<P><B>Please contact Penny Geary at (513) 559-7768 if you have questions
about the Cincinnati Zoo's Conservation Programs, or are considering having
your class do a fund-raising project to support conservation work in the
Maya region.</B></P>

<h1><a href="/education/"><IMG SRC="/books-apple.jpg"
align=middle border=0></a>Cheetah Conservation Fund</h1>


        The Cheetah Conservation Fund (CCF) was founded in 1990 by the
husband and wife team of Daniel Kraus and Laurie Marker-Kraus with the
mission of saving the largest remaining population of free ranging
cheetahs in Namibia, Africa.  The CCF is part of the Center for Earth
Concerns, an organization based in California.  The long term objective
of the CCF is to initiate research and conservation efforts for the
cheetah and its ecosystem.  Namibia is home to approximately 2,500 wild
cheetah whose numbers have rapidly declined in the previous decade due to
habitat loss and human interference.  <p>
        Laurie and Daniel live on a farm in Namibia where they have a
first hand view of the plight of the cheetah.  One goal of the program is
to educate neighboring farms and families of the endangered status of the
cat.   The CCF encourages farmers to work with them by finding
alternatives to killing the cheetah.   With the help of Laurie and
Daniel, less cheetah have been trapped and killed and more farmers have
learned that they can coexist with these animals.  A cheetah spotted on
an unwanted farm can be relocated to CCF's side.  While under sedation
these captured cheetahs are extremely helpful as sources of blood and
tissue cultures that are used to assess genetic aspects as well as
problems with disease.  Each cat is radio collared and ear tagged for
identification.  Research volunteers keep track of distribution patterns
and prey availability.  By raising local awareness many farmers have now
allowed the release of cheetah onto their farms.  Many have introduced
animals such as guard dogs and donkeys to ward off cheetah and other
predators from livestock herds as a method of decreasing herd loss and
improving the image of the cheetah. <p>
        One of the CCF's ultimate goals is to establish a "cheetah
conservancy" consisting of a collection of farms in Namibia that are
willing to permit cheetah to roam free on their land.  Cathryn Hilker,
the director of the Cat Ambassador Program, purchased an 18,000 acre farm
called Elandsvreugde, or "Eland's Joy", in Namibia.  This farm serves as
a base of operations for the CCF in promoting the future existence of the
cheetah.<p>

conservation, education, and research please send inquiries to the

<LI>Do men naturally want young and beautiful women-and as many as they
 can get? 

<LI>Do women naturally want rich and powerful men-and a monogamous
 relationship? 

<LI>Do men like sex more than women? If so, why?

<LI>Is human behavior determined more by genes or environment?

<LI>Will there always be war and hatred because we naturally need US
 v. THEM relationships?

<LI>Are we naturally good and made evil through society, or are we
 naturally evil and are made good through society?

<LI>If there is no hereafter, what is the meaning of life in the
 here-and-now?

<H1>About the Skeptics Society</H1>
<HR>

The Skeptics Society is a member-supported organization of scholars,
scientists, historians, magicians, and the intellectually curious,
that sponsors a lecture series at Caltech and publishes the quarterly
magazine <EM>Skeptic</EM>, for the purpose of promoting science and
critical thinking, and disseminating information on pseudoscience,
pseudohistory, the paranormal, magic, superstition, fringe claims and
groups, revolutionary science, proto-science, and the history of
science and pseudoscience, in articles, essays, reviews, and letters.
The magazine is an international publication, available to all
members, as well as institutions and university, college, and public
libraries, and is available in most bookstores and magazine outlets.
Transcripts of Caltech lectures are reprinted in <EM>Skeptic</EM>, and
videotapes of the lectures are available through the magazine.  The
Skeptics Society also holds an annual Awards Ceremony to recognize
those who have made significant contributions toward the goals of the
Society and the magazine.  In addition, as a Society, the Skeptics
hold social events, take trips, and make field excursions related to
science, for both educational and social purposes.

<P>The Skeptics Society and <EM>Skeptic</EM> magazine investigate
claims by scientists, pseudoscientists, and pseudohistorians on a wide
variety of theories and conjectures including but not limited to:
evolution and creationism; cults and religion; Holocaust revisionism
and extreme Afrocentrism; conspiracy theories; near-death and
out-of-body experiences; cryonics, life after death and the quest for
immortality; witchcraft and witch crazes; mass hysterias and urban
myths; the relationship of science and science fiction; hypnosis and
altered states of consciousness; the difference between science and
pseudoscience and the difference between history and pseudo history;
magic and the paranormal; the use and abuse of theory and statistics
in science and pseudoscience; the role of skepticism; medical and
psychiatric claims; the scope and limitations of science and
technology; gender and race issues in science, society, and history;
cultural influences on science and scientific influences on culture;
the capacities and limitations of the human mind and body; scientific
and academic fraud and hoaxes.  The question the Skeptics Society asks
about all claims it investigates is this: How well do they hold up
under scientific scrutiny?</P>

<P>With regard to statements, hypotheses, theories, and ideologies
considered by the Skeptics Society, the organization adopts the
posture of the 17th-century Dutch philosopher Baruch Spinoza:
<BLOCKQUOTE><EM>"I have made a ceaseless effort not to ridicule, not to
bewail, not to scorn human actions, but to understand them."</EM>
</BLOCKQUOTE></P>

<P>With regard to its procedure of examination of all claims, the
Skeptics Society adapts the scientific method developed in the 16th
and 17th centuries. It recognizes the limitations and socio-cultural
influences on science, yet adopts the philosophy of Albert Einstein:
<BLOCKQUOTE><EM>"All our science, measured against reality, is
primitive and childlike--and yet it is the most precious thing we
have."</EM></BLOCKQUOTE></P>

<a name="intro"></a>
Freudian projection is the process of attributing one's own ideas, 
feelings, or attitudes to other people or objects--the guilt-laden 
adulterer accuses his spouse of adultery, the homophobe actually harbors 
latent homosexual tendencies. A subtle form of projection can be seen in 
the accusation by Christians that secular humanism and evolution are 
"religions"; or by cultists and paranormalists that skeptics are 
themselves a cult and that reason and science have cultic properties. 
For skeptics, the idea that reason can lead to a cult is absurd. The 
characteristics of a cult are 180 degrees out of phase with reason. But 
as I will demonstrate, not only can it happen, it has happened, and to a 
group that would have to be considered the unlikeliest cult in history. 
It is a lesson in what happens when the truth becomes more important 
than the <em>search</em> for truth, when final results of inquiry become more 
important than the <em>process</em> of inquiry, and especially when reason 
leads to an absolute certainty about one's beliefs such that those who 
are not for the group are against it. 
<p>The story begins in 1943 when an obscure Russian immigrant published 
her first successful novel after two consecutive failures. It was not an 
instant success. In fact, the reviews were harsh and initial sales 
sluggish. But slowly a following grew around the novel, word of mouth 
became the most effective marketing tool, and the author began to 
develop what could, with hindsight, be called a "cult following." The 
initial print-run of 7,500 copies was followed by multiples of five and 
10,000 until by 1950 half a million copies were circulating the country. 
The book was <em>The Fountainhead</em> and the author Ayn Rand. Her commercial 
success allowed her the time and freedom to write her magnum opus, 
<em>Atlas Shrugged</em>, published in 1957 after ten years in the making. It is 
a murder mystery, not about the murder of a human body, but of the 
murder of a human spirit. It is a broad and sweeping story of a man who 
said he would stop the ideological motor of the world. When he did, 
there was a panoramic collapse of civilization, with its flame kept 
burning by a small handful of heroic individuals whose reason and morals 
directed both the fall and the subsequent return of culture.</p>
<p>As they did to <em>The Fountainhead</em>, reviewers panned <em>Atlas</em> with
a savage brutality that, incredibly, only seemed to reinforce followers' 
belief in the book, its author, and her ideas. And, like <em>The 
Fountainhead</em>, sales of <em>Atlas</em> sputtered and clawed their way forward 
as the following grew, to the point where the book presently sells over 
300,000 copies a year. "In all my years of publishing," recalled Random 
House's owner, Bennett Cerf, "I've never seen anything like it. To break 
through against such enormous opposition!" (Branden, 1986, p. 298). Such 
is the power of an individual hero . . . and a cult-like following.</p>
<p>What is it about Rand's philosophy that so emotionally stimulates 
proponents and opponents alike? Before <em>Atlas Shrugged</em> was published, 
at a sales conference at Random House a salesman asked Rand if she could 
summarize the essence of her philosophy, called Objectivism, while 
standing on one foot. She did so as follows (1962):</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Metaphysics</em>: Objective Reality</li>
<li><em>Epistemology</em>: Reason</li>
<li><em>Ethics</em>: Self-interest</li>
<li><em>Politics</em>: Capitalism</li>
</ol>
In other words, nature exists independent of human thought. Reason is 
the only method of perceiving this reality. All humans seek personal 
happiness and exist for their own sake, and should not sacrifice 
themselves to or be sacrificed by others. And <em>laissez-faire</em> capitalism 
is the best political-economic system for the first three to flourish, 
where "men deal with one another, not as victims and executioners, nor 
as masters and slaves, but as traders, by free, voluntary exchange to 
mutual benefit," and where "no man may initiate the use of physical 
force against others" (p. 1). Ringing throughout Rand's works is the 
philosophy of individualism, personal responsibility, the power of 
reason, and the importance of morality. One should think for one's self 
and never allow an authority to dictate truth, especially the authority 
of government, religion, and other such groups. Success, happiness, and 
unrestrained upward mobility will accrue to those who use reason to act 
in the highest moral fashion, and who never demand favors or handouts. 
Objectivism is the ultimate philosophy of unsullied reason and 
unadulterated individualism, as expressed by Rand through her primary 
character in <em>Atlas Shrugged</em>, John Galt:
<blockquote>
         Man cannot survive except by gaining knowledge, and reason is 
      his only means to gain it. Reason is the faculty that perceives, 
      identifies and integrates the material provided by his senses. The 
      task of his senses is to give him the evidence of existence, but 
      the task of identifying it belongs to his reason, his senses tell 
      him only that something is, but what it is must be learned by his 
      mind (p. 1012).
<p>      In the name of the best within you, do not sacrifice this world 
      to those who are its worst. In the name of the values that keep 
      you alive, do not let your vision of man be distorted by the ugly, 
      the cowardly, the mindless in those who have never achieved his 
      title. Do not lose your knowledge that man's proper estate is an 
      upright posture, an intransigent mind and a step that travels 
      unlimited roads. Do not let your fire go out, spark by 
      irreplaceable spark, in the hopeless swamps of the approximate, 
      the not-quite, the not-yet, the not-at-all. Do not let the hero in 
      your soul perish, in lonely frustration for the life you deserved, 
      but have never been able to reach. Check your road and the nature 
      of your battle. The world you desired can be won, it exists, it is 
      real, it is possible, it's yours (p. 1069).</p>
</blockquote>
How, then, could such a philosophy become the basis of a cult, which 
is the antithesis of reason and individualism? A cult, however it is 
defined, depends on faith and deindividuation--that is, remove the power 
of reason in followers and make them dependent upon the group and/or the 
leader. The last thing a cult leader wants is for followers to think for 
themselves and become individuals apart from the group. 
<p>The cultic flaw in Ayn Rand's philosophy of Objectivism is not in the 
use of reason, or in the emphasis on individuality, or in the belief 
that humans are self motivated, or in the conviction that capitalism is 
the ideal system. The fallacy in Objectivism is the belief that absolute 
knowledge and final Truths are attainable through reason, and therefore 
there can be absolute right and wrong knowledge, and absolute moral and 
immoral thought and action. For Objectivists, once a principle has been 
discovered through reason to be True, that is the end of the discussion. 
If you disagree with the principle, then your reasoning is flawed. If 
your reasoning is flawed it can be corrected, but if it is not, you 
remain flawed and do not belong in the group. Excommunication is the 
final step for such unreformed heretics.</p>
<p>If you find it hard to believe that such a line of reasoning could 
lead a rational, well-intentioned group down the road to culthood, 
history demonstrates how it can happen. The 1960s were years of
anti-establishment, anti-government, find-yourself individualism, so Rand's 
philosophy exploded across the nation, particularly on college campuses. 
<em>Atlas Shrugged</em> became the book to read. Though it is a massive 1,168 
pages long, readers devoured the characters, the plot, and most 
importantly, the philosophy. It stirred emotions and evoked action. Ayn 
Rand clubs were founded at hundreds of colleges. Professors taught 
courses in the philosophy of Objectivism and the literary works of Rand. 
Rand's inner circle of friends began to grow and one of them, Nathaniel 
Branden, founded the Nathaniel Branden Institute (NBI), sponsoring 
lectures and courses on Objectivism, first in New York, and then 
nationally. </p>
<p>As the seminars increased in size and Rand's popularity shot skyward, 
so too did the confidence in her philosophy, both for Rand and her 
followers. Hundreds of people attended classes, thousands of letters 
poured into the office, and millions of books were being sold. Movie 
rights for <em>Atlas</em> were being negotiated (<em>The Fountainhead</em> had
already been made into a film). Her rise to intellectual power and influence
was nothing short of miraculous, and readers of her novels, especially 
<em>Atlas Shrugged</em>, told Rand it had changed their lives and their way of 
thinking. Their comments ring of the enthusiasm of the followers of a 
religious cult (Branden, 1986, pp. 407-415):</p>
<ul>
<li>After reading <em>Atlas</em> a young woman in the Peace Corps wrote: "I had 
undergone the loneliest, most inspiring, and heartrending
psycho-intellectual transformation, and all my plans upon returning to the 
United States had changed."</li>
<li>A 24-year old "traditional housewife" (her own label) read <em>Atlas</em>
and said: "Dagny Taggart [the book's principle heroine] was an inspiration 
to me; she is a great feminist role model. Ayn Rand's works gave me the 
courage to be and to do what I had dreamed of."</li>
<li>A businessman began reading <em>Atlas</em> and said "Within a few hundred 
pages I sensed clearly that I had ventured upon a lifetime of meaning. 
The philosophy of Ayn Rand nurtured growth, stability and integrity in 
my life. Her ideas permeated every aspect of my business, family and 
creative life."</li>
<li>A law school graduate said of Objectivism: "Dealing with Ayn Rand was 
like taking a post-doctoral course in mental functioning. The universe 
she created in her work holds out hope, and appeals to the best in man. 
Her lucidity and brilliance was a light so strong I don't think anything 
will ever be able to put it out."</li>
<li>An economics professor recalled: "After you read <em>Atlas Shrugged</em>
you don't look at the world with the same perspective."</li>
<li>A philosophy professor concluded: "Ayn Rand was one of the most 
original thinkers I have ever met. There is no escape from facing the 
issues she raised. . . . At a time in my life when I thought I had 
learned at least the essentials of most philosophical views, being 
confronted with her . . . suddenly changed the entire direction of my 
intellectual life, and placed every other thinker in a new perspective."</li>
<li>Another philosophy professor, this one disliking Rand and disagreeing 
with Objectivism, recalled after an all-night discussion with the 
philosopher-novelist: "She's found gaping holes in every philosophical 
position I've maintained for the whole of my life--positions I teach my 
students, positions on which I'm a recognized authority--and I can't 
answer her arguments! I don't know what to do!" (p. 247).</li>
</ul>
There are thousands more just like these, many from people who are 
now quite successful and well-known, and give credit to Rand. But to the 
inner circle surrounding and protecting Rand (in ironic humor they 
called themselves the "Collective"), their leader soon became more than 
just extremely influential. She was venerated as their leader. Her 
seemingly omniscient ideas were inerrant. The power of her personality 
made her so persuasive that no one dared to challenge her. And her 
philosophy of Objectivism, since it was derived through pure reason, 
revealed final Truth and dictated absolute morality.
<p>One of the closest to Rand was Nathaniel Branden, a young philosophy 
student who joined the Collective in the early days before <em>Atlas 
Shrugged</em> was published. In his autobiographical memoirs entitled 
<em>Judgment Day</em> (1989), Branden recalled: "There were implicit premises 
in our world to which everyone in our circle subscribed, and which we 
transmitted to our students at NBI." Incredibly, and here is where the 
philosophical movement became a cult, they came to believe that (pp. 
255-256):</p>
<ul>
<li>Ayn Rand is the greatest human being who has ever lived.</li>
<li><em>Atlas Shrugged</em> is the greatest human achievement in the history of 
the world.</li>
<li>Ayn Rand, by virtue of her philosophical genius, is the supreme 
arbiter in any issue pertaining to what is rational, moral, or 
appropriate to man's life on earth.</li>
<li>Once one is acquainted with Ayn Rand and/or her work, the measure of 
one's virtue is intrinsically tied to the position one takes regarding 
her and/or it.</li>
<li>No one can be a good Objectivist who does not admire what Ayn Rand 
admires and condemn what Ayn Rand condemns.</li>
<li>No one can be a fully consistent individualist who disagrees with Ayn 
Rand on any fundamental issue.</li>
<li>Since Ayn Rand has designated Nathaniel Branden as her "intellectual 
heir," and has repeatedly proclaimed him to be an ideal exponent of her 
philosophy, he is to be accorded only marginally less reverence than Ayn 
Rand herself.</li>
<li>But it is best not to say most of these things explicitly (excepting, 
perhaps, the first two items). One must always maintain that one arrives 
at one's beliefs solely by reason.</li>
</ul>
It is important to note that my critique of Rand and Objectivism as a 
cult is not original. Rand and her followers were, in their time, 
accused of being a cult which, of course, they denied. "My following is 
not a cult. I am not a cult figure," Rand once told an interviewer. 
Barbara Branden, in her biography, <em>The Passion of Ayn Rand</em>, recalls: 
"Although the Objectivist movement clearly had many of the trappings of 
a cult--the aggrandizement of the person of Ayn Rand, the too ready 
acceptance of her personal opinions on a host of subjects, the incessant 
moralizing--it is nevertheless significant that the fundamental 
attraction of Objectivism . . . was the precise opposite of religious 
worship" (p. 371). And Nathaniel Branden addressed the issue this way: 
"We were not a cult in the literal, dictionary sense of the word, but 
certainly there was a cultish aspect to our world . . . . We were a 
group organized around a charismatic leader, whose members judged one 
another's character chiefly by loyalty to that leader and to her ideas" 
(p. 256). 
<p>But if you leave the "religious" component out of the definition, 
thus broadening the word's usage, it becomes clear that Objectivism was 
(and is) a cult, as are many other, non-religious groups. In this 
context, then, a cult may be characterized by:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Veneration of the Leader</em>: Excessive glorification to the point of 
virtual sainthood or divinity.</li>
<li><em>Inerrancy of the Leader</em>: Belief that he or she cannot be wrong.</li>
<li><em>Omniscience of the Leader</em>: Acceptance of beliefs and pronouncements 
on virtually all subjects, from the philosophical to the trivial.</li>
<li><em>Persuasive Techniques</em>: Methods used to recruit new followers and 
reinforce current beliefs.</li>
<li><em>Hidden Agendas</em>: Potential recruits and the public are not given a 
full disclosure of the true nature of the group's beliefs and plans.</li>
<li><em>Deceit</em>: Recruits and followers are not told everything about the 
leader and the group's inner circle, particularly flaws or potentially 
embarrassing events or circumstances.</li>
<li><em>Financial and/or Sexual Exploitation</em>: Recruits and followers are 
persuaded to invest in the group, and the leader may develop sexual 
relations with one or more of the followers.</li>
<li><em>Absolute Truth</em>: Belief that the leader and/or group has a method of 
discovering final knowledge on any number of subjects.</li>
<li><em>Absolute Morality</em>: Belief that the leader and/or the group have 
developed a system of right and wrong thought and action applicable to 
members and nonmembers alike. Those who strictly follow the moral code 
may become and remain members, those who do not are dismissed or 
punished.</li>
</ul>
The ultimate statement of Rand's absolute morality heads the title 
page of Nathaniel Brandon's book. Says Rand:
<blockquote>
The precept: "Judge not, that ye be not judged" . . . is an 
abdication of moral responsibility: it is a moral blank check one gives 
to others in exchange for a moral blank check one expects for oneself.
<p>There is no escape from the fact that men have to make choices; so 
long as men have to make choices, there is no escape from moral values; 
so long as moral values are at stake, no moral neutrality is possible. 
To abstain from condemning a torturer, is to become an accessory to the 
torture and murder of his victims.</p>
<p>The moral principle to adopt . . . is: "Judge, and be prepared to be 
judged."</p></blockquote>
The absurd lengths to which such thinking can go is demonstrated by 
Rand's pronounced judgements on her followers of even the most trivial 
things. Rand had argued, for example, that musical taste could not be 
objectively defined, yet, as Barbara Branden observed, "if one of her 
young friends responded as she did to Rachmaninoff . . . she attached 
deep significance to their affinity." By contrast, if a friend did not 
respond as she did to a certain piece or composer, Rand "left no doubt 
that she considered that person morally and psychologically 
reprehensible." Branden recalled an evening when a friend of Rand's 
remarked that he enjoyed the music of Richard Strauss. "When he left at 
the end of the evening, Ayn said, in a reaction becoming increasingly 
typical, 'Now I understand why he and I can never be real soul mates. 
The distance in our sense of life is too great.' Often, she did not wait 
until a friend had left to make such remarks" (p. 268).   
<p>With this set of criteria it becomes possible to see that a rational 
philosophy can become a cult when most or all of these are met. This is 
true not only for philosophical movements, but in some scientific 
schools of thought as well. Many founding scientists have become almost 
deified in their own time, to the point where apprentices dare not 
challenge the master. As Max Planck observed about science in general, 
only after the founders and elder statesmen of a discipline are dead and 
gone can real change occur and revolutionary new ideas be accepted.</p>
<p>In both Barbara's and Nathaniel Branden's assessment, then, we see 
all the characteristics of a cult. But what about deceit and sexual 
exploitation? In this case, "exploitation" may be too strong of a word, 
but the act was present nonetheless, and deceit was rampant. In what has 
become the most scandalous (and now oft-told) story in the brief history 
of the Objectivist movement, starting in 1953 and lasting until 1958 
(and on and off for another decade after), Ayn Rand and her 
"intellectual heir" Nathaniel Branden, 25 years her junior, carried on a 
secret love affair known only to their respective spouses. The falling 
in love was not planned, but it was ultimately "reasonable" since the 
two of them were, de facto, the two greatest humans on the planet. "By 
the total logic of who we are--by the total logic of what love and sex 
mean--we had to love each other," Rand told Barbara Branden and her own 
husband, Frank O'Connor. It was a classic display of a brilliant mind 
intellectualizing a purely emotional response, and another example of 
reason carried to absurd heights. "Whatever the two of you may be 
feeling," Rand rationalized, "I know your intelligence, I know you 
recognize the rationality of what we feel for each other, and that you 
hold no value higher than reason" (B. Brandon, p. 258).</p>
<p>Unbelievably, both Barbara and Frank accepted the affair, and agreed 
to allow Ayn and Nathaniel an afternoon and evening of sex and love once 
a week. "And so," Barbara explained, "we all careened toward disaster." 
The "rational" justification and its consequences continued year after 
year, as the tale of interpersonal and group deceit grew broader and 
deeper. The disaster finally came in 1968 when it became known to Rand 
that Branden had fallen in love with yet another woman, and had begun an 
affair with her. Even though the affair between Rand and Branden had 
long since dwindled, the master of the absolutist moral double-standard 
would not tolerate such a breach of ethical conduct. "Get that bastard 
down here!," Rand screamed upon hearing the news, "or I'll drag him here 
myself!" Branden, according to Barbara, slunk into Rand's apartment to 
face the judgment day. "It's finished, your whole act!" she told him. 
"I'll tear down your facade as I built it up! I'll denounce you 
publicly, I'll destroy you as I created you! I don't even care what it 
does to me. You won't have the career I gave you, or the name, or the 
wealth, or the prestige. You'll have nothing . . . ." The barrage 
continued for several minutes until she pronounced her final curse: "If 
you have an ounce of morality left in you, an ounce of psychological 
health--you'll be impotent for the next twenty years!" (pp. 345-347).</p>
<p>Rand's verbal attack was followed by a six-page open letter to her 
followers in her publication <em>The Objectivist</em> (May, 1968). It was 
entitled "To Whom It May Concern." After explaining that she had 
completely broken with the Brandens, Rand continued the deceit through 
lies of omission: "About two months ago . . . Mr. Branden presented me 
with a written statement which was so irrational and so offensive to me 
that I had to break my personal association with him." Without so much 
as a hint of the nature of the offense Rand continued: "About two months 
later Mrs. Branden suddenly confessed that Mr. Branden had been 
concealing from me certain ugly actions and irrational behavior in his 
private life, which was grossly contradictory to Objectivist morality . 
. . . " Branden's second affair was judged immoral, his first was not. 
This excommunication was followed by a reinforcing barrage from NBI's 
Associate Lecturers that sounds all too ecclesiastical in its 
denouncement (and written out of complete ignorance of what really 
happened): "Because Nathaniel Branden and Barbara Branden, in a series 
of actions, have betrayed fundamental principles of Objectivism, we 
condemn and repudiate these two persons irrevocably, and have terminated 
all association with them . . . . " (Branden, 1986, pp. 353-354).</p>
<p>Confusion reigned supreme in both the Collective and in the
rank-and-file membership. Mail poured into the office, most of it supporting
Rand (naturally, since they knew nothing of the first affair). Nathaniel 
received angry responses and even Barbara's broker, an Objectivist, 
terminated her as his client. The group was in turmoil over the 
incident. What were they to think with such a formidable condemnation of 
unnamed sins? The ultimate extreme of such absolutist thinking was 
revealed several months later when, in the words of Barbara, "a
half-demented former student of NBI had raised the question of whether or not 
it would be morally appropriate to assassinate Nathaniel because of the 
suffering he had caused Ayn; the man concluded that it should not be 
done on practical grounds, but would be morally legitimate. Fortunately, 
he was shouted down at once by a group of appalled students" (p. 356n).</p>
<p>It was the beginning of the long decline and fall of Rand's tight 
grip over the Collective. One by one they sinned, the transgressions 
becoming more minor as the condemnations grew in fierceness. And one by 
one they left, or were asked to leave. In the end (Rand died in 1982) 
there remained only a handful of friends, and the designated executor of 
her estate, Leonard Peikoff (who presently carries on the cause through 
the Southern California based Ayn Rand Institute, "The Center for the 
Advancement of Objectivism"). While the cultic qualities of the group 
sabotaged the inner circle, there remained (and remains) a huge 
following of those who choose to ignore the indiscretions, infidelities, 
and moral inconsistencies of the founder, and focus instead on the 
positive aspects of the philosophy. There is much in it from which to 
choose, if you do not have to accept the whole package. In this 
analysis, then, there are three important caveats about cults, 
skepticism, and reason:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Criticism of the founder of a philosophy does not, by itself, 
constitute a negation of any part of the philosophy</em>. The fact that 
Christians have been some of the worst violators of their own moral 
system does not mean that the ethical axioms of "thou shalt not kill," 
or "due unto others as you would have them do unto you," are negated. 
The components of a philosophy must stand or fall on their own internal 
consistency or empirical support, regardless of the founder's 
personality quirks or moral inconsistencies. By most accounts Newton was 
a cantankerous and relatively unpleasant person to be around. This fact 
has nothing at all to do with his principles of natural philosophy. With 
thinkers who proffer moral principles, as in the case of Rand, this 
caveat is more difficult to apply, but it is true nonetheless. It is 
good to know these things about Rand, but it does not nullify her 
philosophy. I reject her principles of final Truth and absolute morality 
not because Rand had feet of clay, but because I do not believe they are 
either logically or empirically tenable.</li>
<li><em>Criticism of part of a philosophy does not gainsay the whole</em>. In 
a similar analogy as above, one may reject parts of the Christian 
philosophy while embracing others. I might, for example, attempt to 
treat others as I would have them treat me, while at the same time 
renounce the belief that women should remain silent in church and be 
obedient to their husbands. One may disavow Rand's absolute morality, 
while accepting her metaphysics of objective reality, her epistemology 
of reason, and her political philosophy of capitalism (though 
Objectivists would say they all follow from her metaphysics). Which 
leads me to the third caveat.</li>
<li><em>The critic of part of a philosophy does not necessarily repudiate 
the whole philosophy</em>. This is a personal caveat to Objectivists and 
readers of <em>Skeptic</em> alike. Rand critics come from all political 
positions--left, right, and middle. Professional novelists generally 
disdain her style. Professional philosophers generally refuse to take 
her work seriously (both because she wrote for popular audiences and 
because her work is not considered a complete philosophy). There are 
more Rand critics than followers. I am not one of them. Ayn Rand has 
probably influenced my thinking more than any other author. I have read 
all of her works, including her newsletters, early works, and the two 
major biographies. I have even read the Brobdingnagian <em>Atlas Shrugged</em> 
no less than three times, plus once on audio tape for good measure. Thus 
I am not a blind critic. (Some of Rand's critics have attacked <em>Atlas</em> 
without ever reading it, and Objectivism, without ever knowing anything 
about it. I have encountered many of these myself. Even the pompously 
intellectual William Buckley spoke of the "desiccated philosophy" of 
<em>Atlas</em>, "the essential aridity of Miss Rand's philosophy," and the tone 
of <em>Atlas</em> as "over-riding arrogance," yet later confessed: "I never 
read the book. When I read the review of it and saw the length of the 
book, I never picked it up." Nothing could be more irrational.) I accept 
most of Rand's philosophy, but not all of it. And despite my life-long 
commitment to many of Rand's most important beliefs, Objectivists would 
no doubt reject me from their group for not accepting <em>all</em> of her 
precepts. This is ultimately what makes Objectivism a cult.</li>
</ol>
I believe (and here I speak strictly for myself and not for the 
Skeptics Society or any of its members) that reality exists and that 
reason and science are the best tools we have for understanding 
causality in the real world. We can achieve an ever-greater 
understanding of reality but we can never know if we have final Truth 
with regard to nature. Since reason and science are human activities, 
they will always be flawed and biased. I believe that humans are 
primarily driven to seek greater happiness, but the definition of such 
is <em>completely personal</em> and cannot be dictated and should not be 
controlled by any group. (Even so-called selfless acts of charity can be 
perceived as directed toward self-fulfillment--the act of making someone 
else feel good, makes us feel good. This is not a falsifiable statement, 
but it is observable in people's actions and feelings.) I believe that 
the free market--and the freer the better--is the best system yet 
devised for allowing <em>all</em> individuals to achieve greater levels of 
happiness. (This is not a defensible statement in this forum. I am just 
setting the stage for my critique of Rand.) I believe that individuals 
should take personal responsibility for their actions, buck up and quit 
whining when facing the usual array of life's problems, and cease this 
endless disease-of-the-month victimization. Finally, I wholeheartedly 
embrace Rand's passionate love of the heroic nature of humanity and of 
the ability of the human spirit to triumph over nature.
<p>So far so good. I might have even made it into the Rand inner circle. 
But I would have been promptly excommunicated as an unreformed heretic 
(the worst kind, since reformed heretics can at least be retrained and 
forgiven), with my belief that no absolute morality is scientifically or 
rationally tenable, even that which claims to have been derived through 
pure reason, as in the case of Rand. The reason is straightforward. 
Morals do not exist in nature and thus cannot be discovered. In nature 
there are just actions--physical actions, biological actions, and human 
actions. Human actors act to increase their happiness, however they 
personally define it. Their actions become moral or immoral when someone 
else judges them as such. Thus, morality is a strictly human creation, 
subject to all the cultural influences and social constructions as other 
such human creations. Since virtually everyone and every group claims 
they know what right and wrong human action is, and since virtually all 
of these moralities are different from all others to a greater or lesser 
extent, then reason alone tells us they cannot all be correct Just as 
there is no absolute right type of human music, there is no absolute 
right type of human action. The broad range of human action is a rich 
continuum that precludes its pigeonholing into the unambiguous yeses and 
noes that political laws and moral codes require.</p>
<p>Does this mean that all human actions are morally equal? No. Not any 
more than all human music is equal. We create standards of what we like 
and dislike, desire or not, and make judgments against these standards. 
But the standards are themselves human creations and not discovered in 
nature. One group prefers classical music, and so judges Mozart to be 
superior to the Moody Blues. Similarly, one group prefers patriarchal 
dominance, and so judges male privileges to be morally honorable. 
Neither Mozart nor males are absolutely better, only so when compared to 
the group's standards. Thus, male ownership of females was once moral 
and is now immoral, not because we have discovered it as such, but 
because our society has realized that women also seek greater happiness 
and that they can achieve this more easily without being in bondage to 
males. A society that seeks greater happiness for its members by giving 
them greater freedom, will judge a Hitler or a Stalin as morally 
intolerable because his goal is the confiscation of human life, without 
which one can have no happiness.</p>
<p>As long as it is understood that morality is a human construction 
influenced by human cultures, one can become more tolerant of other 
human belief systems, and thus other humans. But as soon as a group sets 
itself up to be the final moral arbiter of other people's actions, 
especially when its members believe they have discovered absolute 
standards of right and wrong, it is the beginning of the end of 
tolerance and thus, reason and rationality. It is this characteristic 
more than any other that makes a cult, a religion, a nation, or any 
other group, dangerous to individual freedom. This was (and is) the 
biggest flaw in Ayn Rand's Objectivism, the unlikeliest cult in history. 
The historical development and ultimate destruction of her group and 
philosophy is the empirical evidence to support this logical analysis.</p>
<p>What separates science from all other human activities (and morality 
has never been successfully placed on a scientific basis), is its belief 
in the tentative nature of all conclusions. There are no final absolutes 
in science, only varying degrees of probability. Even scientific "facts" 
are just conclusions confirmed to such an extent it would be reasonable 
to offer temporary agreement, but never final assent. Science is not the 
affirmation of a set of beliefs but a process of inquiry aimed at 
building a testable body of knowledge constantly open to rejection or 
confirmation. In science, knowledge is fluid and certainty fleeting. 
That is the heart of its limitation. It is also its greatest strength.</p>

<a name="intro">
On the opening page of the splendid little book <em>To Know a Fly</em>,
Vincent Dethier makes this humorous observation of how children grow up to 
become scientists: "Although small children have taboos against stepping 
on ants because such actions are said to bring on rain, there has never 
seemed to be a taboo against pulling off the legs or wings of flies. 
Most children eventually outgrow this behavior. Those who do not either 
come to a bad end or become biologists" (1962, p. 2). The same could be 
said of skepticism. In their early years children are knowledge junkies, 
questioning everything in their view, though exhibiting little 
skepticism. Most never learn to distinguish between inquisitiveness and  
credulity. Those who do either come to a bad end or become professional 
skeptics.
<p><a href="01.1.about-randi.html">James Randi</a> is one of these. So too are
the founders and fellows of the Committee for the Scientific Investigation
of Claims of the Paranormal (CSICOP), the predecessor to the
<em>Skeptics Society</em> whose journal - the <em>Skeptical Inquirer</em> - has
set the standard toward which this and other such publications must strive
in the pursuit of skepticism. But what does it mean to be skeptical? The
word is a troublesome one because of the heavy baggage it carries. The word
has different meanings for different people. (We had considered many names 
but decided that as long as it is defined the word is a useful one. 
Within the name we had also considered <em>Institute for Rational 
Skepticism</em>, but rejected it for fear that we might  become known as the 
IRS, an organization about which many people are already skeptical!)</p>

<a name="limit">
<h2>The Meaning and Limits of Skepticism</h2>
</a>
Skepticism has a long historical tradition dating back to ancient Greek 
thought. The foremost historian of skepticism, Richard Popkin, tells us: 
"Academic scepticism, so-called because it was formulated in the 
Platonic Academy in the third century, B.C., developed from the Socratic 
observation, 'All I know is that I know nothing'"(1979, p. xiii). Two of 
the popular received meanings of the word by many people today are that 
a skeptic believes nothing, or is closed minded to certain beliefs. 
There is good reason for the perception of the first meaning. The 
<em>Oxford English Dictionary (OED)</em> gives this common usage for the word 
skeptic: "One who, like Pyrrho and his followers in Greek antiquity, 
doubts the possibility of real knowledge of any kind; one who holds that 
there are no adequate grounds for certainty as to the truth of any 
proposition whatever" (1971, Vol. 2, p. 2663).
<p>Since this position is sterile and unproductive and held by virtually 
no one (except a few confused solipsists who doubt even their own 
existence), it is no wonder that so many find skepticism disturbing. A 
more productive meaning of the word skeptic is the second usage given by 
the <em>OED</em>: "One who doubts the validity of what claims to be knowledge in 
some particular department of inquiry; one who maintains a doubting 
attitude with reference to some particular question or statement."</p>
<p>The history of the word skeptic and skepticism is interesting and 
often amusing. In 1672, for example, the <em>Philosophical Transactions</em> 
VII records this passage: "Here he taketh occasion to examine 
Pyrrhonisme or Scepticisme, professed by a Sect of men that speak 
otherwise than they think." The charge is true. The most ardent skeptics 
enjoy their skepticism as long as it does not encroach upon their most 
cherished beliefs. Then incredulity flies out the window. I received a 
call recently from a gentleman who professed to be a skeptic, wanted to 
support the organization, and agrees with our skepticism about 
everything except the power of vitamins to restore health and attenuate 
disease. He hoped I would not be organizing any skeptical lectures or 
articles on this field, which, he explained, has now been proven 
scientifically to be effective. "Your field wouldn't be vitamin therapy 
would it?" I inquired. "You bet it is!" he responded.
<p>It is easy, even fun to challenge others' beliefs, when we are smug 
in our certainty about our own. But when ours are challenged, it takes 
great patience and ego strength to listen with an unjaundiced ear. But 
there is a deeper flaw in pure skepticism. Taken to an extreme the 
position by itself cannot stand. The <em>OED</em> gives us this 1674 literary 
example (Tucker <em>Lt. Nat.</em> II): "There is an air of positiveness in all 
scepticism, an unreserved confidence in the strength of those arguments 
that are alleged to overthrow all the knowledge of mankind." Skepticism 
is itself a positive assertion about knowledge, and thus turned on 
itself cannot be held. If you are skeptical about everything, you would 
have to be skeptical of your own skepticism. Like the decaying sub-atomic
particle, pure skepticism uncoils and spins off the viewing 
screen of our intellectual cloud chamber.</p>
<p>Skepticism alone does not produce progress. It is not enough simply 
to reject the irrational. Skepticism must be followed with something 
rational, or something that does produce progress. As the Austrian 
economist Ludwig von Mises warned against those anti-communists who 
presented no rational alternative to the system of which they were so 
skeptical (1956, p. 112):</p>
<blockquote>
An anti-something movement displays a purely negative attitude. It 
has no chance whatever to succeed. Its passionate diatribes 
virtually advertise the program they attack. People must fight for 
something that they want to achieve, not simply reject an evil, 
however bad it may be.</blockquote>
Carl Sagan sounded a similar warning to the professional skeptics at 
the 1987 CSICOP annual meeting: "You can get into a habit of thought in 
which you enjoy making fun of all those other people who don't see 
things as clearly as you do. We have to guard carefully against it" (in 
Basil, 1988, p. 366).

<a name="rats">
<h2>The Rational Skeptic</h2>
</a>
The second popular notion that skeptics are closed-minded to certain 
beliefs comes from a misunderstanding of skepticism and science. 
Skeptics and scientists are not necessarily "closed-minded" (though they 
may be since they are human). They may have been open-minded to a belief 
but when the evidence failed to support the belief, they rejected it. 
There are already enough legitimate mysteries in the universe for which 
evidence provides scientists fodder for their research, that to take the 
time to consider "unseen" or "unknown" mysteries is not always 
practical. When the non-skeptic says, "you're just closed-minded to the 
unknown forces of the universe," the skeptic responds: "We're still 
trying to understand the known forces of the universe."</p>
<p>It is for these reasons that it might be useful to modify the word 
skeptic with "rational." Again, it is constructive to examine the usage 
and history of this word that is so commonly used. Rational is given as: 
"Having the faculty of reasoning; endowed with reason" (<em>OED</em>, p. 2420). 
And reason as "A statement of some fact employed as an argument to 
justify or condemn some act, prove or disprove some assertion, idea, or 
belief" (p. 2431). It may seem rather pedantic to dig through the 
dictionary and pull out arcane word usages and histories. But it is 
constructive to know how a word was intended to be used and what it has 
come to mean. They are often not the same, and more often than not, they 
have multiple usages such that when two people communicate they are 
frequently talking at cross purposes. One person's skepticism may be 
another's credulity. And who does not think they are rational when it 
comes to their own beliefs and ideologies?</p>
<p>It is also important to remember that dictionaries do not give 
definitions. They give usages. For a listener to understand a speaker, 
and for a reader to follow a writer, important words must be defined 
with semantic precision for communication to be successful. What I mean 
by skeptic is the second usage above: "One who doubts the validity of 
what claims to be knowledge in some particular department of inquiry." 
And by rational: "A statement of some fact employed as an argument to 
justify or condemn some act, prove or disprove some assertion, idea, or 
belief." But these usages leave out one important component: the goal of 
reason and rationality. The ultimate end to thinking is to understand 
cause-and-effect relationships in the world around us. It is to know the 
universe, the world, and ourselves. Since rationality is the most 
reliable means of thinking, a rational skeptic may be defined as:
<blockquote> <em>One who questions the validity of particular claims of
knowledge by employing or calling for statements of fact to prove or 
disprove claims, as a tool for understanding causality.</em></blockquote></p>
But what method shall we employ? Just being skeptical will lead us to 
no conclusion other than the Socratic conclusion that we do not know. 
The answer, in a word, is science, and the method, in two words, is the 
scientific method.

<a name="science">
<h2>Science and the Rational Skeptic</h2>
</a>
Needless to say, reviewing the usages and history of the word science 
would be inappropriately long here, and I have already done this to a 
certain extent in the essay at the end of this issue. For purposes of 
clarity science will be taken to mean: <em>a set of cognitive and 
behavioral methods designed to describe and interpret observed or 
inferred phenomenon, past or present, aimed at building a testable body 
of knowledge open to rejection or confirmation.</em>
<p>Science is a specific way of thinking and acting - a tool for 
understanding information that is perceived directly or indirectly 
("observed or inferred"). "Past or present" refers to both the 
historical and the experimental sciences. Cognitive methods include 
hunches, guesses, ideas, hypotheses, theories, paradigms, etc.; 
behavioral methods include background research, data collection, data 
organization, colleague collaboration and communication, experiments, 
correlation of findings, statistical analyses, manuscript preparation, 
conference presentations, publications, etc. This definition is 
discussed in greater detail in the later essay. More controversial, and 
less likely to find agreement among practitioners, is a definition of 
the scientific method. In fact, one of the more insightful and amusing 
observations on this problem was made by the Nobel laureate and 
philosopher of science, Sir Peter Medawar (1969, p. 11):</p>
<blockquote>Ask a scientist what he conceives the scientific method to be and 
he will adopt an expression that is at once solemn and shifty-
eyed: solemn, because he feels he ought to declare an opinion; 
shifty-eyed, because he is wondering how to conceal the fact that 
he has no opinion to declare.</blockquote>
A sizable body of literature exists on the scientific method and 
there is little consensus among the authors. This does not mean that 
scientists do not know what they are doing. Doing and explaining may be 
two different things. For the purpose of outlining a methodology for the 
rational skeptic to apply to questionable claims, the following four 
step process may represent, on the simplest of levels, something that 
might be called the "scientific method":
<ol>
<li><em>Observation</em>: Gathering data through the senses or sensory enhancing 
technologies.</li>
<li><em>Induction</em>: Drawing general conclusions from the data. Forming 
hypothesis.</li>
<li><em>Deduction</em>: Making specific predictions from the general 
conclusions.</li>
<li><em>Verification</em>: Checking the predictions against further 
observations.</li>
</ol>
Science, of course, is not this rigid; and no scientist consciously 
goes through such "steps." The process is a constantly interactive one 
between making observations, drawing conclusions, making predictions, 
and checking them against further evidence. This process constitutes the 
core of what philosophers of science call the <em>hypothetico-deductive</em> 
method, which involves "(a) putting forward a hypothesis, (b) conjoining 
it with a statement of 'initial conditions', &#169 deducing from the two a 
prediction, and (d) finding whether or not the prediction is fulfilled" 
(Bynum, Browne, Porter, 1981, p. 196).
<p>Observations are what flesh out the hypothetico-deductive process and 
serve as the final arbiter for the validity of the predictions. As Sir 
Arthur Stanley Eddington noted: "For the truth of the conclusions of 
science, observation is the supreme court of appeal" (1958, p. 9).</p>
<p>Through the scientific method we form the following generalizations:
<ul>
<li><em>Hypothesis</em>: A testable statement to account for a set of
observations.</li>
<li><em>Theory</em>: A well-supported testable statement to account for a set of 
observations.</li>
<li><em>Fact</em>:  Data or conclusions confirmed to such an extent it would be 
reasonable to offer temporary agreement. (Adopted from Gould, 1983, p. 
255.)</li>
</ul></p>
These may be opposed to a <em>construct</em>, or a non-testable statement to 
account for a set of observations. The observation of living organisms 
on Earth may be accounted for by God or by evolution. The first 
statement is a construct, the second a theory. Most biologists would 
even call evolution a fact by the above definition.
<p>Through the scientific method we aim for:</p>

<p><em>Objectivity</em>: The basing of conclusions on external validation.</p>

<p>We avoid:</p>

<p><em>Mysticism</em>:  The basing of conclusions on personal insights that lack 
external validation.</p>

<p>There is nothing wrong with personal insight. Many great scientists 
attributed important ideas to insight, intuition, and other equally 
difficult-to-define concepts. Alfred Wallace said that the idea of 
natural selection "suddenly flashed upon" him during an attack of 
malaria. Timothy Ferris called Einstein, "the great intuitive artist of 
science." But insightful and intuitive ideas do not gain acceptance 
until they are externally validated. As Richard Hardison explained 
(1988, p. 259-260):</p>
<blockquote>Mystical "truths," by their nature, must be solely personal, and 
they can have no possible external validation. Each has equal 
claim to truth. Tea leaf reading and astrology and Buddhism; each 
is equally sound or unsound if we judge by the absence of related 
evidence. This is not intended to disparage any one of the faiths; 
merely to note the impossibility of verifying their correctness. 
The mystic is in a paradoxical position. When he seeks external 
support for his views he must turn to external arguments, and he 
denies mysticism in the process. External validation is, by 
definition, impossible for the mystic.</blockquote>
   
Science leads us toward:

<p><em>Rationalism</em>: The basing of conclusions on the scientific method. For 
example, how do you know the Earth is round?
<ol>
<li>The shadow on the moon is round.</li>
<li>The mast of a ship is the last thing seen.</li>
<li>The horizon is curved.</li>
<li>Photographs from space.</li>
</ol>
</p>

Science helps us avoid:

<p><em>Dogmatism</em>: The basing of conclusions on authority rather than
science. For example, how do you know the Earth is round?
<ol>
<li>My parents told me.</li>
<li>My teachers told me.</li>
<li>My minister told me.</li>
<li>My textbook told me.</li>
</ol></p>

Dogmatic conclusions are not necessarily invalid but they do pose 
another question: How did the authorities come by their conclusions? Did 
they use science or some other means?

<a name="tension">
<h2>The Essential Tension Between Skepticism and Credulity</h2>
</a>
It is important too that we recognize the fallibility of science and the 
scientific method. But within this fallibility lies its greatest 
strength: self-correction. Whether mistakes are made honestly or 
dishonestly, whether a fraud is unknowingly or knowingly perpetrated, in 
time it will be flushed out of the system through the lack of external 
verification. The cold fusion fiasco is a classic example of the 
system's swift consequences for error and hasty publication. 
<p>Because of the importance of this self-correcting feature, there is 
in the profession what Richard Feynman calls "a principle of scientific 
thought that corresponds to a kind of utter honesty - a kind of leaning 
over backwards." Feynman says: "If you're doing an experiment, you 
should report everything that you think might make it invalid - not only 
what you think is right about it: other causes that could possibly 
explain your results" (1988, p. 247).</p>
<p>Despite these built in mechanisms science is still subject to a 
number of problems and fallacies that even the most careful scientist 
and rational skeptic are aware can be troublesome. We can, however, find 
inspiration in those who have overcome them to make monumental 
contributions to our understanding of the world and ourselves. Charles 
Darwin is a sterling example of a scientist who struck the right balance 
in what Thomas Kuhn calls the "essential tension" in science between 
total acceptance of and devotion to the status quo, and an open 
willingness to explore and accept new ideas (1962, 1977). This delicate 
balance forms the basis of the whole concept of paradigm shifts in the 
history of science. When enough of the scientific community 
(particularly those in positions of power) are willing to abandon the 
old orthodoxy in favor of the (formerly) radical new theory, then, and 
only then can the paradigm shift occur.</p>
<p>This generalization about change in science is usually made about the 
paradigm as a system, but we must recognize that the paradigm is a 
cognitive framework in the minds of individuals. Darwinian scholar Frank 
Sulloway identifies three characteristics of Darwin's intellect and 
personality that mark him as one of the handful of giants in the history 
of science who found the right balance (1991, p. 28): "First, although 
Darwin indeed had unusual reverence for the opinions of others, he was 
obviously quite capable of challenging authority and thinking for 
himself." Second, "Darwin was also unusual as a scientist in his extreme 
respect for, and attention to, negative evidence." Darwin included, for 
example, a chapter on "Difficulties on Theory" in the <em>Origin of 
Species</em>; as a result his objectors were rarely able to present him with 
a challenge that he had not already confronted or addressed. And third 
was Darwin's "ability to tap the collective resources of the scientific 
community and to enlist other scientists as fellow collaborators in his 
own research projects." Darwin's collected correspondence numbers 
greater than 16,000 extant letters, most of which involve lengthy 
discussions and question-and-answer sequences about scientific problems. 
He was constantly questioning, always learning, confident enough to 
formulate original ideas, yet modest enough to recognize his own 
fallibility.</p>
<p>A fourth that might be mentioned is that Darwin maintained a good 
dollop of modesty and cautiousness that Sulloway sees as "a valuable 
attribute" that helps "prevent an overestimation of one's own theories." 
There is much to be learned in this regard from Darwin's 
<em>Autobiography</em>. Darwin confesses that he has "no great quickness of 
apprehension or wit which is so remarkable in some clever men," a lack 
of which makes him "a poor critic: a paper or book, when first read, 
generally excites my admiration, and it is only after considerable 
reflection that I perceive the weak points." Unfortunately many of 
Darwin's critics have selectively quoted such passages against him, not 
seeing the advantage Darwin saw in the patient avoidance of regrettable 
mistakes made in haste (1892, p. 55):</p>
<blockquote>I think that I have become a little more skillful in guessing 
right explanations and in devising experimental tests; but this 
may probably be the result of mere practice, and of a larger store 
of knowledge. I have as much difficulty as ever in expressing 
myself clearly and concisely; and this difficulty has caused me a 
very great loss of time; but it has had the compensating advantage 
of forcing me to think long and intently about every sentence, and 
thus I have been often led to see errors in reasoning and in my 
own observations or those of others.</blockquote>

His is a lesson in science and in life well worth learning. What 
Sulloway sees as particularly special about Darwin was his ability to 
resolve the essential tension within himself. "Usually, it is the 
scientific community as a whole that displays this essential tension 
between tradition and change," Sulloway observes, "since most people 
have a preference for one or the other way of thinking. What is 
relatively rare in the history of science is to find these contradictory 
qualities combined in such a successful manner in one individual" (p. 
32).
<p>Carl Sagan summed up the essential tension between skepticism and 
credulity in his CSICOP lecture on "The Burden of Skepticism":</p>
<blockquote>It seems to me what is called for is an exquisite balance 
between two conflicting needs: the most skeptical scrutiny of all 
hypotheses that are served up to us and at the same time a great 
openness to new ideas. If you are only skeptical, then no new 
ideas make it through to you. You never learn anything new. You 
become a crochety old person convinced that nonsense is ruling the 
world. (There is, of course, much data to support you.) 
<p>On the other hand, if you are open to the point of gullibility 
and have not an ounce of skeptical sense in you, then you cannot 
distingush the useful ideas from the worthless ones. If all ideas 
have equal validity then you are lost, because then, it seems to 
me, no ideas have any validity at all" (in Basil, 1988, p. 366).</p>
</blockquote>

There is some hope that rational skepticism, and the vigorous 
application of the scientific method, can help us navigate through the 
treacherous straights between pure skepticism and unmitigated credulity.

<a name="tool">
<h2>The Tool of the Mind</h2>
</a>
Science is the best method humankind has devised for understanding 
causality. Therefore the scientific method is our most effective tool 
for understanding the causes of the effects we are confronted with in 
our personal lives as well as in nature. There are few human traits that 
most observers would call truly universal. Most would consent, however, 
that survival of the species as a whole, and the achivement of greater 
happiness of individuals in particular, are universals that virtually 
every human being seeks. We have seen the interrelationship between 
science, rationality, and rational skepticism. Thus, we may go so far as 
to say that the survival of the human species and the attainment of 
greater happiness for individuals depend on the ability to think  
scientifically, rationally, and skeptically.
<p>It is assumed that human beings  are born with the ability to 
perceive cause-and-effect relationships.  When we are born we have no 
cultural experience whatsoever. But we do not come into the world 
completely ignorant. We know lots of things - how to see, hear, digest 
food, track a moving object in the visual field, blink at approaching 
objects, become anxious when placed over a ledge, develop a taste 
aversion for noxious foods, and so on. We also inherit the traits our 
ancestors evolved in a world filled with predators and natural 
disasters, poisons and dangers, and risks from all sides. We are 
descended from the most successful ancestors at understanding causality.</p>
<p>Our brains are natural machines for piecing together events that may 
be related and for solving problems that require our attention. One can 
envision an ancient hominid from Africa chipping and grinding and 
shaping a rock into a sharp tool for carving up a large mammalian 
carcass. Or perhaps we can imagine the first individual who discovered 
that knocking flint would create a spark with which to start a fire. The 
wheel, the lever, the bow and arrow, the plow - inventions intended to 
allow us to shape our environment rather than be shaped by it - started 
civilization down a path that led to our modern scientific and 
technological world.</p>
<p>In his discussion of the rewards of science, Vincent Dethier, whose 
words opened this manifesto, runs through the pantheon of the obvious 
ones - monetary, security, honor - as well as the transcendent: "a 
passport to the world, a feeling of belonging to one race, a feeling 
that transcends political boundaries and ideologies, religions, and 
languages." But he brushes these aside for one "more lofty and more 
subtle." This is the natural curiosity of humans in their drive to 
understand the world:</p>
<blockquote>One of the characteristics that sets man apart from all the other 
animals (and animal he undubitably is) is a need for knowledge for 
its own sake. Many animals are curious, but in them curiosity is a 
facet of adaptation. Man has a hunger to know. And to many a man, 
being endowed with the capacity to know, he has a duty to know. 
All knowledge, however small, however irrelevant to progress and 
well-being, is a part of the whole. It is of this the scientist 
partakes. To know the fly is to share a bit in the sublimity of 
Knowledge. That is the challenge and the joy of science (pp. 118-119).
</blockquote>

Children are naturally are curious, inquisitive, and exploratory of 
their environment. It is normal to want to know how things work and why 
the world is the way it is. At its most basic level, this is what 
science is all about. As Richard Feynman observed: "I've been caught, so 
to speak - like someone who was given something wonderful when he was a 
child, and he's always looking for it again. I'm always looking, like a 
child, for the wonders I know I'm going to find - maybe not every time, 
but every once in a while" (1988, p. 16). The most important question in 
education is this: what tools are children given to understand the 
world?
<p>On the most basic of levels we must think or die. Those who are alive 
are thinking and using reason to a greater or lesser extent. Those who 
use more reason, those who employ rational skepticism, will attain 
greater satisfaction because they understand the cause of their 
satisfaction. It cannot be otherwise. As Ayn Rand concluded in her 
magnum opus <em>Atlas Shrugged</em> (1957, p. 1012):</p>
<blockquote>Man cannot survive except by gaining knowledge, and reason is his 
only means to gain it . . . . Man's mind is his basic tool of 
survival. Life is given to him, survival is not. His body is given 
to him, its sustenance is not. His mind is given to him, its 
content is not. To remain alive, he must act, and before he can 
act he must know the nature and purpose of his action. He cannot 
obtain his food without a knowledge of food and of the way to 
obtain it. He cannot dig a ditch - or build a cyclotron - without 
a knowledge of his aim and of the means to achieve it. To remain 
alive, he must think.</blockquote>

Over three centuries ago the French philosopher and skeptic Ren&eacute; 
Descartes, after one of the most thorough skeptical purges in 
intellectual history, concluded that he knew one thing for certain: 
"Cogito ergo sum." "I think therefore I am."
<p>By a similar analysis, to be human is to think. Therefore, to 
paraphrase Descartes:</p>

<p><em>"Sum Ergo Cogito." 
"I Am Therefore I Think."</em></p>

<h1>RANDI AT CALTECH: A REPORT FROM THE PARANORMAL TRENCHES</h1>
<h2><a href="01.1.about-randi.html"> By James "The Amazing" Randi</a></h2>

I am in a very peculiar business. I appear on stages around the world as 
a conjurer. Now the American term for it is magician. It's not a good 
expression because if you look in the dictionary the strict definition 
of a magician is one who uses magic. And magic, at least by the 
definition I prefer from a leading dictionary, is the attempt to control 
nature by means of spells and incantations. Now, ladies and gentlemen, 
in my time, as you might have guessed, I have tried spells and 
incantations.  No good. You can spell and incant all you want; the lady 
will still be on the couch, waiting patiently to float into the air or 
will be imprisoned in the box with the saw blade descending upon her 
unprotected midriff, and in some danger of being severely scratched, if 
not worse! Spells and incantations don't work. You have to use 
skulduggery. And let me make it very clear what the magical trade - the 
conjuring trade - is with a precise definition. It is the approximation 
of the effect of a true magician using means of subterfuge and trickery. 
<p>The magician, in the American usage, is an actor playing the part of a 
wizard. We are entertainers.  I don't think that there are many folks - 
but there are some out there by David Copperfield's own admission to me 
- who still believe that they really can do the things they purport to 
do. After a magical performance we've all undergone the same experience, 
all of us in the trade; you get people coming to you afterwards and 
saying: "I really enjoyed what you did; thank you so much for coming." 
And you say, "Well, it's great to be here. I'm happy that you were 
pleased with it." Then they say, "You know, the business with the 
bottles that multiplied. Obviously, that's a trick. And the one where 
you did the thing with the rings and the ropes. That's a trick too. But 
the one where you told the lady what word she'd chosen out of the 
newspaper - that, of course, can't be a trick."  I'd say, "Yes, that's a 
trick, too, but it's disguised as a miracle of a semi-religious nature." 
And they wink at you and they say, "Sure." Then they walk away and tell 
their friends afterwards, "Well, he won't admit it, but we all know."</p>
<p>There is a hunger, a very strong hunger, within us all to believe 
there is something more than what the laws of nature permit. I'm not 
just saying audiences that watch the magician. I mean within us all. 
We'd like to have a certain amount of fantasy in our lives, but it's a 
very dangerous sort of temptation to immediately assume that it must be 
supernatural or occult or paranormal if we don't have an explanation for 
it. I can tell you that in my life I've spent a great deal of time 
investigating and observing and carefully noting and making use of 
psychology. I am not a psychologist; I have no academic credentials 
whatsoever, so I come to you today absolutely unencumbered by any 
responsibilities of that nature. There is no dean who will call me on 
the carpet tomorrow morning and say, "You shouldn't have said that." You 
see, I'm in the business of giving opinions from an uninformed point of 
view, except from the point of view of a skeptical person who knows how 
people's minds work and often don't work. </p>
<p>It was mentioned in the introduction to this talk that at the current 
rate of scientific growth, in a certain number of years scientists will 
consist of every human being on earth, as well as all the animals - the 
donkeys, the burros, the whole thing. Well, my friend David Alexander 
remarked to me, in a cruel aside, that even today certain parts of 
certain horses have become scientists. And that is quite true; I have 
met many of them and though they have Ph.D.s, you'd hardly know it. I've 
just come back from a project that's ongoing at the moment and I've seen 
that principle at work. I must share with you another thing in passing. 
I have a theory; this is only a theory, and it is at present unproven.  
But observations so far tend to support its possible validity, with my 
advance apologies to Ph.D.s in the room. I have a theory about Ph.D.s 
and the granting of the degree itself. I am outside the field, not an 
academic, so as a curious observer I have many times seen films of, and 
in a couple of cases actually attended ceremonies where Ph.D.s are 
created. They are created, you know. The Ph.D. itself is earned, of 
course, but then the person who has passed all the tests and done all 
the right things in the right way and has been approved doesn't become a 
Ph.D. until one significant moment where a roll of paper, usually with a 
red or a blue ribbon around it, is pressed into his or her hand. At that 
moment that person becomes a very special class of being known as Ph.D.</p>
<p>Now, I have noted at those ceremonies, and perhaps you have observed 
it as well that the man who gives out those rolls of paper wears gloves. 
Why? Why would he want to wear gloves? Is the paper dirty? I don't think 
so. Is there something about that roll of paper, or perhaps the ribbon, 
that he doesn't want to contaminate him, and he doesn't want to touch 
his skin? I'm going to postulate - just an idea - that perhaps there is 
a secret chemical that has been genetically engineered which is on the 
surface of that paper so that when the Ph.D. candidate receives that 
roll of paper this chemical is absorbed by the skin, goes into the 
bloodstream and is conducted directly to the brain. This is a very 
carefully engineered chemical which goes directly - please don't laugh; 
this is science - goes directly to the speech center of the brain and 
paralyzes the brain in such a way that two sentences from then on, in 
any given language, are no longer possible to be pronounced by that 
person. Those two sentences are, "I don't know" and "I was wrong".</p>
<p>I honestly don't know about that; however, my observations of the 
situation are that I have never heard any Ph.D. utter either one of 
those sentences. I have never heard them say, "I'd like to marry a 
lobster" either, but that doesn't mean they can't say it. But those two 
sentences never seem to pass their lips.</p>
<p>I am being exceedingly facetious, of course. I have every respect not 
only for science, but for those who pursue the various disciplines of 
science. It takes a great deal of courage, application, study, 
sacrifice, and in many cases, some outrageous attacks on your integrity 
and your ability in order to maintain a point of view in science which 
may or may not be popular. I have been with many prominent scientists 
who have, from time to time, had to stick their professional necks out, 
and sometimes their necks get pretty badly beaten up in the process. 
It's not an easy thing to speak against what is generally accepted.</p>
<p>What then is generally accepted? I'm afraid, due to the media impact 
on our civilization, that a great number of things are easily swallowed 
because they are repeated so often. They are endlessly presented to the 
public, and eventually make their way to the academic community as well. 
Any number of times I have spoken to scientists who, when I ask them a 
critical question about some belief in some sort of parapsychological, 
supernatural or occult claim, has said, "You know, I hear a good deal 
about it and Professor so-and-so did make a statement about it. Perhaps, 
Professor so-and-so, based upon the small amount of data which he has 
presently gathered, compared to what should be gathered, in order to 
establish a satisfactory statistical picture, an amount of data on which 
conclusions could be drawn by one of the various statistical pictures 
available to him, has come upon conclusions which are prematurely 
expressed. Therefore, furthermore, and moreover, on further examination 
. . . ." That's the academic's reply. When they ask me, I simply say, 
"In my layman's non-academic opinion, I think that Professor so-and-so 
is not rowing with both oars in the water." It's simple, direct, and an 
honest expression of my opinion.</p>
<p>I am presently faced with a situation, again unnamed, where I am 
going to have to show a number of dedicated, honest, hard-working people 
that they have made a colossal error of judgment. I have to do this in a 
resounding manner, simply because to not do so could result in a great 
deal of personal damage, grief, and considerable heartbreak and 
discomfort to a great number of people who are already laboring under 
certain disadvantages and burdens that they did not bring upon 
themselves. I hate to be so mysterious about it, but it is an ongoing 
work of investigation. I am not often involved in that serious a 
situation. Usually my circumstances are more open - I am looking into an 
astrologer's claims or into some sort of pseudoscientific thing. But I 
always have to remember an experience that occurred to me.</p>
<p>It is easy, when faced with an apparently supernatural phenomena, to 
say "I guess it's a ghost" or "It must be paranormal," or "It could be 
poltergeists," and we walk away from it because we can't or won't, look 
a little further into it. Some years ago, when I lived in New Jersey my 
house was a sort of a wayside stop for itinerant magicians, conjurers, 
mountebanks - various characters of ill repute who would come by to 
visit for awhile. One time I came home after a couple of days away, very 
tired, and came in on my foster son, Alexis, who was in the kitchen 
helping a couple of magicians drink up the beer. I walked in and said, 
"Guys, I'm very, very tired; I'm going to bed. I'll see you in the 
morning."</p>
<p>I guess they carried on until late that night. I fell asleep, woke up 
the next morning, came staggering into the kitchen in time to see them 
eating up more of my groceries in the form of breakfast at this time. I 
sat down, got a half cup of coffee into me and straightened up the 
table. Alexis looked at me and said, "What's with you?" I said, "I think 
last night I might have actually had a classic example of the O.B.E." 
That's the out-of-body experience. It means that somehow you find 
yourself out of your body and looking down on it or from a distance. 
Alexis looked at me and said, "Sure. You?"  I said, "Yes, I have to be 
honest. It appears to me as if I did undergo such an experience."</p>
<p>"OK, give us a description," they replied. The two magicians at the 
table leaned closer over their bacon and eggs and wanted to hear what I 
had to say. "Well, I remember waking up in the middle of the night - I 
couldn't get to sleep at first because I was so tired, so I turned on 
the television. The program went on and on and I eventually fell asleep. 
I remember waking up in the middle of the night, and I felt that I was 
spread-eagled against the ceiling of my bedroom, looking down at the 
bed.  Alice, my black cat, was curled up in a ball in the exact center 
of the bed so that I had to be way over to one side. And I was, of 
course, trying not to disturb the cat! As I was up against the ceiling I 
noticed that the room was lit in sort of a grayish light. I looked down 
toward the television set and saw nothing but static on the screen and 
heard nothing but white noise. What I saw was startling. I saw myself, 
in bed, scrunched over to one side, a chartreuse bedspread on it, with 
Alice the cat in the middle. I noted that as she opened her eyes they 
were green. It almost looked like two holes punched through her head. 
She looked at me and went, 'hmmph' and went right back to sleep."</p>
<p>Now that was a very strong experience for me. I really believed, from 
the evidence presented to me, that I had an out-of-body experience that 
matches the description that we've all heard about so many times. But, 
fortunately for me, I'm not really dead-set against having my belief 
structure disturbed or having new facts come in that would disturb my 
previous convictions. And, fortunately, I am able to tell you what 
actually happened. Alexis looked at me and said, "I've got two things to 
show you." He went to the foot of the stairs and came up with a big, 
transparent laundry bag. He had taken it half way down to the laundry 
room. He brought it all the way up the stairs, and inside noted sheets, 
pillowcases, and the chartreuse bedspread. He said, "That's been there 
since yesterday." The bedspread hadn't been on the bed last night! I 
dashed to the bedroom door, looked in, and the spread I used when the 
other one was in the laundry lay on the bed. They looked nothing alike. 
Alexis then called my attention to the patio, noting that he had put 
Alice outside yesterday afternoon because one of the magician guests was 
highly allergic to cats. She had remained outside, very unhappily, 
through the night and into this morning. She could not have been curled 
up in the middle of the bed last night.</p>
<p>It was a dream - a hallucination, if you will. I had two very good 
pieces of evidence that it could not have happened. That's important in 
that if I did not have one or both of those pieces of evidence, I would 
now have to say to you that, to the best of my knowledge, I had an
out-of-body experience. But, all the other out-of-body experiences we hear 
of, we have to wonder. Those folks are not quite as skeptical about the 
subject as I am, in most cases. If they don't have some convincing 
evidence to the contrary, what's to stop them from saying, "I'm 
absolutely certain I've had an out-of-body experience?" There is no 
other explanation for it except the possible and rather parsimonious 
conclusion that they were either dreaming or had a hallucination. It 
might have been a bad pork chop, for all we know. Please consider that 
carefully, and don't forget it, because it's a good example of how even 
the arch-skeptic could possibly have been taken in.</p>
<p>I have had a number of small experiences like that, including the 
d&eacute;j&agrave; vu type experiences that so many people have had. (I
love the line from the fellow who says, "I keep having the same
d&eacute;j&agrave; vu, over and over again.") But I have resisted the
temptation to merely say, "Well, at last I've got proof of it." I'm highly
skeptical, but what is that skepticism based on? If you're skeptical as
well, have you asked yourself, "Upon what do I base my skepticism?" Are
you just plain ornery? Do you just not want to go along with the status
quo? Do you know some people who believe in it who are really pretty dense
and you don't want to join their group?</p>
<p>You must have a reason, I think, for yourself and for others as to 
why you are skeptical. These things are not likely to be true; 
therefore, you need proof of them. We're not required to prove a 
negative; we can't do that. I can't prove telepathy doesn't exist. I 
remember getting a question years ago. A lady stood up in the audience 
and said, "Can you prove to me that ESP doesn't exist?" I said, "No, I 
can't." She sat down with her arms folded and replied "Ah ha." That was 
a victory for her. I went on to explain that I can't prove a negative. 
My question is, "Do you believe in it?" She said, "Absolutely." I asked 
if she could prove that it is so. She said, "Well, I'm quite convinced 
of it."</p>
<p>"That's not my question," I responded. "Can you prove that it is so? 
You're the one making the claim." We skeptics, as Michael Shermer 
clearly pointed out, are not in the business of debunking. If I were in 
the business of debunking, and I've often had that label pinned on me 
and I've always resented it and denied it - it means I would go into an 
investigation convinced that "this ain't so and I'm going to show you 
that it isn't." I'm not a lawyer; I don't have an advocacy position to 
take. I go into a situation as an investigator. To be perfectly fair, I 
can't prove a negative, but I go into this thing prepared to be shown. 
Am I prejudiced against it? Oh, yes! I have to admit that. But if you've 
been sitting by a chimney for 63 years on the evening of December 24 and 
a fat man in a red suit has never bounced down that chimney, you can 
say, "One hundred percent of my evidence shows me that this claim is not 
necessarily so. I cannot prove that it isn't, but it's not very likely 
to be true, based on what we know."</p>
<p>The Santa Claus example may seem trivial and a little inappropriate, 
but it is actually a good metaphor for so many paranormal and 
pseudoscientific claims. Another is flying reindeer. This one we can 
actually test. (Please don't tell the SPCA about this.) I don't really 
want to do the experiment, but let's walk through it as if I were doing 
it. It's a thought experiment. Let's select, by some randomizing 
process, a thousand reindeer. We'll number them and get them all 
together in a reindeer truck (I don't know what you put reindeer in) and 
take them to the top of the World Trade Center in New York. We are going 
to test whether or not reindeer can fly. You have your reindeer all 
lined up, a video-camera operator standing by, lots of pads of paper and 
pens at work. The time is now ten past ten in the morning. OK, first 
experiment. Number one reindeer, please, up to the edge. Camera going?  
Good. Push. Uhh, write down "no". Really NO! Number two. Push. I don't 
know what the result of the experiment will be; I suspect strongly what 
it will be, based upon my meagre knowledge of the aerodynamics of the 
average reindeer, though I'm not an expert on it. But based upon 
previous accounts of what reindeer can and cannot do, I think we are 
going to end up with a pile of very unhappy and broken reindeer at the 
foot of the World Trade Center. And probably a couple of policemen will 
be standing by a squad car saying, "I don't know, but here comes another 
one."</p>
<p>What have we proven with this experiment? Have we proven that reindeer 
cannot fly? No, of course not. We have only shown that on this occasion, 
under these conditions of atmospheric pressure, temperature, radiation, 
at this position geographically, at this season, that these 1000 
reindeer either could not or chose not to fly. (If the second is the 
case, then we certainly know something of the intelligence of the 
average reindeer.) However, we have not, and can not, prove the negative 
that reindeer cannot fly, technically, rationally, and philosophically 
speaking. People will often look at this example and say, "Well, how 
many reindeer would you have to test?" I'm not going to get into the 
statistics of the argument; I will only tell you that you cannot prove a 
negative. The other folks who claim that something is so are required to 
prove it. It is what we call the burden of proof. In this case, if it's 
so it's very easy to prove. Just show me one flying reindeer. Then they 
rationalize, saying, "Oh, no. It's only the eight tiny reindeer that 
live at the North Pole who can, and will, on the evening of December 24, 
fly to do that specific job." In that case you have to throw up your 
hands and say, "Well, I don't think your hypothesis is very testable." 
Don't spin your wheels!</p>
<p>Thought experiments like this one only go so far. As an example of a 
real experiment testing unusual claims, I just came back from Hungary 
where I was invited to Budapest by the Academy of Sciences. They are 
very concerned about the fact that now that many of these countries are 
freed from the burdensome and onerous yoke of Communism and have the 
freedom to receive all kinds of scientific information in the form of 
journals and lectures, nonsense comes in as well. The astrologers, the 
faith healers, the ESP artists, the people with the pendulums, the water 
dowsers - they're lined up and pouring across the border because they 
see a new market. The scientists of Hungary were concerned about this. A 
well-known member of parliament who is also a well-respected brain 
scientist of international repute, said to me, "Mr. Randi, have you seen 
any of the publicity on the magnetic ladies?" I had.</p>
<p>In case you're not familiar with the magnetic ladies of Hungary, I 
will relieve you of that ignorance immediately. You may have seen a 
picture that made all the wire services in this country last year, of 
the magnetic man from (then) Leningrad. There was a picture of a middle-
aged man standing like this, naked from the belt up, with a flatiron 
stuck here, a hammer there, nails, razor blades - all kinds of metal 
clinging to his body. The caption said that he attracted these things. 
They just jumped, willy nilly, onto his body. He was somehow magnetic. 
I'll bet his wristwatch was a mess! Don't bring him near your computers! 
I can just imagine him going through a steel door. Bam! Right into it!</p>
<p>Well, I took that with the proverbial grain of salt about the size of 
a basketball, and just put it in the scrapbook and forgot about it. But 
the professor asked me about the magnetic ladies of Hungary, and he 
said, "Their reputation is such that objects, not necessarily metallic 
ones, cling to their bodies with such tenacity that a strong man cannot 
tear them loose." Now, wait a minute!  Suppose you have some instant 
glue, and we take a tennis ball and stick it on the lady's neck, on the 
side. If a strong man can't tear it off, he's going to tear her skin off 
- or her head! Something has to give! My scientist friend and sponsor of 
this trip looked at me and said, "How can they make claims like this?" I 
said, "Well, show me the magnetic ladies." He said that the following 
day, after the press conference, they were scheduled to arrive. I could 
hardly wait.</p>
<p>One of the parapsychologists had suggested that he could bring me 
some instrumentation for detection of their magnetism. He promised that 
we'd take the two ladies down to the laboratory, (hand in hand, clinging 
to one another, no doubt). I declined to go to the laboratory because 
the laymen reading the report in the newspaper wouldn't understand 
"laboratory". What are you going to do? Put a cyclotron on her ear? No. 
I equipped myself with a scientific device and I went along.  The device 
was called a compass. It's a scientific instrument and an easy way to 
perform the test. If a woman is magnetic, the compass is going to point 
right at her. The two ladies showed up. I told my friend in advance that 
he must understand that the claim is one thing; the event itself will 
often be something totally different. It won't be half as entertaining 
or amusing, or true, as the actual demonstration.</p>
<p>One lady literally did this: she took her wristwatch off her wrist 
and did this. [Randi put his watch on his forehead and it stays there 
without falling.] "How do you explain that?," she said. I looked at both 
ladies, who were wearing very greasy, high gloss makeup. It was 
obviously sticky, mixed with a little perspiration. She said, "We have 
no explanation for it." I said I didn't find it terribly difficult to 
explain.</p>
<p>The second lady had an even better demonstration. She took a small 
ceramic saucer from her purse, stuck it on her forehead, where it 
remained. "And how do you explain that?" she parroted the other woman. 
I pulled it off her forehead, and stuck it on the foreheads of the first 
four people standing on my right. It stuck very effectively to the 
foreheads of all of them! Then we tested under controlled conditions. 
(By the way, the compass test failed miserably; it pointed to North, 
obstinately refusing to point at them.) I asked for soap and water and, 
through the interpreter, asked the first lady if I could wash her 
forehead to remove the makeup and any perspiration that might be there. 
She informed me that if she washed her forehead it wouldn't work because 
water is absorbed into the skin and water and electiricity, or 
magnetism, don't mix. She denied that that would be a satisfactory test, 
as did the second lady, and they left. "You've learned your first lesson 
in the scientific investigation of unusual claims," I told the 
Professor. "Don't start to give theories on how it might work until 
you've seen whether it meets the claims of the newspaper account, or is 
really something much less impressive.</p>
<p>To be fair to these women, I can see how that account might have 
ended up in a newspaper. I'm sure those ladies didn't say to the 
newspaper reporters, "A strong man can't pull it away from me." But a 
reporter is a human being and maybe his story doesn't look all that 
great when he writes that things cling to their bodies. Then perhaps he 
thinks: "Um, how about 'with such tenacity that a strong man can't pull 
them loose'"?  Now, he has a story! What I'm saying is that the media 
are as much to blame for the spread of nonsense and pseudoscience as the 
claimants themselves. For example, a few years ago the <em>New York Daily 
News</em>, on page three where they put the "heavy news" and sensational 
stuff, announced that a student at Duke University had successfully in 
great detail described not only an aircraft accident 24 hours in advance 
of the event, he even gave the number of people who would be killed.  He 
was short by only two. He even described the location of the crash in 
the Canary Islands. That was picked up by news services and was featured 
on television programs; it was on every newscast for quite some time. It 
was received by the press as a genuine example of prophecy, and the 
director of the program in which this was involved at Duke University 
actually made a statement that he had a sealed envelope 24 hours before 
in his safe that was not touched by this gentlemen until after the 
episode had taken place. It was allegedly torn open at that time and it 
contained the prediction.</p>
<p>To explain this phenomena I will take you into a different world, for 
just a moment, so you will understand something. Magicians know how this 
young man could very easily have done this trick. I won't go into all 
the details; you can imagine some of them yourself. But the effect is 
exactly as described - a sealed signed envelope, put into a safe, later 
carefully opened. Inside you either find a tape cassette or a sealed 
letter with all kinds of security on it, signed, maybe genuinely 
notarized, as of the day before. It contains the prediction. A miracle 
of a semi-religious nature? No, it's a trick. It can be done by any good 
magician.</p>
<p>Now, let us return to article in the <em>Daily News</em>, first edition. It 
came out in the afternoon. It had the story on page 3, and a box in the 
middle of it describing the mechanics of how it had been locked up in a 
safe and it had a final paragraph which quoted the student at Duke 
University who made the prediction with this disclaimer: "It's all part 
of the publicity for my magic show, which is happening tomorrow night. 
Don't take it seriously." The second and third editions of the <em>Daily 
News</em> had everything except that one sentence.</p>
<p>Another example of how the media distorts claims comes from a young 
fellow who lived a few doors down from me when I was living in Rumson, 
New Jersey. He was one of the local characters who did adventurous 
things like going out on rafts and sailboats. I thought he was a nice 
kid. One day on the front page of the <em>New York Times</em> there was a 
little box showing a map of the Bermuda Triangle with a Maltese Cross on 
it. The headline read: "Rumson boy lost at sea in Bermuda Triangle." I 
read the short article,  continued on another page, which said he had 
taken off in his one-man sailboat, sailed into the Triangle carrying a 
radio transmitter, and hadn't been heard from since. The Coast Guard was 
searching for him. No sooner had I finished reading this and had called 
some friends in New York to tell them about it, I went out to pick up 
the mail and to my shock there was this kid waving hello to me. He was 
perfectly all right! I said to him, "You're in the <em>Times</em> this 
morning." He said, "Yeah, they picked me up late last night and they 
brought me in. They want me to be observed in the hospital, but I feel 
perfectly all right. We had a bit of a storm; I lost the radio overboard 
and they finally picked me up very, very early, around 2:30 this morning 
and they flew me in."</p>
<p>Though the first story made a big splash, the followup never appeared 
in the <em>New York Times</em> or any other paper of which I know. It's still 
part of the mythology about the Bermuda Triangle. So far as we know, 
from reading accounts that were published in newspapers, that kid is 
still someplace out in a sailboat in the Bermuda Triangle or perhaps 
taken off to Mars. You've got to learn that newspaper editors and 
reporters are subject to the same kinds of pressures that we all are. We 
all want something successful. Often the choice is between a story and a 
non-story. We have to realize that we cannot depend on the media to 
always to represent the facts as they actually are. That's not a great 
deal of news to you, but you must bear it in mind at all times. Be 
careful about accepting what appears in print; don't let them say to 
you, "They put it in the paper; it must be so," or "Someone wrote a book 
on it. It must be so."</p>
<p>Furthermore, books are often published which, before they actually 
reach the stands and are on sale, have been completely refuted because 
they are based on false information. Do they immediately withdraw them? 
No. I'll give you a good example. There's a book called <em>Learning to Use 
Extrasensory Perception</em>. Its published by Charles Tart, a respected 
psychologist at University of California, Davis. I heard Dr. Tart give a 
talk in Casper, Wyoming. I'm going to tell you exactly what he said and 
see if your reaction is the same as mine. I recorded it on tape so I 
know exactly the words he said; this is not a case of interpretation or 
faulty recollection. He said, in speaking to the audience:</p>
<blockquote>There was a time, years ago, when I was highly skeptical of any 
paranormal claims of any kind. One of the things that convinced me 
that there must be something to this is a strange experience that 
I personally went through. It was wartime. I was at Berkeley, 
California, and everybody was working overtime. We worked until 
very late hours of the night and the young lady who was my 
assistant at the time worked with me until very late this one 
night. She finally went home; I went home. Then the very next day 
she came in, all excited. She reported this event. It was wartime; 
they did work overtime. They often were very, very tired when they 
went home. It was understandable they would fall into a deep sleep 
and get as much sleep as they possibly could during the night. She 
reported that during this night she had suddenly sat bolt upright 
in her bed, convinced that something terrible had happened. "I had 
a terrible sense of foreboding," she said, but she did not know 
what had happened. "I immediately swung out of bed and went over 
to the window and looked outside to see if I could see anything 
that might have happened like an accident. I was just turning away 
from the window and suddenly the window shook violently. I 
couldn't understand that. I went back to bed, woke up the next 
morning and listened to the radio." A munitions ship at Port 
Chicago had exploded. It literally took Port Chicago off the map. 
It levelled the entire town and over 300 people were killed. 
Whether it was an accident or sabotage, no one ever found out. She 
said she had sensed the moment when all these people were snuffed 
out in this mighty explosion. How would she have suddenly become 
terrified, jumped out of bed, gone to the window, and then - from 
35 miles away, the shock wave had reached Berkeley and shook the 
window?</blockquote>

Indeed, she remembered looking at the clock to see what time it was - 
right to the minute. Well, when I heard this, I said to myself, "There's 
something wrong here." I see a couple of smiles around the audience; 
maybe you've spotted the same thing I did. I had a geologist friend 
sitting three or four seats away; I handed him a note. He winked, 
smiled, got up and left the room. He came back in, handed it to me, and 
it just said on it, "8 seconds." What question did I ask him?  [Answer 
from audience: What is the difference in time of propagation over a 
distance of 35 miles of a shock wave through the air, compared to a 
shock wave through the ground?  The difference is 8 seconds.]  So 8 
seconds before that window shook, she had been startled by the room 
itself shaking, not by the airwave, but by the groundwave. My theory is 
this: the groundwave which shook the bed startled her, she swung out of 
bed, went over to the window, looked outside, didn't see anything, went 
to turn away from the window and suddenly the pane shook in front of 
her. 
<p>The next morning I went to Professor Tart where he was having 
breakfast by himself. I had known him through correspondence and phone 
conversations but had never met him personally. I went over, introduced 
myself, sat down for a moment and gave him this bit of theory. I said 
there would be 8 seconds difference in the time. He didn't look up from 
his scrambled eggs for the longest time. Finally, when he did, he smiled 
and said, "Mr. Randi, that may be the explanation that you prefer." I 
think he had just decided that he wasn't going to entertain that idea 
very solidly. But I don't know that he ever made that statement 
subsequent to that, so maybe he did come to the conclusion that what I 
offered as an explanation was more likely to be true. But it is so 
typical of the field! Again, I'm involved in some stuff that I can't 
tell you about, and I apologize for that, where I have a number of 
prominent scientists who are absolutely ignoring, refusing to look at 
very good evidence in this case that I'm investigating. They can come up 
with rationalizations for it that you wouldn't believe, unless you've 
been through this process before. It is incredible how they can ignore 
good evidence to show that there is a prosaic, rational, and very 
probable explanation for what they are observing.</p>
<p>I want to close this presentation with some parallel examples of 
scientific claims that turned out to be so much nonsense. Let's go back 
to 1903 in France. You may have heard of this, if not it really is 
something you should look up. A prominent scientist - a physicist named 
Rene Blondlot - startled the world of science with his announcement of 
the discovery of N-rays. A very well respected man who had won many 
prizes in science and justifiably so, he was doing experiments by 
today's standards that were very simple - such as finding the speed of 
electricity in a conductor. It sounds easy today, but in those days it 
was a very sophisticated experiment and not all that easily done. 
Blondlot was in his 70s at the time when he discovered N-rays, named 
after the town of Nancy, where he was head of the Department of Physics 
at the University of Nancy.</p>
<p>What were N-rays? N-rays were allegedly radiation exhibiting 
impossible properties emitted by all substances with the exception of 
green wood (wood not dried out) and anesthetized metal. (Metal that had 
been dipped in ether or cholorophorm did not give out N-rays!) Within a 
matter of six to eight months of the announced discovery of N-rays, 30 
papers had come in from all over Europe confirming the existence of N-
rays. Reports were published in journals despite the fact that there 
were many laboratories reporting failure after failure in replicating 
the results. Such acceptance was understandable considering that X-rays, 
which also exhibited unsuspected properties, were by then firmly 
established.</p>
<p>What Blondlot had was a basic spectroscope with a prism (not glass, 
but aluminum) on the inside, and a thread. The narrow stream of N-rays 
was refracted through the prism and coming out produced a spectrum on a 
field. The N-rays were reported to be invisible, except when viewed when 
they hit a treated thread (for example, treated with calcium sulfide). 
They moved the thread across the gap where the N-rays came through and 
when it was illuminated that was reported as the detection of the N-
rays.</p>
<p>Before long N-rays were established as factual. <em>Nature</em> magazine was 
skeptical of the N-rays since laboratories in England and Germany were 
unable to find them. (Germany had just discovered X-rays the decade 
before and the French were annoyed that they didn't have a ray.) 
<em>Nature</em> sent an American physicist named Robert W. Wood from Johns 
Hopkins University to investigate. Now, I've been accused of skulduggery 
in my time, but what Wood did was brilliant. When no one was looking he 
removed the prism from the N-ray detection device and put it in his 
pocket. Without the prism the machine could not possibly work because it 
was dependent on the refraction of N-rays by the aluminium-treated 
prism. Yet, when the assistant conducted the next experiment he found N-
rays! He swore they were there.</p>
<p>When the experiment was over Wood knew it was really over. He was 
prepared to make his report, and when he went to replace the prism back 
in the machine, one of the other assistants saw him do this and thought 
he was actually removing it, and he decided to show Wood up. Thinking 
Wood had removed the prism (when he had actually put it back), he set up 
the experiment, could find no lines, and opened the box to show that the 
prism was not there and to his dismay, there it was! The whole incident 
blew up. Papers were withdrawn, those that were in the mail were 
retracted, and N-rays disappeared from the scene.</p>
<p>How did this happen? How did over 30 papers get published? Not 
because the scientists who wrote the papers were stupid. Not because 
they were lying. But because they were deceiving themselves. Irving 
Klotz made this observation in <em>Scientific American</em>:</p>
<blockquote>According to Blondlot and his disciples, then, it was the 
sensitivity of the observer rather than the validity of the 
phenomena that was called into question by criticisms such as 
Wood's, a point of view that will not be unfamiliar to those who 
have followed more recent controversies concerning extrasensory 
perception. By 1905, when only French scientists remained in the 
N-ray camp, the argument began to acquire a somewhat chauvinistic 
aspect. Some proponents of N-rays maintained that only the Latin 
races possessed the sensitivities (intellectual as well as 
sensory) necessary to detect manifestations of the rays. It was 
alleged that Anglo-Saxon powers of perception were dulled by 
continual exposure to fog and Teutonic ones blunted by constant 
ingestion of beer.</blockquote>
   
Yet science does not always learn from these mistakes. Visiting Nancy 
recently and speaking on the subject of pseudoscience, I discussed this 
example and though I was in the city that gave the name to N-rays, no 
one in the audience had ever heard of them, or of Blondlot, not even the 
professors from the University of Nancy!
<p>Now let's go to modern Germany, after the fall of Communism, and 
compare N-rays to the newly discovered "E-rays." They are actually 
called Erdestrallen, or "Earth-rays," but I've gotten the media all over 
the world to call them E-rays, a sort of parallel to N-rays. E-rays are 
even sillier than the N-rays. What are they? First of all they cannot be 
detected by any known means, except by water dousers. They cause cancer. 
They supposedly come from the center of the Earth. The West German 
government spent over 400,000 marks, or about $200,000, to pay dowsers 
to go around to hospitals that were federally funded and federal office 
buildings to move beds and desks that were in the way of these deadly E-
rays. I offered to go over for nothing and conduct a very simple two-part
test: 1. Can one dowser find the same spot twice? and 2. Can two 
dowsers can find the same spot once? I told them about this and their 
response was,"We don't need to do the experiment because we know dowsing 
works. It's been around since the Middle Ages and the historical 
tradition validates its truthfulness."</p>
<p>I challenge all the dowsers in a similar way. Since 94 percent of the 
Earth's surface has water within drillable distance my challenge is to 
find a dry spot! They don't want to do it. Why? Because they only have a 
six percent chance of success. Dowsing is an idiomotor reaction that is 
very deceptive. It is an unconscious motion that you cannot detect and 
it looks for all the world like some mysterious force.</p>
<p>In a similar fashion, a few years ago I was in France investigating 
the results of experiments done by Jacques Benveniste on water with 
memory. He managed to get his article published in <em>Nature</em>, who put a 
disclaimer in the middle of the paper that perhaps "vigilant members of 
the scientific community with a flair for picking holes in other 
people's work may be able to suggest further tests of the validity of 
the conclusions." <em>Nature</em> sent a team of investigators over to his 
laboratory, of which I was a part. [The other two were John Maddox and 
Walter W. Stewart.] We showed that there were serious problems with the 
protocol, as well as the fudging of data. When controls were tightened, 
the experimenter could not replicate the results.</p>
<p>Then there is the theory of homeopathy born approximately 220 years 
ago, the brainchild of one Samuel Hahnemann. Medicine was in its 
infancy. Poor people could not afford doctors and recovered more often 
than the aristocracy who received all sorts of substances, which often 
killed them. Samuel Hahnemann gave sick poor people water, which was 
suppose to contain a curative agent. Since these people did not go to 
doctors, they tended to survive, and this supported his belief in the 
curative power of his special water.</p>
<p>The first principle of homeopathy is that an extract of some 
substance in water will help cure you. The second principle is that an 
attenuated, or diluted solution will work even better. How diluted were 
these? If you take a solution and dilute it with 10 parts of water for 
every one part of itself, you've got what is called a "one solution." If 
you take one part of that and put it in 10 parts of water, now one part 
in 100, it's called a "two solution." If you have a "five solution," you 
have one part in 100,000. When you get to "Avogadro's limit" there is a 
chance of there being one molecule in the solution. One more dilution 
and you have one chance in 10 of there being one molecule in the 
solution. Well, the homeopathy people start off with a solution of 10 to 
the power of 50 (a one followed by 50 zeros)! Since there are 10 to the 
power of 23 stars in the known universe, that's what I call dilute. But 
that's nothing. They go all the way to 10 to the power of 1500!!!</p>
<p>That is so diluted that I could not conceive of what 10 to the 1500 
really means, so I called Martin Gardner and  asked for an example with 
which to illustrate it. He called me back and said that an equivalent is 
to take one grain of rice, crush it up in a teaspoon and dissolve that 
powder in a sphere of water the size of the solar system, then repeat 
that process two billion times!! (The technical problems of mixing such 
a solution are obvious!)</p>
<p>The critical point of homeopathy - the point of all this diluting - 
is that every molecule of water that comes into contact with the 
homeopathy water retains the memory of that special water! Thus a little 
substance can go a long way. I have a simple question from a layman's 
perspective. Since water has been around for "billions and billions of 
years," in this process it must have come into contact with every 
organic and inorganic molecule on Earth. That being the case, why not 
just give the patient ordinary tap water?</p>
<p>In fact, these homeopathic waters are so diluted that the homeopathy 
doctors and scientists can't even tell the difference between the water 
with iron and the water with gold. Come on folks, let's get real. There 
is no evidence that this stuff works, yet people go right on believing 
anyway. Here's a typical response, this from a letter written by Boaz 
Robinzon of the Faculty of Agriculture: "I want you to know that no 
matter what the <em>Nature</em> investigating committee has written, I am still 
confident that the phenomenon observed is a real and reproducible one 
and it is only a matter of time until we shall be proven right."</p>
<p>That's a classic example of someone who does not wish to face 
reality. I've been going around the world telling people to get real for 
years. That's the peculiar business that I'm in. I shouldn't have to be 
in that business but someone has to do it. Will it ever end? Probably 
not, but perhaps with the efforts of the skeptics and scientists we can 
"dilute" it a little!</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<P>
Recent developments in modern cosmology have been seized upon
to provide scientific support for the notion of intelligent design
to the universe. The latest version of the argument from design
is constructed around the so-called anthropic coincidences (Carter,
1974, 1983; Barrow and Tipler, 1986; Davies, 1982; Gribbin and
Rees, 1989). Here the claim is made that the values of fundamental
constants of nature are incredibly fine-tuned for the production
of life-perhaps even human life. This fine tuning is said to be
far too unlikely to have been accidental and that the only reasonable
conclusion is intelligent design, with human life as the intent.
Holmes Rolston, for example, in <EM>The Christian Century</EM> called
it &quot;Shaken Atheism&quot; (1986), Sharon Begley in <EM>Newsweek</EM>
described it as &quot;Science and the Sacred&quot; (1994), while
Robert Wright asked in <EM>Time</EM>, &quot;What does science tell
us about God?&quot; (1992). 
<H3><CENTER>Tuned For Life</CENTER></H3>
<P>
No doubt the universe would look quite different with the tiniest
variation of the basic constants of physics. A slight difference
in the strength of gravity, the charge of the electron, or the
mass of the neutron, and life as we know it would not exist. The
human race could not have evolved in a universe with different
constants. Those who promote the notion of intelligent design
think they have found confirmation in the way the universe seems
to be exquisitely balanced on the tip of a needle for the purpose,
they argue, of producing us.
<P>
As yet no theory, including the currently highly successful Standard
Model of elementary particles and forces, predicts the values
of the fundamental constants of the universe. None is able to
specify such basic facts about the universe as why the proton
has the mass it does, or why the hydrogen atom has the size it
does. In the Standard Model, the basic constants of the universe
must still be put in by hand. No known first principle prevents
any of these constants from taking on a random value from zero
to infinity.
<P>
Several physical constants have values that one would not expect
from naive arguments of symmetry or ideas about the unity of phenomena.
Recent developments in particle physics suggest that all the fundamental
forces of nature were unified as a single force in the extremely
high energy of the early moments of the big bang. Today the forces
are no longer identical and the huge differences between force
strengths that we now measure are difficult to explain. For example,
the ratio of strength of the electric and gravitational forces
in an atom is 10<SUP>39</SUP>. That is, gravity and the electromagnetic
force differ by 39 orders of magnitude. For later purposes, I
will call this large number N1.
<P>
In the 19th century, the electric and magnetic forces were found
to be different aspects of the same basic electromagnetic force.
This unification occurred despite the fact that the magnetic force
on a charged particle is normally much smaller than the electric
force.
<P>
In the 1980s, electromagnetism and the weak nuclear force were
found to be different aspects of the same basic electroweak force.
This also came about in the face of the large difference between
force strengths observed in the laboratory. In this and the previous
examples, the differences in the observed strengths of unified
forces are explained in a natural way. When and if gravity is
unified with the other forces, its comparative weakness may be
shown to be similarly natural. Or it may be accidental.
<P>
Starting with Hermann Weyl in 1919, many have speculated about
the large size of the dimensionless number N1 and its possible
connection with other large numbers in cosmology and microphysics.
For example, the ratio of a typical stellar lifetime to the time
for light to traverse the radius of a proton is another dimensionless
number, N2 =10<SUP>39</SUP>, which is the same order of magnitude
as N1. This was the first of what are now called the anthropic
coincidences.
<P>
Most physicists greeted the N1 = N2 &quot;coincidence&quot; with
the same Bronx cheer, &quot;pbzzzpht,&quot; that they give to
new interpretations of quantum mechanics. It seems like nothing
more than numerology. Look around at enough numbers and you are
bound to find some that appear connected (Gardner, 1991).
<P>
In 1961, however, R. Dicke argued that N1 is necessarily large
in order that the lifetime of main sequence stars be sufficient
to generate heavy chemical elements such as carbon. Furthermore,
N1 must be of the same order of N2 in any universe with heavy
elements. If the gravitational attraction in stars were comparable
in strength to the electric repulsion between protons, stars would
collapse long before nuclear processes could build up the heavier
chemical elements from the original hydrogen and deuterium (heavy
hydrogen). The formation of chemical complexity is only possible
in a universe of great age.
<P>
Biological life needs time to evolve, a stable source of energy
over that time, and raw material from which to build complex structures.
That raw material includes carbon and other heavy elements to
provide the diversity needed for the building of proficient organic
systems. While hydrogen, helium, and lithium were readily synthesized
in the first few minutes following the big bang, heavier nuclei
could not appear until much later, after they were synthesized
inside stars and released into space upon the explosive demise
of these stars. The existence of elements heavier than lithium
in our universe depends on what also appears to be some highly
unlikely coincidences.
<P>
Billions of years were needed for stars to form, to burn all their
hydrogen fuel while manufacturing heavier elements, and finally
to explode as supernovae, spraying their atoms into space. Once
in space, these elements cooled and accumulated into planets.
Billions of additional years were needed for at least one star
to provide a stable output of energy so that one of its planets
could develop life.
<P>
In a debate on the existence of God held at the University of
Hawaii on April 13, 1994, Christian theologian William Lane Craig
was asked from the audience how he could believe that human beings
have a special place in a universe that is so enormous and so
old compared to humankind. His answer was essentially that the
universe had to be very big and very old to produce us! Paraphrasing
Craig's answer, all the billions and billions of stars and galaxies
that spread over billions of light years in billions of years
were put there so that the chemistry needed for life and human
beings had time to evolve (Craig, 1990, 1992). My response: Why
not cockroaches?
<P>
The element-synthesizing processes in stars depend sensitively
on the properties and abundance of deuterium and helium produced
in the early universe. Deuterium would not exist if the neutron-proton
mass difference were just slightly different from its actual value.
The relative abundance of hydrogen and helium also depends strongly
on this parameter.
<P>
The hydrogen-helium abundance also requires a delicate balance
of the relative strengths of the gravitational and the weak nuclear
interaction. A slightly stronger weak force and the universe would
be 100 percent hydrogen, since all the neutrons in the early universe
would then have decayed. A slightly weaker weak force and few
neutrons would decay before being bound up with protons in helium
nuclei where insufficient energy prevents their decay. All the
protons would also be bound up, leading to a universe that was
100 percent helium. Neither of these extremes would have allowed
for the existence of stars and life based on chemistry.
<P>
The electron also enters into the tightrope act needed to produce
the heavier elements. Because the electron mass is less than the
neutron-proton mass difference, a free neutron can decay into
a proton, electron and neutrino. If this were not the case, the
neutron would be stable and most of the protons and electrons
in the early universe would have combined to form neutrons, leaving
little hydrogen to act as the main component and fuel of stars.
It is also rather convenient that the neutron is heavier than
the proton, but not so much heavier that neutrons cannot be bound
in nuclei. The evolution of life on earth thus depends critically
on these relative force strengths and mass differences. With the
slightest change of these values, the variety and diversity of
the chemical elements would not exist. In their tome, <EM>The Anthropic
Cosmological Principle</EM>, John D. Barrow and Frank J. Tipler
have gone to great lengths in seeking many similar connections
-- some quite remarkable, others a bit strained -- between the
physical parameters of our universe and the formation of complex,
low energy material structures (1986).
<P>
Carbon appears to be the chemical element best suited to act as
the building block for the type of complex molecular systems that
develop lifelike qualities. Even today, new materials assembled
from carbon atoms exhibit remarkable, unexpected properties, from
superconductivity to ferromagnetism. However, it is carbon chauvinism
to assume that only carbon life is possible. We can imagine life
based on silicon or other elements chemically similar to carbon,
but these would still require cooking in stars. Hydrogen, helium,
and lithium, which were synthesized in the big bang, are all chemically
too simple to be assembled into diverse structures.
<P>
Furthermore, it seems like molecular chauvinism to rule out other
forms of matter in the universe as building blocks of complex
systems. While atomic nuclei, for example, do not exhibit the
diversity and complexity seen in the way atoms assemble into molecular
structures, perhaps they might be able to do so in a universe
with different properties. Sufficient complexity and long life
are probably the only ingredients needed for a universe to produce
life. Carbon may be unlikely, but as I will show, long life and
complexity are not. 
<H3><CENTER>Fingers and TOEs </CENTER></H3>
<P>
The anthropic coincidences resonate with the mystical notions
that human existence is deeply connected to the very nature of
the universe. However, from the time of Copernicus, cosmology
has been based on the principle that the universe is indifferent
to humanity and human concerns. Most physicists are not quite
ready to give up on the Copernican principle. They believe it
should be possible to derive the values of the fundamental constants
of nature from a yet-undiscovered Theory-of-Everything (TOE) that
arises from a set of principles that operates at the level of
subnuclear particles, not biological cells.
<P>
It is very unlikely that a direct causal connection will ever
be found between fundamental processes that apply at subnuclear
scales and the details of complex structures on the macroscopic
scale of everyday life. I doubt if any TOE will tell us why we
have five toes on each foot, or why the three-toed sloth has three.
Most of the properties of the macroscopic world were not predetermined
by events in the early big bang, but emerged by the processes
of chance and natural selection.
<P>
As pointed out by Stephen Jay Gould (1989), rewinding the tape
of evolution and playing it back again would have infinitesimal
probability of once again producing Homo sapiens. I can conceive
the possibility that some or all of the constants of physics also
took on the values they did by chance and, like evolution, were
not designed by either a Creator or physical law.
<P>
The chance that any initially random set of constants would correspond
to the set of values they now hold in our universe is very small.
Cosmologist Roger Penrose (1989) has calculated that the probability
of our universe is one part in (10<SUP>10</SUP>)<SUP>123</SUP>.
In The Emperor's New Mind, Penrose has a cartoon of the Creator
pointing a finger toward an &quot;absurdly tiny volume in the
phase space of possible universes&quot; to produce the universe
in which we live. This has given comfort to believers. In the
Hawaii debate mentioned above, theologian Craig argued that this
unimaginable low probability illustrates the need for a Creator,
because the universe could not have happened by chance. Most of
the audience greeted that with enthusiastic nods. Only a few of
us sat there with puzzled looks on our faces.
<P>
But claiming our that universe is a miracle because of its unlikelihood,
calculated after the fact, is like the TV ads for publisher sweepstakes
that sing &quot;Miracles can happen, can happen to you&quot; if
you simply send in your entry. It may seem like a miracle to the
person who wins ten million dollars, but it was a certainty that
someone would win. It is like calling the sunrise each morning
a miracle.
<P>
Every human being on earth is the product of a highly elaborate
combination of genes that would be a very unlikely outcome of
a random toss. Think of what an unlikely being you are, the product
of so many chance encounters between your male and female ancestors.
What if your great-great-great grandmother had not survived that
childhood illness? What if your grandfather had been killed by
a stray bullet in the war, before he met your grandmother? Despite
all those other possibilities, you still exist. If you ask, after
the fact, what is the probability for your particular set of genes
existing, the answer is 100 percent! Certainty!
<P>
Similarly, the probability for the universe we live in existing
as it does, having the values of the fundamental constants that
it has, is not one in (10<SUP>10</SUP>)<SUP>123</SUP>. It is 100
percent! Some universe happened, and it happened to be the one
we have.
<P>
Still, it is argued that if a universe were created with random
values of the physical constants, a universe with no life would
have almost certainly been the result. Of course, no one would
then be around to talk about it and the fact is we are here and
talking about it.
<P>
Unfortunately, we have no way of talking about it with strict
rationality. We do not have enough information in the form of
examples of other universes to use as data to draw reasonable
conclusions.
<P>
One way to &quot;explain&quot; the anthropic coincidences within
the framework of existing knowledge of physics and cosmology is
to view our universe as just one of a very large number of mini-universes
in an infinite super-universe (Linde, 1994). Each mini-universe
has a different set of constants and physical laws. Some might
have life of different form than ours, others might have no life
at all or something even more complex that we cannot imagine.
Obviously we are in one of those universes with life. (Incidentally,
this multi-universe picture is often confused with Hugh Everett's
1957 &quot;many-worlds interpretation&quot; of quantum mechanics.
They are not at all related.)
<P>
Several commentators have argued that a many-universes cosmology
violates Occam's razor. I beg to differ. The entities that the
law of parsimony forbids us from multiplying beyond necessity
are theoretical hypotheses, not universes. Though the atomic theory
multiplied the number of bodies we consider in solving a thermodynamic
problem by 10<SUP>24</SUP> or so per gram, it did not violate
Occam's razor. Rather it provided a simpler, more powerful exposition
of the rules that were obeyed by thermodynamic systems.
<P>
Similarly, if the many-universes cosmology provides an explanation
for the origin of our universe that does not require the highly
nonparsimonious introduction of a supernatural element that has
heretofore not been required to explain any observations, then
that explanation is more economical.
<P>
An infinity of random universes is suggested by the modern inflationary
model of the early universe. A quantum fluctuation can produce
a tiny, empty region of curved space that will expand exponentially,
increasing its energy sufficiently in the process to produce energy
equivalent to all the mass of the universe in a mere 10<SUP>-42</SUP>
second. Cosmologist Andre Linde has proposed that a spacetime
&quot;foam&quot; empty of matter and radiation will experience
local quantum fluctuations in curvature, forming bubbles of &quot;false
vacuum&quot; that individually inflate, as described above, into
mini-universes with random characteristics (Linde, 1982, 1987;
Atkatz, 1994). In this view, our universe is one of those expanding
bubbles, the product of a single monkey banging away at the keys
of a single word processor. 
<H3><CENTER>Toy Universes</CENTER></H3>
<P>
I thought it might be fun (and instructive) to see what some of
these universes might look like. Of course, other universes may
have different physical laws and we have no idea what those laws
might be, although we can always speculate. All we really know
is our universe and its laws. Even in this case, different values
of the constants that go into our familiar equations will lead
to universes that do not look a bit like ours.
<P>
From the values of just four fundamental constants, the physical
properties of matter from the dimensions of atoms to the length
of the day and year to the age of main sequence stars can be estimated.
Two of these constants are the strengths of the electromagnetic
and strong nuclear interactions. The other two are the masses
of the electron and proton.
<P>
This is not, of course, the whole story. Many more constants are
needed to fill in the details of our universe. The gross properties
of our universe are determined by these four constants, and we
can vary them to see what a universe might grossly look like with
different values of these constants.
<P>
I have written a program -- <A HREF="http://www.phys.hawaii.edu/vjs/www/monkeygod">MonkeyGod</A>
-- posted on my web site, which the reader is welcome to use.
Try your own hand at generating universes. Just choose different
values of the four constants and see what happens. While these
are really only &quot;toy&quot; universes, the exercise illustrates
that there could be many ways to produce a universe old enough
to have some form of life.
<P>
The program computes the following quantities: the (Bohr) radius
and binding energy of the hydrogen atom, the radius of a nucleon
(proton or neutron) and its binding energy in a nucleus, the lifetime
and mass of a typical star, and the radius, length of day, and
length of year for a typical planet. It also computes the numbers
N1 and N2 mentioned earlier. (The astronomical quantities were
calculated using the formulas of Press and Lightman, 1983.)
<P>
The lifetime and mass of a typical main sequence star sets the
scale for the age of a universe populated, in the vicinity of
at least one such star, by complex material systems assembled
from chemical elements produced in the stars themselves. Thus
we can easily determine what a universe will look like if it possesses
values of the basic parameters that differ from our own.
<P>
Here are some typical outputs. The strength of the electromagnetic
force is given by alpha (for greater familiarity, 1/alpha is printed
out). The strength of the strong nuclear force is alpha_s. Both
of these quantities are dimensionless (that is, they have no units).
The electron mass is indicated by Me, the proton mass by Mp. Both
are in kilograms. In the tables right, I have rounded off most
of the results since only orders of magnitude are really significant
in a calculation of this type. The abbreviation for the units
in the answers are standard in any physics text. 
<P>
Figure 1 shows a scatter plot of N2 vs. Nl for 100 universes in
which the values of the four parameters were generated randomly
from a range five orders of magnitude above to five orders of
magnitude below their values in our universe, that is, over a
total range of 10 orders of magnitude. We see that, over this
range of parameter variation, Nl is at least 10<SUP>33</SUP> and
N2 at least 10<SUP>20</SUP> in all cases. That is, both are still
very large numbers. Although many pairs do not lie exactly on
the diagonal N1 = N2, the coincidence between these two quantities
is not supernaturally rare.
<P>
The distribution of stellar lifetimes for these same 100 universes
is shown in Figure 2. While a few are low, most are clearly high
enough to allow time for stellar evolution and heavy element nucleosynthesis.
I think it is safe to conclude that the conditions for the appearance
of a universe with life are not supernaturally so improbable as
those authors enamored by the anthropic principle would have you
think.

"Will you speak falsely for God, and speak deceitfully for him?  Will
you show partiality toward him, will you plead the case for God?"
--Job 13:7-8 (NRSV)
</blockquote>
On February 20, 1993, CBS aired "The Incredible Discovery of Noah's 
Ark," Sun International Pictures' rehash of its 1976 film "In Search of 
Noah's Ark." (The earlier film was released theatrically, then shown on 
NBC on May 2 and December 24, 1977 {Bailey 1978, p. 124}.  Bill Crouse 
{1993} estimates that as much as 20% of the 1993 program was 
cannibalized from the earlier version. For criticisms of the first 
program, see Bailey {1978}; Montagno {1977}; and Teeple {1978}). At the 
end of June, Skeptics Society advisor Gerald Larue publicly revealed 
(via Associated Press and <em>Time</em> magazine) that George Jammal, one of 
the alleged eyewitnesses of Noah's Ark on Mt. Ararat, was a hoaxer, and 
that Larue himself had played a role in the hoax. The purpose was to 
demonstrate the shoddy research of Sun International Pictures. (The hoax 
had actually been revealed in March in a press release from the 
Committee for the Scientific Examination of Religion but hardly anyone 
took notice of it.))
<p>CBS, Sun, and the Institute for Creation Research (ICR) set out to 
control the damage to their credibility by defending the program against 
the criticisms of Larue (in <em>Skeptic Vol. 2, No. 2</em>). Since Jammal was 
continuing to defend his story, at first the three organizations went on 
the offensive against Larue. CBS Entertainment President Jeff Sagansky 
stated, "There was clearly a hoax perpetrated . . . we're not sure 
whether it was on Sun International and CBS or whether it was on <em>Time</em> 
magazine." A press release from Sun called it "sad and unfortunate that 
Dr. LaRue [sic], a distinguished USC professor, would victimize Mr. 
Jammal and his family to execute a third party hoax in which he was the 
primary benefactor." John Morris, the Administrative Vice President of 
the ICR, made much of Larue's "long association with humanistic and 
anti-Christian organizations" and concluded that "This is hardly the 
resume of an objective critic." All defended the overall quality of 
Sun's research. (Pierce, 1993; Sun International Pictures, 1993a, p. 6; 
Morris, 1993b, p. 3.)</p>
<p>But subsequent events began to undermine a defense based on Jammal's 
veracity. On August 26, 1993, the <em>Long Beach Press-Telegram</em>, Jammal's 
hometown newspaper, ran a story about the hoax. In the story, Jammal did 
not admit to a hoax, but stated in response to a question about his 
religious background that "If I told you that, you'd know the secret." 
The reporter noted in the article that a poem framed in glass on 
Jammal's piano begins, "Humanism is a philosophy for people who think 
for themselves . . ." (Wiscombe, 1993). The September 1993 issue of 
<em>Freethought Today</em>, the monthly publication of the Freedom From 
Religion Foundation (FFRF), announced that Jammal had been a member of 
the Foundation since 1986, and was scheduled to be a speaker at the 
group's annual convention at the end of October, where he would reveal 
his hoax. Sun's position evolved, and their press release was revised to 
say that "Sun researchers now believe [Jammal] may eventually confess to 
committing a hoax." It continued to defend the quality of their 
research, however, stating that Jammal's confession "would mean that he 
has through an elaborate lie successfully hoaxed well-meaning 
individuals, religious groups, psychiatrists, Ararat explorers, and 
others since 1986. Even our exhaustive research would have failed to 
uncover this hoaxer if that in fact is what he is by his own future 
admission" (1993b, p. 3). At the December, 1993, meeting of Atheists 
United, Jammal was presented their "Atheist of the Year" award. Upon 
acceptance he elaborated further on the hoax and the gullibility of the 
producers.</p>
<p>Now that Jammal has revealed his hoax it is clear that Sun did 
present false information in their program. But is their defense sound? 
How extensive was their research? Did Jammal engage in an elaborate hoax 
that resisted even the most cautious investigation? Or did Sun simply 
present claims which supported a particular viewpoint--that Noah's Ark 
has been found on Mt. Ararat--without regard for truth or accuracy?</p>

<a name="hoax1">
<h2>Jammal's Hoax: 1985-1986</h2>
</a>

Several events inspired George Jammal to play the practical joke which 
became a major hoax. A May 30, 1985 creation/evolution debate between 
Fred Edwords (now executive director of the American Humanist 
Association) and Duane Gish (vice president of the ICR) which aired on 
KABC radio apparently got Jammal to thinking. While observing railroad 
ties near his workplace, he got the idea of telling Gish that he had 
found Noah's Ark and using that wood as his evidence.
<p>On November 1, 1985, he wrote to Gish: "Since I was a little boy I 
was fascinated with the story of Noah and the Ark. I made up my mind 
that when I grow up, I will do my share as a good Christian to prove the 
bible is the true word of God." Jammal told a story about saving money 
and flying to Greece in 1972, where he bought a Volkswagen. From Greece, 
he drove to Turkey, to the village "Nakhitchevan." There he was assisted 
by a man and his family, but he was unable to find the Ark. A similar 
trip in 1980 was also unsuccessful, but in 1984 he and a companion 
crawled into a cave of ice which proved to be the Ark. Each chipped off 
a piece of wood to prove that they had found the Ark. But then disaster 
struck:  Jammal's companion fell into a crevasse while attempting to 
take a photograph and was killed. Jammal said that he had kept his 
discovery secret until writing the letter to Gish.</p>
<p>In the letter (reprinted in <em>Freethought Today</em>, 1993b), he tells  
who assisted him, and reveals that the names which are part of the hoax 
are intended to be sounded out carefully. The man whose family aided him 
was "Mr. Asholian." His companion who died was a "Polish friend" of Mr. 
Asholian's son-in-law, named "Vladimir Sobitchsky." The son-in-law, 
whose full name is conspicuously absent from Jammal's later accounts, is 
given in the Gish letter as "Allis Buls Hitian." (Jammal remains shocked 
that no one caught him on this last one.)</p>
<p>In 1986, John Morris contacted Jammal about his story and arranged to 
interview him at length. In an early letter from Jammal to Morris, dated 
January 21, 1986, Jammal gives another hint of a hoax when he writes to 
give Morris his phone number and adds: "But the people here are not 
religious at all. And I think they don't believe in my story about 
Noah's Ark. Please don't discuss it with them."</p>
<p>Jammal visited libraries and read books about Noah's Ark claims, and 
about Mt. Ararat and the surrounding region, which he had never visited. 
At some point, as part of his preparation, he watched a videotape of the 
1976 Sun Classic Pictures production, "In Search of Noah's Ark."</p>
<p>On June 10, 1986, Morris interviewed Jammal and produced a transcript 
from the tape recording. A careful examination of this transcript 
reveals not only that Jammal's account contains numerous 
inconsistencies, but that much of the information flow in the 
conversation is from Morris to Jammal rather than vice-versa, the 
classic technique of "cold reading" used by "psychics" to glean 
information from their clients. For example, the following is their 
discussion about the size of Lake Kop, west of Ararat (notations in 
brackets are Morris'):</p>
<blockquote>
JM: How big was Lake Kop in diameter when you saw it?
<p>GJ: It wasn't that big like Lake Superior. It's a small lake.</p>
<p>JM: Is it 100 feet across? 500 feet across? It changes every year. I was 
   just wondering how it was in 1984.</p>
<p>GJ: That's it, it changes. It depends on what time of the year you are 
   there.  [pause] I think it was 100 ft or a little bit more than 100. 
   I don't really know.</p>
</blockquote>
   A few other exchanges while viewing slides of the area also show 
Morris giving information to Jammal:
<blockquote>
JM: This is up by Lake Kop. You saw something like this? [rocky slopes]
<p>GJ: Oh yeah.</p>
<p>JM: There is a prominent ice cliff here. Do you remember that? [west 
   side]</p>
<p>GJ: Yes, I remember the big cliff, okay. [not convinced]</p>
<p>JM: This is that same glacier with the crevasses. Coming down to Lake 
   Kop, down here. There is a very big rock [A-K rock], hundreds of feet 
   tall. You don't remember that? There are many similar rocks, but this 
   big rock next to the big glacier? We are standing near Lake Kop to 
   take the picture.</p>
<p>GJ: Lake Kop is to the left of here?</p>
<p>JM: No, behind us.</p>
<p>GJ: Yes, behind us. To the left, down there.</p>
<p>GJ: Do you have a picture from the lake up to the summit?</p>
<p>JM: Well, you can't see it from Lake Kop; you have to climb the ridge 
   and then look up, but I have some from up there.</p>
</blockquote>
The transcript also points out some inconsistencies in Jammal's account:
<blockquote>
JM: Where did you start from? . . .
<p>GJ: They told me there is a city there--it's called Nakichevan, or 
   something, I don't remember exactly the name. It is "where the ark 
   was landed"--that's the meaning.</p>
<p>JM: That's in Russia [pointing to a map].</p>
<p>GJ: Well, that's what they told me; I don't know where that city is.</p>
<p>JM: The one you mentioned in your letter was Nakichevan.</p>
<p>GJ: Yes, that's what they told me. This is Russia? [astonished at the 
   location of Nakichevan]</p>
<p>JM: Yes. This is Russia; here's the Russia-Turkey border; here's Mt. 
   Ararat. So you drove to Turkey in your VW. Did you cross over into 
   Russia?</p>
<p>GJ: No, I didn't go to Russia. But that's what they told me, if my 
   memory is not failing me.</p>
</blockquote>
Morris finally gets suspicious at one point:
<blockquote>
JM: A man in Igdir, you think? Do you remember his name?
<p>GJ: Asholian.</p>
<p>JM: But that's an Armenian name. I would be surprised if someone in 
   Turkey had that name.</p>
<p>GJ: Part of Armenia is taken by the Turks, and part of Armenia is taken 
   by the Russians. Maybe he has a different name, but that's what he 
   told me . . . .</p>
<p>JM: Please forgive me, I'm not playing the district attorney, but for 
   clarity, a minute ago you said you thought you came from the south, 
   but then in looking at the map you thought you came from the north.</p>
<p>GJ: Okay, this is north. We came there, this is what I mean we went 
   between the two mountains and then we started to go from the south to 
   the north.</p>
<p>JM: You cannot drive across.</p>
<p>GJ: No, we didn't drive, we walked.</p>
</blockquote>
   And what about Jammal's piece of wood from the Ark? What had he done 
with this incredibly valuable archaeological find?
<blockquote>
GJ: Now you saw my place; I have to look for the piece of wood. You saw 
   my house--you didn't see the garage. You know it is all boxes.
</blockquote>
(Morris told me in writing and verbally that he had called Jammal 
several times asking about the wood, but Jammal said he had not really 
bothered to look for it.)
<p>Jammal's initial hoax was not very convincing, and nothing came of 
it. John Morris published nothing about it, and other Ark researchers to 
whom he sent tapes of the Jammal interview, such as Bill Crouse, thought 
that Jammal's story was obviously untrue. The evidence was overwhelming: 
Jammal contradicted himself, but resorted to saying "that's what they 
told me" when inconsistencies were pointed out to him. He let Morris do 
most of the talking, and usually just agreed with what Morris had to 
say. He suggested that his own family didn't believe his story and asked 
Morris not to talk to them. His first letter to the ICR contained 
obviously bogus names, one of which was a very strong hint that his 
story was fabricated. And his alleged most valuable possession, a piece 
of Noah's Ark, was stuffed away in a box somewhere that he hadn't 
bothered to remember.</p>
<p>Morris, however, did not--and still does not--seem to recognize the 
significance of this evidence. On the one hand, he has stated (phone 
interview) that "When I first interviewed [Jammal] . . . , I remember 
thinking he had nothing of interest to tell us as far as searching for 
the Ark.  He didn't know where he was sufficiently to be of any help and 
his story was so different [from other claimed Ark eyewitnesses]." On 
the other hand, he wrote that (Sellier, 1993, p. 3):</p>
<blockquote>
It is my impression that [Jammal] was on Mt. Ararat. He seems to know 
Lake Kop and described in reasonable detail the terrain nearby. He 
especially was familiar with the loose rocks. His memory of the size of 
Lake Kop is accurate. His feel for the elevation at the base of the main 
ice cap is about right.
</blockquote>
   Morris had continued to maintain uncertainty about whether or not 
Jammal's original story was true until his interview on <em>Inside Edition</em> 
(December 15, 1993) in which he admitted he had been hoaxed. 
<p>Bill Crouse of Christian Information Ministries, International, an 
Ark hunter who publishes the newsletter <em>Ararat Report</em>, was not so 
hesitant. Crouse disbelieved Jammal's story from the time he first heard 
it in 1986, and was both surprised and disappointed to see Jammal on 
"The Incredible Discovery of Noah's Ark," a program which he thoroughly 
debunked in the May 1993 issue of his newsletter. Crouse (1993, p. 5) 
wrote on the basis of Morris' interview that Jammal</p>
<blockquote>
      is extremely confused when confronted about the geography of the 
      mountain. He first claims to have started his ascent from 
      Nakhichevan (60 miles away!) . . . . whenever he was confronted 
      with contradictions he would defer to: 'I was told this' . . . he 
      says he found a man in Igdir named Asholian. An Armenian? Living 
      in Igdir in 1980? Highly unlikely . . . . We were at Ararat in 
      1984, and no climbers were allowed to climb on any route but the 
      southern route. He claims, however, to have seen a group of 
      climbers at Kop. He claims he rented mules at Igdir. How could he 
      do this without getting caught? Does he have any proof that he was 
      ever in eastern Turkey, such as photos, or his passport? Is he 
      willing to have his wood tested for age?
</blockquote>
Crouse's article shows that a critically thinking person--even one 
who believes in the Ark and the Flood of Noah--had plenty of reasons to 
question Jammal's story prior to public allegations of a hoax. 

<a name="hoax2">
<h2>Jammal's Hoax: 1992-1993</h2>
</a>

When Sun International Pictures came to John Morris asking for 
information about persons claiming to have seen the Ark, Morris gave 
them Jammal's name, along with copies of the material he had already 
collected. By this time, Jammal and Gerald Larue had become acquainted, 
and Larue had appeared on Sun's previous CBS program, "Ancient Secrets 
of the Bible." Larue, who was unhappy with the way his interview had 
been edited, encouraged Jammal and offered him suggestions for carrying 
out his interview with Sun. Jammal prepared a piece of wood by 
soaking it in a variety of sauces including wine, teriyaki sauce, 
spices, alcohol, and seeds, then microwaving and baking it. Jammal's 
interview with Sun went smoothly, and he was able to keep his story 
fairly consistent with his original interview in part because Morris had 
provided him with a transcript. Sun expressed no doubts about Jammal's 
claims, and his segment was prominently featured on "The Incredible 
Discovery of Noah's Ark."
<p>Though the initial press release from Larue was largely ignored, the 
publication of the story in <em>Time</em> magazine in June, 1993, started the 
avalanche. In late April Jammal contacted the ACLU to inquire about 
legal representation out of fear that he might be sued. They declined to 
participate, but contacted <em>Skeptic</em> publisher Dr. Michael Shermer to 
inquire if the Skeptics Society would be interested in getting involved. 
Shermer called Jammal, who expressed extreme anxiety about being sued 
for his hoax, noting "I'm afraid they will sue me and take my home. I 
have a wife and children and I am afraid for them." Shermer told Jammal 
he would put him in touch with James Randi, who has had his share of 
legal entanglements. At the time Shermer informed Randi of the hoax, the 
latter was involved in a lawsuit that had come to trial. One of his 
character witnesses was <em>Time</em> magazine science editor Leon Jaroff, who, 
smelling a good story, immediately called Shermer. Though Jammal was 
still reticent about going public, Jaroff pieced the story together 
through Shermer, Larue, and several other sources, and the story broke 
with considerable attention.</p>
<p>When Larue blew the whistle on the hoax, he criticized Sun for making 
no effort to verify Jammal's story. Not only did Sun overlook the 
overwhelming evidence of a hoax already in their possession, they 
continued to ignore it when it was called to their attention. Sun's 
press releases state that they examined Jammal's interview with Morris 
as part of their investigation (Sun International Pictures 1993b, p. 1; 
Sellier 1993, pp. 2-3). Sun's researcher David Balsiger stated in a 
telephone interview on December 7, 1993, that the earliest account from 
Jammal that he had seen was the 1986 Morris interview, though he also 
said that he had looked through Morris' files. In light of how readily 
Morris has sent out copies of the 1985 Jammal-to-Gish letter to 
skeptics, I find it hard to believe that he concealed the existence of 
this letter from Sun. Ark researcher David Fasold, in a telephone 
interview on November 27, 1993, said that Sun's researcher David 
Balsiger came to his home on August 8, 1992 to discuss his (Fasold's) 
appearance on the show. Fasold says that he told Balsiger on the basis 
of the Morris interview transcript that Jammal's account was clearly 
untrue. He was quite surprised when Balsiger told him that Jammal was to 
be the show's star eyewitness. Fasold did not appear on the program. 
David Balsiger says that he does not remember any conversation with 
Fasold about Jammal. Ark researcher Bill Crouse said in a telephone 
interview on December 7, 1993, that he specifically warned Balsiger that 
Jammal (and other claimed Ark eyewitnesses) lacked credibility, and gave 
Balsiger reasons for his opinion.</p>
<p>Sun and the ICR have subsequently made no mention of any of this 
early evidence of a hoax, but instead referred to the early years of 
Jammal's hoax as evidence against Larue's claims. This offensive 
maneuver against Larue was possible because the initial stories 
reporting Jammal's hoax incorrectly described Larue as the initiator of 
the hoax. CBS, Sun, and the ICR all latched on to this incorrect claim 
as a means of self-defense. CBS's Sagansky stated that "The crux of that 
[<em>Time</em>] article was that Dr. Larue from USC apparently put Mr. Jammal 
up to this hoax. And in fact, we have the exact same testimony from 
Jammal dating back to 1986." Sun Executive Producer Charles Sellier, Jr. 
wrote that "It is difficult for us to understand how Dr. LaRue [sic] 
master-minded a hoax in 1992 based on facts first recorded in 1986." 
John Morris reported that he sent his early Jammal materials to <em>Time</em>
magazine with the expectation that its reporters would take it as 
evidence against Larue's hoax charges. He concluded:</p>
<blockquote>
      Don't hold your breath for a <em>Time</em> magazine or Associated Press 
      retraction. If it happens, it will be buried on an obscure page. 
      Don't look for LaRue's [sic] fellow humanists to insist on a 
      higher standard of integrity. The damage has already been done; 
      the goal has already been accomplished. Christianity and creation 
      have been given another 'black eye' in public, with no recourse.
</blockquote>
Morris suggests that a retraction is in order for this relatively 
minor mistake--reporting that Larue initiated the hoax, rather than 
simply helped with its last stages--while ignoring his own failings 
which contributed to the success of the hoax in the first place.
<p>(Pierce,1993; Sellier,1993, p. 3; Morris, 1993b, p. 4. Morris' 1993b 
article, prior to the quoted conclusion, claimed that "most" statements 
in the Sun program were "essentially accurate;" that "Especially 
powerful were interviews with several who claim to have seen the Ark," 
including Jammal; that while <em>Time</em> and the Associated Press "have 
branded Jammal as a fraud," a "quick phone call to Jammal proved that he 
had not retracted his testimony and had offered to take a lie detector 
test;" that Jammal "had not benefited financially from his story, except 
for a modest interview fee paid by Sun Pictures;" that Larue is not "an 
objective critic;" that "Psychiatric evaluation of Jammal's taped 
interview pronounced him to be credible;" and that Jammal's "knowledge 
of the mountain and its people could hardly have been coached by someone 
who had never been there." When I read Morris his strongly worded 
conclusion {without the above summary} and asked him if he felt that a 
retraction was in order for his defense of Jammal's story, he answered 
that he did not remember his article well enough to know if he needed a 
retraction. He stated that "I don't remember it well enough to know that 
I stood behind Jammal that he saw the Ark; I don't know that I've ever 
thought that, so I doubt that I said it." When pressed, he did say that 
"I have no stomach for saying things that are wrong, and if I've done 
that, then yeah, I'll retract.")</p>
<p>A new article informing ICR followers of the hoax, if not a 
retraction of Morris' previous article, appears to be in order. A recent 
article by Morris, 1993c, agreeing that there is no good evidence of 
"flash frozen" mammoths is perhaps a promising sign, but his overall 
record for correction of mistakes and falsehoods is less than perfect. 
For example, when the alleged human footprints at the Paluxy River were 
shown to be dinosaur tracks, Morris' 1980 book on the subject, <em>Tracking 
Those Incredible Dinosaurs and the People Who Knew Them</em> was officially 
pulled from circulation in January 1986, but he has continued to suggest 
that there is evidence of human footprints at the site {<A HREF = "http://www.icr.org/pubs/imp/imp-151.htm">Morris 1986b</A>, 
1986c, 1988; Cole 1986; Schadewald 1986, p. 12}. Also see Cole and 
Godfrey {1985}, Hastings {1989}, and Kuban {1986, <A HREF = "http://members.aol.com/Paluxy2/retrack.htm">1989a</A>}. Morris 
appealed to the withdrawal of his 1980 book as evidence of his 
commitment to truth during my interview with him, but he has failed to 
retract other erroneous statements even after learning of his errors, 
e.g., the claim that Donald Johanson has been keeping quiet the location 
where "Lucy's" knee joint was found {Morris 1989; Lippard 1990, pp. 27-
28} and that there are fossil-bearing strata on Mt. Ararat {Zindler 
1989}. Further, while Morris' Paluxy "mantrack" book was officially 
withdrawn, the book continued to be sold. Former <em>Creation/Evolution</em> 
editor Fred Edwords was one person who successfully ordered a copy 
(personal communication from John Cole, November 30, 1993). The book and 
the "mantrack" claims continue to be touted in Henry Morris' 1993 
<em>History of Modern Creationism</em> {2nd edition}, pp. 291-292.)</p>
<p>The primary line of defense--denial that there was a hoax by Jammal--was
accompanied by a secondary line of defense: that Sun's research was 
exemplary. When it became clear to everyone--except Morris--that Jammal 
was a hoaxer, this became the primary defense. As Sun's Allan Pederson 
told the <em>Los Angeles Times</em> after Jammal confessed, "We certainly will 
be as conscientious as we can and scrutinize sources as closely as we 
can in the future. But frankly, we took the same due diligence before 
all this. My stance is that it's just about impossible to defend against 
that kind of well-planned and well-thought-out deception," (Even though, 
as Larue told a reporter for <em>Inside Edition</em>, carbon-14 dating was not 
necessary. One only had to smell the wood to know it was a fake. The 
reporter sniffed the wood and exclaimed "teriyaki"!) The attacks on 
Larue were completely dropped from a later revised version of Sun's 
press release, except for a single paragraph which reiterated the point 
about Jammal's story being told to the ICR prior to Larue's involvement.</p>
<p>The secondary defense consisted of four parts: (1) that Sun had 
examined Morris' interview with Jammal; (2) that Sun had conducted their 
own two-hour audio taped interview looking for inconsistencies in 
Jammal's story; (3) that Sun compared the two interviews and found them 
to be consistent with each other; (4) that Sun gave Jammal's interview 
tapes to psychiatrist Paul Meier, who pronounced Jammal credible. By 
late September, Sun added a fifth defense: (5) That Sun had Jammal's 
hand-drawn map of Ararat and his expedition routes examined by Ararat 
expeditioneers who "assured us that it could not have been drawn by 
anyone who did not have experience with the mountain" (Cerone, 1993; Sun 
International Pictures, 1993a; Sellier, 1993).</p>
<p>The first point of this defense is clearly no defense at all, since 
Jammal's initial interview should have made it clear that his story was 
not credible. The second point is difficult to judge without knowing 
what questions were asked, but it is clear that Sun did not bother to 
check Jammal's passport, test his wood, or find anyone who could confirm 
any part of his story. The third defense is negated by the fact that 
Jammal possessed a copy of his original interview and had ample time to 
prepare. The fifth defense is undercut by the fact that Jammal had read 
books by Ark researchers in preparation for his interview, several of 
which contain maps of the area. It is also counteracted by Jammal's lack 
of detailed knowledge of the geography of the region in his interview 
with Morris.</p>
<p>The fourth defense is the one which Sun has placed the most weight on 
and devoted the most space to in its press releases. Quotations from 
Meier--who has never met or spoken with Jammal--fill two and a half of 
the six pages of Sun's initial defense against the hoax allegations. 
Meier's qualifications are given by Sun as follows: "a well-known 
California psychiatrist, co-founder of the 28 Minirth-Meier clinics 
across America, and author of 40 books on human behavior." It is also 
mentioned that Meier "served as the field physician on Astronaut James 
Irwin's Noah's Ark expedition to Mt. Ararat."</p>
<p>Meier, who now practices in Richardson, Texas, combines Christianity 
and psychiatry in his clinics, which provide "a ministry for Christ as 
well as . . . help hurting people" (Wiscombe, 1993; Cohen, 1993). It is 
not at all clear that Meier is qualified to offer a judgment about 
Jammal's veracity on the basis of an audio tape but even so, some of his 
own statements seem to cast doubt on Jammal's story. He states that 
Jammal seems to be "an 'obsessive-compulsive with histrionic features' . 
. . a perfectionist performer . . . . He wants fame and yet he's humble 
enough to admit it . . . . He wanted to feel special." But Meier's 
statements also bring his own credibility into doubt. He states that he 
finds Jammal to be "the most credible" of the four alleged eyewitnesses 
on the program, in marked contrast to Bill Crouse, who found Jammal to 
be the least credible. Meier claimed that Jammal's "descriptions of the 
customs of the people, of the Ark itself and its location, are very 
accurate" and that they match "exactly what I know to be true about the 
Ark from the secret government reconnaissance photos." On the former 
point, Meier is at odds not only with Crouse, but with John Morris, who 
found Jammal's account unhelpful with regard to pinpointing the location 
of the Ark. On the latter, Meier owes an explanation of what "secret 
government reconnaissance photos" he is talking about and how he came to 
have access to them. (Sun International Pictures, 1993a, pp. 3-5; 
Sellier, 1993, pp. 3-4; Sun International Pictures,1993b, p. 2. In 
Chapter 13 of Balsiger and Sellier {1976} John Morris is quoted saying 
that he had interviewed the pilot of a spy plane who claimed to have 
viewed secret photos of the Ark, but that his attempts to get copies 
have failed. Bill Crouse, in a telephone interview on December 7, 1993, 
said that he suggested that Sun have Meier examine the interview tapes 
but was quite surprised that Meier endorsed Jammal's veracity. He also 
provided some information about the spy photos, saying that an 
acquaintance of Meier claims to have seen photos of Mt. Ararat taken 
from a U-2 plane which bear some resemblance to a large ship. Crouse 
suggested that the story about the photos may well be true, but the 
object pictured was probably a "phantom Ark" basalt formation, of which 
there are many on Ararat.)</p>
<p>Jammal's most concrete piece of evidence for his claimed visit to the 
Ark was his piece of wood, and Sun's program made much of it. Near the 
end of the broadcast, the narrator's voice says, over a scene from a 
dramatization of Jammal's fictional Ark visit and then a photograph of 
Fernand Navarra's wood: "Samples of the wood taken from the vessel have 
been dated to the time when the Bible indicates a worldwide flood 
occurred." This strongly suggests that Jammal's wood was tested, but it 
was not. Gerald Larue, in <em>Time</em>, specifically criticized Sun for 
failing to perform any tests on the wood. Sun's excuses for failing to 
do so have evolved. In the original Associated Press story on the hoax, 
Sun's chief researcher David Balsiger stated that "We couldn't test the 
wood in time for our deadline." In the September <em>Long Beach
Press-Telegram</em> article, Balsiger stated that "This is an entertainment
show. We're not supposed to make our own news or tests," a position also taken 
by Sun's press releases. In a letter from Sun's Charles Sellier to CBS 
Vice President Steve Warner, Sellier wrote that "Even if we had the 
money and time to test every piece of evidence presented by experts, it 
would not have been definitive as there would still be those who would 
disagree and take exception to the findings." The first Sun press 
release expanded on this, claiming that "the sample according to the 
<em>Time</em> article was contaminated by baking and juices. This would have 
prevented obtaining accurate carbon-14 dating results." (Associated 
Press,1993; Wiscombe, 1993; Sun International Pictures, 1993a, p. 5; 
Sellier, 1993, p. 5; Sun International Pictures, 1993b, p. 3).  In a 
telephone interview on December 7, 1993, Sun's David Balsiger stated 
that he got in some trouble with CBS for "making news" by testing a soil 
sample as part of his research for one of Sun's "Ancient Secrets of the 
Bible" programs, and that had that not happened he probably would have 
tested the wood.</p>
<p>Sellier's claim that a carbon-14 test would "not have been 
definitive" seems to be completely without foundation. Cerone (1993) 
also claims, apparently on the basis of information from Jammal, that 
Robert Dietz, professor emeritus of geology at Arizona State University, 
asked Sun for a piece of the wood for testing, and that Jammal was told 
by Sun not to give a sample to Dietz. Dietz says that he never asked Sun 
for a sample of the wood (personal communication, November 29, 1993).</p>
<p>Sun International Pictures claims that they made every reasonable 
effort to validate Jammal's story, and that they cannot be held 
responsible for being taken in by his hoax. While this defense is highly 
implausible in light of the evidence that was available to Sun prior to 
the broadcast of their program, it becomes even more implausible when it 
is noted that Jammal's story was not the only one on the program lacking 
in credibility.</p>

<h2>Other Hoaxes?</h2>
</a>

"The Incredible Discovery of Noah's Ark" featured the stories of several 
other people who have claimed to have found the Ark on Ararat. One of 
these was Ed Davis of Albuquerque, New Mexico, who was stationed in 
Hamadan, Iran in 1943.  Davis claims that while there, he saw a snow-capped
mountain in the distance and was taken there by Lourd natives of 
the region, including one named Abbas, who showed him the Ark. The Sun 
program made much of the fact that Davis took and passed a polygraph 
test. But the show failed to mention certain relevant facts. These 
include: (1) Davis' polygraph test consisted of a total of six 
questions, one of which showed unusual stress. That question was "Are 
you lying when you state that no one ever told you about the Ark other 
than Abbas and the Bible?" (2) Davis claims he saw Ararat from Hamadan, 
which is 400 miles away. (3) Davis claims his trip to Ararat took about 
half a day. (4) Davis' story has changed significantly over time--e.g., 
he now says Kurds, not Lourds, took him to Ararat. (These details and 
others are presented in Crouse {1993, pp. 3-4}. Crouse has also 
discussed Davis in more detail in the January-February 1988 and January-
February 1989 issues of <em>Ararat Report</em>. Crouse suggests that Davis was 
taken to the mountain "Kuh e Alvand," 60 miles west of Hamadan, which is 
believed by many in the region to be where the Ark landed.)
<p>Another claimed Ark eyewitness was Ed Behling, who has refused to 
talk about his claims since the early 1980's. (His appearance on the Sun 
program was taken from an older interview.) Behling claims to have been 
shown the Ark while in Turkey with the Air Force. Behling's story 
contains dubious details which, when he was questioned about them, he 
refused to answer. For instance, he claims to have built a campfire just 
below the Ark (above 13,000 feet), but would not answer questions about 
the nature of the campfire and what he used for fuel. Those who know 
Behling have described him as a sincere Christian who sometimes 
embellishes stories (Crouse, 1993, p. 4).</p>
<p>A third claimed Ark eyewitness was Fernand Navarra, a Frenchman who 
has been variously described as a "junk dealer" and an "industrialist." 
Navarra traveled to Ararat on several occasions in the 1950's and 
1960's, and claimed to have found wood from the Ark in 1955 and 1969. 
The Sun program reported that "Navarra himself had the hand-hewn wood 
that he had found tested in three different laboratories.  He was told 
that its age was around 5,000 years, clearly in line with the biblical 
account of the flood. The scientific tests prove beyond question that 
something very old, something very mysterious, was definitely on Mt. 
Ararat."</p>
<p>What the show did not say is that one of Navarra's expedition members 
and his guides have said that Navarra purchased the wood from natives in 
town and carried it up the mountain himself, prior to his 1955 
discovery. The show also did not reveal that the testing methods which 
gave an age of 5,000 years were of dubious scientific value, and that 
radiocarbon tests on Navarra's 1955 and 1969 wood by six labs yielded 
ages from 1,190 to 1,690 years old. Finally, the show failed to note 
that Navarra has pointed out several different locations as where he 
found his wood. (Crouse, 1993, pp. 2-3; Bailey, 1978; Fox, 1993, p. 44.  
Navarra's own account is given in Navarra edited with Balsiger {1974}. 
Balsiger and Sellier {1976}, chapter 12, discusses the tests of 
Navarra's wood and raises standard creationist objections to radiocarbon 
dating, objections which have now been rejected by the ICR {Aardsma 
1989}. Sun International Pictures {1993a, p. 6} states that "No one has 
come forward with evidence that any of these remaining eyewitnesses 
[other than Jammal] have perpetrated hoaxes on Sun International." 
Crouse told me in a telephone interview on December 7, 1993 that while 
he never called any of these people "hoaxers," he did present Balsiger 
with considerable evidence that their stories were not credible, prior 
to the completion of the show. Crouse {1993} also predates Sun's reply.)</p>
<p>All of the above information was in Sun's possession during the 
production of the show. Ark researcher Bill Crouse provided Sun with 
copies of all back issues of his <em>Ararat Report</em>, which included 
critiques of these alleged Ark eyewitnesses. Crouse, who was filmed for 
"The Incredible Discovery of Noah's Ark" but was not used in the 
program, says that he specifically told Balsiger when the film crew was 
at his office that Jammal, Davis, and Behling were not credible.</p>

<a name="bias">
<h2>Is Sun Biased?</h2>
</a>

In Charles Sellier's letter to CBS defending the quality of "The 
Incredible Discovery of Noah's Ark," he stated that "our role is to 
present all of the known information and let the audience decide." Sun's 
Allan Pederson told the <em>Los Angeles Times</em> that "we don't take a point 
of view, creationist or otherwise" (Sellier, 1993, p. 5; Cerone, 1993). 
These claims, however, stand in stark contrast to the facts. Consider 
the following.
<ol>
<li>Discovery bias. The program's foregone conclusion is given in its 
title. It claims that Noah's Ark has been "discovered," and that 
therefore the creationist claim that the Flood of Noah was a historical 
event is true. Ark researcher Bill Crouse has complained of his 
disappointment with the program and how he has "absolutely hated" to 
tell excited Christians who viewed the program that "No, that's still 
premature; the discovery of Noah's Ark has not yet been authenticated" 
(Crouse, 1993, p. 1).</li>
<li>Skeptics misrepresented. The program was scripted by Sun; token 
skeptics were given straw man arguments to read for the cameras. The 
scripts for Sun's programs are written in advance and approved by the 
network even before some of the actors are selected to read their parts. 
In some cases, skeptics have been allowed to write their own scripts, 
but Sun freely edits the results. Skeptic Farrell Till, who appeared on 
the Sun program "Ancient Secrets of the Bible II," was allowed to write 
his own script for three taped segments. Sun discarded one, edited one 
down to almost nothing, and aired one as written and read by Till. The 
straw man script which had originally been written for Till was read by 
someone else. This practice of making skeptics into defenders of straw 
men via pre-scripted positions and biased editing, in fact, was a major 
factor in Larue's encouragement of Jammal to hoax Sun. Sun's David 
Balsiger, in a December 7, 1993 telephone interview, stated that those 
who appear on Sun's shows are given the opportunity to rewrite and 
improve their scripts, and that the initial scripts reflect what they 
think a given expert is likely to say on the basis of telephone 
interviews and other research. (See Barker, 1993; Larue, 1993; Malone, 
1993; and Till, 1993.)</li>
<li>Believers misrepresented. The "experts" on the program were 
overwhelmingly believers in the Flood of Noah and the reality of the Ark 
on Ararat, even though the scientific consensus is the reverse. I 
counted forty on the pro-side and only three on the con-side. Of the 
forty pro-Ark "experts," at least six (John Morris, Ken Cumming, Henry 
Morris, Larry Vardiman, Walter Brown, and Carl Baugh) make their living 
as advocates of creationism, the first four for the ICR. These 
affiliations were not disclosed, but instead these six people were 
identified as "Professor of Geology," "Professor of Biology," "Professor 
of Hydraulics," "Professor of Atmospheric Sciences," "Professor 
Emeritus--Physics," and "Paleoanthropologist," respectively. David 
Balsiger has stated that the on-screen identifications were limited by 
CBS to two lines: one for the person's name, and one for some 
identification of their field of expertise. Other creationists on the 
program included John Whitcomb, Ethel Nelson, Don Shockey, and Roger 
Oakland. No doubt there were many others. None of these experts address 
the numerous scientific absurdities in the Ark story. (A detailed 
account of the numerous scientific, engineering, and practical problems 
with the Ark story is given by Moore {1983}. Problems with Ark sighting 
claims are discussed in Bailey {1978}, Moore {1981}, and Teeple {1978}.)</li>
<li>Credentials misrepresented. A related point is that credentials of 
"experts" were frequently misrepresented. If we closely examine the 
above examples the misrepresentations get progressively worse:  John 
Morris is a professor of geology for the ICR's Graduate School, but his 
title on ICR stationery is "Administrative Vice President." Henry Morris 
has been a professor of hydraulics at respected universities, but he now 
serves as the President of the ICR. Walter Brown's Ph.D. is in 
mechanical engineering, and he is presently the Director of the Center 
for Scientific Creation, which he operates out of his home in Phoenix, 
Arizona. Carl Baugh, advocate of the Paluxy River "mantracks" and the 
proprietor of the Creation Evidences Museum in Glen Rose, Texas, has 
claimed a remarkable assortment of degrees in theology and science, but 
his credentials have been found to be of dubious validity. He has 
claimed a Ph.D. in theology from the California Graduate School of 
Theology, an unaccredited school not even listed in most college 
directories, but he has subsequently admitted that despite completing 
the required work he never actually obtained a degree. He has claimed 
other theology degrees which have also failed to stand up under 
scrutiny. All of his science degrees are from unaccredited institutions 
run by himself or by a former associate, Clifford Wilson. 
<a href="wieland-letter.html">
His claimed 
degree in paleoanthropology is from Pacific College, a small religious 
school in Australia run by Wilson which is not accredited or authorized 
to grant science degrees.</a>
 (<A HREF = "http://members.aol.com/Paluxy2/degrees.htm">Kuban, 1989b</A>, 1989c gives the details on 
Baugh's degrees. Baugh {1989} is a reply of sorts which does not deny 
any of Kuban's substantive claims. Bill Crouse, in a telephone interview 
on December 7, 1993, says that he warned David Balsiger that Baugh 
lacked credibility among Ark researchers.)
<p>Perhaps the two worst misrepresentations of credentials (apart from 
Baugh) were the show's on-screen identifications of "Dr. Ethel Nelson, 
Chinese Pictograph Linguist" and "Dr. Don Shockey, Professor of 
Anthropology." The viewer was given the impression that both are 
academic researchers with Ph.D.s in the fields identified. In fact, 
Ethel Nelson is a medical doctor in Dunlap, Tennessee and Don Shockey is 
an optometrist. In the latter case, at least, Sun knew full well it was 
misrepresenting Shockey's credentials--in the closing credits of the 
program, "Don Shockey, O.D." is credited as a technical advisor. (Nelson 
was the author of the ICR's <A HREF = "http://www.icr.org/pubs/imp/imp-169.htm">Impact No. 169 titled "The Chinese Language 
and the Creative Hands of God."</A> In that publication she was identified 
as an M.D. and as "a physician in Dunlap, Tennessee." Nelson claims that 
"the ancient Chinese worshiped the same Creator-God as the Hebrews" 
based on her study of Chinese pictographs. Fox {1993} points out that a 
number of "experts" on the program are not listed in directories of 
professionals for the fields in which they are supposedly expert.)</p></li>
<li>Untrue and misleading statements. The program made statements 
which the producers knew or should have known to be untrue or 
misleading, even apart from the credential misrepresentations. For 
example, footage at the end of the program showed a photograph allegedly 
taken from the air by former astronaut James Irwin during his last 
flight over Ararat. In fact, the photo shown was taken by Bob Garbe, an 
Ohio pharmacist, while standing on the mountain. The photo has been 
analyzed and the formation pictured is too small to be Noah's Ark. Bill 
Crouse has reported that he provided Sun with the Garbe photo and 
identified its source, and that it had also been published in a book by 
John Morris with the correct attribution to Garbe. This factual error 
was the only one on the program which John Morris found worthy of note 
for the ICR's <em>Acts & Facts</em> readership (Crouse, 1993, p. 7; Morris, 
1993a. Morris wrote of the identification of the photo as Irwin's that 
"While many facts [on the program] were somewhat overstated, only one 
piece of evidence was 'wrong.'" I'm afraid I must disagree with Morris's 
tally).
<p>The program devoted one lengthy segment to a reenactment of the 
alleged discovery of the Ark by a Russian expedition in 1916. This story 
apparently comes from an article which appeared in <em>New Eden</em> magazine 
in 1940. Floyd M. Gurley, the author, has admitted that the story was a 
hoax. Ark researcher David Fasold says that when he tried to show a copy 
of a letter from Gurley to Balsiger, Balsiger refused to look at it. 
Balsiger says that he doesn't remember such an event. (Telephone 
interview with David Fasold, November 27, 1993; with David Balsiger, 
December 7, 1993. Fasold says he has a file of information about 
Gurley's hoax, and read me excerpts from Gurley's letter. Some details 
about the <em>New Eden</em> hoax have been published in Bailey {1978, pp. 55-
56} and Teeple {1978, pp. 103-107}. Balsiger and Sellier {1976, pp. 102-
109} and Berlitz {1987, pp. 29-41} defend the Russian expedition story 
on the basis of testimony from Alexander Koor, who did not begin telling 
it until 1945. The details of Koor's story suggest that it was derived 
from Gurley's, though both Berlitz {1987} and Balsiger and Sellier 
{1976} reject any connection.)</p>
<p>One person on the show, Vence Will, identified as "World War II 
USAF," said that he saw photos of the Ark around 1944 published in the 
military newspaper <em>Stars & Stripes</em>. The newspaper and photos were not 
shown on the program because despite extensive searches, no such photos 
have ever been discovered. Sun's Balsiger and Sellier report these 
negative results in their 1976 book (Balsiger and Sellier, 1976, pp. 
155-157).</p>
<p>Other misleading omissions include the fact that "Ararat" refers in 
the Bible to a region, not to a specific mountain (see 2 Kings 19:37; 
Jeremiah 51:27). Some of the ancient writers appealed to by the program, 
such as Berosus, specifically claimed that the Ark was in the Cordyaean 
mountains, more than two hundred miles south of Mt. Ararat (Josephus, 
1987. Other errors and omissions are detailed in Fox, 1993).</p></li>
<li>Other questionable Sun productions. Sun has produced numerous 
shows filled with wild speculation and dubious factual content. Past Sun 
productions have included "Ghosts from the Dead," "The Lincoln 
Conspiracy" (also a book co-authored by Balsiger and Sellier), "Hangar 
18," "The Bermuda Triangle," and "The Mysterious Monster" (about 
Bigfoot). Planned future productions included "Mysteries of the Ancient 
World" (still forthcoming on CBS in February), "Revelations," and "The 
UFO Phenomenon." The latter two projects were canceled by CBS as a 
result of the controversy over "The Incredible Discovery of Noah's Ark" 
(Balsiger and Sellier, 1976, p. 218; Cerone, 1993; Rosenberg, 1993b; 
Teeple, 1978, p. 125).</li>
<li>Balsiger's questionable background. A final point bearing on 
whether Sun knew what it was doing is that its researcher, David 
Balsiger, has a past history of involvement with Christian hoaxes. 
During the early 1970s, Balsiger wrote both books and newsletter 
articles for the Christian publisher Logos International. He ghost-authored
or co-authored a number of "autobiographical" books giving 
Christian testimonies, including Fernand Navarra's <em>Noah's Ark: I 
Touched It</em>, self-proclaimed former Satanist turned Christian comedian 
Mike Warnke's <em>The Satan Seller</em>, and faith healer Morris Cerullo's
<em>The Back Side of Satan</em>. Warnke's story was exposed as a hoax in a
lengthy article in the Christian magazine <em>Cornerstone</em> in 1992,
though Balsiger continues to defend it. Cerullo, for whom both Balsiger and
Warnke worked prior to the formation of Warnke's own ministry, has come under 
heavy fire from Christian critics for his unorthodox theology and 
incredible claims (e.g., that he was taken from an orphanage by angels 
and transported to heaven for a face-to-face meeting with God). Logos 
International, which is no longer in business, also published a hoaxed 
biography of a former rabbi turned Christian and a book which propagated 
the "urban legend" about NASA computers discovering a "missing day" and 
proving the biblical account of Joshua making the sun stand still.
   (Balsiger's involvement with Cerullo and with Logos International is 
discussed briefly in Trott and Hertenstein's 1992 expos&eacute; of Mike
Warnke, and more extensively in their book {Hertenstein and Trott 1993}. He
was the media director for Cerullo's World Evangelism from 1970-1972 and 
Logos' director of marketing from 1972-1973. They also briefly comment 
on "rabbi" Michael Esses' 1973 biography, <em>Michael, Michael, Why Do You 
Hate Me?</em>. The fabricated story about NASA and the "missing day," which 
was widely disseminated in Harold Hill's 1974 book <em>How to Live Like a 
King's Kid</em>, is discussed by McIver {1986}, Brunvand {1991}, and Loftin 
{1991}. A Christian critique of Morris Cerullo and other advocates of 
the "Faith" movement such as E.W. Kenyon, Kenneth Hagin, Kenneth 
Copeland, Benny Hinn, John Avanzini, Robert Tilton, Marilyn Hickey, and 
Paul Crouch may be found in Hanegraaff {1993}.)</p>
<p>Balsiger has also been politically active. He was involved with the 
Coalition on Revival, which is devoted to "rebuilding our civilization 
on the principles of the Bible . . . until the day we die," serving on 
its steering committee from 1985 to "a few years ago," when he resigned 
(personal communication from Jay Grimstead, December 3, 1993; see also 
Porteous {1993}. Some information about the COR may be found in McIver, 
1988 and Porteous, 1991.) In the 1980's, Balsiger produced a series of 
"Biblical Scoreboards," glossy magazines designed to instruct 
fundamentalist Christians on how to vote in accordance with the Bible. 
He has worked on a number of Republican political campaigns in 
California and organized and headed some political organizations, such 
as the National Citizens Action Network; the Ban the Soviets Coalition, 
which worked to ban the Soviet Union from the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics; 
and the Restore a More Benevolent Order Coalition, which worked to help 
Soviets defect.</p>
<p>Balsiger sometimes identifies himself as "Dr. David W. Balsiger," and 
he has letterhead which identifies him as "David W. Balsiger, L.H.D." 
This is an honorary doctor of laws degree from Lincoln Memorial 
University in Harrogate, Tennessee (a four-year college which does not 
have any doctoral programs), awarded October 4, 1977 for his book <em>The 
Lincoln Conspiracy</em>. Balsiger's undergraduate career was lengthy--his 
<em>Who's Who</em> entry lists five colleges attended between 1964 and 1977, 
with a B.A. awarded by National University in San Diego in 1977. Oddly, 
Balsiger's <em>Who's Who</em> listing says that he was a student at Chapman 
College's World Campus Afloat in 1967-68 and a member of the board of 
directors of the same program in 1967. Balsiger says that he was not on 
the board of directors, but a member of a student association.</p>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>
</a>
In 
<a href="balsiger-release.html">David Balsiger's most recent public statement
</a> about George Jammal's hoax, he writes:
<blockquote>
      There is something wrong with the ethics of the news media when 
      they glorify the acts of humanist hoaxers who intentionally and 
      successfully deceive 40 million TV viewers; and then blame the 
      show producer and CBS for not discovering their elaborate hoax. 
      This is not a case in which the producer or the network is guilty 
      of deceiving viewers, but rather one more example of humanists who 
      tout themselves as 'Ethical Humanists' being neither ethical nor 
      honest when it comes to advancing their hidden agenda (1993).
</blockquote>
Had circumstances been different, Balsiger would have had a point. If 
Jammal's hoax had really been "elaborate" and carefully constructed to 
resist anything less than the most scrupulous and detailed 
investigation; if it had not been filled with inconsistencies and 
intentional clues; if Balsiger had not been warned about Jammal being a 
hoaxer prior to the show's completion; if the show had not otherwise 
misrepresented and omitted facts; if Balsiger and Sun had a reputation 
for sober and accurate research, then his criticism would carry some 
weight.
<p>There are, of course, serious moral questions which should be raised 
about the kind of hoax Jammal performed. Is the intent to discredit an 
entire world view or to reveal the inadequacies of particular 
organizations or individuals? If the latter, is the hoax the only way to 
bring public attention to these inadequacies, or are other methods 
available which would be about as effective? Are those being hoaxed 
given an adequate chance to avoid falling into the trap? (See Bok, 1978 
and 1989, for a discussion of moral considerations involving the use of 
deception to expose certain kinds of practices. MacDougall {1958, pp. 
262-282} describes historical examples of "hoaxes of exposure" designed 
to expose excessive credulity and other failings.) Some have accused 
Jammal and other hoaxers of seeking personal publicity through the hoax, 
and his status as an out-of-work actor cannot be dismissed in this case, 
as noted by the Sun psychiatrist who examined Jammal's account.</p>
<p>Whatever Jammal's intent, his hoax has clearly demonstrated the 
inadequacy of the research of Sun International Pictures and brought it 
to public attention after letter writing campaigns and even books of 
criticism have failed to do so. Sun had every chance to avoid being 
caught by the hoax, but disregarded the evidence and chose to produce a 
program filled with inaccuracies and misrepresentations. Now it must 
face the consequences, as must CBS which must take some responsibility 
in the matter. Perhaps CBS cannot be expected to test the claims in all 
of its "nonfiction" programs, as they claimed in their defense, but they 
certainly have access to experts in the scientific and skeptical 
communities who could easily have warned them of the questionable nature 
of this and other Sun productions. Regular warnings to local television 
stations from regional skeptics groups, and to national television 
networks from such national skeptics organizations as CSICOP and the 
Skeptics Society, are routinely ignored. The consequences can be seen in 
this event and will continue to be observed until they show a modicum of 
skepticism about what is aired on their stations.</p>

<h1>THE INCREDIBLE MYSTERIES OF SUN PICTURES</h1>
<h2><a href="02.3.about-bloomberg.html">By David Bloomberg</a></h2>

Over the past year, CBS has shown several specials produced by
Sun International Pictures, Inc.  These shows have all dealt with the
Bible in one way or another and have been heavily biased towards the
pro-literalism, pro-creationism side.  Skeptics are included for
short segments that believers then seemingly tear apart, along with
acting clips supporting the stories as they appear in the Bible.
There have been a number of reports questioning the veracity of these
previous shows, but new information warrants another, much closer,
look at Sun and their methods.
<p>As reported in earlier articles, <em>Time</em> magazine and the
Associated Press (AP) ran stories claiming that George Jammal, one of
the claimants who appeared on Sun's "The Incredible Discovery of
Noah's Ark," actually fabricated the entire story to expose Sun's
shoddy research.  This he did with the help of Dr. Gerald Larue, a
professor emeritus of biblical history and archaeology at the
University of Southern California and Skeptics Society advisor, who
had appeared in an earlier Sun production.</p>
<p>Jammal's story, as told on the Sun show, was that he and a
companion had gone to Mt. Ararat to search for the Ark.  According to
the story, they found it and took a number of pictures, but Jammal's
companion was killed and all of the photos were lost.  Jammal had one
bit of evidence to show for his trip--a piece of wood that supposedly
came from the Ark.  This entire story has now been shown to be false.</p>
<p>However, when Larue first described the hoax to <em>Time</em> and
others, Jammal did not immediately address the issue.  During a
telephone interview before he began discussing the issue publicly, he
said that, under his lawyer's advice, he had no comment at the time.
According to Skeptics Society Director Michael Shermer and Dr. Larue,
Jammal was not saying anything because he was afraid of getting sued
by Sun and/or CBS.  In a phone interview at that time, Sun's David
Balsiger was asked what would happen if Jammal came out and admitted
that the story was fabricated.  Balsiger said that there may be legal
implications to hoaxing a network.  He also said, "CBS attorneys were
trying to speak to Dr. Larue and he would not get back to them."  To
this day, Larue says he has never been contacted by CBS or their
attorneys.  Since that time, Jammal did face the issue at the Freedom
From Religion Foundation (FFRF) convention on October 23, and now
discusses it freely.  Balsiger said, in a recent telephone interview,
that there are no plans for Sun or himself to take legal action
against Jammal or Larue, as it would probably be "impractical" (Jammal
has no money) and the press might construe it as being an attack by
CBS behind the scenes.</p>
<p>But Sun's actions before Jammal discussed the hoax deserve some
attention.  After the <em>Time</em> article, Sun fired back with a six-page
response (see <em>Skeptic</em> Vol. 2 #2) while CBS remained mostly silent.
The Sun response sought to address four issues: Who is making the
claim that Jammal fabricated his account?  Did Sun perform due
diligence in its research of the Jammal account?  Was the piece of
wood alleged to have come from the Ark authentic?  Is Mr.  Jammal's
account still factual?</p>
<p>In answer to the first question, the response talked about Dr.
Larue. They claimed the following: "Dr. LaRue [sic] is probably
conducting some type of a vindictive campaign against Sun."  They went
on to say, "Since 1982, Dr. LaRue has served as chairman of the
Committee for the Scientific Examination of Religion, a group
dedicated to refuting Bible claims; was the consulting editor
(1987-1989) and Emeritus President of the National Hemlock Society, a
euthanasia advocacy organization; and is the senior editor of <em>Free
Inquiry</em>, a humanist magazine published by the U.S.  Council for
Democratic and Secular Humanism, another group with goals of removing
religion from society and Bible oriented programs from public
broadcast."</p>
<p>But what did this have to do with whether or not Larue coached
Jammal, or whether the story, as printed by <em>Time</em>, was true?
Nothing, but apparently Sun was trying to imply that because Larue is
a secular humanist and is upset at Sun, his claims of having aided
Jammal are automatically false. Rather than trying to defend against
his claims or find out the truth behind them, Sun began by attacking
the man making those claims, the classic <em>ad hominem</em> attack.</p>
<p>The Sun response then went on to defend their research of
Jammal's story.  They said they interviewed Jammal, looking for flaws
and inconsistencies in the story, and then gave the interview tapes to
a psychiatrist, Dr. Paul Meier, who served as the field physician on
an earlier Noah's Ark expedition.  Meier told Sun's Chief Researcher,
David Balsiger, that he found the accounts "totally believable."</p>
<p>Meier recorded an interview that was cut from the show, in which
he said of Jammal, "we would call him an 'obsessive-compulsive with
histrionic features.'  What this really means is that he's a
perfectionist performer."  Later in the interview, he says that Jammal
wept while discussing his alleged companion who had been killed by a
rock slide.  Meier uses this show of emotion as evidence to support
the reality of the story.  But earlier, he had already admitted that
Jammal is a "perfectionist performer"!  He knew Jammal was an actor,
but apparently ignored the possibility that Jammal was acting.</p>
<p>In that interview, Meier also admitted that he did not know
Jammal personally and has only studied him from the tapes.  So, the
evidence Sun is using to show their "diligence" is a psychiatrist who
is certainly not unbiased, working from tapes of an interview done
with an actor, giving testimony that it is accurate.  This is what Sun
considers research?</p>
<p>In addition to the psychiatrist, Sun claims they analyzed a map
Jammal gave them showing expedition routes.  According to Sun, "it
could not have been drawn by anyone who did not have experience with
the mountain."  Sun does not, however, explain why this is so.  It has
now been shown, through Jammal's admission of the hoax, that this
obviously is not so.  The third portion of the response dealt with the
piece of wood Jammal showed, claiming it was a piece of the Ark.  Sun
began by bluntly admitting that they did not know whether or not it is
real.  However, contradictions then appeared in their response.  They
said, "It has not been the practice of Sun or other production
companies to spend money or time testing and documenting artifacts
shown on the air by interviewees."  That sounds fine, until it is
compared with Balsiger's comments in the AP article.  He said, "We
couldn't test the wood in time for our deadline."  On one hand, Sun
claimed it is not their practice to test such things, on the other,
they claimed they didn't have time to test it.  It appears that
somebody needed to get their story straight.</p>
<p>The remainder of that section defended Sun's refusal to test such
things by saying their shows are "entertainment" and that they would
have been creating news if they had run the tests.  This brings up the
question of why, through the psychiatrist and the map, they tested
Jammal at all.  Where does Sun draw the line?  How much research is
too much?</p>
<p>The final section dealt with the question that sums it all up,
"Is Mr. Jammal's expedition account of seeing the Ark still factual?"
Sun said they still stood by the account as being accurate, even in
the face of the evidence given by Larue.  "Our position is not
expected to change unless there is an admission by Mr. Jammal of an
elaborate hoax, and how he managed to execute such a clever hoax to
convince a professional psychiatrist and several experienced
Ark-Ararat explorers that he was telling the truth...or until third
party collaborating evidence can substantiate Dr. LaRue's account of
the hoax."</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, Jammal did exactly that.  And Sun found
that they had to change tactics.  Since it was now obvious that Jammal
perpetrated the hoax, they removed virtually all of their attack on
Larue from their new "response", even though it had been their number
one defense originally.  Instead, they switched gears and claimed that
no amount of research could have detected Jammal's hoax, since it was
so well-executed.  Elsewhere in this issue, James Lippard has made it
clear that the hoax was not, in fact, all that well executed, and
minimal research should have told them that the story was untrue (such
as smelling the wood, which reeked of teriyaki sauce!).  And they still
seem to miss the point that simply testing the wood would, in fact,
have given them the information they needed to determine that it was a
hoax.  Also, they are again trying to play both sides of the field by,
on one hand, claiming that no amount of research could have detected
the hoax, and, on the other hand, saying that they make entertainment
shows and don't do research.</p>
<p>Jammal's hoax served to bring out into the open questions
regarding Sun's methodology in writing and producing these shows.  For
example, as the <em>Time</em> article stated, Larue does believe that he was
set up as a straw man by Sun.  In a telephone interview, Larue said
that when Sun came to him for their piece on the fall of the walls of
Jericho, they brought a statement and asked him to read it.  He said
it wasn't exactly the statement he would have made, but it was mostly
in accord with his views. He went on to say, "I read this and was
given the opportunity to expound on why I didn't believe it was a
genuine historical happening."  However, all of that was cut out, and
all that was left in when the show aired was the original statement
that Sun had brought to him. This was followed, according to Larue, by
Dr. Bryant Wood, who went on to give a lengthy discussion of his
point, which countered Larue's and favored the Biblical interpretation
to which all three of Sun's recent shows have been slanted.</p>
<p>Farrell Till, editor of <em>The Skeptical Review</em>, feels the same way
about his own appearance on "Ancient Secrets of the Bible, Part II."
Sun came to Till with a script, the same way they came to Larue.  Till
was told he could change it, and he did so, with the understanding
that his changes would remain in the show.  Instead, his time was cut
down to very little, mostly representing that which had been
originally scripted, and he was dropped altogether from one scene,
replaced by Carol Dickinson, a professor of psychology who simply read
the script.</p>
<p>In the interview before Jammal's FFRF speech, Sun's Balsiger
discussed the interviews.  "Being entertainment, it's a scripted
show," he said.  "But when it comes to the experts, they have the
liberty and the rights to [put] what they're saying any way they want,
the only requirements being that they cannot be excessive on time,
make [their] point fairly quickly, and [they] can't go off on a
tangent where [they're] going to get five minutes, because it doesn't
happen.  Most of our experts always changed something in the script."
He said they try to base the script on what they think the expert will
say, based on research that they've done, but they don't hold them to
it.</p>
<p>In the case of Farrell Till, Balsiger said, "he had three scenes
and wrote a better argument for all three scenes and that's the way we
shot it."  But, he said, "even though we shoot an interviewee doesn't
guarantee it's going to get in the show, it doesn't guarantee that
their piece may not be shortened, it doesn't guarantee that it won't
be edited in some way."</p>
<p>Why is the editing necessary?  Again according to Balsiger, "the
show was over 2 hours too long."  Continuing:</p>
<blockquote>
     We haven't done a show yet that hasn't been at least an
     hour [too] long.  What happens is that we attempt to
     keep as many interviewees in as possible, [so] we have
     to shorten their pieces.  Maybe they were speaking for
     a minute, they get shortened to 30 seconds.  A sentence
     or two is cut off the end or somewhere, not to change
     their point of view or anything, but to let them make
     the longest point they are making in a shorter period
     of time.  I'm not sure exactly what happened in
     [Till's] case.  It may not have been the duration of
     what the interview was.  We also have some other
     requirements that we attempt to meet in each show:
     What is our ratio of women in each show?  Also, does a
     person make more than two appearances?  He could have
     been dropped on his third appearance because he already
     had two appearances and another factor may have been
     that ... we were way down on our females. There's a lot
     of factors that go into these shows, and to the viewer
     it looks like we're rigging something.
</blockquote>
Indeed it does.  For example, if they only allow a person in
twice, why shoot three scenes with him and not tell him beforehand
that one would probably be cut?  If they base the script on their
research of a particular person's views, why did the psychology
professor who replaced Till read the exact remarks that Sun presented
Till?  Did their research indicate that she had the exact same views
as he, and would express them in exactly the same way?  Why were both
scenes with Till and Larue cut down such that essentially only the
original statements, scripted by Sun, were left, even though Balsiger
admitted that Till came up with better arguments?  Why doesn't Sun ask
the interviewees ahead of time which of their arguments should be cut
first, if necessary?  Balsiger said that they have never done a show
that hasn't been too long, so shouldn't they think about editing ahead
of time?  Why give the interviewees the impression that most or all of
what they say will be in the show when it simply doesn't happen?  Sun
needs to answer all of these questions about their procedures if they
expect viewers to stop wondering if they are "rigging something."
<p>Jammal has never been to Mt. Ararat.  He was coached by Larue on
what to say to help back up his story, and aided by a copy of his
original interview with ICR given to him by that organization.  Larue
said, "Jammal's part was designed to expose the hoax that Sun
International was pulling on the people. We felt that the whole CBS
program was a hoax."  He went on to say, "It talks about the discovery
of Noah's Ark.  That's a lie. They never discovered Noah's Ark."  He
said that calling it "The Search For Noah's Ark" or something similar
would have been much more honest.  Larue was very blunt in describing
his views.  "There was no discovery.  The title is a lie.  The idea
that it was a documentary is a lie.  The third lie is that they are
now explaining it as entertainment only.  That was never given clearly
in the text."</p>
<p>In fact, the host of the Noah's Ark show, Darren McGavin, stated at
the beginning that this was a "non-religious, scientific
investigation."  The average viewer would probably think of it,
therefore, as a documentary, not an entertainment show.  But Balsiger
said all of Sun's shows are contracted under the entertainment
division; they are not news, nor documentary.  He calls them reality
TV shows and says they are "actually not allowed to create news. I
personally have gotten in trouble over this issue in the past.  Being
a researcher, it is my inclination to check this or check that, but on
an entertainment type show, we are not mandated, and matter of fact we
[cannot] make news or create news.  On an entertainment show, we are
actually forbidden from doing that and instructed not to do that.  I
did it on another occasion and when it was discovered that I had
tested an artifact, [which] proved what the interviewee was trying to
make, it ended up getting not used, period."</p>
<p>When asked about the narrator calling it a "scientific
investigation," Balsiger said it "may be splitting hairs on something
that was said by the host, but it should have been pretty clear that
our show was an entertainment."  Asked how this should have been
clear, he indicated that it should have been obvious from the context.
He said that news shows and documentaries are produced by the network
news side of the network, while this was not.  He added, "We've only
done entertainment shows over the years.  Reality TV shows are
entertainment. Always have been, always will be."  Balsiger said that
he considers shows such as "Unsolved Mysteries" to also be reality TV
shows.  However, "Unsolved Mysteries" makes a point of telling the
audience before every airing of an episode that it is not a news
broadcast.  When this was pointed out to Balsiger in a more recent
interview, he said that, in hindsight, it would have been a good idea
to have such a disclaimer, but nobody at CBS or Sun thought of it.  If
he had it to do over again, he said he would add a disclaimer to every
show of this type.</p>
<p>Before Jammal's speech to the FFRF, Balsiger said CBS planned to
air more "reality TV" from Sun.  Even though the AP story said that
CBS claimed they had no other Sun programs scheduled, Balsiger said
that they had a show, "Ancient Mysteries of the World," planned to air
on CBS in November, and one on UFOs that was supposed to air in
December.  He said there were others under development with CBS.  Why
didn't CBS mention these in the AP story?  Well, it seems that the
answer may be that CBS was, in fact, wising up.  A letter from
Balsiger, dated November 12, 1993 (addressed: To Whom It May Concern),
said that CBS has cancelled all of the Sun shows in production.  In
addition, the letter states that Balsiger believes a weekly show on
UFOs which Sun had planned for cable may be canceled due to the bad
publicity.  In the recent interview, Balsiger said that Sun has laid
off much of its staff, including himself, as a result of the expos,
and he does not expect to work for them again.  He added that it is
very unlikely that Sun will do any projects for network TV for at
least two to three years, due to the "tremendous damage" caused by the
bad publicity, and that he will probably be restricted in the kind of
work that he can do.  He said it is probable that he will only be able
to work with non-network broadcast, such as feature films, and that he
has a possible offer to work on a project for the public school
market.</p>
<p>Have Sun and Balsiger learned anything from the hoax?  Balsiger
said that Sun's research practices did "tighten up" some after the
hoax was initially revealed.  "Extra measures," such as checking the
credibility of their interviewees with third parties, and looking at
previous publications by those interviewees, were used in the program
they were preparing for CBS at the time.  However, he said they still
would not test "artifacts," and the extra measures got to the point
that it "wasn't worth doing these kinds of shows any more."  With the
possibility of working on a project for the public schools, what kind
of research will he be doing now, since he seems exasperated by even
those few measures instituted by Sun in the wake of the Ark fiasco?</p>
<p>Even with the cancellations and layoffs, it seems that there are
a number of unanswered questions regarding Sun and CBS.  <em>L.A. Times</em>
TV critic Howard Rosenberg called for an explanation from CBS (July 7,
1993), but has gotten none.  He called their stance an "incredible
double standard regarding truth in news and entertainment
programming."  Perhaps the cancellation of future Sun productions is
CBS's unspoken response.</p>
<p>So where are the answers?  Jammal has admitted to having made up
the story; will Sun and CBS retract the story publicly and admit that
they need overhaul their research procedures?  Or are the few steps
taken by Sun the extent of such an overhaul, while they continue to
say that, as "entertainment," they don't need to do any research?</p>
<p>The line between news and entertainment is getting dangerously
blurred.  When a narrator calls a show a "scientific investigation"
but the viewer is expected to somehow realize that it is just
"entertainment," that line has been removed altogether.</p>

<a name="intro"</a>
Thousands of patients (mostly women) in the United States have undergone 
or are undergoing attempted treatment by psychotherapists for a non-
existent memory disorder. As a result, these same therapists have 
unwittingly promoted the development of a real memory disorder: False 
Memory Syndrome. To make sense of this unfortunate situation, I need to 
offer a few definitions.
<p>Some psychotherapists believe that childhood sexual abuse is the 
specific cause of numerous physical and mental ills later in life. Some 
term this <em>Incest Survivor Syndrome (ISS)</em>. There is no firm evidence 
that this is the case, since even where there has been documented sexual 
abuse during childhood, there are numerous other factors that can 
explain physical or emotional complaints that appear years later in an 
adult.</p>
<p>These therapists believe that the children immediately <em>repress</em> all 
memory of sexual abuse shortly after it occurs, causing it to vanish 
from recollection without a trace. The price for having <em>repressed 
memories</em> is said to be the eventual development of ISS.</p>
<p>Therapists attempt to "cure" ISS by engaging patients in <em>recovered 
memory therapy (RMT)</em>, a hodge-podge of techniques varying with each 
therapist. The purpose of RMT is to enable the patient to <em>recover</em> into 
consciousness not only wholly accurate recollections of ancient sexual 
traumas, but also repressed <em>body memories</em> (such as physical pains) 
that occurred at the time of the traumas.</p>
<p>In actuality, RMT produces disturbing fantasies which are 
misperceived by the patient and misinterpreted by the therapist as 
memories. Mislabeled by the therapist and patient as <em>recovered 
memories</em>, they are actually <em>false memories</em>.</p>
<p>The vast majority of false memory cases developing from RMT are in 
women, which is why this article assumes patients to be female.</p>

<a name="init">
<h2>Initiation of Patients into RMT</h2>
</a>

A woman consults a psychotherapist for relief of various emotional 
complaints. The therapist informs her that she may have been molested as 
a child and does not know it, and this could explain her symptoms. Some 
patients think this idea is absurd and go to another therapist; others 
accept the therapist's suggestions and stay on. More than a few women 
have heard about repressed memories from talk shows or tabloids even 
prior to coming to the therapists office, and may even make the 
appointment believing they too could be "victims."
<p>Though the patient has no memories of abuse, she becomes motivated 
for "memory recovery" since she is told this will cure her symptoms. The 
therapist will offer encouragement that "memories" will return. 
Suggestive dreams or new pains are interpreted by the therapist as proof 
that repressed memories are lurking.</p>
<p>The therapist may refer the patient to a "survivor recovery group." 
There she will meet women who further encourage her to keep trying to 
remember. Attendance at these support groups, as well as assigned 
reading in self-help books, surrounds the patient with validation for 
the therapist's theories.</p>
<p>The vast majority of women with FMS are white, middle class, and 
above average in education. This corresponds to the profile of a typical 
woman who enters long term psychotherapy, and who perceives such 
activity as an important way to solve life's problems.</p>

<a name="generate">
<h2>Generating False Memories</h2>
</a>

Unlike courts of law which obtain objective evidence where allegations 
of evil-doing are made, RMT solely directs the patient to attend toward 
her inner world for "proof" she was sexually abused. Such RMT techniques 
may include:
<ul>
<li>Meditation on fantasy production, such as pictures drawn in "art 
therapy," dreams, or stream of consciousness journal writing.</li>
<li>Hearing or reading about the "recovered memories" of other women 
which can serve as inspirations.</li>
<li>Amytal interviews ("truth serum") and/or hypnosis (including "age 
regression" where the patient is told she is temporarily being 
transformed into the way she was when she was five years old).</li>
<li>Telling the patient to review family albums; if she looks sad in 
some of her childhood photos, she is told this is further confirmation 
that abuse occurred.</li>
</ul>

<a name="dark">
<h2>The Dark Side of "Recovery"</h2>
</a>

Patients start out RMT with the hope that things will be better once 
they recover their repressed memories. But usually life becomes far more 
complicated.
<p>The FMS patient will often become estranged from the "perpetrator" 
(most often her father). If the patient has small children, they will be 
off limits to "perpetrators" as well. Relationships with other family 
members becomes contingent on their not challenging the patient's 
beliefs.</p>
<p>Therapists may urge parents to come for a "family conference" in 
order to allow the patient to surprise the "perpetrator" with a 
rehearsed confrontation. Family members are usually too shocked and 
disorganized to coherently respond to accusations. The rationale for 
this scenario is that since "survivors" feel powerless, they need 
"empowerment."</p>
<p>FMS patients may file belated crime reports with local law 
enforcement agencies and may go on to sue "perpetrators." Such lawsuits 
demand compensation for bills from psychotherapists and possibly other 
doctors who treated adult medical problems that therapists somehow link 
to childhood traumas. Of course, there may be demands for "punitive 
damages." Spouses of "perpetrators" (usually the patient's mother) may 
be sued as well for being negligent, thus making householder's insurance 
into a courtroom piggy bank. Since FMS patients sincerely believe they 
have been victimized, more than a few juries have given verdicts 
sympathetic to them.</p>
<p>Preoccupied with the continuing chores of "memory recovery," the FMS 
patient may come to ignore more pressing problems with her marriage, 
family, schooling, or career. Often the time demands and expense of the 
therapy itself become a major life disruption.</p>
<p>Some patients during the course of RMT develop "multiple personality 
disorder" (MPD). RMT therapists have claimed that they need to not only 
recover repressed memories, but also to uncover repressed personality 
fragments; some women come to believe they are repositories of dozens of 
hidden personalities ("alters"). "Alters" have their own names and 
characteristics, and may identify themselves as men or even animals. An 
increasing number of psychiatrists and psychologists are coming to view 
MPD as a product of environmental suggestion and reinforcement, since 
the diagnosis was hardly made prior to ten years ago. One area where 
there is no controversy: once MPD is diagnosed, therapy bills become 
astronomical.</p>
<p>Some FMS patients become convinced that their abuse was actually 
"satanic ritual abuse" (SRA), due to participation by relatives in a 
secret satanic cult. Some therapists believe SRA is the work of a vast 
underground cult network in these United States. No evidence beyond 
"recovered memories" has ever been offered as proof that satanic cults 
exist at this claimed level of frequency. Therapists who lecture on the 
topic have explained away the lack of evidence that such cults exist by 
claiming that no defectors speak out due to iron-clad secrecy via 
brainwashing and terror.</p>

<a name="care">
<h2>The Care and Maintenance of False Memories</h2>
</a>

FMS involves a combination of mistaken perceptions and false beliefs. 
The fledgling FMS patient is encouraged to "connect" with an environment 
that will reinforce the FMS state, and is encouraged to "disconnect" 
from people or information that might lead her to question the results 
of RMT.
<p>The FMS subculture is victim-oriented. Even though they have not 
undergone anticancer chemotherapy or walked away from airplane crashes, 
FMS patients are told they too are "survivors." This becomes a kind of 
new identity, giving FMS patients the feeling of a strong bond with 
other "survivors" of abuse. Patients will often start attending 
"survivor" support groups, subscribe to "survivor" newsletters, or even 
attend "survivor" conventions (sometimes with their therapists).</p>
<p>They will read books found in "recovery" sections of bookstores. The 
best known book, <em>The Courage to Heal</em>, is weighty, literate, and thus 
appears authoritative. Authors Laura Davis and Ellen Bass have no formal 
training in psychology, psychiatry, or memory. This paperback, modestly 
priced at $20, has sold over 700,000 copies.</p>
<p>Patients are told to shy away from dialogue with skeptical friends or 
relatives, since this will hinder their "recovery." "Perpetrators" who 
proclaim their innocence cannot be taken seriously since they are "in 
denial" and incapable of telling the truth.</p>
<p>Aside from these social influences, people by nature often resist 
seeing themselves as being in error. It can be terribly painful to 
acknowledge having made a big mistake, particularly when harmful 
consequences have resulted.</p>
<p>RMT exploits the tendency within each of us to blame others for our 
problems, and to latch onto simple answers for life's complicated 
problems. RMT therapists suggest that aside from entirely ruining 
childhoods, childhood sexual abuse can explain anything and everything 
that goes wrong during adulthood. RMT becomes the ultimate crybaby 
therapy.</p>

<a name="memory">
<h2>How Memory Really Works</h2>
</a>

In Freud's theory of "repression" the mind automatically banishes 
traumatic events from memory to prevent overwhelming anxiety. Freud 
further theorized that repressed memories cause "neurosis," which could 
be cured if the memories were made conscious. While all this is taught 
in introductory psychology courses and has been taken by novelists and 
screenwriters to be a truism, Freud's repression theory has never been 
verified by rigorous scientific proof.
<p>Freud, were he alive today, would be traumatized to see how RMT has 
redefined his pet concept. While Freud talked of the repression of 
single traumatic episodes, today's therapists maintain that dozens of 
similar traumatic episodes occurring over years are repressed with 100% 
efficiency.</p>
<p>The well known syndrome of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder shows us 
that verifiable traumatic events, rather than disappearing from memory, 
leave trauma victims haunted by intrusive memories in which the victim 
relives the trauma. For those who were in Nazi concentration camps or 
underwent torture as POWs in Vietnam, this can become a serious lifelong 
problem.</p>
<p>People forget most of what occurs to them, including some events that 
were pleasant or significant to them at the time. If an event is lost 
from memory, there is no scientific way to prove whether it was 
"repressed" or simply forgotten. And there is no reason that memories of 
sexual abuse should be handled any differently than childhood memories 
of physical abuse or of emergency surgery.</p>
<p>Events that have slipped away from memory cannot be recalled with the 
accuracy of a videotape. Individuals forget not only insignificant 
events in their entirety, but also significant events. Some events 
(traumatic or not) are recalled, but with significant details altered.</p>
<p>A study of children whose school was attacked by a sniper showed that 
some who were not on the school grounds later insisted they had personal 
recollections of being in school during the attack. These false memories 
apparently were inspired by exposure to the stories of those who truly 
experienced the trauma.</p>
<p>Memories can be deliberately distorted in adults by presenting a 
display of visual information, and later exposing subjects to verbal 
disinformation about what they saw. This disinformation often becomes 
incorporated into memory, contaminating the ultimate memories that are 
recalled.</p>
<p>To be sure, some who enter therapy were abused as children, but they 
have always remembered this abuse. They do not need special help in 
"memory recovery" to tell the therapist what happened to them.</p>

<a name="therapy">
<h2>Why Recovered Memory Therapy is Bad Therapy</h2>
</a>

RMT purportedly is undertaken to help patients recover from the effects 
of sexual abuse from childhood; however, at the onset of RMT there is no 
evidence that such abuse ever occurred. Thus, instead of a therapist 
having some evidence for a diagnosis and then adopting a proper 
treatment plan, RMT therapists use the "treatment" to produce their 
diagnosis.
<p>Some RMT therapists over-attribute common psychological complaints as 
signs of forgotten childhood sexual abuse. In their zeal to find 
memories, these therapists overlook any and all alternative explanations 
for the patient's complaints.</p>
<p>RMT therapists ignore basic psychological principles that all 
individuals are suggestible, and that patients in distress seeking 
psychotherapy are particularly likely to adopt beliefs and biases of 
their therapist.</p>
<p>Many RMT therapists have studied neither basic sciences related to 
memory, nor the diagnosis of actual diseases of memory. Their knowledge 
is often based on a single weekend seminar, as opposed to years of 
formal training in any graduate program they attended to get their 
licenses.</p>
<p>Hypnosis and sodium amytal administration ("truth serum") are 
unacceptable procedures for memory recovery. Courts reject hypnosis as a 
memory aid. Subjects receiving hypnosis or amytal as general memory aids 
(even in instances where there is no question of sexual abuse) will 
often generate false memories. Upon returning to their normal state of 
consciousness, subjects assume all their refreshed "memories" are 
equally true.</p>
<p>RMT therapists generally make no attempt to verify "recovered 
memories" by interviewing third parties, or obtaining pediatric or 
school records. Some have explained that they do not verify the serious 
allegations that arise from RMT because their job is simply to help the 
patient feel "safe" and "recover."</p>
<p>Many patients who have known all their lives that they were 
mistreated or neglected by their parents, decide as adults to be friends 
with the offending parents. By contrast, RMT therapists encourage their 
patients, on the basis of "recovered memories," to break off 
relationships with the alleged "perpetrators" as well as other relatives 
who disagree with the patient's views. This is completely at odds with 
the traditional goals of therapists: to allow competent patients to make 
their own important decisions, and to improve their patient's 
relationships with others.</p>
<p>Patients undergoing RMT often undergo an increase of symptoms as 
their treatment progresses, with corresponding disruption in their 
personal lives. Few therapists will seek consultation in order to 
clarify the problem, assuming instead that it is due to sexual abuse 
having been worse than anyone might have imagined.</p>

<a name="other">
<h2>Other Kinds of FMS</h2>
</a>

Some individuals come to believe that they lived "past lives" as a 
result of having undergone "past life therapy." This phenomenon 
generally develops in participants who are grounded in the New Age 
zeitgeist and already open to "discovering" their past lives. They 
enroll in seminars which can run up to an entire weekend and will 
involve some measure of group hypnotic induction and guided meditations. 
This sort of FMS also involves continuing group reinforcement. In 
contrast to horrific images of sexual abuse, recollections of "past 
lives" are generally pleasant and interesting. Few participants will 
recall spending prior lives in lunatic asylums or dungeons. The whole 
experience is assumed to be therapeutic by helping participants better 
understand the situation of their present lives.
<p>A small number of individuals develop "recovered memories" of being 
abducted by aliens from outer space. Almost always these individuals had 
some curiosity about this area and were hardly skeptics before they fell 
into an alien abduction FMS.</p>
<p>In contrast to women who are plagued with concerns that they were 
sexually abused, these varieties of FMS are of a much more benign nature 
and do not disrupt personal functioning or family life. While some of 
these individuals suffer the ignominy of being perceived as "kooks," 
they may receive compensating group support from those who share their 
beliefs.</p>

<a name="future">
<h2>A Word About the Future</h2>
</a>

Increasing numbers of women who claimed to have recovered memories of 
sexual abuse have retracted their claims and now see themselves as 
having had FMS. This may spontaneously occur when women relocate to 
another locale and lose contact with their prior therapists and support 
group. Without the "positive reinforcement" from others to encourage 
false memory development and maintenance, some women begin to doubt the 
veracity of what they had believed was true. While some remain suspended 
in a twilight of doubt, others have fully recanted.
<p>These retractors may have a profound influence on getting women with 
an active FMS to re-evaluate their situation. While FMS patients learn 
from the FMS culture to dismiss critics as either "perpetrators" or 
their apologists, the voice of a woman who says she is recovering <em>from</em> 
FMS is more easily heard.</p>
<p>Although most influential among family counselors and social workers, 
RMT affected the practices of some licensed psychologists and 
psychiatrists, some of whom were practicing in special "dissociative 
disorders units" in psychiatric hospitals. These activities have gone on 
with little challenge, until recently.</p>
<p>The number of women with FMS who have become retractors is 
increasing. Some have sued their former therapists for malpractice (see 
Laura Pasley's story in this issue of <em>Skeptic</em>), and others are 
weighing the possibilities of doing so. One malpractice insurance 
carrier for clinical psychologists in California recently tripled its 
rates without explanation; this has led to speculation that the carrier 
is anticipating increasing numbers of lawsuits alleging that 
psychologists caused FMS.</p>
<p>The False Memory Syndrome Foundation, formed in 1991, has been 
contacted by over 7,000 families in the U.S. and Canada who believe 
their grown children have FMS, and these families let their views be 
known to state licensing boards and professional organizations. Managed 
care administrators are starting to question megabills submitted by RMT 
therapists, some of whom see their patients through lengthy psychiatric 
hospitalizations. Understandably, all of this has gained the attention 
of the American Psychiatric Association and American Psychological 
Association, who are setting up task forces to try to examine the whole 
phenomenon.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, there is a large FMS subculture consisting of women 
convinced that their "recovered memories" are accurate, therapists 
keeping busy doing RMT, and of authors on the "recovery" lecture and 
talk show circuits. In addition, there are some vocal fringes of the 
feminist movement that cherish RMT since it is "proof" that men are 
dangerous and rotten, unless proven otherwise. Skeptical challenges to 
RMT are met by emotional rejoinders that critics are front groups for 
perpetrators, and make the ridiculous analogy that "some people even say 
the Holocaust did not happen."</p>
<p>RMT will eventually disappear, but not next month.</p>

The clich&eacute; that "there is nothing new under the sun" applies more than 
ever to the mental health profession today. We seem to be experiencing a 
myriad of new techniques to treat the developmentally disabled, 
Facilitated Communication being one of the most popular, yet in reality 
their underlying characteristics have been seen before. These components 
make up the structure of what might be considered a social movement:
<ul>
<li>Assertions that a new technique produces remarkable effects are 
made in the absence of solid objective evidence, or what little evidence 
there is becomes highly overblown.</li>
<li>Excitement about a possible breakthrough sweeps rapidly through the 
communities of parents, teachers, service providers, and others 
concerned with the welfare of individuals with disabilities.</li>
<li>Eager, even desperate for something that might help, many invest 
considerable financial and emotional resources in the new technique.</li>
<li>In the process, effective or potentially effective techniques are 
ignored.</li>
<li>Few question the basis for the claims about the new treatment or 
the qualifications of the individuals making them.</li>
<li>Anecdotal reports that seem to confirm the initial claims 
proliferate rapidly.</li>
<li>Careful scientific evaluation to determine the real effects of the 
technique are not completed for some time, and can be made more 
difficult than usual by the well-known and powerful effects of 
expectancies.</li>
<li>Some of these techniques have small specific positive effects, or 
at least do minimal harm.</li>
<li>Eventually they fall out of favor, sometimes because they are 
discredited by sound research, sometimes simply because experience 
reveals their lack of efficacy, but probably most often because another 
fad treatment has come on the scene. Each retains some adherents, 
however, and some go relatively dormant for a while only to emerge 
again.</li>
</ul>
Parallel phenomena occur in other areas, such as treatments for AIDS, 
cancer, and various psychological problems. At present the field of 
developmental disabilities (especially autism) seems to be experiencing 
an epidemic of novel techniques, or "interventions," as they are called. 
Despite its parallels with other techniques, Facilitated Communication 
(FC) has probably had a greater impact than any other novel intervention 
in the history of treatment for persons with disabilities.

<a name="works"> 
<h2>How FC Works</h2>
</a>

How does FC work? If you have never seen it in action it is quite a 
phenomenon to observe. Individuals with "severe communication 
impairments" (e.g., severe mental retardation, autism) are assisted in 
spelling words by "facilitators" (teachers or  parents) who provide 
physical support, most often (at least initially) by holding their hand, 
wrist, or forearm while they point to letters on a keyboard or printed 
letter display. Right before your eyes, a mentally disabled person that 
just previously had virtually no communication skills, suddenly begins 
to spell out words, sentences, and whole paragraphs. Stories are told. 
Answers to questions are given. A child that did not appear to know the 
difference between a dog and an elephant can now be shown a series of 
pictures, correctly identifying them one by one, as his or her hand 
glides deftly over the keyboard, pecking out the correct letters. The 
assumption, of course, is that most of the words spelled in this fashion 
actually originate with the disabled partner and not the facilitator.
<p>On its face, FC can seem simple and benign, and sometimes looks quite 
convincing. Its main proponents sometimes characterize FC simply as a 
strategy for teaching individuals to point in order to access systems 
like synthetic speech devices and keyboards to augment their 
communication. At the same time, however, they claim that it is a 
revolutionary means of unlocking highly developed literacy, numeracy, 
and communication repertoires in large numbers of individuals previously 
thought to have severe learning difficulties. For all the world it looks 
like a mental miracle, the kind of stuff they make movies about, as in 
"Awakenings."</p>
<p>The theory is that many such individuals do not have cognitive 
deficits at all, but instead have a presumed neuromotor impairment that 
prevents them from initiating and controlling vocal expression. Their 
average or even above average intelligence is locked away, awaiting 
release. The neuromotor disorder is also presumed to manifest itself in 
"hand function impairments" that make it necessary for someone else to 
stabilize the individual's hand and arm for pointing, and to pull the 
pointing hand back between selections to minimize impulsive or poorly 
planned responding. Candidates for FC are also presumed to lack 
confidence in their abilities, and so require the special touch and 
emotional support of a facilitator to communicate, (i.e., a strap or 
device to hold the person's arm steady will not work).</p>
<p>FC thus has an almost irresistible appeal for parents, teachers, and 
other caring persons who struggle mightily to understand and communicate 
with individuals who often do not respond or communicated in return. But 
the very features that make FC so seductive, in combination with some 
other potent factors, have made it a topic of heated debate between 
believers and skeptics since its "discovery" in Australia nearly two 
decades ago.</p>

<a name="begin">
<h2>Beginnings Down Under</h2>
</a>

It all began in the 1970s with Rosemary Crossley, a teacher in an 
institution in Melbourne in the Australian state of Victoria. She 
suspected that some of her young charges with severe cerebral palsy had 
far more ability than their physical impairments allowed them to 
demonstrate. When she gave them hand or arm support to help them point 
to pictures, letters, and other stimuli, Crossley became convinced that 
several of the children revealed literacy and math skills that they had 
somehow developed with little or no instruction, despite having lived 
most of their lives in an impoverished institutional environment. 
<p>Right away there was controversy about the technique that Crossley 
called Facilitated Communication Training. Two people were involved in 
creating the messages, and simple observation could not reveal how much 
each was contributing. Plus, many of the messages Crossley attributed to 
these institutionalized individuals defied plausibility. "Facilitated" 
accusations of abuse  and expressions of wishes for major life changes 
(like leaving the institution) made it imperative to determine whether 
communications actually originated with the disabled individual or the 
facilitator. Matters were complicated by Crossley's emerging status as a 
heroine to many in the deinstitutionalization movement. Eventually, 
after a series of legal proceedings, a young woman with cerebral palsy 
with whom Crossley had developed a special relationship through FC was 
released from the institution to reside with Crossley. The institution 
was closed, and in 1986 Crossley started (with government financial 
support) the DEAL Centre (Dignity through Education and Language) to 
promote alternative communication approaches--principally FC--for 
individuals with severe communication impairments. Use of the method 
spread to programs in Victoria serving persons with various 
disabilities, accompanied by controversies about communications 
attributed to FC users on the basis of subjective reports.</p>
<p>Sufficiently serious issues arose to provoke formal statements of 
concern from professionals and parents in 1988, and a government-sponsored
investigation in 1989. Despite Crossley's resistance to 
objective testing (on the basis that FC users refused to cooperate when 
their competence was questioned), some small-scale controlled 
evaluations were conducted in the course of that investigation. When the 
facilitator's knowledge about expected messages was well-controlled 
(more on this later), and the accuracy of messages was evaluated 
objectively, the effect disappeared. The disabled individuals were 
unable to communicate beyond their normal expectation. Instead, it 
appeared that the facilitators were authoring most FC messages, 
apparently without their awareness. These early studies suggested that 
FC was susceptible to a somewhat unusual kind of abuse: Allowing others 
to impose their own wishes, fears, hopes, and agendas on nonspeaking 
individuals.</p>

<a name="social">
<h2>A Social Movement is Born</h2>
</a>

At about that time Douglas Biklen, a special education professor from 
Syracuse University, conducted a four week observational study of 21 
DEAL clients said to be autistic, who were reported to engage in high-
level discourse with the help of facilitators. Professor Biklen was 
already established as a leader in the "total inclusion movement," which 
seeks the full-time placement of all students with disabilities, 
regardless of their competencies and needs, in regular classrooms. The 
report describing his first qualitative study of FC, which Biklen said 
was begun "in an attempt not to test hypotheses but rather to generate 
them," appeared in the Harvard Educational Review in 1990. He reported 
that the communication of the individuals he observed (some of whom were 
being "facilitated" for the first time) was sophisticated in content, 
conceptualization, and vocabulary, and contained frequent references to 
feelings, wishes to be treated normally and to attend regular schools, 
and society's treatment of individuals with disabilities. 
<p>This was in sharp contrast with the well-documented difficulties in 
social, play, cognitive, and communication skills that constitute 
current diagnostic criteria for autism (not to mention that the 
diagnosis is difficult to make and is applied to individuals with a wide 
range of competencies and deficits in all those domains). In his seminal 
article, Biklen mentioned the controversy over the Australian findings, 
but asserted that informal "indicators that communication was the 
person's own were strong enough, in my view, to justify the continuing 
assumption of its validity" [italics added].</p>
<p>Some of the indicators he reported observing were disabled 
individuals typing independently or with minimal physical contact with 
the facilitator; content (spelling errors, unexpected word usage, etc.) 
that appeared to be unique to each individual; and facial expressions or 
other signs that the individual understood the communication. He also 
noted that facilitators often could not tell who was doing the spelling 
and that they could be influencing the FC in subtle ways without their 
awareness, and that this could be a problem. Finally, on the basis of 
his uncontrolled observations and the reports of Crossley and other 
facilitators, Biklen decided that autism had to be redefined as a 
problem not of cognition or affect, but of voluntary motor control. He 
returned from Australia to establish the Facilitated Communication 
Institute (FCI) at Syracuse University, and the North American FC 
movement was underway.</p>

<a name="takeoff">
<h2>The Movement Takes Off</h2>
</a>

Word of FC spread quickly with the help of several media reports of FC 
"miracles." The rate of information exchange increased geometrically, 
feeding the system and driving it forward. FC newsletters, conferences, 
and support networks contributed to the spread of astonishing success 
stories, along with examples of prose and poetry attributed to FC 
authors. The Syracuse FCI began training new facilitators in earnest, in 
workshops that lasted from a few hours to two or three days. At least 
two New England universities became satellite programs of the Syracuse 
FC Institute, as did numerous other private and public agencies that 
provided training and support for facilitators. Initiates (parents, 
paraprofessionals, and professionals in several disciplines) were often 
told that the technique was simple and required no special training. 
They were urged to train others, and to go out and try FC with disabled 
individuals. Thousands did. Soon FC was being heralded as a means of 
"empowering" individuals with severe disabilities to make their own 
decisions and participate fully in society. FC was rapidly becoming the 
Politically Correct treatment of choice.   
<p>Soon after publication of Biklen's article, special education 
personnel and parents around Syracuse, then throughout the U.S. and 
Canada, adopted FC enthusiastically. Scores of children were placed in 
regular classrooms doing grade-level academic work with "facilitation." 
Decisions about the lives of adults with severe disabilities--living 
arrangements, medical and other treatments, use of hearing aids, and so 
on--were  based on "facilitated" messages without any attempt to verify 
authorship objectively. In many cases FC supplanted other communication 
modes, including vocal speech and augmentative communication systems, 
that do not require another person for message creation. Some 
psychologists, speech pathologists, and others began giving I.Q. and 
other standardized tests with "facilitation," changing diagnoses and 
program recommendations in accordance with the "facilitated" results. 
Suddenly "retarded" individuals were proclaimed to have average or 
above-average intelligence. "Facilitated" counseling and psychotherapy 
were promoted to help FC users deal with personal problems. Colleges and 
universities offered courses on FC. Millions of tax dollars were 
invested in promoting its widespread adoption, with little objective 
evaluation of its validity or efficacy.</p>

<a name="psi">
<h2>Enter Psi, Exit Science</h2>
</a>

Not surprisingly, the experience of accomplishing a breakthrough and 
being part of a movement was a heady experience for many facilitators. 
Some, however, reported wondering all along whether the words being 
produced through FC were really coming from their disabled partners. 
Others who had serious doubts about the method from the outset found 
themselves under considerable pressure from parents, peers, and 
employers to adopt the method wholesale and without question. Reports 
that facilitators' private thoughts were being expressed through FC led 
some to conclude that individuals with autism must have telepathy--a 
view espoused by a professor of special education at the University of 
Wisconsin, among others.
<p>Facilitators were also imbued, explicitly and implicitly, with a 
strong ideology that presents dilemmas for many who want to know who is 
really communicating in FC. Some components of the ideology include: </p>
<ul>
<li>Assume competence.</li>
<li>Don't test.</li>
<li>Prevent errors.</li>
<li>Expect remarkable revelations in the form of hidden skills as well 
as sensitive personal information.</li>
<li>Use circumstantial, subjective data to validate authorship.</li>
<li>Avoid objective scrutiny.</li>
<li>Emphasize "facilitated" over spoken or other communications.</li>
</ul>
Contradictory evidence from the controlled evaluations that had been 
conducted in Australia and those that emerged later in the U.S. were 
mentioned rarely, if at all, in FC training materials and newsletters. 
When that evidence was mentioned it was to criticize the evaluation 
methods and the people who employed them, and to explain away the 
results by saying essentially that FC could not be tested. In short, 
FC's validity was to be accepted largely on faith. With this, science 
was abandoned.       
<p>Concurrently Biklen, Crossley,  and their colleagues published 
further reports of qualitative studies suggesting that FC was highly 
effective in eliciting unexpected literacy skills from large proportions 
of individuals with severe autism, mental retardation, and other 
disorders. Many of these individuals had received little instruction in 
reading and spelling, or if instruction had been attempted many had not 
appeared to learn very much. How, then, had they developed age-level or 
even precocious literacy skills? According to Biklen they acquired these 
skills from watching television, seeing their siblings do homework, and 
simply being exposed to words pervading the environment. Or perhaps some 
had actually been learning from instruction all along, but because their 
speech was limited they could not demonstrate what they learned.</p>
<p>How did they verify their claims? Biklen and his colleagues used 
participant observation and other methods employed by anthropologists, 
sociologists, and educators in field studies of cultures and social 
systems. The research was strictly descriptive, not experimental, and 
employed no objective measurement or procedures to minimize observer 
bias. Despite their acknowledgement of the real possibility of 
facilitator influence in FC, these studies did not control that critical 
variable.</p>
<p>Late in 1991 a few parents of students at the New England Center for 
Autism, where I serve as Director of Research, began pressing our 
program to adopt FC. They asked us to make rather drastic changes in 
their childrens' lives on the assumption that messages produced with FC 
represented the childrens' true wishes and competencies. Some were angry 
when we decided instead to use it only under conditions of a small-scale 
experimental study employing the kind of objective evaluation methods 
that we try to apply to all techniques. At that time we could find 
nothing about FC in the research literature, so we consulted respected 
colleagues around the country. Some (in California, surprisingly enough) 
had not heard of it yet. Others invoked a Ouija board analogy or Clever 
Hans effect, and suggested that FC would be a short-lived fad. None knew 
of any objective evidence about FC. To our chagrin, we also encountered 
individuals with scientific training who were promoting the use of FC 
without considering the fundamental question about authorship.</p>

<a name="abuse">
<h2>The Sexual Abuse Component</h2>
</a>

The real possibility that "facilitated" words were those of the 
facilitators was not a cause for much concern as long as the process 
seemed benevolent. Few wished to throw a wet blanket on the euphoria 
created by reports of a breakthrough. But almost from the beginning, 
strange things began to happen: Some FC messages said--or were 
interpreted by facilitators to say--that disabled FC users had been 
abused by family members or caregivers. Often the abuse alleged was 
sexual, and many allegations contained extensive, explicit, pornographic 
details. 
<p>So many social movements have a sexual component in them, and FC is 
not different. Production of sex abuse allegations usually set in motion 
an inexorable chain of events. Beliefs about FC, the complexities 
inherent in the method, and the fact that the alleged victim may be seen 
as particularly vulnerable because he or she is disabled, now began to 
interact with the zealous pursuit that seems to typify investigations of 
sex abuse allegations. School or program administrators were notified, 
who in turn called in representatives of social services and law 
enforcement agencies. If the accused was a family member with whom the 
FC user resided, that person was either required to leave the home or 
the FC user was placed in foster care. If a parent was accused, both 
parents often faced criminal charges, one for perpetrating the alleged 
abuse, the other for knowing about it and failing to act. Often actions 
were initiated by social service workers to terminate parental custody 
or guardianship. If the accused was a school or program employee, they 
may have been suspended from their job or even fired. A long and trying 
ordeal was virtually guaranteed for all involved. An investigation 
began. Police interrogated the accused, and questioned the alleged 
victim through their facilitator. Other evidence was sought in the 
results of medical and psychological examinations of the alleged victim, 
and interviews with others who may have had information about the 
alleged events. A presumably independent facilitator was sometimes 
called in to try to corroborate the allegation, introducing another 
complexity: There appear to be no established safeguards or objective 
criteria  for ensuring that independent facilitators in fact have no 
access to information about cases, nor for deciding what constitutes 
corroborating "facilitated" content.</p>
<p>False allegations have devastating emotional and financial effects on 
the accused and their families, but leaving individuals in situations in 
which they may be abused jeopardizes their physical and emotional 
welfare. It would seem that extreme caution and stringent rules of 
evidence should apply. A number of cases have arisen in which the only 
evidence was a "facilitated" allegation, although there have also been 
reports of cases in which corroborating evidence or confessions were 
obtained. When an allegation is made through FC, two separate but 
related questions must be addressed: Who made the allegation, and did 
the alleged events actually occur? Some courts and investigative bodies 
in Australia, the U.S., and Canada have decided that the first question 
must be answered by controlled testing of FC under conditions where 
independent observers can verify when the facilitator does and does not 
have information necessary to produce communications. If the FC user 
does not convey information accurately and reliably under those 
conditions, and there is no other solid evidence, the legal action is 
usually terminated. That has been the outcome of testing in every case 
of which I am aware, but by the time that determination has been made 
the accused have been traumatized for the better part of a year and have 
spent tens of thousands of dollars defending themselves. Solid 
corroborating evidence would certainly answer the second question--whether
abuse occurred--but it does not follow logically that it answers 
the question about who authored the "facilitated" allegation.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it wasn't until a number of false "facilitated" 
allegations of sexual abuse came to light that FC began to be 
scrutinized closely. As issues about the validity and reliability of FC 
were addressed in courtrooms all over the U.S., critical and questioning 
stories appeared in the print and electronic media. Concurrently (though 
somewhat slowly), results from a rapidly growing number of controlled 
evaluations began to be disseminated, and a few more skeptical voices 
were raised.</p>

<a name="test">
<h2>How To Test FC</h2>
</a>

The rationale for conducting controlled observations to determine 
authorship in FC is straightforward: If the disabled FC user is actually 
the source of the messages, then accurate and appropriate messages 
should be produced on virtually every opportunity when the facilitator 
has no knowledge of the expected message. Some controlled evaluations of 
FC have been mandated by legal questions like those just described, but 
a number were carried out by clinicians, researchers, and program 
administrators who simply wanted an objective empirical basis for making 
decisions about FC. Even James "The Amazing" Randi was consulted in the 
early stages of testing, some calling him in to make sure fraud and 
trickery was not involved, others because they genuinely wondered if 
psychic power was the cause. Randi's skepticism of the phenomenon was 
not welcomed by FC supporters. The first major American study was 
conducted by psychologist Douglas Wheeler and colleagues at the O. D. 
Heck Developmental Center in Schenectady, NY, who wanted objective 
evidence to convince skeptics that FC was valid.
<p>How do you do a controlled study of FC? Recently I analyzed reports 
of 17 evaluations of FC that have appeared or have been accepted for 
publication in peer-reviewed professional journals, and eight presented 
at scientific conferences. The common and critical ingredients were:</p>
<ol>
<li>Consent for participation.</li>
<li>Objective measures, i.e., use of independent, nonparticipating 
observers or judges, "blind" to the conditions in effect, who recorded 
data and/or evaluated the accuracy of FC output.</li>
<li>Maintenance of physical and emotional support by the facilitator.</li>
<li>With only a few exceptions, facilitator/FC user dyads who had been 
working together with apparent success for a considerable period before 
formal evaluations were conducted.</li>
<li>Familiar, common communication contexts (e.g., typical academic 
and language-development activities, discussing everyday events, naming 
or describing familiar pictures or objects).</li>
<li>Establishment of apparently successful FC in the evaluation 
context.</li>
<li>Control of information available to the facilitator.</li>
</ol>
The necessary control was established in a number of ways. In some 
studies, facilitators were simply asked to look at their partner and not 
the letter display, or were actually screened from the letter display. 
These kinds of tests were suggested by the observation that many 
facilitators focus intently on the letters while their partners look at 
the letters infrequently, if at all. Others presented visual stimuli 
like pictures, objects, or printed materials only to the FC user while 
the facilitator was screened from seeing them. Alternatively, spoken 
questions were presented only to the FC user while their facilitator 
wore earplugs or headphones playing masking noise. Several evaluations 
used a procedure described as "message passing:" FC users were engaged 
in some familiar activities in the absence of facilitators, who then 
used FC to solicit descriptions of the activities. A couple of 
evaluations involved independent facilitators, unfamiliar with the FC 
user, who solicited information that was presumably unknown to the 
facilitator (e.g., the FC user's favorite food, a recent event in their 
life, names of family members, etc.).

<a name="results">
<h2>The Results</h2>
</a>

The most telling evaluations used double-blind procedures, in which 
facilitators and their partners saw or heard different items on some 
trials, and the same item on other trials. Neither could tell what 
information their partner was receiving. Responses that corresponded to 
information presented to the facilitator and not to their partner 
provided direct evidence that facilitators were controlling those FC 
productions. Multiple tasks and control procedures were used by several 
investigators. Facilitators in all evaluations had been trained by 
leading proponents of FC, or by others who had had such training. They 
seemed representative of the general population of facilitators, 
including parents, paraprofessionals, teachers, speech pathologists, and 
other human service workers. The sample of FC users in these evaluations 
also appeared representative, comprising a total of 194 children and 
adults with autism, mental retardation, cerebral palsy, and related 
disorders. 
<p>None of these controlled evaluations produced compelling evidence 
that FC enabled individuals with disabilities to demonstrate unexpected 
literacy and communication skills, free of the facilitator's influence. 
Many messages were produced over numerous trials and sessions, but the 
vast majority were accurate and appropriate to context only when the 
facilitator knew what was to be produced. The strong inference is that 
facilitators authored most messages, although most reported that they 
were unaware of doing so. Sixteen evaluations  found no evidence 
whatsoever of valid productions. A total of 23 individuals with various 
disabilities in nine different evaluations made accurate responses on 
some occasions when their facilitators did not know the answers, but 
most of those productions were commensurate with or less advanced than 
the individuals' documented skills without FC. That is, they were 
primarily single words and an occasional short phrase, produced on some 
trials by individuals whose vocal or signed communication exceeded that 
level, some of whom had documented reading skills before they were 
introduced to FC. For most of these individuals, there was clear 
evidence that on many other trials their facilitators controlled the 
productions. The controlled evaluations also demonstrated that most 
facilitators simply could not tell when and how much they were cueing 
their partners, emphasizing the importance of systematic, controlled 
observations for identifying the source of "facilitated" messages. The 
legal, ethical, and practical implications of these findings are obvious 
and serious. Together with the legal cases and critical media reports, 
they have made it a little more acceptable to voice skepticism about FC.</p>

<a name="respond"> 
<h2>The Proponents Respond: Parallels With Psychics</h2>
</a>

Proponents of FC have criticized the controlled evaluations on several 
counts. The parallels of their responses to those received by James 
Randi when he tests psychics are startling. FC supporters, for example, 
argue that incorrect answers were due to lack of confidence, anxiety, or 
resistance on the part of FC users,  who "freeze up" or become offended 
when challenged to prove their competence. Likewise, psychics claim they 
cannot perform in front of video cameras or in the presence of skeptics 
who make them anxious. In the case of FC, if this were true--if testing 
per se destroyed the FC process--participants in the controlled 
evaluations would not have responded at all, or would have produced 
inaccurate responses throughout, not just when their facilitators did 
not know the answers. Instead, many accurate words, descriptions, and 
other responses were produced, but for the most part only when 
facilitators knew what they were supposed to be. 
<p>Additionally, many evaluations took place in familiar surroundings in 
which individuals had engaged in FC for numerous sessions, with their 
regular facilitators and letter displays. Sessions typically were not 
conducted or were terminated if there were any signs of distress or 
unwillingness to continue. Few refusals were reported. Participants in 
most evaluations completed numerous trials and sessions over extended 
periods of time. Most appeared cooperative, even enthusiastic, 
throughout. Several evaluations were conducted in the context of typical 
FC sessions, using the same types of materials and questions to which 
participants had appeared to respond successfully. Questions were no 
more confrontational or intrusive (perhaps less so) than those often 
asked in regular FC sessions; in fact, many tasks were identical to 
those recommended for FC training, except that conditions were arranged 
so that facilitators could not know all the expected responses. Finally, 
if FC users simply become too anxious to communicate when challenged, 
one has to wonder how they are managing to perform in regular academic 
classrooms, on I.Q. and other tests, in front of TV cameras, and before 
large audiences at FC meetings. And how can they give "facilitated" 
testimony, under questioning by judges and attorneys (which is anxiety 
producing for anyone), as prosecutors in some sexual abuse allegation 
cases are now arguing is their right?</p>
<p>Another criticism of the controlled evaluations is that the 
facilitators were not familiar with their partners, were inadequately 
trained, or did not provide appropriate "facilitation." That is simply 
not true. As indicated in the summary above, the FC users' preferred 
facilitators participated with them in most evaluations. The only 
exceptions were two studies that assessed initial responsiveness to FC 
with facilitators and FC users who were "beginners" when the evaluation 
started, and a couple of legal cases in which unfamiliar facilitators 
were involved (who nonetheless "facilitated" successfully with the FC 
users before controlled testing began). Many facilitators were trained 
by leading proponents of FC. Most were encouraged to provide whatever 
physical and emotional support they wished during the evaluation. If 
they were not "facilitating" properly, few understandable communications 
would have been produced. Quite the opposite was true. There is a 
peculiar irony in this criticism, however, since proponents offer no 
specific guidelines or standards as to what constitutes sufficient 
training and experience for facilitators. Some facilitators have started 
using the method after reading an article, watching a videotape, or 
attending a brief workshop. When we began to take a look at FC at the 
New England Center for Autism, for example, our three speech-language 
pathologists were trained by Biklen in a two-day workshop. That appeared 
to be the norm at that time (late 1991). A further contradiction is that 
there are reports throughout the descriptive literature on FC that 
facilitators who were complete strangers had some individuals with 
severe disabilities "facilitating" sentences (more, in some cases) in 
their very first session.</p>

<a name="implaus">
<h2>Implausibilities and Inconsistencies</h2>
</a>

An oft-cited criticism of the controlled evaluations is that they 
required FC users to perform confrontational naming tasks, which 
proponents consider inappropriate because individuals with autism have 
global "word-finding" problems. This argument is implausible for several 
reasons. First, many evaluations did not require FC users to spell 
specific names; descriptions, copying, multiple-choice options, yes/no 
responses, and answers to open-ended questions were just some of the 
other kinds of responses solicited. Second, there is no solid evidence 
that such problems are exhibited by individuals with autism. It can be 
difficult to distinguish words that an individual presumably knows but 
cannot produce from words that they simply do not know, even with 
individuals who at one time had well-developed language (e.g., 
neurologic patients). This would seem to be even more difficult with 
individuals with autism. Even if this rationalization applied to 
individuals with autism, what accounts for the results with the many FC 
users who did not have autism? Additionally, at least three studies 
documented spontaneous oral naming responses by FC users with autism 
that were more accurate than their "facilitated" responses. That 
certainly goes against the "word-finding" hypothesis for those 
individuals. 
<p>Some FC proponents attribute negative findings to the supposition 
that most FC users are not experienced with the kinds of tasks presented 
to them in the controlled tests. This criticism is especially puzzling. 
By law, the skills of individuals with special needs must be evaluated 
on a regular basis, so most FC users have probably had a great deal of 
test experience. The tasks used in most controlled evaluations were like 
those used to teach and test academic and language skills in classrooms 
and training programs everywhere. In fact, many were precisely the kinds 
of activities that are recommended for FC training, on which the FC 
users in the controlled evaluations had been reported to perform very 
well. Again, if inexperience with the tasks were a plausible 
explanation, FC users should perform equally poorly when their 
facilitators did and did not know the expected answers. That was not the 
case in the controlled evaluations.</p>
<p>Finally, FC proponents are inconsistent in claiming that controlled 
testing undermines the FC user's confidence, while in the next breath 
they are quick to tout reports that some attempts at controlled 
evaluations have produced evidence of FC's validity. In other words, 
when the data contradict their claims, experiments are not valid; when 
the data support their claims, experiments are useful. A report from 
Australia (referred to as the IDRP report) said that three individuals 
with disabilities succeeded in "facilitating" the name of a gift they 
were given in the absence of their facilitators, but one was said to 
type his responses independently, without FC. The report provided no 
background information about the individuals, no details about the 
procedures, and described only one controlled trial completed by each 
individual. Another exercise described in a letter to the editor of a 
speech disorders journal claimed that four of five students thought to 
have severe language delays performed remarkably better with FC than 
without on a test of matching pictures to spoken words. The facilitator 
wore headphones but was not screened visually from the nearby examiner 
who was speaking the words, and no expressive communication was required 
of the FC users. At best, these exercises must be considered 
inconclusive, but they have been cited widely by proponents as 
scientific validations of FC. The contradiction inherent in arguing that 
controlled testing interferes with FC while endorsing exercises like 
these seems lost on them. The clear implication is that tests that 
appear to produce evidence supporting beliefs about FC are good, and 
tests that fail to do so are bad.</p>

<a name="silent">
<h2>Silent Skeptics</h2>
</a>

If FC is so obviously not the mental miracle supporters claim it is, why 
does the movement continue to grow? Why hasn't the scientific community 
made a significant public statement against FC? A number of variables 
probably account for the initial and continuing reluctance of many 
skeptics to speak up. First, scientists in general are cautious about 
drawing conclusions without data. When FC first hit the disability 
community in North America, there were no objective data to be had. A 
rejoinder to Biklen's first report by Australian psychologists Robert 
Cummins and Margot Prior was submitted to the <em>Harvard Educational 
Review</em> early in 1991. Their paper summarized the results of controlled 
tests of the validity of FC and the legal and ethical problems it had 
engendered in Australia. It was not published until late summer 1992, 
and by that time the FC movement already had considerable momentum. Even 
then, many skeptics withheld judgment on the basis that the Australian 
data were limited. This was essentially our reasoning at the New England 
Center for Autism--that some individuals with autism might write or type 
better than they could speak (we knew a few), and that if there were 
some merit to the claims about FC, it would be revealed through careful 
research using objective methodology. 
<p>At the same time, however, we sensed something ominous in the 
rapidity and zeal with which FC was being applied, the resistance to 
critical scrutiny, and the antiscience stance of many adherents. Even as 
the dark side of the FC story began to unfold, relatively few in 
developmental disabilities who knew how to test the claims about FC 
experimentally wanted to get involved, perhaps thinking that the best 
response was to continue to do sound research in their own areas. Others 
did not to want to be seen as naysayers or debunkers.</p>
<p>Cummins and Prior, both with long histories of involvement in 
treatment and research in developmental disabilities, were among the 
first in Victoria to go public with their concerns about FC. Their 
expressions of skepticism and calls for caution were met with hostility 
and personal attacks from FC proponents in Australia, a scenario that 
has repeated itself in the U.S. That suggests another variable, in my 
opinion one of the most potent: It was (is) not Politically Correct in 
many circles to suggest that FC might not be all it appears, or even to 
call for objective evaluation to determine if it is. Those who do are 
likely to be labelled heretics, oppressors of the disabled, inhumane, 
negative, jealous of others' discoveries, "dinosaurs" who cannot accept 
new ideas, and out for financial gain.</p>

<a name="future">
<h2>The FC Future</h2>
</a>

Needless to say, considerable attention and acclaim have accrued to the 
leaders of the FC movement, but as the data and the harms have mounted, 
so has the criticism. Recent months have seen a marked shift in media 
coverage from the glowing reports of miracles that made almost no 
mention of objective evidence (e.g., <em>PrimeTime Live</em>) to stories about 
families for whom FC has been anything but a miracle. A documentary on 
the PBS investigative news program, <em>Frontline</em>,  honed in on the 
implausibility and lack of empirical support for Biklen's initial 
claims, along with the emerging evidence from experimental evaluations 
showing overwhelmingly that most FC is <em>facilitator</em> communication. 
<p>The public position of Syracuse University officials appears to be 
that Professor Biklen's notions are simply provoking the furor and 
resistance that all radical new ideas encounter. Perhaps that is the 
case; time and objective data will tell. Time will most certainly be 
required for the legal system to do its part in determining the future 
of the FC movement. A number of cases involving "facilitated" sexual 
abuse allegations are in process at this writing. To my knowledge, there 
has been one conviction so far. Several individuals and families who 
have been cleared of false allegations have filed damage countersuits 
against the facilitators, school and program administrators, and social 
service agencies involved. On January 10, 1994 a civil suit was filed in 
federal District Court for the northern district of New York seeking $10 
million in damages on behalf of a family who were among the first 
victims of FC allegations in the U.S. Among the ten defendants are 
Douglas Biklen and Syracuse University.</p>
<p>Finally, if FC is not a mental miracle, is it sleight of hand? By 
this I do not mean there is intentional deceit on the part of the 
facilitators. Far from it. Most are genuine, honest, caring individuals 
who wish the best for their charges. Herein lies an explanation. The 
power of a belief system to direct thought and action is overwhelming. A 
full and complete explanation for the FC phenomenon is still 
forthcoming, but clearly there are parallels with the ideomotor 
responses that direct dowsing sticks and the Ouija board. As the 
facilitator gently directs the hand to begin typing, letters are formed 
into words and words into sentences. Just as with the Ouija board where 
elaborate thoughts seem to be generated out of thin air while both 
parties consciously try not to move the piece across the board, the 
facilitators do not appear to be conscious that it is them generating 
the communication. Even with the autistic child looking elsewhere, or 
not looking at all (eyes closed), the hand is still rapidly pecking out 
letters as if it were a miracle. Unfortunately there are no miracles in 
mental health. All of us wish FC were true, but the facts simply do not 
allow scientists and critical thinkers to replace knowledge with wish.</p>

According to a letter from Carl Wieland, Managing Director of Australia's

does not possess a degree in paleoanthropology from Clifford Wilson's
Pacific College in Australia.
<p>Baugh has claimed a "Masters Degree in Archaeology from Pacific College"
and a "Doctor of Philosophy Degree in Anthropology from [the] College of
Advanced Education."  The latter institution
is a small house in Irving, Texas, which shares the address of the
Sherwood Baptist Church.  The pastor of the church and the dean of
the college are the same person: Rev. Don Davis.  Davis says that Baugh's
degree "through" CAE was granted "under the auspices of Clifford Wilson
in Australia."</p>

Exposes Actions to Discredit Noah's Show       Humanists Hoaxed TV Interview

NOAH'S ARK TV SHOW FIELD PRODUCER EXPOSES HUMANIST EFFORTS TO 
GET BIBLICAL THEMED SHOWS OFF NETWORK TELEVISION

   After a six-week investigation that ended in August 1993 into the
people behind an article in _TIME_ magazine which asserted that one of
50 expert interviewees used in the TV show _The Incredible Discovery of
Noah's Ark_, fabricated his eyewitness account of seeing Noah's Ark, and
that the show made claims not supported by modern science, the show's
field producer David W. Balsiger announced that the article was an
effort by humanists to advance their anti-biblical agenda.

   Nationally known humanist Dr. Gerald Larue, who pontificates from behind
his title as Professor Emeritus of Biblical History and Archaeology at the
University of Southern California, claimed in _TIME_ (July 5, 1993) and a
copycat Associated Press wire story that he unconscionably planned and
coached interviewee George Jammal to execute a hoaxed interview on network
television.  The hoaxed interview appeared within the _Noah's Ark_ show
that aired as a CBS-Television Network Special in February 1993.

   "The hoax was all part of a fully orchestrated effort in the news media
by atheists and secular humanists with their advocacy organizations to
discredit the entire _Noah's Ark_ TV Special, the CBS-Television Network
for running biblical-themed shows, and my reputation as a TV researcher
and field producer-director of family and biblical themed shows," says
Balsiger, who worked on the show for Sun International Pictures.
</pre>

[Balsiger omits to mention that his reputation is that of an unreliable
researcher, and that this has been observed not only by skeptics and
humanists, but by evangelical Christians who have examined his work.
(See, for example, the numerous references to Balsiger in Mike Hertenstein
and Jon Trott's <em>Selling Satan: The Tragic History of Mike Warnke</em>
(1993, Cornerstone Press), a book which exposes the bogus claims made
in Mike Warnke's book <em>The Satan Seller</em>, which Balsiger co-authored
and claims to have ghost written.  (I suspect Balsiger was the primary
author on the book, but the book itself claims to have been written by
Mike Warnke "with Dave Balsiger and Les Jones."  Balsiger lists numerous
books in his <em>Who's Who in America</em> entry with no mention of any
co-authors, despite the fact that many of the books themselves state on
their covers that he is second author or editor.))
<p>Balsiger also overlooks the fact that the Jammal hoax was blatantly
obvious, and that he had been warned by at least two Ark researchers
(Bill Crouse and David Fasold) that Jammal's story had no credibility
well in advance of the show's completion. -jjl]</p>

<pre>
   "There is something wrong with the ethics of the news media when they
glorify the acts of humanist hoaxers who intentionally and successfully
deceive 40 million TV viewers, and then blame the show's production
company and CBS for not discovering their elaborate hoax," says Balsiger.
"This is not a case in which the producer or the network is guilty of
deceiving viewers, but rather one more example of humanists who tout
themselves as 'Ethical Humanists' being neither ethical nor honest when
it comes to advancing their hidden agenda."
</pre>

[This quotation, with only minor modifications, is a perfect description
of Balsiger's own actions.  The shows that Balsiger has been involved
with contain misrepresentations, intentionally omit contrary evidence,
and engage in fanciful speculation.  Despite repeated criticisms,
Balsiger, Sun International Pictures, and CBS have continued to air
the same unfounded claims.  Sun's 1976 film, "In Search of Noah's Ark,"
was the source of at least 20% of the most recent Ark show, but no
recognition was made by Sun of the numerous published criticisms of
that material.  -jjl]

<pre>
   Balsiger has determined that the entire media discrediting campaign
was orchestrated by Dr. Larue and his well-known humanist associate,
Dr. Paul Kurtz, the president, chairman, or editor of several humanist
organizations and publications.  "These people are clearly opposed
to anything that's biblical," says Balsiger.
</pre>

[The hoax began as a practical joke by Jammal (acting on his own) in late
1985.  Larue got involved when Sun contacted Jammal about being in their
show.  Kurtz's only involvement, so far as I know, was to help distribute
Larue's March 1993 press release about Jammal's hoax, which was completely
ignored by the media.  Only <em>Free Inquiry</em>, edited by Kurtz, published it.
The <em>Time</em> article in July came about because Michael Shermer of the
Skeptics Society mentioned the hoax to James Randi, who in turn mentioned
it to <em>Time</em>'s Leon Jaroff, who was present at Randi's libel trial
(the Eldon Byrd lawsuit, which ended with Byrd being awarded nothing).
-jjl]

<pre>
   Through the influence of Larue, Kurtz, and various overlapping members
of directors and advisory boards, several humanist organizations and
their publications played a role in the discrediting media blitz against
the _Noah's Ark_ TV Show.  These included the Los Angeles Skeptics Society,
the Council for Democratic and Secular Humanism (CODESH), the Committee
for the Scientific Examination of Religion, the Committee for the Scientific
Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal (CSICOP), the American Humanist
Association, the National Center for Science Education, and their various
house publications including _Skeptic_, _Free Inquiry_, _The Skeptical
Inquirer_, _The Humanist_, and the _NCSE Report_.
</pre>

[The Skeptics Society, which publishes <em>Skeptic</em>, had not published
an article about Jammal's hoax at the time of Balsiger's press release.
It had, however, published Sun International Pictures' press release
and a summary of John Morris' defense of Sun's program in the Institute 
for Creation Research's <em>Acts & Facts</em> (September 1993).
<p>CSER is a subcommittee of CODESH, so there's really only one organization
involved there, which publishes <em>Free Inquiry</em>.  It has indeed published
several criticisms of the Ark show, including a very good critique of the
show in general (quite apart from the Jammal hoax) by Richard Fox (Summer
1993)--which Balsiger never mentions or responds to in any way.  CSICOP
publishes the <em>Skeptical Inquirer</em> and is connected in some ways to
CODESH.
It had published nothing on the Ark hoax until its Winter 1994 issue, which
came out at about the same time as Balsiger's press release.  CSICOP's
<em>Skeptical Briefs</em> published some letters regarding Sun's program, but
nothing about the Jammal hoax to date except a letter from Balsiger in
its December 1993 issue (an open letter from which many of Balsiger's
self-quotations in this press release were taken.  AHA publishes <em>The
Humanist</em>, which has published nothing about the Ark hoax.
The NCSE publishes <em>NCSE Reports</em>, and its coverage has
been more or less independent of the others (there are no connections
between the NCSE and the other organizations listed here, except perhaps
common members, and the fact that the NCSE purchased the journal
<em>Creation/Evolution</em> from the AHA a few years ago).  There is no
orchestrated conspiracy here.  Balsiger also omits to mention the negative
coverage of his Ark show which appeared in <em>Ararat Report</em> (May 1993),
<em>Reasons to Believe</em> (Spring 1993), <em>Does God Exist?</em>
(September/October 1993 and May/June 1994), <em>Christian News</em> (several
1993 issues), and other Christian publications. -jjl]</p>

<pre>
   Although Jammal has stated verbally and in writing that he was telling
the truth regarding his Noah's Ark eyewitness account, Sun researchers
concluded during their August investigation that he would eventually
confess to committing a hoax in conjunction with Dr. Larue and their
humanist advocacy groups.  "Jammal waited until the humanists could
maximize the publicity from his public confession, and extract any
financial gains that people might pay for his flip-flop story," explained
Balsiger.  The confession came in late October and resulted in CBS
canceling all of Sun's biblical and secular shows in production.
</pre>

[Jammal was probably paid for his appearance on "Inside Edition"--but
then, Balsiger was also probably paid for his appearance on the same
show.  Otherwise, I don't believe Jammal has received any financial
rewards from his hoax. -jjl]</p>

<pre>
   "In addition to their humanist agenda of getting biblical shows off
network television, it seems that Dr. Larue was probably also conducting
some type of a vindictive campaign against Sun International Pictures,"
says Balsiger.  "This may be the result of his appearance as a skeptic
in Sun's show 'Ancient Secrets of the Bible I' which aired on May 15,
1992.  According to _TIME_ magazine, Dr. Larue felt he was 'set up as
a straw man.'"
</pre>

[Larue *was* set up as a straw man.  See Larue's <em>Free Inquiry</em> article
(Fall 1993), in which he gives the details.  Also see articles by Tom
Malone and Farrell Till in <em>Freethought Today</em> (April 1993 and September
1993, respectively), which document Sun's practice of giving skeptics
prewritten straw man scripts in many cases, and when skeptics
write their own scripts, the most significant content is edited out of
what finally airs. -jjl]

<pre>
   "In our show, he was a critic of the Walls of Jericho falling down,"
explains Balsiger.  "As these TV Specials were critic-proponent shows,
he was followed by two proponents of the biblical story--Dr. Amos Nur,
chairman of the Geophysics Department at Stanford University, and Dr.
Bryant Wood, a Syro-Palestinian archaeologist who has written extensively
on Jericho for the professional peer journal _Biblical Archaeology
Review_.  They refuted Larue's argument based on their own extensive
scientific studies."
</pre>

[Larue responds to this in the Fall 1993 <em>Free Inquiry</em>. -jjl]

<pre>
   Since 1982, Dr. Larue has served as chairman of the Committee for the
Scientific Examination of Religion, a committee of the national Council
for Democratic and Secular Humanism (CODESH) dedicated to refuting Bible
claims; was the consulting editor (1987-1989) and Emeritus President of
the National Hemlock Society, America's foremost euthanasia advocacy
organization well known for its book on how to commit suicide; and is the
senior editor of _Free Inquiry_, the humanist magazine published by
CODESH--both entities dedicated to removing religious beliefs from
society and Bible-oriented programs from public broadcast.
</pre>

[All true.  And Balsiger's point?  Sure, Larue has a bias.  But the
facts are pretty clear regarding the shoddiness of Balsiger's productions.
Balsiger, by the way, himself has been the founder, leader, or organizer
of a number of fringe Christian organizations, and his biases are quite
clear in his work.  Despite this, Sun's press releases regarding the Ark
hoax claimed that its shows do not present a particular viewpoint.  -jjl]

<pre>
   "It is also more than coincidental that _TIME_ magazine writer Leon
Jaroff was the author of this Noah's Ark news hit piece.  Mr. Jaroff,
science editor for _TIME_ magazine, is prominently listed as a 'Fellow
of the Committee' of CSICOP, which is a sub-organization of CODESH,"
explains Balsiger.  "He and Dr. Larue are associated together on
CSICOP's magazine _The Skeptical Inquirer_.  Dr. Larue serves as the
technical advisor to the magazine while Mr. Jaroff is listed on the
magazine's masthead page.
</pre>

[CSICOP is not "a sub-organization of CODESH."  CSICOP predates CODESH,
and is a more-or-less independent organization (sometimes less independent
than many skeptics would like, I'm afraid--CSICOP and CODESH do share a
building and are both run by Paul Kurtz).  Larue is not "the" technical
advisor to <em>SI</em>, he is one of numerous technical advisors to CSICOP.
Jaroff isn't on the magazine's masthead, he is listed as a CSICOP Fellow.
Neither has anything to do with <em>SI</em> itself. -jjl]

<pre>
   "Humanist Jaroff, a listed official of CSICOP which is totally
controlled by its parent organization CODESH--both well-known humanism
advocacy organizations--was exercising bias [sic] reporting, pushing his
own personal humanist views, and promoting the goals of CSICOP-CODESH
in the _TIME_ article on Noah's Ark," claims Balsiger.
</pre>

[This is totally false.  CSICOP is NOT a humanist organization, and Jaroff
has no connection with CODESH.  CSICOP's Executive Council, Fellows,
Advisors, and subscribers are probably mostly *not* humanists.  I don't
know whether Jaroff is a humanist or not, but I have no evidence that he is.
-jjl]

<pre>
   Sun's "Letter to the Editor" of _TIME_, stating the facts surrounding
the alleged hoax and exposing Jaroff's article errors and bias did not
get printed.  "It seems _TIME_ can dish out the inflammatory accusations,
but cannot take the heat when asked to print a simple 'Letter to the
Editor' exposing their bias [sic] reporting," says Balsiger.  "Instead,
they may have executed a coverup for Jaroff and his embarrassing
criticism of our scientific information sources which substantially
came from _Feats and Wisdom of the Ancients_, Library of Curious and
Unusual Facts, published by _TIME-Life_ Books."
</pre>

[Balsiger has a point here.  <em>Time</em> should have published Sun's response.
Both <em>Skeptic</em> and <em>Free Inquiry</em> *did* publish Sun's response, and
then demonstrated how weak it was.  <em>Skeptical Briefs</em> published
Balsiger's previous letter to the media.  Any suppression of views cannot be
placed at the feet of the skeptics and humanists.  Sun International Pictures,
on the other hand, is at least as guilty as <em>Time</em> magazine
in suppressing the views of critics. -jjl]

<pre>
   "The vicious and vindictive attacks against the Noah's Ark show,
CBS-TV, Sun, and myself by _Los Angeles Time_ [sic] entertainment
critic-columnist Howard Rosenberg also was not a coincidence," says
Balsiger.  "It turns out Mr. Rosenberg and Dr. Larue are long-time
friends and apparently work together hand and glove to achieve the
humanist agenda.  In this case, it not only ended biblical-themed shows
on network TV, but the cancellation of all Sun's shows being produced for
CBS, and the termination of numerous production employees."
</pre>

[I have no evidence that Rosenberg is a humanist, but his articles
about Sun were right on target.  There is no question that CBS did the
right thing by cancelling Sun's shows, though I'm not sure they did so
for the right reasons.  -jjl]

<pre>
   Balsiger has asked corporate officials at both _TIME_ magazine and
the _Los Angeles Times_ to fire Jaroff and Rosenberg for bias [sic]
reporting, pushing their own humanist views, and not disclosing their
affiliations with humanist advocacy groups and officials of such groups.
</pre>

[This is more projection by Balsiger, who isn't forthright about his
own affiliations, and one of the serious criticisms raised against the
Ark show is that many of its "experts" were young-earth creationists whose
affiliations were not disclosed (and in some cases, whose credentials
were misrepresented to make them seem more impressive). -jjl]

<pre>
   "Although the hoax was committed by Mr. Jammal, it's sad and
unfortunate that Dr. Larue, a distinguished USC professor, would
victimize Mr. Jammal and his family to execute a third-party hoax
in which he was the primary benefactor--the person who says he coached
Mr. Jammal into lying on network television, and then exposed him
claiming credit for exposing his own hoax," says Balsiger.
</pre>

[Balsiger doesn't explain how Larue has "victimize[d]" Jammal by
exposing Jammal's own hoax.  He also omits to mention his own legal
threats directed at Jammal, which were cited by CBS as a reason for
canceling their future Sun projects.  -jjl]

<pre>
   Balsiger says he also objects to the characterization by the news
media and Dan Rather that our entire Noah's Ark TV Special was a hoax.
Mr. Jammal was only one of 50 experts that provided authoritative
interviews on a wide range of subjects relating to the Noah's Ark
mystery.  Additionally, the TV Special told the Noah's Ark story as
recorded in the Bible along with the presentation of historical data,
scientific experiments, and Ararat explorer accounts.

   "Furthermore, Mr. Jammal was only one of four filmed eyewitnesses
who claimed to have had an on-the-ground encounter with the Ark,"
explains Balsiger.  "No one has come forward with claims or evidence
that any of these remaining eyewitness accounts are perpetrated hoaxes
on CBS.  We also stated in the show that it was up to the audience to
decide whether their accounts were believable or not!"

                          -30-
</pre>

[What Balsiger says here is simply untrue.  The May 1993 <em>Ararat Report</em>
contained substantial evidence that other alleged Ark eyewitnesses on the show
also are hoaxers.  Even more substantial evidence regarding these
people being hoaxers has been published in earlier issues of <em>Ararat
Report</em>, and all back issues were in Balsiger's possession prior to
the completion of the show's production.  Further, Balsiger was
specifically warned that the people he was using were not credible. -jjl]

<h1>UPDATE ON THE ARK HOAX</h1>
<h2><a href="02.4.about-lippard.html">By Jim Lippard</a></h2>

There have been a number of noteworthy comments on George Jammal's
Noah's Ark hoax since I wrote 
<a href="02.3.lippard-ark-hoax.html">my article on the subject for the last
issue of <em>Skeptic</em>.</a> Of these, two have come from individuals
criticized in my article. First, John Morris of the ICR published an
article in which he admitted that he had been hoaxed. Second, 
<a href="balsiger-release.html">
David Balsiger issued a press release in January, 1994,
</a> which he claimed to
have uncovered evidence that the hoax was part of a massive humanist
conspiracy to discredit Christianity in general and Sun International
Pictures in particular. Both of these commentaries are highly
misleading.  Morris's article, far from being the repentant apology
and retraction which was warranted, makes the following claims:
<ol>
<li>His initial response to the hoax charges pointed out "certain
inaccuracies" in the <em>Time</em> magazine article, in particular that
"LaRue [sic] could not have made up the story himself, as he claimed."
<em>Time</em> did err in reporting that Larue initiated the hoax, but this
does not appear to be something Larue has ever claimed. This is the
only error in the <em>Time</em> article Morris pointed out, so he is mistaken
to speak of "inaccuracies."
<li>"Many have subsequently charged me in print and on the
nationally syndicated TV show 'Inside Edition' with impropriety,
claiming that since I had placed Sun in touch with Jammal, I must take
full responsibility."  I have read numerous articles on the Ark hoax
and viewed the 'Inside Edition' show, but nowhere have I seen anyone
claim that Morris "must take full responsibility." Instead, I have
seen claims that he must bear some responsibility, and that is
certainly true. Nowhere in Morris's pseudo-retraction does he accept
any responsibility.
<li>Jammal's story "differed remarkably from those of all other
eyewitnesses, and I suspected he was mistaken." Morris doesn't say
what he thinks Jammal was mistaken about, and he omits to mention his
statement to Sun International Pictures that "It is my impression that
[Jammal] was on Mt. Ararat. He seems to know Lake Kop and described in
reasonable detail the area nearby." Morris made no public criticisms
of Jammal's story until after the hoax allegations surfaced, and even
then his first reaction was to defend Jammal.
<li>"It is only when Dr. LaRue [sic], a man who certainly knows
better, got involved, that the story escalated to the sensational, for
without the doctored wood, Jammal's story would probably not have been
used."  This is mistaken. Jammal had already prepared his wood
independently of advice from Larue. Morris also conveniently forgets
that it was Sun International Pictures that escalated the story to the
sensational.
<p>Morris concludes that "If nothing else, this event shows the depth
to which some people will stoop to try to discredit those who believe
in the Bible." In fact, it is Morris and Sun International Pictures
who have discredited themselves by demonstrating excessive
carelessness about the facts. It is amazing to me that Morris bends
over backwards to avoid accepting the slightest responsibility for the
success of the hoax, or even acknowledging that any criticisms of Sun
International Pictures might be deserved.</p>
</ol>
Former Sun International Pictures researcher David Balsiger's
press release also neglects to take any responsibility for the airing
of the hoax, and makes numerous claims including:
<ol>
<li>Jammal's hoax "was part of a fully orchestrated effort in the
news media by atheists and secular humanists with their advocacy
organizations to discredit the entire Noah's Ark TV Special, the
CBS-Television Network for running biblical-themed shows, and my
reputation as a TV researcher and field producer-director of family
and biblical-themed shows." As my article in <em>Skeptic</em> showed, the
only person involved in the original hoax was George Jammal. Gerald
Larue got involved when Sun International Pictures became interested
in Jammal, and no one else got involved until after the
pseudo-documentary was aired.
<li>"Balsiger has determined that the entire media discrediting
campaign was orchestrated by Dr. Larue and his well-known humanist
associate, Dr.  Paul Kurtz, the president, chairman, or editor of
several humanist organizations and publications." Paul Kurtz's only
involvement was to aid in the distribution of a press release
revealing the hoax and to publish several excellent and accurate
articles about the hoax.
<li>"No one has come forward with claims or evidence that any of
these remaining eyewitness accounts are perpetrated hoaxes on CBS."
Balsiger has made this claim numerous times, and it has been false
every time he has made it--and he knows this. The May 1993 <em>Ararat
Report</em> (as well as earlier issues of that publication) gave
substantial evidence that Ed Behling, Ed Davis, and Fernand Navarra
are not eyewitnesses of Noah's Ark. Balsiger was also personally
warned (and given the evidence) long before Sun's program aired by
Bill Crouse, the editor of <em>Ararat Report</em>, that these alleged
witnesses were unreliable.  There was no orchestrated media conspiracy
by skeptics and humanists, and Balsiger fails to mention the negative
coverage of his Ark show which appeared in Christian publications such
as <em>Ararat Report</em> (May 1993), <em>Facts & Faith</em> (Spring 1993), <em>Does
God Exist?</em> (September/October 1993), <em>Christian News</em> (several 1993
issues), and the <em>Bible-Science News</em> (31:5, 1993).
</ol>
   The failure of Balsiger and Morris to admit their errors, to 
accept any responsibility for the success of Jammal's hoax, or to even 
attempt to address the substantial criticisms which have been raised 
against Sun's Ark program demonstrates that they are unreliable sources 
of information on the subject of Noah's Ark. Creationists in particular 
and Christians in general would be wise to avoid reliance on either of 
them, and to publicly distance themselves from inaccurate claims of these 
men.

<a name="intro"></a>
<em>The exchange between Sir Thomas More, stalwart of due process in
Robert Bolt's play</em> A Man for All Seasons, <em>and the younger and
zealous Roper, epitomizes the argument advocates of open inquiry have
presented in many lands at many times (Act 1, Scene 6):
<p>Roper: So now you'd give the Devil benefit of law.</p>
<p>More: Yes. What would you do? Cut a great road through the law to
get after the Devil?</p>
<p>Roper: I'd cut down every law in England to do that.</p>
<p>More: Oh? And when the last law was down--and the Devil turned
round on you--where would you hide? Yes, I'd give the Devil benefit of
law, for my own safety's sake.</p></em>

<p>The revisionist assertion that the Holocaust (the Nazi persecution
of European Jewry culminating in the intentional mass genocide of five
to six million) is a snare and a delusion foisted upon the rest of
society by powerful Zionist Jews is generated by only a handful of
scholars and propagandists at a few fringe organizations. Despite
fears and claims to the contrary, it is taken seriously by only a
small percentage of the American population. (I use the term
"revisionist" rather than "denier" because that is the term these
individuals use; just as newspapers use "Pro-Choice" and "Pro-Life."
Likewise, I do not use the term "exterminationist," by which the
revisionists often designate their opponents.) According to the most
recent Gallup poll on the subject, when asked directly, "Do you doubt
that the Holocaust actually happened or not?" only 9% said yes and 4%
said they were unsure (Morin, 1994). The Gallup organization explained
the discrepancy between the low level of support for Holocaust
revisionism found in their poll and the much higher level (22%
doubters; 12% unsure) in the Roper poll commissioned by the American
Jewish Committee, as resulting from the different wording, especially
the use of a double negative in the Roper question.</p>
<p>Denying or even doubting the Holocaust has the same effect on Jews
(and others) as would burning an American flag in front of a VA
hospital filled with disabled war veterans. To many, it's yelling
"liar!" at a crowded gas chamber. And in countries other than the
U.S., it's a criminal offense for which violators can do hard time in
the slammer.</p>
<p>Should skeptics take the claims of Holocaust revisionists seriously
or simply write them off as yet another product of the lunatic fringe?
And, do the claims of the Holocaust revisionists have any historical
merit? So asked Michael Shermer in a recent issue of <em>Skeptic</em>, in the
process of identifying the concept of pseudohistory, the fraternal
twin of pseudoscience (Shermer, 1993). Shermer's essay in this issue
provides a detailed analysis of these questions. Tom McIver's article
specifically compares revisionism with creationism and argues that
they share underlying racist assumptions. What I shall examine is how
Holocaust revisionism provides a useful test case for the skeptical
ethic, our views on freedom of inquiry and expression, academic
freedom and responsibility, and the extent to which the "received
version" of history is enforced as an article of faith, to be
questioned only at the loss of one's reputation, job, or even personal
freedom.</p>

<a name="criminal">
<h2>The Criminalization of Revisionism</h2>
</a>

The Russian language emigre newspaper, <em>Russkaia Mysl'</em> ("La Pensee
Russe"), once described how in the former Soviet Union what began as a
criminal charge became just another part of the day to day operation
of government: "Censorship, which began as a judicial term, became an
administrative one."
<p>In the United States, the First Amendment protects the right of
every citizen to question the very existence of the Holocaust (or of
Pearl Harbor, the moon walk, the death of Elvis, or anything else for
that matter).  According to FBI Director Louis Freeh, "no matter how
despicable, it's protected by the 1st Amendment." (Shanker, 1993,
p.72).</p>
<p>That is not the case elsewhere in the world. In Canada, anti-hate
and pornography statutes and the law against spreading "false news"
have been used against Holocaust revisionists. In France it is illegal
to contest the existence of any of the crimes against humanity as
defined by the Nuremberg Military Tribunal. In Germany it is against
the law to "defame the memory of the dead." Similar laws are on the
books in Austria, Switzerland, Belgium, Italy, Sweden and Israel.</p>
<p>Mark Weber, editor of the <em>Journal of Historical Review</em> (the
official organ of revisionists) is presently compiling a detailed list
of anti-revisionist laws and criminal prosecutions. He, along with
Z&uuml;ndel, Irving, and Faurisson, supplied me with information on these
laws (as well as considerably more material despite being told in
advance that the resulting essay could be critical of their
positions). No one disputes the existence of these laws.  Indeed, the
most prominent critics of the claims of Holocaust revisionists,
Deborah Lipstadt, Pierre Vidal-Naquet, and Michael Shermer, have
<em>publicly stated they oppose laws that criminalize revisionism</em>.
(Lipstadt, 1993, p.17; Vidal-Naquet, 1992, pp. 71-71; Shermer, 1994,
p. 14).</p>
<p>This can be an especially difficult philosophy to live by, with the
most extreme proponents of Holocaust revisionism--those who have
not-so-hidden anti-Semitic agendas. A classic example is Francis
Parker Yockey's <em>Imperium: The Philosophy of History and Politics</em>,
written under the Irish-Viking-Russian nom-de-plume of Ulick Varange
and dedicated to Adolf Hitler. Yockey, who originally worked for the
War Crimes Tribunal, but then quit, was one of the earliest Holocaust
revisionists. <em>Imperium</em> was republished by Noontide Press, the
publishing arm of IHR. The 1992 IHR catalogue describes <em>Imperium</em> as,
"a sweeping historico-philosophical treatise in the Spenglerian mold
and a clarion call to arms in defense of Europe and the West." This
"prophetic masterwork brought its author a martyr's death" (p. 11).
According to Lipstadt (p.147), Yockey had a history of paranoid
behavior and committed suicide by taking a cyanide capsule while in
prison on a passport violation. Yockey claims Darwinian evolution
amounts to the "materialistic animalization of Culture-man." Species,
he tells us, do NOT evolve. They arise spontaneously and disappear
just as magically. Needless to say, "parasites" (that is, Jews,
Negroes, and Communists) come off even worse in his view than does
Darwin (McIver, 1988, Entry #1829a).</p>
<p>In Yockey's league is the self-described former Marxist (now
unclassifiable political extremist) Lyndon LaRouche, and his wife
Helga Zepp LaRouche. Her <em>Hitler Book</em> argues along the lines of
creation scientists that Darwinism is the origin of Hitlerism, both of
which the LaRouches despise (McIver entry #1841). In addition to
having revealed the Queen of England as the Godmother of the
International Drug Trade, LaRouche and his followers have resolved the
wave-particle duality, uncovered a 3,000-year old conspiracy against
humanity, discovered the critical error in the thinking of "capitalist
reformer" Karl Marx, rendered all previously existing economic systems
meaningless, and conceived the strategic defense initiative (LaRouche,
1979a, 1979b, 1980, 1983). Amidst all these claims, the LaRouches have
also dismissed the Holocaust as "mythical" and "a swindle" (King,
1989, p.138).</p>
<p>Conspiracy theories interpret history as governed by "demonic
forces of almost transcendent power." They have a long history in the
United States and are equally at home among both right- and
left-wingers (Hofstadter, 1965, p.  29). Among those fingered as the
evil ones: the Illuminati, the Knights of Malta, the Masons, the Jews,
the Crypto-Jews, the Cosmopolitans, the Abolitionists, Slaveholders,
the Catholics, the Communists, the Nazis, the neo-Nazis, the
Bilderbergers, the Council on Foreign Relations, the Trilateral
Commission, the Warren Commission, the World Wildlife Fund, the
International Monetary Fund, the New Agers, and the list goes on.</p>
<p>Not all Holocaust revisionists are conspiracy theorists. Mark
Weber, in fact, is redirecting the IHR away from both conspiratorial
thinking and overt anti-Semitic leanings, in an effort to lead the
movement into the mainstream of historical scholarship. In this
process they must also distance themselves from some of the more
extreme revisionists. The best known cases of prosecution of Holocaust
revisionists reveal a lot about both the social movement of
revisionism and the unwillingness of some countries to grant them the
freedom to revise certain histories.</p>

<a name="fire">
<h2>Ernst Z&uuml;ndel: Playing With Fire</h2>
</a>

A Canadian resident but German citizen, Ernst Z&uuml;ndel is the most
outspoken and visible advocate of Holocaust revisionism. He is,
interestingly (especially for skeptics) also the author of <em>UFO's:
Nazi Secret Weapons?</em>, which has sold out seven underground printings.
The book argued that what are usually described as flying saucers from
outer space are actually Nazi secret weapons, still being launched
from a hole in the ice in Antarctica. This may be why he jokingly told
me in an early phone conversation to realize that I was dealing with
the "real lunatic fringe." In a later phone conversation, Z&uuml;ndel told
me that the UFO book was in fact a ploy. "I realized that North
Americans were not interested in being educated. They want to be
entertained. The book was for fun. With a picture of the Fuhrer on the
cover and flying saucers coming out of Antarctica it was a chance to
get on radio and TV talk shows. For about 15 minutes of an hour
program I'd talk about that esoteric stuff. Then I would start talking
about all those Jewish scientists in concentration camps, working on
these secret weapons. And that was my chance to talk about what I
wanted to talk about."
<p>"In that case," I asked him, "do you still stand by what you wrote
in the UFO book?" I asked. "Look," he replied, "it has a question mark
at the end of the title."</p>
<p>While some Holocaust revisionists operate quietly and seek outlets
in academic or academic-like journals, Z&uuml;ndel unleashes an avalanche
of newsletters, audio cassettes, stickers, radio and TV broadcasts.
The sheer volume of his output would be the envy of any political
campaign manager or television evangelist. His tone, however, in
person, phone conversations, audio cassettes (which open with a
trumpet fanfare that sounds like a 40's Movietone newsreel) is almost
always calm and didactic.</p>
<p>During a recent visit to German-American friends in the San
Francisco Bay Area, Z&uuml;ndel surprised me with a phone call and invited
me over for a lengthy and wide ranging discussion and interview. The
word "Z&uuml;ndel," I found out, comes from the same root as "z&uuml;ndeln"--to
play with fire. The word, he explained, can have the connotation of
either a spark plug (that which ignites something for a desired
purpose) or someone running irresponsibly through the haystacks. "A
Jewish woman psychic told me that in my previous incarnation [he meant
it figuratively] at a convention where I was peddling my UFO book that
this was a very powerful name. Something that can spark a revolution.
Like 'Iskra'" (in Russian, "the spark," the title of one of Lenin's
journals).</p>
<p>Z&uuml;ndel was born in Germany in 1939, and his earliest memories while
growing up in a small village in the Black Forest are of the sound of
the Allied bombing raids and of waking up frightened, cold and
shivering, even in summer.  Z&uuml;ndel said he has no memories whatsoever
of Jews from his days in Germany. He did not meet his first Jew until
he was 19 years old and living in Canada.  There he met and married a
French Canadian girl and became a successful commercial artist,
specializing in photo retouching, (which he found to be a most
profitable line of work). He paints in a style he likens to that of
Andrew Wyeth, and has sold over 700 paintings to buyers around the
world, 80% of whom he estimates were Jews, a fact he apparently thinks
is important for us to know.</p>
<p>When discussing his work as a commercial artist, Z&uuml;ndel told me
that he had never employed a salesman, but acted as his own salesman
and used lunches and dinners to combine business with pleasure. I have
worked with a fair number of salesmen over the years and Z&uuml;ndel is as
good as any I have met. His introduction is pleasant and filled with
stories and self-deprecating humor.  He quickly reverses himself in
order to agree with his interlocutor on anything that is not critical
to his "game plan" Without making a written note, he remembers any
points that seem either to test the credulity or win support of his
interviewer and at convenient breaks produces supporting documentation
from his "briefing book" (a huge three-ring binder, similar to a
salesman's pitchbook). And he has his pitch down cold. I feel sorry
for any opponent who goes up against Z&uuml;ndel unprepared.</p>
<p>Z&uuml;ndel will dangle a reference to UFO's or the wisdom of the
ancient Atlanteans. If it has no effect, he just moves on. If it
elicits skepticism, he blows it off with a jovial "for whatever it's
worth." Given our early conversation on the UFO book, I'm still not
sure whether Z&uuml;ndel really believes any of this esoteric stuff or
whether he's just learned how effective pushing hot buttons is in
grabbing the media spotlight and perhaps bringing in donations.</p>
<p>"It's a lot like operating a church" he explained. "We survive on
donations." He has, in fact, survived well enough to provide for his
own defense, assist others in the preparation of theirs, conduct a
research project to determine who was really behind the U.S.
internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II, and is
currently going to send a multilingual team to Europe to investigate
and interview the "enigmatic revisionist" and noted Russian
ultranationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky.</p>
<p>It is as a Holocaust revisionist that Z&uuml;ndel has become incendiary.
In 1983, Sabrina Citron, a Holocaust survivor and founder of the
Canadian Holocaust Remembrance Association, placed a private complaint
against Z&uuml;ndel.  Z&uuml;ndel claims that Citron was a loose cannon and that
her action was based upon the desire to raise her profile and status
in the Canadian Jewish community and that most members considered her
action counterproductive.  Lipstadt agrees that "most Canadian Jewish
organizations did not support her decision" (p.157).</p>
<p>In 1984, the Canadian government initiated criminal proceedings
against Z&uuml;ndel based on Citron's complaint. Specifically, Z&uuml;ndel was
charged under section 177 (the false news section) of the Criminal
Code of Canada which provides that "every one who wilfully publishes a
statement, tale or news that he knows is false and that causes or is
likely to cause injury or mischief to a public interest is guilty of
an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for a term of not
exceeding two years" (Samisdat, 1992, p.1).  Z&uuml;ndel's actionable
behavior was publishing (not writing) two books: <em>The West, War, and
Islam</em>, and <em>Did Six Million Really Die?</em> (Again that question mark at
the end of the title.)</p>
<p>The trial, during which he appeared in court wearing the now
familiar Z&uuml;ndel garb of a bullet-proof vest and a hardhat bearing the
motto, "Freedom of Speech" in both English and German, took place in
1985. Z&uuml;ndel was acquitted of the false news charge for <em>The West, War,
and Islam</em>, but convicted for <em>Did Six Million Really Die?</em> He was
sentenced to 15 months in jail. That conviction was subsequently
overturned on appeal and a new trial ordered.</p>
<p>The second trial became a revisionist media event in which Z&uuml;ndel's
lawyer largely succeeded in putting the Holocaust, rather than his
client, on trial.  Z&uuml;ndel was able to call leading revisionists
Faurisson, Leuchter, Irving, Weber and others as expert witnesses.
Z&uuml;ndel's company, Samisdat Publishers (1993) has printed a 566-page
summary of the testimony presented in that trial. ("Samisdat" is
derived from the Russian word for "self-publication" the way all
works, fact and fiction, had to be published unless they were
"officially approved" in the former Soviet Union.)</p>
<p>Z&uuml;ndel was again convicted, but the case worked its way up to the
Canadian Supreme Court, which struck down the publishing false news
statute as an unconstitutional violation of free speech (<em>B'nai B'rith
Covenant</em>, 1993, p. 7).  Thus Ernst Z&uuml;ndel, self-described admirer of
der F&uuml;hrer, became a civil libertarian hero of Canada.</p>
<p>Z&uuml;ndel is not, however, home free, as some Canadian Jewish groups
have initiated further action against him under the anti-hate
provisions of Canadian law. The German ambassador to Canada, Dr.
Guenther Sulimma, joined with them when he told a B'nai B'rith
luncheon in Canada that he would formally ask the Canadian government
to do what it could to stop Z&uuml;ndel from publishing Holocaust
revisionist materials (<em>B'nai B'rith Covenant</em>, p. 7).</p>
<p>Z&uuml;ndel has retaliated by filing his own anti-hate suit against
various Canadian Jewish groups, citing the statement by Elie Wiesel in
his book, <em>Legends of Our Time</em>: "Every Jew, somewhere in his being,
should set apart a zone of hate--healthy, virile hate--for what the
German personifies and for what persists in the German." (<em>Journal of
Historical Review</em>, 1993b, p. 16). To date no action has been taken by
the Canadian authorities.</p>
<p>Z&uuml;ndel's "game plan," as he calls it, is to "first, bring down
Jewish suffering in terms of numbers and events, both real and
imagined, to what it really was, not what they say it was, what they
exploit for their own political, financial, and geopolitical
purposes." When asked to be more precise, he estimated total Jewish
deaths from all causes under the Nazi regime as only about 300,000.
His second goal is to make the world look at German suffering and the
Allied brutality toward Germany and realize that both peoples were
victims.</p>
<p>"Suppose," I asked, "new evidence, either from the archives or from
scientific analysis, proves that you and the revisionists were really
right all along. What would change?"</p>
<p>"First," he replied "all the numbers would go down. It would be a
satisfying personal victory to know that I was right; that I had been
a trailblazer and an iconoclast. History would be rewritten and
corrected and I could get out of this stuff and get back to my life."</p>
<p>"What about aid to Israel?"</p>
<p>"I would cut it off immediately," he stated, as his voice shifted
from its usual avuncular tone to the more strident one he calls "the
eloquence of emergency." Israel, he says, is "a parasitic enterprise
and they don't deserve it. It wouldn't happen if it weren't for the
Holocaust. The Jews will have to give back the money to the Germans or
to the Palestinians and make restitution to the Germans. They must
apologize verbally and then financially. They got the money
illegitimately. It must be turned over to legitimate causes."</p>
<p>"Why go back in time?" I asked. "Why not just wipe the slate
clean?"</p>
<p>In an even more strident tone he replied, "Why should we let
parasites and liars live with their loot? They took it from Egypt (a
reference to the Old Testament Exodus). They're not going to take it
from the Germans."</p>
<p>"Those are awfully strong words," I said, offering him a chance to
take them back were he to feel they were spoken in a moment of anger.</p>
<p>"They are strong words. After what I've suffered, the price I've
paid, I have the right to use strong words."</p>
<p>I gave him yet another chance. "You're comfortable being quoted on
that?"</p>
<p>"Absolutely. The Holocaust has become an enterprise based on
falsehoods and lies and they are promoting it criminally."</p>
<p>I asked Z&uuml;ndel what might have happened if in 1917, when both sides
had been putting out peace feelers, all sides had gone back to the
pre-World War I borders and there had been no Treaty of Versailles. He
replied that it was the Treaty of Versailles that created Hitler. The
Kaiser had offered to do that, but there wasn't peace in 1917 because
the Jewish political and financial interests manipulated the U.S. into
the war.</p>
<p>Realizing that in Z&uuml;ndel's view the Jews had a hand in everything,
I granted him that there was a Jewish lobby (or an Israeli lobby) and
that it was powerful. But how is what AIPAC does (the American Israel
Public Affairs Committee) different, quantitatively or qualitatively
from what the National Rifle Association does?</p>
<p>Z&uuml;ndel replied that they were totally different. The NRA was made
up of Americans concerned about their Second Amendment Rights. Z&uuml;ndel
told me he wasn't envious of Jewish power; he was alarmed by it.
Unlike the NRA or other lobbying groups, the Jewish lobby, he said,
works for a foreign power.</p>
<p>And at that moment Z&uuml;ndel's conspiratorial mind opened up. He
referred me to Francis Parker Yockey's book, <em>Imperium</em>, which shows
how the Jews have distorted and perverted the direction of Western
culture. He informed me that Jews lack what he called,
"fingerspitzengefuhl," which he translated from the German as "the
touch of the fingers." Throughout history this has derailed Jewish
enterprises. Since they didn't listen to Moses, Z&uuml;ndel doubted they'd
listen to him. They were on the path to becoming intellectual Baruch
Goldsteins (a reference to the American born Israeli West Bank settler
who recently gunned down defenseless Palestinians in a mosque). When I
asked what the result of their not heeding him would be, Z&uuml;ndel told
me massive pogroms were ahead.</p>
<p>"Suppose the evidence proves you're wrong. What will you then do?"
I asked.  He replied "I'll spend my last money issuing apologies and
retire."</p>
<p>When asked if he could think of any definitive experiment that
could decide the gas chamber issue one way or the other Z&uuml;ndel offered
the macabre suggestion that someone build a gas chamber according to
what are alleged to be the plans, get DEGESH to supply the gas, fill
it with people, gas them and see if they in fact died. Since the U.S.
continues to execute people, we could also save some money in
conducting such an experiment.</p>
<p>Z&uuml;ndel's Judeophobia is clear enough. His Germanophilia is no less
potent.  In our conversation he waxed eloquent about all of Hitler's
accomplishments.  He believes that Europe is only now 50 years later
arriving where Hitler wanted it to be. Hitler, according to Z&uuml;ndel,
evolved from being a German ultranationalist, to a Pan German, to a
European. By the time the war ended, der Fuhrer had hit upon the idea
of a "Europa ethnica," in which each ethnic group could live
peacefully in its own little place. When I asked him if this was not
just so much propaganda to get Poles, Slovaks, and others to fight and
die to keep the Third Reich going just a little longer, Z&uuml;ndel
explained that I too was a victim of my limited American perspective.</p>
<p>Even if viewed from his perspective as a German ethnic activist, I
queried, was not Hitler more responsible than anyone for ruining
Germany and making Germans subservient to the Jews? "No," he stated.
"That would be blaming the victim! Hitler didn't bomb the German
cities. Hitler didn't fire the German university professors. Hitler
didn't . . . . " All this started to sound a little too much like
Franz Liebkind in Mel Brooks' <em>The Producers</em>: "Hitler was a better
dancer than Churchill. Hitler was a better singer than Churchill.
Churchill couldn't even say Nazi. He would say Naah-Zees, Bloody
Naah-Zees."</p>
<p>In checking my notes before publication I called Z&uuml;ndel one more
time, by chance on April 2Oth, the 105th anniversary of the birth of
Adolf Hitler. He complained that the Canadian authorities had detained
him when he returned and tried to seize his notes and briefing book.
He told me he was celebrating Hitler's birthday "the way we Germans
like to--by hard work!"</p>

<a name="faurisson">
<h2>L'Affaire Faurisson</h2>
</a>

Robert Faurisson, a professor of literature at the University of Lyon
2, has in a number of articles, argued that: (1) there never was a
preconceived German master plan to exterminate Jews; (2) no gas
chambers were ever in use in the Third Reich or its territories for
that purpose (those structures being, in fact, delousing chambers, as
is standard in POW camps and prisons); and (3) that the conventionally
accepted figure of six million Jewish deaths (including those from
disease and other "natural causes") is absurdly high.
<p>For making these statements, Faurisson was first dismissed from his
academic post on grounds that should send shivers down the spine of
any civil libertarian: ". . . the authorities couldn't protect him
from his enemies" (Herman, 1993, p. 8). He was in fact physically
beaten rather severely by anti-revisionists. Faurisson, his
publishers, and supporters who have distributed or promoted his
materials have been tried, convicted, fined, and barred from holding
any government jobs (<em>Le Monde</em>, 19 September 1983).</p>
<p>The convictions were under the Fabius-Gayssot law of 1990, largely
written with the express intent of criminalizing Faurisson's
revisionist activities, which should also raise civil libertarian
eyebrows. That law makes it a criminal offense "to contest by any
means the existence of one or more of the crimes against humanity as
defined by Article 6 of the Statutes of the International Military
Tribunal, attached to the London Agreement of August 8, 1945,
committed either by the members of an organization declared criminal
in application of Article 9 of the same Statutes, or by a person held
guilty of such a crime by a French or international jurisdiction."</p>
<p>Any meaningful appeal of those verdicts is therefore impossible
under French law. Faurisson and his supporters have been restricted in
court from mentioning "gas chambers" (ostensibly, the existence of
which they were convicted of questioning) and have been denied
government jobs. <em>Le Choc du Mois</em> ("The Shock of the Month") had to
cease operation because of the fines it repeatedly incurred in
publishing Faurisson's work.</p>

<a name="leuchter">
<h2>The Leuchter Protocol</h2>
</a>

For years, Fred Leuchter (who described himself as an "engineer,"
though he does not possess an engineering degree) made his living
developing, selling, and servicing execution devices. <em>The Execution
Protocol: Inside America's Capital Punishment Industry</em> (Trombley,
1992), contains a sympathetic portrait of Leuchter in his
pre-revisionist days. Lipstadt (1993) offers a scathing evaluation of
Leuchter's professional competence, even before his venture into
Holocaust revisionism.</p>
<p>Leuchter's involvement with Holocaust revisionism began when Z&uuml;ndel
called him as an expert witness as to the existence of gas chambers in
the Nazi concentration camps. Z&uuml;ndel's defense paid Leuchter $30,000
to perform an analysis on samples from the chambers, which Leuchter
obtained without the knowledge or consent of the Polish authorities.
This was strictly illegal.</p>
<p>According to the analysis performed by an independent laboratory on
the samples, Leuchter claimed, in the now famous "Leuchter Report,"
("An Engineering Report on the Alleged Execution Chambers at
Auschwitz, Birkenau, and Majdanek, Poland"), no gassing could have
taken place. (See Shermer's article for an analysis of this
controversy). The Leuchter Report became a revisionist international
best seller and Leuchter an overnight (and by his account, reluctant)
star of the movement. This produced a good deal of ill feeling for
Leuchter in certain circles.</p>
<p>In response, Serge and Beate Klarsfeld joined a local Massachusetts
survivors group and brought an action against Leuchter for practicing
engineering without a license. This statute had been previously
untested (Trombley, p. 88) and according to the figures supplied by
Z&uuml;ndel, less than 20% of the "engineers" practicing in Massachusetts
are so licensed. Like the Z&uuml;ndel trials, the Leuchter trial became a
media event.</p>
<p>Leuchter eventually signed a consent decree barring him from using
the title "engineer" (Trombley, p. 90). This was really academic. All
of his contracts with the various states have been terminated and,
according to Z&uuml;ndel, some states have reneged on outstanding invoices
so that Leuchter has been left holding the bag on some rather
expensive equipment.</p>
<p>In the tape interview distributed by Z&uuml;ndel (1993), Leuchter (whose
name in German, Z&uuml;ndel tells his listeners, means "illuminator,"
though "candelabra" is the preferred translation) tells his lawyer
Kirk Lyons, that his life is a shambles and his business is ruined.
Leuchter now exists on speaking fees from sympathetic revisionist
groups and working at odd jobs. He receives no royalties on the
Leuchter report. (Leuchter did not return any of my numerous phone
calls.)</p>
<p>Leuchter gave a speech in Germany in 1991 based on the finding of
his report. He later returned to that country to appear as a guest on
the popular German TV program, <em>Schreinemakers</em>, to discuss capital
punishment. He was arrested in the TV studio before the program began
on "suspicion he would use the TV show to incite racism and to slander
the memory of Holocaust victims" (<em>Canada News</em>, 1993, p. 12).</p>
<p>Initially held without bail, he was subsequently released and is
now in the United States. Gunther Deckert, head of the right-wing
National Democratic Party of Germany set up the Leuchter speech and
served as translator. He was arrested and charged with "defaming the
dead" by translating and agreeing with Leuchter's arguments.
Leuchter's lawyer, Hajo Herrmann, was also placed under investigation,
though not formally charged, for having repeated Leuchter's arguments
during his client's bail proceeding (<em>K&ouml;lner Stadt-Anzeiger</em>, 1993, p.
3).</p>
<p>In March of 1994, the German Federal Court of Justice (Germany's
highest appeals court) revoked Deckert's $6,000 fine and one year
suspended sentence.  The court ordered a retrial of Deckert on the
grounds that it was "too much of an overgeneralization" to assume that
he had "attacked the dignity of the Jewish community in Germany by
claiming that the Holocaust had not occurred" and that a new trial
must prove that he was guilty of specifically "inciting racial hatred"
(<em>Boston Globe</em>, 1994, p. 6). This ruling should affect Leuchter's
trial, which will take place later this year.</p>

<h2>David Irving: Self-Made Historian</h2>
</a>

If David Irving were an American baseball fan, he would turn off the
sound on the TV because he could not stand the announcers, and he
would read the box scores every morning without even looking at the AP
wire, let alone the big name columnists. When he decided to become
fluent in German, he did not take German 101 or order
"learn-a-language" tapes; he spent two years as a steel worker in
Germany.
<p>Irving goes about writing history in the same do-it-yourself
manner. He has no formal academic training in history. In fact, he
holds most academic historians in contempt. While they spend their
time reading each others' books, Irving avoids secondary and
interpretive sources and instead immerses himself in the archives,
going through diaries, correspondence, handwritten notes of the person
he's writing about, his staff and intimates.</p>
<p>Irving has written or is in the process of writing a book on most
of the major figures of World War II. When I reached him for a series
of telephone interviews he was going over the final draft of <em>Dr.
Goebbels</em>.</p>
<p>Irving's method of relying on only primary sources gives his books
a unique style and a very controversial impact. Some are more in the
form of a chronology than an interpretive summary. They often read
more like Joe Friday than Gibbon or Macaulay. And like a police
report, they contain firsthand information you will find nowhere else,
which is why they have been required reading at such places as West
Point, the Army War College at Carlisle, Pennsylvania, the British
Open University, and the Royal Institute of International Affairs.</p>
<p>Critics would argue that Irving's methodology is not only his
strength, but his greatest weakness. The mildest criticism would be
that in his avoidance of secondary and interpretive sources, his
reader loses any sense of context and is unable to see the forest for
all the (unearthed) trees.</p>
<p>A stronger criticism would be that after providing a mass of
details, Irving seizes upon some "zinger" as support for some
controversial thesis and thereby guarantees publicity and sales. When
I asked Irving if he thought this criticism had any merit, he answered
that if he discovers "zingers as you call them," he documents them and
follows the evidence wherever it leads him; he does not manufacture
them. He also told me that certain forms of controversy hurt sales and
result in costly litigation.</p>
<p>The strongest criticism would be that Irving uses whatever he can
find in the mass of documents to support his own "mild fascist"
position. In 1979 he argued in <em>Hitler's War</em> that not only was there no
evidence of a F&uuml;hrer order for the extermination of the Jews, but that
Hitler himself did not know what was going on with respect to the Jews
(at least in the beginning). Since then his conclusions have
consistently moved in a revisionist direction that reduces the
culpability assigned to Germany in general and Hitler in particular,
both for starting the war and practicing genocide.</p>
<p>Irving told me that the oft-repeated characterization of him as a
"self-described mild Fascist" was neither fair nor accurate and was
based on a 1959 article that was "retracted immediately." He prefers
to describe himself as an "ultraconservative with socialist leanings."
As for reducing Nazi culpability, Irving stated that he has publicly
accepted every Nazi atrocity or crime for which he can find hard
evidence.</p>
<p>Controversy and litigation are no strangers to Irving. But it was
only after his testimony in the Z&uuml;ndel trial that governments placed
criminal charges against him, that he was deported or denied entry,
and that his books were removed from stores and/or the stores
vandalized. He told me he realized that there was "a campaign to shut
me up" and that he "was up against an international organization with
considerable clout." I asked him to identify the organization, which
he did as "the traditional enemies of the truth."</p>
<p>In May, 1992, Irving told a German audience that the gas chamber
shown to tourists at Auschwitz was "a fake built after the war." In
June, 1992, he was coming to Rome from Moscow. When the plane landed,
it was surrounded by police and Irving was put on the next plane to
Munich. He was charged under the German law of "defaming the memory of
the dead" and fined 3,000DM. He appealed the conviction and on
subsequent appeals the conviction was upheld and the fine increased
first to 10,000 and then to 30,000DM, or about $20,000. (The German
legal system provides for increasing the penalty on appeal. Irving was
not the victim of extralegal tactics, nor has he ever claimed this).
In all his appeals, Irving was not allowed to call the director of the
Auschwitz museum as a witness to confirm his statement. (The Auschwitz
gas chamber is, in fact, a reconstruction built after the war. No one
at the Auschwitz museum denies this.)</p>
<p>Later that year, while in California, Irving received a letter from
the Canadian government saying that he would not be allowed into that
country because of the German conviction. He did enter Canada,
legally, in October, 1992, to receive the George Orwell award from a
conservative free speech organization. He was arrested by the Royal
Canadian Mounted Police, led away in handcuffs and told that he was
being deported on the grounds that he had been convicted of a criminal
offense in Germany and was likely to perform similar acts in Canada.
According to Irving, he had been to the country numerous times before
without even a traffic ticket.</p>
<p>At present he cannot legally enter Canada, Australia, New Zealand,
Italy, Germany, or South Africa.  When he is allowed into certain
countries, the authorities sometimes present Irving with a list of
just what it is he is not allowed to say. The list can sometimes run
12-15 pages.</p>
<p>Irving feels he has also suffered professionally because of his
revisionist views. Waterstones and Dillon's (British book chains)
decided to keep Irving's books out of view after a number of their
stores had been vandalized (Brownlee, 1992). The German Federal
Archives in Coblenz, to which Irving has donated one ton of materials,
has denied him further access and he is demanding the return of his
materials. In March of 1994, Macmillan, the American publisher of
Irving's forthcoming book on Dr. Goebbels, rejected his final draft
and demanded the return of his (sizable) advance.</p>
<p>Irving's current position is that no one has offered proof (or now
even tries) to contradict his argument that there was no "F&uuml;hrer
order;" that the total number of Jewish deaths should be reduced to a
figure below one million; that the Leuchter Report is firm evidence
against the existence of gas chambers which has been independently
confirmed; and that the number of gassings that may have taken place
in mobile vans or other experimental devices was at most an
insignificant percentage of the total deaths.</p>
<p>Having grown up in a mob town in New Jersey, I asked Irving why one
would even hope to find a written order, as such things usually take
the form of verbal commands: "Hey Vito, can you take care of that
thing for me?" Irving agreed that the "Godfather" method might well
have been the way it happened.</p>
<p>I suggested to Irving that Hitler's declaration of war on the
United States on December 10, 1941, was evidence that der F&uuml;hrer
realized he would either win the war and have the history books
written the way he wanted, or lose completely, in which case he would
take as many of his enemies with him as he could. Given this mindset,
he probably encouraged Himmler to "take care of that Jewish thing."
Irving responded that such an interpretation did not contradict the
evidence and may well have been what happened. While going through the
Goebbels diaries he found that from about 1942 on Goebbels repeatedly
said things like "We have crimes on our book. We can't go back. We can
only go forward." I quoted Shakespeare's murderous Richard III (Act
IV, scene ii), "I am so far in blood that sin will pluck on sin.
Tear-falling pity dwells not in this eye," which Irving thought fit
quite well.</p>
<p>My conversations with Irving were quite different from those with
either Z&uuml;ndel or Mark Weber. Where Z&uuml;ndel struck me as a supersalesman
looking for a way to close, and Weber seemed like a therapist trying
to help me get over denial, Irving came across as the polished
professional, with immediate recall of a wealth of facts and figures
and little concern whether I agreed with him or not. This difference
became even more obvious when I asked Irving: "suppose the
revisionists are proven correct, what would change?" He responded,
"the press would immediately say, 'we knew it all along.'" He then
read his "Note for the Record," which he asks all journalists to sign
before interviewing him on the Holocaust:</p>
<blockquote>
      Being a responsible journalist reporting for _______, I solemnly
      affirm that I still believe in the existence during World War
      Two of "gas chambers" and "factories of death" in which Nazis
      killed millions of their opponents.  Signed______ Print
      Name______ Date______
<br>_Alternatively_: signature declined, (signed)______
</blockquote>
(Since I am acting as a journalist for <em>Skeptic</em>, here is how I
responded to Irving's note: "I neither affirm your note as provided,
nor decline to participate. Here's what, based on reading and
interviews, including you and revisionists, I presently think:
Millions of Jews died in Europe under the Nazis. Some died of disease,
overwork, brutality in the camps. Some were shot on the spot by
Einsatzgruppen and Nazi collaborators. Some were systematically killed
in the camps by methods that included gassing. I've found no 'hard'
percentages. I'll continue to believe this until and unless you or
someone else can convince me otherwise." Irving told me that I was the
second person to provide an alternative version. All others had simply
declined. None had signed.)
<p>When I asked Irving what he would do if proven wrong, he again
offered a professional and unemotional reply. He said he'd move on to
something else, satisfied that he had argued the case well.</p>
<p>Where revisionism is a crusade for Z&uuml;ndel, for Irving it seems more
an intellectual battle royal. And when it's done and over, he believes
he'll be the last one standing and will take particular delight in
stepping over the bodies of the academics he has KO'd along the way.</p>
<p>Intellectually, Irving's extremely proud. He told me how, when he
was imprisoned in England for contempt of court arising out of a libel
action brought by Australian Jewish organizations, his fellow
prisoners, especially blacks, treated him with respect and dignity.
Irving is miffed that John Charmley is getting the credit for the
current wave of Churchill revisionism going on in Britain, when it was
he (Irving) who started it all. He's even more miffed that Vladimir
Zhirinovsky has taken Irving's place as the star speaker at right-wing
talkfests put on by the German publisher Gerhard Frey.  He considers
Zhirinovsky an unstable lightweight who'll never be taken seriously,
and feels Frey has wasted his money bankrolling Zhirinovsky's
political campaign.</p>
<p>Irving enjoys taking chances and defending controversial positions
for the intellectual challenge. He doesn't like to be labeled or
pigeon-holed. He's currently working on a book on FDR, whom he found
to be an exceptionally capable war time leader who listened to his
generals, lost relatively few lives, "took us (Brits) for all we had,"
and made the U.S. a great power. He considers America's subsequent
wars (Korea, Vietnam, Iraq, and Panama) to have been counterproductive
and racist and thinks the American media have done a terrible job of
presenting the story to us. After likening the Gulf War to the
Holocaust, in October, 1991, he was thrown out of an Argentine TV
studio and all his lectures in that country were cancelled.</p>

<a name="slippery">
<h2>Down the Slippery Slope</h2>
</a>

Given the unpleasant nature of the subject matter and in many cases
the motivation, manner, and association (past, present, and probably
future) of Holocaust revisionists, one might accuse me of falling back
on the Slippery Slope argument. That argument contends that when
government invokes some compelling state interest to "trump" an
existing right for an unpopular minority, one sets in motion a process
that eventually undermines the rights of all. With respect to the
history of the Third Reich, the Slippery Slope argument takes the form
of Reverend Niem&ouml;eller's famous challenge to bystandars: "First they
came for the socialists, and I did not speak out--because I was not a
socialist. Then they came for the trade-unionists, and I did not speak
out--because I was not a trade-unionist.Then they came for the Jews,
and I did not speak out--because I was not a Jew. Then they came for
me--and there was no one left to speak for me."
<p>I will go even further and argue that in the post-Cold War world
censorship in general is on the increase, not the decrease. And where
once "national security" could be invoked to deny basic civil rights
to dissidents, now preventing injury to some one's (or particularly
some group's) "self esteem" is the cry being used by one and all to
erode long established constitutional rights. A recent poll by the
<em>National Law Journal</em> found 49% of Americans surveyed "say it would
be 'compelling' for a defendant to argue that fury as a result of
long-term, institutionalized racism, caused an individual to snap"
(Sherman, 1994, p. A19).</p>
<p>Related to anti-revisionism legislation, consider next the
unintended consequences of anti-pornography legislation. Canada has
led the free, industrial world in anti-porn laws. Indeed, the hate
speech laws used against Z&uuml;ndel are part of the same legislation. The
Canadian Supreme Court has expanded the definition of pornography "to
include depictions of sex that degrades or exploits women or other
groups." The result--customs officials have gone on a rampage of
seizing books that include scenes of rape, bestiality, child sex, sex
with family members (even if not genetically related) or <em>even if such
acts are just implied</em>! The same customs service memo also covers
"hate propaganda," defined in the memo to include "material blaming
any specific group for economic problems or for manipulating the
media" (Lyall, 1993, p. A6).</p>
<p>According to Lyall's story in <em>The New York Times</em>, "hundreds of
books, magazines, and newspapers have been detained, often for months
at a time, or banned outright." The most frequent targets of such
seizures have not been 24-hour hard-core porn shops filled with
inflatable dolls and misogynistic "stroke books," but gay and lesbian
books and magazines, small publishers, and small (often gay and
lesbian) proprietorship bookstores--one quarter of Canada's feminist
bookstores according to the National Coalition Against Censorship
(1993b, p. 1).</p>
<p>Well-known feminists Andrea Dworkin and Catherine MacKinnon have
argued that pornography by its very nature constitutes violence
against women, and must therefore be banned. It is perhaps the
ultimate vindication of the Slippery Slope argument to point out that
their works are among those that have been seized (NCAC, 1993a, p. 4)!
And based on the examples Dworkin provides of just what it is she is
against, they would have to be. By like reasoning, Deborah Lipstadt's
book, and this issue of <em>Skeptic</em>, for that matter, could be seized on
the grounds that we have, by way of summary, repeated the arguments of
the Holocaust revisionists and some simple soul out there could
conceivably be won over by them.</p>
<p>Along these lines, a librarian in Montana recently was fired
because "she assisted two seventh-grade girls with their research by
giving them information from encyclopedias and lending them two books
of her own after making sure that they had their parents' and
teacher's approval" (Hoffman, 1994, p. A23). The subject was not
revisionism, but the Salem witchcraft trials (though the study of the
government suppression of witchcraft could be classified as feminist
revisionist history). The West Valley School Board of Trustees in
their press release argued that Ms. Denzer was only a "library aide"
and that while the two books in question contained "graphic text and
pictures depicting atrocities toward women," they contained "only a
few pages of information" or "no references" to the Salem witch trials
(West Valley School Board, 1994). Apparently the West Valley School
Board sees no value in background research. Since the Bill of Rights
does not explicitly mention the Salem witchcraft trials, I guess
students at West Valley should not request a copy of it either. As to
protecting school children from the harmful effects of "graphic
depictions of atrocities," the school board should perhaps feel
compelled to speak with Z&uuml;ndel before allowing any pupils to see
<em>Schindler's List</em>.</p>
<p>Librarians are in fact duty bound by American Library Association
policy "to obtain requested material without regard to bias or
personal judgment" (Hoffman, p. A23). A decision by the U.S. First
Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed that Holocaust revisionist materials
be treated in "a reasonable and nondiscriminatory manner, equally
applicable to all and administered with equality to all" (Polish
Historical Society News Release 1993). As some feminists consider
witchcraft trials the "women's holocaust," the school board's actions
have the effect of not only violating the rights of revisionists but
of simultaneously "denying a holocaust," a punishable offense in other
countries.</p>
<p>Regarding the use of law to restrict and prohibit Holocaust
revisionism, the skeptical ethic can do no better than to follow the
counsel given by Thomas Jefferson: "If a sect arises, whose tenets
would subvert morals, good sense has fair play, and reasons and laughs
it out of doors, without suffering the state to be troubled by it"
(Jefferson, 1964, p.154). He noted that when "reason and experiment"
are employed, "error" flees before them. "It is error alone that needs
the support of government. Truth can stand by itself" (p.  153).</p>
<p>If the skeptical ethic is clear on anything it is that individuals
should not be subjected to government force (that is, arrest,
imprisonment, fines) simply for what they believe, say, or write,
rather than for what they do. It is perhaps as good a definition of
dictatorship (as opposed to rule of law) as any that individuals are
prosecuted (and persecuted) not for what they have actually done, but
for what unspecified actions they or others influenced by them (also
unspecified) <em>might</em> perform at some unspecified future time.</p>
<p>The quashing of the false news law by the Canadian Supreme Court in
the Z&uuml;ndel case, and the demand for retrial on the grounds of
overgenerality by the German Appeals Court in the Deckert case,
indicate that the courts in the countries that do have
anti-revisionist laws are moving in the direction of the skeptical
ethic and of Thomas Jefferson. They are also acting in the spirit of
those sections of the Helsinki Accords that deal with freedom of
travel, personal contact, and communication (Lawson, 1991, pp.
717-719). To date, the most effective and respected revisionist has
been the Israeli high court, which in effect threw out both survivor
testimony and documentation from government archives that were
introduced as evidence by the prosecution when they acquitted John
Demjanjuk.</p>

<h2>Can There Be Valid Holocaust Revisionism?</h2>
</a>

If the Holocaust is to be treated as a historical event, rather than
an article of religious faith, it must be subjected to continued,
critical revision, and treated no differently than the Battle of
Waterloo or any other historical event. As Eatwell (1992) points out,
the defining characteristic of serious revisionism, as opposed to
propagandistic denial, is that the former serves to broaden debate,
the latter to narrow it. Valid revisionism provides information on
which others may reach different conclusions, rather than confirmation
and reconfirmation of a predefined (though contrarian) point of view.
<p>In doing so, valid revisionism raises more questions than it
answers. Among those noted by Eatwell regarding the Holocaust are
"detailed questions about the procurement of transport for the Jews .
. . general questions about the Nazi regime, whether the system was
truly totalitarian, or whether it was more chaotic and fragmented than
has generally been assumed . . . sweeping issues, such as the question
of human nature, or the concept of progress" (1992, p.  143).</p>
<p>One of the important matters raised by historians is the debate
between "functionalists" who believe the Holocaust "just evolved," and
"intentionalists" who contend that exterminations were planned very
early on (see Marrus, 1987, pp. 34-48). Irving's archival research
satisfies Eatwell's criterion. It was, in fact, Martin Broszat's
critique of Irving's <em>Hitler's War</em> that moved the
functionalist-intentionalist debate from academic circles into broader
public debate (Marrus, p. 40).</p>
<p>Even Z&uuml;ndel, who sparks more heat than light and is often
deliberately inflammatory, did get the "false news" law struck down
and thus extended the civil rights of all Canadians. The summary of
the second Z&uuml;ndel trial, produced by Z&uuml;ndel's Samisdat Press, provides
a bibliography and an index in addition to the testimony and is a
valuable resource.</p>
<p>Lipstadt, one of the severest critics of Holocaust revisionists,
notes that Jean-Claude Pressac was at first impressed by Faurisson's
"seemingly vast array of knowledge" and "began to meet with him on a
regular basis" (p.175).  It was only after Pressac studied Faurisson's
work and then rejected it that he produced his own work, which
Lipstadt and others believe so effectively destroys the revisionist
argument on the gas chambers.</p>
<p>"The problem of all factionalism," philosopher Hans Sluga pointed
out in this analysis of the Heidigger controversy "is that it already
knows the answers to the questions it raises" (1993, p. 5). To fully
participate in a valid historical examination of the Holocaust,
revisionists cannot continue to simply "nibble at the edges" of the
accepted version, seizing upon any discrepancy or seeming
contradiction between proponents of the accepted view as proof that
the whole thing never happened, in the manner of creationists and
Kennedy conspiracy theorists.</p>
<p>A defense lawyer need only create a reasonable doubt in the mind of
at least one juror to deny the prosecution a conviction. In academic
argument, when challenging the "received version," at some point one
must provide an alternative interpretation of greater plausibility.
And this is precisely what most serious skeptical literature on ESP,
faith healing, and the like does.  Likewise, Holocaust revisionists
must provide their own detailed account of what actually did happen to
all those Jews if they did not die the way we have been told they did.
To date, their best attempt is Butz's (1976) virtually unreadable <em>The
Hoax of the Twentieth Century</em>.</p>
<p>In particular, to be taken seriously and not be dismissed as
"conspiracy theorists," revisionists cannot invoke the machinations of
powerful, nefarious Zionist controlled entities to explain away any
testimony or evidence that supports the received version. Rather,
revisionists must demonstrate independent, falsifiable (in Popper's
sense of being capable of being disproved) evidence that a small group
of Zionist Jews could so effectively put one over on all the rest of
us, at no small cost to us, and yet have proved singularly unable to
rescue the bulk of their coreligionists from the horrors that befell
them (even if only the limited set of horrors conceded by the
revisionists).</p>
<p>If and when Holocaust revisionists produce such material they must
be provided full liberty to write, speak, and distribute it, and be
accorded the opportunity to present it in respectable journals and
academic fora. They should be extended the opportunity to engage in
open, fair, and lengthy debate before knowledgeable audiences (rather
than "hit and run" appearances before self-selected groups) along with
anyone of a contrary view who chooses to appear opposite them. If such
opportunity is refused, they should self-publish their work along with
the rejections and accompanying correspondence and thereby, as Mr.
Jefferson said, "let good sense have fair play."</p>

<h2>SIDEBAR 1: HOLOCAUST REVISIONISM AND THE LAW</h2>
</a>

Ernst Z&uuml;ndel: Convicted by a Canadian court of inciting racial
hatred by spreading false news for publishing (not writing) the
Holocaust revisionist pamphlet, <em>Did Six Million Really Die?</em> Retried
because of procedural errors in the first trial, the second trial
became a media event, with other revisionists listed below called as
expert witnesses on his behalf. Z&uuml;ndel was again convicted. On appeal,
the Canadian Supreme Court struck down the false news law as
unconstitutional.

<p>David Irving: Best-selling British historian of World War II, has
moved to an increasingly revisionist position since he first claimed
in <em>Hitler's War</em> (1977) that Hitler knew nothing of the extermination
of the Jews until late in 1943. Since testifying on behalf of Z&uuml;ndel,
Irving was fined in Germany for "defaming the memory of the dead,"
deported from Canada on the grounds that he was "likely to commit a
criminal offense" (based on the German conviction) and denied entry to
Australia on the grounds that he was "likely to become involved in
violence." At present, he cannot legally enter Canada, Australia, New
Zealand, Germany, Italy, or South Africa.</p>

<p>Robert Faurisson: Professor at University of Lyon 2, who wrote that
no homicidal gas chambers were ever in use in the Nazi concentration
camps.  Originally suspended from teaching on the grounds that the
authorities "could not protect him" after he was physically beaten,
Faurisson, his publishers, and supporters have been fined for
"contesting the crimes against humanity as defined by the Nuremberg
War Crimes Tribunal."</p>

<p>Fred Leuchter: American developer and servicer of execution
devices, testified at Z&uuml;ndel's second trial that, based on his
examination of the Nazi concentration camps, no executions by "gas
chamber" could have taken place. He repeated his findings before a
right-wing group in Germany. His translator was arrested for "defaming
the memory of the dead." Leuchter was arrested when he returned to
appear on a German TV program to discuss capital punishment. He is
currently in the US, awaiting trial in Germany. The highest German
Appeals Court ordered a retrial of Leuchter's translator (a leader of
the right-wing party) and revoked the prison sentence and fine on the
grounds that simply denying the Holocaust did not constitute
defamation. Leuchter's lawyer has been placed under investigation, but
not officially charged, for repeating Leuchter's findings as to the
nonexistence of gas chambers during a bond hearing.</p>

<h2>SIDEBAR 2: Also Sprach Z&uuml;ndel</h2>
</a>

From <em>Skeptic</em>'s Interview of Ernst Z&uuml;ndel by Frank Miele:

<p>The number of Jews killed: "All deaths, from all causes, in
concentration camps--300,000."</p>
<p>What the Germans did to the Jews: "I think that there should have
been much kinder methods found."</p>
<p>Holocausts and Genocides: "To the Germans, Dresden was the
Holocaust--burning by fire."</p>
<p>Steven Spielberg: "He is celebrating the tribe in Hollywood. This
is so arrogant."</p>
<p>His own politics: "I'm not a Marxist Socialist. I'm a National
Socialist."</p>
<p>Persecution: "Because of what has happened to me I now know how it
must have felt to be a Jew in Nazi Germany."</p>
<p>Adolf Hitler: "I am an admirer of how this man took a country that
was like a beaten child amongst nations and within six years turned
that place around and made it into the marvel that National Socialist
Germany was in 1938. He was a humble man with wonderful, intuitive
gifts. Hitler's contribution to mankind, if he had died in 1939, would
be as one of the great statesman of the 20th century."</p>
<p>Ernst Z&uuml;ndel: "Society would do well to listen to its outcasts.
These people have a story to tell."</p>
<p>Long term goals: "To bring Jewish suffering down to what it was,
not what they say it was, and what they exploit. Then make the world
take a look at the Allied behavior toward Germany. Then we can talk to
each other as equals and see that both peoples were victims."</p>
