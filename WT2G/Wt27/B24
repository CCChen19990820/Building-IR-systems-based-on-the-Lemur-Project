 Ocean Color around Tasmania: Phytoplankton pigment concentrations 
(increasing from blue-green-yellow-red) off the coasts of Tasmania and 
Australia.<P>



	Covering more than 70 percent of the Earth and holding 97 percent of the 
water on our planet's surface, the ocean functions as a large reservoir 
of heat on the Earth's surface. The ocean and atmosphere exchange heat, 
momentum, and gases, and this interaction is the key to weather and 
climate patterns. Large-scale disruptions of weather patterns, such as 
those associated with El Nino, emphasize the importance of the ocean in 
our daily lives. We now know that the ocean controls such major changes 
as ice ages, and that large alterations occur in response to small 
changes in ocean conditions.<P>

	The ocean sustains a rich diversity of life, with biological activity 
rivaling that of land. Marine life plays its greatest role in the cycling 
of carbon, the base element for life and for key atmospheric greenhouse 
gases. Most biological production (the building of living matter from raw 
materials) in the ocean, as on land, occurs through photosynthesis. The 
main raw material for photosynthesis is dissolved carbon dioxide (CO2). 
Increasing CO2 concentrations, primarily caused by fossil-fuel burning, 
make it Critical for us to understand how quickly CO2 is dissolved, used, 
or stored in the oceans. Large amounts of carbon are recycled through 
food chains, some is released back to the atmosphere, and a large 
fraction settles to the bottom as dead organisms to be stored in 
sediments. Attempts to balance the Earth's carbon budgets will not 
succeed until we can measure accurately these stores and processes on a 
global basis.<P>

	Researchers depend increasingly on information from satellites, ships, 
buoys, and computer models to gain a more complete picture of the ocean, 
and to enhance abilities to forecast ocean conditions akin to predicting 
daily weather.<P>

	Remote sensing from space is the only method that can supply consistent 
and routine observations covering the whole globe. The EOS will make 
space-based observations that provide measurements of temperature, 
surface elevation, wind speed and direction, sea-ice coverage, and 
phytoplankton pigments. Budget estimates for carbon and heat in the ocean 
also need EOS observations of solar radiation, clouds, and water vapor. 
The knowledge gained will help us to understand better the role of oceans 
in the global climate system, and to assess the impact of climate changes 
on resources such as fisheries and coastal lands and waters.<P>

<H2>OCEAN APPLICATIONS</H2><P>The oceans cover two-thirds of the Earth's surface, and are a critical 
source of natural resources for both the developed and developing world.  
Changes in ocean temperature and circulation affect not only finite 
regions of the ocean itself, but also produce climate variations in 
distant lands.  The satellite measurements produced and distributed by 
CEOS members help in the management of ocean resources and in the 
understanding of their role in sustaining the Earth system.<P>


<center><B>Significant Wave Height</B><br><IMG SRC=""></center><P>
 
this image from the Ocean Topography Experiment (TOPEX)/Poseidon 
satellite shows wave height over the global oceans covering the September 
25 to October 4, 1992, time frame. The highest waves were observed in the 
Southern Ocean south of South Africa and Australia, where giant waves as 
high as 8 m were recorded (indicated in red). The pattern of wave height 
is dependent upon the season, with the highest waves tending to occur in 
the winter and the lowest in summer.  The primary objective of the 
mission is to document ocean circulation patterns by measuring their 
signatures in the ocean surface topography. When combined with in situ 
measurements and ocean circulation models, these measurements will permit 
global-scale studies of the interaction of active surface circulation 
with slow-moving deep waters-the key to understanding long-term climate 
variability.  TOPEX/Poseidon is a joint U.S./France mission.  Provided

Colour</B><br> The very lowest link of the world's food chain is 
phytoplankton-the microscopic chlorophyll-bearing plants that convert 
sunlight, water, inorganic salts, and carbon dioxide into organic matter 
through the process of photosynthesis. Concentrations of phytoplankton 
tint the near-surface water with characteristic colours, and wide area 
photography can reveal the relative productivity of different ocean 
areas-the more plankton, the greater number of sea creatures that can be 
supported.  These data prove invaluable to the fishing industry in 
tracking schools of fish.  The above Coastal Zone Colour Scanner (CZCS) 
image was composited from 30 scenes of phytoplankton abundance, collected 
in May 1980 by NASA's Nimbus-7 satellite. The relatively clear, 
pigment-poor waters of the Mediterranean contrast sharply with the 
plankton-rich Atlantic waters off the coast of Spain (upper left).  In 
some cases, localized areas of high production are a result of pollution.

<body>

<center><h2> EPA says sea level will rise 2 feet over next 
century<br></b>
(c) 1995 Copyright The News and Observer Publishing Co.(c) 1995 The 
Boston Globe
</h2></center>
<BR>

BOSTON (Oct 25, 1995 - 02:42 EDT) -- Retreating from prior predictions, 
the US Environmental Protection Agency said Tuesday that the sea level is 
likely to rise by about two feet over the next century, submerging 10,000 
square miles of American coastline.<P>

The estimate represents a 50 percent reduction from previous EPA 
forecasts, and the retreat drew taunts from scientists who are skeptical 
of global warming theory. But EPA officials said the new estimate is more 
sophisticated than past efforts, partly because they included a skeptic 
of global warming in the study team.<P>

"These numbers are not flaky any more. This is serious," said James 
Titus, lead author of the report, "The Probability of Sea Level Rise."<P>


While a two-foot rise isn't exactly "Waterworld," it's enough to expose 
low-lying areas such as Cape Cod to more extreme storm damage. And 
environmentalists said that the EPA's report does not rule out a more 
disastrous four-foot rise in sea level, an increase that would put 17 
percent of the town of Hull, for instance, underwater.<P>

"There really is a 1 percent chance of a very serious four- foot rise in 
sea level in 100 years," said Titus.<P>

Even a sea level rise of only two feet -- an estimate of the combined 
effects of the watersrising and the land sinking -- would have a 
significant effect on the coast. New England stands to lose about 250 
square miles of dry land and a like amount of coastal marshes, while 
major storms would bring flooding to thousands of homes that are 
currently outside  of the floodplain.<P>

The EPA report comes at a time of increasing consensus among the 
scientific community that the the Earth's temperature is rising, as 
heat-trapping carbon dioxide builds up in the atmosphere from burning 
oil, coal and other materials.<P>

A draft report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a United 
Nations scientific panel, concludes that at least part of the 1-degree 
temperature increase in the past century was caused by human activity.<P>


And the IPCC is preparing its own estimates of sea level rise, expected 
in late November, that is considerably larger than the EPA prediction. 
The UN scientists expect a 19-inch sea level rise over the next century, 
not counting the natural sinking of continents; the EPA's forecast, minus 
the sinking, attributes a 12-inch rise to global warming.<P>

Tom Wigley of the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research in 
Boulder, Colo., who is making sea level predictions for the IPCC, said 
the EPA forecast is lower than his because the agency averaged eight 
forecasts, including at least one from a forecaster who doesn't believe 
global warming is significant.<P>

"They have taken account in some way of people whose opinions are not 
highly regarded," said Wigley, who also served as a reviewer of the EPA 
study.<P>

But scientists skeptical of the importance of global warming said the EPA 
report is part of an overall retreat from dire predictions about global 
warming. Previously, EPA had predicted that sea level would rise by more 
than three feet in the next century if nothing is done to stop global 
warming.<P>

"How come we can't just write the story that the skeptics were right and 
go find some other issue?" asked Patrick Michaels of the University of 
Virginia, editor of the World Climate Report, which criticizes many 
global warming claims. <P>

Only 15 years ago, some scientists feared a global sea level rise of up 
to 25 feet in a matter of decades as the Antarctic ice sheet melted under 
the sun's glare. An exaggerated version of that scenario lies behind last 
summer's movie "Waterworld," in which the world is almost covered with 
water.<P>

The EPA study released Tuesday predicts that, far from melting, polar ice 
caps may grow thicker in the early years of global warming because of 
changes in weather patterns that cause increased precipitation at both 
poles. Instead, EPA assumes that global warming will cause sea level rise 
mainly from the expansion of ocean water as it warms. <P>

The driving force behind EPA's scaled-back prediction of sea level rise 
is that climate forecasters believe the temperature will not rise as 
swiftly as they once feared. Other pollutants, such as sulfates from 
power plants, block the sun's rays, offsetting global  warming. The EPA 
report estimates 2 degrees Celsius increase (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) by 
2100 compared to 5 degrees C (8 degrees F) once predicted.<P>

But EPA's Titus warned that global warming from the buildup of carbon 
dioxide is like a gigantic experiment that no one can control or even 
fully understand. "Our projections are less like a statistical weather 
forecast and more like handicapping a horse race," the report 
concluded.

<Title>Gonzaga Curriculum</Title> <A HREF="161.htm"><IMG

High School</H1><p> 

<p>
This history was taken out of the Gonzaga Information Booklet...

	"Gonzaga is the oldest educational institution in the old Federal City of Washington. Gonzaga College opened its doors to the young men of the Federal City in 1821. It was then located on the north side of F Street, N.W., between 9th and 10th Streets. The building's foundation stone had been laid in 1815 by Bishop Leonard Neale, auxiliary to Archbishop John Carrol, the first American bishop of the Catholic Church. Both men were originally Jesuits. The building was first intended to become a House of Novices for the Jesuits, but this plan was abandoned. After standing empty, or, according to one report, housing a small school, the Jesuits entered their building in 1820 and started a House of Philosophy for Jesuit Scholastics. In the months that followed, the Jesuits were besieged with requests from Catholics and non-Catholics alike in Washington to allow their sons into the college (which was originally under the charter of Georgetown College), not to become Jesuits, but for a good basic education. The Jesuits agreed, and the Washington Seminary, as Gonzaga was originally called, began classes for lay students in 1821.<p>

	The school flourished. On one famous occasion, President John Quincy Adams came to the Commencement and examined the boys in Latin and Greek. However, the school was a day school only. It was unendowed. The only way to pay for the running of the school was to charge tuition. This was contrary to the rules and regulations of the Society of Jesus at that time, and after much prompting from Rome, and many attempts to disguise the fact of tuition, the Seminary saw the Jesuits depart in 1827, although (as the Jesuit Catalogue for 1829 states) it was a flourishing condition.<p>

	A small school continued in the building on F Street, though there was nothing like the former splendor. The building stood next to the old St. Patrick's Church, the city's oldest Catholic parish. The rector, Fr. Matthews, was the first native born American to be ordained in America by Archbishop Carrol. He tried many times to bring the Jesuits back to the school. Even though the rules against tuition were changed in Rome in 1833, it took another 15 years before they did return. In 1848, the Seminary reopened, and was instantly successful, In 1849, President Zachary Taylor was present at the Commencement, a sure sign of good standing. <p> The school continued to operate under the charter of Georgetown College. This must have proved increasingly awkward, because in 1858 the Seminary was successful in obtaining its own Charter. Located in the District of Columbia, this meant that Congress was the only legal authority to grant such a document, and so on May 4, 1858, President James Buchanon signed into law the Act of Congress creating the "PRESIDENT AND DIRECTORS OF GONZAGA COLLEGE". The school had a new charter and a new name. But the new name was not popular. For many years after, the school was called the "Old Seminary". A copy of the Charter hangs in the Headmaster's Office. It is of interest to not that the school is indeed a College, empowered to grant degrees in the arts and the sciences. Although there were a few bachelors who graduated with degrees from Gonzaga in the last century, the higher education program at Gonzaga had died out.<p>

	In 1859, the Jesuits built and dedicated a church on North Capitol Street to St. Aloysius Gonzaga, a Jesuit saint of the 16th century, after whom the school was also named. At that time, the area in which the church was located was virtually rural. There were very few buildings in the areas, and North Capitol Street itself little better than a country lane. However, in 1871 the school left the building center of Washington, and occupied a building near the new church. It was located on Eye Street, N.W., and had been built in the 1860s as an orphanage. This is the present Kohlmann Hall, and it accounts for the strange shape of some of the classrooms. The move was nearly disastrous. There were so few people living in the area that enrollment went down precipitously, and there was a real question about the survival of the school.<p>

	However, it struggled on, housed in one small building. Kohlmann Hall originally contained the Jesuit community, including those Jesuits responsible for the church, the high school and department of higher education. Looking at the Kohlmann Hall today, one can only wonder as how they squeezed everything in.  However, squeezing is a long Gonzaga tradition. The neighborhood gradually expanded, and houses appeared where previously there had been fields. The numbers of students applying to the College increased, and by  the time of the 75th anniversary of the founding of Gonzaga, in 1896, the school was ready to expand.<p>

	The first addition to Gonzaga was the present theater, Gonzaga College Hall. It was built in the garden which stood between Kohlman Hall and the Jesuit Rectory, which had been built in 1887. It was a magnificent addition, and many a great reception and commencement has been held in there. It is one of the oldest theaters in the city, and it preserves all the scene-changing equipment which was standard in the 1890s. People from outside, including the Folger Theater, have come to inspect it, as it is a virtual museum of theater in its own right. Everything also works, as you can see during the school's musical presentations. <p>

	By the turn of the century, pressure on space must have become intolerable, and a move started to build a new school. In 1912, the present Main Building opened, amid great fanfare, with Cardinal Gibbons presiding. The facade, looking out into Eye Street ( which was a regular street, with houses on the other side until the 1970s), incorporated the old facade of the theater, so that the two buildings look one. It was the last word in modernity, and all were extremely proud of their new school. Kohlman Hall now became an adjunct building of the parish, and was not used by the school.<p>

	Thus began a long period of peace and stability for the College. The area became solidly Irish Catholic, bringing prosperity to school and parish alike. The curriculum of the school was based on the universal Jesuit plan, the "ratio studiorum." This was to be found in every Jesuit school in the world. It emphasized the classics, and followed a logical progression of studies through the years. There was very little change in curriculum from one year to the next. There were also large numbers of Jesuits who taught in the school, and lay people were relatively few. In a typical year, for example, there would be 15 to 20 Jesuit scholastics doing their regency at Gonzaga. In an age with little or no inflation, and mostly Jesuits teaching, tuition remained at less than $200 per year until 1956.<p>

	There were changes going on, however, beyond the control of the school. The Irish Catholic neighborhood began to alter its composition. The earlier generation began to move out to the suburbs, and a newer, poorer generation of non-Catholics began to move in. The fortunes of both parish and school began to change. The whirlwind hit with the city-wide riots in 1968, and fires could be seen all around the campus site. Gonzaga and St. Aloysius were untouched, however, a tribute to the esteem in which both were held by an otherwise desperate inner city population.<p>

	The first casualty of this time was the parochial grade school. Built in 1903, this closed in about 1960, and was taken over by Gonzaga and the Academy of Notre Dame. IT is our present Cantwell Hall. However, despite this sign of confidence, the enrollment to the high school began to fall, as the inner city began to be seen as undesirable by people living in the suburbs. In the early 1970s, there was serious thought being given to closing Gonzaga altogether, or at least moving to the Maryland or Virginia suburbs. Neither happened.<p>

	The Maryland Province of Jesuits declared its total commitment to Gonzaga as a school as a school serving the inner city of Washington. It sent Jesuits thereto back up its confidence in the old school. As a tangible sign of courage and determination,  the school obtained its playing field in 1973. The dilapidated housing in the block across the road from the school had been torn down, and the people who had been living there were rehoused in the Sursum Cords housing scheme two blocks north of Gonzaga. Fr. Horace McKenna was highly instrumental in that project. Indeed, there is a street named after him there. They were in better housing, and the school had a new playing field. As Coach Kozik said then, for the first time in 100 years, Gonzaga could play a home game.<p>

	The school's fortunes began to revive as the 1970s moved on. Further re-commitment to the location was seen in the construction of the Carmody Center, our new gymnasium and reception center, fulfilling a long held dream. And today, with the new Forte Hall next to Kohlman Hall, Gonzaga can state sincerely that it is heart and soul with the people of the inner city Washington. Today, the location of the school, which has threatened its existence twice in its history, is now one of the reasons for its success. Two blocks from the Metro, served by many bus lines, and close to the main railway line at Union Station, it is perhaps the most highly accessible Catholic high school in the metropolitan area. The excellence of its academic program, and the spirit of the school, fostered by a dedication and superb faculty, have consolidated Gonzaga into the most successful Catholic school in Washington. Its academic and co-curricular program, now very different from the old "ratio studiorum", seeks to respond to present day needs, and yet incorporate rigorous standards in order to prepare students for college careers. The old school has along history of triumphs and despondencies, and has come through them all the stronger for the experience. Today, as it has always tried to do, it educates "men for others", following the vision of St. Ignatious as inspired by the life and teachings of our savior, Jesus Christ."<p>

<HTML><TITLE>Is The Earth Getting Warmer</TITLE>
<H1>Is The Earth Getting Warmer?</H1>
<H4>By: Anthony Jimenez</H4>
<hr>

<H4>INTRODUCTION</H4>
<p>Is the earth getting warmer? Recent  studies  have shown  that the 
temperature  is slowly rising on our earth. The  rate  is very  slow and 
the difference can't be felt on a human timescale.  However, this may be 
causing damage to the earth.  The gigantic icecaps in the polar regions 
may be slowly melting  causing the ocean's water level to rise.  <P>

There are many articles and reports on global warming.  Each describes 
something new but the bottom line is that Planet Earth is slowly warming 
up. <P>
So I made it my mission to show that the Earth is getting warmer.  This 
project will enable people to view evidence and perhaps want to make a 
change for the better. I plan to use the internet to obtain valuable 
information for my project as well as traditional encyclopedias and other 
specialty books & magazines. <p>


<H4>HOW I DID MY PROJECT</H4><P>

 To start the project we obtained temperature files from Gonzaga College 
High School (http://www.circles org). These files had the the average 
monthly temperature from 1960 to 1989. We used four cities for this 
project, each different in location, population and climate. The four 
cities included Burnaby, British Columbia, Berkeley, California, Las 
Vegas, New Mexico and Washington D.C. <P>
When we received the data it was in text file format and we converted all 
the temperatures on to spreadsheets so later we could make graphs that 
were easier to read. Since having all the averages in intervals of months 
we condensed it to years. This gave us spreadsheets that were much more 
compact and easier to handle. Next we made graphs which showed the the 
yearly average of temperature over 30 years. We repeated this process 
four all of the cities temperature files. This gave us data which could 
be understood by more people. <P>
Then we copied all of our data to MacCurveFit. Now we made four more 
graphs which showed us the slope of the line.  This line is the best 
fitting line that will be the closest to every point. When you looked at 
these graphs it showed a positive slope in all four cases. Meaning that 
over the 30 years the temperature had risen to some extent in all four 
cities. This completed the research on our part. Our next step was to 
compare our data that our class collected to other data presented by 
other scientists who are knowledgeable in this area.<p>

<H4>OUR DATA COMPARED TO OTHER SOURCES</H4>
<p> After we finished our research we then needed to compare it to other 
reports on global warming. Like I said before there have been many 
articles and reports done on global warming so when we needed to compare 
we went to the internet to obtain information from the literature for our 
comparison.

<p>  For many years now scientists have acknowledged that global warming 
has been occurring for some time.  But the first scientist to realize 
global warming was the Swedish chemist Svante Arrhenius. In 1896 
Arrhenius  reported that all the carbon dioxide produced from the 
industrial revolution went into the atmosphere and would continue as 
along as people used more and more fossil fuels. So with higher 
concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere  the temperature would 
gradually increase as well. This was the first sign of a possible 
increasing temperature. So now we know when this problem presented itself 
in our society, we now can compare our data findings with existing 
findings.<p>

<p>  Our research suggests that the temperature is rising on our 
continent. All for cities in this project ended with varying increases in 
the average yearly temperature. This does not absolutely prove that 
global warming is occurring but it supports other findings that have been 
presented. Many knowledgeable scientists can't clearly state if our earth 
is experiencing global warming, because there isn't enough data to prove 
it yet.  Meteorologists have been only been taking accurate temperature 
readings for a mere 150 years. You can't make a judgment as big as the 
possibility of global warming on only a 150 years of data. But scientists 
are suggesting the fact of global warming, they get their facts through 
projects similar to these.<p>

<p> At a recent Conference about global warming, thirty-seven scientists 
brought their knowledge and theories to College Park, Maryland. Each 
scientist discussed his/her findings and the reasons for them. They all 
agreed that greenhouse gases are the catalyst for global warming. These 
gases our from the industrial activity throughout the world. So we can 
say the industrial revolutions in the 17th and 18th centuries were the 
inventors of global warming. These gases make it harder for the 
atmosphere to release heat into space, in turn it makes the planet 
hotter. <P>
Another fact introduced at the conference was the idea that global 
warming has not been truly global. So only certain parts of the world are 
significantly experiencing an increase in temperature. Someone else 
disscussed the notion that over the last four decades North America, 
Eurasia and some parts of Africa and Australia have experienced the most 
warming at night. So they are trying to say that at night those areas are 
the most vulnerable to increasing heat. On the other hand the islands in 
the Pacific have shown similar day and night temperature increases.<p>

<p> The bottom line is that both my data and data from other scientists 
suggest that the temperature is rising is on the earth. We need more data 
to totally conclude that global warming is happening on our planet.<p>

<H4>CONCLUSION </H4> <P>
<p> In conclusion, I now can answer the question I asked in the 
beginning: "Is the earth getting warmer?". The answer is, yes, but we 
can't say that with complete certainty. My findings support those found 
by other researchers. I only had 30 years of temperature data to work 
with, we would need many more years of data to conclude with certainty 
that the Earth is experiencing global warming. But with the help of 
advanced technology and more awareness of the issue we will be able to 
finally answer this old question in the future.<p>

<H4>GRAPHS</H4>
<p><hr><p>
<H4>BERKELEY</H4>
<img src = "">
<p>This graph shows the average yearly temperature from 1960 to 1989. At 
the start the temperature in Berkeley was roughly 13.9 degrees C. But 
thirty years later it rose to about 14.2 degrees C in 1989. But in 
earlier years the temperature nearly rose to 15 degrees C.<p>
<p><hr><p>
<img src = "">
<p> This graph is the same as above but this is called a linear 
regression. . The diagonal line is the best fitting line to all the 
temperatures on the graph. The line or the slope goes from left to right, 
upwards, this tells us the the average temperature went up nearly 1 
degree in the thirty years.<p>
<p><hr><p>
<H4>Burnaby</H4>
<img src = "">
<p>This graph shows the yearly average temperature from 1960 to 1989. 
When they took the first average in 60' it was 10.1 C and when they took 
the last one in 89' it only rose to about 10.2 C. The highest it ever 
reached was about 11 C. Out of the four cities this yielded the weakest 
results. <p>
<p><hr><p>
<img src = "">
<p>Again this line is the linear regression, the line above represents 
the best fitting line for all the temperatures plotted. The diagonal's 
angle is not very steep, this means that the average temperature didn't 
rise very much over the thirty years. In fact it rose barely two tenths 
of a degree.<p> 
<p><hr><p>
<H4>WASHINGTON D.C.</H4>
<img src="">
<p>This is the graph of yearly average temperatures for Washington D.C. 
In 1960 the average temperature was 13.6 C and when the study was over it 
rose to 13.9 C. But in 1980 it rose to nearly 16.5 C.<p>
<p><hr><p>
<img src = "">
<p>This linear regression shows that the yearly average temperature rose 
about seven tenths of a degree over the thirty years.<p>
<p><hr><p>
<H4>LAS VEGAS</H4>
<img src = "">
<p> This is the last of the four cities, this is Las Vegas, New Mexico. 
When this project started in 1960 they registered a 13.9 C average. In 
1980 the average rose to about 14.5 C. However in 1982 the average 
temperature rose to 15 C.<p>
<p><hr><p>
<img src = ">
<p>The last linear regression showed us that the best fitting line rose 
six tenths of a degree over the life of the experiment. This told us that 
Las Vegas experienced an increase in heat.

Gonzaga sports a rich science curriculum on the forefront of information 
and technology. In fact, you wouldn't be reading this right now if it 
wasn't for the Earth System Science portion of the Gonzaga Curriculum. At 
this time, Earth System Science (student reports as well as a tutrial on 
what it's about and links to other ESS sites), Chemistry and 
Physics(tutorial and links) are online. I hope to bring student-based 
reports to the Physics and Chemistry sections in the future and maybe 
even create a Biology section. <i>maybe</i>

<center><h3>Introduction to The Earth System:<p>

"What is the Earth system and how do we investigate 
it?"</h3></center>

Duration: 2 Weeks, September 5 - September 12.<P>

Objectives<br>
1st week- By the end of the first week you will come to understand <br>
<ul>
1. the Earth as a system is composed of interrelated processes 
forming a complex, dynamic whole, in which human actions play a 
significant role. (see figure)  <br>
2. issues associated with each subsystem <br>
3. issues associated with understanding the Earth through the use of 
satellite remote-sensing.<br>
4. the international effort to understand the Earth system.</ul><P>

2nd week- By the end of the second week you will come to understand 
<br>
<ul>
1. our Earth System Science Community and the people and 
resources you can call upon to support your investigations of the 
Earth system. <br>
2. Earth System Science as a team-based collaborative research 
effort, modeled on the activity of scientists working on the same 
issues using the same tools, data and resources.<br>
3. the Internet as means of accomplishing this collaborative 
research,<br>
4. Internet applications as the tools of the trade used for 
communication, collaboration and information exchange: E-mail, 
and the WorldWideWeb.<br>
5. the significance of "netiquette" and of authoring on the web by 
creating a simple, one page autobiographical html 
document.</ul><p>

Resources <br>
<ul>
1. <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/mtpe/mtpe.html">
"NASA's Mission to Planet Earth: Earth Observing System"</a>

<center><h3>Teacher's Guide for 
Introduction to The Earth System:<P>

"What is the Earth system and how do we investigate 
it?"</h3></center>

<b>Duration</b>: 2 Weeks, September 5 - September 12.<P>

<b>Objectives<br>
1st week-</b> Students will realize that the Earth consists of a set of 
interrelated processes forming a complex, dynamic whole, in which human 
actions play a significant role. Students should understand:<br>
<ul>1. the Earth as a system composed of interacting subsystems <a 
href="201.htm">(see figure)</a><br>
2. issues associated with each subsystem <br>
3. issues associated with understanding the Earth through the use of 
satellite remote-sensing.<br>
4. the international effort to understand the Earth system.</ul><p>

<b>2nd week-</b> Students will understand the overview of the ESS 
course content and methods, the purpose of our ESS Community, our use 
of the Internet, and the people and resources they can call upon to 
support 
their investigations of the Earth system. Students should understand:</b>

<ul>1. ESS as a team-based collaborative research effort, modeled 
on the activity of scientists working on the same issues using the 
same tools, data and resources.<br>
2. the Internet as means of accomplishing this collaborative 
research,<br>
3. Internet applications as the tools of the trade used for 
communication, collaboration and information exchange: E-mail, 
and the WorldWideWeb (using products like Netscape).<br>
4. the significance of authoring on the web.  They should end the 
week by creating a simple, one page html document about themselves 
and their ESS class.</ul><p>

<b>Suggested Outline<br>
First week-</b> Begin with an overview of the Earth as a system  
Introduce the topic to them by using "NASA's Mission to Planet Earth: 
Earth Observing System".  This is an excellent piece of work, a brief (16 

pages) and substantive introduction to the main issues of Mission to 
Planet 
Earth.  There are many discussions about global change issues and details 

on how NASA is working with other government agencies, both nationally 
and internationally, to understand these issues. Use the following 
resources.<br>
<ul>1. The set of study questions based on this text to help focus the 
students.<P>
 2. The MTPE homepage (http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/mtpe/) 
Browse this information-rich homepage.  Check out different Earth 
observing missions and easy-to-show climate data visualizations. On 
the Data page of the MTPE server, the "Live Access to Climate 
Data" link provides quick and easy access to a good selection of data 
parameters.  <P>
3. The EOS homepage 
(http://spso2.gsfc.nasa.gov/spso_homepage.html) has some of the 122 
slides and captions of the Educator's Visualization Material collection 
(obtainable in hardcopy from NASA-CORE). The slides are under 
the Education link of the EOS homepage.<P>
4. Videos, such as the Blue Planet or the EOS video are good 
introductions.</ul><p>

<b>2nd week-</b> Familiarize your students with the ESS Community. 
Let them know that they are on the forefront of education because of 
their 
use of technology to communicate, collaborate and conduct research.  
Direct your students on a tour of the ESSC server, if you have Web access 

by then.  If not, emphasize that students and teachers will be working as 

TEAMS and individually. Explain that students in other ESSC classes 
around the country are involved in this program and teams from different 

schools will have the opportunity to work together over the Internet... 
just 
as teams of scientists do.  Introduce your students to Internet culture. 
Get 
them started using the Web and e-mail.  Guide them through the basic 
etiquette of composing and sending email message. Work with parents and 
administrators to address the issue of appropriate use, and consider 
using a 
contract with students and parents.  We have emailed a sample document 
for this purpose.  Please feel free to adapt this sample document to your 

needs and purposes.  It is important that students, parents and teachers 

recognize the responsibilities that go along with having an Internet 
account.  
Use the following resources to this end.  <p>
<ul>
1. A brief guide to e-mail,<br> 
http://www.webfoot.com/advice/email.top.html),<P>
2. The netiquette homepage includes brief entries on email and other
matters.(http://rs6000.adm.fau.edu/rinaldi/net/user.html)<P>
3. If your classroom technology is ready,  use the Web to view some
examples of weather and climate satellite imagery from our server.  
<P>
4. Acceptable use contract.</ul><P>

<center><h3>TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE OF INTERNET</h3></center>

Please read the following carefully before signing this document.  This 
is a legally binding 
document.<P>

<a 
href="gopher://gopher.circles.org/00/curric/Intro/terms_conditions.txt">For 
a text only page</a><p>

Internet access is now available to 
___________________________________(User name) 
at YOUR HIGH SCHOOL (YHS).  The access is being offered by (Your Internet  

Provider). We are very pleased to bring this access to YHS and believe 
the Internet offers 
vast, diverse and unique resources to both students and teachers.  Our 
goal in providing 
this service to teachers is to promote educational excellence by 
facilitating resource sharing, 
innovation and communication.<P>

The Internet is an electronic highway connecting thousands of computers 
all over the world 
and millions of individual subscribers.  Students have access to:<P>
<ul>
1.  Electronic mail communication with people all over the world.<br>
2.  Information and news from NASA as well as the opportunity to 
correspond 
with the scientists at NASA and other research institutions.<br>
3.  Public domain and shareware of all types.<br>
4.  Discussion groups on a plethora of topics ranging from Chinese 
culture to 
the environment to music to politics.<br>
5.  Access to many University Library Catalogs, the Library of Congress, 

CARL and ERIC.</ul><p>

With access to computers and people all over the world also comes the 
availability of 
material that may not be considered to be of educational value in the 
context of the school 
setting.  However, on a global network it is impossible to control all 
materials and an 
industrious user may discover controversial information.  We, YHS and 
(YOUR 
INTERNET  PROVIDER, firmly believe that the valuable information and 
interaction 
available on this worldwide network far outweighs the possibility that 
users may procure 
material that is not consistent with the educational goals of this 
Program.<P>

Internet access is coordinated through a complex association of 
government agencies, and 
regional and state networks.  In addition, the smooth operation of the 
network relies upon 
the proper conduct of the end users who must adhere to strict guidelines.  
These guidelines 
are provided here so that you are aware of the responsibilities you are 
about to acquire.  In 
general this requires efficient, ethical and legal utilization of the 
network resources.  If a 
YHS user violates any of these provisions, his or her account will be 
terminated and future 
access could possibly be denied.  The signature(s) at the end of this 
document is (are) 
legally binding and indicates the party (parties) who signed has (have) 
read the terms and 
conditions carefully and understand(s) their significance.<P>

<dd> <li>  Manipulate and plot data using a spreadsheet program<br>
<dd> <LI>  Use STELLA to model a simple system.<br>
<dd> <li>  Create a simple www page using HTML Editor to report your 
findings<br>

<dd> <li>  The graphical presentation of data<br>
<dd> <li>  The Earth-Sun relation and why we have seasons<br>
<dd><li>  The relation of radiation to temperature (Stefan-Boltzmann 
law)<br>
<dd><li> Heat capacity and the physics of heat storage.<br>
<dd><li> Basics of remote sensing instruments and satellites<P>

<b>Background</b><br>
<dd>	Why do we have seasons? Why do north and south hemispheres have 
opposite seasons at the same time?  Why is the Earth hot at the equator 
and cold at the poles?  How does the Sun "drive" the oceans, atmosphere 
and life on Earth?  We begin our scientific study of the Earth as a 
system with these questions.<br>
<dd>	Consider the Earth as it appears from space in its annual journey 
round the Sun, holding the Moon fast in its orbit.  The Moon exerts its 
gravitational attraction to move the world's oceans, in daily and 
seasonal tides.  The Sun's gravity shapes Earth's orbit, but beyond that 

the Sun immerses the whole planet in a powerful stream of electromagnetic 

radiation.  A small fraction of this radiant flux is captured by the 
ocean, the atmosphere and the solid earth.  A tiny fraction of the 
radiant energy feeds all life on the planet via photosynthesis.  All 
energy systems on the Earth surface are thus driven by the Sun. (Beneath 

the Earth's crust all dynamic processes are driven by the a core of 
molten iron.)<br>  
<dd>	You will examine the distribution of temperature on the planet 
surface.  Temperature determines the flow of radiant energy, as well as 
influencing a variety of other atmospheric and oceanic processes.  The 
recent consensus of scientist worldwide is that the global warming is a 
reality.  In this project you will examine the global evidence of an 
increase of average annual temperatures and compare it with data from 
local sources. <P>

<b>ABSTRACT:</b>   There has been growing concern and debate about increases in average global temperature, over the last 15 years, among 
international scientific and governmental organizations.  In this 
project, we need to identify the sources of temperature on the Earth, and 
the factors involved in its variation and distribution.  Distinguish 
carefully between facts and hypotheses, and propose ways to test your 
hypotheses. Working with your colleagues is critical and cooperation 
between teams is encouraged. Pursuing the line of inquiry described below 
is the minimal requirement.  Conclude your research with a report of your 
findings. Your report will include: 
<UL>
<LI> A statement of your research question or hypothesis, and an 
explanation of your research strategy.
<LI> A presentation of thematic background information. 
<LI> A quantitative STELLA model of the sources, sinks and flows of 
radiant and thermal energy in the Earth system, which accounts for the 
factors identified by your research question.
<LI> Visualizations of relevant data from NASA and other archives, using 
Spyglass Transform, and spreadsheets..
<LI> A discussion of your findings, their limits and directions for 
further research.
<LI> Citation of all electronic and bibliographical sources.
<LI> Daily and weekly entries in the team's electronic log.
</UL><P>

<B>EVALUATION:</b>  Your grade will be assigned on the basis of 
assignments, quizes, and tests; preliminary report; finished oral and 
hypermedia reports, and team performance, as described in the <a 
href="17.htm">syllabus</a><P>

<B>PROCESS of INQUIRY:</b> Steps involved in the <a 
href="210.htm">process</a> are 
outlined<P>

<B>PROCESS: </B><BR>
<B>Information Gathering:</b> Beginning with the items named in to the 
resource section above, use books and articles in the lab and library, 
and Internet search tools (WWW browsers, Archie, WAIS and Gopher) to 
conduct a search for current information about the Earth's energy 
balance. Read and discuss the information.  <I>In your <a 
href="52.htm">final 
report</a> make at least four links to related references on the World 
Wide Web, ands appropriate references to books and articles.</I><P>

<B>Hypothesis:</b>  With your team, investigate the relationships between 
key factors in the Earth energy balance and suggest a hypothesis or 
research program in order to explain and understand the most significant 
of these.  <I>You must cite sources which support your hypothesis. 
Hypotheses must be submitted for review in a <a 
href="211.htm">preliminary report</a>  by the beginning of the third 
week of this project.</I><P>

<B>Qualitative Modeling:</b>  Create a non-mathematical STELLA model of 
your hypothesis which includes important features of phenomena under 
investigation, and clearly shows  interrelations between these features.  
This model must be based on facts gleaned from your readings. <I>In the 
comments  box of each component of your model, include a brief 
description and bibliographical reference to the source of that 
information.Present your qualitative model as part of your <a 
href="211.htm">preliminary 
report</a>.</I><P>
	
<B>Data Selection:</b>  What data do you need to test your hypothesis? 
Use <a href="56.htm">ESSC 
Visual Data Browser</a> to examine datasets from NASA's Earth Radiation 
Budget Experiment (ERBE) to select data.  Use <a 
href="23.htm">ESSC Data Order 
form</a>, together with <a 
href="http://eosdis.larc.nasa.gov:12000/dataset_documents/erbe.html">data 
archives</a>, to order data which may be relevant to supporting your 
hypothesis. <P>
	
<B>Data Visualization and Analysis:</b>  As a team, collaboratively 
examine relevant data using Spyglass Transform visualization software.  
Adjust or create palettes to improve the visual representation of the 
data. Add comments and observations derived from visualizing the data; 
suggest refinements to the model <P>

<B>Quantitative Modeling:</B>  On the basis of your qualitative model 
build a quantitative model using STELLA modeling software.  Construct a 
quantitative model using Arthur Few's basic model of the Earth energy 
balance as a foundation  Enhance this model with information from your 
data visualization products, and information you have gathered in your 
literature search research. <I>Your team should use this empirical 
evidence to test the hypothesis and refine your model.  State the limits 
of your model's reliability.  Note explicitly the boundaries of your 
understanding of energy balance and temperature and state what other 
information, not included in your model, is relevant to the study of 
surface temperature. </i><P>
	
<B>Communication:</b>  <I>(1) Present your findings orally</I>, using 
your data, data products (graphics, visualizations, animations and text) 
on the ESSC website. Hotlink relevant terms and passages to your STELLA 
model, Collage images, QuickTime movies, and any secondary sources you 
found valuable in the course of your research on the Internet. (2) 
<I>Write a <a 
href="52.htm">report</a>  of no more than six double-spaced typed pages explaining your 
investigation and its significance. Cite all sources and 
references.</I><P>

<B>Refine, Design:</B>  Examine the findings of other teams, suggest any 
useful 
modifications to the investigations. Review and evaluate your teams 
project plan, strategy, changes, and problems in the manager's report and 
presentation.<P>

Geosphere
</h1>

The Geosphere is the outer shell of the earth.  It includes the 
continents, ocean bottoms, the Earth's crust, and processes which form 
volcanoes and earthquakes.  The earth is made up of a series of layers.  
At the surface of the Earth is the thin outermost layer known as the 
crust.  The continental crust is made up of granite, and the crust 
beneath the ocean is made of blackish rocks called basalt.  Plant life 
can only grow on the crust because the rest of the earth is rock and 
liquid.  Although the crust is made up of rocks, layers of soil cover the 
top providing growth for plant life.
<p>
The layer beneath the earth's crust is called the mantle.  The mantle 
makes up about 83% of the earth's volume.  Just below the mantle is the 
core, which is the central region of the Earth.  The core is made up of a 
liquid outer area and a solid inner core.  It is believed to be very 
dense and made up of mainly iron and some nickel.
<p>
The Earth's crust is made up of 8 large plates with about 20 smaller ones 
lodged between them. (Bramwell, 74)  When these plates move or slide past 
one another, this often causes earthquakes along the plate lines.  These 
plate boundaries are marked on the map according to the locations of the 
earthquakes.
<p>
This sphere relates to the atomosphere in that a change in the position 
of jet streams, ocean currents, and sea level could reflect the rotation 
speed of the Earth.  The ocean bottoms of the hydrosphere are a part of 
the land formations.  The way that we treat the oceans and other bodies 
of water can affect the land.  By polluting our oceans, we are killing 
the fish population.  The soil and vegetation of the biosphere is a part 
of the land.  The plants we grow and techniques we use in treating the 
land can change the way the land moves.  (Bergman, 1)
<p>
NASA has used laser beams in outer space to measure the movement of 
tectonic plates during the Apollo missions.  These measurements can be 
used to calculate how fast continents are moving toward or away from each 
other.  Currently, measurements have shown that the Atlantic Ocean is 
widening by about 1.4 cm per year.  (Levin, 166)  In 1998, the EOS-AM 
Series, will measure the surface temperature of land and ocean morning 
crossing.  In 2000, the EOS-PM Series, will measure the surface 
temperature of the land and ocean afternoon crossing.  In 2002, the 
EOS-Altimetry Series, will measure the land surface elevation.  (NASA)
<p>
Human impacts on the earth are most seen in changes that happen to the 
land.  As our populations are continuously increasing, we have changed 
the land to grow food and raise animals.  We have cut down trees for 
their wood, and built more cities, roads, canals, and dams.  (NASA, 7)  
People need to be more educated about our Earth, and the damage they can 
cause it.
<p>
We should study this sphere because the more we know about it, the more 
natural disasters we can predict.  As we learn about  volcanoes and 
earthquakes, we can save more lives.  People should be aware of how the 
land moves and works.  This could prevent danger from occurring.  It is 
important that the government make laws to protect the geosphere.  These 
laws are most needed in the case of earthquakes.  Codes are set on 
buildings, roads, bridges, and other things that people come in contact 
with on an everyday basis.  By closing down an old bridge, a person's 
life can be saved during an earthquake.  Even the simple things done to 
protect our land can really make a difference.

<h1> 
Hydrosphere
</h1>
<p>
	The hydrosphere consists of oceans,  lakes,  rivers and,  subterranean 
waters.  After the Earth was formed,  water vapor in the atmosphere 
condensed to form this sphere(Curtis 14).  It is mostly in basins of 
lakes and oceans where it has an average depth of two miles.  The oceans 
account for about 97% of the volume of the hydrosphere.  The hydrosphere 
also includes waters that are combined with minor contributions such as,  
salt,  soil runoff and groundwaters.  Water circulation and rain falling 
on the earth can result in weathering of landmasses by acting as an 
erosive agent before returning to the sea.  The circulation of water and 
mineral particles is a unique process driven by the energy from the sun 
and from the interior of the Earth.  The introduction of materials by 
humans has significantly changed the make-up and environmental properties 
of natural waters.  
<p>	
	The hydrosphere has many important functions.  Water is essential for 
all living things.  An adequate supply is the key factor for urban, 
agricultural, and industrial development.  Rivers and streams have been 
used by many humans, since the earliest history, as a place to discard 
wastes and as a vehicle for transportation of goods.
<p>
	Water is necessary for nourishment,  washing,  irrigation,  and drinking 
(Groves 116).  The introduction of foreign materials by humans has 
significantly changed the make-up and environmental properties of natural 
waters.  When water is full of pollutants it may be considered a 
destructive agent causing death and great damage.
<p>
	The hydropshere has many relations among the other spheres.  If the ice 
caps of polar regions in the cryosphere thawed out there would be a rise 
of the sea level of 60 meters.  Changes in the distribution of water 
masses lead to droughts and floods(Popular Science 433).  There are 
pressure and temperature changes at different depths in the hydrosphere 
just like the atmosphere(McGraw-Hill 615).  This would create and 
atmosphere that would either be to high of a altitude for people to live 
in or to low.  
<p>
	NASA is currently collecting data via satellite about the hydrosphere.  
One satellite,  TOPEX/Poseidon,  is an ocean topography experiment.   It 
will help weather forecasting by predicting general weather trends,  
which in turn could adjust crop selection (NASA Facts-TOPEX/Poseidon).  
The second satellite is called Sea(WIFS).  The goal of this satellite is 
to study primary production and interactions between living and 
non-living components of the ocean.  It will observe the world's ocean 
from space to measure "ocean color."
Ocean color varies with the concentration of phytoplankton.  The amount 
of phytoplankton is an important factor.  This system will process and 
distribute data,  about information on a large part of the global carbon 
cycle (NASA Facts-SeaWIFS).
<p>
	As the world becomes more heavily populated the demands on this resource 
continue to increase.  Laws which prohibit pollution (chemicals) and 
dumping (household wastes) should be strongly enforced.  An example of an 
occurrence that violated the law was the Exxon oil spill.  The spill 
killed a lot of plant and marine life,  destroying the ecosystem of the 
Alaskan region,  as pictured to our left.  Even though these laws exist 
there continues to be violations keeping the waters murky and polluted,  
disrupting natural ecosystems in waters.
<p>
	Humans tend to use water as a waste dump which destroys the rich 
minerals at the bottom of the sea.  Acid rain is produced which is 
collected in the rivers,  streams and oceans.  The continual rise of  
greenhouse gases is causing the overflow of the seas.  Controlling the 
amount of factory wastes would  help this sphere.  It would limit the 
amount of chemicals that go into the rivers and destroy the ecosystems.

Missouri Water
</h1>

	Ground water is stored in the earth's surface in saturated rock, sand, 
gravel, and soil.  This is similar to how water fills a sponge.  Ground 
water provides one-third of Missouri's water needs and resources.  This 
pertains mainly to the rural areas.  A major characteristic of Missouri 
ground water is its diversity.  The ground water moves very quickly in 
southern Missouri, but extremely slow in the northern and western regions 
of the state.
<p>
<h6> 
<IMG SRC="" align=middle>
There are six ground water regions in Missouri. 
</h6>
<ul>
<li>The Ozark Mountain region generally has very good ground water.  Half 
of southern Missouri gets water from here.  This region gives plentiful 
amounts of water.  
<li>St. Francois Mountain region is not very plentiful in ground water 
production.  Only small amounts can be used domestically.
<li>The ground water in the Osage-Salt Plains region is highly 
mineralized and of poor quality.  
<li>The Glaciated Plains are located in Northern Missouri.  This region 
yields small amounts of ground water that are very mineralized.  It is 
also not usually safe enough for domestic use.
<li>The Missouri-Meramec-Mississippi River Valley is very plentiful in 
ground water.  Ground water is near the surface, making it easy to be 
pumped quickly for use. 
<li>The Southeastern Lowlands, or the Bootheel, has generally good water, 
depending on aquifers.  It is very similar to the 
Missouri-Meramec-Mississippi River Valley region.
</ul>
<p>
	There are numerous problems with the ground water in Missouri.  Most of 
the problems are not strictly related to Missouri, but the national 
ground water problem.  Some self-explanatory problems are spills and 
leaks, hazardous waste, and solid waste landfills.  Some more hidden 
problems are quantity, which is when the industries and factories waste 
away and use large amounts of unnecessary water.   Agriculture can be a 
problem because of chemicals and fertilizers.  Wells, storage tanks, and 
septic tanks can be harmful to Missouri ground water if they are not 
properly installed.
<p>
	The answer to keeping Missouri's fresh-water supply in abundance is 
preventing the contaminants from entering the ground water in the first 
place.  To help prevent this, measures such as determining ground-water 
quality standards and establishing protective regulations such as the 
Water Well Driller's Act which places standards on construction of new 
wells.  Citizen participation is also important.  Proper management and 
disposal of wastes is the key.

<h1> 
Ozone
</h1>

<a href="http://icair.iac.org.nz/">Ozone </a> is a form of Oxygen in which 
three atoms combine to form a molecule, instead of the usual diatomic 
form of Oxygen.  The atmosphere's ozone layer,also known as the 
Ozonosphere, is a layer of the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere 
about 20 to 25 Km above the Earth's surface.  It helps protect life on 
Earth from harmful effects of UltraViolet radiation coming from the sun. 
(Fishman 2) 
<p> 
The "so-called" ozone hole has been studied extensively, and it turns out 
to be a special combination of clouds, extremely cold temperatures, 
chlorine from Chlorofluorocarbons (CFC's), and sunlight, all contained in 
a vortex, and it only exists for just a few months each year. (P.B. 152)
<p>
Certain chemicals used in indutrial processes appear to be the cause of 
the depletion of the ozone layer.  CFC's are in this category.  Composed 
of chlorine, fluorine,and carbon atoms, these stable chemicalls have 
found use as solvents, cleaners, refrigerants, and spray propellants.  
Because of their stability, when they are released  they persist, some 
for centuries.  This allows them to rise into the stratosphere where they 
spread around the world by high winds.
<p>
In the Stratosphere, UV radiation can bread down CFC molecules, freeing 
the chlorine atoms.  Each free chlorine atom can then attack an ozone 
molecule, breaking it apart and creating a chlorine monoxide and an 
oxygen molecule.  The chlorine monoxide molecule then breaks down, 
releasing the chlorine atom to repeat the process again and again.  It's 
estimated that a single chlorine atom, going through this reaction, can 
destroy as many as 100,000 ozone molecules.
<p>
CFC's aren't the only chemicals that destroy ozone.  Any compound that 
has an atmospheric lifetime long enough for it to migrate to the 
stratosphere where it can release hydrogen, hydroxide, nitric oxide, 
chlorine monoxide, chlorine, bromine, or bromine monoxide is under 
investigation. (Dow 7)
<p>
Chlorine Nitrate, a natural atmospheric compund, accounts for a greater 
proportion of ozone depletion than previously reconginized.  It forms 
over the polar regions during winter, then drifts toward the equator, 
where it destroys ozone slowly over a wide area.  This cycle is slower 
than other depletion cycles but its potential influence is far ranging. 
(Lipkin 167)
<p>
In 1992 and early 1993, ozone reached record low levels.  Scientists 
attribute this sudden loss to droplets of volcanic sulfuric acid created 
by the eruption of Mt. Pinatubo in the Philippines in 1991.  When a 
volcanic eruption occurs, different types of debris are spewed into the 
air.  Among the debris is sulphur dioxide which combines with water vapor 
to form sulphuric acid which can remain in the atmosphere for several 
years after an eruption.  This acid may convert the chlorine from CFC's 
into an active form that destroys ozone. (Horgan 28) Evidence shows that 
the eruption debris is accelerating the erosion of stratospheric ozone 
not only in Antarctica, but also in tropical areas.  In Spring 1992, the 
<a href="http://budman.cmdl.noaa.gov/jlhp.htm">National Oceanic and 
Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) </a> suggested that the Pinatubo debris 
could trigger ozone losses of more than 30 percent inthe midlatitudes.
<p>
If data is correct, regions such as the United States and Europe could 
receive twice as much UV radiation than usual.  Such increaases could 
siginificantly impact the health of many living organisms. (28) It would 
raise the incidence of human skin cancers and catarcts, as well as reduce 
food production.  Findings also show that it may upset the fragile 
balance of entire ecosystems and have a negative impact on marine life 
growth. ( Svitil 75)
<p>
In 1989, the hypothesis that debris from volcanic eruptions could destroy 
ozone was formulated.  Most ozone loss is believed to come from 
chlorine-catalyzed reactions occurring on ice crystal surfaces found in 
polar stratospheric clouds.  NOAA scientists debated that sulphur-based 
particles released by volcanoes would create, in effect, temporary polar 
stratospheric clouds.  Scientists supported this with data from the 1982 
eruption of El Chichon in Mexico.  This data shows that ozone levels in 
the Northern Hemisphere dropped by 10 percent during the year following 
the eruption.  Similar data was found from the 1991 eruption of Mt. 
Hudson in Chile.  After Pinatubo erupted, scientists thought it could 
cause more ozone depletion in the middle and upper latitudes.
<p>
According to available data, their predictions were understated.  The 
eruption of Pinatubo has been the largest of the twentieth century.  The 
volcano spewed 20 million tons of sulphur dioxide, three times as much as 
El Chichon.  It created a cloud as large as all the stratospheric clouds 
at both the north and south poles.
<p>
The most "dramatic" results come from the Microwave Limb Sounder on 
NASA's Upper Atmosphere Statellite, which was launched in Autumn 1991.  
The MLS measured ozone levels in the trropics ten percent lower than ever 
before.  It showed ozone-poor air reaching throughout the middle and high 
latitudes, a reversal of the usual course of ozone depletion.
<p>
Baloon measurements support this data.  In Autumn 1991, balloons floating 
above Hawaii by NOAA detected low ozone within the Pinatubo debris cloud.  
Another balloon over Boulder, Colorado recorded the lowest ozone levels 
ever.  Balloons over northern Canada detected extreme dips in ozone in 
connection with sulfate particles that were "certainly" from the Pinatubo 
eruption, says the Canadian Atmospheric Environment Service.
<p>
Surprisingly, the debris cloud from Pinatubo was expected to cool the 
Earth for the next couple years by preventing infrared radiation and 
visible sunlight from getting through the atmosphere.  However, 
scientists say that the cloud doesn't block out enough ultraviolet 
radiation to counteract its ozone-depleting effects. (Horgan 29)
<p>
The link between volcanoes and ozone depletion remains under 
investigation.  Phase out of CFC's has begun.  However, the ozone hole 
won't begin to shrink until at least 2030.  At that point the chlorine 
atoms that normally circulate into the lower atmosphere will no longer be 
replaced by chlorine from incoming CFC's.  However, chlorine levels would 
continue to rise for another twenty or thirty years.  This means the next 
large volcanic eruption could destroy even more ozone.  Also, there are 
still other chemicals that are  ozone destroyers and volcano control is 
somewhat farther off.<P>

<B>Deforestation in Brazil</B><br>
  
This deforestation series shows the same geographic region in Rondonia as 
imaged by three different instruments-from left to right, the Advanced 
Very High-Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR), the Landsat Thematic Mapper 
(TM), and the Systeme pour l'Observation de la Terre (SPOT), 
High-Resolution Visible (HRV) sensor. The AVHRR image was taken in 1988, 
and shows hot areas where the rain forest has been slashed and burned; 
the fishbone designs indicate the pattern of clearing typical of small 
farm holdings. Violets (where the temperatures are not so extreme) show 
the unmolested rainforest. The Landsat TM image is composed of five 
interweaved scenes. In both, the Madeira River occupies the upper 
lefthand corner of the frame. The SPOT image offers much higher 
resolution (i.e., ~20 m), showing particular clearings.  Forest cover is 
red, semi-cleared areas green, and bare soil white.  The accompanying 
photograph (see home page) provides an actual ground shot of a burned out 
area of forest (one of the green areas in the SPOT HRV product) In recent 
years, the Brazilian government has sought to mitigate the rectilinear 
development revealed in these images by instituting serpentine road and 
clearing projects. Satellite imagery provided by (from left to right):

Seasonal cycles of vegetation in the temperate and high latitudes are 
strikingly captured in these two false-colour Normalized Difference 
Vegetation Index (NDVI) images.  The top composite shows vegetation 
growth during January and February 1987, and the bottom July and August 
of the same year. The colours indicate density, ranging from dark Green 
for lush vegetation to gray for desolate regions. Areas without data are 
indicated in white. Longterm collection of such data sets allows 
researchers to establish trends and to determine changes in global 
climate and agricultural practices. These NDVI products were assembled 
from data collected by the Advanced Very High-Resolution Radiometer

<H3>INTRODUCTION</H3>
<IMG SRC="" ALIGN=left VSPACE=20 HSPACE=20><P>

Space exploration has changed the way we view the Earth. Photographs from
space show the limits of a world dominated by water and shielded from
space by a thin layer of atmosphere. From this perspective, we see the
Earth as a whole-the land, oceans, and atmosphere that provide our
life-supporting environment.<P>

Observations from space have provided extensive global views that allow us
to study the Earth as a unified system. This systematic approach to Earth
science will help us understand how local activities might produce effects
on a worldwide or global scale. The goal is to understand relationships
among atmosphere, land, and ocean processes on scales that range from
chemical reactions to global climate change. To do this, Earth science
needs an interdisciplinary approach that combines the classical
disciplines of physics, chemistry, and biology.<P>

Global studies require new and different tools. NASA will contribute to
this effort through its Mission to Planet Earth (MTPE), which began in
1991 as a part of the U.S. Global Change Research Program. The MTPE
focuses NASA's experience in planetary and space research on studies of
the Earth. The central element in MTPE is the Earth Observing System
(EOS). The EOS has three components: a series of Earth observing
satellites, an advanced computing system, and teams of scientists.<P>

The objectives of the EOS are to:<P>
<ul>
<li> Establish an integrated, sustained, and comprehensive program to observe
the Earth on a global scale;<br>

<li> Conduct focused and exploratory studies to improve understanding of the
physical, chemical, biological, and social processes that influence the
Earth's climate;<br>

<li> Develop models of the Earth system to integrate and predict climate 
changes;<br>

<li> and Assess impacts of natural events and human activities on the Earth's
climate.</ul><p>
 
The overriding goal of the EOS is to establish the scientific basis for
informed policy decisions related to our influence on the global
environment.<p>
 
Scientists have known of and studied for decades many of the scientific
issues described in the following sections. What is different is the
challenge of unifying these studies to produce an understanding of the
Earth as a single system. The EOS is the most ambitious single project
dedicated to Earth system science and global climate change research. 
Building on existing and near-term missions, the EOS is supporting
scientific studies and improving access to existing data that yield
valuable information about the Earth and its climate system. In 1998, EOS
leadership in climate change research will grow considerably by beginning
a 15-year series of consistent, high-quality, global observations.<P>


<b>UNDERSTANDING THE EARTH SYSTEM</b><p>

A great need exists for information that can help us evaluate our options 
to sustain the environmental
conditions that have nurtured life on Earth. Mission to Planet Earth and 
the EOS will supply
information needed to understand and predict climate changes from both 
natural and human causes.
This information will allow for policy decisions that balance human needs 
and desires with protection
of the Earth's environment.<p>

Global change research will have practical benefits and will allow us to 
leave a legacy of responsibility.
The practical benefits will include improvements in our ability to 
forecast climate, manage natural
resources, protect public health, and plan for crops, forests, fisheries, 
wildlife, and human needs. The
EOS will offer one means of fulfilling our moral and civic 
responsibilities as stewards of our home
planet to future generations.<p>

<H3>THE EARTH OBSERVING SYSTEM: HOW NASA WILL SUPPORT STUDIES OF GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE</H3>

The EOS supports three main activities: scientific investigation,
space-based observation, and data management. Planning and building the
technical and human resources for the EOS require close collaboration
among engineers, computer scientists, and Earth scientists. The first
pieces of the EOS were established in 1990 with the selection of proposals
to form science teams and develop instruments. In 1991, the EOS Data and
Information System (EOSDIS) began building on a base of selected Earth
science data centers.<P>

Thus the EOS is well underway. EOS science investigations are making
significant contributions to our knowledge of the Earth and its climate
system, today. Individually and as teams, these scientists are forging
interdisciplinary collaborations and training the next generation of Earth
system scientists. The scientific investigators and general Earth science
community currently make use of new facilities and improved access to
existing data provided by the EOSDIS. While the first EOS satellite will
not launch before 1998, instrument development efforts have produced
simulator instruments for testing from aircraft. Data from these
simulators are used to support current EOS science investigations and to
develop new uses for the unique types and quality of satellite data that
the EOS will provide.<P>

<title>The Troposhpere: Greenhouse Gases</title>
</HEAD>
<BODY>

<A HREF="144.map">

<H3>THE TROPOSPHERE: GREENHOUSE GASES</H3>




	Scenarios for global warming rely primarily on the predicted increase in 
the "greenhouse effect" resulting from certain gases accumulating in the 
atmosphere because of human activities. Greenhouse gases include natural 
amounts of water vapor, carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous 
oxide (N20), and ozone. As the name greenhouse implies, the layer of 
atmosphere closest to Earth, the troposphere (from the surface to about 
11 km), is the area in which greenhouse gases, dust, and clouds influence 
retention and transformation of solar energy.<P>

Natural cycles in the atmosphere, land, and ocean, as well as human 
activities, determine amounts of greenhouse gases in the troposphere.<P>
	Rapid growth in industry and agriculture during the past century 
contributed to unprecedented accumulations of certain greenhouse gases, 
including CO2, CH4, N2O, and chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). Computer models 
predict that if this buildup continues, temperatures could rise as much 
during the next century as during the 18,000 years since the lust ice 
age. A climate change of this magnitude and speed could shift patterns of 
rainfall, winds, ocean currents, and regional weather, such as droughts 
and floods. Global warming could warm the ocean, and cause polar ice caps 
to melt. Sea levels would then rise, threatening coastal areas. History 
gives us few examples of the ability of humans and nature to adapt to 
such rapid change.<P>

<IMG SRC="" ALIGN=left VSPACE=20 HSPACE=20><P>
SAGE II-Derived water vapor: Total water vapor between approximately 9 
km and 16 km in the atmosphere during the northern summer (June through August, 1986-1988).<P>


	Scientists have identified some sources, sinks, and atmospheric 
transformations of greenhouse gases. By burning fossil fuels, we have 
introduced to the atmosphere large quantities of CO2 that were formerly 
stored underground as oil, coals and natural gas. Human production of CO2 
and CFCs is relatively well-known, and scientists have identified 
industrial and agricultural sources for CH4 and N2O. But many sources and 
sinks for greenhouse gases depend on natural cycles that are poorly 
understood. For example, useful estimates of amounts of CO2 absorbed and 
released by land vegetation and oceans will require better understanding 
of biological activity and air-sea exchange.<P>
	The most significant and variable greenhouse gas is water vapor. 
Uncertainties about water cycle processes, such as evaporation and 
rainfall, limit our ability to predict long-term greenhouse effects. For 
example, it is not clear whether changes in the water cycle will speed up 
global warming by increasing water vapor concentrations, or counteract 
the greenhouse effect by screening the Earth with clouds.<P>
	The troposphere ploys a critical role as a site for chemical reactions 
that determine the fate of greenhouse gases and other chemicals. Chemical 
oxidation in the troposphere limits the lifetime of many gases, such as 
methane. Chemical transformations in the troposphere also are critical to 
determine types and quantities of pollutants that will reach the 
stratosphere and contribute to reducing Earth's protective ozone 
layer.<P>
	Remote sensing by the EOS will measure all major greenhouse gases and 
many constituents involved in tropospheric chemistry. The EOS satellites 
will measure aerosols, water vapor, clouds, radiation, winds, and 
biological activity in the oceans and over the land. Integrating complex 
interactions among chemical, physical, biological, and human factors also 
will require field and laboratory studies, regular accounting of human 
factors, and improved computer models. Demand exists today for accurate 
assessments of greenhouse effects to develop policies that could 
constrain related human activities. The EOS will supply information 
needed to understand and predict climate changes from both natural and 
human causes. The EOS will ploy a vital role in enhancing knowledge and 
improving tools that world leaders need to make informed decisions.<P>

<H2>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</H2><P>


Since the Television Infrared Observing Satellite-l (TIROS-1 ) sent back 
the first cloud formation photographs in 1960, Earth-observing satellites 
have provided a unique perspective of our changing planet. Working 
through the Committee on Earth Observations Satellites (CEOS), member 
organizations have joined together in a common endeavour to improve the 
value of this important scientific and technological investment.<P>


CEOS was created at the suggestion of the G-7 Economic Summit in 1984, 
and has since grown to encompass all of the world's civil agencies 
responsible for Earth observation space programmes along with agencies 
that receive and process data acquired remotely from space. International 
data users- including Earth science programmes like the International 
Geosphere-Biosphere Programme (IGBP) and the World Climate Research 
Programme (WCRP), and environmental applications organizations like the 
United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP)-receive affiliate member 
status.  CEOS provides a forum wherein the users and producers of Earth 
observation satellite data exchange information about programmed plans, 
and requirements, thus improving coordination and avoiding unnecessary 
duplication and overlap of effort.<P>


This brochure illustrates the worldwide uses of Earth observation 
satellites in such vital areas as weather forecasting, disaster 
monitoring and mitigation, agriculture, fisheries, and long-term climate 
modeling. CEOS has a cooperative structure for satellite planning, data 
management, and data policy that provides the framework for efficient use 
and broader sharing of data and results. As a next step, CEOS will 
consider the feasibility of global information networks for satellite- 
and ground-based observations, applications, and research.<P>

<LI><B>ABSTRACT</B>:<br>  
    Over the last 20 years, international scientific and governmental
organizations have become concerned about changes in global ozone
concentration and distribution. An ozone "hole", actually an area of
steadily decreasing concentration, has developed over Antarctica.  Recent

data analysis indicates a smaller but measurable decrease of 
stratospheric
ozone over the Arctic, temperate and tropical zones as well.  In this
project you will familiarize yourself ozone, its generation, destruction
and distribution in the stratosphere, its chemical interaction with other

trace gases, and its interaction with the structure and dynamics of the
stratosphere, troposphere and biosphere.  Within the latter are of
interest, examine the effects of decreasing ozone concentration on plant,

animal and  human life.  Working with your colleagues is critical and
cooperation between teams is encouraged.<P>


<LI><B>EVALUATION:</B><br>
  Your team grade for work quality will be determined by the
quality of a hypermedia report suitable for browsing on the ESSCC's 
server.
 The report should answer the thematic question by explaining your
hypothesis, your strategy for testing your hypothesis and most 
importantly,
the findings of your investigation. The reports should also include a
quantitative STELLA model of the sources, sinks and flows of 
stratospheric
ozone in the Earth system which accounts for its annual variation.
A quantitative STELLA model of the sources, sinks and flows of heat 
energy
in the Earth system which accounts for annual variation of ozone
concentrations.  Relevant data and data visualizations (made by using 
NCSA
Collage) of monthly or weekly averaged ozone data from NASA archives 
should
be compared with values calculated by the model.  Finally, information
about how ozone is measured and processed should be included in the final

report.  See the presentation checklist for the rundown of all needed
components.  Cite all sources and references. As a written report your
hypermedia report should be no less than six double-spaced typed pages 
that
explain the ozone problem and its significance.<P>
 


<LI><B>PROCESS</B>:<br> 
Information Gathering:<br>
         Use books and articles in the lab and the library, and Internet
search tools (NCSA's Mosaic, Archie, WAIS and Gopher) to conduct a search

for current information about the Ozone. Read and discuss the 
information.
You need to make at least four new hotlinks to Internet references in 
your
final hypermedia report.<P>

        
<LI><B>HYPOTHESIS</B>:<br>  
        With your team, investigate the relationships between key factors

in the ozone controversy. Suggest a hypothesis in order to explain the
causes of the creation, destruction and distribution of ozone across the
globe, and the presence or absence of correlations with other atmospheric

phenomena.  You must cite at least three sources which support your
hypothesis. Hypotheses must be submitted by the start of the second week 
of
the project.<P>


<LI><B>QUALITATIVE MODELING: </B><br>
  Create a common-sense STELLA model of your
hypothesis which includes important features of phenomena under
investigation, and clearly shows interrelations between these features. 
This common-sense model must be based on facts gleaned from your 
readings.
In the comments  box of each component of your model, include a brief
description and bibliographical reference to the source of that
information.<p> 
        
<LI><B>DATA SELECTION</B>: <br>
  What data do you need to test your hypothesis? We will
use NASA's Goddard and Langley DAAC to select and collect data which may 
be
relevant to supporting your hypothesis.<P>
 
        
<LI><B>DATA VISUALIZATION AND ANALYSIS</B>:<br>
  As a team, collaboratively examine relevant data using NCSA Collage 
visualization software. Find the maxima and minima of ozone concentration 
in each dataset.  Adjust or create palettes to improve the visual 
representation of the data.  Add comments and observations derived from 
visualizing the data; suggest refinements to the model.<P>


<LI><B>QUANTITATIVE MODELING</B>:<br>   Transform your qualitative model into 
a
quantitative model using STELLA modeling software.  Based upon your notes
from the data visualization process, and your research into stratospheric
ozone, construct a prototype quantitative model which relies on the data
analysis. Your team should use this empirical evidence to test your
hypothesis and refine your model.  How reliable is you model? What other
information is relevant to the study of ozone? Note explicitly the
boundaries of your understanding of the dynamics of stratospheric 
ozone.<P>
  
        
<LI><B>COMMUNICATION</B>: <br>
1. Present your findings using your data, data products
(graphics, visualizations, animations and text) on the NCSA Mosaic 
server.
Hotlink relevant terms and passages to your STELLA model, Collage images,

QuickTime movies, and any secondary sources you found valuable in the
course of your research on the Internet. <BR><BR>
2. Write a report (no more than

six double-spaced typed pages) explaining the stratosheric distribution 
of ozone and its significance. Cite all sources and references. 
A draft must be submitted

in three weeks. The final report and presentation must be submitted in 
four
weeks and must include references and evidence from your 
investigation.<P>
    
  
        
<LI><B>REFINE, DESIGN</B>:<br>   Examine the findings of other teams, suggest 
any useful
modifications to the investigations. Review and evaluate your teams 
project
plan, strategy, changes, and problems in the manager's report and
presentation.<P>

<H2>ENHANCING INFORMATION SHARING:</H2><P>


Users around the world will benefit most from the collective 
international investment in Earth observing satellites and sensors if 
several conditions are met:<P>


<UL>
<li>Information about the systems and the existing data are easily 
available.<br> 
<li>The data are easy to use and to combine with data from other 
satellites and/or ground-based sources.<br>  
<li>The rules for data access are consistent and encourage maximum data 
use.
</UL><P>

CEOS already provides these services in support of the worldwide 
scientific, operational, and commercial user communities.<P>


A single, up-to-date source describing the satellites, sensors, and 
ground systems of CEOS member agencies was compiled and is being 
maintained by the CEOS Secretariat.  Prospective satellite data users can 
use this information to understand what relevant observations are 
available and are planned for the future.<P>


The CEOS International Directory Network (IDN) contains standardized 
descriptions of data held in CEOS member agency archives and by other 
organizations with data of interest.  With major data nodes in Europe, 
Japan, and the U.S., and with local access possible in most CEOS member 
countries, users can find out what data have been collected, some of the 
characteristics of the data sets, and how to order the items of 
interest.<P>

These four images show a 360 Degree view of global sea surface 
temperature for the first week of 1992.  They were derived from a three 
dimensional computer animation of global Advanced Very High-
Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) data.  Temperature indicators range from 
blue (cold) through yellow and red (warm).  Provided by: NOAA.<P><P>

<H2>THE EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE AND FUTURE POSSIBILITIES:</H2><P>


<IMG SRC="" ALIGN=right VSPACE=20 HSPACE=20><P>Many users 
want to combine data from sensors flying on different satellites. This 
can provide more frequent coverage or more detailed information. The CEOS 
Working Group on Data has provided a forum for sensor specialists and 
users to develop standard data formats that can be offered by all data 
centers. Standard formats save time and money, because individuals can 
obtain data from several different satellites and use them in an 
integrated processing and analysis system.<P>


For global change research, CEOS also has established common data policy 
principles ensuring full and open access to data from Earth observation 
satellites, and has defined a common framework for data exchange. Work 
continues in an effort to include other types of data use in this 
mutually beneficial data policy.<P>


The international CEOS infrastructure described above has helped phase 
independent national efforts into an international cooperative Earth 
observations framework. CEOS has demonstrated the benefits to users 
worldwide of cooperation in and establishment of an international 
directory network for global observations. As the CEOS member agencies 
expand their individual and joint programmes under this cooperative 
umbrella, and as the community of users grows larger and more 
sophisticated, demands for data and information will increase. This 
presents many challenges-technical, scientific, and financial. The CEOS 
agencies are working to meet these needs in a concerted effort to benefit 
all who inhabit planet Earth.<P><P>

<H2>EDUCATION</H2>


<IMG SRC="" ALIGN=right Border=0 VSPACE=20 HSPACE=30>
<BR>
Education is the key to the future, and the use of Earth observation 
satellites is central to increased understanding of the planet. 
Throughout the world, students at all levels can use satellites to learn 
about Earth's geography, topography, temperature, cloud formations, and 
wind and water currents. The uses are already more complex than simple 
photographs, direct readouts of satellite data are used to look at 
real-time changes in the weather, and ground truth studies form the basis 
for field trips to areas that have been scanned by multiple satellites. 
Furthermore, CEOS promotes programmes to increase public awareness and 
conferences to help policymakers in developing countries take full 
advantage of the data that only space-based instrumentation can 
provide.<P>

Students participating in an Aspen Global Change Institute (AGCI) short 
course are using a satellite image to identify familiar objects and to 
determine scale in this case, by measuring the length of the Golden Gate 
Bridge.<P>

In future years, the knowledge that is being passed on to today's 
students will help tomorrow's leaders meet the challenges of our changing 
planet. Education, and not only the education of children, is truly one 
of the most important and far-reaching applications of Earth observation 
technology.<P><P>
<P>


<IMG SRC="" ALIGN=left Border=0 VSPACE=30 HSPACE=30><P><P>


Through Automatic Picture Transmission (APT), students can directly 
capture satellite data to a personal computer workstation as polar 
orbiting satellites fly overhead. The exploitation of spacebased 
remote-sensing instrumentation remains a high priority item for the 
United Nations, with concerted efforts underway to bring this capability 
to the developing countries of the world.<P><P>

<Title>TAHAN UNIX</Title> 

<H3><A NAME="man">man</A></H3> To see what the online manual has to say about a certain
command, type: <Ul><Ul><strong>man <i>command</i></strong></Ul></Ul><BR>
<H4><i>Warning!</i></H4> The manual, in my opinion, can be difficult and overwhelming.
That's why I created this simple reference of UNIX commands in the first place.<p> 

If you are using the UNIX machine itself, there is usually an excellent X-Windows based manual available to you. On a SGI, it's called Insight. Try typing <b>xman</b>. A far better alternative to man.<p>

Editing a text file on a UNIX machine can be a pain. VI is pretty much your only choice in the cammand line. My advice is to <b>man vi</b> becuase I really can't explain it myself or don't do text editing in the UNIX shell. Use a graphical text editor.

Hi!  My name is Julie Bertel, and I am a senior at Nerinx Hall.  I live 
in St. Louis, MO.  I am 5'4" and my birthday is June 9, 1977.  I have 
light brown hair and green eyes.  I have two brothers named Joe and Jeff.  
I plan to go to college at the University of Missouri - Columbia, and I 
want to major in business, possibly marketing with a minor in psychology.  
I like to spend a lot of time with my friends.  I love Italian food.  I 
also like to travel.  In fact, I just got back from spring break in South 
Padre Island, Texas.  My favorite place to go is Destin, Florida.  In my 
spare time I like to rollerblade and spend time with my family and 
friends.  I am really looking forward to communicating with you.  
Good-bye!!

Hey, my name is Amy Block. I am a senior at Nerinx Hall. My birthday is 
January 23, 1977.  I have light blue eyes and brown hair.  My hobbies are 
painting and drawing and I am in the Art Club at my school.  In my free 
time I like to spend time with my friends and my family.  I have an older 
sister named, Becky, and a younger brother named, Jeff. I'm not sure what 
my future plans are at the moment, but I have an idea of where I'm going 
to college.  I think I want to go to Benedictine College in Kansas or 
Texas Christian University.   I'm looking forward to meeting all of you!

Julie Collins

Hello! I am 16 and a junior at Nerinx Hall High School. I live in 
Kirkwood, Missouri. My birthday is December 2, 1977.  I like to  play 
volleyball and golf. I also enjoy going out with my friends on weekends. 
I have a part- time job at a nursing home as the receptionist. During the 
week I work, do homework, and try to call and see my friends as much as 
possible. I have one brother who is 25, and a nephew who is about 2 years 
old. I am in a club at school, also.  It's called Outreach. I went to 
Assumption grade school for 8 years and then came to Nerinx. I am looking 
forward to graduating next year and going on to college. I am planning on 
going to Southwest Missouri State University. I would like to pursue a 
career in the science or medical field. Over the summer I visited Italy, 
France, and Spain.  This was very enjoyable and interesting. I look 
forward to hearing from all of you. Bye!

Hey!  My name is Maria Cucchi, I'm 17 years old, and a senior.  My 
birthday is May 1, 1977.  I have brown hair, and hazel eyes.  I am the 
oldest of three kids.  I have a sister, Laura, who is 14, and a brother

Hi!  My name is Kathleen Daly.  I am a senior (yeah!) at Nerinx Hall.  My 
birthday is December 26, 1976 so that would make me 17.  Besides my mom 
and dad, I have two sisters and one brother.  I am the oldest.  I also 
have a cat and a dog.  I like to travel --- I wish I could do more.  I 
went to Honduras this summer with school.  It was partly a service trip, 
but mostly just to experience 3rd world culture.  I hope to go back and 
spend some time there next summer! I like to play basketball, but just 
for fun (I'm not any good).  I also like drama.  I'm involved in our 
school's Outreach club.  I guess that's about it --- I really don't like 
writing biographies!

Ellen Hopkins
</h1>

My name is Ellen Hopkins and I am a Senior.  I was born June 16, 1977.  I 
have a mom and a dad and a sister, Nancy.  I also have a dog.  Her name 
is Buttons and she is a Shih-Tzu, Llaso Apso mix.  She's pretty cool.  I 
like running track and I also enjoy basketball.  I don't do stamp 
collecting or knitting, but I really like photography.  I am the photo 
editor of our school newspaper.  I also like to travel.  Over the summer 
I went to Italy.  I also went to Indiana for a photo journalism workshop.  
During the school year I mainly focus on schoolwork during the week and 
on the weekend I just go wherever with friends.

of St. Louis.  I am a senior at Nerinx Hall High School.  My birthday is 
August 2, 1977.  I have light brown hair, blue eyes, and I am 5' 9" tall.

Katie Lane
</h1>

Hi.  My name is Katie.  I live in Webster Groves, Missouri.  I am a 
Junior at Nerinx Hall and my birthday is October 13, 1977.  I am 5' 3", 
have dark reddish brown hair and hazel eyes.  If people would have to 
describe me they would most likely say that I am friendly, outgoing, 
loving, and I love singing and traveling.  I sing in four different 
nationally and internationally known choirs.  I sing for my school in 
both the Select Women's Choir and the Select Women Honors Choir.  I sing 
for the the St. Louis Concert Choir and the Chamber Singers.  I love to 
travel to the beach and the mountains when I'm on break from school.  I 
love Disney and Werner Brothers' cartoons.  Basically I am a little kid 
at heart although at times you would never know it because I can be very 
dedicated and serious at times.  I like to party with my friends like 
most people do.  I am a big thrill seeker.  I love a challenge or 
anything that will give you a thrill, such as bungi jumping, cliff 
diving, rock climbing, and hiking in the mountains.  I love sports, 
especially football, hockey, and diving.  I guess that's the basics.  See 
you on the network.

Hello, my name is Jill Rabbitt, and I am a senior at Nerinx in St. Louis, 
Missouri.  My birthday is June 12, 1977.  A few things about myself are 
that I enjoy watching and particpating in sports.  I am currently running 
cross-country and in the spring I will begin my track and field training. 
I'm also a dancer and am in many school musicals during the year.  I also 
play volleyball during the year for my grade school in a CYC program.  I

<Title>First, Welcome to El Nino</Title>
<H1><A NAME="El Nino">El Nino</H2></H1></A>
<H3><i>What are the causes and affects of the El Nino cycle?</i></H3><p>

<Ul>by Brian Tighe, Steven Davis, Bekit Berhani, and Charles Tahan</Ul><p><p>

<Ul>In </Ul> the last few decades, scientists have been trying to learn
 more about a natural phenomenon that recurs at random intervals in time 
off the western coast of South America.  After many years of intensive 
study, it is still not entirely understood. A product of a cycle that begins
 rather obscurely in the western Pacific, El Nino has devastatingly affected 
the fishing industries of Peru and Equador and caused significant atmospheric 
anomalies that in turn have put a toll on other aspects of coastal life in 
the eastern Pacific.  This project seeks to identify those effects, trace 
and relate some aspects of origin of the El Nino-Southern Oscillation system, 
and combine related features of the cycle in order to establish some sense
 of predictability of the event.  Findings from the project are compiled 
in a simulation Stella II model, using data derived from PODAAC(Physical 
Oceanography Distributed Active Archive Center) and NOAA as well as 
previously written reports on the subject.<p>

<H4>Hypothesis = </H4>
El Nino is the effect of a cycle between Kelvin waves, Rossby waves, and atmospheric & oceanic dynamics which include the trade winds and the Coriolis force. These <i>forces</i> each promote the other, either positively or negatively causing an everlastin
g cycle. Thus, the El Nino/La Nina event can be predicted to a close extent through examining the sea surface temperature and the dynamics of internal waves and trade winds in the Pacific Ocean.<p>


Our Stella Model<IMG SRC="401.GIF"><p>


The model displayed here is only one of two that are trying to represent the complicated El Nino cycle. From designing and creating this working model, it was discovered that although this particular model has flaws, a working, mathematical model of the e

vent can be created from the popular theory concerning the event.<p>

This document focuses on answering the question "How and why is
 thermal energy distributed across the planets surface?". To try to
 answer this question we used background information, such as 
information on relationships between earth system components and 
averages on the amount of radiation they introduced or distributed
 to or through the earth system, to create a model - using Stella 
II Modeling software.<img src=""><P> Then, to test the
 model using day to day data.<img src=""><p>
From background information we hypothesized that the surplus of
 radiation that reaches the equatorial zone (because of its
 closeness to the sun) is distributed throughout the earth system
 through the processes of convection, conduction, and radiation.<p>
Our model was unable to fully show the ideas of our hypothesis
 because we were unable to work the processes of convection and 
conduction into it. And, unfortunately, we were not able to
 implement real day data into our model although we did have a
 detailed way of how to.  If you would like to read our full

<A NAME="1.Abstract"><B>1.Abstract:</B></A><p>
In this project, we research the amount of variation in ozone concentration in the stratosphere over areas of the world.  Having observed a lesser amount of ozone over Antarctica, we attempt to explain why this is.  The hypothesis, which was proven correct, was that sources of chlorine such as volcanic eruptions, sea water evaporation, and the burning of biomass are the leading factors in the depletion of ozone levels.<p>

<A NAME="2.Keywords"><B>2.Keywords:</B></A><p>
Polar Vortex, Polar Stratospheric Clouds, Ozone, Photodissasotion, Chloroflourocarbons, Polar Night, Solar Ultra-Violet Radiation, Biosphere, Chlorine, Stratosphere, North Temperate, South Temperate, Equitorial, Arctic, Antarctic
<p>

<A NAME="3.Hypothesis"><B>3.Hypothesis:</B></A><p>
Our hypothesis is that, although man made CFC's are a contributing factor in the ozone depletion process,  they are not the major cause of the ozone hole as such.  Natural sources such as volcanoes, oceans, and the burning of organic materials have a comparatively larger effect upon the amount of ozone in the stratosphere than man made CFCs.  In addition, phenomenon specific to the Antarctic, namely the polar stratospheric clouds and the polar vortex, contribute to the depleted ozone levels in the region.
<p>

<A NAME="3.1 Method of Testing"><B>3.1 Method of Testing:</B></A><p>

	In order to test the hypothesis, a Stella Model will be produced.  The model will be of annual ozone distribution and will include statistics regarding the amount of chlorine produced by the before mentioned factors taken from the texts, "The Hole in the
 Ozone Scare," and "Ozone Depletion, Greenhouse Gases, and Climate Change."  The validity of the model can be examined by comparing it to SAGE II data as visualized by Collage.  Once sufficient accuracy of the model is attained, the amount of chlorine produced by man will be set to zero.  The model will then be run once more.  A comparison of the ozone amounts with man made CFCs and ozone amounts without CFCs produced by man will be made.  If the difference between the two is small, then the hypothesis will be proven correct.<p>

<A NAME="4.Introduction"><B>4.Introduction:</B></A><p>

	The ozone layer is a region in the upper atmosphere between 10 and 40 kilometers(6 and 25 miles)2 altitude.  Ozone, with the formula O3, is found in small concentrations throughout the atmosphere; but its largest concentrations are found in the stratosphere - 15 and 45 kilometers(9 and 28 miles)3.  Ozone is created when short-wave solar ultraviolet radiation reacts with molecular oxygen(O2).  The oxygen molecule at this point splits and is temporarily transformed into two separate oxygen atoms.  These then combine with molecular oxygen to form ozone.  Once it is formed, ozone can easily be destroyed by solar ultraviolet radiation.  It can also be broken down by chlorine, which is a  highly reactive element.<p>

O2(g) + O(g) + l290 ----> O3(g)<p>

This equation represents the formation of ozone where l290  is sunlight at wavelengths of 290 nm.<p>

O3(g) + l290 ----> O2(g) + O(g)<p>

This equation represents the destruction of ozone.<p>

	Solar ultraviolet radiation, upon contact with ozone, produces an effect called photo disassociation.  Photo disassociation is the process by which ozone molecules are destroyed by the sun's energy.<p>  

	Stratospheric ozone prevents almost all solar ultraviolet radiation with a wavelength of less than 290 nanometers from reaching the Earth's surface4.  This is an important aspect of the ozone layer because without it, life on Earth would be adversely affected - life would not exist at all.  "Exposure to ultraviolet light enhances an individual's risk for skin cancer and cataracts, so an increase in this radiation could lead to more cases of such diseases.  Ultraviolet light also harms food crops and other plants, as well as many species of animals."5  

<p>In viewing the absence of the ozone layer's function in a different perspective, it is evident that the existence of ozone itself would not be possible.  It is the biosphere, more specifically plant life, that emits oxygen(which is essential to the formation of ozone) into the atmosphere.  

<p>Without ozone, and without its ability to impede the intrusion of solar ultraviolet radiation, plant life on Earth would eventually disappear (this is due to the negative effects that U.V. radiation has on the process of photosynthesis - namely, its prevention).  This in turn leads to the end of production of oxygen, and consequently the lack of the necessary component of the ozone - production process.  The oceans also support an immense amount of oxygen producing life and is in fact the largest source of oxygen on the planet.  If the sun's  ultraviolet radiation were allowed to enter the Earth's atmosphere, the oceans would evaporate; and all the oxygen producing life (which is mainly plankton) would die.<p>

	The ozone hole, an area of extensively depleted ozone over Antarctica is characterized by an area of ozone less than 200 dobson units6.  The "hole" was first noticed in the 1980s by British scientists.  Chlorine has been identified as the sole element in
 the production of this "hole" [and therefore in the depletion of ozone].  The concentrated presence of chlorine over this area of the planet can be attributed to the following three factors.<p>

	The Polar Vortex is a cyclical wind pattern in the southern region of the planet.  It allows for the entry, but prevents the removal of, chlorine particles released by various sources on the Earth.  These sources include sea water, volcanoes, the burning
 of organic materials, ocean life, and - to a comparatively lesser degree, CFCs.  

<p>A second factor in the particularly high presence of chlorine about the region of Antarctica is the formation of Polar Stratospheric Clouds.  PSCs contribution to the ozone "hole" stems from their capacity to transform non-active chlorine into active, 
more destructive chlorine.  The polar vortex provides cold enough temperatures(-80 degrees Celsius7) for the formation of these clouds which allow unusual chemical interactions among nitrogen, hydrogen, and chlorine atoms.  So, in effect, polar stratospheric clouds are catalysts for the unusual reactions which make chlorine the leading factor in the depletion of the ozone layer.  

<p>The third major component in ozone deterioration is the Antarctic seasonal variation of light and darkness.  During the northern winter months between September and February, the Earth's axis is tilted 23 degrees off the perpendicular to the ecliptic, 
which is the plane representing the alignment of the earth, the sun, and the moon during an eclipse.  This tilt can be visualized as occurring away from the sun in the northern axis.  The opposite happens during the southern winter months between March and August.  The southern region of the Earth experiences six months of light and six months of darkness, respectively.  

<p>The reason why this phenomenon alters the cycle of ozone production destruction is simply a matter of sunlight.  During Polar Night, the period of darkness which lasts six months, ozone is not produced.  It is, nevertheless depleted by the present quantities of chlorine.  During the period of light (which lasts six months), ozone is produced.  After a certain concentration of ozone is reached, there is an equilibrium.  

<p>At the end of the polar night, the polar stratospheric clouds over Antarctica act as catalysts to the formation of ozone as they did for chlorine.  However, this only lasts for a relatively short period of time because of the necessary temperatures in 
which the clouds exist.  Over a number of such cycles, the amount of ozone produced, despite the accelerated process of formation at the end of the dark season.  This could be justified by the fact that six months of active chlorine destroy ozone , in addition to the presence of chlorine in the atmosphere year round, and the fact that solar ultraviolet radiation breaks up ozone, are disproportionately greater factors than the actual formation of ozone.<p>

One atom of chlorine can destroy anywhere from 10,0008 to 100,0009 molecules of ozone.  "When a chlorine atom collides with an ozone molecule, the result is a release of oxygen gas and chlorine monoxide.  The Cholorine monoxide is stable until it encounters a free oxygen atom.  Collision with the oxygen atom creates another oxygen molecule and frees the chlorine atom to collide with another ozone molecule."10 <p>

Man made chloroflorocarbons(CFCs) are not the only source of chlorine.  Volcanoes, sea water, and biomass burning are also sources of chlorine.  By keeping this in mind, it is not impossible to suppose that one of these other sources or even a combination
 of them is more harmful to ozone levels than man made CFCs that break down ozone.<p>

<A NAME="5.1 The Stella II Model"><B> 5.1 The Stella II Model:</B></A><p>

The Stella II model represents annual ozone distribution to different regions of the Earth.  Each region, Arctic, North Temperate, Equatorial, South Temperate, and Antarctic are represented by individual reservoir.  All reservoirs receive their amounts from a central ozone reservoir.  The amount of the central reservoir is determined by an inflow labeled "General Gain" and an outflow labeled "General Loss."
<p>
The exact amount each region receives is a percentage of the central ozone reservoir.  The initial percentages were guesses.  They were latter refined using data from SAGE II visualized by Collage.  Average ozone levels at 32 kilometers altitude for January, April, July, and November of 1989 were compared to the guessed values and adjusted accordingly.  
<p>
Table 1 is a list of the averages for those months found using SAGE II data.  The SAGE data only provided an accurate recurring range of -50 to 50 degrees latitude which covers the South Temperate, Equatorial, and North Temperate regions.  The ranges used
 for the individual regions are -50 to -25 degrees latitude for the South Temperate, -25 to 25 degrees for the Equatorial, and -25 to 50 degrees latitude for the North Temperate.<p>

<p>
Table 1. Average ozone amounts of each region for 1989 in parts per million by volume.  All values rounded to the nearest hundredth.
<p>
The ozone levels in the Arctic and Antarctic zones are estimates.  The Antarctic level was arrived at by using a proportion since a conversion factor for converting dobson units(DU) to parts per million by volume(ppmv) was not available.  Average ozone levels are at 300 DU while Antarctic ozone levels are at approximately 220 DU.  In parts per million by volume, the average for ozone is about 8 ppmv.  Using this information, the average ozone level over the Antarctic was set to about 5 ppmv.
<p>
<A NAME="5.1.1 Ozone Creation as Handled by the Model"><B> 5.1.1 Ozone Creation as Handled by the Model:</B></A><p>

Ozone creation is treated as an inflow, labeled "General Gain", to the central reservoir of ozone.  The value of "General Gain" comes from a sphere called "O3 Formation" which gets its value from the seasonal variation of light represented as an inflow.  
Seasonal variation of light is a sine function that has an amplitude of one and a period of twelve which represents the number of months in a year.
<p>
<A NAME="5.1.2 Ozone Destruction as Handled by the Model"><B> 5.1.2 Ozone Destruction as Handled by the Model:</B></A><p>

Ozone Destruction is represented as an outflow of the central ozone reservoir labeled "General Loss" and as outflows of each specific region.  "General Loss"  gets its value from a sphere called "Cl Compounds" which is the sum total of the estimated amount of chlorine released into the atmosphere annually by various sources in millions of tons.  The sources are all individual spheres with constant values labeled CFCs, Volcanoes, Sea water, Biomass Burning, and Ocean Biota.

Ozone destruction also occurs in the individual regions represented by outflows whose values are derived from factors specific to the region.  In the North Temperate, Equatorial, and South Temperate zones the outflows are labeled Nat Loss 1, Nat Loss 2, and Nat Loss 3 respectively.  The Arctic outflow, "Arctic Output," equals the amount of damage done by polar stratospheric clouds(PSCs 1) which has a value that is a percentage of amount of ozone in the Arctic reservoir.  Antarctic ozone loss is the represented by an outflow called "Antarctic Output."  Antarctic Output is the product of Seasonal Variation of Light and polar stratospheric clouds(PSCs 2).  The value of PSCs 2 is Polar Vortex multiplied by a constant.  In this way, the Polar Vortex acts as a 
mechanism used to magnify the effects of polar stratospheric clouds.  The Polar Vortex is set equal to the seasonal variation of light.
<p>
<A NAME="5.2 Testing and Results"><B> 5.2 Testing and Results:</B></A><p>

Initially, the model was run over a one year span with the value of chlorine released into the atmosphere by CFCs set to .75 million tons (Figure 2).  The model was run again with the value set to zero (Figure 1).  Because determining the difference proved difficult, the model was run twice more; however, the period of time was extended to ten years.  The value for the sphere CFCs was once again set to 0.75 (Figure 4) then it was set back to zero (Figure 3).  Again, the difference is not easily determined, in fact, the graphs (Figures 1 and 2 and 3 and 4) seem to be identical.  They cannot be identical as the only change made was to the value of the sphere CFCs.

<p>
<p>
<A NAME="6.Conclusion"><B>6.Conclusion:</B></A><p>

Because the difference in the graphs is so small, the hypothesis can be considered correct.  The amount of damage produced by chlorine from CFCs is negligible compared to other sources of chlorine.  It should be noted that the findings of this report do not give a green light to use CFCs because chloroflourocarbons do release chlorine which is harmful to the ozone layer.  This fact should be enough to warrant the banning or at least the limiting of CFC usage since it is illogical to add to a problem which
 already exists.

The <A href="282.htm#atmosphere">atmosphere</A> is a shell of several gases suspended around the earth which protects the animals, plants, and other biomes from unendurable solar radiation. The <A href="282.htm#biosphere">biosphere</A> is made up of all the living beings in the earth system. In 1979, James Lovelock and Lynn Margulis proposed the <A href="282.htm#Gaia hypothesis">Gaia hypothesis</A>. The Gaia hypothesis states that the earth is a superorganism and that the biosphere controls its surroundings to produce conditions ideal for life. Another view taken about the earth system is the <A href="282.htm#Shiva theory">Shiva theory</A>. It states that life is primarily controlled by periodic or episodic catastrophic destruction of life by comet or asteroid impacts.{1}<p>


 This project takes a view between these two. It assumes that the biosphere does have some control over external forces, at least from the perspective of the entire earth's history, but that an event catastrophic enough could "wipe out" biological life before it could react to the situation. The number of interactions between the atmosphere and the biosphere is inexhaustible; therefore this report focuses on the relationship between vegetation growth and CO2 concentration in both long term, 100's of thousands to million's of years, and short term processes, 100's of years. It goes further by studying the increase in CO2 since pre-Industrial times and attributing it to the actions of the <A href="282.htm#anthroposphere">anthroposphere</A>(humanity). <p>

This project consists of two models. One model simply graphs the rise in CO2 in previous years using a <A href="282.htm#feedback loops">positive feedback loop</A> (a loop that increases all the members of it indefinitely). The other tries to prove the Gaia hypothesis by creating a theoretical model which runs on time scales close to that of the earth's and which represents the basic interactions between four main parts of the biosphere/atmosphere: CO2 concentration, O2 concentration, animals, and plants. It uses <A href="282.htm#feedback loops">negative feedback loops</A> (a loop that results in a stabilization of all its members) to produce a Gaian effect. The two models are then combined to see if the "long term" model can correct for the increase in CO2 charted by the "short term" model.<p>

The interactions between the levels of CO2 and vegetation growth are defined by the timescale in which they are studied. In short term processes, 100's of years, the effect of CO2 on vegetation and vegetation on CO2 is minimal. The rotation of the earth affects levels of CO2 and vegetation growth more then either one affects the other. In long term processes, 100's of thousands to millions of years{1}, however, the interactions between the CO2 concentrations and the amount of vegetation growth produce a more Gaian effect. The interactions between the two create a negative feedback loop; thus they provide a fairly stable environment.<p>

<HR><p>

<H2><A NAME="Background">Background</H2></A><p>
	The basic interactions between CO2 concentration and vegetation growth have been long studied. In fact, many of us learned about them in a high school Biology course. The loop is simple. Plants "breath" CO2; thus when there is more of it, plants grow more (there is a limit however to their happiness). The plants use up the CO2 which lowers CO2 concentration levels. When the vegetation count is lower (winter), CO2 is high, and when the plants are thriving, (summer) CO2 is low. Because of this known process of nature, it has been deduced that vegetation levels act to control CO2 levels in the earth system. This control of CO2 levels by vegetation control would be totally true if done in an enclosed cell in a laboratory somewhere but is not completely true of the real world. There is a "wave" created by the effect of this in data (which you will see later) of CO2 levels taken over the past half century; however, vegetation, by no means, controls CO2 levels in any useful way, at least in the short run.<p>
	Carbon Dioxide in the atmosphere is non-Gaian. The input of CO2 to the atmosphere is a result of the degassing of the Earth (specifically by volcanoes and hydrothermal systems among others). The amount of CO2 in the atmosphere at any given time is in no way related to the geophysical processes occurring below. Thus, in the short run, CO2 is non-Gaian. It does, however, rely on the cycle of carbon between the geosphere and hydrosphere when looked at over the entire earth's life span.{1}<p>
	Over the past two centuries, carbon dioxide levels have been rising gradually. Prior to the 1800's (pre industrial world), CO2 was approximately 280{1} parts per million(ppm). CO2 levels, collected from Hawaii's Mauna Loa Observatory in water vapor free air (CO2 is usually collected in a small flask and analyzed by infrared devices and CO2-in-air calibration gases) show how from 1958 to 1991 (the longest running collection of CO2) CO2 concentrations increase about 30 ppm.<A href="283.htm"><IMG SRC=""></A><p>

Theoretical calculations indicate that a doubling of CO2 will result in a global average surface temperature increase of 2.5 to 4.5 degrees C {2}. This obviously interests ecologists who fear that too much of an increase in temperature will melt the great polar glaciers and cause a catastrophe in our world. This increase in CO2 levels is credited to the burning of fossil fuels and forests by the <A href="282.htm#anthroposphere">anthroposphere</A>. Eventhough the biosphere has some control over levels of CO2 in the atmosphere, it might not have enough to control this "jump", certainly not within a hundred years. In a longer and, as a result, more Gaian scale, it might, however. These ideas will both be addressed.<p>

	In order to create a model which accurately represents the increase in CO2 over the last half century and shows the biosphere's effect on CO2 levels, a research approach to earth system science must be taken. Data must be collected first so that the model can have a basis for its predictions.<p> 

<IMG SRC="">Short Term model<p>

	Carbon Dioxide concentration data, as seen above, is the basis for the first part of the model. Since CO2 is a global gas, the data collected from Mauna Loa (above) can be applied to the entire earth. It is known that CO2 rises approximately .4%{1} a year and that the biosphere affects it (wave motion described earlier). Because CO2 is "separated" from geological processes in the short term, it can also be deduced that the geosphere does not affect CO2 content in the short term; thus the CO2 content is constant from the perspective of the geosphere. The only thing left to increase levels of CO2 by .4% is the anthroposphere in its burning of fossil fuels and of forests. From this knowledge a very basic model can be created which charts the levels of CO2 and which should look exactly like the CO2 data from Mauna Loa.<BR>
	In this model<IMG SRC=""> the effect of the anthroposphere is represented by the only input flow <IMG SRC="">which is the percentage increase in CO2. Vegetation control of CO2 is represented by the only output which contains the equation "SINWAVE(5,3)". Where 5 is the amount of increase and decrease caused by vegetation and 3 is the period of a complete sinwave (CO2 is not controlled in real time by vegetation, there is a delay in its affect on CO2 levels). The reservoir <IMG SRC=""> was set to 320 ppm which was the level of CO2 in 1958.<p>
	If the graph of the model is compared to the actual data, it should be almost identical barring flaws in the modeling program.<BR>

The Stella model <IMG SRC="">created for the long term relationship between flora, fauna, O2, and CO2 is fairly simple. It covers the interactions over hundreds of thousands to millions of years. This model is largely hypothetical with no quantitative data. However, the qualitative data (i.e. the relationships between the gasses and the biosphere) is all accurate. CO2 and O2 need no explanation, however the terms flora and fauna do.  In the hypothetical world of the model, there are only two kinds of life: animals and photosynthesizing plants. Fauna represents all of the animal kingdom, while flora the amount of vegetation on the planet. <p>  
	One unit, in the Stella II modeling program, of flora will take in 
one part per thousand of CO2 and breath out one part per thousand of O2 per DT (the solution interval defined by Stella II). A unit of fauna works in exactly the 
opposite manner. In other words, a one unit increase in flora will result in 
the percentage of O2 in the atmosphere to rise by .1% and the percentage of 
CO2 to fall by .1%.  The total volume of the atmosphere on the planet remains 
at a constant volume throughout the course of the model.<p>
	Two separate long term models were created to examine and illustrate 
the interactions between the biosphere and the atmosphere.  Both include 
the flora and fauna system described above.  Each gas is represented by a reservoir.  
The CO2 reservoir's input is equal to the amount of fauna and it's output 
is equal to the amount of flora.  O2 worked in the opposite manner with the 
level of flora as it's input and the level of fauna as it's output.  
This is possible since the number of units of flora or fauna is directly 
equal to the number of parts per thousand of each gas consumed or produced 
each DT as described above. The difference in the two models lies in how 
the gases affect the levels of the biosphere components. <p> 
	In the first model <IMG SRC="">, the amounts of the gasses control the amount 
of death in the biosphere. Both flora and fauna are reservoirs with the 
inputs equal to the birth rate times the current population.  25% is the 
rate used for both. The outputs are the number of plant and animal deaths 
per cycle. These were controlled by the levels of the gasses.  For flora, 
the equation for death is (20 - CO2)^2. This equation graphs as a parabola 
which opens upward with the level of CO2 on the X-axis and the number of 
deaths on the Y-axis. The optimum level of CO2 was set at 20 parts per 
thousand, so at CO2 = 20, there are no plant deaths. The reasoning for 
this is that the farther away the CO2 gets from optimum levels, the more 
plants should occur, with this number growing at an exponential rate.  
Fauna deaths are set up in a similar fashion, except that the optimum level 
for O2 is put at 200 parts per thousand making the equation (200 - O2)^2.<p>
	The second model <IMG SRC="">replaces the reservoirs for CO2 and O2 with simple 
converters.  Instead of the gasses controlling the amount of death, they 
control the amount of life.  For mathematical purposes, the optimum levels 
for both Flora and Fauna were set at 20 parts per thousand.  The converters 
are graphs like the ones described above, only inverted.  The equation for 
the fauna is -(20 - O2)^2 + 400.  The equation for the flora is identical 
except that "CO2" is substituted for "O2".  These graphs are parabolas 
opening downward on a graph with the level of the gas on the X-axis and 
the amount of life on the Y-axis.  The maximum of both the curves is at 
(20,400) This means that when CO2 is at 20 parts per thousand, flora is 
at a maximum of 400 units, likewise, when O2 is at 20, fauna reaches a
 maximum of 400 units.  As the level of a gas fluctuates, the amount of life 
in the corresponding biosphere component will fluctuate in tandem.  The
 reasoning behind this is that the biosphere will have as much life as the 
environment will support.  If the atmospheric conditions become unfavorable,
 there will be less life as part of the biomass dies off.  If conditions 
improve, nature will expand the biomass to the level where the atmosphere
 can support no more life.  This relationship is analogous to the relationship
 between an animal and its food source.  The more food, the more animals, 
the less food, the less animals.<p>
	In both models, the four main components affected each other in a 
feedback loop.  A feedback loop is a relationship where one component in a 
system affects another component whose changes in turn come back and affect
 the first component.  Positive feedback is when the changes become larger
 with each cycle, negative feedback happens when the changes get smaller 
each turn. <P>
	When the first model is run with one of the gasses beginning the 
experiment at non-optimal levels, the error ripples through the system 
with a positive feedback loop forming in the gas levels. Eventually all 
of the plants and animals are killed due to the wild fluctuations in the 
gasses which dip and rise deeper into deadly areas with each DT.  The results 
for the second model are the opposite.  The error is slowly evened out as time
 passes leaving flora, fauna, O2, and CO2 in equilibrium.  This is a negative 
feedback loop.  If the gas values begin at equilibrium, and a disturbance is 
introduced later during the run such as a volcanic eruption adding large 
amounts of CO2 to the system, the system will correct itself and level 
off all of the values to a new equilibrium level over time.  The new equilibrium values 
are different than the originally values.  This process of negative feedback 
and "error" correction is the whole point of the Gaia hypothesis.  Gaia states 
that all of the processes on earth work together to create an environment 
suitable for life.  If an error is introduced into the earth, such as the 
meteor which killed the dinosaurs, Gaia will correct the problem and make 
conditions right for life again. <p>
	So which model is more accurate to real life?  Since the second 
model is the only one of the two which allows life to survive over an 
extended period of time, the relationships illustrated in it should be 
the correct ones.  This means that the gasses regulate the biosphere 
by setting a limit on the amount of life able to live on the planet, 
not by killing off the life when gas levels become unfavorable.<p>
	There are a few important things which must be addressed 
about the models.  There are many other factors which take gasses 
in and out of the atmosphere and plants and animals in and out of 
the biosphere than illustrated here.  Process such as the ocean's 
absorption of CO2, consumption of the flora by the fauna, CO2 from
 volcanoes, the affect of industrialization on the atmosphere, and 
the affect of non plant or animal life on the atmosphere all affect 
the system in one way or another.  For the sake of simplicity, these
 processes have been assumed to cancel each other out in the time scale
 dealt with in the model.  The input from these factors could change the
 results of the model.  Also, all of the numbers in the model have been 
fabricated.  There is the possibility that real data could also change 
the results of the model.  Finally, the second model is flawed in that 
if the initial levels for the gasses are set too far off of optimum values,
 the results will veer off into infinity.  It is not clear why this happens,
 but it only occurs when both the initial gas values are 15 to 20 parts per 
thousand more than optimum levels. <p>

The relationship between the vegetation on earth and the changes in planetary
 environment is based on the Gaia theory {1}. It states that the system is 
maintained through one or more negative feedback cycles.  The interaction 
between the amount of Carbon Dioxide and the mechanisms that control it are
 based on the input of CO2 from active sources {2}.  This is also based on the amount of oxygen 
in the atmosphere as well.  All of these controls of atmospheric gases are
 based on a long term time scale {3}.  The reasoning behind our connections between the amount of
 biota and the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere comes from long term
 vegetation migration {4}.  The 
interrelationship between the system and atmospheric O2 which is the biosphere 
as a driver for atmospheric change {5}.<p><p>

	Since the second model is the only one of the two which can show that it allows life to survive over an extended period of time, the relationships illustrated in it should be the correct ones.  In this model the gasses are a regulating factor of the biosphere by setting a limit on the amount of life able to live on the planet, rather than by killing off the life when gas levels become unfavorable, as in the first model.  It also shows that the Biosphere affects the gas concentrations.  The fact that we were able to recreate a negative feedback loop using actual factors, shows that this model supports the Gaia hypothesis.<p>

<H2><A NAME="Combining">Combining Long Term and Short Term Models</H2></A><p>

	To combine the short  and long term models, we 
decided to have the short term model, the one which man controls, affecting 
the long term model for a short period within its run-time. To do this, the 
short term model is transformed into a single input flow to the CO2 reservoir 
in the long term model. It is controlled by the time converter "clock". This 
coupling of models causes a jump in the new combined model <IMG SRC=""><BR><IMG SRC="">
which is corrected by the negative feedback loops present in the Gaian-like 
model. This helps to prove the Gaia theory of the planet.  However, if the jump 
in CO2 increases to much, the model (Gaia) cannot correct for it.<p>
<p>

Although the short term model was based on a simple mathematical equation, it mimicked the graph of real data obtained for CO2 almost identically and provided an excellent way to include the anthroposphere in the long term model. The long term model represented accurately the idea behind negative feedback loops and the basic supports of the Gaia hypothesis. It was not, however, close to proving or disproving the Gaia hypothesis because of its lack of basis in real life (none of the numbers contained in it were real and it followed laws, created by Stella, different from the earth's). It also only represented a small, but important, portion of the earth system. The combined model demonstrated the view made by this project superbly. It showed how a "Gaia" system could correct for a relatively small disturbance in the earth system but could not correct for a disturbance which pushed members of the system passed their tolerable limits. For example, if CO2 increased to greatly, flora could not "absorb" enough to correct for the problem.<BR>
Overall, the models proved the hypothesis that, in short term processes, the system is relatively non-Gaian, while, in long term systems, the different parts of the earth system interacted more. The combination model provided a new twist. It showed how, if the balance in the earth system was tipped to greatly, Gaia might not be able to stabilize it soon enough to save itself.

<title>Background</title>
<H1> Hydrosphere/Biosphere Interactions</H1><p>
<IMG SRC=""><p>
Our Home, the Earth<p>
The Earth is in a precarious position in the solar 
system with the star that some people speculate gave birth to it
 growing hotter and more intense. While the sun is becoming more 
intense, the Earth's distance from the sun is not changing.  The result 
is more solar radiation reaching the earth.  Fortunately there are two
 built in systems for temperature regulation on this planet of liquid 
surface, silicate rocks, atmospheric carbon dioxide, and life: the carbon 
organic and carbon-silicate burial systems.  These two systems, through 
chemical reactions, take carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere and deposit 
it into the planet. The carbon organic burial system deposits carbon dioxide 
into the planet as organic matter and the carbon-silicate burial system
 deposits it in the form of limestone or quartz.<p>
The reason that 
the removal of carbon dioxide is such an effective means of regulating
 temperature is due to the fact that Carbon Dioxide is a Greenhouse gas.  
Even though carbon dioxide allows solar radiation into the earth's atmosphere, 
 it prevents solar radiation from leaving the atmosphere making the planet
 hotter.  To that end, the more carbon dioxide there is, the warmer the
 planet becomes; likewise, the less there is in the atmosphere, the more 
solar radiation leaves the Earth cooling the planet.  It is so powerful 
a system that it was the regulation of carbon dioxide through the two
 burial systems that kept the Earth from freezing over in the beginning 
when the sun was approximately 70% as bright as it is now(Worsley, Thomas; 
Nance, Damian; and Moody, Judith  1991).<p>
The way that these burial 
systems work is that they take carbon dioxide that is constantly being 
offgased by the planet out of the atmosphere at different rates, hence by
 taking less than is "normal" the carbon dioxide goes up, the planet heats,
 and by taking more than "normal" the carbon dioxide goes down and the planet
 can cool.<p>
The oceans are the dominant sink for anthropogenic carbon 
dioxide emissions (Lashof, D. 1991 ); however, carbon dioxide is less soluble
 in warmer waters.  According to Lovelock and Margulis, the Gaia Hypothesis 
assumes the existence of a biological mechanism for stabilizing climate.  
A possible mechanism for stabilizing sea surface temperature is the marine
 sulfur cycle.  The marine sulfur cycle cools the temperature of the ocean
 surface by means of a negative feedback mechanism.  With the surface 
temperature lowered, the ocean should be able to store more carbon dioxide
 thereby reducing the global warming attributed by the greenhouse effect
.<p>This report describes the marine sulfur cycle and the effects
 of the cycle on the surface temperature of the ocean.

<H2>Combining the Models</H2><p><p>
With models for interactions between the atmosphere/hydrosphere and biosphere in hand, our next goal was to create a model which combined them. To do this, the models had to be compatible both in the time scales in which they run and in the parts of the earth system which they include. The Hydrosphere/Biosphere's model  runs over less than a hundred years. The biodiversity model runs best over 4 years but is capable of adapting to other time scales. The combined short term and long term model of atmosphere/biosphere interactions, unfortunately, runs over 100 thousands of years and is totally unadaptable and incompatible with the other two because of both the time scale and the theoretical nature of the model. Because of this problem with the long term atmo/bio model, it was decided to use the short term atm/bio model. The short term model is a pure mathematical representation of the amount of CO2 concentration increase over the past 33 years as a result of the antrophosphere. This model provides an extra variable, mainly the burning of fossil fuels, to the other two and thus forces their CO-2 to rise.<p>

The biodiversity model <IMG SRC="">was used as a hub to combine the models. The short term atmosphere/biosphere model <IMG SRC="">affected the biodiversity model by increasing the amount of vegetation (trees) in the three regions it includes, Desert, Deciduous, and Tropical. The effect of the increase in CO2 was lessened to adapt its time scale to the biodiversity model's time scale. The hydrosphere model, <IMG SRC="">, effected the biodiversity model in the amount of rain calculated by its model. This value affected the amount of water in the biodiversity model which, consequently, affected the amount of vegetation (trees). When the combined model<IMG SRC=""> is run it produces the graph <IMG SRC="">.<p>
The wave motion is a result of the sinwave which helps to graph the amount of CO2 increase in the atmosphere model and the rain output of the hydrosphere model. Do to the persistent increase in CO2 by the atmosphere model, the graph rises exponentially until going off the scale. This could be interpreted as "bust" from the "boom and bust" idea which states that the earth goes intervals of stability which are interrupted by global catastrophes. This particular bust, a result of massive increases in CO2, would be created by humanity.<BR>
Although this model does not include a fraction of the parts of the real earth system, it can provide a basis for further study and a shell which can be added on to or taken apart and reconfigured.<p><p>

<FONT SIZE="+3">T</FONT>he sun is the primary driver for the earth's 
weather and climate. However, it is the earth system which regulates and 
stabilizes this constant influx of energy from the sun. The 'earth 
system' consists of many subsystems which include the atmosphere, 
biosphere, geosphere, etc. Additionally, these subsystems are made up of 
an infinite amount of variables which control our environment.<p>

The earth's atmosphere is constantly bombarded with a shortwave energy 
flux of about 1368 W/m^2. Because of the spherical nature of the Earth 
and the fact that it rotates, only about 342 W/m^2 of this incident solar 
flux is received by the Earth. The Earth's albedo immediately reflects 
approximately 32 percent of this energy into space. The rest is absorbed 
and is eventually re-emitted back into space as longwave radiation. The 
amount of energy in the earth system must be at equilibrium for the 
average climate across the planet to be stable. This means that the 
amount of energy that comes into the system must eventually come out. If 
a factor in the earth system were to destroy this balance between 
in-going and out-going (i.e. hold to much energy in), then the climate 
would be affected (probably negatively).<p>

The threat of a drastic change in climate makes the study of earth 
processes very important to humanity's long-term survival. To understand 
large-scale processes, like the earth energy budget, the individual 
sub-processes which make up the big process must first be defined and 
understood. The atmosphere has been a main focus of study in the earth 
energy budget because its affects on global climate are the most powerful 
on timescales of decades to centuries (human timescales).Additionally, 
the presence of feedback cycles which could amplify or negate the affect 
of a change in an earth system variable must also be included in the 
study of individual subsystem processes.<p>

Clouds provide both a warming and cooling effect on the earth system. Low 
lying clouds tend to warm the earth by re-radiating energy back to the 
earth surface while higher clouds increase the earth's overall albedo 
causing a cooling effect. The shortwave and longwave components of clouds 
radiative forcing are about 10 times that of CO2 doubling*1. A relatively 
small rise in cloud formation would affect the climate more than a 
doubling in CO2. Currently, the realized effect of cloud change is 
greatly misunderstood and must be studied in order to predict and be 
ready for a global climatic change. Weather an increase in cloud 
formation would result in a global increase in temperature or a global 
decrease in temperature is unknown and is key to the understanding of the 
earth energy budget as whole.<p>

This project seeks to take one variable of the earth energy budget, 
clouds, and model the key variables that effect it and predict its effect 
on the earth energy system as a whole. It will use the cloud-related 
variables cloud cover fraction, optical thickness, and cloud pressure to 
predict what type of effect will be reflected in the surface temperature 
for the time and place studied. A quantitative model will then try to 
mimic these values. From these data, a net trend will be recorded and 
compared to the following hypothesis.<p>

<FONT SIZE="+3">S</FONT>unlight provides most of the energy that drives 
biological, geochemical, and geophysical processes on Earth.*1  It is 
part of a spectrum of electromagnetic radiation, defined as energy 
transmitted by rapidly oscillating waves that are both electronic and 
magnetic; and it follows a basic relationship represented in the equation 
FREQUENCY=SPEED/WAVELENGTH, where wavelength is the characteristic 
distance between two wave crests, frequency is the number of wavelengths 
passing a given point in one second (with units: number per second), and 
speed is constant at 300 million meters per second.*2<p><p>

Insolation, incoming solar radiation, is in the form of ultraviolet and 
visible electromagnetic radiation (200 to 400 nanometers).*3 At the top 
of the atmosphere, the planet receives, on average, approximately 1396 
Watts per meter squared; this we call the solar constant.  About 25% of 
this incoming radiation is absorbed  within the atmosphere, therefore 
incorporated in the atmosphere's internal energy, increasing its mean 
temperature.*2  This quantity of absorbed radiation can be attributed 
primarily to ozone in the stratosphere (3%), and clouds (5%) and water 
vapor(17%) in the troposphere.*1<p><p>

Slightly less than 30% of insolation is scattered or reflected by the 
atmosphere, a trait known as albedo.  Chiefly involved in this occurrence 
for the time and place stuis reflection by clouds (@19%), backscattering 
by air molecules and particles in the air (6%), and reflection by the 
surface of the planet (3%).  The remaining 47% of ultraviolet radiation 
is absorbed at the Earth's surface.*1<p>

The Earth does lose energy by conduction (direct transfer of energy by 
the collision of molecules) and by convection (heat energy exchange by 
fluids in motion).  At the same time, like all objects, the Earth 
radiates energy, albeit at a lower frequency and in much smaller amounts 
than the sun.*2  This is in the form of infrared radiation, with 
wavelengths greater than 750 nanometers.*1  The planet undoubtedly 
radiates as much energy as it receives, sustaining a constant average 
temperature, in what is called Radiative Equilibrium.*2  In the process 
of heat transfers, a little over half of all surface insolation is 
converted into latent heat; 18% is radiated back into space; and the 
remainder is captured by the atmosphere, in what is inaccurately named 
the Greenhouse Effect.*1<p>

The Atmosphere, like the Earth, retains a constant temperature - though 
certainly not uniform.  Most radiation absorbed by the Atmosphere is in 
the form of longwave (infrared) radiation from the Earth.  The 
Atmosphere, in turn, radiates the same sort of longwave radiation in all 
directions.  This, dubbed the Atmospheric Effect, results in an average 
planetary temperature that is approximately 32 degrees Celsius higher 
than that of an Earth without an atmosphere.  The chief gases involved in 
this process are Water Vapor, Carbon Dioxide, Nitrous Oxide, and Methane; 
clouds also absorb a considerable amount of longwave radiation from the 
Earth.*2<p>

Of the four regions of the Atmosphere, the troposphere and the 
stratosphere are most significant for climate and life.*1  These can be 
viewed according to their thermal organization.*4  The troposphere is 
heated from below, and because of radiative and convective processes, 
temperature decreases with altitude, more dramatically above the tropics, 
to about -50 degrees Celsius at the tropopause (the upper tropospheric 
boundary).  Thenceforth, and up to a height of about 50 kilometers 
(roughly at the stratopause), the temperature increases due to acute 
absorption of ultraviolet and infrared radiation by stratospheric 
ozone.*1<p>

Seasons are chiefly caused by the tilt of the Earth's axis of rotation 
with respect to the plane of its orbit - the ecliptic. The obliquity of 
the ecliptic, as it is called, measures 23.5 degrees and remains fixed in 
spatial orientation.  The Summer Solstice (June 22) occurs when the North 
Pole is most directly oriented towards the sun; Winter Solstice (December 
22) entails the opposite.  During the Solstices, the sun's elevation is 
at a maximum, and the day is the year's longest, in each respective 
hemisphere.  On the Autumnal (September 23) and Vernal (March 21) 
Equinoxes, daylengths and sun elevations are once again equal in the two 
hemispheres.*2<p>

Seasonal and latitudinal variations in the heating of the Earth by the 
sun incur motions called weather.*5  Pole-to-pole variation in outgoing 
longwave radiation is more uniform than incoming shortwave radiation; as 
a result, there is a radiative deficit at higher latitudes and a relative 
abundance in the tropics; winds and ocean currents provide heat 
exchange.*2  Climate is the sum of weather and its seasonal variations, 
and clouds are associated with changes in weather.*5  Clouds are the 
primary modulator of energy motions between the sun, the Earth's surface, 
and energy flow back into space, and thus play a significant role in the 
planet's energy budget.*6  <p>

To make measurements of energy emitted and reflected by the Earth, the 
Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE) was launched in the mid-1980s.  
It consists of three satellites: one Earth Radiation Budget Satellite 
(ERBS) at a 57-degree inclination, and two sun-synchronous NOAA 
spacecraft.*7  Consisting of both scanning and nonscanning radiometers, 
ERBE instruments provide high-resolution regional-scale measurements used 
in contemporary data analysis and long-term, continent-scale monitoring 
of the radiation budget.  ERBE measurements include albedo, longwave 
emissions, and net radiation.  Such  aspects as diurnal and latitudinal 
variations of cloud forcing,  and zonal measurements of cloud albedo, 
generally increasing with latitude owing to the solar zenith angle 
effect, are studied.*7  With the efforts of ERBE, it has been established 
that clouds have a generally cooling effect on the current global 
climate.*6<p>

The World Climate Research Program (WCRP) met the importance of 
understanding the role of clouds in the radiative balances of the Earth 
by initiating the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project 
(ISCCP) in 1982.  The distinction between "clear", surface pixels and 
"cloudy" ones in ISCCP images is governed by three assumptions: 1) clouds 
cause more spatial variation of infrared and visible radiation than the 
surface, 2) clouds cause more variation of infrared and visible radiation 
in time than the surface, and 3) clouds are colder (less infrared 
radiation emitted into space) and brighter (more solar radiation 
reflected to space) than the surface.  The primary limitation of ISCCP 
measurements is the neglecting of possible cloud "layering", which could 
alter quantification of total cloud amount; overall, ISCCP successfully 
executes the analyses of such aspects of cloud orientation as long-scale 
amount variations, diurnal cycling, seasonal variations, storm systems, 
and long-scale variations of radiative elements propagated by clouds.*7 
ISCCP divides the globe into "cells" of equal area to better catalogue 
incoming satellite data and to provide a easier way to access the data 
(using an"HDFtoASCII" conversion software).  Compiled from two different 
kinds of satellites (sun-synchronous polar orbiters and geostationary 
satellites), ISCCP images are made at 600 (visible) and 1100 (infra-red) 
nanometers, wavelengths to which the atmosphere is virtually transparent 
and which are primarily influenced by the properties of clouds and the 
Earth's surface.  The only two properties of clouds and surface, 
corresponding to the two wavelengths used in measuring them, are visible 
radiation reflectances (reported in terms of optical thickness) and 
infrared temperatures (reported in terms of temperature and, for clouds, 
top pressure or altitude).  From this, six primary quantities are 
produced: cloud top pressure, cloud temperature, cloud optical thickness, 
surface temperature, surface visible reflectance, and the total number of 
pixels representing clouds, a quantity labeled 'cloud amount'.<p>

Cloud coverage decreases with lower cloud temperature and pressure; his 
translates to mean that clouds at higher altitudes cover a 
proportionately smaller planet surface area.  Furthermore, cloud coverage 
increases with higher optical thickness; his means that lower, more 
reflective clouds cover a proportionately larger planet surface area.  
There is a direct correlation between cloud top temperature/pressure  and 
cloud optical thickness, having established the identity between cloud 
top temperature and cloud top pressure.  From these satellite 
observations, and ignoring the effects of other atmospheric components, 
it can be established that clouds have an overall cooling effect in the 
Earth's energy budget.<p>

<A NAME="Modeling"><H3>Modeling</H3></A>

<FONT SIZE="+3">T</FONT>he primary goal of the STELLA model was to 
properly simulate the earth's energy budget using quantitative cloud 
cover and sea surface temp on CD ROM. The model was based on a model of 
the Earth's Radiation Budget  created by Arthur Few. His model primarily 
focused on a Earth system that contained only an ocean and lacked both 
land and atmosphere. After completing the simulation of Few's model of 
the earth which contained only an ocean, the next step was to create a 
model which simulated the Earth's Energy Budget which possessed an 
atmosphere. The goal of the model was to simulate the earth energy budget 
and to integrate clouds to prove our hypothesis that: Clouds cause a 
cooling effect on the earth.<p>
	The model originates as a reservoir <IMG 
SRC=""> representing Earth's Energy which has 
two flows <IMG SRC=""> representing the solar 
short-wave radiation to earth and the long-wave infrared radiation to 
space. These two flows are in turn effected by converters <IMG 
SRC=""> representing Albedo, Solar constant, 
Earth diameter, Sea Temp and Stefan Boltzmann constant which created the 
basic model of the ERB containing only an ocean.<p>
<IMG SRC=""><p>
	 An atmosphere model similar to the Earth Energy Budget model was 
created using a form similar to the Arthur Few ERB model. After creating 
the atmospheric model, the two models were incorporated by a relationship 
that is represented by outflows Atmosphere to Surface and Infrared to 
Atmosphere <IMG SRC="">. This particular 
model basically contains two separate models of Arthur Few's original 
energy budget. <p>
	The flows that interconnect the atmosphere and the earth are both 
affected with numerous converters <IMG 
SRC="">. The flow from the atmosphere to the 
surface is affected by the Stefan Boltzmann constant, the Earth's 
Diameter, Atmosphere absorption coefficient, and the atmospheric temp. 
The atmospheric absorption coefficient <IMG 
SRC=""> determines the amount of radiation 
the atmosphere can hold, while the atmospheric temp implies the when the 
atmosphere reaches a certain temp, it no longer absorbs radiation at the 
same rate. The Earth's Diameter determines the area in which the 
radiation strikes the earth and the Stefan Boltzmann constant is a 
numerical value which establishes a relationship between radiation and 
temperature.<p>
The flow of Infrared radiation to the atmosphere incorporates all of the 
aspects that the flow from the atmosphere possesses. However, the only 
difference is that the earth's temperature is used instead of the 
temperature of the atmosphere. When creating the model the temperatures 
of both the atmosphere and the Earth were determined by a relationship, 
shown in the model, between the heat capacity and the amount of energy 
<IMG SRC=""><p>
<ul>(Earth Temp. = Earth Energy/Earth Heat Capacity). </ul><p>
	The most recent version of the model incorporates clouds in order to 
prove our hypothesis that clouds cause a cooling effect on the earth 
because of the effect it has on the earth's energy budget. The affect 
clouds have on the system are evident in the atmosphere absorption 
coefficient. Cloud fraction, cloud optical depth and pressure are all 
aspects which contribute to the negative cooling effect on the Earth 
energy budget. Cloud pressure affect the absorption coefficient as the 
pressure varies. As the cloud pressure rises the greater the reflectivity 
of the atmosphere and the absorption increases as the pressure decreases 
shown in the equation <p>
<ul><u>	Atm_Ab_Coef_Now+(1-Atm_Ab_Coef_Now)*</u> 	
<u>(Cloud_Fraction+Cloud_Optical_Depth/(Cloud_Pressure/100)).</u></ul><p> 
The cloud optical depth affects the atmospheric absorption by creating a 
greater depth of area in which the infrared radiation must pass through. 
These aspects affect the atmospheric absorption coefficient which in turn 
affects the albedo and the input to and from the atmosphere. Data was 
obtained for cloud fraction, optical depth and pressure in order to 
quantify the model to its extent and upon conclusion of the model, run 
the simulation and compare the results to temperature data received for 
the same area.<p>
	The completed model <IMG SRC="">; however possesses 
many limitations and restricts the model to simulate only one region of 
the earth. There is also a lack of aspects that are essential to the 
proper function. At the present time there seems to be a mechanical error 
in the Earth's atmosphere. The missing factors cause the model to 
function improperly and tainting the results. Due to the mechanical 
error, the model was unable to obtain the expected results and is now 
undergoing evaluation in order to find this error.<p>

<A NAME="Data & Data Analysis"><H3>Data & Data Analysis</H3></A>

<FONT SIZE="+3">T</FONT>here are a number of variables which effect 
whether the clouds in the sky will warm or cool (or neither) the surface 
of the earth. It is common knowledge that high altitude clouds generally 
exhibit a warming trend on the earth surface because they re-radiate more 
energy to the earth then they reflect back to space. Additionally, low 
lying clouds are thought to produce a cooling effect on the surface 
because they greatly increase the albedo of the earth's surface with 
little or no re-radiation. There is not a simple gauge, however, that can 
tell whether a cloud is high or low. Nor, for that matter, is there a 
simple two-category scale for cloud classification. There is a whole 
range of altitudes that a cloud can 'float' in. The atmospheric variable 
that is used to calculate cloud height is pressure. The pressure scale 
for the data in this report goes from about 1000 (low clouds) to about 
400 milibars(high clouds).<p>

Another variable which determines a clouds effects is optical depth or 
thickness. Optical depth tells how much content there is in a cloud body. 
Simply, it is how thick the cloud is. An optically thicker cloud will 
absorb more or reflect more (depending on if it is a high or low cloud) 
then a very 'thin' or 'clear' cloud will.<p>

Perhaps the most important variable included in this study was cloud 
fraction. It is simply the fraction of cloud cover in the sky; a hundred 
percent being a cloud-full sky and zero percent being a totally clear 
sky. As you can see, determining whether a cloud will cool or warm the 
surface of the earth in a day, month, or year is not as easy as finding 
out whether a cloud is high or low, thick or thin, or numerous or scarce. 
It involves studying all these data and then predicting, with the data as 
a base, whether the clouds will cool or warm. Then, these 'predictions' 
can be compared to actual surface temperature data.<p>


Below are two graphs which chart these three variables over one year. 
They are both <i>monthly ISCCP data for 1986</i> and are from two 
different points on the globe (cell 4373 and 5409 respectively. ISCCP 
divides the globe into cells of equal area) The two locations are on the 
sea to reflect that the model used to mimic these data will simulate an 
earth completely covered with water. Below each of the graphs is a table 
of predicted surface temperature changes as a result of the variables 
graphed. The "Prediction Table" is measured from one to ten and measures 
what type of effect the clouds in each month will have from the three 
base variables (see key for ranges).<p>

<p>
<BLINK>Note:</BLINK>The data below do not have completely compatible 
units so some were multiplied to better display their relationship to one 
another. <BR>
<IMG SRC=""><BR>
<IMG SRC=""><BR>
<IMG SRC=""><P>

According to the "Prediction Tables" (which are really just guesses of 
the culmination of the variables), clouds cool more than they warm 
although most of the values illustrate no effect (near 5 - equal warming 
and cooling with no effect). The next step is to compare these data with 
actual surface temperature data. The GEDEX (Greenhouse Effect Defection 
Experiment) <i>Monthly Gridded In-situ/AVHRR Blended Sea Surface 
Temperature (CACSST_B)</i> was used for this.

The two graphs below show the GEDEX surface temperature data along with 
the "predicted" values.

<p>
<BLINK>Note:</BLINK>The Key from above applies here too.<BR>
<IMG SRC=""><BR>
<IMG SRC=""><P>

Although there seems to be some cloud-temperature correlation, the 
variations in heat temperature for graph three could be attributed to 
seasonal variations in ocean temperature. Cell 4737 (Graph 3) is located 
only 20 degrees north of the equator which explains its minimal variation 
in temperature from season to season. Graph 4 likewise illustrates how 
the clouds have seemingly no effect on surface temperature. Cell 5409 
(Graph 4) is located about 40 degrees north of the equator which explains 
its greater seasonal variation in temperature.<p>

The images below compare graph the three cloud variables and GEDEX 
surface temperature.

<A NAME="Conclusions"><H3>Conclusions</H3></A><p>

Although the predictions of surface temperature reaction to atmospheric 
clouds suggested a net cooling effect, the temperature data show no 
response to supposed cloud activity. Clearly either clouds have no effect 
or the data obtained does not provide a good representation for these 
effects. The latter seems much more likely. Therefore, the obvious next 
step would be to expand data location to more places and to compare data 
from different years. If the "predicted values" are relied on instead of 
the actual GEDEX data, a presumption that clouds produce a net cooling 
effect can be concluded but cannot be proved.<p>

The Stella model illustrates the basic earth radiation budget but does 
not accurately reflect clouds effect on the system. Additionally, a 
better system for incorporating real life data must be created for the 
Stella model.(more as it comes in)<p>

Overall, this project has proved its hypothesis to be more than simply a 
guess and has displayed information to verify it. There is, however, a 
need for expansion (data) and a better model in order for the hypothesis 
to be proven.<p>



<BLINK>Note:</BLINK>A new Conclusions section will be written after the 
Stella model is fixed. Set Date: Afternoon Jan 17.<p>

<h2>Experts Confirm Human Role in Global Warming</h2>

<b>By William K. Stevens, The Washington Post, September 13, 1995.</b><p>


       In an important shift of scientific judgment, experts advising the 
world's governments on climate change are saying for the first time that 
human activity is a likely cause of the warming of the global 
atmosphere.<BR>
<DD>       While many climatologists have thought this to be the case, 
all but a few have held until now that the climate is so naturally 
variable that they could not be sure they were seeing a clear signal of 
the feared greenhouse effect - the heating of the atmosphere because of 
the carbon dioxide released by burning coal, oil and wood.<BR>
<DD>       Even the string of very warm years in the 1980s and 1990s 
could have been just a natural swing of the climatic pendulum, the 
experts have said. <BR>
<DD>       But a growing body of data and analysis now suggests that the 
warming of the last century, and especially of the last few years, "is 
unlikely to be entirely due to natural causes and that a pattern of 
climatic response to human activities is identifiable in the 
climatological record," says a draft summary of a new report by the 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.<BR>
<DD>       The panel's role is to advise governments now negotiating 
reductions in emissions of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide under the 
1992 treaty on climate change.<BR>
<DD>       The panel's draft summary, although intended for international 
use, was recently made available on the Internet. The draft has been 
through at least one round of scientific review but its wording may 
change, since it is now being reviewed by governments. Scientists who 
prepared the full chapter on which the summary statement is based say 
they do not expect any substantial change in their basic assessment. The 
chapter has gone through extensive review by scientists around the 
world.<BR>
<DD>       "I think the scientific justification for the statement is 
there, unequivocally." said Dr. Tom M.L. Wigley, a climatologist at the 
National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo., one of the 
chapter's authors. <BR>
<DD>       The scientific community "has discovered the smoking gun," 
said Dr. Michael Oppenheimer, an atmospheric scientist with the 
Environmental Defense Fund, who is familiar with the draft report. "This 
finding is of paramount importance. For many years, policy makers have 
asked, 'Where's the signal?'" The intergovernmental panel, he said "is 
telling us that the signal is here."<p>

<DD>       But Dr. Wigley and others involved in the reassessment say it 
is not yet known how much of the last century's warming can be attributed 
to human activity and how muck is part of the earth's natural fluctuation 
that leads to ice ages at one extreme and warm periods at the other.<BR>
<DD>       Nevertheless, the panel's conclusion marks a watershed in the 
views of climatologists, who with the notable exception of Dr. James E. 
Hanson of the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York have 
until now refused to declare publicly that they can discern the signature 
of the greenhouse effect. <br>
<DD>       The new consensus, as represented by the intergovernmental 
panel, seems likely to stimulate more public debate over how seriously 
the threat of climate change should be taken.<BR>
 <DD>      As for the future, the draft summary forecasts an increase in 
the average global temperature of 1.44 degrees to 6.3 degrees Fahrenheit 
by the year 2100 if there is not further action to curb emissions of 
greenhouse gases. But that represents only 50 to 70 percent of the 
eventual warming, it says. These changes would be more rapid than any in 
the last 10,000 years, the period in which civilization developed, the 
panel says.<BR>
<DD>       And it says that whatever action is taken in the future, the 
world still faces a further average temperature increase of 1 to 3.6 
degrees.<BR>
<DD>       By comparison, according to varying estimates, the average 
global temperature is 5 to 9 degrees warmer now than in the last ice 
age.<BR>
<DD>       While a warmer world could be beneficial in some ways, the 
draft says there would be many adverse effects. These include more 
extreme tropical storms, destruction of some communities by rising seas, 
damage to and loss of natural ecosystems that cannot adapt rapidly 
enough, diminished agricultural output in some places and an increase in 
some tropical diseases.<br>
<DD>       Experts agree that the average surface temperature of the 
globe has already risen about 1 degree Fahrenheit in the last century, 
but there has long been debate over the cause.<BR>
<DD>       Much of the argument has involved the computerized models of 
the atmosphere that have been climatologists' main tools in analyzing the 
warming problem. The models have many imperfections, but the panel 
scientists say they have improved and are being used more effectively. 
<BR>
<DD>       Scientists say that a major reason for the change in view 
marked by the new report, in fact, is that a new generation of studies 
has enhanced their confidence in computer simulations of the atmosphere, 
creating a much better agreement between predicted patterns of climate 
change and those actually observed.<BR>
<DD>       One study in particular, led by Dr. Benjamin B. Santer of the 
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, found a good match between the 
temperature differences from region to region predicted by computerized 
simulation of the atmosphere's response to increased carbon dioxide and 
those actually measured. <BR>
<DD>       Dr. Santer is also an author of the intergovernmental panel's 
chapter on causes of the warming along with Dr. Wigley, Dr. Tim P. 
Barnett of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at La Jolla, Calif., 
and Dr. Ebby Anyamba, a Kenyan scientist currently at the NASA Goddard 
Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md.  Twenty-seven other scientists 
contributed to the chapter.<BR>
<DD>       The new generation of computer modeling studies employs more 
detailed and sophisticated representations of the atmosphere than when 
the intergovernmental panel made its first assessment of the climate 
problem in 1990. Scientists confidence in the results of the comparisons 
between there would be many model predictions and observations has been 
boosted by more powerful statistical techniques used to validate the 
comparison between model predictions and observations, Dr. Wigley 
said.<BR>
<DD>       Despite the new consensus among panel scientists, some 
skeptics, like Dr. Richard S. Lindzen of the Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology, remain unconvinced. <BR>
<DD>       Dr. Lindzen said the panel's identification of the greenhouse 
signal "depends on the model estimate of natural variability being 
correct" - that is, the natural variability of the climate system on time 
scales of decades and centuries. The computer models do not reflect this 
well, he said, and therefore there is "not basis" yet for saying that a 
human influence on the climate has been detected.<BR>
<DD>       Political views on climate change are considerably more 
diverse than those of the panel experts. Negotiations to reduce carbon 
dioxide emissions have been going on since they were begun in April by 
the parties to the climate treaty, but they are inching along. One reason 
has been the lack of scientific proof that human activities are 
responsible for the warming. <BR>
<DD>       The Clinton Administration supports some reductions, while not 
specifying what kind or how much. But the ascendancy of conservatives in 
Congress has strengthened the hand of those who oppose reductions, mainly 
the fossil-fuel and related industries.

<font size=2> Changes in Time in the Temperature of the Earth</font></h2>

</center>

Natural variability in the climate system is most often visualized in 
terms of the average temperature of the atmosphere near the surface of 
the earth, ideally for the planet as a whole.  Continuous records of 
surface temperature sampled sufficiently over the globe to allow 
reconstructions of global or hemispheric averages reach back but allow 
reconstructions of global or hemispheric averages reach back out about a 
hundred years, although histories of about twice that span are available 
for specific stations where the longest records were kept.<P>
<DD> Reconstructions of the longer history of past variations of surface 
temperature are obtained through the chemical analyses of dated sediments 
of various kinds, and as such are themselves regionally or even site 
specific.  One of the challenges of global change research is to improve 
upon what is known of past changes in temperature of the earth as a 
function of space and time.<P>
<DD>A compilation representative of what is known today is shown in this 
set of graphs, which portray a sampling of estimated surface temperatures 
through the last 180 million years of earth history.<P>
<DD>They are arranged counterclockwise from upper left in ever more 
recent eras and with greater and greater expansion of the time scale, as 
through a zoom lens.  The portion delineated by a dashed line at the 
right edge of each of the first five graphs is expanded in the graph 
following it.  Temperatures shown are in degrees Celsius (1 degree 
C=about 2 degree F), in most cases as a departure from the mean value at 
the turn of the present century of about 15 degree C (59 degree F).  The 
vertical scale varies, expanding about 15 times between the first and 
last figures.<P>

<B>1.)</B>  Mean global temperature through the last 180 million years, 
derived from oxygen isotope analyse of various marine and terrestrial 
deposits (from L.A. Frakes, <I>Climates Through Geologic Time</I>, 
Elsevier, Amsterdam, 1979). The present (ca. 1900) condition, for 
reference, is shown as a solic horizontal line. Of note are (1) a global 
cooling trend since the time of the Cretaceous, when global surface 
temperatures were 8- l 0C warmer than today, and (2) the onset of a 
continuing series of sleeper, periodic glacial/ interglacial oscillations 
in the latest, Quaternary period. Also shown (between dashed horizontal 
lines) is the range of modeled surface temperature based on a doubling of 
atmospheric CO2, projecting an increase from present values of about 2-5 
degree C (from T.J. Crowley, Joumal of Climate 3, 1282-1292, 1990).  Note 
that a different linear time scale is used for each of the three geologic 
divisions.<P>

<B>2.)</B>  Surface temperature through the last 850,000 years, derived w 
from measurements of the ratio of <font size=-2>16</font>0  to <font 
size=-2>18</font>0 in fossil plankton which had settled to the sea floor 
and were recovered in a deepsea core from the equatorial Pacific Ocean 
(from N.J. Shackleton and N. Opdyke, Quaternary Research 3, 3'3-55, 
1973). The changes mainly reflect variations in global ice volume;  the 
scale used here was added to show schematicaly the probable associated 
changes in global average surface temperature, based on a model-derived 
difference of 4-6degreeC between full glacial and full interglacial 
conditions (from W.C. Clark, Carbon Dioxide Review, 
Oxford University Press, New York, 1982). The reference line at
15degree C corresponds to surface temperatures of the modern era. The
glacial/interglacial oscillations, characteristic of the Pleistocene
epoch, are now thought to be induced by periodic variations in the
orbit of the earth and in its axis of inclination (the Milankovitch
effect), which act together to bring about systematic changes in the
seasonal distribution of sunlight over the surface of the planet.<P>

<b>3.)</b> Air temperature over Antarctica, expressed as a difference 
from the modern surface temperature value. These estimates are derived 
from hydrogen/deuterium ratios measured in an ice core from the Vostok 
station in Antarctica (from J. Jouzel et al., Nature 329, 403 408, 1987). 
Of note are the present (Holocene) and the preceding, somewhat warmer 
"Eemian" interglacial periods, each characterized by a rapid onset to an 
Early interglacial maximum temperature, and a subsequent slower decline. 
The glacial period between, called the Wiscons in glaciation in the 
Americas, is itself characterized by signific ant variations in 
temperature that fall systematically to a co dest extreme (maximum 
glaciation) about 20,000 years before the present (B.P.).<P>

<h4>Atmospheric Trace GasesThat Are Radiatively Active and of Significance 
to Global Change</h4><P>

The chemistry of the earth's atmosphere is a primary determinant in 
fixing the surface temperature and the conditions for life in general.  
Although the atmosphere is composed almost entirely of molecular nitrogen 
and oxygen, other gases that are present in only trace amounts exert 
significant effects, through active roles in the transferof radiation 
throught the air.  The concentrations of many of the most active of these 
are changing rapidly, due to human activities.  Here, for readers of 
<I>EarthQuest</i>, is a current summary: the first of a planned series of 
encapsulated information on selected earth science issues.<P>

<B><I>Notes:</i></b><BR>
* The lifetime of CO2  in the atmosphere is calculated in two ways: one, 
which is relatively short (ten years), is the residence time of a singel 
molecule before dissociation; more relevant to global change is the 
longer period that imcludes the residentce time in the atmosphere-ocean 
system: the time that a CO2 molecule derived from foddil fuel remains in 
the atmosphere-ocean system before being sequestered as terrestrial humus 
or deep-sea dediment.  The latter is of greater value in calculating 
future scenarios related to greenhouse warming since it reflects the 
relaxation time between a cessation of all industrialized CO2 emissions 
and the expected detection of a global decrease in pCO2 (the pressure of 
CO2).<P>

and Laing's text, explain why there are seasons on planet  
Earth and how they work.  <P>

3. Whereas the axis of the Earth is tilted 23.5 degrees from the line
perpendicular to the plane of the ecliptic, the axis of planet Uranus is
titled about eighty degrees:  the planet's axis is almost in line with 
the
plane of the ecliptic.  In addition, Uranus revolves on its axis in the
opposite direction than the Earth and other planets. Describe how these
facts affect the seasons on planet Uranus.

patterns, trends,  <BR>
   <DD> exceptions and propose possible explanations,<BR>
d) compare the thirty year record with the global average.<p>

<B>Retrieve Data </b><BR>
Use Netscape to access the ESSC website in order to retrieve temperature 
data.  Select Data, then Data for Investigations, then, The Earth System. 
The <a href="136.htm">Visual 
Data Browser</a> will allow you to view plots of temperature data from 
all of the different cities in the ESS community.  Begin by looking at 
temperatures for Washington, D.C. over the past thirty years.  Look at 
the five year interval plots of DC temperature.<P>

<B>Make a Time-Series Graph</b><BR>
D.C. Time-Series: Select download the data  to see a table containing the 
thirty years of data for DC.  Copy the table, open a window for MS Word 
and past the data there.  Insert tabs in the space between the columns, 
save the file, copy it and drop it into the top left corner cell of MS 
Excel.  Use chart wizard function to make a plot of the entire thirty 
year period: select a chart type, set axes, title and legend.  Use 
Netscape's Search  function to find out when volcanoes and El Ninos have 
occurred during this period and note their occurrence, and their 
magnitude, on the time axis of your graph. <P>

<B>Time series, Intercomparison and Analysis:</B><BR>
a) Time-Series for Other Cities:  Copy the thirty year data from three 
other cities: one at nearly the same latitude as DC, one at a higher and 
one at a lower latitude.  Create a new spreadsheet and a plot that shows 
the temperature time-series for all four cities.  Make note of 
similarities and differences and explain any variance from the expected 
trend of temperature vs. latitude that you would expect from the 
insolation curves in <a href="340.htm">Laing's Figure 
13.15</a>.<P>

b) Calculate the annual mean temperature for each year of the thirty 
years of data for DC, and for Berkeley. California.  Make a single graph 
of the time series of the annual mean temperature over time for these two 
cities. Compare the mean temperature for these two cities.<P>

c) Compare these means with the annual mean of global temperatures, which 
appears in the <a href="339.htm">EarthQuest graph #6.</a>  
Note important similarities and differences, and propose explanations.<P>


d) For the city of your choice, plot the time series of December, 
February, June and August temperatures over the thirty year interval.  Is 
the average August warmer than the average June?  Is the average February 
than the average December?  Explain why, in the northern hemisphere, 
February is sometimes colder than December, and August hotter than June, 
even though minimum insolation occurs during the December solstice and 
maximum insolation during the June solstice.<P>

<head><title> Man's Impact on Climate</title></head>
<body>


<center><h3> Scientists confirm mankind has an impact on 
climate</h3></center><P>
 
 (c) 1995 Copyright Nando.net<BR>
 (c) 1995 Reuter Information Service<P>
 
 MADRID (Nov 30, 1995 - 10:14 EST) - After years of arguments, top
 scientists have convinced governments for the first time that
 man-made emissions have an impact on climate.
<P> 
 The world's leading climate scientists met government delegates at a
 three-day session of the Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change
 (IPCC) in Madrid and agreed in the early hours of Thursday that human
 activities can change the weather.
 <P>
 "The balance of evidence suggests a discernible human influence on
 global climate," their conclusions stated.
<P> 
 This sentence, which will become the lynchpin of a final report by
 the influential panel, was only adopted after a pitched battle with
 oil-producing countries fighting to weaken the case for reducing oil and
 coal consumption.
 <P>
 "The fossil fuel lobby came to Madrid determined to water down the
 scientific evidence that human activities -- notably burning oil and coal
 -- are having a direct influence on global climate," said participant
 Merylyn McKenzie-Hedger, climate policy officer at WWF-World Wide Fund
 for Nature.
<P> 
 The scientists refused to discuss the polemic and said they were
 satisfied with the final statement.
 <P>
 "There is a clear risk for climate change and a clear risk for
 drought," Bert Bolin, chairman of the worldwide panel on climate,
 told journalists on Thursday. "The scientists have reached an
 agreement on the evidence, now the governments have to decide how to
 proceed."
<P> 
 The IPCC is made up of around 2,500 scientists, climatologists and
 experts from more than 100 nations who are charged with assessing
 the scientific evidence of climate change, calculating its impact,
 and devising responses, all in close consultation with governments.
 <P>
 The report from the Madrid meeting of its scientific working group
 will be presented to an IPCC inter-governmental conference in Rome
 on December 11-15 along with reports from two other working groups
 on impacts and solutions.
 <P>
 Environmentalists hope formal IPCC recognition of global warming
 will now force governments to work together to reduce greenhouse gas
 emissions.
<P> 
 The controversy about the existence of global warming stemmed from
 conflicting evidence and strange weather patterns that scientists
 were not able to explain in the past.
 <P>
 One of the problems, scientists say, is that aerosols or microscopic
 airborne particles from burning fossil fuels and other sources actually
 lower temperatures in some regions and mask the warming effect of
 greenhouse gases.
<P> 
 In the early 1990s, temperatures dropped for a few years against
 expectations because of the presence of volcanic ash from an
 eruption in the Philippines.
 <P>
 Bolin said the new evidence was convincing because it was based on
 scientific models that used both the aerosol effect and the
 greenhouse effect to predict global weather patterns.
 <P>
 He said IPCC experts agreed that without a change in lifestyles,
 average global temperature would rise two degrees centigrade by
 2100, resulting in hotter summers, a higher sea level and more
 frequent and severe droughts and floods.
 <P>
 "(The evidence) may imply considerable changes in the way that
 society ... is provided by energy -- this needs to be considered
 very seriously," he said.

Using all of the articles and chapters that have been given to you 
thusfar, <P>

1. Make a list of all factors, on land, ocean or atmosphere, which either 
heat or cool the Earth climate.  
<P>
2. Categorize your list into an outline of different kinds of effects, 
i.e., under land, ocean, atmosphere you might have albedo effects; under 
atmosphere you would have radiatively active gases, clouds, dust, ... 
etc. 
<P>
3. Rank the items in your outline on a scale of 1 to 5 to indicate 
relative strength or weakness.  
<P>
4.  Bring your table in on Monday.  Work in your teams to use resources 
in the classroom (books, journal articles etc.) or on the Internet, using 
Netscape, to answer the following questions and fill in your table with 
the relevant facts and figures. 
<P><UL>
	a. Find albedo values for various surfaces on the Earth<BR>
	b. Find albedo values for various atmospheric constituents<BR>

interaction of factors involved in this problem.</UL><P>


<B>PROCESS</B><P>

<B>Information Gathering:</b> Use books and articles in the lab and the 
library, and Internet search tools (Mosaic, Netscape, Archie, WAIS and 
Gopher) to conduct a search for current information about the subject of 
your investigation. Read and discuss the information. <P>

<B>Hypothesis/Research Question:</b>  With your team, pool resources 
gathered on-line and off-line (in the library) to investigate this 
relationship. Suggest a hypothesis or research question.  You must cite 
at least three sources which support your hypothesis, or question. 
Hypotheses, or questions, must be proposed and submitted in your team's 
preliminary research report by the end of the first week of the project.
<P>

<B>Qualitative Modeling:</b>  Create a common-sense STELLA model of your 
hypothesis which includes important features of phenomena under 
investigation, and clearly shows interrelations between these features.  
This common-sense model must be based on facts gleaned from your 
readings. In the <I>comments</i>  box of each component of your model, 
include a brief description and bibliographical reference to the source 
of that information.
<P>
<B>Data Selection:</B> What data do you need to test your hypothesis? 
Select and collect data from relevant sources, such as the DAACs listed 
above.  Refer to previous projects. Record the independent and dependent 
variables.

representation of the data. Apply the same palette to all like datasets. 
(Apply the histogram feature to test the reliability of the palette.)<BR>

<LI> Look at multiple data sets to get a sense of the information which 
can be derived from the data. Observe trends.<BR> 
<LI> Use MacCurveFit to plot the data. Are there correlations? Are they 
statistically significant? What are the strengths and weaknesses of your 
conclusions?<BR>
<LI> Zero-in on the geographic loci which might be relevant to your 
hypothesis.</UL><P>

<B>Quantitative Modeling: </b> Transform your qualitative model into a 
quantitative model using STELLA modeling software.  Based upon your notes 
from the data visualization process, and your research, construct a 
quantitative model which relies on the data analysis. Your team should 
use evidence to test your hypothesis and refine your model.  How reliable 
is you model? What other information is relevant? Note explicitly the 
boundaries of your understanding of systems, dynamics, and interaction 
among components.<P>

<B> Communication: </b> (1) Present your findings using your data, data 
products (graphics, visualizations, animations and text) on the ESSC WWW 
server. Hotlink relevant terms and passages to your STELLA model, 
visualizations, QuickTime movies, and any secondary sources you found 
valuable in the course of your research on the Internet. (2) Write a 
report (no more than six double-spaced typed pages) explaining the energy 
budget and its significance. Cite all sources and references.  A draft 
must be submitted in three weeks. The final report and presentation must 
be submitted in four weeks and must include references and evidence from

<B>Qualitative Modeling: </b> Create a common-sense STELLA model of your 
hypothesis which includes important features of phenomena under 
investigation, and clearly shows interrelations between these features.  
This common-sense model must be based on facts gleaned from your 
readings. In the comments  box of each component of your model, include a 
brief description and bibliographical reference to the source of that 
information.<P>

<B>Data Selection:</b>  What data do you need to test your hypothesis? 
Select and collect data from relevant sources, such as the DAACs listed 
above.  Refer to previous projects. Record the independent and dependent 
variables.

representation of the data. Apply the same palette to all like datasets. 
(Apply the histogram feature to test the reliability of the palette.)<BR>

<LI> Look at multiple data sets to get a sense of the information which 
can be derived from the data. Observe trends. <BR>
<LI> Use MacCurveFit to plot the data. Are there correlations? Are they 
statistically significant? What are the strengths and weaknesses of your 
conclusions?<BR>
<LI> Zero-in on the geographic loci which might be relevant to your 
hypothesis.</UL><P>

<B>Quantitative Modeling:</b>  Transform your qualitative model into a 
quantitative model using STELLA modeling software.  Based upon your notes 
from the data visualization process, and your research, construct a 
quantitative model which relies on the data analysis. Your team should

<UL>
1.	What are the large-scale transports of heat and water within the upper 
ocean, and how do they control air-sea exchange and vertical ocean 
circulation?<P>

2.	What are the rate, geographical distribution, and controlling factors 
for oceanic primary production and new production?<P>

3.	How are oceanic ecosystems changing in structure and species 
makeup?<P>

<B>B. ICE SHEETS, POLAR AND ALPINE GLACIERS, AND SEASONAL SNOW</b><P>
<UL>
1.	Through what processes are the ice sheets growing or thinning?
<P>
2.	What are the rates of snow accumulation, melting, and iceberg calving, 
and how do these reveal the key dynamics of ice flow?
<P>
3.	How will snow cover change as the climate warms; in particular, will a  
greater fraction of the winter snowfall occur as rain?
<P>
</UL>
<B>C. LAND SURFACE: ECOSYSTEMS AND HYDROLOGY</b><P>
<UL>
1.	How do land-cover changes and management practices caused by climate 
change affect the water and energy balances of the land surface?
</UL>
<P>
<B>D. CLOUDS, RADIATION, WATER VAPOR, AND PRECIPITATION </B><P>
<UL>
1.	How will clouds influence the Earth's radiation budget, and modulate 
or enhance tropospheric warming caused by increasing concentrations of 
greenhouse gases, especially water vapor?
<P>
2.	How do increasing concentrations of atmospheric trace gases affect the 
global and regional balances of precipitation, evaporation and 
transpiration, and runoff?
<P>
3.	What are the feedback and interactions between the atmosphere, oceans, 
and land-surface hydrology?
<P>
4.	Does the variation of solar irradiance during the solar cycle modulate 
greenhouse forcing, and is there a systematic long-term variation in 
solar irradiance leading to different climate regimes like the "Little 
Ice Age?"<P>

<li> move to a less rigorous and more structured discussion and 
reporting
<li> need to focus on selection process
<li> learned that the real internet (NII for education) includes fax, 
fedex, snail, and telephone
<li> our professional development and training needs to extend to 
mentors, especially scientists and graduate students who interact 
directly with students about their work
<li> match-making needs to happen more expediently -> developing a 
scientists database which will facilitate match-making<P>

<html><head><title>Intro to Modeling</title></head><body>

<center><h2>ESSC Summer Immersion Workshop 1995<br>
Tuesday - June 20 - 10:30 A -noon<br>
Introduction to Modeling</h2></center>

<pre>
<font size=+1>
1. Thinking about thinking
   1.1.  balls, leopards, quarterbacks, frisbees, babies, pianist
   1.2.  mental models, static, dynamic
      1.2.1.  copulation/birth, planting/harvesting, seasons, migrations, 
events/time/space:  learning relationships
      1.2.2. static modeling: a bookcase, dress, garden, lecture, 
behavior
      1.2.3. dynamic modeling: milk in frig, a dinner party, driving 
across New Mexico, planning a hunt, agriculture, animal husbandry, 
survival
   1.3. The Human animal models constantly - examples 
      1.3.1. picnic discussions of scuba diving and rock climbing are 
examples
      1.3.2. even getting to the park was an exercise in dynamic modeling

   1.4. Animal brains are specialized for solving dynamic problems - 
hunting survival
   1.5. Humans are animals and have the added capability of abstracting 
the capability of solving dynamic problems to modeling (mental dynamic 
problems)
   1.6. Think of a dynamic model that you might be involved in - baking a 
cake to sailing to Bermuda.  Now start listing all of the details that go 
into the planning and execution of the task; be detailed, is is easy to 
overlook some of the mundane considerations that our brains actually 
process in planning our activities.

2. Symbolic formalized modeling of dynamic behavior
   2.1. architectural drawings, recipes, road maps, graphs, calendars, TV 
Guide, weather forecasts, etc., etc.
   2.2. pert charts, flow charts, electrical wiring diagrams, programing 
languages

3. Computer-assisted dynamic modeling
   3.1. driver relational systems: motor driven, signal modifiers (audio 
systems)
   3.2. simple ordinary differential equation systems (freshman physics 
problems)
   3.3. coupled nonlinear systems of ordinary differential equations 
(STELLA here and all of the above)
   3.4. simple partial differential equations (sometimes STELLA)
   3.5. systems of partial differential equations (big hardware and 
software - Crays)


<h3>Objectives of Modeling in the Classroom</h3>

1. Systems Thinking
relationships, reservoirs, flows, feedback, drivers, constraints
2. Understanding Behavior
time constants, oscillations, resonances, growth, limits, equilibrium, 
fluctuations
3. Clear Organized Thinking
commit to diagram, quantify interactions, complete and run the model 
4. Information Value
data resources, guesstimating, trial and error correction
5. Learn Computing Skills
students take pride in successfully completing a modeling project

<title>Visualization Challenge</title>

<center><h2>Visualization Challenge and <br>Hands-on Experiment</h3>

<b>ESSC Summer Immersion Workshop<br>
 June 22, 1995</b><P></center>

All the files that you need for this exercise is in the VisExp 
folder/directory. You can open them with MS Word or whatever text editor 
you prefer to use.<P>

However, since you are going to do data visualization, open the data file 
"SSTPRC.TXT" in Spyglass Transform. The data file contains subset of the 
"Sea Surface Temperature" and "Precipitation" data used for the short 
investigation on Monday. The coverage of the data is between 45 and -45 
latitude, and -180 and 180 longitude. Its resolution is 1 along both 
directions. Note that the data file is actually in column format 
(relational data format). That means you will have to convert its 
components into the matrix (spreadsheet) format, before you visualize 
them. <P>


1.	Open the SSTPRC.TXT file which contains the January 1987 sea surface 
temperatures in Kelvin and precipitation amount in millimeters in the 
Tropical region.  Create a matrix (spreadsheet) for the sea surface 
temperature.<P>

2.	Rescale the data so that row and column labels correspond to the 
actual latitude and longitude values.<P>

3.	Create a color image of the rescaled data using the "Rainbow-low 
black" color table.<P>

4.	Manipulate the color range by changing the min/max values from the 
color bar, so that you use the entire color spectrum (table) and assign 
different colors to different data values as much as possible.<P>

5.	Once you are happy with the color table, give a title and label the 
axes and the color bar of your image. Save your image, data, and color 
bar as an HDF file.<P>

6.	Repeat steps 1-5 for the precipitation data.<P>

7.	Tile and synchronize the images and the corresponding data matrices. 
(Note that you should have four windows after tiling.)<P>

8.	Select an appropriate region of the ocean from one of the images for 
more focused data analysis/visualization.<P>

9.	Create two matrices containing sea surface temperatures and 
precipitation amounts in the region you selected. <P>

10.	Visualize the sea surface temperatures in the region by using a 
contour plot. (Try to have at least 5 contour levels). <P>

11.	Label the contour levels.<P>

12.	Visualize the precipitation amounts in the region by using a color 
image (either a simple color image or an interpolated image). If 
necessary, manipulate the color bar again. <P>

13.	Overlay the labeled contours, showing the sea surface temperatures, 
on the color image, showing the precipitation amounts. Save your image, 
data, and color bar as an HDF file.<P>

14.	Can you say anything about the correlation between the  sea surface 
temperatures and the precipitation amounts in the region by looking at 
the composite image?<P>

15.	Create a colored surface plot for each data parameter in the selected 
region. Label the axes in each visualization. If necessary, resize the 
surface plots. Save your image, data, and color bar in HDF files.<P>

16.	Can you say anything about the correlation between the  sea surface 
temperatures and the precipitation amounts in the region by looking at 
the surface plots?<P>

<title>ESSC SIW Long Investigation</title>


<center><h2>Summer Immersion Workshop<br>
Week II Investigation<br>
Possible Areas of Investigation:</h2></center>

<b><i>Changes in temperature associated with El Nino events.<br>
Changes in precipitation associated with El Nino events.<br>
Changes in  evaporation associated with El Nino events.<br>
Changes in cloud associatedwith El Nino events.</i></b><P>


<b>Expected Duration:</b> 5 days<P>

<b>OBJECTIVES</b><P>
<br>


<b>INITIAL RESOURCES: Check the ESSCC website for updates</b>
<ul>ESSC Hydrology Hotlist<br>			Spyglass Transform<br>
Various El Nino WWW sites<br>				Netscape<br>
NASA Climate Data System<br>		STELLA Modeling Software<br>
Marshal Space Flight Ctr DAAC<br>		PO.DAAC Webpage	</ul><P>	


<b>PROCESS: See the Investigation page of the ESSC website</b><P>
<ul>
<b>Information Gathering:</b> Use books and articles in the lab and the 
library, and Internet search tools (NCSA's Mosaic, Archie, WAIS and 
Gopher) to conduct a search for current information about the subject of 
your investigation. Read and discuss the information. <P>

<b>Hypothesis: </b> With your team, pool resources gathered on-line and 
off-line (in the library) to investigate this relationship. Suggest a 
hypothesis.  You must cite at least three sources which support your 
hypothesis. Hypotheses must be proposed and submitted in your teams 
background report by the end of the first week of the project.<P>

<b>Qualitative Modeling: </b> Create a preliminary conceptual model to 
investigate your hypothesis which includes the important features 
pertaining to the hydrosphere and its interactions with other subsystems 
of the Earth. Your model must be based on facts gleaned from your 
background research. In the comments  box of each component of your 
model, include a brief description and bibliographical reference to the 
source of that information.<P>

<b>Data Selection:</b>  What data do you need to test your hypothesis? 
Select and collect data from relevant sources, such as the DAACs listed 
above, and previous projects.  Note your requirements for spatial and 
temporal coverage and resolution. Be sure to record metadata.  Read the 
Data section of the Project Checklist.<p>

<b>Data Visualization and Analysis: </b> As a team, collaboratively  
examine relevant data using NCSA Collage visualization software.  <br>
* Manipulate the color palette to produce the best visual representation 
of the data. Apply the same palette to all like datasets. (Apply the 
histogram feature to test the reliability of the palette.)<br>
* Look at multiple data sets to get a sense of the information which can 
be derived from the data. Observe trends. Are there correlations? Are 
they statistically significant? What are the strengths and weaknesses of 
your conclusions?<br>
* Use the Histogram and Datascope features to zero-in on the geographical 
locus which might be relevant to your hypothesis.<p>

<b>Quantitative Modeling: </b> Transform your qualitative model into a 
<u>quantitative</u> model using STELLA modeling software.  Based upon 
your notes from the data visualization process, and your research, 
construct a quantitative model which relies on the data analysis. Your 
team should use evidence to test your hypothesis and refine your model.  
How reliable is you model? What other information is relevant? Note 
explicitly the boundaries of your understanding of systems, dynamics, and 
interaction among components.<P>

<b> Communication: </b> (1) Present your findings using your data, data 
products (graphics, visualizations, animations and text) on the NCSA 
Mosaic server. Hotlink relevant terms and passages to your STELLA model, 
visualizations, QuickTime movies, and any secondary sources you found 
valuable in the course of your research on the Internet. (2) Write a 
report (no more than six double-spaced typed pages) explaining the energy 
budget and its significance. Cite all sources and references.  A draft 
must be submitted in three weeks. The final report and presentation must 
be submitted in four weeks and must include references and evidence from 
your investigation.<P>

<b>Refine, Design:</b> Examine and discuss the findings of other teams, 
add any refinements to your own hypothesis, model, and choice of data 
sets; design an experiment in order to investigate the issue 
further.</ul><P>

<b>EVALUATION:  
<ul>See Project Checklist on the Investigation page of the ESSCC 
website</b><br>
Your team grade for work quality will be determined by the quality 
of:<br>
* A thorough background report explaining hydrologic cycle, its 
significance and your team's hypothesis within that context.<br>
* A hypermedia report  which answers the thematic question by explaining 
your hypothesis, the strategy for testing your hypothesis and most 
importantly, the findings of your investigation. Above all, report on 
scientific findings, not the chronicle of your activities or the steps 
involved with each stage of the investigation process.  Cite all sources 
and references. The reports should include all of the relevant media used 
in your investigation. Minimum requirements follow::<br>
* A quantitative STELLA model of the sources, sinks and flows of ions in 
the Earth's ocean systems which accounts for its general constancy. <BR>
* Relevant data and data visualizations from NASA and other archives, 
that may be useful to illustrating an understanding of the interaction of 
factors involved in this problem.</ul><p>

</PRE>
<H4> Unit of Measurement</H4>

Units are as stated for the parameter (see item1.1 above).

<H4>Data Source</H4>

Over 3900 stations worldwide have reported measurements
to the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC), which provides most of the
World Monthly Surface Station Climatology data. Much of the data prior to 
1961 came from the
Smithsonian miscellaneous collections and the World Weather Records of 
the
U.S. Weather Bureau and the Environmental Data Services. The local 
temperature data has then been 
extracted from the World Monthly Surface Station Climatology data for 
locations near the educational institutions 
participating in the ESSC project.


<H3><A NAME="Sec2">2. Spatial Characterictics</A></H3>

<H4>Spatial Coverage</H4>

As of 1989, the most recent year for which local temperature data is 
available,
there were approximately 2500 stations scattered around the world 
providing global coverage. From 1731 to
1860, the number of stations increased from 1 to 103, and from 1870 to 
1900 the number increased from 187 to 679. 
From 1961 to 1970, there were 2875 stations, of which 1089 stations were 
in the southern hemisphere. Please
note, however, that a number of the stations no longer operate in the 
same site.  A separate data set of long period African rainfall data has 
about 250 stations.

<H4>Spatial Resolution</H4>

The weather stations are usually 100 to 200 km apart.


<H3><A NAME="Sec3">3.  Temporal Characteristics</A></H3>

<H4>Temporal Coverage</H4>

The data set contains world monthly surface climatological data through 
1989.  
These are updated around August of each year for the previous year.  The 
data for some stations extend to the
mid-1700's.  (See the references in Section 7 below for more detailed 
statistics on coverage.)

<H4> Temporal Resolution</H4>

The original data set contains monthly means,
annual means, 10-year monthly means, 10-year annual means, 30-year 
monthly
means and 30-year annual means of temperature, pressure, precipitation,
sunshine (% and duration), and sea surface temperature (where available)
for each station.  The character data set (ASCII version) only contains 
monthly means.  The
data are based on daily measurements of maximum/minimum temperature and
other quantities.


<H3><A NAME="Sec4">4.  Instrument Description</A></H3>

The parameters are measured using conventional instruments.

<H3>Research and Assessment:  EOS Science Investigations</H3>	
In 1990, NASA confirmed 29 teams of scientists as part of the EOS 
Interdisciplinary Science Investigations. These investigations will focus 
on:<P>
<ul>
 1) obtaining understanding of key Earth system processes;<P>
 2) developing predictive numerical models;<P>
 3) increasing use and utility of existing satellite data; and <P>
 4) preparing for use of new types of data expected from new instruments. 
Scientists leading these investigations employ the help of graduate 
students, post-doctoral research fellows, and technicians for a total 
exceeding 800 researchers. The governments of Australia, Brazil, Canada, 
France, Japan, and the United Kingdom support eight of these research 
teams.<P>
</ul>
	In addition, each EOS instrument and each EOSDIS data center has science 
teams or a science working group. EOS Instrument Science Teams work on 
instrument design, development, calibration, and data applications. 
EOSDIS scientists help anticipate and meet the computing and data needs 
of EOS scientists.<P>

	The NASA Global Change Graduate Student Fellowship Program began in 1990 
to ensure a pool of highly qualified Earth scientists who can use data 
generated during the EOS mission. This program supports students pursuing 
their doctorates in Earth system science. A total of 221 fellows was 
selected from 1,365 applications over the first four years of the 
program. Forty percent were women, and 21 percent represent 21 countries 
outside the U.S. These students have conducted research at 66 
institutions across the U.S. NASA will grant approximately 50 new awards 
each

year to maintain support for 150 to 200 students through the lifetime of 
the EOS program. The program also stresses:<P>

<UL>
<li> Developing teaching materials for K-12 and undergraduate and graduate 
levels;<br>

<li> Developing introductory and advanced-level courses in Earth System 
Science concepts; and<br>
<li> Training teachers/ educators through summer schools and 
short-courses.<P>

<ul>I. Hypothesis<br>
<ul>
A clear, positive and testable statement about a set of facts, processes
or interactions.<br>
<ul>
Examples:<br>
a) Atmospheric water vapor has an overall cooling effect on atmospheric
temperatures.<br>
b) Volcanic aerosols have an overall cooling effect on surface
temperatures.<br></ul>
A good hyptothesis is one which can be tested with the means at our
disposal.  An affirmative or negative result should be attainable in the
time alotted.<br>

II. Method for Testing Hypothesis<br>
<UL>
        A. State the assumptions you are making (if any) in order to test the
hypothesis.<br> <UL>
        Example:  In our study of CFCs we consider only tropospheric 
CFCs.  Our
hypothesis      does not account for the role of CFCs in the 
stratosphere.<br>
</UL>
        B. State the Means of Testing Hypothesis<br>
<UL>
                        Describe the source of your model 
(e.g., Arthur Few) and the modifications that will be 
introduced to adapt it to testing your hypothesis.<p> </UL>

 <UL>
Use <A HREF="385.htm">STELLA</A> to create a preliminary model
which includes important features of the distribution of stratospheric
ozone, in general, and clearly shows how the inter-relations of these
components. The model should enable you to express your understanding of
the phenomen a, as well as allowing you to test your hypothesis.  Use
basic ozone model, supplied by the teacher, as a seed for your own; make
modifications in order to address the features of your specific
hypothesis. This non-quantitative model must be based on facts gleaned
from your background research. Therefore, in the "comments" dialogue box
of each component of your model, include a brief description and/or
bibliographical reference to the source of that information, where
appropriate. You will find that building the qualitative model will help
you to better articulate your hypothesis.

<H3>Organize Research</H3>
<UL>
For the background research phase of your project, orchestrate the
activities of your team members so that your preliminary research captures
the breadth of important issues related to your topic. In the data
visualization and quantitative modeling phase of your investigation, your
hypothesis and model should function to narrow your choice of references
and sources. Note the dates of global events, such as volcanic eruptions,
El Nino cycles, solar activity cycles, etc., each of which may have
significant impact on the particular phenomenon you are studying. Your
choice of model components, and your data selection criteria, should take
into account the impact of such events.  Summaries, written by your team,
of articles and books, will better enable you to organize this information
into a coherent whole. Present your to do list calendar to the teacher and
to your science mentor. Clearly designate the dates and times of contact
with science mentor to assure successful communication.<P>

<ul>
<a name="research"><H2>Research Plan Checklist and Presentation</H2></a>
<ul><H3>Presentation</H3><P>
<UL>
Briefly present (in 5-7 minutes) your preliminary background report and research plan orally.  Take note of feedback from other teams and from the teacher.  The purpose of the oral report is to evaluate the feasibility of the research program and to keep
everyone abreast of the activities of the other teams.  Submit written a report  (about three pages).<P>
</UL>
<H3>Checklist</H3>
I.  Background<br>
<ul>
A brief, but comprehensive presentation of the concepts, terms and 
phenomena upon which your hypothesis is based.  This section should lay 
the foundation for understanding the meaning and import of your 
hypothesis.  Cite all references in standard style.<br> </UL>


II.  Hypothesis<br>
<UL> 
A clear, positive and testable statement about a set of facts, processes 
or interactions.<br>
<ul>
Examples:<br> 
a) Atmospheric water vapor has an overall cooling effect on atmospheric 
temperatures.<br>
b) Volcanic aerosols have an overall cooling effect on surface 
temperatures.<br></ul>
A good hyptothesis is one which can be tested with the means at our 
disposal.  An affirmative or negative result should be attainable in the 
time alotted.<br>
</UL>
III. Method for Testing Hypothesis<br>
<UL>
	A. State the assumptions you are making (if any) in order to test the 
hypothesis.<br> <UL>
	Example:  In our study of CFCs we consider only tropospheric CFCs.  Our 
hypothesis 	does not account for the role of CFCs in the stratosphere.<br>
</UL>

</ul>
<UL>
<H3>
Background Research</h3>
<UL>
In this round of research your team will delve more deeply into the 
specialized literature related to your topic.  Based on this research, 
your contact with a science mentor will be more focused than the 
introductory conversations you had in reference to the <A 
HREF="388.htm">background report</A> Record 
all references to both text and electronic literature on your topic, as 
well as to conversations with the mentors.<P>
</UL>

<h3>Data Viz</h3>

<UL>
Collaboratively examine relevant data using NCSA Collage, Deltagraph,
Excel, Lotus and/or other graphing and visualization software. Examine how
the data may be relevant to testing your hypothesis via the quantitative
model. Note explicitly the bounda ries of your understanding of energy
balance and temperature, i.e., state what other information, not included
in your model or in your data selection, may be relevant to your study of
energy budget and surface temperature.<p> Use NCSA Collage to manipulate
or create a color palette which most appropriately represents the data.
Apply the histogram feature to test the appropriateness of the palette. 
Apply the same palette to all like datasets; use the histogram option and
NCSA Datascope to zero-in on subsections of the data granule which might
be relevant to your hypothesis; examine multiple datasets to get a sense
of the information which can be derived from the variety of data; observe
trends and look for correlations. Are these statistically significant? 
</UL>

<P>



<h3>Quantitative Modeling</h3>

<ul> Transform your qualitative model into a quantitative model using 
<A HREF="389.htm> Begin with the basic
       ozone model, provided by your teacher, and build in features that 
would enable you to observe
       and test your hypothesis. Your quantitative model should 
integrate the assumptions of your
       hypothesis. The model and its output should be compared with the 
data and research you have
       gathered through your research.<p> 
<ul>
<li> Your team should use data to test the hypothesis and 
refine your model.<br>

<li> Indicate the reliability of your model by noting it's 
limits: what possibly relevant factors are excluded from the model?<br>

<li> Note explicitly the boundaries of your understanding of 
the systems, dynamics, and interaction among components in this 
phenomenon.<br>

<li> Consult your teacher and other teams in the construction 
and modification of your STELLA model. Develop your model collaboratively.</ul><p> 

<STRONG>Model Coupling</STRONG><br>
Examine the reports of other teams, with particular attention to their
quantitative models. In collaboration with other teams, <B>combine</B> all
relevant models to build a model which comprehends important features of
each of the component models.  Attempt to <B>couple</B> these models by
making the interactions between them affect both. The point of this
exercise is twofold:  to gain an in-depth understanding of topics related
to the one your team investigated; and to create a model which is more
comprehensive than those produced by individual teams.<BR>

In attempting to couple the models be careful to note the temporal 
and spatial parameters of the individual models.</UL>

<BODY>
<A HREF="144.map">
<IMG SRC="" ISMAP></A><p>

<H3>EOS DATA AND INFORMATION SYSTEM (EOSDIS)</H3>

The EOS will support researchers by developing a computing and
communication system to receive, process, store, and distribute sizable
amounts of data and information about the Earth. One general goal of data
and information systems is to remove the need for each user to have
detailed knowledge of remote-sensing instruments and methods. Along with
scientific research, the user community for EOSDIS-provided information
and services could include those interested in commercial applications,
education, resource inventories and planning, policy decisions, and
disaster assessment.<P>
 
Teams of scientists will bear responsibility for ensuring the quality of
EOS data products, subject to the peer review common in scientific
research. The EOSDIS currently archives and distributes data from past and
current satellite missions. Projects to improve availability and quality
of existing data sets, called Pathfinders, are providing information with
recognized value to global climate change research.  Pathfinder projects
and ongoing satellite missions will serve as the first step for scientists
and EOSDIS developers.<P>

The technical goal of the EOSDIS is to develop a system that will evolve
and grow to allow increasingly sophisticated uses and analyses of data and
information. For a system as large and complex as the EOS, an inadequate
computing system could limit or discourage the efficient use of data and
information. Given the international nature of the EOS program, data and
information must flow easily worldwide.<P>

The EOSDIS components consist of a network of data centers and facilities
for instrument control, data storage, computing and communications. These
components of EOSDIS will resemble a single entity to users. Distributed
Active Archive Centers (DAACs) will bear responsibility for product
generation, information management and data and information archive and
distribution. The data centers selected for the EOSDIS each focus on a
particular type of data or scientific field.  Users will access the EOSDIS
from external computer networks such as the U.S. National Research and
Education Network (NREN).<P>

Fulfilling user needs will require an EOSDIS that con evolve constantly to
incorporate new computer technology. The EOSDIS version due in 1994 will
introduce common services for information management, data archive and
distribution through the data centers. At launch of the first EOS
satellite in 1 998, EOSDIS will be fully integrated, with all major
functions available. The EOSDIS will continue to evolve throughout the EOS
mission in response to requirements for global change research, mission
operations, and broad user access.<P>

<H3>EOS OBSERVATIONS: INSTRUMENTS AND SPACECRAFT</H3>

The most visible part of the EOS will be the series of satellites currying
advanced remote-sensing instruments. These small- to intermediate-size
satellites, each currying one to six instruments, will be launched
beginning in 1998. The enclosed fact sheet describes the EOS satellites
and their measurement objectives. Replacement satellites, launched every
three to five years, will provide a minimum of 15 years of continuous
global observations.<P>

Most of the satellites will orbit over the polar regions and synchronous
with the sun to get consistent, global coverage. The EOS-AEROSOL satellite
series, an exception, will fly in a different orbit relative to the sun.
This orbit will provide a second view of atmospheric aerosols compared
with identical instruments on EOS-CHEMISTRY. EOS-COLOR will make a single
flight needed to continue the series of afternoon ocean color measurements
between the SeaWiFS (Seaviewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor) mission to
begin in 1994, and the first EOS-PM mission in 2000.<P>

The EOS will involve 23 different instruments. The United States and Japan
will collaborate to place the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and
Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) instrument on the EOS AM-1 satellite and to
place SeaWinds on Japan's Advanced Earth Observing System (ADEOS)
satellite series. The U.S. and the United Kingdom together will develop
and build the High-Resolution Dynamics Limb Sounder (HIRDLS). The EOS will
carry instruments from Canada (Measurements of Pollution in the
Troposphere, or MOPITT), France (Doppler Orbitography and Radiopositioning
Integrated by Satellite [DORIS], and Solid-State Altimeter, or SSALT), and
Europe's Multifrequency Imaging Microwave Radiometer (MIMR). Within the
U.S., NASA will work with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration (NOAA) to develop the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit
(AMSU) instrument. In addition, NASA consults with the remote-sensing
programs of other U.S. agencies and international partner space agencies
to coordinate measurements that complement those of the EOS.<P>

<H3>A NATIONAL ANDINTERNATIONAL EFFORT</H3>

The Earth Observing System is the core program of NASA's Mission to Planet
Earth initiative. It represents, however, only part of the efforts
underway in the U.S. and other countries to conduct long-term observations
and scientific studies of global climate change. Other components of
NASA's Mission to Planet Earth include:<P>

<UL>
<li>Satellite missions leading up to, and complementing, the EOS;<br>

<li>Continuations of successful small satellite programs;<br>

<li>Observation from the Space Shuttle; <br>

<li>and Remote sensing from aircraft.<p>
</UL>

Several small satellite programs are underway or planned. The TOMS
instruments that have been monitoring global ozone levels since 1978 are
upgraded and replaced periodically. The Italian LAGEOS-II (Laser
Geodynamics Satellite 11) was launched by NASA in 1992 to aid measurements
of Earth's surface movements and gravity field. The SeaWiFS mission will
launch in 1994, resuming ocean color (phytoplankton) measurements made
from 1978 to 1986.<P>

Mission to Planet Earth includes larger, multi-instrument satellites.  The
UARS has measured atmospheric chemistry and radiation since 1 991.  The
joint U.S./France mission, TOPEX/ POSEIDON, was launched in 1992 to study
ocean currents. Japan's ADEOS, scheduled for launch in 1996, will carry
NASA's TOMS to monitor ozone and NSCAT to measure wind speed and direction
over the oceans. The Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) is set for
launch in 1997 as a joint U.S./Japan mission to help understand the role
of tropical regions on Earth's climate.<P>

The Space Shuttle provides short demonstration flights for new
instruments, such as the multi-frequency Shuttle Imaging Radar-C (SIR-C),
which will be capable of viewing land under all weather conditions. The
Shuttle also carries well-calibrated research instruments for detailed
studies from space, as with the annual flights of the Atmospheric
Laboratory for Applications and Science (ATLAS), which has focused on
atmospheric chemistry and radiation since 1992. Aircraft missions serve a
similar role, providing tests and validation of instruments simulating
those used in space.<P>

The U.S. Global Change Research Program coordinates and guides the efforts
of federal agencies. These agencies include NASA, the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the National Science Foundation, the
Environmental Protection Agency, the U.S. Geological Survey, and the
Departments of Energy, Defense, and Agriculture.  Successful
remote-sensing missions outside NASA include: NOAA's operational weather
satellites that provide global data for radiation, clouds, water vapor,
sea surface temperatures, and vegetation; the defense Meteorological
Satellite Program that provides information on sea ice, atmospheric water,
and land surface characteristics; and the Landsat program that provides
detailed images of land. All U.S. agencies listed above have extensive
data sets bused on ground, ship, and aircraft measurements that complement
satellite observations.<P>

NASA encourages the widest possible participation from international
partners in the development and implementation of its Mission to Planet
Earth. For instance, Europe, Canada, and Japan have programs complementary
to the EOS that together comprise the International Earth Observing System
(IEOS). The Committee on Earth Observations Satellites (CEOS) aids
coordination at the international level. Members of the CEOS include
agencies of Australia, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, India Italy,
Japan, Russia, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the U.S. (through NASA and
NOAA). International research programs have initiated global studies and
promoted scientific collaborations and interdisciplinary research.
Examples include the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme (IGBP),
the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP), and the United Nations
Environment Programme (UNEP).<P>

<H1>Current Projects.</H1> 
<P><I>An overview of some of the research projects I'm currently undertaking
for Foresight.</I> </P> 
<H2>Internet access tools for the sight-impaired.</H2> 
<P><B>Problem: </B>The World-Wide-Web is an incredible source of information
which I believe should be available to everybody. For many years, blind and
sight-impaired users have accessed the Internet using text-based browsers and
text-to-speech synthesizers. These tools cannot communicate all of the
information contained on a traditional printed page, because much of the
information is contained in &quot;spatial&quot; information; in the typography
and the physical arrangement of information on the printed page. The www has
rapidly evolved into a &quot;speech-hostile&quot; environment as more and more
sites are filled with graphics which have no meaning in a text-based world.</P> 
<P><B>Solution:</B> We are working to develop a speech-friendly interface for
non-sighted computer users that allows them to access the educational and
scientific resources on the web, without limiting them to sites specifically
designed for the purpose. This involves applying tools that take the &quot;code&quot;
that comes off the www and re-interpreting it as it comes in. The goal is to
replace the &quot;meaningless junk&quot; and speech-hostile formatting with
meaningful and useful text.</P> 
<H2>Simplified hydrology model for understanding the causes of flooding.</H2> 
<P><B>Problem: </B>To teach the basics of science literacy and the skills of
mathematical modeling to high-school students. </P> 
<P><B>Solution:</B> Develop a mathematical model of the complex system of
hydrologic factors that lead to flooding. Develop a way to communicate how the
model works, a piece-at-a time and then how all of its parts work together. Make
the entire model suitable for use in a high school science classroom.</P> 
<H2>Commercialization of Ultra-High-Resolution LCD's and other fascinating
technology.</H2> 
<P><B>Problem: </B>A great deal of federally funded R&amp;D is invested in
projects and programs with expressly military applications. Foresight is
involved in numerous &quot;swords to plowshares&quot; commercialization
projects. Our unique expertise involves identifying commercial sector market
niches for some of these proprietary technologies. One of the more exciting
recent projects has been identifying commercialization opportunities for
ultra-high-resolution LCD displays which can put all the text on this page (and
more) onto a screen smaller than the crystal on your wrist-watch.</P> 
<H2>&quot;Smart&quot; automated web search.</H2> 
<P><B>Problem: </B>The www is expanding at incredible speed.<B> </B>The
principle obstacles to finding what you are looking for on the www are &quot;dead&quot;
content, &quot;obsolete&quot; links, and poorly indexed collections of junk.</P>
<P><B>Solution: </B>We are one of several companies developing applications
based on &quot;intelligent agent&quot; browsers, where a software agent, armed
with user-defined parameters, finds and downloads web sites automatically. The
most recent implementation of this technology allows me to identify &quot;live&quot;
sites with &quot;relevant&quot; content and then download the sites to my
hard-drive, while I do something else. When I have time, I can then access the
information at hard-drive speed. </P>

text-to-speech synthesizers. These tools cannot communicate all of the
information contained on a traditional printed page, because much of the
information is contained in &quot;spatial&quot; information; in the typography
and the physical arrangement of information on the printed page. The www has
rapidly evolved into a &quot;speech-hostile&quot; environment as more and more
sites are filled with graphics which have no meaning in a text-based world.</P> 
<P><B>Solution:</B> We are working to develop a speech-friendly interface for
non-sighted computer users that allows them to access the educational and
scientific resources on the web, without limiting them to sites specifically
designed for the purpose. This involves applying tools that take the &quot;code&quot;
that comes off the www and re-interpreting it as it comes in. The goal is to
replace the &quot;meaningless junk&quot; and speech-hostile formatting with
meaningful and useful text.</P> 
<H2>Simplified hydrology model for understanding the causes of flooding.</H2> 
<P><B>Problem: </B>To teach the basics of science literacy and the skills of
mathematical modeling to high-school students. </P> 
<P><B>Solution:</B> Develop a mathematical model of the complex system of
hydrologic factors that lead to flooding. Develop a way to communicate how the
model works, a piece-at-a time and then how all of its parts work together. Make
the entire model suitable for use in a high school science classroom.</P> 
<H2>Commercialization of Ultra-High-Resolution LCD's and other fascinating
technology.</H2> 
<P><B>Problem: </B>A great deal of federally funded R&amp;D is invested in
projects and programs with expressly military applications. Foresight is
involved in numerous &quot;swords to plowshares&quot; commercialization
projects. Our unique expertise involves identifying commercial sector market
niches for some of these proprietary technologies. One of the more exciting
recent projects has been identifying commercialization opportunities for
ultra-high-resolution LCD displays which can put all the text on this page (and
more) onto a screen smaller than the crystal on your wrist-watch.</P> 
<H2>&quot;Smart&quot; automated web search.</H2> 
<P><B>Problem: </B>The www is expanding at incredible speed.<B> </B>The
principle obstacles to finding what you are looking for on the www are &quot;dead&quot;
content, &quot;obsolete&quot; links, and poorly indexed collections of junk.</P>
<P><B>Solution: </B>We are one of several companies developing applications
based on &quot;intelligent agent&quot; browsers, where a software agent, armed
with user-defined parameters, finds and downloads web sites automatically. The
most recent implementation of this technology allows me to identify &quot;live&quot;
sites with &quot;relevant&quot; content and then download the sites to my
hard-drive, while I do something else. When I have time, I can then access the
information at hard-drive speed. </P>

<h1 align=center>THE RATTLESNAKE TOUR, </h1>

<h2 align=center><i>Desert Encounters. </i></h2>

<center><p>&copy;1992 by Nick Dallett 
<br><a href="mailto: nicknparis@waypt.com">nicknparis@waypt.com</a> </p></center>

<p>
<hr width="100%" ></p>

<h1>Preface</h1>

<p>The Rattlesnake Tour is an autobiographical novel in hypertext. When
I began this work in 1991, it was intended to be a novel in footnotes.
When I was introduced to the Internet and began writing HTML in 1995, I
immediately recognized the fit between the HTML formatting language and
the new associative medium I was trying to create.</p>

<p>The seeds for this book came during my 1991 and 1992 tours of the Southwestern
United States. I had quit my job to become a full-time musician, and was
trying to drum up name recognition. When I came close to finishing the
first trip, I realized that my entire life could be summed up in the three
months I spent on the road - through my associations to people, places,
things, and events encountered on the trip, and through my associations
to those associations. The footnotes follow my train of thought from association
to deeper association. I believe that Hypertext links make it easier to
follow the threads of thought than is possible with footnotes set upon
footnotes.</p>

<p>This book is a work in progress. As of this writing, only the first
section of the book is fully realized. The remainder of the text you see
here is the base document, a fairly dry narrative of the tour, which is
separated into four sections which tell the story of the trip in terms
of first my and others' dreams (psyche), then my body and my physical contact
with others (materia), then my music career (anima), and finally my obsession
with rattlesnakes (symbol). James Joyce's novel <i>A Portrait of the Artist
As a Young Man</i>, which I was reading when I began the narrative in Boulder
Colorado, seemed to mirror my own psychological life at the time. That
book is used to tie together the present-tense sections of the narrative,
which follow the day-to-day writing of the narrative between Boulder and
my home in Port Townsend, Washington. The remainder of the narrative is
told in past tense from that perspective.</p>

<p>No personal or place names have been changed. The people and places
I mention are as I remember them and are not embroidered in any way.</p>

<p>Publishers interested in publishing the book in physical form, either
as a traditional book or on CD-ROM, may contact me at the email link above.</p>

<h1>THE RATTLESNAKE TOUR, </h1>

<h2><i>Desert Encounters. </i></h2>

<p>&copy;1992 by Nick Dallett</p>

<ul>
<ul>
<p><i>&quot;[The soul] has a slow and dark birth, more mysterious than
the birth of</i> <i>the body. When the soul of a man is born in this country
there are nets</i> <i>flung at it to hold it back from flight. You talk
to me of nationality,</i> <i>language, religion. I shall try to fly by
those nets.&quot;</i> </p>

<p><b>-James Joyce,</b> <b><i>A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man </i></b></p>
</ul>
</ul>

<p>
<hr width="100%" ></p>

<h2 align=center>Preface</h2>

<p>The Rattlesnake Tour is an autobiographical novel in hypertext. When
I began this work in 1991, it was intended to be a novel in footnotes.
When I was introduced to the Internet and began writing HTML in 1995, I
immediately recognized the fit between the HTML formatting language and
the new associative medium I was trying to create.</p>

<p>The seeds for this book came during my 1991 and 1992 tours of the Southwestern
United States. I had quit my job to become a full-time musician, and was
trying to drum up name recognition. When I came close to finishing the
first trip, I realized that my entire life could be summed up in the three
months I spent on the road - through my associations to people, places,
things, and events encountered on the trip, and through my associations
to those associations. The footnotes follow my train of thought from association
to deeper association. I believe that Hypertext links makes it easier to
follow the threads of thought than is possible with footnotes set upon
footnotes.</p>

<p>This book is a work in progress. As of this writing, only the first
section of the book is fully realized. The remainder of the text you see
here is the base document, a fairly dry narrative of the tour, which is
separated into four sections which tell the story of the trip in terms
of first my and others' dreams (psyche), then my body and my physical contact
with others (materia), then my music career (anima), and finally my obsession
with rattlesnakes (symbol). James Joyce's novel <i>A Portrait of the Artist
As a Young Man</i>, which I was reading when I began the narrative in Boulder
Colorado, seemed to mirror my own psychological life at the time. That
book is used to tie together the present-tense sections of the narrative,
which follow the day-to-day writing of the narrative between Boulder and
my home in Port Townsend, Washington. The remainder of the narrative is
told in past tense from that perspective.</p>

<p>No personal or place names have been changed. The people and places
I mention are as I remember them and are not embroidered in any way.</p>

<p>Publishers interested in publishing the book in physical form, either
as a traditional book or on CD-ROM, may contact me at the email link below.</p>

<p>This book is copyright 1992 by Nick Dallett. Individual sections may
be downloaded or printed for personal use only. Persons interested in a
complete copy of the novel in printed form may contact me as provided below.
No complete copies will be distributed prior to completion of the novel
except to qualified publishers or reviewers who have established a need
to see and possess the document in progress.</p>

<h1>ONE </h1>

<p><b>Some Dreams </b></p>

<p>&quot;I've got to tell you this dream I had last night. You're going
to scream. It was so obvious. You won't believe this. Get your tea and
come here and I'll tell you. I usually don't understand my dreams, but
this one. . . you're going to howl. Here it is. I went over to my boyfriend's
house and I went in. Interrupted him with his new girlfriend. He jumped
up, all flustered, and trying to explain, and I said - get this - 'relax,
it's okay. I just came over to get my marked copy of Tom Sawyer.&quot;
</p>

<p>The dreamer and her girlfriend giggle loudly, then burst into laughter.
&quot;Isn't that obvious? Can you even believe it?&quot; The other patrons
of this crowded coffeehouse take the outburst in stride, even though many
are quietly studying. I'm at a table a few feet away, probably the only
person here who isn't a University of Colorado student. I'm trying to read
A portrait of the artist as a young man. What makes it hard, at this juncture,
is not the noise of conversation, or the periodic hiss of milk being foamed
behind the espresso counter, nor is it the cold drafts from the door when
it opens to envelop or disgorge another body to or from Pearl St. outside,
just a few yards from my seat. What makes it hard is this woman's insistence
on the transparency of her dream. </p>

<p>I'm an eavesdropper by nature, and a Jungian by upbringing, and if there's
one thing I've learned sitting through years of my mother's seminars, it's
that dreams are always devious. I'm tempted to abandon Joyce to interrogate
this woman. &quot;Excuse me,&quot; I'd say, &quot;your dream is not as
clear to me as it evidently is to you. Granted, finding your boyfriend
in flagrante seems clear, you having apparently just broken up with him,
but what about the book? Why a book, first of all? Why Tom Sawyer in particular,
and why a marked copy, for god's sake?&quot; But you're guilty too, I remind
myself, and chagrined, I have to admit that I made the same mistake, three
months ago, at the beginning of this journey. </p>

<p>In the dream, an old Chinese man took away my part in a play, giving
it to Rachel. Handing me a rake, he sent me out in the field to till onions.
At the time, I too said &quot;what an obvious dream.&quot; </p>

<p>In actuality, I was going away, leaving Rachel to take care of my business.
And instead of my usual role, I was out &quot;in the field,&quot; digging
up gigs, digging up connections, sifting through all the possible roads
and towns and coffeehouses and theaters to find my own niche in a music
scene already cramped with guitar players. Now, I scold myself. Why an
old Chinese man? Why onions? Dreams are never obvious, the less so the
more they seem.

<h2>Olympia</h2>

<p><b><i>Day 1 </i></b></p>

<p>I've been planning this trip for months, have been looking forward to
leaving, seeing new places, playing music for new people, but actually
making that first step, getting into the car and driving away, was more
difficult than I ever imagined. There should be some sort of ritual to
cover that awkward moment of departure, something to dictate what I should
do and how I should act. As it was, there was a great emotional void as
I stood with Rachel by my truck. I said &quot;Well. . .&quot; she said
&quot;Well. . . .&quot; Then I got in and drove off, feeling nothing but
terror. </p>

<p>All the way down 101, I was sure I would never make it the 96 miles
to Olympia. My beat up '78 pickup had passed its pre-trip exam successfully,
yet I lived through a thousand breakdowns in those few hours. The car didn't
sound or feel right. My last long-distance trip, it was the tires -- I
was sure theywould blow. This time, I had put on four brand-new radials.
This time it was the suspension. I could vividly picture a tie rod breaking,
sending my car careering into oncoming traffic. I imagined Rachel's grief
as the police came to the door to tell her I hadn't even made it to my
first gig. </p>

<p>Anytime I imagine my own death, it's not myself I worry about. My first
thought is for the bereaved, as if staying alive is something I do to avoid
causing my family and friends pain. It's a strange sort of guilt to bear,
born of conceit or denial or some other neurosis that I don't have a name
for. Whatever the cause, I was sufficiently preoccupied that I didn't think
to note my pre-trip mileage until Quilcene. 107700. None down and, at my
best guess, five thousand to go. </p>

<p>Vinny and Amy, my hosts in Olympia, live in one of those residential
areas that is right on the edge of affluence. Driving there, you go through
street after street of beautiful homes thinking, hey, these people have
done okay for themselves. Then you make that last turn and find the houses
suddenly shrunken and dirty, with battered cars parked in cracked driveways.
</p>

<p>When I arrive, Vinny is just home from the state legislature where he
drives a computer, and Amy is starting dinner. Vinny slouches on the sofa
while I change my guitar strings, and we reminisce about Franois, who
died of cancer last year. Franois and I were supposed to play together
at the Quincy Street coffeehouse the week he was diagnosed. Vinny and I
played instead, as a benefit, and were amazed to find that we had raised
over $400 for Franois' family. Meanwhile, in Seattle, Franois was receiving
the first of many unsuccessful chemotherapy treatments. That benefit was
the beginning of my musical association with Vinny. </p>

<p>After dinner, And after the three kids had been put to bed, Vinny got
his guitar out and we played the songs we used to do when I was in Vinny's
band. I'd forgotten how much I loved to play with Vinny, how good a songwriter
he is. We sang harmony together, Amy joining in on &quot;Quiet Times,&quot;
about Vinny's experiences as a young man in Canada. &quot;Quiet Times,
soft fresh snow/Cabins in Ontario/Oh, so many ways to go/Footprints like
a painting of what I have just been/Sweet memories of soft comforting days.&quot;

<p><b>Day 3-9 </b></p>

<p>In my mind, this tour is a string of dots on a map, connected by a smooth
line. In my mind, I roll down the road from one town to the next on an
efficient loop, each stop leading from the last to the next, but the realities
of scheduling dictate a few detours. Thus I found myself in Eugene, Oregon
on day 3, Portland on day 5, and back to Eugene for the rest of the week
to await a shipment of my new album from the CD pressing plant. </p>

<p>The weekend I arrived in Oregon, Eugene Celebration was in full swing.
This is a three-day music festival and street fair that swallows eight
blocks of downtown and attracts performers from all over the Northwest.
I spent the weekend shaking hands, making connections, and catching up
with Geoffrey and Wendy. Geoffrey was another friend of Franois'. The
two of them grew up in France together, then met up again in Santa Fe,
but Geoffrey was just a name to me until Franois' wake. Soon thereafter,
I spent three days at Geoffrey's house playing music and putting together
a memorial tape of Franois' music. I had not seen him for a year, and
the festival was an appropriate backdrop for a reunion. </p>

<p>At Celebration, I saw Don Latarski, Geoffrey's teacher and mentor, perform.
I was disappointed by the slickness, the commerciality, the safeness and
remoteness of his heavily processed electric guitar. What's wrong, I thought,
with real people playing real instruments, with vibrating strings and skins?
That night, shut behind four inches of acoustical insulation, I played
in the studio, exploring Geoffrey's synthesizers and MIDI guitar, trying
to make peace with a technology that I distrust but Geoffrey embraces.
</p>

<p>When I went to bed at 5 AM, mind racing, I dreamed of dark wet clay
flung aside before me as I tunneled in the earth. Rushing so fast in such
an improbable medium, I became conscious and was terrified for a moment
before I pulled myself back into the small carpeted and lightless room
that held me in this world. Is this what the old man meant, I wondered,
thinking of the previous night in Southern Washington, was I to till the
onions this way? I went back to sleep, glad of the lack of windows in the
studio as outside the sun, and Geoffrey, began the day.</p>

<h1><a name="Bodies"></a><b>TWO</b></h1>

<p><b>Some Bodies </b></p>

<p>Everyone in Boulder is beautiful. It doesn't show so much here, tonight.
It's cold outside and the heater has a large cafe and a bookstore to deal
with, and the doors open and close maybe twice a minute in both rooms.
Most all of us are bundled up in our seats, sitting with books or friends,
hunched over coffee or tea, biscotti, or day-old cinnamon roll. The cold
shows in the faces, but today in the streets it was sixty degrees and our
bodies smiled from out of our shirtsleeves. For a man like myself, who
can fall in love at the drop of a hat, it is exquisite torture. Today in
the streets, every woman was beautiful, cover models all, and I had to
admit, grudgingly, that all the men were equally lovely. </p>

<p>In Boulder, there is a level of fitness consciousness that borders on
mania. Mountain bikes are legion. Joggers and racewalkers own the mall.
One tavern I visited today advertises itself as &quot;the climber's bar.&quot;
I saw few people today who weren't slim, muscular, and attractive, their
skin glowing and smiles gleaming like a commercial for granola or organic
toothpaste. </p>

<p>I'm out of step here. Earlier in the tour, I was hiking up to ten miles
a day between gigs, enjoying the warmth of the Indian summer. Evenings
found me skateboarding at rest stops. Ever since Albuquerque, things have
changed. The weather cooled and I've been immersed in books, stretching
my mind where I was challenging my body. In the last few days, I've read
A prayer for Owen Meany, Cat and Mouse, and now Joyce, which I am sure
to finish tonight, now that the conversation around me has turned away
from the obvious dream to subjects less distracting; classes and books
and gossip and whatnot. </p>

<p>I tried to hike today, up on Flagstaff Peak in the city park, but I
didn't get far. The books drew me, and I eventually would up back at the
Trident. I haven't been on my skateboard, for one reason or another, since
somewhere in Arizona, but I remember the night I spent just south of Portland,
when I found out what rest areas are good for. This particular roadside
rest was enormous, three tiers of parking separated by swaths of forest
with long curving concrete paths. It was mostly uninhabited, and well-lit,
and I worked out on my board long into the night. Here, it's like it is
in most cities these days. There are No Skateboarding signs all over. I'm
afraid to even get it out of my car. </p>

<p>In the book, Stephen Dedalus is pondering over his own mind-body problem.
</p>

<ul>
<ul>
<p><i>&quot;Each of his senses was brought under a rigorous discipline.
In order to mortify the sense of sight he made it his rule to walk in the
street with downcast eyes, glancing neither to right nor left and never
behind him. His eyes shunned every encounter with the eyes of women. From
time to time also he balked them by a sudden effort of the will, as by
lifting them suddenly in the middle of an unfinished sentence and closing
the book.&quot; </i></p>
</ul>
</ul>

<p>&quot;Where I'm from,&quot; I say to the woman who refills my cup, &quot;we'd
never have anything good called 'Trident.' You see, the Trident nuclear
submarines are based nearby, in Puget Sound. So I was surprised to see
the name of the cafe.&quot; The woman looks at me, perplexed. </p>

<p>The day I returned from Portland it was nearly 100 degrees, warmer than
it had been all summer. My business in Oregon done, I had nothing to do
the rest of the week except wait for the shipment of CDs, so I went with
Geoffrey to Springfield, where he was building a kiln shed for Ann, his
mother-in-law. </p>

<p>It felt good to be out in the heat doing physical work, nailing up a
frame for the shed roof and hauling it with ropes and ladders up the side
of the finished and paneled stud walls, clambering on this lacy network
of two-by-fours to nail on the corrugated aluminum panels. Ann's house
sits on the Willamette river, and after the roof was finished, we fought
our way through ripe blackberry vines to strip and cool off in the surprisingly
chill shallows. For my volunteer effort, Ann presented me with a home-fired
cup, which I carefully packed up and mailed to Port Townsend. </p>

<p>On Friday evening, day 8, it became apparent that my shipment of CDs,
already a day late, would not arrive before I had to leave for my next
engagement in California the following Wednesday. It took several hours
of phone calls back and forth to the East coast to discover that yes, someone
in the shipping department had made a mistake and, no, the discs would
not arrive until Monday. The discs would have to be shipped overnight from
Eugene to Sacramento, where I would be staying until Wednesday. I slipped
into the bathtub to relax. </p>

<p>While I was in the tub, Carla arrived. She was a tall, slender redhead,
in Eugene to heal from some sort of broken relationship. After a fragrant
dinner of garlicky pesto and sweet homegrown corn, we washed dishes together.
Washing dishes turned into massages on the livingroom floor, turned into
a sudden rush to a late-night movie while Geoffrey and Wendy slept. Carla
was from Seattle. We were both of us lonely, but neither available. Had
my discs not been delayed, we might never have met. That late platonic
date had a feeling like &quot;oh yes, that's why I'm here now.&quot; As
if we stood at a point where threads converged from otherwise unrelated
directions. After the movie we stood in a long hug, not with the desperate
need of two people groping towards sexual resolution, but with a sweet
timeless feeling as if to say: here we are. Here are some bodies that need
to be held. </p>

<p>
<hr width="100%" ></p>

<h2><a name="BodSac"></a><b>Sacramento </b></h2>

<p><b>Day 11-15 </b></p>

<p>That mistake in shipping was neither the first nor the last of the problems
I had with the CDs. The title cut began with a phone conversation between
my roommate and his girlfriend, taped off a speakerphone in my room one
night when we were drunk and recording our semi-musical stupidity. I had
already shipped the master off to be pressed when the girlfriend called
to withdraw the permission that Todd had granted to use their voices. I
managed to stop production of the discs and ship off a new master, but
became increasingly nervous as weeks passed and the now legally dangerous
first master didn't arrive. </p>

<p>I called the plant again and expressed my fears, asking again that they
ship me master #1 to avoid confusion. No problem, I was told. When the
Federal Express driver knocked on Lisa's door Tuesday morning, day 13,
my first priority became to listen to the disc, to prove to myself that
my fear was unfounded. As Lisa had no disc player, this meant posing as
a buyer, at a Sacramento audio store. &quot;I'm a record producer,&quot;
I explained to the poor store owner, whose immaculate upscale establishment
seemed uncontaminated by customers, &quot;so I know what to listen for.
I know every noise on this disc by heart.&quot; </p>

<p>I think I did a good job of concealing the sudden lurch my intestines
took as I heard track 11 begin, not with a pulsing solo bass, but with
familiar voices, echoed and re-echoed. &quot;I've been totally out of control
since you left.&quot; &quot;What do you mean?&quot; &quot;I've been hanging
out with Nick.&quot; &quot;And. . .?&quot; &quot;Banging drums and playing
guitars.&quot; It was too late to call New Hampshire when I returned to
Lisa's, which was a good thing, as my contact at the plant would have gotten
a spate of mindless anger, the sound of my spleen grown so large that it
filled and then exceeded my physical dimensions. Lisa's doorjambs got a
thorough beating. </p>

<p>The next morning, my voice was shaky but reasonable. I wrote in my journal,
&quot;Called disc company and demanded satisfaction.&quot; The tension
of that couple of days was compounded by two things. First, the Sacramento
area had been up above 100 for the better part of a week, and no amount
of ice water and shorts could eliminate the horrid stickiness that was
the late afternoon. Second, the heat and the smallness of Lisa's one-room
apartment forced us to discover in a very short time that we really didn't
like each other very much. Our initial meeting had been brief and fiery.
In the course of four days under my roof while she visited another of my
roommates, we decided we were friends. I was attracted to her flaming red
hair and facewide smile, she to my easygoing, peaceful approach to running
a household. In our brief correspondence, she extended the invitation to
stay with her when I came through. Cramped into a small, hot apartment,
face to face with real-time personalities, we grated, and by the end of
the second day we had admitted as much to each other. The last day of my
visit was an agreed truce, full of the same obsessive beer drinking and
pasta eating that had marked the first two days, but with a mutual understanding
that, much as we could appreciate each other's lives - her art, my music
- our minds and bodies were not meant to connect. Returning that night
from my gig in Davis, high from good playing and an appreciative crowd,
I saw a meteorite glowing large and orange and falling slowly above the
freeway. As I watched, it split in two, the fragments spinning off in different
directions before dissolving into darkness. </p>

<h2><a name="BodLA"></a><b>Los Angeles </b></h2>

<p><b><i>Day 22 - 34</i> </b></p>

<p>My ten year high-school reunion was the seed event for this tour. The
reunion was held in the place we graduated - in an alley surrounded by
ex-warehouses. Now, however, the physical plant has benefited from an influx
of funds, especially the one-point-something-million-dollar new arts center
that seems to me to be a slap in the face of the poor Chicano community
in which this ritzy arts/prep school is located. Everyone at the reunion
looked so good - tanned, muscular. They all thought it was cool that I
was offered a gig opening for Jethro Tull in Davis in December, and they
all promised to come. </p>

<p>I was able to take some credit for the reunion, as it was I who took
the time to track down missing classmates and procure new addresses so
that the school could assemble the event. It was I who, after much research,
managed to track down the father of a good friend who had disappeared from
my life soon after graduation. I was somewhat shocked to find that he had
died four years previously, from complications surrounding a case of Pneumonia.
Brett had been openly gay - and promiscuous - in the early '80s, when I
knew him, and my assumption is that his death was from AIDS, though I did
not bring up the possibility with his father. I didn't know whether his
parents knew - or would admit knowing - about Brett's lifestyle. </p>

<p>The real coup of the reunion was getting Allisen to come. Allisen was
my next-door-neighbor for a few years in school, and became the subject
of the most intense obsession I have ever known. For two years, in the
face of almost no contact with her, I wrote her long, passionate loveletters,
letters that she enjoyed, but to which she could not respond. She didn't
graduate with our class but knew most of us, so I made a point of inviting
her. When we saw each other, we took off alone for awhile, toured the grounds
on our own. I wish I had known her back in school as I knew her for those
few minutes - as a real woman with whom I could connect in a real way,
rather than as a fantasy figure who happened to have the willowy body and
long blonde hair that I dreamed of. At fifteen, she was a model, but she
now works at the other end of the magazine world, selling advertising.</p>

<center><p>* * * * * </p></center>

<p>A passage from Joyce has reminded me of a moment earlier in this odyssey.
Leaving Tucson on day 41, I took the advice of the bartender from the night
before, on whose floor I spent the night, and drove through Patagonia and
Sonoita to Nogales, one of many identical border towns on the southern
edge of the US. I walked across into Mexico where, in a shop window, I
saw a beautiful young girl with whom I shared a long interested glance.
The moment passed, and I carried her with me for part of the day. Now,
Stephen Dedalus is experiencing a similar moment. </p>

<ul>
<ul>
<p><i>&quot;She was alone and still, gazing out to sea; and when she felt
his presence and the worship of his eyes her eyes turned to him in quiet
sufferance of his gaze, without shame or wantonness. Long, long she suffered
his gaze and then quietly withdrew her eyes from his and bent them towards
the stream, gently stirring the water with her foot hither and thither.
The first faint noise of gently moving water broke the silence, low and
faint and whispering, faint as the bells of sleep; hither and thither,
hither and thither; and a faint flame trembled on her cheek.&quot; </i></p>
</ul>
</ul>

<p>This seems to hold the mood of this place for me now. I am reflecting
myself in these books, living internally, reading and writing myself into
what I have lived these past months. Preparing myself for my return to
Port Townsend, and Rachel. Preparing myself for how different I must now
be, and so how different it will be to be home, at rest. </p>

<h2><a name="BodAlb"></a>Albuquerque</h2>

<p><b><i>Day 50-80</i></b> </p>

<p>This is where it changed for me, for my body. This is where I made my
descent into hell, and the transition into winter. I can trace the origins
of the disease to Flagstaff, where I shared some wine with a Navajo street
person. Later, I let him sleep in the back of my truck just inches from
me because it was going to be a very cold night. Perhaps I saved his life
and damned my own. </p>

<p>At the rest stop on the Acoma reservation, I hiked through amazing amber-colored
air to a black rock canyon where my body suddenly rebelled. Tachycardia,
hyperventilation, weak knees. I recognized the symptoms of extreme fear,
yet did not have the accompanying emotions. I tried to rock climb anyway,
to get past whatever my body was experiencing. Yet, I was extremely relieved
to leave that place and whatever it was that I had been feeling. </p>

<p>On the continental divide, East of Gallup, NM, I woke with exceptionally
good vision. Slight headache, but I could actually drive without glasses.
By the time I drove into Albuquerque, I could tell I was getting sick.
</p>

<p>Victor's apartment in Albuquerque was not a pleasant place to be sick.
Smaller than this cafe is just a start. I can't think in terms of dimensions;
only that, however small I remember it, it was smaller. Fitting three people
into the kitchen, largest room in the house, was uncomfortable. Victor's
bed was a narrow single, and I slept on the floor next to it, my body taking
up the rest of the available room. The heater was stuck on. </p>

<p>For the two weeks I was there, the television was on 24 hours a day,
and Victor chainsmoked whenever he was awake. It was too cold to leave
a window open, so the smoke just circulated, accumulated, and finally came
to rest on every surface. </p>

<p>Victor's work schedule, at a chain of porno theaters and video stores,
was 8 PM to 3 AM. On either end of that time, friends and customers of
his would show up to smoke pot and cigarettes and drink whatever alcohol
was available. At least once, I tried to sleep while he got head from a
teenage Chicana, then phoned her boyfriend to brag about it. Victor tried
to come out to the coffeehouse where I would hang out days and play evenings,
but he quickly became bored, and we went out to a loud bar to get drunk
and play darts instead. I tried to fit into his lifestyle, riding around
town too fast on the back of his motorcycle, but it just wasn't me. Victor
complained, when we were both awake, about the smell of the raw garlic
that wafted from my body, and my constant cough and runny nose. Still,
I was glad to have someplace I could stay and recuperate, together with
a break in my schedule. </p>

<p>Luckily, Victor wasn't my only friend in Albuquerque. Bob Reeves, novelist,
poet, songwriter, and former Port Townsendite, teaches at the University
of New Mexico, and I spent many hours perched before his computer screen
playing interactive fiction games, killing my eyes while my lungs healed.
And, Albuquerque was not without culture. Victor accompanied me to the
state fairgrounds, where we saw a traveling exhibition of the works of
MC Escher.</p>

<p>Rachel flew in during this time, and we spent Thanksgiving with my relatives
in Santa Fe. Seeing her was a mix of strangeness and unaccustomed normalcy,
and it was nice that a friend of Bob's who was out of town let us use her
apartment to relax together and enjoy the first sex we'd had in two months.</p>

<p>
<hr width="100%" ></p>

<h1><a name="Music"></a>THREE </h1>

<p><b>Some Music</b></p>

<p>I can't seem to sit and write without frequent breaks to stare into
the distance. In cafes, unless I'm lucky enough to be by a window, this
usually involves making involuntary eye contact, requiring me to glaze
suddenly and look away or, even more dangerous, get into a conversation.
At Macy's in Flagstaff, it was Spencer, a nice-looking towheaded twentysomething
who was on the run from life in Bisbee, a small town in Southeastern Arizona
that was later profiled to me as a played-out town that had been taken
over by hippies. Spencer was glad to be on the road, riding a lovely green
BMW bike, wearing oldfashioned aviators canvas hood with goggles under
his compulsory helmet. I couldn't help but think that he was John-Boy Walton
trying to escape. John-Boy on a bike.</p>

<p>Here at the Trident, there doesn't seem to be that danger. Even in LA,
the city of impersonality, conversation was inevitable. Boulder seems peopled
with impenetrable bubbles of selves. Perhaps it's the locale - this place
is so trendy that it seems too risky to connect without first checking
pedigrees. So crowded that, having sat down with me, you risk not having
a chance to move if I prove to be a jerk. </p>

<p>Somehow, I connect this impersonality with my difficulty in getting
a gig in this town. I see little evidence of folk music culture here. Club
Makalu across the street seems to be always closed. Penny Lane, which seems
to be the main game in town, is run by a manager who doesn't seem to care
for out-of-town artists, and I've heard from people who have played there
that it's a loud, obnoxious gig at the best of times. In general, my impression
of Boulder is of a terribly exciting place full of terribly exciting people
who are unwilling to take personal chances. </p>

<p>The exception is at KGNU, the local NPR affiliate. I interviewed on
the air with Sam Fuqua, a news guy standing in for the folk DJ. Even there,
I saw signs of that impenetrability. The local, syndicated, live music
show, E-town, was apparently more and more closed to unknown musicians
as NPR pressured the producers to feature national artists. My general
impression of KGNU, however, was one of warmth and acceptance. I stayed
long after my slot, reading the bulletin boards and talking with staff.
</p>

<p>The big surprise was in LA. I expected to find little opportunity for
an original acoustic act. Instead, I found a thriving folk music scene,
a healthy creative underground taking on the electronic music world that
dominates corporate California.</p>

<h2><a name="musdavis"></a>Davis </h2>

<p><b><i>Day 13</i></b> </p>

<p>The guy who booked me to play at UC Davis did so because he came from
Northern Oregon and had a thing about supporting Northwest Artists. He
came to the show and loved the tunes so much that he offered me a gig opening
for Jethro Tull at the college stadium in December. It was a heady offer,
and I accepted right away, even though it meant making a mad dash from
Denver after my last gig. He assured me that he'd try to set it up and
that I should call him from further down the road. As it turned out, not
only did he not have the authority to offer the gig, he mostly forgot about
it. By the time I got to Albuquerque, it had gone from &quot;You're definitely
in,&quot; to &quot;Oh, well if you wanted to send me a tape, I could try
to get it to their manager.&quot; Still, Davis, with its veritable sea
of bicycles, proved to be a positive experience. I played well, the cafeteria
crowd was responsive, and I ended my visit the next night at 3 AM, playing
live on KDVS with a smuggled in bottle of Guinness and some quickly remembered
Led Zeppelin covers. </p>

<p>
<hr width="100%" ></p>

<h2><a name="musla"></a>Los Angeles </h2>

<p>I was born in LA, and spent the first 20 years of my life walking, biking,
and skateboarding its streets, but the two weeks I spent there on tour
were like discovering a whole new city. </p>

<p>Musically, LA is replete with opportunities to play, in the form of
open mic nights. While I didn't avail myself of every one, I could have
played every night for at least two weeks, a different venue every night.
When I came to town, I only had one contact, at the Methodist church in
Echo Park, which hosts the Basement Coffeehouse series. This was perhaps
the most casual open mic I've attended, partially due to the sparse attendance.
About seven performers arrived, most of them comics and poets. This was
a new thing to me, being used to open mics that were wall-to-wall music,
but it was an interesting change. </p>

<p>My friend James, someone I grew up with, and who was my host for my
two weeks in LA, told me about the Iguana, a cafe near his house in North
Hollywood. This was a very comfortable place, arranged like a living room,
and while it was oriented more towards music than the Basement Coffeehouse,
there were again poets and comics in the mix. </p>

<p>Performance order for these two shows was by the lottery method. There
was the customary writing down of names on small slips of paper which were
then put into a hat, bag, or can, but instead of the Emcee making up a
list beforehand, the hat or whatever was handed to each performer as they
left the stage, to draw the name of the next artist. This served to keep
all the musicians focused on the stage, rather than milling around backstage,
or outside. </p>

<p>The Iguana provided two of the musical highlights of my trip. One was
a group consisting of guitar, tablas, Chapman stick, and two vocalists,
playing material as interestingly composed as the ensemble. The other was
truly inspiring - a homeless man walked in off the street, and delivered
a riveting song about his life on the street, using a borrowed guitar.
Afterwards, he acted embarrassed, and refused to play a second song, walking
back out into the darkness as we gave him a standing ovation. </p>

<p>Talking with musicians at the Iguana led to me showing up at Mama Pajama
the next night. The venue, a coffeehouse and clothing store on Venice Blvd.,
was unimpressive, but it provided entree into the circle of LA folk musicians.
Key to this was a man named Jim Prior, whose guitar technique was so unusual
that I cajoled him into giving me a lesson the following morning at his
apartment in Culver City. His playing style, which he calls the Wiggle,
is based on a pulse produced by strumming downstrokes with the pick, and
striking the face of the guitar with the third and fourth fingers with
each stroke. He calls this pulse a &quot;kicker,&quot; and credits songwriter
and performer Rod Smear with passing it on to him. The rest of the Wiggle
is accomplished with hammer-on and pull-off techniques in the left hand
and upstrokes with the pick in the right. The technique feels strongly
like frailing a banjo, but the sound is an unusual and intricate hybrid
of rock and flamenco. It's driving and very contagious. </p>

<p>Jim told me about what was to become my favorite LA open mic - the Highland
Grounds in Hollywood. I think the best word for entertainment at the Grounds
is &quot;Performance Art.&quot; My first night there, I saw everything
from a sexy redhead in a bodysuit singing a cappella to a man in fishnet
stockings playing a toy saxophone while his partner recorded audience members
screaming and then played the tape over the PA. My own set went over well,
and the emcee gave me one of my best quotes afterwards when he referred
to me as &quot;a genuine virtuoso.&quot; </p>

<p>The Grounds is small and packed, and I found myself at a table with
several other musicians, among them Jim Prior, and a physicist-turned songwriter
named Jim Savarino who was to become a good musical friend. The person
running the door at the Grounds that night was Teeka Ballas, a very beautiful
17-year-old deadhead whose looks and personality had such an impact on
me that I wrote one of my best guitar tunes, &quot;Little Flower,&quot;
for her the next day, sitting in James' back yard in the sun and smog with
a guitar in my arms and a faraway look in my eyes. </p>

<p>
<hr width="100%" ></p>

<h2><a name="mustucs"></a>Tucson </h2>

<p>Tucson Arizona distinguished itself with the combination of cheapest
gas and best playing fees of the entire trip. My venue was the Cushing
Street Bar, a nice spot on the Southern fringe of downtown, just a few
blocks of KXCI, the local public radio station. The two shows I played
there were poorly attended, and other musicians I've spoken to have confirmed
that this is normal, so how they can afford to pay what they pay is beyond
me. However, this may explain the high quality of other musicians I met
while I was there. </p>

<p>When I arrived at Cushing Street, I found nobody who knew what was going
on. Somebody pointed towards an outbuilding, saying something about a PA
in there. I managed to find most of the parts, and hauled them into the
bar. As I was setting up, an odd, intense, balding man offered his help.
At some point, he gestured vaguely towards the tape deck behind the bar,
which was playing some interesting new-agey jazz piano music. &quot;Know
who this is?&quot; he asked. &quot;You?&quot; I guessed. He put out his
hand. &quot;Arvid Munson.&quot; </p>

<p>A few minutes later, Arvid was leading me downtown to the music store
in search of a microphone clip, and telling me stories about playing organ
with Sam Cooke's tour band. Once in the store, he told me &quot;You have
to meet Rainer,&quot; and led me down into the basement, where a lithe
young man was dressing the fretboard on an old Gibson hollowbody guitar.
Rainer was apparently the leader of the hot Tucson blues band. Arvid spoke
quite highly of his playing, which I've yet to hear. </p>

<p>A guitarist I did get to hear in Tucson is a soloist by the name of
Don Reeve. Don plays electroacoustic guitar through a rack of effects and
two amps in stereo. His music is loud, mesmerizing, and very textural.
When I met him, he had just released his second album, , and was getting
good feedback from commercial radio, a medium that I, with my eclectic
and unusual variety of sounds, have not tried to access. </p>

<p>Public Radio, on the other hand, provided me with some of my favorite
road memories. In Tucson, I managed to grab a last-minute spot on KXCI,
thanks to the kindness of the artist who was already booked, who let me
share his hour since I was passing through. </p>

<h2><a name="musalb"></a>Albuquerque </h2>

<p>Albuquerque was a good radio town. When I was setting up the tour, I
hooked up by phone with Sam Bawcum at KUNM, the public station at the University
of New Mexico. Sam had worked as a booker, and volunteered to help set
up gigs for me in town. He didn't actually have any shows set up for me
when I arrived, but he had opened just enough doors. </p>

<p>When I walked into the station to look for him, I hooked up instead
with Chris Martn, who was just about to go on the air with &quot;Free
Form.&quot; She threw my disc into a much-abused player in the record library,
and previewed a few tracks. I then followed her into the control room and
helped her assemble the first part of the show. We matched up some new
Pink Floyd live recordings with &quot;Frank Floyd Wright,&quot; a Floyd/Zappa
inspired multitrack improv I had assembled using samples I had collected
from all over. She interviewed me briefly, played &quot;Trendy Brenda,&quot;
and then I left to check out EJ's caf. </p>

<p>I was lucky enough to arrive in town about the time that EJ's (a folk-music
venue, and vegetarian caf near the university) changed managership. The
new manager made several drastic changes, including abolishing smoking
in the building and firing all the musicians on the current calendar. On
Sam's recommendation, he listened to me, and, liking what he heard, he
plugged me into the newly vacated spots. For two weeks, I lived at EJ's,
recuperating from my illness, and playing for meals and tips. I even emceed
the Monday night open mic, and got to meet some of the locals. </p>

<p>Sam's recommendation was again instrumental in getting me a featured
artist spot on KUNM's live variety show, broadcast from Tom Guralnick's
Outpost Performance Space. The show, done in front of an appreciative audience,
mixed my live set with improvised comedy sketches, in which I was able
to participate as well. </p>

<h2><a name="mussanfe"></a>Santa Fe </h2>

<p>Despite its reputation as a center for the arts, and its importance
in my life as a physical location for several seminal experiences, Santa
Fe almost misses having a place in this narrative. Santa Fe is a place
that, like Boulder, was nearly barren for me in terms of my professional
musical life. The exception was an enthusiastic but disappointing interview
with Johnny Lyons at KIOT, my one and only brush with commercial radio
on this trip. </p>

<p>Johnny had a commercial radio voice and a commercial radio attitude.
He seemed unable to grasp or respond to my mystical and unabashedly sexual
views on the creative process. I think that I intuitively or purposely
laid it out there in a very graphic way in reaction to his conservative
commercial approach. </p>

<p>Santa Fe was full of this polarity. Thanksgiving with my cousin CJ and
his mother Ann was a tense tightrope walk above Ann's crazy, tightlipped
repression, but we followed it with a relaxed evening with CJ's friend
Moira and members of her improvisational percussion group at a housesit
near Tesuque. We pulled out drums and, lacking enough drums, began to beat
on pots and pans, drumming well into the night. </p>

<p>After Thanksgiving, Rachel and I drove to Taos where she had an appointment
to view some of Michael Reynolds' earthships, partially underground houses
built of recycled tires and aluminum cans. These homes combine passive
solar heating with ambient earth temperature to create an efficient, self-heating
space. One such dwelling we visited, only half-completed, was nearly 80
degrees inside despite snow and 20 degree weather outside. Rachel had the
idea of building one of these structures in Port Townsend, possibly on
my land, to see if the idea was feasible in the Northwest. The drawback
was extensive use of adobe, a problematic material in a wet climate, but
something we thought we could work around. </p>

<p>Seeing these houses in person made the idea seem more feasible, and
we talked all the way back to Albuquerque about how to scrounge old tires
and other materials. The county landfill outside of Port Townsend was stockpiling
green glass, a glut in the market having made recycling it unfeasible,
and we considered the possibility of using green glass bottles in lieu
of aluminum cans for insulating air space. </p>

<p>The next day, I took Rachel back to the airport. We had discussed the
possibility of driving to Denver together, or even of sharing the rest
of the trip home, but her work schedule along with various logistical problems
(there was barely enough room in the back of the truck for me at night
as it was) made us decide against it. So, I dropped her off at the Albuquerque
airport, turned right back around, and drove northward up I-25, Colorado-bound.
</p>

<h2><a name="musCsprings"></a>Colorado Springs</h2>

<p>By the time I hit the Colorado Border just south of Trinidad, the ice
and snow were getting serious, making the driving slower. It had been fine
all the way from Albuquerque, through Santa Fe and the gently sloping,
curving plateau that leads up to Raton, where the Rockies suddenly rear
up and hoist the road onto their shoulders. From the border all the way
to Colorado Springs it was real cold and real ice, and I was glad I had
a warm place to stay with people who were expecting me.</p>

<center><p>* * * * * </p></center>

<p>It is getting late, Joyce is lying spent on the table in front of me,
and I am sipping my tea, practically tealess after hours of hot water refills
with no new bag. I am thinking about Stephen's life, his choices, and the
things that made me decide to leave my job and come out here on the road
to pursue my dreams, to cast myself into the void with no prospects, and
practically nothing holding me back. What would happen now if I did not
return, if the road, the desert, the open sky became a new home? Could
I leave Rachel, my mortgage, my friends behind and begin a new life here,
now? The prospect frightens me. I am homesick. I long for the security
and the safeness of a life already built.</p>

<p>I look back over the women I have met on this trip, ponder my willingness
to be with them, physically and otherwise, my lack of guilt over my tendency
to fall into new relationships. Have I missed Rachel's presence on this
trip? Could I actually leave her? I'm afraid the answer to both questions
is no. Too many choices. For better or for worse, it seems easier to stay
where I am than it is to reevaluate and sort out the many threads of my
conflicting desires. </p>

<p>As I pay for my tea and a few postcards, the cashier smiles, and the
questions remain in front of me. &quot;I'll see you again,&quot; I say,
not sure if I mean it. This place holds something for me, and I must return,
yet I do not know if I will be able to escape again once I get home and
confront the financial reality of this tour: I have not done well, and
I do not have the cash reserves to absorb what I have spent. </p>

<p>I crawl into the back of my pickup, parked in the KGNU lot, and arrange
my things for the night. Tapes and CDs are stacked against the passport
window. Guitars stack on their sides on the left wheelwell. My backpack
goes on top of the CDs, my skateboard on top of that. My shoes come off
and go on the right wheelwell. The contents of my pockets, my glasses,
all go into the shoes. After three months, it is a well-developed routine
that I can do in the dark. My sleeping bag unrolls over my futon, and I
climb in, clothed. I grope for my gallon jug of water, always by my left
foot with my hiking boots. I take a long pull.</p>

<p>Tomorrow is my last day in Colorado. My last gig is in Denver, tomorrow
night. Then there is the long drive home. Not to Montana, where I was hoping
for a week-long gig at a ski resort. Not to Davis for the ephemeral show
with Jethro Tull. I am winding it up, preparing for the return from the
unknown to the familiar. My mind races, and I fall to sleep early in the
morning, no closer to answers. </p>

<h2><a name="musVVS"></a>Verde Valley School</h2>

<p><b><i>Day 45</i></b> </p>

<p>Of all the experiences I've had on the road, the one I had here will
have the most direct and immediate effect on my life. This is where I almost
went to high school - my second choice. I was here only once before, sixteen
years ago, on a trip with my mother. We came to Sedona because it was beautiful,
and made a side trip to the school because of its excellent reputation.
What brought me here this trip was that memory. </p>

<p>I was already booked at the Thousand Trails RV resort in Cottonwood,
just down the road. So, I called the school and offered to give a free
concert. The headmaster loved the idea, gave me names and numbers of newspapers
for promotion. When I arrived, my contact at the school, Dave Smeeth, was
off on a field trip. I found the auditorium, and was greeted by squalor.
Mattresses, scaffolding, discarded clothing, and bowls of jello - all remains
of the school Hallowe'en party - filled the building. It took me most of
the afternoon to clean it up. When Dave arrived back that evening, he was
extremely apologetic, and he organized a crew of kids to haul the mattresses,
now neatly stacked at the back of the hall, back to the dorm rooms whence
they came. </p>

<p>After my show (attended by a whopping four people), I was invited to
stay on at the school and, having no immediate obligations, I accepted.
I spent the next four days rockclimbing, sitting in on classes, eating
in the cafeteria, playing and composing on the school's Steinway, and sleeping
in the loft of the auditorium. Dave, a fellow musician and new friend,
was teaching geology, and I was introduced to the writing of John McPhee
while sitting in on his class (Basin and Range. Later, in Boulder, I made
a point of buying and reading two of his other books). </p>

<p>It was Dave who, during lunch at the cafeteria, encouraged me to consider
coming back to teach. I would need to complete my BA, but the school was
not requiring certification. Roy Grimm further whet my appetite by inviting
me to apply for project period, a ten-day event in January where teachers
came from the outside to teach a variety of disciplines. After this, I
took my exploration of the school more seriously, forming connections with
both teachers and kids, including Beth, a very flirtatious 12-year-old
strawberry blonde who developed a crush on me during a game of Ping Pong.
I let her wear my leather jacket for the rest of my stay, and was relieved
that she was honorable enough to give it back when I left. </p>

<p>It was Roy Grimm who suggested that I visit the Colorado Springs School.
Housed on a beautiful estate in that city, this was another progressive
private school. Roy was the former headmaster, and his replacement, , graciously
accepted me into his home for a few days while I visited the school and
scouted this college/military community for musical opportunities. I played
two pick-up gigs while I was there, and spent the rest of my time in John's
hot tub, reading John Irving, and contemplating the sunny, but cold Rocky
Mountain scenery. </p>

<p>Again, I spent time in classes, talked with teachers, played for an
assembly, and I happened to mention to several people that I was considering
getting my BA, contingent on finding a program that would let me do it
quickly, without a residence requirement. Anne, the science teacher, happened
to know of just such a program - the University Without Walls at Regis
University in Denver. </p>

<p>
<hr width="100%" ></p>

<h1><a name="Snakes"></a>FOUR</h1>

<p><b>Some Snakes</b></p>

<p>It's nearly one AM, and I'm sitting at the counter at My Brother's Bar
in Denver, contemplating my Guinness. Things are not looking good. The
four fellows to my right are talking animatedly to Greg, the bartender,
about the airline industry. They are British, ranging in age from mid twentysomething
to over fifty, and they build flight simulators. They are here to build
simulators for new planes about to be delivered to Stapleton airport. Then
it's off to Tenerife, or some such spot. </p>

<p>Miss Colorado was in here earlier, but she's left. Greg, and the Brits,
are very entertaining. I could sit here all night, but I glance over at
the far corner of the room where my PA equipment and guitars are, and I
realize that it's now or never. And I'm antsy. And I want to be back home.
I will drive at least as far as Cheyenne tonight. </p>

<p>My car is not in the best condition for traveling. Leaving Regis University
today, having spoken to an academic advisor and picked up an application
for the UWW program, my turn signals cut out. Then, the headlights wouldn't
work. I took it to a mechanic. No, they wouldn't be able to look at it
today. I found a spent fuse, and replaced it. The turn signal came back.
Then it went out again. I replaced the fuse again. The turn signal would
work, then start to make a buzzing sound, then cut out. I could wait out
the weekend, then have the car fixed, but I am too impatient. I will drive
like hell, and have the car fixed wherever I am on Monday. </p>

<p>I trudge back to the far corner of the room and start to pack up my
things. In the car, it is cold. Too cold for me. Ever since I was a child
I've dreamed frequently about snakes. I think of the snake - particularly
the rattlesnake - as my totem animal. Rattlesnakes hibernate in this weather.
Here, they have been in their dens for months. </p>

<p>As if in response to my thoughts, the turn signal buzzes like a rattle,
then cuts out again, dead. I pull over to replace the fuse, and muse over
that animal that has provided a central theme to this otherwise disjointed
tour. </p>

<p>
<hr width="100%" ></p>

<h2><a name="snakshasta"></a>Mt. Shasta </h2>

<p>I started hiking out from rest areas out of boredom. After leaving Eugene,
I had four days before I had to be in Davis. So, rather than drive long
and hard straight to Sacramento, I drove to a rest area south of Medford
for the first night. Most rest areas are marked with parking limits - usually
somewhere between 6 and 24 hours. But, I found out after several nights
spent in the back of the truck that this rule is seldom, if ever, enforced.
I was never harassed by anybody, official or otherwise, at any point during
this trip, for parking or any other reason. </p>

<p>At the rest area near Medford, I took my first hike, down a dismal gravel
frontage road to an even more dismal gravel pit. Once I got out of the
gravel pit and into the hills behind, the going was much more pleasant
- rolling grassy foothills with a muddy stream cutting a steep swath back
towards the highway. I started back at a good pace when somebody arrived
at the gravel pit for target practice. I could hear the sharp report of
each shot followed by a reverberant boom as the sound came back echoed
and re-echoed off the many small hills. I could imagine some drunk backwoods
type, unpleasant at the best of times, but more so under the influence
of alcohol and carrying a gun. </p>

<p>I made my way through the ravine cut by the stream, keeping low to be
safe from stray gunfire. What if I look like a deer?, I thought. I kept
out of sight. Once on the flats, I hiked through the trees on a carpet
of trees criscrossed by many paths, until I somehow managed to find the
one that led back to the rest area.</p>

<p>The whole hike, that first time, I was paranoid about all my stuff left
in the truck. Guitars, amp, mikes, clothes, skateboard. It had not yet
become routine to leave my car for hours at a time, valuables locked in
the cab. I was almost surprised to return to my car and find it untouched.
Later, I realized that my practice was relatively uncommon; that most cars
in rest areas are left unattended for such short periods that theft is
hardly possible. Hence, car prowlers do not frequent these places. </p>

<p>At the rest area near Mount Shasta, a CalTrans worker unlocked a gate
to give me access to the woody scrub hills that rose steeply on one side.
I found a power company easement that gave me access to the hills which
turned out to support a residential community (hence the cyclone fence
keeping travelers from intruding). After several steep ups and downs, I
came to a low summit. Nearly to the top, I spotted a huge bird soaring
above me, so big that I assumed it must be a California condor, an endangered
bird more a legend to me than anything I ever expected to meet. A dropped
feather on the trail, about 15&quot; long, became part of the paraphernalia
dangling from my rearview mirror. (Later, in Petrified Forest National
Park, in Arizona, a park ranger asked me what the feather was. When I told
him my suspicion, he asked &quot;you know that's illegal to possess?&quot;
He did not confiscate the feather, but told me to keep it out of sight
until I was out of the park.) </p>

<p>The type of vegetation and dry earth here reminded me of hiking in L.A.,
and I was careful to keep watch for rattlesnakes, tossing rocks ahead of
me when walking in the low scrub to alert possible snakes to my presence.
When I returned to the car after scaling the fence back into the rest area,
I wrote a postcard to Rachel, making reference to the signs warning of
poison oak in the manicured bark gardens that lined the periphery of the
parking area. Hiking at the Mt. Shasta rest area, keeping a watchful eye
out for Crotalus Atrox and Quercus Irritans. </p>

<p>
<hr width="100%" ></p>

<h2><a name="snakweston"></a>Weston </h2>

<p>The watchful eye was still with me in the great valley when, near Modesto,
I stopped for the night at the Weston safety rest area. Here the signs
were for the snakes, not the Ivy. &quot;Warning,&quot; screamed the large
yellow triangles, &quot;there may be rattlesnakes in this area.&quot; </p>

<p>The hills looked inviting, so I hopped over the barbed wire fence and
took off on a cow path across the dry grass, up a narrow crevice between
two mammalian hills that were terraced as if for erosion control. All the
way across the pastureland, I eyed the cows nervously, remembering all
the many stories I'd read of dead runs before red-eyed bulls. When I had
to pass the herd, I did so on the far side of the barbed wire, passing
beneath the giant towers of the high-voltage lines, which seemed to be
the preferred hangout for the cattle. </p>

<p>The path I took, up the narrow crack, led eventually to the top of a
ridge, along which ran two well-worn tracks. They wound across the ridge,
up and down like a ribbon spit-pasted to the tops of the hills. I tried
to imagine driving that track in my truck, and decided that a jeep would
be better suited. Following the track off into the distance, my eyes wound
up at the ranch house that I supposed was the headquarters for this hundreds-of-acres
operation. I wondered if they were watching me. Only with binoculars, I
thought. Or a rifle sight. I was, after all, trespassing, and I didn't
know the attitude of the owners towards hikers. </p>

<p>I turned my attention to the land below, spread out before me, and I
saw two appealing canyons eroded into the dirt, sharp-edged and bare in
contrast to the rest of the miles and miles of brown grass. I started down,
leaving the road and the rest area behind on the far side of the ridge.
The canyons were fascinating. I could see how they drained water off the
hills into a small streambed. A road ran alongside the stream, and a very
few trees raised their branches between the two. The canyons, about ten
feet across, a hundred feet long, and twenty feet deep, were the only signs
of water erosion in the landscape, and I wondered why they existed there
alone. </p>

<p>As I walked up the first canyon, a beautiful light-grey owl flew from
a hole high in the wall, taking off in a straight line and not looking
back, in an attempt to lead me from the nest that must have been above
me. The second canyon housed a small hawk or falcon of some sort. </p>

<p>Hiking down to the stream bed, I saw what first appeared to be a sliver
of glass, but which turned out to be mineral - a flat sheet of soft, transparent
material that I assumed must be a mica of some sort. As I hiked back down
the road, I saw more and more of it in larger and larger pieces, some of
it trampled into glittering sand on the trail where hooves had pounded
it into the clay. Even the largest pieces were transparent and had the
same single cleavage plane as the first small piece. Suddenly, I looked
up at a hillside of soft dirt and saw it all around me, sparkling and throwing
prismatic reflections everywhere. Many of the pieces were the size of large
bricks, and I guessed that there was enough of it to build a small house.
I took a large piece of it with me. </p>

<p>At the bottom of the road was a gate, easily climbed, and the stream
bed meandered its way across the flat pastureland to empty through a culvert
under the highway. I kept to the stream bed as this kept me low and out
of sight of cows or men. </p>

<p>The stream made its way to the fence I had followed up the hill, and
there I found carnage: carcasses of perhaps ten, perhaps twenty sheep,
mostly rotten, piles of bones and hide with dried meat still clinging to
the bones. I guessed at some epidemic that decimated the flock. From the
pile I took an unbroken skull, easily detached, which I later cleaned and
wired to the hood of my car to bleach in the sun. </p>

<p>It was not far past the ovine graveyard that a sudden buzzing stopped
my feet. It was not so much a rattle as a hissing sound, a sizzle like
water thrown in a hot pan, like milk being steamed behind any espresso
counter in the world. I couldn't see the snake at first. The sound seemed
to come from everywhere. I was on a ridge above the stream bed at this
point, and it was a few seconds before I saw him coiled below me in the
sand, six feet away, partially hidden in the sparse brush. The mental process
that followed seemed long only because of the many years of fear spoken
at me by parents, teachers, and others. Stories of the viciousness, agility,
and strength of these small animals. </p>

<p>I knew that I had nothing to fear, that the snake was putting up a show
to scare me off. My fascination with snakes mingled and fought with a lifetime
of warnings - the same paranoia that gave rise to the yellow signs. The
adrenaline was surging through me. I was not afraid. It was the voices
of those parents, teachers, &quot;common sense&quot; that were afraid.
I knew I had to exorcise those voices. I apologized to the snake as I turned
to pick up a rock. </p>

<p>I aimed for the head, trying not to injure the body skin. My aim was
poor, and I soon had trapped the snake under two large broken pieces of
concrete. It tried to escape, struck feebly at the stick I held to its
throat, then died as I broke its spine with a crushing thrust. It writhed
for a long time after that. </p>

<p>People crowded around me as I walked back into the rest area. &quot;Is
it alive?&quot; &quot;What is it?&quot; &quot;Are you gonna eat it?&quot;
I nodded at that one. The Mexican man nodded knowingly, and told me about
a market where he used to buy snake carcasses &quot;this big around,&quot;
showing me his wrist. </p>

<p>The CalTrans worker who was cleaning the bathrooms scrounged me a piece
of wire and loaned me a knife. He warned me not to nick myself on the fangs,
and to throw the head down a gopher hole so that nobody could accidentally
poison themselves. I strung the snake up by its neck, cut the skin all
the way around, and stripped it off like a sock. I had trouble with the
rattle - it came off separately. I then cut off the head and cleaned the
meat under a faucet. The guts and head followed me back over the barbed
wire in search of a gopher hole. </p>

<p>I called Richard, my host in Modesto that night, and told him that I
was bringing dinner. When I arrived at his apartment with the snake in
a bag of ice scrounged from the rest area catering truck, he was nonplused.
However, he was not surprised. Richard had been in all my most interesting
classes at Crossroads, and knew me as a crazy, if shy, eccentric. He had
calmed down, gotten a business degree, and landed a gravy job with Gallo,
but retained enough of his own adventurous spirit that he got the barbeque
fired up, and handed me everything I asked for. A beer - for me, mustard
and spices - for the snake. When it came off the grill, the meat was so
good that I resented having to share the small meal. </p>

<p>My first stop the next day was at the hardware store. A six foot dowel
was not to be had, but I found that a piece of 3/4&quot; ID PVC pipe snugly
joined two four footers together. Hose clamps held on the guides that I
made from coat hangers stolen from Rich's closet. 1/8&quot; braided wire
cable completed my snake noose. I returned to the rest area, and spent
the rest of the day snake hunting. Despite my best intentions, and the
experience of the CalTrans worker, I had no luck at all. I continued to
hunt snakes at every rest area south of Modesto, but saw nothing more than
one shed skin while hiking down a dry waterfall at Tejon Pass, high above
Los Angeles. </p>

<center><p>* * * * * </p></center>

<p>It feels like terror, this running, born of insecurity, homesickness,
need to get back to a safeness. Seeing my fear, the demons have descended
upon me. Here I am at least not alone. There are many of us here, huddled
in our cars that are rocking in the powerful and bitterly cold wind. I
am hoping that the car does not freeze up while I sleep. </p>

<p>This blizzard began somewhere past Cheyenne, at about 5 AM - a very
fine snow at first noticeable only as it swirled on the road. Soon it came
in sheer veils, obscuring my vision not through opacity, as in a whiteout,
but through distraction, pulling my eyes to their brightness in my headlights.
I was glad to see the rest area - finally - someplace to shelter until
dawn when there would at least be light for me to continue my headlong
dash home. I huddle into the back, fully clothed in my sleeping bag, with
hat, mittens, two pair of socks. </p>

<p>A truck has arrived, idling next to me. Only the wind keeps the diesel
exhaust from seeping into my mobile bedroom as it has in countless rest
areas over the past months. The irregular beat of the idling engine is
a familiar lullaby, and it helps more than hinders my sleep. </p>

<p>
<hr width="100%" ></p>

<h2><a name="snakflags"></a>Flagstaff </h2>

<p>The weather cooled perceptibly as I headed north from Tucson, gaining
elevation as I passed through Prescott, then steeply down through Jerome
into the Verde Valley. But Flagstaff was the first I saw of winter this
trip. Day was sunny, but nighttime dropped below freezing at an alarming
rate. </p>

<p>My first day in town, I went to Northern Arizona University which, as
the largest employer and a large percentage of the population, rules the
town. One business owner told me that the college president had as much
or more to do with municipal policy and planning than the city council.
</p>

<p>I spoke with Tom S, NAU's guitar instructor, about the possibility of
putting together an accelerated BA program there. He was excited about
the concept, but discouraging about the possibility of such a program at
NAU. He had other ideas for me, gave me names and numbers. </p>

<p>I don't remember who suggested Macy's as a possible pickup gig - possibly
someone I met at the open mic at Charly's my first night in town - but
I liked the place immediately. Light, but not too light. Small, intimate,
but with room for privacy. Nice, simple tables and chairs. Marquetry chessboards
laid into the tabletops. The woman working the counter pointed out the
owner, Tim Macy, playing an intense game of chess towards the front of
the room. Study the board, make a decisive move, slap the timer. Fast.
Perhaps three to five seconds per move. Study, move, slap! </p>

<p>I waited until after the game to ask permission to perform. &quot;Can
you play me something now, as an audition?,&quot; he asked. I got a guitar
out of the car, launched into &quot;Little Flower,&quot; crouching at his
feet. He stopped me after less than ten seconds, like the chess game, laughing.
&quot;OK,&quot; he said, &quot;I just wanted to make sure you could play.&quot;
</p>

<p>After I played, and Macy's closed, it was cold. I wasn't ready to crawl
into the back of the truck, parked across the street in a sprawling, amorphous
parking lot, so I brought a book into the laundromat next door, where it
was warm and open late. A Hispanic couple were waiting for their one last
dryer load, and a pretty, efficient woman swept the floor. </p>

<p>I tried to ignore the man who sat across from me at the long white table,
but he was intent on me. He was probably in his late forties. Navaho, dressed
in the soiled motley of a street person. He held out a two-thirds-empty
bottle of cheap red wine. I declined. &quot;It's not polite to refuse to
share what's offered,&quot; he said.</p>

<p>I took the bottle, figuring the alcohol would kill any germs the rim
might harbor. &quot;I don't want any,&quot; I said, &quot;but just to be
polite, I'll share.&quot; I took a token swallow of sweet, warm wine, almost
like sherry. He smiled. </p>

<p>&quot;I have a riddle. What has four corners, stays in one corner, and
travels all over the United States, day and night?&quot; I shrugged. &quot;Think
about it,&quot; he said. I though about four cornered things. This room.
This table. My book. An envelope. </p>

<p>&quot;An envelope,&quot; I guessed. </p>

<p>&quot;Very close,&quot; he said. &quot;A postage stamp.&quot; He outlined
the form of an envelope, and indicated the upper right-hand corner. &quot;Four
corners, stays in one corner, travels all over the United States, day and
night.&quot; He laughed. </p>

<p>When the laundromat closed, he followed me outside. His name was Fort
Apache. He was born on the reservation in Tuba City. His brother was a
chess champion, his sister a black belt in judo. He had come to Flagstaff
to work, but when the work ran out, he was left to sleep in the street.
He asked where I was sleeping. I indicated my truck. &quot;It's cold. If
I sleep outside tonight, I'll die,&quot; he said, simply. </p>

<p>I was surprised how easily we both fit in my truck, head to foot, I
willing to put up with his unfamiliar and unwashed odor for the sake of
possibly saving his life. He finished his wine, and laid the bottle down,
neck cradled on a paper bag. &quot;Always leave the bottle with its head
to the East, like a person, to breathe. This helps hangover, makes you
healthy. Treat all this way.&quot; He paused. </p>

<p>&quot;Hey. A Navajo came before a judge for drinking. Judge sentenced
him to ten days in jail. The Navaho was proud. He said 'I'll do it standing
on my head.' 'Then I'll give you another ten days to get back on your feet.'
I grunted to acknowledge the joke. Fort told me lots of stories that night:
tall tales of his life on the reservation, and local lore about San Francisco
peak - about the dragon on top that devoured tourists, and that the mountain
got it's name because, from the top, you could look through a telescope
and see &quot;that Golden Gate Bridge.&quot; He kept repeating this phrase
- &quot;That Golden Gate Bridge,&quot; like a punchline.</p>

<p>Flagstaff is a city of many trains. Sometime that night, I heard three
trains blow their horns together in a major chord. </p>

<p>The next morning, Fort asked me for money. &quot;I'll make you a deal,&quot;
I said. &quot;I want to know how to catch rattlesnakes this time of year.
I'll give you money if you can tell me how.&quot; I had been obsessed with
these snakes since Modesto, but had seen none, despite hours of hiking
through amazing desert landscapes: the dry canyon in Cactus City, Ca.,
that must have emptied into the Salton Sea, where the sand held my tracks
so well that the second day I could read the word &quot;Reebok&quot; in
yesterday's print. The blasted heath at Ehrenberg on the Arizona border,
where Saguaros were the only break in the sunburned rocks. The spiny steep
hills west of Quartzite where the wind was strong enough to weather the
rock into cactus shapes, arches, and caves. The hugeness of the wilderness
behind the aqueduct at Salome, where I trespassed on US Government land
to rockclimb a butte littered with quartz roses and crystals. The natural
riprap ridges by Casa Grande where I saw a bobcat moving in the foreground
of a vista that stretched for miles in every direction. The fertile, creviced,
surprisingly soft rich brown earth at Sunset Point. The breathtaking redrock
of &quot;Monkey Face,&quot; where I rockclimbed in Sedona, and the jackrabbit-infested
white rock country of Cottonwood, a few miles away. </p>

<p>&quot;I know how to catch scorpions,&quot; he said. &quot;Go into the
desert and burn some wood to a fine, white ash. Cover your hand with a
thick layer of this ash. Hold your hand out to the scorpion. It will come
onto your hand. When it does, speak your heart to it, ask for its protection.
Then let it go. It will be your protector. When I did this, the scorpion
ran up my arm and stung me here.&quot; he showed me a round scar on his
biceps. &quot;When I showed this to my grandfather, he told me that I would
be very strong, and that I would live to be one hundred and twenty years
old. You can catch rattlesnakes the same way. </p>

<p>To attract the snakes, go into the desert and speak the prayer 'Hey.'
The snake will come to you. When he opens his mouth at you, throw some
ash inside. He will hallucinate and lay still. Then you can pick him up
and speak your heart to him, ask him to be your protector. Then let him
go. He will be your protector.&quot; </p>

<p>I reminded Fort that it was the fall; that the snakes would be in their
dens. He taught me a song: </p>

<ul>
<li>Ya ka sha Shosha </li>

<li>Ho sha na </li>

<ul>
<li>Hey ney ney ney </li>

<li>Ya ka sha </li>

<li>Ho sha na </li>

<li>Hey ney ney ney </li>
</ul>
</ul>

<p>He explained that Shosha was the name of the bear, and that this song
was to draw bear out of hibernation, but that it should work for rattlesnakes
as well. He said that because I was a rookie, I should be prepared to sleep
in the desert for several days, singing the song to the four directions.
</p>

<p>At my request, he told me the name of the rattlesnake - Do'a chi'a ni'i.
He explained that the last two syllables turned quickly, like the rattle
of the snake. </p>

<p>When we left the truck, Fort thanked me and gave me his English name
and address. He was disappointed in the ten dollars I gave him, and tried
to get me to give him more for the riddle of last night. I declined. He
would not let me take his picture. </p>

<p>In Macy's, a shriveled old black man had strings of beads set up on
a table in the window. I spent my money on a string of cobalt blue glass.
I shared a table that morning with Spencer Edgerton, who had seen me perform
the night before. I told him of my rattlesnake obsession, and he showed
me a drawing he had done while I played: a geometric pattern with running
figures and a two-headed snake in the center. The caption read &quot;It's
a snake! Run! It's a Run! Snake! I expressed interest in the design as
a cassette cover, and he gave it to me, writing his name and address on
the back. I wished him luck on his travels, he on mine. </p>

<p>At seven, it is light enough to see - a watery grey light that seems
tangible. I get back onto I-80, along with slowmoving semis, their hazard
lights flashing. The fine snow is still falling. On the road, it is a few
inches deep, but flows around the tires like clouds. It collects on the
windshield. I turn on the wipers. Only the passenger side works. I try
not to panic. I turn on my hazard lights, edge slowly towards the right
shoulder. I can see nothing in front or behind me. </p>

<p>Suddenly, there is something beside me. I watch a dreamlike slowmotion
scene as a semi roars by on my right, off the shoulder, barely missing
me. The truck passes to the right of a roadsign. The driver is trying to
pull back onto the road. The truck begins to jackknife. I can almost swear
I see the hand of God pick the truck up and put it back on the road, an
impossible save from a certain crash, by a driver who must be extremely
skilled or divinely blessed. Then he is gone. </p>

<p>I swear in that moment that if I meet the driver further down the road,
I will offer him my life. When I get out of the car, I am shaking too much
to continue, and I am praying to the God of my childhood to please let
me survive this trip. Despite my paralyzing fear, survival instinct hauls
me out of the truck to repair the wiper and get back onto the road, the
sooner to move on out of this storm, out of the fear of sudden death. </p>

<h2><a name="snakwinon"></a>Winona </h2>

<p>East of Flagstaff on I-40, near Winona, is an amazing landscape of wind-eroded
red rock. Dust from the weathered sandstone covers the earth. To me, it
was like a lunar landscape, my feet making deep prints in the soft dust.
Here I found a cat skull. Like the stereotyped desert steer skull, it lay
by itself, with no sign of the rest of the carcass. It sits on my dashboard
now, sutures and synchondroses still filled with the fine red dust that
dominated that landscape. </p>

<p>North of the highway, this lunar plain stretches to and beyond the railroad
tracks that parallel the highway coast - to - coast. To the South, the
red rock quickly gives way to a yellow sandstone through which snakes a
narrow ravine. </p>

<p>I did not hike far before flushing an owl, which succeeded in its quest
of luring me from its den, I pursuing with my camera to get several pictures
which, when I had them developed, proved beyond a doubt the camoflage ability
of these birds. Later, I found the empty nest, in a natural cavity between
cracked loaves of stone. Beneath this nest, I was surprised to find shells
of marine snails: not fossils, but specimens that were recently alive.
It brought home to me the fact that, yes, this ravine was a living water
channel, only in a temporary phase of dryness.</p>

<p>Heading back to the car, I heard a siren, saw a highway patrol car traveling
ninety or more in the direction I was traveling. Before I had reached the
road, three more had passed. I flashed on Thelma and Louise. About five
miles down the road, traffic came to a complete stop. After ten minutes,
I had turned off the car. After twenty, I and other drivers were standing
in small groups, talking. According to a news flash on the NAU radio station,
state patrol officers were involved in a high-speed chase with an armed
suspect, and the highway would be closed until the highway was secure.
I got my skateboard out of the car. </p>

<p>&quot;Hey,&quot; I said to one of the drivers, &quot;somebody should
drive to the last town and get beer and burgers. Have a barbecue.&quot;
Nobody took me seriously.</p>

<p>I crossed the median to skate on the empty side of the road. One truck
driver rolled his eyes at me, circling his ear with one finger. I smiled,
shrugged, and skated off. </p>

<p>After traffic resumed, I stopped at a small gas station in Winona. The
proprietor told me that the main action had occurred right there. ASP officers
had apparently spiked the roadway to destroy the fleeing suspect's tires.
The suspect had left his disabled vehicle and run to the margin of the
woods, where he exchanged fire with the police before discharging his shotgun
in his own mouth. &quot;I was right there,&quot; said the store owner,
pointing to a spot on the floor behind the counter. &quot;I saw the whole
thing.&quot; Later, a Flagstaff paper filled in missing details. The suspect
had refused to pull over when a state trooper attempted to stop him for
some trivial violation. A chase ensued. When the gunfight ended, state
police found themselves in possession of the man's girlfriend, the disabled
car, and a diary documenting the couple's flight from the law. The diary
referred to the pair as &quot;Bonnie and Clyde,&quot; but as of that time,
nobody had been able to connect the pair to any crime. The girlfriend chose
to exercise her fifth amendment right to silence, so the rest of the story
was still a mystery. </p>

<p>
<hr width="100%" ></p>

<h2><a name="snkalb"></a>Albuquerque </h2>

<p>Against all odds, the restaurant I remember in Albuquerque's Old Town
from sixteen years ago was still a going concern. Then, it was a husband
and wife operation. Four tables just off the kitchen in what I remember
as the owner's house.. After we had ordered, we'd overheard the woman giving
her husband a shopping list for ingredients. He'd rushed out a back door,
returning with the essentials of our meal. Today, La Crepe Michelle is
a huge place - many rooms that are essentially covered courtyards. I took
Rachel there for brunch, and we pored over her Old Town map looking for
the Albuquerque International Rattlesnake Museum. </p>

<p>I had been to the Rio Grande zoo before her arrival, getting to the
reptile house just after feeding time to photograph a red pygmy rattler
halfway into the swallowing of a white mouse. This was a small zoo, but
more interesting than others I'd seen, including the Los Angeles zoo, and
Seattle's Woodland Park. Certainly richer in rattlers than Tucson's desert
museum. </p>

<p>The rattlesnake museum was not a disappointment. With its interpretive
displays, informational books, and its collection of unusual color morphs
of the Western Diamondback, it is an excellent resource for rattler fans.
The man running the front desk was a herpetologist, knowledgeable about
his charges, and even had an information sheet telling me how to revive
and preserve the skin from the snake in Weston, which now sat shriveled
and unrecognizable on my dashboard. </p>

<center><p>* * * * * </p></center>

<p>Almost to Boise, Idaho, there are blue lights in my rearview, just as
I've feared since Denver. Surprisingly, it did not occur to me that the
tailgater might be a highway patrol car trying to read my weathered license
plate. I thought I knew the configuration of fog lights on the front of
patrol cars, but they must use a different model car in this state. I again
have no turn signals, and when I spun off the road late this morning on
the sun-drenched and thawing snowpacked road of Western Wyoming, I lost
one headlight. Now the Idaho trooper is telling me that I'm also missing
tail and brake lights. He lets me get by with my flashlight shining through
a red lens in the rear window so that I can make it to Boise tonight. </p>

<p>Now, my problems are almost comical. I have to stop twice for new flashlight
batteries before I stop, not in Boise, but further on, at the first rest
area across the Oregon border. My original plan was to drive across Oregon
to Portland, then up I-5 to Olympia, retracing the first leg of this trip.
However, an encounter in Utah has changed the plan.</p>

<p>Echo, Utah is small and remote enough that the gas station is expensive
and seldom manned. The sign in the window says &quot;if you want gas -
Echo Cafe&quot; (which is a statement in itself). Going to the cafe - the
only other building on the highway - I found a sign on the door that said
&quot;back in a few minutes.&quot; When the proprietor showed up, he expressed
surprise. &quot;Wasn't gonna come back, but I forgot something,&quot; he
says. &quot;I was shoveling snow off the Post Office steps.&quot; </p>

<p>I told him to fill it with regular, and he asked where I was headed.
I told him Port Townsend. He obviously knew the area, because he thought
for a minute and then asked if that was near Sequim. I said yes, and he
asked how I was getting there. I told him I was going up to Boise, across
to Portland, and up highway 101. &quot;You'd save time if you took highway
, up to Ellensburg, then up over - I think it's called Snoqualmie pass
- on I-90,&quot; he said, staring at nothing in particular. &quot;You must
have lived in Washington,&quot; I said, impressed. &quot;Nope,&quot; he
said. &quot;Used to be a truck driver, then?&quot; I ventured. &quot;Nope,&quot;
he said, &quot;just like to read maps.&quot;</p>

<p>I paid him some obscene amount for the gas, and drove off, shaking my
head. </p>

<p>
<hr width="100%" ></p>

<h2><a name="snkPT"></a>Port Townsend</h2>

<p>It's amazing to me that the further away from home I am, the further
from home &quot;home&quot; begins. Returning from a trip to Seattle, crossing
the Hood Canal bridge into Jefferson County feels like entering my back
yard. From this distance, it happens coming over Snoqualmie Pass, traversing
the watershed between Eastern and Western Washington. Here is familiar
territory. Here are road signs I've seen before. Here, I am within reach
of friends. If the car breaks down now, someone can come to pick me up.
</p>

<p>Soon, I am in rush hour traffic, flowing molasseslike through Issaquah,
then Bellevue, then across Lake Washington into Seattle. My intention was
to stop off and visit Rachel's sister, Margie, in the city before heading
home. However, it is five o'clock, and the light will soon be failing.
My intention is to try to make it home before dark. The trooper in Idaho
cited me for driving without insurance - a $97 dollar fine. In Washington,
the fine is $450 dollars. Driving at night with my disabled electrical
system makes me an easy target for police. Between here and Port Townsend,
I will have to avoid the Washington State Patrol, Seattle Police, Kitsap
County Sheriff, Jefferson County Sheriff, and Port Townsend Police. </p>

<p>On the ferry to Winslow, I set up my tripod and take a final set of
pictures in the light from the setting sun. Me, in my T-shirt from the
rattlesnake museum, with the Space Needle as a backdrop - the requested
picture for the museum's bulletin board. It is chilly, the moist air cutting
through my clothes. Still, it is a joy to stand on the upper deck, feeling
the wind, seeing the familiar banks of Bainbridge island coming closer,
steeling myself for the final leg of the drive. As I get into my car below,
on the auto deck, I check my mileage. 115990. More than eight thousand
miles elapsed since I began this trip. </p>

<p>The bored-looking ferry operator waves me forward, hanging her dirty-blonde
hair to one side, and I drive off into the twilight, one headlight glowing
weakly into the encroaching Puget Sound evening. I try to keep off the
main roads. From Poulsbo, I cut off onto a small side road, barely an alley.
This leads to a larger back road. Then, back on the highway briefly until
I've crossed the bridge. From the head of the bridge, a local-access road
takes me as far as Hadlock. I slide guiltily by the sheriff's office, then
down another backroad that, many turns later, will become my driveway.
</p>

<p>Finally, I come within the Port Townsend City limits. Only a short hop
now, past the thousand realty offices, the redneck tavern, to turn the
corner at the pink stucco funeral home that marks Rachel's street. I pull
up to the house, walk up the steps, knock, and open the door. </p>

<p><a name="21"></a>[21] I recall one of many trips my mother and I made
by train<a href="RT1-41-62.htm#41">[41]</a> to Michigan, where her sister
and parents lived<a href="RT1-41-62.htm#42">[42]</a>. I was perhaps nine
years old, and my hair was pretty long for a nine year old boy in 1972.
She sent me off to the bathroom by myself, waiting behind for me to return.
She reported to me later that a woman had rushed up to her and said frantically
&quot;but that's the men's!.&quot; It must have been on that same trip
that a girl about my age came up to me in the dome lounge and asked me
what my name was. &quot;Nicky,&quot; I replied, because that was what I
was called at the time. This obviously disturbed her, and she ran back
to conference with her friends a few rows back. Timidly, she returned,
and asked &quot;are you a boy or a girl?&quot; </p>

<p><a name="22"></a>[22] I am quite aware that many of these illnesses
were psychosomatic. When I am under stress or have something in my psyche
that is unconscious or repressed, my body still rebels, laying me low.
My first four years in Port Townsend, I spent a lot of time sick. I was
in my early twenties, and not very wise about living in the world. I would
sit during the winter in my unheated house with a high fever, unable to
move around, and too lethargic to make the house warm or cook for myself<a href="RT1-41-62.htm#43">[43</a>].
I would lie on my massage table in the center of the living room and have
bizarre and vivid dreams that often seemed to be quite significant<a href="RT1-41-62.htm#44">[44]</a>.
</p>

<p><a name="23"></a>[23] Perhaps the worst experience I had with a high
fever was when I was 24. I was heading back to Kennewick, in Eastern Washington,
to spend Thanksgiving with my then girlfriend Gabrielle <a href="RT1-41-62.htm#45">[45]</a>
and her family. Gabrielle was already there. I did not then have a car,
so I took a Greyhound bus over nearly-snowbound Snoqualmie pass. I was
feeling a bit sluggish when I left, and when I arrived in Kennewick, I
was definitely ill. I was immediately banished to the basement, to a spare
bed in a nook behind tall bookshelves. Gabrielle's father had just returned
from the hospital after open-heart surgery, and any infection could prove
fatal. I spent the next few days suffering with a temperature that was
sometimes almost 105 degrees. I went to the emergency room and was tested
for strep, but the test came back negative. I had a mild sore throat, but
my primary symptom was temperature. Gabrielle and her mother tortured me
with cold water sponge baths to try to bring down the fever, which was
unresponsive to aspirin or its substitutes (I was alternating aspirin and
Ibuprofen every two hours). During this time, I was extremely emotional,
and would spend hours playing my guitar, singing at the top of my lungs,
tears pouring down my face. This seemed to help my fever. Needless to say,
I was not invited to join the family for Thanksgiving dinner. There is
a subtext to this, which I believe explains the illness as a psychosomatic
reaction. Gabrielle's family was extremely dysfunctional. She was sexually
abused by her father at the age of six, which had not yet been acknowledged.
Her younger brother, Joe, was adopted, and did not fit in with the family.
He was soon to have his first brush with the law, and would be in and out
of juvenile facilities for the entire time that Gabrielle and I were together.
Furthermore, Gabrielle's father was a devout Catholic, and disapproved
of our relationship. Gabrielle had lost her virginity with me, and the
prospect that we might sleep together under his roof was probably too much
for him to bear<a href="RT1-41-62.htm#46">[46]</a>. </p>

<p><a name="24"></a>[24] This was at Morningstar Ranch, in Alcalde, about
halfway between Santa Fe and Taos. I came here in July of 1983, and spent
a month studying bodywork with Cathryn Ellison, who owned the ranch with
her husband, Mac Grimmer<a href="RT1-41-62.htm#47">[47]</a>. Cathryn was
a Rolfer and Chiropractor, but more importantly, a mystic, who worked very
intuitively. We would spend afternoons together at the Plaza in Santa Fe,
watching people walk by, and analyzing their posture. She would have me
observe the way their feet supported or failed to support their ankles,
their ankles their legs, their legs their pelvis, and so on up to the neck
and head. We also talked a great deal about psychology - mine, and that
of the client on the table. This in particular was very helpful to me<a href="RT1-41-62.htm#48">[48]</a>.
</p>

<p><a name="25"></a>[25] Not to be confused with Easton, which is a town
in the Cascades on I-90. Gabrielle and I passed through Easton many times
on our trips to the Tri-Cities<a href="RT1-41-62.htm#49">[49]</a>. It seemed
to be a fairly insignificant place, but I once had a dream that was set
there. Why Easton specifically, I don't know. </p>

<p><a name="26"></a>[26] We later worked out where we were miscommunicating.
She thought that by saying &quot;Eastern Washington, &quot; I meant Washington
DC, which is on the East coast. </p>

<p><a name="27"></a>[27] Though not for the usual reason. I have no problem
with caffeine. I drink Black tea by the potfuls, chocolate liquid and solid,
hot and cold, cola, and even chocolate covered espresso beans on occasion.
However, I never tried coffee (used to hate the smell, and the taste of
coffee-flavored candy), and so never picked up the habit. At this point,
I see coffee as a symbol of American conformity, and I abstain for that
reason. I also associate coffee with cigarettes, which I detest, both because
of their addictive quality, and because of the smell and taste. I once
had five no smoking signs in my entrance hall, and until recently I swore
vehemently that cigarette-tainted lips would never kiss mine<a href="RT1-41-62.htm#50">[50]</a>.
</p>

<p><a name="28"></a>[28] Actually, this is not fair. I love Quik myself,
and used to mix it too-thick with my milk when I was a child, much as I
do with my hot chocolate today. Now, though, I prefer Ghirardelli's, powdered.
</p>

<p><a name="29"></a>[29] I and some friends were given free tickets to
the dress rehearsal of Monty Python's show at the Hollywood Bowl (the same
show that was later made into a film). Before the show, John Cleese was
warming up the audience, and he typified American domestic beers as being
&quot;like making love in a canoe -- fucking close to bad water!&quot;
He's right, of course. In the United States, beer is seen as something
to drink in large quantities. Therefore, there is very little flavor to
interfere with consumption. I, however, prefer beers so heavy that they
are opaque, with such complex flavors that, served at the proper temperature,
they can taste like apricots one moment, yeasty bread the next. In short,
a meal in a bottle. Even as a teenager, my friends and I would buy Heineken
whenever we could<a href="RT1-41-62.htm#51">[51]</a>. If we had to settle
for less, we would make sure to chill it as cold as possible so as not
to notice the watery-urine flavor. </p>

<p><a name="30"></a>[30] Among Rachel and her coffeesnob friends, Boyd's
is the epitome of generic, flavorless-at-best coffee. </p>

<p><a name="31"></a>[31] As a child, I dreamed repeatedly of a man named
Chris, who visited me in a white flying saucer. We would have long conversations,
none of which I remember now. I used to know the registration number of
his spaceship - something very similar to NCC-1701, which is the number
of the USS Enterprise on Star Trek. Chris was, for me, a sort of a savior,
an invisible friend, and a guardian angel.<a href="RT1-41-62.htm#52">[52]</a>
</p>

<p><a name="32"></a>[32] When we had this conversation, I was about fifteen
years old. </p>

<p><a name="33"></a>[33] It was my mother , Janet Dallett, who started
the Tamanawas fund, which existed to train and facilitate a team of paraprofessionals
to work with so-called &quot;schizophrenics&quot; and &quot;multiple-personalities&quot;
outside of a clinical environment. I was a member of this group. A large
part of our work had to do with validating the unconscious contents that
came through during a psychotic break, and helping the patient to deal
with them and go through them, rather than suppressing them with psychotropic
drugs. The first of these cases is described in her paper &quot;When The
Spirits Come Back.&quot;<a href="RT1-41-62.htm#53">[53]</a> This first
experience was extremely powerful and healing for me. I came in towards
the end of the process. The people who had been working with &quot;Sarah&quot;
had developed procedures and protocol, had worked with Sarah and with each
other. I came in cold, filling in for someone who couldn't make their shift.
I took a graveyard shift, with a woman named Melanie. Sarah slept through
most of the night, but early in the morning, she woke, and came out. She
was relatively lucid. We drew a cooperative picture, each of us adding
elements in turn. Somehow, this turned into a birthing ceremony, where
Sarah gave us both new names. There was a very numinous feeling to the
whole experience, as if I were being affected by Sarah's connection to
the collective unconscious. When I left, I felt deeply infatuated with
Melanie. I felt as though this experience had bonded us together. When
I expressed these feelings to her, she couldn't respond to them. She just
thanked me for sharing them, and smiled mysteriously. I struggled with
this infatuation for several months.<a href="RT1-41-62.htm#54">[54]</a>
The experience with Sarah was during the latter part of 1984. In January
of 1985, still in the grip of this obsession, I was preparing to leave
to revisit L.A. I was to spend two months there, visiting friends, playing
music, and honoring the tenth anniversary of my father's death<a href="RT1-41-62.htm#55">[55]</a>.
During the last few weeks of preparation, I had a huge feeling of transition,
as if this trip would change my life forever. I felt as if I might never
return, as if I might change my name and run away somewhere else. I felt
as if I might stop playing music, and take a completely new direction in
life. Whatever it was that was happening felt huge. During this same time,
I had something very strange happen to my sense of hearing. I was listening
to the radio one day, and a song I knew came on, only I didn't recognize
it at first. When I did, I though it must be a different recording, or
a remix. I can't describe what was different. It was as if I was hearing
through different ears. This started to happen more and more. It was as
if I was hearing &quot;faster.&quot; Things were a different speed, a different
texture. I was hearing a different set of overtones than I had before.
New timbres and patterns. One of the big projects I wanted to finish was
a stained glass window called &quot;Sefiroth<a href="RT1-41-62.htm#56">[56]</a>.&quot;
I had been working on it for two years. One night, at about 2 AM, I had
it on the kitchen floor, and was soldering the came joints together. I
had been working for five or more hours nonstop, and intended to finish
that night. I began to fantasize that Melanie was walking through the back
door, sitting on my lap, and nibbling on my ear. Then, in the fantasy,
the fantasy was interrupted by Melanie walking in and doing just that.
This kept happening, becoming more vivid as each layer of fantasy was added.
Suddenly, I realized that it wasn't fantasy - that Melanie was walking
in and sitting on my lap. It was literally true, just not physically true.
I realized that the woman I was in love with was not the real-world Melanie,
but the anima figure named Melanie that was a part of me. I realized that
I had her there, sitting with me - that the powerful fantasy was a real
drama that was taking place in my psyche. I had the woman of my dreams.
The physical woman was only a reflection of my inner fantasy in the outer
world. </p>

<p><a name="34"></a>[34] She encouraged me to write down my dreams from
an early age. When I was very young, I would dictate my dreams to her.
She would type them out. When I got older, she insisted that I write them
out myself (I remember how traumatic it was the first time she refused
to do this for me. For me, it was a nice ritual, a moment of togetherness.
She must have been sick of taking care of me in so many ways, but to me
it was like cutting yet another umbilical cord). I began to keep dream
journals before the age of ten, and at fifteen, obsessed with the typewriter,
I would periodically sit and type up all my dreams, organizing them chronologically
in binders. At twenty, I and my lover would dictate dreams to each other
to type on her word processor. Today, I rarely write down my dreams, hardly
even remember them. </p>

<p><a name="35"></a>[35] My third album, a CD-only release<a href="RT1-41-62.htm#57">[57]</a>.
The title is perhaps best explained by this excerpt from the liner notes:
</p>

<p>&quot;What is a Morningale? The Morningale exists on all continents,
but the migratory habits of this semi-nocturnal finch are such that few
people are aware of its existence. Night-blind, but hating daylight, the
morningale migrates continually westward, following the limen between night
and morning. They nest before dawn and continue shortly before sunrise.
Morningales nest in deserted Laundromats, where they gather stray socks
and linens into a loose pile. They carry this nest with them when they
migrate, but it is generally lost in flight. Most morningales make a thousand
or more such nests in a lifetime. The morningale's only natural enemies
are cats, who have such a fondness for these small birds that they will
follow a migrating flock for hundreds of miles, sometimes crossing oceans
never to return. The bittersweet song of the morningale is the most beautiful
sound in the world.&quot; The intent of this description - the myth of
the morningale - is to give a sense of longing for something that is just
out of reach. Make this my character note. Carve it on my tombstone<a href="RT1-41-62.htm#58">[58]</a>.
</p>

<p><a name="36"></a>[36] I was planning to attend my ten-year high school
reunion in October of 1991 in Los Angeles. Since I would be driving, it
made sense to book gigs for myself down the coast. As I had friends in
Albuquerque and Santa Fe, I decided to extend my tour that far in order
to visit them. I then chose what seemed to be the most direct route back
, and planned my tour around those highways. On the nights I had nothing
booked, I tried to find pick-up gigs - generally for tips and album sales
only, though sometimes for food as well. Here is my general itinerary for

<p><a name="37"></a>[37] I find myself getting hung up on this desire to
present a nicely boxed adventure, with a beginning, a middle, and an end.
However, I am compiling this narrative after the fact, and it is tempting
to let the story flow on. I keep stopping to ask myself &quot;now, is this
how I felt then, or how I decided I felt after the fact?&quot; (The fact
is, I am unable to write fiction. All my attempts to write fiction have
been flawed by my attempts to incorporate the real into the fantasy. Everything
that I have been successful at writing has been at least largely based
on real life, including a series of short stories that were based on dreams.
Everything I have written, therefore, is either autobiographical, documentary,
or pedagogic - in short, nonfiction)<a href="RT1-41-62.htm#59">[59]</a>.
</p>

<p><a name="38"></a>[38] Latin for &quot;eternal child.&quot; Many men
are plagued with this problem, also referred to as &quot;Peter Pan Syndrome,&quot;
where they are frightened, or not willing, to grow up. I confess, my natural
inclination is to play. I form easy friendships with teenagers who my adult
friends can't stand (Rachel believes that everyone should be locked in
a closet at age twelve, and not let out until they turn twenty-five). I
still, at age thirty, ride a skateboard. My mother the psychoanalyst warns
me of the archetype she calls &quot;the death of the young God,&quot; typified
by the lives of Christ (who died at age thirty-four), and Mozart (who died
at about the same age.)<a href="RT1-41-62.htm#60">[60]</a> I myself always
&quot;knew&quot; that I would die when I was thirty-five, a frightening
concept now. I revised this idea while I was in analysis with Paco Mitchell.
This trip is part of that problem. I have quit my job and taken a break
from my relationship to pursue the fantasy of making a living in the music
world, when the reality is that to make that living I would have to do
what I refuse to do - play music that is &quot;commercial,&quot; that fits
into a recognizable, and therefore marketable, genre<a href="RT1-41-62.htm#61">[61]</a>.
</p>

<p><a name="39"></a>[39] My primary memory of the divorce was my father
rolling up, and leaving with, the living room rug. It was a large blue
rug that covered the living room floor. It was thin, but still somehow
plush, and it held many memories for me. I used to lie on that rug at the
age of three, drinking water out of a baby bottle (I think the only reason
I stopped drinking out of the baby bottle was that I would leave the bottles
on the floor, where the cat would get them. My mother finally gave up and
refused to buy any more replacements for the chewed-up nipples. So, I had
to go cold-turkey on my water habit, and learn to use a glass.) </p>

<p><a name="40"></a>[40] I have had a fear of needles since I was very
young. I'm not sure what brought this on, but it persists today<a href="RT1-41-62.htm#62">[62]</a>.
Working as a butcher, handling knives, even getting cut with knives, doesn't
bother me<a href="RT1-41-62.htm#63">[63]</a>, but come at me with a hypodermic
needle, and I begin to whimper and cringe. </p>

<p><a name="41"></a>[41] My mother and I made quite a few trips back and
forth to Michigan, and one up the coast, while I was young. We always got
a roomette, which made the trip entirely pleasurable. I always took the
upper bunk, and would be lulled to sleep by the rhythmic patter of the
wheels over the joins in the sections of rail (through the high plains,
the beat is slower because, although the train is moving faster, there
are fewer joins - the rails run so straight for so far, that special sections
of rail are used that are a quarter mile long. I learned to clock the train's
speed over this terrain by counting seconds between sections of rail).
I always spent lots of time in the dome car, watching the scenery go by.
I knew when it would begin to get interesting - the desert landscapes in
Eastern Arizona, the climb up the pass crossing into Utah (As I recall,
we crossed the state line just after we came out of a tunnel, just as the
rail started to slope down instead of up. There is a large sign to the
left of the track saying &quot;leaving Arizona,&quot; and another just
a bit later saying &quot;Welcome to Utah.&quot;). I would watch the schedule,
twiddling my thumbs through Needles, Barstow, and Kingman, waiting for
the scenery to begin - some of the same scenery that I was able to get
out and touch on this trip. In the dome car, my mother and I would split
cans of Seven-Up in plastic glasses with ice, and I, even at that tender,
prepubescent age, would fall in love from afar with beautiful women who
came up to see the view. </p>

<p><a name="42"></a>[42] There were two trips I made to Aunt Pat and Uncle
Snap's house on my own. It was during the time that my Mother was working
on her Ph.D. thesis. Each time, I spent the entire summer with them. Snap
was a jobber's man for Hastings Manufacturing, and he traveled all over
the state maintaining contacts for the sale of piston rings. Often, I went
on trips with him. Usually, we were home the same day, but a few times,
we stayed overnight, like the trip we made to Petoskey (famous for its
unique fossil deposits) and Traverse City (cherry pie capital of the world).
Sharing a motel room with Snap was not pleasant, as he smelled bad and
snored loud, but on the whole, the trips were pleasant, and I got to see
a lot of Michigan. </p>

<p><a name="43"></a>[43] My friend Bob Reeves and his girlfriend came over
once while I was in this condition, and were appalled. We sat around and
drank Southern Comfort, which the girlfriend, a faithful North Carolinian,
supplied, and they made me build a fire, which I did gladly, not because
I was cold (which I was), but because they were. I was extremely poor at
the time, and saved my firewood for company<a href="RT1-63-71.htm#64">[64]</a>.
</p>

<p><a name="44"></a>[44] I remember one fever dream which was very brief
- really just an image, not a full dream - but which carried a whole story
along with it. It had to do with two casseroles. One was in a round pan,
the other in a square pan. The round pan was that of the Mother, and had
to be cut with lines that all passed through the center. The square pan
was of the Father, and had to be cut with lines that were parallel or perpendicular
to each other. The message was that I had always cut my casserole in the
manner of the Mother, and that I must begin to do it in the manner of the
Father. In reality, I had been raised by my mother, and I was always very
close to her. My father was not very present in my psyche, although there
were parts of my psyche that have been deeply touched by him. Soon after
his death, I dreamed that I was swimming far out in a bay. I saw some whales,
and I spoke with them. Then I dove into the water. I swam very hard, and
was able to swim through the walls of my Father's house. Looking around,
Inoticed that the house was not so much designed for practicality as for
esthetics. The house was a piece of art for living in. My own house today
is in many ways an echo of that dream house. </p>

<p><a name="45"></a>[45] Gabrielle Conatore, an artist and writer who I
met in 1985 when she was rooming with a neighbor. I had been single, and
celibate, for a year and a half, when we met, and had been &quot;in the
market&quot; for a girlfriend. Gabrielle was in Port Townsend doing an
internship for the Wooden Boat Foundation for her degree at the University
of Washington. My neighbor, a former lover, mentioned that she had a cute
college student staying with her. I was at that time doing my laundry at
her house, so the next time I had a load to do, I called and warned the
new roomie that I was coming over. That night, after sleeping together
(but not having sex. She was a 22-year old virgin and was &quot;saving
it for marriage.&quot;), she said that she hadn't understood why I'd said
that I was calling to &quot;warn&quot; her that I was coming over, but
that now she knew. </p>

<p><a name="46"></a>[46] When we finally moved all of her things out of
that house and over to mine, we did make love there. Weeks later, we got
a very confused sounding three-page letter from him, saying things like
&quot;I hope God will forgive you,&quot; and &quot;you broke the rules
of my house.&quot; Rules that were, as Gabrielle was quick to point out,
unwritten and unsaid. </p>

<p><a name="47"></a>[47] Rachel and I stopped off at the ranch - long since
sold - on our way up to Taos when she came to have Thanksgiving with me.
The ranch is now the American Studies Foundation, a center for the study
of Native American traditions. As we walked around, everything was familiar
to me except the office. It looked as if the office had been enlarged -
one whole wing of it was completely unfamiliar. Then, it suddenly dawned
on me that I had helped to build that wing during my stay on the ranch.
However, when I left it, it was just a set of half-finished adobe walls.
</p>

<p><a name="48"></a>[48] I was working at the time to resolve a problematic
relationship with James, a high-school friend. James idolized me, to the
point where it was impossible to relate to him. Everything would end up
coming back to me. No matter how many times I told him that he must stand
on his own two feet, to think for himself, he would always put the responsibility
for his life in my hands. On the ranch, I had a kinesthetic vision - a
feeling that seemed to be centered in the base of my skull. When I moved
my head, I felt something like a lump of clay shifting positions, falling
against the dura mater on one side, then the other as I shifted my head
back. As I made associations to this sensation, an image came to me of
James' head in miniature, positioned there in the base of my skull. Cathryn
was very concerned. She told me that this portion of the brain controlled
the autonomic systems - breathing, heartbeat, and so forth. The thought
that James - who had a history of suicide attempts - was controlling those
functions was terrifying. Several times during the next few days, breathing
became difficult. I had to think to breathe. Going to sleep at night was
an act of trust. </p>

<p>I wrote James a letter. I told him that I could no longer play this
role in his life. I asked him to refrain from making any contact with me.
When I had sent the letter, I began work on a new piano sonata - a funeral
sonata for James. For me, he no longer existed. Since his life had depended
on me for so long, withdrawing my friendship essentially ended his life.
It was two years before I had any contact with him again. </p>

<p><a name="49"></a>[49] Richland, Kennewick, and Pasco, three cities at
the intersection of the Snake and Columbia rivers in Eastern Washington.
Gabrielle's parents lived in Kennewick. Her father was an engineer for
the Hanford nuclear power plant in Richland, which produces Plutonium for
the construction of nuclear weapons<a href="RT1-63-71.htm#65">[65]</a>.
Gabrielle's friends were mostly SCA members<a href="RT1-63-71.htm#66">[66]</a>.
She took me to an event once - a &quot;tavern night.&quot; I took on the
persona of a nameless, silent, turbaned sheik. We didn't stay long. </p>

<p>Once, Gabrielle took me to the Hanford atomic energy museum. I bought
three marbles from a vending machine in the lobby. The marbles had started
as clear glass, but had turned brown after being bombarded with gamma rays
inside the N-reactor. &quot;These marbles are not radioactive and are perfectly
safe to handle,&quot; said the envelopes that were supplied to keep the
marbles in. &quot;The color will slightly fade when exposed to light or
heat as displaced electrons return to their original places.&quot; </p>

<p><a name="50"></a>[50] My other best friend in high school was named
Larry. Larry was a gifted drummer and singer. He and James and I were in
a band together called &quot;Free Toe Beach,&quot; and the three of us
were constant companions. Rather, I split my time between Larry and James.
They were very different people, and I often felt as if I was the only
reason the band stayed together. It was sometimes as if I were between
them, holding onto each of them with one hand, trying to hold them in place
as magnetic repulsion thrust them apart. </p>

<p>Whereas James' hangup was Nick As Savior, Larry was prone to other addictions.
By the time I had known him for six months, I had determined to break Larry
of his smoking habit, which I considered disgusting, not primarily because
of the smell and irritation from the smoke, but because of the addiction
- Larry was completely enslaved to his habit. Larry gave me his permission
to remove cigarettes from his room when I found them. When he broke down
and had a cigarette, I would leave - deprive him of my friendship<a href="RT1-63-71.htm#67">[67]</a>.
One night, Larry followed me at a distance with a lit cigarette, I walking
as fast as possible to get away. Eventually, he claimed to have quit, but
I discovered that he was smoking behind my back. Finally, I gave up trying.
</p>

<p>Senior year, I loaned Larry a thousand dollars to help buy a PA system
for his new band. After I left Los Angeles, I stopped getting payments.
Determined to treat the loan as a business deal, I mailed him threatening
letters, and finally began calling collection agencies. Thankfully, I heard
from Larry before I had a chance to send the contract to the agency I had
selected. He mailed me a payment, and an apology. He had turned himself
in for treatment for cocaine addiction, which had been sucking up every
available dollar of his income. </p>

<p>Having kicked the cocaine habit, Larry turned to philosophy, affiliating
himself first with Jews for Jesus (who required him to proselytize on street
corners in Westwood on Friday nights), then with an assortment of spiritualist
and self-help gurus (including Werner Ehrhard). When that lost its power,
he took up with a string of women, all of whom were the one and only, and
all of whom he intended to marry as soon as feasible. He finally managed
to complete his marriage plans, with Ann, a woman who was separated from
her last husband when she and Larry began dating. Ann lived in fear of
the ex-husband, so much so that she refused to come to Larry's house, for
fear that he might follow her there and shoot Larry. After the last relationship
had ended with Larry's intended attacking him with a knife, Larry had asked
me to let him know when I thought he was going astray. When I expressed
doubts about his marriage plans with Ann, however, he became irate. He
accused me of not taking marriage seriously, of not taking him seriously<a href="RT1-63-71.htm#68">[68]</a>.
He stopped calling me or answering my messages after that. When I left
on this tour, I had not heard from Larry for over a year. </p>

<p><a name="51"></a>[51] Beer was pretty easy to get for teenagers in Los
Angeles. We could usually find someplace that would sell to James, who
looked older than seventeen. When that failed, we would &quot;spot&quot;
beer. This entailed waiting outside of the 7-11, scoping out cool-looking
adults who might buy for us. One evening, as Larry and I sat in the car
watching James loitering near the door, we saw him pass money to a pretty
woman in her twenties. She came out a minute later, handed James a beer,
and locked her mouth on his. We weren't sure he was coming back after that.
&quot;Why didn't you invite her to come with us?,&quot; we moaned when
he got back in the car, grinning. &quot;You're just sore losers,&quot;
he replied. &quot;Drive on.&quot;<a href="RT1-63-71.htm#69">[69] </a></p>

<p><a name="52"></a>[52] I saw an angel, once. As a child, I was afraid
of the dark, and was also very earnestly confused about my religious identity.
I believed in God, but my faith was shaky. One of my greatest fears was
that God would give me a sign that I was called into his service. I knew
that if this happened, I would have to put my own life aside and follow
him. To refuse to do so would be death. Once, I looked up from my bed in
the dark, at a corner where there was always a pool of light from a window.
For a moment, I saw a figure standing there, composed of light, and larger
than a man. I threw the bedclothes over myself in terror, and lay there
trembling for a long time, praying to God that I was not being called to
service. After many minutes, I looked out and saw only the usual pool of
light. After that, I closed my eyes and tried very hard to sleep. </p>

Books, Toronto. </p>

<p><a name="54"></a>[54] I have had a pattern of rabid infatuations since
the age of nine, when I had a dream about a beautiful dark-haired girl
who was named &quot;Love.&quot; The following week, she appeared at school<a href="RT1-63-71.htm#70">[70]</a>.
I had never seen her before, except for in my dream. I recognized her instantly.
Her name in real life was Kathy, and I pursued her relentlessly. We became
friends, but she never responded to my clumsy romantic advances. Years
later, I understood that the girl in the dream was an Anima figure - a
reflection of the feminine side of myself. My attraction was a projection
of that figure onto Kathy. It was not until my infatuation with Melanie
that I was able to see these projections at all objectively, to step back
and separate the real woman from the fantasy. It is also clear to me that
the feelings that I &quot;suffer&quot; from during these episodes is what
is referred to as &quot;limerence&quot; - an emotion that sends me into
an altered state of fixation on the love object without sexual feelings,
a sort of chivalric love that for me becomes an intense creative focus.
</p>

<p><a name="55"></a>[55] My father, Kent Dallett, committed suicide on
Feb. 21st, 1975, one day after his forty-fourth birthday. An intensely
creative man, he worked at UCLA teaching behavioral psychology, painting
and making music in his spare time. I knew him little after the divorce,
only seeing him on Sundays, when he and I would go to the beach, or to
Will Rogers State Park to hike in the hills or hunt for polo balls in the
ravine below the polo field. I know that, like me, his creative life was
extremely important to him, but that in him the drive was only partially
expressed. I also know that, like me, he had an eye for women, and a sex
drive that expressed itself in unusual ways (I thought it was cool that
he had handcuffs when I visited him on the weekends, but it was not until
I was much older that I understood why he had them). </p>

<p><a name="56"></a>[56] The design is based on the tree of ten Sefira
from the Kabbalah. The window, my second, used a method that I wanted to
experiment with using copper foil to build glass scraps into mosaics, which
I joined together using lead came. For the Sefira, the ten stages in the
tree, I used recycled glass bottle bottoms. Four of these - numbers two,
three, seven, and eight, were brown glass bottoms from Rainier beer bottles.
These bottles have numbers stamped on the bottom, so my plan was to use
bottoms that had the numbers of the sefira on them. Two, three, and seven
were easily found, but I searched in vain for a year and a half for the
number eight. I went so far as to call the Rainier bottling plant in Seattle,
where I was referred to the bottlemaker. The bottlemaker told me that the
numbers indicated the mold that had been used to cast the bottle. Number
eight, he told me, had probably cracked and had been destroyed. My final
solution was to use mold number seventeen, which is a numerological &quot;octave&quot;
of eight (anequivalent, obtained by summing the numbers one and seven.
twenty-six, thirty-five, forty-four, and so forth are also equivalent to
8). </p>

<p><a name="58"></a>[58] I often feel as if I am reaching for something
that is just beyond me - an ideal, which becomes progressively more lofty
the closer I approach. This is especially true of music. I have always
written music that is more difficult than I am able to perform. The process
of learning to play the music raises my level of technique, which makes
me have to write music that is even harder. I am always reaching higher
and further in everything I do, thinking of each goal as something to move
towards, rather than as something I must reach immediately. </p>

<p><a name="59"></a>[59] I got the idea to write an autobiographical novel
in footnotes from an improbable periodical called the &quot;Journal of
Irreproducible Results,&quot; a pseudo-scientific magazine whose contributors
are genuine scientific researchers, although the research contributed to
this particular journal is less than professional. One article was written
entirely in footnotes. The idea grabbed me, and I used the technique to
expand the lyrics to my song &quot;Grandpa's Naugahyde Womb&quot; for a
family round-robin started by my Aunt Patty. </p>

<p><a name="60"></a>[60] At one point, when I had been in the hospital
with an enteric infection, she wrote me a letter warning me that my life
was in danger. The letter had a strangely righteous tone, and I got a strong
sense that it was not about me. Rachel lived at the time with a woman who
was one of my mother's patients, and she reported to me that her roommate
had received a very similar letter. About the same time, my mother began
to call me to discuss the provisions of her will. It became clear that
the letter was a projection of a growing obsession with her own death,
rather than an accurate perception of my psychological condition. </p>

<p><a name="61"></a>[61] What I do is make music that I enjoy. I have been
criticised for making albums that are too eclectic - The Migration of Morningales
ranges from solo classical guitar to full jazz fusion band (&quot;This
is a diverse album - too diverse for focus&quot; - Chris Lunn, Victory
Music Review) - but this is exactly what I enjoy in other albums. Typically,
my selection tapes will cover a similar range. New Age harpist David Michael
and I have had an ongoing dialogue about music marketing. He, like me,
enjoys diversity in music, yet the music he records and releases is squarely
in the New Age genre. He often encourages me to record a more marketable
product - one that is homogeneous, that can be easily categorized. His
records sell consistently, have been picked up by several distributors
here and abroad. My discs, on the other hand, sit unsold on the shelf.
While I have considered taking his advice, I thus far would rather produce
what I want to hear, rather than something that would be profitable but
less aesthetic to my ear. </p>

<p><a name="62"></a>[62] One of my mother's best friends had two daughters
who used to babysit me. Since my mother and her friend liked to go out
together, I often was at her house with one or the other of the daughters.
That house seemed to be cursed for me. Once, when I was spending the night
there, my sitter burst into the bedroom. &quot;The house is on fire,&quot;
she yelled, &quot;we have to get out!&quot; Smoke poured in from the living
room. We ran outside, and waited for the firetruck. She or a friend had
been smoking on the sofa, and had left a burning cigarette unattended.
On another occasion, I was running through the house, which was carpeted
in a thick shag pile. I ran full-tilt through the sewing room, and managed
to find a needle that had hidden itself in the carpet. The needle drove
itself into my foot, and snapped off. At the emergency room, I had to endure
a second needle in my already traumatized sole as a doctor cut my foot
open to remove the needle. A tetanus shot completed the ordeal. This may
have been the genesis of my phobia. </p>

<p><a name="63"></a>[63] I remember being in the backyard with a hunting
knife that my father had given me. I had just sharpened it, and the blade
was still wet with three-in-one oil. I ran the blade across my finger to
see how sharp it was, and was pleased to see a red line of blood on my
finger. I hardly felt the knife cut, and the idea of being cut didn't bother
me at all. </p>

<p><a name="64"></a>[64] I still live a rather spartan life, and often
save luxuries for visitors. I am glad when I am having company, for it
is often the only time that I clean the house. </p>

<p><a name="65"></a>[65] Gabrielle and I were both very liberal and very
much pacifists. It must have been difficult for her to deal with her father's
work. It was something she didn't discuss much, and certainly not with
her father. </p>

<p><a name="66"></a>[66] Society for Creative Anachronisms. Members assume
personas, or alternate identities, which belong to a different time period.
They create clothes and histories for these personas, and become these
people for each group event. Many SCA'ers are normal, well-adjusted people
who simply need a creative outlet, but others use the society as an escape
from reality, falling so far into their personae that they never come out
of character, naming their children medieval names, and bringing them up
far removed from the modern world. </p>

<p><a name="67"></a>[67] Larry's and my friendship was extremely powerful.
When we were first friends, we saw each other at school but not outside.
Larry used to beg me to come over to his house after school. I was at the
time used to being alone, and going to friend's houses was not something
I was used to doing. I made excuses. Finally, Larry broke down and cried
at school one day because he couldn't understand why I wouldn't come over.
I was shocked at the depth of his feeling, and soon thereafter began to
spend time with him after school. So, using my absence as negative feedback
for controlling Larry's nicotine habit proved extremely effective. </p>

<p><a name="68"></a>[68] On a previous trip to L.A., I spent the whole
trip down fantasizing about having casual sex with someone young and beautiful.
I had been with Rachel for about a year, and loved her very much, but these
feelings hit me like an obsession as soon as I was on the road. When I
arrived in L.A., I asked Larry if he knew anybody he could fix me up with.
He had just begun to date Ann. He said no, he couldn't think of anybody.
That same evening, Ann came over (after she and Larry had met elsewhere,
and walked around until they were sure she hadn't been followed) with a
friend. The friend and I hit it off immediately, and I was soon sitting
on the floor giving her a foot massage. The next day, I took her out, and
we consummated the attraction. I told her about Rachel, and that I could
only be with her for the week I was in L.A. She accepted this, and we dated
for the week. When I left, I felt extremely guilty, not only for Rachel,
but also for my new friend, for whom I had genuine affection. I was breaking
Rachel's heart, and Ann's friend's trust. Larry couldn't understand the
whole affair. His parents were happily married, and he had never known
anything but monogamy. It was ingrained in his psyche. It upset him that
I could cheat on Rachel, and especially so because he had to watch a friend's
heart get broken as well. As for my feelings about marriage, I have always
taken the marriage institution very seriously. I would never marry anybody
that I wasn't sure I could stay with forever<a href="RT1-63-71.htm#71">[71]</a>.
I require so much variety in my life that I have never met a woman who
could be everything I needed her to be. A friend once told me that he never
woud have gotten married if he hadn't known he could get divorced if it
didn't work out. I couldn't go into something so serious with that sort
of attitude. </p>

<p><a name="69"></a>[69] James was tall, dark-haired, blue-eyed, and surprisingly
attractive to women. Larry and I suffered in loneliness all through school
(I didn't lose my virginity until I was twenty), watching James attracting
women left and right. James and I had a strange relationship around women.
The one girl I ever brought to a school dance fell for him instantly, and
I suffered through the two of them making love in my room while Ilay in
the loft trying to sleep. When James came to Port Townsend to visit me
in 1987, Gabrielle fell for him, and I had to watch her like a hawk to
keep her from seducing him. James' most serious relationship, however,
was with a girl named Stacy that he met at a cousin's wedding. James spoke
of me to her so often and so highly that she began to write to me from
college in Berkeley. I eventually fell in love with her, and while we never
consummated the relationship, she became one of the closest friends I've
ever had. </p>

<p><a name="70"></a>[70] While I have had strong intuitive perceptions
for most of my life, I have never before or since had a dream like this,
that foretold the future so accurately and in such a literal way. </p>

<p><a name="71"></a>[71] I realize the impossibility of knowing this for
certain, and I have always said that I could marry a woman with whom I
had lived with successfully for one year. Gabrielle and I lived together
off and on for three years, but never managed more than six consecutive
months together in the same house. </p>

<p><a name="8"></a>[8] At one point, I went to look for the bathroom, assuming
there would be one in the cafe. I found the women's room, but could not
find the men's<a href="RT1-21-40.htm#21">[21]</a> . When I asked, I was
directed to the back of the bookstore. It occurred to me that this was
a strange place for a public bathroom. </p>

<p><a name="9"></a>[9] Like Stephen, I was sick often growing up<a href="RT1-21-40.htm#22">[22]</a>.
Most often, it seems to have been strep throat, but I also remember many
ear infections. Much of the time I spent with a high fever<a href="RT1-21-40.htm#23">[23]</a>,
which gave me ample time for daydreaming and reverie. </p>

<p><a name="10"></a>[10] One of the most inane and frustrating arguments
I ever had was with a man and a woman from Spokane. We were in New Mexico
at the time<a href="RT1-21-40.htm#24">[24]</a>, and so we were all Washingtonians
out of context. I made an offhand comment that I was from Western Washington.
The woman said that, oh yes, they were from Western Washington too. I said
no, Spokane is in Eastern<a href="RT1-21-40.htm#25">[25]</a> Washington.
She kept contradicting me. It was a very frustrating experience. Spokane
is on the east side of the Cascade mountains, on the eastern border of
the state. Port Townsend is near the western border, on the Olympic Peninsula.
I knew I was right. I just couldn't convince her of it<a href="RT1-21-40.htm#26">[26].</a>
</p>

<p><a name="11"></a>[11] I don't drink coffee myself<a href="RT1-21-40.htm#27">[27]</a>.
Instead, I drink hot chocolate, and have become as much a connoisseur of
chocolate as most Seattleites are of coffee. So, I was incensed to see
the woman at Penny Lane pumping Hershey's syrup into my glass. This is
lowest common denominator chocolate - worse than Quik in my estimation<a href="RT1-21-40.htm#28">[28]</a>
- like Budweiser beer<a href="RT1-21-40.htm#29">[29]</a>, or Boyd's coffee<a href="RT1-21-40.htm#30">[30]</a>.
</p>

<p><a name="12"></a>[12] I had another inane argument once, with my mother.
This was about whether flying saucers were merely a symbol of the Self
(as Jung proposes), or whether they literally existed. My argument was
that they obviously really existed, because they were there in dreams<a href="RT1-21-40.htm#31">[31]</a>.
I saw things in dreams as real objects. Granted, they exist only in dreams,
but they are real nonetheless. She contested the reality of dream contents,
trying to get me to recognize the difference between the reality of dreams,
which was a symbolic reality, and the reality of outer-world life, which
is a concrete reality. I countered that symbols were concrete, integral
things, and that their physical intangibility did not make them less real<a href="RT1-21-40.htm#32">[32]</a>.
We never did come to an agreement on this<a href="RT1-21-40.htm#33">[33]</a>.
</p>

<p><a name="13"></a>[13] I am indebted to my mother for this ability to
get deep into a dream by examining the taken-for-granted. Whenever I took
a dream to her as a child, I would tell her proudly what I thought the
images in the dream had to do with. She would invariably pick out a detail
that had not figured in my analysis. &quot;What do you suppose the doughnut
means,&quot; she would say, and I would slog back to my room, musing<a href="RT1-21-40.htm#34">[34]</a>.
</p>

<p><a name="14"></a>[14] Same-sex others in dreams are aspects of the shadow,
parts of the psyche that we do not consciously acknowledge. So, if I dream
of somebody I dislike, for example, I am dreaming of a part of myself that
may be like that person. Hence the dislike, which is a sort of denial of
that part of my psyche. </p>

<p><a name="15"></a>[15] I had been working at Tom's Meat and Seafood Market
in Port Townsend for four years, and decided to quit to play music full
time. I spent the summer finishing up &quot;The Migration of Morningales<a href="RT1-21-40.htm#35">[35]</a>,&quot;
and booking a tour through the southwest<a href="RT1-21-40.htm#36">[36]</a>
to promote myself and the album. </p>

<p><a name="16"></a>[16] This narrative combines elements of both trips,
but is basically predicated on the timeline of the first loop. I have tried
to keep this book within the timeframe of my life up until that tour, but
a life is a fluid thing without tidy ends<a href="RT1-21-40.htm#37">[37]</a>.
</p>

<p><a name="17"></a>[17] I myself have always been reluctant to grow up
- a puer aeternus <a href="RT1-21-40.htm#38">[38]</a>- so perhaps this
has to do with the subtext of this trip, my evaluation of my life. </p>

<p><a name="18"></a>[18] As a young child, I sat in on my Mother's annual
dream seminar several times. The first night of this seminar, always held
in our home in Brentwood, always began with her lecture entitled &quot;a
dream is like a piece of Baklava.&quot; The metaphor has several aspects.
First, a dream, like the pastry, has many layers which are closely related,
but discrete. Second, when one bites into the baklava, one's teeth initially
meet with resistance upon encountering each new layer, but once inside
find sweet honey. This narrative, like an onion, is layered -hierarchies
of footnotes. My mind works this way, each thought leading in many directions.
It's difficult for me to have a conversation because of this. I'm forever
interrupting myself to give background on the story. </p>

<p><a name="19"></a>[19] One sandwich was so typical of him, at least in
my memory, that I still call it, a &quot;dad sandwich.&quot; It combined
salami, cheese, and peanut butter, and I remember it as having also mayonnaise
and onions at times. This was when he and my mother were still married,
so it had to have been before I was six<a href="RT1-21-40.htm#39">[39]</a>.
</p>

<p><a name="20"></a>[20] One association I have with this dream rake is
unpleasant. The actual experience was with a hoe. I was perhaps nine years
old, and I was hoeing the front garden of our house in L.A.. I was barefoot,
and one swing of the hoe went wild, splitting one big toenail in half.
I remember going into the bathroom, putting the toe in the bathtub, and
running the water. The blood was copious, and the water quickly became
stained a bright red. I was astounded by the amount of blood that issued
from the wound. My mother then drove me to the emergency room, where I
remember getting a tetanus shot<a href="RT1-21-40.htm#40">[40]</a>. Other
than this, my experiences with the big rake, which we called a &quot;dirt
rake&quot; were pleasant. I used to play with it a lot, moving soil and
detritus around in the back yard, and making patterns of parallel lines
in the dirt. </p>

<h1>ONE </h1>

<p><b>Some Dreams </b></p>

<center><p><i>&quot;[The soul] has a slow and dark birth, more mysterious
than the birth of the body. 
<br>When the soul of a man is born in this country there are nets flung
at it to hold it back from flight. 
<br>You talk to me of nationality, language, religion. I shall try to fly
by those nets.&quot;</i> </p></center>

<center><p><b>-James Joyce,</b> <b><i>A Portrait of the Artist as a Young
Man </i></b></p></center>

<p>&quot;I've got to tell you this dream I had last night. You're going
to scream. It was so obvious. You won't believe this. Get your tea and
come here and I'll tell you. I usually don't understand my dreams, but
this one. . . you're going to howl. Here it is. I went over to my boyfriend's
house and I went in. Interrupted him with his new girlfriend. He jumped
up, all flustered, and trying to explain, and I said - get this - 'relax,
it's okay. I just came over to get my marked copy of <i>Tom Sawyer</i>.&quot;
</p>

<p>The dreamer and her girlfriend giggle loudly, then burst into laughter.
&quot;Isn't that obvious? Can you even believe it?&quot; The other patrons
of this crowded coffeehouse <a href="rt1.HTM#1">[1]</a> take the outburst
in stride, even though many are quietly studying. I'm at a table a few
feet away, probably the only person here who isn't a University of Colorado
student. I'm trying to read <i>A portrait of the artist as a young man</i>.<a href="rt1.HTM#2">[2]</a>
What makes it hard, at this juncture, is not the noise of conversation,
or the periodic hiss of milk being foamed behind the espresso counter <a href="rt1.HTM#3">[3]</a>,
nor is it the cold drafts from the door when it opens to envelop or disgorge
another body to or from Pearl St. outside, just a few yards from my seat.
What makes it hard is this woman's insistence on the transparency of her
dream. </p>

<p>I'm an eavesdropper by nature, and a Jungian <a href="rt1.HTM#4">[4]</a>
by upbringing, and if there's one thing I've learned sitting through years
of my mother's seminars, it's that dreams are always devious. I'm tempted
to abandon Joyce to interrogate this woman. &quot;Excuse me,&quot; I'd
say, &quot;your dream is not as clear to me as it evidently is to you.
Granted, finding your boyfriend in flagrante seems clear, you having apparently
just broken up with him, but what about the book? Why a book, first of
all? Why <i>Tom Sawyer</i> <a href="rt1.HTM#5">[5]</a> in particular, and
why a marked copy, for god's sake?&quot; But you're guilty too, I remind
myself, and chagrined, I have to admit that I made the same mistake, three
months ago, at the beginning of this journey <a href="rt1.HTM#6">[6]</a>.
</p>

<p>In the dream, an old Chinese man took away my part in a play, giving
it to Rachel. Handing me a rake, he sent me out in the field to till onions.
At the time, I too said &quot;what an obvious dream.&quot; </p>

<p>In actuality, I was going away, leaving Rachel to take care of my business.
And instead of my usual role, I was out &quot;in the field,&quot; digging
up gigs, digging up connections, sifting through all the possible roads
and towns and coffeehouses and theaters to find my own niche in a music
scene already cramped with guitar players. Now, I scold myself. Why an
old Chinese man? Why onions? Dreams are never obvious, the less so the
more they seem.<a href="rt1.HTM#7">[7]</a> <a name="notes"></a></p>

<p><a name="1"></a>[1] The Trident Coffeehouse and Bookstore in Boulder,
Colorado. The bookstore and cafe are separate, but accessible to each other
through an open double door<a href="RT1-8-20.htm#8">[8]</a>. </p>

<p><a name="2"></a>[2] By James Joyce. This is an account of the early
life of Stephen Dedalus, a character that appears also in Ulysses. At the
time, I found many parallels between Stephen's experiences and my own<a href="RT1-8-20.htm#9">[9]</a>.

<p><a name="3"></a>[3] Coming from Western Washington <a href="RT1-8-20.htm#10">[10]</a>,

<p><a name="4"></a>[4] Viennese Psychologist Carl Jung was one of the students
of Freud. His psychology takes as one of its axioms that the human psyche
is autonomous, and has its own individual growth process that may conflict
with conscious attitudes. Jung saw dreams as concrete symbols that did
not stand for anything in particular, but that had their own meaning. Basically
put, a dream means what it means, nothing more, nothing less<a href="RT1-8-20.htm#12">[12]</a>.
Every image and action in a dream is precisely what it is for a reason.
If one does not take every detail into consideration, one misses essential
elements of the dream<a href="RT1-8-20.htm#13">[13]</a>. </p>

<p><a name="5"></a>[5] I can make a stab at an interpretation here. Tom
Sawyer is the paradigm of the mischievous young man, and could speak to
the relationship between the dreamer and her boyfriend. Note that, in the
dream, the boyfriend does not necessarily represent himself in reality.
More likely, he is an image of whatever part he played in the life of the
dreamer. I would be curious to inquire about the new girlfriend in the
dream: is this an actual real-world new girlfriend, or someone else that
the dreamer knows, or is it a complete stranger?<a href="RT1-8-20.htm#14">[14]</a>
</p>

<p><a name="6"></a>[6] I left on this tour<a href="RT1-8-20.htm#15">[15]</a>
on September 19th, 1991, and returned on December 9th. I made the same
trip (in reverse order) again in February/March 1992, taking approximately
one month to make the same trip<a href="RT1-8-20.htm#16">[16]</a>. </p>

<p><a name="7"></a>[7] (See footnote 4) The old Chinese man may have to
do with the Senex, the archetype of the wise old man. A fitting figure
to be making me do the dirty work necessary to find myself and my maturity<a href="RT1-8-20.htm#17">[17]</a>.
</p>

<p>Onions, like dreams, like this narrative, have many layers and can be
seen as a symbol for any sort of psychological work<a href="RT1-8-20.htm#18">[18]</a>.
No matter how deep I go into this dream, there is always one more layer
to be peeled away. Onions also remind me of my father, his love for raw
onions in salads and sandwiches<a href="RT1-8-20.htm#19">[19]</a>. Why
am I being handed a rake?<a href="RT1-8-20.htm#20">[20]</a> </p>

<h2>Los Angeles </h2>

<p>I was born in LA, and spent the first 20 years of my life walking, biking,
and skateboarding its streets, but the two weeks I spent there on tour
were like discovering a whole new city. </p>

<p>Musically, LA is replete with opportunities to play, in the form of
open mic nights. While I didn't avail myself of every one, I could have
played every night for at least two weeks, a different venue every night.
When I came to town, I only had one contact, at the Methodist church in
Echo Park, which hosts the Basement Coffeehouse series. This was perhaps
the most casual open mic I've attended, partially due to the sparse attendance.
About seven performers arrived, most of them comics and poets. This was
a new thing to me, being used to open mics that were wall-to-wall music,
but it was an interesting change. </p>

<p>My friend James, someone I grew up with, and who was my host for my
two weeks in LA, told me about the Iguana, a cafe near his house in North
Hollywood. This was a very comfortable place, arranged like a living room,
and while it was oriented more towards music than the Basement Coffeehouse,
there were again poets and comics in the mix. </p>

<p>Performance order for these two shows was by the lottery method. There
was the customary writing down of names on small slips of paper which were
then put into a hat, bag, or can, but instead of the Emcee making up a
list beforehand, the hat or whatever was handed to each performer as they
left the stage, to draw the name of the next artist. This served to keep
all the musicians focused on the stage, rather than milling around backstage,
or outside. </p>

<p>The Iguana provided two of the musical highlights of my trip. One was
a group consisting of guitar, tablas, Chapman stick, and two vocalists,
playing material as interestingly composed as the ensemble. The other was
truly inspiring - a homeless man walked in off the street, and delivered
a riveting song about his life on the street, using a borrowed guitar.
Afterwards, he acted embarrassed, and refused to play a second song, walking
back out into the darkness as we gave him a standing ovation. </p>

<p>Talking with musicians at the Iguana led to me showing up at Mama Pajama
the next night. The venue, a coffeehouse and clothing store on Venice Blvd.,
was unimpressive, but it provided entree into the circle of LA folk musicians.
Key to this was a man named Jim Prior, whose guitar technique was so unusual
that I cajoled him into giving me a lesson the following morning at his
apartment in Culver City. His playing style, which he calls the Wiggle,
is based on a pulse produced by strumming downstrokes with the pick, and
striking the face of the guitar with the third and fourth fingers with
each stroke. He calls this pulse a &quot;kicker,&quot; and credits songwriter
and performer Rod Smear with passing it on to him. The rest of the Wiggle
is accomplished with hammer-on and pull-off techniques in the left hand
and upstrokes with the pick in the right. The technique feels strongly
like frailing a banjo, but the sound is an unusual and intricate hybrid
of rock and flamenco. It's driving and very contagious. </p>

<p>Jim told me about what was to become my favorite LA open mic - the Highland
Grounds in Hollywood. I think the best word for entertainment at the Grounds
is &quot;Performance Art.&quot; My first night there, I saw everything
from a sexy redhead in a bodysuit singing a cappella to a man in fishnet
stockings playing a toy saxophone while his partner recorded audience members
screaming and then played the tape over the PA. My own set went over well,
and the emcee gave me one of my best quotes afterwards when he referred
to me as &quot;a genuine virtuoso.&quot; </p>

<p>The Grounds is small and packed, and I found myself at a table with
several other musicians, among them Jim Prior, and a physicist-turned songwriter
named Jim Savarino who was to become a good musical friend. The person
running the door at the Grounds that night was Teeka Ballas, a very beautiful
17-year-old deadhead whose looks and personality had such an impact on
me that I wrote one of my best guitar tunes, &quot;Little Flower,&quot;
for her the next day, sitting in James' back yard in the sun and smog with
a guitar in my arms and a faraway look in my eyes. </p>

<h2>Tucson </h2>

<p>Tucson Arizona distinguished itself with the combination of cheapest
gas and best playing fees of the entire trip. My venue was the Cushing
Street Bar, a nice spot on the Southern fringe of downtown, just a few
blocks of KXCI, the local public radio station. The two shows I played
there were poorly attended, and other musicians I've spoken to have confirmed
that this is normal, so how they can afford to pay what they pay is beyond
me. However, this may explain the high quality of other musicians I met
while I was there. </p>

<p>When I arrived at Cushing Street, I found nobody who knew what was going
on. Somebody pointed towards an outbuilding, saying something about a PA
in there. I managed to find most of the parts, and hauled them into the
bar. As I was setting up, an odd, intense, balding man offered his help.
At some point, he gestured vaguely towards the tape deck behind the bar,
which was playing some interesting new-agey jazz piano music. &quot;Know
who this is?&quot; he asked. &quot;You?&quot; I guessed. He put out his
hand. &quot;Arvid Munson.&quot; </p>

<p>A few minutes later, Arvid was leading me downtown to the music store
in search of a microphone clip, and telling me stories about playing organ
with Sam Cooke's tour band. Once in the store, he told me &quot;You have
to meet Rainer,&quot; and led me down into the basement, where a lithe
young man was dressing the fretboard on an old Gibson hollowbody guitar.
Rainer was apparently the leader of the hot Tucson blues band. Arvid spoke
quite highly of his playing, which I've yet to hear. </p>

<p>A guitarist I did get to hear in Tucson is a soloist by the name of
Don Reeve. Don plays electroacoustic guitar through a rack of effects and
two amps in stereo. His music is loud, mesmerizing, and very textural.
When I met him, he had just released his second album, , and was getting
good feedback from commercial radio, a medium that I, with my eclectic
and unusual variety of sounds, have not tried to access. </p>

<p>Public Radio, on the other hand, provided me with some of my favorite
road memories. In Tucson, I managed to grab a last-minute spot on KXCI,
thanks to the kindness of the artist who was already booked, who let me
share his hour since I was passing through. </p>

<h2>Albuquerque </h2>

<p>Albuquerque was a good radio town. When I was setting up the tour, I
hooked up by phone with Sam Bawcum at KUNM, the public station at the University
of New Mexico. Sam had worked as a booker, and volunteered to help set
up gigs for me in town. He didn't actually have any shows set up for me
when I arrived, but he had opened just enough doors. </p>

<p>When I walked into the station to look for him, I hooked up instead
with Chris Martn, who was just about to go on the air with &quot;Free
Form.&quot; She threw my disc into a much-abused player in the record library,
and previewed a few tracks. I then followed her into the control room and
helped her assemble the first part of the show. We matched up some new
Pink Floyd live recordings with &quot;Frank Floyd Wright,&quot; a Floyd/Zappa
inspired multitrack improv I had assembled using samples I had collected
from all over. She interviewed me briefly, played &quot;Trendy Brenda,&quot;
and then I left to check out EJ's caf. </p>

<p>I was lucky enough to arrive in town about the time that EJ's (a folk-music
venue, and vegetarian caf near the university) changed managership. The
new manager made several drastic changes, including abolishing smoking
in the building and firing all the musicians on the current calendar. On
Sam's recommendation, he listened to me, and, liking what he heard, he
plugged me into the newly vacated spots. For two weeks, I lived at EJ's,
recuperating from my illness, and playing for meals and tips. I even emceed
the Monday night open mic, and got to meet some of the locals. </p>

<p>Sam's recommendation was again instrumental in getting me a featured
artist spot on KUNM's live variety show, broadcast from Tom Guralnick's
Outpost Performance Space. The show, done in front of an appreciative audience,
mixed my live set with improvised comedy sketches, in which I was able
to participate as well. </p>

<h2>Santa Fe </h2>

<p>Despite its reputation as a center for the arts, and its importance
in my life as a physical location for several seminal experiences, Santa
Fe almost misses having a place in this narrative. Santa Fe is a place
that, like Boulder, was nearly barren for me in terms of my professional
musical life. The exception was an enthusiastic but disappointing interview
with Johnny Lyons at KIOT, my one and only brush with commercial radio
on this trip. </p>

<p>Johnny had a commercial radio voice and a commercial radio attitude.
He seemed unable to grasp or respond to my mystical and unabashedly sexual
views on the creative process. I think that I intuitively or purposely
laid it out there in a very graphic way in reaction to his conservative
commercial approach. </p>

<p>Santa Fe was full of this polarity. Thanksgiving with my cousin CJ and
his mother Ann was a tense tightrope walk above Ann's crazy, tightlipped
repression, but we followed it with a relaxed evening with CJ's friend
Moira and members of her improvisational percussion group at a housesit
near Tesuque. We pulled out drums and, lacking enough drums, began to beat
on pots and pans, drumming well into the night. </p>

<p>After Thanksgiving, Rachel and I drove to Taos where she had an appointment
to view some of Michael Reynolds' earthships, partially underground houses
built of recycled tires and aluminum cans. These homes combine passive
solar heating with ambient earth temperature to create an efficient, self-heating
space. One such dwelling we visited, only half-completed, was nearly 80
degrees inside despite snow and 20 degree weather outside. Rachel had the
idea of building one of these structures in Port Townsend, possibly on
my land, to see if the idea was feasible in the Northwest. The drawback
was extensive use of adobe, a problematic material in a wet climate, but
something we thought we could work around. </p>

<p>Seeing these houses in person made the idea seem more feasible, and
we talked all the way back to Albuquerque about how to scrounge old tires
and other materials. The county landfill outside of Port Townsend was stockpiling
green glass, a glut in the market having made recycling it unfeasible,
and we considered the possibility of using green glass bottles in lieu
of aluminum cans for insulating air space. </p>

<p>The next day, I took Rachel back to the airport. We had discussed the
possibility of driving to Denver together, or even of sharing the rest
of the trip home, but her work schedule along with various logistical problems
(there was barely enough room in the back of the truck for me at night
as it was) made us decide against it. So, I dropped her off at the Albuquerque
airport, turned right back around, and drove northward up I-25, Colorado-bound.

<h2>Colorado Springs</h2>

<p>By the time I hit the Colorado Border just south of Trinidad, the ice
and snow were getting serious, making the driving slower. It had been fine
all the way from Albuquerque, through Santa Fe and the gently sloping,
curving plateau that leads up to Raton, where the Rockies suddenly rear
up and hoist the road onto their shoulders. From the border all the way
to Colorado Springs it was real cold and real ice, and I was glad I had
a warm place to stay with people who were expecting me.</p>

<center><p>* * * * * </p></center>

<p>It is getting late, Joyce is lying spent on the table in front of me,
and I am sipping my tea, practically tealess after hours of hot water refills
with no new bag. I am thinking about Stephen's life, his choices, and the
things that made me decide to leave my job and come out here on the road
to pursue my dreams, to cast myself into the void with no prospects, and
practically nothing holding me back. What would happen now if I did not
return, if the road, the desert, the open sky became a new home? Could
I leave Rachel, my mortgage, my friends behind and begin a new life here,
now? The prospect frightens me. I am homesick. I long for the security
and the safeness of a life already built.</p>

<p>I look back over the women I have met on this trip, ponder my willingness
to be with them, physically and otherwise, my lack of guilt over my tendency
to fall into new relationships. Have I missed Rachel's presence on this
trip? Could I actually leave her? I'm afraid the answer to both questions
is no. Too many choices. For better or for worse, it seems easier to stay
where I am than it is to reevaluate and sort out the many threads of my
conflicting desires. </p>

<p>As I pay for my tea and a few postcards, the cashier smiles, and the
questions remain in front of me. &quot;I'll see you again,&quot; I say,
not sure if I mean it. This place holds something for me, and I must return,
yet I do not know if I will be able to escape again once I get home and
confront the financial reality of this tour: I have not done well, and
I do not have the cash reserves to absorb what I have spent. </p>

<p>I crawl into the back of my pickup, parked in the KGNU lot, and arrange
my things for the night. Tapes and CDs are stacked against the passport
window. Guitars stack on their sides on the left wheelwell. My backpack
goes on top of the CDs, my skateboard on top of that. My shoes come off
and go on the right wheelwell. The contents of my pockets, my glasses,
all go into the shoes. After three months, it is a well-developed routine
that I can do in the dark. My sleeping bag unrolls over my futon, and I
climb in, clothed. I grope for my gallon jug of water, always by my left
foot with my hiking boots. I take a long pull.</p>

<p>Tomorrow is my last day in Colorado. My last gig is in Denver, tomorrow
night. Then there is the long drive home. Not to Montana, where I was hoping
for a week-long gig at a ski resort. Not to Davis for the ephemeral show
with Jethro Tull. I am winding it up, preparing for the return from the
unknown to the familiar. My mind races, and I fall to sleep early in the
morning, no closer to answers. </p>

<h2>Verde Valley School</h2>

<p><b><i>Day 45</i></b> </p>

<p>Of all the experiences I've had on the road, the one I had here will
have the most direct and immediate effect on my life. This is where I almost
went to high school - my second choice. I was here only once before, sixteen
years ago, on a trip with my mother. We came to Sedona because it was beautiful,
and made a side trip to the school because of its excellent reputation.
What brought me here this trip was that memory. </p>

<p>I was already booked at the Thousand Trails RV resort in Cottonwood,
just down the road. So, I called the school and offered to give a free
concert. The headmaster loved the idea, gave me names and numbers of newspapers
for promotion. When I arrived, my contact at the school, Dave Smeeth, was
off on a field trip. I found the auditorium, and was greeted by squalor.
Mattresses, scaffolding, discarded clothing, and bowls of jello - all remains
of the school Hallowe'en party - filled the building. It took me most of
the afternoon to clean it up. When Dave arrived back that evening, he was
extremely apologetic, and he organized a crew of kids to haul the mattresses,
now neatly stacked at the back of the hall, back to the dorm rooms whence
they came. </p>

<p>After my show (attended by a whopping four people), I was invited to
stay on at the school and, having no immediate obligations, I accepted.
I spent the next four days rockclimbing, sitting in on classes, eating
in the cafeteria, playing and composing on the school's Steinway, and sleeping
in the loft of the auditorium. Dave, a fellow musician and new friend,
was teaching geology, and I was introduced to the writing of John McPhee
while sitting in on his class (Basin and Range. Later, in Boulder, I made
a point of buying and reading two of his other books). </p>

<p>It was Dave who, during lunch at the cafeteria, encouraged me to consider
coming back to teach. I would need to complete my BA, but the school was
not requiring certification. Roy Grimm further whet my appetite by inviting
me to apply for project period, a ten-day event in January where teachers
came from the outside to teach a variety of disciplines. After this, I
took my exploration of the school more seriously, forming connections with
both teachers and kids, including Beth, a very flirtatious 12-year-old
strawberry blonde who developed a crush on me during a game of Ping Pong.
I let her wear my leather jacket for the rest of my stay, and was relieved
that she was honorable enough to give it back when I left. </p>

<p>It was Roy Grimm who suggested that I visit the Colorado Springs School.
Housed on a beautiful estate in that city, this was another progressive
private school. Roy was the former headmaster, and his replacement, , graciously
accepted me into his home for a few days while I visited the school and
scouted this college/military community for musical opportunities. I played
two pick-up gigs while I was there, and spent the rest of my time in John's
hot tub, reading John Irving, and contemplating the sunny, but cold Rocky
Mountain scenery. </p>

<p>Again, I spent time in classes, talked with teachers, played for an
assembly, and I happened to mention to several people that I was considering
getting my BA, contingent on finding a program that would let me do it
quickly, without a residence requirement. Anne, the science teacher, happened
to know of just such a program - the University Without Walls at Regis
University in Denver. </p>

<h1>FOUR</h1>

<p><b>Some Snakes</b></p>

<p>It's nearly one AM, and I'm sitting at the counter at My Brother's Bar
in Denver, contemplating my Guinness. Things are not looking good. The
four fellows to my right are talking animatedly to Greg, the bartender,
about the airline industry. They are British, ranging in age from mid twentysomething
to over fifty, and they build flight simulators. They are here to build
simulators for new planes about to be delivered to Stapleton airport. Then
it's off to Tenerife, or some such spot. </p>

<p>Miss Colorado was in here earlier, but she's left. Greg, and the Brits,
are very entertaining. I could sit here all night, but I glance over at
the far corner of the room where my PA equipment and guitars are, and I
realize that it's now or never. And I'm antsy. And I want to be back home.
I will drive at least as far as Cheyenne tonight. </p>

<p>My car is not in the best condition for traveling. Leaving Regis University
today, having spoken to an academic advisor and picked up an application
for the UWW program, my turn signals cut out. Then, the headlights wouldn't
work. I took it to a mechanic. No, they wouldn't be able to look at it
today. I found a spent fuse, and replaced it. The turn signal came back.
Then it went out again. I replaced the fuse again. The turn signal would
work, then start to make a buzzing sound, then cut out. I could wait out
the weekend, then have the car fixed, but I am too impatient. I will drive
like hell, and have the car fixed wherever I am on Monday. </p>

<p>I trudge back to the far corner of the room and start to pack up my
things. In the car, it is cold. Too cold for me. Ever since I was a child
I've dreamed frequently about snakes. I think of the snake - particularly
the rattlesnake - as my totem animal. Rattlesnakes hibernate in this weather.
Here, they have been in their dens for months. </p>

<p>As if in response to my thoughts, the turn signal buzzes like a rattle,
then cuts out again, dead. I pull over to replace the fuse, and muse over
that animal that has provided a central theme to this otherwise disjointed
tour. </p>

<h2>Mt. Shasta </h2>

<p>I started hiking out from rest areas out of boredom. After leaving Eugene,
I had four days before I had to be in Davis. So, rather than drive long
and hard straight to Sacramento, I drove to a rest area south of Medford
for the first night. Most rest areas are marked with parking limits - usually
somewhere between 6 and 24 hours. But, I found out after several nights
spent in the back of the truck that this rule is seldom, if ever, enforced.
I was never harassed by anybody, official or otherwise, at any point during
this trip, for parking or any other reason. </p>

<p>At the rest area near Medford, I took my first hike, down a dismal gravel
frontage road to an even more dismal gravel pit. Once I got out of the
gravel pit and into the hills behind, the going was much more pleasant
- rolling grassy foothills with a muddy stream cutting a steep swath back
towards the highway. I started back at a good pace when somebody arrived
at the gravel pit for target practice. I could hear the sharp report of
each shot followed by a reverberant boom as the sound came back echoed
and re-echoed off the many small hills. I could imagine some drunk backwoods
type, unpleasant at the best of times, but more so under the influence
of alcohol and carrying a gun. </p>

<p>I made my way through the ravine cut by the stream, keeping low to be
safe from stray gunfire. What if I look like a deer?, I thought. I kept
out of sight. Once on the flats, I hiked through the trees on a carpet
of trees criscrossed by many paths, until I somehow managed to find the
one that led back to the rest area.</p>

<p>The whole hike, that first time, I was paranoid about all my stuff left
in the truck. Guitars, amp, mikes, clothes, skateboard. It had not yet
become routine to leave my car for hours at a time, valuables locked in
the cab. I was almost surprised to return to my car and find it untouched.
Later, I realized that my practice was relatively uncommon; that most cars
in rest areas are left unattended for such short periods that theft is
hardly possible. Hence, car prowlers do not frequent these places. </p>

<p>At the rest area near Mount Shasta, a CalTrans worker unlocked a gate
to give me access to the woody scrub hills that rose steeply on one side.
I found a power company easement that gave me access to the hills which
turned out to support a residential community (hence the cyclone fence
keeping travelers from intruding). After several steep ups and downs, I
came to a low summit. Nearly to the top, I spotted a huge bird soaring
above me, so big that I assumed it must be a California condor, an endangered
bird more a legend to me than anything I ever expected to meet. A dropped
feather on the trail, about 15&quot; long, became part of the paraphernalia
dangling from my rearview mirror. (Later, in Petrified Forest National
Park, in Arizona, a park ranger asked me what the feather was. When I told
him my suspicion, he asked &quot;you know that's illegal to possess?&quot;
He did not confiscate the feather, but told me to keep it out of sight
until I was out of the park.) </p>

<p>The type of vegetation and dry earth here reminded me of hiking in L.A.,
and I was careful to keep watch for rattlesnakes, tossing rocks ahead of
me when walking in the low scrub to alert possible snakes to my presence.
When I returned to the car after scaling the fence back into the rest area,
I wrote a postcard to Rachel, making reference to the signs warning of
poison oak in the manicured bark gardens that lined the periphery of the
parking area. Hiking at the Mt. Shasta rest area, keeping a watchful eye
out for Crotalus Atrox and Quercus Irritans. </p>

<h2>Weston </h2>

<p>The watchful eye was still with me in the great valley when, near Modesto,
I stopped for the night at the Weston safety rest area. Here the signs
were for the snakes, not the Ivy. &quot;Warning,&quot; screamed the large
yellow triangles, &quot;there may be rattlesnakes in this area.&quot; </p>

<p>The hills looked inviting, so I hopped over the barbed wire fence and
took off on a cow path across the dry grass, up a narrow crevice between
two mammalian hills that were terraced as if for erosion control. All the
way across the pastureland, I eyed the cows nervously, remembering all
the many stories I'd read of dead runs before red-eyed bulls. When I had
to pass the herd, I did so on the far side of the barbed wire, passing
beneath the giant towers of the high-voltage lines, which seemed to be
the preferred hangout for the cattle. </p>

<p>The path I took, up the narrow crack, led eventually to the top of a
ridge, along which ran two well-worn tracks. They wound across the ridge,
up and down like a ribbon spit-pasted to the tops of the hills. I tried
to imagine driving that track in my truck, and decided that a jeep would
be better suited. Following the track off into the distance, my eyes wound
up at the ranch house that I supposed was the headquarters for this hundreds-of-acres
operation. I wondered if they were watching me. Only with binoculars, I
thought. Or a rifle sight. I was, after all, trespassing, and I didn't
know the attitude of the owners towards hikers. </p>

<p>I turned my attention to the land below, spread out before me, and I
saw two appealing canyons eroded into the dirt, sharp-edged and bare in
contrast to the rest of the miles and miles of brown grass. I started down,
leaving the road and the rest area behind on the far side of the ridge.
The canyons were fascinating. I could see how they drained water off the
hills into a small streambed. A road ran alongside the stream, and a very
few trees raised their branches between the two. The canyons, about ten
feet across, a hundred feet long, and twenty feet deep, were the only signs
of water erosion in the landscape, and I wondered why they existed there
alone. </p>

<p>As I walked up the first canyon, a beautiful light-grey owl flew from
a hole high in the wall, taking off in a straight line and not looking
back, in an attempt to lead me from the nest that must have been above
me. The second canyon housed a small hawk or falcon of some sort. </p>

<p>Hiking down to the stream bed, I saw what first appeared to be a sliver
of glass, but which turned out to be mineral - a flat sheet of soft, transparent
material that I assumed must be a mica of some sort. As I hiked back down
the road, I saw more and more of it in larger and larger pieces, some of
it trampled into glittering sand on the trail where hooves had pounded
it into the clay. Even the largest pieces were transparent and had the
same single cleavage plane as the first small piece. Suddenly, I looked
up at a hillside of soft dirt and saw it all around me, sparkling and throwing
prismatic reflections everywhere. Many of the pieces were the size of large
bricks, and I guessed that there was enough of it to build a small house.
I took a large piece of it with me. </p>

<p>At the bottom of the road was a gate, easily climbed, and the stream
bed meandered its way across the flat pastureland to empty through a culvert
under the highway. I kept to the stream bed as this kept me low and out
of sight of cows or men. </p>

<p>The stream made its way to the fence I had followed up the hill, and
there I found carnage: carcasses of perhaps ten, perhaps twenty sheep,
mostly rotten, piles of bones and hide with dried meat still clinging to
the bones. I guessed at some epidemic that decimated the flock. From the
pile I took an unbroken skull, easily detached, which I later cleaned and
wired to the hood of my car to bleach in the sun. </p>

<p>It was not far past the ovine graveyard that a sudden buzzing stopped
my feet. It was not so much a rattle as a hissing sound, a sizzle like
water thrown in a hot pan, like milk being steamed behind any espresso
counter in the world. I couldn't see the snake at first. The sound seemed
to come from everywhere. I was on a ridge above the stream bed at this
point, and it was a few seconds before I saw him coiled below me in the
sand, six feet away, partially hidden in the sparse brush. The mental process
that followed seemed long only because of the many years of fear spoken
at me by parents, teachers, and others. Stories of the viciousness, agility,
and strength of these small animals. </p>

<p>I knew that I had nothing to fear, that the snake was putting up a show
to scare me off. My fascination with snakes mingled and fought with a lifetime
of warnings - the same paranoia that gave rise to the yellow signs. The
adrenaline was surging through me. I was not afraid. It was the voices
of those parents, teachers, &quot;common sense&quot; that were afraid.
I knew I had to exorcise those voices. I apologized to the snake as I turned
to pick up a rock. </p>

<p>I aimed for the head, trying not to injure the body skin. My aim was
poor, and I soon had trapped the snake under two large broken pieces of
concrete. It tried to escape, struck feebly at the stick I held to its
throat, then died as I broke its spine with a crushing thrust. It writhed
for a long time after that. </p>

<p>People crowded around me as I walked back into the rest area. &quot;Is
it alive?&quot; &quot;What is it?&quot; &quot;Are you gonna eat it?&quot;
I nodded at that one. The Mexican man nodded knowingly, and told me about
a market where he used to buy snake carcasses &quot;this big around,&quot;
showing me his wrist. </p>

<p>The CalTrans worker who was cleaning the bathrooms scrounged me a piece
of wire and loaned me a knife. He warned me not to nick myself on the fangs,
and to throw the head down a gopher hole so that nobody could accidentally
poison themselves. I strung the snake up by its neck, cut the skin all
the way around, and stripped it off like a sock. I had trouble with the
rattle - it came off separately. I then cut off the head and cleaned the
meat under a faucet. The guts and head followed me back over the barbed
wire in search of a gopher hole. </p>

<p>I called Richard, my host in Modesto that night, and told him that I
was bringing dinner. When I arrived at his apartment with the snake in
a bag of ice scrounged from the rest area catering truck, he was nonplused.
However, he was not surprised. Richard had been in all my most interesting
classes at Crossroads, and knew me as a crazy, if shy, eccentric. He had
calmed down, gotten a business degree, and landed a gravy job with Gallo,
but retained enough of his own adventurous spirit that he got the barbeque
fired up, and handed me everything I asked for. A beer - for me, mustard
and spices - for the snake. When it came off the grill, the meat was so
good that I resented having to share the small meal. </p>

<p>My first stop the next day was at the hardware store. A six foot dowel
was not to be had, but I found that a piece of 3/4&quot; ID PVC pipe snugly
joined two four footers together. Hose clamps held on the guides that I
made from coat hangers stolen from Rich's closet. 1/8&quot; braided wire
cable completed my snake noose. I returned to the rest area, and spent
the rest of the day snake hunting. Despite my best intentions, and the
experience of the CalTrans worker, I had no luck at all. I continued to
hunt snakes at every rest area south of Modesto, but saw nothing more than
one shed skin while hiking down a dry waterfall at Tejon Pass, high above
Los Angeles. </p>

<center><p>* * * * * </p></center>

<p>It feels like terror, this running, born of insecurity, homesickness,
need to get back to a safeness. Seeing my fear, the demons have descended
upon me. Here I am at least not alone. There are many of us here, huddled
in our cars that are rocking in the powerful and bitterly cold wind. I
am hoping that the car does not freeze up while I sleep. </p>

<p>This blizzard began somewhere past Cheyenne, at about 5 AM - a very
fine snow at first noticeable only as it swirled on the road. Soon it came
in sheer veils, obscuring my vision not through opacity, as in a whiteout,
but through distraction, pulling my eyes to their brightness in my headlights.
I was glad to see the rest area - finally - someplace to shelter until
dawn when there would at least be light for me to continue my headlong
dash home. I huddle into the back, fully clothed in my sleeping bag, with
hat, mittens, two pair of socks. </p>

<p>A truck has arrived, idling next to me. Only the wind keeps the diesel
exhaust from seeping into my mobile bedroom as it has in countless rest
areas over the past months. The irregular beat of the idling engine is
a familiar lullaby, and it helps more than hinders my sleep. </p>

<h2>Flagstaff </h2>

<p>The weather cooled perceptibly as I headed north from Tucson, gaining
elevation as I passed through Prescott, then steeply down through Jerome
into the Verde Valley. But Flagstaff was the first I saw of winter this
trip. Day was sunny, but nighttime dropped below freezing at an alarming
rate. </p>

<p>My first day in town, I went to Northern Arizona University which, as
the largest employer and a large percentage of the population, rules the
town. One business owner told me that the college president had as much
or more to do with municipal policy and planning than the city council.
</p>

<p>I spoke with Tom S, NAU's guitar instructor, about the possibility of
putting together an accelerated BA program there. He was excited about
the concept, but discouraging about the possibility of such a program at
NAU. He had other ideas for me, gave me names and numbers. </p>

<p>I don't remember who suggested Macy's as a possible pickup gig - possibly
someone I met at the open mic at Charly's my first night in town - but
I liked the place immediately. Light, but not too light. Small, intimate,
but with room for privacy. Nice, simple tables and chairs. Marquetry chessboards
laid into the tabletops. The woman working the counter pointed out the
owner, Tim Macy, playing an intense game of chess towards the front of
the room. Study the board, make a decisive move, slap the timer. Fast.
Perhaps three to five seconds per move. Study, move, slap! </p>

<p>I waited until after the game to ask permission to perform. &quot;Can
you play me something now, as an audition?,&quot; he asked. I got a guitar
out of the car, launched into &quot;Little Flower,&quot; crouching at his
feet. He stopped me after less than ten seconds, like the chess game, laughing.
&quot;OK,&quot; he said, &quot;I just wanted to make sure you could play.&quot;
</p>

<p>After I played, and Macy's closed, it was cold. I wasn't ready to crawl
into the back of the truck, parked across the street in a sprawling, amorphous
parking lot, so I brought a book into the laundromat next door, where it
was warm and open late. A Hispanic couple were waiting for their one last
dryer load, and a pretty, efficient woman swept the floor. </p>

<p>I tried to ignore the man who sat across from me at the long white table,
but he was intent on me. He was probably in his late forties. Navaho, dressed
in the soiled motley of a street person. He held out a two-thirds-empty
bottle of cheap red wine. I declined. &quot;It's not polite to refuse to
share what's offered,&quot; he said.</p>

<p>I took the bottle, figuring the alcohol would kill any germs the rim
might harbor. &quot;I don't want any,&quot; I said, &quot;but just to be
polite, I'll share.&quot; I took a token swallow of sweet, warm wine, almost
like sherry. He smiled. </p>

<p>&quot;I have a riddle. What has four corners, stays in one corner, and
travels all over the United States, day and night?&quot; I shrugged. &quot;Think
about it,&quot; he said. I though about four cornered things. This room.
This table. My book. An envelope. </p>

<p>&quot;An envelope,&quot; I guessed. </p>

<p>&quot;Very close,&quot; he said. &quot;A postage stamp.&quot; He outlined
the form of an envelope, and indicated the upper right-hand corner. &quot;Four
corners, stays in one corner, travels all over the United States, day and
night.&quot; He laughed. </p>

<p>When the laundromat closed, he followed me outside. His name was Fort
Apache. He was born on the reservation in Tuba City. His brother was a
chess champion, his sister a black belt in judo. He had come to Flagstaff
to work, but when the work ran out, he was left to sleep in the street.
He asked where I was sleeping. I indicated my truck. &quot;It's cold. If
I sleep outside tonight, I'll die,&quot; he said, simply. </p>

<p>I was surprised how easily we both fit in my truck, head to foot, I
willing to put up with his unfamiliar and unwashed odor for the sake of
possibly saving his life. He finished his wine, and laid the bottle down,
neck cradled on a paper bag. &quot;Always leave the bottle with its head
to the East, like a person, to breathe. This helps hangover, makes you
healthy. Treat all this way.&quot; He paused. </p>

<p>&quot;Hey. A Navajo came before a judge for drinking. Judge sentenced
him to ten days in jail. The Navaho was proud. He said 'I'll do it standing
on my head.' 'Then I'll give you another ten days to get back on your feet.'
I grunted to acknowledge the joke. Fort told me lots of stories that night:
tall tales of his life on the reservation, and local lore about San Francisco
peak - about the dragon on top that devoured tourists, and that the mountain
got it's name because, from the top, you could look through a telescope
and see &quot;that Golden Gate Bridge.&quot; He kept repeating this phrase
- &quot;That Golden Gate Bridge,&quot; like a punchline.</p>

<p>Flagstaff is a city of many trains. Sometime that night, I heard three
trains blow their horns together in a major chord. </p>

<p>The next morning, Fort asked me for money. &quot;I'll make you a deal,&quot;
I said. &quot;I want to know how to catch rattlesnakes this time of year.
I'll give you money if you can tell me how.&quot; I had been obsessed with
these snakes since Modesto, but had seen none, despite hours of hiking
through amazing desert landscapes: the dry canyon in Cactus City, Ca.,
that must have emptied into the Salton Sea, where the sand held my tracks
so well that the second day I could read the word &quot;Reebok&quot; in
yesterday's print. The blasted heath at Ehrenberg on the Arizona border,
where Saguaros were the only break in the sunburned rocks. The spiny steep
hills west of Quartzite where the wind was strong enough to weather the
rock into cactus shapes, arches, and caves. The hugeness of the wilderness
behind the aqueduct at Salome, where I trespassed on US Government land
to rockclimb a butte littered with quartz roses and crystals. The natural
riprap ridges by Casa Grande where I saw a bobcat moving in the foreground
of a vista that stretched for miles in every direction. The fertile, creviced,
surprisingly soft rich brown earth at Sunset Point. The breathtaking redrock
of &quot;Monkey Face,&quot; where I rockclimbed in Sedona, and the jackrabbit-infested
white rock country of Cottonwood, a few miles away. </p>

<p>&quot;I know how to catch scorpions,&quot; he said. &quot;Go into the
desert and burn some wood to a fine, white ash. Cover your hand with a
thick layer of this ash. Hold your hand out to the scorpion. It will come
onto your hand. When it does, speak your heart to it, ask for its protection.
Then let it go. It will be your protector. When I did this, the scorpion
ran up my arm and stung me here.&quot; he showed me a round scar on his
biceps. &quot;When I showed this to my grandfather, he told me that I would
be very strong, and that I would live to be one hundred and twenty years
old. You can catch rattlesnakes the same way. </p>

<p>To attract the snakes, go into the desert and speak the prayer 'Hey.'
The snake will come to you. When he opens his mouth at you, throw some
ash inside. He will hallucinate and lay still. Then you can pick him up
and speak your heart to him, ask him to be your protector. Then let him
go. He will be your protector.&quot; </p>

<p>I reminded Fort that it was the fall; that the snakes would be in their
dens. He taught me a song: </p>

<ul>
<li>Ya ka sha Shosha </li>

<li>Ho sha na </li>

<ul>
<li>Hey ney ney ney </li>

<li>Ya ka sha </li>

<li>Ho sha na </li>

<li>Hey ney ney ney </li>
</ul>
</ul>

<p>He explained that Shosha was the name of the bear, and that this song
was to draw bear out of hibernation, but that it should work for rattlesnakes
as well. He said that because I was a rookie, I should be prepared to sleep
in the desert for several days, singing the song to the four directions.
</p>

<p>At my request, he told me the name of the rattlesnake - Do'a chi'a ni'i.
He explained that the last two syllables turned quickly, like the rattle
of the snake. </p>

<p>When we left the truck, Fort thanked me and gave me his English name
and address. He was disappointed in the ten dollars I gave him, and tried
to get me to give him more for the riddle of last night. I declined. He
would not let me take his picture. </p>

<p>In Macy's, a shriveled old black man had strings of beads set up on
a table in the window. I spent my money on a string of cobalt blue glass.
I shared a table that morning with Spencer Edgerton, who had seen me perform
the night before. I told him of my rattlesnake obsession, and he showed
me a drawing he had done while I played: a geometric pattern with running
figures and a two-headed snake in the center. The caption read &quot;It's
a snake! Run! It's a Run! Snake! I expressed interest in the design as
a cassette cover, and he gave it to me, writing his name and address on
the back. I wished him luck on his travels, he on mine. </p>

<center><p>* * * * * </p></center>

<p>At seven, it is light enough to see - a watery grey light that seems
tangible. I get back onto I-80, along with slowmoving semis, their hazard
lights flashing. The fine snow is still falling. On the road, it is a few
inches deep, but flows around the tires like clouds. It collects on the
windshield. I turn on the wipers. Only the passenger side works. I try
not to panic. I turn on my hazard lights, edge slowly towards the right
shoulder. I can see nothing in front or behind me. </p>

<p>Suddenly, there is something beside me. I watch a dreamlike slowmotion
scene as a semi roars by on my right, off the shoulder, barely missing
me. The truck passes to the right of a roadsign. The driver is trying to
pull back onto the road. The truck begins to jackknife. I can almost swear
I see the hand of God pick the truck up and put it back on the road, an
impossible save from a certain crash, by a driver who must be extremely
skilled or divinely blessed. Then he is gone. </p>

<p>I swear in that moment that if I meet the driver further down the road,
I will offer him my life. When I get out of the car, I am shaking too much
to continue, and I am praying to the God of my childhood to please let
me survive this trip. Despite my paralyzing fear, survival instinct hauls
me out of the truck to repair the wiper and get back onto the road, the
sooner to move on out of this storm, out of the fear of sudden death. </p>

<p><a name="11"></a>[11] When I bought my truck, intuition told me that
her name was Betsy. However, this sounded too American to me - a Ford name
- so I figured the name must be &quot;Beh-Tzi,&quot; an Easternization<a href="rt2-39-74.htm#39">[39]</a>.
When I explained this to friends, they wanted to know what the name meant.
Jeanne Hardy<a href="rt2-39-74.htm#40">[40]</a> volunteered to ask her
Chinese daughter-by-marriage Fon what the name meant, if anything, in Chinese.
She duly reported back that Beh-Tzi was a type of cabbage<a href="rt2-39-74.htm#41">[41]</a>.
I thought this was appropriate, because she steered like one. The name
stuck, until one evening when Rachel and I were having dinner at her sister
Wendy's house in Seattle. Somehow the name came up, and Wendy, a former
rabbinical student almost choked on her fish-head soup. 'Did you say Beh
Tzi, or Beh-Tzim? &quot;, she asked, incredulously<a href="rt2-39-74.htm#42">[42]</a>.
&quot;Why?&quot; I countered. &quot;What does Beh-Tzim mean?&quot; &quot;Well,
translated literally, it means eggs,&quot; she replied, &quot;but colloquially,
it's used to mean testicles.&quot; The table erupted into titters and guffaws.
The name has been Beh-Tzim since. </p>

<p><a name="12"></a>[12] Technically, my first car was a white Volkswagen
squareback that I inherited from my father when he died in 1975. It was
sold for four hundred dollars, the money becoming part of my trust fund.
</p>

<p><a name="13"></a>[13] When my mother bought the car, it was a lemon
yellow. However, she was in a fender- bender sometime in the mid-1970s<a href="rt2-39-74.htm#43">[43]</a>,
and the car was repainted a light blue after the fenders were un-bent.
</p>

<p><a name="14"></a>[14] Larry always used to say that Carmen was his favorite
name for a woman </p>

<p><a name="15"></a>[15] I learned to drive in a high-school Driver's Ed.
course, on an automatic, at which I became fairly proficient. After that,
for practice, I drove with Allen Koehn, a friend of my mother's <a href="rt2-39-74.htm#44">[44]</a>,
in his Kaarman Ghia, which was a semi-automatic shift. It had a gearshift
on the floor, which shifted almost like a manual, but which still had the
automatic transmission. I took my driver's test in that car. When I first
drove Carmen, I had never driven a manual transmission before, and it was
rough going. My first outing was with Larry, going to Michael Savadove's
house in Hollywood<a href="rt2-39-74.htm#45">[45]</a>. At one point, we
were on Sunset Blvd., and I was trying to turn left. There was a long line
of cars behind me in the turn lane. I kept stalling, over and over again,
like a bad dream. Cars were honking behind me, people yelling. Finally,
I gave it lots of gas before letting out the clutch, rather than simultaneously
as I had before. Finally, the car eased out of the turn lane into the turn.
I haven't had difficulty with a stick shift since. Sometime that same day,
I was backing out of Larry's driveway, and destroyed the left taillight
against a fence. I remember going to my mother in dread, knowing that I
would be in trouble. I was surprised that she took it so lightly. She had
me investigate the cost of replacing the taillight lens. The cost was ridiculous
($44.00 for the lens itself), and we elected to let the car remain scarred.
</p>

<p><a name="16"></a>[16] Before getting my license, I walked, skateboarded,
or cycled my way around town. I was proud of the fact that I didn't need
to drive or be driven. I was amazed at how easy it was to get around West
L.A. without driving<a href="rt2-39-74.htm#46">[46]</a>. The majority of
my travel was the daily trip to school and back - about three miles each
way from home in Brentwood<a href="rt2-39-74.htm#47">[47]</a> to school
in Santa Monica<a href="rt2-39-74.htm#48">[48]</a>. </p>

<p>After I had my license, I drove to school. It didn't take long before
I was sleeping in later and later because I knew it wouldn't take me as
long to get to school. Soon, I was arriving in class late because I underestimated
my travel time. At the same time, I became flabby. My muscles quickly lost
bulk and tone, and I gained weight. I considered myself lazy, yet I could
not stop myself as long as I had the crutch. When Carmen was totaled, I
saw it as a sign from God that I was not prepared to have a car, that I
must go back to my old habits of walking, cycling, and skateboarding. </p>

<p><a name="17"></a>[17] I liked to ride in the back, and so it was usually
I who got to sit atop our amplifiers in the back while James drove us to
a party or a rehearsal spot. James was a maniac driver, and often I would
be sprawled out on top of the equipment, nearly at the same height as the
cab roof, one hand on each roll bar, and gritting my teeth as James took
sharp turns at speed, or took sudden &quot;O&quot; turns for no reason
in the middle of an empty road. Larry would be in the cab saying &quot;Uh...
Jim, do you think you could uh... slow down a little? I think Nick's about
to fall off ... .. I'm okay,&quot; I'd squeal through the back window.
&quot;It's just these amps rock back and forth a lot. I'm afraid we might
lose them<a href="rt2-39-74.htm#49">[49]</a>.&quot; </p>

<p><a name="18"></a>[18] During my 1985 trip to L.A., I spent a month staying
with Brenda DeHaan, a friend and colleague of my next-door neighbor<a href="rt2-39-74.htm#50">[50]</a>,
Gale. Brenda had a beautiful white Mazda RX-7 which was her pride and joy.
While I was there, it was broken into. She took the car to a shop in Santa
Monica to have it repaired, and made an appointment at a shop in Pasadena
to have an alarm installed. She had a rental car while all this was going
on. When it came time to pick the Mazda up and deliver it out to Pasadena,
she ran into a logistical problem, and asked me to drive her car while
she drove her rental. I refused. I had no license, it was an unfamiliar
car, and I had not driven a car since 1981, except for a few isolated short
trips in Gale's Toyota Celica, and a tractor on the ranch in Santa Fe,
which hardly counted. I don't remember how she talked me into it, probably
a mixture of screaming and pleading. Anyway, I did it. Paranoid the whole
way. By the end of the trip, I had decided two things. First, that I would
get a driver's license again. Second, that the Mazda RX-7 was my dream
car. </p>

<p><a name="19"></a>[19] Robin Moffett, a beautiful brown-haired singer
in her thirties. She always had a deal going. &quot;My producer is trying
to get me a gig opening for (fill in the band name),&quot; she would say,
or &quot;We were at the Village Recorder today, working on my demo.&quot;
She used to tell me about the time her old band opened for Bread in Hawaii.
I had a huge crush on her, but wasn't quite sure about all her ethereal
projects. At one point, she was griping about men, and I wrote her a blues
song<a href="rt2-39-74.htm#51">[51]</a> that I thought she might want to
add to her repertoire. She seemed flattered, but only said that she'd get
back to me, like any typical member of the Los Angeles recording industry<a href="rt2-39-74.htm#52">[52]</a>.
</p>

<p>Robin had a gorgeous five-year-old daughter named Celeste who I'm sure
is growing up to be a beauty, and an equally beautiful kitten named Fluffy,
who took up residence in an aloe vera plant on our front porch one day.
After coming over to get him three or four times, Robin finally admitted
defeat, and we let &quot;Fluffy&quot; into the house. His name was promptly
changed to Druid, and he grew up to be an unprecedentedly beautiful cat<a href="rt2-39-74.htm#53">[53]</a>
</p>

<p><a name="20"></a>[20] Sequim, although it is a dreary strip-mall town,
had a relaxed feeling to it that I enjoyed, and it became a place that
I liked to escape to. There were a few months in 1984 when I was seeing
a woman there who I met through a personals ad<a href="rt2-39-74.htm#54">[54]</a>.
Karen lived in a tiny drafty cabin with no running water, and a flimsy
tin woodstove for cooking and heating<a href="rt2-39-74.htm#55">[55]</a>.
She was thirty, which was younger than other women I had dated, and pretty.
She did not feel a sexual attraction for me, but we spent several nights
together in her bed, keeping each other warm<a href="rt2-39-74.htm#56">[56]</a>.
Karen was very poor, and it made me feel good to come over to Sequim on
the bus and buy her food or split firewood for her. I remember one occasion
when we went to the store and bought spinach, potatoes, and some other
vegetables. At home, she scrubbed the spinach repeatedly, using boiled
water from a creek outside, obsessed with removing all the dirt. She couldn't
afford to get sick, she said. The meal she made on the woodstove was delicious.
Karen worked in a couple of different restaurants, but she couldn't hold
jobs very long. I'm guessing that she had little patience for other peoples'
routines. </p>

<p><a name="21"></a>[21] I wrote a story about the incident, which was
never published [Appendix 11.] </p>

<p><a name="22"></a>[22] I had been working for Tom's Meats for three years,
and Tom elected to take a month's vacation, leaving the shop in my hands.
After two days, the stress got to me, and I came down with flu symptoms.
At first, I came in and worked sick. Then, it got too bad, and I tried
to run the shop from my bed, giving instructions to John, who had only
worked there a few weeks. Within a few days, he quit, unwilling to put
in the hours necessary to keep the shop up and running. Starla, Tom's wife,
refused to lift a finger to help. She and Tom had been fighting, and she
wanted nothing to do with the market. In all, I was absent from the shop
for about two weeks. </p>

<p><a name="23"></a>[23] Rachel, Gabrielle, my Mother, and her boyfriend
David Mathieson. </p>

<p><a name="24"></a>[24] Other-wise known as the &quot;Anal Probe<a href="rt2-39-74.htm#57">[57]</a>.&quot;
A flexible fiber optic cable is inserted in the rectum, and threaded up
the colon. I was disappointed that the unit they were using didn't have
the capability to record on videotape, as I would love to have that particular
journey on tape<a href="rt2-39-74.htm#58">[58]</a> (or at least to have
seen my own innards on a screen). As it was, my colon was a private visual
experience for my doctor alone. He described it as &quot;road-rashed<a href="rt2-39-74.htm#59">[59]</a>.&quot;
During the procedure, I was amazed to feel the end of the scope poking
my belly. I could feel it there, pressing outwards. The sensations, however,
were on the surface of the skin (there are no nerve endings in the colon).
</p>

<p><a name="25"></a>[25] The worst pain I have ever experienced is associated
with intestinal cramping. I generally have a high pain threshold, but intestinal
pain brings with it an emotional component, a despair so intense it makes
almost any action impossible. My father was prone to intestinal problems
- he had a chronic colitis, which is apparently congenital. I have never
shown signs of having the disease, but it perhaps explains my predisposition
to intestinal problems when under stress<a href="rt2-39-74.htm#60">[60]</a>.
</p>

<p><a name="26"></a>[26] This made me recall Edward Albee's &quot;The American
Dream,&quot; in which I played the part of the Young Man<a href="rt2-39-74.htm#61">[61]</a>.
There is a reference in the play to enema bottles, after which one of the
characters points out that there is no such thing, and that the speaker
certainly means enema bags. I chuckled over this, if over nothing else,
while receiving mine. </p>

<p><a name="27"></a>[27] At the time, she worked at the local animal shelter<a href="rt2-39-74.htm#62">[62]</a>.
</p>

<p><a name="28"></a>[28] She later asserted that it was during this period
that she fell in love with me. Most impartial observers agreed with me
in believing that she fell for me months before. Our association began
through Gabrielle, as Rachel was one of Gabrielle's favorite friends. I
was always very attracted to Rachel, and at some point, I began to meet
her for croissants every morning before work<a href="rt2-39-74.htm#63">[63]</a>.
Our friendship grew, and soon she was coming in to the meat market to see
me fairly often. Meanwhile, Gabrielle and I had admitted to each other
that the relationship wasn't working. We had ceased to have sex, and did
not sleep together, though she was still living in my house, she unable
to work because of a repetitive motion injury sustained while working the
cash register in Aldrich's grocery, in the back of which I cut and sold
meat for Tom. That solstice <a href="rt2-39-74.htm#64">[64]</a>, Rachel's
younger sister, Wendy, came to visit from Philadelphia. The moment I met
Wendy, I fell swooningly in love. I wanted to get her address, to write
to her, but it seemed futile. She made it very clear that she could never
live in a place like Port Townsend<a href="rt2-39-74.htm#66">[66]</a>.
So, I continued to court Rachel, buying her flowers for Valentine's day,
having her over for movies and sushi. In February, during a late winter
snowstorm, Gabrielle said to me, while on a walk, &quot;the one person
I really don't want you to leave me for is Rachel. That would really hurt
me.&quot; By that time, I felt that it was already too late, but I didn't
say anything. </p>

<p><a name="29"></a>[29] The first is, of course, Salmonella, I did some
research to discover whether I had a case for getting help with my bills
from industrial insurance. I discovered that Campylobacter is a common
bacteria, carried in the intestinal tract of poultry. The bacterium commonly
is found in traces of feces on the feathers. Since I kept chickens at home,
the chances are good that I encountered the bacteria there, rather than
at work. I also discovered, making calls to State health officials and
our chicken supplier, that Campylobacter occurs in cattle as a venereal
disease. </p>

<p><a name="30"></a>[30] The strange thing is that I was in much better
financial shape after this hospital visit than before. My bill was in excess
of $2000 - more than two months'pay. I set up a payment plan and began
to budget my finances around the hospital bills. This forced me to examine
my spending. Suddenly, I seemed to have more money each week than I had
before. My first paycheck of the month would take care of the hospital
bill, the next my housepayment, and so on until the last check of the month,
which wound up being leisure money. At the same time, I fixed up one of
my two bedrooms - the one that had been mine before Gabrielle moved out<a href="rt2-39-74.htm#67">[67]</a>
- and rented it out, to Kari Wilson, who worked at Aldrich's<a href="rt2-39-74.htm#68">[68]</a>.
I have had a tenant in that room since, and it helps enormously with the
bills. </p>

<p><a name="31"></a>[31] At the time, I thought I was contagious, and so
refused to kiss her. This added to the excitement. Later, my doctor told
us that the disease was only passed through feces. Kissing was safe. </p>

<p><a name="32"></a>[32] </p>

<p><a name="33"></a>[33] When I met Vinny, he was building folk harps,
and had supplied one to Children's Workshop Theater as a prop for Robin
Hood, in which I played the part of Allan A'Dale, the minstrel<a href="rt2-39-74.htm#69">[69]</a>.
A year later, I became aware that the harp was for sale, and I worked out
a trade - ten massages and the remainder in cash. I got my massage license
in 1983, after studying with Cathryn at Morningstar ranch. The State board
exam was laughable - the written test was a simple multiple choice affair.
One black man with a fur coat and many gold rings was running from table
to table before the exam, giving pointers to several young women in tight,
bright-colored clothing<a href="rt2-39-74.htm#70">[70]</a>. The practical
exam had little or nothing to do with my expertise as a massage therapist.
Firstly, the exam was based entirely on the Swedish system of massage,
which was a modality that I had no intention of practicing to any great
degree<a href="rt2-39-74.htm#71">[71]</a>. Secondly, the examiners seemed
to have little interest in my technique. There were five of them, plus
a stenographer who recorded everything that was said. The room was too
cold for the model. All five examiners had sour, cynical expressions, and
they did everything they could to intimidate me<a href="rt2-39-74.htm#72">[72]</a>.
The questions were more negative than interrogatory. 'That didn't look
like a deep stroke.&quot; &quot;You shouldn't be dipping your hand directly
into the massage cream.&quot; </p>

<p><a name="34"></a>[34] Specifically, I suggested a homeopathic treatment,
which would retrace Francois' health history, and work out the systemic
problem one layer at a time. </p>

<p><a name="35"></a>[35] The project failed, largely because of the proximity
of Indian Island, across the bay. This is an ordinance annex, where ammunition
is unloaded before ships and submarines proceed into Bremerton for repair
and refitting. At the time, the base refused to say whether or not nuclear
weapons were present, or could be present at the base at any time. </p>

<p><a name="36"></a>[36] There have been several such coffeehouses in Port
Townsend. All have closed for lack of support. Quincy street was typical.
It was a no-smoking, no-alcohol environment that was oriented towards art
and music. It was run by artists and musicians. There was minimal foodservice.
Atmospherically, artistically, it was a total success. However, it was
not successful as a business<a href="rt2-39-74.htm#73">[73]</a>. The owners
wound up working for free, the musicians for whatever tips they could glean
from an audience that was unemployed or that lived outside the economic
system<a href="rt2-39-74.htm#74">[74]</a>. </p>

<p><a name="37"></a>[37] One poster for Quincy Street read &quot;Vinny
Pollina - local hero.&quot; The band name sprung naturally from this, although
Vinny always considered the name a joke. He thought of us, I think, as
Vinny Pollina and Friends. </p>

<p><a name="38"></a>[38] Sometimes I become a little too caught up in the
music. Often, while playing with Vinny, I would hit a wrong chord, and
Vinny would look over at me with an odd look that reminded me of one of
Jim Henson's Muppets. Mostly, though, I do well embellishing another performer's
work. </p>

<p><a name="39"></a>[39] Naturally, many people point out that &quot;Beh-Tzi&quot;
is Chinese, though the truck was made in Japan. </p>

<p><a name="40"></a>[40] Jeanne is the founder of the Spotted Chicken Society,
a group of chicken-compatible individuals who are dedicated to saving the
world, starting with spotted chickens (a spotted chicken is one that has
spots, or that has been observed.) I was introduced to the SCS by my friend
Alexandra Elizabeth Bahia Sloop Bradley in 1985, when she got me a month's
subscription to the Spotted Chicken Report as a joke. I quickly became
a fan, and I have been a member of the society since. Members are concerned
with simple living, spirituality, wholeness, and fixing the world. In many
senses, the SCS is my religion. </p>

<p>Every year or so, there is an annual reunion, to which flock SCS members
and chicken- compatible friends from all over the U.S. The reunion is held
outside of Twisp, a small town in North Central Washington, at Medicine
Wheel Farm, Jeanne's ranch. </p>

<p><a name="41"></a>[41] Later, I came across this name as &quot;Pe-Tzi,&quot;
in Gunter Grasse's novel &quot;The Flounder.&quot; It is included in one
of the many recipes that are scattered throughout the book. </p>

<p><a name="42"></a>[42] The ending &quot;-im&quot; denotes a plural in
Hebrew. </p>

<p><a name="43"></a>[43] She was rear-ended on the Pacific Coast Highway.
She was wearing her seatbelt at the time, though she usually didn't. From
that time forward, she has always worn a seatbelt. </p>

<p><a name="44"></a>[44] Another person who shares my birthday, although
he is many years older. </p>

<p><a name="45"></a>[45] Yet another person who shares my birthday. Michael
and I are the same age, but he was born in Japan, across the date line,
so it is debatable whether we actually share the birthday. In high school,
Michael played Don Juan to my Carlos. He was the school stoner. He had
long hair, dressed in overalls with no underwear beneath, preached free
love, and looked almost exactly like the character RiffRaff in the Rocky
Horror Picture Show. I was straight at the time, and he hinted at having
great knowledge about drugs. (&quot;What is LSD like?&quot; &quot;You see
God.&quot;). One year, I told him that we had a morning glory vine in the
backyard - white morning glories, which are supposed to contain a psychedelic
alkaloid. He got me a recipe for extracting the alkoloid, and stole me
ether and methyl alcohol from the school science department. I set up a
makeshift lab in the garage, and soon supplied him with a few gelatin capsules
full of an orange paste. A few weeks later, I asked him if the stuff had
been any good. &quot;I don't know,&quot; he said. &quot;I ate the capsules,
but then I dropped some LSD-25 an hour later.&quot; </p>

<p>The height of his influence on me came during an eighth grade trip to
Catalina Island. One night, we walked out together behind the camp with
several buckets of food waste, to give to the wild pigs that populate the
island. Soon after we left the camp, the pigs closed in. Michael was ahead
of me, and had the flashlight. I was immersed in darkness, with the sounds
of seemingly hundreds of hooves and pig grunting all around me. It was
a very numinous experience for me, as if we were being surrounded by spirits
that only seemed to have the form of pigs. I commented to Michael that
it was as if he was Don Juan, and I was Carlos, and he was taking me on
a power walk, surrounded by spirits<a href="RT2-75.htm#75">[75]</a>. </p>

<p><a name="46"></a>[46] My friends were appalled when I bicycled twenty
miles out into the San Fernando Valley to go to a party at one of the houses
that Larry shared with his band. Few people realize how much smaller Los
Angeles is than it seems when one is driving. Traffic moves so slowly there
on such a regular basis, that it often makes far more sense to use alternative
forms of transport. The drawback, of course, is the smog, which makes it
dangerous to exert oneself[76]. I got a nasty case of Bronchitis when I
began jogging a three-mile route along the median of San Vicente Blvd.
</p>

<p><a name="47"></a>[47] 929 Gretna Green Way, near the corner of Wilshire
and Bundy. I try to drive by whenever I'm in L.A., see what has been done
to the house. The couple who bought the house from my mother when we moved,
Tim and Della Cass[77], renovated extensively. They let me tour the house
when I went back in 1985. The house was barely recognizable. It was pretty
creepy to go into the house where I had lived for nearly twenty years,
and see it remodeled in the taste of somebody else. It was especially creepy
to go out into the garage, which had been converted into a room for me,
and see it back as a garage again. Particularly when I looked up at the
ceiling[78]. The trailing vines that I had painted were still there, and
the light fixtures were the same, though the rest of the space was unrecognizable.
</p>

<p><a name="48"></a>[48] 1714 21st Street, near the comer of 20th and Olympic.
Crossroads is in the middle of a Chicano ghetto/ industrial area, and began
in a group of former warehouses, whose flat roofs prompted the dean, while
in an alcohol-altered state at a Calculus class party[79], to suggest fencing
off the roofs, and growing marijuana there to finance the school scholarship
fund[80]. </p>

<p><a name="49"></a>[49] I was mostly concerned for my Marshall half-stack,
which was my pride and joy. Before I bought it, I was playing through a
20 watt Peavey Backstage practice amp, which was hardly adequate for the
Led Zeppelin style rock covers that we were doing in Free Toe Beach[81].
I lusted after a Marshall half-stack that had been in the showroom at Ace
Music in Santa Monica for as long as I'd been shopping there[82]. Finally,
I managed to scrape together 800 bucks, and my mom kicked in 400 bucks
that she owed me, which made up the 1200 dollar purchase price. The day
that Larry, James, and I went to buy the Marshall was the only time I ever
cut school. I had been scribbling &quot;Marshall Time&quot; in my notebooks
at school all day, and finally I couldn't stand it any more. We left at
lunch, taking my mother's check for $400.38 to her bank to cash it. Almost
before I realized what was happening, the cashier counted out $438 into
my hand. I had a split second to decide whether to call the error to her
attention. I didn't. I treated Larry and James to lunch at the Apple Pan
with the excess. </p>

<p>The cashier at Ace music was shocked when I counted out twelve hundreds
on the counter. &quot;I want that Marshall,&quot; I said proudly. &quot;You
got it,&quot; he replied[83]. </p>

<p><a name="50"></a>[50] Gale was a client of one of my mother's colleagues
in Los Angeles. The colleague was moving to Port Townsend to be near my
mother, who had moved to Port Townsend to be near another colleague[84].
Gale wanted to move to Port Townsend to be near her therapist. My mother
sent her to me for a young person's view of Port Townsend[85]. We were
disagreeing from the moment we met. We went out to a movie that night,
and seduced each other on my sofa afterwards. The next day, she investigated
the house next door, which was for sale. Several months later, she moved
into the house, and has lived there since. Our relationship was rocky.
She didn't want me to tell anybody that we were anything more than friends.
She didn't want to be my girlfriend. She encouraged me to see other women,
but she got screamingly furious when I did. Nothing I did was right for
her. I was too honest. I smelled bad. I left the toilet seat up. My opinions
were all wrong. I suffered through all this abuse because I didn't know
any better. This was my first relationship. She was nine years older. </p>

<p>On the positive side, she was a dance instructor, and taught me the
Tango[86]. I took all of her classes for free. We had hours and hours of
time together, which we spent talking, reading to each other, doing puzzles,
discussing our dreams. The sex was great. She had money and spent it on
me. On my twenty-first birthday, she bought me an expensive phone answering
machine, took me out for drinks, and bought me a steak and lobster dinner
at the best place in town. </p>

<p>When we finally split up for good, she invited Heather and Randy, a
couple she met at the food co-op, to come home and live with her. For several
weeks, I eyed the Volkswagen bug at her house with distrust. It took a
month or so for me to accept them into the neighborhood, after Gale and
I were speaking again, and she made it clear that they were staying. For
about a year, they lived on the hill, first with Gale, and then with me,
paying no rent, and bringing home other friends for communal meals. We
began to refer to the arrangement as the Commune. </p>

<p><a name="51"></a>[51] &quot;When Your Man Leaves Town.&quot; </p>

<p><a name="52"></a>[52] Originally, when my mother announced that she
was going to move in six months, I decided that I was going to stay behind,
to be near the recording industry. I remember the steps involved in causing
me to reverse this decision. Robin was one of them, though not the first.
Larry lived just down the street from Richard Dashut, the producer for
Fleetwood Mac. Larry met him, and got to hear all about the new album,
'Tusk.&quot; Richard was all smiles, all positives, but despite the feigned
care, Larry seemed to be a nonentity, having nothing to offer him. Not
long before leaving L.A., I had a housepainting job for a couple in Venice.
The man, Steve, was rehearsing a band one day in the house while I was
painting in the other room. He, too, was friendly on the surface. After
working for him, however, I came to see how superficial this friendliness
was. </p>

<p>The moment I changed my mind, I was walking up Barrington Avenue from
my house towards the Brentwood Post Office. It was a warm, sunny day. I
was getting close to Barrington Park. Suddenly, it all seemed wrong. The
experiences I'd had with these twofaced people in the Los Angeles music
scene came together and descended over the landscape like a transparent
curtain that I nevertheless could see and feel around me. I knew, suddenly,
that I did not want to remain in this city. I went straight home and told
my mother that I was coming with her. </p>

<p><a name="53"></a>[53] Druid had the most beautiful dark rims around
his eyes, and the longest eyelashes that I had ever seen on a cat. He was
a long, lithe beast, who loved more than anything to play with my mother's
mink-hair makeup brush, which he would steal off of her dressing table[87].
When we moved from Los Angeles to Port Townsend, he was so traumatized
by the drive that he became extremely neurotic, and put on lots of weight,
becoming a pillow before our eyes. Thunder, our other cat, and the queen
of the household[88], took the move better, and is still, at thirteen,
a dainty and very dignified lady. </p>

<p><a name="54"></a>[54] There was a paper in Port Townsend called the
Olympic Trader, which had a personals section. After Gale had run an ad
with some success, I began to experiment. My first ad read &quot;Male fish
looking for female eagle. I can teach you to swim if you can teach me to
fly[89].&quot; I tried a few more ads after that, including one soliciting
for an affair with a married woman[90]. One ad gained me enough notoriety
that people still mention it to me today. It ran on the front page in bold
type (not in the personals section): 
<br>
<br></p>

<ul>
<p><b>SEND ME MONEY 
<br>No obligation, No amount too small 
<br>Nick Dallett, 
<br>308 Discovery Rd. 
<br>Port Townsend, Wa. 98368[91] </b></p>

<p>
<br></p>
</ul>

<p><a name="55"></a>[55] These stoves are frequently referred to as &quot;Hippie-killers.&quot;
</p>

<p><a name="56"></a>[56] This, to me, is the best part about sleeping with
someone. Even the best sex is over in a fairly short time. If I had to
choose, I'd take the cuddling, the waking up together, over the fucking
any day of the week. I did seduce Karen once, but once I got her aroused
enough to want to make love, she lay there like a rag doll, unwilling to
move or even to kiss me. I soon gave up in disgust. </p>

<p><a name="57"></a>[57] I suppose that, having had this experience, it
is not necessary for me to be abducted by an alien spaceship. </p>

<p><a name="58"></a>[58] I am well known for taping my life. I have been
recording musical rehearsals, performances, jam sessions, and sometimes
just dinner conversatioi-1, since I was nine years old[92]. Since 1989,
I have started to videotape as well (I have made super-8 films for years
as well, but more for artistic reasons than documentary[93]. Video is so
much more accessible.) </p>

<p><a name="59"></a>[59] A metaphor I can easily grasp. I have been riding
a bicycle since I was about five[94], and have spent a fair amount of time
gathering empirical data on the coefficient of friction of various surfaces
when in contact with the skin. I think the worst road-rash I ever had was
one afternoon when Kearney Street in Port Townsend had just been repaved
with Tarmacadam. The crushed rock had set into the tar enough so that it
was immobile, but it was still mostly exposed, with fresh, sharp edges.
I was on my way to my bank. Gale came along in her car, and came alongside
me to talk. We were moving along slowly, side by side. I leaned my hand
against her car as we rode along, supporting my weight and getting a free
ride. &quot;Let's talk at the bank,&quot; I suggested. She agreed and pulled
away. My hand went with her, and I laid my elbow onto the fresh, sharp
rock, followed by the momentum of my 150 pound corpse and ten pound chrome-moly
Bridgestone. Gale didn't notice. At the bank, she was horrified at my ribboned
flesh. The teller graciously allowed me to use the bathroom to clean up.
&quot;Merely a flesh wound&quot; I quipped in my best Monty Python voice,
and went off to clean the blood and tar from my ar-m. </p>

<p>The most unusual rashing I ever gave my arm was unrelated to body-ground
contact. I was working for Tom's, opening up the meat counter at Aldrich's
second retail outlet downtown. Donning elbow-length yellow neoprene gloves,
I went to work on a newly-purchased used rotisserie with spray-on oven
cleaner. I was well into the job when I felt a tingling on my arm, and
noticed that some of the foamy goop had worked its way past the glove onto
my arm. I walked to the sink in back to clean it off. I took a paper towel,
and wiped at the foam. Along with the foam came a thick white paste. As
I worked to wipe more and more of this paste off, I realized that what
I was removing was dissolved skin. The next day, the area was painfully
scabbed. </p>

<p><a name="60"></a>[60] I have carried my stress in different parts of
my body at different times. Before I developed this predisposition to intestinal
cramps, I had a problem with migraine headaches. I was with Gabrielle at
the time. My headaches would begin with a cloudiness in my vision - not
spots, but a difficulty to see that I would have difficulty describing.
Then the headache would come over me like a fog, accompanied by nausea
and depression. I would become unable to become motivated to do anything.
These headaches were profoundly emotional, bringing apathy and despair.
They would typically last about two days. When I was in elementary school,
I would alternate headaches and stomachaches. The headaches were sinus,
and extremely painful. I used to generalize that I had headaches on sunny
days, and stomachaches on cloudy days. Work with a child therapist cleared
up these symptoms which, along with a urinary incontinence problem, showed
very poor social adjustment. I have often said that my therapist saved
my life by introducing me to the tape recorder. As for my migraines, aspirin
never worked 'nor any of its substitutes. It was Gabrielle who finally
found the cure. She was extremely sensitive. Once, during one of my headaches,
she laid her hands on me and pronounced that my kidneys were blocked. She
had just gotten over a urinary infection herself, and she gave me some
tea that she had been drinking that contained Yarrow and Uva Ursi. My headache
disappeared within minutes. To this day, an infusion of Uva Ursi will end
my headaches when nothing else will. </p>

<p><a name="61"></a>[61] Key City Players, Port Townsend, November, 1983.
Bob Reeves directed the play, and the auditions were my first meeting with
him. The cast also included Holly Redell (Mommy), Malcolm Cochrane (Daddy),
Linda Sexton (Grandma) and Sandra Baughman (Mrs. Barker). </p>

<p><a name="62"></a>[62] Her boss, Bonita Flagg, was someone I knew from
Children's Workshop Theater, my second theatrical association in Port Townsend.
After Rachel and I became involved, I used to visit her at work and bring
her lunch, which we would eat in the back of my truck in the parking lot.
Bonita was a lesbian, and used to joke that I was Rachel's girlfriend.
She said that this kept her from feeling jealous. </p>

<p><a name="63"></a>[63] It started with a dare - I had told her how difficult
it was to get up for work in the morning. She would have her coffee there
at the market every morning, and challenged me to get up early enough to
meet her there. It turned into a daily date. She was nonplused on Valentine's
day when I brought her roses. She later told me that it confused her because
she had no idea that I thought of her as anything but a friend. Gabrielle
was at her house later and complimented her on the roses. </p>

<p><a name="64"></a>[64] I never really grasped the emotional significance
of Christmas, and having been raised in the Christian tradition, had no
connection to Chanukah. Gabrielle and I celebrated instead the pagan holiday
centered around the winter Solstice. Instead of saying &quot;Merry Christmas&quot;
or &quot;Happy Chanukah,&quot; we would say &quot;Cozy Solstice.&quot;
</p>

<p><a name="66"></a>[66] After Rachel and I had slept together, she told
me that Wendy was moving to Seattle. &quot;I know you're sweet on her,&quot;
she told me, &quot;but if you touch her, I'll cut your balls off.&quot;
This became an ongoing problem. </p>

<p><a name="67"></a>[67] Gabrielle and I slept in separate rooms. As our
relationship progressed, she became increasingly unable to sleep with me
in the bed. We would cuddle up together, and just about the time I was
dropping off, she would elbow me in the ribs and order me upstairs. My
room had two sections: a downstairs room, and an attic loft that was accessed
by a ladder. I had gutted the attic and finished it myself, and had neither
the expertise nor the money to put in dormers or skylights. This made it
a dark nest, even during the day. </p>

<p><a name="68"></a>[68] I had put an ad in the paper about the time that
Kari started work at the grocery. When I met her, my first thought was
that she was the person to rent my room. However, I wrote the thought off,
too embarrassed to ask her. However, she was the first person to respond
to the ad. </p>

<p><a name="69"></a>[69] This was for Children's Workshop Theater, Port
Townsend, in May, 1984. </p>

<p><a name="70"></a>[70] It bothers me when I see stereotypes like this
reflected in reality. It actually causes me emotional pain. In Los Angeles,
I noticed that the few black kids I knew were nice. The bullies were always
spoiled rich white kids. I considered the stereotype of blacks as dangerous
hostile criminals a horrible injustice. However, not long before I left
Los Angeles, I was mugged by two black boys. At the time, and to this day,
I am outraged that this event fit the stereotype that made all whites in
West Los Angeles frightened of blacks. The sight of the stereotypical television
pimp shepherding his girls through the exam produced similar emotions.
</p>

<p><a name="71"></a>[71] The massage techniques I use are more related
to structural integration and energy flow, both of which occur deeper than
the skin and superficial muscles, on which concentrate the Swedish techniques.
The most powerful set of techniques I have come into contact with are those
of CranioSacral Therapy, a modality developed by John Upledger, DO. It
recognizes the existence of a hydrostatic system within the Dura Mater,
which generates a flexion and extension of the musculoskeletal system as
cerebrospinal fluid is created and absorbed within this membrane. By palpating
and manipulating this system, it is possible to have a profound effect
on the entire body using only gentle, noninvasive touch. </p>

<p><a name="72"></a>[72] My mother reported that the psychology board did
much the same when she tested for her Washington license. </p>

<p><a name="73"></a>[73] Lewis Hyde's book'7he Gift&quot; speaks to the
problem of mixing commerce with art. He talks about the existence of two
economies, one of money and on of gifts, which are not compatible. </p>

<p><a name="74"></a>[74] Port Townsend was at that time a place where people
with little or no money could survive in an alternative lifestyle based
on barter of services. The problem, economically, with the Quincy Street,
and with alternative acoustic music then and now, is that it is the alternative
crowd that appreciates those forms of expression. This being the crowd
that deals outside of commerce, there can be little or no monetary exchange.
The section of society that has money, and prefers to deal with commerce,
does not appreciate this artistic form, and therefore does not support
it. </p>

<H1>Current Projects.</H1> 
<P><I>An overview of some of the research projects I'm currently undertaking
for Foresight.</I> </P> 
<H2>Internet access tools for the sight-impaired.</H2> 
<P><B>Problem: </B>The World-Wide-Web is an incredible source of information
which I believe should be available to everybody. For many years, blind and
sight-impaired users have accessed the Internet using text-based browsers and
text-to-speech synthesizers. These tools cannot communicate all of the
information contained on a traditional printed page, because much of the
information is contained in &quot;spatial&quot; information; in the typography
and the physical arrangement of information on the printed page. The www has
rapidly evolved into a &quot;speech-hostile&quot; environment as more and more
sites are filled with graphics which have no meaning in a text-based world.</P> 
<P><B>Solution:</B> We are working to develop a speech-friendly interface for
non-sighted computer users that allows them to access the educational and
scientific resources on the web, without limiting them to sites specifically
designed for the purpose. This involves applying tools that take the &quot;code&quot;
that comes off the www and re-interpreting it as it comes in. The goal is to
replace the &quot;meaningless junk&quot; and speech-hostile formatting with
meaningful and useful text.</P> 
<H2>Simplified hydrology model for understanding the causes of flooding.</H2> 
<P><B>Problem: </B>To teach the basics of science literacy and the skills of
mathematical modeling to high-school students. </P> 
<P><B>Solution:</B> Develop a mathematical model of the complex system of
hydrologic factors that lead to flooding. Develop a way to communicate how the
model works, a piece-at-a time and then how all of its parts work together. Make
the entire model suitable for use in a high school science classroom.</P> 
<H2>Commercialization of Ultra-High-Resolution LCD's and other fascinating
technology.</H2> 
<P><B>Problem: </B>A great deal of federally funded R&amp;D is invested in
projects and programs with expressly military applications. Foresight is
involved in numerous &quot;swords to plowshares&quot; commercialization
projects. Our unique expertise involves identifying commercial sector market
niches for some of these proprietary technologies. One of the more exciting
recent projects has been identifying commercialization opportunities for
ultra-high-resolution LCD displays which can put all the text on this page (and
more) onto a screen smaller than the crystal on your wrist-watch.</P> 
<H2>&quot;Smart&quot; automated web search.</H2> 
<P><B>Problem: </B>The www is expanding at incredible speed.<B> </B>The
principle obstacles to finding what you are looking for on the www are &quot;dead&quot;
content, &quot;obsolete&quot; links, and poorly indexed collections of junk.</P>
<P><B>Solution: </B>We are one of several companies developing applications
based on &quot;intelligent agent&quot; browsers, where a software agent, armed
with user-defined parameters, finds and downloads web sites automatically. The
most recent implementation of this technology allows me to identify &quot;live&quot;
sites with &quot;relevant&quot; content and then download the sites to my
hard-drive, while I do something else. When I have time, I can then access the
information at hard-drive speed. </P>

The Bite / The Venom

<H1>The Bite / The Venom</H1><BR>


<font size = +2>R</font>attlesnake bites seem to be perceived, at least by the general public, as a largely fatal proposition.  Actually, while the rattlesnake is a <I>potentially</I> deadly animal, statistics show that only about 3% of rattlesnake bites are fatal, these cases generally involving either A) multiple bites, B) small children, elderly or sickly individuals with frail health, or C) the extremely rare instance where a rattlesnake fang happens to strike and inject venom directly into a vein (you are far more likely to be struck by lightning).  A good percentage of these bites occur when someone is intentionally handling a rattlesnake.<BR>
<BR><font size = +2>T</font>here are several rattlers, principally the South American variety, which are far more dangerous than their North American cousins, simply because of the type of venom they produce.  Snake venom in general falls into two categories: <I>hemolytic</I> and <I>neurotoxic</I>.  Hemolytic venoms have the particularly gruesome effect of breaking down the flesh.  The blood vessels exposed to the venom lose their ability to contain the blood, the clotting effect is suppressed, and the flesh in the area fills with fluid and dies.  In the case of a rattlesnake biting prey, this serves to begin and hasten the digestive process, and is similar in effect to the venom produced by spiders.  Hemolytic venom also has the uncanny ability to suppress the immune response to bacterial infection.  Thus, the bacteria present on a rattlesnake's teeth can multiply unchecked, further speeding the breakdown process.  Victims of hemolytic snake bite die infrequently, but limb loss is a very real danger.
<BR><BR><font size = +2>N</font>eurotoxic rattlesnake venoms are similar to those produced by the Elapid family (cobras and coral snakes, for example).  These venoms directly affect the brain and spinal ganglia, causing paralysis first of the voluntary musculature, and then respiration.  The bite victim dies from asphyxia.  North American rattlesnake venoms are largely hemolytic, although some species produce venoms with a combination of hemolytic and neurotoxic qualities.  The South American rattlesnake <I>C. durissus terrificus</I> and its cousins, on the other hand, produce a principally neurotoxic venom, and are therefore far more life-threatening.
<BR><BR><font size = +2>A</font>nother factor that contributes to the survivability of rattlesnake bites is the fact that in many cases little or no venom is injected, even though there may be full fang penetration.  In other cases, a fang does not fully pierce the skin, or the venom injection is mistimed and winds up on the skin's surface or on/in the clothing rather than under the skin where it is effective.
<BR><BR><font size = +2>T</font>here are quite a few ideas out there about how to cure a rattlesnake bite.  You will even find a link below advocating the use of DC electric shock!  The authorities seem to agree on the following:<BR>
<UL><L1><UL><L1>Suction on the bite may help if practiced immediately, and certainly can't hurt (venom accidentally swallowed is easily digested)<BR></L1>
<L1>Do not cut or incise the bite, as it only increases tissue damage and hemmorhage<BR>
<L1>Do not drink alcohol<BR>
<L1>Keep the body of the snake, if at all possible, and bring it to the hospital for identification (antivenin is made for the bites of particular snakes.  An identification is crucial if the proper antivenin is to be procured)
<L1>Get medical attention immediately</UL></L1></UL>

<I><B>****Four stars</I></B><BR>
This animal conservation museum uses artifacts, memorabilia and the world's largest collection of different live rattlesnake species on public display to reveal the hundreds of ways that rattlesnakes and other "less desirable" animals have influenced our lives. Species from North, Central and South America are presented in beautifully recreated habitats. Myths are explored, phobias cured and mysteries revealed at this must-see SW museum. $2 adults, $1 under 16.  This is one of my favorite places to visit when I'm in Albuquerque - go say hi to "Moe" the mojave rattler <I>C. scutulatus</I>.  He's the one with the little brass tag on his cage saying that I send money every year to support him.  Bob tells me he's growing like crazy this year.

Home to more than 1,100 wild animals from throughout the world; spacious naturalistic exhibits, lush landscaping and a wonderful bandshell for evening concerts. Adults $4.25, children $2.25, seniors $2.25. Open year round.   The reptile house is extensive, and they post their feeding times so it's possible to catch the spectacle, or avoid it, depending on your proclivities.  Notable in this collection are the Aruba Island rattlesnakes, which the zoo has had good luck breeding.  On my last visit in October '94, they were mating.

Laurence Klauber was the consulting curator  of reptiles at the San Diego Zoo for many 
years, and their collection gained an enormous reputation.  
<P>ParisAnne and I visited the zoo in April of 1996 (for pictures, click on the link above).
  I, of course, made a beeline to the Klauber - Shaw reptile house.  
<P>I had mixed reactions.  On the one hand, the animals were in excellent condition (the San Diego
Zoo generally excels in care and health maintenance of the animals).  Some of the
rattlesnakes there are in excess of 20 years old, and appear to be in robust health.  The
color of all the specimens was excellent (the emerald boas and the green mamba, for example,
were both brightly colored, whereas in other zoos, I have seen both species lose their
green coloration, probably because of a diet that differs from their wild diet).
<P>On the other hand, labeling of the enclosures was poor, and what was there was
confusing.  One cage had several different species of rattlesnakes together, with a
sign saying simply "rattlesnakes."  Other areas had interesting information about venom
and injection systems, but with nothing linking the information to the snakes in the
exhibit.  A pair of xanthic (yellow color morph) individuals of <I><A HREF = "http://www.seeport.com/staff/dallett/kshaw3.gif">C. durissus terrificus</A></I>
were nicely displayed, but with no explanation of their color, probably leading viewers
to believe that this is their normal coloration in the wild.

<B><I>No rating</I></B><BR>
Per the <A HREF = "http://www.syspac.com/~varney/desert.html">Desert Serpents Reptiles homepage</A>, this is an exhibit that currently contains many specimens of native Southwestern rattlesnakes.  The curator is Tom Marcelino, president of the Venomous Snake Society, who plans to expand the exhibit to include South American rattlesnakes, as well as other North American varieties.  I haven't been there, but according to my sources, Tom is struggling with a shoestring budget and a tiny building, and will likely be limited to native Arizona species for the foreseeable future.

Several specimens displayed without much panache. 
 The desert ecosystem is well represented, but I didn't find the exhibits worth what
 I recall as being a rather steep admission price.

discussion of the museum, which can be found on the "<A HREF = "Q&A.htm#22">Ask Nick</A>" page

<P><Font size = 5>T</font>he rattlesnake is dressed for the table by first removing the
head and rattles.  Then, using a sharp knife or scissors, 
you cut through the belly scutes from neck to tail.  
The skin may then be easily pulled off the body, leaving the muscled body and
the entrails, which are easily removed by pulling away the protective membrane with
the fingers.  The meat is then thoroughly rinsed in cold water and chilled.
<P>The meat of the rattlesnake is similar to a savory game bird, and comes easily off
of the ribs once cooked.  Below are some of the recipes I've come across.

<H2>Grilled Rattlesnake Dijon</H2>
<UL><I>- I learned to cook meat while working in a Cajun-oriented meat market.  
My boss, a good old boy from Slidell, Louisiana liked to treat steaks, roasts, and other grilled or roasted meats with 
a dry marinade of Dijon mustard and spices, a technique he referred to as "putting a
rub on."  The one time I ate rattlesnake, it was a snake I caught myself in Central
California.  I put a rub on it and grilled it over a gas flame.  The spices may be
altered to suit your personal taste, or substitute your own favorite seasoned salt.</I></UL>
<P><B>Ingredients:</B>
<UL><UL>
-------------<BR>
1 Medium - Large Rattlesnake, cleaned and cut into 1 foot lengths<BR>
3 Tbsp Dijon Mustard<BR>
1 Tsp salt<BR>
1/4 Tsp black pepper<BR>
1/4 Tsp white pepper<BR>
1/4 Tsp Onion Powder<BR>
1/8 Tsp Celery Powder<BR>
1/8 Tsp Ground Coriander<BR>
1/4 Tsp Cayenne pepper <I>(optional)</I><BR>
--------------<BR>
</UL></UL>
<P><B> Instructions:</B>
<P>Combine the dry spices in a cup and mix well.  Liberally sprinkle meat with the spice
mixture.  Once the meat is well coated, rub thoroughly with Dijon until the meat is
slathered with it.  Wrap and set aside to marinate for up to one hour.  Grill over a hot 
flame for 10-15 minutes or until cooked through.

<H2>Breaded and Fried Rattlesnake</H2>
<UL><I>- Here are two versions of this recipe taken from postcards.
  I haven't tried either.  You may substitute your own family's fried chicken batter
for the batters mentioned here, or use a commercial mixture such as "Shake 'n Bake."  Try
a Tempura batter for oriental-style rattlesnake!</I></UL>

<P><B>Version 1</B>
<P>Skin snake and cut into 3" and 4" pieces.  Roll in mixture of flour, corn meal,
milk, and egg.  Salt and pepper.  Deep fry in hot oil.  Serve hot.
<P><B>Version 2</B>
<P>Skin the rattlesnake by cutting through its hide and peeling it back
 until meat is bare.  Cut into small pieces.  Dip meat into a mixture of egg and milk
and then roll in flour seasoned with salt and pepper.  Saute in hot oil until
golden brown on all sides.  Delicious with Salsa!

<H1>Rattlesnake bite to a dog</H1>
<B><I>Contributed by Tiffany Hoss, 5/28/96</B></I>
 <P>My dog Samantha and I were hiking in Red
Rock Canyon, Topanga, CA.  We came around a corner and Samantha stepped on
the baby rattler.  Right away she was shocklike.  Her head went down, she
became dazed, her tail went between her legs.  I had to pull her away from
the baby because he was very aggressive.  In fact I've seen alot of snakes
on the trails but never one that has been so mean.  Usually when they see
you they take off, but this baby wanted to attack again.

<P>I figured out that she was bit in the foot because she started limping
right away.  When I got her away from the snake I looked at her foot.  The
wound was bleeding and the foot beginning to swell.  The bite marks were
pretty small.  I then realized that she was in serious danger.  Sami is a
shepard/coyote mix and weighs 46 pounds.  Believe it or not, I picked her
up and ran 3 miles to my car.  It's amazing what your body can do when the
adrenaline is flowing.

<P>I got to the hospital about an hour after the bite.  By then she was in deep 
shock and very lethargic.  She seemed to be in a lot of pain.  
The doctor took her into the trauma room and gave her
benadryl and fluids.  After she was stabilized, the doctor came and spoke
to me.  They had to ask permission to give the antivenin.  Apparently the
dog could have a violent reaction to the antivenin and also it is
expensive.  Of course the cost was the least of my wories.  They take an
hour to give the antivenin by an IV.  After she was stable I was allowed to
see her.  She was on an IV and her foot was black and blue and very
swollen, but otherwise she was in good spirits.

<P>She remained in the hospital for 2 days and was given 2 kinds of
antibiotics and I constantly had to clean her wound.  The bite has left a
1/8 inch scar on her foot, but otherwise she is back to normal.  It took
her about 2 weeks for her to get back to normal.

<P>[<I><B>Note:</B>  Baby rattlesnakes are consistently reported as being more aggressive than
adults, and are thought to have a more potent venom.  Both of these attributes would
make them better prepared to survive to adulthood. Tiffany also said that she was told by her vet that it would be extremely
dangerous for Samantha to have a second injection of antivenin in future, as there
was a progressively larger chance of anaphylactic (allergic) reaction with further
doses of the serum.</I>]

<Body bgcolor = "FFFFFFFFFFFF">

<B><I>Trivia - Vocabulary - Miscellany</B></I><BR><BR> <BR>
<img src = "rattle.gif"> <Font size = +2>F</Font>ear of snakes is called <I>Ophidiophobia</I><BR><BR>
<img src = "rattle.gif"> <Font size = +2>I</font>t is never safe to pick up a rattlesnake!  They are wonderful creatures to observe and to study, but they are not pets.  They do not deserve the hatred and fear that they are often accorded. They do deserve your respect.
<BR><BR><img src = "rattle.gif"><Font size = +2>B</Font>aby Rattlesnakes are formed within eggs, but the eggs hatch while still within the female.  The young are born live.  Thus the rattlesnake is both <I>oviparous</I> (egg-bearing) and <I>viviparous</I> (live-bearing).  This quality is called <I>ovoviviparity</I>
<BR><BR><img src = "rattle.gif"><Font size = +2>R</Font>attlesnakes have one of the most evolved venom-injection methods of any venomous creature.  The fangs lie flat against the roof of the mouth, and fold out for use.  A snake with this type of dentition is referred to as a <I>solenoglyph.</I>
<BR><BR><img src = "rattle.gif"><Font size = +2>A</Font> rattlesnake is born with a button on the end of its tail.  With its first shedding, it gains its first rattle segment, and it gains a new one each time it sheds.  Because a snake can shed its skin several times a year at a rate that is different for each individual, and because rattle segments frequently break off, there is no correlation between the number of rattles and a snake's age.
<BR><BR><img src = "rattle.gif"><Font size = +2>R</Font>attlesnakes in captivity have developed rattles with as many as thirteen segments
<BR><BR><img src = "rattle.gif"><Font size = +2>T</Font>he rattle of a rattlesnake doesn't sound much like a rattle.  It sounds more like frying bacon!  Here is an example:
<L1><A HREF ="http://info.fuw.edu.pl/multimedia/sounds.animals/rattlesnake.au">Rattlesnake sound</A></L1></UL></UL>
<BR><img src = "rattle.gif"><Font size = +2>T</Font>he striking range of a large (6') adult rattlesnake is approximately 3' - half the length of its body.  A rattlesnake cannot launch itself into the air!  A rattlesnake has enough energy for two or three strikes, but then must rest, and can strike only feebly.  The strike and the venom evolved for hunting purposes, and are only used in self-defense as a last resort.  First, the snake will put up a fearsome display (the coil, the rattle), and if possible, try to escape.
<BR><BR><img src = "rattle.gif"><Font size = +2>W</Font>hen in defense posture, a rattlesnake's tongue extends fully, and flaps up and down at a rate of about twice per second.
<BR><BR><img src = "rattle.gif"><Font size = +2>L</Font>ike other snakes, a rattlesnake uses its tongue to smell.  The tongue is composed of two slender cylinders which part at the tip (hence the forked appearance), which are contained in a sheath in the floor of the mouth.  They flick in and out of the mouth quickly, bringing samples of the outside air and its smells to a special organ, called <I>Jacobsen's organ</I>, which relays information to the brain about smells in the environment.  Rattlesnakes are also members of the <B>Pit viper</B> subfamily, possessing special organs, called pit organs, located on either side of the snout.  These organs are heat-sensitive, and allow the snake to track, locate, and capture its prey in total darkness.
<BR><BR><img src = "rattle.gif"><Font size = +2>R</Font>attlesnakes are extremely curious about the world around them.  Once, while I was hunting sidewinders to photograph in Eastern California, I was out walking in the desert at night.  I was following my footprints from the previous night's junket, and I came across a footprint that told an amazing story.  A snake track led right up to the print, where the snake had carefully investigated my scent, and (probably)the lingering warmth from my foot's brief contact with the sand, as evidenced by the sweeping strokes that almost obliterated the print.  The track then continued in a sinuous line away from my footprint.  It gave me a chill to think that, while I was studying them, they were just as carefully studying me! Click <A HREF = "footpr.gif">here</A> to see my photo of the footprint.
<BR><BR><img src = "rattle.gif"><Font size = +2>R</Font>attlesnakes are highly adaptive.  Different species of rattlesnakes can be <I>diurnal </I>(active during the day), <I>nocturnal </I>(active during the night), or <I>crepuscular </I>(active at dawn and/or dusk), depending on the climate, the season, and the needs of the particular species with regards to regulating body warmth, and availablility of prey.

<BR><BR><img src = "rattle.gif"><Font size = +2>A</Font> personal observation:  Being both a <I>crotalophile</I> (rattlesnake lover) and cat lover, I have repeatedly observed the similarities between rattlers and tabby cats.

<BR><BR><img src = "rattle.gif"><Font size = +2>R</Font>attlesnakes cannot, and need not, dig their own dens.  They take over the dens of rodents they prey on.

<UL><L1><UL><L1><B><A HREF = "undtrk.gif">Undulatory:</A></B> The most common and familiar form of snake locomotion, where the body takes a sinuous path as the snake uses rocks, protrusions, piles of dirt, grass or other vegetation to push and pull its way along.</L1>
<BR><L1><B>Accordion:</B> where a slow, steady approach is necessary over a small distance (as in stalking prey), or where there is very little traction, the rattlesnake may form its body into accordion pleats, plant the rear half, pick up and move the front half forward, pick up and move the rear half forward, and repeat this action, much as an inchworm moves, with the exception that the body is pleated horizontally on the ground rather than held vertically in a loop.</L1>
<BR><L1><B>Rectilinear:</B> The snake's belly scutes pull the snake along in a straight line, lifting to get a purchase, then pushing back to propel the body forward.</L1>
<BR><L1><B><A HREF = "sidetrk.gif">Sidewinding:</A></B> Practiced by the desert dweller <I>C. Cerastes</I>, the snake picks up and sets down its body in a looping motion, a method of locomotion well suited to a loose, shifting medium like sand.</L1></UL></L1></UL>
<img src = "rattle.gif"><Font size = +2>M</Font>ale rattlesnakes perform an intriguing dance, which is believed to be a way of establishing dominance for mating and/or territorial purposes (much like the head-butting contests of the horned mammals).  In the dance, the snakes will twine around each other, raise up to full height face to face, and generally look very much as if they are preparing to mate.  Only males participate in this dance.

Introduction - The L.M. Klauber Memorial Rattlesnake Homepage
</Title>
<Body BGcolor = "fffffffff">



<P> <Font size = +3>T</Font>his page is dedicated to L.M. Klauber (b1883, d May 8, 1968) whose massive two-volume work 
"Rattlesnakes - Their Habits, Life Histories, and Influence on Mankind" remains the definitive work on these
 fascinating reptiles.

<P><Font size = +3>I</Font> have undertaken this project because of my own singleminded fascination with this 
particular group of vipers, and because of many fruitless net searches for information.  
The information below comes from Klauber's text, as well as from my own experience with rattlers in the field.



<P><Font size = +3>I</Font> am interested in obtaining more photos of rattlesnakes in action,
 particularly if they are displaying trademark behavior - the obvious example being the male battle dance,
 but also pictures of rattlesnakes mating, swimming, striking, or eating.
  If you have scans of pictures in this category, I would love to have them emailed to me

<H1>Rattlesnakes and Man</H1>
<Font size = +2>R</font>attlesnakes and humans have a troublesome relationship, to say the least.  There's an ongoing struggle between those who see any dangerous and/or venomous animal as a threat (and therefore better off dead), and those who see every species as a vital part of the ecosystem, and therefore worth preserving.<BR><BR>
<Font size = +2>A</font>lso worthy of note is how powerful the rattlesnake is in our collective psyche.  We fear them and avoid them, but we also are fascinated.  We name things after them (Diamondback <I>(TM)</I> bicycles, Sidewinder missles, the Microsoft Sidewinder Joystick <I>(TM)</I> come to mind.)  We name songs after them (e.g. Fleetwood Mac's <I>Rattlesnake Shake</I>).  We have them permanently tattooed on our bodies (mine is a life-sized <I>C. cerastes</I> draped over my right shoulder.)<BR><BR>

<P>Last night we watched a television program about rattlesnakes. I mentioned
that I had heard that you should not handle the rattles of snakes (once
they are dead) because the snake sharpened their fangs on their rattles and
small amounts of poison would leak onto the rattles.

<P>Did I hear right?

<P>I'd appreciate a response as my family acted like I was crazy last night
when I mentioned this.

<UL><UL><P>- Michele, Provo, Ut.</UL></UL>

<P><I>Michele, you fell prey to a tall tale.  Rattlesnakes do not sharpen their fangs - when one set wears out, it is replaced by a new set that grows in behind the old, much like sharks' teeth.  Incidentally, even if there were a small amount of venom on the rattles, it would be unlikely to be harmful unless rubbed in a fresh open wound.  Rattlesnake venom is digestible, and will not harm you if swallowed.<br><UL><UL>- Nick</I></UL></UL>

<P>Re:  my "Rattlesnake Salad" recipe
<P>I have never made this recipe.  I found it in a cookbook I 
got out of the library or from a cooking magazine.  I can't remember 
exactly.  I saved it as a curiosity.  I would be willing to try it if
I ever had access to rattlesnake meat.  But that is extremely 
unlikely.  Have you tried it?  How was it?
<UL><UL><P>- Kate Connally</UL></UL>
<I><P>Kate,
<P>No, I haven't tried your salad.  I <B>Have</B> had grilled rattlesnake (seasoned with dijon mustard, salt, and pepper).  It was very delicious, and not unlike a cornish game hen.</I>

<P>Are there rattlesnakes in Sri Lanka?  I had thought 
them limited to the Western hemisphere, but a brief article in NEW 
SCIENTIST ("A kinder antidote to snakebite," 3 February 1996, p. 18) 
reporting a new antivenin produced by Therapeutic Antibodies of 
Nashville says that "A third new antivenin neutralises bites from a 
variety of Sri Lankan rattlesnake, where conventional antivenin is 
useless."  
<P>  Thanks for a most interesting Website.  If you have any interest in 
post-traumatic stress disorder, my National Center for PTSD Website is

<P><I>Fred,
<P>It's not often a respected science magazine makes an error of this magnitude.  Rattlesnakes are indeed unique to the Americas.
A phone call to Dr. Steve Porter of Therapeutic Antibodies confirmed that the snake in question was the Russel's Viper.
  I have written to the New Scientist editor to correct the error.

<P>I'd like to ask if you know of a copy of Klauber's work for 
something less than a king's ransom.  I bought the abridged version 
and was sadly disappointed.  I only want it for research purposes, and 
not as a collector's volume.  I've seen various copies in the past, 
advertised in SELVA, and the like, but all are in excess of two 
hundred dollars, as I'm sure you are aware, and I can't quite go that 
route.

<P>If out hiking with my dog and it gets bitten what should I do?  Can you 
purchase antivenin? if so, where from?  What do you suggest to take along 
if antivenin is unavailable.
<P><UL><UL>- Daniel Hankins<BR><A HREF = "mailto: dhankins@west.net">dhankins@west.net</A></UL></UL>
<P><I>Daniel,
<P>First, let me say that I am <B>NOT</B> a veterinarian, and that checking with your vet on this question
is your best source of information.  However, I'll make the following observations:
<P>The variety of dog makes a huge difference in the danger from snake bite.  
The larger the dog, the more venom will be required to kill it. 
 The longer and thicker the dog's hair, the less likely the snake will be able to insert a fang. 
 Thus, a St. Bernard could likely shrug off a minor bite, while a chihuahua might have little chance for survival.
<P>There is some evidence that once a dog has been bitten, if it survives, it will then have a partial immunity, and will then be more resistant to the venom. 
 This is true of humans, and also of horses (antivenin has long been produced by injecting horses with small amounts of venom until they develop an immunity. 
 The antibody-bearing serum is then drawn off to use for bite treatment).
<P>Antivenin can only be purchased by a doctor.  Check with your vet to see whether they keep it on hand, and whether they are familiar with its use.

<P>I have been enjoying your page on rattlesnakes. I do have a couple of 
questions.

<P>1. Are you aware of the species Crotalus cascavella? I have it listed in 
a homeopathic textbook as the Brazilian rattlesnake, and I noted that it 
was not included in your list. Does crotalus cascavella have another 
name?

<P>2. Could you share your tattoo design with me? I have been working on a 
crotalus horridus design to be on my left lower back for a while now and 
am interested in seeing how you solved some of the design problems I am 
having.

<P>How can you tell the age of a rattlesnake? I heard that you could by 
counting the number of rattles, but I'm not sure. Also, how often does a 
rattlesnake shed it's skin?
<P><UL><UL>- Chuck Anderson</UL></UL>
<P><I>Chuck,
<P>The last I know of (Klauber again), a way of positively determining the age of a rattlesnake had not been found, but some researchers had discovered 
that it is possible to analyze the growth pattens in the bones of the skull, much like counting tree rings 
(evidence seems to support the supposition that rattlesnakes grow throughout life).  
Estimates based on captive snakes give a life span of 20+ years, with sexual activity beginning at 4-5 years.  
Telling the age of a rattler encountered in the field is, therefore, nearly impossible.  
Provided one knows the species, size can give you perhaps the best indicator.

<P>Rattlers add a rattle segment each time they shed.  Shedding occurs frequently in the first two years of life (up to 3-4 times per year), and then slows down from there.
  Rattlers probably shed at least once per year, adults probably no more than 3 times a year in the wild.  
Captive snakes are a completely different story, as the warmth of their cage may allow year-round activity 
(as zoos become more and more sophisticated, some are beginning to put their animals through natural seasons, so a snake may spend 3-4 months in hibernation and then be gradually warmed in the spring).
  Captive snakes then may shed much more frequently.

<P>Added to all this confusion is the fact that snakes rarely have all their rattles.
  Dragging the rattle through the underbrush causes segments to break and fall away. 
 Again, captive snakes are far more likely to have complete rattles, as they lead a more protected life.
<P><UL><UL>-Nick</UL></UL></I>
<P><I>John Sealy, a researcher in NC, adds:
<P>Recent research allows some fair accuracy in age determination using 
the rattle.  To determine age a few things must be known however.  
Molting rates corelate to active season.  Molting occurs at a fairly 
consistent rate for each month the snake is out of hibernation. 
Molting on average is not particularly corelated to feeding rates.  
So, if a population's active time and molting rates are known then age 
can be determined.  There are some limitations.  For instance the 
rattle of C.h. tapers until about the 10th molt.  After the snake 
reaches terminal size, the rattle segments no longer show taper.  With 
experience we can accurately determine total molts, even if some 
segments are missing.  In other words if the rattle is not complete, 
but is tapered, total rattle segments ie molts can be determined.  
Additionally, if the rattle has no taper the snake has lost at least 
10 segments. Age can only be listed as older than the age of the 
estimate from segments lost and those remaining.  This is only for 
adults.  A snake that has not achieved full size and showing "say" one 
segment is a problem, taper cannot be determined.  However, age can be 
determined here as well.  A researcher has accumulated thousands of 
weight to length measurments of C.h. of known age. It differentiates 
between gravid, non-gravid and males. We constantly test this 
correlation with animals of known age. (those with full rattles in a 
population of known molting rate)  It is very accurate.</I><BR><BR>

<P><I>Jaap,
<P>Nothing of the sort has crossed my desktop, but perhaps some of my readers have heard something.
<P>Rattlesnake venom has been touted as a cure before (Klauber reports that there are some who believe that a
second rattlesnake bite will counteract the effects of the first!  This belief is probably based on the fact that venom is used in
the production of antivenin).  However, I know of no scientific study that has proven or attempted to prove the efficacy of
any venom as a curative agent.
<P>Let me take this opportunity to congratulate you on a wonderful web page on your research.  Anyone who hasn't seen it

Hello, my name is Russell and I would like to ask a question regarding 
the skeleton and its movements regarding the snake. I understand that a 
snake is composed of several vertebrae and along these vertebrae the ribs 
are placed in a degree similar to a humans rib cage. I know that these 
ribs are the reason the scutes of the rattlesnakes can bunch up in 
certain areas and relax in others and thus a rectilinear movement, found 
in all snakes, is achieved and enables the snake to progress foward and 
to even swim. However, my question is more specifically in regards to the 
degree in which the ribs are able to move fowards and backwards as well 
as contract in a direction into the center of the body as well as relax 
or extend outwards. I would like to know perhaps the actual or average 
length or the degree of arc created in each pair of ribs as it moves 
because all bones in a snake are limited in movement. So generally, I 
would like to know the small degree in which the snake moves it one 
isolated set of ribs in all the directions. If you can help me it would 
be greatly appreciated as my resources here at the University of Illinois 
are failing me.
 <UL><UL>
Thank you<BR>

<I>
Russell,
<P>According to Klauber, the ribs do not change position relative to the vertebral column during rectilinear motion.
  The motion is achieved through reciprocating movements between the snake's skin and it's body.
	This is not to say that there is no freedom of movement at the junction between rib and vertebra.
  Snakes breathe much as mammals do, the rib cage expanding and contracting with each breath.
  A large meal will require a certain anount of expansion of the rib cage as well.
	I have no figures for you on exact range of motion. 
 However, I imagine that this data exists for snakes in general, and that figures for other snake families would be similar.
  You might look for a text on ophidian anatomy.<BR>

<P>Where are rattlesnakes distributed in British Columbia Canada? Both in 
what regions and how are they distributed along an elevational gradient?
<UL><UL>
	-Shade Teague<BR>
</UL></UL>

<P><I>Shade,
<P>From what I can glean, it appears that there are only four species that occur in Canada, and these are in the southern portion, to wit:
<P>Crotalus viridus oreganus is found in Southern BC.  According to Klauber, the distribution is within a triangle formed by Lilloooet-Shushwap Lake-Osoyoos, and east along the US border to Christina lake.
<P>Crotalus viridus viridus is found in Southwestern Sasketchawan (South of the South Sasketchawan river and West of longitude 107 degrees, 30 minutes W), and Southeastern Alberta  (South of the red deer river and East of longitude 113 degrees W)
<P>Crotalus horridus horridus was found several decades ago on the shore of Lake Erie, but at the time was scarce, and is probably extinct in that area now.
<P>Sistrurus catenatus catenatus has been found in Southern Ontario, on the shores of Georgian bay, Lake Huron, and Lake Erie.  Also on the Prince Edward Peninsula in Lake Ontario.
<P>As far north as Canada, it is likely that the snakes will be found mostly at lower elevations.  Snakes are temperature-sensitive, and below a certain temperature, they cannot function at all (optimum temperature for most species of Rattlesnake is 75-85 degrees fahrenheit).  It is doubtful that you would encounter any below 50 degrees.  I'm not sure how this correlates with altitude in your neck of the great white north, but suffice to say that rattlesnakes are uncommon in Canada at all, and the greater the elevation, the lower the temperature, and thus the lower the chance of encountering snakes.

<P>Phil,
<P>When I was doing the initial research on rattlesnake-related web pages, I found a whole usenet discussion on this subject.  Even though I'm both a musician and a crotalophile, I  saw this as peripheral to my purpose, so I didn't bookmark any of it.  You might try searching using Lycos for "rattlesnake."  As I recall, it was either Lycos or Webcrawler who returned that thread.  Actually, if you have been searching for this information for 6 months or more, it might have been your usenet postings I was reading...

Off the top of my head, I would suggest folklore societies rather than either music or rattlesnake resources.  For example, the Northwest Folklife Festival staff has a number of people who probably could put you on the correct trail.  (206) 684-7300.

My father-in-law found a rattler on his ranch 10 miles east of Ensenada 
in Mexico, up in the hills, and is concerned since his grandkids will be 
visiting soon.  

<P>His Mexican friend called it "cascabel serpiente", and he's not sure if 
that just literally means "rattlesnake" or is a specific type.  The 
snake appeared to have whitish rings, recognizable diamonds and rattles. 
 It was about 3-4 feet long and lived at 1000'-1500' elevation.

<P>The question is, how dangerous is this type of snake and its venom?
How can he minimize risk of snakes to 3 rambunctions 5 to 8 year olds 
who like to explore:  avoiding certain terrain, clearing brush, certain 
times of day, etc.

<P>There is a shaded ravine in the center of the property -- would they be 
more or less likely to be there?

<P>Are there any animals or pets that would encourage the snakes to live 
elsewhere?  What action should be taken in case of snakebite, for kids 
or adults?  Are anti-venom injections available?

<P>Thanks in advance.
<UL><UL>-Mark Saltveit<BR>
<A HREF = "mailto: msalt@well.com">msalt@well.com</A>
</UL></UL>
<P><I>Mark,

<P>Cascabel is Spanish for "little bell", or rattle, and serpiente is Spanish for "snake"  hence it means literally "rattle snake."  
<P>Any rattlesnake is dangerous, and the kids should be warned about them and told how to deal with them - ie if they hear the rattle, they should stand still until they see where the snake is, and then slowly back away from it.
<P>The shaded ravine is probably where they (the snakes) hang out if it's hot out.
<P>The kids should be told to make lots of noise with their feet when they move through the brush, and to move slowly.  This will give the snakes ample warning and time to clear out.  It's a bad idea for them to run full-tilt through the brush.
<P>I imagine they have a somewhat competent hospital down there, which should be well-stocked with antivenin, since rattlers are common in most parts of Mexico.  The good news is that many rattlesnake bites do not involve the injection of venom.  The bad news is that kids, being small, are more susceptible to the venom than adults.
<P>In short, reasonable precautions should be sufficint to keep them safe, and the most important thing to do is to educate them about what to do it they see a rattlesnake:  watch, don't touch, and move away slowly.

Are all rattlesnakes shiny?  All the snakes in your pictures seem to have very shiny, 
almost oily-looking, skins.  I saw a dull gray snake with a diamond pattern, and was 
wondering if it was a rattlesnake.  I didn't see any rattles, and it was not 
aggressive.  I didn't get close to it, but my horse walked right up to it and sniffed 
it.  It just stayed very still until she left.  Sorry I couldn't get a picture to 
send you, but it moved off into the brush soon thereafter.
<P><UL><UL>
Melissa</UL></UL>

<P><I> Melissa,

<P>No rattlesnakes are shiny!  Rattlesnakes have keeled scales, 
which means they are rough and do not reflect light back directly. 
 In the right light, they can appear somewhat glossy, but in real life they are 
usually dull.  The snake you saw could have been a rattlesnake, but could also have 
been a bullsnake (or gopher snake - pituophis melanoleucis), which are very similar.

<P>Were there alternating black and white rings around its tail? 
 Many rattlesnakes have these rings, while gopher snakes do not.

<P>Also, where do you live, and what sort of terrain and elevation were you in when
 you saw the snake?  What was the temperature?  While rattlesnakes are not usually 
aggressive, they are more active and alert when warm, but if it was morning or a cold
 day, it could have been cold and sluggish.  Or, it could have eaten recently and felt
 full :-)  I'm sure you know the feeling...

<P>Dear Nick:

<P>I am a 2nd-grader at Countryside School in Champaign, Illinois.  I am  
doing a short paper on rattlesnake bites and how to cure them in the  
"old days" on the Oregon Trail.  Can you tell me what kind of methods  
they used to cure rattlesnake bites at that time?

<P>Thank you,
<UL><UL>
<P>Jessica
</UL></UL>
<P><I>Jessica - 

	
	<P>In frontier times, there were all sorts of crazy ideas about how to cure 
rattlesnake bite.  Sometimes, people drank lots of alcohol, which actually made things
 worse.  Sometimes, they slashed big cuts over the bites so that the blood would drain 
out faster and take the venom with it.  This would be helped along by somebody sucking
 out the venom.  Some people even believed that a second rattlesnake bite would cure 
the first!  Other treatments included putting things over the bite, including ammonia,
 tobacco juice, salt, iodine, or mud.  Of all these methods, the only one that is still
 recommended today is suction on the wound (though without slashing new cuts), which,
 if applied immediately, might be effective sometimes at removing a small amount of the 
venom.

	<P>Antivenins for rattlesnake venom began to be developed in the mid 
- 1920's, so they wouldn't have been available yet

	<P>In response to your other question, yes - you may print out or copy 
anything on my page, as long as you give me credit for the information (in other words,
 you have to tell people where you got the information).

<P>Is there anyway to keep rattlesnakes away?  Within one week we have found 
two rattlesnakes next to our house.  We live next to thick brush and 
there are some rock formation.  But we have kept the brush trimmed within 
20 feet of our home.  Also, I'm located in the San Diego,CA area and have 
seen rattlesnakes all my life.  Growing up I was told that King snakes 
and gopher snakes keep rattlesnakes away. Is this true? 

<P><UL><UL>-Gloria</UL></UL>

<P><I>Gloria,
<P>General rule of thumb for any wild animal is that they will stay away if there is nothing to attract them.  If they have food, water, shelter, or a good basking spot, then they will come around.  Limit their access to water, and reduce your rodent population, and they will probably leave...

<P>King snakes eat, among other things, rattlesnakes.  They also eat the rodents.  So, king snakes would probably help keep the population down a bit by doing both things.  But, it would be many hours work to catch them, and many dollars to buy them, so I'd start by trying to limit the access to food and water.  If you don't, you can clear out as many as you like, and more will come to fill the niche.

 <P>I am curious as to whether or not you have any sources of info on efforts to 
classify the Canebrake as a separate subspecies. I have a two year old 
specimen, which basing on color pattern alone it is definitly distinct from 
northern subspecies I have encountered in Pennsylvania. I want to find out if 
color markings alone were the basis for the subspecies classification or if 
there were other differences noted

<P>According to Klauber, horridus horridus has 23 dorsal scale rows, with an indistinct postocular dark stripe and
 a low degree of contrast between the pattern and body color.  Horridus atricaudatus has generally 25 dorsal scale rows,
 with a distinct dark postocular stripe and sharp contrast between body color and pattern.  Whether this information has 
been found to be false since his writing, I don't know...

<P>
I just read the information in your LMK Memorial page.  You mentioned a 
"Tucson Desert Museum".  In the decades I've lived here in Tucson, I 
haven't discovered a place by this name.  Did you mean the Arizona-Sonora 
Desert Museum, about 20 miles west of Tucson?  It does sort of fit your 
description.
<P>They do have a good collection, but they don't have the best display of that
collection.  They also have some top-notch herp people on their staff, but
the politics of running a museum restrict what they (the herp people) can
do.  I used to do volunteer work for the museum, but gave it up because the
politics disgusted me.  At the time I left, they had the only captive
breeding population of San Esteban Island Chuckwallas.  They had a large,
natural looking enclosure for them, a curator who wanted to run a major
study on all aspects of territoriallity, courtship, and breeding, and a crew
of volunteers to help with the study.  A consultant on public zoo displays
walked through the museum, and told the board of directors that "it didn't
look good" to have the study animals on display.  Zip.  The study ended
until the curator was able to come up with some other off-exhibit facilities.  

<P>There has been talk of them building another reptile display building, but I
don't think that's in the immediate future.  Meanwhile, (in agreement with a
portion of your description) the already high entry fees keep going up,
again based on what they are told by their zoo display consultant.

<P>Changing topics slightly - I would suspect, from the nature of your
homepage, that you keep or work with rattlesnakes.  If so, what sort of work
do you do with them?

<P><UL><UL>Bill</UL></UL>

<P><I>Bill,

<P>Thank you for the correction - I am talking about the ASDM.  
I looked and looked for the information I used to have about it, and couldn't find it, 
so I relied on my (faulty) memory.  I have also since had correspondence from a herper
 who thought it was one of the two the best reptile collections he's seen.  If I'm down 
your way again, I'll have to give it another try.  Maybe I hit it on a bad day...
<P>It is truly a sad thing when politics dictate funding and display.  Unfortunately, 
it is something that reseach, education, and the arts share - the need to be subsidized,
 which means the need to ask for handouts, which means politics - the machine that
 decides distribution of funds - gets involved.  
(see <A HREF = "http://www.seeport.com/staff/dallett/me13.htm" target = "_top">http://www.seeport.com/staff/dallett/me13.htm</A>)

<P>We just returned from a vacation in So. Cal., and we went to the San Diego Zoo,
 which had very well cared-for rattlers, but with very little labeling, so it was
 difficult to learn anything from the displays.  One of the enclosures was labeled 
simply "rattlesnakes."  Inside were several different species...

<P>As for work, I am an animal control officer, but in an area where there are no
 poisonous snakes (Washington's Olympic Peninsula).  So, I am mostly an armchair herper.
  On our trip, we did get to help a very pretty young c. ruber across the road in the 
Anza Borreo desert.  Several cars stopped while we were at it, and it became an 
opportunity to educate!   I grew up in Southern Cal., and was always warned away from 
them, so I suppose I'm rebelling against that fear in my adulthood (?).

<P><I> Michael,
<P>If a rattlesnake trained for months, it could probably reach the blinding speed of about 3 miles per hour.  In other words,
 you could "outrun" it by walking your normal pace.

<P>Rattlesnakes do not want to bite humans - they go out of their way to avoid it - so there is no reason they would be 
chasing you in the first place...

the field and field dressing them, strictly for their meat? Wait, also is 
this poaching...? Thank you.
<P><UL><UL>-No name given</UL></UL>

<I><P>Dressing a snake for food is simple - skin the snake, and remove the head.  The
entrails come neatly out of the body cavity, leaving the meat, which should be cooked
and eaten off the bones.
<P>Personally,  I don't feel that rattlers should be taken from the wild for food.
 While rattlesnakes are considered a nuisance in many places, they are wildlife, and as such are
protected in many places.  At least one species - the New Mexican ridgenosed rattler -
is on the Endangered Species List.
<P>Check with your State Department of Fish and Wildlife about whether it is legal to
catch and kill rattlesnakes for food.

<P><I>Joe,
<P>Local laws and Ordinances regarding Exotic and/or Venomous pets vary greatly from
one region to the next.  You will need to check three places for this information.  First,
your state law (check with the State Department of Fish and Wildlife), next, the County
law, and finally City or local law.  Your nearest animal shelter or SPCA may be able to
help you with these last two.  Alternatively, you could check with a dealer who sells
reptiles.  A reputable dealer should be up on all aspects of law regarding exotics.

<P>My goofy grandson brought into his house a  3 foot Pennsylvania rattler 
for his little girls to see. Which they did---and made appropriate 
little girl noises and so on. Quite naturally, the makeshift cage didn't 
cage very well and said snake was last seen entering the space between 
floor and ceiling below and now all ladies refuse to go home from 
mother's place and grandpap(me) has been summond to deal with the 
crises. I claim the snake doesn't want to be there and is probably gone 
and WON'T stay unless he has food and water and/or girl snakes..I know 
gasolene will drive him out( if he's there ) but that way is also a good 
way to burn down the house....Any suggestions or info will be greatly 
appreciated.....
<P><UL><UL>Grampa Wolf S.C. (snake chaser)</UL></UL>   

<P><I>Grampa Wolf,
<P>Well, you are right, of course - he doesn't want to be there, and wants to leave.  
The bad news is that snakes will hide in dark corners for long periods of time, and sometimes emerge when
 least expected (causing little girl noises from grown men, sometimes).  The good news is that if there is a way out, the 
snake has probably found it.

<P>As for gasoline, it might drive it out, or it might just make it sick.  And, as you note, there is the fire danger.

<P>You might want to call your local animal control or nuisance wildlife specialist 
and get some more specialized information.  I am not very familiar with extracting snakes from floors 
(although I have had snakes get away, and I suspect that is where they escaped to).

<P>Nick,

<P>I'm curious to know where you obtain your information?  My dog 
recently was bit by a baby rattlesnake.  She survived but is it true 
that babies have a more toxic venom than adults?  I also discovered 
that my dog cannot have anti-venom twice.  She apparently could have a 
violent reaction.

	<P><UL><UL>-Tiffany Hoss</UL></UL>

<P><I>Tiffany - 

<P>	It is generally taken as fact that baby rattlers have a more potent venom 
(although I don't know off the top of my head whether research supports this). 
 It stands to reason that they would evolve that way, as the babies are the most vulnerable individuals in the population.
  That is balanced, though, by the relatively small amount of venom they are able to deliver (because they are so small).
  So, though your dog received what might have been a more potent venom, she received certainly less than she would
 have from an adult snake, all other things being equal.

<P>As for my source of information, it is primarily Laurence Klauber's "Rattlesnakes:  Their Habits, Life Histories, 
and Influence on Mankind, which is the standard work on rattlesnakes.  
Other sources of information include my personal experience, common sense, other experts, and, in the case of dogs,
 four years experience as an animal control officer, which includes observation and performance of emergency 
veterinary procedures.

<P>Your story was so interesting that it has earned its own space

<P>Hi Nick,

<P>Have a question for you that actually comes from my parents. Here's 
what my dad e-mailed me:

<UL>>Please look this one up (on Alameda Creek Trail).  
It was about 2.5 <BR>>ft long, had dark brown and light brown coloration in kind of a<BR>
 >diamond pattern, but smaller pattern than on a diamondback.  It<BR>
>did have jowls like a venomous snake, and it turned back on Lee like <BR>
>it was pissed off and was ready for combat.  No rattles visible. <BR> 
>Very slow, like it didn't give a s*** (porcupine style).<BR>
</UL> 


<P>Okay. Questions:
<UL>
<LI>Are all snakes whose heads are shaped like a pit viper poisonous?

<LI>Are there pit vipers in California (East Bay Area) that don't have 
rattles?

<LI>If this snake was a young rattlesnake, is there an easy explanation 
for why it didn't have rattles?
(For instance, the snake might actually have had the beginnings of 
rattles, but perhaps they were difficult to see?)
</UL>

<P>In any case, I hope you can help us out. We're eternally curious about 
the animals that we meet when we're outside.

<P>And thanks for the great site you've put together. Really nice work.


<P><UL><UL>Jody Sumrall</UL></UL>

<P><I>Jody, 

<P>I have two words for you - <B>Pituophis Melanoleucus!</B>

<P>Now, I can't be positive without seeing it, but that's probably what your dad saw - 
otherwise known as a gopher or bull snake.  They do a very good job of imitating 
rattlesnakes - 
down to the practice of wiggling their tail very fast in the brush to make a 
rattling sound.  
The patterns are very similar, and the shape of the head is very similar.  
They are found throughout California.

<P>The two things that gopher snakes lack are 1) Pits, and 2) Rattles (they also lack fangs and venom, 
but I'm just mentioning the things that you could check without a visit to the Emergency room).  
The pits are organs located in the front of the skull, and look like enormous nostrils.  The rattles sometimes break off,
 but when they do, they leave behind a single blunt segment that is part of the tail.  
A gopher snake would have a tapered tail.  Also, on rattlesnakes, the tail is very often banded with black and white.
  In gopher snakes, the body pattern continues down to the tail tip.

<P>If it were a young rattlesnake, at 2 1/2 feet long, it would have already had a few rattles, 
unless it had the entire string broken off.  Rattlesnakes gain a rattle segment every time they shed.

<P>The two other pit vipers in the US - Cottonmouths and Copperheads - like to hang out east of the Rockies
 (probably because we call them names like Copperhead and Cottonmouth).

<P>Just a reminder of the obvious - be extremely careful about any snake you're not sure of. 
 Look it over carefully before you decide it's just a gopher snake and grab it :-)

<P>Hope this helps...

<P>Nick,
  <P>My home is in Tucson, AZ and backs up to a ravine at the foot of Pucsh
Ridge in the Santa Catalina mountains.  I recognize that part of the
trade-off for our beautiful, unobstructed view is having "close encounters"
with native wildlife.  We've seen a Gila Monster, javelina, quail,
roadrunners, rabbits, etc.  Although our neighbors warned us about rattlers,
we had never seen one until three weeks ago.  Since then we have had a 31/2
foot rattlesnake in the front yard at dusk; a 4 foot bull snake in the back
yard checking out our pet door; and lastly just three days ago, a 6 foot
rattler in the front yard, again at dusk.  We are currently in a drought
here; even the cactus are suffering.  We do have a pool, but the rattlers
have all been in front.  I know I can't necessarily prevent the rattlers, but
is there something that might be attracting them specifically to our front
yard?  I have a 22 month old toddler, and we are more than a little nervous.
 If we are inadvertantly attracting the rattlers, I would very much like to
know.
  <P>I enjoyed your web site.  I got much more info there than I did from our
local EMT's about emergency bite procedures, etc.  Thanks.
                                                       <P><UL><UL>Kathleen</UL></UL>

<P><I>Kathleen,
<P>Thanks for the compliments!
<P>Wild animals respond to three things - food, water, and shelter.  So, if they are coming to your house,
 then they are looking for one or the other of those things, or a combination.  

<P>Another part of the puzzle is that depending on the time of year, rattlesnakes will be active at one particular time, 
when the temperature is in their preferred operating range (~65 to 80 degrees, give or take five or ten...)  

<P>Since it can be too hot for them during the day this time of year, they will often become active at dusk. 
 This also happens to coincide with the peak activity of their favorite food source - rodents.  So,
 if this has been happening since the weather got hot (3 weeks ago sounds right), it probably just indicates that 
you are seeing them when they are the most active.

<P>My educated guess would be that you have rats or mice under your house, or around the yard.   
So, you are indirectly providing food for the snakes (both the rattlers and the bullsnakes - bet you start seeing king 
snakes too, which eat other snakes as well as rodents!).  Hence, the way to discourage the snakes is to stop attracting
 the mice and rats.

<P>The next question, of course, is what is attracting the mice and rats.  I'll bet the pet door is near the kitchen :-). 
 Or possibly near where you store the pet food.  Or both.  Start keeping the pet food in a covered trash bin. 
 I'm sure an exterminator would be happy to consult with you by phone on how best to stop attracting rodents to the
 house.  NOTE: You probably don't notice that you have rats and mice around.  That's because you have snakes keeping
 the population under control!

<P>Now - the big one.  The pool.  You live in an arid area (ever wonder, though, why they made those idiotic underpasses
 downtown that get flooded when it rains??), so water is at a premium.  Just the scent of that water - the humidity it gives
 to the surrounding air - will be enough to attract every living critter in the desert to your back patio.  
If you picture your area from above, you can probably picture how snakes and javalinas and gila monsters and etc.
 and etc. would make a beeline for that humid air.  Very likely those snakes in the front yard were on their way to the
 back yard.

<P>This is all just educated guesses, based on knowledge, experience, and a good measure of intuition...  
Hope it is of some help.   You might want to ask other pool owners around if they are experiencing the same thing.

<P>This is not a question...just a thank you.  Having encountered 2 timber
rattlers within 2 hours on a backpacking trip last weekend (VA Blue Ridge), I
realized that I was too ignorant for my own good!  The first snake was
sprawled across the trail and saw me before I saw it.  When it coiled about 2
feet off the path, my companion and I felt pretty stupid...we had visions of
those snakes on the Nature Channel in slo-mo  flying thru the air to strike
their victims.  We had NO idea how close we could safely pass, and
bushwacking off the trail and thru mountain laurel thickets was out of the
question.  We learned that after a 15 minute stand-off the snake would just
leave.</P>

<P>Made it easier when we found another at our campsite.  At least we knew by
then that the snake wanted nothing to do with us and wasn't a threat as long
as we didn't step on it in the dark!! </P>

<P>I've searched bookstores for more info...have been determined to know more
about rattlers before our next trip!!  I could find very little information

<P>I have a 4 year old and a 6mth old.  My biggest concern is their safety. 
Do you have any info on fatilities from rattlesnake bites to children?  
I've also heard baby/small rattlesnakes are potentially deadly because 
they inject all of their venom - is this true?  Final question: How far 
vertical (ie, up the leg) can a rattlesnake bite.  Will boots protect me 
in the "brushy"/dense areas of my yard.</P>

<P>Thanks,</P>
<UL><UL>Dave Smith</UL></UL>
<P><I>Dave,</P>
<P>I don't have any specific stats on bites to children, but I can give you some guidelines which might be more useful.
  The operant concept here is the ratio between amount of venom injected and body weight.  
Thus, the smaller the child, the greater the danger from any particular snake bite.</P>

<P>You are also correct about baby rattlers.  Their venom is more potent, though they have very little of it compared to adult
 snakes.  They are also more aggressive - nature's way of ensuring that they survive to adulthood.</P>

<P>Here is my advice for protecting your and your childrens' safety:</P>
<OL>
<LI> Contact the emergency room of your nearest hospital and find out their protocol 
for treating rattlesnake bites - ie in the event of a bite, how should you act to best
 help them to treat the bite victim.  Also find out if they keep antivenin on hand,
 or if they order it from a central source in the event of a bite.  Find out if they 
need to know what specific species inflicted the bite, or if they use a polyvalent that
 covers all the local species.  This information may or may not be helpful to you, but 
it will help you to feel more at ease when and if confronted with an actual bite 
situation.</LI> 

<LI>  Keep the brush trimmed down close to the house to make 
the immedtate area less attractive to rodents, and therefore less attractive to the 
snakes that prey on them.</LI> 

<LI>  When walking in the brush, stomp and shuffle your feet loudly.  
If the snakes hear you coming, they will move out of your way. Walk slowly to give them
 time to move away.</LI> 

<LI>  Most important, it is a good idea to teach your kids about safe observation of 
rattlesnakes without being paranoid about them.  On the whole, rattlers rarely bite, 
and the bites are rarely serious.  Most bites occur when someone is intentionally 
handling a snake.  A rattlesnake will go out of its way to avoid you, so except for the
 springtime, when the babies are prone to be aggressive, there is little danger of
 running into one unexpectedly.  Best advice is to use reasonable caution when prowling
 around in rattlesnake territory.</LI> </OL>

<P>Well, kind of like the ability to rub one's tummy and pat one's head at the same time, 
this probably differs from snake to snake.  I have seen  snakes rattle as they run, but this was just a quick buzz,
 not an extended sizzle like a coiled snake.  The rattle is generally used in conjunction with a flapping tongue and the 
coil, so I imagine the snake's physiology is set up to make it significantly easier to rattle for longer periods when in the
 defensive coil.</P>

<P>So, the simple answer is yes, a rattlesnake can rattle almost any time.  But if the snake is aroused enough to rattle
 extensively, it will probably also assume the coil and other defensive displays.</P>

my 5 year old son would like to know the answer to the question, " if one 
rattle snake bites another, will the bitten one die or will the poison 
have any effect on it ? "
-Gary Tinnel

<I><P>Gary,</P>
<P>Rattlesnakes have a very high resistance to their own venom, but are not completely immune. 
 when a rattlesnake is bitten by another rattlesnake, or if a rattlesnake accidentally bites itself, it is very likely that the
 wound will swell up just as it would in a human, but deaths due to this are probably very rare. 
 So, the effects are halfway between your son's suggestions, i.e. it would hurt them, but probably not kill them.</P>

<P>We live in the southeast corner of South Dakota by the Missouri river 
across from Sioux City, Iowa.  One of our neighbors reported seeing a 
rattlesnake in their grill and released it into the woods.  We are 
concerned as we have two small children.  Could you give us any 
information regarding how we might be able to protect and educate 
ourselves about the type of rattlesnake this might be.  There's lots of 
old wives tales and we were looking for some factual information we could 
use to be more prepared</P>
<UL><UL>-Steve Johns</UL></UL>
<I><P>Steve,</P>
<P>In South Dakota, you're pretty much talking about the Western rattlesnake,
C. Viridis.</P>
<P>You should teach your children not to approach strange snakes if they are
at all unsure about whether they are safe, but also not to be afraid.
Rattlesnakes do not chase or attack people.  If the snake coils and rattles,
the best approach is to stay still until the snake calms down, and then
slowly back away.  </P>

 <P>Hi Rick,</P>
<P>My name is David and I am an EMT-C in Florida.  I recently got into a 
rather heated discussion with one of our ER MD's about the bite of a 
rattlesnake.  Is it true that juvenile's tend to have a higher 
concentration of venom, or that it is stronger for some reason ?  Also, 
what are the reasons for dry bites ?
Thank You For your time,</P>


              <UL><UL> David Shepard B.S. EMT-C</UL></UL><BR>
<P><I>David,</P>
<P>First of all, the name is NICK, not Rick! ;-) </P>
<P>While there is much anecdotal evidence for juvenile rattlesnakes being more
aggressive and likely to bite than adults, I know of no research that actually
supports the hypothesis that the venom is more potent.  Klauber reports
that studies of dried venom extracted from juveniles shows that the venom
yield is smaller than would be expected for the body size, but also notes
that the muscular heads of young snakes make it more difficult to extract the
entire contents of the venom sac.  No evidence is presented to suggest that the
venom is more potent, although it has been suggested that young rattlers have a
higher percentage of neurotoxic factors in the venom.  It has also been
suggested that juveniles inject all of their venom when they bite to make up for
 the low volume of venom they have.</P>
<P>Dry bites (where a fang penetrates the skin, but no venom is injected)are actually
fairly common. Generally this is because the fang does not penetrate deep enough
to bring the mouth of the venom tube below the skin surface.  The orifice for venom
 injection is on the body, not the tip, of the fang so considerable penetration
has to be made before venom can be introduced under the skin. Sometimes, the snake
will misjudge the strike, and invect venom before the fang has been injected.</P>

I am looking for an intact rattle. I tried my local Natural History 
Museum (Santa Barbara) but it seems that the rattle they had is missing. 
Can you help me or provide me with helpful resources? </P>

<P>Funny thing - the rattle I had is missing too.  I think I loaned it to my tattoo artist when he was working on the design for my tattoo.
.. but, that's neither here nor there.  Do you just want to SEE one, or do you have to have it in your hands? 
 I'd try contacting Bob Myers at the Albuquerque International rattlesnake museum.  He's my fallback recommendation for
 anything rattler-related.  His contact info is on my page under "notable collections of live specimens."  If you just want to see one,
 and it's okay if it's still on a snake, the L.A. zoo probably has one or two, and I was recently at the San Diego Zoo (a bit of a field trip!)
, and the rattles on their snakes are enormous!</P>

<P>Help needed:  Advice on long term rehabilitation of a woman following 
rattle snake bites. </P> 

<P>History:  A healthy woman in her late 20s was rafting in the Grand 
Canyon (southwestern United States)  in June of this year.  She was 
bitten two times in the lateral ankle area by the same rattle snake.  
She was air-lifted out of the area and received 20 vials of antivenin.  
She did get serum sickness after that.  </P>

<P>Current state:  This patient has returned to her home in Missoula, 
Montana.  The woman continues to have swelling, pain, and parasthesia 
in the leg which was bitten.  She does well lying down with her feet 
elevated.  Wearing of compression garments (socks, leggings)  result 
in swelling above the garment.  This womans profession is dancing, 
and she owns a dance studio.  She is anxious to be back to work, and 
feels she is in good health with the exception of her leg problem.
</P><P>
Questions:  What is going on here, and how should this be treated in 
physical therapy?  What is the expected course of this problem?  Do 
you know an expert in long term rehabilitation following snake 
bites?  If so, who/where?  
</P>

<P> I am also not a physician, and so cannot dispense authoritative advice.  
Let me fabricate some things out of a little common sense, a little snakebite knowledge, and ten years as a massage therapist...</P>
<P>The venom renders the blood vessels unable to hold fluid - there is a great amount of damage to her leg on a very fine scale
 which will take some time to heal.  Because of the damage, I am  leery of suggesting something like effleurage 
( a massage stroke designed to promote circulation), because the vessels and connective tissue may not have regenerated to the
 point where they can take the extra pressure. My guess is that alternate hot and cold soaks may help, but CHECK WITH A 
DOCTOR FIRST!  Once the area has healed, massage to promote circulation.  These, as I say, are all educated guesses, and not 
based on experience with this situation.  My guess is that the leg will heal, but that it will be a slow process.</P>
<P>
Just as an offhand thought - you might want to contact someone who works with Native American 
traditions - probably a Naturopath or Herbalist would be a good start.</P>

<P>I would be very interested in what you find out, and also would be interested in updates on 
the woman's condition.</P>

<P>Nick - loved your page.</P>
<P>We found a baby snake in the hall today and were trying to identify it.  I know 
this is difficult without seeing it, but would appreciate any information you have.</P>

<P>The little guy was about 7 inches long.  He was brown with light green tinge to 
it with darker stripes (bands).  He was very aggressive.  When approached, he shook his
tail and struck at whatever was approaching.  He had no rattles at all, but we 
are guessing that a baby rattler would not.  It was so small that we didn't notice 
any pits.</P>
<P>We are located just North of Boulder, Colorado.  This is the third snake found 
in the halls here, and would appreciate any advice on how to positively identify them.</P>

<P><UL><UL>-No name given</UL></UL>

<I><P>Sounds like you had a brood of snakes hatch very near the house...</P>

<P>If it is a rattler, it will have an identifiable button on the tail, which is where the rattle segments will attach when he starts to shed.
  It will also have long fangs which fold up into the roof of its  mouth (if you feel really really ballsy, wear thick leather clothing and 
gloves, put the snake somewhere like a box where it can't get you, and try to get it to strike at a dangled rag - a rattler will probably
 get its fangs caught, or will at least display them).</P>

<P>What you described could very well be a young C. Viridis, but it could also be a bullsnake, or gopher snake, 
which look very similar, are very aggressive, and shake their tails just like rattlesnakes (an evolved mimicry which keeps them safe
 from rattlesnake-wary predators).  If the tail is slender and ends in a sharp point, then this is probably what you have.</P>

<P>Better yet - if you are not too far from Boulder, call down to CU and see if they have a herpetologist on staff this time of year who
 can take a look at it.  While you're there, say hi to the folks at KGNU, who were wonderful to me when I came through twice on tour
 playing music (my former bandmate Deb Seymour, now of Seattle, was the Blues Lady on KGNU for 12 years).</P>

<P>Let me know what you find out!</P>

<P>I recently stumbled across a snake and am unsure of its species.  First of all I live in Clemson SC, the snake 
was located about 100 yards from a lake.  The color of the snake was light gray with maroon uniform splotches. 
Being so small the head shape didn't really give me any clues, it was slender and didn't have a pit vipers 
head. The snake was a baby (aprox 8 inches, pencil size in dia)just about to shed its skin (cloudy eyes), the 
snake was rather aggressive, I assume because of his transitional state. In his aggression he shook his tail 
violently as if trying to warm me but was unable to make any noise due to the absence of rattles.  Making me 
think that he is some type of rattlesnake but am leaning towards him being an impersonator of some kind.  Not 
that this is a life or death matter but just that I want to curb my curiosity.  In reference to his head, will 
baby pit vipers have the distinguished head or does this happen as he grows and gets older?</P>

<P><I>Troy,</P>
<P>What you have described could very well be a carolina pygmy rattlesnake (sistrurus miliarius). 
  I'd recommend going to the pygmy rattlesnake homepage at <A HREF = "http://www.stetson.edu/~biology/pigpage.html" target = "_top">http://www.stetson.edu/~biology/pigpage.html</A>, 
and looking at the pictures.  Not all pygmys are as brightly colored as the ones they show, and a snake about to shed would be
 duller in color also.</P>

<P>Pygmy rattlers have tiny rattle strings, and the babies would only have a button on the tail where the rattle will grow. 
 It is possible that there was a button and you didn't notice it.  Pygmys are of the genus Sistrurus, members of which have a sleeker 
head than those of Crotalus so no, it would not necessarily have a "pit-vipery" head.</P>

<P>There are, however, imitative snakes.  Here in the west we have the Gopher Snake or Bullsnake, which is similarly shaped and
 patterned to our native rattlesnakes, and which shake their tails vigorously.  However, bullsnakes have pointy tails with no rattles,
 and so are readily identifiable.  I don't know what snakes you have in the east that would have those characteristics.  If you don't think
 it was a pygmy rattler, you might check your public library or bookstore for Joe Collins' "Peterson's field guide to Eastern reptiles
 and amphibians."</P>

<P>I love to walk in the desert, especially at dusk but also 
dawn and after dark.  I prefer not to use a flashlight as
it ruins the vibes.  I do move slowly and stomp my feet.</P>

<P>Are there specialty leggings (kevlar?!) that I could wear
that would be 'fully' protective in case I get unlucky or
inadvertantly corner (or step on) a snake etc.?</P>

<P>I once read an article where they described wrapping 
window screen material around your legs.  I'm assuming 
the snakes 'always' strike below the knee, unless you're 
near a rock ledge (which could be skirted).  I take care
not to reach into bushes or place my hands where I can't 
see.</P>

<P>Also, how protective are the different boot types.</P>

<P>I very much appreciate your help as this is a major hobby
of mine and even when I'm not getting bitten (none yet),
I'd greatly prefer to minimize the concern.</P>

<P>Thank you very much and good luck in your work! </P>


<P><UL><UL>Rob</UL></UL>   

<P><I>Rob,</P>
<P>Well, I once did the same thing, and bought army surplus gaiters for that purpose, but found that they don't reach high enough.</P>

<P>As for the window screen idea - I imagine the mesh would not be tight enough to prevent  fang entry. 
 Kevlar would be overkill for sure :-).  Rattlesnakes are not bullets and their penetration ability is limited.</P>

<P>The experts recommend good solid jeans (or if you feel kinky, leather pants, *wink*), but the key is that they be loose-fitting.
  Fangs that penetrated the jeans would then very likely be kept away from your skin.  So, loose-fitting heavy denim jeans over any 
calf-high boot (ie cowboy boots) would most likely provide optimum protection.  If you are determined to wear window screens over
 your legs, please send pictures :-).   Seriously, if I were walking directly into a rattlesnake den, I would wear good solid hip waders, 
but short of that, baggy jeans and boots should do the trick.</P>

<P>Dear Nick,</P>
<P>I have a general question about snake bites and I thought maybe you 
could lead me in the right direction.  I heard that snakes cannot bite 
when they are swimming under water.  Is this true?<P>

	<UL><UL>-Emily Reichman</UL></UL>





	

<P><I>Emily,</P>

<P>I will quote Laurence Klauber directly here:</P>

<P>"The question of whether rattlesnakes can bite when in, or under, water is occasionally asked.
  The answer is that they can bite readily enough, although, lacking the anchorage of a solid base, they cannot strike efficiently."</P>

<P>Nick:</P>

<P>Unfortunately, my black lab was bitten today by a Western 
Rattlesnake (not a Diamondback - we live in N. California in the 
Sierra Mtns. above Lake Tahoe).  The distance between the bite/fang 
marks on his cheek was 1.5 inches.  Now, since I did not see the 
snake {all the symptoms indicate snake bite} when he was bit, is 
there a way that I can make an estimate of the size of the snake 
from the distance between the puncture wounds?</P>

<P>Secondly, since the distance between the puncture wounds seems large 
for a Western Rattlesnake, is it possible that other species of 
rattlers live in our area.  All the adult rattlers that I have seen 
in our area have a greenish hue, lack distinct "diamond" blotches, 
have faint white rings on the tail, and seem not to exceed 20 - 24 
inches in length.  I have seen a young (5 - 6 inches) rattlesnake 
that was tan with very distinct brown blotches.  Is this a typical 
color pattern for young Western Rattlesnakes or are we dealing with 
a different species?  The vegetation in our area varies from 
coniferous forests to sagebrush.</P>

<P>Any help you can shed on these issues would be greatly appreciated.  
I'm watching my dog closely tonight and hoping for a recovery with 
very little tissue damage.</P>



<P><UL><UL>Dave Valle</UL></UL>

<P><I>Dave,</P>

<P>I am going to have to call into question either your measurements or your diagnosis.
  From your description and my research I am going to guess that your dog was bitten by a cat or something very similar in size
 and physiology.  Let me explain.</P>

<P>First, a cat bite is very septic.  It will swell up and get infected very quickly, and can be very painful and sometimes fatal,
 much like a rattlesnake bite.  See my notes below.</P>

<P>Secondly, there are studies which do correlate fang separation to body size in rattlesnakes, and unless my calculations are
 way off,  for a rattlesnake to have a fang separation of 1.5 inches, it would have to have a body length of over 8 feet.</P>

<P>Here are my calculations.  size correlation constants and formulas are as taken from Laurence Klauber's "Rattlesnakes,
 their habits, natural histories, and influence on mankind."</P>

<UL><LI>	1) Head length = 2.5 times fang separation:  2.5(1.5 inches) = 3.75 inches</LI>
<LI>	2) Body length is given by the following formula:<UL>

	<LI>H = aL + b, where H is head length, L is body length, and a and b are constants that differ from species to species.</LI>
<LI>  Measurements are in millimeters.  3.75 inches = 95.25 millimeters.</LI>

<LI>I did the calculation based on figures for two species: <UL>
<LI>c. viridis (western rattler) a = .0345, b = 7.7  </LI>
<LI>c. atrox (western diamondback) a = .0351, b = 8.7</LI>

<BR>atrox is the only species west of the rockies that gets to 6' or more (8' is, however, unheard of). </UL></LI></UL>

	<LI>3) Solving the equation for L gives:<UL>

<LI>c. atrox  L = (95.25 - 8.7)/.0351 = 2465.8mm = 8.1 feet</LI>
<LI>c. viridis L = (95.25 - 7.7)/.0345 = 2537.7mm = 8.3 feet</LI></UL></UL>

<P>Whatever bit your dog, I hope that you get him to a vet ASAP.  A small mammal bite, as I mentioned, can be life-threatening.
  Chances are that a rattlesnake bite by a snake of the size you are describing would be fatal, unless there was little or no
 venom injected.</P>

<P>One of the greatest dangers of a bite from a feral cat, skunk, or baby raccoon (my top three guesses from the fang separation 
you described) is rabies, which is 100% fatal to both dogs and humans.  </P>

<P>Please write back and let me know how your dog does, and what the vet has to say.</P>



	<P><UL><UL>-Nick</UL></UL></I>

<UL><P><I>Dave Responded:</P>
<P>Nick:</P>

<P>Thank you for your quick and informative response to my question.
Your diagnosis adds credence to what I initially thought was a 
bobcat (or other mammal) wound based on the distance between the 
puncture wounds.  However, if it was a cat I would expect other 
wounds especially from the lower canines or scratch marks.  I also 
did not hear a fight, although my dog was probably out of hearing 
range a few times.  Perhaps, it was a coyote, a skunk, a raccoon or 
maybe a young moutain lion.  Coyotes and lions are common in the 
area;  skunks are common too, although my dog was not sprayed; I 
have not seen any sign of raccoons.</P>

<P>Jake, my lab, is doing about the same as last evening when I wrote 
you:  slightly lethargic, a lot of swelling in the cheek, lip and 
neck area. He's eating and drinking, though, which is a good sign.  
And his urine is a normal color. I did take him to the vet yesterday 
and the doctor treated him with antibiotics (ampicillin injection 
and cephalexin orally) and a steroid (dexamethasone) to reduce 
tissue death. Antivenom was not administered.</P></UL></I>

The Rattlesnake As Symbol
</Title>
</HEAD>

<Body BGcolor = "FFFFFFFFF">

<H1>The Rattlesnake as a Symbol</H1>


<cite><UL><UL>"The snake and lightning or lightning arrow are considered by the native Southwesterner to be a single element as they are the same visual form. The snake does not symbolize "defiance" except possibly in New England, nor is its meaning "wisdom." Lightning is used by Anglo-Europeans indoctrinated in Greek mythology to denote swiftness, but among the Pueblo Indians snakes and lightning are equated with and symbolize rain, hence, fertility."<BR><BR></cite><UL><UL>- Wingspread Collectors Guide to the Albuquerque Metro Area.</UL></UL></UL></UL><BR>
<Font size = +2>R</font>attlesnakes are unique to the Americas, and so are one of our natural symbols.<BR><BR>
<Font size = +2>I</font>t is unfair to limit the rattlesnake, or any snake, to the popular interpretation of the Christian symbology of serpents as devils. The Eden myth rather sets forth two fertility symbols - the snake as phallus, the apple as ovary.  The ascription of evil to the serpent is a judgment of the symbol rather than an objective view.<BR><BR>
<Font size = +2>T</font>he Judeo-Christian tradition is not the only one where the serpent is used to represent fertility.  Native Americans use the rattlesnake for just that symbolic purpose.  The swiftly striking snake is associated with lightning, lightning with rain, and rain with germination of the earth mother.  The lightning/snake is the divine phallus which pierces the earth's womb, creating life.<BR><BR>
<Font size = +2>T</font>he rattlesnake's association with poisoning and death brings into play the idea of transformation.  The rattlesnake can be seen as a guardian of the gateway to the world beyond, having the power to send humans across the barrier, and hopefully, the power to bring them back.<BR><BR>
<Font size = +2>A</font>merican upstarts throughout the early history of the United States found the rattlesnake a useful symbol.  The rattlesnake is an underdog - creeping on the ground, but sly and crafty, equipped with a powerful weapon, and not afraid to stand up for itself, rattling loudly as if to say "don't tread on me!"<BR><BR>

<P>
<H1>SKINNING A SNAKE</H1>
<I><font color = "#008F9F"><B> Thanks to Bob Myers at the Albuquerque International Rattlesnake Museum for supplying this information</B></font></I>

<UL>
<LI>Use scissors to cut through belly crawlers, starting in anal opening
and working toward head.  Try to stay in the middle and cut an even line.  Starting
at the tail, use a sharp knife to separate the skin from the body of the snake by holding
the skin tautly away from the body.  
<LI>When you have the skin free about 6&quot; from the tail, grasp the skin firmly and pull toward the head being careful not to tear the skin.  The head can be skinned if it is to be used.  But, be careful not to break your skin on the fangs. Otherwise the head can be cut off just behind the head.  
<LI>Lay the skin out scales side down being careful not to wrinkle the scales.  
<LI>Use a serrated kitchen knife to scrape the flesh off the skin.  Most of the flesh will be on the back of the crawlers.  
<LI>Wipe the hide  off on both sides with paper towels.  Wipe from the head to the tail so the scales don't get bent.  At this point the skin can be rolled up (flesh side inside) and placed in a plastic sack and frozen.  Squeeze all the air out of the sack.

               TANNING SNAKE SKINS
</H1>
<H3><I>(DO NOT STRETCH, DO NOT SALT, DO NOT WASH SNAKE SKINS)</H3></I>
<BR>
<BR>

<UL>
<LI>Lay skin scales down on long flat board.  Arrange skin so pattern
seems even.  DO NOT STRETCH HIDE.  
<LI>Place one nail, pin or tack in center of pattern
at each end of snake hide.  Fasten a string between the pins.  String should
be taut and not touching skin.  This is to help you get the pattern straight.  
<LI>Place pins in center of the pattern under the string.  Center the pattern under the string.  
<LI><I><B>STRETCHING THE SKIN WILL CAUSE THE HIDE TO PULL OFF OF THE PINS AND THE HIDE WILL BUCKLE AND WILL NOT FLATTEN OUT AGAIN.</I></B>
<LI>  Starting in the middle of the skin, flatten the hide and place pins in the outer edges of the crawlers and both ends.
<LI>Continue pinning until your pins are no more than one-half inch
apart.  This will reduce the chances of the skin pulling loose.  
<LI>Remove the pins
under the string and pin closed any bullet holes or tears in the skin.  
<LI>Let skin dry about 8 to 10 hours, then apply one generous coat of the tanning oil with a clean paint brush.  Do not wipe off excess.
<LI>Wait about 8 to 10 hours before removing all of the pins and turning
the skin over.
<LI> Apply one coat of the oil as before.  Wait about 8 to 10 hours
again.  
<LI>Press excess oil from skin by laying skin between several layers of paper toweling
in between two flat boards weighted on top.  Be careful skin doesn't get wrinkled.
 <LI>After excess oil is removed, the skin is ready to be made into a hat band, belt or
rug.  The skin can be glued onto a belt blank or hat band blank with Tandy's All Purpose
Cement.  
<LI>Lightly brushing the skin with a wire brush will remove the scale covers.
 Be sure not to brush against the direction of the scales as this will make them stand
up.</UL>

<BR><BR>
<font size = +2>I</font> tried to ignore the man who sat across from me at the long white table,
but he was intent on me.  He was probably in his late forties.  Navaho,
dressed in the soiled motley of a street person.  He held out a
two-thirds-empty bottle of cheap red wine.  I declined.  "It's not polite
to refuse to share what's offered," he said.  I took the bottle, figuring
the alcohol would kill any germs the rim might harbor.  "I don't want any,"
I said, "but just to be polite, I'll share."  I took a token swallow of
sweet, warm wine, almost like sherry.  He smiled.  "I have a riddle.  What
has four corners, stays in one corner, and travels all over the United
States, day and night?"  I shrugged.  "Think about it," he said.  I though
about four cornered things.  This room.  This table.  My book.  An
envelope.  "An envelope," I guessed.  "Very close," he said.  "A postage
stamp."  He outlined the form of an envelope, and indicated the upper
right-hand corner.  "Four corners, stays in one corner, travels all over
the United States, day and night."  He laughed.<BR><BR>

<font size = +2>W</font>hen the laundromat closed, he followed me outside.  His name was Fort
Apache.  He was born on the reservation in Tuba City.  His brother was a
chess champion, his sister a black belt in judo.  He had come to Flagstaff
to work, but when the work ran out, he was left to sleep in the street.  He
asked where I was sleeping.  I indicated my truck.  "It's cold.  If I sleep
outside tonight, I'll die," he said, simply.<BR><BR>

<font size = +2>I</font> was surprised how easily we both fit in my truck, head to foot, I
willing to put up with his unfamiliar and unwashed odor for the sake of
possibly saving his life.  He finished his wine, and laid the bottle down,
neck cradled on a paper bag.  "Always leave the bottle with its head to the
East, like a person, to breathe.  This helps hangover, makes you healthy.
Treat all this way."  He paused.  "Hey.  A Navajo came before a judge for
drinking.  Judge sentenced him to ten days in jail.  The Navaho was proud.
He said  'I'll do it standing on my head.'  'Then I'll give you another ten
days to get back on your feet.'  I grunted to acknowledge the joke.  Fort
told me lots of stories that night: tall tales of his life on the
reservation, and local lore about San Francisco peak - about the dragon on
top that devoured tourists, and that the mountain got it's name because,
from the top, you could look through a telescope and see "that Golden Gate
Bridge."  He kept repeating this phrase - "That Golden Gate Bridge," like a
punchline.<BR><BR>

<font size = +2>F</font>lagstaff is a city of many trains.  Sometime that night, I heard three
trains blow their horns together in a major chord.<BR><BR>

<font size = +2>T</font>he next morning, Fort asked me for money.  "I'll make you a deal," I
said.  "I want to know how to catch rattlesnakes this time of year.  I'll
give you money if you can tell me how."  I had been obsessed with these
snakes since Modesto, but had seen none, despite hours of hiking through
amazing desert landscapes: the dry canyon in Cactus City, Ca., that must
have emptied into the Salton Sea, where the sand held my tracks so well
that the second day I could read the word "Reebok" in yesterday's print.
The blasted heath at Ehrenberg on the Arizona border, where Saguaros were
the only break in the sunburned rocks.  The spiny steep hills west of
Quartzite where the wind was strong enough to weather the rock into cactus
shapes, arches, and caves.  The hugeness of the wilderness behind the
aqueduct at Salome, where I trespassed on US Government land to rockclimb a
butte littered with quartz roses and crystals.  The natural riprap ridges
by Casa Grande where I saw a bobcat moving in the foreground of a vista
that stretched for miles in every direction.  The fertile, creviced,
surprisingly soft rich brown earth at Sunset Point.  The breathtaking
redrock of "Monkey Face," where I rockclimbed in Sedona, and the
jackrabbit-infested white rock country of Cottonwood, a few miles away.<BR><BR>

"<font size = +2>I</font> know how to catch scorpions," he said.  "Go into the desert and burn
some wood to a fine, white ash.  Cover your hand with a thick layer of this
ash.  Hold your hand out to the scorpion.  It will come onto your hand.
When it does, speak your heart to it, ask for its protection.  Then let it
go.  It will be your protector.  When I did this, the scorpion ran up my
arm and stung me here." he showed me a round scar on his biceps.  "When I
showed this to my grandfather, he told me that I would be very strong, and
that I would live to be one hundred and twenty years old.  You can catch
rattlesnakes the same way.  To attract the snakes, go into the desert and
speak the prayer 'Hey.'  The snake will come to you.  When he opens his
mouth at you, throw some ash inside.  He will hallucinate and lay still.
Then you can pick him up and speak your heart to him, ask him to be your
protector.  Then let him go.  He will be your protector."<BR><BR>

<font size = +2>I</font> reminded Fort that it was the fall; that the snakes would be in their
dens.  He taught me a song:<BR><BR>

<UL><UL><L1>Ya ka sha Shosha<BR>
Ho sha na<BR>
Hey ney ney ney<BR><BR>

Ya ka sha<BR>
Ho sha na<BR>
Hey ney ney ney<BR><BR></L1></UL></UL>

<font size = +2>H</font>e explained that Shosha was the name of the bear, and that this song was
to draw bear out of hibernation, but that it should work for rattlesnakes
as well.  He said that because I was a rookie, I should be prepared to
sleep in the desert for several days, singing the song to the four
directions.  At my request, he told me the name of the rattlesnake - Do'a
chi'a ni'i.  He explained that the last two syllables turned quickly, like
the rattle of the snake.<BR><BR>

<font size = +2>W</font>hen we left the truck, Fort thanked me and gave me his English name and
address.  He was disappointed in the ten dollars I gave him, and tried to
get me to give him more for the riddle of last night.  I declined.  He
would not let me take his picture.

a book is that you can do revisions whenever you want.  Every week, I get new
information, a new photo, or realize there is something I have left unsaid.
  Unfortunately, I don't have time to update weekly...</P>
<P>So what is <img src = "new.gif" alt = "new"> since the June update?  Well, first of all, I have added a new section,
"<A HREF = "http://www.seeport.com/staff/dallett/klauber/excursions/excursions.htm"><I><B>Excursions</B></I></A>."  Excursions is a collection
of photo-essays on herp expeditions by myself and others.  I have put the <I>c. ruber</I>
 encounter there, as well as the long-promised but never before delivered
report on the San Diego Zoo's Klauber-Shaw reptile house.  At the risk
of offending purists among my readership, one of my "Excursions" details
a lizard hunt I went on recently, which has brought up the exciting
prospect of a possible undocumented species of lizard in the Pacific Northwest.
  Finally, I have added a page on Carl Hess (<A HREF = "mailto:macchess@fast.net">macchess@fast.net</A>), a regular correspondent who has 
been photographing <I>c. horridus</I> near his home in Pennsylvania.</P>
<P>Carl also sent a list of recommended books, which I have added to my
anemic bibliography.</P>
<P>"Ask Nick" continues to grow (well into 3 pages), with some interesting questions sent in by readers.
There are more and more requests for information on where to sell venom, and 
one query that allowed me to put on my Sherlock Holmes cap to figure out what
it was that bit a poor fellow's dog (curious?  Read the letter <A HREF = Q&A3.htm#30>HERE</A>.)<UL><UL><I>-Nick</UL></UL></I>

<P>Last night we watched a television program about rattlesnakes. I mentioned
that I had heard that you should not handle the rattles of snakes (once
they are dead) because the snake sharpened their fangs on their rattles and
small amounts of poison would leak onto the rattles.

<P>Did I hear right?

<P>I'd appreciate a response as my family acted like I was crazy last night
when I mentioned this.

<UL><UL><P>- Michele, Provo, Ut.</UL></UL>

<P><I>Michele, you fell prey to a tall tale.  Rattlesnakes do not sharpen their fangs - when one set wears out, it is replaced by a new set that grows in behind the old, much like sharks' teeth.  Incidentally, even if there were a small amount of venom on the rattles, it would be unlikely to be harmful unless rubbed in a fresh open wound.  Rattlesnake venom is digestible, and will not harm you if swallowed.<br><UL><UL>- Nick</I></UL></UL>

<P>Re:  my "Rattlesnake Salad" recipe
<P>I have never made this recipe.  I found it in a cookbook I 
got out of the library or from a cooking magazine.  I can't remember 
exactly.  I saved it as a curiosity.  I would be willing to try it if
I ever had access to rattlesnake meat.  But that is extremely 
unlikely.  Have you tried it?  How was it?
<UL><UL><P>- Kate Connally</UL></UL>
<I><P>Kate,
<P>No, I haven't tried your salad.  I <B>Have</B> had grilled rattlesnake (seasoned with dijon mustard, salt, and pepper).  It was very delicious, and not unlike a cornish game hen.</I>

<P>Are there rattlesnakes in Sri Lanka?  I had thought 
them limited to the Western hemisphere, but a brief article in NEW 
SCIENTIST ("A kinder antidote to snakebite," 3 February 1996, p. 18) 
reporting a new antivenin produced by Therapeutic Antibodies of 
Nashville says that "A third new antivenin neutralises bites from a 
variety of Sri Lankan rattlesnake, where conventional antivenin is 
useless."  
<P>  Thanks for a most interesting Website.  If you have any interest in 
post-traumatic stress disorder, my National Center for PTSD Website is

<P><I>Fred,
<P>It's not often a respected science magazine makes an error of this magnitude.  Rattlesnakes are indeed unique to the Americas.
A phone call to Dr. Steve Porter of Therapeutic Antibodies confirmed that the snake in question was the Russel's Viper.
  I have written to the New Scientist editor to correct the error.

<P>I'd like to ask if you know of a copy of Klauber's work for 
something less than a king's ransom.  I bought the abridged version 
and was sadly disappointed.  I only want it for research purposes, and 
not as a collector's volume.  I've seen various copies in the past, 
advertised in SELVA, and the like, but all are in excess of two 
hundred dollars, as I'm sure you are aware, and I can't quite go that 
route.

<P>If out hiking with my dog and it gets bitten what should I do?  Can you 
purchase antivenin? if so, where from?  What do you suggest to take along 
if antivenin is unavailable.
<P><UL><UL>- Daniel Hankins<BR><A HREF = "mailto: dhankins@west.net">dhankins@west.net</A></UL></UL>
<P><I>Daniel,
<P>First, let me say that I am <B>NOT</B> a veterinarian, and that checking with your vet on this question
is your best source of information.  However, I'll make the following observations:
<P>The variety of dog makes a huge difference in the danger from snake bite.  
The larger the dog, the more venom will be required to kill it. 
 The longer and thicker the dog's hair, the less likely the snake will be able to insert a fang. 
 Thus, a St. Bernard could likely shrug off a minor bite, while a chihuahua might have little chance for survival.
<P>There is some evidence that once a dog has been bitten, if it survives, it will then have a partial immunity, and will then be more resistant to the venom. 
 This is true of humans, and also of horses (antivenin has long been produced by injecting horses with small amounts of venom until they develop an immunity. 
 The antibody-bearing serum is then drawn off to use for bite treatment).
<P>Antivenin can only be purchased by a doctor.  Check with your vet to see whether they keep it on hand, and whether they are familiar with its use.

<P>I have been enjoying your page on rattlesnakes. I do have a couple of 
questions.

<P>1. Are you aware of the species Crotalus cascavella? I have it listed in 
a homeopathic textbook as the Brazilian rattlesnake, and I noted that it 
was not included in your list. Does crotalus cascavella have another 
name?

<P>2. Could you share your tattoo design with me? I have been working on a 
crotalus horridus design to be on my left lower back for a while now and 
am interested in seeing how you solved some of the design problems I am 
having.

<A name = "8"></A><Center><A HREF = "q&a.htm">TOP</A></center><HR>
<P>How can you tell the age of a rattlesnake? I heard that you could by 
counting the number of rattles, but I'm not sure. Also, how often does a 
rattlesnake shed it's skin?
<P><UL><UL>- Chuck Anderson</UL></UL>
<P><I>Chuck,
<P>The last I know of (Klauber again), a way of positively determining the age of a rattlesnake had not been found, but some researchers had discovered 
that it is possible to analyze the growth pattens in the bones of the skull, much like counting tree rings 
(evidence seems to support the supposition that rattlesnakes grow throughout life).  
Estimates based on captive snakes give a life span of 20+ years, with sexual activity beginning at 4-5 years.  
Telling the age of a rattler encountered in the field is, therefore, nearly impossible.  
Provided one knows the species, size can give you perhaps the best indicator.

<P>Rattlers add a rattle segment each time they shed.  Shedding occurs frequently in the first two years of life (up to 3-4 times per year), and then slows down from there.
  Rattlers probably shed at least once per year, adults probably no more than 3 times a year in the wild.  
Captive snakes are a completely different story, as the warmth of their cage may allow year-round activity 
(as zoos become more and more sophisticated, some are beginning to put their animals through natural seasons, so a snake may spend 3-4 months in hibernation and then be gradually warmed in the spring).
  Captive snakes then may shed much more frequently.

<P>Added to all this confusion is the fact that snakes rarely have all their rattles.
  Dragging the rattle through the underbrush causes segments to break and fall away. 
 Again, captive snakes are far more likely to have complete rattles, as they lead a more protected life.
<P><UL><UL>-Nick</UL></UL></I>
<P><I>John Sealy, a researcher in NC, adds:
<P>Recent research allows some fair accuracy in age determination using 
the rattle.  To determine age a few things must be known however.  
Molting rates corelate to active season.  Molting occurs at a fairly 
consistent rate for each month the snake is out of hibernation. 
Molting on average is not particularly corelated to feeding rates.  
So, if a population's active time and molting rates are known then age 
can be determined.  There are some limitations.  For instance the 
rattle of C.h. tapers until about the 10th molt.  After the snake 
reaches terminal size, the rattle segments no longer show taper.  With 
experience we can accurately determine total molts, even if some 
segments are missing.  In other words if the rattle is not complete, 
but is tapered, total rattle segments ie molts can be determined.  
Additionally, if the rattle has no taper the snake has lost at least 
10 segments. Age can only be listed as older than the age of the 
estimate from segments lost and those remaining.  This is only for 
adults.  A snake that has not achieved full size and showing "say" one 
segment is a problem, taper cannot be determined.  However, age can be 
determined here as well.  A researcher has accumulated thousands of 
weight to length measurments of C.h. of known age. It differentiates 
between gravid, non-gravid and males. We constantly test this 
correlation with animals of known age. (those with full rattles in a 
population of known molting rate)  It is very accurate.</I><BR><BR>

<P><I>Jaap,
<P>Nothing of the sort has crossed my desktop, but perhaps some of my readers have heard something.
<P>Rattlesnake venom has been touted as a cure before (Klauber reports that there are some who believe that a
second rattlesnake bite will counteract the effects of the first!  This belief is probably based on the fact that venom is used in
the production of antivenin).  However, I know of no scientific study that has proven or attempted to prove the efficacy of
any venom as a curative agent.
<P>Let me take this opportunity to congratulate you on a wonderful web page on your research.  Anyone who hasn't seen it

Hello, my name is Russell and I would like to ask a question regarding 
the skeleton and its movements regarding the snake. I understand that a 
snake is composed of several vertebrae and along these vertebrae the ribs 
are placed in a degree similar to a humans rib cage. I know that these 
ribs are the reason the scutes of the rattlesnakes can bunch up in 
certain areas and relax in others and thus a rectilinear movement, found 
in all snakes, is achieved and enables the snake to progress foward and 
to even swim. However, my question is more specifically in regards to the 
degree in which the ribs are able to move fowards and backwards as well 
as contract in a direction into the center of the body as well as relax 
or extend outwards. I would like to know perhaps the actual or average 
length or the degree of arc created in each pair of ribs as it moves 
because all bones in a snake are limited in movement. So generally, I 
would like to know the small degree in which the snake moves it one 
isolated set of ribs in all the directions. If you can help me it would 
be greatly appreciated as my resources here at the University of Illinois 
are failing me.
 <UL><UL>
Thank you<BR>

<I>
Russell,
<P>According to Klauber, the ribs do not change position relative to the vertebral column during rectilinear motion.
  The motion is achieved through reciprocating movements between the snake's skin and it's body.
	This is not to say that there is no freedom of movement at the junction between rib and vertebra.
  Snakes breathe much as mammals do, the rib cage expanding and contracting with each breath.
  A large meal will require a certain anount of expansion of the rib cage as well.
	I have no figures for you on exact range of motion. 
 However, I imagine that this data exists for snakes in general, and that figures for other snake families would be similar.
  You might look for a text on ophidian anatomy.<BR>

<P>Where are rattlesnakes distributed in British Columbia Canada? Both in 
what regions and how are they distributed along an elevational gradient?
<UL><UL>
	-Shade Teague<BR>
</UL></UL>

<P><I>Shade,
<P>From what I can glean, it appears that there are only four species that occur in Canada, and these are in the southern portion, to wit:
<P>Crotalus viridus oreganus is found in Southern BC.  According to Klauber, the distribution is within a triangle formed by Lilloooet-Shushwap Lake-Osoyoos, and east along the US border to Christina lake.
<P>Crotalus viridus viridus is found in Southwestern Sasketchawan (South of the South Sasketchawan river and West of longitude 107 degrees, 30 minutes W), and Southeastern Alberta  (South of the red deer river and East of longitude 113 degrees W)
<P>Crotalus horridus horridus was found several decades ago on the shore of Lake Erie, but at the time was scarce, and is probably extinct in that area now.
<P>Sistrurus catenatus catenatus has been found in Southern Ontario, on the shores of Georgian bay, Lake Huron, and Lake Erie.  Also on the Prince Edward Peninsula in Lake Ontario.
<P>As far north as Canada, it is likely that the snakes will be found mostly at lower elevations.  Snakes are temperature-sensitive, and below a certain temperature, they cannot function at all (optimum temperature for most species of Rattlesnake is 75-85 degrees fahrenheit).  It is doubtful that you would encounter any below 50 degrees.  I'm not sure how this correlates with altitude in your neck of the great white north, but suffice to say that rattlesnakes are uncommon in Canada at all, and the greater the elevation, the lower the temperature, and thus the lower the chance of encountering snakes.

<P>Phil,
<P>When I was doing the initial research on rattlesnake-related web pages, I found a whole usenet discussion on this subject.  Even though I'm both a musician and a crotalophile, I  saw this as peripheral to my purpose, so I didn't bookmark any of it.  You might try searching using Lycos for "rattlesnake."  As I recall, it was either Lycos or Webcrawler who returned that thread.  Actually, if you have been searching for this information for 6 months or more, it might have been your usenet postings I was reading...

Off the top of my head, I would suggest folklore societies rather than either music or rattlesnake resources.  For example, the Northwest Folklife Festival staff has a number of people who probably could put you on the correct trail.  (206) 684-7300.

<P>
My father-in-law found a rattler on his ranch 10 miles east of Ensenada 
in Mexico, up in the hills, and is concerned since his grandkids will be 
visiting soon.  

<P>His Mexican friend called it "cascabel serpiente", and he's not sure if 
that just literally means "rattlesnake" or is a specific type.  The 
snake appeared to have whitish rings, recognizable diamonds and rattles. 
 It was about 3-4 feet long and lived at 1000'-1500' elevation.

<P>The question is, how dangerous is this type of snake and its venom?
How can he minimize risk of snakes to 3 rambunctions 5 to 8 year olds 
who like to explore:  avoiding certain terrain, clearing brush, certain 
times of day, etc.

<P>There is a shaded ravine in the center of the property -- would they be 
more or less likely to be there?

<P>Are there any animals or pets that would encourage the snakes to live 
elsewhere?  What action should be taken in case of snakebite, for kids 
or adults?  Are anti-venom injections available?

<P>Thanks in advance.
<UL><UL>-Mark Saltveit<BR>
<A HREF = "mailto: msalt@well.com">msalt@well.com</A>
</UL></UL>
<P><I>Mark,

<P>Cascabel is Spanish for "little bell", or rattle, and serpiente is Spanish for "snake"  hence it means literally "rattle snake."  
<P>Any rattlesnake is dangerous, and the kids should be warned about them and told how to deal with them - ie if they hear the rattle, they should stand still until they see where the snake is, and then slowly back away from it.
<P>The shaded ravine is probably where they (the snakes) hang out if it's hot out.
<P>The kids should be told to make lots of noise with their feet when they move through the brush, and to move slowly.  This will give the snakes ample warning and time to clear out.  It's a bad idea for them to run full-tilt through the brush.
<P>I imagine they have a somewhat competent hospital down there, which should be well-stocked with antivenin, since rattlers are common in most parts of Mexico.  The good news is that many rattlesnake bites do not involve the injection of venom.  The bad news is that kids, being small, are more susceptible to the venom than adults.
<P>In short, reasonable precautions should be sufficint to keep them safe, and the most important thing to do is to educate them about what to do it they see a rattlesnake:  watch, don't touch, and move away slowly.

Are all rattlesnakes shiny?  All the snakes in your pictures seem to have very shiny, 
almost oily-looking, skins.  I saw a dull gray snake with a diamond pattern, and was 
wondering if it was a rattlesnake.  I didn't see any rattles, and it was not 
aggressive.  I didn't get close to it, but my horse walked right up to it and sniffed 
it.  It just stayed very still until she left.  Sorry I couldn't get a picture to 
send you, but it moved off into the brush soon thereafter.
<P><UL><UL>
Melissa</UL></UL>

<P><I> Melissa,

<P>No rattlesnakes are shiny!  Rattlesnakes have keeled scales, 
which means they are rough and do not reflect light back directly. 
 In the right light, they can appear somewhat glossy, but in real life they are 
usually dull.  The snake you saw could have been a rattlesnake, but could also have 
been a bullsnake (or gopher snake - pituophis melanoleucis), which are very similar.

<P>Were there alternating black and white rings around its tail? 
 Many rattlesnakes have these rings, while gopher snakes do not.

<P>Also, where do you live, and what sort of terrain and elevation were you in when
 you saw the snake?  What was the temperature?  While rattlesnakes are not usually 
aggressive, they are more active and alert when warm, but if it was morning or a cold
 day, it could have been cold and sluggish.  Or, it could have eaten recently and felt
 full :-)  I'm sure you know the feeling...

<P>Dear Nick:

<P>I am a 2nd-grader at Countryside School in Champaign, Illinois.  I am  
doing a short paper on rattlesnake bites and how to cure them in the  
"old days" on the Oregon Trail.  Can you tell me what kind of methods  
they used to cure rattlesnake bites at that time?

<P>Thank you,
<UL><UL>
<P>Jessica
</UL></UL>
<P><I>Jessica - 

	
	<P>In frontier times, there were all sorts of crazy ideas about how to cure 
rattlesnake bite.  Sometimes, people drank lots of alcohol, which actually made things
 worse.  Sometimes, they slashed big cuts over the bites so that the blood would drain 
out faster and take the venom with it.  This would be helped along by somebody sucking
 out the venom.  Some people even believed that a second rattlesnake bite would cure 
the first!  Other treatments included putting things over the bite, including ammonia,
 tobacco juice, salt, iodine, or mud.  Of all these methods, the only one that is still
 recommended today is suction on the wound (though without slashing new cuts), which,
 if applied immediately, might be effective sometimes at removing a small amount of the 
venom.

	<P>Antivenins for rattlesnake venom began to be developed in the mid 
- 1920's, so they wouldn't have been available yet

	<P>In response to your other question, yes - you may print out or copy 
anything on my page, as long as you give me credit for the information (in other words,
 you have to tell people where you got the information).

<P>Is there anyway to keep rattlesnakes away?  Within one week we have found 
two rattlesnakes next to our house.  We live next to thick brush and 
there are some rock formation.  But we have kept the brush trimmed within 
20 feet of our home.  Also, I'm located in the San Diego,CA area and have 
seen rattlesnakes all my life.  Growing up I was told that King snakes 
and gopher snakes keep rattlesnakes away. Is this true? 

<P><UL><UL>-Gloria</UL></UL>

<P><I>Gloria,
<P>General rule of thumb for any wild animal is that they will stay away if there is nothing to attract them.  If they have food, water, shelter, or a good basking spot, then they will come around.  Limit their access to water, and reduce your rodent population, and they will probably leave...

<P>King snakes eat, among other things, rattlesnakes.  They also eat the rodents.  So, king snakes would probably help keep the population down a bit by doing both things.  But, it would be many hours work to catch them, and many dollars to buy them, so I'd start by trying to limit the access to food and water.  If you don't, you can clear out as many as you like, and more will come to fill the niche.

<P>Last night we watched a television program about rattlesnakes. I mentioned
that I had heard that you should not handle the rattles of snakes (once
they are dead) because the snake sharpened their fangs on their rattles and
small amounts of poison would leak onto the rattles.

<P>Did I hear right?

<P>I'd appreciate a response as my family acted like I was crazy last night
when I mentioned this.

<UL><UL><P>- Michele, Provo, Ut.</UL></UL>

<P><I>Michele, you fell prey to a tall tale.  Rattlesnakes do not sharpen their fangs - when one set wears out, it is replaced by a new set that grows in behind the old, much like sharks' teeth.  Incidentally, even if there were a small amount of venom on the rattles, it would be unlikely to be harmful unless rubbed in a fresh open wound.  Rattlesnake venom is digestible, and will not harm you if swallowed.<br><UL><UL>- Nick</I></UL></UL>

<P>Are there rattlesnakes in Sri Lanka?  I had thought 
them limited to the Western hemisphere, but a brief article in NEW 
SCIENTIST ("A kinder antidote to snakebite," 3 February 1996, p. 18)

useless."

 The longer and thicker the dog's hair, the less likely the snake will be able to insert a fang. 
 Thus, a St. Bernard could likely shrug off a minor bite, while a chihuahua might have little chance for survival.
<P>There is some evidence that once a dog has been bitten, if it survives, it will then have a partial immunity, and will then be more resistant to the venom. 
 This is true of humans, and also of horses (antivenin has long been produced by injecting horses with small amounts of venom until they develop an immunity. 
 The antibody-bearing serum is then drawn off to use for bite treatment).
<P>Antivenin can only be purchased by a doctor.  Check with your vet to see whether they keep it on hand, and whether they are familiar with its use.

<P>I have been enjoying your page on rattlesnakes. I do have a couple of 
questions.

<P>1. Are you aware of the species Crotalus cascavella? I have it listed in 
a homeopathic textbook as the Brazilian rattlesnake, and I noted that it 
was not included in your list. Does crotalus cascavella have another 
name?

<P>2. Could you share your tattoo design with me? I have been working on a 
crotalus horridus design to be on my left lower back for a while now and 
am interested in seeing how you solved some of the design problems I am 
having.

<P>How can you tell the age of a rattlesnake? I heard that you could by 
counting the number of rattles, but I'm not sure. Also, how often does a 
rattlesnake shed it's skin?
<P><UL><UL>- Chuck Anderson</UL></UL>
<P><I>Chuck,
<P>The last I know of (Klauber again), a way of positively determining the age of a rattlesnake had not been found, but some researchers had discovered 
that it is possible to analyze the growth pattens in the bones of the skull, much like counting tree rings 
(evidence seems to support the supposition that rattlesnakes grow throughout life).  
Estimates based on captive snakes give a life span of 20+ years, with sexual activity beginning at 4-5 years.  
Telling the age of a rattler encountered in the field is, therefore, nearly impossible.  
Provided one knows the species, size can give you perhaps the best indicator.

<P>Rattlers add a rattle segment each time they shed.  Shedding occurs frequently in the first two years of life (up to 3-4 times per year), and then slows down from there.
  Rattlers probably shed at least once per year, adults probably no more than 3 times a year in the wild.  
Captive snakes are a completely different story, as the warmth of their cage may allow year-round activity 
(as zoos become more and more sophisticated, some are beginning to put their animals through natural seasons, so a snake may spend 3-4 months in hibernation and then be gradually warmed in the spring).
  Captive snakes then may shed much more frequently.

<P>Added to all this confusion is the fact that snakes rarely have all their rattles.
  Dragging the rattle through the underbrush causes segments to break and fall away. 
 Again, captive snakes are far more likely to have complete rattles, as they lead a more protected life.
<P><UL><UL>-Nick</UL></UL></I>
<P><I>John Sealy, a researcher in NC, adds:
<P>Recent research allows some fair accuracy in age determination using 
the rattle.  To determine age a few things must be known however.  
Molting rates corelate to active season.  Molting occurs at a fairly 
consistent rate for each month the snake is out of hibernation. 
Molting on average is not particularly corelated to feeding rates.  
So, if a population's active time and molting rates are known then age 
can be determined.  There are some limitations.  For instance the 
rattle of C.h. tapers until about the 10th molt.  After the snake 
reaches terminal size, the rattle segments no longer show taper.  With 
experience we can accurately determine total molts, even if some 
segments are missing.  In other words if the rattle is not complete, 
but is tapered, total rattle segments ie molts can be determined.  
Additionally, if the rattle has no taper the snake has lost at least 
10 segments. Age can only be listed as older than the age of the 
estimate from segments lost and those remaining.  This is only for 
adults.  A snake that has not achieved full size and showing "say" one 
segment is a problem, taper cannot be determined.  However, age can be 
determined here as well.  A researcher has accumulated thousands of 
weight to length measurments of C.h. of known age. It differentiates 
between gravid, non-gravid and males. We constantly test this 
correlation with animals of known age. (those with full rattles in a 
population of known molting rate)  It is very accurate.</I><BR><BR>

<P><I>Jaap,
<P>Nothing of the sort has crossed my desktop, but perhaps some of my readers have heard something.
<P>Rattlesnake venom has been touted as a cure before (Klauber reports that there are some who believe that a
second rattlesnake bite will counteract the effects of the first!  This belief is probably based on the fact that venom is used in
the production of antivenin).  However, I know of no scientific study that has proven or attempted to prove the efficacy of
any venom as a curative agent.
<P>Let me take this opportunity to congratulate you on a wonderful web page on your research.  Anyone who hasn't seen it

Hello, my name is Russell and I would like to ask a question regarding 
the skeleton and its movements regarding the snake. I understand that a 
snake is composed of several vertebrae and along these vertebrae the ribs 
are placed in a degree similar to a humans rib cage. I know that these 
ribs are the reason the scutes of the rattlesnakes can bunch up in 
certain areas and relax in others and thus a rectilinear movement, found 
in all snakes, is achieved and enables the snake to progress foward and 
to even swim. However, my question is more specifically in regards to the 
degree in which the ribs are able to move fowards and backwards as well 
as contract in a direction into the center of the body as well as relax 
or extend outwards. I would like to know perhaps the actual or average 
length or the degree of arc created in each pair of ribs as it moves 
because all bones in a snake are limited in movement. So generally, I 
would like to know the small degree in which the snake moves it one 
isolated set of ribs in all the directions. If you can help me it would 
be greatly appreciated as my resources here at the University of Illinois 
are failing me.
 <UL><UL>
Thank you<BR>

<I>
Russell,
<P>According to Klauber, the ribs do not change position relative to the vertebral column during rectilinear motion.
  The motion is achieved through reciprocating movements between the snake's skin and it's body.
	This is not to say that there is no freedom of movement at the junction between rib and vertebra.
  Snakes breathe much as mammals do, the rib cage expanding and contracting with each breath.
  A large meal will require a certain anount of expansion of the rib cage as well.
	I have no figures for you on exact range of motion. 
 However, I imagine that this data exists for snakes in general, and that figures for other snake families would be similar.
  You might look for a text on ophidian anatomy.<BR>

<P>Where are rattlesnakes distributed in British Columbia Canada? Both in 
what regions and how are they distributed along an elevational gradient?
<UL><UL>
	-Shade Teague<BR>
</UL></UL>

<P><I>Shade,
<P>From what I can glean, it appears that there are only four species that occur in Canada, and these are in the southern portion, to wit:
<P>Crotalus viridus oreganus is found in Southern BC.  According to Klauber, the distribution is within a triangle formed by Lilloooet-Shushwap Lake-Osoyoos, and east along the US border to Christina lake.
<P>Crotalus viridus viridus is found in Southwestern Sasketchawan (South of the South Sasketchawan river and West of longitude 107 degrees, 30 minutes W), and Southeastern Alberta  (South of the red deer river and East of longitude 113 degrees W)
<P>Crotalus horridus horridus was found several decades ago on the shore of Lake Erie, but at the time was scarce, and is probably extinct in that area now.
<P>Sistrurus catenatus catenatus has been found in Southern Ontario, on the shores of Georgian bay, Lake Huron, and Lake Erie.  Also on the Prince Edward Peninsula in Lake Ontario.
<P>As far north as Canada, it is likely that the snakes will be found mostly at lower elevations.  Snakes are temperature-sensitive, and below a certain temperature, they cannot function at all (optimum temperature for most species of Rattlesnake is 75-85 degrees fahrenheit).  It is doubtful that you would encounter any below 50 degrees.  I'm not sure how this correlates with altitude in your neck of the great white north, but suffice to say that rattlesnakes are uncommon in Canada at all, and the greater the elevation, the lower the temperature, and thus the lower the chance of encountering snakes.

<P>Phil,
<P>When I was doing the initial research on rattlesnake-related web pages, I found a whole usenet discussion on this subject.  Even though I'm both a musician and a crotalophile, I  saw this as peripheral to my purpose, so I didn't bookmark any of it.  You might try searching using Lycos for "rattlesnake."  As I recall, it was either Lycos or Webcrawler who returned that thread.  Actually, if you have been searching for this information for 6 months or more, it might have been your usenet postings I was reading...

Off the top of my head, I would suggest folklore societies rather than either music or rattlesnake resources.  For example, the Northwest Folklife Festival staff has a number of people who probably could put you on the correct trail.  (206) 684-7300.

My father-in-law found a rattler on his ranch 10 miles east of Ensenada 
in Mexico, up in the hills, and is concerned since his grandkids will be 
visiting soon.  

<P>His Mexican friend called it "cascabel serpiente", and he's not sure if 
that just literally means "rattlesnake" or is a specific type.  The 
snake appeared to have whitish rings, recognizable diamonds and rattles. 
 It was about 3-4 feet long and lived at 1000'-1500' elevation.

<P>The question is, how dangerous is this type of snake and its venom?
How can he minimize risk of snakes to 3 rambunctions 5 to 8 year olds 
who like to explore:  avoiding certain terrain, clearing brush, certain 
times of day, etc.

<P>There is a shaded ravine in the center of the property -- would they be 
more or less likely to be there?

<P>Are there any animals or pets that would encourage the snakes to live 
elsewhere?  What action should be taken in case of snakebite, for kids 
or adults?  Are anti-venom injections available?

<P>Thanks in advance.
<UL><UL>-Mark Saltveit<BR>
<A HREF = "mailto: msalt@well.com">msalt@well.com</A>
</UL></UL>
<P><I>Mark,

<P>Cascabel is Spanish for "little bell", or rattle, and serpiente is Spanish for "snake"  hence it means literally "rattle snake."  
<P>Any rattlesnake is dangerous, and the kids should be warned about them and told how to deal with them - ie if they hear the rattle, they should stand still until they see where the snake is, and then slowly back away from it.
<P>The shaded ravine is probably where they (the snakes) hang out if it's hot out.
<P>The kids should be told to make lots of noise with their feet when they move through the brush, and to move slowly.  This will give the snakes ample warning and time to clear out.  It's a bad idea for them to run full-tilt through the brush.
<P>I imagine they have a somewhat competent hospital down there, which should be well-stocked with antivenin, since rattlers are common in most parts of Mexico.  The good news is that many rattlesnake bites do not involve the injection of venom.  The bad news is that kids, being small, are more susceptible to the venom than adults.
<P>In short, reasonable precautions should be sufficint to keep them safe, and the most important thing to do is to educate them about what to do it they see a rattlesnake:  watch, don't touch, and move away slowly.

Are all rattlesnakes shiny?  All the snakes in your pictures seem to have very shiny, 
almost oily-looking, skins.  I saw a dull gray snake with a diamond pattern, and was 
wondering if it was a rattlesnake.  I didn't see any rattles, and it was not 
aggressive.  I didn't get close to it, but my horse walked right up to it and sniffed 
it.  It just stayed very still until she left.  Sorry I couldn't get a picture to 
send you, but it moved off into the brush soon thereafter.
<P><UL><UL>
Melissa</UL></UL>

<P><I> Melissa,

<P>No rattlesnakes are shiny!  Rattlesnakes have keeled scales, 
which means they are rough and do not reflect light back directly. 
 In the right light, they can appear somewhat glossy, but in real life they are 
usually dull.  The snake you saw could have been a rattlesnake, but could also have 
been a bullsnake (or gopher snake - pituophis melanoleucis), which are very similar.

<P>Were there alternating black and white rings around its tail? 
 Many rattlesnakes have these rings, while gopher snakes do not.

<P>Also, where do you live, and what sort of terrain and elevation were you in when
 you saw the snake?  What was the temperature?  While rattlesnakes are not usually 
aggressive, they are more active and alert when warm, but if it was morning or a cold
 day, it could have been cold and sluggish.  Or, it could have eaten recently and felt
 full :-)  I'm sure you know the feeling...

<P>Dear Nick:

<P>I am a 2nd-grader at Countryside School in Champaign, Illinois.  I am  
doing a short paper on rattlesnake bites and how to cure them in the  
"old days" on the Oregon Trail.  Can you tell me what kind of methods  
they used to cure rattlesnake bites at that time?

<P>Thank you,
<UL><UL>
<P>Jessica
</UL></UL>
<P><I>Jessica - 

	
	<P>In frontier times, there were all sorts of crazy ideas about how to cure 
rattlesnake bite.  Sometimes, people drank lots of alcohol, which actually made things
 worse.  Sometimes, they slashed big cuts over the bites so that the blood would drain 
out faster and take the venom with it.  This would be helped along by somebody sucking
 out the venom.  Some people even believed that a second rattlesnake bite would cure 
the first!  Other treatments included putting things over the bite, including ammonia,
 tobacco juice, salt, iodine, or mud.  Of all these methods, the only one that is still
 recommended today is suction on the wound (though without slashing new cuts), which,
 if applied immediately, might be effective sometimes at removing a small amount of the 
venom.

	<P>Antivenins for rattlesnake venom began to be developed in the mid 
- 1920's, so they wouldn't have been available yet

	<P>In response to your other question, yes - you may print out or copy 
anything on my page, as long as you give me credit for the information (in other words,
 you have to tell people where you got the information).

<P>Is there anyway to keep rattlesnakes away?  Within one week we have found 
two rattlesnakes next to our house.  We live next to thick brush and 
there are some rock formation.  But we have kept the brush trimmed within 
20 feet of our home.  Also, I'm located in the San Diego,CA area and have 
seen rattlesnakes all my life.  Growing up I was told that King snakes 
and gopher snakes keep rattlesnakes away. Is this true? 

<P><UL><UL>-Gloria</UL></UL>

<P><I>Gloria,
<P>General rule of thumb for any wild animal is that they will stay away if there is nothing to attract them.  If they have food, water, shelter, or a good basking spot, then they will come around.  Limit their access to water, and reduce your rodent population, and they will probably leave...

<P>King snakes eat, among other things, rattlesnakes.  They also eat the rodents.  So, king snakes would probably help keep the population down a bit by doing both things.  But, it would be many hours work to catch them, and many dollars to buy them, so I'd start by trying to limit the access to food and water.  If you don't, you can clear out as many as you like, and more will come to fill the niche.

Rattlesnake FAQ
</Title>
<Body bgcolor = "FFFFFFFFFFFF">
<H1>Rattlesnake FAQts</H1>
<B><I>Trivia - Vocabulary - Miscellany</B></I><BR><BR> <BR>
<img src = "rattle.gif"> <Font size = +2>F</Font>ear of snakes is called <I>Ophidiophobia</I><BR><BR>
<img src = "rattle.gif"> <Font size = +2>I</font>t is never safe to pick up a rattlesnake!  They are wonderful creatures to observe and to study, but they are not pets.  They do not deserve the hatred and fear that they are often accorded. They do deserve your respect.
<BR><BR><img src = "rattle.gif"><Font size = +2>B</Font>aby Rattlesnakes are formed within eggs, but the eggs hatch while still within the female.  The young are born live.  Thus the rattlesnake is both <I>oviparous</I> (egg-bearing) and <I>viviparous</I> (live-bearing).  This quality is called <I>ovoviviparity</I>
<BR><BR><img src = "rattle.gif"><Font size = +2>R</Font>attlesnakes have one of the most evolved venom-injection methods of any venomous creature.  The fangs lie flat against the roof of the mouth, and fold out for use.  A snake with this type of dentition is referred to as a <I>solenoglyph.</I>
<BR><BR><img src = "rattle.gif"><Font size = +2>A</Font> rattlesnake is born with a button on the end of its tail.  With its first shedding, it gains its first rattle segment, and it gains a new one each time it sheds.  Because a snake can shed its skin several times a year at a rate that is different for each individual, and because rattle segments frequently break off, there is no correlation between the number of rattles and a snake's age.
<BR><BR><img src = "rattle.gif"><Font size = +2>R</Font>attlesnakes in captivity have developed rattles with as many as thirteen segments
<BR><BR><img src = "rattle.gif"><Font size = +2>T</Font>he rattle of a rattlesnake doesn't sound much like a rattle.  It sounds more like frying bacon!  Here is an example:
<L1><A HREF ="http://info.fuw.edu.pl/multimedia/sounds.animals/rattlesnake.au">Rattlesnake sound</A></L1></UL></UL>
<BR><img src = "rattle.gif"><Font size = +2>T</Font>he striking range of a large (6') adult rattlesnake is approximately 3' - half the length of its body.  A rattlesnake cannot launch itself into the air!  A rattlesnake has enough energy for two or three strikes, but then must rest, and can strike only feebly.  The strike and the venom evolved for hunting purposes, and are only used in self-defense as a last resort.  First, the snake will put up a fearsome display (the coil, the rattle), and if possible, try to escape.
<BR><BR><img src = "rattle.gif"><Font size = +2>W</Font>hen in defense posture, a rattlesnake's tongue extends fully, and flaps up and down at a rate of about twice per second.
<BR><BR><img src = "rattle.gif"><Font size = +2>L</Font>ike other snakes, a rattlesnake uses its tongue to smell.  The tongue is composed of two slender cylinders which part at the tip (hence the forked appearance), which are contained in a sheath in the floor of the mouth.  They flick in and out of the mouth quickly, bringing samples of the outside air and its smells to a special organ, called <I>Jacobsen's organ</I>, which relays information to the brain about smells in the environment.  Rattlesnakes are also members of the <B>Pit viper</B> subfamily, possessing special organs, called pit organs, located on either side of the snout.  These organs are heat-sensitive, and allow the snake to track, locate, and capture its prey in total darkness.
<BR><BR><img src = "rattle.gif"><Font size = +2>R</Font>attlesnakes are extremely curious about the world around them.  Once, while I was hunting sidewinders to photograph in Eastern California, I was out walking in the desert at night.  I was following my footprints from the previous night's junket, and I came across a footprint that told an amazing story.  A snake track led right up to the print, where the snake had carefully investigated my scent, and (probably)the lingering warmth from my foot's brief contact with the sand, as evidenced by the sweeping strokes that almost obliterated the print.  The track then continued in a sinuous line away from my footprint.  It gave me a chill to think that, while I was studying them, they were just as carefully studying me! Click <A HREF = "footpr.gif">here</A> to see my photo of the footprint.
<BR><BR><img src = "rattle.gif"><Font size = +2>R</Font>attlesnakes are highly adaptive.  Different species of rattlesnakes can be <I>diurnal </I>(active during the day), <I>nocturnal </I>(active during the night), or <I>crepuscular </I>(active at dawn and/or dusk), depending on the climate, the season, and the needs of the particular species with regards to regulating body warmth, and availablility of prey.  
<BR><BR><img src = "rattle.gif"><Font size = +2>R</Font>attlesnakes are primarily <I>thigmothermic</I>, receiving warmth primarily from contact with warm surfaces, and only use <I>heliothermic</I> means (i.e. basking in the sun) as a secondary way of maintaining body temperature.
<BR><BR><img src = "rattle.gif"><Font size = +2>A</Font> personal observation:  Being both a <I>crotalophile</I> (rattlesnake lover) and cat lover, I have repeatedly observed the similarities between rattlers and tabby cats.  To wit: <UL><L1><UL><L1><B>Markings:</B> blotched, irregular concentric diamonds, a distinctive stripe pattern on the face, and concentric banding on the tail.<BR></L1><L1>  <B>Eyes:</B> luminescent yellow, with vertical slits.</L1><BR><L1> <B>Behavior:</B> seeks warmth, will readily allow itself to be held because of this, but is rather aloof and fickle about when it wants to be held. </L1><BR><L1> <B>Bites:</B> are nasty.  Sheaths of bacteria on the teeth are injected under  the skin of prey when biting, helping to break down the tissues for consumption. </L1></UL></L1></UL><BR> While there is no reason to believe that rattlesnakes and tabby cats share a common evolutionary ancestor, I feel that this is compelling evidence for the concept of parallel development: i.e. a good evolutionary trick (deceptive coloration for camoflage, a septic bite to kill prey) works just as well for a mammal as it does for a reptile.
<BR><BR><img src = "rattle.gif"><Font size = +2>R</Font>attlesnakes cannot, and need not, dig their own dens.  They take over the dens of rodents they prey on.  
<BR><BR><img src = "rattle.gif"><Font size = +2>R</Font>attlesnakes have four distinct methods of locomotion, which are used to a greater or lesser degree by all members of the genera:
<UL><L1><UL><L1><B><A HREF = "undtrk.gif">Undulatory:</A></B> The most common and familiar form of snake locomotion, where the body takes a sinuous path as the snake uses rocks, protrusions, piles of dirt, grass or other vegetation to push and pull its way along.</L1>
<BR><L1><B>Accordion:</B> where a slow, steady approach is necessary over a small distance (as in stalking prey), or where there is very little traction, the rattlesnake may form its body into accordion pleats, plant the rear half, pick up and move the front half forward, pick up and move the rear half forward, and repeat this action, much as an inchworm moves, with the exception that the body is pleated horizontally on the ground rather than held vertically in a loop.</L1>
<BR><L1><B>Rectilinear:</B> The snake's belly scutes pull the snake along in a straight line, lifting to get a purchase, then pushing back to propel the body forward.</L1>
<BR><L1><B><A HREF = "sidetrk.gif">Sidewinding:</A></B> Practiced by the desert dweller <I>C. Cerastes</I>, the snake picks up and sets down its body in a looping motion, a method of locomotion well suited to a loose, shifting medium like sand.</L1></UL></L1></UL>
<img src = "rattle.gif"><Font size = +2>M</Font>ale rattlesnakes perform an intriguing dance, which is believed to be a way of establishing dominance for mating and/or territorial purposes (much like the head-butting contests of the horned mammals).  In the dance, the snakes will twine around each other, raise up to full height face to face, and generally look very much as if they are preparing to mate.  Only males participate in this dance.  Click <A HREF = "dance.gif">here</A> for a picture of one of the "steps" in this dance.
<BR><BR><img src = "rattle.gif"><Font size = +2>T</Font>he male rattlesnake has two penises, called <I>hemipenes</I>, each of which is bifurcated, giving the appearance of four organs.
<BR><BR><img src = "rattle.gif"><Font size = +2>R</Font>attlesnake venom is less potent than that of the honeybee.  It is the quantity of venom that makes the rattlesnake's bite more dangerous.

<P>Nick

 <P>I am curious as to whether or not you have any sources of info on efforts to 
classify the Canebrake as a separate subspecies. I have a two year old 
specimen, which basing on color pattern alone it is definitly distinct from 
northern subspecies I have encountered in Pennsylvania. I want to find out if 
color markings alone were the basis for the subspecies classification or if 
there were other differences noted

<P><I>Matthew,

	

<P>According to Klauber, horridus horridus has 23 dorsal scale rows, with an indistinct postocular dark stripe and
 a low degree of contrast between the pattern and body color.  Horridus atricaudatus has generally 25 dorsal scale rows,
 with a distinct dark postocular stripe and sharp contrast between body color and pattern.  Whether this information has 
been found to be false since his writing, I don't know...

<P>
I just read the information in your LMK Memorial page.  You mentioned a 
"Tucson Desert Museum".  In the decades I've lived here in Tucson, I 
haven't discovered a place by this name.  Did you mean the Arizona-Sonora 
Desert Museum, about 20 miles west of Tucson?  It does sort of fit your 
description.
<P>They do have a good collection, but they don't have the best display of that
collection.  They also have some top-notch herp people on their staff, but
the politics of running a museum restrict what they (the herp people) can
do.  I used to do volunteer work for the museum, but gave it up because the
politics disgusted me.  At the time I left, they had the only captive
breeding population of San Esteban Island Chuckwallas.  They had a large,
natural looking enclosure for them, a curator who wanted to run a major
study on all aspects of territoriallity, courtship, and breeding, and a crew
of volunteers to help with the study.  A consultant on public zoo displays
walked through the museum, and told the board of directors that "it didn't
look good" to have the study animals on display.  Zip.  The study ended
until the curator was able to come up with some other off-exhibit facilities.  

<P>There has been talk of them building another reptile display building, but I
don't think that's in the immediate future.  Meanwhile, (in agreement with a
portion of your description) the already high entry fees keep going up,
again based on what they are told by their zoo display consultant.

<P>Changing topics slightly - I would suspect, from the nature of your
homepage, that you keep or work with rattlesnakes.  If so, what sort of work
do you do with them?

<P><UL><UL>Bill</UL></UL>

<P><I>Bill,

<P>Thank you for the correction - I am talking about the ASDM.  
I looked and looked for the information I used to have about it, and couldn't find it, 
so I relied on my (faulty) memory.  I have also since had correspondence from a herper
 who thought it was one of the two the best reptile collections he's seen.  If I'm down 
your way again, I'll have to give it another try.  Maybe I hit it on a bad day...
<P>It is truly a sad thing when politics dictate funding and display.  Unfortunately, 
it is something that reseach, education, and the arts share - the need to be subsidized,
 which means the need to ask for handouts, which means politics - the machine that
 decides distribution of funds - gets involved.  
(see <A HREF = "http://www.seeport.com/staff/dallett/me13.htm" target = "_top">http://www.seeport.com/staff/dallett/me13.htm</A>)

<P>We just returned from a vacation in So. Cal., and we went to the San Diego Zoo,
 which had very well cared-for rattlers, but with very little labeling, so it was
 difficult to learn anything from the displays.  One of the enclosures was labeled 
simply "rattlesnakes."  Inside were several different species...

<P>As for work, I am an animal control officer, but in an area where there are no
 poisonous snakes (Washington's Olympic Peninsula).  So, I am mostly an armchair herper.
  On our trip, we did get to help a very pretty young c. ruber across the road in the 
Anza Borreo desert.  Several cars stopped while we were at it, and it became an 
opportunity to educate!   I grew up in Southern Cal., and was always warned away from 
them, so I suppose I'm rebelling against that fear in my adulthood (?).

<P>Hi Nick,

<P>To settle a bet, would you please let me know how fast a rattlesnake can 
"run"?

<P>My friend and I are debating on whether a man can outrun a rattlesnake, 
so a follow up question would be "How determined can a snake be to 
bite someone?"

<P><UL><UL>- Michael</UL></UL>
<P><I> Michael,
<P>If a rattlesnake trained for months, it could probably reach the blinding speed of about 3 miles per hour.  In other words,
 you could "outrun" it by walking your normal pace.

<P>Rattlesnakes do not want to bite humans - they go out of their way to avoid it - so there is no reason they would be 
chasing you in the first place...

<P>Nick,
<P>There isn't much information on the Web re:rattlers.. found your site to 
be interesting and informative. 

<P>I'm a reporter from Indianapolis and I had heard that there were people 
in southern Indiana who are "snakecharmers" i.e. they use rattlesnakes as 
part of their worship,etc....

<P>Got any information that could help me find the closest people who do 
this kind of stuff?????

<P>I would like to ask if you know of any techniques of catching rattlers in 
the field and field dressing them, strictly for their meat? Wait, also is 
this poaching...? Thank you.
<P><UL><UL>-No name given</UL></UL>

<I><P>Dressing a snake for food is simple - skin the snake, and remove the head.  The
entrails come neatly out of the body cavity, leaving the meat, which should be cooked
and eaten off the bones.
<P>Personally,  I don't feel that rattlers should be taken from the wild for food.
 While rattlesnakes are considered a nuisance in many places, they are wildlife, and as such are
protected in many places.  At least one species - the New Mexican ridgenosed rattler -
is on the Endangered Species List.
<P>Check with your State Department of Fish and Wildlife about whether it is legal to
catch and kill rattlesnakes for food.

<P>Sir; Is it legal to keep captive Rattlesnakes in California? I have recently
accuired a Mojave. I have kept them before while living on my remote desert
ranch. I am now living in a small Southern California High Desert town and I
am now concerned 
about the legal aspects.    <P>Thank You, 
<P><UL><UL>-Little Joe </UL></UL>
<P><I>Joe,
<P>Local laws and Ordinances regarding Exotic and/or Venomous pets vary greatly from
one region to the next.  You will need to check three places for this information.  First,
your state law (check with the State Department of Fish and Wildlife), next, the County
law, and finally City or local law.  Your nearest animal shelter or SPCA may be able to
help you with these last two.  Alternatively, you could check with a dealer who sells
reptiles.  A reputable dealer should be up on all aspects of law regarding exotics.

<P>My goofy grandson brought into his house a  3 foot Pennsylvania rattler 
for his little girls to see. Which they did---and made appropriate 
little girl noises and so on. Quite naturally, the makeshift cage didn't 
cage very well and said snake was last seen entering the space between 
floor and ceiling below and now all ladies refuse to go home from 
mother's place and grandpap(me) has been summond to deal with the 
crises. I claim the snake doesn't want to be there and is probably gone 
and WON'T stay unless he has food and water and/or girl snakes..I know 
gasolene will drive him out( if he's there ) but that way is also a good 
way to burn down the house....Any suggestions or info will be greatly 
appreciated.....

<P><I>Grampa Wolf,
<P>Well, you are right, of course - he doesn't want to be there, and wants to leave.  
The bad news is that snakes will hide in dark corners for long periods of time, and sometimes emerge when
 least expected (causing little girl noises from grown men, sometimes).  The good news is that if there is a way out, the 
snake has probably found it.

<P>As for gasoline, it might drive it out, or it might just make it sick.  And, as you note, there is the fire danger.

<P>You might want to call your local animal control or nuisance wildlife specialist 
and get some more specialized information.  I am not very familiar with extracting snakes from floors 
(although I have had snakes get away, and I suspect that is where they escaped to).

<P>Nick,

<P>I'm curious to know where you obtain your information?  My dog 
recently was bit by a baby rattlesnake.  She survived but is it true 
that babies have a more toxic venom than adults?  I also discovered 
that my dog cannot have anti-venom twice.  She apparently could have a 
violent reaction.

	<P><UL><UL>-Tiffany Hoss</UL></UL>

<P><I>Tiffany - 

<P>	It is generally taken as fact that baby rattlers have a more potent venom 
(although I don't know off the top of my head whether research supports this). 
 It stands to reason that they would evolve that way, as the babies are the most vulnerable individuals in the population.
  That is balanced, though, by the relatively small amount of venom they are able to deliver (because they are so small).
  So, though your dog received what might have been a more potent venom, she received certainly less than she would
 have from an adult snake, all other things being equal.

<P>As for my source of information, it is primarily Laurence Klauber's "Rattlesnakes:  Their Habits, Life Histories, 
and Influence on Mankind, which is the standard work on rattlesnakes.  
Other sources of information include my personal experience, common sense, other experts, and, in the case of dogs,
 four years experience as an animal control officer, which includes observation and performance of emergency 
veterinary procedures.

<P>Your story was so interesting that it has earned its own space
 in the section of my page devoted to rattlesnake bites.  You can link to it from <A HREF = "dogbite.htm">HERE.</A>

<P>Hi Nick,

<P>Have a question for you that actually comes from my parents. Here's 
what my dad e-mailed me:

<UL>>Please look this one up (on Alameda Creek Trail).  
It was about 2.5 <BR>>ft long, had dark brown and light brown coloration in kind of a<BR>
 >diamond pattern, but smaller pattern than on a diamondback.  It<BR>
>did have jowls like a venomous snake, and it turned back on Lee like <BR>
>it was pissed off and was ready for combat.  No rattles visible. <BR> 
>Very slow, like it didn't give a s*** (porcupine style).<BR>
</UL> 


<P>Okay. Questions:
<UL>
<LI>Are all snakes whose heads are shaped like a pit viper poisonous?

<LI>Are there pit vipers in California (East Bay Area) that don't have 
rattles?

<LI>If this snake was a young rattlesnake, is there an easy explanation 
for why it didn't have rattles?
(For instance, the snake might actually have had the beginnings of 
rattles, but perhaps they were difficult to see?)
</UL>

<P>In any case, I hope you can help us out. We're eternally curious about 
the animals that we meet when we're outside.

<P>And thanks for the great site you've put together. Really nice work.


<P><UL><UL>Jody Sumrall</UL></UL>

<P><I>Jody, 

<P>I have two words for you - <B>Pituophis Melanoleucus!</B>

<P>Now, I can't be positive without seeing it, but that's probably what your dad saw - 
otherwise known as a gopher or bull snake.  They do a very good job of imitating 
rattlesnakes - 
down to the practice of wiggling their tail very fast in the brush to make a 
rattling sound.  
The patterns are very similar, and the shape of the head is very similar.  
They are found throughout California.

<P>The two things that gopher snakes lack are 1) Pits, and 2) Rattles (they also lack fangs and venom, 
but I'm just mentioning the things that you could check without a visit to the Emergency room).  
The pits are organs located in the front of the skull, and look like enormous nostrils.  The rattles sometimes break off,
 but when they do, they leave behind a single blunt segment that is part of the tail.  
A gopher snake would have a tapered tail.  Also, on rattlesnakes, the tail is very often banded with black and white.
  In gopher snakes, the body pattern continues down to the tail tip.

<P>If it were a young rattlesnake, at 2 1/2 feet long, it would have already had a few rattles, 
unless it had the entire string broken off.  Rattlesnakes gain a rattle segment every time they shed.

<P>The two other pit vipers in the US - Cottonmouths and Copperheads - like to hang out east of the Rockies
 (probably because we call them names like Copperhead and Cottonmouth).

<P>Just a reminder of the obvious - be extremely careful about any snake you're not sure of. 
 Look it over carefully before you decide it's just a gopher snake and grab it :-)

<P>Hope this helps...

<P>Nick;

<P>living on the outskirts of Los Angeles, in the hills, surrounded by 
brush, we get a lot of rattlers on our property each year. we are trying 
to get rid of them by killing off the rats and mice. In the meantime, it 
is necessary every once in awhile to remove a rattler from our patio. Do 
you have a source for snake handling tools? The ones I've seen have 
either pinchers or a noose at the end of a long rod...

<P>Thanks for your help!

<P><UL><UL>Gary</UL></UL>

<P><I>Or, even easier, a snake hook, which just slips under the snake (the snake then balances on the hook). 
 There are several sources of these items.  Two that come to mind are Campbell Enterprises (Brush Prairie, Washington),
 and Animal Care Equipment and Services (ACES), in Crestline, Ca:  ACES can be reached at:

<P>Nick,
  <P>My home is in Tucson, AZ and backs up to a ravine at the foot of Pucsh
Ridge in the Santa Catalina mountains.  I recognize that part of the
trade-off for our beautiful, unobstructed view is having "close encounters"
with native wildlife.  We've seen a Gila Monster, javelina, quail,
roadrunners, rabbits, etc.  Although our neighbors warned us about rattlers,
we had never seen one until three weeks ago.  Since then we have had a 31/2
foot rattlesnake in the front yard at dusk; a 4 foot bull snake in the back
yard checking out our pet door; and lastly just three days ago, a 6 foot
rattler in the front yard, again at dusk.  We are currently in a drought
here; even the cactus are suffering.  We do have a pool, but the rattlers
have all been in front.  I know I can't necessarily prevent the rattlers, but
is there something that might be attracting them specifically to our front
yard?  I have a 22 month old toddler, and we are more than a little nervous.
 If we are inadvertantly attracting the rattlers, I would very much like to
know.
  <P>I enjoyed your web site.  I got much more info there than I did from our
local EMT's about emergency bite procedures, etc.  Thanks.
                                                       <P><UL><UL>Kathleen</UL></UL>

<P><I>Kathleen,
<P>Thanks for the compliments!
<P>Wild animals respond to three things - food, water, and shelter.  So, if they are coming to your house,
 then they are looking for one or the other of those things, or a combination.  

<P>Another part of the puzzle is that depending on the time of year, rattlesnakes will be active at one particular time, 
when the temperature is in their preferred operating range (~65 to 80 degrees, give or take five or ten...)  

<P>Since it can be too hot for them during the day this time of year, they will often become active at dusk. 
 This also happens to coincide with the peak activity of their favorite food source - rodents.  So,
 if this has been happening since the weather got hot (3 weeks ago sounds right), it probably just indicates that 
you are seeing them when they are the most active.

<P>My educated guess would be that you have rats or mice under your house, or around the yard.   
So, you are indirectly providing food for the snakes (both the rattlers and the bullsnakes - bet you start seeing king 
snakes too, which eat other snakes as well as rodents!).  Hence, the way to discourage the snakes is to stop attracting
 the mice and rats.

<P>The next question, of course, is what is attracting the mice and rats.  I'll bet the pet door is near the kitchen :-). 
 Or possibly near where you store the pet food.  Or both.  Start keeping the pet food in a covered trash bin. 
 I'm sure an exterminator would be happy to consult with you by phone on how best to stop attracting rodents to the
 house.  NOTE: You probably don't notice that you have rats and mice around.  That's because you have snakes keeping
 the population under control!

<P>Now - the big one.  The pool.  You live in an arid area (ever wonder, though, why they made those idiotic underpasses
 downtown that get flooded when it rains??), so water is at a premium.  Just the scent of that water - the humidity it gives
 to the surrounding air - will be enough to attract every living critter in the desert to your back patio.  
If you picture your area from above, you can probably picture how snakes and javalinas and gila monsters and etc.
 and etc. would make a beeline for that humid air.  Very likely those snakes in the front yard were on their way to the
 back yard.

<P>This is all just educated guesses, based on knowledge, experience, and a good measure of intuition...  
Hope it is of some help.   You might want to ask other pool owners around if they are experiencing the same thing.

<P>This is not a question...just a thank you.  Having encountered 2 timber
rattlers within 2 hours on a backpacking trip last weekend (VA Blue Ridge), I
realized that I was too ignorant for my own good!  The first snake was
sprawled across the trail and saw me before I saw it.  When it coiled about 2
feet off the path, my companion and I felt pretty stupid...we had visions of
those snakes on the Nature Channel in slo-mo  flying thru the air to strike
their victims.  We had NO idea how close we could safely pass, and
bushwacking off the trail and thru mountain laurel thickets was out of the
question.  We learned that after a 15 minute stand-off the snake would just
leave.</P>

<P>Made it easier when we found another at our campsite.  At least we knew by
then that the snake wanted nothing to do with us and wasn't a threat as long
as we didn't step on it in the dark!! </P>

<P>I've searched bookstores for more info...have been determined to know more
about rattlers before our next trip!!  I could find very little information
about how to handle encounters and what to expect.  Until I found your web
site, that is.</P>

<P>So this is a very longwinded way to thank you for educating us.  I'll be back
for more visits and will share your web address with my hiking friends.</P>

<P>I have a 4 year old and a 6mth old.  My biggest concern is their safety. 
Do you have any info on fatilities from rattlesnake bites to children?  
I've also heard baby/small rattlesnakes are potentially deadly because 
they inject all of their venom - is this true?  Final question: How far 
vertical (ie, up the leg) can a rattlesnake bite.  Will boots protect me 
in the "brushy"/dense areas of my yard.</P>

<P>Thanks,</P>
<UL><UL>Dave Smith</UL></UL>
<P><I>Dave,</P>
<P>I don't have any specific stats on bites to children, but I can give you some guidelines which might be more useful.
  The operant concept here is the ratio between amount of venom injected and body weight.  
Thus, the smaller the child, the greater the danger from any particular snake bite.</P>

<P>You are also correct about baby rattlers.  Their venom is more potent, though they have very little of it compared to adult
 snakes.  They are also more aggressive - nature's way of ensuring that they survive to adulthood.</P>

<P>Here is my advice for protecting your and your childrens' safety:</P>
<OL>
<LI> Contact the emergency room of your nearest hospital and find out their protocol 
for treating rattlesnake bites - ie in the event of a bite, how should you act to best
 help them to treat the bite victim.  Also find out if they keep antivenin on hand,
 or if they order it from a central source in the event of a bite.  Find out if they 
need to know what specific species inflicted the bite, or if they use a polyvalent that
 covers all the local species.  This information may or may not be helpful to you, but 
it will help you to feel more at ease when and if confronted with an actual bite 
situation.</LI> 

<LI>  Keep the brush trimmed down close to the house to make 
the immedtate area less attractive to rodents, and therefore less attractive to the 
snakes that prey on them.</LI> 

<LI>  When walking in the brush, stomp and shuffle your feet loudly.  
If the snakes hear you coming, they will move out of your way. Walk slowly to give them
 time to move away.</LI> 

<LI>  Most important, it is a good idea to teach your kids about safe observation of 
rattlesnakes without being paranoid about them.  On the whole, rattlers rarely bite, 
and the bites are rarely serious.  Most bites occur when someone is intentionally 
handling a snake.  A rattlesnake will go out of its way to avoid you, so except for the
 springtime, when the babies are prone to be aggressive, there is little danger of
 running into one unexpectedly.  Best advice is to use reasonable caution when prowling
 around in rattlesnake territory.</LI> </OL>

<P>Can a rattlesnake rattle while it's moving, or is it only possible for the 
snake to rattle while it is coiled?</P>

<UL><UL>-Jim Riley</UL></UL>

<I><P>Jim,</P>
<P>Well, kind of like the ability to rub one's tummy and pat one's head at the same time, 
this probably differs from snake to snake.  I have seen  snakes rattle as they run, but this was just a quick buzz,
 not an extended sizzle like a coiled snake.  The rattle is generally used in conjunction with a flapping tongue and the 
coil, so I imagine the snake's physiology is set up to make it significantly easier to rattle for longer periods when in the
 defensive coil.</P>

<P>So, the simple answer is yes, a rattlesnake can rattle almost any time.  But if the snake is aroused enough to rattle
 extensively, it will probably also assume the coil and other defensive displays.</P>

my 5 year old son would like to know the answer to the question, " if one 
rattle snake bites another, will the bitten one die or will the poison 
have any effect on it ? "
-Gary Tinnel

<I><P>Gary,</P>
<P>Rattlesnakes have a very high resistance to their own venom, but are not completely immune. 
 when a rattlesnake is bitten by another rattlesnake, or if a rattlesnake accidentally bites itself, it is very likely that the
 wound will swell up just as it would in a human, but deaths due to this are probably very rare. 
 So, the effects are halfway between your son's suggestions, i.e. it would hurt them, but probably not kill them.</P>

<P>We live in the southeast corner of South Dakota by the Missouri river 
across from Sioux City, Iowa.  One of our neighbors reported seeing a 
rattlesnake in their grill and released it into the woods.  We are 
concerned as we have two small children.  Could you give us any 
information regarding how we might be able to protect and educate 
ourselves about the type of rattlesnake this might be.  There's lots of 
old wives tales and we were looking for some factual information we could 
use to be more prepared</P>
<UL><UL>-Steve Johns</UL></UL>
<I><P>Steve,</P>
<P>In South Dakota, you're pretty much talking about the Western rattlesnake,
C. Viridis.</P>
<P>You should teach your children not to approach strange snakes if they are
at all unsure about whether they are safe, but also not to be afraid.
Rattlesnakes do not chase or attack people.  If the snake coils and rattles,
the best approach is to stay still until the snake calms down, and then
slowly back away.  </P>

 <P>Hi Rick,</P>
<P>My name is David and I am an EMT-C in Florida.  I recently got into a 
rather heated discussion with one of our ER MD's about the bite of a 
rattlesnake.  Is it true that juvenile's tend to have a higher 
concentration of venom, or that it is stronger for some reason ?  Also, 
what are the reasons for dry bites ?
Thank You For your time,</P>


              <UL><UL> David Shepard B.S. EMT-C</UL></UL><BR>
<P><I>David,</P>
<P>First of all, the name is NICK, not Rick! ;-) </P>
<P>While there is much anecdotal evidence for juvenile rattlesnakes being more
aggressive and likely to bite than adults, I know of no research that actually
supports the hypothesis that the venom is more potent.  Klauber reports
that studies of dried venom extracted from juveniles shows that the venom
yield is smaller than would be expected for the body size, but also notes
that the muscular heads of young snakes make it more difficult to extract the
entire contents of the venom sac.  No evidence is presented to suggest that the
venom is more potent, although it has been suggested that young rattlers have a
higher percentage of neurotoxic factors in the venom.  It has also been
suggested that juveniles inject all of their venom when they bite to make up for
 the low volume of venom they have.</P>
<P>Dry bites (where a fang penetrates the skin, but no venom is injected)are actually
fairly common. Generally this is because the fang does not penetrate deep enough
to bring the mouth of the venom tube below the skin surface.  The orifice for venom
 injection is on the body, not the tip, of the fang so considerable penetration
has to be made before venom can be introduced under the skin. Sometimes, the snake
will misjudge the strike, and invect venom before the fang has been injected.</P>

I am looking for an intact rattle. I tried my local Natural History

<P>Funny thing - the rattle I had is missing too.  I think I loaned it to my tattoo artist when he was working on the design for my tattoo.
.. but, that's neither here nor there.  Do you just want to SEE one, or do you have to have it in your hands? 
 I'd try contacting Bob Myers at the Albuquerque International rattlesnake museum.  He's my fallback recommendation for
 anything rattler-related.  His contact info is on my page under "notable collections of live specimens."  If you just want to see one,
 and it's okay if it's still on a snake, the L.A. zoo probably has one or two, and I was recently at the San Diego Zoo (a bit of a field trip!)
, and the rattles on their snakes are enormous!</P>

<P>Help needed:  Advice on long term rehabilitation of a woman following 
rattle snake bites. </P> 

<P>History:  A healthy woman in her late 20s was rafting in the Grand 
Canyon (southwestern United States)  in June of this year.  She was 
bitten two times in the lateral ankle area by the same rattle snake.  
She was air-lifted out of the area and received 20 vials of antivenin.  
She did get serum sickness after that.  </P>

<P>Current state:  This patient has returned to her home in Missoula, 
Montana.  The woman continues to have swelling, pain, and parasthesia 
in the leg which was bitten.  She does well lying down with her feet 
elevated.  Wearing of compression garments (socks, leggings)  result 
in swelling above the garment.  This womans profession is dancing, 
and she owns a dance studio.  She is anxious to be back to work, and 
feels she is in good health with the exception of her leg problem.
</P><P>
Questions:  What is going on here, and how should this be treated in 
physical therapy?  What is the expected course of this problem?  Do 
you know an expert in long term rehabilitation following snake 
bites?  If so, who/where?

<P> I am also not a physician, and so cannot dispense authoritative advice.  
Let me fabricate some things out of a little common sense, a little snakebite knowledge, and ten years as a massage therapist...</P>
<P>The venom renders the blood vessels unable to hold fluid - there is a great amount of damage to her leg on a very fine scale
 which will take some time to heal.  Because of the damage, I am  leery of suggesting something like effleurage 
( a massage stroke designed to promote circulation), because the vessels and connective tissue may not have regenerated to the
 point where they can take the extra pressure. My guess is that alternate hot and cold soaks may help, but CHECK WITH A 
DOCTOR FIRST!  Once the area has healed, massage to promote circulation.  These, as I say, are all educated guesses, and not 
based on experience with this situation.  My guess is that the leg will heal, but that it will be a slow process.</P>
<P>
Just as an offhand thought - you might want to contact someone who works with Native American 
traditions - probably a Naturopath or Herbalist would be a good start.</P>

<P>I would be very interested in what you find out, and also would be interested in updates on 
the woman's condition.</P>

<P>Nick - loved your page.</P>
<P>We found a baby snake in the hall today and were trying to identify it.  I know 
this is difficult without seeing it, but would appreciate any information you have.</P>

<P>The little guy was about 7 inches long.  He was brown with light green tinge to 
it with darker stripes (bands).  He was very aggressive.  When approached, he shook his
tail and struck at whatever was approaching.  He had no rattles at all, but we 
are guessing that a baby rattler would not.  It was so small that we didn't notice 
any pits.</P>
<P>We are located just North of Boulder, Colorado.  This is the third snake found 
in the halls here, and would appreciate any advice on how to positively identify them.</P>

<P><UL><UL>-No name given</UL></UL>

<I><P>Sounds like you had a brood of snakes hatch very near the house...</P>

<P>If it is a rattler, it will have an identifiable button on the tail, which is where the rattle segments will attach when he starts to shed.
  It will also have long fangs which fold up into the roof of its  mouth (if you feel really really ballsy, wear thick leather clothing and 
gloves, put the snake somewhere like a box where it can't get you, and try to get it to strike at a dangled rag - a rattler will probably
 get its fangs caught, or will at least display them).</P>

<P>What you described could very well be a young C. Viridis, but it could also be a bullsnake, or gopher snake, 
which look very similar, are very aggressive, and shake their tails just like rattlesnakes (an evolved mimicry which keeps them safe
 from rattlesnake-wary predators).  If the tail is slender and ends in a sharp point, then this is probably what you have.</P>

<P>Better yet - if you are not too far from Boulder, call down to CU and see if they have a herpetologist on staff this time of year who
 can take a look at it.  While you're there, say hi to the folks at KGNU, who were wonderful to me when I came through twice on tour
 playing music (my former bandmate Deb Seymour, now of Seattle, was the Blues Lady on KGNU for 12 years).</P>

<P>Let me know what you find out!</P>

<P>I recently stumbled across a snake and am unsure of its species.  First of all I live in Clemson SC, the snake 
was located about 100 yards from a lake.  The color of the snake was light gray with maroon uniform splotches. 
Being so small the head shape didn't really give me any clues, it was slender and didn't have a pit vipers 
head. The snake was a baby (aprox 8 inches, pencil size in dia)just about to shed its skin (cloudy eyes), the 
snake was rather aggressive, I assume because of his transitional state. In his aggression he shook his tail 
violently as if trying to warm me but was unable to make any noise due to the absence of rattles.  Making me 
think that he is some type of rattlesnake but am leaning towards him being an impersonator of some kind.  Not 
that this is a life or death matter but just that I want to curb my curiosity.  In reference to his head, will 
baby pit vipers have the distinguished head or does this happen as he grows and gets older?</P>

<P><I>Troy,</P>
<P>What you have described could very well be a carolina pygmy rattlesnake (sistrurus miliarius). 
  I'd recommend going to the pygmy rattlesnake homepage at <A HREF = "http://www.stetson.edu/~biology/pigpage.html" target = "_top">http://www.stetson.edu/~biology/pigpage.html</A>, 
and looking at the pictures.  Not all pygmys are as brightly colored as the ones they show, and a snake about to shed would be
 duller in color also.</P>

<P>Pygmy rattlers have tiny rattle strings, and the babies would only have a button on the tail where the rattle will grow. 
 It is possible that there was a button and you didn't notice it.  Pygmys are of the genus Sistrurus, members of which have a sleeker 
head than those of Crotalus so no, it would not necessarily have a "pit-vipery" head.</P>

<P>There are, however, imitative snakes.  Here in the west we have the Gopher Snake or Bullsnake, which is similarly shaped and
 patterned to our native rattlesnakes, and which shake their tails vigorously.  However, bullsnakes have pointy tails with no rattles,
 and so are readily identifiable.  I don't know what snakes you have in the east that would have those characteristics.  If you don't think
 it was a pygmy rattler, you might check your public library or bookstore for Joe Collins' "Peterson's field guide to Eastern reptiles
 and amphibians."</P>

<P>I love to walk in the desert, especially at dusk but also 
dawn and after dark.  I prefer not to use a flashlight as
it ruins the vibes.  I do move slowly and stomp my feet.</P>

<P>Are there specialty leggings (kevlar?!) that I could wear
that would be 'fully' protective in case I get unlucky or
inadvertantly corner (or step on) a snake etc.?</P>

<P>I once read an article where they described wrapping 
window screen material around your legs.  I'm assuming 
the snakes 'always' strike below the knee, unless you're 
near a rock ledge (which could be skirted).  I take care
not to reach into bushes or place my hands where I can't 
see.</P>

<P>Also, how protective are the different boot types.</P>

<P>I very much appreciate your help as this is a major hobby
of mine and even when I'm not getting bitten (none yet),
I'd greatly prefer to minimize the concern.</P>

<P>Thank you very much and good luck in your work! </P>

<P><I>Rob,</P>
<P>Well, I once did the same thing, and bought army surplus gaiters for that purpose, but found that they don't reach high enough.</P>

<P>As for the window screen idea - I imagine the mesh would not be tight enough to prevent  fang entry. 
 Kevlar would be overkill for sure :-).  Rattlesnakes are not bullets and their penetration ability is limited.</P>

<P>The experts recommend good solid jeans (or if you feel kinky, leather pants, *wink*), but the key is that they be loose-fitting.
  Fangs that penetrated the jeans would then very likely be kept away from your skin.  So, loose-fitting heavy denim jeans over any 
calf-high boot (ie cowboy boots) would most likely provide optimum protection.  If you are determined to wear window screens over
 your legs, please send pictures :-).   Seriously, if I were walking directly into a rattlesnake den, I would wear good solid hip waders, 
but short of that, baggy jeans and boots should do the trick.</P>

<P>Dear Nick,</P>
<P>I have a general question about snake bites and I thought maybe you 
could lead me in the right direction.  I heard that snakes cannot bite 
when they are swimming under water.  Is this true?<P>

	<UL><UL>-Emily Reichman</UL></UL>





	

<P><I>Emily,</P>

<P>I will quote Laurence Klauber directly here:</P>

<P>"The question of whether rattlesnakes can bite when in, or under, water is occasionally asked.
  The answer is that they can bite readily enough, although, lacking the anchorage of a solid base, they cannot strike efficiently."</P>

<P>Nick:</P>

<P>Unfortunately, my black lab was bitten today by a Western 
Rattlesnake (not a Diamondback - we live in N. California in the 
Sierra Mtns. above Lake Tahoe).  The distance between the bite/fang 
marks on his cheek was 1.5 inches.  Now, since I did not see the 
snake {all the symptoms indicate snake bite} when he was bit, is 
there a way that I can make an estimate of the size of the snake 
from the distance between the puncture wounds?</P>

<P>Secondly, since the distance between the puncture wounds seems large 
for a Western Rattlesnake, is it possible that other species of 
rattlers live in our area.  All the adult rattlers that I have seen 
in our area have a greenish hue, lack distinct "diamond" blotches, 
have faint white rings on the tail, and seem not to exceed 20 - 24 
inches in length.  I have seen a young (5 - 6 inches) rattlesnake 
that was tan with very distinct brown blotches.  Is this a typical 
color pattern for young Western Rattlesnakes or are we dealing with 
a different species?  The vegetation in our area varies from 
coniferous forests to sagebrush.</P>

<P>Any help you can shed on these issues would be greatly appreciated.  
I'm watching my dog closely tonight and hoping for a recovery with 
very little tissue damage.</P>



<P><UL><UL>Dave Valle</UL></UL>

<P><I>Dave,</P>

<P>I am going to have to call into question either your measurements or your diagnosis.
  From your description and my research I am going to guess that your dog was bitten by a cat or something very similar in size
 and physiology.  Let me explain.</P>

<P>First, a cat bite is very septic.  It will swell up and get infected very quickly, and can be very painful and sometimes fatal,
 much like a rattlesnake bite.  See my notes below.</P>

<P>Secondly, there are studies which do correlate fang separation to body size in rattlesnakes, and unless my calculations are
 way off,  for a rattlesnake to have a fang separation of 1.5 inches, it would have to have a body length of over 8 feet.</P>

<P>Here are my calculations.  size correlation constants and formulas are as taken from Laurence Klauber's "Rattlesnakes,
 their habits, natural histories, and influence on mankind."</P>

<UL><LI>	1) Head length = 2.5 times fang separation:  2.5(1.5 inches) = 3.75 inches</LI>
<LI>	2) Body length is given by the following formula:<UL>

	<LI>H = aL + b, where H is head length, L is body length, and a and b are constants that differ from species to species.</LI>
<LI>  Measurements are in millimeters.  3.75 inches = 95.25 millimeters.</LI>

<LI>I did the calculation based on figures for two species: <UL>
<LI>c. viridis (western rattler) a = .0345, b = 7.7  </LI>
<LI>c. atrox (western diamondback) a = .0351, b = 8.7</LI>

<BR>atrox is the only species west of the rockies that gets to 6' or more (8' is, however, unheard of). </UL></LI></UL>

	<LI>3) Solving the equation for L gives:<UL>

<LI>c. atrox  L = (95.25 - 8.7)/.0351 = 2465.8mm = 8.1 feet</LI>
<LI>c. viridis L = (95.25 - 7.7)/.0345 = 2537.7mm = 8.3 feet</LI></UL></UL>

<P>Whatever bit your dog, I hope that you get him to a vet ASAP.  A small mammal bite, as I mentioned, can be life-threatening.
  Chances are that a rattlesnake bite by a snake of the size you are describing would be fatal, unless there was little or no
 venom injected.</P>

<P>One of the greatest dangers of a bite from a feral cat, skunk, or baby raccoon (my top three guesses from the fang separation 
you described) is rabies, which is 100% fatal to both dogs and humans.  </P>

<P>Please write back and let me know how your dog does, and what the vet has to say.</P>



	<P><UL><UL>-Nick</UL></UL></I>

<UL><P><I>Dave Responded:</P>
<P>Nick:</P>

<P>Thank you for your quick and informative response to my question.
Your diagnosis adds credence to what I initially thought was a 
bobcat (or other mammal) wound based on the distance between the 
puncture wounds.  However, if it was a cat I would expect other 
wounds especially from the lower canines or scratch marks.  I also 
did not hear a fight, although my dog was probably out of hearing 
range a few times.  Perhaps, it was a coyote, a skunk, a raccoon or 
maybe a young moutain lion.  Coyotes and lions are common in the 
area;  skunks are common too, although my dog was not sprayed; I 
have not seen any sign of raccoons.</P>

<P>Jake, my lab, is doing about the same as last evening when I wrote 
you:  slightly lethargic, a lot of swelling in the cheek, lip and 
neck area. He's eating and drinking, though, which is a good sign.  
And his urine is a normal color. I did take him to the vet yesterday 
and the doctor treated him with antibiotics (ampicillin injection 
and cephalexin orally) and a steroid (dexamethasone) to reduce 
tissue death. Antivenom was not administered.</P></UL></I>

 <P>I am curious as to whether or not you have any sources of info on efforts to 
classify the Canebrake as a separate subspecies. I have a two year old 
specimen, which basing on color pattern alone it is definitly distinct from 
northern subspecies I have encountered in Pennsylvania. I want to find out if 
color markings alone were the basis for the subspecies classification or if 
there were other differences noted

<P><I>Matthew,

	

<P>According to Klauber, horridus horridus has 23 dorsal scale rows, with an indistinct postocular dark stripe and
 a low degree of contrast between the pattern and body color.  Horridus atricaudatus has generally 25 dorsal scale rows,
 with a distinct dark postocular stripe and sharp contrast between body color and pattern.  Whether this information has 
been found to be false since his writing, I don't know...

<P>
I just read the information in your LMK Memorial page.  You mentioned a 
"Tucson Desert Museum".  In the decades I've lived here in Tucson, I 
haven't discovered a place by this name.  Did you mean the Arizona-Sonora 
Desert Museum, about 20 miles west of Tucson?  It does sort of fit your 
description.
<P>They do have a good collection, but they don't have the best display of that
collection.  They also have some top-notch herp people on their staff, but
the politics of running a museum restrict what they (the herp people) can
do.  I used to do volunteer work for the museum, but gave it up because the
politics disgusted me.  At the time I left, they had the only captive
breeding population of San Esteban Island Chuckwallas.  They had a large,
natural looking enclosure for them, a curator who wanted to run a major
study on all aspects of territoriallity, courtship, and breeding, and a crew
of volunteers to help with the study.  A consultant on public zoo displays
walked through the museum, and told the board of directors that "it didn't
look good" to have the study animals on display.  Zip.  The study ended
until the curator was able to come up with some other off-exhibit facilities.  

<P>There has been talk of them building another reptile display building, but I
don't think that's in the immediate future.  Meanwhile, (in agreement with a
portion of your description) the already high entry fees keep going up,
again based on what they are told by their zoo display consultant.

<P>Changing topics slightly - I would suspect, from the nature of your
homepage, that you keep or work with rattlesnakes.  If so, what sort of work
do you do with them?

<P><UL><UL>Bill</UL></UL>

<P><I>Bill,

<P>Thank you for the correction - I am talking about the ASDM.  
I looked and looked for the information I used to have about it, and couldn't find it, 
so I relied on my (faulty) memory.  I have also since had correspondence from a herper
 who thought it was one of the two the best reptile collections he's seen.  If I'm down 
your way again, I'll have to give it another try.  Maybe I hit it on a bad day...
<P>It is truly a sad thing when politics dictate funding and display.  Unfortunately, 
it is something that reseach, education, and the arts share - the need to be subsidized,
 which means the need to ask for handouts, which means politics - the machine that
 decides distribution of funds - gets involved.  
(see <A HREF = "http://www.seeport.com/staff/dallett/me13.htm" target = "_top">http://www.seeport.com/staff/dallett/me13.htm</A>)

<P>We just returned from a vacation in So. Cal., and we went to the San Diego Zoo,
 which had very well cared-for rattlers, but with very little labeling, so it was
 difficult to learn anything from the displays.  One of the enclosures was labeled 
simply "rattlesnakes."  Inside were several different species...

<P>As for work, I am an animal control officer, but in an area where there are no
 poisonous snakes (Washington's Olympic Peninsula).  So, I am mostly an armchair herper.
  On our trip, we did get to help a very pretty young c. ruber across the road in the 
Anza Borreo desert.  Several cars stopped while we were at it, and it became an 
opportunity to educate!   I grew up in Southern Cal., and was always warned away from 
them, so I suppose I'm rebelling against that fear in my adulthood (?).

<P>Hi Nick,

<P>To settle a bet, would you please let me know how fast a rattlesnake can 
"run"?

<P>My friend and I are debating on whether a man can outrun a rattlesnake, 
so a follow up question would be "How determined can a snake be to 
bite someone?"

<P><UL><UL>- Michael</UL></UL>
<P><I> Michael,
<P>If a rattlesnake trained for months, it could probably reach the blinding speed of about 3 miles per hour.  In other words,
 you could "outrun" it by walking your normal pace.

<P>Rattlesnakes do not want to bite humans - they go out of their way to avoid it - so there is no reason they would be 
chasing you in the first place...

<P>I would like to ask if you know of any techniques of catching rattlers in 
the field and field dressing them, strictly for their meat? Wait, also is 
this poaching...? Thank you.
<P><UL><UL>-No name given</UL></UL>

<I><P>Dressing a snake for food is simple - skin the snake, and remove the head.  The
entrails come neatly out of the body cavity, leaving the meat, which should be cooked
and eaten off the bones.
<P>Personally,  I don't feel that rattlers should be taken from the wild for food.
 While rattlesnakes are considered a nuisance in many places, they are wildlife, and as such are
protected in many places.  At least one species - the New Mexican ridgenosed rattler -
is on the Endangered Species List.
<P>Check with your State Department of Fish and Wildlife about whether it is legal to
catch and kill rattlesnakes for food.

<P><I>Joe,
<P>Local laws and Ordinances regarding Exotic and/or Venomous pets vary greatly from
one region to the next.  You will need to check three places for this information.  First,
your state law (check with the State Department of Fish and Wildlife), next, the County
law, and finally City or local law.  Your nearest animal shelter or SPCA may be able to
help you with these last two.  Alternatively, you could check with a dealer who sells
reptiles.  A reputable dealer should be up on all aspects of law regarding exotics.

<P>My goofy grandson brought into his house a  3 foot Pennsylvania rattler 
for his little girls to see. Which they did---and made appropriate 
little girl noises and so on. Quite naturally, the makeshift cage didn't 
cage very well and said snake was last seen entering the space between 
floor and ceiling below and now all ladies refuse to go home from 
mother's place and grandpap(me) has been summond to deal with the 
crises. I claim the snake doesn't want to be there and is probably gone 
and WON'T stay unless he has food and water and/or girl snakes..I know 
gasolene will drive him out( if he's there ) but that way is also a good 
way to burn down the house....Any suggestions or info will be greatly 
appreciated.....

<P><I>Grampa Wolf,
<P>Well, you are right, of course - he doesn't want to be there, and wants to leave.  
The bad news is that snakes will hide in dark corners for long periods of time, and sometimes emerge when
 least expected (causing little girl noises from grown men, sometimes).  The good news is that if there is a way out, the 
snake has probably found it.

<P>As for gasoline, it might drive it out, or it might just make it sick.  And, as you note, there is the fire danger.

<P>You might want to call your local animal control or nuisance wildlife specialist 
and get some more specialized information.  I am not very familiar with extracting snakes from floors 
(although I have had snakes get away, and I suspect that is where they escaped to).

<P>Nick,

<P>I'm curious to know where you obtain your information?  My dog 
recently was bit by a baby rattlesnake.  She survived but is it true 
that babies have a more toxic venom than adults?  I also discovered 
that my dog cannot have anti-venom twice.  She apparently could have a 
violent reaction.

	<P><UL><UL>-Tiffany Hoss</UL></UL>

<P><I>Tiffany - 

<P>	It is generally taken as fact that baby rattlers have a more potent venom 
(although I don't know off the top of my head whether research supports this). 
 It stands to reason that they would evolve that way, as the babies are the most vulnerable individuals in the population.
  That is balanced, though, by the relatively small amount of venom they are able to deliver (because they are so small).
  So, though your dog received what might have been a more potent venom, she received certainly less than she would
 have from an adult snake, all other things being equal.

<P>As for my source of information, it is primarily Laurence Klauber's "Rattlesnakes:  Their Habits, Life Histories, 
and Influence on Mankind, which is the standard work on rattlesnakes.  
Other sources of information include my personal experience, common sense, other experts, and, in the case of dogs,
 four years experience as an animal control officer, which includes observation and performance of emergency 
veterinary procedures.

<P>Your story was so interesting that it has earned its own space

<P>Hi Nick,

<P>Have a question for you that actually comes from my parents. Here's 
what my dad e-mailed me:

<UL>>Please look this one up (on Alameda Creek Trail).  
It was about 2.5 <BR>>ft long, had dark brown and light brown coloration in kind of a<BR>
 >diamond pattern, but smaller pattern than on a diamondback.  It<BR>
>did have jowls like a venomous snake, and it turned back on Lee like <BR>
>it was pissed off and was ready for combat.  No rattles visible. <BR> 
>Very slow, like it didn't give a s*** (porcupine style).<BR>
</UL> 


<P>Okay. Questions:
<UL>
<LI>Are all snakes whose heads are shaped like a pit viper poisonous?

<LI>Are there pit vipers in California (East Bay Area) that don't have 
rattles?

<LI>If this snake was a young rattlesnake, is there an easy explanation 
for why it didn't have rattles?
(For instance, the snake might actually have had the beginnings of 
rattles, but perhaps they were difficult to see?)
</UL>

<P>In any case, I hope you can help us out. We're eternally curious about 
the animals that we meet when we're outside.

<P>And thanks for the great site you've put together. Really nice work.


<P><UL><UL>Jody Sumrall</UL></UL>

<P><I>Jody, 

<P>I have two words for you - <B>Pituophis Melanoleucus!</B>

<P>Now, I can't be positive without seeing it, but that's probably what your dad saw - 
otherwise known as a gopher or bull snake.  They do a very good job of imitating 
rattlesnakes - 
down to the practice of wiggling their tail very fast in the brush to make a 
rattling sound.  
The patterns are very similar, and the shape of the head is very similar.  
They are found throughout California.

<P>The two things that gopher snakes lack are 1) Pits, and 2) Rattles (they also lack fangs and venom, 
but I'm just mentioning the things that you could check without a visit to the Emergency room).  
The pits are organs located in the front of the skull, and look like enormous nostrils.  The rattles sometimes break off,
 but when they do, they leave behind a single blunt segment that is part of the tail.  
A gopher snake would have a tapered tail.  Also, on rattlesnakes, the tail is very often banded with black and white.
  In gopher snakes, the body pattern continues down to the tail tip.

<P>If it were a young rattlesnake, at 2 1/2 feet long, it would have already had a few rattles, 
unless it had the entire string broken off.  Rattlesnakes gain a rattle segment every time they shed.

<P>The two other pit vipers in the US - Cottonmouths and Copperheads - like to hang out east of the Rockies
 (probably because we call them names like Copperhead and Cottonmouth).

<P>Just a reminder of the obvious - be extremely careful about any snake you're not sure of. 
 Look it over carefully before you decide it's just a gopher snake and grab it :-)

<P>Hope this helps...

<P>living on the outskirts of Los Angeles, in the hills, surrounded by 
brush, we get a lot of rattlers on our property each year. we are trying

<P>Nick,
  <P>My home is in Tucson, AZ and backs up to a ravine at the foot of Pucsh
Ridge in the Santa Catalina mountains.  I recognize that part of the
trade-off for our beautiful, unobstructed view is having "close encounters"
with native wildlife.  We've seen a Gila Monster, javelina, quail,
roadrunners, rabbits, etc.  Although our neighbors warned us about rattlers,
we had never seen one until three weeks ago.  Since then we have had a 31/2
foot rattlesnake in the front yard at dusk; a 4 foot bull snake in the back
yard checking out our pet door; and lastly just three days ago, a 6 foot
rattler in the front yard, again at dusk.  We are currently in a drought
here; even the cactus are suffering.  We do have a pool, but the rattlers
have all been in front.  I know I can't necessarily prevent the rattlers, but
is there something that might be attracting them specifically to our front
yard?  I have a 22 month old toddler, and we are more than a little nervous.
 If we are inadvertantly attracting the rattlers, I would very much like to
know.
  <P>I enjoyed your web site.  I got much more info there than I did from our
local EMT's about emergency bite procedures, etc.  Thanks.
                                                       <P><UL><UL>Kathleen</UL></UL>

<P><I>Kathleen,
<P>Thanks for the compliments!
<P>Wild animals respond to three things - food, water, and shelter.  So, if they are coming to your house,
 then they are looking for one or the other of those things, or a combination.  

<P>Another part of the puzzle is that depending on the time of year, rattlesnakes will be active at one particular time, 
when the temperature is in their preferred operating range (~65 to 80 degrees, give or take five or ten...)  

<P>Since it can be too hot for them during the day this time of year, they will often become active at dusk. 
 This also happens to coincide with the peak activity of their favorite food source - rodents.  So,
 if this has been happening since the weather got hot (3 weeks ago sounds right), it probably just indicates that 
you are seeing them when they are the most active.

<P>My educated guess would be that you have rats or mice under your house, or around the yard.   
So, you are indirectly providing food for the snakes (both the rattlers and the bullsnakes - bet you start seeing king 
snakes too, which eat other snakes as well as rodents!).  Hence, the way to discourage the snakes is to stop attracting
 the mice and rats.

<P>The next question, of course, is what is attracting the mice and rats.  I'll bet the pet door is near the kitchen :-). 
 Or possibly near where you store the pet food.  Or both.  Start keeping the pet food in a covered trash bin. 
 I'm sure an exterminator would be happy to consult with you by phone on how best to stop attracting rodents to the
 house.  NOTE: You probably don't notice that you have rats and mice around.  That's because you have snakes keeping
 the population under control!

<P>Now - the big one.  The pool.  You live in an arid area (ever wonder, though, why they made those idiotic underpasses
 downtown that get flooded when it rains??), so water is at a premium.  Just the scent of that water - the humidity it gives
 to the surrounding air - will be enough to attract every living critter in the desert to your back patio.  
If you picture your area from above, you can probably picture how snakes and javalinas and gila monsters and etc.
 and etc. would make a beeline for that humid air.  Very likely those snakes in the front yard were on their way to the
 back yard.

<P>This is all just educated guesses, based on knowledge, experience, and a good measure of intuition...  
Hope it is of some help.   You might want to ask other pool owners around if they are experiencing the same thing.

<P>This is not a question...just a thank you.  Having encountered 2 timber
rattlers within 2 hours on a backpacking trip last weekend (VA Blue Ridge), I
realized that I was too ignorant for my own good!  The first snake was
sprawled across the trail and saw me before I saw it.  When it coiled about 2
feet off the path, my companion and I felt pretty stupid...we had visions of
those snakes on the Nature Channel in slo-mo  flying thru the air to strike
their victims.  We had NO idea how close we could safely pass, and
bushwacking off the trail and thru mountain laurel thickets was out of the
question.  We learned that after a 15 minute stand-off the snake would just
leave.</P>

<P>Made it easier when we found another at our campsite.  At least we knew by
then that the snake wanted nothing to do with us and wasn't a threat as long
as we didn't step on it in the dark!! </P>

<P>I've searched bookstores for more info...have been determined to know more
about rattlers before our next trip!!  I could find very little information
about how to handle encounters and what to expect.  Until I found your web

<P>I have a 4 year old and a 6mth old.  My biggest concern is their safety. 
Do you have any info on fatilities from rattlesnake bites to children?  
I've also heard baby/small rattlesnakes are potentially deadly because 
they inject all of their venom - is this true?  Final question: How far 
vertical (ie, up the leg) can a rattlesnake bite.  Will boots protect me 
in the "brushy"/dense areas of my yard.</P>

<P>Thanks,</P>
<UL><UL>Dave Smith</UL></UL>
<P><I>Dave,</P>
<P>I don't have any specific stats on bites to children, but I can give you some guidelines which might be more useful.
  The operant concept here is the ratio between amount of venom injected and body weight.  
Thus, the smaller the child, the greater the danger from any particular snake bite.</P>

<P>You are also correct about baby rattlers.  Their venom is more potent, though they have very little of it compared to adult
 snakes.  They are also more aggressive - nature's way of ensuring that they survive to adulthood.</P>

<P>Here is my advice for protecting your and your childrens' safety:</P>
<OL>
<LI> Contact the emergency room of your nearest hospital and find out their protocol 
for treating rattlesnake bites - ie in the event of a bite, how should you act to best
 help them to treat the bite victim.  Also find out if they keep antivenin on hand,
 or if they order it from a central source in the event of a bite.  Find out if they 
need to know what specific species inflicted the bite, or if they use a polyvalent that
 covers all the local species.  This information may or may not be helpful to you, but 
it will help you to feel more at ease when and if confronted with an actual bite 
situation.</LI> 

<LI>  Keep the brush trimmed down close to the house to make 
the immedtate area less attractive to rodents, and therefore less attractive to the 
snakes that prey on them.</LI> 

<LI>  When walking in the brush, stomp and shuffle your feet loudly.  
If the snakes hear you coming, they will move out of your way. Walk slowly to give them
 time to move away.</LI> 

<LI>  Most important, it is a good idea to teach your kids about safe observation of 
rattlesnakes without being paranoid about them.  On the whole, rattlers rarely bite, 
and the bites are rarely serious.  Most bites occur when someone is intentionally 
handling a snake.  A rattlesnake will go out of its way to avoid you, so except for the
 springtime, when the babies are prone to be aggressive, there is little danger of
 running into one unexpectedly.  Best advice is to use reasonable caution when prowling
 around in rattlesnake territory.</LI> </OL>

<P>Can a rattlesnake rattle while it's moving, or is it only possible for the 
snake to rattle while it is coiled?</P>

<UL><UL>-Jim Riley</UL></UL>

<I><P>Jim,</P>
<P>Well, kind of like the ability to rub one's tummy and pat one's head at the same time, 
this probably differs from snake to snake.  I have seen  snakes rattle as they run, but this was just a quick buzz,
 not an extended sizzle like a coiled snake.  The rattle is generally used in conjunction with a flapping tongue and the 
coil, so I imagine the snake's physiology is set up to make it significantly easier to rattle for longer periods when in the
 defensive coil.</P>

<P>So, the simple answer is yes, a rattlesnake can rattle almost any time.  But if the snake is aroused enough to rattle
 extensively, it will probably also assume the coil and other defensive displays.</P>

my 5 year old son would like to know the answer to the question, " if one 
rattle snake bites another, will the bitten one die or will the poison 
have any effect on it ? "
-Gary Tinnel

<I><P>Gary,</P>
<P>Rattlesnakes have a very high resistance to their own venom, but are not completely immune. 
 when a rattlesnake is bitten by another rattlesnake, or if a rattlesnake accidentally bites itself, it is very likely that the
 wound will swell up just as it would in a human, but deaths due to this are probably very rare. 
 So, the effects are halfway between your son's suggestions, i.e. it would hurt them, but probably not kill them.</P>

<P>You should teach your children not to approach strange snakes if they are
at all unsure about whether they are safe, but also not to be afraid.
Rattlesnakes do not chase or attack people.  If the snake coils and rattles,
the best approach is to stay still until the snake calms down, and then
slowly back away.  </P>

<title> Important notice to AOL (America Online) users:  WE STILL EXIST! </title>

<h3> IMPORTANT NOTICE TO AOL (AMERICA ONLINE) USERS:<br></h3>
<a href="/index.html"><IMG ALIGN=ABSBOTTOM HSPACE=5 WIDTH=198 HEIGHT=86 SRC="/pics/icons/ascologo.gif">
<h2>THE ANIMATED SOFTWARE COMPANY<br></h2>
</A>
<h1>STILL EXISTS!</h1>
<b>
On February 3rd, 1997 America Online informed us that some time near
the end of March, 1997 we would no longer be able to maintain a forum 
on AOL unless we agreed to pay nearly $55,000 per year from now on.
(With no guarantee against future price increases.)
<p>
We are unable to raise that kind of sum that fast.  Unless some agreeable 
and well-padded investor comes along (and soon!) we will be leaving AOL 
whenever AOL decides they want us to, (but our understanding is that
it will be at least 30 days after we have received a definite cutoff 
date.)  (So far we have not been given a firm cutoff date from America 
Online.) 
<p>
By no means are we the only company facing this situation.
<p>
A group of companies formed a "strike" to protest the sudden
"foreclosure" of our AOL Company Connection Forums.  In concert with
this strike we have removed all our files from America Online and
posted the notice contained in the letter below.  What follows is my
letter to the strike leader agreeing to join.  This letter has been
passed on by the strike coordinator to numerous Computer Press 
organizations and it is our understanding that a number of them plan to 
quote from it (<i>thanks!</i>).  
<p>
Here is the latest version for members of the press who might want 
to publish all or part of it and need an original version, for other
AOL strike companies to refer to, and for our own customers on AOL to
understand what has happened.  We did <i>not</i> downsize.  
(One-man companies seldom get any smaller anyway.) 
<p>
Actually, in point of fact, 1997 so far has been an incredibly exciting
year for us.  We are experiencing our most rapid rate of growth ever 
and are having a wonderful time!  I would estimate that at our current rate
of increase in our growth rate, everyone on the Internet will have visited 
us electronically by the year 2000, and everyone on the planet will have 
visited us by the year 2005!  (Don't you just love everybody's 
<a href="/visitors.htm#access_stats">Internet access 
statistics</a>? You can prove anything with them!  At our present growth
rate, by the year 2010, the entire planet will be doing 
nothing BUT visiting us!)  So I'm not saying I'm going to whither and die 
from this.  It's just a flesh wound.  But it still cuts to the quick
(wherever that is).  And other companies might be having a harder
time of it, and what did any of us do to deserve this?  And what
about our customers, AOL?  Our MUTUAL customers?  What did <i>they</i> do 
to deserve this inconvenience?   Some of them will surely think we've 
gone out of business.  But surely you didn't <i>want</i> to leave that 
impression -- so why can't you leave a forwarding address?
<p>
And for AOL, too, this letter is presented, so they realize how much
this hurts, both emotionally and monetarily.  I have this to say to
AOL: I never really thought it could last forever. But I wanted to 
be able to walk, not run, to the nearest exit when the time came.  
I didn't suddenly start costing you a fortune, you know.  There is 
no reason you should hurt the many small companies that helped you 
grow.  That got onto your service and acted like big companies when 
you yourself couldn't even attract a tabloid newspaper.  We were friends,
remember?  A "community".  What happened to all that?  I know the
financial balance of everything changed when you went off hourly
rates, but we were working together as a <i>team</i> at that time.
We could have arranged something better than this.  You blindsided
us.  Do you know I have had to change over 2000 individual files? I
referenced our support area on AOL with EVERY DOCUMENT, EVERY FILE,
EVERY BATCH FILE, EVEN VIRTUALLY EVERY .EXE PROGRAM WE SHIP.  Now 
they'll all have to be changed in 30 days--A.S.A.P if possible. 
Changed, tested, recompiled, retested, and distributed.  Thanks for 
the warning, and thanks for the wonderful choices: Either disappear 
as if it were <i>I</i> that were having trouble in my business, 
not you, or cough up $55,000 before the next moon. 
<p>
Enough said, here's the document...

<hr>
<br>to: Jeff Baudin, President, <a href="http://www.micromat.com">MicroMat</a>
<br>Strike Coordinator, AOL Company Connection Strike Group
<br>cc: <a href="mailto:SteveCase@aol.com">SteveCase@aol.com</a>, AOL Company Connection
<br>Hi!:
<p>
Your note deserves an immediate reply.
<p>
THANK YOU for sending me your "plan".
<p>
I agree with you that AOL's action was uncalled for and unwarranted, and penny-wise and
pound-foolish too.  And so, I have removed all our files and messages effective immediately, 
Saturday, February 8th, 1997 at 3:45 pm PST.  I replaced it with an ad-hoc or 
lone-wolf message of my own, though, for now:  Here is my message.  
Please note that it speaks of other companies' plights as well:
<p>
<i>As with other a number of other companies who have unified in 
their actions, The Animated Software Company has removed our files 
and forum messages from AOL, at least while we update them to remove
references to AOL itself.  We will be leaving AOL after some six years.  
We were the oldest Company Connection on the block but significant new 
price structures announced by America Online preclude small companies 
like us.  Please be sure to visit our World Wide Web site which will 
NEVER disappear!  
<br>Here's the URL:
<br>http://www.animatedsoftware.com
<br>Thank you and thanks to AOL for our years together.  </i>
<p>
I had already posted the message in some form and began the file removal process when I got your email--in fact, last Monday I had first put that message up.
<p>
As to the strike starting Feb. 7th, 1997, I couldn't have made that anyway--sorry, but I didn't check my mail sooner.  I've logged on a bit less since learning I'm leaving...
<p>
I told AOL I would not knock them.  That if they must kick me off after all these years, oh well.  I'll go.  So I kind of agreed not to do anything drastic.  They suggested I post a message but after I get notification of the exact date.  So far said notification has not arrived.  I guess it's too late now...
<p>
AOL's cool.  I like AOL.  I helped them grow.  I recommend it to my parents and siblings to get them onto the electronic highway.  I probably will still do all these things.
<p>
I am the oldest company in Company Connection.  The oldest. Not the second oldest.  One company started about the same time but they never built up their site and left after six weeks.  We've been there ever since.  Ever since AOL had less than 70,000 subscribers.  I'm a "charter subscriber".
<p>
We "sell" interactive educational software for adults and children.  For example a tutorial about the human heart called THE HEART: THE ENGINE OF LIFE which is available on AOL (for a limited time only!!!).  It's shareware.  Do you think I make a fortune and can cough up $55,000 from the dozen or so registrations I get for each couple of  thousand downloads? 
<p>
We offer a free tutorial on an environmental topic which has a delightful EARTH PUZZLE based on Bucky Fuller's Dymaxion Map.  It's free.  I don't make much ($0) from that either.  We have a bunch of animated demos of mechanical pumps, and above all, the tool we use to create all these wonders of animated computer technology.  Our animation is the smoothest on the planet.  Our keyword on AOL is ANIMATED SOFTWARE.
<p>
You think I mind loosing the support area?  What I really mind, what I feel in my heart of hearts like suing them over (but I guess I'm just too mild-mannered or something) is "stealing" (or is it ransoming?  I forget) the keyword.  I asked them about that.  They wanted $55,000 to keep that too.  They said it will be gone.  They said it will be available to anyone else.  The said it might be, oh, I would guess, two years before someone uses it.  Or it could be the day after you go.  
No, it wouldn't be that.  But they make no commitments and won't give me a forwarding address.  
<p>
No commitment.  What I really want from them is my keyword.  If it just says  "This company, the Animated Software Company, has moved all it's support and download files to their Internet Web Site at http://www.animatedsoftware.com"  I would be okay with that.  They don't even have to mention the CompuServe support--I send CompuServe customers back to CompuServe
from our Internet Web site, so that's good enough.
<p>
But no.  AOL is taking ANIMATED SOFTWARE away after hundreds of thousands of downloads on their system, and millions of files distributed elsewhere, that say that that keyword is mine.  I have distributed millions of programs that say to contact me for support through AOL at our keyword.  They just ruined all that.  These programs will still be available--I can't control distribution!!!
<p>
That is costing me far more than the $55,000 AOL wants, but I don't have that kind of money.
<p>
If you wish to send a copy of this email to magazines, well, my company 
could certainly use some publicity to let the millions of people out 
there know that they can find me not at keyword ANIMATED SOFTWARE on 
AOL like it says on the disk/download/brochure/third-party listing, but 
on the Internet as www.animatedsoftware.com and on CompuServe as 
Keyword ANISOFT. I have cc'd AOL with this.  There's no sense in hiding!  
But AOL wants me to go quietly in the night.   It just can't be done 
and I told them that. 
<p>
And if there's ANYTHING else I can do to support your movement, let me know.
<p>
AOL was my #1 file support area.  I had more files available there than at CompuServe or the Internet or that are distributed to Shareware distributors.  Well, that's changed.
<p>
Our products have had dozens of GLOWING reviews in major magazines like HOME PC and NUTS&VOLTS and DOS WORLD.  And in magazines in the pump industry.  We make really really good stuff here. 
<p>
But how much money did I make from THE HEART: THE ENGINE OF LIFE since going shareware with the product last summer after nearly 10 years on the market?  A couple of hundred dollars, if that.  But through AOL, CompuServe (where I also have a forum -- and started it about the same time and still have it) our Internet FTP site and shareware distributors, 10's of thousands or perhaps 100,000's of thousands of copies have been distributed (no one can tell).  
[A cardiac medical center] in Texas will use a thousand copies of it later this month.  CompuServe featured it one day
last fall, and in the next two weeks we had over 1000 downloads of THE HEART: THE ENGINE OF LIFE.
On AOL, it's hundreds of downloads a week, week in and week out, for 6 years or so.  That's a lot of downloads, and of good, solid, useful, well-liked educational material.  Each with AOL support featured....
<p>
Back when AOL had 70,000 subscribers and I was the only Company in Company Connection (this was true for at least a few weeks, as I recall) I could get publicity on their banners and stuff.  Now, VISA gets the front page over and over and over, and unless I learn [AOL's scripting language] I can barely make an edit change.
<p>
So I told AOL, okay, if that's the way you want to be, send me off.  I won't say bad things about you.  I'll still support you in any way I can...  Stupid of me, but I said it.
<p>
But neither, I said, will I in any way let the public think that I have downsized just because I have SUDDENLY been removed from AOL.
<p>
So I have supported your plan with action in addition to morally.  Please drop me an email as soon as you get a chance (right now, if you've read this far!) and say 'hi' and tell me how it's going now.  Who's participating (by numbers, I believe there are about 300 total.  So I bet most of us got that package.)
<p>
She sounded SO ENTHUSIASTIC when she called.  Yet somehow, I knew just what was up.  The only question was:  how much was this going to cost me?
<p>
It cost me my favorite support forum--MINE on AOL.
<p>
I'll probably post this at my web site as an explanation for why we're 
leaving AOL.  Also, you might be interested to know that in a
marathon 12 hours that came after they told me I was being kicked out 
(last Monday morning (Feb 3rd, 1997) I removed every AOL-related 
mention from my web site (except some download instructions) and 
from every master copy of every file I could find.  I'm sure I missed 
a lot, too!  I still need to rezip everything and then start
testing the new zips (and that, as any programmer knows, is the long
hard part), then upload them to AOL, CompuServe and my FTP Internet site.  
AOL has suddenly cost me a lot of money and a lot of time.
<p>
Thanks for making me not feel all alone.
<p>
<br>Sincerely,
<br>(signed)

<h3>Read what reviewers have said:</h3>
<p>
P11 was first demonstrated to the public in 1984, and was released in late 1985 or 1986.  The first review was published about 1987.  The industry was different, then.  Little guys could get a word in edgewise.  That's much harder to do these days, I think.  
<i>Especially</i> if you're trying to promote a <b>DOS</b> program, for gosh sakes!  I mean, Who Cares, right?  And who does care?  People who believe that hardware should run free, and not be hampered by complex unreliable layers of GUI garbage.
<p>
If you want to know what P11 can do <i>now</i>, may I suggest you download some examples from our FTP site, or read the reviews of <b>ALL ABOUT PUMPS</b> which was written with P11.  The last known review of P11 was February, 1990, before I released the SVGA version.  
<p>
Perhaps I should make more of an effort to get some current reviews, but anyway, suffice it to say the program continues to grow and to serve the needs of educators worldwide, and users continue to use it, and they continue to say things like this very recent comment: "The program...is amazingly versatile and just an absolute peach." 
<p>
<p>
<i>"Wow!  That was the first thing I said when I ran p11 ... I have never seen computer graphics move as smoothly as the ones done with P11...P11 shines when coupled with good artwork."</i> 
<br>
PCM (for the TANDY (r)), Jan., 1990
<p>
<i>"It is a very powerful, unique tool, and one that is long overdue ... I would highly recommend it to anyone interested in creating animation on a PC."</i>
<br>
THE STACK, Official Newsletter of The Long Island Computer Association Inc., Feb., 1990
<p>
<i>"Easy to learn and use.  Simple, powerful, affordable."</i>
<br>
BOSTON COMPUTER SOCIETY, Educational Special Interest Group, Sept., 1988
<p>
<i>"Tremendous capabilities.  The versatility of this program is unrivaled by anything I've ever seen."</i>
<br>
BIG BLUE DISK, #13, Oct. 1987
<p>
<i>"The possibilities for education, advertising, and training are endless ... An amazing value."</i>

<DL>
<p>
  <DT> <B>DOS World, May, 1996:</B>
       <DD>
"For anyone fascinated with how gadgets and things mechanical work...As a multimedia tool, All About Pumps goes all-out with colorful animation techniques, combining Disney-like frame-to-frame hand drawing with advanced assembly-language playback...You won't need documentation; you can easily find your way around."
<p>
  <DT> <B>Pumps & Systems Magazine, March, 1996:</B>
       <DD>
"An excellent introductory experience for people new to the pump business--who would benefit from a basic knowledge of how pumps work...Even though I have been associated with the pump industry since 1955, I found the glossary of pumps in this computer program quite useful." 
<p>
  <DT> <B>Lonnie Brown, The Ledger (Lakeland, FL) January 28th, 1996:</B> 
       <DD>
"Students writing papers or beginning engineers who need to know these things will find the 100 or so full-color, detailed animations helpful in gaining an understanding of how pumps work.  Russell D. Hoffman, who wrote the program, used the high-resolution mode on the computer, which allows for smooth, detailed animation."
<p>
  <DT> <B>Nuts & Volts, June, 1995:</B>
       <DD>
"I haven't counted the total number of screens, but there seem to be about 200!  They are all colorful, easy to read, and those with animation operate quickly and smoothly... I wish more programs were this easy to use!  When was the last time you used a program where only two help screens tell you ALL you need to know to use the program effectively, where only two keys are used for navigation, where no typed commands are required-and where you can learn so much about a useful topic with so little effort?" 
<a href="/reviews/nutsvolt.htm"><i> Full Text. </i></a>
<p>
  <DT> <B>HOMEPC, July, 1995:</B> 
       <DD>
"All About Pumps offers charming animation and meticulous detail about more than 50 types of [pumps] in residential, agricultural, scientific and medical uses....If you have a hankering for hydraulics, get pumped-this one's for you."
<p>
  <DT> <B>InTech, March, 1995:</B>  
       <DD>
"Hoffman's easy-to-use program keeps the "reader's" interest with high-resolution images of working pumps and text suited to the size of a computer screen."
<p>
  <DT> <B>Canadian Water Well, June, 1995:</B> 
       <DD>
"Once the program is running, your eyes are in for a feast.  All About Pumps allows users to control the operating speeds of the animations.  This is especially convenient for observing how valves and other internal components work together to control the flow of water.... It combines exceptional animation with education to produce a worthwhile addition to existing pump-related sources."

<p>
<hr>
These glossary entries have been prepared to accompany a
computer tutorial based on the book "Statistics Explained" by
Professor Howard S. Hoffman. That book was originally published in
1985 by University Press of America (Library of Congress Catalog
number ISBN 0-8191-4894-6). 
<p>
The tutorial (which is currently being
created for this web site) will provide the background necessary for
a full understanding of these glossary entries. In the meantime
persons unfamiliar with statistical analysis may find the entries
easier to grasp if they are examined in the order listed below.
Persons already familiar with statistical procedure can, of course,
examine them in any order they choose.  They appear in alphabetical
order after the suggested viewing order.
<p>
(NOTE: This is currently a work-in-progress.  Please forgive any
minor annoyances.  All words listed are defined.)

<h2>Download these interactive educational software programs!</h2>
<p>
<a href="http://www.compuserve.com/cgi-bin/gocserve?CIS:ANIMVEN">CompuServe</a> users can go directly to our CompuServe support area (Keyword: anisoft  Library: 3). (WinCIM 2.01/CS3 ONLY).
<p>
The ftp URL address of these educational files is as follows.  However, 
for technological reasons this is subject to change.  The links will, 
of course, be changed if that ever happens.  Happy learning!

<h3>Enjoyed by millions...</h3>
Our software products have been available for over a decade and have
been downloaded and distributed by the millions.  You only need one
copy of the latest version of our P11RUN.EXE animation engine to run
every one of our demos and products. 
<p>
You will need to download P11STUFF.ZIP once.  P11RUN.EXE is contained 
in the zipped file P11STUFF.ZIP.
<p>
Most of these programs can be placed in any directory on any disk drive
they can fit on, but for simplicity 
if you download several of our programs, we suggest you use the \P11 
directory and various subdirectories.  This will be created
<i>automatically</i> if you use the following 
parameters when you 'unzip' the file.
<p>
To unzip these programs and create a \P11 directory automatically, 
use PKUNZIP with the \ and -d options, like this:
<br>
<b>PKUNZIP.EXE LABELER.ZIP G:\ -D</b>
<br>
This would place LABELER on the g: drive in the \P11\LABELER directory, and create
\P11\TEMP so that LABELER can use it.  
<p>
If you have problems running these programs after you've downloaded
them or if you have problems downloading them, please visit our
<a href="/faqs/p11_faqs.htm">F.A.Q. (Frequently Asked Questions) web page</a>.  
If that doesn't get you going, please <a href="/mailprom.htm">email us</a> or phone us.
<p>
<b>Note to Win 95 users:</b>  Windows 95 is what is referred to as a 'pig', 
meaning it takes resources it is not entitled to (and doesn't even need!). 
(This isn't fair to pigs, but what is?)  
Despite Microsoft's <b>promise to DOS developers</b> that they would 
maintain complete compatibility for properly written DOS programs, the truth 
is if you run our largest and best multimedia programs (such as ALL
ABOUT PUMPS or its demos) on some WIN 95 configurations you will 
have to either <i>shut Windows down</i> or <i>create a 'shortcut'</i> to force
Windows to give our programs <b>real memory</b>, not <b>swapped hard disk
space</b>.  Yet we don't actually request all that much hardware!
<p>
Most of our animations use EMM or XMS memory and run very smoothly 
with <b>NO</b> hard disk access.  If you download ERICSSON.ZIP, for
example, and the animation is jerky and the hard drive light flashes
on, please visit our <a href="/faqs/win95pif.htm">F.A.Q. about Win
95</a> for instructions on how to force Win 95 to give up some resources, 
or how to shut it down completely while you run our software.  And
please, I encourage you to COMPLAIN TO MICROSOFT!  Tell them to leave
DOS alone and not try to cripple it!  It's really <b>rude</b> of them 
to treat hard working developers like us the way they have, after 
<i>enticing</i> us for a decade to program in DOS with promises of future 
support!  DOS is a direct-to-hardware programming environment and
allows for some wonderful multimedia.  Microsoft should not be
allowed to try to convert it to an emulated, slow, Windows application.

<h1> Guestlist </h1>
<hr>
The show is about all sorts of high tech issues, not just computers.  Each guest appears for the <I>entire</I> show, giving them a chance to explain complex concepts and give in-depth analysis and opinion.
This format is completely unlike a TV "sound bite" and is even better than a segment on an educational show. By letting the guest answer a series of questions along specific lines for the whole show, listeners are able to get a more complete picture of what is happening in the guest's field of work.  Listeners can get past the introduction of a topic and are offered some real meat.
<p>
The shows listed below have been transcribed to the Internet in whole or in part.  I have included a number of Internet links to our guests' own sites.  This does not represent an endorsement of their products, philosphies, or strategies, nor did having them on the show in the first place.

<p>
<i>Russell Hoffman ("Host")</i>, <i>High Tech Today</i>
<br>
<b>Phil Zimmermann ("PZ")</b>, Author of PGP <i>(Pretty Good Privacy)</i>.
<p>
<i>Host:
...And you're listening to HIGH TECH TODAY with your host, Russell Hoffman and today, we're going to be talking about <i>freedom</i>.
<p>
Freedom is hard to define.  Our Declaration of Independence says that we have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.  One <i>absolute requirement</i> of a free society is freedom of
speech.  And there can be no free speech in today's electronic world
without encryption.  Encryption is the process of turning ordinary
text communications, or images, into indecipherable gobbledygook, in
such a way that it can be turned back into a meaningful message only
by the intended recipient.  Why is encryption vital to freedom? 
Because, BIG BROTHER, whether you want to admit it or not, <i>is</i>
watching you.  Most of the time he's pretty unobtrusive to the
average American, but nevertheless he's there.  He might take the
form of a computer program that looks for keywords, or a person
secretly reading your email or opening your letters.
<p>
Citizens of a free society have a right to secret communications
between themselves.  Without that right, we have no freedom.
<p>
My guest this week is Phil Zimmermann, who wrote a program called PGP
or Pretty Good Privacy.  PGP is an encryption program for computers
which is distributed worldwide via the Internet.  This has caused Mr.
Zimmermann no small hassle with the government, who tried for five
years to prosecute Mr. Zimmermann for making PGP available around the
world--for exporting a vital tool of freedom.
<p>
A couple of weeks ago the U.S. government dropped their lawsuit
against Phil and left him free to help others communicate freely.   
<p>
We are honored today to have Mr. Zimmermann as a guest this week on High Tech
Today.  Mr. Zimmermann, welcome to the show.
</i>
<p>
<b>PZ:</b>
Hello Russell.  One thing I wanted to add: That is was <b>three</b>
years, not five.
<p>
<i>Host:
Three-only three years.
</i>
<p>
<b>PZ:</b>
Only three years.
<p>
<i>Host:
You were only under the knife for three years.
</i>
<p>
<b>PZ:</b>
That's right, it's not so bad (laughs).
<p>
<i>Host:
And you're fully recovered now?
</i>
<p>
<b>PZ:</b>
Oh yeah, I'm--I'm happy!
<p>
<i>Host:
Let's talk a little bit about what an encryption program does, to
give people a better view of what we're talking about.
</i>
<p>
<b>PZ:</b>
Well, an encryption program scrambles up information in a way
that's controlled by a cryptographic key and the way cryptography
used to work in the old days is, you send a message to someone that's
been encrypted with that key, and they have to use the same key to
decrypt the message--to turn it back into plain text.
<p>
But the only way you could do that was to have the same key.  And
that means you have to communicate to them what that key is.  Well,
you need a secure channel to do that.  You can't just pick up the
phone to tell them what the key is because if you're worried about
being intercepted then they could intercept the key--then they could
read everything.  So, that was a limitation of cryptography.  In
fact, that's been the problem with cryptography since the days of
Julius Caesar.  How do you do the key distribution.  Well, this was a
problem that would mean that cryptography could never be used by
millions of people in their daily lives.  Governments could handle
this by putting a guy on an airplane to Moscow with a briefcase
handcuffed to his wrist containing keys that he could take to the
embassy there so that encrypted communications could ensue between
the embassy and Washington, but if you want to just talk to your
cousin in New Jersey, you can't just have couriers and briefcases
handcuffed to their wrist.  That's just not reasonable for ordinary
people to do.  
<p>
So ordinary people can't use cryptography if they're hobbled by this
limitation of key distribution.  But in the late 1970's, some
mathematicians discovered a way around this with the invention of
Public Key Cryptography.  Public Key Cryptography allows you to communicate securely
with people that you've never met without the prior exchange of keys
over secure channels.  It does this by everybody having <i>two</i>
keys in a kind of mathematically related pair.  I have a unique
pair of keys and so do you.  My pair of keys is related is such a way
that each key will decrypt what the other key encrypts.  They have a
kind of a ying-yang relationship.  If I publish one of the keys and
keep the other one private, then you can encrypt messages to me by
using my <b>public key</b> to encrypt the message.  But I'm the <i>only
one</i> who can decrypt the message, using my corresponding private
key. 
<p>
Everyone who then knows my public key can then send me an encrypted
message, but no one but I can decrypt it, because no one but I has
the private key that goes with the public key.  If I wanted to send a
message to you, I would use <b>your</b> public key to encrypt it,
and you would then use your <b>private key</b> to decrypt it.
<p>
This solves the key distribution problem, and makes it [encryption] possible when
combined with the trappings of the information age--the ubiquitous
personal computers, email, modems, fax machines, digital cellular
phones, etc.  It becomes a force for social change.  It means that
millions of people can use cryptography in their daily lives.  It can
be seamlessly integrated into our communications infrastructure.
<p>
<i>Host:
I know one of the facts about cryptography is, with modern computers
I guess if they want to try hard enough they are still able to break
a message--is that true with your program?  If somebody really put
the supercomputers to work on it or you---
</i>
<p>
<b>PZ:</b>
That's right!  My program can be broken!  If you have enough
supercomputers working for long enough, they could break it.  The
question is, how long is that?  Well, I don't really know because
major governments, such as our own with the NSA, could have methods
of breaking it that are faster than we think that it would take.  
<p>
But if there are no tricks that they've learned that produce some kind
of breakthrough, if they are just having to use methods that are not
too much shorter that what we know in published academic literature,
then it could be from now until the next ice age before they can
break it.
<p>
<i>Host:
One of the other advantages of having a program like yours is that
everybody can use it, and the more people that use encryption, the
safer it is for everybody because, if only one person is using it,
the government knows who to look at.
</i>
<p>
<b>PZ:</b>
That's right.  There's safety in numbers.  An argument could be made
that as a matter of solidarity with the rest of the population you
should encrypt your email.  
<p>
If we lived in a society where everyone sent their messages on
postcards instead of envelopes--I'm talking about written
communications on paper--then anyone who decided to use an envelope
would draw suspicion because while everyone else was using a postcard
this guy decided to use an envelope, <i>therefore</i> he must have
something to hide.
<p>
Fortunately we don't have that kind of social expectation.  There's
nothing suspicious about putting your mail in envelopes.  So there
should also be nothing suspicious about encrypting your electronic
mail.
<p>
<i>Host:
Tell us a little bit about how you came about the idea of writing an
encryption program.  It sounds like an awful big task!
</i>
<p>
<b>PZ:</b>
Well, I've always been interested in cryptography since I was a kid. 
I started playing with it in fourth grade.  But none of the
encryption algorithms that were available to me as a school kid were
going to pose any problems for any major governments.
<p>
<i>Host:
The secret decoder ring and...
</i>
<p>
<b>PZ:</b>
...That's right.  But when I got to college I started applying
computers to it and I thought that I had really good, clever
encryption algorithms in college, but I later discovered that these
"very clever" encryption algorithms could be easily broken.  So that
was kind of a humbling experience.
<p>
I started seriously studying it in 1984.  I was writing a paper that
got published a couple of years later, and in researching that paper
I talked to many cryptographers and read as many papers as I could on
the subject in the academic literature and so, I think that's when my
learning curve became it's steepest. I've been full time in
cryptography for the last six years.
<p>
<i>Host:
You told me before the show that a lot of people contact you with what they think are better ideas.
</i>
<p>
<b>PZ:</b>
Oh.  Yeah.  I always get calls from people with their cockamamie
(laughs) encryption algorithms, which are usually about as clever as
the ones I had in college, that were easily broken.
<p>
<i>Host:
And, one of the problems there is that the, uh, responsibility of
what you're doing.  I mean, uh, people in Guatemala or something have to
communicate with each other, or some other South American country,
and your work is preventing the loss of lives.
</i>
<p>
<b>PZ:</b>
Yeah.  PGP is used all over the world by human rights groups, human
rights activists who are documenting the atrocities of death squads,
interviewing witnesses and using that to keep track of human rights
abuses, and they encrypt that stuff with PGP,  and they tell me that
if the government there could get their hands on it they would round
up all the witnesses and kill them, after torturing them first.
<p>
That's in Central America, and I talked to somebody working down there
on it.  The resistance groups in Burma are using it.  Burma has a
<i>really horrible</i> government, and there's resistance groups using
PGP in jungle training camps.  They're being trained to use it on
portable computers.  Then they are taking them to other jungle
training camps and teaching them.
<p>
They've said that it's helped morale there because before PGP was
introduced there, captured documents would lead to the arrest,
torture, and execution of entire families.  The government in exile
in Tibet uses PGP.  There's several other examples of third world
countries where brutal dictatorships are, where human rights
activists are using PGP.
<p>
<i>Host:
I would imagine the brutal dictatorships are also using it on
occasion, because that's the way it goes...
</i>
<p>
<b>PZ:</b>
Well, I would prefer that they not do that! (laughs)  I have no
knowledge of that, actually.  No one has ever told me of a foreign
government using PGP.  At least, certainly not any brutal
dictatorships.
<p>
<i>Host:
They rule with the iron hand; they're not worried...
</i>
<p>
<b>PZ:</b>
Yeah, you see, cryptography tends to equalize the power relationship
between the government and its people.  The government already has
all the power, all the guns, in most countries.  So, anything that
gives a little bit of power to both sides, evens the score a little
bit, and especially, since the people usually don't have the
surveillance powers that the government has, so the government using
cryptography is kind of a waste of--you know, it's fairly
meaningless, because nobody is wiretapping the government
communications.  Certainly not the disempowered people in those
countries, so there's no need to encrypt.  Maybe they would have to
encrypt to protect against surveillance from other governments but not
from their own people.  People in those countries  <i>do</i> need
protection against their own government's surveillance on them and
that's where PGP comes into play.
<p>
But PGP is used for a lot of mundane things here domestically.  It is
a domestic product.  It was released domestically in the United
States for domestic use.  It turned out though, that it spread all
around the world.
<p>
<i>Host:
In reference to the government lawsuit or case that they pursued against you
for three years:  Did they ever explain to you what it was that
really bothered them?
</i>
<p>
<b>PZ:</b>
Well, sure.  The particular law that I would have been prosecuted
under was the Arms Export Control Act.  The State Department has a
list of items that cannot be exported without a special license.  It's called the Munitions
list and most of the items on the Munitions list--are weapons. 
Missiles.  Machine guns.  And bombs.  But one of the items on the list
is encryption software, so, that means that you can't export
encryption software without a license from the State Department.
<p>
Now, since PGP was published in June of 1991, it didn't take long for
it to spread around the world, and it's free software, so it just
blows across the border like dandelion seeds blowing in the wind.  So
that kind of upset them.  And since that time, PGP has been
improved, by international efforts--people in Europe and New Zealand
adding features and making it better.  And now, PGP is published back
in the U.S. again, for the last year or so, and it's been improved
here also.
<p>
<p>
<i>Host:
Tell us a little about the way you go about the process of creating
new versions of PGP.  What's it like now, now that you're a "big star"?
</i>
<p>
<b>PZ:</b>
Well, I don't get to write any code anymore myself, I haven't written
code in years, the Peter Principal has taken its toll.  Instead the
software is written by others under my direction.  I guess what I
spend most of my time doing is going out and doing public speaking
and contact.  I'm on the rubber chicken circuit a lot...
<p>
<i>Host:
...And talking about the need for encryption, and freedom, and why
not talk a little bit about what all this means in a political sense.
</i>
<p>
<b>PZ:</b>
Cryptography is a very political technology.  And the reason why is
because there was a time in the past where it was important
politically, not at the grass roots level but at a strategic level. 
Governments needed it for diplomatic and military applications. 
World War Two was influenced by the Allies breaking the German Enigma
Cipher.  But, those were the days when computers filled rooms and
were made of vacuum tubes, and there were only a few around and
they were owned by governments.  
<p>
Today we live in the information age.  Everyone has computers.  All
the trappings of the information age are part of our lives.  Paper
mail is being replaced by electronic mail.  Digital communications
is taking over.  <i>We need encryption</i>.  The common person needs
encryption to function effectively in the information age.  So it's
time for cryptography to step out of the shadows of spies and military
stuff, and step out into the sunshine and be embraced by the rest of us.
<p>
If our government ever goes bad, as sometimes happens in a
democracy...  Sometimes in a democracy bad people can be elected, and
if democracy is allowed to function normally, these people can be
taken out of power by the next election.  But if a future government
inherits a technology infrastructure that's optimized for
surveillance, where they can watch the movements of their political
opposition, they can see every bit of travel they could do, every
financial transaction, every communication, every bit of email, every
phone call, everything could be filtered and scanned and
automatically recognized by voice recognition technology and
transcribed.  
<p>
As we extrapolate our technologies into the future, if the incumbency
has that political advantage over their opposition, then if a bad
government ever comes to power, it may be the last government we ever
elect.
<p>
<i>Host:
With the tools they'd have in hand, it would make Watergate look
like a student looking over their shoulder at the next student's
paper in comparison.
</i>
<p>
<b>PZ:</b>
That's right.  And so as a matter of good civic hygiene, I think it's
incumbent upon us, to examine public policy issues about technology,
and ask ourselves: "What technologies would strengthen the hand of the
police state?", and then don't deploy <i>those</i> technologies.
<p>
The Clipper Chip, from the government, is an example of this.  It's
an encryption device that the government wants to put into all of our
telephones someday, and it encrypts our phone conversation.  But,
each chip has a unique key that is used for encryption and decryption
and the government puts that key into the chip at the time of
manufacture and keeps a copy of that key in a vast government
database for wiretap purposes.  This is, I think, bad for democracy. 
It's better if we have control of our own cryptography because by
doing that, we have control over our own privacy.  And privacy is
a right that affects many other rights in the Bill of Rights.
<p>
<i>Host:
It's really the first right.  In terms of the Clipper chip:  That's
not really a very effective technology because it has a back door?
</i>
<p>
<b>PZ:</b>
Its purpose is to have a back door.  The whole reason for inventing
the Clipper Chip is to give the government a back door into our
encrypted communications.  So that your phone can have Big Brother
inside.  It would be better if we had private industry develop
telephone encryption, or fax encryption, or email encryption, that is
controlled by the individual users.
<p>
<i>Host:
In terms of sending email, we discussed earlier that everybody
<i>should</i> use encryption.  Usually that's a two-step process. 
You have to get your email all ready to send out, and then encrypt it. 
You're working with some companies to automate that, so that every
email they send is encrypted if possible?
</i>
<p>
<b>PZ:</b>
Yes, the newest version of PGP that's in development and will soon be
released [as of 2/2/96--ed.], is really a big subroutine package that can be called by
mailers, so that it's seamlessly integrated with the functionality of
an electronic mail package, so that encryption can just be a button
on a menu bar.
<p>
<i>Host:
Okay.  Why not give the http address where people can find this
program.

<b> Donald Norman ("DN"), Author, Things That Make Us Smart </b>
<hr>
<p>
<i>Host:  ...And you're listening to High Tech Today with your host,
Russell Hoffman.  My guest today is Dr. Donald A. Norman.  He's the
author of...Things That Make Us Smart...I wasn't able
to read the whole thing last night, but I read about three quarters
of it and skimmed the rest...It's a great book--it's very interesting. And,
we're going to be talking about the book, and about what he's talking
about.  So, I thought perhaps we would start--well, let's start by
welcoming you to the show, Dr. Norman!
</i>
<p>
<b>DN</b>:  Thank You.
<p>
<i>Host:  One of the most important things that I found in the
beginning of the book, the first half anyway--is discussing the
difference between 'experiential mode' and 'reflective mode'--
</i>
<p>
<b>DN</b>:  Um Hm.
<p>
<i>Host:  --and maybe you can just explain for our listeners, sort of
as a groundwork for the rest of the conversation, what we're talking
about.
</i>
<p>
<b>DN</b>:  Well, I got very concerned about the role that Hollywood is
playing in our educational process.  What I call the experiential mode
is the way you feel when you see a really good movie.  You know,
you're sort of caught up in the action, you're caught up in the
events, and the whole world around you disappears, and you are
experiencing everything that's happening on the screen.
<p>
The same thing happens, actually, when you're captured by a good play
or even a good book.  Any demanding activity where there's a lot of
things going on, that captures your mind--it becomes this
experiential activity and it's fun, it's exciting, it's engrossing.
<p>
However, it's not the way to create new ideas and new thought.  New
thought is what I call reflective.  You ponder this and you ponder
that.  You think of this idea, you compare it with that idea, you
reflect upon the ideas.  Reflective thought is harder, it's slower. 
It also requires external things, things that help make us smart,
like writing things down or using other tools.  Well, in some of the
new educational movements, we're very concerned about kids who are
engrossed by what they're doing--who seem to enjoy what they're
doing.  
<p>
But, enjoying what you're doing isn't the same as learning from it. 
And so I was very concerned about the use of multimedia technologies in
schools which gives the experiential effect, but don't really create
the kinds reflections that lead to deep thought and learning.
<p>
<i>Host:  Do you think there's a way to basically have both?  To have
a rich sit-back-and-learn educational experience, Edutainment,
whatever, and have it drop you into a reflective mode, almost at
will?
</i>
<p>
<b>DN</b>:  That's <i>exactly</i> what you want.  See, the trouble with
the educational system is it's <i>all</i> reflective mode.  Nothing is more
tedious and boring, if you're not careful.  What really, Hollywood
for example is really good at getting you interested in something and
keeping your interest, but wouldn't it be neat if you watched
Jurassic Park and saw those dinosaurs, then afterwards, you could say "Hey,
what kinds were those?  Is that really true?  Can you really make
dinosaurs out of DNA?"  And then go on and explore.  So, what I would
really prefer to see is this wonderful combination.  Educators know
how to put <i>content</i> in, but you know, their not so good at
motivating.
<p>
Hollywood is really good at motivating, but not so good at deep content. 
<p>
<i>Host:  They're willing to bend the rules, to make a good story,
and it would be nice if they didn't do that as often.
</i>
<p>
<b>DN</b>:  Or in fact, let you then discover how they bent the rules. 
You might actually learn more by having them bend the rules and then
having you--having your teacher make it so that you discover--see, that's
what a good teacher will do--will have it so that you think that you
discovered it by yourself.
<p>
<i>Host:  The Making of Jurassic Park is a great film!  
</i>
<p>
<b>DN</b>:  Um Hm.
<p>
<i>Host:  Another topic that I wanted to have you talk about is
"shared communication", which is something that is very difficult
with computers, I mean, we have networks but they're not really a
very efficient means of communication--your example about naval
communication on a boat.
<p>
What are the advantages of 'shared communication', and what are the
choices--what high tech choices do we have for doing 'shared
communications'?
</i>
<p>
<b>DN</b>:  Almost everything that we do is done with other people.  In
fact, the only time we do something all by ourselves is when go to
school, and we're supposed to study by ourselves and take exams by
ourselves.  But in the real world most of our work is done with other
people.  And when you're with somebody else it's really important that
each of the people know what's going on.  
<p>
One of my favorite examples comes from aviation.  If you look at the
cockpit of a modern airplane, it has two pilots.  The pilot on the
left who's called the Captain, and the pilot on the right who's
called the First Officer.  Well, it's a very interesting thing that
happens when you lower the landing gear.  The switch for the landing gear on
most aircraft is a fairly large lever, usually with a wheel at the
end so that when you pull it you feel the wheel and that makes sure
that you have the landing gear switch. 
<p>
Now, it's a pretty big, large lever, and when the Captain wants to
use it, the Captain has to lean across, towards the First Officer,
grab the stick and lower it. 
<p>
With modern computer control of airplanes, you could actually have
changed that completely.  It could be a tiny little switch under the
thumb of the Captain, and the Captain could just sort of flip the
switch, and the landing gear would come down.
<p>
Well, that wouldn't work as well.  With this really big switch, you
have to lean over to pull it down--it means that the other person in
the plane knows what you're doing.  You don't have to say anything. 
All you do is lean over and pull it--the other person can't help but
[notice].  And this has been a problem in newer airplanes.  On some
of the Aerobus planes, the stick--the wheel that the pilots use to
control the aircraft, is replaced by a small joystick.  In the older
airplanes, whenever you tried to control the airplane this big,
essentially a steering wheel, moved back and forth in front of both
pilots, because they were connected together.  Therefore each pilot
knew what was happening.  And when you switch to the high tech scheme
of a little joystick on the side, one pilot doesn't know what the
other pilot is doing, and it's not as effective in doing corroborative work.
<p>
<i>Host:  My guest today is Dr. Donald A. Norman.  He's the author of
Things That Make Us Smart.  The subtitle is "Defending Human
Attributes in the Age of the Machine."  You're listening to High Tech
Today.
<p>
...[break]...
<p>
Dr. Norman, why is it so difficult to write useful computer manuals?
</i>
<p>
<b>DN</b>:  Well, really, it isn't 'difficult'.  The problem is the
computer, not the manual.  See, if you really designed the computer
correctly you would really not even need a manual.  The point is that
the way computers tend to be designed, is by putting the technology
first, by putting the engineers and the programmers together,
producing this monster, and then "Oh, My Goodness! We need a manual!" 
And then the poor manual writers come in, and they're given this
incomprehensible machine, and [try] to make in intelligable--and
they're usually not given enough time!
<p>
Now, if you really want to write a good computer manual, the way I
would recommend is, when you're starting to design a new computer,
bring in the manual writers, and have them write the manual--first!
<p>
So, they're going to write a really simple and short manual,
that says only the basic stuff that you're going to need.  They'll
write a manual that's easy to understand!  And now, the trick is to
get the engineers and programmers to build a computer that matches
the manual!  That's the correct way to do it!  The problem is not
with people who write the manuals.  The problem is the system
that we use today.
<p>
<i>Host:  That--that's a great answer--with my fifteen years of computer
experience--let me tell you folks, that's a great answer--and I
appreciate it.
</i>
<p>
<b>DN</b>:  Oh, thank you.
<p>
<i>Host:  Okay, another question I'll throw at you:  What can be
done to make online information retrieval easier to do?  I mean, it's
really difficult.  You use in your book the example of OAG, the
"Official Airlines Guide" and comparing using a voice system and
using your pocket guide, and I've tried using CompuServe to get
flight information, and I find that much more difficult than just
calling up and waiting for the next available representative.
</i>
<p>
<b>DN</b>:  Although you do remember that when you call the next available
representative, that person is using the Online Guide to help you. 
So the problem is simply the tools that we're given.  Now I happened
to have switched over completely to an electronic OAG.  The
Official Airline Guide now sells floppy disks that you can subscribe
to, and every month they come in the mail and I load them into my
computer.  And <i>that</i> is a superior method.  I find it even
better than the paper method because, with the paper method you want
to make--well in fact, on Saturday I'm flying to Olso, Norway, and to
do that I have to fly through Paris, and then take a plane from Paris
to Oslo.  
<p>
And it's really hard when you're trying to use the paper manuals, you
have your fingers in several different places, trying to make
connections.  And with the electronic one, you just--Poof--suddenly
get all the flights from here to Paris, then--Poof--get all the
flights from Paris to Oslo, and you quickly can compare the two--you
have the two simultaneously on the screen.
<p>
The problem is that most of the people who design these online tools,
haven't thought about people.  Haven't thought about the typical way
in which we use systems.  The online tool used for reference, can be
far superior to paper tools, but only [if] the people who design them
start off by studying what people really do with them, and how they
like to use them.  Then it would be better.  If you just have
engineers who--boombiddyboom--put together whatever they can real
fast and say "Here!  All you have to do is hit Command-Alt-F15", it's
a disaster.
<p>
<i>Host:  What about database access, where there is so much
information, and you're trying to scan for pieces that you don't even
know are connected.  What sort of guidelines could you suggest to us for
making that sort of search easier?
</i>
<p>
<b>DN</b>:  It's the same problem.  Today, you have the computer
scientist, who will study carefully the ways of storing information
in a way that's most efficient for a computer.  And then they devise
a language--a query language, they call it, to get information out of
the database, and you have to be pretty precise in your
specification.  Well, no wonder people can't use it!  People don't
think like computers, people think very very differently.
<p>
The proper thing to do is to start off by asking, what kind of
information people care about, and what they know about what they are
searching for.  I mean, it's an interesting thing that when we go to
a database to find out something, we don't know what we want!  If we
knew what we wanted, we wouldn't be looking for it!  If you don't
know what you want, you don't quite know how to ask for it.  So, what
you really want is a system that's built around that, you can sort of
ask <i>something</i>, and the system will come back and give you
something, and you say "No!  That's not what I want!"  And, if you do
it right the system says "Oh, well, how about this?"
<p>
And, what you want is a dialogue.  You don't want to have to perform
a careful query.  This nonsensical query.  What you want is a simple
dialogue with the system, and each time you get kind of closer, and
then eventually you'll either find what you want, or better yet,
you'll find something you didn't know you wanted, and you'll say
"Hey!  That's neat!"
<p>
There are such systems, but the important point is, to design it, don't
start with the computer system, start with the person.
<p>
<i>Host:  My guest today is Dr. Donald Norman, the author of Things
That Make Us Smart, and is this book--this is just an--let's see, how
do I ask this question:  Is this a rebellion against assembly lines,
among other things?
</i>
<p>
<b>DN</b>:  It's a rebellion against assembly lines, it's a rebellion
against treating people like machines.  But it's <i>not</i> a
rebellion against technology.  I mean, I'm a technologist.  I believe
in technology.  I work for Apple Computer!  But what I believe in is
making technology humane.  Making--Understanding people, and then designing
the technology for people.  
<p>
By the way--Can I give an advertising plug, if you like the book?
<p>
<i>Host:  Sure, go right ahead!
</i>
<p>
<b>DN</b>:  If you liked the book, then look at the movie!  The Voyager
Company, which does really marvelous multimedia books and also the
Criterion Laserdisk series, the Voyager Company has brought out this
...CD-ROM. It's called First Person: Don Norman.  And it has three of
my books.  It has The Psychology of Everyday Things, Turn Signals
are the Facial Expressions of Automobiles, Things That Make Us Smart
and then it has me in video, so as you read Things That Make Us
Smart, suddenly I show up on the page and you click on me, and I say
"Hey!  I'm glad you asked!"  And I try to re-explain, or sometimes
say, you know, "I got it wrong here in this book and here's what I
really think today."  Or I give examples and demos.  And then, just
to make it fun, there are even some examination questions from the
courses I used to teach using these books.
<p>
<i>Host:  And that's Voyager, came out with that disk?
</i>
<p>
<b>DN</b>:  The Voyager Company.
<p>
<i>Host:  They're the same company that released A Hard Day's Night--
</i>
<p>
<b>DN</b>:  That's correct.
<p>
<i>Host:  --on CD-ROM, which is a delightful addition to the movie! 
It's got the text... They do good stuff!
</i>
<p>
<b>DN</b>:  Yeah, they do things that make us smart!
<p>
<i>Host:  (Laughs.)  Let's see.  One of the examples that you gave in
the book concerned people who use digital watches, if you ask them
what time it is, they give you the exact time to the minute, and
invariably, their watch is probably off by more than a couple of
minutes, or at least a couple of minutes and you didn't really care
that accurately.  If you were that accurate yourself, you'd probably
carry a digital watch, with an uplink to the national time...
</i>
<p>
<b>DN</b>:  Yes, I in fact--Just like I do!  I'm wearing a digital watch
and just Sunday, I dialed in to WWV and corrected my computer clock
to the second, and of course set my digital watch.  That, by the way,
is something I should not be proud of!  It's something that's
actually a sign of succumbing to technology.
<p>
<i>Host:  (Laughs.)  But if <b>I</b> want to know what time it is,
I'm going to ask you!  (Laughs.)
</i>
<p>
<b>DN</b>:  I was in Australia, giving a radio interview in the studio,
and I saw the best digital clock I've ever seen.  Because, you ask
somebody what time it is and they say "It's 7:58."  7:58?  Why don't
they tell you it's two minutes to eight?  That's because, you know,
with an analog watch you'd say that--it's almost eight o'clock. 
But a digital one, it tells you, 7:58.  So, with this digital clock
in the radio station, that's what it did, is it would say it's 7:15,
it's 7:20, it's 7:30.  And then it would say it's twenty minutes to
eight, it's fifteen minutes to eight, it's ten minutes to eight.  I
thought that was very clever.
<p>
<i>Host:  Well, Us--us Radio People need to know because we have to
break for commercials and we have to go off the air when our show is
over, otherwise the engineers get really upset.
</i>
<p>
<b>DN</b>:  Um Hm.
<p>
<i>Host:  Anyway, let's go with another question here:  What new
input and output devices do you think we'll see for the computer,
because it seems like the ones we've got a pretty archaic.
</i>
<p>
<b>DN</b>:  The first one I think that will be with us--this is
just--(laughs) let me answer that by saying what <i>old</i> input device
I think is going to stick around for a long time, and I think that's
the typewriter keyboard.
<p>
<i>Host:  Uh Hh.
</i>
<p>
<b>DN</b>:  Typewriter keyboards, for all of its faults and all of its
problems, is still the most efficient way of entering text.  Now,
obviously in some far future time we're going to have speech input. 
<p>
We already have simple speech input, and I've used a couple of
telephone answering systems that recognize your speech, and do a
really fine job.  But, today's speech input is very limited.  You
usually have to train the system for a long time to recognize you,
and then it won't work if you have a cold or something.  Or, you have
to have a fairly small vocabulary and speak...very...distinctly.
<p>
It would be decades before we have really good speech understanding
systems, because the real problems is not understanding the words
that [we] speak, the problem is understanding the language, and the
meaning behind those words.  And there, you know, we can't do that in
research laboratories and universities yet, it's a long way away. 
But someday that will come.  
<p>
What I expect to see coming fairly soon is, oh, say, gesture devices,
pointing devices.  I could be able to sit at my TV set and lift my
hand in the air and lower it, and have the sound lower, or wave my
hand and have the channel change, or make a circle with my hand and
have the mute go on.
<p>
We should be able to have gesture systems.  A little TV camera that
looks at you and recognizes what you're doing and then responds
appropriately.
<p>
<i>Host:  Well, there's certainly examples of that in the labs and at
the shows, where you can step onto a mat or a carpet or whatever and
pretend to be playing the drums and, you hear the drums being played
according to where you're waving your arms--
</i>
<p>
<b>DN</b>:  Exactly.
<p>
<i>Host:  --so the technology, clearly, is available for that.  I
guess it's just too expensive, and--and not perfected for home use.
</i>
<p>
<b>DN</b>:  Right now it's too expensive; it doesn't do well with
complicated background, and it isn't completely reliable, but that's
exactly what I'm thinking of.  If you can sort of see it demonstrated
today, then in ten years it will be affordable.
<p>
<i>Host:  My guest is Dr. Donald A. Norman, and you're listening to
High Tech Today...
<p>
...[break]...
<p>
Let's turn to another topic here.  My question concerns video stores,
and its: When will downloadable and online movies be replacing
video--the video store as a means of getting your movies.  Now, as an
aside, when I rent a movie, what I prefer to do, is to go over to my
friend's, who has thousands--literally thousands of movies, and he's
seen them all!  And when I want to get a movie from him, I ask him
what it's about, and what it's like, and how gory is it, and if it's
not too gory, and it's got a good plot, I'll borrow it.  Not only is
this cheaper, but it assures me that I'll get the movies that I'll
really want, are much more likely to, anyway.  So, what's that
replacing is the box, and the expert, all at once.  What are they
going to do to get rid of these video stores, which seem like a
terrible waste, and yet they're so common, and everybody uses them.
</i>
<p>
<b>DN</b>:  Well that's actually several questions in one.  They're very
good questions, and they're points that I've given quite a lot of
thought to.  Let me take the friend first.  You're very lucky, you
have this friend nearby.  Most of us don't have friends nearby who
have such extensive knowledge and collections.  But all of us have
friends who share our taste, or maybe even have a friend we know we
think just the opposite of, and we often check with them about movies
or books before we go and see them or read them.
<p>
One of the things we're trying here is an experimental program that is
a way of letting you select books, and also movies, by looking to see
what you're friends like, so that in short, you can join this cooperative
thing.  When people see a movie, they say "I really hated it" or they
say "That was a neat movie."  And they give a short description.  And
what happens is over time, you build up the preferences of these
people, and you kind of decide which ones you match, because after
you've seen a movie, you can give your opinion, and then you decide
which people it matched with.  What happens is after a while--it
doesn't take very long--you have this really neat set of advisors,
and next time you want to see a movie, you sort of say "Well, what do
you suggest?"  And your computer has sort of figured out which people
are like you, and which people are not, and it therefore can
make--kind of like your friend does--and make a suggestion that is
intelligent.
<p>
Well that's only one problem, which is--what am I going to see next? 
But as we move towards movies-on-demand, move towards the case where
TV stations, or cable stations, or maybe even your electric utility
company is going to have tens of thousands of movies available, you
simply say which one you want.  The selection process will be a big
problem.
<p>
<i>Host:  It already is!  I've found myself spending half an hour in
the video store, trying to pick a ninety minute movie.  
</i>
<p>
<b>DN</b>:  Yeah. (Laughs.)   I've noticed the same phenomenon myself. 
This should help.
<p>
<i>Host:  And, also:  In terms of having the computer recognize what
I've been watching, and decide what I want to watch next, that has
the problem that I always want to watch something new and different,
that I've never seen before!  How is the computer going to make 
<b>that</b> decision?
</i>
<p>
<b>DN</b>:  Actually, we know that.  And we've actually built quite a bit
of intelligence into this program so that--we realize that.  That you
sometimes want to be surprised.  You don't always want to see things
like what you've been seeing.  In fact you might very well want
something just the opposite of what you saw last.  And actually the
sophisticated programs they're developing can recognize that.  
<p>
And you know--it can always ask you!  That's the important thing. 
You don't have to put all the intelligence in the computer.  You can
sometimes say, "Hey, do you want to see something like that, or would
you like to have a change of pace?  Maybe you'd like to be surprised,
and <i>you</i> answer what you'd want.
<p>
But let me get to the "when" question.
<p>
<i>Host:  Uh Hh.
</i>
<p>
<b>DN</b>:  The "when" question is interesting.  It has nothing to do with
technology.  It has all to do with politics, and regulation, and
cost.  And as you know, there's a new teleregulations bill. 
Telephone, cable, TV regulation bill that's going through Congress
right now.  And that will actually change things dramatically.
<p>
There suddenly will be a lot of competition from companies wanting
to provide movies on demand.  Companies are going to spend billions
of dollars making the equipment available.  The weird thing is,
movies on demand are something almost everybody wants, but doesn't
use very much.  And moreover, the amount of money you're willing to
pay for a movie on demand is just a little bit more than you would
pay for renting a movie at the VCR store.  So, nobody quite knows how
it's going to work, because it's going to cost billions of dollars to
set it up, and you'll get three or four dollars per person, once a
week, twice a month.  The numbers don't add up.  So the real issue
here is not technology, the issue here is what we call a business
case.  When does it make sense to provide this?
<p>

<h1> Interview with Peter G. Neumann </h1>
<hr>
An interview by<a href="/index.html"> Russell D. Hoffman</a> on his radio show <B>HIGH TECH TODAY</B>. <p>
<HR>
<I>The following is a transcript of a radio show broadcast on radio station WALE. The views expressed are solely those of Russell D. Hoffman and his guest and do not necessarily reflect anyone else's point of view.</I><p>
<hr>
<b>August 4th, 1995</b>
<p>
<i>Russell Hoffman ("Host")</i>, <i>High Tech Today</i>
<br>
<b>Peter G. Neumann ("PN")</b>, Author and host of the Internet Risks Forum
<hr>
<p>
<i>Host:
...And you're listening to High Tech Today with your host, Russell
Hoffman.  My guest today is Peter G. Neumann.  Dr. Neumann is the
author of "Computer Related Risks."  He's the moderator the Internet
Risks Forum and works for SRI International in Menlo Park,
California.  
<p>
The book is published by Addison-Wesley, 1995, and in it, he
describes, oh I would say hundreds, of errors that have occurred
that have had in some cases major problems and in other cases,
haven't really caused many problems at all but nonetheless are worth
reporting.  The book is about trying to figure out how to reduce the number of
errors that computers cause.  So, I'd like welcome you to the show today,
Dr. Neumann.
</i>
<p>
<b>PN</b>: I'm delighted to be here, thank you.
<p>
<i>Host: And, let's see, where should I start with questions... A lot
of the book is about minor errors that cause massive headaches and
why don't we talk a little bit about what it is that's different
about computers that allows them to have such a domino effect, that's
not usually seen in life?
</i>
<p>
<b>PN</b>:  Well, if you're building a bridge, for example, and one rivet
falls out, it doesn't have much effect on the bridge.  In a computer
program if you change one bit, it can have cataclysmic effects in the
sense that the program can do something totally different from what
it's intended to do.  So you're dealing with sort of the difference
between the, oh, the conventional rubber band world, where you can
keep stretching the rubber band a little bit more till it breaks,
whereas if you take a computer program analogy, you bend it ever so
slightly, or twist it, or just touch it, and the whole thing falls
apart. 
<p>
The problem with computer programming is that you have no real idea of
whether the program you've written is going to do the right thing
under all possible circumstances at all possible times, and if you
look at the massive collection of stuff in the book you see that
there are an awful lot of cases where things <i>didn't</i> work the
way they were supposed to.
<p>
<i>Host:  A lot of times it's a combination of errors that causes the
problem.
</i>
<p>
<b>PN</b>:  Well, there's a long litany of different types of things, that
you'll find in the book.  For example human error is always
prevalent.  Environmental things are always interesting.  There are a
lot of cases where the environment causes difficulties.  For example
in medical health we have the pacemaker interference problem.  There
have been at least two deaths that I know of where people with
pacemakers have died because some stray bit of electromagnetic
interference interfered with their pacemaker--changed the setting of
the rate of the heartbeat, and wound up killing them.
<p>
There were five Blackhawk helicopters that crashed, that were due
to--that were apparently due to electromagnetic interference.  They
finally added some shielding to the helicopter circuitry and that
stopped that particular problem.
<p>
While I'm on that particular thing, the Sheffield was the British
vessel in the Falklands war, and they had to turn off their own
radar because their own communications were jamming their radar, and
that was the thing that let the missile through to blow up the ship.
<p>
There are a lot of cases where the environment itself is the cause,
but in most cases it's programming error, it's design error.  It's
having the wrong set of--the wrong concept of the system in the first
place.  In some cases you never should have built the system.  You
should have just realized that it never would work, and save your
money.
<p>
Still there?
<p>
<i>...[Connection went down so the station took a break]...
<br>
Host:  And, welcome back.  You're listening to High Tech Today with
your host, Russell Hoffman and my guest is Peter G. Neumann, and we
were both knocked of the air by a phone system flaw!  So Peter, why
don't you tell us a little about some of the problems that phone
systems tend to have!
</i>
<p>
<b>PN</b>:  That's very interesting! (Laughs)  It reminds me of the time I
gave a talk in Washington, and while I was driving back to the
airport, the entire Washington airport was wiped out electrically,
the power went down, and the airport was closed, and it was a real
mess!
<p>
Every time I seem to talk about a particular topic something nasty
seems to happen!  Maybe I'm the old Joe Bisquicpic character from Lil' Abner! 
<p>
In general, what happened I guess was a lightening strike on one of
the telephone switches and we both dropped out.  Telephone systems
have been taking a terrible beating lately from cable cuts that
have knocked down, for example, all three metropolitan New York
airports, the Chicago Hinsdale thing which brought down massive
computer communication outages as well, due to fires and floods.
<p>
Lots of cable cuts.  There have been maybe 15 different cable cuts where
somebody actually runs a backhoe through the communications cable and
downs airport communications, and computer systems, and stock exchanges and everything
else.
<p>
There's a lot of programming problems too that are experienced in
telephone switching, there's the 1990 outage where AT&T LongLines
were down for eleven hours basically, where no calls could go through
long distance, the result of a little programming error--a fairly
small programming error but it--it kind of multiplied itself rather
dramatically.
<p>
The telephone infrastructure and in general, communications
infrastructures that we depend on in this country are very delicate,
even though they're designed to work you know, things like 4 hours's
outage in 40 years.  Things have not been going that well lately and
no matter how carefully you design something, you discover that there
are fault modes that you hadn't anticipated.  So in generally, the
real problem is:  How do you design things that will work no matter
what happens?  And when you try to do that, you discover that you've
usually left something out.
<p>
<i>Host:  That it's actually impossible.  Now, I'm a computer
programmer, for the last twelve years I've been writing in Assembler
language, which some feel that that proves that I'm crazy!--
</i>
<p>
<b>PN</b>:  Not at all.
<p>
<i>Host: --But at any rate I have come to the conclusion that every
line of code that I write has three errors at least:  The first one
is a typo and that's pretty easy to fix.
</i>
<p>
<b>PN</b>:  (Laughs)
<p>
<i>Host:  The second one is a specific--what I would call a specific
logic error where the command itself is not the right command.
</i>
<p>
<b>PN</b>: Yep.
<p>
<i>Host:  And the third on is, once I've got the right command, it
doesn't work in coordination with the other commands around it and
with other commands hundreds of thousand of lines away from it.
</i>
<p>
<b>PN</b>: Yeah.
<p>
<i>Host:  I guess, talk a little bit about what computer programmers
should--sort of, what philosophy they should follow to write better
programs.
</i>
<p>
<b>PN</b>: Well, there's this wonderful quote from Einstein which says
that everything should be as simple as possible, but no simpler.  And
we're in this mentality, I think, where we try to oversimplify
everything.  And, the first thing you've got to do is deal with the
complexity of the problem that you're trying to program around, and
accept that fact that it's not altogether simple.  Once you've done
that you say  "Well, what are all the conditions that I have to
anticipate?  What are the things that could go wrong?"
<p>
Too often, somebody writes a little program that works just fine in
isolation, and you sort of put your finger on the problem that when
you put it together with something else it doesn't quite do what it's
supposed to do.  
<p>
The real beauty of this whole thing is to try and develop some sort of
structure to the program that you're developing so that it has some
simplicity to it if you look at it from a fairly abstract point of
view, and that the details are down in the individual little pieces
rather than in the interconnections.
<p>
As soon as you build something where all of the complexity is in the
interconnections, it fails.  Human systems do the same thing.  Where
you have to depend on a lot of people to get together within a very
narrow time frame to do something that will work perfectly--you lose. 
Because it doesn't work that way.  People are not capable of
performing perfectly on very tight time schedules. 
<p>
Well, computers don't either.  The first shuttle launch is a fine
example, where they discovered that the backup computer was not
synchronized properly with the four primary computers and they had to
delay the launch for two days 'till they could find out what the
problem was.  Very, very subtle error, and it was very hard to find,
even after they began to suspect what it was. 
<p>
So we're in a funny position here, where when you try to build very
large systems, you run into enormous difficulties.  And yet, the
universities tend to teach you--the trade schools or whatever tend to
teach that if you can write a little program you're fine--you know
everything you need to know.  Well, it's much more than that--it's
how you put it all together.
<p>
<i>Host:  And how you interface it to life.  You had mentioned
pacemakers earlier; my wife wrote a program to merge two pacemaker
manufacturer's company databases of pacemaker users.
</i>
<p>
<b>PN</b>: Wow--Fascinating.
<p>
<i>Host: And the idea is that every three months they have to be sent
a letter telling them that their pacemaker battery might be running
down.  And she refused to code an automatic name deletion program.
</i>
<p>
<b>PN</b>: Right.  That is very wise.
<p>
<i>Host:  It had to be looked at specifically by a human being to
compare, to make sure that nobody was improperly dropped.
</i>
<p>
<b>PN</b>: I think that's wonderful!
<p>
<i>Host: Yeah, she's good... I noticed in your book that you have about ten pages of errors in nuclear power plants and nuclear facilities--
<p>
</i>
<b>PN</b>:  Yeah--
<p>
<i>Host: --And you also have about ten pages of errors in space exploration and space
activities--
<p>
</i>
<b>PN</b>:  Yeah--
<p>
<i>Host:  --And one of the plans that they've had for getting rid of
nuclear waste is to rocket it to the sun.  Now it seems to me that
we're talking here about a multiplication of errors.  One really has
to wonder whether or not this is a reasonable solution to a deadly
problem that we've got on our hands right now.
</i>
<p>
<b>PN</b>:  Yeah.  It's interesting.  It's certainly not directly
computer related, but that's never stopped me from commenting on
anything before!
<p>
The key problem here I think, is we have to look at the problem,
whatever it is, in a very global perspective.  If you look at nuclear
power in the small, you say "Gee, it's cheap, it's clean, it's
efficient, and it will solve our energy problems for the next, uh,
how many thousand years."  If you look at it in the large, you come
to the conclusion that there is no solution to the waste disposal
problem, there are serious long term health effects.  Certainly the
Chernobyl experience is not very reassuring.  They're now talking
about what, thirty thousand people who've died at this point?  The
number keeps rising, whatever it is.
<p>
<i>Host:  Yeah.
</i>
<p>
<b>PN</b>:  It's gotten enormous.  And, so the real question is, are you
optimizing something from your own pocketbook, or from your own
personal perspective, or are you optimizing from the point of view of
the planet or the universe or whatever?"

<b>October 27th, 1995</b>
<p>
<i>Russell Hoffman ("Host")</i>, <i>High Tech Today</i>
<br>
<b>Dr. Nicholas Negroponte ("NN"), Founder & Director, MIT Media Lab</b>
<hr>
<p>
<i>Host:  My guest today is is Dr. Nicholas Negroponte.  Dr.
Negroponte is the founder and director of the MIT Media Lab, which
has been running for about 10 years, a little over ten years, they
now have over 300 people working at the lab.  First of all, I'd like
to welcome you to the show.
</i>
<p>
<b>NN</b>:  Thank you very much.
<p>
<i>Host:  And, the lastest thing that I've heard about--I'm always
hearing about something from the Media Lab.  But the latest
thing that I heard about is the Things That Think Project.  So, why
don't we talk a little bit about that.  There's a poem here that I
was faxed, a three line poem.  Why don't I read it, to give people
some idea of what we're talking about, but it will probably leave
them more confused!
<p>
"In the past, shoes could stink.
<br>
In the present, shoes can blink.
<br>
In the future, shoes will think."
<p>
Okay--what do we mean?
</i>
<p>
<b>NN</b>:  Okay.  Well, let me first of all say that we've started
this program very much with the idea of getting back into things that
are--I'll say, more risky, and even slightly crazy, because when we
started the Media Laboratory, which was, as you mentioned, over 10
years ago, a field like Multimedia was considered at best, off the
wall.  And of course, now it's a trillion dollar industry, and we
went from being sort of the mavericks and the charletons and the
pioneers to all of a sudden being the establishment, much too fast,
so we're trying to sort of now, reinvent ourselves, and look at
things that may sound crazy today, but will be probably equally
as established ten years from now, and the Things That Think program
is one of those.
<p>
It's the following idea:  If you can imbed computing in all sorts of
common objects, and that includes sneakers, then each of those
objects could have a personality that made it <i>better</i> at doing
what it was normally meant to do, and also allow it to do things that
it wasn't meant to do.  And so, we've got a whole lot of companies,
about forty in total, that make things that range from furniture to
carpeting to clothing to wristwatches, to all sorts of stuff.  And
the idea is to try and make these different things compute!  And, I
can give you some very specific examples.  
<p>
As part of this we have something called the bodynet, and that is, to
use the human body as the network.  You've heard of local area nets
in offices and you've heard of the Internet which is global of
course.  Well this is probably the most local network possible and
it's actually--it's your body.  And the students and faculty have
achieved to transmit, though the body, about 100,000 bits per second,
using the body itself as the transmission medium.  
<p>
So, if you wear a pair of sneakers such as ones that we've designed
with NIKE that actually have computers in their heals, the computer
can actually get not only energy, because as you walk or you run you
generate energy that's usually wasted--pushed into the floor or the
cement.  Here it's captured and it can power the computer.  And, you
shake someone's hand, who's also wearing these sneakers, you actually
can exchange 100,000 bits between yourselves.  So, imagine going to a
meeting in the future, or a conference.  You could shake the hands of
a few hundred people and when you go home that night, you just print
their calling card.
<p>
<i>Host:  You won't have to hand out business cards anymore.
</i>
<p>
<b>NN</b>:  Don't need to, you just need to shake someone's hand.
<p>
<i>Host:  Which right now, business cards have an amazingly small
amount of information on them.  Perhaps we should have computerized
business cards like credit cards.
</i>
<p>
<b>NN</b>:  But this is exactly what it--I mean, you can exchange all
sorts of information, I mean, when you shake someones hand your
computer can compare the people you know in common and all sorts of
stuff like that.
<p>
<i>Host:  Now, when I first read about this I thought we might be
talking about shoes that maybe tell you what your stride length is,
how many steps you've taken since the last time you looked.  Is that
also something that you're--maybe as an aid to one's health or
something like that?
</i>
<p>
<b>NN</b>:  Sure, that's actually quite easy.  And yes, and since
again the body can act as the conductor, you can take the person's
pulse because the wristwatch that you're wearing actually makes
contact with your skin, so your sneakers could in fact communicate
with your wristwatch very easily.
<p>
<i>Host:  Is anyone raising any objections to the use of the human
body as a transmission wire?  It seems to me--
</i>
<p>
<b>NN</b>:  Yeah, I understand your question.  It turns out that
using the body as a transmitter--we're putting in less amps into the
body than the headset of a walkman, okay?  These are nanoamps, these
are tiny, tiny amounts of current which as I say, are less than when
you're wearing a headset and listening to music.
<p>
<i>Host:  Not to mention all the microwave radiation, and FM and AM
all going through our bodies all the time anyway.  I've always
wondered what to do with those two bolts on the side of MY neck
but--what about--what are some other things besides shoes.  What can
you do with chairs, or with jewelery--or with carpet?
</i>
<p>
<b>NN</b>:  Again, this is a program that is all of one month old,
and--it's not even a month old, it officially started the 10th of
October, and it's a five year program, so--
<p>
<i>Host:  --so you get press very quickly!  Congratulations! (both
laugh)
</i>
<p>
<b>NN</b>:  But we've got a long way to go.  I probably could give
you a convincing example with a doorknob. 
<p>
<i>Host:  Okay.
</i>
<p>
<b>NN</b>:  Because imagine your front door, as you approach it, if
it could see you, and recognize that it's you, it could actually open
the door.  You don't have to put down the packages, or fumble for the
key and so on.  That kind of processing is not likely to live in the
doorknob itself, because it's relatively demanding, the kind of
processing you use.  So the doorknob would do some of the seeing if
you will--there would be a vision system in it.  That probably will
cost all of a dollar.  But it then might have to link to something
else that does the computing.
<p>
So Things That Think also includes Things That Link, because you
would want to talk to your toaster and your refrigerator and so on,
but each one of them doesn't have to understand English.  That can be
a shared resource.
<p>
<i>Host:  Let's see--the one with the carpet.  Now, I still just am
wondering, what's the carpet going to say to the shoe besides                
"don't tread on me!"
</i>
<p>
<b>NN</b>:  (laughs) Cute thing for it to say!
<p>
<i>Host:  Hopefully it actually won't say that!
</i>
<p>
<b>NN</b>:  Well, carpets are probably a good way to distribute
signals through a home.  One of the problems with computing in the
home when you want to distribute signals is that the wiring in the
wall is already there, and to add new wiring is very hard, and to use
radio frequencies or infared, it works but it's got problems.  If
it's infared, of course it doesn't go around corners.  Carpets
probably will end up being much more of the transmission medium
between objects.  Not so much the carpet trying to tell you something
itself.
<p>
<i>Host:  ...[break]... We're talking about Things That Think, and
one of the things that were mentioned is glasses that can look, or
that can see, as well as being seen through.
</i>
<p>
<b>NN</b>:  Right.
<p>
<i>Host:  I would think that's something that could help the
handicapped.  What other things, and how far have you gone on aids to
the handicapped, who's senses are in many cases deprived--they're
deprived of the 'full sense set'.
</i>
<p>
<b>NN</b>:  Well, I think--let me answer that beyond Things That
Think.  Because the mission of the Media Lab has been, and its original
purpose, was to make computers 'sensory rich' and more sensitive to,
and understanding of, more sensory rich information.  And you could
argue that the most sensory-deprived being in this world is a
computer.  So if you enhance its sensory abilities, and its motor
abilities, that work can be directly transposed to human problems. 
So, we build systems that try to see, and recognize for example
people, and faces, and machine vision is very much a part of our work
at the lab, I'd say it represents as much as 15% of our activity. 
<p>
And if we can build vision systems, and these clearly could be made
compact and tiny, and worn like a pair of glasses, to help a blind
person see, by the glasses seeing, and then perhaps telling the
person.  Glasses convieniently wrap around your ear.  You sort of
have almost a way of communicating the visual scene to the ear in
this sort of magical pair of glasses that are really 'eyes' in that
they see for you instead of you seeing through them.  Now, I'm just
speculating here, we don't have such a pair of glasses, but we do
work on vision systems and I wouldn't be surprised if as part of the
Things That Think program, we became <i>very</i> engaged in the sorts
of things that would help the handicapped--the hearing impaired, the
visually impaired, and again, even the motor side of the equation,
which is a bit more electromechanical than we normally get involved
with, but I think it's something we'll do.
<p>
<i>Host:  Are you working with nanotechnology at all?  Micromachines? 
Anything on that scale?
</i>
<p>
<b>NN</b>:  Well, we did--we had a PhD thesis on that subject, but we
haven't really persued it that much.
<p>
<i>Host:  What about machine vision. Why has that only been used a
little bit in factories, and it has taken--it seems to be staying in
the lab.  What's holding it back?
</i>
<p>
<b>NN</b>:  Most of the applications of machine vision, up till now,
have as you say been used in factory environments or the
idea that a moon lander can, you know, robots roving around on the
moon can sort of recognize sort of where to go and how to sort of
navigate by seeing.  These don't sound very relavant to day-to-day
life.  And you're absolutely right in that observation.  What we're
trying to do is build computer systems that can see people.  And sort
of, basically, not only know that you're there, but that it's you.
<p>
I ask the following question of many people, and you're going to have
to almost close your eyes to think about this, but:  Try pretending
to be your own personal computer.  You understand what I mean?  You
are, for this moment now, you are <i>your</i> personal computer.  And
try to imagine that situation.  When you're your personal computer,
first, you can't even see you.  You can't hear you.  And the most
that happens is you get poked at a litte bit.  Now, I know this isn't
the normal way to talk about the human/computer interface, but if you
try to look at it from the computer side of the equation, it's a
pretty crummy interface!  I mean, you're not giving me much to work
with!  So, if I could just see you, and if I could hear you, and if I
could do a few of those things, I think as a personal computer--I'm
still your personal computer--I could do a lot better than I can
today.
<p>
<i>Host:  Today's computers are really, notoriously slow.  Even the
Pentium chips are pretty weak compared to what we hope for, maybe in
the next ten years or so.
</i>
<p>
<b>NN</b>:  Umhm.
<p>
<i>Host:  So I would think that that's part of the problem, with
introducing vision, and then there's also I think, two kinds of
vision.  One is where you can see and recognize a particular person,
then you can say 'yes, this is the owner of this house.'  The
doorknob sees you and lets you in.  It's another one where you can
distinquish just between all females and all males.  Those are really
two different questions, I think.
</i>
<p>
<b>NN</b>:  No, they're very different questions.
<p>
<i>Host:  And, are you making more progress with one than the other?
</i>
<p>
<b>NN</b>:  Obviously, recognizing a given person, especially if it's
from a subset--
<p>
<i>Host:  To the exclusion of its twin--
</i>
<p>
<b>NN</b>:  Yeah, twins is a classic problem.  And, what it means is
that you probably would always use redundant systems.  I actually happen to be
married to an identical twin, and I have identical twin brothers, so
believe me, I understand twinness!  And, it is, that is the bug in
all of these programs, but humans fail too!  My identical twin
brothers who are both in their forties, I mistake them, if I see them
walking down the street, I really have to, almost, ask, they look so
much alike.
<p>
<i>Host:  It's not until you come across one of the differences,
really, it could be inflections in their voice--
</i>
<p>
<b>NN</b>:  Exactly--
<p>
<i>Host:  --Or their voice, or the way they look at you when you ask
that!  There could be small cues, like the horse that could count,
back in the Vaudeville days.
</i>
<p>
<b>NN</b>:  Right.
<p>
<i>Host:  It was actually responding to pinky movements or something
like that, from the trainer.
</i>
<p>
<b>NN</b>:  Exactly.
<p>
<i>Host:  Okay.  300 people at the Media Labs.  How many of them are
working on different--how many different things are you working on at
one time at the Media Lab?
</i>
<p>
<b>NN</b>:  The place is a little bit different from most labs at
MIT.  We have about 140 corporate sponsors.  And the 300 people are
more or less evenly broken, I'm just using rough numbers, 100 faculty
and staff, 100 graduate students on full salary--full scholarship,
and about 100 undergraduates on the payroll.  And at the moment,
there are a little over 100 projects.  Almost sounds as if we
purposely go out of our way to do things in hundreds, but this is all
quite by chance.  
<p>
And the projects are really chosen by the faculty, and the graduate
students that orbit any particular faculty member.  And my job is to
sort of connect up, or wire, these particular projects with companies
that are interested in them.  So, companies don't come to us and ask
us to do things as much as sort of join a club, where each person is
doing more or less what they want.  If they're not doing what they
want, there's a problem, and I better find out about it.  But, the
projects that people do really are driven by passion, not by some
request that came from corporation X or Y.
<p>
<i>Host:  So it's almost your position to link the thinker--the
faculty member or the grad student or undergrad--to the appropriate
project so that he doesn't feel that he's stifled, even though in
reality, in a way he sort of is because the sponsors just want what
they want.
</i>
<p>
<b>NN</b>:  It's--it's--from the faculty member's perspective, it
looks like the company is funding them to do exactly what they want
to do, and from the companies perspective it looks like the faculty
member is doing exactly what they want him or her to do.
<p>
<i>Host:  And that's the job of the manager.   ...[break]...  You just
finished up the 10th anniversary celebration on the Internet, for the
Media Lab.  Tell us: what results did you get out of that?
</i>
<p>
<b>NN</b>:  Well, the results aren't really in yet.  There was a
massive effort, to try and host 10 million people on the 10th of
October, as well as host, physically, a couple of thousand people
here at MIT.  So, we set up a web site which had a dedicated
broadband line, and literally hundreds of machines at this end.  And
we literally--every country in the world, and people from all over
tuned in, but actually sorting out the data, and getting you some
results of what's out there, that's going to take several weeks, if
not months.  But, it went very very well.  I was surprised that it
went as smoothly as it did!
<p>
<i>Host:  I checked it out several times during the thing, I never
had any problems getting there.  AOL, America Online, was a major
sponsor I guess?
</i>
<p>
<b>NN</b>:  America Online was a major sponsor, as was Intel, and
DEC, and a few others who were extraordinarily generous in putting
this together. 
<p>
We called it A Day In The Life Of Cyberspace, which is taken from
that series of books you're probably familiar with, A Day In The Life
of America, etcetera, and we are now working with Harper-Collins to
turn it into a book.
<p>
<i>Host:  Oh, so then you won't be sued for stealing their title!
(laughs)
</i>
<p>
<b>NN</b>:  No No!  We cleared that very carefully!
<p>
<i>Host:  The Media Labs--a lot of people like to see results
from scientific endeavors.  What sort of things have been pushed out
the door besides the multimedia work that you started doing, that now
is more commonplace.  What other things have been pushed out the door
from the Media Labs?  What are you proud of?
</i>
<p>
<b>NN</b>:  Let me answer that in two different ways.  I can point to
shrink-wrap products, like the Lego-Logo work we do, that is sitting
on the shelf, and 20 million children around the world are using it. 
And there are examples like that.  
<p>
But I'm more interested in a
second kind of transfer, which is in some sense the one you never get
credit for, I constantly tell the students and faculty here that the
best technology transfer you can have is the one you never get credit
for.  And since we have so many corporate sponsors--as I said, 140 of
them.  And they visit all the time.  We have a minimum of four
companies a day in this building.  And a lot of the ideas get
transferred in a much less formal way.  There's a great deal of
product, hardware and software out there, that originated here, gets
carried back to the company, then gets folded into a program, and
then appears, but it isn't a crisp, clean package that we've
delivered, it's basically an influence.
<p>
<i>Host:  A derivative product.
</i>
<p>
<b>NN</b>:  I think we're more in the technology influence business
that the technology transfer business.
<p>
<i>Host:  Okay, what--let's see, what's a good closing question since
we don't have much time left.  What do you see the Media Lab doing twenty
years from now?
</i>
<p>
<b>NN</b>:  Well, let's see.  Twenty years from now is a long way's
off!
<p>
<i>Host:  That's why I didn't pick ten!
</i>
<p>
<b>NN</b>:  Yeah.  One of the best things that you can do in a
laboratory is recognize when it's, when a mission is accomplished.
And it may be the case that twenty years from now the Media Lab will
be totally irrelevant, and something else like Biotechnology and 
Computing Resource is going to be what's here instead.
<p>
I think we have to be just as prepared to uninvent ourselves as we
are to invent ourselves.  So, twenty years from now--even I who likes
to think about that, has to recognize that the technology of
computing, whether it's still based in silicon, or if by then it's
more biological, I find it hard to predict.  So I keep my window
sort of like, five to ten years out.
<p>
<i>Host:  Well, things do tend to happen, I think, more slowly than I
ever expect them to happen in the computer industry.  I thought,
fifteen years ago we'd have fiber optic in every home by now.  And, I
don't know why I was misled, because we should have fiber optics in
the home.
</i>
<p>
<b>NN</b>:  Well, look at the World Wide Web.  I mean, people didn't
even know what that was, and it's doubling now every 55 days.  So
some things happen very fast.  Netscape, the browsers that follow the
World Wide Web.  I mean--it's--it's speed.  I think we're going to
see in the next few years things moving much, much faster.  I agree
with you completely, in the past I was always disappointed.  It
seemed to take, like, <i>ten years</i> for an idea to go from the lab
to be actually a product, and that cycle time is dropping very very
fast.
<p>
<i>Host:  Okay.  What about--we only have about a minute and a
quarter left, and this is an unfair question in so little time.  But,
there's a new product out called JAVA.
</i>
<p>
<b>NN</b>:  Umhm.
<p>
<i>Host:  And, one of the problems that I see, as someone with a long
time in 'the biz', is the potential of spreading viruses though a
product like that.  In thirty seconds or less, what is the Media Lab
able to do, or been doing.  Have they been working on anything that
can help us?  That can protect us from things like that?
</i>
<p>
<b>NN</b>:  I think we have to protect us from all sorts of things. 
Not just viruses but security and privacy in general is a big topic. 
And I'm not very good at the dark side of things.  I'm a very
optimistic person, so I don't think too much about the dark side. 
But the dark side side really is security and privacy, and that
includes security from viruses.  We're going to start to do more and
more in that area, in the past we haven't done much.  But, I think
that when people talk about the Internet, and they think about the
Internet, they should realize that in the digital world it is
potentially <i>far more secure</i> than the physical world.  Right
now it's <i>not</I> secure because our government has some very odd
ideas about export controls of encryption that just has to change.
<p>
<i>Host:  My guest has been Dr. Nicholas Negroponte.  Thank you very
much for being on the show.  You've been listening to High Tech
Today. Bye Bye!

<i>Russell Hoffman ("Host")</i>, <i>High Tech Today</i>

<b>Jim Warren ("JW")</b>, Famous computer person.
<hr>
<p>
<i>Host:  ...And you're listening to High Tech Today with your host, Russell Hoffman and my guest today is Jim Warren.  Jim Warren is a... "a government information access nut".  He's trying to get us information from our government, through the Internet.  He has a couple of credentials I'd like to discuss--to tell you about.
He was the founder and publisher of InfoWorld.  Also the founder and publisher and editor of Silicon Gulch Gazzette AND the founder and editor of Dr. Dobb's Journal of Computing.  And DataCast.  And the West Coast Computer Faire!  And more!  
And he's the recipient of numerous awards, the Hugh Hefner First Amendment Award, the James Madison Freedom of Information Award, the Society of Professional Journalists, he's the founding chair of the First Conference on Computers, Freedom and Privacy in 1991 and uh... and I've only scratched the surface!  But I guess I'll stop scratching and let you introduce yourself.  Welcome to the show, Mr. Warren!
</i>
<p>
<b>JW</b>:  Thanks for having me.  Basically the credentials simply say I can't make up my mind what I want to do when I grow up.  (Laughs.) 
<p>
<i>Host:  Well, I guess you've got a way to go here, you--you're all over the board!</i>
<p>
<b>JW</b>:  Yeah!
<p>
<i>Host:  National Science Foundation lecturer, uh... and it goes on!</i>
<p>
<b>JW</b>:  Now you're really reaching into history!  (They both laugh) When you're pushing sixty you can have three or four careers behind you!
<p>
<i>Host:  In fact I think you should!  I'm working on a few myself...</i>
<p>
<b>JW</b>:  Yeah--my condolences!
<p>
<i>Host:  Anyway...  I think--What I'm particularly interested in today is your--what you've done for California, getting information from the Government to the people, through the Internet and through other online services.</i>
<p>
<b>JW</b>:  I'll talk about this briefly and only from the perspective of what can be done anywhere, rather than --
<p>
<i>Host: -- Right Right --</i>
<p>
<b>JW</b>:  -- what has been done in California.  Simply using California as an example.
<p>
<i>Host: As an example of what can be done.</i>
<p>
<b>JW</b>:  Yeah.  One of the neat things about it is that the Internet is a potent grass-roots political action tool.  And let me illustrate how we used it here in California, or how I used it and folks on the net used it to put things through here in California.
<p>
In 1993 a freshman member of the Lower House of the California Legislature, which is called the Assembly, not knowing that freshman don't introduce substantive bills, dropped a bill in the hopper, that would mandate that all state legislative information, that's already been computerized for close to ten years at the time, would be made available to the public by dial-up access by computer modem.  
And she immediately ran into a quiet political firestorm of people saying "Oh no no, we don't want to do that!"
<p>
The first ones that came out of the woodwork saying "we don't want to do that" were the people who run the legislative data center saying "Well,--"  and it took a while for them to say this, but the substance was they were selling this information for five hundred thousand dollars a year!  They were making a nice healthy little revenue--a non tax base, off- budget revenue stream, peddling the legislature--the public legislative information in computerized form--and they didn't want to give it away!  And that was part of her legislation.  
And then there were political tiffs with senior legislators who didn't want a junior legislator to have credit for doing something substantive like this.
<p>
Anyway, the upshot was, that when the bill was introduced, simply, it was D.O.A.  It was Dead On Arrival.  Because the legislative data center first came over and said, "Look, we'll be happy to do this--" They don't say no to the legislator, they say "Of course we'll be happy to do it!  Here's what we need in order to do it:  We need you to buy us a complete new mainframe computer  (because we're running on an IBM mainframe and that's the only thing we know).  
We can set up a complete statewide computer network to allow this dial-up access.  We'll have to have new staff to run all of this.  And it's going to cost millions and millions of dollars."
<p>
That's the way bureaucrats kill legislation they don't want to see in action.  And between that and the legislator not really having  any constituents lined up to support the bill, the bill was dead.  
<p>
Well, somebody knew that I had written a number of columns about access to public records--computer assisted access to public records--and faxed a copy of the bill to me, and I wrote a column about how this is a really neat bill and we ought to support it, and sent a pre-publication copy of the column to the bill's author, with a hand-scribbled note saying "Hey!  Neat Stuff!  Go For It!" 
<p>
I got a call about an hour later from her aide saying "Well, this is real nice.  And we appreciate the kind words, but I'm sorry to tell you, the bill...is in great difficulty."  
And as we discussed it, she first of all talked about the legislative data center wanting the monster computers and a state-wide network and all sorts of other staff, and I said, well, why don't they just put it on a desktop file server on the Internet?  And she said, like most lay people would, "What's that?"  (laughs.)  And I said, "Trust me.  There's an easy, cheap way to do this! Are there any other problems?"  
<p>
And then she mentioned that they really didn't have any constituents who they could identify that would support it, and I said "What do you mean?!  There are LOTS of people who would support free, public access by computer net--particularly in a state like California which is a high-tech state--to the legislative information.   All you need is evidence of their interest--of a constituency that supports this?"  And this is perhaps one of the key things in all this babbling that I'm doing right now.  
She said "Oh!  Ten or fifteen letters or faxes supporting this legislation would be a strong showing of support!"  And I sort of blurted out:  "You mean out of 31 million Californians?"  And she says "Oh yes!"
<p>
<i>Host: (Laughs)</i>
<p>
<b>JW</b>:  Well, I went on the net that night and blitzed out a message saying what was going on, and giving their phone number and fax number and address, and I think it took her about three days to get her 15 faxes and letters.   And then, that was the beginning.  Suddenly this bill which was dead, was alive.  The stake had been pulled out of its heart and it was suddenly back on the table, as a possibly viable bill.  Then to get the bill through--against opposition from a number of circles.  
I mean, there were legitimate opponents of the bill saying simply, "we should not be giving away the public's valuable information--we should be selling it--"  to the public, they didn't notice that inconsistency.  
<p>
There were people who were dearly opposed to it, because they felt that we were giving away a valuable state resource.  But, through using the computer net--I was sort of in the middle of this.  I was coordinating communications out across the net, because I knew how to do that, and had a large number of contacts on the net, because I've been around the industry forever.  And, the staffer that I was working with, was working closely with the legislator.  
So that, they would find out when the bill was going to be in the next committee, what the committee members and the committee staff were thinking about the bill, they would feed that information to me, I would list out a message across the net, and essentially, this went through four committee votes, and three floor votes, in the two houses of the legislature, without a single solitary dissenting vote.  
<p>
And the reason was, every time they went to committee, which of course was agendized, and we would know about it several days in advance.  A couple of days before the committee was to have a hearing and vote, they were just blindsided with phone calls and fax numbers.  Now, you couldn't do that unless you had lots and lots of money--
<p>
<i>Host: --Or connections on the Internet--</i>
<p>
<b>JW</b>:  --with any previous technology. You could only  do it, we could only do it-- One person--I--could only do it economically, and fast enough, via the net.  Anything else simply wouldn't have worked because of the short lead time  between the time that the bill went on an agenda for a committee hearing and vote, and the time the committee hearing or vote was to occur, which was typically a couple of days away.   
But the net provided very fast response times, from a population scattered all over...the state.  And that was neat stuff.  
<p>
It was passed and signed into law in the end of 1993, took effect in January of 1994.  Today, that legislative information system typically gets 50 to 60 <b>thousand</b> hits a month, in people requesting information from it.  One of their concerns (of the legislators) was "Gee, nobody can do that!  That's just for yuppies and wire-heads!"  Well, it turns out that there are an awful lot of yuppies and wire-heads interested in free access to "the process of their own government", if you will.
<p>
<i>Host:  My guest is Jim Warren, and among his long list of credentials, he's the founder of Computer Chronicles!</i>
<p>
<b>JW</b>:  And the point is:  ANYBODY CAN DO THIS!...
<p>
<i>Host:  Yes!...</i>  [break]   <i>...We're talking about the Internet, and public access of government information, and the other side of that is, government access of private information--in other words, wiretaps.  I read an interesting article yesterday, that said that American freedom from wiretaps is significantly less when we visit foreign countries.  That's freedom from our own government's wiretaps while we're in foreign countries.
But overall, in America, what is the government doing on the Internet to make it easier for them to do wiretaps, what are the ramifications to our freedoms, our civil  liberties, and -- what's it going to cost us?</i>
<p>
<b>JW</b>:  Well, it's not just what they're doing on the Internet--they're much more interested in wiretapping the nation than they are in wiretapping the Internet in particular.  There are less than 1100 court ordered, court authorized wiretaps in the entire United States per year.  Now this is according to FBI information that was finally pried out of the FBI under Freedom of Information Act demands--it took almost a year to get it.  
Nonetheless, in spite of the fact that less than 1100 court-ordered wiretaps are authorized each year, the FBI and associated agencies, the NSA and probably the CIA, we don't know--went to congress in 1994 and in less than two months jammed through what they politely called the Digital Telephony Act.  
<p>
[The Digital Telephony Act] mandated that all public telephone systems would make themselves wiretap-ready within three years, and also authorized <i>five hundred million dollars</i> to implement that mandate--to pay the phone companies to make themselves wiretap-ready.  Now by wiretap-ready, they didn't mean okay, make it so that an agent can climb a telephone pole and clip onto a phone line and listen, or set up a stake-out in an adjacent apartment like they used to have to do.  
This means undetectable wiretap, at a keystroke, <i>of</i> any place in the nation, <i>from</i> any place in the nation, by anyone who can gain access to the system.  Now of course it's only supposed to be limited to government agents, and they're only supposed to be operating, as the bill says, when authorized by law.  
But these same agencies keep telling us that our phone system is being cracked by these vile, evil phone phreaks all the time, that it is a terribly insecure system.  Yet at the same time they want to make it easy, for anybody who can gain access to the system, to wiretap anyone!   
<p>
I mean, I can readily imagine that the industrial espionage people, that the foreign political spies, that the--just curious technoids who want to eavesdrop on everybody--I can readily imagine all sorts of people, the high tech private investigators that are already using all sorts of surveillance tools, can hardly wait until we spend five hundred million tax dollars to make the nation wiretap-ready, and it's already been passed.   
Incidentally, the bill was introduced, authored by Senator Pat Leahy and Congressmember Don Edwards, it was introduced to the day on the twentieth anniversary of  Nixon's resignation after he was unsuccessful in wiretapping Watergate and his political opponents.
<p>
<i>Host:  He didn't have good tools...</i>
<p>
<b>JW</b>:  Yeah, right!  Yeah, they just didn't have good tools!  Just think what an incumbent politician, and powerful bureaucrats can do with, and how tempted they will be to do it, with this kind of a Big Brother technology!  And it's already passed into law!  Now, what we were trying to do, this year, was to block the appropriation of the five hundred million dollars that was authorized for the legislation.  
And we were getting geared up to do that, until one lunatic, or one or two to three lunatics bombed the building in Oklahoma City, and now the Federal law enforcement has been using the actions of two or three people--or maybe it's even a dozen people--in Oklahoma City--to justify spending half a billion dollars to make the entire nation "guaranteed communication insecure."  That's what it boils down to.
<p>
<i>Host:  My guest is Jim Warren, who is a... an electronic freedom fighter?</i>
<p>
<b>JW</b>:  (laughs)  I'm--I'm interested in technology-related public policy and civil liberties issues.  Voiceless speech, bodyless assembly, inkless press.  
Electrons are fully recyclable and very fast.  It would be nice for all of us to have access to the kinds of tools that previously have only been available to the publishers who can afford to buy newsprint by the ton, and the public speakers who can afford to draw together a population or a group in a public place, and rent the public place and everything else.  
The net offers a phenomenal, democratizing, egalitarian tool to allow anybody who has a message to put forth, to in fact put that message out.  You don't have to own a printing press, you don't have to buy newsprint by the ton, to become a publisher.
<p>
<i>Host:  Why not talk to us a little bit about how far down the line you think the government should go in getting information to us through online services.</i>
<p>
<b>JW</b>:  It's easy to say we want public access to government information and we want it for free.  When we say we want it for free that simply means we want it prepaid by taxation.  However making information available in electronic form on the computer net turns out  to often be very inexpensive.  
It does however create a number of legitimate problems for government agencies--federal, state, and local; legislative, executive, and judicial, as far as what information they make available and how they deal with some of the complications.  For instance:  One of the major complications in making government information available to the public, in any form, but particularly in computerized form, is:  What do you do about personal information?  
<p>
Because, there is--almost--most of the information that government collects--...that may not be a valid statement--<i>a lot</i> of the information that government collects, is about individuals, and if you will, they collect it at the point of a gun.  You don't have the option as to whether or not you are going to give this information to the government.  They say "you are going to tell us all of this information, because we have decided that we need it in order to properly govern."  
And so we give up all sorts of very personal, very private information about ourselves to the government.  That then is typically and justifiably commingled within a government agency.  The private personal information is commingled electronically with components that are public record.  
<p>
And the question arises of, if when the agency commingles disclosable or public and nonpublic information in a single database, to maintain agency efficiency, how do they take care of providing public information to the public upon request?  It turns out that it's often a very difficult problem.  
One example might be arrest records.  Or various types of criminal investigatory records.  Now, during the process of an investigation those records are certainly not subject to public access.  But after an investigation is over, particularly if there's been a prosecution and a conviction or a finding of innocence, possibly those records should be available, at least to the target.  But what about the general public?  
<p>
There's a company down in Southern California, I think they're down in San Diego, that for several years was going down and culling through, each morning, going down to the police department and culling through the arrest records, computerizing the arrest records--and you want the arrest records to be public.  If they're not public, that's how people get lost in jail in other countries.  You want your arrest record to be public.  
But they would go through these arrest records, computerize them, and then start peddling them to anybody who wanted them, most particularly the example being, was they were getting D.U.I., driving under the influence records, computerizing them, and then peddling them to attorneys who wanted to hustle D.U.I. cases.  And they were also computerizing burglary arrest records and other "real" crime records, and peddling those to criminal defense attorneys,  etc.  
<p>
But there's immediately a problem, of how does an agency both operate efficiently, which means often commingling private information with public information, and at the same time provide the public with public access to the public parts of the information that they have?  And it's not helped at all by some agencies wanting to profit off of this.  
For instance, the Los Angeles County Court System is proposing to prohibit, or limit, access to their public computerized court records in computerized form only to the people who can afford to pay a high profit to the agencies--to the court in order to gain access to it--and furthermore prohibit the bulk of copying of the information of public record.  Bizarre!  (laughs)
<p>
<i>Host:  My guest today...</i>
<p>
<b>JW</b>:  Let me--Do we have another minute or so?
<p>
<i>Host:  Yeah.</i>
<p>
<b>JW</b>:  Let me just sort of just tie some of these pieces together.  I talked about legislative action, we talked a little bit about wiretaps, we haven't got into censorship yet and that's another hot topic, but basically what's at play here, is that the computer nets--the nonprofit, non proprietary, public, cooperative, anarchistic--that is nobody owns them and nobody manages them--computer nets--are <i>the most powerful tool we have ever had</i> for direct, grass-roots political action.  
More particularly, for the ability--for allowing citizens the opportunity to effectively participate in the process of our own government.  Because they provide the two essential prerequisites for a free society.  
<p>
Any free society must have, for it's the citizens, if they are to be free, in a free society, must as a first prerequisite have timely access to adequate information on which to base sound decisions about the community in which they live, whether it's the little village, or the town, or the city or the county or the state or the nation--or the world.  
If we don't have adequate information, and timely access to it, we can't participate in the process of our own government in an effective manner.  We can participate in it only as slaves to those who do have the information.  That's the first prerequisite.  
<p>
The second prerequisite is that the body politic must have the ability to effectively communicate with itself.  Citizens must have the ability to communicate with other citizens.  Because even if you have all the information, you can't effectively act in a political environment unless you communicate with your peers.
<p>
<i>Host:  And of course any information that you have available to you, if you lose the right to get that information, it's much harder to get it back.</i>
<p>
<b>JW</b>:  And the computer net provides both of those prerequisites.
<p>
<i>Host:  My guest today has been Jim Warren, and you've been listening to High Tech Today with your host, Russell Hoffman...  Thank you very much for being on the show, Jim!</i>
<p>
<b>JW</b>:  Thank you and I'll see all of you folks who want to participate in your own government, online!
<p><i>Host:  Bye Bye!</i>
<p>
<b>JW</b>:  Bye Bye!

<h2>
The Hoover Dam was
built to last -- as a working hydroelectric dam -- for 3,000 years.  The 
concrete won't even be fully set for centuries.  The rest of government 
policy should also recognize that America expects to have a future.</h2>
<b>The web pages presented here are designed to be scientifically 
accurate but easily understood.  They discuss some of the most complex
issues faced by today's environmentalists, from the point of view 
of a humanist, technologist and futurist.
<p>
These essays and articles have been linked to by prestigious 
environmental organizations around the globe -- and we thank everyone 
kindly for each of those links!</b>
<p>
<h2>I love technology and I believe it is vital to mankind's
future.</h2>
I have been a computer programmer for nearly twenty years.  I ride
the fanciest high-tech mountain bike money can buy (well, the
fanciest <i>my</i> money can buy, anyway!).  I have some
pretty good computerized tools.  But we must temper our use and our
love of technology within the limits of our fragile and 
complicated ecosystem.  And most of all, we
must believe that with our efforts, our world <i>will</i> survive!
<h3>Oh look! Mankind put another 1000 years under our belts!</h3>
But it will surely be our <b>last 1000</b> if we don't change something.
Right now, as we turn to a new millenium, our world is in crisis. 
Hardly a soul alive really believes the world is a clean, fresh, healthy
place to bring up baby humans and other living things.  We all see
the effects -- cancers among our friends and family, even our pets
and livestock.  Chest pains when we visit "the city" (whatever city
we live near. Or if we live <i>in</i> a city, just chest pains, day 
in and day out.)   Piles of garbage unattended, oil spills on T.V.,
old cars and old car batteries left to rot.  Everywhere we are assaulted 
by excessive packaging, throw-away tools, and eco-deadly lifestyles. 
Somewhere there's a balance but we know we haven't achieved it.  
<h3>We haven't even come close.</h3>
We in the "environmental" movement have been torn among tasks -- our
resources are stretched too thin.  We <b>must</b> unify!  Every voice
counts.  Every problem needs ten thousand voices to fix but only ten
people to do the damage.  In times like this -- <i>in these times</i>
-- each individual in the "environmental" movement must be as strong as 
a hundred polluters!
<h3>Frankly, we are losing a lot of the battles.</h3>
Maybe even most of them.  And so, many of us have become passionate.  
Others of us have given up--lost hope.  Many of us have focused on 
<i>one</i> topic -- we have <i>learned</i> to focus, we
have <i>learned</i> about empowerment -- but we must not lose sight of the
war while we fight our own individual battles.  There are no generals
to guide us.  (The other side seems to have all the generals.)
<p>
It seems we cannot <b>unify</b> because the individual causes are so vital, 
so drastic, and yet so varied, that each of us burns out in our own little 
world.  Sometimes we are fractured at the outset--one wants to save
the snail darter by not building a hydroelectric dam, while another
wants the dam built to stop the spread of nuclear power.  And
meanwhile, nuclear, coal, and oil are wiping out or deforming equally
deserving species.  
<p>
We live in a real world, with daily problems. 
Two billion people do not even have electricity--they will
<i>never</i> read this.  And there is no way we will be able to 
save every species, every habitat, or even every person.
<h3>Let's all try to keep our eye on the ball from now on.</h3>
We can't stop fighting for the things we each really care
about.  Nor should we.  But I believe that
everyone who wants a <b>clean earth</b> must somehow show a <b>common
spirit</b> so that the politicians and bureaucrats and most of all <i>the
polluters themselves</i> know that the jig is up -- we demand a
clean earth with free expression for everyone!  And I believe there
are more of "us" than "them".  But we are <b>so divided</b>, and 
<b>so torn</b>, and are working so hard trying to solve each
individual crisis, that as a movement, we are burned out.
<h3>Couch-potato environmentalism.</h3>
So when you read through these articles and you think "Gee, I should
do something" by all means <i>do it</i>.  Click on 
<a href="/misc/mailto/gov/elected.htm">President Clinton's
email address</a> and send him a message!  Send four or five
different ones before you leave
this site!  <b>Please!</b>  They <i>want</i> to hear from you!  They
<i>need</i> you to show them you are out there!  I've made it as easy
as I can for you, trying hard to give you lots of hotlinks to other 
organizations if you want more information and giving you lots of 
information to start with, in a nice, easy-to-read form! So take the
ball and run with it, for goodness sakes!  Now is as good a time as
you will ever get!  Before they get good at filtering out our voice,
or before they silence us all by cutting the Internet connection or
pricing it out of existence!
<p>
So please, read these essays, get angry about one or two of the
topics (your choice which ones), fire off a message to our 
<a href="/misc/mailto/gov/elected.htm">elected officials</a>, 
and then <b>get on with your life</b> and the things you feel
passionate about in your own world. (But tell others to visit us!)
<h3>You Can Do It To It Too!</h3>
Learn from these examples how to empower yourself, and get out and 
build <b>your own web sites</b> about the things <b>you</b> care about!  
But don't forget that each person who cares about the health of this
planet must take part in many, many causes.  A movement divided is as good
as a movement defeated -- and "they" know that.  
<p>
And if you are moved to do anything, <i>thank you</i> so very very
much!  I thank you.  The fellow environmentalists who have worked so
hard inside these movements I can only write about, thank you. And
believe me, Mother Earth thanks you and your children and your
children's children will thank you.  You might even thank yourself
some day.
<p>

<h3>Made in U.S.A.</h3>
These stories are written by an American.  A proud, free, 
American living in a proud, free land. They are distributed through a free 
Internet.  I've lectured from London to Florida to Boston to Los
Angeles about computers and technology.  Nothing I've seen in twenty
years of computer work compares with the Internet for what it can do
for us.  Without the freedom that my blessed country has given me these 
pages could not, would not exist.  
<p>
I believe that the so called-environmentalists so outnumber the 
polluters that <b>if we were unified</b> we would surely be able 
to change the world -- stop much of the utter madness.  And I 
believe the tool for that unification is available to us <b>right
now</b>, but who knows for how much longer?
We love the Internet and believe it is the greatest tool mankind has
ever had.  Let's use it.
<h3>But... There's always a but...</h3>
But even that freedom is being eaten away!  If you value
your free voice, or mine for that matter, if you want to be able to
talk about the things <i>you</i> care about the way I talk about the
things <b>I</b> care about, please honor and thank the people who are
fighting <i>that</i> battle.  They have names.  They have faces.
Let's not waste this tool, and let's not let them take it away! 
<p>
I had the opportunity to interview some of the people who are on the
front lines of the freedom-of-speech battle.  One of these
interviews, with <a href="/hightech/philspgp.htm">Phil
Zimmermann</a>, the author of an encryption program called PGP or
<i>Pretty Good Privacy</i>, has become a <b>download classic</b> at
this web site and is used in college courses and by movements and
individuals around the world.  Another interview is with famous computer
magazine publisher and "electronic freedom fighter" 
<a href="/hightech/jimwarre.htm">Jim Warren</a>.  
<p>
If you wish to preserve our freedom of speech on the Internet, 
I strongly suggest you familiarize yourself with what these people are
saying.	 And then, maybe you'll understand how important it is that
you click on "send" a few times and let other people know how you
feel!  
<h3>We can be a united voice!</h3>
We don't need to march on Washington (or maybe we do for our own 
catharsis) but if enough of us simply let the politicians know what 
we think, simply let them know that we are out there, we might start 
seeing some changes.  And anyway it's never too late to start trying.  
<hr>
<h3>The following web pages describe a variety of environmental problems 
and contain links to other sites and to other areas of this site where 
you can get more information.  But try to take the time to look at 
<i>each</i> issue, because each one desperately needs your voice added 
to it.</h3>

<hr>
Good morning Ladies & Gentlemen and WELCOME to HIGH TECH TODAY.  I'm your host, Russell Hoffman and today, we're going to be talking about a subject that--unfortunately--few people seem to even be aware of.  Space Debris.  Let me set a picture of what we are talking about.<p>
Before I begin, let me state my opinion.  I believe space exploration is a wonderful thing.  I believe we should colonize the moon as quickly as possible and proceed to other planets in short order.  I am for increasing NASA's budget by a factor of ten.  But for the rest of this show, I'm going to talk about the downside of our space policy.<p>
Space is commonly thought of as a vast emptiness.  Stars, planets, asteroids and gaseous clouds are contained within this vast void.  And this is a correct view of most of space.  But did you know that within the part of space known as near earth orbit there is a lot more stuff in space?  It's man-made junk.  
Billions--BILLIONS--of pieces of old space ships, satellites, rockets are right now orbiting the earth at speeds between about 20,000 and 25,000 miles per hour, at altitudes from hundreds of miles to many thousands of miles around and above the earth.  What does this mean?  What am I talking about?  What are we worried about?<p>
A BB-sized piece of aluminum hurtling around the earth at 22,000 miles per hour has about as much kinetic energy as a bowling ball does at 60 miles an hour.  In other words, if a BB-sized piece of aluminum strikes the space shuttle from a perpendicular direction, that is, comes in from the side, it will have the same force as a bowling ball would if dropped on the space shuttle from about 100 feet high.  
If the BB-sized piece of aluminum collides head-on with the space shuttle, the effect would be much, much worse.<p>
To put this in perspective,  the heat shields on the space shuttle can be scratched and broken with a fingernail!  So imagine what a bowling ball dropped from 100 feet could do! <p>
But there are, of course, much bigger and more dangerous pieces of space junk than BB-sized pieces of aluminum.  A piece of space debris the size of a small marble, traveling at 22,000 miles per hour, has the kinetic energy of a 400 pound safe dropped from about 100 feet.  Imagine the damage that would do if it hits something like the future space station FREEDOM, or a space ship.<p>
Before I continue, let me point out that my data for this topic is taken largely from government documents and at the end of the show I'll cite some sources for more information and I hope that you'll write to NASA and your senators and congressmen and  express some of the outrage I feel about this topic.  But before I get to that let me finish explaining this topic that many of you probably find pretty strange.<p>
You may be wondering--why worry?  Is this stuff going to fall on my head?  The answer to that is--and I almost want to say unfortunately--is NO.  Most space debris will not fall to earth for thousands and even millions of years, and the vast majority of what does fall to earth will incinerate itself when it hits the upper atmosphere.<p>
So to that extent this is not something you have to worry about and I'm not trying to scare you into wearing a hard-hat whenever you go outside.  Not that that would do you any good, but it's not even the issue.  Space debris is a problem for space explorers. Which is what we want to be!  
Mankind has an insatiable quest for knowledge, for exploration, and for discovery.   That's why what we've done to near-earth orbit is so shameful and disgusting.<p>
Space debris is almost entirely a man-made problem.  There are a few pieces of natural space junk orbiting the earth, but more than 99.9%--is man-made.  Within 2000 miles of earth some 7 million pounds of space junk is orbiting.  And nearly 4 million individual pieces -- and, these numbers are a little bit old so the true figure at this point is probably half again higher than what I've just given you.  And these are Government figures.  
In fact, about every seven years since about 1965 the amount of space debris in near-earth orbit has doubled.  And you thought that NASA was stupid just because of the Challenger disaster, or the loss of astronauts Grissom, White, and Chaffee in a fire!  Or Apollo 13.  No, the truth is that NASA's worst nightmare is yet to come.  <p>
The true legacy of man's early exploration of space will be that future generations will curse us and despise us for polluting that part of space through which all other space exploration must start--near earth orbit.  We are in essence closing the door in front of us--the door to the stars.  The door to the other planets and to the moon.  Indeed, the door to mankind's future.  
By making all future astronauts run a deadly gauntlet at the start of every flight, we have guaranteed that accidents, disasters, and major malfunctions (as NASA first described the Challenger disaster) will continue to occur.  <p>
And--I've only touched the surface of this problem.   For example, scientists recently calculated that the problem is so bad that in the future, near-earth orbit space debris will collide with itself so much and so often that there will be a permanent cloud of debris rather than the millions of discreet items that exist now.  
In other words, without doing a thing to add more debris to the equation, we've put so much up there the equivalent of a nuclear explosion will occur--actually is occurring--wherein pieces of debris collide with other pieces of debris, creating more pieces of debris, which in turn collide with each other, creating still <I>more</I> debris. <p>
After a few million years the total number of pieces will be astronomically more than there is right now, with most pieces being fragments of pieces that are now in orbit.  It's like a nuclear explosion but on a vastly different time scale.  <p>
When orbiting debris collides, it usually does so at such a speed that it is more than pulverized--it is liquefied and turned into not one or two, not even dozens, but millions of new pieces of space debris.  And all of them are hazardous. <p>
If it sounds like I'm painting a pretty gloomy picture, you're getting the point.  That man could have polluted near-earth orbit this badly this quickly is nothing less than criminal.  What many feel is our greatest achievement -- space exploration and walking on the moon, and sending exploratory space craft to the other planets, has left a legacy of pollution that will haunt future generations for tens of thousands of years.  
In fact, it's actually a far worse problem than the creation of plutonium here on earth.  Plutonium production has created thousands of tons of incredibly deadly poison, but at least that stuff has a half-life of 250,000 years.  That's a disgustingly long time, but space debris can remain in orbit -- and deadly -- for millions of years.  <p>
And this is such a shame.  After all, space exploration is the epitome of high technology and is one of the most exciting things we have ever had a chance to be involved in.  Indeed, it is the only thing that mankind can do to ensure the ultimate survival of the species.  That is to say, mankind is right now living on a single, small, fragile planet called earth.  We could be hit by a meteor tomorrow and all of humankind could be wiped out.  <p>
The only protection we have for that ultimate disaster, or any ultimate disaster for life on earth, is to send colonies of people to other planets and to the moon, and eventually to other places in the universe.  IN FACT, I SEE IT AS OUR DUTY TO EXPLORE SPACE!  It is our duty to the human race.  Our duty to evolution.  Our duty to our civilization's history of exploration and discovery!  Yet in this attempt we have failed miserably.  <p>
Now, lets get a little specific.  Who failed, and how badly?  Why did they fail?  And what, if anything, can be done about it now?  <p>
A review of the amounts of space debris placed by the USA, the USSR, and everyone else indicates that most of it is Russian.  They are the greatest or worst polluters of outer space near earth.  However, don't get too glib--we have done an enormous amount of this pollution ourselves, to the tune of millions of pieces and around 30% of the total.  We are virtually as guilty as they are.  
Perhaps worse: One of the features of the proposed STAR WARS DEFENSE included the purposeful creation of huge additional amounts of space debris.  
The idea was to try to blow up incoming ballistic missiles by exploding millions of pellets of BB-sized shrapnel thus creating, in one quick step, something like double the amount of debris that is already up there!  This is NOT an ecological solution to the problem of intercontinental warfare!  In fact, it's like cutting off your nose to spite your face--or maybe it's like aiming a shotgun at yourself to scratch an itch. <p>
By weight, or rather by mass, since in outer space things don't exactly have weight but they do have mass or kinetic energy, most of the space debris in orbit today is spent rocket stages and old satellites.   This is actually the easy stuff.  It's big enough to track with radar.  But by quantity, which is probably the more important value, most space debris is the result of less than 200 explosions, many intentional, some accidental.  Two hundred is not very many.  
That's how fragile outer space in near earth orbit is.  When a 5000 pound satellite is exploded in near earth orbit it can create tens of thousands or even millions of pieces of space debris which will orbit the earth for tens of thousands or even millions of years.  Already man-made space debris is by far the biggest hazard, compared to the natural meteoroid environment.  We're talking 1000 to 1 times more hazardous.<p>
I want to turn away from the depressing topic of describing the problem -- and turn to the depressing topic of monitoring the problem and surviving an impact.  <p>
Right now, we can only reliably track a tiny fraction of the objects that orbit the earth.  We track in the neighborhood of less than 10,000 pieces, and all of the ones we track are greater than about a foot in diameter.  But we cannot track even these objects all that well.  There are blind spots, there are equipment problems with the tracking devices, there are calculation errors such that we "lose" some of the objects now and then.  <p>
On several space shuttle missions, course corrections have had to be made to avoid a collision with a known item of space debris.  But remember, we only track objects bigger than about a foot across and an object the size of a small marble has the kinetic energy of a 400 pound safe dropped from 100 feet high!  The bottom line is that space exploration is far more risky than it could have been, because we have been so negligent.   <p>
You've probably heard the phrase "acceptable level of risk".  I wonder what that really means?  After all, is any level of risk acceptable when the danger was caused by negligence and sloppy work?  Due to cutbacks in the budget for NASA, cost-cutting measures have ensured that the problem of creating more space debris has received far less attention than it should.  NASA is very image-conscious right now, and afraid it will lose even more funding.  So it doesn't want to discuss the downsides.  <p>
NASA doesn't want to discuss the ballistic launch techniques that could reduce the creation of new space debris and still get stuff in orbit and beyond.  Magnetic rail launches built near hydroelectric power sources could be a cost-effective way to build not one little space station, but a vast array of living quarters.  This, however, would cost easily ten times what NASA is going to spend, and has spent, on the space-shuttle program--the so-called reusable space ship.  
In truth the space shuttle program is a boondoggle which is hardly a cost-effective way to get to and from space.  <p>
But NASA's tiny budget is only a part of the problem.  Add to this the U.S. military space program which has had countless rocket failures over the years and is accountable to virtually no one, and then add the Russian space program which is even worse and creates more pollution than our own, and you have an enormous problem.  Next, add the other nations that are beginning to launch rockets and even private rocketeers.  These people must answer to no one right now.  
I've heard of one plan to launch rockets for the sole purpose of "cosmic" burial, wherein your dearly departed's ashes would be left to clog the filters of future space explorers for ever more.  Also, some brain-dead advertisers want to place gigantic reflecting mirrors to spell out product names and logos from space!  Unfortunately, this is not a joke!  I'm serious!  There is no Intergalactic Environmental Protection Agency.  And even if there were it would probably be bogged down in paperwork!<p>
I've talked to a number of astronauts about this problem.  Astronauts are on the front lines of this battle because it's their hide that is on the line.  They are the ones that can get pulverized in an instant thanks to some floating wrench a previous visitor discarded rather than bring back to earth.  And they are concerned about it.  But, what's really needed is some good old fashioned public awareness.<p>
Last week there were at least two shows on national television about the legacy of space exploration in the U.S.  One was 20th Century with Mike Wallace, and the other was Investigative Reports will Bill Kurtis.  Both discussed the Challenger disaster and other problems, yet neither show even mentioned the problem of space debris!  Not one word!  That's why I'm talking about it to you today.  
Somebody has to start lighting a fire under these guys and saying "Hey!  We care!  Stop polluting near earth orbit like you've polluted everything else!"<p>
Now you may be wondering if there is a technological solution to this problem which makes it not so important.  I wish there was.  But the sad truth is that every plan anyone has come up with is absolutely unworkable.  In fact the plans are so fantastic and outrageous that they are more like perpetual motion machines and other absurdities.   Let's look at some of them, just for fun.  These won't work.  <p>
One plan involves floating a huge umbrella to catch the debris.   This would require first of all, getting this thing into orbit and the risk that entails for creating more debris in the first place.  Second, how big could you make it?  The debris is flinging around in every direction and it would be like trying to  clean the ocean of salt with a paper cup.<p>
Another plan to solve the problem of space debris involves using some kind of laser blaster to pulverize any debris that is going to collide with a space ship.  This is unworkable for a number of reasons.  First, you would have to lug a lot of additional hardware into space at enormous cost and risk.  Not just lasers and generators, but radar that can aim constantly in 360 degrees all around the ship, for space debris can come at you from any direction.  
As an example, even if you're traveling at 20,000 miles per hour, a piece can be coming up on you from behind at 22,000 miles per hour.  That's a two thousand mile per hour difference.  And even a small object can do quite a bit of damage to a space ship if it collides at 2,000 mile per hour!  Besides all that, blasting the debris creates more debris and a bigger problem later.<p>
The truth is, there is really only one thing that we can do at this point, and that is to endeavor not to create more space debris in the first place.  For example, spent rocket stages can be maneuvered to lower orbits where they will experience atmospheric drag and fall to earth and be incinerated on the way down.  <p>
But probably the best thing to do is to SKIP EARTH ORBIT ENTIRELY WHENEVER POSSIBLE.  For example many of the satellites now in orbit perform functions that can actually be just as easily done from earth-based transmission systems.  Telephone calls, television, and other communications links should be accomplished through earth-based fiber optic systems, not through the use of satellites.  
It's time to explore these options so we can preserve near earth space for what it's really good for--a door to the future, a door to the planets and the stars.  
Lets not get bogged down with a space station which just adds to the problem.  Let's go for the gold--we need to colonize the moon NOW.  It is technologically feasible.  It is right that we should try to do this.  Instead what happened was that after we set foot there, America seems to have sat back and said  "O.K., now that that's done, lets rest up a bit!"  which is ludicrous.  
We've lost the momentum and the drive to take this thing to its final and obvious conclusion--colonization of the other planets and the birth of human beings on other planets.  Only by doing this can we hope to ensure the eventual survival of the human race.  We need to also colonize the depths of the seas, and that is another shameful failure of our so-called glorious post-industrial age society.  We took one small step for man and fell flat on our faces.<p>
Let's put the exploration back into space exploration.  Forget the earth-orbiting space station.  Let's get past that stage and rocket to the moon and beyond.  America's greatest triumphs in space are yet to come!  Let's not trash the launching pad before we've barely even gotten started.<p>
I said I'd cite some sources if you'd like more information about the problem of space debris.  First of all, you can order  a booklet entitled REPORT ON ORBITAL DEBRIS by INTERAGENCY GROUP (SPACE) which was written for the National Security Council, Washington DC in February, 1989.  I highly recommend that you do get this book and become more familiar with this problem, and it contains a more complete bibliography as well.<p>
DISCOVER magazine published a rather useless article in January 1992 describing an idea some engineer at the Johnson Space Center had,   but at least they mentioned it. <p>
The NEW YORK TIMES has published a number of good articles about the problem, over the years.<p>
NASA needs to be told that we, American citizens, will not tolerate the careless ways of the past.  I recommend that you write your congresspeople and write to the president, and don't let him just send back a form letter about Space Station Freedom.  Tell him your concern is SPACE DEBRIS and what we're going to do about it.<p>
I'd like to thank you all for listening and please join us again next week.  This has been HIGH TECH TODAY with your host, Russell Hoffman.  Please be sure to join us each week right here on WALE in Providence, RI.<p>

<b>In October, 1997 NASA plans to launch a space probe called Cassini,
which will contain 72.3 pounds of deadly Plutonium 238.  This is more
plutonium than any country has ever tried to launch before.</b>
<p>
NASA virtually denies the existence of any health risk from exposure
to low-level plutonium.  Yet they base their opinions on studies that
are so far out of date as to be laughable (if it didn't lead to such
serious consequences)!
<p>
NASA bases much of their information on studies from Hiroshima and
Nagasaki.  Over 50 years ago!  The existence of a hazard from
low-level radiation wasn't even suspected then!  But now, we have new
data.  Three Mile Island, Chernobyl and numerous other more
recent and much better-studied events than the confused aftermath of 
World War II have occurred.  These unfortunate "experiments" have 
proven <b>unequivocally</b> the deadly hazard of 
low levels of radiation poisoning -- even, as the expression goes,
<i>vanishingly</i> small levels of radiation.  Clear statistical
studies have proven time and again that there is <i>no known minimum
lethal dose</i> from plutonium.  Studies in Kiev and in Greece after
Chernobyl.  Studies of children living near reprocessing plants in 
France.  Studies in Scandinavia.  And in the United States after Three
Mile Island.  Extremely low levels of radiation are still hazardous and
when large populations are exposed, large numbers of cancers result. 
<p>
I'm not saying there is no minimum lethal dose.  There may be a
minimum lethal dose.  What I am saying, is we have not found it.  Try
as we might (and the nuclear industry has tried pretty hard!) we have
not been able to establish any minimum lethal dose!  Plutonium
appears to be potentially deadly in <b>any</b> quantity!  This is important,
because it means that when you spread plutonium around, even in very 
minute quantities throughout the world, health effects <i>will</i> occur.
<h3>Who Says?</h3>
NASA says.  NASA claims that if a catastrophic accident occurred and the
Cassini probe incinerated in the atmosphere it could cause
2,300 deaths over a 50 year period.  Their exact wording, 
however, is telling.  They appear somehow comforted by the fact 
that these deaths would be hard to find.  They say the deaths 
will be: "...statistically indistinguishable from the normally
occurring cancer fatalities among the world's population".  
But all this means is that you would not be able to 
calculate <i>which</i> cancer deaths occurred because of their little 
science experiment!  No-fault insurance because you can't prove it was them.
But that doesn't mean it didn't happen.  Not by a long shot.
<h3>And besides that...</h3>
After Chernobyl, many people insisted, especially in the nuclear
power industry, that only a few hundred deaths occurred.  Then, a few
thousand.  Then ten thousand, tops.  Now, few dispute that it is probably 
<i>already</i> above <b>50,000</b> people and is likely to climb 
to over <b>100,000</b> before... before what?  In the next 1000
centuries Chernobyl will have lost barely 25% of its radioactivity.  
The 100,000 deaths are calculated among those who 
received a significant exposure from the
initial explosion and fiery release, and from subsequent wind and weather
patterns that blew the radioactivity their way.  Not one person in 
California who might have breathed in some
radioactive dust and gotten lung cancer is ever counted.  They are
just too hard to find.  But they are there, and when you 
add up all the places as populated as California all around the world, 
even 100,000 total deaths may be a low estimate.  
<p>
In the case of
Chernobyl, subsequent accidents from the still-smoldering site will
undoubtedly kill millions more for thousands of years.  The "dead
zone" around Chernobyl is growing larger, and many feel that within a
few centuries as much as several hundred miles around will have to 
be evacuated for thousands of generations.  Many feel it should be 
evacuated <i>now</i>.  And no one has even tried to clean it
up.  It's still way too hot to go near, they say.  So they leave it
for a rainy day, but it won't go away.
<p>
How does 72.3 pounds compare with what was lost in Chernobyl and every
other accident?  It's an absurd question!  It's cumulative.  If you
jump out of an airplane, just because you have 
fallen 30,000 feet is no reason not to pull the rip cord for the
last 500 feet of descent!  Those of us still alive -- and sure that's
most of us but it sure isn't all of us! -- have every
reason to not want to be subjected to yet another nuclear lottery in
which the only winners are a few overpaid and undereducated,
narrow-focused scientists, and the losers are everyone on the planet.
If the Cassini probe survives reentry it could devastate an area as big 
as any city, making it uninhabitable <i>instantly</i> for thousands of 
years. And a sickening, evil death it would be, too!  72 pounds of black 
rain would decimate the land for miles and miles in every direction.  And
yet, that's probably safer for the world as a whole (everyone except
those near where it falls) than if Cassini burns up in the upper
atmosphere!
<h3>Learn this NOW!</h3>
It is <b>vital</b> that these facts be understood by <b>everyone</b>
in modern society.  Modern civilization manipulates poisons and chemicals 
that cause problems all the time.  Substances causing everything from 
diarrhea to death in minutes are regularly transported, used, and stored 
throughout the world.  And breathed and ingested, I might add.  But
plutonium is worse, far worse.
<h2>Is plutonium so different?</h2>
It is.  For one thing, plutonium does not exist in nature.  Every
ounce of plutonium in existence is man-made.  For another, your body
thinks plutonium is iron.  It accepts it and tries to use it as though
it were iron--an essential mineral.  What a <b>deadly</b> deception!
<p>
One of the things plutonium does is cause random mutations 
of DNA.  DNA is the stuff that we are all made of.  If there is any 
<i>thing</i> on the planet that mankind can say contains the makings
of his soul, DNA is that thing.  It is DNA which holds the genetic 
codes for ourselves and all our future generations.  It is what makes 
a dozen generations of monarch butterflys migrate as a species to 
exact spots thousands of miles away.  It is what we joyously join 
together in the union of sperm and egg.  Watson and Crick were
awarded a Nobel Prize for discovering the format
of it -- a double helix.  If we are protective of anything, we should
surely be protective of our DNA.  Our species is defined by it.  
Our children look like us because of it.  We are not apes or 
beasts because of it.
<br>
<h2>So we shouldn't act like beasts and spite it.</h2>
If we love our children and each other, our sisters and our brothers,
our species and our civilization, or have any hope for humanity at all, we must 
be protective of our DNA.  Lead aprons during dental visits is only
the very tip of the iceburg.  Things that are hazardous to our DNA
should be avoided not just "like the plague", but like the even-more
horrendous, cancerous, make-you-puke-from-chemotherapy disasters that
they are.  Plutonium is not something we as a species can live with!
<p>
Our DNA separates us from the beasts, but just barely.  Only 1% of
human DNA is unique, if even that much!  The other 99% appears to 
be in common with the beasts!  And even if, as some have speculated,
much of the 99% we have in common is useless (we don't
really know) nevertheless we can be sure that it is <i>at most</i> that 1% 
which makes us different -- and probably the part we <i>really</i> care 
about is even less than that!  But it's enough!
<h3>Viva la 1%!!!!</h3>
The other thing that separates us from the beasts, at least in
theory, is simply that we don't act like beasts.
<h3>We don't act like beasts.  Or do we?</h3>
Plutonium is the deadliest substance known to mankind.  This is a
universally accepted truth.  Yet NASA would send up 72.3 pounds of this
stuff -- enough to kill everyone on earth many times over, if properly
distributed -- on the grounds that they can:
<DL>
<DT><b>A)</b> Prevent a disaster at launch.
<DT><b>B)</b> Prevent a disaster prior to leaving earth's
gravitational pull.
<dt><b>C)</b> Prevent a disaster by carefully aiming the Cassini space
probe 312 miles above earth during a 1999 flyby.
</DL>
That's a tall order:
<DL>
<DT><b>A) Prevent a disaster at launch.</b>
<DD>They intend to do this with a rocket type (the Titan) which has
experienced numerous failures over its years of operation.  They
can't even claim a good track record. In 1993 a billion-dollar 
military spy satellite atop this very type of launch
vehicle blew up. In fact NASA failures are so common, the lastest 
<i>spectacular</i> explosion of an Atlas Launch Vehicle on January 
17th, 1997 did not even make the front page of <i>many</i> newpapers!  
And Atlas Launch Vehicles are considered one of 
our <i>most</i> reliable!  
<p>
<DT><b>B) Prevent a disaster prior to leaving earth's
gravitational pull.</b>
<DD>Any failure which occurs prior to leaving earth's gravitational pull 
can result in the probe falling back to earth and burning 
up, despite the fact that there is a supposed shield (made of
iridium).  This shield is barely the thickness of a fingernail and
cannot survive impact with any of millions of pieces of space debris
already in Near Earth Orbit.  If the probe falls in such a way that
the trajectory is particularly shallow there will be plenty of time to
burn right through the shield and then incinerate the plutonium.  
<p>Many chemicals are transformed into other compounds and become
harmless when burned.  This is not true of plutonium.  Actually, rather 
than rendering it harmless, burning plutonium is the <i>"best"</i>
way to spread the deadly poison throughout the population!
<p>
<dt><b>C) Prevent a disaster by carefully aiming the Cassini space
probe 312 miles above earth during a 1999 flyby.</b>
<DD>
Yes, it <i>can</i> be done.  Physically, it's a great way to get some
extra momentum to make it to Saturn without having to use too big a
rocket.  After wrapping around Venus a couple of times and gaining 
momentum, the probe can -- and will, if NASA succeeds at this -- be
swung around earth for a 'flyby' and
additional speed gain.  But to do this, we must accurately aim it
from millions of miles out in space at a point just 312 miles above 
the surface of the earth.  That's just 245 miles above the point 
where atmospheric drag would slow the probe so it would be captured 
by earth's gravitational pull and either crash or burn up in the 
atmosphere.  It <i>can</i> be done, but can it be
done <i>every time, this time, next time?</i> 245 miles is less than
3 percent of the diameter of the earth.  NASA loses control of
satellites <i>all the time</i>!  Our last probe to the outer solar
system -- Galileo -- simply refused to unfurl it's antenna and became
crippled!  Also underreported -- too common to make the headlines -- was the 
mysterious and still-unsolved loss of an AT&T satellite in January, 
1997.  These things happen <b>all the time</b>.  90% of the satellites 
in orbit right now are non-functional and many of them became that 
way for no known reason.
</dl>
<h3>Accidents DO happen...</h3>
This is not so trivial an issue -- the fact is that Cassini puts  
humanity at risk not once but on at least <b>seven</b> separate occasions: 
First in the production of the plutonium 238.  Then in the building 
of the plutonium power generator or "RTG". These have both already 
occurred and indeed numerous workers <b>were</b> contaminated.  
Then when the RTG is transported and stored at NASA. 
Then while it is sitting atop millions of pounds of rocket fuel 
prior to launch (and many launches are repeatedly scrubbed in 
the last few moments).  Then, if the launch button is finally pushed,
one of the most hazardous moments occurs -- firing the initial stage. 
Then on through acceleration out of earth's orbit.  Finally, 
humanity is put at risk once more, and in the worst way, during 
the 1999 flyby.
<p>
And after all of this, after putting humanity through all this risk,
Cassini itself will suddenly be at its own <b>greatest
peril</b>, at least in terms of the success of the mission.  
<h3>Another possible glitch?</h3>
As Cassini flys out beyond where it can do us any harm,
it will pass through a barrier no man has crossed before.  It is a 
barrier which is dreaded by millions of computer programmers.  
A barrier so tough the U. S. Government has spent millions of dollars 
studying it, and so has every major corporation and most smaller ones.  
A barrier the Federal Government <i>alone</i> expects to spend from 
<b>10</b> to <b>30</b> <i>billion</i> dollars to overcome.  It is 
a barrier technicians around the world are studying, fearing, and working 
on.  It is a barrier not of space, but of time.  A barrier of the fourth
dimension.
<p>
On its way out to Saturn, Cassini will pass through the year 2000.
<p>
<h3>Even NASA is smart enough to dread this.</h3>
<p>
But so far, they are not smart enough to fix it.  
<p>
A July 1996 U.S. Federal Government Year 2000 Report by Chairman of the 
Subcommittee on Government Management Stephen Horn says: "NASA, one of 
the most innovative, advanced and computer-dependent agencies in the
Federal government, has not prepared a plan to solve the problem and
does not anticipate having a plan completed until March 1997."
<p>
Just seven months after completing the plan -- not the 
work, mind you, but the plan -- they will send Cassini off into outer space.
<p>
So you see, we run a considerable risk of not getting anything
scientifically valuable out of this experiment one way or the other! 
<p>
<h3>NASA does NOT have a tradition of preventing disasters.</h3>
NASA and other space agencies have a dismal record and a host of
spectacular failures.  NASA has been downsized, reorganized, 
scrutinized and large sections have been privatized.  It sees itself
in a fight for its very survival.  The Russian space agency is
in even worse shape, and is willing to sell us defective nuclear junk
at bargain prices -- junk they themselves cannot afford to launch 
into space -- and we're stupid enough to buy it!  The plutonium 238 on
Cassini is <i>not</i> the product of <i>our</i> brilliant cold war
strategy -- it's the product of the losing side!  It's the hardware
that <i>lost</i> the war, for gosh sakes!  We buy this junk from the
Russians!
<h3>Every living thing would be affected.</h3>
If Cassini has any of the worst-case accidents that are possible, it
won't just be mankind's DNA that will be affected.  Every living
thing, from the Giant Redwoods to the lowly but vital plankton of the
sea will be exposed.  It's really wrong to only consider the
thousands or millions of deaths that this can cause to humans.  Other
living things will suffer as well.  This would be a disaster that is
practically unprecedented in history!  At least for Hiroshima and
Nagasaki, we had two good excuses!  First, there was the little
matter of the war going on.  And second, we were not nearly as aware
of all the dangers of ionizing radiation!  We are not so stupid now. 
We know that 72.3 pounds of plutonium 238 -- a particularly virulent
form of plutonium, by the way -- is enough to sicken and kill millions of
people if distributed properly.  And high above-ground burning is
a <i>particularly</i> effective method of distribution. 
<h3>We have no excuses.</h3>
When we look back at events in history, it is easy to forgive some
person or people for horrible things that happened during their times
or for the follies of their ways.  The Romans built great aqueducts
but had deadly lead water pipes.  In Victorian England it was thought 
that virgins were the cure to syphilis. Even our own Thomas Jefferson 
owned slaves in his time, yet he is rightfully 
honored for setting in motion and setting down on paper the principals 
of freedom which still guide us today.
<p>
But right now, today and as you read this, right now we <b>know</b> that 
what NASA plans to do is sheer, utter lunacy.  They are playing a deadly 
game of chance with our DNA.  There is no way they can control all
the dangers -- you cannot engineer in safety against hazards such as
existing space debris, frozen o-rings, and human error.  Yet you
<b>can</b> solve the problem!  You <b>can</b> do the experiment
safely!  You simply do not use plutonium!  It's that easy!  The European Space
Agency, which didn't have access to the nuclear option, has developed
a solar battery pack that even NASA -- EVEN NASA! -- admits
could serve the needs of the probe!  
<h3>Now what's our excuse?</h3>
Can we really expect scientists who will not even use the safe alternative 
to make all the other difficult decisions correctly as well?  No, and
that's why <b>we the people</b> have to learn what is happening and 
take control through the courts, through public persuasion, through 
all legal means known.  All it takes to stop NASA is the united will 
of the people.  NASA <b>cannot launch</b> if America (and the rest of 
the world) wakes up and realizes what is happening.  
<h3>You cannot call this crud High Tech...</h3>
This is old technology.  It is proven technology--proven deadly. It is
not "high tech" at all and there is no reason to be proud of anything
that puts humanity at such risk for so little gain.
<p>
The liability from a Cassini catastrophy would be in the billions and 
billions of dollars, although we have passed laws (which are probably 
not valid outside the U.S.A.) artificially limiting Government liability 
to slightly under $1 billion.  But do you know who pays when your own
government refuses to pay?  You do!  You pay with medical bills, you
pay with lung cancers and genetic disorders.  You pay, but the
government won't pay <i>you</i>.  You're on your own on this, so you
might as well protest it now, before it can do you such great harm!

<IMG ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=4 WIDTH=110 HEIGHT=112 SRC="sitclose.jpg" ALT="Sitting on a Redwood">
After visiting the Redwoods in Spring, 1995, I didn't want to write this
article.  I wanted to believe that the trees are finally being
protected and that mankind has stopped destroying these mighty and
majestic matriarchs of the plant kingdom.   I wanted to believe that 
slowly but surely,
they are actually making a comeback and the species will survive. 
But the survival of the California Redwoods is still in doubt and the
environmentalists need your support.
<p>
Most of the people I met when I visited Northern California 
seemed to appreciate the problem.  I'm talking about
the people at the lumber company, and the presentations they made,
and all the people at the nature-conservancy headquarters, and so forth.
<p>
<IMG ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=4 WIDTH=80 HEIGHT=363 SRC="onerdbw1.jpg" ALT="">
The environmentalists oppose <i>all</i>
cutting of the California Redwoods--what's left of them.  96% of all
California Redwoods have been destroyed by man in the last few
hundred years.  These trees can live to be over 2000 years old, and
we have taken <b>96%</b> of them in little more than 100 years!  
Mathematically, that is a rape of the land if ever there was one!  
<p>
The California Redwoods along with their close cousins the Giant
Sequoias are probably the most beautiful and majestic creatures 
you will ever see.  
<p>
That is why the environmentalists want to see this destruction come 
to a complete stop.  When talking specifically about trees in our 
National Forests, it's called Zero Cut.
<p>
If you have never been to the Redwoods, you should go, then you'll
understand.  These trees can stand more than 370 feet tall and over 25 feet 
in diameter.  They have survived fires, droughts, plagues, earthquakes 
and everything else nature has thrown at them.  But they have not
been able to withstand one thing--the ravages of man.  
<p>
If you go to the Redwoods, you will see that there are still a lot of
the big trees.   You can drive along a 30-mile corridor of
Redwoods called the Avenue of the Giants, and you can think there are
a lot of these trees left.  This corridor was established in the
early 1900's as a preserve of the giant trees.  They weren't able to save
many outside this corridor.  In essence, it's as phony as a Hollywood set.
<p>
If you stop your car and walk barely 100 yards off this famous corridor, 
you won't see any more big
Redwoods.  They've all been chopped down and turned into
patios and decks and gamerooms.  Gift Shop nic-nacs and picture
frames and plaques.  They chopped these trees down for <i>you</i>.
<p>
While you're there, be sure to visit the Pacific Lumber Company, who
offer a guided tour of their lumbermill.  It is about 20 miles
north of the Avenue of the Giants.  
<p>
Just at the north end of the Avenue of the Giants the mill also maintains 
a small park where you can learn more about the flora and fauna of
the Redwood Forests.  If you're healthy (or want to be) be sure 
to climb the outer loop trail.  It's breathtaking!  
<p>
The mill itself is a loud and scary place.  You wear goggles and earplugs
and see enormous machines debark, slice, and dice the very same
enormous trees that you just passed.  It is a terrific and 
terrifying tour of the types of tools used in this destruction.  
<p>
The mill is run by basically honest people.  These
people believe that they are now maintaining an equilibrium with
the giant trees.  They believe that they are doing no harm to nature.  
Unfortunately, they are wrong.  When you watch a 500 year old tree 
being ripped to shreads by a company that has existed barely 80 years and 
claims they are sustaining the environment, you wonder if something is 
seriously out of kilter.  It is.  Where did a tree this big come from that 
it would be allowed to be cut?  Sometimes the answer is:  Private land.  
<p>
<h3>A little here, a little there...</h3>
<p>
Small plots can be "harvested" by their owners, who 
contract the lumber company to do the dirty work and hand them a
check for about $10,000.  The lumber company might make $100,000 or
more from the wood.  The distributors and everyone else--you're
talking at least half a million dollars for that tree, by the time you and
everyone else gets their deck and plaque and nic-nac.  
<p>
But the guy
that made the decision to sell it--he only got $10,000.  For this he
would cut down his children and his grandchildren's tree.  "We don't
have any kids, so we don't need to leave the trees" one
bed-and-breakfast owner actually said to me.  He continued: "Now that
the highway cuts through here, we couldn't sustain the inn if we had to
rely on the income from the guests.  We've cut down 5 trees.  They
were in the way of where we wanted to put the cabins anyway. Now the
place gets more light..."  Yadda Yadda Yadda.    
<p>
<h3>Fight for survival</h3>
<p>
Through the effects of worldwide air and water pollution, there is clear
evidence that the trees that are lucky enough not to be cut down are 
nevertheless not growing as well.  When you slice open a Redwood 
tree, you often find that in the last decades of the tree's
life, the rings of the tree grew thinner and less healthy. 
(Like all trees, Redwoods add one ring per year.)  
Either they weren't getting the proper sun
through a polluted haze, or they were fighting off pollutants that
had gotten inside them from the water and the air, or they were ravaged 
by pests because, where they once were in the center of a forest of 
Redwoods, they now stood on the edge.  Thus they were susceptible to things 
that only Redwoods living on the edge of the Redwood forest get
bothered by.  They defend the rest of the forest.  Sacrificial
Redwoods, as it were.
<p>
Redwood forests protect themselves.  Dead Redwoods provide
groundsoil that is rich in nutrients and low in pests.  Because so
many have been cut down,  there is a much higher percentage of 
Redwoods that are next to fields than there used to be, or that are
growing without the proper dead-Redwood groundcover.
<p>
Some trees you cut down will show fatter rings in the final
decades of their lives, but these trees were actually less healthy 
trees as well!  Fatter or thinner, both changes are bad.   
<p>
The reason fatter rings are bad is 
because when you cut away the trees around another tree, the
remaining tree grows faster (producing the fatter rings) but this 
is actually an unnatural thing that weekens the tree overall.  The
density of the wood is a major factor in the ability of the Redwood
to protect itself against both fire and insects, not to mention
earthquakes, for thousands of years.  
<p>
When the forest is thinned, the remaining trees grow unnaturally fast
and both the forest and the wood in the forest is less dense.  Thus 
the remaining trees are not as well protected.  
They are more vulnerable to fire, pests, wind--nearly 
everything is worse for them except this:  Man doesn't want the 
fast-growing trees as much!
<p>  
The wood is not considered as valuable as old-growth wood, presumably
for all those benefits just mentioned, many of which remain in the
cut wood after the tree has been chopped. 
<p> 
And of course, when you thin the forest the species suffers the loss of 
the removed members.  Large populations are vital for biodiversity within 
the species.
<p>
<IMG ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=4 WIDTH=80 HEIGHT=363 SRC="onerdbw2.jpg" ALT="">
Thanks to mankind, even the trees that are not being cut are 
whithering and dieing.  This is <b>all the more reason</b> to protect not
just some that remain, but <i>all</i> that remain.  
Only sufficient biodiversity will guarantee the continued 
life of these trees.  And it is possible that only the 
oldest and mightiest will be able to survive the onslaught of 
pollution and encroachment we have brought. It is quite 
possible that not one tree artificially or naturally planted in the last
100 years will survive the <i>next</i> 500 years, when the real test
comes.  We are still <i>increasing</i> pollution worldwide despite 
increased awareness on the part of the public.  
<p>
Can trees which should live for 2000 years survive 500 years of heavy 
pollution?  And that's assuming we clean the environment in the next
couple of centuries, a dubious assumption at best.  If the 
'young ones' die, perhaps some of the older trees, that right now are
about 500 years old, will have the strength to survive
until we collectively clean up this filthy place we call Earth.  
(Only a very few are much older than 500 years, because the biggest and best 
have nearly all been chopped down.  500 years is a young Redwood in
their natural habitat.) 
<p>
Redwoods need other Redwoods to survive.  They are a community. 
Together they block the light from other types of trees, and when they do
fall, they provide sanctuary for favorable plant and animal species
for hundreds of years as the trunks decay.  Their insect-resistant
wood makes the perfect forest bed for new Redwoods.  Fallen Redwoods are as
vital to the health of the forest as are the ones that stand.  The
fallen ones maintain pest control on the forest floor where the
giant trees are most vulnerable.  
<p>
The lumber companies have long proposed that there is no harm in
removing only a portion of the trees but it is not true.  What happens is
you destroy the ecosystem by taking out wood that needs to be there,
dead or alive.  <i>96%</i> is gone already.  What remains from here on 
in is up to you.  
<p>
<h3>See for yourself...</h3>
<p>
Go and visit the Redwoods.  Drive down Avenue of the Giants and
marvel at all those big trees.  But recognize that they are being
destroyed as you pass them, and the fight to save them can only stop
when not one tree is being cut down and harvested.  Even the very act
of your passing them in your car may be harmful to their health, but 
if you won't go look at them, you probably won't help save them.  
<p>
Recently it was reported that there are some 135 billionaires in
America; over 40 in California alone.  Maybe one of them will help.
It's not just a bunch of environmental "kooks" out there trying to save
these things, though you can be sure they're out there too, and right
in the front committing civil disobedience and getting arrested.  
But so are a lot of other people.  
Join singers like Bonnie Raitt and Don Henley 
and a host of other famous people who have investigated the situation.  
Both the <a href="#nfc_link">Native Forest Council</a> and the Sierra Club now support a version
of the Zero Cut concept. Help stop the harvest before 97% are gone, 
then 98%, then 99%, and then what? 
<p>
<h3>Who pays?</h3>
<p>
I believe something should be done for all the workers who will be
displaced, and it will cost the public a lot of money.  But the lumber 
companies--all of them--and the workers as well, should have seen 
the day coming when we would finally decide to stop them.  They
should not have tried to sustain their own existence--they should
have closed mills and reduced lumbering gradually over the past few
decades so that most people would have been able to retire out of the
industry.  But they didn't, and now we must finally tell them they
must completely stop cutting down our beautiful California Redwood trees. 
We want to keep the 4% that are left.  
<p>
If the lumber mills had instituted an industry-wide no-hire policy three 
decades ago and not replaced workers lost through retirement or other causes, 
there would be hardly anyone left in the business now and shutting
them down would be easy and cheap.  They chose not to do this, of course, 
despite all the handwriting on the wall.  They stayed as 
big as they could.  Now we must force the public will upon them, at 
great cost to both the lumber companies, the workers, and the public.  
It's too bad, but it <i>must</i> be done.  
<p>
If there were no other reason to do this, they are a precious and
valuable tourist attraction for the State of California.  One you
should visit as soon as you can--while they're still around.
<p>
<b>Redwoods News:</b>  On December 5th, 1996 the federal government 
and state of California offered properties worth $380 million in 
return for the largest old-growth grove of Northern California Redwoods 
still in private hands, 7,500 acres of Headwaters Forest.  The deal 
involved properties in Humboldt County, Kern County and the Southern 
California community of Laguna Niguel. However, as of early 
February, 1997 it looks like Charles Hurwitz, owner of Pacific
Lumber Co. has rejected every site <i>and</i> declared his intention 
to clearcut the grove of ancient forests for his corporate gain.

<h3>The world should be interconnected by an electrical energy grid so that renewable energy sources in distant locations can supply the energy needs of population centers all over the world.</h3>
<hr>
GLOBAL ENERGY NETWORK INTERNATIONAL (GENI) is a tax-exempt, IRS Sec
501(c)(3), organization in the United States of America.  They
conduct research and educational activities related to the
international and inter-regional transmission of electricity, with a
specific emphasis on the interconnection of renewable energy
resources.
<p>
This proposal combines large-scale international projects, renewable
resources, international cooperation across borders, and individual
efforts to solve the #1 problem in the world today--the need for
plentiful clean energy at a reasonable cost.
<p>
Invented by R. Buckminster Fuller in the 1930's, this idea had to
languish until long range transmission capabilities improved.  Now
that the problem have definitely been solved it's time for the world
to join together in this global cooperative effort.

<p>
The Animated Software Company created an interactive introduction to GENI. 
It is chock-full of delightful animations, both hand drawn and
computer-assisted, and all of them are <i>educational</i>! 
The GENI tutorial is <i>free</i>, and it runs on any PC or compatible in DOS (usually can be run from within Windows).  There is a VGA version and a high-resolution SVGA version.  The SVGA version contains a <a>spectacular and fun</a> interactive "Dymaxion" puzzle of the world--great for kids and adults!
<p>
The downloadable version can also be found on <a href="http://www.compuserve.com/cgi-bin/gocserve?CIS:ANIMVEN">CompuServe</a> (CompuServe keyword: anisoft).
<p>
The diskette may be obtained from the GENI offices in San Diego CA or from The Animated Software Company. 
<p>
The WEB version does not contain animation at this time and can even be viewed without graphics at all.  But for a real treat, we suggest you download the highly interactive and animated version.

<h1> EXAMPLES IN THE ART OF COMPLAINING</h1>
<hr>
<p>
At some time in our lives, we all would like to complain about
something.  Russell D. Hoffman has had hundreds of <i>To the Editor</i>
letters published, and he has effectively lobbied <i>The State</i> for a
number of minor and major causes.  Also, he has written numerous
letters to companies he felt have given poor service or sold shoddy
stuff.  Selected highlights from this "career" are included here.
<p>
<i> EXAMPLES IN THE ART OF COMPLAINING</i> contains just that:
letters of complaint.  You can use these letters as the basis of your
own grievence letters to get better service, to right a wrong, or
just to get the satisfaction of knowing you had said your piece.
<p>
Currently, the book is <b>self-published</b> and contains several dozen <b>real-life examples</b> of the best material.  Often hilarious, it is an <b>informative guide</b> to the art of complaining.
<HR>
If you're the kind of person who would like to get <b>actual examples</b> of Examples in the Art of Complaining, you can read the following, taken right from the book:

<h5>By Russell D. Hoffman.  Copyright (c) 1996 by Russell D. Hoffman.</h5>
These stories are all true.  The identities are generally hidden 
to protect people's privacy.  
<p>
If you are entering the job market for the first time, these stories
are for you.  If you want to get some idea of what it's really like out 
there, these stories should give you a humorous but factual and in-depth 
look at some of the problems you might face.  Lots of books can tell
you how to dress, how to try to make a favorable impression, and so
on.  These stories tell you what it's actually like "in the trenches".
  Some jobs are 'menial' and you probably wouldn't ever
want to do them.  Most pay pretty poorly.  Some are dangerous.  Most
are boring.  But sooner or later, nearly everyone goes through a time
in thier life when they will take any job.  Most of us actually start out 
that way.  These stories talk about what those jobs are like, so you can figure out 
what you really want to be if you do get to grow up and get a real job.

"A very erudite speaker"..."Russell breezed through the philosophy of randomness as a function of art"..."A totally amazing evening"..."most informative"..."should be a stand-up comedian"..."best lecture at the meeting"...
<p>
Mr. Hoffman is an <b>evangelist for technology</b>.  Whether it's a new
mechanical pump or a recent revolution in computer technology (the Web) Mr.
Hoffman tries to know about it and fit it together into a whole world view. 
As new markets and new tools emerge, how will the world cope with
them?  How can the new tools help us to communicate with one another,
help us to improve our standard of living, and help us clean up our soiled
environment?  What will the world of tomorrow use that we can design
today?  Why does the clock on the VCR still blink out 12:00?
<p>
Mr. Hoffman's lectures look forward to what technology will be like in the 
future and how we can each affect the direction technological achievments lead
us.  What jobs will become available?  What is the value of a person
in a world of technology?  How can we design technology so
that the world becomes smaller and more human rather than mechanistic
and distant?  How can we get good customer service while talking to a
machine?  
<p>
Mr. Hoffman is based in Southern California but is available to lecture throughout the United States
and the world.
He has made presentations in Alabama, California, Connecticut, Florida, Massachusettes, New York and Washington D.C. 
For a small incentive (+expenses) he would go <i>just about anywhere</i> to make a presentation! 
(There are no expenses and no charges for presentations to non-profit computer clubs.) 
Russell hopes to do a <b>European lecture tour</b> in 1997.  Please <a href="/mailprom.htm">email us</a> if you are
interested in having him make a presentation to your group!
The world has really barely begun to computerize itself as we approach the Third Millenium and all our two-digit-year date routines fail.
<p>
There are a number of topics for the lectures:
<p>
<b>The Internet and How It Will Affect Your Life</b><br>
Explosive growth and virtually free distribution of information.  
This will change the world.  What might we see?
<p>
<b>Trends in the Computer Industry</b><br>
How does the industry manage to appear stagnant and dynamic at the same time?
<p>
<b>All About Educational Software</b><br>
Techniques to use if you write it, things to look for if you buy it. 
What are the four most popular products and why do you want to look
beyond them for the "good" stuff?  (Dinosaurs,
encyclopedias, automotive tutorials and human body tutorials.) 
Animation Techniques, What Makes a Program Interactive, Marketing Techniques, etc.
<p>
<b>History of a Computer Company</b><br>
Want to start your own computer company?  Started in 1984, The Animated Software Company has been on the bleeding edge the whole time.  Find out what hurts, what works, what's next.
<hr>
It usually works out to about a 45 minute lecture with 15 minutes to half an hour of questions afterwards. (Then usually a bunch more questions off to the side for quite a while!)

In the late 1800's Eadweard Muybridge photographed hundreds of animals as well as men, women and children performing a wide variety of tasks.  These images have been the basis of all animation ever since.
<p>
A hundred years later, we have taken five of these sequences and placed them on the back of our tee shirts.  Each sequence contains at least one entire loop of frames.  Fascinating to look at and beautiful too!
<p>
This tee will last for ages, and will fascinate you and your family and the people in back of you in line!  Makes a great gift!
<p>
Our tee shirts feature our beautiful galloping horse logo with a series of "animated" horse images on the back.

<h3>Prices and Ordering Information</h3>

Features a beautiful set of "animated" horses taken from one of our educational tutorials.  
<p>
We have taken one of our most popular sets of drawings and placed them on these mugs.  
<p>
Each mug has five sets of horse images on them, over 100 images in all! 
Based on Eadweard Muybridge's famous photographs from the late
1800's, these images have been carefully hand-traced into the
computer and output to a laser printer for transfer to these mugs.

<h3>Real correspondence about these mugs...</h3>

I'm curious about your animated horse mugs. Do the mugs somehow give the
horses the appearance that they are moving (I know that's probably a
dumb question, but I'd really like to know).

Mike<br>
<p>
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> My response... <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
<p>
Hi!
<p>
Thanks for your inquiry!  No, they don't.  Well, yes, they do.  Sort of.  
No, not really.  I mean, if you put the mug on a "lazy susan" and put a 
strobe light in front of it, and spun it at the right speed, they would 
sort of animate, except there's a big gap where the handle is.  Each frame 
is printed on the mug so it would work sort of like an inside-out Zoetrope.
<p>
That's a lot of trouble to go through, of course--especially when you consider that you can download an animated version from our web site (for free) and see them gallop, trot, pace, canter and jump right on your computer screen (without running the risk of spilling your coffee!)
<p>
Thanks again!  I think I'll post this correspondence (without your name and email address of course, to protect your privacy.)  I've found that when one person asks a question, it usually means thousands are curious and silent!
<p>
Sincerely,<br>
Russell Hoffman

the #1 cause of accidents!  Watch almost any mountain bike accident video
and what to you see?  Lots of sharply turned handlebars <i>preceding the real

<p>
The #2 cause is probably <i>failure to slow down when necessary</i>. 
The trick to going fast is knowing when to go slow.  (Not that I ever
go very fast compared to pros, but it's still a nice mantra.)

<title> A Mountain Bike Park Near You!</title>
</header>
<META Name="description" Content="Proposal for a 12-month Mountain Bike Park near a major city:  How it would work by Russell D. Hoffman; The Animated Software Company">

<hr>
<h1> A Mountain Biker's Vision for a twelve-month mountain bike park </h1>
<hr>
<IMG ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=5 WIDTH=95 HEIGHT=149 SRC="/pics/mtnbikes/flaminb1.jpg" ALT="Our MTB Park logo">
<p>
My wife and I spent each day of this past Memorial Day Weekend, 1996, mountain biking. 
We were lying in bed, going to sleep, and started talking about how
much fun the weekend had been.  We had covered 25 miles, all
off-road, during the past three days.  I had tested my new V-Brakes on the
toughest downhill around (Mt Israel) and they had performed flawlessly, except
for a mild squeal near the bottom of the descent.
<p>
Anyway, we were daydreaming about quitting our jobs and becoming mountain
bike instructors.  After all, we both have teaching experience (in
computers) and several years of mountain biking experience.  We calculated what we
could earn and decided it would probably work, at least in a dream.  Then she
dropped the bomb:  "But Russell, we could only work six months out of
the year.  The rest of the time, it would be a ski resort."
<p>
<i>"It doesn't have to be that way!"</i>  I suddenly exclaimed.  
In an instant, somehow I realized that a
twelve-month mountain biking park would have numerous advantages. 
<ul><b>Some advantages:</b>
<li>
Most importantly, it would be designed strictly for mountain biking, so
the courses would all be singletrack, tuned exactly to being fun for
mountain bikers.  Trails would be designed by superstar mountain
bikers.  They could include jumps, whoop-de-doos, parabolic curves in any
direction, and so on.  We would not be copying ski slopes--we would
more be copying rollercoasters, with careful attention to playing
with the bike's own momentum.  This place would be <i>a blast!</i>
<li>
Because we could start at valley level, you would only have to drive
to the bottom of a 4,000 or 5,000 foot mountain, instead of to the 7000th foot
of a 12,000 foot mountain like you do with ski resorts.  So, you can
choose smaller mountains closer to population centers.  This would
mean people could get there in a half hour instead of four hours.
<li>
The park would not have to invest in two sets of rental equipment, two
sets of tooling, two sets of talents.
<li>
No crossover seasons.
<li>
The park could have permanent booths by major bike and component
manufacturers, as well as all kinds of instructional courses.
<li>
Reduce the antagonism mountain bikers have to put up with
from other trail users by giving mountain bikers a large
area with 'perfect' trails and no other users.
<li>
It could become a mecca for mountain bike racing.
</ul>
<p>
I started calling manufacturers of mountain bikes.  Then I called
magazines for mountain bikers.  Then I called one of my state's Senators
and spoke to an aide.  Everyone thought it was a great idea and
<i>want's to see it happen!</i>
<p>
And it <b>can</b> happen, but it needs <b>your support!</b>  Please link to 
<b>this page</b> for further details, and please
contact me directly by phone, fax, email, or pony express (or on a
mountain bike, of course) if you think you can directly contribute
time, money, talent, land, or advice for this project.  
<p>
But most importantly, please <a href="/mtnbikes/mtbemail.htm">send us email</a>
to let me know that you, the
mountain biking public, would support this idea.  That way, I can present
you as a viable group to investors, politicians, bureaucrats, pencil pushers, lawyers,
equestrians, environmentalists, industrialists, and couch
potatoes, because obviously, with something like this, some people
will think it is a bad idea.  So please show your support now!  The
first month this page was online, over 1000 people visited it!
<p> 
A few dozen emailed me, which is thrilling: the emails are
<b>overwhelmingly</b> enthusiastic.  I found new friends and new
rides--it's great!
But if you want to <b>stop war and have a cool place to ride</b> I'm gonna
need more feedback and a bigger show of support than that!  Would you
invest a couple million dollars on a few dozen emails?  Our web server
provides us with raw numbers.  I need to see you as individuals.
Mountain bikers are the greatest group of people in the
world--you know that--and this thing's good for our community!
So <a href="/mtnbikes/mtbemail.htm">send us email!</a> Puleez!
From all over the world! <I>THANKS</I>

<h2> This Entire Web Site is available for copying! </h2>
<p>
Beginners need a place to start, since starting is the hardest part.
<p>
Probably the best way to begin writing in the language of the web
(HTML) is to download somebody else's HTML and pull out everything
that is specific to them, and then add everything that you need
instead.
<p>
Please feel free to download <b>our</b> html web pages, take out the actual
application code that is specific to us, and then use the HTML 
code (generally, all the stuff inside of greater-than
and less-than signs), and insert your own application code, your own
pictures, etc. in it's place!  This is a
lot easier than writing all new code!  
And feel free to <b>leave a
link</b> to our stuff as you do it!  We don't mind!  
It's like shareware but instead of asking for money if you like our
stuff, we just ask that if you find our web site interesting, 
please give our <b>http://www.animatedsoftware.com</b> Internet address to others.   
<p>
Also, you can just download,
for example, our <a href="/contents.htm">Table of Contents</a> web page
to use as a skeleton for your own web page.  This is a lot easier
than learning or remembering the formats for tables and stuff.  
<p>
This should not be construed to imply that the entire web site is
copyright-free.  Quite the contrary.  Our interviews, transcripts,
lectures, papers, and tutorials are almost all copyrighted.  However,
the HTML code that I wrote to control the World Wide Web browser software is
yours for the taking.  Of course, it comes without warrantee, written
or implied, and we hope you will <a href="/giftshop/giftshop.htm">buy a tee-shirt or mug or
something</a> from us once in a while.
<p>
Copying is a lot easier than writing all new code!  I hardly ever write
all new code.  I usually just grab something that looks like what I
want and write new code by yanking out as much as 99% or more of the
old code and then building up from the skeleton, what's left of it.  I even
have a master "empty" HTML file, called, surprise, 
<a href="/empty.htm">empty.htm</a> and I keep it at the root level.
(You can download that file and use it too.)  Note that although I
store empty.htm at the root level (it's easier to get that way), 
it's directory structure is
written so that it works at a sublevel and would need minor
modifications if actually used at the root level.)
<p>
I don't actually use empty.htm that often, since I usually copy from
an existing but similar HTML file.  For example, I copy from one
interview to another when I want to transcribe an interview.  Or, if
I want to add an error description, I'll copy from one of the four
that exist.  Three of the others were copied from the others, and the
first one was copied from some other file that seemed similar to me,
or from empty.htm.
<p>
It's an easy way to get started with HTML.  Just STEAL THIS WEB SITE! 
And <b>please</b>--<i>tell people you did it!</i>

<p>
<h3> Ericsson Hot Air Pump </h3>
<p>
This pump was designed in the 1800's by John Ericsson, designer of the Civil War battleship Monitor.
<p>
The Ericsson Hot Air Pump had many advantages for rural customers: It was reliable, ran on virtually any fuel, had easily replaced parts, and could not explode.  (No steam is used, only a few cubic feet of hot air.)
<p>
A fascinating series of linkages sequences all the events. The pump works by continuously heating and cooling the same air.  The heated air expands and pushes up the TRANSFER PISTON (shaded gray here).
<p>
The air is transferred around the edges of Transfer Piston to the space between the top of the transfer piston and the AIR PISTON.  Water circulating around the cylinder cools the air, causing it to contract.
<p>
The water that cools the air was just brought up from the well.  It exits via the outlet pipe (behind, not shown.)  The Air Piston pushes the cooled, contracted air down past the Transfer Piston and the cycle repeats.

The Ericsson Hot Air Pump animation requires 1 meg of SVGA video
(VESA 1.2 or higher) and at least 4 megabytes of free EMM or XMS RAM.
It consists of the 35 other frames that complete the sequence for the
above image.  It is the largest animation we offer anywhere, and
positively delightful to watch!  Timing accuracy better than 1/500th

to run it at the perfect speed for you to enjoy!

This letter is pretty self-explanatory, however since it was written,

The Heart: The Engine of Life</a>
has been made Shareware and can now be 
<a href="/ftp/p11_ftps.htm">downloaded</a> 
for free!.  Although I cannot 
afford to send out free copies of our software to everyone that
can't afford it, I'm glad I sent <i>this</i> free copy!
<p>
<hr>
<p>
Dear Sirs:
<p>
Mr. Earl Kiel wrote to you on December 22, 1994 asking for an evaluation copy of the Engine of Life for DOS program for Tandala Hospital.  This arrived in Zaire in February 1995 and now I've had some time to use this program.
<p>
Since 1955 Tandala Hospital has grown to a 215-bed reference hospital for a population base of over 500,000 people. All major departments are represented within the hospital and include over 2,000 surgical procedures and 900 deliveries.  Our dental, eye, gynecological, surgical and general medicine outpatient clinics see over 30,000 patients each year and hospitalize between 4-5,000 patients with 50,000 patient days. We also have an active public health program that supervises 33 outlying health centers.
<p>
Training is very important for us with ongoing refresher courses for our nurses.  In addition we have a 4 year nursing school program.  We are looking into a residency program for Zairian doctors who have just completed medical school.
<p>
Thus, I've enjoyed using your Engine of Life.  I teach anatomy in our nursing school so have used this program to introduce the circulatory system.  Computers are a brand new concept for many.  With the mouse it is very helpful in pointing out major items.
<p>
This system gives a good overview.  For teaching anatomy, it is mainly a little too basic and more details would be appreciated.  The animation helps my students visualize something that was two dimensional before.  Since the average life span is only 50 years of age in Zaire, we don't see a lot of myocardial infarctions or arrhythmia problems.
<p>
In conclusion, I appreciate your willingness to share this program with a non-profit hospital in a foreign country.
<p>
In appreciation,

<title> Review of All About Pumps by Fred Blechman</title>
</header>
<body>
<hr>
<a href="/ascodesc/pumpdesc.htm">
<h1> All About Pumps</a> -- Educational Software Review</h1>
<br>
<h3>Review in Nuts & Volts Magazine, June, 1995.</h3>
<br>
<h4>By Fred Blechman.</h4>
<br>
<h5>Reprinted by permission of the author.</h5>
<p>
"ALL ABOUT PUMPS" is a software tutorial that places pumps into various categories and shows how they work through carefully drawn colorful animations.  Over 50 pumps are covered with over 100 animations-more animations than are found in entire computer-based encyclopedias from other software companies, according to the author.
<p>
Have you ever tried to get through a day without using a mechanical pump?  You probably don't realize how MANY pumps affect your life every day.
<p>
When programmer and artist Russell D. Hoffman first started his research to produce an animated educational software tutorial on pumps, he thought there would be about 17 different pumps.  By the time the project was completed he had animated over 50 pumps!
<p>
ALL ABOUT PUMPS ($59.95) is the result of nearly two years of research and development by Hoffman.  It is designed for everyone who use pumps-and we all use them, every day.  Specifically, it is designed for schools, pump manufacturers, distributors, and homeowners.
<p>
Is there really a need for this.  Author Hoffman surely thinks so.  "During my research for this project, I found a book on inventions, published by the Smithsonian Institute.  There was no mention of pumps.  Yet, there are close to 400 pump manufacturers in the nation and thousands of distributors," he points out.  "Every home, every car, boat, office building, factory-all have pumps."
<p>
ALL ABOUT PUMPS is a DOS program that requires a fairly powerful IBM PC or compatible.  Although it works fine on my 386, a 486 with 1 megabyte SVGA video graphics (VESA 1.2) and 4 megabytes EMM or XMS is recommended.  You'll also need about 25 megabytes of hard disk space (The program is now also available on CD-ROM.)  Since it runs in DOS, it can take full advantage of the hardware without the burden of Windows, resulting in large, smooth, and fast animations.
<p>
The authoring system employed to create ALL ABOUT PUMPS is called "RUSSELL'S 'P11' ANIMATION MACHINE," also written by Russell D. Hoffman.  "P11 began in 1984 when I was asked to program a tutorial about the human heart, titled "The Engine of Life."  I needed a powerful tool to illustrate blood flow, EKG simulations, vein grafts, and more.  
There was nothing available to do the job, so I designed and developed P11.  It is written entirely in Assembler language with over 100,000 lines of code," he reports (see Sidebar.)
<p>
ALL ABOUT PUMPS was written because Hoffman recognized several relevant factors.
<p>
First, there were no other tutorials available on this subject.  The big software houses tend to create dozens of tutorials that cover about four types: An encyclopedia, a dinosaur tutorial, a human body tutorial, and an automotive tutorial.
<p>
Second, Hoffman believes that high quality products can have a long enough shelf life to allow them to return the significant development costs if they "push the envelope" now.  Screen resolutions and machine speeds have reached a significant developmental stage.  Hoffman believes that Screen Mode 261 (1024 by 768 dots, 256 colors) is adequate for a product expected to remain useful for years to come.
<p>
Third, pumps really are fascinating.  They contain anywhere from zero to hundreds of working parts, work on many different mechanical and physical principles, are made of dozens of different materials and, of course, pumps are everywhere.
<p>
Fourth, and finally, pump motion is generally cyclic.  This made it particularly appropriate for the P11 development system Hoffman had written.
<p>
<h3>INSTALLATION</h3>
<p>
ALL ABOUT PUMPS comes on four hi-density 3.5-inch floppy diskettes, which install one at a time-oddly enough, in any sequence!  (A CD-ROM version has been made available since this review originally appeared.)  Each disk contains the installation driver, and all you do (while in DOS) is type INSTALL B: C: (that is, source drive and hard drive) for each diskette.  
Although you must enter this INSTALL command for each disk, the advantage is that it doesn't make any difference if you get the diskettes out of order.  A shortcut, after entering the first INSTALL command, is to just press the F3 key to repeat the command after changing diskettes.  (The CD-ROM version has NO installation and takes NO hard disk space at all!)
<p>
All together, it takes about 12 minutes for the four diskettes to install 229 files (19,368,858 bytes!) all into a single directory (P11) with several levels of subdirectories.  This includes a simple batch file to start the program.  Since new pumps and screens are being added with each new update, plan on 25 megabytes of hard disk space, or get the CD-ROM version.
<p>
All you do to start the program is type RUN PUMPS and hit the Enter key.  An attractive title screen appears quickly, with a RUNNING HORSE.  It just keeps running and running-like the Eveready Rabbit-until you press the Enter key to continue. (This same neat running horse appears on many screens throughout the program.)
<p>
The screen changes to the Main Menu, which describes the simple navigational controls to move between major screens.  Function key F5 takes you to a listing of all the pumps (52 in all), from which you can select any of the pumps.
<p>
F10 always takes you back to the Main Menu, where F1 takes you to two help screens that explain some additional key commands.  This is all so well done that you actually don't need any documentation to use this program! I'm impressed!
<p>
On the Main Menu screen is a list of eight main program choices:  Where Pumps Are Used; How Pumps Work; Types of Pumps; Measuring Pump Performance; the Right Pump for the Job; Historical Background and Some Famous Pumps; The Most Amazing Pump of All; Exit to DOS.  Move a floating finger-pointing hand to any topic with your mouse, click, and you're there.
<p>
ALL ABOUT PUMPS is organized into sections, subsections, and then screens, with simple navigation between sections and subsections.  Within each relatively small subsection you press the Enter key to advance.
<p>
Unfortunately, you can't "rewind" to a previous screen when in a subsection, which vary in length from one to twelve screens, but you can jump to the beginning of each subsection with the PgUp and PgDn keys.
<p>
Most screens have a large box with descriptive information, and the subject animated pump in motion.  You can speed up or slow down the pump using the up or down arrow keys.  For more information on a particular pump, just press F5 and select the pump you want from the list of pumps.
<p>
I haven't counted the total number of screens in ALL ABOUT PUMPS, but there seem to be about 200!  They are all colorful, easy to read, and those with animation operate quickly and smoothly even on my 80386 clone.
<p>
I wish more programs were this easy to use!  When was the last time you used a program where only two help screens tell you ALL you need to know to use the program effectively, where only a few keys are used for navigation, where no typed command are required-and where you can learn so much about a useful topic with so little effort?  Russell D. Hoffman should receive awards for this program-it's great!
<h3>SIDEBAR: RUSSELL'S 'P11' ANIMATION MACHINE</h3>
<p>
The authoring system used to produce ALL ABOUT PUMPS-and all Animated Software Co. products-is called RUSSELL'S 'P11' ANIMATION MACHINE.  It is the result of over 10 years of development.
<p>
In 1984, Russell D. Hoffman was asked to develop a human heart tutorial.  That tutorial needed lots of animation, as well as an ability to place text on the screen and to get input from the user.  Further, the tool needed to be designed in such a way that the application developer could modify, rearrange, add, delete, and change the tutorial as the designed it.
<p>
To accomplish this, Hoffman wrote a development system in ASSEMBLER language.  Originally designed to run in DOS on 8088-based IBM-PCs, it is compact, powerful, and fast.  P11 combines a multi-frame picture editor with a text editor and player for a complete developer's environment.  Hoffman used it to develop THE ENGINE OF LIFE, a human heart tutorial.
<p>
In 1984, very few software companies were developing animation tools for the PC.  GRASP was probably not out yet, AUTODESK ANIMATOR was several years from its first release, and nothing else was available.  P11 was therefore not a copy of anything, and it took a unique approach to the problem of allowing the user the ability to develop interactive animated educational software.  
<p>
What is unique about P11 is the tight combination of animation capabilities and interactive commands.  For example, virtually all animations can easily be sped up or slowed down, even single-stepped forward or back.  
This allows the user to run it at a comfortable pace, to understand the action.  Timing control is accurate to about 1/584th of a second.  A form of "fuzzy logic" is used to set the speed: about 1/5th of the current frame rate is added or subtracted with each speed change keypress.  This allows fairly quick speed changes from very slow to very fast.
<p>
P11 is a continually growing thing, and was last upgraded in Nov. '94.  It is available through numerous BBSs and online services, shareware disk, and CD-ROM distributors. 
<p>
RUSSELL'S 'P11' ANIMATION MACHINE (also known as P11) can be ordered directly from The Animated Software Co.
<p>
Just send $4.95 plus $4.00 shipping and handling (s/h), plus sales tax in California.  For Canada and Mexico, s/h is $5.00.  Foreign orders please add $6.00 for s/h.  If you choose to register the program, the disk cost may be deducted from the $25.00 registration fee!
<p>
"The Engine of Life" about the human heart is also available, last upgraded in Nov. '94.  It is used by thousands of hospitals, schools, doctor offices, and so on.  Several other products have been created with P11 by the author and others over the years.  Call (800) 551-2726 (Pacific Time) for a free catalog.
<p>
<h3>TECHNICAL SPECS FOR "P11"</h3>
<p>
Hardware requirements:  (See our <a href="/ascodesc/p11_desc.htm"> HTML page for P11 </a> for current specs.)
<p>
<h3>RUSSELL D. HOFFMAN</h3>
<p>
The author of ALL ABOUT PUMPS became involved with computers as a career in 1980 when he attended The Computer Processing Institute in Bridgeport, CT.  This school offered a six-month course in COBOL business programming, with some time spent on RPG II and ASM.  Programming was done through punch-cards.
<p>
Hoffman has created and given away (at computer trade shows throughout the Northeast) about 20,000 random art drawings using an interactive drawing program he wrote for the old NEC 8201A laptop computer (similar to the Tandy 100).  He has also written many display routines for driving the LCD display on the NEC, and the Panasonic VP-6801 P30 six-pen plotter.  
This led to other assignments to create artwork for various devices, including monitors, printers, plotters, lasers, oscilloscopes, and LED matrices.
<p>
Hoffman also has "another life" when not working with P11 projects.  He created comedy radio routines that have played on the Dr. Demento Show and elsewhere, and over 200 of his commentaries, humorous essays, and letters have been published.  An avid aviation buff, he soloed in 1988, and flies a Cessna 172 Skyhawk at every opportunity.  He also likes mountain biking, hiking, ocean and lake swimming, reading, photography, and loud music-as well as quiet music, dancing, and chocolate!
<p>
His wife, Sharon, is also a computer programmer and the editor of a computer magazine.
<p>
Hoffman says he has dabbled extensively in electronics, but avoids hardware.  He claims that everything he builds either smokes, shocks him, or just doesn't work...

<h3>Wobble Plate Piston Pump</h3>
<p>
   This pump has pistons in a stationary block, and a rotating wobble plate.  There might be 4, 5, or more pistons (usually an odd number are used) -- only two shown here.
<p>
   Each piston has a valve within it and another valve behind it.  Fluid comes in on the wobble plate side (on the bottom left in this drawing) and exits under pressure in the back (on the right here).
<p>
   The pistons are pushed against the wobble plate with large springs.  A pair of smaller springs force the valves (small metal balls) closed.  The spring inside the piston is fairly weak, since only suction is used to force it open.
<p>
   This type of pump can develop incredible pressure -- 10,000 P.S.I. or more.  It is commonly used for low-volume applications.  Hand-operated wobble pumps were used as emergency fuel pumps on some early aircraft.
<p>
   Compare this pump, also known as a "wabble" plate pump, to the <a href="/pumpglos/radialpi.htm">radial piston pump</a>, <a href="/pumpglos/swashpla.htm">swash plate pump</a>, and <a href="/pumpglos/bentaxis.htm">bent axis pump</a>.

<h3>New York's FIRE FIGHTER Fireboat</h3>
<p>
<IMG ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=10 SRC="/pics/pumps/fireboa4.gif" ALT="">
<p>
  Every major harbor has one or more fireboats to protect the docks and ships where ground-based fire vehicles cannot go.
<p>
  Originally (late 1800's) these boats were made from old, converted tugboats.  Within a few decades they had proved their worth and specially-designed fireboats began to be built.
<p>
  Certainly the most famous fireboat of all time is the FIRE FIGHTER of New York City, which began service in 1938 and still answers the call.
<p>
  FIRE FIGHTER was designed by William Francis Gibbs, who also designed the ocean liners AMERICA and UNITED STATES.
<p>
  Four 5000 GPM De Laval two-stage centrifugal pumps provide a total pumping capacity of 20,000 gallons per minute at 150 PSI.  They can also be connected in series to provide 10,000 GPM at 300 PSI.
<p>
  W. F. Gibbs also designed a land-based fire truck -- the most powerful ever built -- called the Super Pumper, which served NYC from 1965 to 1982.  It was built by Mack Trucks, and could feed 35 hoselines at once.

<h3> CEM Pump </h3>
<p>
<a href="/pics/pumps/cempump4.gif"><IMG ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=20 SRC="/pics/pumps/cempump2.gif" ALT=""></A>
<p>
  CEM or Cylindrical Energy Module is a fascinating, simple new pump/compressor/engine invented by Eddie Paul, president of EP Industries in El Segundo, CA.
<p>
  The CEM is a modification of the swash-plate pump. In the model shown, six cylinders in a rotating rotor assembly are moved back and forth via Piston Drive Pins which follow a stationary Sinusiodal Cam Track that encircles the rotor assembly.
<p>
  With each revolution, each piston moves back and forth twice.  The pistons are double-headed so there are 24 power strokes per revolution.  There are no valves.
<p>
  At each end of the pump, four stationary holes the diameter of the pistons function as intake and exhaust ports.  Output volume is proportional to rotational speed, and pressure is proportional to the horsepower of the drive motor.
<p>
  Mr. Paul has not even begun to figure out all the things his new pump can do, but with only seven moving parts and a virtually clog-free operation, a multitude of worldwide uses are certain to appear.
<p>
  This new pump shows that even after thousands of years, there is still room for radical new ideas from inventive geniuses.

<h3> Air Lift Pump </h3>
<p>
   The Air Lift Pump is a type of deep well pump, sometimes used to remove water from mines.  It can also be used to pump a slurry of sand and water or other "gritty" solutions.
<p>
   In its most basic form this pump has NO moving parts, other than an air compressor.  The efficiency of the air compressor is a prime factor in determining the overall efficiency of the pump.
<p>
   Increased efficiency in the pump itself can be achieved - but with added complexity.  Shown here is a simple Air Lift Pump.
<p>
   Compressed air is piped down a shaft.  The air then returns up a Discharge Pipe carrying water with it.  The pump works by "aerating" the water in the discharge pipe.
<p>
   The added air lowers the specific gravity of the fluid mixture.   Since it is lighter than the surrounding water, it is pushed upwards.
<p>
   This type of pump can lift 20 to 2000 gallons per minute, up to about 750 feet.  The discharge pipe must be placed deep into the water, from 70% of the height of the pipe above the water level (for lifts to 20 feet) down to 40 percent for higher lifts.

<h3> Archimedes Screw</h3>
<p>
   This pump is at least 2,000 years old.
<p>
   The Archimedes Screw (also called an Archimedes Snail) was used for irrigation and powered by horses, people, mules, etc.  This pump is even used today, although rarely!
<p>
   The helix revolves inside a tube (only the bottom of the tube is shown) and the water rises accordingly.
<p>
   Whether or not it was actually invented by Archimedes is certainly debatable, though his overall brilliance is not.

<h3> Bent Axis Pump </h3>
<p>
   In this pump, the pistons are at an angle to the drive shaft and Thrust Plate.  The piston block shaft is connected to the drive shaft by a universal joint, not shown.  The drive shaft, thrust plate, piston block shaft, and piston block all revolve.
<p>
   The connecting rods are attached to the thrust plate and revolve with it, unlike the swash plate pump where the piston rods slide past a stationary swash plate.
<p>
   The outlet ports are semi-circular holes in the Valve Plate, shown on the far right of the animation on edge and in a head-on view below, right.
<p>
   As the pump revolves, half the pistons suck in fluid as they pass over the intake port.  The other pistons discharge their fluid through the outlet port.
<p>
   This pump should be compared to the <a href="/pumpglos/radialpi.htm">radial piston pump</a>, <a href="/pumpglos/swashpla.htm">swash plate pump</a>, and <a href="/pumpglos/wobble.htm">wobble pump</a>.

<h3> Bilge Pump, Hand Operated </h3>
<p>
   Most small boats have these.  Even boats with electric bilge pumps often have hand operated Bilge Pumps for emergencies, and lifeboats have them too.
<p>
   A flapper valve (rubber disk) at the base of the pump keeps water from falling out when the handle is depressed.
<p>
   At the same time, a sliding disk valve at the bottom of the traveling piston, is forced open by water pressure allowing water to enter the upper part of the cylinder.
<p>
   On the upstroke the disk valve on the piston is forced closed (down) and water is forced up and out the top.  At the same time the flapper valve opens and the decreased pressure in the lower part of the cylinder sucks water in from the bilge.

<h3> Bucket Pump </h3>
<p>
   The Bucket Pump is similar to the <a href="/pumpglos/rag_pump.htm">Rag Pump</a> and <a href="/pumpglos/liftdisk.htm">Lift Disk Pump</a> but does not require a tube to draw the water up.  It is not very common anymore, but can still be found occasionally.
<p>
   One advantage of this pump is that the buckets don't turn upright until they are well below the surface of the water.  They fill with clean water, and bring up less of the scum that often floats on the surface of a well.
<p>
   Large old sailing ships sometimes used Bucket Pumps.  They were also used on farms and many other places.
<p>
   Of course, the length of the chain and the number of buckets can vary greatly.

<h3> Crescent Pump </h3>
<p>
   This pump consists of two rotating gears; an Internal Gear with the teeth on the outside, and an External gear with the teeth on the inside.  The External Gear is larger and has more teeth, but the teeth are the same size.
<p>
   As the teeth separate (lower left side in this drawing) they pass over the intake hole (shown behind the gears in black on the left).  They "suck" in fluid, then the gears are separated by a Crescent Seal (shown in brown.)
<p>
   When the teeth start to come together again (upper right here) they squeeze the fluid through the outlet hole (shown in black at the top center of this drawing.)
<p>
   Normally the inner gear is attached to a drive shaft and the outer gear is turned by the inner gear at the point of contact (upper left area of this drawing.)
<p>
   Advantages of the crescent pump include its simple design and low maintenance requirements.  The crescent pump is common in many applications including automatic transmissions.

<h3> Ctesibian Pump </h3>
<p>
   The Ctesibian pump is over two thousand years old.  Firefighters used Ctesibians for centuries.  It is a type of force pump.
<p>
   It is operated by two, four or six men -- sometimes more -- standing on either end of the "walking beam" to which the piston rods are attached.
<p>
   The cylinders are made of copper or brass, the pistons often of wood.  There are two valves for each cylinder and the base of the pump sits in the water source.
<p>
   An air chamber below the nozzle acts as a hydraulic accumulator to maintain an even flow of water out the nozzle.
<p>
   The water source might be suppied by a bucket brigade of people.  The purpose of the pump is to create a stream of water for putting out the fire.

<p>
<h3> Diaphragm Pump </h3>
<p>
  Cars often use a Diaphragm Pump to move gasoline from the gas tank to the carburetor or fuel injection plugs.
<p>
  The gasoline diaphragm pump in a car is operated by a cam geared directly to rotating parts of the engine.  The cam pushes a pushrod.
<p>
  The brown rod shown in this drawing is moved by the pushrod. It pushes the diaphragm in (a spring forces it back out.)
<p>
  Fuel pumps like this one operate continuously but have a safety valve which returns fuel to the input side of the pump if pressure rises above a set level.
<p>
  The pump usually has a fuel filter built into it.  (The fuel system will have several other filters.)
<p>
  Diaphragm pumps are very common and come in many sizes.  Modern plastics are flexible and long lasting making this an ideal low-maintenance pump for many applications.

<p>
<h3> Double Diaphram Pump </h3>
<p>
  Double Diaphragm pumps offer smooth flow, reliable operation, and the ability to pump a wide variety of viscous and impure liquids.
<p>
  The Air Operated Double Diaphragm pump is illustrated on the right.  This pump uses a very simple valve system to move the DIAPHRAGM ROD.  The flexible diaphragms (shown in white here) are round disks attached at each end of the Diaphragm Rod.
<p>
  The PILOT SPOOL (the middle of the three horizontal rods) is pushed back and forth whenever the Diaphragm Rod reaches the end of its throw.  The Pilot Spool allows air to move the Air Distribution Valve (the top rod in this drawing) back and forth.
<p>
  The AIR DISTRIBUTION ROD controls air flow to the left or right air chamber, reversing on each stroke.
<p>
  The four BALL VALVES are free-floating and operated by pressure differences in the pumped liquid.  Flapper valves are also commonly used.  In the pump shown, liquid flow is from the bottom to the top.
<p>
  Sanitary Double Diaphragm pumps, often made of plastic and/or stainless steel, are used in the food industry to pump everything from sliced fruit, to sausage, to chocolate.

<p>
<h3> Duplex Pump </h3>
<p>
  The "direct acting reciprocating steam pump" was invented by Henry R. Worthington in 1840.  It is still used today, often powered by compressed air instead of steam.
<p>
  DUPLEX PUMPS like the one shown here have two steam and two water cylinders.   Only one of each is shown, the other cylinders being directly behind these.
<p>
  Duplex pumps have no "dead spots" because one or the other steam piston is always under force of steam (or compressed air). The two pistons are about 1/4 cycle out of synchronization with each other.
<p>
  The steam enters the system through the top chamber on the left where the steam valve slides back and forth over the various intake and exhaust pipes.  The black hole just under the steam valve is the exhaust vent for used steam.
<p>
  The back pump, behind and not shown here, controls the steam valve for the pump shown which controls, through the rocker arm in the middle, the steam valve for the piston in back.
<p>
  On the water end of the pump, on the right here, the lower two valves are the intake valves and the upper valves are the discharge valves.  A hydraulic accumulator is usually located just above the pump to smooth the flow and prevent water hammer.
<p>
  As many as five sets of steam and water cylinders are linked together in various types of reciprocating steam pumps.

<p>
<br>
<p>
<h3> Dutch Pumps </h3>
<p>
  For three years, from 1849 to 1852, three huge steam pumping stations were run night and day to drain a lake.  The area to be drained, is called the Haarlemmermeer.
<p>
  All three stations were based on standard Cornish pumps and were built essentially alike.  One of them, Cruquius, is still in existence as a museum and is illustrated here.
<p>
  There are eight pumps surrounding the central steam cylinder, but at Cruquius only seven were actually connected because the steam cylinder could not power all eight.
<p>
  The cycle shown works as follows: First, steam is introduced into the center of the cylinder (at about 45 P.S.I.)  The steam pushes the piston up, pushing the upper valves in the pumps down (two of eight are shown).
<p>
  About halfway up the inlet steam valve is closed but steam continues to expand and push the piston up.  It slows to a stop at the top of the cycle.
<p>
  Next the exhaust valve is closed and the equilibrium valve is opened.  Steam then flows around to the top of the piston and, with the aid of gravity, pushes down on the piston.  The upper valves on the pumps move up and water is raised.
<p>
  The equilibrium valve closes and the cycle repeats about seven times a minute.

<h3> Finger Pump </h3>
<p>
  Finger pumps push a series of rods against a flexible tubing in sequence, forcing fluid along the tube.  In this pump the fluid moves from left to right.
<p>
  Since nothing but the tube actually touches the fluid, the fluid can be kept clean so this pump is often found in medical applications, pumping blood or other fluids.
<p>
  The individual fingers can be operated by a rotating camshaft above them, by individual solenoids electronically actuated in sequence, or by other methods.

<h3> Fish Tank Diaphragm Air Pump </h3>
<p>
   This pump is designed for continous operation.  It is simple and reliable.
<p>
   The motor operates directly off of house current at 60 cycles per second (signified by the sine wave in the upper right corner).
<p>
   The electric current flows through thin wires around an iron core.  The wire is wrapped around one side of the core, many hundreds of times.
<p>
   Whenever the current reverses (60 times per second) the magnetic flux created by the current is reversed.  This alternately pushes and pulls the armature.
<p>
   The armature moves the diaphragm in and out directly.  The valves are forced open and closed by the air pressure created by the movement of the diaphragm.

<h3> Force Pump, Double Acting </h3>
<p>
   This pump is more efficient that a single-acting force pump such as a simple Lift Pump or a hand-operated Bilge Pump.
<p>
   Each stroke of the piston fills one chamber and empties another, which nearly doubles the flow rate (less the volume of the piston rod) over a single-acting force pump.  It also smooths the flow.
<p>
   From the outside this pump can take many forms, but the basic principal of operation will be identical.

<h3> Gear Pump </h3>
<p>
This is a type of Rotary Force Pump.  Gear pumps are extremely simple and reliable.
<p>
Depending on the number of teeth, the "idler" gear might be driven directly by the "drive" gear.  Generally with six or more teeth this is possible.  In other cases an extra gear external to the pump drives the secondary gear at the same rate.
<p>
The teeth on Gear Pumps can be spur (straight), helical (slanted), herringbone, etc.  There can be two, or more teeth on each gear -- twenty is not uncommon.  The diameter of the gears and their thickness varies widely.
<p>
The many variations have different effects on the efficiency, strength, smoothness and other areas of operation.
<p>
This pump will pump in the reverse direction if you reverse the direction of rotation of the gears. Two pairs of valves can be added to make this a <a href="/pumpglos/gear_rev.htm">Reversing Gear Pump</a>, which pumps in the same direction regardless of which direction the gears rotate.

<p>
   This is a modification of a regular <a href="/pumpglos/gearpump.htm">Gear Pump</a> and all the variations in that pump (number of teeth, size, shape, etc.) are possible here too.
<p>
   The tubing around the edges of this pump returns pressure -- not liquid -- to opposite sides of the shafts.  Very little fluid is transferred anywhere by these extra tubes.
<p>
   By equalizing pressure on each side of the shafts, friction and wear are both reduced in comparison to the standard gear pump.
<p>
   Other types of pumps, such as <a href="/pumpglos/vanepump.htm">Vane Pumps</a>, sometimes are balanced in similar ways.

<h3> Gear Pump, 2-Lobe </h3>
<p>
   This type of gear pump has two lobes on each shaft.  The lobes nearly touch each other in the center forming a fairly tight seal.
<p>
   They also nearly touch the casing and when they revolve they carry fluid around the outer edge to the outlet, at the top in this drawing.
<p>
   This type of gear pump, or a <a href="/pumpglos/gear2lob.htm">three-lobe</a> version, is often used as a supercharger for diesel engines, forcing air (not liquid) into the power cylinder.

<h3> Gear Pump, 3-Lobe </h3>
<p>
   This is a basically a type of Gear Pump but with lobes instead of gears.
<p>
   The three-lobe gear pump, like the <a href="/pumpglos/gear2lob.htm">two-lobe</a> version, is commonly used to force high-pressure air into combustion compartments of a diesel engine.
<p>
   The output of these pumps is more pulsed than the output of a gear pump because there are fewer teeth.  The fluid is delivered in comparatively larger packets.
<p>
   Gases are compressible (whereas liquids basically are not), therefore the three lobe and two lobe gear pumps work particularly well with gases, since the compressibility helps smooth the flow.

<h3> Reversing Gear Pump </h3>
<p>
   This type of rotary gear pump moves liquid in the same direction regardless of the direction the gears turn.
<p>
   The valves (shown in yellow in this drawing) are forced open and closed by the difference in pressure on the input and output sides.  
<p>
   In this drawing, fluid in the higher-pressure output side is shown in light blue while fluid in the lower-pressure input side is dark blue.
<p>
   Notice that when the green gear starts moving clockwise, the fluid in the outer circular tubes changes pressure but stops flowing, and fluid flows more or less straight up.
<p>
   When the red gear is moving clockwise, fluid travels in a sideways 'S' shape through the outer circular tubes.
<p>
   The pump in this drawing reverses direction about every 8 seconds.

<h3> Global Pump </h3>
<p>
This air-operated pump is remarkably simple and adaptable.  It has no diaphragms, seals or bearings. The only parts that move are the intake and outlet valves, and the air valves.
<p>
The pump uses compressed air passing through a nozzle to create lower pressure in the main chamber (80 PSI needed).  The lower pressure draws water into the chamber.
<p>
When the chamber is full an air valve changes position, and the air pressure is then used to push the fluid out of the main chamber, at 80 PSI.  When the fluid is emptied the valve switches back again and the cycle repeats.
<p>
This pump's simplicty and safety (no electricity, no rotating or sliding parts) are its major strong points.

<h3> Hand Pump </h3>
<p>
   This pump is used for hand lotions, i.e. thick (high viscosity) liquids.
<p>
   There are two metal balls inside this pump.  The large lower ball fits inside the first few turns of the spring.  The middle turns of the spring are of reduced diameter so they act as a stop for the ball.
<p>
   This particular version of hand pump is patented by Calmar, Inc. though many fairly similar pump mechanisms exist.

<h3> Impeller Pump </h3>
<p>
   Probably this is the most versatile pump of all.  Impeller mechanisms are the basis of thousands of types of pumps.
<p>
   The number of blades can vary from 1 to 10 or more.  They operate over a wide speed range -- from less than 30 to more than 3000 RPM.
<p>
   Impeller pumps are excellent for moving impure liquids since they do not clog very easily.  For very impure liquids such as sludge, a single blade is sometimes used.
<p>
   Impeller pumps range in diameter from less than a quarter inch to 10 feet or more.  Sometimes they have diffusers to increase efficiency.
<p>
   Sometimes the output of one impeller is fed directly into another impeller to increase the head.  As many as six or ten might be linked together, or connected in two facing sets to double the output and even the pressures on the shaft and pump casing.

<p>
<h3> Impeller Mechanism, 2-lobe </h3>
<p>
   By having only two vanes, the risk of clogging from foreign matter in the fluid being pumped is reduced over a pump with more vanes.  (For even messier fluids a single vane can be used.)
<p>
   This type of pump might be used for pumping sludge or other contaminated liquids.  It is also common for moving liquid paper stock.
<p>
   All of the head in an impeller type pump is created by the impeller itself.  The rest of the parts induce losses to the maximum head.
<p>
   Losses are induced by friction of the fluid against the sides of the parts, by mechanical friction of the pump shaft, and from hydraulic efficiency losses such as fluid eddies and changes in direction (which takes energy).

<h3> Impeller Diffuser Pump </h3>
<p>
   The efficiency of the Impeller Pump can be greatly increased by the addition of stationary Diffuser Vanes.  Large Impeller-diffuser pumps can achieve efficiency ratings of 90 percent.
<p>
   The number of diffuser vanes is always different than the number of impeller vanes.  This is so that the edges of the rotating impeller vanes do not come close to all the ends of the diffuser vanes at the same time.
<p>
   This prevents thumping or knocking, and excessive buildup of pressures.
<p>
   In this drawing the innermost set of vanes revolves and the outer set is stationary.

<br>
<p>
<h3> Impeller Diffuser, Multi-Stage </h3>
<p>
  Multi-stage impeller pumps have substantially increased heads over single-impeller types.
<p>
  In the model shown, there are five rotating impellers in sequence, with the intake from the lower hole on the left and the outlet at the lower right.  The upper two holes connect to the lower holes, balancing intake and outlet pressures on the shaft.
<p>
  The liquid swirls (not shown here) with the rotation of the pump.  As many as 12 separate impellers are often connected together to increase flow rates and head.
<p>
  In many models the fluid enters at either end and works towards the middle, or enters one end and immediately after the first impeller, is sent to the opposite end to the second impeller, then back to the first end, and so on, exiting in the middle.
<p>
  The advantages of such a system are improved pressure balance on the shaft and relatively low pressure around the seals.  On the pump shown the right-hand seal has the pressure of four stages pushing against it.

<h3> Infusion Pump </h3>
<p>
   Infusion Pumps are used to deliver very small quantities of drugs over long periods of time.  They are also commonly called Syringe Pumps.
<p>
   A worm gear (shaft) slowly turns, moving the plunger of the syringe in, and pushing the medication out.  These can also be used in reverse to withdraw fluids.
<p>
   Here the action is shown much faster than it usually would be.  The injection might take place over a period of many hours.
<p>
   A typical infusion pump might have a flow rate range from .2 cubic centimeters (cc) to 500cc per hour.  At .2cc per hour, a 10cc syringe would require 50 hours to empty.

<h3> Jet Pump </h3>
<p>
   A Jet Pump is a type of impeller-diffuser pump that is used to draw water from wells into residences.  It can be used for both shallow (25 feet or less) and deep wells (up to about 200 feet.)
<p>
   Shown here is the underwater part of a deep well jet pump.  Above the surface is a standard impeller-diffuser type pump.  The output
of the diffuser is split, and half to three-fourths of the water is sent back down the well through the Pressure Pipe (shown on the right here).
<p>
   At the end of the pressure pipe the water is accelerated through a cone-shaped nozzle at the end of the pressure pipe, shown here within a red cutaway section.  Then the water goes through a Venturi in the Suction Pipe (the pipe on the left).
<p>
   The venturi has two parts:  the Venturi Throat, which is the pinched section of the suction tube; and above that is the venturi itself which is the part where the tube widens and connects to the suction pipe.
<p>
   The venturi speeds up the water causing a pressure drop which sucks in more water through the intake at the very base of the unit.  The water goes up the Suction Pipe and through the impeller -- most of it for another trip around to the venturi.

<h3> Lift Disk Pump </h3>
<p>
   This type of pump uses flat disks (shown on edge in red here) attached to a chain or rope.  The disks draw water up a tube.
<p>
   This type of pump is probably thousands of years old.  It is similar to a <a href="/pumpglos/rag_pump.htm">Rag Pump</a> or <a href="/pumpglos/bucketpu.htm">Bucket Pump</a>.

<h3> Lift Pump </h3>
<p>
   This pump can still be found on farms everywhere.  The maximum suction to the lower valve (shown in red here; called the FOOT VALVE) is about 30 feet.
<p>
   Water enters the lower chamber when the movable sealed plate is raised.  The red valve is open and the green valve on the plate is closed.
<p>
   When the plate is pushed back down, the red valve closes, and the liquid in the lower chamber is forced through the green valve, which opens.
<p>
   On the next upstroke of the plate, the liquid which passed through the green valve on the previous downstroke is raised and spills out the spout.

<p>
<h3> Magnetic Flux Pump </h3>
<p>
  This pump uses the magnetic attraction of particles within the fluid to move the liquid.  Electromagnets are arranged in rings around a pipe. The magnets are electrified in turn causing the liquid to move along the wave of electromagnetism.
<p>
  Naturally, there must be magnetic particles within the liquid for this pump to work.  Although magnetic flux pumps have very limited uses, they do offer several substantial advantages.
<p>
  First, there are no seals needed anywhere.  If the system moves a dangerous liquid this reduces the chance of spills.  It also reduces maintenance, increases reliability, and makes it easier to move high-temperature liquid metals.
<p>
  Second, there are no moving parts (besides the liquid itself.)  This decreases wear and increases reliability substantially.
<p>
  Magnetic flux pumps come in a wide range of capacities and different models use different principals of electromagnetism.

<h3> Peristaltic Pump </h3>
<p>
   One of the main advantages of the Peristaltic Pump is cleanliness.  It also utilizes another advantage: Fragile blood cells are not damaged by this pump.
<p>
   The flexible tube (in this drawing its edges are blue and yellow for clarity) is connected on the inlet side to the patient's artery, and on the outlet side to the patient's vein.
<p>
   In this example three rollers on rotating arms pinch the tube against an arc and move the fluid along.  There are usually three or four sets of rollers.
<p>
   Peristaltic pumps have a variety of medical applications.  They can be used to add nutrients to blood, to force blood through filters to clean it, or to move blood through the body and lungs during open heart surgery.

<h3> Piston Pump </h3>
<p>
   The basic Piston Pump is very simple having just two valves and one stuffing box.
<p>
   In this example the reciprocating piston is driven back and forth by a rotating mechanism.
<p>
   This piston pump uses suction to raise water into the chamber.  The lower valve can be placed below water level.
<p>
   The piston must be within about 25 feet of the water level, but the water can then be raised quite high.

<p>
<h3> Progressive Cavity Pump </h3>
<p>
  Progressive (or Progressing) Cavity pumps, a type of Single Screw pump, are used for highly viscous liquids such as peanut butter or glue, and also for liquids with significant amounts of solids such as cement or sand slurry.
<p>
  Fuild proceeds from the entrance, at the top on the right side here, to the left.  The rotor revolves inside the stator.
<p>
  The stator is a twisted cavity with an oval-shaped cross-section.   It is usually made of natural or synthetic rubber, steel, or plastic.  The rotor is usually steel.
<p>
  For a given diameter and shape of the rotor, doubling the number of stages (the length) will double the output pressure.
<p>
  The area of the cross-section of the rotor determines the backpressure the pump must withstand.

<h3> Propeller Pump </h3>
<p>
  This is similar to other impeller pumps, but the fluid being pumped is not sent in a circular path.  Rather, it proceeds more or less in a straight direction up to the discharge elbow.
<p>
  Shown is a vertical propeller pump (horizontal and angled versions also exist).  Here, the motor sits above the discharge shaft.  The distance to the propeller is usually well under 100 feet and often between 10 and 20 feet.
<p>
  The propeller can be placed below the surface of the liquid, where it will always be primed.
<p>
  Propeller pumps are generally high-speed but with low heads.  They can be quite large, measuring over a dozen feet in diameter and moving over 50,000 gallons per minute.  Some have adjustable-pitch blades.

<h3> Pumper Truck </h3>
<p>
  Fire fighters need water - and lots of it.  For thousands of years the Ctesibian pump was commonly used to pump water onto a fire.
<p>
  Now a PUMPER TRUCK is brought in, carrying a variety of pumps within it. Typical service requirements for each pump may be 1000 gallons per minute at a minimum pressure of 120 P.S.I. (pounds per square inch).
<p>
  Such a pump might supply seven or eight fire hoses at once, each a thousand feet long.
<p>
  A turret pipe nozzle such as that shown here can deliver water at upwards of 200 P.S.I..  This is possible because it doesn't have to be held, just aimed, and the water doesn't need to run through hoses.
<p>
  Many types of pumps are used for fire pumper trucks including piston pumps, rotary pumps, and single- and multi-stage impeller pumps (serial and parallel centrifugal pumps).

<h3> Quimby Screw Pump </h3>
<p>
   Quimby Screw Pumps use closely matched screws which mesh to form pockets of fluid.  Each shaft has a left-hand screw and a right-hand screw, for hydraulic pressure balance.
<p>
   On the left is a side view.  The animation on the right is a top (or bottom) view.  The inlet is at each end and the outlet is in the middle.  The two shafts are geared together and revolve at the same rate, up to about 1750 RPM.
<p>
   Quimby Screws often pump oil, which lubricates the meshing gears.  They have no valves or small parts to wear out or break, and the stuffing boxes are in the low pressure part of the pump where they are less prone to wear.
<p>
   A Quimby Screw can pump 4,000 gallons per minute at 1,000 P.S.I.

<p>
<h3> Radial Piston Pump </h3>
<p>
   Radial Piston Pumps can produce a very smooth flow under extreme pressure.  Generally they are variable-displacement pumps.
<p>
   In variable models, flow rate changes when the shaft holding the rotating pistons is moved with relation to the casing (in different models either the shaft or the casing moves.)  Output can also be varied by changing the rotation speed.
<p>
   In this animation if the casing (shown in red) is moved to the left, the flow rate would decrease to zero.  If it is moved even further to the left the flow would reverse.
<p>
   Input in this animation is through the two black holes near the center below the "Pintle" (shown in yellow).  Output is through the top two black holes, above the pintle.  Higher pressure areas are indicated with a lighter blue fluid color.
<p>
   The pistons are usually forced out by springs.  They are forced back in, expelling liquid, by the casing.
<p>
   An odd number of pistons is always used to smooth the hydraulic balance.  These pumps revolve at speeds up to about 1200 RPM.
<p>

<p>
<h3> Rag Pump </h3>
<p>
   Rag Pumps have been used for at least 400 years and probably a lot longer.
<p>
   Their use was widespread.  Rag pumps were used aboard large sailing ships to bring salt water up for various uses and they were also used in wells.  Horses, a water wheel, or "tramping men" all might have supplied the power to turn the wheel.
<p>
   Cloth bundles, usually just rags, are tied in knots at intervals on a rope or chain.  The chain is then hung around a wheel and through a tube that goes below water level.  The base of the tube is flanged to prevent the rag balls from catching.
<p>
   When the wheel rotates water is drawn up a tube.
<p>
   This pump is very similar to a <a href="/pumpglos/liftdisk.htm">Lift Disk Pump</a> and <a href="/pumpglos/bucketpu.htm">Bucket Pump</a>.

<h3> Ram Pump </h3>
<p>
   Ram Pumps only have two moving parts, making them virtually maintenance-free.
<p>
   Water enters the lower of two chambers through a pipe from an elevated water source.  This pipe must be relatively long and thick so that significant force (inertia) is developed as the water moves down it to the chamber.
<p>
   As water rushes in it starts the pump.  The chamber fills and the ESCAPE VALVE (on the left here) shuts.  The DELIVERY VALVE to the AIR DOME opens.
<p>
   The momentum of the rushing water pushes some water into the air dome and compresses the air that partially fills that chamber.  When the pressure is great enough it opposes the force of the incoming water and the second valve drops shut.
<p>
   After the delivery valve shuts, air pressure pushes water up the outlet pipe.  In the first chamber, all valves are closed and no water can move, so the escape valve drops open and the cycle begins to repeat, about once a second.
<p>
   This is an ideal pump when a plentiful water source is available.  Roughly 3/4's of the water that passes through the system exits via the escape valve.

<h3> Rotary Cam Pump </h3>
<p>
   Rotary Cam Pumps come in many variations.  This animation is also called a Cochrane Rotary Pump.  It is not in use now and is mainly of historical curiosity.
<p>
   In this model the intake is the lower tube on the right and the outlet is at the top.  The piston slide arm moves around inside a slot in the casing.
<p>
   As an eccentric cam rotates the circular plunger (shown in gray) around the edge of the casing, fluid is swirled around the edge to the outlet port.
<p>
   One variation of this type of pump is the Kinney Rotating Plunger Pump which ejects the fluid through a hollow in the slide pin and a discharge port on the discharge side of the pump.

<h3> Simplex Pump </h3>
<p>
   The Simplex, or Single-Cylinder Double Acting, Pump was invented in 1840 by Henry R. Worthington.
<p>
   A Simplex Pump is a reciprocating pump.  This pump has a single liquid cylinder which forces liquid out through the top outlet on both the in and the out stroke (here up and down.)
<p>
   This basic type of pump might be used for Air Pumps, Feed Pumps for the furnace, Fire, Bilge, and Fuel Oil Service.  All might rely on this fundamental pump.
<p>
   The <a href="/pumpglos/duplexpu.htm">DUPLEX PUMP</a> is similar to the Simplex pump, having two pistons instead of one, providing smoother operation.  From the outside a simplex pump can take many forms but the basic concept follows this illustration.

<h3> Squeeze Bulb </h3>
<p>
   Squeeze bulb pumps are often found on blood pressure cuffs.
<p>
   In a blood pressure cuff air is pumped in first, before any measurements are taken.  Then a needle valve is slightly opened and air is allowed to escape while the pressure is read from a sphygmomanometer (or sphygmometer).
<p>
   Here, the air intake is on the right side of the drawing and the tube connects to the blood pressure cuff which is strapped to the patient's arm (not shown.)
<p>
   In this squeeze bulb the valves are just rubber flapper valves like those used in many fish tank diaphragm air pumps.  Other valve configurations are possible.

<h3> Star Pump </h3>
<p>
  The STAR PUMP consists of a rotating star shaped gear inside of another gear.  The inner gear has one less tooth than the outer gear.
<p>
  The inner gear is usually the drive gear and pushes the outer, larger gear around.  A tight fit where the gears mesh keeps fluid advancing around the pump.
<p>
  In this drawing the dark kidney-shaped hole on the right is the intake and the one on the left is the outlet.  As the teeth on the two gears separate the suction draws in the liquid.
<p>
  This pump is best used for pumping lubricating fluids such as oil because the teeth must rub against each other somewhat.  The amount of rubbing is slight but not insignificant.
<p>
  Star pumps are also called GEROTOR PUMPS and the gears are called gerotor gears.

<h3> Sucker Rod Pump </h3>
<p>
   The Sucker Rod Pump brings underground oil to the earth's surface.  It is driven by a motor which turns a flywheel with a crank arm.
<p>
   Attached to the crank arm is a Pitman Arm which in turn, attaches to the Walking Beam.  At the other end of the walking beam is the Horsehead.
<p>
   The Hanger Cable hangs off the Horsehead, and is attached with a clamp to a Polished Rod, which goes through a Stuffing Box and is attached to the Rod String.
<p>
   At the bottom of the well a Traveling Valve, often just a ball in a cage, is attached to the Plunger (shown in green) at the end of the Rod String.  Below that is another ball in a cage, called a Standing Valve.
<p>
   This pump can lift oil 10,000 feet or more!

<p>
<h3> Swash Plate Pump </h3>
<p>
   Swash plate pumps have a rotating cylinder containing pistons.  A spring pushes the pistons against a stationary swash plate, which sits at an angle to the cylinder.
<p>
   The pistons suck in fluid during half a revolution and push fluid out during the other half.
<p>
   Shown on edge on the far right in the animation is a dark stationary disk. It contains two semi-circular ports.  It is shown again in a head-on view below, right.
<p>
   These ports allow the pistons to draw in fluid as they move toward the swash plate (on the backside and not shown here) and discharge it as they move away.
<p>
   For a given speed swash plate pumps can be of fixed displacement like this one, or variable by having a variable swash plate angle.  The greater the slant the further the pistons move and the more fluid they transfer.
<p>
   Note similarities to, and differences from, the <a href="/pumpglos/wobble.htm">wobble pump</a>, <a href="/pumpglos/radialpi.htm">radial piston pump</a>, and <a href="/pumpglos/bentaxis.htm">bent axis pump</a>.

<h3> Tire Pump </h3>
<p>
   A bicycle tire pump works just like any other simple force pump such as a bilge pump or lift pump.
<p>
   There is a valve blocking the flow of air out of the pump to the atmosphere while on the downstroke, and another valve stopping the flow of air from the tire to the pump cylinder during the upstroke.
<p>
   Tire pumps come in a huge variety of shapes and styles but this is one of the most common varieties.
<p>
   Some modern bicycle pumps deliver air on both the downstroke and the upstroke by having an additional set of valves.  This reduces the time it takes to fill the tire.

<h3> Turbine Pump </h3>
<p>
   Turbine pumps typically have a high head and high discharge pressure for their size and speed.  It is not uncommon for turbine pumps to produce heads over 1000 feet, at relatively low RPM compared with other pumps.
<p>
   This high head from a single rotating impeller is caused by the unique operation of the pump.
<p>
   As fluid goes from intake to discharge (in just under one revolution) it circulates around and around as shown in the lower (side view) drawing.  Each time it passes the turbine blades (shown in gray) it gains additional pressure.
<p>
   For relatively low flow rates this pump is often more efficient than a comparably-sized centrifugal pump.
<p>
   This pump is commonly used for clean fluids of low viscosity because of the close tolerances needed between the blades of the turbine and the casing,

<h3> Tympanum Drum </h3>
<p>
   A Tympanum is basically just a sectioned cylinder which is rotated.  It has a number of pie-slice shaped chambers, each of which has an intake hole at the outer edge and an outlet hole near the center.
<p>
   The outer slot or hole is on the leading edge in the direction the cylinder is rotated. When the leading edge dips into the water, the section fills and when it rises out of the water the hole is above the water line.
<p>
   As the cylinder rotates the liquid sloshes to the center and empties out the center hole.
<p>
   Tympanums were used in ancient Greece and have been used throughout the world for thousands of years.  They might be powered by horses or humans or even by the force of a stream from which the pump takes its water.

<h3> Vacuum Pump </h3>
<p>
   A vacuum pump removes air from a container to create a vacuum.  Force pumps of many types are used for vacuum pumps including Rotary pumps and Piston pumps.
<p>
   This vacuum pump is a piston pump.  With each cycle it removes a smaller number of air molecules until it just keeps up with what is leaking in past the joints and valve seats.
<p>
   The amount of vacuum at that point depends on the quality of the components -- how fast the valves close, how tight the seals are, etc.

<h3> Vane Pump </h3>
<p>
   A very common type of pump, this is one of many variations.
<p>
   Power steering units often rely on a vane pump to obtain the pressure needed for the Power Cylinder.  Automatic transmissions often use them too.
<p>
   The vanes are in slots in the rotor.  When the rotor spins, centrifugal force pushes the vanes out to touch the casing, where they trap and propel fluid.  Sometimes springs also push the vanes outward.
<p>
   When the vanes reach the return side they are pushed back into the rotor by the casing.  Fluid escapes through a channel or groove cut into the casing, shown here on the lower right side in black.
<p>
   On this vane pump there is considerable unbalanced force on the drive shaft, since the high-pressure, outlet area is all on one side.  Vane pumps can be designed in balanced configurations where there are two inlet and two outlet ports, similar to <a href="/pumpglos/gear_bal.htm">balanced gear pumps</a>.

<h3> Supersoaker 100 (tm) Watergun </h3>
<p>
   The Larami Corporation of Philadelphia, PA patented an ingenious new type of watergun.  It uses a high-pressure reservoir partially filled with air under pressure.  This HYDRAULIC ACCUMULATOR had never been used in toy waterguns before.
<p>
   A hand-operated piston forces first air, then water into the high-pressure reservoir (the circular ball.)  Pulling the trigger releases a stream that can go 50 feet!
<p>
   The trigger is a spring-loaded pincher which holds the vinyl tube shut.  If you pump too much, pressure opens the trigger-valve and water dribbles out the nozzle, long before the high-presssure areas would burst.

<h1> Population </h1>
<a href="/statglos/statglos.htm"><IMG ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=10 WIDTH=104 HEIGHT=27 SRC="/pics/icons/statglo4.gif" ALT=""> From the Internet Glossary of Statistical Terms </a>
<p>
<hr>
Statisticians define a population as the entire collection of items that is the focus of concern.  The branch of Statistics called Descriptive Statistics, provides us with ways to describe the characteristics of a given population by measuring each of its items and then summarizing the set of measures in various ways. 
<p>
The branch of Statistics called Inferential Statistics consists of procedures to make educated inferences about the characteristics of a population by drawing a random sample and appropriately analyzing the information it provides. 
<p>
A population can be of any size and while the items need not be uniform, the items must share at least one measurable feature.   For example here is a population of 9 persons. While no two of the persons are identical  they have many features in common.  Each of the persons in this population has a weight, a height, a hat size and a shoe size, among many other potential features. The set of 9 measurements of any one of these features would, in statistical terms, be defined as a population. 
<p>
The critical difference between a population and a sample, is that with a population our interest is to identify its characteristics whereas with a sample, our interest  is to make inferences about the characteristics of the population from which the sample was drawn. 
<p>
It is noteworthy that while the illustrated population is fairly small, it contains only 9 items, a different population might be extremely large,  It might, for example, consist of all of the persons in a given city, country, planet, or even universe.

A histogram is a way of graphically showing the characteristics of the distribution of items in a given population or sample.   Here is a histogram of the measures of height in the illustrated population.  In a histogram each measure is represented by a single block that is placed over the midpoint of the class interval into which the measure falls.

<hr>
The mean is one of several indices of central tendency that statisticians use to indicate the point on the scale of measures where the population is centered.
<p>
The mean is the average of the scores in the population. Numerically, it equals the sum of the scores divided by the number of scores.  It is of interest that the mean is the one value which, if substituted for every score in a population, would yield
the same sum as the original scores, and hence it would yield the same mean.
<p>
This illustration shows a population of 9 persons. It also shows the height of each person as well as the formula and calculations of the mean of the population.  As is customary, we have used the Greek letter mu to represent the mean of a population.

<p>
<hr>
The median is one of several indices of central tendency that statisticians use to indicate the point on the scale of measures where the population is centered.  The median of a population is the point that divides the distribution of scores in half.  Numerically, half of the scores in a population will have values that are equal to or larger than the median and half will have values that are equal to or smaller than the median.
<p>
Here is a population of 9 persons arranged in order of their heights. The median height in this population is 62 inches.

The mode is one of several measures of central tendency that statisticians use to indicate the point (or points) on the scale of measures where the population is centered.  It is the score in the population that occures most frequently.  Please notice that the mode is not the frequency of the most numerous score. It is the value of that score itself.  
<p>
Also notice that if there are two (or more) different scores that occur with equal frequency and that frequency is higher than any of the other scores, the population is described as multi-modal.

<title> Random Sample (from Internet Glossary of Statistical Terms)</title>

<body>
<h1> Random Sample </h1>
<a href="/statglos/statglos.htm"><IMG ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=10 WIDTH=104 HEIGHT=27 SRC="/pics/icons/statglo4.gif" ALT=""> From the Internet Glossary of Statistical Terms </a>
<p>
<hr>
In statistical terms a random sample is a set of items that have been drawn from a population in such a way that each time an item was selected, every item in the population had an equal opportunity to appear in the sample.  In practical terms, it is not so easy to draw a random sample.  First, the only factor operating when a given item is selected, must be chance. 
<p>
If, for example, numbered pieces of cardboard are drawn from a hat, it is important that they be thoroughly mixed, that they be identical in every respect except for the number printed on them and that the person selecting them be well blindfolded.
<p>
Second in order to meet the equal opportunity requirement, it is important that the sampling be done with replacement. That is, each time an item is selected,  the relevant measure is taken and recorded. Then the item must be replaced in the population and be thoroughly mixed with the other items before the next item is drawn. If the items are not replaced in the population, each time an item is withdrawn, the probability of being selected, for each of the remaining items, will have been increased. 
<p>
For example, with the illustrated population, the initial probability that a given item will be selected is 1/9. If, however, an item is drawn and not returned before drawing a second item, the probability that a given item will be drawn will have been increased to 1/8.  Of course, this kind of change in probability becomes trivial if our population is very large, but it is important to recognize the principle illustrated here, to fully understand the concept of a random sample.
<p>
It is also important to recognize that when sampling with replacement, it is possible for the same item to appear more than once in a sample and it is possible to draw a random sample that is larger than the population from which it came.  Notice also, that it is possible to draw as many random samples as we like from a give population.
The key idea here is that we either sample with replacement or we draw our samples from a population that is so large that the withdrawal of successive items changes probability by an amount that is too small to be of concern.

<hr>
A statistic is a measure on the items in a random sample. Since the only reason to ever draw a random sample is to infer something about the population from which it came, it should be clear that when we calculate a given statistic we only do so in order to estimate a corresponding parameter of the population from which the sample was drawn. An example of a statistic is the mean (i.e. average) of the measures in the sample.  
<p>
As indicated by the central limit theorem, the mean of a random sample can be used to estimate of the mean of the population from which the sample was taken.

The mean of a random sample is an unbiased estimate of the mean of the population from which it was drawn.  Another way to say this is to assert that regardless of the size of the population and regardless of the size of the random sample, it can be shown (through The Central Limit Theorem) that if we repeatedly took random samples of the same size from the same population, the sample means would cluster around the exact value of the population mean. 
<p>
As illustrated here, our random sample contains 4 items and it was drawn from a population that contains 9 items. Most statisticians use (n) to represent the number of items in a sample, whereas they use the symbol (N) to represent the number of items in a population. For this sample from this population n=4, N=9.

<h1> Sampling Distribution </h1>

<p>
<hr>
The Sampling Distribution of a statistic is the set of values that we would obtain if we drew an infinite number of random samples from a given population and calculated the statistic on each sample.  While it is not possible for anyone to actually  draw an infinite number of samples,  the concept of a sampling distribution can be understood by taking the time to carefully consider the following theoretical exercise. 
<p>
Imagine that our population consists of only three numbers: the number 2, the number 3 and the number 4. Our plan is to draw an infinite number of random samples of size  n = 2  and form a sampling distribution of the sample means.  The accompanying illustration shows this population and it's first two columns show each of the possible random samples (of size n = 2), that might be drawn from this population.  
If the first item is a 2, the second item can be either a 2 again, or it can be a 3 or a 4. Remember!, we are drawing a random sample and our population is small,  hence we are sampling with replacement.  If our first item happened to be a 3, the second item might be a 2, a 3 again, or a 4 and if our first item happened to be a 4 the second item could be either a 2 or a 3 or a 4 again. 
<p>  
As seen here, there are only 9 possible combinations of two numbers in a given sample and each of the combinations is equally likely. The same is not true, however, for the means of the samples. 
<p>  
The third column in the illustration shows the means of each of the possible samples and the histogram shows the relative frequency of each of these means. In doing so the histogram provides a detailed representation of the sampling distribution of means (of size n = 2) that would be obtained if we were, in fact, able to draw an infinite number of random samples from the indicated population and graphically represent their frequency distribution in a histogram.

<title>  Central Limit Theorem (from Internet Glossary of Statistical Terms)</title>

<h1> Central Limit Theorem </h1>
<a href="/statglos/statglos.htm"><IMG ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=10 WIDTH=104 HEIGHT=27 SRC="/pics/icons/statglo4.gif" ALT=""> From the Internet Glossary of Statistical Terms </a>
<p>
<hr>
The Central Limit Theorem is a statement about the characteristics of the sampling distribution of means of random samples from a given population.  That is, it describes the characteristics of the distribution of values we would obtain if we were able
to draw an infinite number of random samples of a given size from a given population and we calculated the mean of each sample.
<p>
The Central Limit Theorem consists of three statements:
<p>
[1] The mean of the sampling distribution of means is equal to the mean of the population from which the samples were drawn.
<p>
[2] The variance of the sampling distribution of means is equal to the variance of the population from which the samples were drawn divided by the size of the samples.
<p>
[3] If the original population is distributed normally (i.e. it is bell shaped), the sampling distribution of means will also be normal. If the original population is not normally distributed, the sampling distribution of means will increasingly 
approximate a normal distribution as sample size increases.  (i.e. when increasingly large samples are drawn)
<p>
The accompanying figure illustrates the statements of the central limit theorem both algebraically and graphically.

In statistics the transformation rules describe the changes in the mean, variance and standard deviation of a distribution when every item in a distribution is either increased or decreased by a constant amount. These rules also describe the changes in the mean, variance  and standard deviation of a distribution when every item in the distribution is either multiplied or divided by a constant amount.  
<p>
<b>Transformation rule (1):</b>     Adding a constant to every item in a distribution adds  the constant to the mean of the distribution, but it leaves the variance and standard deviation, unchanged.
<p>
<b>Transformation rule (2):</b>     Multiplying every item in a distribution by a constant multiplies the mean and standard deviation of that distribution by the constant and it multiplies the variance of the distribution by the square of the constant.

<p>
<hr>
Z scores are a special application of the transformation rules.  The z score for an item, indicates how far and in what direction, that item deviates from its distribution's mean, expressed in units of its distribution's standard deviation.  The mathematics of the z score transformation are such  that if every item in a distribution is converted to its z score, the transformed scores will necessarily have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one.  
<p>
Z scores are sometimes called "standard scores".  The z score transformation is especially useful when seeking to compare the relative standings of items from distributions with different means and/or different standard deviations. 
<p>
Z scores are especially informative when the distribution to which they refer, is normal.  In every normal distribution, the distance between the mean and a given Z score cuts off a fixed proportion of the total area under the curve.  Statisticians have provided us with tables indicating the value of these proportions for each possible Z score.

<p>
<hr>
A statistical test is a procedure for deciding whether an assertion ( e.g. an Hypothesis ) about a quantitative feature of a population is true or false.  We test an hypothesis of this sort by drawing a random sample from the population in question and calculating an appropriate statistic on its items.  If, in doing so, we obtain a value of the statistic that would occure rarely when the hypothesis is true, we would have reason to reject the hypothesis. 
<p>
With this procedure it is customary to reject  the hypothesis tested  when our statistic has a value that is among those that, theoretically, would be expected to occure no more than 5 out of every 100 times that a random sample (of the same size) is drawn from the population in question when the hypothesis is, in fact,  true.   Much of the text of this tutorial is devoted to explanations of  exactly how this kind of theoretical expectation is developed.  
<p>
Finally, it is noteworthy that the appropriate conduct of any statistical test invariably requires many thoughtful decisions. It is, for example, always necessary to decide what statistic to use, what  sample size to employ and what criteria to establish for rejection of the hypothesis tested.

The null hypothesis is a term that statisticians often use to indicate the statistical hypothesis tested. The purpose of  most statistical tests, is to determine if the obtained results provide a reason to reject the hypothesis that they are merely a product of chance factors.  
For example, in an experiment in which two groups of randomly selected subjects have received different treatments and have yielded different means, it is always necessary to ask if the difference between the obtained means is among the differences that would be expected to occure by chance whenever two groups are randomly selected.  In this example, the hypothesis tested is that the two samples are from populations with the same mean. 
Another way to say this is to assert that the investigator tests the null hypothesis that the difference between the means of the populations from which the samples were drawn, is zero.  If the difference between the means of the samples is among those that would occure rarely by chance when the null hypothesis is true, the null hypothesis is rejected and the investigator describes the results as statistically significant, implying that they are a product of the treatments.

A finding (for example the observed difference between the means of two random samples) is described as statistically significant, when it can be demonstrated  that the probability of obtaining such a difference by chance only, is relatively low.  
In Psychology, and in many other domains, it is customary to describe one's finding as statistically significant, when the obtained result is among those that (theoretically) would occur no more than 5 out of 100 times when the only factors operating are the chance variations that occur whenever random samples are drawn.

<hr>
Statisticians use the Greek letter alpha to indicate the probability of rejecting the statistical hypothesis tested when in fact, that hypothesis is true.  Before conducting any statistical test, it is important to establish a value for alpha.  For most psychologists, and for many other scientists, it is customary to set  alpha at  0.05.  
<p>
This is the equivalent of asserting that you will reject the hypothesis tested if the obtained statistic is among those that would occure only 5 out of 100 times that random samples are drawn from a population in which the hypothesis is true.  If your  obtained statistic leads you to reject the hypothesis tested, it's not because you believe that the obtained statistic could not have occurred by chance.  
<p>
Its that you are asserting that the odds of obtaining that statistic by chance only are sufficiently low ( one out of twenty), that it reasonable to conclude that your results are not due to chance.  Could you be in error? Of course you could, but at least you know the probability of such an error. It is exactly equal to the value you have previously established for alpha.

Statisticians use the Greek letter beta to indicate the probability of failing to reject the hypothesis tested when that hypothesis is false and a specific alternative hypothesis is true. For a given test, the value of beta is determined by the previously elected value of alpha, certain features of the statistic that is being calculated (particularly the sample size) and the specific alternative hypothesis that is being entertained. 
While it is possible to carry out a statistical test without entertaining a specific alternative hypothesis, neither beta nor power can be calculated if  there is no specific alternative hypothesis. It is relevant to note here that power ( the probability that the test will reject  the hypothesis tested when a specific alternative hypothesis is true ) is always equal to one minus beta.   ( i.e.   Power = 1 -  beta )

For a statistician, the power of a test is the probability that the test will reject the hypothesis tested when a specific alternative hypothesis is true.  To calculate the power of a given test it is necessary to specify alpha (the probability that the test will lead to the rejection of the hypothesis tested when that hypothesis is true) and to specify a specific alternative hypothesis.

The F test employs the statistic (<b>F</b>) to test various statistical 
hypotheses about the mean (or means) of the distributions from which a 
sample or a set of samples have been drawn.  It is noteworthy that as

With any set of items (for example the population of 9 persons we have discussed elsewhere) we could, if we chose to,  measure more than one feature, We could, for example, measure each persons weight as well as their height. The population of paired numbers would be described as related measures provided that we always knew which weight was related to which height. That is, we always associated the weight of a given person with that same person's height.

<hr>
Given a pair of related measures (X and Y) on each of a set
of items, the correlation coefficient (r) provides an index of
the degree to which the paired measures co-vary in a linear
fashion. In general r will be positive when items with large
values of X also tend to have large values of Y whereas items
with small values of X tend to have small values of Y.
Correspondingly, r will be negative when Items with large values
of X tend to have small values of Y whereas items with small
values of X tend to have large values of Y. The value of r is
calculated by first converting the Xs and Ys into their
respective Z Scores and, keeping track of which Z Score goes with
which item, determining the value of the mean Z Score product.
Numerically, r can assume any value between -1 and +1 depending
upon the degree of the relationship. Plus and minus one indicate
perfect positive and negative relationships whereas zero
indicates that the X and Y values do not co-vary in any linear
fashion.

<hr>
Given a pair of related measures ( X and Y ) on each of a set of items, the term 
"regression" is used to characterize the manner in which one of the measures (for example the Y measures) change as the other measure ( in this case, the X measure) changes.  For any set of related measures, it is possible to specify a line that approximates the mean of the Y measures for those items with a given X measure. By revealing how the mean of the Y measures change as the various X measures change, this line is understood to describe the regression of Y on X.  
<p>
It is noteworthy that for the same set of related measures there is always a second regression line that describes the regression of X on Y.

<p>
<hr>
In a well designed  psychology experiment an investigator will randomly assign subjects to two or more groups and except for differences in the experimental procedure applied to each group, the groups will be treated exactly alike.  Under these circumstances any differences between the groups that are statistically significant 
are attributed to differences in the treatment conditions. This, of course assumes that  except for the various treatment conditions the groups were, in fact, treated exactly alike. Unfortunately, however, It is always possible that despite an experimenters best intentions there was  some unsuspected systematic differences in the way the groups were treated in addition to the intended treatment conditions.  
Statisticians describe systematic differences of this sort as confounding factors or confounding variables.  
<p>
If, for example, subjects in one group are simultaniously tested in a room with the heat set at 70 degrees whereas subjects in another group are simultaniously tested in a nearby identically appointed room with the heat set at 60 degrees, the obtained differences in performance could be attributed to any of three factors. It could be due to the random assignment of subjects (i.e. to chance). It could be due to the different temperatures in the two rooms. 
It could, however, be due to some confounding factor such as differences in ambient illumination that result from unnoticed differences in the orientation of each room with respect to the sun.  In any experiment an appropriate statistical test can help in the decision as to whether or not to attribute the results to chance, but only the most careful analysis of the actual conditions of the experiment  can suggest  whether or not  the results might be due to a confounding factor.

<title> How to Run P11 Applications from Windows 95</title>
</header>
<body>
<hr>
<h1> How to run programs written with P11 in Win95 </h1>
<hr>
<a href="/pics/icons/ascologo.gif"><IMG ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=10 WIDTH=32 HEIGHT=14 SRC="/pics/icons/ascolog1.gif" ALT=""></a>
<p>
To Run ALL ABOUT PUMPS and other P11 applications from WINDOWS 95,
you may need to write a <i>shortcut</i> (or 'PIF') file.  This is because although Microsoft
claims to fully support DOS applications, in truth they only give DOS
a small part of a machine and DOS has to explicitly ask WINDOWS for the rest. 
I don't consider that full support, do you?  Janet Reno, are you
listening?
<p>
Also, in machines with less than about 12 Megabytes of EMM or XMS
you may not be able to run our applications without shutting WIN95
down completely and restarting in DOS mode.  This is because WIN95
will not give up enough EMM or XMS without shutting down for our
application to run.  Worse, it may do disk swapping of screen memory
or other memory during execution of our animation routines which
normally run from EMM or XMS, causing delays and jerky animation. 
Please be aware of these things if our animation is not ideal on your
WINDOWS system.  
<p>
This application shows writing a <i>shortcut</i> (or 'PIF') for ALL ABOUT PUMPS. 
Shortcuts for other "P11" applications can be written essentially the same way, but with different memory requests. 
Many P11 applications use less than 1 megabyte EMM or XMS.  When this
is the case you normally should be able to simply run the application from
WINDOWS 95.  You would not need a shortcut.
<p>
<br>
<b>WINDOWS 95 STEPS TO WRITE A SHORTCUT FOR "P11"</b>
<br>
This explanation assumes you have already downloaded and unzipped the P11 application of your choice.  Also, it assumes you have some familiarity with WIN95.  Lastly, we cannot assume any responsibility for WIN95 problems.  Please call Microsoft FIRST if you need to learn how to start DOS applications from WIN95.
<br>
First, click your right mouse button (mouse button #2) on a blank background part of your Win95 screen.  
<p>
A new menu should appear with the following choices, approximately:
<br>
<b>
Arrange Icons
<br>
Line up Icons
<br>
Paste
<br>
Paste shortcut
<br>
New
<br>
Properties
</b>
<br>
You want to choose NEW because you're going to make a new shortcut.
Click your left mouse button (button #1) on NEW.  
<p>
A new menu should appear with the following choices, approximately:
<br>
<b>
Folder
<br>
Shortcut
<br>
Wave Sound
<br>
Bitmap Image
<br>
Text Document
<br>
WordPad Document
<br>
Briefcase
</b>
<br>
You want to choose Shortcut because that's what you're creating a NEW one of.
Click your left mouse button (button #1) on Shortcut.  
<p>
A new screen should appear saying, approximately:
<br>
Type the location and name of the item you want to create a shortcut
to.  Or search for the item by clicking Browse.
<br>
You want to type the path and name of the batch file that runs the
application you choose.  For example, to run ALL ABOUT PUMPS, you
would normally have placed the program in the \P11\PUMPS directory. 
If it is on the C: drive, you would type:
<br>
c:\p11\pumps\pumps.bat
<br>
and press <b>ENTER</b>.
<br>
A new option will appear:
<br>
<b>
Select a name for the shortcut.
</b>
<br>
This option can be anything you want, for example:
<br>
All About Pumps
<br>
One of the buttons at the bottom of this window will be
<b>FINISH</b>.  You are finished with this step, so click on
FINISHED.
<br>
<hr>
<br>
A new icon should appear on your screen called ALL ABOUT PUMPS.  
<br>
Click your right mouse button (button #2) on this new icon.
<br>
A new menu should appear with the following choices, approximately:
<br>
<b>
<br>
Open
<br>
Send To
<br>
Cut
<br>
Copy
<br>
Create Shortcut
<br>
Delete
<br>
Rename
<br>
Properties
<br>
</b>
<br>
Click your left mouse button (button #1) on PROPERTIES.  This should
bring up a window called <B> ALL ABOUT PUMPS Properites</b>.
<br>
The subwindow titled GENERAL should be on top, now.  You do not need
to change anything in GENERAL.  Instead, click you left mouse button
(button #1) on <b>Program</b> to bring that subwindow to the top.
<br>
On this page, you will see several lines you can modify.  First is
the <b>Cmd line</b>.  It should have the directory and batch file
already listed.  For this example, that would be:
<BR>
 C:\P11\PUMPS\PUMPS.BAT
<BR>
You can add the option /Q to the Cmd Line if you
like, this will skip the introductory batch file screen all our
programs normally start with, and let you go right into the P11
application.
<br>
The next line on this page should say <b>Working</b>. This should
have the directory structure (c:\P11\PUMPS in this example) for the CMD LINE above it, but without
the batch file name (PUMPS.BAT in this example.)  You normally
shouldn't need to touch this line.
<br>
The next line, <b>batch file</b> can be left blank for P11 applications.
<br>
The <b>Shortcut Key</b> is next.  It should say <b>None</b> and can remain that way.
<br>
The last line should say <b>Run</b>. You can pick from three options here:
<br>
<b>
Normal Window
<br>
Minimized
<br>
Maximized
</b>
<br>
Minimized is not correct, but either other option seems to work.  It may not make any difference, but Maximized is probably correct.
<br>
You can click on <b>Change Icon</b> now if you like.  We  plan to supply Win95 Icons soo, but right now you can choose a stock icon from Win95 if you like.
<br>
Next, click on <b>Advanced</b>.
<br>
A new window will appear called the <b>Advanced Program Settings</b> window.  We have tried several combinations but the
default, <b>Prevent MS-DOS-based programs from detecting Windows</b>
seems to work fine.  <b>Suggest MS-DOS mode as necessary</b> works as well,
as does <b>MS-DOS mode</b>.  If you choose MS-DOS MODE (the third
choice) you can the choose additional options, which may be
appropriate to your situation.  (You'll hopefully know if you need
these things.)
<br>
Click on <b>OK</b> to close the <b>Advanced Program Settings</b> window.
<br>
Now, you should be back at the Program page of the ALL ABOUT PUMPS
Properties screen.  You can leave the page <b>FONT</b> alone in most
cases.  Click on <b>MEMORY</b> which is to the right of FONTS.
<br>
A page should come up with several MEMORY options.  Here, the
requirements vary a little for each application.  In general, though,
you will need to give the P11 application at least 560K of
<b>conventional memory</b> (sometimes 512 or even less is enough for
some applications.)
<br>
<b>Initial Environment</b> can be left set to AUTO.
<br>
<b>Protected</b> should probably be checked, as far as we can tell.
<br>
For <b>Expanded (EMS) Memory</b> you should check NONE if you are
using XMS memory, or specify the amount if you are using EMS.  P11
will use either type but not both.  It will use the one it finds
first that has enough available, but for speed, EMS is probably the
better choice.  However, it may not make any difference and either
will suffice.  The amount to specify depends on the P11 application's
needs but if you specify 1024K of either EMS or XMS, your P11
application should be able to load.  It will normally tell you if it
needs more memory.  For ALL ABOUT PUMPS, you should give it at least
2800K of EMS or XMS memory.  4096K (4 megs) is preferred for ALL ABOUT PUMPS.
<br>
If you have not used EMS memory, then use XMS instead which is listed
next.  You can set XMS to NONE if you use EMS memory, and vice-versa.
<br>
For <b>MS-DOS protected-mode (DPM) memory</b> we leave in on AUTO but
we're not sure what this does.  WIN95's own help on the subject is useless.
<br>
We are done with the MEMORY page.  Move to the right and click on the
<b>SCREEN</B> page.  Here, the first option is <b>USAGE</b>.  Click
on <b>Full Screen</b>.  You can leave <b>Initial Size</b> as Default.
<br>
Below that is WINDOW.  Both options can be checked, <b>Display
Toolbar</b> and <b>Restore Settings on startup</b>.
Following through the list of options, here are suggested entries:
<br>
Below that is PERFORMANCE.  <b>Fast Rom emulation</b> can be checked.
<br>
As far as we can test, the box for </b>Dynamic memory allocation</b> can be checked or left unchecked.
<br>
We are finished with the SCREEN page.
<br>
The last page is MISC.  Click on MISC and it will bring up the final
page for the <B>ALL ABOUT PUMPS Properties</b> window.
<br>
The first option on this page is Foreground.  You can allow or disallow the screensaver.
<br>
The next option is Mouse.  Leave both options there blank, <b>QuickEdit</b> and <b>Exclusive Mode</b>.
<br>
The next option is Background.  We checked <b>Always Suspend</b>.
<br>
The next option is Termination.  We checked <b>Warn if still active</b>.
<br>
The next option is Idle Sensitivity.  We didn't touch it, but if anything, <b>low</b> is probably correct since NONE doesn't seem to be an option.
<br>
The next option is Other.  We recommend leaving this off.
<br>
The final options are <b>Windows Shortcut Keys</b>.  No need to mess with them at all, so you're done.
<p>
Now double-click on the new icon and your "P11" application should
run just fine!
<br>
To exit P11 properly, use the <b>ESCAPE</b> key followed by "y" or, in all
our newer programs, ALT-Q (quit) will exit immediately to DOS.
<br>
<b>Please contact us if you have any problems running any P11 application from within Windows or WIN 95.  But please contact Microsoft if you need to learn more about Windows. Thank you.</b>
