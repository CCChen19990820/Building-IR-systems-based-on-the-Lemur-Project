<H2>Berkeley Resident Visits Sister 'City'
<BR> Indigenous Rainforest Community
In Sarawak, Malaysia</H2> 

<P>by Anushka Drescher</P>

<P>
 Judith Mayer, a member of the Borneo Project, the
citizens group maintaining a Sister City relationship with the village of
Uma-Bawang, Malaysia, sent a riveting account of her visit to this Kayan village
on the Baram River three months ago. The following passages are excerpts from
her letter to the members of the Borneo Project. Judith is presently living in Indonesia,
doing research as part of her UC Berkeley doctoral program in City and Regional
Planning. An October, 1993, article in Terrain described Uma Bawang's struggle
against the indiscriminate logging of indigenous lands and the work of The Borneo Project.</P>

<HR>

<H2>Judith describes the first stages of the journey to Uma Bawang</H2> 

<P>November 3, 1993</P>

<P>
 Dear Friends,</P>

<P>
 I just got back from Sarawak last night, and want to write to you right away
while things are still fresh. It was an amazing trip. I fell in love with Uma
Bawang/Keluan (more on the name later), and was very moved by the &quot;Hari
Pahlawan&quot; festivities. I'm quite convinced that it's important for Berkeley
to be &quot;sister city&quot; to these folks and that, given politics in Sarawak
and Malaysia as a whole, this is one of the more effective things we can do to
help. It's good moral support, and the mutual nature of this kind of gesture
makes it a different kind of symbolic statement than many from outsiders in
support of both native land rights and forests of Borneo.</P>

<P>

</P>

<H2>Judith describes various events that took place on the day of her arrival,
as well as dinner and dancing that evening.</H2> 

<P>Around 3:00 in the afternoon we started passing signs, in English + Malay: &quot;Keluan&quot;,
&quot;Nursery&quot;, then we passed a tiny Kubota tractor pulling a cart full of
people laughing and waving, then bamboo fences and more signs: &quot;Communal
Garden&quot; and &quot;Communal Nursery.&quot; I figured we had arrived, and
sure enough, lurching around a sharp turn, the driver honked the horn, and on
the other side of a huge fish pond with an airy pavilion in the middle was a
low, galvanized-roofed longhouse with people lining its entire 400-foot
wood-curl-decorated balcony. And a racket of gongs and drums -- to welcome us!
We stumbled out of the car, and a crowd of people (the welcoming committee)
steered us toward a table with a guest book, which everyone signed, then told
everyone who would be their hosts. Hosts would be responsible for feeding them
at communal mealtimes in the open gallery running the entire length of the
longhouse over the next few days... Lots of rowdy greetings among people who
hadn't seen each other for months or years. And suddenly the guys I'd come in
the car with weren't just a bunch of scruffy strangers, but leading native
rights activists with families and histories and politics, representing
communities from all over Sarawak.</P>

<P>
 Someone pushed me toward the stairs in the middle of the longhouse... and at
the top a line of older Dayak men shook my hands, told me their names, I told
them mine, and that I'm from Berkeley. &quot;AH, Berkeley!&quot; repeated again
and again as the gongs and drums moved toward the end of the longhouse.</P>

<P>
 ...Programs had begun the previous evening, with a welcoming meal, performances
by Uma Bawang people, and &quot;reports&quot; from guests representing other
longhouses and communities about the latest threats they were encountering to
the integrity of their land and forest rights, and how they were dealing with
them.</P>

<P>
 ...I took off for &quot;Warriors' Day&quot; not knowing what to expect, not
entirely sure why I was going (it felt right!), and not even clear on where I
was going. The speeches and performances, as well as the opportunity to talk to
activists from all over Sarawak during the next couple of days certainly cleared
all of that up.</P>

<P>
 People used the Bahasa Malaysia name &quot;Hari Pahlawan,&quot; which means
something closer to &quot;Heroes' Day&quot; than &quot;Warriors Day.&quot; And
it became clear that this festive occasion was actually a strategizing
convention among members of loosely-linked communities who've been struggling to
protect their land rights and forests since the late 1980s.'...`the new
longhouse at Uma Bawang is probably the safest and most hospitable place in
Sarawak to have such a getting together.</P>

<P>
 ...And the new village is working. People seem prosperous and healthy'...`and
intensely proud of what they're doing. There's a real sense of pioneering and
purpose in this village, which is especially exciting for me, having spent so
much time in Dayak villages that are demoralized, unsanitary, fatalistic,
disempowered, and debilitated. The new village's pride comes through in the way
the kids and women show off, and the way men and women speak up and perform at
the drop of a hat'...`There's a real spirit of humor, affection, and hopefulness
that colors how people talk about their struggle against the injustices coming
from the outside.</P>

<P>
 ...The new longhouse, which some people still call Uma Bawang, but others call
by the name of the river it's built by (Keluan), has also taken on a central
role in opposing not only the timber concessions and reckless logging on Dayak
indigenous land, but also the massive new plantation schemes the government is
pushing in the logged-over areas. They make no bones about calling both theft.
Keluan is one of the few non-Penan communities that speaks with a unified voice
in these matters, partly because the community receives no government aid, other
than access to the state school at the old village, and to the state dispensary
about an hour down the Baram from it.'</P>

<P>

</P>

<H2> Then...</H2> 

<P>`The next day started early, with breakfast along the gallery as people
wandered down to the river for baths. By 4:00 in the morning the Uma Bawang
women had been up cooking for the crowd. Just after 8:00 a processions began,
more drums and loudspeaker, decorated by a Borneo traditional costumes and
banners proclaiming native land rights themes from many of the groups who'd
come. It was choreographed -- but for the benefit of its participants, not an
audience! Older men in loincloths and tattoos showing off nimble moves of
graceful fight-dances, the most daring rewarded by the crowd's enthusiastic
hoots and hunting guns shot into the air. Virtually all of the Uma Bawang
teenagers and older women were there in traditional dress, and eventually the
whole procession ended at the village's meeting place, a corrugated metal roof
over a large wood floor and porch, with raised portions at either end for seats.
THe costumed women took places at one end, and the crowd of Penan, many having
walked for days through the forest to get to this occasion, took the places of
honor at the other end, leaning on their blowpipes. Music switched to Sape, a
Kayan instrument like a 4-stringed guitar, and the meeting, dancing and
performances resumed, continuing with breaks only for meals...and the hottest
part of the afternoon, when most people napped, but some went to look at the
village's nursery and communal garden.'</P>

<P>

</P>

<H2>Later...</H2> 

<P>`As the rain let up enough to hear a nearby conversation, it also gave me a
chance to interview some of the Penan contingent at the celebration, with
translations from Penan into Malay by the President of the Penan association,
which was formed after the 1987 blockades...Unlike longhouse Dayaks, who
practice shifting cultivation mainly in secondary forest successions, the Penan
way of life depends almost exclusively on their freedom of movement in expansive
old growth forest. The Penan don't traditionally cultivate rice, vegetables, or
cash crops -- they're some of tropical Asia's last real hunter-gatherers. Their
means of subsistence, and cash income (mostly from rattan crafts and collecting
other forest products) comes almost exclusively from ancient forests which,
until recently, covered most of Sarawak's eastern highlands. The Penan don't
benefit from the logging companies' roads, nor do they work for the companies or
sell them vegetables or other agricultural produce. The Penan, at this point,
are also among only a few groups that are still maintaining any blockades of
logging roads, although the effort has exhausted their resources. And they are
primary victims of the mounting violence of the logging companies in suppressing
opposition to their activities. Police and company thugs are now cooperating to
suppress anti-logging demonstrations, and have begun using gas bombs -- either
tear gas or mace, it's not clear. Far from modern medical care, and with little
understanding of how to great gas victims, Penan children caught in the gas have
suffered permanent injury, and one child has died...As I was talking with about
6 Penan in a house at the far end of the longhouse, and officious looking guy
pushed his way in, and demanded to know why I was asking questions and taping
the conversation. He asked if I was a journalist, and didn't quite believe me
when I said no, but that I would let my friends in America hear the tape...</P>

<P>
 ...the Penan people I talked with requested that ... we write to Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohammad (Jabatan Perdana Menteri, Jalan Dato Onn, 50502 Kuala Lumpur,
Malaysia, Fax: 60-3-232 8166) and Chief Minister of Sarawak Taib Mahmud
(Bangunan Tunku Abdul Rahman, Petra Jaya, 93300 Kuching, Sarawak, Malaysia, Fax:
60-82-441 887) to request that a substantial area of old forest be preserved
from logging, with very clearly marked legal borders, and for the use of the
Penan peoples. They also ask...that timber concessions be canceled in these
areas to protect the Penans' means of subsistence.</P>

<H2>What We Do</H2> 

<H3>
<A HREF="workshop.html">Community-based Mapping</A> </H3> 

<P>Maps are a powerful way to document traditional land claims.  They can be used for  both community resource planning and as evidence in legal disputes over land rights.  As Jefferson Fox of the East West Center explains, "Maps are the most effective, legitimate and convincing means available to villagers for demonstrating to outsiders that they manage their natural resources and hence for proving land claims to their customary lands."</P>

<P>
The Borneo Project has been
working with the Uma Bawang Resident's Association and Sabat Alam Malaysia (SAM or Friends of the Earth Malaysia) training indigenous communities how to survey and map
their own lands.  In mid 1995, we conducted a ten day workshop with the people
of Uma Bawang and four other communities. We are now assisting the
workshop participants as they teach other indigenous communities in Borneo how to survey, make and use maps as a tool to gain legal recognition of customary-held land.
</P>

<P>

</P>

<H3>Sustainable Income Generation</H3> 

<P>Uma Bawang has become a model of sustainability. The community has
established a fish pond, fruit orchards, pig and chicken rearing programs, an
agroforestry plot, and organic rice and vegetable fields by incorporating modern adaptations to traditional systems. This year, the Uma
Bawang Residents Association will open a farm store in the town of Miri where
the community will sell its surplus rice and vegetables to raise money for
school fees and health care. In Berkeley, we are working to establish markets
for crafts and other products from Uma Bawang. </P>

<P>

</P>

<H3>Appropriate Technology</H3> 

<P>On our recent trip to Uma Bawang we evaluated the possibilities of
alternative energy resources for the community. We are currently researching solar generators and micro-hydro generators as sustainable alternatives to diesel fuel generators.  We have also introduced a simple solar cooker which enables the women of Uma Bawang,
who do most of the food preparation, to cook without having to gather fuel wood.
</P>

<P>Currently the citizens of Uma Bawang have plans to rebuild their dilapidated longhouse using traditional techniques. One member of the Borneo Project, an environmental engineer, has been working closely with the designers to ensure that maximum efficiency, proper sanitation and ecological integration can be achieved.  If successful, this longhouse will become a model for other longhouses in the region.

</P>

<H3>Outreach & Advocacy</H3> 

<P>One of our most important roles is to educate citizens in the United States about what is happening in Borneo. With a well established network of indigenous leaders, NGO's and concerned citizens we are in a good position to monitor land and human rights issues in Borneo.  To make these issues known we conduct slides shows for the public
and school groups. 
We organize letter writing campaigns when indigenous leaders and communities are
threatened. We publish newsletters and updates and we host monthly pot-luck  discussions focused on current events.</P>

<BODY BGCOLOR="FFFBC0" TEXT="800000">

<H1>The Borneo Connection</H1>

<P>On the Baram River, in the rainforest of Borneo, beneath towering  broadleaf
trees, is a seventy-two-door longhouse called 
<A HREF="visituma.html">Uma Bawang.</A>  Several thousand
miles away, on the other side of the Pacific Ocean, is a small city boarderd on
the east by hills covered with pine and eucalyptus, and on the west by a
waterfront which looks through the Golden Gate.  In 1991, these two communities
were 
<A HREF="mayor.html">united</A> as sister
cities. </P>   

<P>

</B [IMG SRC="woman-basket.gif" ALT="Woman holding
basket" ALIGN="left"]>

Most
of the people of Uma Bawang are Kayans, one of the indigenous tribes of
Borneo who have lived in the rainforest for thousands of years, raising hill rice
and hunting wild boar.  Today the  Kayans are fighting to save the rainforest. 
Logging companies, many owned by relatives of highly placed officials in the
Malaysian Government, are clear-cutting their home, the world's oldest
rainforest, destroying species which have yet to be identified, and greatly
damaging the cultural fabric of the native people.</P>

<P>The people of Uma Bawang are not letting their forest, their way of life, and
their future be bulldozed without a struggle.  Against tremendous odds they are
fighting the logging companies with non-violent, but very assertive means.  They
write formal letters of protest to the government, they file suit in court, and
when all else fails they blockade the logging roads. In the past few years 346
native people have been arrested for forming human blockades.</P>

<P>However, the native people's pleas for the recognition of their human rights
have not been met with the greatest responsivenes in the Malaysian courts. 
They, like the indigenous people of many countries, must rely on the uncertain,
but not entirely impotent court of international public opinion.  In the late
1980s, the Malaysian government considered all environmentalists to be
subversives. Though he had broken no laws, Harrison Ngau, a native leader and
organizer with Friends of the Earth, was kept under house arrest for over a year
because of his environmental activism.  International pressure resulted in his
release, and in 1991 he was elected to the National Parliment as the
representitive of Sarawak, Borneo.</P>

<P>The Borneo Project is committed to fight for similar change.  We are a group
of citizens concerned with the destruction of rainforests and its attendent
destruction of native cultures.  The purpose of our group is to apply the
technques of citizen diplomacy to the arena of environmental politics through 
cultural exchanges, personal contacts, direct support and the power of the media.
We have witnessed the people of Uma Bawang mount a curageous struggle to save
their forest and control their destiny.  The Borneo Project is committed to support them as they now reach out to surrounding communities who face similar struggles. </P>

<H2>Biographical Data - July  1995</H2>



David Ross Brower was born in Berkeley, California on July 1, 1912.  He is the founder and 

Chairman of <STRONG>Earth Island Institute</STRONG> and President of 

<STRONG>Earth Island Action Group</STRONG> and has been in conservation battles 

since 1938 and ecologically concerned since 1926.<P>



Mr. Brower joined the Sierra Club in 1933, became a member of its board of directors in 

1941, and was its first executive director from 1952 to 1969.  He saw the club's membership 

grow from 2,000 to 77,000, and successfully urged the formation of the Sierra Club 

Foundation (in 1960), before leaving the club staff on request in 1969.  He was elected to 

the Sierra Club board again in 1983, 1986, and in 1995.<P>



In 1969 he founded Friends of the Earth, along with the League of Conservation Voters, and 

initiated the founding of independent FOE organizations in other countries.  FOE is now 

multi-national and operating in fifty-three countries.<P>



<CITE>Earth Island Institute</CITE>, <A HREF="brower.html">Brower 

Fund</A>, and biennial <CITE>Fate and Hope of the Earth Conferences</CITE>, all of 

which Mr. Brower founded in 1982, are working to bring peace, environmental, social 

justice, and other groups together to achieve peace on and with the Earth.  Mr. Brower 

recently founded the Global Conservation, Preservation, and Restoration (CPR) Service to 

help catalyze the restoration of natural and human systems.  In 1988 and 1990-92, he led 

delegations to <A HREF="../baikal/baikal.html">Lake Baikal</A> in Siberia at Soviet 

request to aid its protection and restoration.  In the fall of 1994,  he co-founded the 

<CITE>Ecological Council of Americas</CITE> as a network of organizations in the 

Americas focused on problems of environment and economic integration.  Mr. Brower is 

advocating for the creation of a National Biosphere Reserve System, as well as that of a 

National Land Service to replace the current Bureau of Land Management and have a new 

mission of protecting and restoring both public and private lands in the United States.<P>



In civilian climbing and ski mountaineering Mr. Brower made 70 first ascents, summer and 

winter, in Yosemite and the High Sierra, participated in a historic attempt on Mount 

Waddington (Canada), led the first ascent of New Mexico's Shiprock (1939), and trekked to 

18,000 feet in the Himalaya below Mount Everest (1976) and to Thyangboche (1984).  He 

received the First Class Skier award in 1942, and, from 1939 to 1956, in the Sierra Club 

Wilderness Outings Program, he initiated the knapsack, river, and wilderness threshold trips 

and led some 4,000 people into remote wilderness.<P>



<H3>David Brower has twice been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize (1978, 79).</H3>



Comments about his efforts have ranged widely.  John McPhee's <CITE>Encounters With 

the Archdruid</CITE> is about Mr. Brower and three of his natural enemies -- and is in its 

twenty-seventh printing.  Mr. Brower especially likes what Russell Train said when he was 

chairman of the council on Environmental Quality in the Nixon administration:  &quotThank God 

for Dave Brower; he makes it so easy for the rest of us to be reasonable.&quot<P>

<TITLE>STRP: First Dolphin-Safe Tuna, now Sea Turtle-Safe Shrimp?</TITLE>

<H2>First Dolphin-Safe Tuna, now Sea Turtle-Safe Shrimp?</H2>

<H3>ASPCA, The Fund For Animals, The Humane Society of the United States Join Earth Island Institute in Turtle-Safe(TM) Shrimp Eco-labeling Campaign<P>

Mutilated Sea Turtles Wash Ashore on Texas Beaches</H3>

San Francisco -- Citing the federal government's apparent inability to end the drowning deaths of thousands of endangered sea turtles every year in US waters, a coalition of over 45 environmental and animal protection organizations and concerned businesses has launched a consumer-powered campaign to end the slaughter. The Turtle-Safe(TM) Shrimp Program works with responsible shrimp fishers who use fishing gear which allows sea turtles to escape from shrimp nets. <P>

"From its inception in 1866 the ASPCA has been, and will continue to be, committed to protecting endangered sea turtles," said Jamie Cotel Altman of the ASPCA."Turtle Excluder Devices, or TEDs, are inexpensive devices which, when sewn into shrimp nets, serve as an easy means of escape for sea turtles. Use of TEDs is mandated by federal law."<P>

Despite such laws, in 1995 over 2,000 sea turtles washed up dead on US beaches. These high numbers support the widely-held belief that many US shrimpers, particularly in the Gulf of Mexico, are disabling their TEDs because they fear a reduced catch. Yet when used properly, TEDs can actually increase the overall shrimp catch and lower operating costs.<P>

"Shrimpers who properly and consistently use TEDs, and sign contracts with Earth Island Institute agreeing to participate in a monitoring program, are certified as Turtle-Safe," explained Todd Steiner, Director of the Sea Turtle Restoration Project of Earth Island Institute. "They are permitted to use our Turtle-Safe logo on their shrimp, and display signs on their boats. For our part, we help increase demand through our ever-growing activist network, and by publicizing the campaign and the product."<P>

Over 100 sea turtles have stranded since shrimp season opened, only a few weeks ago. Many of these turtles have had their flippers and/or heads cut off. Some have even been shot. One Kemp's ridley sea turtle had been shot twice and had a rope tied around one flipper; presumably the rope had been tied to a weight in hopes of "sinking the evidence." The Kemp's ridley is one of the most endangered animals on earth.<P>

"The addition of large national organizations with millions of members, such as the ASPCA, The Fund for Animals and The Humane Society of the United States, will enable us to reach millions of US citizens with our message: Don't eat shrimp unless it's Turtle-Safe," added Carole Allen of Help Endangered Animals - Ridley Turtles (HEART), a Houston, Texas-based organization which has spearheaded the coalition-building effort. "Shrimpers who refuse to save sea turtles need to feel the economic pressure millions of caring consumers can wield."<P>

"Shrimp fishing is one of the most wasteful fisheries in the world," said Dr. John W. Grandy of The Humane Society of the United States. "In addition to drowning thousands of sea turtles every year, shrimp nets capture and kill ten pounds of non-target species for every pound of shrimp caught. TEDs reduce this "by-catch" by up to 60%. They reduce impacts to sea turtles and to the entire marine environment."<P>

"The National Marine Fisheries Service has proven itself unwilling to take meaningful action to save these gentle creatures from extinction," said Cleveland Amory, best-selling author and president of The Fund for Animals. "We will use the power of the pocketbook to bring about change and protect this endangered species. Scientists agree: we need some areas of the Gulf to be closed to shrimp fishing, and we need to limit the number of shrimp boats in the fleet. It's out of control."<P>

"We did it for the dolphins," pointed out Steiner, referring to Earth Island's successful campaign to end the drowning of dolphins in tuna nets by convincing shoppers to boycott tuna. "We can do it for the sea turtles. Georgia shrimpers who are participating in this campaign provided over one million pounds of Turtle-Safe shrimp to the marketplace in our pilot project phase last year. We invite Texas shrimpers to get on board."<P>

<H2>Shrimp Embargo Today [May 1] for 40 Nations</H2>

<H3>Affecting $1 Billion of Exports Environmentalists Applaud Victory for Sea Turtles!</H3>

May 1, 1996 

The U.S. Department of State announced an embargo of all wild-caught shrimp from
all but a handful of nations today. The action results from a successful
lawsuit filed by environmentalists in the United States Court of International
Trade. Judge Thomas J. Aquilino ordered the government to enforce an amendment
to the Endangered Species Act which requires nations exporting shrimp into the
U.S. to use "comparable" sea turtle technology in the harvest of shrimp
beginning May 1, 1996. <P>

Of the more than 70 nations that export shrimp to the U.S. only <B>36 were found
to be in compliance</B>. Their wild-caught shrimp can still be exported to the U.S.

<TITLE>STRP: U.S. Judge Denies Motion To Postpone Deadline For Shrimp Embargo</TITLE>

<H2>U.S. Judge Denies Motion To Postpone Deadline For Shrimp Embargo</H2>
<H3>Embargo on May 1st for Nations Who Do Not Adopt Sea Turtle Conservation Measures</H3>
 

17 April 1996<P>

A U.S. federal Judge has denied a last-minute attempt to once again delay implementation of a provision of the Endangered Species Act requiring the use of a turtle-saving device on the shrimp nets of foreign vessels for an additional year.<P>

Thomas J. Aquilino Jr. of the United States Court of International Trade (formerly called U.S. Customs Court) ruled against the U.S. government's "motion for a modified order" and has ordered the government to "prohibit not later than May 1, 1996 the importation of shrimp or products of shrimp wherever harvested in the wild with commercial fishing technology which may affect adversely (those species of) sea turtles." This ruling upholds an earlier ruling on December 29, 1995 by the same court ordering an embargo May 1 of nations not in compliance.<P>

The lawsuit, brought by the Earth Island Institute, Sierra Club, The Humane Society of the United States and the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals compelled the government to enforce an amendment to the Endangered Species Act requiring "comparable" sea turtle conservation technologies be adopted by countries wishing to sell shrimp in the U.S. market. The law requires foreign vessels to use turtle excluder devices (TEDs) which allow turtles to escape from shrimp nets, and are already required on U.S. shrimp vessels.<P>

In a sharply-worded opinion, Judge Aquilino admonished the government for seeking an additional delay after more than six years of illegal delays, "Nonetheless, and also seemingly in spite of the one and a half years' lead time originally afforded by Congress in the statute and the  five first days of May since [i.e. five years], as well as the aforesaid four months advance warning the timing of the Court's decision entailed, come now the defendants with a motion for "modification" of that decision....Such a hearing has been held, and the paucity of evidence in support of the motion enables this decision to be expeditious... At first blush, the foregoing declarations were of sufficient moment to cause the court to convene immediately, at which hearing the defendants and intervenor-defendant were afforded an opportunity to present evidence in support thereof. They did not. Little was added to the few facts already included in their scripted generalizations. Either they could not or would not answer rudimentary questions seemingly relevant thereto."<P>

Judge Aquilino wrote, "The papers upon which the defendants now apparently rest are revealing, but they are also contradictory and/or unsupportive of the extraordinary relief requested... Facts and circumstances such as the foregoing hardly favor modification of the annual deadline the U.S. Congress enacted in 1989.... If as Secretary Claussen points out, nations have been on notice of section 609, even before as well as after its formal enactment in 1989, then the presumed anticipation of Congress has been realized, and any additional extension of time for all countries, including those certifiable now, would be more than anomalous... Certainly, this mandate to negotiate "as soon as possible" and to apprise Congress "not later than one year after the date of enactment" hardly bespeaks an additional annum of delay more than six years after the date."<P>

In regard to reports submitted to Congress by the Under Secretary of State in 1993 and 1995, which insisted that the government's "commitment to promoting, as a matter of policy, equivalent measures to protect sea turtles in other areas where sea turtles are taken incidental to commercial shrimp fishing operations," Judge Aquilino chided the government's inaction saying, "those representations may have been nothing more than lip service." <P>

The Judge had apparently lost patience with the government's continuing delays through additional court maneuvers. He wrote he was considering sanctions against the government. "Clearly in the court's judgment, the defendants violated [CIT Rule 11(c)] these expectations in the presentment of their motion for modification. In fact, it has engendered exactly the kind of confusion which the rule has been adopted to prevent. Whether the perception of impossibility the defendants attempt to perpetrate applies to foreign exporters or to themselves is not certain. Whichever, the governing law, the controlling facts and their expectable allegiances and duties are (or should be) clear enough to state that, but for the desirability of curtailing further litigation, this court would order the defendants to show cause why sanctions should not be imposed pursuant to CIT Rule 11(c)."<P>

Todd Steiner, Director of the Sea Turtle Restoration Project of Earth Island Institute said, "This strongly worded decision illustrates the government's strategy of using litigation to delay the inevitable. Judge Aquilino ordered the enforcement of a clear and unambiguous law to protect sea turtles from drowning in shrimp nets by requiring nations who export shrimp to the U.S. to use turtle excluder devices (TEDs) or lose the privilege of selling that shrimp in the U.S. market." He continued, "Enforcement of the May 1 deadline is sure to save more than 100,000 a year from the excruciating death of being forcibly held under water and drowning. We hope the strong opinion of Judge Aquilino will convince the government to give up on its strategy of delay, and get on with the business of enforcing a law aimed at helping the ancient sea turtles reverse their rendezvous with extinction."<P>

The Judge's decision (Slip Op. 96-62) was made on April 10, 1996.

<TITLE>STRP: Giant Legal Victory for Sea Turtles!</TITLE>

<H1>STRP: Giant Legal Victory for Sea Turtles!</H1>

<H2>70 Nations must adopt sea turtle conservation measures or face shrimp
embargo on May 1st.</H2>

Great news for sea turtles!  On December 29, 1995 a federal judge ruled in
favor of a lawsuit brought by the Sea Turtle Restoration Project (STRP),
forcing all countries that export shrimp to the United States to adopt sea
turtle conservation measures for their shrimp fleets by May 1, 1996 or face an
embargo of their shrimp products.  The American Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Animals, The Humane Society of the United States, the Sierra Club
and the Georgia Fishermen's Association were also parties to the lawsuit.<P>

An elated Todd Steiner, Director of STRP, stated, "This decision will save more
than 100,000 endangered sea turtles from needlessly drowning in shrimp nets
every year, ending the largest killing of endangered species occurring in the
world right now."  STRP estimates that at least 124,000 turtles may be captured
and killed every year in the nets of foreign shrimp boats.  <P>

Steiner added, "We're  overjoyed that Judge Aquilino had the courage to
overturn the US State Department, putting environmental protection ahead of
so-called 'free trade' issues.  Most importantly, sea turtles will no longer be
unnecessarily killed for a cheap shrimp salad."<P>

Judge Thomas J. Aquilino of the United States Court of International Trade
directed the Secretaries of State, Treasury and Commerce (defendants) "to
prohibit not later than May 1, 1996 the importation of shrimp or products of
shrimp wherever harvested in the wild with commercial fishing technology which
may affect adversely those species of sea turtles the conservation of which is
the subject of regulations promulgated by the Secretary of Commerce on June 29,
1987... and to report the results thereof to the Court on or before May 31,
1996."  The court, formerly called US Customs Court, is in New York City. <P>

Prior to this ruling, the US only required 14 Atlantic and Caribbean nations to
use turtle excluder devices (TEDs) on their shrimp vessels if they wished to
export shrimp to the US.  Even these nations were not required to use them on
the Pacific coast.  The lawsuit compels the US Department of State to ban the
importation of shrimp into the US from <B>all nations</B> that have not reduced sea
turtle mortality from shrimp fishing operations by 97 percent, the level that
can be achieved with the proper use of TEDs on all vessels.  Now, all countries
that harvest shrimp in waters shared with sea turtles, and export their product
to the US, will be required to use TEDs no matter where they fish, or face an
embargo May 1, 1996.<P>

"This is a monumental decison.  We have successfully accomplished what we set
out to do: end the government's violation of the law in order to protect these
vulnerable marine animals from extinction," said Josh Floum, attorney at
Heller, Ehrman, White and McAuliffe, who represented environmentalists pro
bono. <P>

"The administration had thwarted the will of Congress and the American people
by not enforcing this law which is aimed at the global protection of endangered
and threatened sea turtles.  Using every procedural hurdle possible, the
agencies delayed our day in court for nearly five years, resulting in the
capture of more than 500,000 sea turtles.  As a result of our lawsuit, the
world's oceans are now safer for these magnificent animals,"  said Nicole
Walthall, attorney.  <P>

"This case also set an important precedent on the issue of standing for
environmental and conservation plaintiffs, " Walthall continued.  "Clarifying
the Supreme Court's 1992 decision on standing in <B>Lujan v. Defenders of
Wildlife</B>, this decision clearly establishes environmental plaintiffs' right to
seek judicial enforcement of US laws, like this one, aimed at the global
protection of threatened and endangered animals."  <P>

Nations can come into compliance quite simply, by installing TEDs on all
shrimping vessels that fish in waters shared with sea turtles, as has been done
by the US fleet.  Seventy nations are affected.  The largest eight exporters to
the United States (by weight) of wild-caught shrimp are India, Indonesia,
Thailand, Mexico, Malaysia, Brazil, Korea (ROK), and Japan.  (This does not
include farm-raised shrimp).<P>

US shrimpers also hailed the decison, as it "levels the playing field" in the
competitive shrimp market while protecting marine ecosystems.  Jack d'Antignac,
US shrimper and President of the Georgia Fishermen's Association, said,
"Members of the Georgia Fisherman's Association have been using TEDs and
protecting sea turtles even before their use became mandatory in the US.
Foreign countries not using TEDs are willfully killing sea turtles.  It's way
past time that shrimpers from all countries start using TEDs in order to
preserve our shared marine environment.  The relatively small loss of shrimp
caused by TEDs is more than compensated for by the improved quality of our
catch.  TEDs save turtles, reduce the unnecessary killing of countless fish,
and protect the marine environment on which we all depend.  It will be easy
enough for these other countries to use TEDs, if they have the sincere desire
to do so."

Earth Island Institute (EII) was founded in 1982 by <A
HREF="brower/browerbr.html">David Brower</A> to foster the work of creative
individuals by providing organizational support in developing <A
HREF="allproj.html">projects</A> for the conservation, preservation, and
restoration of the global environment.  EII provides results-oriented
individuals the freedom to develop program ideas, supported by services to help
them pursue those ideas, with a minimum of bureaucracy. <P>

By providing assistance in program strategy, public relations, database
management, accounting, and project coverage through <A
HREF="journal/journal.html">Earth Island Journal</A>, EII offers a cost
effective organizational structure to advance the work of its diverse projects.
While EII administers and provides support services for some thirty projects,
it does not directly fund or subsidize these projects.  Project directors
manage their own fundraising efforts with foundations and the general public.
<P>


Since we have 380 pages it may be easier to <A
HREF="/scripts/wwwwais/config=ei">search all our pages</A> for a specific
subject. The search will also include all our <A
HREF="allproj.html">projects</A> pages. Our Netscape commerce server
permits secure credit card transactions. You may become a general member of
Earth Island Institute.  We envision projects having their own membership /
merchandise forms in place shortly, allowing donors to target their dollars to
a project at EII, if you chose. If you have any questions, <A

<A NAME="Cant"><H2>Can't See the Desert for the Trees</H2>

China -- From the land of big numbers comes a story of eco-restoration on a big
scale. Over the last 30 years, the Zhongwei Gusha Forestry Farm has saved 280,000
acres of farmland from desertification. This accomplishment involved cultivating
67 million seedlings, planting 55 million trees and installing 1130 acres of
orchard. The effort cut the number of wind-whipped days from 330 to 122. The
restored habitat has attracted 147 different  animals and 260 plant species. The
Forestry Farm was one of 33 winners of last June's 1995 UN Environment Program's
World Environment Day award.

<A NAME="Canada"><H2>Canada Set to Suck Rainforest Oil</H2>

Guatemala -- The Ramrod Gold Corporation, a Canadian company, has been granted
oil-drilling rights to 316,000 acres of rainforest smack in the midst of the
Mayan Biosphere in Guatemala's northern Peten province. Because oil extraction is
prohibited under Guatemala's Protected Areas Law, the government maintains that
the concession falls outside the park. The National Commission for Protected
Areas (CONAP) claims that the project never should have been approved, because no
environmental impact study was carried out and only CONAP can approve projects
within the reserve.

<A NAME="Fly"><H2>Fly the Dirty Skies...</H2>

The Netherlands -- Despite advertising pitches featuring clear blue skies and
fleecy-white clouds, the truth is that jet travel is the most polluting form of
transportation on (and off) the Earth. A single 500 km (310 mile) flight can
produce three times the CO2 and five times the nitrogen oxides as a train
traveling the same distance. In an attempt to meet its greenhouse-gas-reduction
goals and discourage people from hopping a plane, the Dutch Environment Ministry
has proposed a "carbon tax" on kerosene jet fuel and a flyers' tax on airline
tickets. Airline tickets currently are exempt from taxes, and airlines pay only
30 cents per liter of kerosene (car drivers pay $1.80 for a liter of gas).
Although The Netherlands has operated on the "polluter pays principle" since the
late 1980s, the air flight industry reacted with fury. "A tax would really cook
Europe's goose," objected Dutch airport official J. de Boer, who argued that in
America "they have no consumption tax at all. Tax is a dirty word there." A KLM
official complained that it would be more effective for the authorities to "pull
up their socks" and rein in the Dutch Air Force since "aircraft are forced to
make detours of an average of 30 percent of the journey distance to circumvent
military airfields."

<A NAME="Log"><H2>Log-Hogs Eye Eastern Europe</H2>

Malaysia -- Samling Timber, having laid waste to the native rainforests of
Sarawak, East Malaysia, has moved its merciless operations abroad. In Cambodia,
Samling has purchased logging concessions from the murderous Khmer Rouge. In
Guyana, Samling is poised to flatten South American tropical forests. Now,
Samling, recognized as one of history's most destructive enterprises, is
spreading its operations into the weakened economies of Eastern Europe. The first
proposed target: The forests of Romania's Carpathian mountains.

<A NAME="Not"><H2>Not in My Back-Sky</H2>

Germany -- By the year 2000, Germany hopes to produce one-fourth of its electric
power by harnessing the wind, and more than a third of Germany's 3000 windmills
now whirl away on the coastal cliffs of Schleswig-Holstein. Although these wind
machines emit no greenhouse gasses, some local residents are complaining about
their "visual emissions." Groups such as the National Association to Protect the
Landscape and "Windmill Landscape Killers" condemn the massive blades as 
eyesores, and noisy ones at that. As new windmill heights climb to 80 meters (262
feet), local home-owners fear their property values will plummet. And then there
is the late-afternoon "disco effect," which has neighbors stamping their feet --
not to music, but with anger as the shadows of the spinning blades flash
strobe-like flickers across the hills.

<A NAME="Dont"><H2>Don't Toss That Toaster</H2>

Japan -- The Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) estimates that
Japanese home owners threw out 65,000 tons of old appliances in 1994, and 4.9
million cars were exchanged or discarded. The Health and Welfare Ministry now is
considering requiring manufacturers to collect and recycle old cars,
refrigerators, TVs and other home appliances. Compulsory package recycling would
begin in 1997. In the US, the private sector is filling in where the government
has failed to act. With one phone call, the Appliance Recycling Centers of
America [ARCA, 7400 Excelsior Blvd., Minneapolis, MN 55426-4517; (800) 654-2722]
can dispatch a truck to pick up and recycle "major household appliances in an
environmentally sound manner."

<A NAME="Cotton"><H2>Cotton: Poor but Honest</H2>

Uganda -- Third World Network Features reports that Uganda is one of the few
countries in the world "able to produce environmentally friendly cotton." In the
1960s, cotton comprised 30 percent of Uganda's export income. After the 1971 coup
by military despot Idi Amin, cotton export earnings fell to only three percent.
Today, because poor farmers cannot afford high-cost imported agri-chemicals,
Uganda's chemical-free cotton  is  sought by eco-conscious consumers in Germany
and the UK.

<A NAME="Dump"><H2>Dump the Slime; Do the Time?</H2>

Romania -- Last September, the Romanian Senate passed an Environmental Protection
Law that "severely punishes" people or companies found guilty of causing massive
pollution. Radio Bucharest reported that prison terms of six-to-ten years can be
meted out for releasing toxic materials into waterways or failing to prevent
nuclear accidents. Anyone caught importing toxic wastes can be jailed for up to
six years. Enforcement would be backed with an Environmental Fund financed by
fines on polluters and by fees and taxes on the consumption of water, fish and
processed wood. Romanian activists, however, note that the government is still
"both primary polluter and environmental protector." Ignoring the advice of the
Washington Environmental Law Trust, Romania's Environmental Fund lacks  citizen
input and oversight. Romanian journalist Alexandru Savulescu has warned: "This
law is not about the environment, but about money and control of money."

<A NAME="Climate"><H2>Climate Change Kills Nomads</H2>

Tibet -- The worst snowstorm in a century dropped temperatures to minus 57*F in
the Tibetan plateau. In Qinghai province, 16,000 nomads were reported suffering
from frostbite and another 12,000 were disabled with snowblindness. Nearly all of
the 80,000 Tibetan nomads lost their yaks and sheep to the freezing snows and
many face starvation. Doctors Without Borders [(212) 679-6800] is providing
relief aid.

<title>How Big is our Ecological Footprint?</title>

<H1>How Big is our Ecological Footprint?</H1>

<BLOCKQUOTE>"If everyone on Earth lived like the average Canadian, we'd need at least three
Earths to provide all the material and energy essentials we currently use."</BLOCKQUOTE>

-- University of British Columbia<P>

<HR>

The "ecological footprint" concept (also known as Appropriated Carrying
Capacity) is an ecological accounting method developed by the Task Force on
Planning Healthy and Sustainable Communities at the University of British
Columbia. Using land area as the measurement unit, the ecological footprint of
a city is calculated by translating different categories of human consumption
into the area of productive land required to provide resources and assimilate
waste products. The resulting footprint can measure current consumption against
projected requirements and point out potential shortcomings. For example, the
Lower Fraser Valley east of Vancouver has an ecological footprint 20 times
larger than the actual land area it occupies, based on a population of 1.7
million (or 4.25 people per hectare).<P>

As the Task Force emphasized, the challenge was to find a way to balance human
consumption and nature's limited productivity in order to ensure that our
communities are sustainable locally, regionally and globally. The choice is not
about <B>whether</B> to do this, but <B>how</B> to do it.<P>

The ecological footprint of an average Canadian adds up to more than 4.8
hectares (12 acres) -- about the size of three city blocks. This figure
includes the amount of agricultural land, forest, energy and area of built
environment necessary to support his/her average consumption.<P>

The amount of ecologically productive land available to each person on Earth
has decreased over the last century to 1.6 hectares (4 acres) -- about one city
block . With world population projected to reach 10 billion by 2030, an average
of only 0.9 hectares (2.2 acres) per person of productive land will remain
available.<P>

The Task Force suggests that an increase in city density can decrease land-use
requirements, by reducing the built environment's extent and facilitating less
energy-intensive lifestyles. A study of the San Francisco area showed that
doubled residential density reduced private transportation by 20-30 percent.
The study also showed that grouped -- rather than free-standing -- housing
significantly lowered residential heating requirements.<P>

Since we are all consumers of nature's productivity, the Task Force urged
everyone -- including politicians and planners -- to work together now to make
our communities more sustainable and improve our quality of life.<P>

<H2>THE SAN GERARDO PROJECT</H2>



<p>



<I>A Model Sustainable Community-Development Project within <B>Bosque Eterno de los Ninos,



The First International Children's Rain Forest.</B></I><p>







The San Gerardo Project is a joint undertaking of the Monteverde Conservation 



League and the people of San Gerardo Arriba, a small rural community within 



Bosque Eterno de los Ninos, the first international children's rain forest. 



The Bosque Eterno de los Ninos is a large expanse of forest (more than 16.000 



hectares, 39,600 acres) that has been purchased by the league as a means of 



protecting the forest itself, the watershed, and the rainforest habitat that is 



so crucial to the survival of many plant and animal species.<p>







San Gerardo is currently the only community within the boundaries of the 



children's rain forest.  The community's traditional means of livelihood was 



severely hampered by the restrictions applied when the government declared the 



area a part of a protected zone in 1977.  Development of existing farms was 



limited and many members of the community had to seek another means of 



supporting themselves and their families.<p>







The purpose of the San Gerardo Project is to allow these people to live within 



the protected forest and make a living in a way that is compatible with the 



rules of the Arenal-Monteverde Protected Zone and the philosophy of the league 



concerning preservation and enhancement of the rain forest.  In addition, the 



project is intended to be a model of sustainable development for other 



communities.  The people of San Gerardo Arriba and the league have developed a 



master plan that calls for community development in the areas of organic 



gardening, alternative agriculture, development of infrastructure and housing, 



clean power and water, selective ecotourism, and, in the project's largest 



current undertaking, the construction of a biological research station.<p>



San Gerardo is in a biologically rich area.  It lies in the upper watersheds of 



the Cano Negro and San Gerardo rivers, which along with the watershed of the 



nearby Penas Blancas River, contain 40 percent of the mammal species and 63 



percent of the bird species that are in danger of extinction in Costa Rica. 



The site is at an elevation of 1,220 meters (4,000 feet) in premontane, 



Atlantic-slope rain forest, about four kilometers (2.5 miles) from the 



Continental Divide.  This elevation, from 1,000 - 1,400 meters (3,280 - 4,593 



feet), is one of the least-studied areas of tropical rain forest; having a 



facility available at this altitude in San Gerardo should contribute greatly to 



the understanding of this life zone.<p>







The construction and operation of a research station will provide jobs and 



income for the people in the community.  The station will furnish facilities 



for researchers and student groups, such as housing, meals, laboratory space 



and basic equipment, and trails through a variety of habitats as well as field 



assistants who have grown up in the area and who have already received natural 



history training.  It will be a model of sustainable development, with lumber 



for construction cut from fallen trees, electrical power produced by a 



hydroelectric unit, water heating from solar energy, backup water heating and 



cooking from a methane generator, and as much food as possible grown 



organically on site.<p>







The overall project with the biological research station was initiated with 



four objectives in mind:<br><OL><LI>To provide researchers with a facility where 



more can be learned about the surrounding rain forest, in terms of both pure and 



applied research.  The league is committed to making the resulting information 



available to the local community, to the national and international scientific 



community, and to national and international visitors as well as using it in pursuit 



of its goals of preservation and restoration of the rain forest.<LI>To provide a facility 



for use by student groups studying various aspects of the rain forest as well as the 



sustainable development and alternative energy aspects of a self-sustaining rain forest community.







<LI>To provide the people of San Gerardo with an ongoing income from use of the 



station and from jobs such as guides, cooks, maintenance, food provision, etc.



<LI>To contribute to an overall model of community sustainability through 



creation and management of the station



</OL>







The Monteverde Conservation League has secured a grant from the Alex C. Walker 



Foundation to cover some of costs of the project coordinator, building 



materials and labor for the station, and improvements to the access road. 



Additional funds are currently being sought to complete and equip the station 



and begin a small-farm experimental project to develop organic gardening 



techniques and alternative cash crops.<p>







Members of the Monteverde Conservation League, the people of San Gerardo 



Arriba, and members of the communities that surround Bosque Eterno de los Ninos 



are excited about the project and are closely watching this experiment in 



sustainable community development within a rain forest environment.

<title>Kenya: Training by Collaboration</title>

<body>







<H2>Training by Collaboration</H2>







<H4>by Lincolin Ornston</H4><p>







Greetings, readers of the Manor House News! These are the ramblings of a 



culture-shocked American volunteer working with Manor House Agricultural 



Centre. I came to Kenya this past February as a member of an American 



organization called Global Service Corps (GSC), with the intention of spreading 



the gospel of bio-intensive agriculture (BIA) in Mumias division in Western 



Province. Although the official GSC project lasted only three weeks, I am still 



in Kenya, still working in the field of BIA, and still struggling to understand 



life in Kenya. <p>







Our group of six women and two men arrived in Nairobi late on a Saturday 



evening in mid-February. We spent the next day attempting to adjust to our new 



environment by wandering through the City Market; if the formidable task of 



fending off "real elephant hair" bracelet hawkers and stall attendants can be 



considered "adjusting," then I guess we were in the right place. The following 



morning we drove to Manor House, where we were to spend the next five days 



attending a week-long workshop in BIA. Although most of our group was familiar 



with basic kitchen gardening techniques, only two or three had any practical 



experience with bio-intensive. The first morning at the Centre was spent in 



introductions and speeches that are formalities at the Centre. After 



introductions we were taken on a tour of the Centre's gardens.<p>







For the next five days we attended classes and performed practical work in the 



gardens. About 40% of working time was spent on theory and the other 60% on 



practical work in the gardens. When not working, we attempted to accustom 



ourselves to the practices of taking morning and afternoon tea, muddling 



through power outages, and dealing with the lack of warm water for bathing and 



clean water for drinking. We told each other it was all a part of the African 



experience, and we all maintained a positive attitude.<p>







By the following Saturday our workshop had ended, and we drove to Mumias, where 



the real work was to take place. Our stay in Mumias had been coordinated by the 



newly-formed CPK Diocese, and each member of our group was housed with a 



private family in the area. After a weekend spent with our Kenyan families, we 



met at the Diocese headquarters on the following Monday morning to take part in 



a bio-intensive workshop; the workshop was intended primarily to foster 



awareness of biointensive principles and methods among the Diocesan clergy. 



Present as facilitators for the workshop were the eight GSC participants, 



Patrick Wasike of MHAC, two members of the Diocese who had participated in the 



one-week workshop with our group, members of the Kakamega Bio-lntensive group, 



and certain local officers of the Government Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock 



and marketing. Our audience was a select group of clergy and lay members of the 



Diocese, all of whom were to be involved in the seven days of instruction which 



were to follow.<p>







Starting the following morning, the GSC workshops began in earnest. The eight 



participants had been paired off to form four groups of two, and each group was 



to conduct workshops in different parishes within the Diocese. Each workshop 



was generally held over the course of two days, and covered the basics of 



double-digging, composting, nursery development, and the development of organic 



fertilizers and pesticides. Workshop attendees included local farmers, members 



of women and self-help groups, and students from nearby primary and/or 



secondary schools. The site chosen for each workshop was usually that of the 



local church; it was reasoned that by selecting a central location such as a 



church, GSC and MHAC together with the community would be able to establish 



gardens which would serve as visible and accessible demonstration plots through 



which each community could further develop its knowledge of BIA.<p>







Workshops were participatory and interactive in nature. The GSC facilitators, 



with the assistance of community leaders, discussed and demonstrated the 



various techniques being taught. As guests, however, we were not permitted by 



our audience to perform too much manual labor. Ten seconds seemed to be the 



limit of the audience's patience with our mzungu jembe inexperience, and we 



were quickly relieved of out tools before we could hurt ourselves. Each 



workshop lasted from roughly nine in the morning until one in the afternoon, 



after which we would break for lunch with our hosts at the parish, and then 



either travel around the area or return to our homestay sites.<p>







Our group conducted workshops from Tuesday through Friday of that week, then 



broke for the weekend, and returned to work the following week from Monday 



through Wednesday. In all, together with workshop participants, GSC was able to 



establish 24 double-dugbeds, 14 composts and 13 nurseries distributed 



throughout 11 parishes. The Diocese headquarters, serving as the primary 



demonstration site, was left with 5 double-dug beds, one compost pile and one 



nursery, as well as the groundwork for the construction of a zero-grazing unit. 



After leaving Mumias, the GSC group toured Kenya for a few days, and then 



returned to the United States. I remained behind, and have been working as a 



consultant for MHAC, the Diocese, Global Service Corps, and various community 



groups in Rift Valley and Western Provinces. <p>







In May I traveled to Mumias to assess the development of each of the garden 



sites established during GSC's February visit. Many of the individuals who had 



attended the GSC workshops had established their own BIA gardens, and together 



with the gardens at the central demonstration sites  there were now 244 



double-dug beds, 46 composts and 39 nurseries. As might be expected, certain 



parishes had done exceedingly well, while others had progressed little. A 



combination of factors seems to have contributed to this disparity. Certainly, 



some of the GSC facilitators may have been more effective as teachers than 



others, and the areas developed by the most experienced (in bio-intensive 



techniques) facilitators were by far the most advanced. In addition, successful 



parishes had three important things in common: all had a clergy member 



interested in and personally and professionally dedicated to the project, all 



had a project leader respected by the community and personally dedicated to the 



project, and all had parishioners willing to experiment with innovative 



agricultural practices, despite the increased degree of labor required.<p>







This August, GSC brought a second group of participants to MHAC, and to the 



Diocese, in its attempt to promote food security in the Mumias area. 



participants in this last August workshop conducted BIA workshops in parishes 



which had not been involved in the February visit, as well as in the 



lesser-developed parishes included during the February workshops. MHAC and the 



Diocese are looking forward to GSC's future visits, and both organizations 



would like to thank the participants in GSC's past two trips for all of their 



hard work. Thanks go to Richard Lathrop, the director of Global Service Corps, 



Paige Brown, Jessica Goldberger, Carrie Re, Joan Ross, Bette Smitheram, and 



Mamie Yee, for the efforts they have made in promoting bio-intensive 



agriculture in Kenya. As for me, I continue to toil at Manor House increasing 



my knowledge of biointensive agriculture, rural development, matatu squeezing 



techniques, and pothole avoidance. Gotta love it!<p>

<H1>IMMP: HR 2179: the "Dolphin-Death" bill</H1>

<TITLE>HR 2179: the "Dolphin-Death" bill</TITLE>

On August 4th, Rep. Randy "Duke" Cunningham (R-California) introduced a bill,
HR 2179, in Congress to amend the Marine Mammal Protection Act. This bill,
which we call the "dolphin-death" bill, would undermine all of our hard-fought
efforts to stop the killing of dolphins by the tuna fishing fleets.<P>



Among its new provisions, the legislation would:

<UL>

<LI>allow the number of dolphins killed each year to more than double<P>

<LI>lift the tuna import embargoes that are currently in place against Mexico
and Venezuela<P>

<LI>repeal the Dolphin Protection Consumer Information Act of 1990<P>

<LI>allow US fishing fleets to again kill dolphins in the process of catching
yellowfin tuna<P>

<LI>end the current prohibition on sale of dolphin-unsafe tuna in the US.

</UL>

David Phillips, Executive Director of Earth Island Institute, said, 

<BLOCKQUOTE>"Rep.
Cunningham is trying to get rid of laws protecting dolphins so that
dolphin-unsafe tuna from Mexico can come flooding back onto our supermarket
shelves. Under this bill, even tuna caught by killing thousands of dolphins
could be labeled as 'dolphin-safe.' In our view, this is consumer fraud and a
<B>tragic death sentence for dolphins.</B>"</BLOCKQUOTE><P>



For reasons not fully understood, dolphins and tuna form mixed schools in the
Eastern Tropical Pacific Ocean. There, some tuna purse-seine vessels chase
schools of dolphins with helicopters and speedboats and encircle them in
mile-long nets as a way of catching the tuna that swim below. It has resulted
in the largest killing of marine mammals in the world. Since 1990, dolphin
mortality as a result of tuna fishing has dropped by more than 95 percent.<P>



We need your support to stop HR 2179 from being passed. To save the lives of
thousands of dolphins, please join in our letter-writing campaign to kill the
"dolphin-death bill," HR 2179. It's time to save the dolphins again!<P>

<H2>What you can do</H2>


Write to your Representatives and Senators opposing the dolphin killing bill,
HR 2179. Urge them to uphold the Marine Mammal Protection Act. Demand the
protection of dolphins, not the killing of them.<P>

Write letters to the Clinton Administration and urge opposition to HR 2179
which undermines the Marine Mammal Protection Act.<P>

<BODY>
<H1>Philip Speser, J.D., Ph.D.</H1>
<H3>President and C.E.O.</H3>
<H3>Foresight Science &amp; Technology Incorporated</H3> 
<H2>EDUCATION</H2>
<P><I>1981: </I>Ph.D., Political Science, State University of New York at
Buffalo.<I>  </I><B>Areas of Emphasis:</B>  Political philosophy, political
economy, public administration, comparative politics (European and Asian).</P>
<P><B>Dissertation:</B> <B>BEYOND THE CITY IN SPEECH.</B> The dissertation
examined the ontological and epistemological premises of different modes
(paradigms) of scientific thought in the context of how research is actually
conducted (i.e., the sociology of science). This exploration provided the
groundwork for an analysis of the utility of the modes in industry and politics.
Modes included classical Greek, Baconian, Hegelian, Marxist, and contemporary
Soviet and East European dissident social science.</P>
<P><I>1980: </I>J.D., cum laude, Law School, State University of New York at
Buffalo.<I>  </I><B>Areas of Emphasis:</B> Corporate tax, American
Constitutional law, philosophy of law.</P>

comparative politics (European and Asian).</P>
<P><I>1973: </I>B.A., Political Science and Journalism, Case Western Reserve
University, Cleveland, Ohio<I>.</I>  During undergraduate school Dr. Speser was
a columnist and later Editorial Editor of the Western Reserve <B>OBSERVER.</B></P>
<H2>EMPLOYMENT</H2>
<P><I>Present - 1981:  </I>President and C.E.O., Foresight Science &amp;
Technology.<I> </I></P>
<H2>Corporate Management</H2>
<P>Founder of the company, Dr. Speser handles general corporate management as
well as client services in the areas of technical marketing and
commercialization, technology transfer, government relations, science and
technology policy and program development, and economic development.</P>
<H2>Government Relations</H2>
<P><I>Science &amp; Technology: </I><B> </B>On behalf of clients Dr. Speser
was the lead lobbyist in Congress on the Small Business Innovation Development
Act of 1981, the Federal Technology Transfer Act of 1986, and other R&amp;D
related legislation.  As Executive Director of the National Coalition for
Science and Technology (NCST), he spearheaded lobbying focused on the Senate and
House Budget Committees and ran a highly successful breakfast series which
brought bench scientists, university and corporate R&amp;D executives, and
agency R&amp;D program managers together with key Senators and Congressmen for
small, informal discussions. In cooperation with member societies of NCST,
lobbyists from the university community, and others, he participated in efforts
relating to NSF, DoE, NASA, NIH, NOAA, and other R&amp;D agency authorizations
and appropriations.  Dr. Speser also was actively involved in legislative
initiatives relating to university facilities and equipment. Another well-known
client in this area was the Consortium for Social Science Associations. </P>
<P><I>Historic Preservation: </I>Primarily on behalf of the Society for
American Archaeology, Dr. Speser was active in archaeological, historic, and
environmental preservation matters. He was the lead lobbyist on the Convention
on Cultural Property Implementation Act and other legislation relating to
archaeology and the funding of archeological research and historic preservation
in general. His work also involved agency relations, primarily involving the
Departments of Interior and Agriculture and NSF. He was instrumental in
obtaining new regulations protecting archaeological resources under the Surface
Mining and Reclamation Act. Other well-known clients in this area included the
National Conference of State Historic Preservation Officers and the Garden Club
of America. In 1989, Dr. Speser spun-out Foresight's historic preservation
business as a separate corporation.</P>
<H2>Program Development</H2>
<P><I>Technology Transfer/Commercialization:</I> Dr. Speser has assisted
numerous clients to successfully market technology developed with in-house and
Federal funding. Among technologies worked in are photonics, advanced materials,
biomedical products, pharmaceuticals, construction materials, RF communications,
software, boiler inspection, sterilization equipment, and non-destructive test.
An example of a project is work conducted for AMSCO (American Sterilizer) of
Erie, PA. A team he headed assessed technologies developed by the company's
central corporate lab. From the technologies available, portfolios were
developed which could then be assessed as to their &quot;spin-off&quot;
potential for non-typical markets for this medical devices company. These
portfolios were researched to determine their commercial potential and business
plans prepared for commercialization of the most viable. </P>
<P>State level work has been conducted for Virginia, New York, and Florida.
Under contract to the Center for Innovative Technology of the State of Virginia,
Dr. Speser helped develop a technology transfer program which placed transfer
agents at community colleges throughout the state.  This included research on
program designs and training of technology transfer agents.  </P>
<P>Commercialization work has been conducted for two Federal agencies. Dr.
Speser authored a series of publications on commercializing Federally-funded R&amp;D.
This work was conducted under contract to the National Science Foundation. Under
a grant from the Department of Energy (DoE), he conducted a pilot program on
training awardees on how to commercialize government funded technology. Tasks
included writing and producing The SBIR Commercialization Manual, a training
guide, producing a presentation portfolio with material on awardees' technology
available for commercialization, and conducting a two-day training workshop.</P>
<P>Most of Dr. Speser's technology transfer work for the Federal Government has
been conducted under subcontracts. He led a team that authored a major study of
industry/university centers and prepared a manual on technology transfer under a
subcontract for the Office of Cooperative Environmental Management of the
Environmental Protection Agency. Under subcontract, he served as subject matter
expert on technology transfer and other high technology government policy and
economic development issues for the Agency for International Development. AID
work involved training seminars for visiting dignitaries from Europe, South
America, Asia, and Africa. Under another subcontract, he wrote an introductory
essay and prepared a volume on Research and Development Limited Partnerships for
the Department of Commerce.</P>
<P>Dr. Speser used pro bono company services to staff the Task Force on
National Technology Transfer Policy of the Technology Transfer Society, for
which he was chairperson. Activities included briefings for members of the House
Science &amp; Technology Committee staff, NSF, and others; preparation of
position papers on various issue; and organization and conduct of a national
symposium which brought together senior corporate, academic, and state and
Federal government executives with technology transfer experts to explore
progress in implementing the Technology Transfer Act of 1986 and whether
additional legislation was needed. </P>
<P><I>University/Industry Centers: </I>Dr. Speser participated in the initial
design work for the New York State Centers for Advanced Technology as a
consultant to Governor Hugh Carey's office. Subsequently, as head of a Foresight
team, he prepared a business plan for a university/industry center in medical
instrumentation at the State University of New York at Buffalo under a contract
from the Research Foundation of the State University of New York. A Foresight
team on which he served assisted in raising the initial capital.  The company
assisted Florida Atlantic University in establishing a university/industry
center for packaging and warehousing technology, and in raising private and
Federal funds to support the center. Under contract to Arvida/JMB Partners, he
also designed the institutional infrastructure for the University of North
Florida R&amp;D Park, Jacksonville, FL.  This design included an advanced
technology center, innovation center and minority high technology resource
center. The plan addressed both establishing and operating the centers. As a
consultant to NSF or NSF contractors, he sat on review and/or advisory panels
looking at various center's programs, including the Innovation Centers.  </P>
<H2>Sponsored Research and Publications</H2>
<P>Dr. Speser served, and continues to work as, principal investigator on many
company projects for state and Federal governments, universities, and
corporations. Recent projects include developing an expert system for analysis
of manufacturing production processes and technology transfer in rural
manufacturing companies under a Phase II SBIR award from USDA.  A complete
listing of research reports and publications accompanies this resume. For ten
years he was a Contributing Editor of <B><I>LASER FOCUS WORLD</I></B><I> </I>magazine.</P>
<H2>Technical Marketing / Defense Conversion</H2>
<P>Clients have included large and small companies and universities. Services
provided have ranged from raising R&amp;D funding for specific investigators to
developing strategic alliances based on a specific technological advance to
assisting universities with their grantsmanship programs. He has been
particularly active in the development and deployment of dual-use technologies
and in defense conversion.  Specific technologies he has worked with include
photonics and other light wave technologies, advanced materials, non-destructive
test, scientific instrumentation, test equipment, medical instrumentation,
biotechnology, robotics, navigation systems, advanced software (visualization,
expert systems, etc.), high temperature superconductivity, and geophysical
modeling. Activities have resulted in clients receiving both commercial
contracts and Federal and state government awards. </P>

<H2><I>What are SBIR and STTR?</I> </H2>

<P>The Small Business Innovation Research Program is a three-phased R&amp;D
program, designed to harness the innovative capabilities of small firms
on behalf of the federal government. It seeks to both develop technology
for federal use, and to spur commercialization of that technology. SBIR
consists of two phases of SBIR funding and a third phase of non-SBIR, private
sector or other federal funding. Phase I awards extend for six months and
can be funded for up to $100,000. No more than 33% of an award can be subcontracted.
Phase I awards support research projects to evaluate the scientific and
technical merit and feasibility of an idea. Only those firms that successfully
complete Phase I can compete for Phase II funding, to further develop the
proposed idea. Phase II awards are granted for the construction of an operational
prototype, and to take it to the point of manufacture. Most Phase II awards
are funded for $750,000 or less, and no more than 50% can be subcontracted.
In order to fairly handle the problem of choosing between proposals of
approximately equal scientific and technical merit, where the funds available
to agencies do not permit funding of all proposals, the law mandates that
commitments for follow-on funding from (a) a non-Federal third party or
(b) non-SBIR federal source forPhase III, will be given preference. Phase
III is the stage in which an innovation is brought to market by private
sector investment and support. As noted, no SBIR funds may be used in Phase
III.</P>

<P>The Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) pilot program
is modelled on the SBIR program. Its objective is to encourage technology
transfer through cooperative research between small business concerns and
research institutions. The STTR program has the same three phases as SBIR.</P>

<P>Only small businesses and their non-profit research institution partners
(non-profit institutions, universities or Federally funded research and
development centers) may compete in STTR. Research is to be conducted jointly
by a small business concern and its partner. Not less than 40 percent of
the work must be performed by the small business concern and not less than
30 percent by the nonprofit research institution.</P>

<H2><A NAME="SB"></A><I>What is the definition of a small business?</I>
</H2>

<P>For R&amp;D award purposes, <I>Small business</I> is defined as any
company with 500 or fewer employees. Individual entrepreneurs who form
small companies can qualify.</P>

<p>The Olympic Peninsula Foundation was established in 1992 as a (501)(c)(3)charitable
organization to facilitate economic and environmental vitality inone of
the world's most unique ecosystems, the Olympic Peninsula in WashingtonState
(USA). The Olympic Peninsula is changing in response to environmentalconcerns,
international economic competition, and population growth. Althoughthere
is confusion and disagreement concerning the best way to react andrespond
to these changes, most citizens agree they want a community whichprovides
an excellent quality of life for families in an environmentally sound,sustainable
economy. Such an economy provides healthy, satisfying, decent payingjobs
for workers as well as the education, medical, cultural, and recreationalservices
and opportunities. The Olympic Peninsula Foundation is devoted toworking
for that economy.</p>

<h1>Foresight Science &amp; Technology Incorporated</h1>

<h2>What's in a name? </h2>

<p>Our name describes what we do. We're specialists in the process of developing
and deploying technology. We began by studying this process, and then diversified
by applying what we and others have learned to help our clients succeed.
For over 15 years, we have been providing the foresight and services that
enable customers to realize their strategic plans . We currently operate
out of offices in Port Townsend, WA; W. Palm Beach, FL; N.Dartmouth, MA;

<li>technical marketing, including technology transfer and commercialization</li>
</ul>

<p>The Group's emphasis is on applied R&amp;D and development. It works
in two application arenas. Product development work focuses on artificial
intelligence based tools for the above processes. Policy analysis and institution
conceptualization and development (for example university/industry centers
and manufacturing technology centers) focuses on high-technology economic
development.</p>

<p>Our <b><a href="FSTMKT.HTM">Technical Marketing Group</a></b> helps
customers:</p>

<ul>
<p>Technology Niche Analysis (TNA) is a commercialization and technology
transfer support process developed by Philip Speser, J.D., Ph.D., and the
research staff of Foresight Science &amp; Technology, Inc. This service
is intended for Phase I and Phase II Small Business Innovation Research
(SBIR) Award recipients, universities, non-profit and federal laboratories,
and central labs of major corporations. TNA identifies applications, markets,
and competing technologies, and provides a market entry strategy and the
names of specific individuals at companies who have expressed potential
interest in commercializing your technology. </p>

<dt>For more information on Technology Niche Analysis, go to these portions
of our publication, the <i>National Science Foundation's Small Business
Guide to Federal R&amp;D Funding Opportunities</i>:</dt>

<br>
<dt>Our name is familiar because for over 15 years, Foresight has been
helping companies, government agencies, and universities make the SBIR
program work for them. You are probably acquainted with many of our products
and services, such as our work for 12 years as contractor for the National
SBIR Conferences. We also wrote most of the Federal Government's training
publications related to SBIR.</dt>

<br>
<dt>You may not know that for <i>over 15 years</i>, our technical marketing
group has been providing commercialization and technology transfer support
for small and large companies. Information on former clients and projects
of Foresight Science &amp; Technology Incorporated can be found here:</dt>

a Phase I and II USDA SBIR (Expert System for Technology Transfer into
Rural Manufacturers). A recently submitted Phase II Department of Education
SBIR proposal went in with Phase III commitments from a venture capital
firm and a consortium of school districts and other educational institutions.

<h2>Federal R&amp;D Funding </h2>

<p><b>We know that there are great ideas worthy of developing, but we also
know that no matter how good an idea may be, nothing happens without funding.
Finding funding for R&amp;D is a craft we have been honing for over 15
years.</b></p>

<p>If you are interested in obtaining Federal R &amp; D funding, Foresight
can:</p>

<ul>
<li>Assess Your Capabilities </li>

<li>Help You Find The Funding</li>

<li>Train You to Find Additional Funding on Your Own</li>
</ul>

<p>The <i>obvious</i> fact is that no matter how much the Federal Budget
goes up or down, there are always billions of R&amp;D dollars available.
Some of those dollars are in traditional R&amp;D prime contracts and grants.
Others are in special programs. SBIR, Manufacturing Technology, and Energy-Related
Inventions are a few examples. There are yet more available dollars in
subcontracts. Cooperative Research and Development Agreements, and other
partnerships, can provide yet more funding in the form of in-kind contributions.
</p>

<p>What is <i>not obvious </i>is how to find and win this money. Foresight's
network of staff and consultants walk the halls, work the phones and e-mail,
and follow-up to maintain our contacts year round. Timing and follow-up
often make the critical difference where R&amp;D dollars are concerned.
If you cannot conduct the kind of marketing you need in a timely manner,
we may be just the advantage you've been looking for in your quest for
Federal Funding. <a name="approach"></a></p>

<h2>Our Approach for Winning Federal R&amp;D Awards</h2>

<p>Before you spend money for marketing, you deserve to know what will
be done and how. Foresight services are based on the following 10 step
method. </p>

<ul>
<li>Define the research interests and capabilities of the client in cooperation
with the client. Conduct an intellectual property audit if it has not already
been done to insure that intellectual property systems are in place.</li>

<li>Identify the Presidential, Congressional, and Agency priorities as
well as other planned and current initiatives and projects of relevance.
After mapping the priorities, initiatives, and projects into R&amp;D funding
programs, use data bases and other secondary sources to determine the specific
priorities and funding levels for these programs.</li>

<li>Together with the customer, develop a set of &quot;strawman&quot; and
white papers for dissemination to those programs. Help the customer develop
a capability statement and other marketing documents, as necessary.</li>

<li>Contact all programs identified and use the strawmen to identify opportunities
and refine R&amp;D concepts. Determine proposal requirements, funding cycles,
ultimate end-users, etc. Seek information on additional programs to contact.</li>

<li>Revise the strawmen in light of information obtained from funding programs.</li>

<li>To influence funding programs, contact the ultimate end-users and assess
their needs and the timing of their technology introduction cycles. Also
assess if funding is available through them or sources they are aware of.
Determine their willingness to support fund-raising initiative.</li>

<li>Further refine white papers and prepare brief concurrent engineering
documentation for transitioning anticipated R&amp;D results into products
for Federal and, as appropriate, commercial markets.</li>

<li>Conduct market research (including preliminary sales) calls to relevant
programs. Develop R&amp;D funding and product introduction strategies including
the viable targets.</li>

<li>Review the strategies with the client and select a strategy (substantive
R&amp;D and product goals, funding goals, targets, training and information
systems enhancement tasking, timing, etc.)</li>

<li>Implement the strategy together with the client.</li>
</ul>

<p><a name="qual"></a></p>

<P>
</P>All marketing involves the identification of needs which your
product or service can satisfy. Without a need, no one buys anything.
A simple mental exercise drives this fact home. Ask yourself,
what is the price of shoes or a dress at the largest department
store in your town as advertised in the most recent Sunday paper.
Unless you are looking to buy a suit or dress, you likely will
not know. </P>
<P>
Federal R&amp;D awards pay for research and development relevant
to federal government needs. Unfortunately, this focus presents
an immediate problem for your commercialization effort. There
is no reason to assume that federal government needs are similar
to the needs of, or for that matter, even relevant for, commercial
entities. </P>
<P>
The disconnect between the needs of the federal government and
the commercial market is perhaps clearest with respect to projects
funded by the Department of Defense (DoD). There is no commercial
market for better defense against ballistic missiles. Despite
this disconnect, the technology created to address DoD needs may
have commercial applications. This is the basic premise behind
the DoD's dual use initiatives like the Technology Reinvestment
Project. </P>
<P>
The set of applications defined by a single set of technical <A href="glossary.htm#specs">performance specifications</A>
are what we call a <A href="glossary.htm#niche">Technology Niche</A>.</P>
<HR>
<H3></P><a name="4.1"></a>Technology Niche Analysis </H3>
<P>
</P>Technology Niche Analysis is a way of identifying Federal
government and commercial applications for your technology. The
method was developed by Dr. Philip Speser Foresight Science &amp;
Technology Incorporated in the mid-80's and has been refined since.</P>
Recently the method was tested by the U.S. Navy SBIR program.
The Navy provided Foresight six candidate technologies. All technologies
were selected by the Navy without any advice or input from Foresight.
For all six technologies, using the method described below, Foresight
located viable Phase III partners interested in entering contingent
commitment negotiations with the SBIR awardees.
<P>
The method involves 10 steps. Applications are filtered through
a series of funnels. Each step assesses potential applications
in light of pre-determined criteria. Eliminated applications are
not considered further. The steps are: </P>
<OL>
<LI>Define the technology in terms of its <A href="glossary.htm#specs">performance specifications</A>
and <A href="glossary.htm#Char">characteristics</A>. Make a preliminary
assessment if the technology falls within the current or potential
business(es) and policies of the company. If not, halt analysis.
<LI>Conduct on-line data search on commercial data bases on the
specifications in order to identify applications. If there are
no applications identified, halt the analysis. If applications
are found, identify the markets in which they apply. If at least
one application does not fit within an existing market, halt the
analysis unless management is willing to invest to &quot;build&quot;
a new market. 
<LI>Clarify the market entry or expansion objectives of the company.
Clarify how you want to compete, how large markets must be, and
what market share you are seeking. 
<LI>Using this information, conduct an on-line data search and
three to five follow-up telephone interviews with an <A href="#4.11">expert panel</A>
to assess the likely size of the market. If the market size is
appropriate continue, otherwise halt the analysis. (While you
are interviewing the experts, collect information that will allow
you to better structure on-line searches in future steps). <BR>
<BR>
In each market, conduct an on-line search and follow-up interviews
with <A href="#4.12">end-users</A> to identify the desirable characteristics
for the technology in their eyes. Also interview the actual buyers
of the technology, who may or may not be the end-users. Be sure
to evaluate the impact of government regulation, industry standards,
and industry cycles and trends. If the match between the characteristics
of the technology and those of the buyers and users is not sufficient,
eliminate the market. If data cannot be obtained through on-line
search, call five to seven experts from relevant associations,
government agencies, universities, consulting firms, and companies.
If all markets are eliminated, halt the analysis. 
<LI>Conduct another on-line search in each market to identify
specifications and characteristics of any equivalent or substitutable
technology currently deployed or anticipated to be deployed in
that market. If data cannot be obtained through on-line search,
conduct a <A href="glossary.htm#literate">literature search</A>
at a library with good collections of trade journals. You may
also call five to seven experts from relevant associations, government
agencies, universities, consulting firms, and companies. If substitutable
products in that market offer equivalent or better performance,
and the technology being commercialized has no overwhelming advantage
in terms of its specifications, characteristics, or cost, eliminate
that market. If no markets remain, halt the analysis. 
<LI>Assess the business strategies and marketing plans of targets.
Conduct another search for traits of specific targets in each
market of interest and assess the compatibility of the technology
and its development plan with respect for traits of the targets,
including their point in product development and manufacturing
improvement cycles. If the technology is not compatible for at
least one target in a market, eliminate that market. If no target
appears to have the financial wherewithal to acquire the technology
by purchase, license, or joint venture, also eliminate the market.
If all markets are eliminated, halt the analysis. Review advertising
and product data bases and, if need be, contact current or anticipated
targets to obtain pricing information. Also review information
on the companies available through the <A HREF="http://www.sec.gov/edgarhp.htm">SEC</A>
by using Internet. If viable targets do not exist, eliminate the
market. If no markets remain, halt the analysis. 
<LI>For each market that remains, prepare a brief <A href="#4.9">development plan</A>
specifying the tasks needed to prepare the technology for commercial
introduction with specifications and characteristics that clearly
address anticipated needs of buyers and, if different, end-users.
The plan should also provide a product at a competitive cost.
This cost is based on a rough estimated cost of the commercially
available product in light of final product development, manufacturing,
promotional costs, and the minimum required profit. If a development
plan cannot be prepared for a market, eliminate that market. If
no plan can be prepared which creates a product meeting the needs
(specifications and characteristics of buyers and end-users) at
a price within 10% of existing alternatives, halt the analysis.
<LI>Using the same methods applied to targets, assess your competitors.
Conduct a final search for any special capabilities, traits, or
reputation/goodwill of competitors that present exceptional barriers
to entry (i.e., financial, R&amp;D, manufacturing, marketing,
distribution, customer support, and management capabilities; quality;
market share and position; geographic location; timing of, and
position in, manufacturing/product development cycle). Eliminate
markets where such special advantages present additional barriers
to entry. Similarly, if the nature of competition in the market
place gives undue advantage to your competitors, consider abandoning
it. If no markets remain, halt the analysis. 
<LI>Develop a market entry strategy for each niche that remains.
Test your strategy by calling no more than seven companies in
that market and exploring their interest in sales, licensing,
and/or joint ventures. Select that market niche for which best
suits your company's capabilities, products, and strategy. If
there are many markets which are viable, use an <A href="#4.8">Analytical Heirarchical Procedure</A>
or other method to help structure your decision. 
<LI>Re-contact the seven companies in the selected market niche
to determine which would make the best candidates for sales, joint
ventures, strategic alliances, or licenses. Hold follow-up discussions
to assess if they are ready to move forward towards a contract.

<H3><a name="4.3"></a></P>On-Line Search Techniques </H3>
<P>
There is a separate chapter in this manual devoted to Internet.
 Here we provide just a few comments related to this topic.
<P>
A number of commercial vendors provide access to data bases. In
addition, there are numerous Federal data bases which can be accessed
via direct dial or over the Internet. Our experience at Foresight
suggests that <A HREF="http://www.corp.dialog.com/dialog/">DIALOG</A>,
a Knight-Ridder Information service, is the most useful commercial
vendor. DIALOG requires a fee for access. The <A href="govinfo.htm#6.1">National Technical Information Service</A>
and <A href="govinfo.htm#6.7">Defense Technical Information Center</A>
databases are the most useful government sources. </P>
<P>
Standard search techniques are to be used to construct the search
routines. These techniques involve six basic steps: </P>
<OL>
<LI>Define an appropriate question and identify appropriate key
words which can be used to search for information concerning that
question. 
<LI>Select an appropriate data base or set of data bases for searching.
<LI>Plan a set of search statements which use logical operators
and key words, dates, or other criteria to move from a more general
set of hits to a more specific set in order to target in on the
most relevant information without unduly restricting the search.
In conducting this step be sure to consider the appropriateness
of the means of restricting the range of hits in light of the
initial question. 
<LI>Execute the search on-line. 
<LI>Evaluate the results using <A href="#4.7">Bibliometrics</A>.
<LI>Modify the search as needed. 
</OL>
<P>
We recommend using <A HREF="http://altavista.digital.com/">Alta Vista</A>
to search the Internet. It is the best indexed service for scientific,
engineering, and technical work, as well as having the largest
number of indexed pages. Another good search engine is <A HREF="http://www.metacrawler.com/">Metacrawler</A>.
Metacrawler searches several of the other search engines at one
time - hence the &quot;meta&quot; in its name. 
<HR>
<H3><a name="4.4"></a></P>Criteria for Selecting Applications </H3>
<P>
Most firms will want to select those applications most likely
to lead to a quick sale of a product based on the technology being
developed. In this manner, a small company enhances its odds at
generating the cash flow needed for subsequent commercialization
efforts. </P>
<P>
This emphasis translates to a focus on the product which is likely
to face the lowest barriers to market entry. In business, like
Federal R&amp;D, people like to buy from companies which have
a track record of success. Being able to point to a commercially
successful product makes it easier to attract additional customers,
venture capital, debt, or other funds.</P> 
<P>
To assess which application has the lowest barriers to entry look
for markets where: </P>
<OL>
<LI>There are well articulated expressions of dissatisfaction
with existing technology. 
<LI>Formal organizations such as industry associations, Federal
agency panels, or special conferences have developed &quot;wish
list&quot; performance standards for new products. 
<LI>New technology can be priced at least 25% below currently
available means of meeting the need and still meet or exceed current
reliability, maintainability, and quality standards. 
<LI>Analysis of Price/Performance features of potentially substitutable
technology indicates niches which are not currently being served.
</OL>
<P>
It is not often that all four conditions exist. However, market
research can establish whether end-users are dissatisfied with
current products, if there is a consensus about what a replacement
product should look like, and at what price competing products
are sold. </P>

If several applications have low barriers to entry and if you
are interested in manufacturing and distributing the product,
one way to select between them is to look for applications in
emerging, but currently modest-sized, markets. At first this criterion
may seem counter-intuitive. After all, venture capitalists and
other investors might want the certainty that a large market exists
which can support huge returns-on-investments. However, the desire
to demonstrate phenomenal markets should be balanced by the realization
that professional investors will discount your sales projections
with a dose of skepticism. Having actual commercial sales will
lend credence to your projections by demonstrating that your company
can commercialize technology. </P>
<P>
An advantage of markets sustaining annual sales of around $1 million
to $5 million is that they often are too small to interest Fortune
500 competitors. Larger companies typically find that their overhead
makes it difficult to effectively exploit small market niches.
Even if your company develops the market into a much larger niche,
your company will have time to build a solid customer base and
experience before facing the low ball pricing and other predatory
tactics that the financial base of large firms makes possible.</P>
<P>
Another advantage of such markets is that in manufacturing a product
to serve the market, the production run volumes can be kept reasonably
low. Small companies new to a market tend to use small batch manufacturing
techniques. Commercialization generates numerous management headaches
no matter how well you plan for it, so it is probably wise to
avoid the need to build a large manufacturing organization until
your company is sure that it can sell its products.</P>
<HR>
<H3><a name="4.6"></a></P>Product Lines </H3>
<P>
The diversity of applications which comprise a Technology Niche
creates a problem. As the range of applications expands, the ability
of any set of performance specifications to precisely meet the
end-user's needs in all of the applications diminishes. One result
is that your technology must be thought of as enabling development
of a product line if you want to meet these different needs. Different
products in the line can be sold to different end-users. </P>
<P>
The unity in a technology based product line is that each individual
product in the line can be created by modifying peripheral aspects
of the underlying technology. Throughout the line the core specifications
underlying performance remain constant. In this manner economies
of scope in R&amp;D, manufacturing, and repair can be obtained.
As a result, your company's ability to use price during commercial
introduction and when bidding on Federal procurement opportunities
is a competitive advantage. </P>
<P>
Product lines need not be restricted to a single industry. For
example: a firm won an Army SBIR contract for an air acoustic
system to locate cluster bomb detonations on artillery ranges.
The system provided the basis for a range of military products,
such as forward artillery spotting. The combination of acoustic
detection and positioning algorithms also provided the basis for
commercial applications -- including a positioning system for
robots.</P> 
<HR>
<H3><a name="4.7"></a></P>Bibliometrics </H3>
<P>
A useful tool for analyzing data base search is bibliometrics.
Bibliometrics is a form of statistical analysis that is used to
discover trends in large data bases containing bibliographic information.
Its origin was in the study of publication records of academics.
There it was used to identify which papers were most important
in terms of the number of times they were cited and other measures.
Subsequently, the techniques have been expanded and applied to
patent data. National Science Foundation-sponsored research has
verified this application to be useful for providing very strong
hints about markets and players in emerging technologies as well
as indications of where companies are in their product development
cycles. In fact, the techniques studied were able to discover
trends and companies that had been missed by a panel of technical
experts. 
<P>
Bibliometric analysis of patent data has been found useful for
identifying the technology strategies of companies. The analysis
involves placing companies on continuums from early innovator
to follower and from in-house development of technology to extramural
development. </P>
<P>
The utility of bibliometrics on patent data for analyzing technologies
is limited to those technologies in which patenting is a key form
of intellectual property protection. Further, scientific literature
and patent data provide indicators at only two points in time
of the product development cycle. Foresight found that these limits
can be overcome if the techniques are modified and applied to
federal data bases capable of indicating applied research (DTIC,
FEDRIP or Federal Research in Progress) and trade publications
and new product announcements capable of indicating first commercial
introduction. To obtain a relatively complete picture of a technology
field across four key points in the product development cycle
(basic research, applied research, move into development, and
introduction), trade literature and federal data base analysis
must be combined with patent analysis and analysis of scientific
literature. </P>
<P>
Statistical methods are used in bibliometric analysis to assess
the fit between an application or market and specifications and/or
characteristics. These can include count of matches (any match
of interest), activity index of industries or markets using criterion
of interest (% matches in industry/total), standard match score
(standard deviations from norm), weighted count (matches within
time frame), and trends in application clustering over time (normalized
concentration of multiple specifications matches in general and
by industry; developer and applier organization concentration
in general and by industries).</P> 
<HR>
<H3><a name="4.8"></a></P>Analytical Heirarchical Procedure </H3>
<P>
Preliminary assessment of compatibility with current or potential
business(es) is analyzed with the aid of an Analytical Hierarchical
Procedure (AHP). In AHP, a user makes a series of pairwise comparisons
in order to arrive at a final set of weightings for criteria and
to ensure these comparisons are internally consistent. </P>
<P>
A simple grid on a spreadsheet can be used to compare each option
against all other options. </P>
<HR>
<H3><a name="4.9"></a></P>Development Plans </H3>
<P>
Development plans consist of well thought out presentations of
the steps required to move a technology from its current state
of development into the market; the timing and duration of the
steps; the labor and other resources required to complete those
steps, and a budget. </P>
<P>
A typical development plan for an SBIR or STTR project will have
eight steps: </P>
<OL>
<LI>Concurrent Engineering and Design (defining the product in
cooperation with marketing and manufacturing staff); 
<LI>Research and/or Engineering Development; 
<LI>Creation of a Prototype; 
<LI>Alpha (In-Lab) Testing and Engineering Revisions; 
<LI>Beta (Field) Testing and Engineering Revisions; 
<LI>Final Production Engineering and Packaging Design; 
<LI>Manufacturing and Packaging; 
<LI>Budget; 
</OL>
<P>
Depending on the state-of-the-art and your company's interests,
the development plan may begin with &quot;targeted&quot; basic
research rather than applied research. Throughout all of the R&amp;D
and engineering steps, attention will be paid to how best to manufacture
the product and how to design with reliability, maintainability,
and quality. Typically, costs will increase as the plan progresses.
</P>
<HR>
<H3><a name="4.10"></a></P>Development Plans and SBIR/STTR Proposals </H3>
<P>
The common elements of the development plans for the products
in your product lines should constitute the majority of work under
your Phase I and Phase II proposals. Phase I consists of enough
R&amp;D to prove the feasibility of your approach. Phase II should
take you through prototype development, alpha or beta testing,
and production engineering. The reason for this objective is that
it is easier to raise money or obtain in-kind Phase III support
if the funding source believes there will be a tangible, physical
product at the end of the Federally funded research which is ready
for manufacture. </P>
<P>
In order to enable your Phase II work to support as flexible a
commercialization effort as possible, the technical objectives
of this proposal should emphasize applied research and/or engineering
development. The specific objectives should leave your company
able to hit the core specifications required in your chosen Technology
Niche. </P>
<P>
The reason for the emphasis on the core specifications is straightforward.
Phase II takes approximately two years to complete. During that
time, new R&amp;D results or shifts in the economy can remove
the viability of your technology for any given application. In
effect, deriving the technical objectives from what performances
are needed to service a Technology Niche rather than a market
niche is a way of hedging your bets against uncertainties. The
prototype, based on a specific market application, should enter
the technical objectives more as an example of how your technology
can be applied rather than as the focus of the Phase II effort.</P>
<HR>
<H3><a name="4.11"></a></P>Quick Expert Survey </H3>
<P>
Most experts in a field will be willing to talk with SBIR competitors
and awardees briefly about the technology being developed and
its potential applications. If you are uncertain just who is the
best expert to speak with, it helps to call a series of people
who might be experts and ask them who they would talk with. Typically
the kind of people you will want to interview will be found at
universities, federal laboratories, and non-profit research centers
or think tanks; industry and professional associations; and consulting
firms, federal and state agencies with relevant regulatory jurisdictions
or missions, or trade publications. </P>
<P>
Seek out three experts in the application area. Call these people
and ask: </P>
<UL>
<LI>How are people in the industry currently meeting the related
need? 
<LI>Are people in the industry happy with the way this need is
met? 
<LI>What labor and other resources are required to meet the need?
<LI>How big is the market for products addressing this need in
terms of numbers of units which can be sold? 
<LI>Do people in the industry have a wish list on how they would
like to meet that need? 
<LI>Are they aware of any new products coming out to meet these
needs, and if so, what are they and when are they anticipated
to be introduced? 
<LI>Who are the best people to talk to about coming up to speed
and learning about this area? 
<LI>What publication(s) and trade association(s) are the most
important for people in this area? 
<LI>Who are the leading manufacturers of the current products
which meet the relevant need, what do products commonly cost,
and in what units are they sold? Get names and phone numbers of
contacts if possible. 
</UL>
<P>
Continue calling recommended experts until the answers you are
getting tend to repeat what you have already learned. Typically
this will happen within five to seven interviews. </P>
<HR>
<H3><a name="4.12"></a></P>Quick End User Survey </H3>
<P>
Ultimately, the technology and product must meet the needs of
the end-user or no one will need it very long. The relevant end-users
can be scattered across the <A href="glossary.htm#niche">technology niche</A>.
For example, the above pictures depict occupations which might
all benefit from a new type of optical filtering/amplication device.</P>
<P>
Contact seven end-users considered to be opinion leaders in their
industry. The following questions focus on assessing end-user
needs. </P>
<UL>
<LI>User needs and applications 
<LI>User performance expectations 
<LI>Importance of reliability for users 
<LI>Importance of service and maintainability for users 
<LI>Importance of training for users 
<LI>Importance of price for users 
<LI>Importance of warranties for users 
<LI>User after-sale follow-up preferences 
<LI>Advantages and disadvantages of current products or services
in use 
<LI>Total market size (demand) over the next five years 
</UL>
<P>
In addition to knowing needs, a company commercializing technology
will want to know how to influence end-users to generate demand
for their product. Thus, three additional questions are needed.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Which people and which publications, Internet newsgroups,
etc., are the most important sources of information and advice
for users? 
<LI>What kind of information and analysis do users like to have
when making decisions about what products to use? 
<LI>Who are the early adopters of similar technology among users?
</UL>
<HR>
<H3><a name="4.13"></a></P>Quick Buyers Survey </H3>
<P>
One of the best ways to find out what a company, government agency,
or other organization will buy is to ask the people who are responsible
for purchasing. Since the entire reason for their job is to buy
for their company or agency, they are usually willing to offer
advice on what could make your technology more attractive to their
company or organization.</P> 
<P>
Contact five to seven potential buyers and ask: </P>
<UL>
<LI>What does your organization buy? 
<LI>Who participates in buying decisions and how? 
<LI>What performance specifications and characteristics are they
seeking in technology like yours? 
<LI>How well does your technology meet their needs, and what would
make it better able to meet those needs? 
<LI>What do they typically spend for products like yours, and
what do their budgets for purchasing such products look like over
the next few years? 
<LI>What specific criteria are applied to buying products like
yours, including the lot size of typical purchases? 
<LI>Who is the specific buyer for this kind of product and how
often should you follow-up with them? 
<LI>What type of information should you be ready to provide and
in what kind of formats? 
<LI>Where do they go for information and advice about products
like yours? 
<LI>Do they like to buy direct, through system integrators, or
some other way? 
<LI>What are their delivery and post-sale support preferences?
</UL>
<HR>
<H3><a name="4.14"></a></P>Quick Competitor Survey </H3>
<P>
Getting information on current and potential competitors is a
vital part of market research. Some information can be obtained
from on-line data bases or local, state, and federal agencies.
Local economic development officials can be another good source
of information. But surprisingly, often the best source is the
sale and marketing departments of competitors. Their job is to
tout their company. So long as you do not identify yourself as
a competitor, they generally will discuss current products and
future product plans in the hope that you will buy something.</P>
<P>
Contact the sales department of at least three potential competitors.
Obtain literature on related products to get specifications, characteristics
and prices for these products. Compare your anticipated product
with the competitions' products, with an emphasis on basic performance
and matching user-needs. </P>
<HR>
<H3><a name="4.15"></a></P>Fishing </H3>
<P>
Fishing is a process of seeking information when you are not exactly
sure what it is you are selling or who your customer is. Fishing
involves treating your proposed project as a &quot;strawman&quot;
idea and asking potential customers how to improve it. At no point
in the initial fishing do you actually ask for a contract, although
it is fine to state you are interested in R&amp;D funding. Fishing
is presented as, and should be, strictly exploratory.</P>
<P>
The advantage of fishing is that it enables potential customers
to help you design your R&amp;D project and/or anticipated products
so that the R&amp;D or product better meets the customers' needs.
With each phone call, e-mail, or visit the &quot;strawman&quot;
gets modified and refined. Finally, the process of change slows
down or the suggestions you receive for improving the &quot;strawman&quot;
begin to force you towards versions you have already explored.
At this time you probably are ready to develop a more formal white
paper and address it to those customers for whom it seems most
appropriate. </P>
<HR>
<H3><a name="4.16"></a></P>Capability Statements and Project Descriptions </H3>
<P>
If you are going fishing, you want some bait. Two items constitute
bait: a brief project description and a capability statement.</P>
<P>
The project description is basically a polished version of the
<A href="proposal.htm#7.20">four questions</A>. The <A href="marketr.htm#4.9">development plan</A>
is another good starting point for the project description. </P>
<P>
A capability statement should balance clarity and brevity. A format
for a capability statement is: </P>
<OL>
<LI>One or two introductory paragraphs describing the company's
business, its major products and services, and the manner in which
they are produced and provided. 
<LI>If possible, examples of previous Federal R&amp;D awards or
commercial contracts that provide credibility. Otherwise, provide
a few paragraphs highlighting examples of specific needs that
the company's capabilities can satisfy and reasons why the reader
should be confident you can deliver quality work. If you are new
to the federal R&amp;D market, be sure to add that references
are available upon request. 
<LI>Information on key personnel, highlighting relevant capabilities
and education. 
<LI>A closing paragraph highlighting key selling points the reader
should remember. 
<LI>Some clear indication (letterhead, a footer, a box, etc.)
telling the reader how to write, call, fax, and E-mail to obtain
additional information on the company. 
</OL>
<P>
As the object is to provide information for wide circulation,
do not include proprietary trade, financial, or technical data
in capability statements. If it is necessary to include proprietary
information in any statement or document provided to the Federal
government, be sure it is clearly identified as such. Since each
agency may have somewhat different policies and preferences for
statements, be sure to check out how best to protect your rights
in information and data. (Where a proposal is being submitted,
the Request for Proposal or other proposal preparation instructions
will usually address this topic.) <A NAME="BM4_17"></A>
<HR>
<H3><a name="4.17"></a></P>Where to Fish </H3>
<P>
When you fish, it is best to drop your hook where you are likely
to get a bite. Unfortunately, you often do not know where possible
contract opportunities lie. </P>
<P>
When fishing in a large company or government agency, there typically
is a formal access point for small companies. In companies, the
title is something like &quot;small business liaison&quot; or
&quot;subcontract specialist&quot; or &quot;procurement specialist.&quot;
In government agencies, the formal access point is the Office
of Small and Disadvantaged Business Standards (OSADBU -- a bad
acronym even by Federal government standards.) Whether calling
or writing such access points, be sure to request copies of pertinent
publications and the names, addresses, and phone numbers of program
managers and contracting or procurement officers procuring R&amp;D,
goods, or services similar to what you want to sell. </P>
<P>
OSADBUs can provide, or refer you to, technical program managers,
budget officials, and Contract Officer Representatives. They can,
at times, help you to obtain useful documents such as annual reports
to Congress addressing R&amp;D programs, budget justifications,
other budgetary tracking information (for activity Program Element
Descriptions or PEDs which are used in DoD and DoE to justify
detailed budget requests by program), program announcements and
reviews, listings of recent awards by programs of interest, and
technical reports by awardees. </P>
<P>
All organizations have a second access point: the man or woman
at the top. In a large organization you typically cannot reach
this person, but you can reach their executive assistant or secretary.
While they may not know the precise person you need to speak with,
they do have a good idea of who they would ask to find them. Thus,
you are placed on a chain downward to the likely area where there
is a person who might contract with you.</P> 
<P>
Many people are afraid to call the person at the top of an organization.
Just remember, they typically have a different view than people
further down in a bureaucracy. They most likely are at the top
because they have a drive to succeed. Thus they are also too smart
to be into not-invented-here problems, or affectations of importance.
If you've got something that will help them meet their goals,
they will tell you. If not, they will tell you not to waste your
time. These are honest answers that are invaluable.</P>
<HR>
<H3><a name="4.18"></a></P>Places to Find Out Where to Fish </H3>
<P>
The trick in identifying potential Phase III sources and other
commercial and federal targets is to remember that no one buys
without a need. </P>
<P>
The fishing is usually best with government or corporate program
managers or with commercial buyers. These are people who have
a direct substantive interest in talking with companies developing
or proposing technology under SBIR and STTR. Other people can
provide worthwhile sounding boards as well. In the private sector,
the best sounding boards are typically membership or technical
officials in relevant professional societies and trade associations.
In the government, particularly helpful are Congressional aides
for committees with jurisdiction over R&amp;D in agencies of likely
interest to potential SBIR and STTR competitors. </P>
<P>
Congressional committee aides and staff for your Senators and
Representatives can help you obtain copies of testimony from recent
Congressional hearings dealing with the agency R&amp;D programs
of interest to you. They also can obtain free copies of relevant
reports and studies by three Congressional agencies of particular
interest: the Government Accounting Office, the Office of Technology
Assessment, and the research service of the Library of Congress.</P>
<P>
Another source of assistance is the U.S. Small Business Administration.
SBA field offices are located in cities throughout the United
States. SBA personnel can help companies obtain information on
SBIR and STTR programs, other R&amp;D activities within the region,
procurement regulations, and forthcoming procurement seminars
and conferences. </P>
<P>
In today's world, the Internet is also an excellent place to find
leads for fishing. Search on topics relevant for your interests.
We recommend using both terms describing your technology and terms
describing the potential applications and markets to locate places
for fishing. </P>

<BODY>
<H1>Philip Speser, J.D., Ph.D.</H1>
<H3>President and C.E.O.</H3>
<H3>Foresight Science &amp; Technology Incorporated</H3> 
<H2>EDUCATION</H2>
<P><I>1981: </I>Ph.D., Political Science, State University of New York at
Buffalo.<I>  </I><B>Areas of Emphasis:</B>  Political philosophy, political
economy, public administration, comparative politics (European and Asian).</P>
<P><B>Dissertation:</B> <B>BEYOND THE CITY IN SPEECH.</B> The dissertation
examined the ontological and epistemological premises of different modes
(paradigms) of scientific thought in the context of how research is actually
conducted (i.e., the sociology of science). This exploration provided the
groundwork for an analysis of the utility of the modes in industry and politics.
Modes included classical Greek, Baconian, Hegelian, Marxist, and contemporary
Soviet and East European dissident social science.</P>
<P><I>1980: </I>J.D., cum laude, Law School, State University of New York at
Buffalo.<I>  </I><B>Areas of Emphasis:</B> Corporate tax, American
Constitutional law, philosophy of law.</P>
<P><I>1974: </I>M.A., Political Science, State University of New York at
Buffalo.  <B>Areas of Emphasis:</B> Political philosophy, political economy,
comparative politics (European and Asian).</P>
<P><I>1973: </I>B.A., Political Science and Journalism, Case Western Reserve
University, Cleveland, Ohio<I>.</I>  During undergraduate school Dr. Speser was
a columnist and later Editorial Editor of the Western Reserve <B>OBSERVER.</B></P>
<H2>EMPLOYMENT</H2>
<P><I>Present - 1981:  </I>President and C.E.O., Foresight Science &amp;
Technology.<I> </I></P>
<H2>Corporate Management</H2>
<P>Founder of the company, Dr. Speser handles general corporate management as
well as client services in the areas of technical marketing and
commercialization, technology transfer, government relations, science and
technology policy and program development, and economic development.</P>
<H2>Government Relations</H2>
<P><I>Science &amp; Technology: </I><B> </B>On behalf of clients Dr. Speser
was the lead lobbyist in Congress on the Small Business Innovation Development
Act of 1981, the Federal Technology Transfer Act of 1986, and other R&amp;D
related legislation.  As Executive Director of the National Coalition for
Science and Technology (NCST), he spearheaded lobbying focused on the Senate and
House Budget Committees and ran a highly successful breakfast series which
brought bench scientists, university and corporate R&amp;D executives, and
agency R&amp;D program managers together with key Senators and Congressmen for
small, informal discussions. In cooperation with member societies of NCST,
lobbyists from the university community, and others, he participated in efforts
relating to NSF, DoE, NASA, NIH, NOAA, and other R&amp;D agency authorizations
and appropriations.  Dr. Speser also was actively involved in legislative
initiatives relating to university facilities and equipment. Another well-known
client in this area was the Consortium for Social Science Associations. </P>
<P><I>Historic Preservation: </I>Primarily on behalf of the Society for
American Archaeology, Dr. Speser was active in archaeological, historic, and
environmental preservation matters. He was the lead lobbyist on the Convention
on Cultural Property Implementation Act and other legislation relating to
archaeology and the funding of archeological research and historic preservation
in general. His work also involved agency relations, primarily involving the
Departments of Interior and Agriculture and NSF. He was instrumental in
obtaining new regulations protecting archaeological resources under the Surface
Mining and Reclamation Act. Other well-known clients in this area included the
National Conference of State Historic Preservation Officers and the Garden Club
of America. In 1989, Dr. Speser spun-out Foresight's historic preservation
business as a separate corporation.</P>
<H2>Program Development</H2>
<P><I>Technology Transfer/Commercialization:</I> Dr. Speser has assisted
numerous clients to successfully market technology developed with in-house and
Federal funding. Among technologies worked in are photonics, advanced materials,
biomedical products, pharmaceuticals, construction materials, RF communications,
software, boiler inspection, sterilization equipment, and non-destructive test.
An example of a project is work conducted for AMSCO (American Sterilizer) of
Erie, PA. A team he headed assessed technologies developed by the company's
central corporate lab. From the technologies available, portfolios were
developed which could then be assessed as to their &quot;spin-off&quot;
potential for non-typical markets for this medical devices company. These
portfolios were researched to determine their commercial potential and business
plans prepared for commercialization of the most viable. </P>
<P>State level work has been conducted for Virginia, New York, and Florida.
Under contract to the Center for Innovative Technology of the State of Virginia,
Dr. Speser helped develop a technology transfer program which placed transfer
agents at community colleges throughout the state.  This included research on
program designs and training of technology transfer agents.  </P>
<P>Commercialization work has been conducted for two Federal agencies. Dr.
Speser authored a series of publications on commercializing Federally-funded R&amp;D.
This work was conducted under contract to the National Science Foundation. Under
a grant from the Department of Energy (DoE), he conducted a pilot program on
training awardees on how to commercialize government funded technology. Tasks
included writing and producing The SBIR Commercialization Manual, a training
guide, producing a presentation portfolio with material on awardees' technology
available for commercialization, and conducting a two-day training workshop.</P>
<P>Most of Dr. Speser's technology transfer work for the Federal Government has
been conducted under subcontracts. He led a team that authored a major study of
industry/university centers and prepared a manual on technology transfer under a
subcontract for the Office of Cooperative Environmental Management of the
Environmental Protection Agency. Under subcontract, he served as subject matter
expert on technology transfer and other high technology government policy and
economic development issues for the Agency for International Development. AID
work involved training seminars for visiting dignitaries from Europe, South
America, Asia, and Africa. Under another subcontract, he wrote an introductory
essay and prepared a volume on Research and Development Limited Partnerships for
the Department of Commerce.</P>
<P>Dr. Speser used pro bono company services to staff the Task Force on
National Technology Transfer Policy of the Technology Transfer Society, for
which he was chairperson. Activities included briefings for members of the House
Science &amp; Technology Committee staff, NSF, and others; preparation of
position papers on various issue; and organization and conduct of a national
symposium which brought together senior corporate, academic, and state and
Federal government executives with technology transfer experts to explore
progress in implementing the Technology Transfer Act of 1986 and whether
additional legislation was needed. </P>
<P><I>University/Industry Centers: </I>Dr. Speser participated in the initial
design work for the New York State Centers for Advanced Technology as a
consultant to Governor Hugh Carey's office. Subsequently, as head of a Foresight
team, he prepared a business plan for a university/industry center in medical
instrumentation at the State University of New York at Buffalo under a contract
from the Research Foundation of the State University of New York. A Foresight
team on which he served assisted in raising the initial capital.  The company
assisted Florida Atlantic University in establishing a university/industry
center for packaging and warehousing technology, and in raising private and
Federal funds to support the center. Under contract to Arvida/JMB Partners, he
also designed the institutional infrastructure for the University of North
Florida R&amp;D Park, Jacksonville, FL.  This design included an advanced
technology center, innovation center and minority high technology resource
center. The plan addressed both establishing and operating the centers. As a
consultant to NSF or NSF contractors, he sat on review and/or advisory panels
looking at various center's programs, including the Innovation Centers.  </P>
<H2>Sponsored Research and Publications</H2>
<P>Dr. Speser served, and continues to work as, principal investigator on many
company projects for state and Federal governments, universities, and
corporations. Recent projects include developing an expert system for analysis
of manufacturing production processes and technology transfer in rural
manufacturing companies under a Phase II SBIR award from USDA.  A complete
listing of research reports and publications accompanies this resume. For ten
years he was a Contributing Editor of <B><I>LASER FOCUS WORLD</I></B><I> </I>magazine.</P>
<H2>Technical Marketing / Defense Conversion</H2>
<P>Clients have included large and small companies and universities. Services
provided have ranged from raising R&amp;D funding for specific investigators to
developing strategic alliances based on a specific technological advance to
assisting universities with their grantsmanship programs. He has been
particularly active in the development and deployment of dual-use technologies
and in defense conversion.  Specific technologies he has worked with include
photonics and other light wave technologies, advanced materials, non-destructive
test, scientific instrumentation, test equipment, medical instrumentation,
biotechnology, robotics, navigation systems, advanced software (visualization,
expert systems, etc.), high temperature superconductivity, and geophysical
modeling. Activities have resulted in clients receiving both commercial
contracts and Federal and state government awards. </P>

<h2>Federal R&amp;D Funding </h2>

<p><b>We know that there are great ideas worthy of developing, but we also
know that no matter how good an idea may be, nothing happens without funding.
Finding funding for R&amp;D is a craft we have been honing for over 15
years.</b></p>

<p>If you are interested in obtaining Federal R &amp; D funding, Foresight
can:</p>

<ul>
<li>Assess Your Capabilities </li>

<li>Help You Find The Funding</li>

<li>Train You to Find Additional Funding on Your Own</li>
</ul>

<p>The <i>obvious</i> fact is that no matter how much the Federal Budget
goes up or down, there are always billions of R&amp;D dollars available.
Some of those dollars are in traditional R&amp;D prime contracts and grants.
Others are in special programs. SBIR, Manufacturing Technology, and Energy-Related
Inventions are a few examples. There are yet more available dollars in
subcontracts. Cooperative Research and Development Agreements, and other
partnerships, can provide yet more funding in the form of in-kind contributions.
</p>

<p>What is <i>not obvious </i>is how to find and win this money. Foresight's
network of staff and consultants walk the halls, work the phones and e-mail,
and follow-up to maintain our contacts year round. Timing and follow-up
often make the critical difference where R&amp;D dollars are concerned.
If you cannot conduct the kind of marketing you need in a timely manner,
we may be just the advantage you've been looking for in your quest for
Federal Funding. <a name="approach"></a></p>

<h2>Our Approach for Winning Federal R&amp;D Awards</h2>

<p>Before you spend money for marketing, you deserve to know what will
be done and how. Foresight services are based on the following 10 step
method. </p>

<ul>
<li>Define the research interests and capabilities of the client in cooperation
with the client. Conduct an intellectual property audit if it has not already
been done to insure that intellectual property systems are in place.</li>

<li>Identify the Presidential, Congressional, and Agency priorities as
well as other planned and current initiatives and projects of relevance.
After mapping the priorities, initiatives, and projects into R&amp;D funding
programs, use data bases and other secondary sources to determine the specific
priorities and funding levels for these programs.</li>

<li>Together with the customer, develop a set of &quot;strawman&quot; and
white papers for dissemination to those programs. Help the customer develop
a capability statement and other marketing documents, as necessary.</li>

<li>Contact all programs identified and use the strawmen to identify opportunities
and refine R&amp;D concepts. Determine proposal requirements, funding cycles,
ultimate end-users, etc. Seek information on additional programs to contact.</li>

<li>Revise the strawmen in light of information obtained from funding programs.</li>

<li>To influence funding programs, contact the ultimate end-users and assess
their needs and the timing of their technology introduction cycles. Also
assess if funding is available through them or sources they are aware of.
Determine their willingness to support fund-raising initiative.</li>

<li>Further refine white papers and prepare brief concurrent engineering
documentation for transitioning anticipated R&amp;D results into products
for Federal and, as appropriate, commercial markets.</li>

<li>Conduct market research (including preliminary sales) calls to relevant
programs. Develop R&amp;D funding and product introduction strategies including
the viable targets.</li>

<li>Review the strategies with the client and select a strategy (substantive
R&amp;D and product goals, funding goals, targets, training and information
systems enhancement tasking, timing, etc.)</li>

<li>Implement the strategy together with the client.</li>
</ul>

<p><a name="qual"></a></p>

<H2><I>What are SBIR and STTR?</I> </H2>

<P>The Small Business Innovation Research Program is a three-phased R&amp;D
program, designed to harness the innovative capabilities of small firms
on behalf of the federal government. It seeks to both develop technology
for federal use, and to spur commercialization of that technology. SBIR
consists of two phases of SBIR funding and a third phase of non-SBIR, private
sector or other federal funding. Phase I awards extend for six months and
can be funded for up to $100,000. No more than 33% of an award can be subcontracted.
Phase I awards support research projects to evaluate the scientific and
technical merit and feasibility of an idea. Only those firms that successfully
complete Phase I can compete for Phase II funding, to further develop the
proposed idea. Phase II awards are granted for the construction of an operational
prototype, and to take it to the point of manufacture. Most Phase II awards
are funded for $750,000 or less, and no more than 50% can be subcontracted.
In order to fairly handle the problem of choosing between proposals of
approximately equal scientific and technical merit, where the funds available
to agencies do not permit funding of all proposals, the law mandates that
commitments for follow-on funding from (a) a non-Federal third party or
(b) non-SBIR federal source forPhase III, will be given preference. Phase
III is the stage in which an innovation is brought to market by private
sector investment and support. As noted, no SBIR funds may be used in Phase
III.</P>

<P>The Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) pilot program
is modelled on the SBIR program. Its objective is to encourage technology
transfer through cooperative research between small business concerns and
research institutions. The STTR program has the same three phases as SBIR.</P>

<P>Only small businesses and their non-profit research institution partners
(non-profit institutions, universities or Federally funded research and
development centers) may compete in STTR. Research is to be conducted jointly
by a small business concern and its partner. Not less than 40 percent of
the work must be performed by the small business concern and not less than
30 percent by the nonprofit research institution.</P>

<H2><A NAME="SB"></A><I>What is the definition of a small business?</I>
</H2>

<P>For R&amp;D award purposes, <I>Small business</I> is defined as any
company with 500 or fewer employees. Individual entrepreneurs who form
small companies can qualify.</P>

</UL>

<P>The basic purpose of the Small Business Innovation Development Act was
to strengthen the role of small innovative enterprises in federally-funded
research and development and thus help the nation develop a stronger base
for technical innovation. SBIR combines research and research and development
(R&amp;D) meeting federal government needs with the commercialization of
the ideas funded through federal dollars. </P>

<P>The Act, signed into law in 1982, was re-authorized in fiscal 1986 and
again in fiscal 1992. Since the program was founded in fiscal 1982 to fiscal
1992, SBIR has directed nearly 25,000 awards worth more than $3.2 billion
to thousands of small hi-tech companies. The Act has a sunset clause, meaning
the SBIR program's authorization will expire on October 1, 2000 unless
Congress once more extends it. </P>

<P>The purposes of the most recent reauthorization act, the Small Business
Research and Development Enhancement Act, Public Law 102-564, are: </P>

<UL>
<LI>expand and improve the SBIR Program; </LI>

<LI>emphasize increased private sector commercialization of technology
developed through federal SBIR research and development; </LI>

<LI>increase small business participation in federal research and development;
and </LI>

<LI>improve the federal government's dissemination of information concerning
the SBIR program with regard to participation by women-owned and socially
and economically disadvantaged small business concerns. </LI>
</UL>

<P>The SBIR program is found in <A HREF="glossary.htm#AGCY">ten Federal
agencies</A>, each of which has an extramural budget for R&amp;D in excess
of $100 million. The program is funded by setting aside a set percentage
of the participating agency's extramural R&amp;D contracting dollars during
each fiscal year. Each participating Federal agency will expend with small
businesses not less than 2 percent in fiscal year 1996 and not less than
2.5 percent thereafter. </P>

<P>Through its SBIR program, each agency develops topics and publishes
solicitations describing those topics. Proposals are submitted to the agency
where they are reviewed and evaluated on a competitive basis. Each agency
makes its own awards using contracts, grants, or cooperative agreements.
<A NAME="1.1"></A>
<HR></P>

<H2>SBIR's Three Phases </H2>

<P>Under the law the SBIR program has three phases. </P>

<UL>
<LI><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Phase I </FONT></B><BR>
</LI>

<LI>Phase I awards extend for six months and can be funded for up to $100,000.
Phase I awards support research projects to evaluate the scientific and
technical merit and feasibility of an idea. Only those firms that successfully
complete Phase I can compete for Phase II funding to further develop the
proposed idea. <BR>
Phase I (see <A HREF="SBIRV300000005.html">Flow Chart</A> ) is based on
proposals solicited by participating agencies. These solicitations contain
topics on which small firms are invited to submit proposals. The proposals
describe the results the firm intends to attain, the approach the firm
will take, and how it will prove the feasibility of its approach. Phase
I projects typically run six months. <BR>
<BR>
The object of this phase is to determine the technical feasibility of a
proposed project and the performance quality the small firm can provide.
Phase I enables the agency to address these questions with relatively small
agency investment, thereby increasing the efficiency with which Federal
R&amp;D dollars in Phase II are utilized. <BR>
</LI>

<LI><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Phase II </FONT></B><BR>
</LI>

<LI>Phase II awards further develop the Phase I idea for one or two years.
Most Phase II awards are funded for $750,000 or less in order to fairly
handle the problem of choosing between proposals of approximately equal
scientific and technical merit. Where the funds available to agencies do
not permit funding all proposals, the law mandates commitments for follow-up
funding from a non-Federal third party for Phase III will be given preference.<BR>
The objective of Phase II is to create a prototype. Up to 50% of an award
can be subcontracted out to accomplish Phase II work. Phase II projects
typically run two years.<BR>
Only firms which have successfully completed Phase I can compete for Phase
II awards. Phase II awards are based on the results of Phase I, technical
merit, Agency priority, and commercial applications. <BR>
<BR>
</LI>

<LI><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Phase III </FONT></B><BR>
</LI>

<LI>Phase III is the stage in which an innovation is brought to market
through private sector investment and support. Phase III is conducted by
the small business (either alone or thorough joint-ventures, partnerships,
or strategic alliances) to pursue commercial applications of the R&amp;D
conducted in Phases I and II. No SBIR funds may be used in Phase III. <BR>
Non- Federal funds, including those obtained through exercising follow-on
funding commitments, are emphasized in Phase III. Phase III, however, may
also involve follow-on non-SBIR funded R&amp;D or production contracts
with a Federal agency for products or processes intended for use by the
U.S. Government. Because the production contract is a follow-on to a competitive
SBIR award, the production contract is considered to be a competitive award
under the Competition in Contracting Act. No new competition is required.
</LI>
</UL>

<P><A NAME="1.2"></A>
<HR></P>

<H2>Who Can Participate in the SBIR Program? </H2>

<P>Any <A HREF="glossary.htm#SB">small business</A> can participate in
the SBIR program. This includes sole proprietorships, partnerships, joint
ventures, associations or cooperatives. Non-profit organizations are not
eligible. The <A HREF="glossary.htm#PI">Principal Investigator (PI)</A>
must spend more than one-half of his or her time employed by the firm receiving
the award. </P>

<P>During Phase I, a minimum of two-thirds of the research and/or analytical
effort must be performed by the proposing firm. The rest may be used for
consulting or subcontractors. During Phase II, no more than one-half can
be used for consultants or subcontractors.</P>

<h2>The Three Phases of STTR</h2>
<P>The objective of the Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR)
pilot program is to encourage technology transfer through cooperative research
between small businesses and research institutions. Modeled on SBIR, the
STTR program also has three phases. </P>

<P>Only small businesses and their non-profit <A HREF="glossary.htm#inst">research
institution</A> partners may compete in STTR. Not less than 40 percent
of the work must be performed by the small business concern and not less
than 30 percent by the nonprofit research institution. Research institutions
must be either non-profit institutions or Federally funded research and
development centers (FFRDC). </P>

<P><A HREF="overv2.htm#2.4">STTR participating agencies</A> are authorized
to expend not less than 0.05 percent of their budget in FY 1994, 0.1 percent
in FY 1995, and 0.15 percent in FY 1996. </P>

<P>Each Federal agency participating in STTR releases an STTR Program solicitation
annually. The solicitation states research or research and development
topics and subtopic areas that are consistent with agency needs and missions.
The topics must be sufficiently comprehensive to provide a wide range of
opportunity for qualified small business concerns to compete in STTR. </P>

<P><B>STTR's Phase I </B></P>

<P>Phase I determines the scientific, technical, and commercial merit and
feasibility of the proposed cooperative effort and the quality of performance
by the small business awardee and its partner. Once again a relatively
small Federal agency investment is made prior to consideration of further
Federal support at the Phase II level. The normal period of performance
for Phase I is approximately one year and awards generally do not exceed
$100,000. Proposals are evaluated on a competitive basis. </P>

<P><B>STTR's Phase II </B></P>

<P>Phase II continues the research or research and development effort from
Phase I. Only successful STTR Phase I awardees are eligible to participate
in Phase II. The normal period of performance for Phase II is approximately
two years and awards generally do not exceed $500,000. </P>

<P><B>STTR's Phase III </B></P>

<P>Phase III involves commercial applications of STTR funded research or
research and development. It is funded by non-Federal sources or awards
from non-STTR Federal funding sources. The competition for Phase I and
Phase II STTR satisfies any competition requirements of the Competition
in Contracting Act with respect to follow-on procurement. </P>

<P>
<HR></P>

<H2><A NAME="1.4"></A>Obtaining SBIR and STTR Solicitations </H2>

<P>Agencies develop special bidders lists for SBIR and STTR. <A HREF="http://www.sbaonline.sba.gov/Research_And_Development/otagency.html">On-line
solicitations </A>are available through the SBA's web site. To receive
a hard copy of a solicitation, you must contact the appropriate office
for each agency The SBIR and STTR points of contact follow. If an agency
has an STTR program, it is noted in the text. For information on the research
activities of each agency, click on the name of the agency. </P>

<P>The <A HREF="http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/sbir/">Defense Technical Information
Center </A>(DTIC) provides information packets focused on specific DoD
SBIR topics. This information enables the recipients to make better informed
bid/no bid decisions and prepare stronger proposals. Organizations responding
to DoD SBIR solicitations are encouraged to contact DTIC for background
technical information packages (TIPS) that are prepared for most current
SBIR topics. The principal component of a TIP is an annotated bibliography
of the technical reports that have resulted from prior DoD research in
areas related to the solicitation topic. TIPs also may include specific
input from the DoD organization responsible for the topic. Copies of the
technical reports cited in the TIPs are available from DTIC. There is no
charge for basic service under this program, which includes a reasonable
number of technical reports. </P>

<P>The objective of the Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR)
pilot program is to encourage technology transfer through cooperative research
between small businesses and research institutions. Modeled on SBIR, the
STTR program also has three phases. </P>

<P>Only small businesses and their non-profit <A HREF="glossary.htm#inst">research
institution</A> partners may compete in STTR. Not less than 40 percent
of the work must be performed by the small business concern and not less
than 30 percent by the nonprofit research institution. Research institutions
must be either non-profit institutions or Federally funded research and
development centers (FFRDC). </P>

<P><A HREF="overv2.htm#2.4">STTR participating agencies</A> are authorized
to expend not less than 0.05 percent of their budget in FY 1994, 0.1 percent
in FY 1995, and 0.15 percent in FY 1996. </P>

<P>Each Federal agency participating in STTR releases an STTR Program solicitation
annually. The solicitation states research or research and development
topics and subtopic areas that are consistent with agency needs and missions.
The topics must be sufficiently comprehensive to provide a wide range of
opportunity for qualified small business concerns to compete in STTR. </P>

<P><B>STTR's Phase I </B></P>

<P>Phase I determines the scientific, technical, and commercial merit and
feasibility of the proposed cooperative effort and the quality of performance
by the small business awardee and its partner. Once again a relatively
small Federal agency investment is made prior to consideration of further
Federal support at the Phase II level. The normal period of performance
for Phase I is approximately one year and awards generally do not exceed
$100,000. Proposals are evaluated on a competitive basis. </P>

<P><B>STTR's Phase II </B></P>

<P>Phase II continues the research or research and development effort from
Phase I. Only successful STTR Phase I awardees are eligible to participate
in Phase II. The normal period of performance for Phase II is approximately
two years and awards generally do not exceed $500,000. </P>

<P><B>STTR's Phase III </B></P>

<P>Phase III involves commercial applications of STTR funded research or
research and development. It is funded by non-Federal sources or awards
from non-STTR Federal funding sources. The competition for Phase I and
Phase II STTR satisfies any competition requirements of the Competition
in Contracting Act with respect to follow-on procurement. </P>

<P>No-one &quot;gets rich&quot; doing SBIR and STTR research. The primary
advantage of SBIR and STTR is that they allow a company to enter the marketplace
with most of the product development costs paid for by the Government.
Accordingly, we recommend that you think about commercialization prior
to even looking for SBIR solicitation topics to bid. </P>

<P>SBIR enables a company is able to use low ball pricing and other tactics
which would not be feasible if it had to cover the entire R&amp;D expense
itself. It enters with a cost flexibility that allows it to rapidly make
commercial profits. </P>

<P>Commercialization is the process of bringing new technology into the
hands of end-users for a profit. Commercialization primarily involves solving
a challenging marketing problem. In commercialization, &quot;solutions&quot;
are chasing &quot;problems.&quot; Final R&amp;D and product engineering
cannot be conducted until one or more end-users who are likely to pay for
the technology are identified. Only then can the final product specifications
be developed, the technology turned into something useful in specific applications,
and sold. </P>

<P>The maturity of the technology and how it intersects with needs in the
market place will have a major impact on what commercialization strategies
are viable. </P>

<P><IMG SRC="commerc.gif" HEIGHT=742 WIDTH=524> </P>

<P>
<HR></P>

<H3><A NAME="3.1"></A>Deciding What Commercialization Means to You </H3>

<P>Every commercialization effort begins with a decision about what may
be sold. Will only products and services based on the technology be sold,
or can rights to the <A HREF="glossary.htm#intell">intellectual property</A>
the technology represents also be sold? Can all rights to the technology
be sold, or can the technology only be licensed? Will only one invention
or one technology be commercialized, or can inventions and technologies
be packaged and commercialized as a portfolio? What about selling equity
in the company on the grounds that the technology has substantially increased
the value of shares? </P>

<P>Making a decision about the stage at which you sell your technology
or company is one half of establishing what can be sold. The other half
is clarifying that you have a right to sell it. After all, you can only
sell what you own. A legal audit of your intellectual property rights in
your technology is a prudent action prior to any commercialization effort.
Rights to the technology may have to be shared if consultants, cooperative
R&amp;D partners, or subcontractors helped develop the technology. Even
if the technology was developed entirely in-house, the company's ability
to exploit its R&amp;D results may be limited by patents or copyrights
belonging to others. </P>

<P>Another threshold issue for commercialization is what, if any, involvement
a company wants to maintain with the technology in the future. Does the
company want to exclusively commercialize the technology? Does the company
want to actively participate in further developing the technology but not
require exclusivity? Does the company want to actively participate with
others in the manufacturing of products or provision of services based
on the technology? Does the company want to actively participate in the
marketing of products based on the technology? Does the company want to
&quot;cash out&quot; its investment in the technology in the near future?
Does the company want to sell equity in the company? </P>

<P>
<HR></P>

<H3><A NAME="3.1a"></A>Legal Methods for Structuring Commercialization
</H3>

<P>There are five broad categories of commercialization methods:</P>

<OL>
<LI><B>Sales</B> consist of the transfer of products and services in exchange
for payment. In a sale, all rights (complete ownership) of the product
or the result of the services usually are transferred in exchange for a
fixed payment. </LI>

<LI><B>Licenses</B> consist of the transfer of the right to use or manufacture
the technology in exchange for payment. In distinction to sales, licenses
do not usually involve transfer of all the owner's rights. Payments (royalties)
are commonly tied to the extent to which the technology is used or sold
by the licensee, and thus are not fixed. </LI>

<LI><B>Joint or Cooperative R&amp;D</B> may involve a transfer of money
and/or services and research results by the commercialization target to
your company. All partners to the project commonly participate in the actual
conduct of the R&amp;D. The intellectual property resulting from the cooperative
R&amp;D is frequently the joint property of all the participants in the
cooperative R&amp;D project. </LI>

<LI><B>Joint Ventures </B>are independent businesses involving your company
and the commercialization target. As with cooperative R&amp;D, the funding
source may provide cash and/or in-kind contributions to the joint venture.
All participants receive an equity interest in the joint venture. The venture
may have a variety of legal forms, including being incorporated or established
as a partnership. The venture may be restricted to a narrow function, such
as the manufacture or distribution of products, or be unlimited in its
activities. </LI>

<LI><B>Purchases of equity </B>in your company involves the transfer of
ownership or potential ownership in the company in exchange for payment.
Payment is usually in money, although exchanges of stock are also common
when the purchase is being made by a large company. </LI>
</OL>

<P>The advantages and disadvantages of each mechanism for your company
depends on the character of involvement your company wants to retain with
the technology after the completion of your federally-funded work and the
nature of the technical, market, and financial risk your company wants
to bear. </P>

<P>It should be noted that debt financing can be tied into all of the above
mechanisms. For example, as part of a sales agreement, cooperative research
project, or joint venture, a large firm may loan your company the funds
needed to perform additional R&amp;D and final product engineering. Equity
investments may combine stock purchases with loans or take the form of
convertible debentures. 
<HR></P>

<H3><A NAME="3.2"></A>Deciding How Bad You Want a Deal </H3>

<P>The transition from market research to selling involves developing two
sets of criteria for contracts. One set of criteria should represent your
best possible Phase III funding commitment. The other set should represent
the minimum you can accept. The key issue for the minimum set is how much
(equity, intellectual property, product) you will give up for how little
(cash, in-kind support) in return. </P>

<P>Because a successful commercialization effort requires the active participation
of senior company managers, both sets of criteria should be the result
of a consensus building process among the relevant decision-makers. One
method for driving to a consensus is to conduct a brainstorming session
to develop possible criterion and then examine the options through an Advantages,
Limitations, Uncertainty (ALU) analysis. During the brainstorming part
of the meeting, participants should be encouraged to generate as many criteria
as possible -- no matter how seemingly silly. Quantity, not quality should
be sought. </P>

<P>Once generated, these options can be subjected to an ALU examination.
In an ALU analysis, each criterion is written on a board. Underneath, three
columns are made with headings of Advantages, Limitations, and Uncertainties.
(Uncertainties refer to issues which cannot be resolved without further
data.) The group judges the criterion, with each person's comments being
placed under one of the three categories. If a consensus does not emerge
during the ALU examination, potentially competing criteria can be paired
with each other and ranked. At that point the final decisions can be made
by the relevant manager or by the Board. </P>

<P>These criteria are then used while developing the objectives for the
marketing team responsible for obtaining the Phase III commitment. Evaluating
progress towards a contract containing the best possible terms becomes
a key task during management reviews of the marketing team. </P>

<P>
<HR></P>

<H3><A NAME="3.3"></A>Building a Commercialization Team </H3>

<P>Commercialization efforts should begin before R&amp;D ends. To avoid
gaps in revenues between the end of Federal R&amp;D support and the start
of private sector funding, it is imperative to start marketing early. Our
experience in assisting companies with commercialization suggests that
it can take between one month and one year of steady, vigorous effort to
sell, license, or otherwise commercialize a technology. How much time it
takes depends on what stage of the R&amp;D process the technology is at,
the goals and strategies of the small company developing the technology,
and the goals, strategies, and operations of individuals, companies, or
organizations being approached as the targets for commercialization. </P>

<P>
<HR></P>

<H3><A NAME="3.4"></A>Marketing is a people business. </H3>

<P>Opportunities are found by people. Sales are made by people talking
and working with other people. Accordingly, the first step in commercializing
technology is to determine who should be responsible for finding and obtaining
the funding commitment. No one person can know everything or be excellent
at everything. In order to provide for a mix of knowledge-based and communication
skills in the commercialization effort, most companies establish a team
to pursue commercialization. </P>

<P>Five specialties are important for the team which will carry technology
into the commercial market: technical, marketing, financial, legal, and
management. Ideally, each of these specialties should be represented by
a different individual in order to ensure that all the necessary skills
and perspectives are available within the team. These five people can build
on each others ideas during brainstorming sessions about potential applications.
Having a minimum of five people on the team also increases the odds that
the team will have the writing, telephone, and good face-to-face skills
it needs to make persuasive sales presentations. The existence of complementary
skills and perspectives has the added advantage of encouraging a healthy
debate over all aspects of the commercialization effort. </P>

<P>Of course, marketing is not free. If your company is small it may not
have these specialists on your payroll. For such companies it may be prudent
to have one person wear several hats. </P>

<P>Where crucial skills are lacking, small companies may want to hire one
or two consultants. Even if your company does have all these specialists,
staff allocations (or consultants' fees) should be balanced against the
anticipated return-on-investment from the marketing effort. The staff resources
devoted to seeking commercialization should be commensurate with the amount
of funding you will be seeking. A multi-million dollar goal deserves more
staff time than a $500,000 goal. </P>

<P>Top management should provide the commercialization team with nine fundamental
guidelines: </P>

<OL>
<LI>criteria concerning what funding levels, performance requirements,
and other considerations must be in the contract; </LI>

<LI>how much staff time and how many dollars can be devoted to the commercialization
effort; </LI>

<LI>if any, activities are forbidden or must take place during the commercialization
effort; </LI>

<LI>procedures and forms for making and documenting contact with outsiders,
especially targets, during the commercialization effort; </LI>

<LI>definition of how much information may be revealed about the technology
and the company both before and after non-disclosure agreements are in
place; </LI>

<LI>who may negotiate contracts and how much authority they will have in
these negotiations; </LI>

<LI>who is in charge of the commercialization team and to whom the team
reports; </LI>

<LI>milestones for the periodic review of the commercialization effort;
</LI>

<LI>bonus and other incentives for obtaining the funding. </LI>
</OL>

<P>To ensure that these fundamental guidelines are clear and understood,
they should be provided to the team in writing. </P>

<P>
<HR></P>

<H3><A NAME="3.5"></A>Planning for Growth </H3>

<P>If a company does transition into Phase III, a new set of problems emerge,
especially where the company is seeking to transition from R&amp;D into
manufacturing. </P>

<P>New employees and consultants will have to be brought on board. These
people will have to be taught the company's culture to be effective team
members. However, if the company only performs R&amp;D at present and if
it wants to manufacture, distribute, and/or sell products as part of its
growth, in order to reconcile different personality types and job orientations,
management will have to consciously modify the company culture to ensure
that all jobs are respected and valued. </P>

<P>As staff builds, management will have to balance training and upward
career mobility opportunities for current staff with the company's need
to hire outsiders with proven track records in functions not currently
performed. Hiring outsiders or providing training are the only ways to
avoid potentially disastrous learning curves in key positions. Hiring can
create tensions among earlier employees who have their own career and advancement
expectations. As part of the resulting balancing act, many companies establish
dual career hierarchies -- one for staff who wish to remain in technical
jobs and one for staff interested in managerial positions. </P>

<P>One of the most frustrating people problems is the inability of the
company's founder to function effectively as the firm grows. Owner/entrepreneurs
fulfill a variety of functions in a small company. Growth often demands
a radical shift in management style, one in which the entrepreneur must
increasingly delegate authority and allow activities to be routinized.
Many owner/entrepreneurs find this change in style difficult to make. If
you are an owner/entrepreneur with this problem, there are only two options:
either hire a manager to run the company or force yourself to adapt. </P>

<HR></P>

<H3>The most important part of marketing is follow-up. </H3>

<P>In any market, personal contact and repeated follow-up are important
for obtaining information on R&amp;D and other sales opportunities and
for keeping momentum moving towards a sale. Personal contact can be by
phone, fax, e-mail, or visit, although a visit is usually best as it is
easier to communicate in person. </P>

<P>The first objective of personal visits or telecommunications contact
is to obtain detailed information about customer objectives, plans, funding
levels, and priorities. Such information is helpful for drafting more responsive
proposals and bids. A second objective is to build confidence among program
managers and contracting officials about the small company's ability to
perform high quality R&amp;D and deliver a high quality product on time
at the right cost. </P>

<P>As follow-up takes place with program managers and contracting officers
in the government (or small business liaisons, technical specialists, and
buyers in the private sector) the company should expand its range of contacts
to include other personnel. The purpose of these additional contacts is
to obtain information from other people involved in setting solicitation
topics or program agendas, developing evaluation criteria, determining
procedures and timing of procurements, implementing small business set-asides,
and so forth. </P>

<P><A NAME="5.1"></A>
<HR></P>

<H3>Making Serendipity </H3>

<P>You can never anticipate everything. So SBIR/STTR marketing and commercialization
efforts are beset with unforeseen problems and opportunities. Often, on
short notice, you need to find someone who can help you figure out how
to manufacture a product or who can explain how performance specifications
highlighted in interviews relate to an application. A key part of fishing
is to increase the likelihood that you can get help when you need it. </P>

<P>We encourage extensive networking to stimulate serendipity. Networking
opportunities include programs sponsored by universities, professional
societies, and trade and industry organizations as well as serving on government
R&amp;D program advisory and review panels. </P>

<P>Networking in your local community is as important as via national organizations
because it is easier to build &quot;business&quot; friendships when there
is substantial face-to-face contact. These friendships can then be tapped
to get to national experts and customers when needed. Economic development
organizations, participation in cooperative R&amp;D with local universities,
and civic work are some of the ways to network locally. </P>

<P>At the local level, business organizations, especially C.E.O. &quot;roundtables&quot;
and venture capital forums, are particularly important. There is much you
can learn from talking with people who have had to face problems similar
to the ones you are addressing. Further, the contacts you make can be invaluable
during commercialization. </P>

<P>Ultimately, all marketing is a people business. It is people who buy
or invest. So the best way to get people to buy or invest in your technology
is to get to know people who might be interested in buying or investing.
Mid-level federal program managers and C.E.O.s of mid-sized family owned
firms are terrific from this perspective. These individuals usually have
access to substantial funds and have the ability to make decisions concerning
their use. </P>

<P><A NAME="5.2"></A>
<HR></P>

<H3>Obtaining a Phase III Funding Source </H3>

<P>Business relationships need time to grow. As strategic alliances become
increasingly important in high technology, it is to your advantage to find
lower risk, lower cost ways for potential partners and customers to get
involved with your company prior to requesting a contract or capital investment.
</P>

<P>Ideally, initial contacts should take place prior to the submission
of an R&amp;D proposal. Such contacts should be with technical and marketing
personnel from manufacturers, distributors, and end-users within your technology
niche. These contacts can be brief. All that is required is a short telephone
discussion about what performance specifications would be seen as most
desirable from their standpoint and whom your company should coordinate
with to maintain a liaison. </P>

<P>Also important to discuss with technical personnel is whether they can
see ways in which their company can help support your R&amp;D. Larger companies
are interested in mechanisms which offer &quot;a window on new technology.&quot;
Such companies may be willing to loan staff to help review proposals, to
conduct cooperative R&amp;D (in which each party will commonly pay its
own costs), or make equipment and facilities available. Part of this cooperation
may include a test of your technology by the larger company. </P>

<P>In structuring relationships with partners, be very clear at the onset
just what each party will be doing, over what period, and with whose money.
Also imperative is to clarify how any rights in intellectual property developed
in the course of the relationship will be treated. These matters should
be worked out at a management level if anything more than assistance with
proposal preparation is contemplated. If cooperative research is anticipated,
it is useful to establish a steering committee with R&amp;D managers from
both organizations to handle matters. </P>

<P>The most important mechanism for relationships with potential funding
sources is personnel exchanges. Sending your people to work at the other
organization's or company's facility or bringing staff from that company
or organization into your lab allows people to build mutual respect and
trust. It provides your company with insight into the product development
and marketing strategies of your larger partner. It also enables you to
develop a cadre of advocates in the potential partner who can be called
upon to help when you do seek a more binding commitment. </P>

<P>Throughout any cooperative effort, it is vital that you take vigorous
steps to protect your proprietary interest in your technology. Discussions
should be preceded, whenever possible, by the signing of confidentiality
agreements. All reports and data provided to the larger company should
be clearly marked as confidential and proprietary to your company. Steps
should be taken to <A HREF="glossary.htm#pat">patent</A>, <A HREF="glossary.htm#copy">copyright</A>,
and/or protect by <A HREF="glossary.htm#TS">trade secret</A> inventions,
software, and documents. </P>

<P>When fishing, it helps to have a basic idea of a company's or agency's
programs and priorities and of their prior technical work. Government and
corporate officials are busy. Thus, the importance of company's using published
material to familiarize with each agency's programs, operations, and priorities,
cannot be over-emphasized. In this manner, the small company's representatives
can avoid asking basic questions and focus on stimulating a two-way flow
of information on technical issues and/or on areas not covered in published
material. Two-way flows of information make the meeting productive for
all participants and make government employees more willing to chat with
the company a second time. </P>

<P>A number of U.S. Government agencies provide access to information useful
for market research. This information typically is provided at little or
no cost. </P>

<P><A NAME="6.1"></A>
<HR></P>

<H3>National Technical Information Service </H3>

<P>The <A HREF="http://www.fedworld.gov/ntis/">National Technical Information
Service</A> (NTIS) is a self-supporting agency within the Department of
Commerce that makes available to the public the results of research and
development and other information produced by or for the U.S. Government,
other domestic sources, and foreign sources. </P>

<P>Products include technical reports, periodicals, databases, software,
and on-line services. A characteristic of the information available from
NTIS is that it has not been published commercially and is not generally
available from any other source. </P>

<P>The NTIS collection exceeds two million works, most of which are in
its electronic database. The collection covers technology, scientific and
technical information, current events, business and management studies,
translations of foreign reports, foreign and domestic trade, general statistics,
environment and energy, health and the social sciences, and hundreds of
other areas. </P>

<P>All NTIS materials are permanently available. When Government agencies
and their contractors submit reports and other items to NTIS, they are
entered into the NTIS computerized bibliographic database. The database
can be accessed through a number of commercial on-line vendors, which are
listed in the free <I>NTIS 1994 Catalog of Products and Services</I>. To
obtain a catalog, call (703) 487-4650 or (703) 487-4800 and ask for PR-827.
</P>

<P>NTIS also provides technology transfer services such as patent licensing,
business partnerships, and technology descriptions. Its <A HREF="http://www.ntis.gov/fedrip.htm">FEDRIP</A>
(Federal Research in Progress) database includes advance information on
some 150,000 research projects currently under way. Its <I>Published Searches</I>
bibliographies provide the most recent data on specific topics from an
individual database source. </P>

<P>The updated <I>Directory of Federal Laboratory and Technological Resources,</I>
summarizes 1,900 unique resources organized within 70 subject areas. The
<I>Directory </I>enables you to better access opportunities with some 650
Federal laboratory technology transfer offices, and 150 specialized information
centers. The <I>Directory </I>costs $65 within the U.S. To order call (703)
487-4650 and ask for PB93-100097/CAU. </P>

<P>Other technology transfer publications include the annual <I>Catalog

<H3>FedWorld </H3>

<P><A HREF="http://www.fedworld.gov/">FedWorld</A> is NTIS's electronic
marketplace of U.S. and foreign Government information. It connects the
public to more than 130 U.S. Government computer systems that contain databases,
programs, and press releases. It also provides the latest information about
NTIS products and services that can be searched and downloaded. Access
is free of charge. To connect, call (703) 321-8020. For more information,
call (703) 487-4608. FedWorld is also available via Internet. </P>

<P>More than 200 U.S. Government agencies contribute to the NTIS collection.
These include the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the Environmental
Protection Agency, the National Institute of Standards and Technology,
the National Institutes of Health, National Science Foundation, and the
Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Defense, Energy, Health and Human
Services, Interior, and Transportation. NTIS adds more than 70,000 new
titles each year to its collection of more than two million. </P>

<P>NTIS has established important marketing partnerships with federal agencies
in growing areas such as international trade, health care and medicine,
and the environment. Superfund documents distribution is centralized by
EPA through NTIS. The Food and Drug Administration has placed numerous
products with NTIS for sale; an example is the 1994 Food Code. A FedWorld<I>
</I>subsystem contains the Department of Labor Davis-Bacon Wage Determination
database. For the past seven years, NTIS has assisted the National Library
of Medicine (NLM) by providing production and distribution for <I>Grateful
Med</I> software. </P>

<H3>Federal International Market Research Tools </H3>

<P>Often information on foreign markets and competition is important for
assessing the viability of a development plan. NTIS is the leading U.S.
Government agency in international technical and business information exchange.
It actively acquires and distributes information produced by a large number
of foreign government departments and other overseas organizations. </P>

<P>NTIS has responded to the rapid changes in the world trading environment
by targeting regions with exceptional promise. Information dissemination
specialties cover three regions and more will be added. A bibliography
of more than 2,000 export-related reports was prepared by the International
Trade Administration of the U.S. Department of Commerce and released via
NTIS. </P>

<P>Market intelligence on Central and Eastern Europe is available as part
of a partnership with the Department of Commerce's Eastern Europe Business
Information Center. To obtain a catalog of Legal Text Service of Central

<H3>Defense Technical Information Center </H3>

<P>The <A HREF="http://www.doc.dtic.dla.mil/">Defense Technical Information
Center</A> (DTIC) is located in Alexandria, VA. DTIC services are only
available to Department of Defense (DoD) or other agency contractors and
potential contractors and Government agencies. DTIC supplies technical
reports of completed DoD R&amp;D efforts as well as summaries of ongoing
R&amp;D projects. The DTIC technical document collection totals nearly
two million titles, covering all areas of science and technology. </P>

<P>The major component of the DTIC databases is the collections of summaries
comprising the Work Unit Information System (WUIS). This database covers
the who, what, when, where and how of on-going, Defense-sponsored, R&amp;D
efforts. Included in the database is a description of each effort including:
purpose, funding, costs and activities responsible. </P>

<P>As the central DoD Scientific and Technical Information Service Center,
DTIC receives defense-related reports with classifications ranging from
Unclassified up to Secret. DTIC's responsibility includes processing, announcing,
storing, and distributing these reports. To make them available to organizations
not qualified for access to DTIC and to the general public, DTIC shares
all unclassified/unlimited reports (some 53% percent of all its accessions)
with the U.S. Department of Commerce National Technical Information Service
(NTIS), where they are made available for sale. </P>

<P>Organizations registered with DTIC have access to a variety of products
and services, most provided at minimal cost. As examples: the service charge
for paper copies of technical reports is $6.00 for reports up to 100 pages;
larger reports cost an additional $0.10 for each page over 100 pages. Microfiche
copies of reports are $4.00 each. The technical abstracts database on CD-ROM
is available for a $600 annual subscription, which includes four updates.
</P>

<P>DTIC has a variety of <A HREF="http://www.doc.dtic.dla.mil/dtic/digest/digest95-3/internet_resources.html">Internet
resources</A> available. The Defense Technical Information Center (DTIC)
is now providing access to information about the Department of Defense
(DoD) and information of interest to DoD through the World Wide Web (WWW).
DTIC's new service is called the <A HREF="http://www.dtic.dla.mil/dtiw/">Defense
Technical Information Web</A>, and provides a starting point for accessing
DoD information, including the new DTIC Home Page and a host of other DTIC
developed information sources.</P>

<P>Organizations having active contracts, subcontracts and grants from
U.S. Government agencies may obtain access to DTIC information services
by completing the necessary registration forms. These forms are reviewed
and approved by their Government sponsors prior to approval by DTIC. Organizations
not having current contracts but with adequate research and development
capabilities can also gain access to DoD scientific and technical information
from DTIC after certification under one or more of the Potential Contractor
Programs operated within each of the military services and the Advanced
Research Projects Agency (ARPA). </P>

<P>To register for DTIC services: </P>

<OL>
<LI>Request a registration kit. The materials in the kit will include the
necessary forms and instructions for registering and will assist you in
determining your eligibility for services. </LI>

<LI>Complete the DD Form 1540 in the kit. One should be filled out for
each contract or grant. </LI>

<LI>Forward the completed form(s) to the responsible officer within the
DoD/Federal agency sponsoring your organization's contracts or grants.
</LI>

<LI>Non-Federal applicants must also be certified by the Defense Logistics
Services Center(DLSC) to be eligible to receive Unclassified - limited-distribution
data. Complete the DD form 2345, Military Critical Technical Data Agreement
(included in the registration kit) and forward to DLSC. Information on
procedures necessary to be qualified to receive Secret documents is included
in the registration kit. When DTIC receives the completed and certified
forms, a User Code number is assigned and a need-to-know profile established.

<H3>Information on U.S. Companies </H3>

<P>There are two agencies that are probably the best sources of information
concerning U.S. companies: the Security and Exchange Commission (SEC),
and the International Trade Administration (ITA) of the Department of Commerce.
</P>

<P>The SEC maintains a library of corporate 10-K filings for all publicly
traded companies. These filings contain information on company priorities,
plans, and expenditures -- including R&amp;D. While the information can
be pursued by going to Washington, DC, probably the best way to view it
is via dial-up to a commercial data base vendor like DIALOG or over <A HREF="http://www.sec.gov/edgarhp.htm">Internet</A>.
</P>

<P>The ITA has desks for industry sectors and geographic regions. The industry
desks are responsible for preparing the U.S. Industrial Outlook<I>. </I>These
individuals are valuable sources of insight into sector trends and can
network you into independent experts, associations, and company spokespersons.
(The geographic desks are good sources for international information. The
U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service is also run by ITA.) </P>

</P>

<P>When a company has technology which is just emerging from R&amp;D and
not yet ready for commercial introduction, additional capital may be needed
to conduct production engineering, market research and entry, or workforce
training. </P>

<P>Different sources for funds are typically tapped depending on the stage
of a company's growth. </P>

<P>Zero stage or start-up funding is commonly obtained from family members,
friends, and local informal investors or &quot;angels.&quot; Second stage
and subsequent funding may be obtained through mechanisms such as research
and development limited partnerships or from venture capital companies.
As the commercial success of a company is demonstrated, bank and commercial
bond debt becomes increasingly viable as a source of funds. </P>

<P>Regardless of the kind of outside investment being sought, companies
can increase their likelihood of success through four activities: </P>

<OL>
<LI><A HREF="property.htm#7.37">auditing intellectual property</A>; </LI>

technology</A>; and, </LI>

<LI><A HREF="#7.1">developing financial projections</A>. </LI>
</OL>

<P>There is a bonus in conducting intellectual property audits, undertaking
preliminary market research, forming development plans, and engaging in
financial planning. These four activities force you to make your assumptions
about, and procedures in, your business explicit. They require you to consider
the likely results of your actions. Understanding the implicit assumptions
and procedures in your business is one of the keys to business success.
</P>

<P>Financial projections, market assessments, and development plans, provide
the building blocks for business plans. <A NAME="7.1"></A>
<HR></P>

<H3>Financial Projections </H3>

<P>Developing financial projections involves pulling together the results
of market research, development plans, and other cost data to produce four
items: cash budgets, pro forma statements, capital investment analyses
and capital source studies. Most investors want financial projections that
run five years into the future. </P>

<P>Cash budgets should be projected for at least the first year. They should
combine: </P>

<UL>
<LI>expected sales revenues, </LI>

<LI>cash receipts, </LI>

<LI>material, labor and overhead expenses and, </LI>

<LI>cash disbursements on a monthly basis. </LI>
</UL>

<P>This permits anticipation of fluctuations in the level of cash and planning
for short term borrowing and investment. </P>

<P>Pro forma statements should include both income statements and balance
sheets. These should be projected quarterly for at least the first three
years, although many investors will ask for pro forma statements for five
years. The statements combine: </P>

<UL>
<LI>expected sales and other revenues; </LI>

<LI>production, marketing, and administrative expenses; </LI>

<LI>product, market, or process investments; and, </LI>

<LI>loans from suppliers, banks, or investment companies. </LI>
</UL>

<P>Pro forma statements permit you to anticipate the financial results
of your operations and to plan intermediate term borrowing and investments.
</P>

<P>Capital investment analyses and capital source studies should be prepared
for planning up to five years ahead. The investment analyses should compare
rates of return for product, market, or process investment, while the source
studies should consist of a set of comparisons of cost and availability
of debt and equity and expected level of retained earnings. These analyses
and source studies should be prepared quarterly so that you may anticipate
the financial consequences of changes in your company's strategy. They
will allow you to plan long-term borrowing, equity placements, and major
investments. <A NAME="7.2"></A>

<H3>SBA Financial Assistance Programs </H3>

<P>The Federal government provides only limited direct financial assistance
for small companies. </P>

<P>The Small Business Administration (SBA) offers two forms of financial
assistance. The Guaranteed Lending Program provides financial assistance
to small businesses through local lending institutions. Under this program,
SBA will guarantee up to 90% or $500,000 of the loan, whichever is less.
Additional information on SBA programs can be obtained from SBA field offices
or by writing: Director, Office of Small Business Loans, U.S. SBA, 409
Third St., SW, Washington, DC 20416. </P>

<P>SBA also manages programs seeking to facilitate the provision of capital
to small companies by private sources through loan guarantees and through
provision of assistance to Small Business Investment Companies and Minority
Enterprise Small Business Investment Companies. </P>

<P><A NAME="7.3"></A>
<HR></P>

<H3>Individual Investors (Angels) </H3>

<P>Entrepreneurs seeking to raise from $100,00 to $1,000,000 for ventures
that are unlikely to be publicly held or acquired by a larger firm within
five to ten years will seldom attract the interest of professional venture
investors. These entrepreneurs should turn their attention to an invisible
segment of the risk capital market - individual investors, sometimes alluded
to as &quot;angels.&quot; Angels are a diverse and dispersed population
of individuals of means, many of whom have created their own successful
ventures. By providing seed capital for inventors and start-up firms, and
equity financing for established small firms, angels fill a void in the
institutional-risk capital market. It is estimated that angels finance
as many as 25,000 ventures per year, many of them high-tech start-ups.
</P>

<P>Angels require rewards commensurate with the risks they take. These
rewards can be monetary or &quot;psychic.&quot; As a result, an angel may
demand less equity than professional venture capitalists. But angels are
sophisticated investors. They look for competent management; they seldom
invest in the absence of a documented business plan; and they want to know
when and how they can cash in their chips. </P>

<P>Most angels make their own investment decisions. They usually invest
in technologies or markets with which they are familiar and in companies
which are close to home, typically within a day's drive. They like to stay
in touch with ventures they finance, often providing invaluable guidance.
They typically require a business plan prior to investing. </P>

<P>Finding the first angel is tough. The second and third come more easily.
Angels tend to be linked by an informal network of friends and business
associates, frequently sharing investment opportunities. </P>

<P><A NAME="7.4"></A>
<HR></P>

<H3>Research And Development Limited Partnerships </H3>

<P>Research and development limited partnerships (RDLPs) are attractive
for many companies because they offer a means for raising funds which do
not require diluting equity or increasing debt. What is sold through the
RDLP are rights in patents and technology resulting from a specific R&amp;D
project or set of projects. </P>

<P>Investors find RDLPs attractive as they use the tax advantages associated
with limited partnerships to reduce their risk and provide deductions that
can be used to offset other taxable income. The tax advantages stem from
the ability of limited partners to take the standard tax preferences for
R&amp;D to offset costs associated with R&amp;D. </P>

<P>Investors in an RDLP only reap substantial financial rewards if the
R&amp;D results in a successfully commercialized product. Accordingly,
RDLPs are commonly used only for applied research and development of products
with good market potential. </P>

<P>The RDLP consists of a General Partner, who typically sets up and manages
the partnership, and a set of limited partners who provide the funds utilized
by the partnership. RDLPs may be formed by companies, individuals, or government
or non-profit agencies. Many of the largest RDLPs have been formed by investment
bankers. Where syndication of the partnership by an investment banker has
taken place prior to the selection of projects for funding, the RDLP is
referred to as a blind pool. </P>

<P>As a legal entity, the RDLP has four major responsibilities: </P>

<OL>
<LI>Identify a potential product or process that can be commercially viable
if the R&amp;D succeeds. The General Partner must identify this need and
contract with users to sell or license the R&amp;D results. If the General
Partner can obtain contracts contingent only on meeting cost and performance
specifications, an assured market can be obtained prior to the initiation
of R&amp;D. </LI>

<LI>Obtain R&amp;D services. The General Partner seeks these services from
the most qualified, cost-efficient source in order to maximize the profitability
of the RDLP. The General Partner may seek to license existing technology
(for example federal agency technology) as part of the R&amp;D project.
</LI>

<LI>Raise funds through syndication. The two key components of this process
are preparation of the RDLP prospectus and marketing. The prospectus describes
the technical, financial, managerial, marketing, and tax aspects of the
project in sufficient detail to enable investors to make informed decisions
about the project's merit and risk. Depending on the size of the syndication
and the procedures utilized, the General Partner may have to file information
with state and federal securities agencies. </LI>

<LI>Ensure the successful commercialization of the R&amp;D results. Commercialization
may involve manufacturing and marketing a product, licensing technology,
or a total sale of the results. Where a company is establishing the RDLP,
it may serve as General Partner, provide partial funding as a limited partner,
and contract with itself for provision of R&amp;D. In such a situation,
the company acts in four legally distinct roles: independent business,
General Partner of the RDLP, investor, and contractor to the RDLP. Each
role has distinct legal responsibilities which must be met and the company
must treat all transactions associated with the RDLP as bona fide arms-length
transactions. Since the fiduciary relationship with the limited partners
involved in acting as a General Partner may conflict with the company's
desire to obtain R&amp;D funding, extreme caution and careful planning
are vital for use of this financial mechanism. For example, criteria for
the termination of a project should be well thought out in advance. Buyout
provisions, under which the company -- acting as General Partner -- can
buy out the limited partners and regain all rights in the R&amp;D results,
are another example of a critical area demanding careful consideration.

<H3>Venture Capital Companies </H3>

<P>Venture capital firms generally provide capital in exchange for equity
in a company. They generate their own profits by investing in firms they
believe can rapidly increase sales and generate substantial profits, thereby
creating long-term capital gains. </P>

<P>Most venture capital firms are interested in investment projects requiring
an investment of $250,000 to $1,500,000. Projects requiring under $250,000
are of limited interest because of the high cost of investigation and administration.
The typical venture capital firm receives over 1,000 proposals a year.
Probably 90% of these will be rejected quickly because they do not fit
the established geographic, technical, or market area policies of the firm
-- or because they have been poorly prepared. The remaining 10% are investigated
with care. A common rule-of- thumb is that a venture capitalist will look
for three to five times their investment in five or seven years. Another
common-rule-of thumb is that about one in ten investments will pay off
significantly. </P>

<P>The percentage of equity received by a venture capitalist depends on
the amount of money provided, the success and growth of the business, and
the anticipated investment return. It can range from perhaps 10% in the
case of an established, profitable company to as much as 80% or 90% for
startups or financially troubled firms. </P>

<P>Most venture firms, at least initially, do not want a position of more
than 30% to 40% because they want the owner to have an incentive to keep
building the business. If additional financing is required to support business
growth, the outsider's stake may exceed 50%; but investors realize that
small business owner-managers can lose their entrepreneurial zeal under
those circumstances. In the final analysis, however, the venture firm,
regardless of its percentage of ownership, wants to leave control in the
hands of the company's managers because it is really investing in that
management team in the first place. </P>

<P>Most venture capital firms determine the ratio of funds provided to
equity requested by comparing the present financial worth of the contributions
made by each of the parties to the agreement. The present value of the
contribution by the owner of a startup or financially troubled company
is obviously rated low. Often this ratio is estimated as just the existing
value of his or her idea and the competitive costs of the owner's time.
The contribution by the owners of a thriving business is valued much higher.
Generally, it is capitalized at a multiple of the current earnings and/or
net worth. </P>

<P>Note that venture capital firms generally provide capital in exchange
for stock. The term &quot;generally&quot; is used because venture leasing
is also an option. In venture leasing, the leasing company conducts a venture-type
analysis of a company's potential. Based on the results, the lessor takes
warrants or some other type of equity investment in exchange for equipment,
facilities, and other assets. The result is a mixed investment vehicle
similar to a debt-with-warrants investment. Deals range up to $2 to $3
million. </P>

<P>In the 1990s, the nature of venture capital investments has changed
from earlier years. As many observers have noted, the tendency towards
more freely-flowing money found in the early and mid-1980's is gone. Today,
tougher criteria are applied and a greater orientation towards investing
in the traditional bottom line and track record of key managers takes place.
</P>

<P>According to venture capitalists, several criteria are used in making
investment decisions. These are listed in their approximate order of importance.
</P>

<OL>
<LI>The track record of the company's key people. While a previously successful
CEO is a major plus for a company seeking venture capital, no individual
by him- or herself is enough. Venture capital firms usually require that
the company under consideration have a complete management team. Each of
the important functional areas (product design, marketing, production,
finance, and control) must be under the direction of a trained, experienced
member of the group. Responsibilities must be clearly assigned. </LI>

<LI>Commitment of key people to the selling product. Venture capitalists
know that without sales, companies die. Top management should be dedicated
to moving the company from research into product sales. </LI>

<LI>Distinctive strategic element that characterizes the firm. This distinctive
element may be a new product feature, manufacturing process, market niche,
or a particular management skill or technical competence. But it must exist
and it must provide a competitive advantage. </LI>

<LI>A core technology rather than a single product. A company built around
a technology rather than a product has flexibility. By spinning a series
of products out from the technology, it can have more than one shot at
successful market introduction, reducing the investors risk. Typically
the core technology depends on cutting-edge science and engineering. If
not, there is often a set of special insights into how to integrate off-the-shelf
and emerging technology. </LI>

<LI>Strong intellectual property protection. If the core technology cannot
be protected, the ability of a company to exploit its technology in the
market is reduced as imitators can rush in. </LI>

<LI>The type and size of targeted markets. Most venture capitalists are
interested in markets in the $50 to $100 million range -- large enough
to allow for substantial growth, yet small enough to not look too attractive
to Fortune 500 companies. Furthermore, these markets should not be crowded
or dominated by one or two companies with strong ties to customers, thereby
creating excessive barriers to entry. </LI>

<LI>The amount of money that will be needed to bring the company to break-even
(when revenues equal losses) and profitability. Most venture capitalists
will not be willing to bear alone all the costs of funding a company from
startup through to break-even. They will examine the company's strategy
for leveraging their investment with corporate partnering or other financial
support. </LI>
</OL>

<P>Many types of venture capital firms can be found, including: </P>

<UL>
<LI>Traditional partnerships -- which are often established by wealthy
families to aggressively manage a portion of their funds by investing in
small companies. </LI>

<LI>Professionally managed pools -- which are made up of institutional
money and which operate like the traditional partnerships. </LI>

<LI>Investment banking firms -- which usually trade in more established
securities, but occasionally form investor syndicates for venture proposals.
</LI>

<LI>Insurance companies -- which often have required a portion of equity
as a condition of their loans to smaller companies as protection against
inflation. </LI>

<LI>Manufacturing companies -- which occasionally look at investing in
smaller companies as a means of supplementing their R&amp;D programs. (Some
&quot;Fortune 500&quot; corporations have venture capital operations to
help keep them abreast of technological innovations). </LI>

<LI>Small Business Investment Corporations (SBIC's) -- which are licensed
by the Small Business Administration (SBA) and which may provide management
assistance as well as venture capital. (When dealing with SBIC's, the small
business owner-manager should initially determine if the SBIC is primarily
interested in an equity position, as venture capital, or merely in long-term
lending on a fully secured basis.) </LI>
</UL>

<P><A NAME="7.6"></A>
<HR></P>

<H3>Banks </H3>

<P>Debt is often the first thought of a company needing outside funding.
In general, bank loans are possible for companies with established records
of solid revenues and profits, and with sufficient assets to secure the
loan. However, companies seeking bank loans should be aware that banks,
like other businesses are influenced by a number of factors in making their
loans. Among these are state and federal regulations, accounting and marketing
considerations, and the general financial state of the institution's portfolio.
It may not be sufficient merely to deal with that bank where your company
keeps its deposits and to have a viable business plan. </P>

<P><A NAME="7.7"></A>
<HR></P>

<H3>Private Placements </H3>

<P>Private placements are sales of stock or bonds to a small group of highly
sophisticated investors. These placements are often handled by investment
bankers who must comply with various state and federal securities laws.
In general, the costs of a private placement mean that deals under $5 million
are not made. </P>

<P>Private placements are almost never used for start-ups. Investors tend
to prefer companies with a solid track record in revenues, cash flow, and
earnings and with a good likelihood that this track record can be maintained.
As a result, private placements work best for mature companies in relatively
stable industries with a low risk of rapid product obsolescence. Other
factors that come into consideration are proven management, high quality
management information and inventory control systems, strong marketing
and merchandising, and solid accounting and legal advisors. </P>

<P><A NAME="7.8"></A>
<HR></P>

<H3>Corporate Partnering </H3>

<P>Teaming with a mid- or large-size company is an increasingly common
source of outside investment for small high-technology companies. Typically,
the larger partner is seeking products or market share. Deals involving
process technology are less common, but can take place where the process
economics, in comparison with the existing means of production, are very
compelling. </P>

<P>Experience suggests partnering works best where the smaller firm is
seeking access to markets in addition to any financial or in-kind resources
required to complete product development. The best partners are companies
who can provide supplemental capabilities that the small company does not
have nor does it have the desire to develop. These may be in R&amp;D, manufacturing,
distribution, marketing and sales, or servicing the product. </P>

<P>A major advantage of partnering is the flexibility of these strategic
alliances. Partnerships can be structured as equity investments, subordinated
debt, equipment leases, advanced payments for licensing, and so forth.
Money only may be provided by the larger partner. Alternatively, space,
equipment, personnel or all of these in combination with money may be provided.
</P>

<P>In exploring corporate partnerships, it is vital that all participants
be clear about each others goals. In general, large companies are seeking
technology that can meet a present or near-term market need and the smaller
partner must be willing to focus on bringing its technology to fruition
on schedule. Often a major corporation will want to acquire the smaller
firm if the product is successful. </P>

<P>Information useful for evaluating potential partnerships includes: </P>

<UL>
<LI>Partner's relevant experience </LI>

<LI>Partner's R&amp;D programs and technology base </LI>

<LI>Partner's staff, equipment, and other research capability </LI>

<LI>Partner's staff, equipment and other manufacturing capability </LI>

<LI>Partner's knowledge of technology and the market in which the application
will occur </LI>

<LI>Partner's sales, distribution, and service capabilities </LI>

<LI>Priority your project will have for Partner </LI>

<LI>Resources to be devoted to your project by Partner </LI>

<LI>Structure of similar alliances formed by Partner </LI>

<LI>Revenues and profitability of similar alliances formed by Partner </LI>
</UL>

<P>Firms seeking corporate partnerships should be aware that such alliances
can take as much time and effort to conclude as any other means of outside
investment. In this context, before approaching larger corporations, it
often helps to conduct market research on potential partners to identify
those companies with appropriate needs and a willingness to enter into
strategic alliances. </P>

<HR></P>

<H3>Developing a Strategy for Negotiations </H3>

<P>The most important issue in negotiations is who will be in charge. This
decision should be made prior to development of a negotiating strategy
so that person can manage the process of developing and implementing the
strategy. </P>

<P>Typically, in smaller firms this individual is the President of the
company. But whoever it is, this person's career should rise or fall depending
on the results of his or her negotiations. This responsibility usually
hones their instincts. Allowing them to control development of the strategy
they must implement is the only fair approach. If the negotiations fail,
or if the follow-up commitment turns into a nightmare, employees will ask
whether the person held accountable was treated fairly. </P>

<P>The objectives of your negotiation must be translated into negotiating
positions. Classifying your objectives makes it possible to determine when
a negotiation should be terminated. It helps to think in terms of three
types of items: must items, give-away items, and non-negotiable items which
ideally will not even be raised during the negotiations. If must items
cannot be obtained or if non-negotiable items cannot be excluded, it is
time to terminate. </P>

<P>The negotiating team will rely heavily on information collected during
market research in developing a strategy. The market research should have
identified the likely objectives, decision-makers, and tactics of a potential
commercialization funding source. If you are seeking Phase III funding,
in addition to the information you might normally seek, market research
should have explored whether the funding source has had any prior experiences
with SBIR or STTR. Regardless, it also is useful to have researched the
experiences of companies or individuals similar to those you are approaching.
These experiences provide models and precedents which may make funding
your project appear less risky. </P>

<P>With this information and with the insights provided by personal contacts
between your company and the potential funding source, you can begin to
identify how the source is likely to act during negotiations. As this image
becomes clearer, you can begin to develop a formal negotiating strategy.
This strategy should be very flexible as the image may be wrong or change
over time. </P>

<P>One method for developing a strategy is to think of your positions in
terms of decision trees for each major issue. Each branch of a tree represents
options for resolving that issue which range from your most favored to
least favored, yet acceptable, alternative. </P>

<P>A major influence on the branches in your tree should be the likely
positions of your negotiating partner. For example, one company anticipated
needing around $300,000 for Phase III. They would have preferred around
$600,000. While preparing for negotiations with a venture capitalist, the
company discovered that the venture capitalist liked to invest in lots
between $200,000 and $300,000. The strategy therefore included an offer
to sell between one and three sets of five percent of the outstanding equity
at a fee of approximately $250,000 per set. </P>

<P>Another major influence on the tree should be who will represent the
other side during negotiations. If the ultimate decision maker will not
be in the room, you will have to plan for periods in which the negotiators
go off to seek approval -- often coming back with modifications. If several
people are likely to be on the negotiating team, you also may want to have
more than one person. That way you, as well as they, will be able to slow
the proceedings down, if need be, by caucusing. </P>

<P>A negotiating strategy is more than a decision tree. In addition to
exploring positions, you must think of how to best present your case and
when and where it is likely to be most persuasive. There is no hard and
fast rules for timing, location, and packaging. Our experience does suggest,
however, that if your company has its own labs or manufacturing facility
it is helpful to have representatives from the other side visit your location.
It builds your credibility for potential commercialization partners to
see you are not operating out of a post office box and a garage. </P>

<P>As your strategy evolves, it is imperative to constantly review your
Phase III objectives. Only in this manner can you ensure that the minutia
of preparation do not lead you to lose sight of your goals. During such
reviews you are likely to find that assumptions concerning how a business
should run are in conflict. For example, one company was founded by ex-university
professors. The company operated under a very non-hierarchical, open decision
making method. The company was approached by a major company interested
in acquiring specialized expertise found in the small company. The larger
company had concluded that it would be cheaper to buy a company to enter
a market niche than to develop the requisite expertise itself. Negotiations
were very positive until one day the discussion turned to calculated cash
flow losses as part of a low ball strategy for entering a new market niche.
Much to the chagrin of the smaller firm, a member of the Board of Directors
of the larger company was vehemently opposed to such losses, even where
a division was profitable. The inability to take calculated risks would
seriously restrict the growth potential of the smaller firm if acquired.
The merger failed. </P>

<P><A NAME="7.12"></A>
<HR></P>

<H3>Negotiation Teams </H3>

<P>Once the basic limits have been established, the negotiating team can
be readily established. For example, if issues related to R&amp;D protocols
or the performance of the technology are key for the negotiations, your
company will likely benefit from having a technical specialist on the team.
Since financial issues will be raised, your controller or accountant should
be included. </P>

<P>Negotiating teams often look similar to a marketing team. As with the
marketing activity, a mix of skills and knowledge is required. Also as
with a marketing team, each member of the team need not be actively involved
in the negotiations at any given point. Some members likely will only provide
background support and may never sit at the table. </P>

<P>Marketing and negotiating teams need not be identical. Negotiation is
its own skill and there is no need for an accomplished negotiator on the
marketing team. On the other hand, at least one member of the negotiating
team should be a member of the marketing team which first identified the
Phase III funding source. This overlap is important to ensure continuity
and institutional memory. </P>

<P><A NAME="7.13"></A>
<HR></P>

<H3>Problems and Pitfalls in Negotiations </H3>

<P>Five areas are likely to contain conflicts concerning how a business
or project should be run: </P>

<OL>
<LI>Objectives </LI>

<LI>Company Cultures </LI>

<LI>Operating and Decision-Making Procedures </LI>

<LI>Control over Personnel and Performance Standards </LI>

<LI>Budget Formulation and Discretionary Use of Funds </LI>
</OL>

<P>Especially where equity investments or cooperative projects are involved,
these areas need to be thoroughly discussed during negotiations. </P>

<P>Other problem areas also exist. Among these are: eliminating duplicative
efforts (whose work gets terminated), the Not Invented Here syndrome, tunnel
vision (where one partner fails to recognize the capabilities of the other),
change of staff (where a deal is dependent on the participation of one
or two key people), the &quot;Love at First Sight&quot; problem (where
the partners have too great expectations concerning each other), and the
profitability trap (where unrealistic market projections dig you into a
hole later). </P>

<P>Of all the problems which beset commercialization negotiations, perhaps
the worst is the Contingent Commitment Trap. This trap is an outgrowth
of the very structure of the SBIR program. At first, Phase III seems very
attractive to most follow-on funding sources. After all, they get to leverage
their investment in new products or production technology with several
hundreds of thousands of Federal dollars. But then they start to ask when
the product or technology can be used by them. Awardees typically reply
that Phase II lasts around two years. You just need your Phase III commitment
prior to submitting your Phase II proposal. </P>

<P>Unless your follow-on funding source is an investor, two to four years
prior to market entry often seems a long way away. The solution is to focus
on two benefits from participation. First, the follow-on funding source
can help define the technical objectives for Phase II. That way, they can
be released from a contingent commitment if you do not end up with results
which match their wish list. Second, you should structure some kind of
&quot;window on the technology&quot; into the Phase II work plan for your
negotiating partner. </P>

<P>Another aspect of the Contingent Commitment Trap is that you may finish
your work only to discover that you failed to hit one of your objectives.
After all, we call R&amp;D R&amp;D precisely because it is risky. Yet no
matter how close you have come, and no matter how significant your results,
your failure to hit an objective may release your follow-on funding source
from its commitment. To mitigate against this possibility, you must stay
close to your customer during Phase II. As you need to stay close anyway,
you might as well use the &quot;window&quot; as something you can either
offer, or give up, during negotiations. </P>

<P>A key part of avoiding problems and pitfalls is to develop an agenda
for the negotiations. Items to consider are: </P>

<OL>
<LI>How can a cooperative, positive tone be set? </LI>

<LI>What should be the order of discussion? </LI>

<LI>Who on the team will be in charge of driving the agenda? </LI>

<LI>Who will speak on which issues? </LI>

<LI>When, if ever, should the team seek guidance from higher level managers?
</LI>
</OL>

<P><A NAME="7.14"></A>
<HR></P>

<H3>Training for Negotiations </H3>

<P>Like any event, your negotiations will benefit if the team trains for
the event. Both physical stamina and mental alertness should be emphasized.
</P>

<P>Perhaps the best form of mental training are simulations and role playing.
Simulations allow you to explore alternative ways of handling the negotiations
before you are in the room. They force you to explore your assumptions
and positions. Further, a good simulation will teach you that the negotiation
is not likely to go as anticipated, no matter how well your team prepares.
</P>

<P><A NAME="7.15"></A>
<HR></P>

<H3>Negotiation Tactics </H3>

<P>When you walk into the room to begin negotiations, it is important to
remember that both parties consider a deal to be in their best interest
or they would not be taking the time to negotiate. Accordingly, a key task
is to set a positive tone and work to keep everyone feeling that they are
on the same side. </P>

<P>In order to successfully drive to a deal, at the beginning of the negotiations
be sure you are clear about the function of everyone in the room. Also
confirm who has final signing authority and what steps are required to
ratify the deal. </P>

<P>Once everyone has been introduced, it often helps to focus the discussion
on the procedures which will be used during the negotiations. Next, both
sides should present what they think are the issues which need to be negotiated.
After these parameters are made clear, the actual give and take can begin.
</P>

<P>There are several tactics for increasing the likelihood that you will
obtain a follow-on commitment closer to your most favored position. </P>

<P>The best approach is to use sound logic and good data to back up your
positions. Then present these positions in terms of how your preferred
terms can help your negotiating partner meet the needs which brought them
to the table in the first place. In this light, a key tactic when commercializing
an SBIR or STTR award is to highlight the leverage created by infusion
of Federal R&amp;D dollars. An award can bring hundreds of thousands of
dollars of research to bear on topics of interest to the funding source
if a follow-on commitment can be obtained. </P>

<P>In framing your positions in terms of the needs of the other side, it
may help to quote key members of their organization. Especially if you
are dealing with a major corporation, relevant quotes often can be found
in newspapers, trade publications, business magazines, and annual reports.
However, if this tactic is used, be careful to not come across as obnoxious.
Positions also can be bolstered by quotes from leading experts, business
leaders, or other individuals likely to be respected by the negotiating
team from the other side. </P>

<P>In addition to company or organizational needs, the people negotiating
on the other side will be influenced by their own opinions and perspectives.
As these biases become clear, another tactic is to frame your discussion
in their terms. In effect, you are playing to their own opinions. </P>

<P>Numerous other tactics exist. These include appealing to precedent,
using statistics to support a point, arguing that a position is mandated
by law or regulation (only do so if you are positive it is), and the like.
Because negotiations imply a give and take process, your team should be
prepared to compromise. As the term compromise implies, when negotiating
be sure that you receive concessions for anything you give up. Otherwise
you weaken your ability to hold firm on points far more vital to you later
in the negotiations. Of course, even if you feel that the emerging compromise
is a fair one, remember to check that it is one you can live with. Sometimes
in the middle of a negotiation the parties get swept along by the momentum
only to discover later that they failed to consider the impact of a compromise
on their objectives. </P>

<P>Some negotiators argue that you should press key points only after backing
off on give away items. Others prefer to use give-aways after getting a
key item so they do not look greedy. Whatever seems appropriate during
the negotiations, remember that the worst thing you can do is to back the
other side into a corner or devastate them. In either case, their willingness
to compromise will likely be destroyed. </P>

<P>Before making a compromise, be sure to clarify whether or not the people
on the other side have the authority to do so. If they must go back to
a higher authority for approval, any compromise reached is only temporary.
In that case, you should not commit yourself to a compromise until it is
clear that they will. You never know, what looks good today may look bad
tomorrow in light of subsequent developments. </P>

<P>During discussions, the dynamic of the discussion can have a major impact
on the outcome. You should be aware of this effect and use it to your advantage.
Changing the pace of discussions is one way to influence the dynamic. For
example, if you feel you are unable to gain consensus on a must item for
you, you might suggest a break. During the break you and your team can
analyze how better to present your arguments. Alternatively, you might
try bundling a set of items to see if you can get a compromise on a package.
</P>

<P>In general, we recommend against using more heavy handed tactics. They
tend to polarize the parties or back people into corners. You should, however,
be aware that they exist and watch for them. Some of these tactics include
good cop/bad cop routines, (controlled) emotional outbreaks, use of threats
and bluffs, and walk outs. </P>

<P>Despite everyone's best efforts, there may be times when it appears
impossible to reach a compromise. Tactics for dealing with this situation
include redoing the agenda, taking a break, and using brainstorming and
other tools for developing alternatives. </P>

<P>If the impasse still cannot be resolved yet both parties feel an agreement
is in their best interests, use of an outside mediator should be considered.
</P>

<P>The success or failure of the negotiations hinges on whether you can
reach an agreement. One tactic for ensuring both parties remain focused
on their collective best interest is to end each session with the preparation
of a written summary. This summary should emphasis the points on which
agreement has been reached and indicate what items are next on the agenda.
As the negotiations draw to a close, the summary will increasingly take
the shape of a non-binding memorandum of agreement. Once all the parties
feel they have reached a satisfactory agreement, it can be turned over
to the lawyers as the basis for your commercialization contract. </P>

<P>Proposals typically have two major parts: the technical proposal and

<P>The Technical Proposal describes what it is you will be doing and why
the funding source should care. The Business Proposal tells the funding

and the budget justifications. It typically also includes various certifications

<H2>Technical Proposal</H2>

<P><A NAME="7.20"></A></P>

<H3>The Four Questions </H3>

<P>To write a good proposal, you have to be clear about what you want to
do, why, and how. At Foresight we have found the best proposals begin with
a simple, short set of one paragraph statements responding to the following
four questions: </P>

<OL>
<LI>What is the significance of the problem? What problem are you going
to solve (or what are you going to produce) and what difference will your
efforts make? </LI>

<LI>How are you going to go about resolving the problem identified above?
What are your specific technical objectives and how do you intend to demonstrate
their feasibility? What are the details of the work plan for accomplishing
the objectives? </LI>

<LI>Why are you the right firm to perform the work? What evidence can you
provide to establish your firm's credibility, including your awareness
of state-of-art, your firm's previous experience in the conduct of related
R&amp;D, the qualifications of key personnel and of consultants, and your
facilities. </LI>

<LI>What is the scientific/technical quality, innovativeness, and originality
of the proposed project? This issue is seldom addressed in a distinct part
of the proposal. Rather you must keep your attention on this issue throughout
the proposal. </LI>
</OL>

<P><A NAME="7.21"></A>
<HR></P>

<H3>Significance of the Project </H3>

<P>Problems or opportunities always exist in a context that enables us
to identify them as problems or opportunities. Content sections should
focus on demonstrating how your project addresses a vital problem or opportunity
in light of two key contexts: scientific/technical and socio-economic.
The introduction to the technical proposal should clarify why your project
is significant in each of these contexts. </P>

<P>Be aware of the distinction between the application of R&amp;D results
and the scientific/technical barriers to developing the application. While
both questions should be addressed, it is quite appropriate to emphasize
one over the other. The particular emphasis you should give depends on
the nature of the agency and the project or solicitation topic. Mission
agencies tend to place greater emphasis on the first question than non-mission
agencies. Basic research agencies place particularly strong emphasis on
the second question. </P>

<P><A NAME="7.22"></A>
<HR></P>

<H3>Technical Objectives and the Work Plan </H3>

<P>The heart of any R&amp;D proposal is a description of the technical
objectives of the project and the work plan for attaining those objectives.
The presentation of these two elements must be internally consistent and
mutually supportive. In addition, you must present your argument in such
a manner that the program manager and reviewers will conclude your approach
is unique, innovative, and of exceptional scientific/technical merit. <A NAME="7.23"></A>
<HR></P>

<H3>Technical Objectives </H3>

<P>In the technical objectives section of your proposal you should specify
what it is you intend to accomplish. They should be regarded as a link
between what you are ultimately trying to achieve (discussed in the significance
part of the proposal) and the detailed technical work (work plan). It is
preferable to state an objective as a result, not as a question that you
intend to study. It is vital that your objectives be realistic. If your
objectives are not plausible your proposal will be rightfully rejected
on its merits. </P>

<P>Four considerations should be kept in mind when developing your objectives:
</P>

<OL>
<LI>Your objectives should flow logically from the discussion of the significance
of the problem or opportunity. Reaching your objectives should mean you
have proven the feasibility of solving the problem or realizing the opportunity.
</LI>

<LI>Your objectives should be plausible, both in terms of your available
resources and your budget. </LI>

<LI>Your objectives should be bound by the resources your company can bring
to bear on the problem -- both staff and facilities. </LI>

<LI>In presenting your objectives, begin by specifying those objectives
that are most clearly related to the solicitation topic and/or agency concerns.
Next proceed to objectives relating to &quot;spin-off&quot; benefits. Make
sure that &quot;spin-off&quot; related objectives are clearly secondary
to topic related objectives. </LI>
</OL>

<P>
<HR></P>

<A NAME="7.25"> </a><H3>Work Plan </H3>

<P>The work plan describes what the Federal agency is buying. For your
own protection, as well as for increasing the attractiveness of the proposal,
work plans must describe exactly what work you will conduct in order to
accomplish your objectives. If you win an R&amp;D award, you will have
to deliver what you state in your work plan. </P>

<P>The work plan must demonstrate that you know what you are doing. You
should elaborate on the techniques you will use to accomplish the objectives.
Indicate why these techniques are appropriate. Demonstrate your expertise
by highlighting any techniques that are state-of-the-art or that you will
develop yourself. Indicate any past experience that you have in using these
techniques. Refer to other studies that support the appropriateness of
your methodology to accomplish the objectives. </P>

<P>The work plan should include a discussion of possible problems that
may emerge or extraneous factors that may affect the outcome of your effort
and how you intend to overcome those problems. People active in R&amp;D
know that it is risky; that the unexpected is often encountered. Clear
attention to contingency planning is a sign of your professionalism and
ability to deliver what you promise. </P>

<P>The Work Plan should be highly detailed without becoming bogged down
in minutiae. Striking this delicate balance is not always easy -- but it
is essential. </P>

<P>Scheduling and project staff activities charts are useful in striking
the appropriate balance. These charts depict who will do what work, and
when. The charts should guide the development of the supporting text. If
you use consultants or subcontractors, your Work Plan must contain a discussion
of how you will manage them in order to ensure a timely, high quality product.
</P>

<P><A NAME="7.26"></A>
<HR></P>

<H3>Project Staff, Facilities, and Equipment </H3>

<P>The most important member of your project team is the Principal Investigator
(PI). The PI should have good work experience and technical expertise in
the area of your project. Work experience and technical expertise are more
important than an extensive publication record but, especially in non-mission
agencies, publications and advanced degrees count. If possible, related
work experience should indicate that the PI has successfully managed projects
similar to the one you are proposing. </P>

<P>Few projects can be conducted by a single individual. Accordingly, your
discussion should emphasize the existence of a complete R&amp;D project
team. A good team includes adequate support staff to carry the project
through to completion on time and within budget. </P>

<P>Present specific bibliographic information only for key R&amp;D personnel.
In presenting information about key personnel, be brief. Extensive resumes
will rapidly push your proposal over page limitations, if they exist, and
discourage the reviewer due to the amount of material to wade through.
Remember that what you are demonstrating is the ability of your key personnel
to perform the work proposed. Therefore, summarize relevant related work,
education, and publications. </P>

<P>Present the uniqueness of your expertise and experience so the program
manager and the reviewer will conclude that it is unlikely that anyone
else is more qualified to conduct your project. If you feel that your firm
cannot establish its unique capabilities, consultants and subcontractors
can help you enhance your firm's expertise and experience. But remember,
the primary competence must be in-house. Consultants and subcontractors
should be used for clearly defined support functions, such as project review,
product testing, and specific experimental operations or data collection.
</P>

<P>Your ability to complete the project on time and within budget also
depends on access to appropriate facilities and equipment. Briefly describe
the facilities and equipment you will utilize. Include specifics on all
laboratory or clinical, computing, and office facilities and equipment
crucial for the project. If these facilities and equipment are not in-house,
provide information that will satisfy any concerns the project manager
or reviewers might have with respect to access. </P>

<P><A NAME="7.27"></A>
<HR></P>

<H3>Relationship with Future R&amp;D or Potential Applications </H3>

<P>Agencies like to fund work with a future. The proposal should include
a brief discussion on how attaining your project's anticipated results
will advance scientific/technical progress; that is, substantive knowledge,
methodology and technique, and/or technological innovation. You may also
want to indicate the commercial applications your project may have. You
should consider both direct and indirect applications. For example, a project
on oil seeds may have direct applications in the commercial petroleum market
and indirect applications in agricultural technology markets. The length
of this discussion should reflect the importance placed on future work
or applications by the solicitation or by the program manager. </P>

<P><A NAME="7.28"></A>
<HR></P>

<H2>The Business Proposal </H2>

<P>The business proposal contains the budget and the justification for
the sums contained in the budget. As with the technical proposal, agencies
will commonly provide detailed instructions for the preparation of budgets.
For example, you usually will be asked to use a specific worksheet in presenting
summary budget information. </P>

<P>Remember that accuracy is essential in preparing the budget. The sums
utilized and the justifications for those sums may be questioned during
an audit by the agency. Careful attention to detail while preparing the
business proposal can ensure no surprises will occur later. </P>

<P>A crucial item is to develop defensible overhead and general and administrative
rates. A good publication to help you with this task is <I>Guidance for
New Contractors</I> (DCAA Publication 7641.90, November, 1994) from the
Department of Defense's Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA). To obtain
a copy, write Defense Contract Audit Agency, Cameron Station, Alexandria,
VA 22304-6178. For additional help, contact your local DCAA office. To
locate this office, call DCAA Headquarters, Special Audits Division at
(703) 274-7344. If you are unfamiliar with terms related to government
contracting, an on-line resource is <A HREF="http://www.kcilink.com/govcon/contractor/gcterms.html">The
Government Contractor's Glossary</A>, provided by Donald Keninitz, CPA,
Partner in charge of Government Contracting Services, Inc. Friedman &amp;
Fuller, P.C.</P>

<P>One way to prepare a realistic budget is to have your R&amp;D team assist
in preparing a draft budget at the time you prepare the outline for your
proposal. You should show this draft budget to your accountant to ensure
it is appropriate for your business. For example, you will want to have
back-up for your material and labor overhead rates should the agency demand
these. By the time you prepare your first proposal draft, your budget should
be fixed. </P>

<P>Unless expressly excluded by statute, agencies can provide for a reasonable
fee or profit on contracts. Our experience is that 5% to 10% is a reasonable
range for profit rates. How receptive many agencies are to fees or profit
is an open question in practice. As we have seen, some programs may require
cost-sharing as a condition of an award. </P>

<H2>Writing Your Proposal</H2>

<H3>Five Major Steps in Writing Your Proposal </H3>

<P>The precise number of steps in proposal preparation is determined both
by preference and the significance of the award being sought. In this section
we present what we feel is the bare minimum for a successful SBIR proposal.
</P>

<OL>
<LI>The first step in writing is <I>Outline</I>. The outline should be
extensive. A good outline contains the first sentence of each paragraph
in the proposal. The primary considerations in evaluating your outline
are the completeness of the information you will be presenting (Have you
addressed all format items in the solicitation?), and the organization
of your arguments (Is the argument logical and persuasive?). After you
have reviewed and approved your outline, it should be considered &quot;fixed&quot;
and unchangeable. There must be exceptionally good reasons for subsequent
major modifications to the outline or you will not be able to stay on schedule.
</LI>

<LI>The second step, <I>Review</I>, examines the outline against the solicitation
document or program announcement. At this time you must ensure that you
are on target in terms of objectives of your potential customer, in compliance
with any requirements which may exist, and likely to be favorably evaluated
given any evaluation criteria provided. </LI>

<LI><I>Preliminary Draft</I>, the third step, fleshes out the outline.
At this time you prepare all appropriate graphics (see discussion below).
You should treat this draft as if it were a final draft -- good spelling
and good grammar are a must. </LI>

<LI>The preliminary draft should be presented to a <I>Review Team</I> in
the fourth step. If you have competent and qualified people in-house, use
them. If not, seek help from outside. In doing so, however, realize that
highly-qualified reviewers often expect, and deserve, remuneration. </LI>

<LI>The last step is to prepare your <I>Final Draft</I>. You should consider
all possibilities for improving it and integrate those points that seem
to have merit. It is at this time that you seek to catch any mistakes,
errors, faulty arguments or logic that may have been missed at earlier
stages -- including mistakes your review team may have missed. </LI>
</OL>

<P>It is vital that the final draft look professional. The type should
be clear and readable. The graphics should be clean and professional looking.
Check to make sure that all the pages are included in the proposal and
that they are correctly numbered. Make sure all instructions have been
complied with. For example, an NIH SBIR proposal will be rejected if the
wrong spacing between characters is used when typing the proposal abstract.
Other agencies have similar rules. </P>

<P>Finally, re-read the proposal one more time with the agency requirements
in front of you. Make sure that you have a section addressing each type
of information requested. Make sure that procedural and substantive directions
found in the solicitation or unsolicited proposal submission instructions
have been adhered to. </P>

<P>Your proposal should be either hand delivered and a receipt obtained,
mailed, or sent via an overnight delivery service. In the future, E-mail
will be an increasingly common delivery mechanism. For example, the <A HREF="http://www.nsf.gov">National
Science Foundation</A>, the sponsor of this publication, has the a program
called FastLane for submission of electronic proposals. Be sure to have
proof of delivery in case questions arise later. Proposals submitted in
response to solicitations must be submitted on time or they will not be
considered. </P>

<P>If you do not win an award, write or visit the program manager for a
debriefing. In requesting a debriefing make it clear that you are interested
in learning how you might better compete in the future. Among the information
you might seek is how to improve your technical approach, the names of
individuals or firms you might work with on subsequent proposals, guidance
on appropriate budget levels for the kind of work proposed, and the types
of proposal foci that would be particularly appealing to the program. You
also should request a copy of the evaluations on your proposal, if these
are not provided at the debriefing. Agencies will almost always provide
you with these comments, but at times you must be persistent. </P>

<P>Federal marketing is an iterative business and it takes time to get
established. Even when you are established in the market, there is no guarantee
of success. No one wins all the time. Each proposal preparation process
is a learning experience. It is a wasted effort unless you draw as many
lessons from it as possible. </P>

<P>Successful Federal R&amp;D funding recipients repeatedly go through
the &quot;learning curve&quot; of proposal submission, debriefing, and
submission of a new proposal. </P>

<P><A NAME="7.30"></A>
<HR></P>

<H3>Writing Tips for Proposals and Other Documents </H3>

<P>A proposal, development plan, business plan, and other marketing information
is a written document. Accordingly, all the considerations that go into
writing any persuasive piece apply to writing these documents. You must
consider what your audience wants to hear, how they like to hear it, and
what criteria they use in evaluating what they hear. </P>

<P>It is vital to remember that it is exceptionally difficult to produce
a good document under time pressure. Leave yourself plenty of lead time.
</P>

<P>Like any written piece, these documents should have a beginning, middle,
and end. The beginning and end are where you highlight the most persuasive
reasons for funding your proposal. The middle contains the back-up for
those arguments, plus an analysis of why any weakness your firm has will
not adversely affect performance. </P>

<P>At the beginning of your document you should place a brief abstract
or summary highlighting what you propose to do and how you will do it.
At the end you should state these same points in a very brief conclusion.
The conclusion should also state why your firm is uniquely qualified for
this project. </P>

<P>For proposals, the order of presentation in the middle of your document
should carefully adhere to the order of items to be included in proposals
(the format) presented in the solicitation. Reviewers expect it this way.
Even if you have covered the substance of an item earlier, you should devote
a section to that item. The section can be brief; stating, for example
that &quot;This item has been discussed under Subsection X.&quot; </P>

<P>For other documents, request examples of exemplary submissions from
the organization to which you are submitting the document. Use the document
they provide as your model. If they do not have, or will not provide exemplary
examples, use their annual reports, program announcements, and other equivalent
material as your model. </P>

<P>Guide your reader by starting each major section or subsection with
a heading. The heading should clearly identify the topic of the discussion
to follow. Your headings should be distinguished from the text through
type style or font. </P>

<P>Within each section, choose the placement of your arguments carefully
in order to maximize persuasive presentation. In general, it is a good
idea to present your strongest argument first, your next strongest argument
immediately before your conclusion, and your weakest arguments in the middle.
This structure enables you to create a good impression on the reader up
front, while saving a good point for the end to overcome any concerns which
might be raised by the weaker arguments. </P>

<P>It is also important to be honest with your reader. If your company
is weak in one area, present the reader with your solution to that weakness.
For example, if you lack in-house expertise for a specific part of your
project, state the names of the consultants that you will hire to assist
you with that part. In this manner, your weaknesses are presented as strengths.
</P>

<P><A NAME="7.31"></A>
<HR></P>

<H3>Presentation Tips for Proposals and Other Documents </H3>

<P>Imagine you are a program manager, reviewer, buyer, or venture capitalist.
On your desk are maybe 10, maybe 50 documents. You have to plow through
them. This little mental exercise highlights the importance of making your
documents readable. </P>

<P>Careful formatting of the page assists the reader. Page after page of
solid text with margins at the edge of the paper are difficult to read.
Long paragraphs are difficult to read. White space on the page makes the
proposal look less formidable. </P>

<P><B>Note: It is imperative that you clearly identify proprietary information.
Carefully follow any instructions provided by the organization to which
the document is being submitted. </B></P>

<P>Think about alternative ways of presenting information. If you are presenting
a list of items, perhaps you should indent and number them. If you are
making a minor point that is not central to the argument, but nonetheless
important for demonstrating your familiarity with the scientific or technical
area, perhaps you should put the point in a footnote. </P>

<P>Above all, be consistent. A consistent format enables your reader to
easily grasp the significance you place on information. </P>

<P><A NAME="7.32"></A>
<HR></P>

<H3>Graphics in Proposals and Marketing Documents </H3>

<P>Graphics and other artwork can provide highly effective means for communicating
complicated information in a minimal amount of space. Properly and sparingly
used, they can give your proposal a polished, professional look. </P>

<P>Some common types of graphics helpful in proposals and marketing documents
are: </P>

<UL>
<LI>Project Scheduling Charts (what tasks will be conducted when) </LI>

<LI>Organizational Charts (who is responsible for what and who reports
to whom) </LI>

<LI>Project Staff Activities Charts (who will spend what time on what tasks)
</LI>

<LI>Diagrams and Flow Charts </LI>

<LI>Data Tables and Graphs </LI>

<LI>Photographs </LI>
</UL>

<P>To determine where to use graphics, ask yourself: </P>

<P>&quot;Could I grasp this information if all I provide is presented as
a graphic? By using that graphic will it cut down the length of my document?&quot;
</P>

<P>In order to ensure that your graphics strengthen your document, make
sure that they are tightly integrated with the text. After you prepare
your outline, examine it to decide what information can most efficaciously
be presented through graphics. Then determine precisely what type of graphic
should be used. </P>

<P>Graphics must appeal to the eye. If you attempt to present too much
information in a chart, table, or graph, you are likely to find that your
reader's eyes will glaze over and your effort is wasted. If the artwork
is not effectively placed on the page, and clearly labeled, glazed eyes
again are likely. Above all, keep it simple. </P>

<P><A NAME="7.33"></A>
<HR></P>

<H3>Proposal Review Checklists </H3>

<P>Most proposal submission books contain a check list. This list addresses
housekeeping issues such as: </P>

<UL>
<LI>are all relevant sections included in the proposal</LI>

<LI>is the page properly formatted and the text of the correct font and
size</LI>

<LI>is the proposal packaged properly</LI>
</UL>

<P>Even if such a list is provided, be sure to re-read the solicitation
document and draw out all the relevant requirements. Use this information
to enhance the list provided by the agency.&nbsp;Remember, it is a disaster
to get a proposal tossed simply because you failed to follow the rules.
</P>

<P>We recommend making a second check list. &nbsp;This list addresses substantive
issues is based on the evaluation criteria for proposals and common mistakes
identified by program managers. The following common reasons why proposals
are poorly evaluated should be included. &nbsp;Check your work to see if
any of these apply. </P>

<UL>
<LI>Research Goals Inappropriate or Unclear </LI>

<LI>Topic not responsive to solicitation </LI>

<LI>Topic formulation not consistent with agency priorities </LI>

<LI>Purpose of R&amp;D not clear </LI>

<LI>R&amp;D Goals not worthy of support </LI>

<LI>No clear product or end-point to R&amp;D </LI>

<LI>Study Design Deficient </LI>

<LI>Insufficient attention to related R&amp;D by others </LI>

<LI>Work plan not related to goals of project </LI>

<LI>Lack of clear and logical structure in proposal </LI>

<LI>Methodologies not appropriate </LI>

<LI>Methodologies not sufficiently detailed </LI>

<LI>Methodologies not justified </LI>

<LI>Data biased (or cannot tell) and no plan to correct this bias </LI>

<LI>Staff, Time, or Budget Inappropriate </LI>

<LI>Specific tasks not related to personnel, time, and budget </LI>

<LI>Insufficient time commitment by Principal Investigator </LI>

<LI>Too small allocations of time among too many team members </LI>

<LI>Inappropriate mix of scientific and technical expertise and skills
</LI>

<LI>Too heavy reliance on consultants and subcontractors </LI>

<LI>Problems in Overall Presentation </LI>

<LI>Over reliance on past performance or reputation in place of solid work

<LI>Assume reviewers familiar with proposers' past work </LI>

<LI>Lack of focus </LI>

<LI>Administrative Detail </LI>

<LI>Budget unrealistically high or low </LI>

<LI>Lack of adequate budget justification </LI>

<LI>Budget calculations difficult to understand </LI>

<LI>No commitment letters from consultants and/or subcontractors </LI>

and ways of combining ideas and technology. Under U.S. law, intellectual
property can be protected by three tools: <A HREF="glossary.htm#pat">patent</A>,
<A HREF="glossary.htm#copy">copyright</A> and<A HREF="glossary.htm#TS">
trade secret</A>. </P>

<P>In all Federally funded phases, small businesses have the right by law
to retain patents resulting from the R&amp;D. Yet this is not an automatic
process. If the company elects to retain the rights to an invention that
occurs during a period of federally-funded R&amp;D, it must declare a discovery
and make a formal act of election. </P>

<P>Be aware that special rules apply to the STTR program. Before receiving
an STTR award, a small business must negotiate a written agreement between
the small business concern and the research institution, allocating intellectual
property rights and rights, if any, to carry out follow-on research, development,
or commercialization. The small business concern must submit this agreement
to the awarding Federal agency on request; either with the proposal or
at any time thereafter. </P>

<H3>Intellectual Property Considerations in SBIR/STTR </H3>

<P>A variety of intellectual property is created in SBIR or STTR projects.
These include inventions and designs, technical data, computer software,
and written documents. </P>

<P>Title to patent rights may be retained for inventions made during an
SBIR or STTR award. However, the awardee must elect to retain title and
pursue the patent. The Government can obtain title if the awardee fails
to file on time, ceases to pursue an application in any country after filing,
fails to maintain or defend the patent once issued, or fails to disclose
the invention or elect to retain title. The Government retains march-in
rights and can force a patentee to grant a license where needed to meet
a Federal mission, to satisfy public health and safety needs, where required
by Federal regulated requirements for public use, or to secure domestic
manufacture. </P>

<P>Awardees need to be aware that if a subcontractor is involved, the subcontractor
must retain all rights to inventions made at the subcontractor level. </P>

<P>The general rule in SBIR and STTR is that you retain significant rights
in technical data developed under an award for four years after the last
contract delivery. SBIR technical data may not release and disclose outside
the Government without permission in this four year period. After four
years, the Government's license to the data enables others to use the Government
funded data for Government purposes. </P>

<P>The Government's rights to pre-existing data and intellectual property
or to data and intellectual property to be developed under internal company
funding is defined in the contract or grant. Accordingly, work statements
must be carefully written to limit the scope of the intellectual property
to which the Government will have rights. Both proposals and contract or
grant documents must specify what intellectual property the potential (or
actual) awardee is providing and what is being developed under the contract
and delivered to the Government. </P>

<P>Copyright protection can be obtained for work produced in performance
of an SBIR or STTR contract. Copyrighted work should be marked with a &quot;c&quot;
in a circle, the year of creation, and the name of the owner. Also noted
must be the Government's license rights to the document or code because
of its sponsorship of its development. Copyright does not affect the Government's
right to use the material as the Government is granted a license to any
intellectual property funded under SBIR. </P>

<P>Be aware that rules governing intellectual property, particularly to
software, vary between civilian agencies and the Department of Defense.
</P>

<HR></P>

<H3>Comparison of Intellectual Property Protection Options </H3>

<P>For most small high-technology companies, it is the results of R&amp;D
on which the company's future will rest. Accordingly, any investor will
want to know that these key assets actually belong to the company. Under
U.S.law, intellectual property can be protected by three tools: patents,
trademarks, and copyrights. </P>

<P>A patent is a right to an invention that is granted by the Government
and that gives the holder an exclusive right to use an invention during
a period of time. In the United States, before a patent can be issued,
the inventor must demonstrate his or her invention is new and non-obvious.
To be new, an invention must not have been known nor made by others in
the U.S. The invention can also not have been previously patented or presented
in a publication prior to the claimed date on which the invention was made.
Patents are handled by the <A HREF="http://www.uspto.gov/">U.S. Patent
Office</A>, part of the Department of Commerce.</P>

<P>Non-obvious is established with reference to what would be obvious to
a person of ordinary skill in the relevant technology (or technologies)
at the time of the invention. A general rule is that the more complicated
the technology and the greater the rate at which it is developing, the
higher the skill-level of that hypothetical ordinary person. Non-obvious
is determined by examining prior patents, technical publications, and non-secret
work being conducted. Usually some aspect of an invention will be non-obvious
and thus capable of being patented.</P>

<P>It is important to recognize that different rules apply in different
countries. In the U.S., you have one year from the time of first disclosure,
use, publication, or sale of an invention to patent the invention. Where
more than one person or group makes a claim to be the inventor, the patent
goes to the person or group which can demonstrate priority in time. Overseas,
the rules are different. Usually the invention must be patented before
any public disclosure, use, publication, or sale. In case of a dispute,
priority goes to the first person or group to apply for a patent, regardless
of who may actually be the inventor. You can, however, get the same overseas
priority rights you would get from simultaneously filing overseas and in
the U.S. if you file in each relevant country within 12 months of a U.S.
patent application. </P>

<P>Copyright is a right to a literary production (which can include a software
code as well as books) and which gives the holder an exclusive right to
make copies of the literary item, publish them, and sell them for a period
of time. What is protected is the form of the expression of the idea, not
the underlying idea. In the U.S., a copyright is automatically granted
when an embodiment of an idea is made if an encircled C, the name of the
owner, and the year of first publication are added to the expression. Enforcing
the right in court against infringers requires registration with the <A HREF="http://lcweb.loc.gov/copyright/">U.S.
Copyright Office</A>, part of the Library of Congress. If the registration
is made within three months of the first publication date, rights to statutory
damages and attorney's fees in suits against infringers can be obtained.
</P>

<P>A trade secret is a plan, process, tool, mechanism, or compound that
is known only to its owner and those of his employees in whom it is necessary
to confide. So long as it is kept secret, it is a form of protected property
and the owner may sue those who steal it for damages. Unlike patents, a
trade secret will not protect an invention against an independent discovery
by someone else. The most famous trade secret is probably the formula for
Coca Cola. <A NAME="7.37"></A>
<HR></P>

<H3>Intellectual Property Audit </H3>

<P>An intellectual property audit involves examining the systems by which
your company tracks ideas generated by its employees, determines which
ones to protect, selects appropriate legal protection, and implements that
protection. It also examines the company's portfolio of intellectual property
to make sure all important ideas are adequately protected and that resources
are not wasted protecting unimportant ideas. These audits are almost always
conducted with the aid of a qualified lawyer. </P>

<P>Three rules-of-thumb are: </P>

<OL>
<LI>Examine all files, applications, and registrations associated with
existing intellectual property. This examination should assess the adequacy
of documentation including the story of the ideas creation and testing,
accuracy of all formal filings, records of maintenance payments, records
actual and attempted licenses, and any litigation. </LI>

<LI>Assess the operation of systems throughout the entire company. Inadequate
or nonexistent protection can exist in accounting or marketing as well
as in the R&amp;D lab. Thus, a complete audit will examine company operations
such as handling of employee hiring and firing or exiting, publication,
incentive procedures, and vendor agreements as well as procedures for keeping
lab notebooks, establishing confidentiality agreements and covenants not
to compete, and the process for designing new products. </LI>

<LI>Examine the company's relationship with its environment, particularly
with suppliers, customers, consultants, outside research sponsors, universities,
investors, and competitors. By including these groups in addition to licensees
or licensors and research partners, areas of potentially damaging leaks
or failures to establish company claims to property can be identified.
</LI>
</OL>

<P>The result of this step is a formal document. One format is for each
technology of interest to describe: </P>

<OL>
<LI>the technology and the underlying science and engineering knowledge
and the know-how on which it is based; </LI>

<LI>current owner(s), their shares in the property, and the basis of their
claims; </LI>

<LI>a brief history of the technology establishing relevant dates in its
creation and development; </LI>

<LI>current and desired intellectual property protection; and, </LI>

<LI>steps required to move from current to desired protection, including
tasks, timing, resources, and costs. </LI>
</OL>

<P>This document should be prepared or reviewed by an intellectual property
lawyer with experience in the relevant technical area(s). </P>

<H3>Confidentiality Agreements </H3>

<H4>This topic was written by James C. Wray, an attorney in McLean, VA</H4>

<P><B>Introduction </B></P>

<P>Confidentiality agreements are the first step in technology transfer.
Without this step, technology transfer can not be established and the commercialized
process never has a chance of getting started. </P>

<P>The purpose of confidentiality agreements is to maintain the control
and the confidentiality of inventions and information while permitting
limited access to determine whether a prospective licensee or purchaser
is interested. Confidentiality agreements are used to protect national
and international rights while permitting evaluation or limited use of
technology by others. </P>

<P>Confidentiality provisions may be used in other agreements, such as
licenses, sales, employment or consulting agreements and options. A confidentiality
agreement by itself is usually limited to the evaluation of the technology.
</P>

<P>Confidentiality agreements are powerful forms of protection of trade
secrets, which include new technology, technical information, new or modified
features, old processes not yet publicly described, business plans and
substantially anything which is not generally known. The agreements protect
the technology against use by the recipient, but they do not protect against
their use or discovery by others. </P>

<P><B>Subject matter </B></P>

<P>Inventions that have not yet been patented are a primary subject of
confidentiality agreements. Such agreements may be used with any information
or technology, whether or not they are patentable or the subject of patent
applications. Confidentiality agreements are used with patentable technology
such as machines, processes, products and compounds and software. Confidentiality
agreements may be used with other information and technology, such as trade
secrets, know-how, business methods, unpatentable data, codes and software,
and general ideas for businesses, whether or not the subject matter may
be protectable under patent, copyright or trademark laws of the United
States or trade secret laws of individual states. </P>

<P><B>Unacceptable agreements </B></P>

<P>After offering to submit technology to a company for consideration,
an owner often receives a form, sometimes in duplicate, stating simply
that the discloser will rely only on patent rights or copyrights. Often
prospective receivers refuse to receive or consider information until such
a form is signed. A form that restricts rights or copyrights to patent
rights is not a confidentiality agreement and should not be signed by a
discloser. </P>

<P>If a company refuses to accept information under an agreement of confidentiality
and requires a signature on a form that restricts rights solely to patent
rights, an owner may wish to work with another company. If a prospective
receiver refuses to sign a confidentiality agreement, there are alternatives.
Do not disclose anything, or disclose only enough to generate sufficient
interest to obtain a confidentiality agreement. A telephone call to a mergers
and acquisitions department or to a president's office might result in
directions to a person who has authority to waive a &quot;no confidentiality&quot;
policy. You can also disclose what it does, not how to it does it. Do not
disclose details or how your technology works without a confidentiality
agreement. </P>

<P><B>Elements/sections of a tailored confidentiality agreement </B></P>

<P>A confidentiality agreement is a paper signed by an information receiver
promising to evaluate and test a technology, but not to use or to reveal,
that information in the absence of a further agreement. It may be a one
page letter or a multiple page formal document. </P>

<P>A good confidentiality agreement contains a consideration, a term, e.g.
for a period of five years, a requirement that information be labeled as
&quot;Private&quot; or &quot;Confidential&quot;, and an understanding that
information be in written form, or if given orally, that it be immediately
reduced to writing. </P>

<P>It is usual, although not necessary, in a confidentiality agreement
that confidentiality be waived for information which the receiver proves
was in his possession prior to the disclosure, was received from a third
party who had the right to disclose that information, or which was generally
known in the industry. </P>

<P>A good agreement has several sections. The agreement should be titled
for easy understanding. It may be called &quot;Confidentiality Agreement&quot;,
&quot;Non Disclosure Agreement&quot;, or simply &quot;Disclosure Agreement&quot;.
The title indicates the purpose of the agreement. </P>

<P>The first preliminary paragraph of the agreement should include both
the date of the agreement and an identification of the parties. Care should
be taken to make sure that the correct names of the organizations are used.
It is also useful to add the addresses of the organizations, unless they
appear later in the agreement. Short names such as &quot;Owner&quot; and
&quot;Receiver&quot; should follow the correct legal names. </P>

<P>The second paragraph should state the scope and purpose of the agreement.
For example, the purpose of the agreement may be to enable the receiving
party, the receiver or the recipient to review and to evaluate confidential
intellectual property of the owner or discloser. The scope of the agreement
may be all of the intellectual property which is disclosed to the receiver
by the owner. </P>

<P>A third paragraph may recite the consideration. In some states it would
be useful to add an actual monetary consideration, such as &quot;In consideration
of $10 in hand paid to the Receiver by the Owner, the receipt of which
is hereby acknowledged.&quot; In most cases, it would be sufficient to
state, &quot;In consideration of the disclosure of confidential intellectual
property of the Owner for the purposes of confidential review by the Receiver,
the parties agree to the following terms and conditions.&quot; </P>

<P><B>Definitions </B></P>

<P>The first numbered paragraph of the agreement should be &quot;Definitions&quot;.
Although the Definitions paragraph appears first in the agreement, it should
be written last. When specific words with specific meanings are used later
in the agreement, the words should be capitalized and used throughout the
agreement in the same exact form. The capitalized words should be listed
and explained in the definitions. For example, the word &quot;Technology&quot;
may mean one thing throughout, the word &quot;Information&quot; may have
special meaning, &quot;Drawings&quot; may have another meaning, &quot;Media&quot;
may have a specific meaning, &quot;Codes&quot; may have a specific meaning,
and &quot;Software&quot; may have a specific meaning. </P>

<P><B>Use Limitations </B></P>

<P>The receiver's use limitations for the confidential property of the
owner may be specified. As an example, use may be limited to testing of
the products and not for manufacturing of the products. Use may be limited
to the making of a machine for the specific purpose of testing the machine
for a number of hours. Use may be limited to the evaluating of software.
The use may also permit modifying of the property and provide that a report
of modifications and an assignment of the modifications be made to the
owner. </P>

<P><B>Protection of Confidentiality </B></P>

<P>The agreement should include a statement that the receiver acknowledges
that the owner owns the technology and information. The agreement should
include a requirement for treatment of confidentiality of the underlying
property. The agreement might: </P>

<LI>require the recipient to treat the property with the same confidentiality
that it treats its own confidential property; <BR>
</LI>

<LI>specify that the recipient make no copy, or permit only a specific
number of copies while perhaps requiring that (a) each copy be marked &quot;Confidential&quot;,
(b) be numbered, (c) become part of the confidentiality agreement, and
(d) become part of the property owned by the discloser; <BR>
</LI>

<LI>include a limitation on personnel, either by number, by job description
or by the names of those who would be able to see the confidential intellectual
property; <BR>
</LI>

<LI>require that each person coming into contact with the confidential
property agree to maintain a confidentiality; and, <BR>
</LI>

<LI>require the recipients' employees to sign a copy of the confidentiality
agreement before having access to the property. </LI>

<P>A paragraph in the agreement should require that the receiver not only
treat all of the information as confidential, but also treat the fact that
it is considering the information as confidential. The discloser would
not want the fact that the receiver was considering the materials to become
general information in an industry in the event that that first receiver
rejected the materials and the discloser wished to disclose the material
under a confidentiality agreement to a second receiver. Often a receiver
requires confidential treatment of the fact that it is considering or has
considered the technology. </P>

<P><B>Legal Jurisdiction in Case of Dispute </B></P>

<P>A final paragraph of the agreement should state the laws of the state
under which the agreement is to be interpreted if enforcement of the agreement
is necessary. </P>

<P>It is often advisable to add a paragraph in the agreement that the agreement
is non-assignable and non-transferable by the receiver without the prior
written consent of the discloser. If the receiver is a subsidiary of a
parent corporation, it may be specifically advisable to exclude the parent
corporation from access to the material. In the event that the receiver
wishes to provide access to the materials to the parent corporation or
to any of its employees, it would be advisable to include the parent corporation
in the definition of the parties and to obtain a signature from the parent
corporation. </P>

<P>In the event that the evaluation under the confidentiality agreement
is successful and should the receiver wish to enter a licensing or purchase
agreement or a joint venture, it is desirable to: </P>

<LI>require that the receiver segregate all of the confidential property,
related reports, materials and records produced by the receiver related
to that property, and </LI>

<LI>maintain that the property be segregated until the final agreement
is reached. </LI>

<P>A pre-form of a confidentiality agreement should not be used, but the
agreement should be tailored to the confidential intellectual property
to be transferred and to describe both the property generally and the materials
to be transferred as specifically as possible, without actually describing
the rights. The actual technology will not be transferred until after the
confidentiality agreement is signed, and then the technology will be transferred
with a cover sheet, which should include a schedule or a list of the technology
transferred. Receipt should be acknowledged by the receiver. </P>

<P><B>Conclusion </B></P>

<P>Confidentiality agreements offer a precise form of protection for technology
and information. The protection is not against appropriation in general
but is effective in preventing misappropriation by the receiver of property
who has signed an agreement. The particular confidentiality agreement should
be tailored for the specific technology that is disclosed, the receiver's
organization and business ownership, and the nature and extent of the necessary
evaluation, testing and dissemination. Specific steps should be stated
in the event the evaluation results in an indication of lack of interest
by the receiver. </P>

<P>One of the most important points to remember is to never disclose technology
or information before having a signed confidentiality agreement. Before
an agreement is signed, to generate interest in technology or information,
tell what it does but not how to do it. </P>

<H1>Agency Foci and Points of Contact</H1>

<P>This chapter describes briefly the research-and-development (R&amp;D)
program areas of a number of Federal agencies that offer funding for small,
technically and managerially competent R&amp;D firms. The descriptions
are based on information provided by the agencies. Completeness of listings
reflects the agency's willingness to provide information. Readers should
be aware that these are not comprehensive program descriptions, nor are
they a substitute for information obtained directly from the agencies.
</P>

<P>Accompanying each description is the name, address, and telephone number
of a contact point, usually a small business specialist. Fax numbers are
provided where available. Email addresses are included, as provided by
the various agencies. We have often included the same information on SBIR,
technology-transfer, and other general technical contacts. Also, where
it was provided to us, we have included the titles of relevant publications
and where to obtain them. </P>

<P><B>Please note government phones and addresses change frequently, so
there is a possibility of encountering numbers and addresses which are
not operational. Please contact the SBIR or Small and Disadvantaged Business
Utilization Offices for help in such instances.</B><BR>

<P>The <A HREF="http://www.usda.gov/">U.S. Department of Agriculture</A>
(USDA) manages a wide range of programs. It works to improve and maintain
farm income and to develop and expand foreign markets for agricultural
products. It helps to curb hunger, improve nutrition, and cure poverty.
Several programs address environmental and conservation issues on both
government and private lands. Through the Forest Service it manages vast
Federal lands. Other programs address food safety and food nutrition issues,
as well as other areas that involve the consumer of agricultural goods.
</P>

<P>USDA supports research to develop new knowledge and technology which
will insure an abundance of high quality agricultural commodities. Emphasis
is placed on knowledge which bears directly on the needs to: </P>

<P>1) manage and use the Nation's natural resources; </P>

<P>2) provide an adequate supply of wholesome, safe food products and other
agricultural products; </P>

<P>3) plan for future needs of agriculture; </P>

<P>4) determine the nutritional requirements of our population and disseminate
that information; and, </P>

<P>5) address rural and community development. </P>

<P>SBIR research is supported in nine broad topic areas: </P>

<P>1) Forests and Related Resources; </P>

<P>2) Plant Production and Protection; </P>

<P>3) Animal Production and Protection; </P>

adoption of standards expands marketing opportunities, and users are freed
of the constraints and frustrations of incompatible proprietary systems.
</P>

<P>Much of CSL's work consists of advising and assisting industry in developing
standards that satisfy user needs and yet accommodate innovations that
differentiate the products of competing vendors. To help protect information
in federal computer systems, CSL personnel advise and assist federal agencies
in planning computer-security programs, increasing awareness of the need
for computer security, and carrying out computer-security training. </P>

<P>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) research
and development interests encompass a wide scope of atmospheric and oceanic
activities. They include environmental assessments and studies as well
as conservation and development of the resources of the ocean with environmentally
safe techniques. The scope also includes mineral resources, fisheries,
and protection of marine mammals and other endangered species. In addition,
research studies are made into fundamental processes such as formation
of hard minerals on the ocean floor. Among other major responsibilities
of NOAA are the collection of data and production of charts and maps depicting
oceanic parameters. </P>

<P>NOAA's R&amp;D interests in environmental monitoring and prediction
are broad and include automation of meteorological observations, analysis,
and communication; remote sensing of environmental properties and phenomena;
monitoring of oceanic conditions; stratospheric measurements; applications
of satellite technology and development of ground equipment; weather modification
techniques; and modeling of atmospheric and oceanic processes including
climate variation. </P>

<P>The <A HREF="http://www.acq.osd.mil/">Department of Defense </A>(DoD)
has an active program which makes special efforts to identify small businesses
and small disadvantaged businesses with R&amp;D capabilities. Small businesses
and small disadvantaged businesses that are seeking information and advice
concerning DoD procurement policies and procedures beyond what is contained
in this document must contact each activity listed below that has responsibilities
which correspond to the expertise of the firm. </P>

<P>Through its R&amp;D programs, the Department of Defense seeks the most
advanced scientific knowledge attainable and the best possible equipment,
weapons, and weapons systems that can be devised and produced. This means
two things. First, it means seeking the best scientific and technological
sources consistent with the demands of the proposed procurement for the
best mix of cost, performance and adherence to schedules. Second, it means
unremitting efforts to increase the number of qualified sources, and to
encourage participation by small concerns, as well as others, in Defense
research and development. </P>

<P>In awarding research and development contracts, the Department of Defense
is primarily interested in technical competence. The proposal evaluators
want to see (in the proposal) that the contractor understands what the
project involves and that he/she either has or can get the facilities and
personnel necessary for the successful completion of the contract. After
the technical competence of the prospective contractor has been established,
the cost proposal will be considered. </P>

<P>Each small business should critically evaluate itself before submitting
a proposal for a Government contract. What are the limitations and potential
of its employees? How are their talents helped or restricted by the available
research and development facilities? In other words, is the firm as qualified
to do the work as others that may compete with it? </P>

<P>In implementing the requirements of the Small Business Innovation Development
Act of 1982 (P.L. 97-219), the Department of Defense issues two Small Business
Innovation Research (SBIR) solicitations each year. Those annual solicitations
are the vehicle through which the SBIR program thrusts of the Department
of Defense are announced. The participating components are the Army, Navy,
Air Force, Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, the Defense Nuclear
Agency, Ballistic Missile Defense Organization, and Special Operations
Command. </P>

<P>Most research and development projects for DoD fall within unclassified
areas. If, however, it is found during evaluation of a proposal that the
work will be in, or border on, a classified area, negotiation and administration
of any resulting contractual arrangement will take this into account and
appropriate classification guidance will be furnished. </P>

<P>Most DoD R&amp;D activities issue Broad Agency Announcements (often
called BAAs). Small firms interested in doing business with a specific
activity should ask the contact person provided in the text below if there
is a current BAA. </P>

<P>Readers should be aware that DoD's organizational structure is in transition.
We have tried to reflect the most current structure; however, it is likely
that some labs will be placed elsewhere organizationally or consolidated
with others during the life-span of this publication. </P>

<H2><B>Defense Agencies </B></H2>

<P>In addition to the military branches, a number of agencies within DoD
fund R&amp;D. This summary highlights the most important ones for small
companies. </P>

<P><B>Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency </B></P>

<P>The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is the central
research and development organization for the Department of Defense (DoD).
It manages and directs selected basic and applied research and development
projects for DoD, and pursues research and technology where risk and payoff
are both very high and where success may provide dramatic advances for
traditional military roles and missions and dual-use applications. </P>

<P>DARPA's primary responsibility is to help maintain U.S. technological
superiority and guard against unforeseen technological advances by potential
adversaries. DARPA's mission is to develop imaginative, innovative and
often high risk research ideas offering a significant technological impact
that will go well beyond the normal evolutionary developmental approaches;
and, to pursue these ideas from the demonstration of technical feasibility
through the development of prototype systems. </P>

<P>DARPA is organized into six R&amp;D offices: </P>

<P><TT>U.S. Army Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory </TT></P>

<P>Advancing knowledge of the cold regions through scientific and engineering
research and putting that knowledge to work for the Army, DoD and the Nation
is the responsibility of the Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory
(CRREL). Operating in cold regions requires appropriate equipment, training
and doctrine, often very different from those used in more temperate conditions.
These special requirements cover a broad range of military activities and
can incur significant cost or capability penalties. Special challenges
of cold regions exist on the more than 30% of the earth's surface that
is covered by ice or underlain with permafrost. In addition, persistent
and severe winter conditions occur in areas of Europe, Asia and North and
South America. </P>

<P>The capability to function in cold regions is often a significant cost
driver for military systems, and for military and civilian infrastructure
and environmental quality issues. CRREL provides the technology to allow
the Army and DoD to operate effectively in cold regions environments to
maintain national security and foster peace. CRREL also conducts civil
works research and development relevant to the Corps flood control, navigation
and regulatory mission. Having a single-focus cold regions R&amp;D organization
to provide expertise to the DoD, other federal, state, and local agencies
and the private sector is an investment strategy that results in an internationally
recognized center of expertise with unique state-of-the-art facilities
and a cost effective capability. </P>

for rotocraft. VPD has also been designated as the lead ARL element for
research in ground vehicle propulsion systems. This added mission is the
former responsibility of TACOM, but is not new to VPD. The host NASA facility
has conducted extensive ground vehicle propulsion research. </P>

<P>VPD actively seeks out opportunities for technology transfer in propulsion
research. VPD has joined with NASA in an increasing number of CRDA's that

<P>The Vehicle Structures Directorate (VSD), originally part of the Army
Aviation Systems Command, is responsible for developing and advancing technologies
in the areas of rotocraft aerodynamics and air/ground vehicle structures.
This component of ARL provides the Army with outstanding research facilities
by virtue of its location at the NASA Langley Research Center in Hampton,
VA. The ability to share these world-class NASA facilities affords the
Army access to state-of-the-art wind tunnels, noise chambers, and other
test equipment with only a nominal investment of Army resources. </P>

<P>ARL looks to VSD as the principal source of design and prototype testing
for a wide range of vehicles and components. VSD personnel use both Army-owned
and NASA-owned equipment to provide rotocraft crashworthiness testing and
predictions. This directorate also conducts testing on a wide array of
systems and components to determine their vibration and acoustic characteristics.
VSD's fatigue and fracture testing capabilities have already provided valuable
contributions in the design and development of metal and composite structures
for applications in commercial air and ground vehicles. </P>

research and lethality mechanism from the former Ballistic Research Laboratory
at APG, MD with the nuclear and directed-energy expertise and research
facilities at Adelphi, MD and Woodbridge, VA. Additional responsibilities
include developing advanced projectile and propulsion concepts and flight
modeling. The Low Observables Technology Office provides advanced concepts
to improve the survivability of Army materiel. WTD ensures that our soldiers
benefit from superior weaponry, which provides the edge in combat. </P>

<P>The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is the department
most concerned with people and the nation's human concerns. In one way
or another -- whether it is mailing out social security checks or making
health services more widely available or enhancing medical research --
HHS probably touches the lives of more Americans than any other Federal
agency. Because of this breadth of activities, it encompasses almost all
types of research and development from social science to biotechnology
to software. </P>

the disabled and for individuals with end-stage renal disease. HCFA is
concerned with the development of policies, procedures, and guidance related
to the program beneficiaries, providers of services such as hospitals,
nursing homes, and physicians; intermediaries who adjudicate claims, and
effective coordination with related Department programs, activities, and
organizations which are closely related to the Medicare program. </P>

<P>2) Medicaid -- The Medicaid program operates through grants to States.
It provides medical services to the needy and the medically needy. HCFA
is responsible for developing approaches to meet the needs of those who
cannot afford adequate medical care; providing technical assistance to
states and local organizations to extend the scope and content and improve
the quality of medical care programs for the needy; and serving as the
clearinghouse for information relating to the program. </P>

<P>3) Quality Assurance -- The HCFA quality assurance requirement was established
to carry out the quality assurance provisions of the Medicare and Medicaid
programs, and maternal and child health legislation of the Social Security
Act, as amended. This responsibility includes implementation of the Professional
Review Organization (PRO) program and the End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD)
program. It also includes the development and monitoring of health and
safety standards for providers of health care services, which were authorized
under earlier Medicare and Medicaid legislation. </P>

on structure and function of the aging nervous system and the behavioral
manifestations of the aging brain. Research areas include age-related changes
in the nervous system, especially as they affect sensory processes, learning,
memory, and sleep. Of special interest are studies of Alzheimer's disease
and other disorders associated with the aging nervous system, including
the causes, diagnosis, epidemiology, treatment, and management of such
disorders. Much of this research is carried out at NIA-funded Alzheimer's
Disease Centers. </P>

<P>As the Nation's principal conservation agency, the <A HREF="http://info.er.usgs.gov/doi/doi.html">Department
of the Interior </A>(DoI) has responsibility for most of our nationally
owned public lands and natural resources. DOI is composed of twelve major
purchasing activities: Bureau of Indian Affairs, National Park Service,
Fish and Wildlife Service, Minerals Management Service, Office of Surface
Mining, Reclamation and Enforcement, Bureau of Land Management, Geological
Survey, Bureau of Reclamation, Office of Administrative Services, National
Biological Survey, and Office of Aircraft Services. </P>

<P>The annual acquisition budget for the DOI is about $1.2 billion, of
which nearly 42 percent is spent on construction. Additionally, most of
DoI's appropriated research-and-development money is by law awarded to
specific states. Nonetheless, DOI recommends that direct-marketing efforts
be made to those bureaus and offices within the department that continue
to conduct research and development, although with limited funds, such
as the Bureau of Reclamation. </P>

<P><B>Bureau Of Reclamation </B></P>

<P>The Bureau of Reclamation manages, develops, and protects the countrys
water resources. The agencys initial purpose of reclaiming arid western
lands has expanded to a much broader responsibility for water and power
resource management. The Bureau of Reclamation is concerned with its role
in the total environment and hopes to enhance the publics understanding
of, and participation in, the management of water and renewable resources.
Non-structural answers to water problems will have priority. New techniques
for conserving, scheduling, and reusing water will be fundamental tools.
</P>

<P>Reclamation has for many years been a major producer to hydroelectric
power. Another new emphasis will be installing power plants at existing
lowhead structures. There are thousands of these opportunities in the United
States. Of greater initial impact are plans to upgrade existing power plants
with additional turbine-generators and by rewinding old generators. </P>

<P>The Bureau of Reclamation research program is mission oriented; directed
to solving immediate problems and developing new techniques associated
with the conservation, development, and use of the water and related land
resources. </P>

<P>Laboratory- and field-research efforts focus on improved engineering
structures, irrigation efficiency, water conservation, and water quality.
Emphasis is also given to improve power-generation efficiency and reliability.
The ecological impacts of water-resource development are being analyzed
to evaluate the effects of water projects and water-management operations
on local areas and river basins, and to develop improved techniques for
mitigation and enhancement. </P>

<P><B>Fish and Wildlife Service </B></P>

<P>The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) conserves, protects, and enhances
fish, wildlife, and their habitats for the continuing benefit of people.
FWS is the principal authority for migratory birds, certain internationally
threatened and endangered species, certain marine mammals, activities involving
wildlife, including that on lands under its control. </P>

<P>FWS has been involved in such core activities as research on fish and
wildlife, development and management of the National Wildlife Refuge System
and the National Fish Hatchery System, migratory-bird management, endangered-species
protection, law enforcement, and animal-damage control. As the field of
wildlife management has grown more sophisticated and appreciative of the
ecological factors determining fish and wildlife production, the mission
of FWS has increased these core activities to reflect the new mandates.
One example of this is the Habitat Preservation Program, which advises
other governmental and private organizations on how to develop economically
while reducing adverse effects on habitat and, thus, fish and wildlife.
</P>

<P>FWS is composed today of a headquarters office in Arlington, VA, and
a variety of field units and installations. These include national-wildlife
refuges, research stations and laboratories, cooperative-research units
at universities across the country, national fish hatcheries, and a nationwide
network of wildlife law-enforcement agents. </P>

<P>The Arlington contracting office is primarily responsible for formulating
and administering Service-wide policy and procedures governing contracting
and procurement. The Washington office procures major research projects
for all areas of the country. It also procures supplies, equipment, and
services for the Washington Fish and Wildlife Service staff. </P>

<P>FWS awards approximately $120 million in contracts annually. Among the
available opportunities are research-and-development contracts in the following
areas: </P>

<P>basic and applied research in biology <BR>
ecological-profile development <BR>
effects of energy production on habitats </P>

<P>Some opportunities are listed in the Commerce Business Daily, and FWS
maintains a Bidder's List plus uses the PASS list. The number of months
to process a proposal varies. </P>

<P>The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), the principal earth-science research
agency of the Federal Government, was established in 1879. The responsibilities
of USGS include collecting and providing information on the geologic structure
and geologic and hydrologic hazards of the United States; the quantity
and quality of the Nation's water resources; and the Nation's potential
energy and mineral resources. </P>

<P>USGS also provides cartographic and geologic information, maps, and
technical assistance through a program of national mapping. The need for
better natural resource information on geological processes has led the
U.S. Geological Survey to conduct research in such areas as earthquake
hazard reduction, geothermal energy, river quality assessment, and water
use in the United States, foreign countries, and parts of Antarctica. </P>

<P>USGS has three program divisions: the National Mapping Division, the
Geologic Division, and the Water Resources Division, which implement the

<P>MMS is the Bureau in the Department of the Interior that manages the
nations natural gas, oil and other mineral resources on the Outer Continental
Shelf (OSC), and collects and disburses about $4 billion yearly in revenues
from offshore federal mineral lands. </P>

<P>In order to have a sound offshore oil and gas leasing program, it must
be based on sound science, state-of-the-art technology, and the ability
to adapt to and accommodate new and advanced technologies. Two MMS programs,
in particular, provide the cornerstone for science-based decisionmaking
and offer contracting opportunities. </P>

<P>1) The Environmental Studies Program (ESP) was initiated in 1973 to
support the OCS natural gas and oil program. ESP provides information needed
for predicting, assessing, and managing impacts from offshore activities
to human, marine, and coastal environments. The research is conducted specifically
to identify and evaluate potential environmental problems associated with
offshore activities, identify possible mitigating measures to address these
problems, and to monitor the offshore activitys effects on the environment
to determine whether protection is adequate to require change. </P>

<P>The MMS ESP is a focused, mission-oriented program of environmental
and socioeconomic research. Studies are conducted to describe the fate
of potential OCS-related pollutants on the marine environment and in the
atmosphere. Large scale oceanographic circulation studies and modeling
of field observations are conducted to provide information for the oil
spill trajectory analyses. Studies are also conducted to relate physical
characteristics, biologic activity and habitat. Oceanographic studies designed
to evaluate effects of offshore activities and possible spills are conducted
as are social and economic studies. </P>

<P>2) The Technology Assessment and Research (TA&amp;R) Program focuses
research in oil and gas exploration and development safety, pollution prevention,
and oil spill clean up technologies. MMS contracts for research with business,
academia, and government labs. TA&amp;R research is geared to ensure that
OCS operators use the best available and safest technology available to
them. The findings of the research assist MMS to write requirements concerning
safe and environmentally sound operations. Current research projects include:
well controls studies (including blow out preventer tests); using advanced
materials for offshore facilities; the effect of human errors on offshore
safety; techniques to mitigate paraffin and hydrate build-up; using in-situ
burning and disperents on oil spills; developing a radiometer to measure
oil slick thickness. </P>

<P>MMS also manages the National Oil Spill Response Test Facility, located
in Leonardo, NJ. Individuals, businesses, and government agencies use the
facility to evaluate oil spill response equipment and procedures. Most
research and development contracting is handled by the Herndon, VA procurement
office. Unsolicited proposals and requests for solicitations should be
directed to: </P>

<H1><B>Department Of Transportation </B></H1>

<P>The <A HREF="http://www.dot.gov/">Department of Transportation </A>(DoT)
was formed in 1967 to plan and assist in the development of a balanced
transportation system for this Nation. U.S. transportation systems serve
the dual purpose of meeting the personal transportation needs of our citizens
and providing an essential component to the smooth working of a healthy
national economy. Meeting transportation needs is a responsibility in which
all levels of government and private enterprise are involved. The appropriate
Federal role is to support programs and activities that address national
transportation needs and priorities that would not otherwise be met. </P>

<P>The DoT role is to: </P>

<P>1) serve as the focal agency in the Federal Government for the development
and implementation for the coordinated National Transportation Policy;
</P>

<P>2) assist the States in developing and maintaining a highway system
capable of providing for interstate commerce and the national defense;
</P>

<P>3) provide capital assistance to repair and modernize existing mass
transit systems; </P>

<P>4) provide safe and reliable management of the air space and of facilities
within which the aviation system operates; and, </P>

<P>5) generally facilitate a safe, reliable, and efficient transportation
system. </P>

<P>The Department of Transportation's R&amp;D program is oriented toward
providing the information and new technology needed for its own operations
(e.g., air traffic control) and regulatory (e.g., automotive safety standards)
programs. The Department has no basic research program. Additional information
on R&amp;D contracting opportunities can be obtained from the appropriate
operating administration small business specialist. Questions that cannot
be resolved at the operating level may be presented to the Director, Office
of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization. </P>

<P>The Department of Transportation's Small Business Innovation Research
(SBIR) Program is managed by the Volpe National Transportation Systems
Center, Cambridge, Massachusetts. The center solicits proposals from small
businesses to address specific research needs of DoT. </P>

<P>The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) is responsible for administrating
the multi-billion dollar Federal-Aid Highway Program and for administering,
jointly with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, State
and community highway safety programs. Under the Federal-Aid Highway Program,
FHWA provides financial assistance to State highway agencies for planning,
designing, environmental assessments, constructing and rehabilitating the
Interstate Highway System, other National Highway System projects, and
those transportation related projects eligible for the Surface Transportation
Program. Under the Federal-Aid program and State and community highway
safety programs, individual States act as the contracting agencies responsible
for the expenditure of most of the available funds. </P>

<P>Under the Federal Lands Highway Program and the Emergency Relief Program
on Federally-Owned Roads, FHWA is responsible for working with Federal
land-owning agencies to design, procure, and administer the construction
or improvement of Federal roads. Under these programs, the FHWA procures
design and construction services and is responsible for the expenditure
of available funds. </P>

<P>The FHWA is the recognized authority on highway construction technology
and design. Much of its work contributes to advancements in the state-of-the-art
in various technologies. Under the Nationally Coordinated Program of Highway
Research, Development, and Technology, FHWA coordinates an extensive research,
development, and technology transfer program. The coordinated program includes
such major categories as safety, Intelligent Transportation (ITS), pavements,
structures, materials, policy, planning, environment and right-of-way,
and motor carrier transportation. The research program endeavors to improve
the quality and durability of highways and streets, reduce construction
and maintenance costs, and reduce the negative impacts of highway transportation.
The FHWA Technology Transfer Program, designed to encourage the application
of new technology by highway agencies, uses contractors with marketing
and training skills, as well as technical expertise, to present new technologies.
</P>

<P>Engineering disciplines involved in FHWA contracts include civil, mechanical,
geotechnical, chemical, hydraulic, electrical, environmental, and human
factors </P>

<P>The FHWA is increasing its emphasis on improving traffic safety and
reducing congestion through the application of advanced electronic, communications,
and sensor techniques. The FHWA is contracting for ITS operational tests
to evaluate technologies and institutional arrangements which can provide
user services to motorists and travelers in order to improve safety, air
quality, energy conservation and mobility. Each year FHWA solicits for
new ITS operational tests. Additionally, FHWA is partnering with states
and cities to undertake planning studies to assess applications of ITS
services and technologies on existing highway infrastructures. Most such
tests and studies require consortia of transportation agencies, academic
institutions, and private sector organizations to develop joint proposals
for such undertakings. When circumstances warrant outside assistance in
research work other than through contract agreements, FHWA may solicit
participation through grants, cooperative agreements, and collaborative
research agreements. </P>

<P>Contracting authority is delegated to the Office of Contracts and Procurement
in the Washington Headquarters and to the Eastern, Central, and Western
Federal Lands Highway Division Offices. The Office of Contracts and Procurement
awards all FHWA R&amp;D contracts and all contracts for services and equipment
in support of FHWA highway planning, research, training, and related support
services. The Office of Contracts and Procurement procures supplies, materials,
equipment, and professional services related to R&amp;D, construction,
and other program responsibilities. It also provides procurement services
to the Office of Motor Carriers to support the safety and motor transportation
mission. </P>

<P><B>National Highway Traffic Safety Administration </B></P>

<P>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has as its
goal to improve highway safety by reducing deaths and injuries from crashes
on our nation's highways. NHTSA has six divisions that handles its programs:
</P>

<P>1) Traffic Safety -- These programs involve programs and grants to states
and local communities to help deal with such issues as drunk driving, safety
belts, automatic crash protection, child safety seats, and police traffic
services. </P>

<P>2) Enforcement -- This Division makes sure motor vehicles meet safety
standards and investigates consumer complaints of possible defects. It
also checks to see if cars meet standards for fuel economy, theft prevention,
damageability, consumer information and odometer fraud. Its Auto Safety
Hotline (800-424-9393) serves consumers. </P>

<P>3) Rulemaking -- The Division develops standards that make motor vehicles
safer. The New Car Assessment Program develops information on how cars
fare in crash tests. The office also establishes Corporate Average Fuel
Economy Standards, which require minimum fuel efficiency requirements.
It requires identification numbers on vehicle parts in certain carlines
that are considered high risk for theft. It also sets the standard for
bumpers and requires consumer information on tires. </P>

<P>4) Research and Development -- The Division does the research, testing
and information collection and analysis of traffic crashes. It operates
the National Center for Statistics and Analysis. The studies are used to
develop the motor vehicle standards to help save lives, determine trends
in crashes, and compile information from accidents. The office seeks to
improve traffic safety by changing people's driving behavior. </P>

<P>5) Plans and Policies -- The programs here forecast highway safety problems
areas and develop recommendations for policies. The Division plans and
executes the administration's budget as well as evaluates the effectiveness,
benefits and costs of programs and standards. </P>

<P>6) Administration -- This Division handles personnel management, organization
planning, financial management, data systems and contracting. It also maintains
a public technical reference room for publications and reports and also
provides a public docket system for regulatory actions. </P>

<P>NHTSA enters into contracts with private industry, educational institutions,
non-profit organizations, and state and local governments for defects investigations,
crashworthiness programs, alcohol traffic safety programs, system operations,
emergency medical services, demonstration projects, safety manpower development,
driver/vehicle interaction, experimental safety vehicles, test and evaluation,
vehicle structures, occupant packaging, biomechanics, passive restraint
tests, computer support, management studies, and data acquisition. </P>

<P><B>Volpe National Transportation Systems Center </B></P>

<P>Located in Cambridge, Massachusetts, the John A. Volpe National Transportation
Systems Center (Volpe Center) develops integrated systems approaches to
critical transportation issues, particularly those which cut across multiple
modes of transportation. The Volpe Center, which operates under the policy
guidance of the Secretary of Transportation and the Administrator of the
Department of Transportation's Research and Special Programs Administration,
is unlike other government agencies. The Center does not receive funding
via &quot;line-items&quot; in the federal budget -- rather, it is funded
entirely by its customers. Its primary customer is the Department of Transportation,
but it also performs work for other government departments and agencies
including the Departments of Defense, Energy, Treasury, State, the Environmental
Protection Agency, and others. </P>

<P>The Volpe National Transportation Center has a 1100 person staff on
site with an equal number of Federal employees and contractor technical
specialists. Besides on-site staff, the Center uses the full range of government
contracting mechanisms. The civil service professional staff represents
a wide range of disciplines in engineering and the physical, social, and
managerial sciences. Most of the professional staff hold graduate degrees.
The Center serves as a bridge between federal, state, and local levels
of government and private industry and academia. It is structured to encourage
creative exchanges that lead to innovative and cross-disciplinary solutions
to complex transportation problems. </P>

<P>During its 25 year history, the Volpe Center has anticipated and responded
to transportation challenges of national significance in the following

<P>The United States <A HREF="http://www.epa.gov/">Environmental Protection
Agency</A> (EPA) implements the Federal laws designed to promote health
by protecting our nations air, water, and soil from harmful pollution.
EPA endeavors to accomplish its mission systematically by proper integration
of a variety of research, monitoring, standard-setting, and enforcement
activities. As a complement to its other activities, EPA coordinates and
supports research and anti-pollution activities of State and local governments,
private and public groups, individuals, and educational institutions. </P>

<P>Over the past two years, EPAs Office of Research and Development (ORD)
has substantially changed its organization and operation around risk assessment/risk
management paradigm to strengthen EPAs science base and improve its response
to complex environmental challenges of the future. This reorganization
includes the creation of the National Center for Environmental Research
and Quality Assurance (NCERQA) at EPA Headquarters, which represents a
major and renewed commitment by ORD to help EPA achieve the highest quality
of science. NCERQAs main purpose is to direct ORDs newly expanded external
research grants and fellowship programs, which are designed to involve
the nations top scientists and engineers in research issues of importance
to the Agency. NCERQA also provides managerial oversight of EPA quality
assurance and Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) programs. </P>

<P>The SBIR program supports high quality research projects dealing with
environmental engineering problems using new technologies. The program
also provides incentives for the conversion of this research into potential
commercial applications and technological innovations. In Phase I of this
three phase program, the EPA makes awards for six months of investigative
research to determine technical feasibility. Phase II is the principal
research effort. Phase III is intended to pursue potential commercial applications
of the research funded under the first two phases. </P>

<P><B>National Health &amp; Environmental Effects Research Laboratory </B></P>

<P>The National Health and Environmental Effects Research Laboratory (NHEERL)
goals are to identify and resolve, through short and long term ecological
and health research, the scientific issues that are responsive and relevant
to EPAs regulatory programs. To achieve these goals research is designed,
within a risk assessment context, to answer basic scientific questions
and reduce major uncertainties about effects produced by chemical and human
activities on human health and environment. </P>

<P>The NHEERL research program is focused on the potential effects of environmental
pollutants and other anthropogenic stresses on human health and ecosystems
in which we live. NHEERL is the focal point for toxicological, clinical,
epidemiological, ecological, and biogeographic research within the Agency.
NHEERL scientists create and apply biological assays and toxicologic assessment
methods, redictive pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic models, ecosystem function
theory, and advanced extrapolation methods to improve the scientific underpinnings
of the Agencys risk assessments and regulatory/policy decisions. NHEERL
fosters cooperative research projects with academic and other scientific
institutions to complement its intramural research. </P>

<P>NHEERL achieves its mission through the integrated activity on nine
research divisions, five of which focus on human health issues, and four
of which focus on ecological issues. The five health research divisions
are located in Research Triangle Park, NC where the NHEERL is headquartered,
and include Reproductive Toxicology, Experimental Toxicology, Environmental
Carcinogenesis, Human Studies and Neurotoxicology. Each of the four ecology
divisions, the Western Ecology Division (Cornwallis, OR), the Midcontinent
Ecology Division (Duluth, MN), the Atlantic Ecology Division (Narragansett,
RI), and the Gulf Ecology Division (Gulf Breeze, FL), has a geographic-based
and scientific focus. In addition to the nine research divisions, NHEERL
also directs the Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program (EMAP)
which seeks to determine the status and trends in the integrity of our
ecological resources. EMAP is managed through the NHEERL Office of the
Associate Director of Ecology and its activities cut across all of the
ecology divisions. </P>

<P><B>The National Exposure Research Laboratory </B></P>

<P>The mission of the National Exposure Research Laboratory (NERL) is to
provide scientific understanding, information and assessment tools that
will quantify and reduce the uncertainty in the Agencys exposure and risk
assessment for environmental stressors. Stressors include chemicals, biologicals,
radiation, and climate, land and water use changes. NERL characterizes
the sources of environmental stressors as well as the compartments of the
environment in which they reside or to which they move; delineates the
pathways through environmental compartments and the transformations of
stressor materials that determine the ultimate exposure of sensitive human,
ecological, and biological receptors; and studies and characterizes receptors
and their responses to predict or measure exposure of affected systems
to stressors. These studies provide effects researchers and risk assessors
with information on the sources and the intensity of stressors, pollutant
transport and transformations, potential exposure to affected human, ecological,
and biological systems, plus state-of-the-science source-to-receptor predictive
exposure models applicable at site, water-shed/regional and global scales.
It also provides risk managers with receptor-back-to-source and stressor-back-to-cause
assessment techniques for evaluation of alternative mitigation, management
or restoration strategies from an exposure perspective. The latter is accomplished
by developing and applying integrated multimedia stressor exposure models
and advanced information sciences technologies. This research is important
to the scientific research community and to environmental managers who
must evaluate the extent and significance of stressors in our world and
develop cost-effective management or remediation strategies to deal with
them. </P>

and other installations at various locations throughout the country. Each
installation has a specifically prescribed mission, with related tasks,
and is allocated the resources necessary for their accomplishment. Though
these NASA installations have unique &quot;in-house&quot; capabilities,
their research and operations are pursued mainly through private industry,
with the additional support of universities and other non-profit research
organizations. </P>

<P>An important method of doing business with NASA is through the submission
of relevant new ideas and concepts in the form of unsolicited proposals.
In general, most appropriate for the unsolicited approach is research of
a fundamental nature -- that which bears potential for advancing the state
of the art in a particular area, contributes to knowledge of a specific
phenomenon, or provides fundamental advances in engineering or the sciences.
In addition, proposals may define problems and present possible solutions
to the problems, developmental or otherwise, which are within NASA's areas
of concern. Proposals of this type should be submitted directly to each
NASA Installation (Attention: Proposals Control Officer) where it appears
there is interest. A minimum of five (5) copies is suggested. </P>

<P>NASA issues advance information in the form of &quot;letters of interest&quot;
and uses the &quot;R&amp;D Sources Sought&quot; procedure in the Commerce
Business Daily extensively, as well as reference to the Small Business
Administration's PASS System to ascertain small business capabilities and
maximize set-aside procurement opportunities. The extensive distribution
and awareness of the Research and Technology Objectives and Plans (RTOP)
manual has also proven to be an effective means for communicating NASA's
research and technology interests to small firms. In addition, small firms
are invited to participate in flight research experiments (Announcement
of Opportunities), in areas of their demonstrated expertise. Small, high
technology firms are also included in the distribution of information concerning
areas of specific research interest to NASA, which oftentimes leads to
fruitful unsolicited proposals. This latter information is widely distributed
in what are known as &quot;Dear Colleague&quot; letters. To be placed on
these lists, contact the relevant NASA office. Both type notices are also
announced in the Commerce Business Daily. </P>

<P>The Office of Space Flight (OSF) is NASA's principal arm for space flight
operations and utilization involving human space flight. It consists of
the following programmatic missions: flight to and from space for people
and cargo, operating habitable space facilities, and managing the utilization
of these facilities in support of NASA's space missions, such as space
missions from and to Earth. OSF operates the Space Shuttle and the Spacelab,
and is currently developing the U.S. segment of the international space
station. The Office of Space Flight also is responsible for institutional
management of the Kennedy Space Center, Florida; Marshall Space Flight
Center, Huntsville, Alabama; Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas; and
the Stennis Space Center near Bay St. Louis, Missouri. </P>

<P>The Office plans, directs, and executes the development, acquisition,
testing and operation of all elements of the Space Shuttle Program; plans,
directs and manages execution of pre-launch, launch, flight landing, post-flight
operations, and payload assignments; maintains and upgrades the design
of ground and flight systems throughout the operational period; procures
recurring system hardware; manages Spacelab development procurement and
operations; develops and implements necessary policy with other government
and commercial users of the Space Shuttle; and coordinates all associated
research. OSF is working with the Russian Space Agency to plan and execute
a series of joint missions that will involve flying cosmonauts aboard the
Shuttle and astronauts aboard the Mir space station. In 1995, a U.S. astronaut
was launched aboard a Russian rocket to Mir for a 115-day stay aboard the
space station, followed by a Shuttle docking mission to Mir to exchange
crew members. This mission was the first of up to nine joint Shuttle-Mir
missions, precursors to assembly and utilization of the international space
station. </P>

<P>NASA is leading an international effort to build and deploy into Earth
orbit a permanently manned space station. Elements of the space station
will be provided by Canada, Japan, Italy, nine European nations represented
by the European Space Agency, and Russia. The space station is essential
for advancing human exploration of space. The space station will be a permanent
outpost in space where humans will live and work productively for extended
periods of time. The space station will provide an advanced research laboratory
to explore space and employ its resources, and will provide the opportunity
to learn to build, operate and maintain systems in space. U.S. elements
of the space station will be launched aboard the Space Shuttle and assembled
in orbit, with first flight set for 1997. </P>

<P><B>Lewis Research Center </B></P>

<P>The major areas of research at Lewis today are aeronautics, aerospace
technology, space science and applications, and basic disciplines. Also,
Lewis is a supporting Center for work on chemical propulsion and expendable
launch vehicles. </P>

<P>Aeronautics studies at Lewis include work to improve engine efficiency
and reduce noise. For NASA's High Speed Research Program, Lewis engineers
are making supersonic cruise aircraft less costly to run and safer for
the environment than existing supersonic aircraft like the Concorde. Advanced
propulsion technology for high-performance military aircraft, such as the
highly maneuverable short takeoff, vertical landing (STOVL) aircraft, will
greatly improve aircraft performance. General aviation studies will reduce
fuel consumption with improved turbomachinery components, ceramic materials,
and advanced technology transmissions; and they will improve safety through
advanced anti-icing and deicing technology. </P>

<P>In aerospace technology, Lewis is working to develop solar concentrator
arrays for space power systems. The arrays will collect and concentrate
sunlight for conversion to electrical power. The Center is responsible
for the planning and early technology development work that will lead to
the first demonstration of a joint U.S.-Russian solar Dynamic Power System
aboard the Mir space station in 1997. As NASA's Center of Excellence for
space power systems, Lewis is performing specific primary and support tasks
for the development of the photovoltaic power modules and electrical power
distribution system for the international space station. Researchers at
Lewis are increasing the life of battery cells for lower-cost power in
space. Work in space electronics is expanding to include expert, or intelligent,
systems which can help detect, isolate, and diagnose problems, or schedule
loads for more efficient use of available power. Lewis is also developing
solar-based power technology for extraterrestrial surface missions to the
Moon and Mars. </P>

<P>Work in space science also includes in-space microgravity experiments
such as the Solid Surface Combustion Experiment flown on the space shuttle.
In addition, the Advanced Communications Technology Satellite (ACTS), developed
at Lewis, will service networks containing thousands of ground terminals.
With a communications capacity three times that of a conventional satellite
of the same weight, ACTS will greatly improve mobile, aeronautical, and
shipboard satellite communications. </P>

<P>Researchers are also carrying on the Lewis tradition of studying basic
disciplines such as materials science and technology, structural mechanics,
life prediction, internal computational fluid mechanics, heat transfer,
and instruments and controls. </P>

<P><B>George C. Marshall Space Flight Center </B></P>

<P>The George C. Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) serves as one of the
primary NASA centers for design and development of space transportation
systems, orbital systems, scientific and applications payloads, and other
systems for present and future space exploration. Principle MSFC roles
include rocket propulsion systems; design and development of manned vehicle
systems; Spacelab mission management and payload definition; design and
development of large, complex and specialized automated spacecraft; and
management of space processing activities. Also, MSFC has a primary role
in the development and processing of science and applications experiments
and for the conduct of energy-related system studies. In addition, MSFC
conducts R&amp;D and is involved in the study and definition of future
programs, including the development of complex space structures, space
propulsion systems, materials engineering, materials processing in space
experiments, satellite power system definition, fundamental electronics,
and payload systems analysis and integration. </P>

<P>Major programs of MSFC include: </P>

<P><IMG SRC="SBIRV320000000.gif" ALT="SBIRV320000000.gif" HEIGHT=16 WIDTH=6>Space
Shuttle: Marshall is responsible for the design, development, test, and
evaluation of the Space Shuttle Main Engine, the Solid Rocket Booster,
the Solid Rocket Motor, and the External Tank. Major Space Shuttle vehicle
and component testing is being conducted by MSFC. MSFC also is managing
the Advanced Solid Rocket Motor which NASA plans to develop as a means
of materially improving the safety, reliability and performance levels
of the current redesigned Solid Rocket Motor. Marshall has the lead for
development of the Shuttle-C, an unmanned cargo element which would give
greater flexibility to the present Space Transportation System and would
provide an Earth-to-orbit lift capability up to three times that of the
present Space Shuttle. Marshall also has the lead for development of propulsion
technology for the Advanced Launch System, designed to reduce costs of
placing cargoes in Earth orbit by an order of magnitude. </P>

<P><IMG SRC="SBIRV320000000.gif" ALT="SBIRV320000000.gif" HEIGHT=16 WIDTH=6>Spacelab:
Marshall has program responsibility for this international cooperative
program between NASA and the European Space Agency. Designed as a versatile
modular laboratory to be carried in the Shuttle Orbiter bay, Spacelab is
a stepping-stone to Space Station Freedom. It provides researchers with
modules in which they can conduct research, and unpressurized pallets which
hold instruments requiring direct exposure to space. </P>

<P><IMG SRC="SBIRV320000000.gif" ALT="SBIRV320000000.gif" HEIGHT=16 WIDTH=6>Payloads
and Missions: Marshall has mission management responsibility for many of
the Spacelab missions and for other scientific missions flown aboard the
Space Shuttle. Marshall's mission management responsibility includes providing
the focal point for planning, integration, training, and operations. The
Center is also responsible for definition and development of some instruments
and equipment, and for maintaining the interface between the user community
and the Shuttle. </P>

<P><IMG SRC="SBIRV320000000.gif" ALT="SBIRV320000000.gif" HEIGHT=16 WIDTH=6>Materials
Processing in Space: Marshall is responsible within NASA for exploring
and developing the potential for materials processing in space. Growth
of superior single crystals for solid-state electronics, pure metals and
alloys, high-strength composite materials, and separation of living cells
for pharmaceutical products all show great promise. </P>

<P><IMG SRC="SBIRV320000000.gif" ALT="SBIRV320000000.gif" HEIGHT=16 WIDTH=6>Space
Telescopes: The Hubble Space Telescope is managed by MSFC. Designed for
servicing while in orbit, it will be visited every few years by astronauts
who will do routine maintenance and replace instruments as the technology
improves. The telescope is the first of NASA's four &quot;Great Observatories&quot;.
The Advanced X-Ray Astrophysics Facility, also being managed by Marshall,
is another of the &quot;Great Observatories&quot; launched in 1990. It
will study X-ray emissions from some of the most violent events in the
universe -- neutron stars, pulsars, quasars, and black holes -- which can
penetrate the clouds of dust and interstellar debris which otherwise shroud
many galactic and intergalactic mysteries. </P>

<P><IMG SRC="SBIRV320000000.gif" ALT="SBIRV320000000.gif" HEIGHT=16 WIDTH=6>Flight
Experiments: Marshall is active in the development of flight experiments
for the Space Shuttle and other vehicles and currently has more than 20
experiments approved for flight. Examples include the study of gamma ray
bursts and transients; evaluation of the potential for tracking and prediction
of severe storms by satellite; materials processing; and experiments to
determine the effects of long duration exposure of materials and equipment
to a space environment. </P>

<P><IMG SRC="SBIRV320000000.gif" ALT="SBIRV320000000.gif" HEIGHT=16 WIDTH=6>Space
Station: In the development of Space Station Freedom, MSFC has responsibility
for designing the Habitation and Laboratory Modules where crew members
will live and work. Marshall also has responsibility for logistics elements,
fabrication of the primary structure for the Resource Nodes, development
of the Environmental Control and Life Support System, internal components
of the audio/video and thermal control systems, as well as for operational
capability development for users in the Laboratory Module. </P>

<P><IMG SRC="SBIRV320000000.gif" ALT="SBIRV320000000.gif" HEIGHT=16 WIDTH=6>Upper
Stages: Marshall has been designated the lead Center for the Inertial Upper
Stage, the Transfer Orbital Stage, and Payload Assist Modules. The first
two systems boost payloads to orbits higher than the shuttle can provide.
The latter is designed to launch a spacecraft from the shuttle on a planetary
mission. Marshall also manages the Orbital Maneuvering Vehicle, a reusable
space utility tug designed to deliver and retrieve payloads and satellites
at orbits not otherwise achievable. </P>

<P>The programs of the <A HREF="http://www.nsf.gov/">National Science Foundation</A>
(NSF) are of interest mainly to those small businesses with strong capabilities
in scientific or engineering research or in science-based innovative technology.
Competition for awards from NSF is intense and only high-quality research
proposals are supported. </P>

<P>NSF supports scientific, engineering, and education research and provides
most of its support in grants to assist specific projects. NSF supports
projects in the following program areas, including interdisciplinary combinations
of these: physics; chemistry; materials research; mathematical sciences;
astronomy; atmospheric sciences; earth sciences; ocean sciences; polar
sciences, engineering, and operations; integrative biology and neuroscience;
molecular and cellular biosciences; environmental biology; biological instrumentation
and resources; social, behavioral, and economic research; advanced scientific
computing; computer and computation research; networking and communications
research and infrastructure; microelectronic information-processing systems;
information, robotics, and intelligent systems; electrical and communications
systems; design, manufacture, and industrial innovation; chemical and transport
systems; civil and mechanical systems; bioengineering and environmental
systems; education and human resources; and technologies relevant to next-generation
vehicles. NSF also supports a limited number of studies in science-information
research and technology, science policy and technology assessment, and
scientific personnel and industrial R&amp;D data and analyses. </P>

<P>NSF does not support development, testing, pilot-plant or demonstration
projects; that is, NSF funds the &quot;R&quot; of R&amp;D. Proposals for
the general production or marketing of products also are not funded. NSF
does not itself operate any laboratories or pilot plants and, therefore,
does not procure laboratory or research equipment for its own use, nor
does it fund research that duplicates research supported by federal-government
mission agencies. For example, NSF does not support projects in weapons
systems, clinical medicine, energy, the arts and humanities, business administration
or methods, or social work. Proposals directed at research that is the
specified responsibility of other agencies will have a low priority for
funding by NSF. </P>

<P>Generally, NSF research awards are made in response to both solicited
and unsolicited proposals, with most awards to small firms made in response
to solicited proposals under NSF's Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)
Program. Small businesses can participate in essentially all program areas
of NSF, mostly through the SBIR program. NSF welcomes proposals on behalf
of all qualified scientists and engineers and strongly encourages women,
minorities, or handicapped scientists and engineers to compete fully in
the programs described here. </P>

<P>Unsolicited proposals may be submitted to NSF at any time but NSF suggests
prior discussion with appropriate NSF program managers. In certain circumstances,
there are explicit deadlines. Program solicitations and Requests for Proposals
(RFPs) are announced in the Commerce Business Daily. The Small Business
Innovation Research and Small Business Technology Transfer solicitation
are also announced to businesses through the NSF small-business mailing
list. Both solicitations and RFPs use specific deadlines for proposals.
</P>

<P>Cost sharing, ranging from nominal to substantial, is required by statute
on unsolicited research proposals. For proposals in response to solicitations
or RFPs, statutory cost-sharing is not required, and awards may provide
for full allowable costs and fees where appropriate. </P>

<P>Each formal proposal is subject to a comprehensive peer-review process,
in which it is evaluated by scientists, engineers, users, or other experts
knowledgeable in the subject matter. Reviewers may be drawn from NSF, other
government agencies, or from the academic, private, and not-for-profit
communities. To minimize conflicts of interest, NSF avoids having proposals
from businesses reviewed by business competitors. In accordance with the
Bayh-Dole Patent Act, small businesses will receive world-wide commercial
rights in all patentable inventions coming out of an NSF supported research
project. </P>

<P>Publication of research results in the open literature is normally expected,
but special arrangements may be requested in the case of inventions and
proprietary information. </P>

<P>The mission of the <A HREF="http://www.nrc.gov/">Nuclear Regulatory
Commission </A>(NRC) is to assure that civilian uses of nuclear materials
in the United States -- as in the operation of nuclear power plants, or
in medical, industrial or research applications -- are carried out with
proper regard and provision for the protection of public health and safety,
the environment, and national security. The NRC licenses and regulates
nuclear-reactor operations and other activities involving possession and
use of nuclear materials, including transporting and disposing of nuclear
materials and wastes. The NRC inspects nuclear materials, and safeguards
them from theft and sabotage. It also issues and enforces nuclear-material
rules and regulations. </P>

<P>The goal of the Office of Nuclear Regulatory Research (RES) is to ensure
that sound technical bases are available for timely rulemaking, and related
decisions, in support of NRC licensing and inspection. RES is also responsible
for implementing Commission policies on safety issues and reviewing licensee
submittals regarding individual plant examinations and probabilistic risk
assessments. </P>

<P>Responsibility for nuclear-safety research precludes any involvement
in research whose purpose is to enhance the attractiveness of nuclear power;
therefore, research programs are designed primarily to assure public health
and safety and to protect the environment. The principal areas of research
interest in NRC include: Reactor Safety; Aging of Components; Severe Accidents;
Accident Management; Human Performance; Environmental Effects and Radiation
Protection; Waste Management; and Probabilistic Risk. </P>

<P>Research projects are carried out by the Department of Energy's National
Laboratories (Argonne, Brookhaven, Idaho, Los Alamos, Oak Ridge, and Sandia)
since they possess unique facilities. Other research contracts are awarded
to universities and private companies. Small businesses may be interested
in performing research in the following program areas: </P>

<P>Engineering Technology for Nuclear Power Plants including aging, material
and mechanical engineering as well as seismic and structural engineering;
safety and low-level waste disposal; Radiation Protection and Health Effects;
severe accidents; Risk Analysis, Human Factors; Advanced Reactor Research,
and Thermodynamics. </P>

<P>The <A HREF="http://www.sba.gov/">Small Business Administration </A>(SBA)
was established to &quot;aid, counsel and protect&quot; the interests of
small businesses. One of SBA's objectives is ensuring that small concerns

opportunity in SBA is in the Office of Economic Research of the Office
of Advocacy. </P>

<P><B>Office of Economic Research, Office of Advocacy </B></P>

<P>The Office of Economic Research in the Office of Advocacy has two extramural
research programs. The larger starts with an annual Request for Proposals,
which has a number of specified work statements plus two open topics on
small-firm contributions and barriers to small-firm effectiveness. The
smaller program responds to unsolicited research proposals, for which funds
are limited. An unsolicited research proposal must include sufficient detail
to permit Advocacy to determine whether support could be worthwhile and
whether proposed work could benefit the Office of Advocacy's research and
development or other mission responsibilities. </P>

<P><A NAME="Char"></A>
<HR></P>

<H3>Characteristics <BR>
</H3>

<P>Characteristics include the science(s) underlying the technology, state
of development (concept, fundamental research, applied research, development,
off-the-shelf), efficacy (how well the technology works), fragility (how
consistently the technology works under what conditions), scope (operations
affected), trailability (ability to implement the technology in small pieces
or over limited time frames), adaptability (ease of modifying the technology
for the receiving organization), and packaging (how tightly integrated
the physical objects and know-how that comprise the technology are), and
probable permissible price range. </P>

<P><A NAME="copy"></A>
<HR></P>

<H3>Copyright </H3>

<P>Copyright is a right to a literary production (which can include a software
code as well as books) and which gives the holder an exclusive right to
make copies of the literary item, publish them, and sell them for a period
of time. What is protected is the form of the expression of the idea, not
the underlying idea. In the U.S., a copyright is automatically granted
when an embodiment of an idea is made, and if an encircled C, the name
of the owner, and the year of first publication are added to the expression.
Enforcing the right in court against infringers requires registration with
the <A HREF="http://lcweb.loc.gov/copyright/">U.S. Copyright Office</A>,
part of the Library of Congress. If the registration is made within three
months of the first publication date, rights to statutory damages and attorney's
fees in suits against infringers can be obtained. </P>

<P><A NAME="intell"></A>
<HR></P>

<H3>Intellectual Property </H3>

<P>Intellectual property is the legal name for the technology, the ideas,
and ways of combining ideas and technology. </P>

<P>In all Federally funded phases, small businesses have the right by law
to retain patents resulting from the R&amp;D. Yet this is not an automatic
process. If the company elects to retain the rights to an invention that
occurs during a period of federally-funded R&amp;D, it must declare a discovery
and make a formal act of election. </P>

<P>Be aware that special rules apply to the STTR program. Before receiving
an STTR award, a small business must negotiate a written agreement between
the small business concern and the research institution, allocating intellectual
property rights and rights, if any, to carry out follow-on research, development,
or commercialization. The small business concern must submit this agreement
to the awarding Federal agency on request; either with the proposal or
at any time thereafter. </P>

<P>Under U.S. law, intellectual property can be protected by three tools:
<A HREF="glossary.htm#pat">patent</A>, <A HREF="glossary.htm#copy">copyright</A>,
and<A HREF="glossary.htm#ts"> trade secret</A>. </P>

<P><A NAME="literate"></A>
<HR></P>

<H3>Literature Review/Literature Search</H3>

<P>Literature reviews (sometimes called literature searches) seek out relevant
articles in libraries, on the Internet, or both for review. The articles
are then examined for pertinent information. It is important to remember
the literature selected must be related to the questions motivating the
search. Trade literature is far better than scholarly journals for answering
most marketing questions. </P>

<P><A NAME="pat"></A>
<HR></P>

<H3>Patent </H3>

<P>A patent is a right to an invention that is granted by the Government
and that gives the holder an exclusive right to use an invention during
a period of time. In the United States, before a patent can be issued,
the inventor must demonstrate his or her invention is new and non-obvious.
To be new, an invention must not have been known nor made by others in
the U.S. The invention can also not have been previously patented or presented
in a publication prior to the claimed date on which the invention was made.
Patents are handled by the <A HREF="http://www.uspto.gov/">U.S. Patent
Office</A>, part of the Department of Commerce.</P>

<P>Non-obvious is established with reference to what would be obvious to
a person of ordinary skill in the relevant technology (or technologies)
at the time of the invention. A general rule is that the more complicated
the technology and the greater the rate at which it is developing, the
higher the skill-level of that hypothetical ordinary person. Non-obvious
is determined by examining prior patents, technical publications, and non-secret
work being conducted. Usually some aspect of an invention will be non-obvious
and thus capable of being patented. </P>

<P>It is important to recognize that different rules apply in different
countries. In the U.S., you have one year from the time of first disclosure,
use, publication, or sale of an invention to patent the invention. Where
more than one person or group makes a claim to be the inventor, the patent
goes to the person or group which can demonstrate priority in time. Overseas,
the rules are different. Usually the invention must be patented before
any public disclosure, use, publication, or sale. In case of a dispute,
priority goes to the first person or group to apply for a patent, regardless
of who may actually be the inventor. You can, however, get the same overseas
priority rights you would get from simultaneously filing overseas and in
the U.S. if you file in each relevant country within 12 months of a U.S.
patent application. </P>

<P><A NAME="SBIR1"></A>
<HR></P>

<H3>Phase I SBIR <BR>
</H3>

<P>Phase I is based on proposals solicited by participating agencies. These
solicitations contain topics on which small firms are invited to submit
proposals. The proposals describe the results the firm intends to attain,
the approach the firm will take, and how it will prove the feasibility
of its approach. Phase I projects typically run six months. </P>

<P>The object of this phase is to determine the technical feasibility of
a proposed project and the performance quality the small firm can provide.
Phase I enables the agency to address these questions with relatively small
agency investment, thereby increasing the efficiency with which Federal
R&amp;D dollars in Phase II are utilized. </P>

<P><BR>
<A NAME="SBIRII"></A></P>

<H3>Phase II SBIR <BR>
</H3>

<P>The objective of Phase II is to create a prototype. Up to 50% of an
award can be subcontracted out to accomplish Phase II work. Phase II projects
typically run two years. </P>

<P>Only firms which have successfully completed Phase I can compete for
Phase II awards. Phase II awards are based on the results of Phase I, technical
merit, Agency priority, and commercial applications. <BR>
</P>

<P><A NAME="SBIRIII"></A></P>

<H3>Phase III SBIR <BR>
</H3>

<P>Phase III is conducted by the small business (including joint-ventures
or R&amp;D partnerships) to pursue commercial applications of the R&amp;D
conducted in Phases I and II. Non- Federal funds, including those obtained
through exercising the follow-on funding commitments are emphasized in
Phase III. Phase III, however, may also involve follow-on non-SBIR funded
R&amp;D or production contracts with a Federal agency for products or processes
intended for use by the U.S. Government. Because the production contract
is a follow-on to a competitive SBIR award, the production contract is
considered to be competitive awards under the Competition in Contracting
Act even if no new competition has been held. <BR>
</P>

<P><A NAME="STTR1"></A>
<HR></P>

<H3>Phase I STTR <BR>
</H3>

<P>Phase I determines the scientific, technical, and commercial merit and
feasibility of the proposed cooperative effort and the quality of performance
of the small business awardee concern. Once again a relatively small Federal
agency investment is made prior to consideration of further Federal support
at the Phase II level. The normal period of performance for Phase I is
approximately one year and generally awards do not exceed $100,000. Proposals
are evaluated on a competitive basis. <BR>
</P>

<P><A NAME="STTRII"></A></P>

<H3>Phase II STTR <BR>
</H3>

<P>Phase II continues the research or research and development effort from
Phase I. Only successful STTR Phase I awardees are eligible to participate
in Phase II. The normal period of performance for Phase II is approximately
two years and generally awards do not exceed $500,000. <BR>
</P>

<P><A NAME="STTRIII"></A></P>

<H3>Phase III STTR <BR>
</H3>

<P>Phase III involves commercial applications of STTR funded research or
research and development. It is funded by non-Federal sources of capital
or awards from non-STTR Federal funding sources. The competition for Phase
I and Phase II STTR satisfies any competition requirements of the Competition
in Contracting Act with respect to follow-on procurement. <BR>
</P>

<P><A NAME="specs"></A>
<HR></P>

<H3>Performance Specifications <BR>
</H3>

<P>Performance Specifications (Specifications) include function (materials,
process, or product technology), performance traits, and the capabilities
workers need to use the technology. <BR>
<A NAME="PI"></A>
<HR></P>

<H3>Principal Investigator (PI) </H3>

<P>The PI is the person who is responsible for the conduct of the research
project. The PI is almost always a senior researcher actively involved
in the day-to-day conduct of the effort. </P>

<P><A NAME="inst"></A>
<HR></P>

<H3>Research Institution </H3>

<P>A research institution is any organization which is a university, contractor-operated
federally funded research and development center, or a nonprofit institution
as defined in section 4(5) of the Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation
Act of 1980. In general, research institutions are universities, non-profit
laboratories, or laboratories belonging to the Departments of Defense,
Energy, Commerce (NOAA, NIST), USDA, Interior, EPA, NASA, or other agencies.
</P>

<P><A NAME="SB"></A>
<HR></P>

<H3>Small Business </H3>

<P>A small business is a for-profit concern that is independently owned
and operated, not dominant in its field, and has its principal place of
business in the U.S. At least 51% of the ownership (or voting stock) must
belong to U.S. citizens or lawfully admitted resident aliens. A small business
has no more than 500 full and part-time employees in it and all its affiliates.
Affiliates are companies in which one controls the other either directly
or indirectly through common ownership, common management, or contractual
relationships. Affiliation is found where two or more companies are under
the control of a common third party or parties. </P>

<P><A NAME="Niche"></A>
<HR></P>

<H3>Technology Niche <BR>
</H3>

<P>Most technologies can be used in applications that cut across traditional
industry lines. A Technology Niche is this set of applications. For example,
signal analysis techniques and non-destructive test and evaluation (NDT&amp;E)
instrumentation developed for military aerospace applications can be applied
to surveying commercial boats, non-invasive medical diagnostic equipment,
and assessing the internal structure of old growth timber. <BR>
<A NAME="ts"></A>
<HR></P>

<H3>Trade Secret </H3>

<P>A trade secret is a plan, process, tool, mechanism, or compound that
is known only to its owner and those of his employees in whom it is necessary
to confide. So long as it is kept secret, it is a form of protected property
and the owner may sue those who steal it for damages. Unlike patents, a
trade secret will not protect an invention against an independent discovery
by someone else. The most famous trade secret is probably the formula for
Coca Cola. </P>

(USA). The Olympic Peninsula is changing in response to environmentalconcerns,
international economic competition, and population growth. Althoughthere
is confusion and disagreement concerning the best way to react andrespond
to these changes, most citizens agree they want a community whichprovides
an excellent quality of life for families in an environmentally sound,sustainable
economy. Such an economy provides healthy, satisfying, decent payingjobs
for workers as well as the education, medical, cultural, and recreationalservices
and opportunities. The Olympic Peninsula Foundation is devoted toworking
for that economy.</p>

<p>OPF President, Philip Speser, developed the concept of a manufacturingtechnology
center in secondary wood products in order to enable utilization ofthe
full range of harvested wood from sustainable forestry. The concept isbeing
implemented by WoodNet, a flexible manufacturing network of 300 companieson
the Peninsula. A feasibility study was recently completed under funding
fromthe U.S. Economic Development Administration. For more information
contact GusKostopulos, Executive Director of WoodNet at (360) 452-2134.

<br></p>

<li><a name="forestry"></a><b>Forestry</b></li>

<p>Through a grant from the Bullitt Foundation, OPF was able to sponsor
focusgroups including representatives from diverse aspects of the forestry
industrywhich discussed forest issues. A primary focus of the Bullitt grant
is creatinga <b>Small Woodlot Owners Network.</b></p>

<li><a name="environmental education"></a><b>EnvironmentalEducation</b></li>

<p>1. Producing an interactive educational series which united students
withforesters, loggers, environmentalists and land owners through a program
withthe Port Townsend based <b>Learning Opportunities for Thinking People(L.O.F.T.)</b></p>

<p>2. Developing the <b>Wetlands Peer Education Project</b>, a cross-age
tutoringprogram funded by an E.P.A. grant. The project combined middle
and intermediateschool students and teachers in a special section on wetlands.</p>

<li><a name="stream restoration"></a><b>StreamRestoration</b></li>

<p>1. In 1994, OPF collaborated with Wild Olympic Salmon, a non-profitenvironmental
agency, and Jefferson Conservation District to administer a DNRgrant for
the <b>Jobs for the Environment Program.</b> Employing displacedtimber
workers to perform stream and habitat restoration, the program attractednational
attention and was featured in the January '95 issue of <i>Audubon</i>magazine.
</p>

<p>2. <b>Olympic Peace Trees</b> united 16-24 year olds from around the
globe withlocal youth to perform restoration projects in Jefferson County.
Combiningconflict-resolution with environmental awareness, the program
included streamand habitat restoration, tree planting, and trail building.</p>

<h1>Developing the Projects. Science Literacy Parameters.</h1>

<h1>Substantive Concept: Ecosystem.</h1>

<p>From A.A.A.S, <i>Benchmarks for Science Literacy</i>, page 117. </p>

<p>&quot;The concept of an ecosystem should bring coherence to the complex
array of relationships among organisms and environments that students have
encountered. Students' growing understanding of systems in general can
suggest and reinforce characteristics of ecosystems--interdependence of
parts, feedback, oscillation, inputs, and outputs. Stability and change
in ecosystems can be considered in terms of variables such as population
size, number and kinds of species, and productivity.</p>

<p>&quot;By the end of 12th Grade, students should know that</p>

<ul>
<li>Ecosystems can be reasonably stable over hundreds or thousands of years.
As any population of organisms grows, it is held in check by one or more
environmental factors: depletion of food or nesting sites, increased loss
to increased numbers of predators, or parasites. If a disaster such as
flood or fire occurs, the damaged ecosystem is likely to recover in stages
that eventually result in a system similar to the original one.</li>

<li>Like many complex systems, ecosystems tend to have cyclic fluctuations
around a state of rough equilibrium. In the long run, however, ecosystems
always change when climate changes or when one or more new species appear
as a result of migration or local evolution.</li>

<li>Human beings are part of the earth's ecosystems. Human activities can,
deliberately or inadvertently, alter the equilibrium in ecosystems.&quot;</li>
</ul>

<h1>Theoretical Concepts</h1>

<h2>System (page 266)</h2>

<p>Students should &quot;...reflect on the value of thinking in terms of
systems and to apply the concept in diverse situations. They should often
discuss what properties of a system are the same as the properties of its
parts, and what parts arise from interactions of its parts or from the
sheer number of parts. They should learn to see feedback as a standard
aspect of systems. The definitions of <i>negative</i> and <i>positive</i>
feedback may be too subtle, but students can understand that feedback may
oppose changes that do occur (and lead to stability), or may encourage
more change (and so drive the system toward one extreme or another). Eventually,
they can see how some delay in feedback can produce cycles in a system's
behavior.</p>

<p>&quot;By the end of the 12th grade, students should know that </p>

<ul>
<li>A system has some properties that are different from those of its parts,
but appear because of the interactions of those parts.</li>

<li>Understanding how things work and designing solutions to problems of
almost any kind can be facilitated by systems analysis. In defining a system,
it is important to specify its boundaries and subsystems, indicate its
relation to other systems, and identify what its input and its output are
expected to be.</li>

<li>The successful operation of a designed system usually involves feedback.
The feedback of output from some parts of a system to input of other parts
can be used to encourage what is going on in a system, discourage it, or
reduce its discrepancy from some desired value. The stability of a system
can be greater when it includes appropriate feedback mechanisms.</li>

<li>Even in some very simple systems, it may not always be possible to
predict accurately the results of changing some part or connection.&quot;</li>
</ul>

<h2>Model (page 270)</h2>

<p>&quot;...[E]mphasis should be placed on mathematical modeling because
it epitomizes the nature and power of models and provides a context for
integrating knowledge from many different domains. The main goal should
be getting students to learn how to create and use models in different
contexts, not simply to recite generalizations about models. They can acquire
such generalizations too, but that will occur through discussions of models
already studied. Research in developmental psychology implies that high-school
students may understand that the best model isn't found yet, or that different
people prefer different models while waiting for more evidence, but not
that there may be no &quot;true&quot; model at all.</p>

<p>&quot;By the end of the 12th grade, students should know that</p>

<ul>
<li>The basic idea of mathematical modeling is to find a mathematical relationship
that behaves in the same way as the objects or processes under investigation.
A mathematical model may give insight about how something really works,
or fit observations very well without any intuitive meaning.</li>

<li>Computers have greatly improved the power and use of mathematical models
by performing computations that are very long, very complicated, or repetitive.
Therefore, computers can show the consequence of applying complex rules
or changing the rules. The graphic capabilities of computers make them
useful in the design and testing of devices and structures and in the simulation
of complicated processes.</li>

<li>The usefulness of a model can be tested by comparing its predictions
to actual observations in the real world, but a close match does not necessarily
mean that the model is the only &quot;true&quot; model or the only one
that would work.&quot; </li>
</ul>

<h1>Methodological Concept</h1>

<h2>Inquiry</h2>

<p>The following capabilities are from &quot;Essential Academic Learning
Requirements&quot;, by the Subject Advisory Committee in Science, Washington
State Commission on Student Learning. These capabilities apply to the attitudes
important for the inquiry process itself. Inquiry is one of the essential
activities of science. It is the process of conducting investigations and
collecting evidence, whether by observation or some other method. </p>

<p>By the end of the 12th grade, students should be able to</p>

<ul>
<li>Make observations and draw inferences based on observations.</li>

<li>Identify questions and concepts which could guide scientific investigations.</li>

<li>Formulate testable hypotheses and explain the logical connections between
them.</li>

<li>Select and use the most appropriate tools, technologies, and information
sources for each scientific investigation.</li>

<li>Design and conduct an experiment controlling appropriate variables.</li>

<li>Work individually and collaboratively to analyze the experimental approach
used and suggest improvements.</li>

<li>Formulate and revise scientific explanations and models using logic
and evidence.</li>

<li>Report the methods, results, and conclusions of complex experiments
using a variety of methods.</li>

<li>Know and use safe approaches in carrying out investigations. </li>
</ul>

<h1>Habit of Mind</h1>

<h2>Disciplined Curiosity</h2>

<p>The following habit of mind is from &quot;Essential Academic Learning
Requirements&quot;, by the Subject Advisory Committee in Science, Washington
State Commission on Student Learning. The term, <i>disciplined curiosity</i>,
is ours. These habits apply to the attitudes important for the inquiry
process itself. Inquiry is one of the essential activities of science.
It is the process of conducting investigations and collecting evidence,
whether by observation or some other method. </p>

<p>By the end of the 12th grade, students should</p>

<ul>
<li>Understand that intellectual integrity requires recording and reporting
data accurately; giving credit to sources of information; evaluating alternative
scientific explanations in an open, intellectually honest way; and analyzing
the existing knowledge about a question/problem to determine what is, as

<h1>Skills</h1>

<h2>Computation and Estimation</h2>

<p>(pages 288-89) &quot;Computation is the process of determining something
by mathematical means... In the real world, there is no need for people
to make a calculation if the answer to the question is already known and
easily available; they just need to know how to look it up -- which is
of course something that scientists and engineers do frequently. But in
most situations, answers are not known, so making judgments about answers
is as much a part of computation as the calculation itself.... But a 'correct&quot;
answer is not necessarily a sensible one. If a computation leads to the
conclusion that an adult elephant weighs 1.2 pounds, most people know something
is wrong, even if they had estimated that the answer should be between
1 and 10, because elephants are enormous animals and a pound isn't much
weight. Reality tells them to check their computation. ... Science literacy
includes being able to use electronic tools thoughtfully and with confidence.&quot;
</p>

<p>(page 291) &quot;By the end of the 12th grade, students should be able
to</p>

<ul>
<li>Use ratios and proportions, including constant rates, in appropriate
problems.</li>

<li>Find answers to problems by substituting numerical values in simple
algebraic formulas, and judge whether the answer is reasonable by reviewing
the process and checking against typical values.</li>

<li>Make up and write out simple algorithms for solving problems that take
several steps.</li>

<li>Use computer spreadsheet, graphing, and database programs to assist
in quantitative analysis.</li>

<li>Compare data for two groups by representing their averages and spreads
graphically.</li>

<li>Express and compare very small and very large numbers using powers-of-ten
notation.</li>

<li>Trace the source of any large disparity between an estimate and the
calculated answer.</li>

<li>Recall immediately the relations among 10, 100, 1000, 1 million, and
1 billion (knowing, for example, that 1 million is a thousand thousands).</li>

<li>Consider the possible effects of measurement errors on calculations.&quot;</li>
</ul>

<h2>Communication Skills</h2>

<p>(page 295) &quot;In the scientific professions, tradition places a high
priority on accurate communications, and there are mechanisms, such as
referred journals and scientific meetings, to facilitate the sharing of
new information and ideas within various disciplines and subdisciplines.
Science-literate adults share this respect for clear, accurate communication,
and they possess many of the communication skills characteristic of the
scientific enterprise.... There is an aspect of quantitative thinking that
may be as much a matter of inclination as skill. It is the habit of framing
arguments in quantitative terms whenever possible. Instead of saying that
something is big or fast or happens a lot, a better approach is often to
use numbers and units to say how big, fast, or often, instead of claiming
that one thing is larger or faster or colder than another, it is better
to use either absolute or relative terms to say how much so.&quot; </p>

<p>(page 297) &quot;By the end of the 12th grade, students should be able
to</p>

<ul>
<li>Make and interpret scale drawings.</li>

<li>Write clear, step-by-step instructions for conducting investigations,
operating something, or following a procedure.</li>

<li>Choose appropriate summary statistics to describe group differences,
always indicating the spread of the data as well as the data's central
tendencies.</li>

<li>Describe spatial relationships in geometric terms, such as perpendicular,
parallel, tangent, similar, congruent, and symmetrical.</li>

<li>Use and correctly interpret relational terms such as <i>if...then...,
and, or, sufficient, necessary, some, every, not, correlates with, </i>and
<i>causes</i>.</li>

<li>Participate in group discussions on scientific topics by restating
or summarizing accurately what others have said, asking for clarification
or elaboration, and expressing alternative positions. </li>

<li>Use tables, charts, and graphs in making arguments and claims in oral
and written presentations.&quot;</li>
</ul>

<h2>Critical Response Skills</h2>

<p>(page 298) &quot;In everyday life, people are bombarded with claims
-- claims about products, about how nature or social systems or devices
work, about their health and welfare, about what happened in the past and
what will occur in the future. These claims are put forth by experts (including
scientists) and nonexperts (including scientists), by honest people and
by charlatans. In responding to this barrage, trying to separate sense
from nonsense, knowledge helps. </p>

<p>But apart from what they know about the substance of an assertion, individuals
who are science literate can make some judgments based on its character.
The use or misuse of supporting evidence, the language used, and the logic
of the argument presented are important considerations in judging how seriously
to take some claim or proposition.&quot;</p>

<p>(page 300) &quot;By the end of the 12th grade, students should</p>

<ul>
<li>Notice and criticize arguments based on the faulty, incomplete, or
misleading use of numbers, such as in instances when: (1) average results
are reported, but not the amount of variation around the average, (2) a
percentage or fraction is given, but not the total sample size (as in &quot;9
out of 10 dentists recommend&quot;), (3) absolute and proportional quantities
are mixed (as in &quot;3,400 more robberies in our city last year, whereas
other cities have an increase of less than 1%), or (4) results are reported
with overstated precision (as in representing 13 out of 19 students as
68.42%).</li>

<li>Check graphs to see that they do not misrepresent results by using
inappropriate scales or failing to specify the axes clearly.</li>

<li>Wonder how likely it is that some event of interest might have occurred
just by chance. </li>

<li>Insist that the critical assumptions behind any line of reasoning be
made explicit so that the validity of the position taken -- whether one's
own or that of others -- can be judged.</li>

<li>Be aware, when considering claims, that when people try to prove a
point, they may select only the data that support it and ignore any that
would contradict it.</li>

<li>Suggest alternative ways of explaining data and criticize arguments
in which data, explanations, or conclusions are represented as the only
ones worth consideration, with no mention of other possibilities. Similarly,
suggest alternative trade-offs in decisions and designs and criticize those
in which major trade-offs are not acknowledged.&quot;</li>
</ul>

<h2>Importance.</h2>

<h2>Identification and Significance of the Problem / Opportunity.</h2>

<p>Disabled persons whose terminal education achievements as young persons
arebelow their potential will inevitably face the same fate as other poorlyeducated
people: under-employment and disadvantage in the job market. Similarly,disabled
persons who fail to meet national academic standards are impeded / thwarted
from participating fully in the political and cultural life of the nation.
</p>

<p>Educators often use mentoring and supplemental educational experience
toaddress the needs of young people in danger of underachieving. Unfortunately,the
physical disabilities which make such interventions important also oftenmake
it difficult for disabled students to participate in mentoringrelationships
and supplemental educational experiences. One solution to thisproblem is
the use of computer-mediated-curricula, or CMC, in particular,Internet-Enhanced-Education,
or IE2. We emphasize Internet enhancement as theInternet facilitates low-cost,
easy communication with geographically dispersedmentors and access to data
and other electronic resources.</p>

<p>Recent advances in educational technology and methods are aggravating
theinability of disabled students to keep pace with their non-disabled
colleagues.In technology, the introduction of computers has had a major
impact. Forexample, for visually impaired students, the rapid adoption
of graphic userinterface (GUI), as indicated by Microsoft's Windows95 and
the Internet'sincreased use of graphics, makes computer literacy very difficult.
(f1.) Inteaching methods, the increased use of hands-on approaches and
interaction ofstudents with mentors in the community poises new challenges.
</p>

<p>Because of our own background as research scientists and volunteers
inpre-collegiate science education, we have seen the dilemmas poised by
newteaching approaches first hand in science literacy education. The currentrevolution
in science education teaches science literacy by having studentsactually
do science. It teaches that everyone can do science. It encourages teamwork
and group activity while emphasizing the importance of individualresponsibility
and judgment. It emphasizes science as a problem-solving method.It acknowledges
mathematics as an essential component of science, sincemathematics provides
the precise language by which science and technologydescribe objects and
events, characterize relationships between variables, andargue logically.
(f2.) The approach has been supported by a number ofstudies, including
the American Association for the Advancement of Science's<i>Science for
All </i>Americans and the just released <i>National ScienceEducation Standards
</i>by the National Research Council. (f3.)Corresponding to the revolution
in science education is a similar transformationin the teaching of mathematics.
(f4.) </p>

<p>Unfortunately, the tools being developed to aid students participating
inthis new way of teaching science, math, and other courses (community-basedprojects,
science kits, video-disks, Internet courses, etc.) are focused onnon-disabled
students. As we noted in our Phase One proposal, use of CMC and IE2as educational
techniques for physically-disabled pre-collegiate students isinfrequent.(f5.)
This fact is particularly disappointing given trendswithin professional
science and mathematics. Computer-aided research is foundacross the board.
For example, particle physics and deep space astronomy rely onInternet
links for coordinating teams of researchers and for accessing theresearch
instruments for experiments and observations (e.g. the accelerator atCERN
in France or the Hubble Space Telescope). Articles in <i>Science </i>discusshow
publication of scientific articles is increasingly going &quot;on-line.&quot;The
National Research Council notes that computer visualization of data is
oneof the most important trends in mathematics. </p>

<p>&quot;[Visualization] is one of the most rapidly growing areas of math
andscientific research. The first step in data analysis is the visual display
ofdata to search for hidden patterns. Graphs of various types provide visualdisplay
of relations and functions; they are widely used throughout science andindustry
to portray the behavior of one variable (e.g., sales) that is afunction
of another (e.g. advertising). ...Now computer graphics automate theseprocesses
and let us explore as well projections of shapes in higher-dimensionalspace.
Learning to visualize mathematical patterns enlists the gift of sight asan
invaluable ally in mathematical education.&quot;(f6.)</p>

<p>An inability to use computers and the Internet as effectively asnon-disabled
students discourages students from either participating in, andunderstanding,
what is going on in science and mathematics today. It alsoinhibits their
ability to use Internet as a resource in other educational andlife activities.
The Phase One project demonstrates that IE2 kits can provide animportant
educational resource for visually-impaired students. Although Phase Oneis
not yet finished, the excitement generated by our approach is clear. We
arevery enthusiastic. As researchers we all know how rare it is that a
projectreally &quot;works&quot; despite the inevitable difficulties which
must beovercome along the way. This project works. All the people involved
in thiseffort -- the teachers, the students, the school, our consultants,
potentialPhase III partners, organizations representing the visually-impaired
areencouraging us to go forward with a Phase II proposal.</p>

<p>Although the substantive focus of the Phase One kit is science education,
ourapproach and the tools used to create IE2 kits are as applicable to
IE2 forEnglish, social studies, or music as they are to science and math.
(The tool kitcan also be used to develop industrial training material and
&quot;intra-nets,&quot;that is, internal company web sites, for visually-impaired
people. As such itfacilitates meeting the objectives of the American with
Disabilities Act.) InPhase II, we shall build upon our Phase One results
to develop an authoring toolkit and manuals for creation of IE2 kits for
visually-impaired students. Asbefore, we use science and math as the subject
matter for testing our approach. </p>

<h2>Summary of Phase One.</h2>

<p>The Phase One project had the technical objective of developing, implementing,and
evaluating a prototype instructional kit for Internet-enhanced-education(IE2)
for use by disabled students. Included in the Phase One objective ispreparing
a training package for the teacher showing how to use IE2. </p>

<p>Phase One focused on classroom-oriented group activities. Approximatelythree-fourths
of the way through Phase One, we anticipate no problems in meetingthe Phase
One objectives. Our kit enables access to the Internet and, throughe-mail,
to competent social role models who mentor the individual students. Weused
science education, with an emphasis on environmental education, as theprototype
curricula. </p>

<h2>Research Design </h2>

<p>The Phase One project used the case study method.(f7.) In this method,
theresearch design has five components: </p>

<ul>
<li>the study questions.</li>

<li>its propositions, if any.</li>

<li>its unit(s) of analysis.</li>

<li>the logic linking the data to the propositions; and.</li>

<li>the criteria for interpreting the findings. </li>
</ul>

<h3>Study Question.</h3>

<p>The question for this study was: How can we beneficially apply Internet
as atool for education of physically disabled students? Our general presumption
isthat, all other things being equal, approaches have been shown useful
fornon-handicapped students will also work for handicapped students. Of
course,the presence of a disability means all other things are not equal.
We thereforeadded the presumption that methods proven successful for addressing
the uniquechallenges of disabled students of similar ages and grade levels
in othereducational tasks could be used here. </p>

<p>To study this question it was necessary to make a number of decisionsconcerning
foci. Given our interest in, and commitment to, pre-collegiatescience literacy,
we focused the substantive content of this project in thatarea. We selected
visual-impairment as the disability we would address. </p>

<h3>Propositions/Hypotheses.</h3>

<p>Our propositions, expressed as formal hypotheses, refined the researchquestion
to study the problem of IE2 general science literacy forvisually-impaired
students. </p>

<p>The first hypothesis defined the science education approach for thisproject.
</p>

<ul>
<li>The approach in the American Association for Advancement of Science's
(A.A.A.S.)science education initiative is as applicable to visually-impaired
students asfully-sighted students.</li>

<li>In the absence of data to the contrary, there is no reason to believe
thatstudents with physical disabilities should benefit less than other
students fromthe A.A.A.S.' approach to teaching science. </li>
</ul>

<p>A supplemental hypothesis was required to address the unique needs of
visually-impaired students. </p>

<ul>
<li>Methods proven in the DO-IT (Disabilities, Opportunities, InternetworkingTechnology)
program will prove applicable for IE2 general science literacy forvisually-impaired
students. </li>
</ul>

<p>(DO-IT is a program, based at the University of Washington, forphysically-handicapped
students interested in pursing careers in science.Through special summer
programs and Internet mentoring, it provides studentswith the skills and
encouragement they need to succeed in college sciencecourses. Mentors also
provide role models for students in the program. Theprogram has been highly
successful.) </p>

<p>Finally, a third hypothesis was necessary to clarify what factors contributeto
success. </p>

<ul>
<li>Increases in science literacy will not be due, to any substantial extent,
to&quot;Hawthorne Effects.&quot; </li>
</ul>

<p>To understand this hypotheses, we must first explain the Hawthorne Effect.
Ina post-World War II management study, the researchers exposed production
lineworkers to a variety of modifications in the factory environment. Modificationswere
changes such as more relaxing colors on the walls and playing music. Thestudy
found that productivity improved whatever modification was made. The studyconcluded
that the precise modification was less important than the fact someonewas
paying special attention to the workers. The workers responded to theattention
by acting in a manner they presumed was desirable, that is, increasingproductivity.
</p>

<p>Any new tool introduced into a classroom should cause a Hawthorne Effectwhich
will improve attainment of educational objectives. This result is not anegative
phenomenon to be avoided in our estimation. It should be encouraged,but
we also need to be aware it is taking place and attempt to measure it as
afactor in the success of our approach. </p>

<h3>Units of Analysis and Data Collected</h3>

<p>There are two primary units of analysis for the Phase One study. </p>

<p>The first unit is the team. A team is a set of students assigned to
worktogether through the course of the project. Because much scientific
research isconducted by teams, we wanted to give our students the experience
of working inteams. </p>

<p>The unit allows us to address issues such as collective work product
qualityand frequency and content of communication between the team and
mentors. Itstill permits us to measure core issues for project feasibility,
such asimprovement in general science literacy and specific concepts and
skills relatedto the subject matter. An added benefit is that this unit
simplifies someproject housekeeping activities, such as pre- and post-evaluation.
Because ourstudents are visually-impaired, relatively simple tasks, such
as completingmultiple choice and open-ended questionnaires aremore time
consuming as theinstrument must go through a voice synthesizer, be translated
into Braille, orbe read to the student. What we trade-off is the ability
to precisely trackimprovements in the general science literacy of specific
students, although wecan approximate this measurement by assessing the
average literacy within theteam and the variance of that literacy. </p>

<p>We are measuring specific attributes of this unit during the study.
Theseattributes are: </p>

<ul>
<li>average science literacy and variance among team members before and
afterthe course.</li>

<li>successful completion of tasks in lessons during the course.</li>

<li>frequency and content of communication between team and each kind of
mentorduring the course.</li>

<li>absolute number of web sites visited during the course.</li>

<li>supplemental resources (library, expert interviews, etc.) referenced
inresearch papers.</li>

<li>use of templates during the course.</li>

<li>overall quality of publication. </li>

<li>overall quality of final exam (scores).</li>

<li>teacher assessment of cooperation within the team.</li>

<li>team assessment of the utility of software tools.</li>

<li>team assessment of the difficulty of using software tools.</li>

<li>team assessment of the utility of kinds of mentors.</li>

<li>team assessment of the utility of web sites.</li>

<li>team assessment of the difficulty of accessing and reading web pages.
</li>
</ul>

<p>The second unit is the lesson. For us, the curricula is comprised of
aseries of lessons. By lesson we refer to a specific set of instruction
andstudent activities which constitute a discrete curricula unit the students
mustaccomplish. We have 8 types of lessons in this project: </p>

<ul>
<li>traditional seminar instruction.</li>

<li>seminar instruction with hands-on project.</li>

<li>independent student/team literature review.</li>

<li>independent student/team qualitative data collection and analysis.</li>

<li>independent student/team quantitative data collection and analysis.</li>

<li>independent student/team paper preparation and submission.</li>

<li>independent student/team oral presentation and submission.</li>

<li>independent student/team evaluation. </li>
</ul>

<p>With this unit of analysis we measure: </p>

<ul>
<li>utility of the various software tools for lesson.</li>

<li>the utility of mentors for lesson. </li>

<li>the receptivity and enthusiasm of the students.</li>

<li>frequency and content of contact with mentors.</li>

<li>teacher assessment of utility of specific templates for lesson.</li>

<li>teacher assessment of utility and difficulty of use of web sites providedfor
lesson.</li>

<li>teacher assessment of instructions provided for lesson.</li>

<li>teacher assessment of utility for teaching domain specific science
literacy.</li>

<li>teacher assessment of utility for teaching general science literacy.
</li>

<li>mentor assessment of utility for teaching general science literacy.
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Logic linking the data to the propositions</h3>

<p>To falsify the first hypothesis, we need to demonstrate that the averagescience
literacy of teams does not improve over the course of the project orshow
that improvement is simply the function of outlying individual capabilitieswhich
throw off the average. To make this assessment, we constructed pre- andpost-tests.
The pre-test has been administered and analyzed. We willadministered the
post-test near the end of Phase One. Both the pre-test and thepost-test
are taken by students in the project and a control group. (Ourproject has
brought the first Internet connectivity to the school so anyInternet knowledge
is either brought to the school by the students or a spin-offof the impact
of this project. The pre-test specifically measures priorInternet experience
and skills.)</p>

<p>The hypothesis presumes that the students are given a meaningful experiencein
doing science. We examined examples of science literacy projects reported
onthe ERIC data base. We also relied on our own experience and the P.I.'sunderstanding
of science to develop a meaning experience. (Foresight specializesin research
and development related to the process of developing and deployingtechnology.
The P.I. is a social scientist and philosopher of science.) </p>

<p>We believe, and the A.A.A.S. <i>Benchmarks</i> agree, that communication
is acore part of doing science. We (half-jokingly) decided to apply a method
fromArtificial Intelligence expert system development to create the tasking
forstudents in this project: backward chaining. Backward chaining involvesidentifying
a goal state and then preceding backwards to identify all theconditions
and parameters needed to create the goal state. For science, thearchetypal
goal state is a paper published in a refereed journal. Thus wedecided that
if our students were going to do science, they should publish.Since we
are interested in IE2 approaches, the journal is an on-line, webpublication.
</p>

<p>We next identified the typical sections of a paper published in <i>Science</i>or
other refereed journals. To ensure accuracy, this structure, and theinstructions
for creating a paper, were reviewed by mentors who had been editorsof refereed
journals. The sections were then expanded into templates for theactivities
required to prepare for writing a paper (literature reviews, datacollection,
data analysis and development of findings and conclusions). Thus,templates
emphasize both tasks intrinsic to the activity (i.e., jotting downnotes
on what was read in the case of a literature review) and for preparing
apublishable paper (i.e. collecting a full bibliographic citation in the
case ofa literature review). </p>

<p>The new set of templates was provided to other mentors who were active
inacademic or industrial research for comment. (We also provided the templates
toa mentor who is the head of an Adaptive Services program at a university
fortheir &quot;user-friendliness.) In this manner we ensured that we had
accuratelystructured the students' experience as scientists. </p>

<p>The use of mentors as role models provided a means for including varioustypes
of communication experiences. As a consequence, we classified our mentorsinto
three groups: individual student mentors, experts, and journal editors.
Thefirst group represents colleagues and professors; the second leading
experts ina field who often are contacted by e-mail for advice or comment
during aresearch effort. The final group represent the people who control
the highestprestige information dissemination mechanisms in science. By
bringing ourstudents into contact with all three types of mentors we replicate
core parts ofthe the actual communication structure for active researchers.
At the same time,we needed to include a group of people who represented
&quot;tool builders&quot;and technicians. This group was created by adding
two special mentors, JoeBreskin, the hardware and software engineer for
this project and Joel Zimba, acomputer science student at the University
of West Virginia who is a graduate ofthe WVSDB. These individuals are available
to support the students in addressingInternet and computer issues. Mr.
Breskin also will provide support formathematics questions. </p>

<p>All that remained was to identify a substantive research question and
createa research design mangeable within the time constraints of a Phase
One project.Following advice in the literature, we elected to focus on
a research questionwhich was locally relevant and lent itself to the literacy
goals of the study. This question is: Why does it flood? The research design
involves identifyingvarious factors, creating a mathematical model to explore
the interaction ofthese factors and assess if they constitute an acceptable
explanation. If not,the reserach design calls for modifying the model to
make it more accurate. Asecondary goal of the design is to keep the model
tractible, that is, easy touse. Three data sets are used in the project,
two from Romney, W. VA. floodsand one from Oregon. To ensure this research
design was legitimate science, yetappropriate for the target population,
the design and tasking were reviewed bytwo university consultants with
expertise in precollegiate science education andeducation for physically
disabled students.</p>

<p>The primary method taken from DO-IT is the use of Internet to facilitatescience
education. In DO-IT, students and mentors communicate by e-mail.Mentors
act as role models to encourage and coach physically handicappedstudents.
A second method adopted from DO-IT is the use of list-servers ande-mail
permitting handicapped students to share experiences and insights morerapidly.
A third method is using the World Wide Web to provide students accessto
resources that would be difficult to otherwise obtain. </p>

<p>All three methods were desirable for two reasons. First, Internet makes
itfeasible to access a wider range of individuals for mentors than would
bepossible if mentors and students had to meet face-to-face. The use ofelectronic
mail is particularly important for students whose handicaps inhibittravel.
Internet also provides an ability to &quot;browse&quot; throughlibraries
of data  an experience again difficult for many handicappedpeople such
as the visually-impaired students in this project. Second, e-mailand the
use of the Web and other data access tools have become activities commonin
normal science. Indeed, even the scholarly literature is increasingly beingpublished
on the Web. (We have therefore added web publication of an article tothis
project.)</p>

<p>To falsify our hypothesis and conclude these methods are not useful,
wewould have to find that students either make no use of e-mail and the
web orthat the teacher or students report it is not helpful or too difficult
to beworth the effort. </p>

<p>We predict we shall see evidence of a Hawthorne effect. We propose to
usethree indicators to falsify the hypothesis this effect is not a substantialsource
of the improvement we anticipate in science literacy. First, if theeffect
is very substantial, it is reasonable students will get excited and talkabout
the project with their friends  creating spin-out learning instudents
not part of the experimental group. This skill enhancement should showup
on the post-test for the control group as a very dramatic rise in Internetabilities.
Second, we will compare measurements of improvement on projectskills and
concepts with improvement on general science literacy skills andattitudes.
Because the students should be more cognizant of the overt objectivestied
to substantive concepts and skills for addressing the project focus of
&quot;Whydoes it Flood?&quot; than the latent objectives of scientific
literacy attitudesand skills, any Hawthorne effect should be greatest here.
(The assumption isthat students will respond by trying to meet our expectations
and theseexpectations will be easier to see.) Thus, we should see a significantdivergence
between improvement on overt objectives over latent objectives. Third,
we shall measure responses by teachers and students looking forinconsistencies.
If both groups strongly assert the tools and lessons hadlittle utility
yet we see significant increases in science literacycapabilities, we shall
find the hypothesis falsified. </p>

<h3>Criterion for Interpreting the Findings.</h3>

<p>The key issue is how great an improvement constitutes a significantimprovement
in science literacy. While it is tempting to turn to statisticalmeasures
of significance, we are reluctant to do so due to the small number ofteams
involved and limited duration of the Phase One test. Duration is aparticular
problem as the training literature is ripe with discussions ofdifficulties
in measuring how lasting training is without time series data.Within the
constraints of Phase One we have no way of knowing how lasting anyimprovement
might be. Statistical significance may exist without any realimprovement
in science literacy, </p>

<p>To make a judgment call as to whether Phase One worked, we have elected
to usea non-statistical, contextual definition of significant improvement
in scienceliteracy. We shall consider a science literacy improvement significant
if: </p>

<p>the study teams improve more than the control group;</p>

<p>the extent of improvement is considered better than would have been
expectedby the teachers had they used their traditional methods during
a similar timeperiod; and,</p>

<p>based on prior experiences, the teachers assume a lasting improvement
hasoccurred. </p>

<h2>Activities to Date</h2>

<p>Due to change of P.I.'s, and the shutdown of the federal government,
we arecurrently mid-way in our Phase One project. However, many of our
Phase Oneobjectives have already been met and we are confident that the
remainder will beas well.</p>

<p>Our P.I.'s changed when the anticipated P.I. obtained employment at
auniversity under another grant. At that time, Philip Speser, J.D., Ph.D.,President
of Foresight Science and Technology stepped in as P.I. and a newresearch
team was built. As an active research scientists, Dr. Speser, focusedthe
substantive content of the project on general science literacy, an area
inwhich he had extensive precollegiate educational experience as a volunteer.
Dr.Speser's own research is on the process of developing and deploying
technologyand applied artificial intelligence. Also added was C. Joesph
Breskin, ChiefTechnical Officer at Foresight. Mr. Breskin is a product
designer and computerengineer. Before joining Foresight, Mr. Breskin had
successfully built acompany selling scientific visualization software and
had been a consultant ingeographic information systems for city and county
governments in the State ofWashington. To provide additional expertise,
Dr. Sheryl Burgstahler, Directorof DO-IT at the University of Washington
College of Engineering, was added as aconsultant. Dr. Burgstahler's program
focuses on disabled pre-collegiatestudents interested in careers in science.
Much of the Phase One proposal wasmodelled on methods pioneered by DO-IT.
Also added to the team was Dr. MicheleLaBrasseur, Assistant Professor in
the Department of Technical Communication ofthe University of Washington
College of Engineering. Dr. LaBreassuer is aformer precollegiate educator
who has specialized in Internet- andcomputer-enhanced education. </p>

<p>We defined science literacy in terms of the paradigm of normal 20th
Centuryscientific research: academic quality in basic and applied research.(f8.)
Wewere supported in this decision by the fact that it is that paradigm
whichunderlies the hands-on approach found in modern science education.
(f9.)</p>

<p>Thus, we drew the specific concepts, skills, and attitudes to be taught
fromthose provided for the appropriate grade levels in <i>Benchmarks for
ScienceLiteracy</i> by the American Association for the Advancement of
Science.(f10.)In selecting specific concepts, skills, and attitudes as
goals for this studyfrom among the multitude found in that document, we
were reminded about Hegel'sfamous adage that distinctions which are not
driven by logical imperative arelike the night in which all cows are black.
We chose goals which we felt wereparticularly relevant based on our understanding
of trends in science. Tojustify the specific goals selected would require
several pages of discourse onthe philosophy and sociology of science 
a subject near and dear to ourP.I.'s heart but outside the scope of this
proposal. </p>

<p>The specific goals selected were: </p>

<ul>
<li>Core Substantive Concept: Ecosystem.</li>

<li>Theoretical Concepts: System and Model.</li>

<li>Methodological Concept: Inquiry.</li>

<li>Attitude (Habits of Mind): Disciplined Curiosity.</li>

<li>Skills: Computation and Estimation, Communication, Critical Response.
</li>
</ul>

<p>The definition of these goals was prepared as an independent document,
&quot;Developingthe Projects: Science Literacy Parameters,&quot; using
guidance from <i>Benchmarksfor Science Literacy </i>and &quot;Essential
Academic Learning Requirements,&quot;by the Washington State Commission
on Student Learning, Subject AdvisoryCommittee in Science. (f11.)</p>

<p>Based on these goals, a pre-test evaluation instrument and sections
of thepost-test instrument was created. These pre- and post-test items
were pre-testedon the Project team, our consultants, and the P.I.'s son
(a 10th grade student).</p>

<p>To provide a hands-on experience within which to learn these concepts,skills,
and attitudes, we parsed scientific activity into research question andhypothesis
formulation, literature reviews, data collection, data analysis andformation
of conclusions, oral presentation, and written presentation. Becauseof
the time constraints of Phase One, we selected the research question andprovided
a set of initial hypotheses, formally expressed as a mathematicalmodel,
for the students. For the remaining activities, we prepared templates forthe
conduct of those activities and submitted these templates to our consultantsand
mentors for critical review. Comments were incorporated in templaterevisions.
</p>

<p>As the templates were prepared, our environmental education specialistprepared
the rest of the curricula. The complete curricula material consists of:
</p>

<ul>
<li>a teachers manual.</li>

<li>an Internet manual.</li>

<li>templates and instructions for templates.</li>

<li>a glossary of relevant terms.</li>

<li>spreadsheets with beginning formulas for models and explanations of
thoseformulas.</li>

<li>an alphabetical directory of mentors. </li>

<li>a set of relevant web sites, downloaded and stripped of graphics to
makethem more friendly for speech-synthesizers; and.</li>

<li>a set of fact sheets and instructions for mentors.</li>

<li>pre- and post-tests (evaluations). </li>
</ul>

<p>Also prepared were list-severs for mentors, an e-mail address where
studentscan write project staff for help, and e-mail accounts for the students
andteacher.</p>

<p>The research question driving the curricula, together with the scienceliteracy
goals, was: Why does it flood? This question was selected becauseRomney,
W.VA., where the WVSDB is located has had a series of major floods inthe
past ten years. The curricula has 16 main lessons: </p>

<ul>
<li>Introduction to science as a part of the pre-test.</li>

<li>Introduction to the problem of flooding. </li>

<li>Initial communication with individual mentors.</li>

<li>Introduction to the use of models in science, with a hands-on activityinvolving
the use of basketballs to model soil compaction and development of amathematical
formulation of the model.</li>

<li>Communication with individual mentors on models and discussion of the
use ofmodels in other disciplines.</li>

<li>Introduction to the concept of run-off, with a hands-on activity involvingthe
use of a sponge to model infiltration and development of a mathematicalformulation
of the model.</li>

<li>Preparation of a brief research paper on the sponge model and experimentswith
it, submission of the model to an individual mentor for critique, andrevisions
as needed.</li>

<li>Introduction to the role of weather in flooding and communication withindividual
mentors on this subject with provision of a relevant web site tosearch
by the mentor.</li>

<li>Development of a model to answer the research question with respect
to the1986 Romney flood.</li>

<li>Team research on factors contributing to the 1995 Romney flood, includingcommunication
with mentors who are substantive experts in this research area.</li>

<li>Oral reports by teams on findings and conclusions.</li>

<li>Modification of the model.</li>

<li>Preparation by teams of a major paper for submission to the on-line
journal,including obtaining publication guidelines.</li>

<li>Submission of the paper to substantive expert mentors and individual
mentorsfor review and incorporation of suggestions.</li>

<li>Submission of the paper to the editors (mentors) of the journal andincorporation
of suggestions, followed by final submission.</li>

<li>Post-test, including preparation of a short paper on a flood in Oregon
andsubmission to the expert and journal mentors and receipt of critique.
</li>
</ul>

<p>A section of the post-test was developed, involving application of theknowledge
and skills hopefully obtained to a different geographical region --the
flood in Oregon. The test involves preparing a written research note forsubmission
to the journal as a comment on the major paper.</p>

<p>The curricula was submitted to the rest of the team and our consultants
forcomment and was also extensively discussed with the science and computerteachers
at the school. As materials to be presented to students were prepared,they
were presented to either the P.I.'s son or a student intern (a 9th gradestudent)
working at Foresight. Their comments were also considered when makingrevisions.
The Internet manual for teachers and students received an additionalreview,
this time by a freshman college computer science student who was agraduate
of the WVSDB and is a consultant on this project tasked with supportingstudents
having Internet access or navigation problems. As final check on thematerial,
we posted issues raised during development or review to threelistservers:
EASI, blind-l, guispak. </p>

<p>While the educational material was being prepared. Hardware and software
waspurchased. A Micron Windows 95 machine with a sound card and speech
synthesizerwas tested at Foresight and shipped to the school where it was
installed. </p>

<p>Our education specialist was on site March 18th through 20th. During
thistime she trained the teachers in the curricula and tools, ensured all
hardwareand software was working, and administered the pre-test to student
teams. </p>

<p>The three teams of students are currently participating in lessons.
Data onmentor contacts is montored by reading all project e-mail. (Students
and mentorshave been informed we will be monitoring e-mail as part of our
data collection.)We are also collecting perceptual data from teachers,
teams, and mentors. </p>

<h2>Significant Findings to Date</h2>

<p>We have just begun the on-site education, so findings concerning ourcurricula
are not yet available. </p>

<p>Teaching Mathematics </p>

<p>Through discussions with teachers at the school, people on the guispaklistserver,
and detailed phone and e-mail communication with blind scientists atuniversities
and Lawrence Scadden, Senior Program Director, Persons withDisabilities
Program, National Science Foundation, we explored a major issue forteaching
general science literacy to visually impaired students: mathematics. Many
mathematical concepts involve spatial relationships. Others use conceptsof
dimensionality. Sighted people have a broad range of experience to draw
uponin learning concepts like area or three-dimensionality.(f12.) This
range ofexperience is not available for visually-impaired students born
blind, with theresult that many are ambivalent about math. It is limited
for those who lostvision at an early age. </p>

<p>Our solution for Phase One was to facilitate the use of mathematics
byproviding a simple formula (e.g., x=y) and, through an iterative process,
addterms to that formula to make it more accurately model a physical phenomenon.Corresponding
to the steps in the mathematical iterative process, are a set ofphysical
models which students can touch and/or hear. Our hope is to usesensory
inputs to relicate the role of vision in stimulating mathematicalimagination
and understanding. At the same time, we convey the understandingthat, via
abstraction, mathematics can provide a representation of the physicalworld.
</p>

<p>A related problem is the use of spreadsheets for conducting mathematicalcalculations.
Navigation of the spreadsheet if difficult if one must relyentirely on
memory for the location of cells or ranges. We had suspected thatuse of
spreadsheets, especially the generation and understanding of graphics,would
present a significant challenge for visually-impaired students. Ourpre-test
strongly confirmed this suspicion. In Phase One, we address this problemby
including partially sighted students on each team. With the aid of screenmagnifiers,
these students can read and modify the simple spreadsheets we haveconstructed.
</p>

<p>We recognize this solution to be unsatisfactory. Accordingly, our Phase
IIproposal work plan includes developing a more user-friendly interface
forspreadsheets and for reading graphs. </p>

<p>Internet tools </p>

<p>We feel it is important to design our project to integrate students
into themainstream computing world. This world is a PC based world, and
predominately aWindows world. Yet, most software for visually-impaired
people runs under UNIXor DOS. Clearly there is a gap which needs bridging.
</p>

<p>The problem is exacerbated when it comes to accessing the World Wide
Web.The primary problem is finding ways to deal with graphic interfaces
for the WideWorld Web and Windows 95. Lynx is the current browser used
by visually impairedpeople, but it does not handle graphics well at all.
Lynx also is no longersupported by most Internet providers. </p>

<p>Many new browsers are under development for Windows 95. EXAMPLES. TheAdaptive
Technology Resource at the University of Toronto is developing anenhaced
Panorama viewer with support from SoftQuad. </p>

<p>We had hoped to be able to run a relatively robust beta test version
of oneof these browsers (though not surprising for those familiar with
software), therelease dates for beta test versions keep being pushed back.
</p>

<p>Unable to wait for a robust browser, our solution was to downloadinteresting
sites, strip out graphics and add features to make them text browserfriendly.
We run these converted (handicapped-user friendly) web sites asmirror sites
on our project computers. A &quot;card catalog&quot; providesteachers and
students an overview of the avialable sites. This enables blindstudents
to use a DOS Lynx browser while students able to use screen magnifierscan
use Netscape or other browsers to call up and highlight material for readingby
a speech synthesizer. In the future, as speech-friendly Windows 95-basedbrowsers
become available, these will be substituted for the DOS Lynx browser.</p>

<p>Necessity being the Mother of Invention, we became very excited about
thisapproach as it solves a number of related problems: </p>

<p>By downloading sites, we can avoid the delays inevitable in Web use,especially
during peak business hours. This time, of course, corresponds toschool
hours. Instead of 28.8 kbaud we are accessing the data at hard driveaccess
speeds. </p>

<p>We are able to place mirror sites on several machines or on a network
fileserver. As our test site is in a small rural community and has only
one dial-upaccess line, this enables many students to gain access to the
material at thesame time. </p>

<p>We can strip out graphics and convert HTML code to make it understandable
tousers relying on spoken text or Braille pads.</p>

<p>The approach lets us structure a coherent set of web sites tightlyintegrated
with curricula requirements without worrying about student access tomaterial
to which parents might object.</p>

<p>We can teach all relevant Internet navigation skills.</p>

<p>We can provide a &quot;card catalog&quot;/search engine modeled on thelibrary
card catalog which -- </p>

<ul>
<li>A. provides information on sites. </li>

<li>B. provides hypertext links to those sites (either on the mirror machine
orthe actual web).</li>

<li>C. teaches students library skills for paper-based documents; and.</li>

<li>D. provides an opportunity to discuss the differences betweenInternet-based
and traditional library inventoried materials and search methods.</li>
</ul>

<p>A crucial component in introducing Internet tools is to provide sufficienttraining
and support for the teachers. Based on a literature review, and ourown
experience volunteering in local schools, we had anticipated somehesitation
in using the new tools and provided the teachers with an Internettraining
manual, on-site training, and e-mail support. The manual provides bothan
overview on the Internet and a users manual for the e-mail (Eudora) and
webbrowser (Netscape) we installed on the computer. Telephone support is
alsoavaialble for teachers. For students, we arranged for a graduate of
the school(currently studying computer science at a West Virginia university)
to returnand spend a day providing hands-on Internet training.</p>

<p>Despite this preparation, we still found substantial concern over masteringInternet
skills. During the initial on-site instruction by our staff, thecomputer
lab teacher at the WVSDB e-mailed us, &quot;Hello everybody! We are sohappy
to be doing this project. I will be asking all sorts of weird questionsto
make this visually impaired friendly! Thanks.&quot;(f13.) After two daysof
on-site training, she demonstrated pre-course jitters when she e-mailed:
&quot;Phil,I am desperately trying to get the class started by next Monday,
4/1/96. Thisis not an April Fool's joke. But it could be an omen for me!&quot;(f14.)
We actually found this e-mail encouraging as she choose to use Internet
ratherthan the phone to communicate with us. </p>

<h2>Related Research or R&amp;D</h2>

<p>Internet Enhanced Education </p>

<p>Internet-enhanced-education is increasingly common. From Global Schoolhouseto
Kidlink, web-based educational resources and inter-networking projects
seemto sprout up faster than they can be indexed.(f15.) IE2 has been found
to bean exceptionally useful tool for relatively isolated schools and students.
Areview of five projects with the general aim of using telecommunications
and theInternet to foster the renewal of math and science education in
rural schoolsfound three themes dominated evaluations: </p>

<ul>
<li>exhilarating experiences of having access to unlimited information
andresources,</li>

<li>overcoming of isolation and feeling part of a global community; and,
</li>

<li>feelings of excitement and renewal.(f16.) </li>
</ul>

<p>Evaluations from the DO-IT program and initial results from ourpre-evaluation
suggest similar results are found when IE2 is introduced tophysically disabled
students.(f17.) However, unlike the case with sightedstudents and teachers,
visually-impaired people (and those with otherdisabilities) can end up
very frustrated by poorly designed Internet sites, suchas web pages. Fortunately,
solutions do exist for making sites universallyaccessible.(f18.)</p>

<p>From our perspective, there are both benefits and problems with theproliferation
of IE2. Both teachers and students can benefit from improvedaccess to resources
and colleagues. The problem is the costs of weeding throughthe proliferation
to find the most useful resources and integrating them intothe educational
process. </p>

<p>The nature of Interent use during class changes classroom dynamics in
a waydifferent from technology like TV-based videotape and videodisk. Thetraditional
classroom is structured around one room, one teacher, and one lessonfor
all students in that room. Technology which supports this model isrelatively
straightforward to integrate. Movies or videotapes simply substitutefor
lecturers. Internet is different. It facilitates individual and teamoriented
education by its interactive character. In supports a model ofeducation
structured around one room, any number of (including none) teachers,and
any number of lessons..)(f19.) </p>

<p>The problem is concisely stated in a posting to the EDTECH listserver
byBrian Keith MacIsaac, a teacher in Canada. He writes: </p>

<p>&quot;In my classroom and the school most teachers believe that computersshould
only be used for research or to provide the students with a secondarysource
of learning. In my opinion, computers have a place in the High Schoolclassrooms,
but if the students do not have access to the computers most of thetime,
then the lessons based on computers seem to be a distraction.&quot;(f20.)</p>

<p>Introducing Internet is more complicated than just introducing computers.
Internet opens the door to a world of resources. Yet the door, in some
ways, islike the lid of Pandora's box. Two factors must be addressed. First,
The Webprovides access to profanity, sexually explicit materials, hate
literature, andthe like. Dade County School District only allows access
through a networkrequiring a teacher log-on. In addition, teachers are
expected to monitorstudent activities -- ensuring random browsing does
not occur.(f21.) (Clearly these are costly solutions which discourage both
teachers and studentsfrom learning the Web and using it as an educational
tool.) Second, usingInternet demands a whole new set of skills on the part
of both teachers andstudents. A national survey of 550 kindergarten through
12th grade teachersfound most respondents are self-taught in computers,
and their responseshighlighted the lack of training in telecommunications
for teachers.(f22.)Our Phase One study found that despite strong computer
skills, teachers washesitent to embrace IE2 because it demanded learning
new software and, in thiscase, Windows 95. </p>

<p>Previous experiments bringing Internet into the classroom have found
thatthe latter question can be addressed by providing an appropriate educationalsupport
infrastructure. For example, Los Alamos National Laboratory developed amodel
for school networking using Los Alamos Middle School as a testbed. Themodel
support infrastructure includes: local school system administrators/leadteachers,
introductory and intermediate hands-on teacher training, teacherincentives
for involvement and use, opportunities for student training and use,and
ongoing LANL consulting. Formal evaluations found this model was able tointegrate
Internet into the education process as a tool that crossesdisciplines,
allowing teachers and students to obtain more timely informationand to
communicate with others more effectively and efficiently.(f23.)</p>

<p>Our solution builds on the LANL model of providing a comprehensiveinfrastructure.
Also drawing inspiration from the traditional science kit, wecreate educational
kits providing self-contained curricula units. Once theteacher elects to
use a kit, (s)he has all the resources required to implement acurricula
unit. (S)he can use the kit as provided or modify it as desired. (S)hecan
be personally involved in the unit, or, by providing the teachers manual
toa parent, classroom aide, community volunteer, or student assistant,
allow agroup of students to use the kit as an independent study project.
</p>

<p>A major component of the kits is training in computers, the Internet
and therelevant software for both students and teachers. </p>

<p>Making the Link Between Internet and Traditional Libraries </p>

<p>Science, and other intellectual activity, requires access to both Internetand
traditional library resources. It is important that IE2 projects enhance
thestudents ability to move back and forth between emerging and traditionalinformation
resources, especially as electronic catalogs become more prevalentfor the
latter. Traditional library collections, whether organized by theLibrary
of Congress system of classification or the Dewey Decimal system have afinite
process and structure of locating and retrieving information. TheInternet,
on the other hand, is &quot;a vast, unmapped area with unknown andever-changing
boundaries.&quot;(f24.) Librarian Kirk Doran asserts: </p>

<p>&quot;[T]here is no substitute for a clear understanding of traditionalinformation
organization. Learning to use classification schemes, subjectheadings and
indexes opens the door to all libraries. There is no theoreticalfoundation
for the Internet. In fact, data overload without context hamperslearning.&quot;(f25.)
</p>

<p>In order to create an understanding of how to move between finding resourceson
Internet and in traditional libraries for students, we need to be clear
aboutdevelopments in cataloging and searching occurring at traditional
libraries. </p>

<p>The Internet's predominant methodology of searching for information
useskeyword or open text searching. As librarians automate their classification
andretrieval systems through electronic catalogs, it becomes easier to
track andlocate materials. Electronic card catalogs have maintained the
integrity of theold card catalogs, still using standardized subject headings
and crossreferences. With new language and meaning constantly emerging,
the addition ofInternet-type open text and keyword searching has emerged
as a tool forincreasing accessibility to the Library's collection.</p>

<p>According to Dr. Neil Yerkey, Assistant Dean and professor of the School
ofInformation and Library Studies at the State University of New York at
Buffalo,while the open text/keyword searches offer more flexibility, the
lack of acontrolled vocabulary often yields less precise and less relevant
information.Library search methodology has expanded to include open text/keyword
searchingas it becomes more and more difficult for catalog librarians to
keep up with andmaintain subject-based retrieval systems. Today, automated
libraries use severaldifferent on-line technologies. There has been no
one standard electronicsystem and consequently libraries have found themselves
self-contained withlibrary users limited in their ability to understand
and use multiple libraries.However, this is changing. Technology is being
introduced to set a standardknown as <i>Z 39.50</i> which will make diverse,
electronic systems ofinformation storage and retrieval compatible.(f26.)</p>

<p>While there are clear differences between traditional libraries and
theInternet, info-technicians in both contexts are working to make these
vastinformation systems more compatible. Public libraries are offering
Internetaccess through computers set up for patron use. Kevin McCoy, Media
Librarian atSuffolk Community College and author of &quot;Searching the
Web,&quot; has notedthat some large universities are cataloging Internet
resources and adding themto their OPAC's (On-line Public Access Catalog).(f27.)</p>

<p>Major initiatives are taking place at university repositories of scientificand
technical literature. Four-year projects on digital libraries are takingplace
at Carnegie Mellon University; the University of California, Berkeley;the
University of Michigan; the University of Illinois; the University ofCalifornia,
Santa Barbara; and Stanford University. The projects' focus is todramatically
advance the means to collect, store, and organize information indigital
forms, and make it available for searching, retrieval, and processingvia
communication networks -- all in user-friendly ways. Each effort bringstogether
researchers and users from the local university with those from otherorganizations
including other academic institutions, libraries, museums,publishers, government
laboratories, state agencies, secondary schools, andcomputer and </p>

<p>communications companies. These projects to develop digital libraries
--storehouses of information available through the Internet -- have been
fundedthrough a joint initiative of the National Science Foundation (NSF),
theDepartment of Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA), and
theNational Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).(f28.)</p>

<p>To bring Internet information cataloging and traditional library resourcecataloging
into a synergy, we propose to develop an Internet &quot;card catalog&quot;(search
engine and data base) for environmental science. The search logic anddata
base fields will be designed to be compatible with the more prominentsystems
for on-line organizing of traditional library collections such as NOTISor
DYNIX. We will also integrate into the design the upcoming technologystandard
Z-39.50 to ensure uniformity and consequently enhance accessibility. Among
the fields we will include will be title, author, publishing date, size
ofsite, ownership, length of site existence, frequency of update, a brief
abstractand of course, references and cross references (&quot;see&quot;,
&quot;see also&quot;and &quot;previously listed under&quot;). A general
thesaurus of relevant,standard terminology will also be included in the
design of our subject-based,library-compatible search engine.</p>

<p>The volume and fluidity of information moving on the Internet make it
bothexpensive and logistically difficult to maintain an inclusive, updated
anduseable subject-based retrieval system. Our solution is to focus on
specificareas of concentration. Librarians such as Jody LeBrenz, Manager
of Technologyat the Lifelong Learning Center of the Buffalo and Erie County
Public Librarybelieve that such an approach is manageable so long as the
specific areas ofinterest has clear boundaries.(f29.) Since we only need
to create a catalogfor a specific project area, this boundary condition
is met. </p>

<p>Science Education </p>

<p>The hands-on approach to science education is based on the apprenticeshipmodel
found in graduate education and implicit in the paradigm of 20th Centurynormal
science. This approach views education as a training process throughwhich
students obtain concepts, skills, and attitudes useful and appropriate
forthe performance of a specific set of tasks: scientific inquiry.</p>

<p>&quot;No matter how the curriculum is organized, it should provide studentswith
opportunities to become aware of the great range of scientific disciplinesthat
exist. There is no sense, however, in having students memorize definitionsof
anthropology, astrophysics, biochemistry, paleobacteriology, and the rest
ofthe family. Individual students or small groups of students can study
differentdisciplines in some detail--most scientific societies are happy
to help out--andthen share their findings with one another. The focus of
such studies should besubstantive (what are typical studies like in the
discipline) and sociological(how is the field organized and who is in it),
and they should probably involve,over an extended time, interviews, field
trips, readings, data analysis, and, ifpossible, the conduct of small-scale
experiments or field studies. Suchactivities will contribute to science
literacy goals, and they should also helpstudents realize how many different
career possibilities exist in science.&quot;<i>(f30.) </i></p>

<p><i>We have used findings from recent reviews of research on training
by theNational Research Council to guide us in our kit design.(f31.) We
feltconfident using these findings in this context as they are compatible
with thefindings in Science for All Americans</i> and <i>Benchmarks for
ScienceLiteracy.</i></p>

<p>A review by the National Research Council's Committee on Techniques
for theEnhancement of Human Performance found training experiences must
be carefullystructured to highlight the structure of the desired activity
(in this case,scientific inquiry) if we expect students to be able to conduct
that activity(i.e., utilize a scientific approach) after the experience.
The educationalexperience must make it clear that the scientific method
can be applied to awide range of substantive questions byond the question
which is the focus of thetraining project. </p>

<p>&quot;[W]hether or not transfer occurs from training to post training
is afunction of percieved similiarity between the two contexts. Perceivedsimiliarity
of two tasks is a function of any salient shared component and of anumber
of other factors, such as expertise and context. To a great exent, anindividual's
expertise on the subject determines whether the similiaritiesobserved are
surface features or structural features. Whether actual transfer ispositive
or negative depends on the actual amount of structural similiarity....Thus,
the the <i>amount</i> of transfer obtained between situations is afunction
of the perceived similarity; the <i>direction</i> of transfer is afunction
of the objective structural similarity. The greater the perceivedsimilarity
of the situations, the greater the amount of transfer. No transfertakes
place when two situations are perceived as unrelated, regardless of thedegree
of response similarity. If a learner does not perceive the similaritybetween
training and post training contexts, the level of performance achievedin
training clearly will not predict post training performance.(f32.) </p>

<p>In this project, we have addressed this concern in two ways. First,
we havestudents interacting by e-mail with mentors from a wide range of
scientificfields. As part of the project, the students ask the mentors
how scientificmethods similar to the ones they are using are applied in
the mentor'sdiscipline. Second, throughout the project, we explain to the
students thatthey are themselves participants in a research project: our
Phase One SBIR. During the kick-off meeting, at which the pre-evaluation
is conducted, ourresearcher discusses the hypotheses and methods of this
project with thestudents, providing an additional model of scientific activity.
</p>

<p>The Committee also found that the training setting (that is, the educationalexperience)
must approximate the conditions in the activity in the real world.It notes
that the most serious problem with most instruction of skills is that:&quot;The
appropriate conditions under which a skill needs to be accessed andexecuted
are not attached to the actions during training.&quot;(f33.) Wehave taken
great pains to ensure this is not the case here. We have evenincluded the
publication of an article in a referred journal as a task. We havedone
so because for us, a core component of science is communication. </p>

<p>A third finding is that beginners learn differently than experts in
a field.We use three methods to address this phenonemon. </p>

<p>One method is extensive use of examples. The Council's Committee onTechniques
for the Enhancement of Human Performance finds students, especiallybeginners,
rely heavily on examples for learning how to solve problems and useprocedures.
</p>

<p>&quot;One of the reasons that examples are so popular and useful, eventhough
they are inadequate in explaining the rationale behind each action, isthat
the examples contain many of the procedural actions that are not explicatedin
texts.&quot;(f34.)</p>

<p>Our curricula incorporates incremental learning, in which students are
firstexplosed to simple tasks and concepts which then can readily master.
These tasksand concepts provide examples which provide groundwork for the
next iteration.For example, we demonstrate the interaction between run-off
and inflitration bymodeling the behavior of a sponge. In this example,
students learn how toexplore a physcial phenomenon and create a mathematical
model of thatphenomenon. The example then provides the groundwork for exploringinfilitration
and run-off in various soil conditions. </p>

<p>Another method is contextual interference. This method involves changing
thetraining context, including changes in tasks, practice conditions, andprocessing
used by trainees. As a committee of the National Research Council'sfound:
&quot;Contending with such changes demands cognitive processing that can,in
turn, enhance the level of original learning.&quot;(f35.) This projectcontains
several examples of contextual interference. Students conduct similartasks
individually and in groups and in the classroom and as &quot;homework&quot;on
computers. They are required to formulate models of physical phenomena
interms of physcial representations (i.e. basketballs in a box representing
soilparticles) and in terms of mathematical representations (i.e. volume
occupied byspheres in a cube). They must express their understandings of
hypotheses, dataobtained, findings, and conclusions through oral reports
and written reports.They are required to write two papers and participate
in writing a third grouppaper. </p>

<p>The final method is cognitive apprenticeship. </p>

<p>&quot;Cognitive apprenticeship consists of six key components: modelling,coaching,
scaffolding (and fading), articulation, reflection, and exploration....
The first three are provided mostly by the teacher (expert) and the lastthree
are exercised by the learner (novice).(f36.)</p>

<p>Modeling requires the expert to explain as much of the process as underlieshis
or actions as possible. The process of explanation has two dimensions.
Thefirst is sometimes called the &quot;solution trace,&quot; that is, the
strategyor procedure being used. The second is the expert's knowledge of
thesubstantive domain itself. This knowedge provides insights into why
an expertselects one method or activity over another. </p>

<p>We have, as indicated, constructed to sets of models of scientific inquiryfor
our students. The first model is explicity taught by the classroom teacheras
part of the curricula on, &quot;Why does it flood?&quot; The second model
istaught by our researcher as part of the introduction to this project.
</p>

<p>At the same time, there also is explicit modelling of the substantive
domainof the research question. The curricula begins by involves introducing
the topicand the factors which go into constructing a model to explain
flooding. Thestudents then create a model to explain one flood in their
town.</p>

<p>Coaching consists of observing students and offering hints, feedback,reminders,
new tasks, or redirecting students to important features. Coachingin this
project is provided by the teacher (or person fulfilling a similar role)supported
by the mentors. </p>

<p>Scaffolding is support a teacher or mentor can provide so the student
cansucceed in performing a task. In this project, scaffolding includes
templates;the mirror site; previously prepared spreadsheets for calculations,
and, thosementors in expert and journal editor roles. (Individual student
mentors are alsoscaffolding for the teacher.)</p>

<p>Articulation is overt constructive activity carried out by students.Classroom
participation, e-mail communication with mentors, data collection andanalysis,
and oral and written presentations are examples of articulation in theproject.
</p>

<p>Reflection is the process of evaluating your own problem-solving processesand
comparing them with those of other students and experts. Reflection isbuilt
in through classroom activity, group presentations, and formal reviews
ofstudent work by mentors. </p>

<p>Exploration is the activity of pursuing new goals, formulating and testingnew
hypotheses, conducting experiments and the like. Exploration enables thestudent
to move beyond the apprentice role into self-sufficiency. In thisproject,
exploration occurs when the student takes the work on Romney models andapplies
his or her model and understandings to explaining a flood in Oregon.

<h1><i>Here We Go.</i></h1>

<p><font COLOR="#FFFFFF">There are fourteen links on this page. The first
two are to pages giving U S Weather reports. The final twelve at the bottom
of the page leed to other parts of the Foresight web site. The letter begins
here.
<br></font>Dear Mentor,
<br>
<br></p>

<p>You have been selected as one of the <i>individual student mentors</i>.
Please e-mail me back to confirm receipt of this e-mail and your ability
to do what we are requesting. </p>

<p>Betsy Carlson, a member of our research team, is heading off to the
West Virginia School for the Deaf and the Blind tomorrow morning, to kick
off the field work portion of this project. This is where we turn to you
for help. </p>

<p>The final design has the students contacting you at least 6 times. Please
copy us with all correspondence sent to students. The e-mail for copies
is scied@seeport.com. </p>

<p>1. In the next week or two, depending on how quickly current student
work at the school is completed and our project begins, the students will
be on-line to say hello. Students will be assigned to mentors on a semi-random
basis. While some effort will be made to match kids with mentors doing
work they find really cool, we know little about the interests of the kids
at this time so who knows how matching will work. In any event, we do know
the kids are really excited about getting on-line for the first time and
talking with people like you. </p>

<p>We are trying to teach the kids that it is OK to ask for advice and
that scientists are people just like everyone else. Please respond promptly
(that day if possible) by saying hello back, telling them how nice it is
to hear from them, and encouraging them to keep you abreast of their work.
</p>

<p>2. Shortly after the first communication, the student will contact you
to describe a very simple soil porosity model they have learned. The model
is based on basketballs in a box and has a mathematical expression. </p>

<p>They will be asked to inquire if you are familiar with models in your
field. We are trying to teach them that models are a methodological tool
used throughout science. Please offer an easy to understand example from
your field. Remember that the students are blind, so reading takes a lot
more time for them as it must go through a speech synthesizer. Also be
aware we are not clear about their math abilities. </p>

<p>FYI, the following is our understanding of two key terms: hypothesis
and model. </p>

<p>HYPOTHESIS. </p>

<p>A hypothesis is a statement which can be proven false through experimentation
or other method of scientific observation of the world. It is important
to understand that science involves the study of &quot;tentative truths.&quot;
There is no absolute certainty within science. Take the following simple
statement. The sun will rise in the morning. How do we know this is true.
We can say it always has risen in the past. But we cannot be absolutely
positive it will rise tomorrow. It may not. The best we can say is that
there is a substantial likelihood the sun will rise based on past experience.
Notice we can test this hypothesis. If the sun does not rise tomorrow,
we will have falsified the hypothesis, that is, provided it is false. That
is how science works. We test hypotheses to try to prove them false. If
we cannot falsify the hypothesis, we hold it to be true, within certain
conditions and with a certain probability or likelihood. That is the best
we can do. </p>

<p>MODEL. </p>

<p>A model makes explicit those objects, properties, and relations that
are relevant to a research question or potential action. More precisely,
model is a collection of objects and their properties and a set of rules
that govern or describe how the objects and attributes interact. Let us
take apart this definition to be sure we understand it. An object can be
anything. A property is a feature of the object. A property can be a feature
of a physical object, like the texture of a rock or its shape. Hair is
a property of people. It may be a component of a machine, like the keyboard
of a computer or its central processor. It may be an element of a system,
like a moon of a planet or voting by a legislature. Rules are simply very
precise descriptions of relations between (1,) two objects, or (2,) an
object and its property which state how a relation </p>

<ul>
<p>(a.)Must always occur, or
<br>(b.)Will occur with some probability. </p>
</ul>

<p>This is an important concept, so I will repeat it for those using speech
synthesizers. Rules are simply very precise descriptions of relations between
(1,) two objects or (2,) an object and its property which state how a relation
</p>

<ul>
<p>(a.)Must always occur, or
<br>(b.)Will occur with some probability.</p>
</ul>

<p>It is a rule to say snow falls from clouds. (Notice we do not have to
give the reason for the rule. We do not have to say we need a certain amount
of moisture in the air and a certain pressure and temperature range to
have snow. Nor do we have to say that gravity causes the snow to fall.
It is sufficient to simply state what the behavior of the object or attribute
will be.) </p>

<p>We make models because we want to understand certain aspects or behavior
of an object of interest and it, the object, is just too complicated to
easily study. To make our job more simple, we make a model of the object
which focuses on properties and relations of interest to us. A toy car
is a model of a real car which focuses on movement. A relief map is a model
of the surface of the planet which focuses on elevation and shape. In each
case, we are looking at only part of the real object. We are focusing on
what is of interest to us in order to create a more simple description
of the real object and its behavior. Of course, making things more simply
can lead to a number of errors because the model never is the real thing.
By keeping our research objective in mind, we can ask: &quot;Does this
model really reflect what the object is or how it behaves in the real world,
with respect to our research question? If the answer is yes, we say our
model is accurate. In more precise language, we say that a model is accurate
to the extent that analyzing the model yields truths about the object of
interest. Of course, it is also important that the model be easy to work
with when making the analysis. A model which is too complicated to use
is of little help. We say a model is tractable to the extent such analysis
is actually possible. </p>

<p>A good model is both accurate and tractable. Models can be more or less
accurate and tractable. No model is ever completely accurate and perfectly
tractable. </p>

<p>3. We are trying to teach the students that they can network to get
information they need. During classwork on weather and rainfall rates,
we will have them e-mail you and ask about the weather at your location.
Please give them that day's weather report. You may find a weather report
at <font COLOR="#FFFFFF">this first link.</font> <a href="http://cirrus.sprl.umich.edu/wxnet/">http://cirrus.sprl.umich.edu/wxnet/</a>,
the home page for the Weather Net at the University of Michigan. U S weather
is found on <font COLOR="#FFFFFF">this second link.</font> <a href="http://cirrus.sprl.umich.edu/wxnet/states/states.html">http://cirrus.sprl.umich.edu/wxnet/states/states.html</a>.
Please pass both of these U R L addresses on to your student and point
out they can find the daily weather almost anywhere in the world by beginning
at this site. Note the site also contains a wealth of other weather information.
</p>

<p>The students will also ask you about whether there is flooding in your
community. Please describe the last flood you are familiar with and some
of the conditions at that time (e.g. heavy rainfall, frozen ground, blocked
streambeds, heavy building or other factors disrupting soil infiltration
capacity, etc.) If you do not have floods, pass that information along.
We hope in this way to stimulate them to think about how a model must be
able to accommodate a wide range of similar data. </p>

<p>4. The next communication we have scheduled is a small research paper.
The students will do an experiment involving sponges. The sponge will be
a simple model for soil. They will write up their experiment and mail it
to you for comment. We are trying to teach them that peer review and seeking
a critique is a normal part of science. We encourage you to be both supportive
and honest in your critiques of their papers. </p>

<p>5. In class, the students will be building a highly simplified (and
overly deterministic) model of flooding. The students will share this model
with you. Please let them know if their description is clear or not. Again,
be encouraging but honest. We urge you to tell them you are looking forward
to reading their next paper which you understand will discuss the application
of the model to another flood in Romney, W. VA, where they go to school.
</p>

<p>6. The final scheduled communication for you will be the final paper.
Please review and comment on the paper. In your response, say how much
you enjoyed working with them and wish them well in their pursuit of science.
These are the scheduled communications which will occur over an approximately
four week period. In each case, try to respond promptly. Students may also
contact you at other times. During the period of the study, we ask you
respond to each e-mail, if only briefly. After the study is over, that
is, after the final paper, you may continue the communication or inform
the student that due to the pressures of your own workload you regret you
will not be able to keep up you side of a correspondence. </p>

<p>FINALLY ..... </p>

<p>When you respond to the students, remember that they are using speech
synthesizers. The devices run words together so be aware of spacing. Avoid
bullets and lists, unless carefully constructed. Also avoid long sentences.
</p>

<p>Use periods to give pauses. </p>

<p>this </p>

<p>reads </p>

<p>like </p>

<p>this </p>

<p>is no different to the kids than </p>

<p>this reads like this. </p>

<p>this. </p>

<p>reads like. </p>

<p>this. </p>

<p>is very different. It goes: this ..pause.. reads like..pause.. this..pause.
</p>

<p>You are a great group of mentors. Thanks in advance from all of us.
</p>

<p>By the way, we hope to have all the project material up on the www.seeport.com
web site by a week from tomorrow. A list of mentors, including what everyone
does, will be among that material. Several of you have sent in suggestions,
advice, and comments/critiques. We really appreciate the help. </p>

<p>Data Analysis Instrument. </p>

<p>This template provides a form for preparing, conducting, and recording
data analysis activities. The template is organized in the following way.
Each heading introduces a new section of the template. Following each heading
is a brief description of what should be in that section. The template
is a place to record notes for yourself. It is equivalent to one part of
lab notebooks kept by many scientists. The other part is data collection.
We encourage you to be very brief, but very precise, in completing the
sections. </p>

<p>A template is provided for data entry, called ANENTR.TXT. When you open
this template, immediately save it under a new file name with your first
and last initials followed by AN1.txt. To enter data in your new file,
drop down one line from each section heading and begin typing. If you need
more than one ANfile, use the number after the AN to identify each unique
file. Thus, the name might be PSAN1.TXT. The next file would be PSAN2.TXT.</p>

<p>1. Research Question.</p>

<p>In one sentence or less, state the research question motivating this
analysis. </p>

<p>2. Hypothesis or Hypotheses. </p>

<p>State each hypothesis, in one sentence or less for each one, in a way
that it can be found false. This is called the null hypothesis.</p>

<p>3. Method.</p>

<p>For quantitative analysis, that is, analysis of numerical data, precisely
define each variable and state every equation. Clarify how the answer to
one equation is used in other equations, if that is in fact the case. </p>

<p>This project primarily involves quantitative data, yet you may wish
to examine qualitative data as well; that is, looking at ideas and concepts
with rigorous logic or other scientifically accepted methods. If you do
use qualitative analysis, describe what method you will use. For example,
are you using a deductive tool like the syllogism, or an inductive logic
tool, like pattern matching? [For an example of a syllogism, read below.
In pattern matching, you describe the features of the object or relation
in which you are interested. Next, you determine if the data you are examining
have those features. You must determine some threshold of important features
which constitutes enough to say A is in the same category as B.]</p>

<p>An example of qualitative data you might use in this project is interview
data. You might ask people about their perceptions of an event. For example,
you might talk to (or e-mail) several experts on hydrology, and ask them
what they think caused the recent Romney flood. Your analysis might conclude
that since the experts said they thought the flood was caused by a specific
set of factors, those factors are the most likely causes. If this set of
factors are the same ones resulting from your modeling effort, you might
conclude you can have high confidence in the accuracy of your model. If
the factors are very different, you might conclude you can have less confidence
in the accuracy of your model. </p>

<p>4. Analysis.</p>

<p>In this section, write down your analysis as you conduct it. In general,
you will record at least seven items: </p>

<p>A. The data item being used.</p>

<p>B. The computations or qualitative analysis conducted.</p>

<p>C. The result. </p>

<p>D. Your confidence in the result, including any factors that might raise
or lower your confidence. </p>

<p>E. Your initial conclusion about the meaning of the finding for supporting
or falsifying the hypothesis. Include mention of any possible bias or errors
that may have entered into the analysis.</p>

<p>F. The person or people conducting the analysis.</p>

<p>G. The date, time, and place the analysis was conducted. </p>

<p>For quantitative analysis, substitute the actual data values collected
for the variables and write down the equations. Then compute the equations
and write down the results. Alternatively, you can write that you are using
a computer model on a spreadsheet, and state its name and location on your
computer. Then just note the results. It is also permissible to jot down
the equations and the values you want to use and e-mail them to scied@seeport.com.
We can run the calculations for you and e-mail back the results. This procedure
is similar to a scientist logging into a more powerful computer over Internet
to run an analysis. He or she has already done the &quot;brain work.&quot;
The computer just does brute computation. </p>

<p>For qualitative analysis, write down the data you are examining and
the method for making conclusions. For example, if you are using a logical
syllogism, write down the syllogism. An example is: All men are mortal.
(A theory not yet disproved.) Joe is a man. (A data item.) Therefore, Joe
is mortal. (The finding.) If you are pattern matching, describe all the
relevant features and note whether your data item has or does not have
each feature. </p>

<p>Document Notes for Literature Reviews.</p>

<p>This template provides an outline for recording notes about documents
you read. A separate template should be completed for each document reviewed.
By taking notes on what you read, you do not have to rely solely on memory
when it comes time to prepare for a test or write a literature review for
a research paper.</p>

<p>The template is organized in the following way: Each heading introduces
a new section. Under each heading, is a brief description of what should
be in that section. Typical lengths for sections are provided. You will
note that our order follows that for footnotes and bibliography entries.
This makes it possible to quickly construct references in papers, by taking
data off the Literature Review Record. </p>

<p>A separate file, LITENTR.TXT, is available for entering your notes.
When you open this template, immediately save it under a new file name
with your first and last initials followed by LIT1.txt. To enter data in
your new file, drop down one line from each section heading and begin typing.
You will need more than one LIT file, so place a number after the LIT to
identify each unique file. Thus the name might be PSLIT1.TXT. The next
file would be PSLIT2.TXT.</p>

<p>1. Author or Authors.</p>

<p>The names of the author or authors. </p>

<p>2. Title of Document.</p>

<p>This section has the title of the article, web page, book, chapter of
a book, e-mail, newsgroup posting, and so forth. Use the complete title,
including text after commas or colons.</p>

<p>3. Name of Source of Document.</p>

<p>The book, magazine, journal, web site, or other place where the document
appeared. If the document is an entire book, you can leave this section
blank. If it is just a chapter, you need to put the title of the book here.
If the document is e-mail off a list server or a posting to a newsgroup,
place the name of the list server or newsgroup here. If it is a web site,
note that fact after the title of the site. For example, something off
our web site would have the entry Seeport, web site.</p>

<p>4. Editor of Source, if any.</p>

<p>Some books, magazines, or journals have editors. If so, their name goes
here.</p>

<p>5. Publisher.</p>

<p>Place the name of the publisher of the book, magazine, journal, web
site, or other source here. The person or company who maintains a web site,
list server, or newsgroup is its publisher. The name of web site and list
server maintainers can be obtained by reading the site or lists server
or by e-mailing the webmaster or listserver. If you do not have the name
of the maintainer, leave this section blank.</p>

<p>6. Date.</p>

<p>Place the date the document was published. For web pages it is the date
of the last update. For e-mail, list servers, and newsgroups, it is the
date of the mail or posting. </p>

<p>7. Pages or URL Address.</p>

<p>This is the precise page number on which the information you are reading
is found. For web pages, the URL address substitutes for the page number.
You do not need pages for e-mail or list server postings. </p>

<p>8. Abstract.</p>

<p>This is the reason for filling out all the above information; what it
is the document contains. If found, the following items should be included
(a sentence or two is plenty for each item): </p>

<p>A. The research question addressed.</p>

<p>B. The hypothesis or hypotheses.</p>

<p>C. The data used.</p>

<p>D. The method or methods used to collect and analyze data.</p>

<p>E. Key findings and conclusions.</p>

<p>9. Your Reaction to the Document.</p>

<p>In a sentence or two, record what you found interesting or helpful in
the document. Also note any indications or bias or other possible sources
of error or bad science.</p>

<p>Oral Presentation. </p>

<p>This template provides an outline for an oral report on your research.
The template is organized in the following way. Each heading introduces
a new section of the paper. Under each heading is a brief description of
what should be in that section. The length of the section is determined
by two things: the size of the research project, and how much you need
to say to accurately describe what is going on. We shall indicate relative
length by giving recommended times for this project.</p>

<p>A separate file, called ORALENTR.TXT is available for preparing your
presentation. When you open this template, immediately save it under a
new file name with your first and last initials followed by ORAL1.txt.
To enter data in your new file, drop down one line from each section heading
and begin typing. If you need more than one ORAL file, use the number after
the DATA to identify each unique file. Thus the name might be PSORAL1.TXT.
The next file would be PSORAL2.TXT.</p>

<p>1. Research Question.</p>

<p>Provide a very concise, one sentence description of your research question.
Then briefly explain why it is important in terms of a theory or theoretical
concepts you have learned. This section should take only a few minutes.</p>

<p>2. Hypothesis or Hypotheses.</p>

<p>Being concise, state the hypothesis. Then explain how the hypothesis
is derived from a theory or set of theoretical concepts you are relying
upon. Discuss what kinds of data would falsify the hypothesis in whole
or in part. This section should take only a few minutes.</p>

<p>3. Approach.</p>

<p>Briefly describe the method you used to collect and analyze data. Indicate
why you selected this method and any special strengths or weaknesses it
had as a way of conducting research bearing on your hypothesis and research
question.</p>

<p>If a model is being used, be sure to describe it. Explain why you are
using this model and not some other model. Present the physical and mathematical
concepts used, construct the model and how they hang together. Clarify
the accuracy and tractability (that is, ease of use) of the model. Then
explain the equations that constitute the mathematical expression of the
model. </p>

<p>Finally, describe the data you collected and where it was obtained.
If problems existed in obtaining data, or in verifying the accuracy of
the data, acknowledge these problems and describe how you got around them.</p>

<p>In the course of this discussion, where relevant, refer to other scientific
research which bears on your hypothesis, the data you collected, and the
methods you used to collect and analyze data. If you are using a model,
describe where you obtained your model. In mentioning other scientific
research you should refer to no more than two or three studies, so select
those most important for the research you are presenting. </p>

<p>This section should take no more than five minutes. </p>

<p>4. Findings.</p>

<p>Here is where you describe what you learned. For each item discussed:</p>

<p>State whether it is a substantive or methodological finding.
<br>Clearly describe the finding.
<br>Clarify how confident you are in the finding, and why you are that
confident.
<br>Explicate the meaning of the finding for your hypothesis and research
question.</p>

<p>This section should not take more than five minutes. </p>

<p>5. Conclusion.</p>

<p>In preparing this section, consider what are the five things you want
your listeners to remember from your presentation. The research question,
hypothesis, and implications of the research for the hypothesis and question
must be three of the things you want your listener to remember. The other
two are up to you. One may be some thoughts on the social implications
of your project. The other might be some thoughts on other research it
would be fun or interesting to conduct which would build on what you have
done in this project. Or, it might be why it is silly to conduct projects
like this in the future. The point is say what you think is important.

<p>The Research Paper.</p>

<p>This template provides an outline for a research paper. The template
is organized in the following way. Each heading introduces a new section
of the paper. Under each heading is a brief description of what should
be in that section. The size of the research project determines how long
the section must be and how much you need to say to accurately describe
what is going on. We shall indicate relative length by calling sections
brief, mid-length, or long. For a short paper, brief might be one sentence.
For a longer one, it could be a paragraph or two. </p>

<p>The template for actually entering the text for your paper is called
PAPRENTR.TXT. When you open this template, immediately save it under a
new file name with your first and last initials followed by PAPER1.TXT.
To enter data in your new file, drop down one line from each section heading

paper might be PSPAPER1.TXT. The next file would be PSPAPER2.TXT.</p>

<p>1. Abstract.</p>

<p>An abstract is prepared only for long papers. Running about 200 words,
it very briefly states the research question, the data and method used
to study that question, and the most important findings and conclusions.
</p>

<p>2. Research Question.</p>

<p>This major section describes what you are studying and why anyone else
should care about your study and its results. Its purpose is to help the
reader understand why you thought this research question is important.</p>

<p>A. Problem, Opportunity, or Question Addressed.</p>

<p>This subsection provides a brief introduction to the subject of your
study. The first sentence should clearly state the topic of the research
and the objective or objectives of the project. While most research projects
focus on a specific problem or opportunity in science, some projects consist
of literature reviews or discussions on topics such as the relative merits
of different research instruments. </p>

<p>B. Hypothesis. </p>

<p>This section introduces the hypothesis of the study. Remember that the
hypothesis must be worded so that it is capable of being proven false.
A good hypothesis is capable of being stated in one sentence. It is permissible
to have more than one hypothesis in a paper. All the hypotheses must then
be related to the same theory, and there should be one main hypothesis
and a series of sub-hypotheses that are derived from the primary one. If
there is no hypothesis, this section does not appear. This is a brief section.
</p>

<p>C. Significance of the Research Question.</p>

<p>This section addresses two topics. The first topic is the importance
of your research question for furthering our scientific knowledge or ability
to do science. The other is the importance of the research question from
a social perspective. By social perspective, we mean how will it make life
better for people or the planet. This is a brief section. </p>

<p>3. Background.</p>

<p>This section describes how your study fits into the grand tradition
of science and what we have learned by using scientific methods. It is
to help the reader understand why your specific hypothesis and approach
is a reasonable one to use to study this question.</p>

<p>A. Literature Review. </p>

<p>This section is mid-length. It describes relevant work by others with
respect to two topics. The first topic is substantive work related to the
research question. By substantive work we mean research reports, summaries
of what we know, and theoretical papers on the topic within which your
research question falls. For example, if your paper is on why does it flood
in Romney, the substantive topic is hydrology. The second topic is methodological
work related to your research question. By methodological work we mean
reports on the tools and methods people have used to study research questions
similar to yours. Again, looking at the flooding topic, such reports could
range from applications of mathematical equations and models to instruments
for measuring water flow in creeks to integrating satellite and ground
data for making weather predictions. </p>

<p>B. Prior Relevant Work.</p>

<p>If you have previously conducted research related to either the topic
within which the research question falls or the methodologies your have
used on this project, you should very briefly say so here. </p>

<p>4. Approach.</p>

<p>In this section, you describe how you did your research. </p>

<p>A. Data Used, and Its Sources. </p>

<p>This section is one of the most important sections in your paper. What
we can know in science is limited by what we can study. Here is where you
describe what you studied. You must say where you found or collected your
data and why you think the data is accurate and reliable. This section
is typically a mid-length section, but it could be brief if you are sure
everyone will understand why you went where you did for data and that there
is absolutely no question that the data is accurate and reliable. </p>

<p>B. Methodology.</p>

<p>Here you should describe the methods you used to collect and analyze
your data. This is a very important section, because if the method is not
appropriate for both the research question and the kind of data you are
using, your findings will be questionable. So it is vital to describe the
method clearly and completely. This should be a mid-length to long section.
</p>

<p>5. Findings.</p>

<p>The preceding section explains why anyone should believe you. In this
section you tell them what you have learned. The Findings section parallels
the Approach section in that it discusses both substantive and methodological
issues. The section is a mid-length or long one. </p>

<p>The substantive discussion explains what resulted when you analyzed
your data. The discussion should indicate how confident you are that the
finding is correct and why you have that degree of confidence. Next, discuss
how these results fully support, provided conditional support for, or falsify
the hypothesis or hypotheses. (By conditional support we mean the results
support part of the hypothesis and find other parts false.) If your results
differ from those of other scientists discussed in the Background section,
you should clearly say so here and explain why you think these differences
exist. Similarly, if your results confirm work done by others you should
note that fact. </p>

<p>The methodological discussion examines if your methods for collecting
and analyzing data worked as anticipated. If they did not, you must explain
why not, to the best of your abilities. Whether they worked as anticipated
or not, you should also indicate any ideas you have for improving the methods
should someone want to replicate (that is, repeat) this study or conduct
a similar study on a different research question. </p>

<p>6. Conclusion.</p>

<p>This is a brief section in which you do three things. First, you highlight
the most important findings and their implications for your hypothesis
or hypotheses and research question. Second, you state what the scientific
and social implications of your work are. To do so, you relate you findings
back to the discussion in the &quot;Significance of the Research Question&quot;
subsection of the &quot;Research Question&quot; section. Finally, you state
what additional substantive and methodological research seems worth conducting
in the future in light of what you have learned here. </p>

<p>7. Bibliography.</p>

<p>Using the standard bibliographic format, provide an entry for each document
you reviewed or used when conducting this research.</p>

   <title>Basketball Math: Porosity</title>
   <meta name="GENERATOR" content="Mozilla/2.01Gold (Win32)">
</head>
<body text="#000000" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" link="#0000FF" vlink="#008F93">
<font COLOR="#FFFFFF">There are two links at the
bottom of this page. The first leads back to the top of this page. The
second leads back to the main Sci-Ed page.</font> 
<h1>Basketball Math and Soil Porosity.</h1>

<p>This exercise is a simple model demonstrating how you can use mathematics
to estimate the space between soil particles. We will develop the model
in two phases. First, we will establish the components of the model. Then
we will define the fundamental building block of the model, the cell. </p>

<p>For the first phase, we will use perfectly round objects to represent
soil particles which are the individual grains that make up soil. This
is a model because soil particles are almost always irregularly shaped.
</p>

<p>Soil particles tend to be shaped more like a potato, or a hamburger,
than they are like marbles or basketballs; but since each potato is unique
in size and shape, it would be extremely difficult to come up with an arithmetic
expression to represent even one potato, let alone all potatoes. Therefore,
we will substitute spheres because their volumes are easily calculated,
and accept that there will be some uncertainty in the accuracy of our estimate,
due to the difference in shape and size between the spheres we use in the
estimate, and the actual sizes and shapes of particles in the soil. We
are more concerned with the relationship between the particles and the
spaces around them, than in the precise volume of the particles. The space
around soil particles is responsible for the soil's porosity. </p>

<p>One more word about models before we start on the arithmetic problem:
Models simplify the complexity of a real situation, so we can study a component
of that situation. Models are a concept. Mathematics and arithmetic are
two elements used in models. The difference between mathematics and arithmetic
is that mathematics is a concept and arithmetic is the process or tool.
In other words we use arithmetic to solve mathematical problems. The mathematical
problem we are going to solve is the substitution of spherical shaped for
random particles so we can get a value for the space surrounding the sphere.
We will use the arithmetic processes of multiplication, addition, and division
to get this value. Understanding the difference between mathematics and
arithmetic is important when thinking about models. It is important because
building a mathematical equation is more that just doing arithmetic. We
will explain more later. </p>

<p>After you have worked through this soil porosity model, write about
this model and send a letter to your mentor describing what a model is,
and asking how your mentor uses models, and about the sorts of models used.
</p>

<p>Here comes the model. Wake up the mathematical part of your brain. </p>

<p>Let's see how porosity works mathematically. </p>

<p>We are going to develop a simple model of the soil which looks at the
soil as a series of identical cells, each cell containing 2 kinds of space.
One kind of space is empty and the other kind of space is full. Water can
be stored in the empty space. The amount of water the soil can hold is
limited to the amount of space that is empty. To calculate the amount of
empty space, based on our substitution of tiny spheres for soil particles,
we must of the perform two operations. We must determine how much is full
and how much is empty. </p>

<p>To make this operation easy to follow, we will begin with only one sphere.
Then we will determine whether the relationship between the sphere and
the space around it is &quot;scaleable&quot;. If a problem can be solved
easily at a small scale, and then expanded to apply to a large scale, we
have a scaleable model. </p>

<p>So we will begin by examining a single sphere and the space surrounding
it. We will assume the space around it is a cube. We assume the space is
a cube because we can recognize, and if necessary prove, that the cube
is scaleable. So we are now imagining a sphere inside a cube. A basketball
inside a box. </p>

<p>QUESTION: </p>

<p>Assume you have a basketball which has a 12 inch diameter. And you put
it into a perfectly square wooden box which is 12 inches across on each
side. Think about how you would calculate what percentage of the space
in the box would still be empty? </p>

<p>... </p>

<p>The following arithmetic processes will help you to calculate this percentage.
</p>

<p>Volume of box = 12 time 12 times 12. </p>

<p>Volume of a sphere is four thirds of the product of pi times the radius
of the sphere cubed, </p>

<p>or 4/3*pi*r3 . </p>

<p>Pi equals approximately three point one four or 3.14. </p>

<p>Remember the diameter of a basket ball is twelve inches and the radius
is half of the diameter. </p>

<p>So the Volume of a basket ball is pi times six cubed times four, divided
by three, </p>

<p>or pi*6 cubed *4/3. </p>

<p>Pause the reader now while you calculate the answer. </p>

<p>.... </p>

<p>You should get the answer of forty seven percent or 47%. </p>

<p>We are rounding the numbers to whole numbers without decimals for this
exercise. </p>

<p>Here is the calculation, as we did it. </p>

<p>The volume of the cube is one thousand seven hundred and twenty eight
or 1728. </p>

<p>... </p>

<p>The volume of the basket ball is nine hundred and four point three two
or 904.32. </p>

<p>... </p>

<p>The difference in volume between the cube and the basket ball is eight
hundred and twenty three point six eight or 823.68. </p>

<p>... </p>

<p>Now divide the difference in volume by the total volume and multiply
by one hundred to find out the percentage of the cube space that is open.
</p>

<p>... </p>

<p>Eight hundred and twenty three point six eight divided by one thousand
seven hundred and twenty eight is point four seven. </p>

<p>... </p>

<p>Written with numbers it is 823.68 / 1728 = point 47 . </p>

<p>Point four seven times 100 is forty seven percent. point 47 * 100 =
47% </p>

<p>.... </p>

<p>Let's explore whether our model can be expanded to apply to a more complex
situation. </p>

<p>Would there be more or less space in the same box if the box were full
of ping pong balls? </p>

<p>Assume the diameter of a ping pong ball is one and a half inches. </p>

<p>Please pause the reader while you calculate the volume of a ping pong
ball. </p>

<p>Did you come up with the same answer of forty seven percent? If not
check your arithmetic with the following: </p>

<p>Step one: the volume of a ping pong ball. </p>

<p>The volume of a Ping pong ball in one point seven six. To calculate
this divide four by three then multiply that answer by three point one
four and multiply that by the cubed radius of a ping pong ball which is
point seven five. The volume is one point seven six. </p>

<p>Step two: the number of ping pong balls in the box. </p>

<p>Next you calculate the number of balls that fit in a twelve inch square
box. To do that you divide twelve by the diameter of a ping pong ball.
Eight ping pong balls fit in twelve inches. Now multiply eight times eight
times eight for the number of balls in a box. There are five hundred and
twelve balls. </p>

<p>Step three: the volume of the ping pong balls in the box. </p>

<p>Multiply the number of balls by the volume and you get nine hundred
and one point one two. The difference between the volume of the box and
the volume of the ping pong balls is eight hundred and twenty six point
eight eight. This difference is forty seven percent of the box space. </p>

<p>Conclusion. </p>

<p>We have discovered that a sphere of a given diameter contains about
half the volume of a cube with the same edge dimension. We have also done
a bunch of fairly simple arithmetic to that a large cube full of small
spheres still has the same percentage of its space full as empty. </p>

<p>Scaleability and simplification. </p>

<p>Now we are going to simplify the mathematics of our model. </p>

<p>We began this discussion with the introduction of the idea of a model
that was scaleable. </p>

<p>We can divide any cube into eight smaller cubes, each half as wide and
half as deep and half as tall. And we can do this again, and again, subdividing
each cube into eight ever smaller cubes, and yet they are all still cubes.
Right? </p>

<p>And we can imagine that inside each cube is a sphere, and that in each
ever smaller cube is an ever smaller sphere. Right? </p>

<p>Because we did all that arithmetic we can be pretty confident that the
percentage of space that is full of spheres and this percentage that remains
open stays the same. And because the percentage of open space and the percentage
of full space remains the same, our model of the soil, based on a basketball
in a box, is scaleable. </p>

<p>Now that you have gone through the model please think about the following
questions and write to your mentors. </p>

<p>How does this model soil porosity? </p>

<p>What would happen if you put a mixture of different size objects in
the same box? </p>

<p>If you have questions about this you can write to your mentor and describe
what you are doing. </p>

<p>You are at the end of this exercise. <font COLOR="#FFFFFF">The following

<p>Job Function: I manage all aspects of the utility including a staff
of 21. Operations include collection system, treatment plant, biosolids
composting, laboratory and industrial retreatment, and project management.
Our utility serves a population of about 28,000. Our discharge is to a
pristene river (Spokane River) that serves as the outlet to Lake Coeur
d'Alene. This river empties into the Columbia in WA. I have over 20 years
of experience in wastewater and water treatment as well as engineering.
Taught numerous municipal clients laboratory, process control and start-up
of water &amp; wastewater plants. </p>

<p>Current activity in mathematics, science and/or engineering: For the
past 5 years there has been considerable controversy concerning the continued
discharge of treated effluent to this surface water body. We have a unique
system here. The developing &quot;valley&quot; was formed by the breakage
of an ice dam that formed prehistoric Lake Missoula in Montana. This outwash
deposited hundreds of feet of highly permeable sands and gravels here and
formed the Spokane-Rathdrum Aquifer, a sole-source of drinking water for
nearly 400,000 people in ID-WA. The lake and the river contribute flow
to the aquifer, while in down-stream WA, the aqufer flows into the river.
What you do to one, you do to the other. </p>

<p>If you pull up a detailed map of the area, 2 things become apparent.
1). Much of the land is heavily forested and is administered by either
the USFS of BLM. 2). The area to the east (Kellogg) is known as the Silver
Valley. 100 years of hardrock mining occurred here and the resultant waste
has produced the largest EPA Superfund site in the U.S. </p>

<p>The USGS has recently completed a detailed study of the heavy-metals
enriched sediments of the lake as well as a nutrient budget. They have
found that the lake has reverted to a more pristene state- from mesotrophic
to oligotrophic- in the past 20 years. This is due to both a cessation
of mining activities and better timber management practices. They have
also found that the only way to keep the heavy metals from re-solublizing
is through nutrient management. A draft basin plan has recently been published.
It will involve all the federal agencies, an indian tribe, the state, 3
counties, several municipalities, and environmental groups. </p>

<p>In the last 5 years, I've personally been involved with water quality
research projects, both on a peer review basis and as director of our own
water quality research program. We have found that there is a significant
source of phosphorus near the lake's outlet, probably coming from the practice
of storing logs for later river shipment to the mills along the river.
We have been monitoring total P, dissolved ortho-P, ammonia, BOD, chorophyll
a, DO, turbidity, fecal coliforms and heavy metals. I have had the opportunity
to provide peer review on the USGS study, 2 WA state studies, the basin/lake
management plan, and a proposed phased Total Maximum Daily Limit (TMDL)
for total P. I also am a member of the Coeur d'Alene Basin Interagency
Group, composed of all the agencies and players involved in water quality
issues throughout the basin. In addition to publishing our study, our lab
is able to conduct many of the tests found in Standard Methods for the
Examination of Water &amp; Wastewater. </p>

<p>Job Function: I am curious about the physiological responses of plants
and plant ecosystems as they are modified by the external environment,
especially when the environment has been altered as a result of man's influence.
Anthropogenic changes in the environment surrounding a plant can significantly
alter normal plant physiological processes. I am interested in conducting
research on the direct and indirect effects of environmental pollution
and natural stresses on the physiology, growth, and productivity of agricultural

<p>Job Function: My funtion is to manage and oversee Biocode's technology
development activities. Biocode provides companies with systems for secretly
marking or coding their products as a means of detecting and deterring
counterfeiting. </p>

<p>Current activity in mathematics, science and/or engineering: My activities
revolve around the application of chemistry, biochemistry, and immunology.
The test methods that we use to detect the chemical markers are based on
a technology known as immunoassay. This is a common technology used in
the medical field for detecting disease, cancer, pregnancy and other clinical
conditions as well as for monitoring hormone and drug levels in the blood.
</p>

<p>Methodologies used in your work: Immunoassay. - we develop antibodies
to chemicals and then use the antibodies as the basis of very sensitive
methods for detecting and measuring the chemicals. Immunoaffinity Chromatography.
- antibodies are like magnetics that attach very specifically to only the
chemical that they were developed against. We attach the antibodies onto
particles that are packed into a column. The column then acts like a very
specific filter that can be used to purify and concentrate specific chemicals
from crude extracts. We use this technique in analyzing some samples. Invisible
Printing. - we also develop invisible inks that can be printed onto labels,
containers, computer chips and so forth. We can then develop the print
using our antibody based reagents. We can print the inks using methods
such as ink jet technology, flexographic printing, and simple pens. </p>

<h1><i>Introduction to Week Three.</i></h1>

<p>AFTER YOU HAVE LEARNED THE CONCEPTS OF INFILTRATION, POROSITY ETC.,
THIS WILL SERVE AS BOTH A REVIEW AND A CHANCE TO PUT ALL THE PIECES TOGETHER.
</p>

<p>The following analysis applies to any site. It could be a drainage basin,
a river, a reservoir, a wetland, a playground, or a parking lot. Two conditions
must occur for it to flood. </p>

<ol>
<li>The total quantity of water (Qd = volume delivered) must exceed the
storage capacity (Qs = volume stored) of the site. AND.</li>

<li>The rate of water delivery (Din = input) must exceed the rate of water
discharged (Dout = output) from the site.</li>
</ol>

<li>The terms for the amount of Water delivered (Din) and for the amount
of Water discharged (Dout) are each expressed in terms that include both
volume and time. </li>

<li>The terms normally used to describe rainfall are usually depth (in
inches), and time (24 hours). </li>

<li>The terms used to describe discharge (stream-flow) normally include
both volume and time. The term used is Cubic Feet per Second or cfs.
<br>Areas are normally expressed in acres or in square feet. </li>

<li>These terms are widely different in scale, but must be converted to
common units before they can be used together. Fortunately, the terms can
be converted easily. </li>

<p>ACRES.
<br>Land area is normally discussed in units called Acres. An acre is an
area that is square and 208.7 feet on a side. There are 43,560 square feet
in an acre. There are .00002 acres in a square foot. </p>

<p>SECONDS.
<br>There are 60 seconds in a minute , 60 minutes in an hour and 24 hours
in a day. Therefore, there are 60*60*24 = 86,400 seconds in a 24 hour day
(you can remember this gnarly number as a big number that is a bit more
than 10 percent less than 100,000). </p>

<p>CUBIC FEET.
<br>There are 12 inches in a foot and 12*12*12 = 1728 cubic inches in a
cubic foot. Volumes are also referred to in gallons. One gallon equals
.013 cubic feet. There are 7.48 gallons in a cubic foot. </p>

<p>CFS.
<br>Stream-flow and other discharges are normally referred to in Cubic
Feet per Second. To convert between inches of rainfall (Din) to cfs (Dout)
, this is what you do: </p>

<h2>EXERCISE:</h2>

<p>Here's a simple exercise in putting these conversions to work: </p>

<p>NOTE: The area of the campus is actually 79 acres. However, in the exercise
that follows, we will begin by using 100 acres, for convenience. Scientists
often reduce the complexity of the numbers used in equations to help reveal
the basic relationships between the terms. They do this by rounding them
off to the nearest order of magnitude. It is much more convenient to use
numbers like 1, 10, 100, 1000. than to use numbers like 7, 13, 321, or
1179. </p>

<p>The decision on which number to substitute is based on the following
rules. </p>

<ul>
<li>The numbers 7, 13, 321, and 1279 become 10,10, 100, 1000. </li>

<li>Adding 7, 13, 321, and 790 gives a total of 1131. </li>

<li>Adding 10, 10, 100, and 1000 gives a total of 1120. </li>

<li>The difference between the totals is 21. In this case, the &quot;error&quot;
the process introduces is very small, less than one percent. Obviously,
this discrepancy (loss of accuracy) will not always be the same. There
are at least three reasons for doing this. </li>

<ol>
<li>If you reduce the complexity to the level where all you are keeping
track of is the size of the final number, you are more likely to be able
to recognize &quot;procedural&quot; errors. Errors like multiplying when
you should be adding or dividing. </li>

<li>If you do not get bogged down in complicated arithmetic, you are less
likely to make errors in the first place. </li>

<li>None of the numbers used in hydrology are very precise, so there is
little overall accuracy gained from using extremely precise numbers to
describe events. The radar gun pointed at a log floating down a river may
show the mid-channel velocity to be 42 miles per hour, but it would be
a mistake to assume the entire volume of water in the river was moving
at that rate. </li>
</ol>
</ul>

<p>ACTUAL EXERCISE: </p>

<p>Assume that 10 inches of rain fell on the school's campus in the most
recent storm. And assume that the area of the campus is 100 acres. </p>

<p>PROCESS: </p>

<ol>
<li>First convert the area of the campus to square feet.
<br>Answer: 100 acres = 4,356,000 square feet. </li>

<li>Then convert the total amount of rainfall to cubic feet.
<br>Area times Depth = Volume.
<br>Depth = 10 inches = .833333 feet.
<br>4,356,000 square feet times .83333 feet = 3,630,000 cubic feet.
<br>Then convert it cfs.
<br>3,630,000 divided by 86,400 = 42.01388 cfs. </li>
</ol>

<p>In the exercise we just performed, we calculated that 10 inches of rainfall
on the campus equals 3,630,000 cubic feet of rain. This number is not enough
to establish whether or not it will flood. There are several other things
we need to know if it will flood one of them is time. When we included
time, we found that the average rate of delivery, over the 24 hour duration
of the storm, was 42 cfs. To predict flooding, we really only need to know
whether the infiltration capacity of the site is greater than this amount
or less. If infiltration capacity is less than 42 cfs, there will be places
on the campus where water forms ponds and there will be surface runoff
from the site. </p>

<p>The rate at which water can infiltrate, or pass through the soil, is
related to the porosity of the soil, which we can express as a maximum
rate. The number is based on the percentage of open space in the soil.
</p>

<p>The infiltration rate at the site varies over time, in response to events.
When the soil is saturated, at the end of the storm event, the effective
infiltration rate will be zero. It is zero because the rate at which water
is delivered to the site exceeds the rate at which it percolates into the
soil, less water can pass through the surface than is being delivered.
</p>

<p>Water is stored in a variety of a places in a drainage basin, and many
of these places can be found on the school campus. Water collects on surfaces,
in ponds, and within the porosity of materials. It is stored as droplets
on the blades of grass of the lawn, on the leaves of the trees, and in
ponds and ditches and streams. It is also stored underground, in the spaces
between the particles of the soil. </p>

<p>We have explored how soil works like a sponge. The area of the soil
surface that is available for infiltration is the first control on the
infiltration rate. </p>

<p>A stream also works like our sponge. Water flows through a stream at
a rate defined by its slope (known as its gradiant) and other less important
characteristics of the channel. As a result of these characteristics, a
stream has a capacity which is an amount of water it can hold at any time.
If we exceed the capacity of the stream, it will flood. </p>

<p>A stream is just like a pond, except that the water in it is always
moving &quot;down-stream&quot;. The storage capacity of the stream is the
same as the capacity of a pond of the same size. It can hold a particular
volume, which depends on its width, length and depth. When we increase
the amount of water carried in the stream, its depth increases. The depth
of a stream is expressed as height. </p>

<p>Seasonal fluctuations in the stream's height are measured at sites known
as stream gages, established and monitored by state and federal agencies.
</p>

<p>We are going to imagine the school site as a very wide but very slow-moving
river. </p>

<p>First. Imagine a stream that is 1 foot deep and 40 feet wide. </p>

<ul>
<li>Question. If the stream's capacity is 3,600,000 cubic feet in 24 hours
(42 cfs) , how fast is the water in the stream actually moving? . </li>

<li>Answer: A little more than 1 foot per second. </li>
</ul>

<p>Process to solve this: </p>

<ul>
<li>cubic feet divided by cubic feet per second = feet per second.</li>
</ul>

<p>Water in the imaginary stream makes a useful model for the water moving
through the school site. The cross-sectional area of the stream is the
model of the area of the school site. The rate of the water running down
the stream is a model for the water flowing down into the ground. </p>

<p>The school site is over 100,000 times larger than the imaginary stream.
(4,356,000 square feet instead of 40 square feet) . Yet the total flow
is the same (42 cfs). This means that infiltration must be one one hundred-thousandth
as fast as water flows in the stream. Or, if the maximum rate of infiltration,
averaged over the entire site, is really only 42 cfs, then it could take
all day for a foot of water to soak into the ground. </p>

<p>In the case of an asphalt-paved parking lot, Qs is small. Total storage
volume is equal to the area of the lot times the distance (5 mm) or so
that water penetrates into the asphalt. Dout is a function of the slope
of the parking lot, and the surrounding topography. if Qd is larger than
Qs, then water will flow from the site. If Din is larger than Dout (the
rate it flows off the site) it will flood. </p>

<p>Volume = depth * area. </p>

<p>The same is true of a river or lake. The river channel has an area,
and a depth. The width of the river channel changes (increases) is its
depth increases, to accommodate (storage) increased volume of water. cross
sectional area. </p>

<p>There is a direct causal relationship between these expressions: </p>

<p>In order for Qd to be greater than Qs , (written as Qd &gt; Qs), Din
must be &gt; Dout. </p>

<p>The expression has four logical states:</p>

<ol>
<p> </p>

<li>If Qd &gt; Qs and Din &lt; Dout, flooding = false. </li>

<li>If Qd &lt; Qs and Din &lt; Dout, flooding = false. </li>

<li>If Qd &gt; Qs and Din &gt; Dout, flooding = true. </li>

<li>If Qd &gt; Qs and Din &gt; Dout, flooding = true. </li>
</ol>

<p>OR. </p>

<ol>
<li>If Qd &gt; Qs and D in &lt; D out, flooding does not happen. </li>

<li>If Qd &lt; Qs and D in &lt; D out, flooding does not happen. </li>

<li>If Qd &gt; Qs and D in &gt; D out, flooding happens. </li>

<li>If Qd &gt; Qs and D in &gt; D out, flooding happens. </li>
</ol>

<p>Infiltration: </p>

<p>&quot;Infiltration is the movement of water into the soil. There is
a maximum rate at which the soil in a given condition can absorb water;
this upper limit is called the infiltration capacity of the soil.&quot;
(Dunne and Leopold). If rainfall is less than the infiltration capacity
then it is absorbed into the ground. If it is greater that infiltration
and exceeds the infiltration capacity, it runs over the ground surface
to streams (runoff). </p>

<p>Rate is a measure of quantity divided by an amount of time. Cars move
along roads at rates expressed in distance moved (miles) per unit of time
(hour) or miles per hour. Rainfall intensity is expressed in inches accumulated
per 24-hour day. Infiltration rate is expressed as depth per unit time.
For example 1 inch per hour.(Actually, this is ironic. The world uses cm
for infiltration, and inches for precipitation.) </p>

<p>Rainfall intensity is also expressed in depth per time units. An equation
for predicting runoff can be set up as: </p>

<ol>
<li>If Infiltration rate &gt; rainfall intensity, then the water goes into
the ground. </li>

<li>If Infiltration rate &lt; rainfall intensity, then the water runs over
the ground. </li>
</ol>

<p>Process of Infiltration: </p>

<p>Infiltration is a complex process. Three factors (parameters) are interrelated
in their effect on the infiltration process. These parameters can be used
to isolate the individual factors which control the infiltration rate .
These parameters are the capacity, transmissivity and permeability of the
soil. </p>

<ol>
<li>Permeability controls the rate at which water enters the soil. It is
controlled by the conditions of the soil surface and it is expressed as
a rate. </li>

<li>Soil capacity expresses the volume available for water storage within
a given volume of soil, it is derived as the available percentage (the
volume of air inside of the total volume), which is a volume. </li>

<li>Transmissivity expresses rate at which water moves through the soil.
It is derived from volume and time and is expressed as a rate. </li>
</ol>

<p>In other words, infiltration describes a process which allows us to
describe (and predict) how much water will get into the soil, based on
how much is already there and how quickly water drains through the soil.
</p>

<p>The rate of infiltration changes over time during a storm. If the rate
of rainfall stays the same, the infiltration rate will be faster at first
than it will be after one or two hours. Eventually, it will slow to a constant
rate, which is limited by the transmissivity of the soil . This is because
the small pores in the soil, which under &quot;normal&quot; conditions
are filled with air, fill with water, which clings to the particles by
surface tension (the wetting process), and resist further motion. Over
time, gravity overcomes the wetting, and the water migrates down through
the soil (percolation) until it reaches the water table. If enough water
is added, the air spaces within the soil fill up and the soil cannot take
in any more water, limiting infiltration rate to the transmissivity rate
of the soil. </p>

<p>If the soil is located in a low area such as a field next to a river,
or near a wetland, the water table (the depth at which the soil is already
saturated) is normally close to, or above, the water level observable in
the river. This means that there is little depth in the soil to be filled,
and that saturation will occur relatively quickly. Once saturation occurs,
the rate of infiltration approaches zero. Because all of the soil particle
spaces near the surface are filled and any added water runs off. </p>

<p>The most important factors affecting infiltration of water are </p>

<ol>
<li>Rainfall characteristics, such as intensity, duration, and timing.
</li>

<li>Surface conditions, and </li>

<li>Soil properties. </li>
</ol>

<p>Surface conditions are dominated by, </p>

<ol>
<li>Land use. </li>

<li>Vegetation. </li>
</ol>

<p>RAINFALL.
<br>The most important characteristic of rainfall, as it affects infiltration
rate, are its intensity, duration and its timing. By now it should be clear
how the rate if infiltration changes over the course of an event, as the
upper layer of the soil becomes saturated. After rain begins, the moisture
level in the soil rises. The rate of increase is primarily controlled by
conditions above the surface (slope, land cover and surface condition)
which intercept water and the porosity of the soil itself. After the rain
ceases, the moisture level decreases. The rate of decrease is primarily
controlled by the location, the topography, and characteristics of the
soil, which are normally related The soil stays wet for a long time after
a storm, because the time component of the decrease is long, The impact
of a storm is greatly influenced by its relation to prior weather. Timing
is crucial. If the soil is still partly or substantially saturated from
a previous rain storm, its infiltration capacity is proportionately reduced,
and runoff will occur at intensities that would not normally result in
runoff. </p>

<p>If rainfall is intense enough, and persists long enough, it can also
alter the structure of the soil surface. Fine soil particles are mobilized
by the impact of the rain, forming mud. Pores become clogged with mud and
the infiltration is impeded. The impact of raindrops thus compacts the
soil surface and also keeps water from infiltrating. There are other factors
which can affect the impedance of exposed soil (a way to express the resistance
to infiltration of the soil, useful in constructing mathematical models),
including fire, which scorches and glazes the surface into a nearly waterproof
material. Exposure to direct sunlight has a similar effect. For this reason
(and others) plowed fields have vastly reduced infiltration capacity, compared
to forests or undisturbed areas. </p>

<p>SOIL PROPERTIES.
<br>If soil texture is coarse, such as sand, then the water will drain
through the soil quickly. If the soil texture is fine like clay the soils
drain slowly. Organic matter in the soil will also increase the rate of
infiltration. why So a coarse textured sandy soil with organic matter will
drain much faster that a clay soil with no organic matter. </p>

<p>Surface conditions. Surface conditions are characterized along a range
that indicates permeability. They range from essentially impermeable, like
the hull of a boat, or the roof of a house, (whose infiltration rate may
be expressed in milligrams per square meter per day) to highly permeable,
like a gravel parking lot or a sandbox at a play-field, whose rate of infiltration
could exceed one cubic foot per second per square yard. </p>

<p>Seasonal changes in soil properties are minor as long as the temperature
remains above freezing, but they can have serious effects in areas where
the winter temperatures go below 32 degrees. Fahrenheit. When water freezes
it expands, and when soil freezes, the water in the soil is no longer able
to move to allow new water to enter from above, and it expands, filling
more space than it normally occupies. If the soil freezes, the ice crystals
within the soil can block water from infiltrating and leave it no alternative
route but to run-off. </p>

<p>VEGETATION.
<br>Trees, grass, or just leaves on the soil surface will break the impact
of raindrops on the soil surface. They also provide organic matter to the
soil, and help keep the soil temperature low, reducing evaporation. They
also provide a component known as seasonal variation to the permeability
equation. </p>

<p>LAND USE. </p>

<p>Urbanization. Replacing trees or meadows with roads, parking-lots and
walkways [paved with asphalt or covering the ground with buildings definitely
decreases infiltration and increases runoff. Water is intercepted, because
it simply cannot penetrate these materials to infiltrate. Associated with
the buildings and pavement are a complex series of ditches, gutters, storm-drains
and other conveyances which redirect the intercepted water to other areas,
adding water which overwhelms the infiltration capacity of that site. </p>

<p>Farming. Farming practices using heavy machinery to plow the fields
and remove vegetation can do two things to decrease infiltration: </p>

<ol>
<li>Machines used in agriculture, especially motorized harvest equipment,
compact the soil and reduce the pore size so there is no room for water.
</li>

<li>By removing vegetation (as harvested crops), the soil is exposed to
impact from raindrops and looses much of its organic material. </li>
</ol>

<p>Slope. I want to address slope in this, and it is not clear where to
put it, except as a vector which affects time. Here is how time works in
the equations. </p>

<ol>
<li>Total quantity = subtotal absorbed + subtotal run-off + subtotal re-evaporated
</li>

<li>Ignore re-evaporation.</li>

<li> Introduce concept of time.</li>

<li> Total quantity delivered in one event = Total rate*time.</li>

<li> Total rate*time = subtotal absorbed + subtotal run-off.</li>

<li> Total rate*time = (rate of absorbtion*time) + subtotal run-off.</li>

<ul>
<li> If (total rate*time) - (rate of absorbtion*time) &lt; 0, then subtotal
run-off = 0 </li>

<li>If (total rate*time) - (rate of absorbtion*time) &gt; 0, then subtotal
run-off &gt; 0.</li>
</ul>

<li>Absorbtion varies through two ranges, during storm event and approaches
limit of zero.</li>

<ul>
<li> rate of absorbtion varies from 1 (permeability limit) to t (transmissivity
limit).</li>

<li> rate of absorbtion varies from t (transmissivity limit) to 0 (none=
saturation).</li>
</ul>

<li>Absorbtion varies through two ranges, following storm event and approaches
limit of 1.</li>

<ul>
<li> rate of absorbtion varies from t (transmissivity limit) to 1 (permeability
limit).</li>

<li> rate of absorbtion varies from 0 (none=saturation) to t (transmissivity
limit).</li>
</ul>

<li>Total rate * time = (rate of absorbtion*time) + subtotal run-off. </li>
</ol>

<BR>
Department of Agriculture <BR>

Department of Defense <BR>
Department of Education <BR>
Department of Energy <BR>
Department of Health and Human Services (including the National Institutes

<P><A NAME="Char"></A>
<HR></P>

<H3>Characteristics <BR>
</H3>

<P>Characteristics include the science(s) underlying the technology, state
of development (concept, fundamental research, applied research, development,
off-the-shelf), efficacy (how well the technology works), fragility (how
consistently the technology works under what conditions), scope (operations
affected), trailability (ability to implement the technology in small pieces
or over limited time frames), adaptability (ease of modifying the technology
for the receiving organization), and packaging (how tightly integrated
the physical objects and know-how that comprise the technology are), and
probable permissible price range. </P>

<P><A NAME="copy"></A>
<HR></P>

<H3>Copyright </H3>

<P>Copyright is a right to a literary production (which can include a software
code as well as books) and which gives the holder an exclusive right to
make copies of the literary item, publish them, and sell them for a period
of time. What is protected is the form of the expression of the idea, not
the underlying idea. In the U.S., a copyright is automatically granted
when an embodiment of an idea is made, and if an encircled C, the name
of the owner, and the year of first publication are added to the expression.
Enforcing the right in court against infringers requires registration with
the <A HREF="http://lcweb.loc.gov/copyright/">U.S. Copyright Office</A>,
part of the Library of Congress. If the registration is made within three
months of the first publication date, rights to statutory damages and attorney's
fees in suits against infringers can be obtained. </P>

<P><A NAME="intell"></A>
<HR></P>

<H3>Intellectual Property </H3>

<P>Intellectual property is the legal name for the technology, the ideas,
and ways of combining ideas and technology. </P>

<P>In all Federally funded phases, small businesses have the right by law
to retain patents resulting from the R&amp;D. Yet this is not an automatic
process. If the company elects to retain the rights to an invention that
occurs during a period of federally-funded R&amp;D, it must declare a discovery
and make a formal act of election. </P>

<P>Be aware that special rules apply to the STTR program. Before receiving
an STTR award, a small business must negotiate a written agreement between
the small business concern and the research institution, allocating intellectual
property rights and rights, if any, to carry out follow-on research, development,
or commercialization. The small business concern must submit this agreement
to the awarding Federal agency on request; either with the proposal or
at any time thereafter. </P>

<P>Under U.S. law, intellectual property can be protected by three tools:
<A HREF="glossary.htm#pat">patent</A>, <A HREF="glossary.htm#copy">copyright</A>,
and<A HREF="glossary.htm#ts"> trade secret</A>. </P>

<P><A NAME="literate"></A>
<HR></P>

<H3>Literature Review/Literature Search</H3>

<P>Literature reviews (sometimes called literature searches) seek out relevant
articles in libraries, on the Internet, or both for review. The articles
are then examined for pertinent information. It is important to remember
the literature selected must be related to the questions motivating the
search. Trade literature is far better than scholarly journals for answering
most marketing questions. </P>

<P><A NAME="pat"></A>
<HR></P>

<H3>Patent </H3>

<P>A patent is a right to an invention that is granted by the Government
and that gives the holder an exclusive right to use an invention during
a period of time. In the United States, before a patent can be issued,
the inventor must demonstrate his or her invention is new and non-obvious.
To be new, an invention must not have been known nor made by others in
the U.S. The invention can also not have been previously patented or presented
in a publication prior to the claimed date on which the invention was made.
Patents are handled by the <A HREF="http://www.uspto.gov/">U.S. Patent
Office</A>, part of the Department of Commerce.</P>

<P>Non-obvious is established with reference to what would be obvious to
a person of ordinary skill in the relevant technology (or technologies)
at the time of the invention. A general rule is that the more complicated
the technology and the greater the rate at which it is developing, the
higher the skill-level of that hypothetical ordinary person. Non-obvious
is determined by examining prior patents, technical publications, and non-secret
work being conducted. Usually some aspect of an invention will be non-obvious
and thus capable of being patented. </P>

<P>It is important to recognize that different rules apply in different
countries. In the U.S., you have one year from the time of first disclosure,
use, publication, or sale of an invention to patent the invention. Where
more than one person or group makes a claim to be the inventor, the patent
goes to the person or group which can demonstrate priority in time. Overseas,
the rules are different. Usually the invention must be patented before
any public disclosure, use, publication, or sale. In case of a dispute,
priority goes to the first person or group to apply for a patent, regardless
of who may actually be the inventor. You can, however, get the same overseas
priority rights you would get from simultaneously filing overseas and in
the U.S. if you file in each relevant country within 12 months of a U.S.
patent application. </P>

<P><A NAME="SBIR1"></A>
<HR></P>

<H3>Phase I SBIR <BR>
</H3>

<P>Phase I is based on proposals solicited by participating agencies. These
solicitations contain topics on which small firms are invited to submit
proposals. The proposals describe the results the firm intends to attain,
the approach the firm will take, and how it will prove the feasibility
of its approach. Phase I projects typically run six months. </P>

<P>The object of this phase is to determine the technical feasibility of
a proposed project and the performance quality the small firm can provide.
Phase I enables the agency to address these questions with relatively small
agency investment, thereby increasing the efficiency with which Federal
R&amp;D dollars in Phase II are utilized. </P>

<P><BR>
<A NAME="SBIRII"></A></P>

<H3>Phase II SBIR <BR>
</H3>

<P>The objective of Phase II is to create a prototype. Up to 50% of an
award can be subcontracted out to accomplish Phase II work. Phase II projects
typically run two years. </P>

<P>Only firms which have successfully completed Phase I can compete for
Phase II awards. Phase II awards are based on the results of Phase I, technical
merit, Agency priority, and commercial applications. <BR>
</P>

<P><A NAME="SBIRIII"></A></P>

<H3>Phase III SBIR <BR>
</H3>

<P>Phase III is conducted by the small business (including joint-ventures
or R&amp;D partnerships) to pursue commercial applications of the R&amp;D
conducted in Phases I and II. Non- Federal funds, including those obtained
through exercising the follow-on funding commitments are emphasized in
Phase III. Phase III, however, may also involve follow-on non-SBIR funded
R&amp;D or production contracts with a Federal agency for products or processes
intended for use by the U.S. Government. Because the production contract
is a follow-on to a competitive SBIR award, the production contract is
considered to be competitive awards under the Competition in Contracting
Act even if no new competition has been held. <BR>
</P>

<P><A NAME="STTR1"></A>
<HR></P>

<H3>Phase I STTR <BR>
</H3>

<P>Phase I determines the scientific, technical, and commercial merit and
feasibility of the proposed cooperative effort and the quality of performance
of the small business awardee concern. Once again a relatively small Federal
agency investment is made prior to consideration of further Federal support
at the Phase II level. The normal period of performance for Phase I is
approximately one year and generally awards do not exceed $100,000. Proposals
are evaluated on a competitive basis. <BR>
</P>

<P><A NAME="STTRII"></A></P>

<H3>Phase II STTR <BR>
</H3>

<P>Phase II continues the research or research and development effort from
Phase I. Only successful STTR Phase I awardees are eligible to participate
in Phase II. The normal period of performance for Phase II is approximately
two years and generally awards do not exceed $500,000. <BR>
</P>

<P><A NAME="STTRIII"></A></P>

<H3>Phase III STTR <BR>
</H3>

<P>Phase III involves commercial applications of STTR funded research or
research and development. It is funded by non-Federal sources of capital
or awards from non-STTR Federal funding sources. The competition for Phase
I and Phase II STTR satisfies any competition requirements of the Competition
in Contracting Act with respect to follow-on procurement. <BR>
</P>

<P><A NAME="specs"></A>
<HR></P>

<H3>Performance Specifications <BR>
</H3>

<P>Performance Specifications (Specifications) include function (materials,
process, or product technology), performance traits, and the capabilities
workers need to use the technology. <BR>
<A NAME="PI"></A>
<HR></P>

<H3>Principal Investigator (PI) </H3>

<P>The PI is the person who is responsible for the conduct of the research
project. The PI is almost always a senior researcher actively involved
in the day-to-day conduct of the effort. </P>

<P><A NAME="inst"></A>
<HR></P>

<H3>Research Institution </H3>

<P>A research institution is any organization which is a university, contractor-operated
federally funded research and development center, or a nonprofit institution
as defined in section 4(5) of the Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation
Act of 1980. In general, research institutions are universities, non-profit
laboratories, or laboratories belonging to the Departments of Defense,
Energy, Commerce (NOAA, NIST), USDA, Interior, EPA, NASA, or other agencies.
</P>

<P><A NAME="SB"></A>
<HR></P>

<H3>Small Business </H3>

<P>A small business is a for-profit concern that is independently owned
and operated, not dominant in its field, and has its principal place of
business in the U.S. At least 51% of the ownership (or voting stock) must
belong to U.S. citizens or lawfully admitted resident aliens. A small business
has no more than 500 full and part-time employees in it and all its affiliates.
Affiliates are companies in which one controls the other either directly
or indirectly through common ownership, common management, or contractual
relationships. Affiliation is found where two or more companies are under
the control of a common third party or parties. </P>

<P><A NAME="Niche"></A>
<HR></P>

<H3>Technology Niche <BR>
</H3>

<P>Most technologies can be used in applications that cut across traditional
industry lines. A Technology Niche is this set of applications. For example,
signal analysis techniques and non-destructive test and evaluation (NDT&amp;E)
instrumentation developed for military aerospace applications can be applied
to surveying commercial boats, non-invasive medical diagnostic equipment,
and assessing the internal structure of old growth timber. <BR>
<A NAME="ts"></A>
<HR></P>

<H3>Trade Secret </H3>

<P>A trade secret is a plan, process, tool, mechanism, or compound that
is known only to its owner and those of his employees in whom it is necessary
to confide. So long as it is kept secret, it is a form of protected property
and the owner may sue those who steal it for damages. Unlike patents, a
trade secret will not protect an invention against an independent discovery
by someone else. The most famous trade secret is probably the formula for
Coca Cola. </P>

<P><TT>Building and Fire Research Laboratory </TT></P>

<P>Major goals of the NIST Building and Fire Research Laboratory are to
improve the productivity of the U.S. construction industry, which now faces
stiff competition from overseas firms, and to reduce the human and economic
losses resulting from fires, earthquakes, winds, and other hazards. Through
performance prediction and measurement technologies, as well as technical
advances, the laboratory works to improve the life-cycle quality of constructed
facilities. </P>

<P>The laboratory studies fire science and fire safety engineering; building
materials; computer-integrated construction practices; and structural,
mechanical, and environmental engineering. Products of the laboratory's
research include measurements and test methods, performance criteria, and
technical data that are incorporated into building and fire standards and
codes. Staff members are involved in more than 100 activities to develop
voluntary standards. </P>

<P>The laboratory conducts investigations at the scenes of major fires
as well as structural failures due to earthquakes, hurricanes, or other
causes. The knowledge gained from these investigations guides research
and is applied to recommendations for design and construction practices
to reduce hazards. </P>

<P>Both users and manufacturers of computer and telecommunications technologies
benefit from the work of the Computer Systems Laboratory (CSL). Its research
and testing programs foster the orderly development of an &quot;open systems&quot;
environment intended to make all forms of information technology compatible
and interoperable. For manufacturers of hardware and software, industry-wide
adoption of standards expands marketing opportunities, and users are freed
of the constraints and frustrations of incompatible proprietary systems.
</P>

<P>Much of CSL's work consists of advising and assisting industry in developing
standards that satisfy user needs and yet accommodate innovations that
differentiate the products of competing vendors. To help protect information
in federal computer systems, CSL personnel advise and assist federal agencies
in planning computer-security programs, increasing awareness of the need
for computer security, and carrying out computer-security training. </P>

<P>CSL also has research programs on parallel processing, automated speech
and image recognition, database and network management, software engineering,
and other topics related to the effective use of information technology.

</P>

<P>When a company has technology which is just emerging from R&amp;D and
not yet ready for commercial introduction, additional capital may be needed
to conduct production engineering, market research and entry, or workforce
training. </P>

<P>Different sources for funds are typically tapped depending on the stage
of a company's growth. </P>

<P>Zero stage or start-up funding is commonly obtained from family members,
friends, and local informal investors or &quot;angels.&quot; Second stage
and subsequent funding may be obtained through mechanisms such as research
and development limited partnerships or from venture capital companies.
As the commercial success of a company is demonstrated, bank and commercial
bond debt becomes increasingly viable as a source of funds. </P>

<P>Regardless of the kind of outside investment being sought, companies
can increase their likelihood of success through four activities: </P>

<OL>
<LI><A HREF="property.htm#7.37">auditing intellectual property</A>; </LI>

<LI><A HREF="marketr.htm#4.1">identifying applications for technology and

technology</A>; and, </LI>

<LI><A HREF="#7.1">developing financial projections</A>. </LI>
</OL>

<P>There is a bonus in conducting intellectual property audits, undertaking
preliminary market research, forming development plans, and engaging in
financial planning. These four activities force you to make your assumptions
about, and procedures in, your business explicit. They require you to consider
the likely results of your actions. Understanding the implicit assumptions
and procedures in your business is one of the keys to business success.
</P>

<P>Financial projections, market assessments, and development plans, provide
the building blocks for business plans. <A NAME="7.1"></A>
<HR></P>

<H3>Financial Projections </H3>

<P>Developing financial projections involves pulling together the results
of market research, development plans, and other cost data to produce four
items: cash budgets, pro forma statements, capital investment analyses
and capital source studies. Most investors want financial projections that
run five years into the future. </P>

<P>Cash budgets should be projected for at least the first year. They should
combine: </P>

<UL>
<LI>expected sales revenues, </LI>

<LI>cash receipts, </LI>

<LI>material, labor and overhead expenses and, </LI>

<LI>cash disbursements on a monthly basis. </LI>
</UL>

<P>This permits anticipation of fluctuations in the level of cash and planning
for short term borrowing and investment. </P>

<P>Pro forma statements should include both income statements and balance
sheets. These should be projected quarterly for at least the first three
years, although many investors will ask for pro forma statements for five
years. The statements combine: </P>

<UL>
<LI>expected sales and other revenues; </LI>

<LI>production, marketing, and administrative expenses; </LI>

<LI>product, market, or process investments; and, </LI>

<LI>loans from suppliers, banks, or investment companies. </LI>
</UL>

<P>Pro forma statements permit you to anticipate the financial results
of your operations and to plan intermediate term borrowing and investments.
</P>

<P>Capital investment analyses and capital source studies should be prepared
for planning up to five years ahead. The investment analyses should compare
rates of return for product, market, or process investment, while the source
studies should consist of a set of comparisons of cost and availability
of debt and equity and expected level of retained earnings. These analyses
and source studies should be prepared quarterly so that you may anticipate
the financial consequences of changes in your company's strategy. They
will allow you to plan long-term borrowing, equity placements, and major
investments. <A NAME="7.2"></A>

<H3>SBA Financial Assistance Programs </H3>

<P>The Federal government provides only limited direct financial assistance
for small companies. </P>

<P>The Small Business Administration (SBA) offers two forms of financial
assistance. The Guaranteed Lending Program provides financial assistance
to small businesses through local lending institutions. Under this program,
SBA will guarantee up to 90% or $500,000 of the loan, whichever is less.
Additional information on SBA programs can be obtained from SBA field offices
or by writing: Director, Office of Small Business Loans, U.S. SBA, 409
Third St., SW, Washington, DC 20416. </P>

<P>SBA also manages programs seeking to facilitate the provision of capital
to small companies by private sources through loan guarantees and through
provision of assistance to Small Business Investment Companies and Minority
Enterprise Small Business Investment Companies. </P>

<P><A NAME="7.3"></A>
<HR></P>

<H3>Individual Investors (Angels) </H3>

<P>Entrepreneurs seeking to raise from $100,00 to $1,000,000 for ventures
that are unlikely to be publicly held or acquired by a larger firm within
five to ten years will seldom attract the interest of professional venture
investors. These entrepreneurs should turn their attention to an invisible
segment of the risk capital market - individual investors, sometimes alluded
to as &quot;angels.&quot; Angels are a diverse and dispersed population
of individuals of means, many of whom have created their own successful
ventures. By providing seed capital for inventors and start-up firms, and
equity financing for established small firms, angels fill a void in the
institutional-risk capital market. It is estimated that angels finance
as many as 25,000 ventures per year, many of them high-tech start-ups.
</P>

<P>Angels require rewards commensurate with the risks they take. These
rewards can be monetary or &quot;psychic.&quot; As a result, an angel may
demand less equity than professional venture capitalists. But angels are
sophisticated investors. They look for competent management; they seldom
invest in the absence of a documented business plan; and they want to know
when and how they can cash in their chips. </P>

<P>Most angels make their own investment decisions. They usually invest
in technologies or markets with which they are familiar and in companies
which are close to home, typically within a day's drive. They like to stay
in touch with ventures they finance, often providing invaluable guidance.
They typically require a business plan prior to investing. </P>

<P>Finding the first angel is tough. The second and third come more easily.
Angels tend to be linked by an informal network of friends and business
associates, frequently sharing investment opportunities. </P>

<P><A NAME="7.4"></A>
<HR></P>

<H3>Research And Development Limited Partnerships </H3>

<P>Research and development limited partnerships (RDLPs) are attractive
for many companies because they offer a means for raising funds which do
not require diluting equity or increasing debt. What is sold through the
RDLP are rights in patents and technology resulting from a specific R&amp;D
project or set of projects. </P>

<P>Investors find RDLPs attractive as they use the tax advantages associated
with limited partnerships to reduce their risk and provide deductions that
can be used to offset other taxable income. The tax advantages stem from
the ability of limited partners to take the standard tax preferences for
R&amp;D to offset costs associated with R&amp;D. </P>

<P>Investors in an RDLP only reap substantial financial rewards if the
R&amp;D results in a successfully commercialized product. Accordingly,
RDLPs are commonly used only for applied research and development of products
with good market potential. </P>

<P>The RDLP consists of a General Partner, who typically sets up and manages
the partnership, and a set of limited partners who provide the funds utilized
by the partnership. RDLPs may be formed by companies, individuals, or government
or non-profit agencies. Many of the largest RDLPs have been formed by investment
bankers. Where syndication of the partnership by an investment banker has
taken place prior to the selection of projects for funding, the RDLP is
referred to as a blind pool. </P>

<P>As a legal entity, the RDLP has four major responsibilities: </P>

<OL>
<LI>Identify a potential product or process that can be commercially viable
if the R&amp;D succeeds. The General Partner must identify this need and
contract with users to sell or license the R&amp;D results. If the General
Partner can obtain contracts contingent only on meeting cost and performance
specifications, an assured market can be obtained prior to the initiation
of R&amp;D. </LI>

<LI>Obtain R&amp;D services. The General Partner seeks these services from
the most qualified, cost-efficient source in order to maximize the profitability
of the RDLP. The General Partner may seek to license existing technology
(for example federal agency technology) as part of the R&amp;D project.
</LI>

<LI>Raise funds through syndication. The two key components of this process
are preparation of the RDLP prospectus and marketing. The prospectus describes
the technical, financial, managerial, marketing, and tax aspects of the
project in sufficient detail to enable investors to make informed decisions
about the project's merit and risk. Depending on the size of the syndication
and the procedures utilized, the General Partner may have to file information
with state and federal securities agencies. </LI>

<LI>Ensure the successful commercialization of the R&amp;D results. Commercialization
may involve manufacturing and marketing a product, licensing technology,
or a total sale of the results. Where a company is establishing the RDLP,
it may serve as General Partner, provide partial funding as a limited partner,
and contract with itself for provision of R&amp;D. In such a situation,
the company acts in four legally distinct roles: independent business,
General Partner of the RDLP, investor, and contractor to the RDLP. Each
role has distinct legal responsibilities which must be met and the company
must treat all transactions associated with the RDLP as bona fide arms-length
transactions. Since the fiduciary relationship with the limited partners
involved in acting as a General Partner may conflict with the company's
desire to obtain R&amp;D funding, extreme caution and careful planning
are vital for use of this financial mechanism. For example, criteria for
the termination of a project should be well thought out in advance. Buyout
provisions, under which the company -- acting as General Partner -- can
buy out the limited partners and regain all rights in the R&amp;D results,
are another example of a critical area demanding careful consideration.

<H3>Venture Capital Companies </H3>

<P>Venture capital firms generally provide capital in exchange for equity
in a company. They generate their own profits by investing in firms they
believe can rapidly increase sales and generate substantial profits, thereby
creating long-term capital gains. </P>

<P>Most venture capital firms are interested in investment projects requiring
an investment of $250,000 to $1,500,000. Projects requiring under $250,000
are of limited interest because of the high cost of investigation and administration.
The typical venture capital firm receives over 1,000 proposals a year.
Probably 90% of these will be rejected quickly because they do not fit
the established geographic, technical, or market area policies of the firm
-- or because they have been poorly prepared. The remaining 10% are investigated
with care. A common rule-of- thumb is that a venture capitalist will look
for three to five times their investment in five or seven years. Another
common-rule-of thumb is that about one in ten investments will pay off
significantly. </P>

<P>The percentage of equity received by a venture capitalist depends on
the amount of money provided, the success and growth of the business, and
the anticipated investment return. It can range from perhaps 10% in the
case of an established, profitable company to as much as 80% or 90% for
startups or financially troubled firms. </P>

<P>Most venture firms, at least initially, do not want a position of more
than 30% to 40% because they want the owner to have an incentive to keep
building the business. If additional financing is required to support business
growth, the outsider's stake may exceed 50%; but investors realize that
small business owner-managers can lose their entrepreneurial zeal under
those circumstances. In the final analysis, however, the venture firm,
regardless of its percentage of ownership, wants to leave control in the
hands of the company's managers because it is really investing in that
management team in the first place. </P>

<P>Most venture capital firms determine the ratio of funds provided to
equity requested by comparing the present financial worth of the contributions
made by each of the parties to the agreement. The present value of the
contribution by the owner of a startup or financially troubled company
is obviously rated low. Often this ratio is estimated as just the existing
value of his or her idea and the competitive costs of the owner's time.
The contribution by the owners of a thriving business is valued much higher.
Generally, it is capitalized at a multiple of the current earnings and/or
net worth. </P>

<P>Note that venture capital firms generally provide capital in exchange
for stock. The term &quot;generally&quot; is used because venture leasing
is also an option. In venture leasing, the leasing company conducts a venture-type
analysis of a company's potential. Based on the results, the lessor takes
warrants or some other type of equity investment in exchange for equipment,
facilities, and other assets. The result is a mixed investment vehicle
similar to a debt-with-warrants investment. Deals range up to $2 to $3
million. </P>

<P>In the 1990s, the nature of venture capital investments has changed
from earlier years. As many observers have noted, the tendency towards
more freely-flowing money found in the early and mid-1980's is gone. Today,
tougher criteria are applied and a greater orientation towards investing
in the traditional bottom line and track record of key managers takes place.
</P>

<P>According to venture capitalists, several criteria are used in making
investment decisions. These are listed in their approximate order of importance.
</P>

<OL>
<LI>The track record of the company's key people. While a previously successful
CEO is a major plus for a company seeking venture capital, no individual
by him- or herself is enough. Venture capital firms usually require that
the company under consideration have a complete management team. Each of
the important functional areas (product design, marketing, production,
finance, and control) must be under the direction of a trained, experienced
member of the group. Responsibilities must be clearly assigned. </LI>

<LI>Commitment of key people to the selling product. Venture capitalists
know that without sales, companies die. Top management should be dedicated
to moving the company from research into product sales. </LI>

<LI>Distinctive strategic element that characterizes the firm. This distinctive
element may be a new product feature, manufacturing process, market niche,
or a particular management skill or technical competence. But it must exist
and it must provide a competitive advantage. </LI>

<LI>A core technology rather than a single product. A company built around
a technology rather than a product has flexibility. By spinning a series
of products out from the technology, it can have more than one shot at
successful market introduction, reducing the investors risk. Typically
the core technology depends on cutting-edge science and engineering. If
not, there is often a set of special insights into how to integrate off-the-shelf
and emerging technology. </LI>

<LI>Strong intellectual property protection. If the core technology cannot
be protected, the ability of a company to exploit its technology in the
market is reduced as imitators can rush in. </LI>

<LI>The type and size of targeted markets. Most venture capitalists are
interested in markets in the $50 to $100 million range -- large enough
to allow for substantial growth, yet small enough to not look too attractive
to Fortune 500 companies. Furthermore, these markets should not be crowded
or dominated by one or two companies with strong ties to customers, thereby
creating excessive barriers to entry. </LI>

<LI>The amount of money that will be needed to bring the company to break-even
(when revenues equal losses) and profitability. Most venture capitalists
will not be willing to bear alone all the costs of funding a company from
startup through to break-even. They will examine the company's strategy
for leveraging their investment with corporate partnering or other financial
support. </LI>
</OL>

<P>Many types of venture capital firms can be found, including: </P>

<UL>
<LI>Traditional partnerships -- which are often established by wealthy
families to aggressively manage a portion of their funds by investing in
small companies. </LI>

<LI>Professionally managed pools -- which are made up of institutional
money and which operate like the traditional partnerships. </LI>

<LI>Investment banking firms -- which usually trade in more established
securities, but occasionally form investor syndicates for venture proposals.
</LI>

<LI>Insurance companies -- which often have required a portion of equity
as a condition of their loans to smaller companies as protection against
inflation. </LI>

<LI>Manufacturing companies -- which occasionally look at investing in
smaller companies as a means of supplementing their R&amp;D programs. (Some
&quot;Fortune 500&quot; corporations have venture capital operations to
help keep them abreast of technological innovations). </LI>

<LI>Small Business Investment Corporations (SBIC's) -- which are licensed
by the Small Business Administration (SBA) and which may provide management
assistance as well as venture capital. (When dealing with SBIC's, the small
business owner-manager should initially determine if the SBIC is primarily
interested in an equity position, as venture capital, or merely in long-term
lending on a fully secured basis.) </LI>
</UL>

<P><A NAME="7.6"></A>
<HR></P>

<H3>Banks </H3>

<P>Debt is often the first thought of a company needing outside funding.
In general, bank loans are possible for companies with established records
of solid revenues and profits, and with sufficient assets to secure the
loan. However, companies seeking bank loans should be aware that banks,
like other businesses are influenced by a number of factors in making their
loans. Among these are state and federal regulations, accounting and marketing
considerations, and the general financial state of the institution's portfolio.
It may not be sufficient merely to deal with that bank where your company
keeps its deposits and to have a viable business plan. </P>

<P><A NAME="7.7"></A>
<HR></P>

<H3>Private Placements </H3>

<P>Private placements are sales of stock or bonds to a small group of highly
sophisticated investors. These placements are often handled by investment
bankers who must comply with various state and federal securities laws.
In general, the costs of a private placement mean that deals under $5 million
are not made. </P>

<P>Private placements are almost never used for start-ups. Investors tend
to prefer companies with a solid track record in revenues, cash flow, and
earnings and with a good likelihood that this track record can be maintained.
As a result, private placements work best for mature companies in relatively
stable industries with a low risk of rapid product obsolescence. Other
factors that come into consideration are proven management, high quality
management information and inventory control systems, strong marketing
and merchandising, and solid accounting and legal advisors. </P>

<P><A NAME="7.8"></A>
<HR></P>

<H3>Corporate Partnering </H3>

<P>Teaming with a mid- or large-size company is an increasingly common
source of outside investment for small high-technology companies. Typically,
the larger partner is seeking products or market share. Deals involving
process technology are less common, but can take place where the process
economics, in comparison with the existing means of production, are very
compelling. </P>

<P>Experience suggests partnering works best where the smaller firm is
seeking access to markets in addition to any financial or in-kind resources
required to complete product development. The best partners are companies
who can provide supplemental capabilities that the small company does not
have nor does it have the desire to develop. These may be in R&amp;D, manufacturing,
distribution, marketing and sales, or servicing the product. </P>

<P>A major advantage of partnering is the flexibility of these strategic
alliances. Partnerships can be structured as equity investments, subordinated
debt, equipment leases, advanced payments for licensing, and so forth.
Money only may be provided by the larger partner. Alternatively, space,
equipment, personnel or all of these in combination with money may be provided.
</P>

<P>In exploring corporate partnerships, it is vital that all participants
be clear about each others goals. In general, large companies are seeking
technology that can meet a present or near-term market need and the smaller
partner must be willing to focus on bringing its technology to fruition
on schedule. Often a major corporation will want to acquire the smaller
firm if the product is successful. </P>

<P>Information useful for evaluating potential partnerships includes: </P>

<UL>
<LI>Partner's relevant experience </LI>

<LI>Partner's R&amp;D programs and technology base </LI>

<LI>Partner's staff, equipment, and other research capability </LI>

<LI>Partner's staff, equipment and other manufacturing capability </LI>

<LI>Partner's knowledge of technology and the market in which the application
will occur </LI>

<LI>Partner's sales, distribution, and service capabilities </LI>

<LI>Priority your project will have for Partner </LI>

<LI>Resources to be devoted to your project by Partner </LI>

<LI>Structure of similar alliances formed by Partner </LI>

<LI>Revenues and profitability of similar alliances formed by Partner </LI>
</UL>

<P>Firms seeking corporate partnerships should be aware that such alliances
can take as much time and effort to conclude as any other means of outside
investment. In this context, before approaching larger corporations, it
often helps to conduct market research on potential partners to identify
those companies with appropriate needs and a willingness to enter into
strategic alliances. </P>

<P><BR>
</P>
</UL>

<P>Internet is as a low cost medium for transmitting and obtaining information.
As such, it is a competing technology for telephones, mail and delivery
services, television, radio, and so forth. <BR>
</P>

<P>Internet is a computer network. The idea of a network is familiar to
us all. Most networks we know are collections of smaller networks. The
highway system is made up of many road networks: toll-ways, interstate,
state highways, city streets and county roads. The power grid is a network
of local power companies, connected through occasional large public power
utilities. The telephone system is the largest network on earth, an enormous
web connecting many of the world's people. </P>

<P>Just like cars, toasters or telephones, computers can be connected to
networks. Most computer networks are called LANs (Local Area Networks)
and are usually limited to the computers in one office or one building.
The LAN allows all computers in the office to share information and resources,
and simplifies maintenance of the individual computer installations. Businesses
with more than one office often connect their office LANs together to create
WANs (Wide Area Networks). The creation of the WAN allows all of the computers
in the enterprise to share information and other resources. <BR>
</P>

<P>The Internet is just another network. A good analogy is the phone system.
You can call anyone, anywhere in the world so long as both you and the
person you are calling (1) have access to a phone and (2) those phones
are connected to national phone systems which are (3) connected to international
lines. <BR>
</P>

<P>The Internet is sometimes called the network of networks, because it
provides the link between the various LANs and WANs for those who use it.
The Internet provides a wide range of network services including: e-mail
(electronic mail and listservers, i.e. automated mail distribution systems),
document access (including access to thousands of catalogs and databases
of information and to newsgroups), file transfer (from one computer to
another), telnet (access to a remote computer as if you were connected
to a local computer or Bulletin Board System), and interactive conferences.
To access these services the appropriate tools need to be installed into
your computer. Increasingly, however, World-Wide-Web browsers, one of these
tools, are including other tools as well in order to provide an integrated
package for the customer. In this chapter we shall focus on using the Web
and e-mail. <BR>
</P>

<P>Internet relies on a series of protocols to function. Protocols are
standard practices we all agree to follow, making it possible to cooperate
without having to continually negotiate over trivial issues. Again we will
use our analogy of the interstate highway system. Even though this system
is an enormous network of highways, roads and streets that connect different
countries and states and is governed by many different systems and rules,
these road systems all share certain common protocols. The fundamental
protocol is that cars have agreed to drive on one side of an arbitrary
line painted down the middle of public roads under almost all circumstances.
Another protocol involves the use of colored lights and signs to establish
the order in which vehicles move through areas too congested to allow the
freedom of unimpeded actions. <BR>
</P>

<P>Similar protocols allow computers to operate internally, and to share
resources and exchange data with one another on LANs and on WANs. Protocols
allow modems (a device that converts a computer's digital pulse into an
analog tone that can be transmitted over a telephone line) to &quot;handshake&quot;
and negotiate the fastest speed at which information can be moved over
telephone wires, to break the information stream into packets of data,
to assess the accuracy of packet transmissions and re-send packets damaged
in transmission until they have been correctly received. The protocol that
routes data between hosts (i.e., registered computers) on the Internet
is called IP (Internet Protocol). Each computer has its own IP address
or &quot;borrows&quot; the IP address of a host server which it logs onto
by phone. <BR>
</P>

<P>If you have never used Internet a wealth of training material is available
simply by using a World Wide Web browser. (See the next section for an
overview about the Web.) An excellent overview for people with Microsoft
Windows or NT operating systems can be downloaded from the <A HREF="http://www.saecrc.org/menu/freestuf.shtml#Internet">San
Antonio Electronic Commerce Resource Center </A>at Help Download. Another
excellent overview, writing as a text file so it is accessible through
any operating system is Patrick Douglas <A HREF="ftp://ftp.seeport.com/science_education/student/internet/crispen/readme.htm">Crispen's
Roadmap for The Information Superhighway Workshop</A>. The workshop consists
of a series of lessons.<BR>

<HR></P>

<P><A NAME="I.1"></A></P>

<H2>The World Wide Web</H2>

<P>One of the most important parts of Internet is the World Wide Web, usually
referred to as the Web. The Web contains a set of documents, primarily
based on a protocol called HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol). HTTP enables
you to access documents (called Web pages) via an address scheme known
as URL (Universal Resource Locator). URL protocol is the World-Wide-Web's
address system. It guides users to a specific spot on the Internet where
information resides and transfers the files between the different systems.
It does not matter if their actual locations are in the same directory,
on the same diskette, or located on a different computer halfway around
the world, as long as you have a functioning link to the Internet. <BR>
</P>

<P>HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) is the interpreted computer language
which operates as an extension to the ASCII text file format. ASCII is
the American Standard Code for Information Exchange, a data transmission
standard for assigning seven-bit codes to 128 different elements including
the 26 letters of the alphabet in upper and lower case, the basic number
set (0-9) and punctuation marks.<BR>
</P>

<P>HTML is a subset of a larger &quot;language&quot; called SGML (Standard
Generalized Markup Language). HTML adds &quot;tags&quot; (encapsulated
within less-than ((&lt;)) and greater-than ((&gt;)) brackets) to the text
file which serve as commands and turn text between the tags into commands.
These commands format image and text &quot;links&quot; for URL address
jumps to other hypertext files (.htm or .html). We can select these links
by clicking the highlighted text (more on this in the Searching with Web
Browsers section). The program you use to find and read hypertext documents
is called a browser. As you follow one link to another, you are navigating
the Web.<BR>
</P>

<P>Information of all kinds can be found on the web. The following table
displays some kinds of the information available and the typical means
for accessing that information. <BR>

<H2><A NAME="I.2"></A>Why Use Internet<BR>
</H2>

<P>Most people use Internet as a library and telephone/mail replacement.
This is not surprising. Most new technologies are initially used in ways
patterned on previously used technology. For example, the personal computer
was initially used primarily as a fancy typewriter and calculator. In this
Chapter we will present one other way of using the Internet: as a tool
for distributed problem solving. <BR>

<H2><A NAME="I.3"></A>Using Internet as a Library</H2>

<P>There are an number of features which make Internet attractive as a
library replacement. </P>

<P>For one thing, there is a vast amount of information and data to access.
<BR>
</P>

<P>Increasingly, all Internet-based resources can be accessed via Web browsers.
Therefore, we shall focus on this gateway. <BR>
</P>

<P>The scientific literature on the Web grows by leaps and bounds. Much
of this is highly useful for literature reviews concerning proposal topics
and for finding qualified scientists and engineers who might be consultants.
For example, most university faculty will post copies of recently published
papers on their personal web sites. In addition, a surprising number of
journals are available on-line. (For a discussion of on-line journals and
references to journals and source directories see<I>: &quot;A Survey Of
STM Online Journals 1990-95: The Calm Before the Storm</I>,&quot; by Steve
Hitchcock, Leslie Carr and Wendy Hall of the <A HREF="http://journals.ecs.soton.ac.uk/survey/survey.html">Multimedia
Research Group</A>, University of Southampton.)</P>

<P>A wealth of federal government information also is accessible. <I><A HREF="http://www.fedworld.gov/">FedWorld</A>
Information Network</I> is the basic gateway to all publicly accessible
federal on-line resources. Managed by the National Technical Information
Service, Technology Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce. <BR>
</P>

<P>The Web can be viewed as a collection of specialized libraries. Each
library exists as a hypertext linked set of pages in hyperspace. For example,
one such library would be information on R&amp;D funding opportunities.
A starting point for this library is this manual, the <I><A HREF="http://www.seeport.com/R&DBOOK/RDGUIDE.HTM">NSF
Small Business Guide to Federal R&amp;D Funding Opportunities</A></I>,
especially the sections on agency R&amp;D funding priorities and points
of contact. This document is available on-line at Foresight's Seeport web
site, http://www.seeport.com. Another important page is the <A HREF="http://web.fie.com/htdoc/fed/all/any/any/menu/any/index.htm"><I>FEDIX</I>
index</A>. <I>FEDIX</I> is a free one-stop information retrieval service
of federal opportunities for the education and research communities. Key
federal agencies support <I>FEDIX</I> under a cooperative agreement from
the Department of Energy. <BR>
</P>

<P>Unfortunately, as a library, the Web also has a number of problems.
The information found on the Web is often dirty, that is, it may not be
accurate, current, or checked for typographical and other errors. Indeed,
it is often not clear who is the source of the information or how the validity
of the information was confirmed. Web pages and <A HREF="http://www.neosoft.com/internet/paml/index.html">newsgroup/listserver
</A>postings in particular are black boxes when it comes to quality assurance.
As Joe Breskin of our company once put it: &quot;You can be 100% positive
that the person on the other end actually is a scientist of a very precocious
13 year old.&quot; <BR>
</P>

<P>A further problem is that relevant information is often hard to find.
Our experience indicates that <A HREF="http://altavista.digital.com/"><I>Alta
Vista</I> </A>is probably the best search engine for scientific information
on the Web. However, no search engine has complete coverage of the Web,
let alone of other Internet modes such as FTP. One solution is to use a
variety of search engines. Both free and fee-for-service engines exist.
You can also use an artificial intelligence based meta-search engine tool.
<I><A HREF="http://www.metacrawler.com/">Metacrawler</A></I>, by Oren Etzioni
and his colleagues at the University of Washington, retrives site references
by searching several several search engines at once. Etzioni refers to
it as a carnivore in a world of Web grazing herbivores. <BR>

<HR></P>

<H3><A NAME="I.4"></A>Searching </H3>

<P>There are two primary categories of tools for locating resources on
the Internet: subject catalogs and search engines. <BR>
</P>

<P>Subject catalogs are Web accessible documents that maintains lists of
links organized by their content. They are easy to use. You simply look
under the most appropriate topic in the catalog. Hypertext links lead from
the catalog to web pages or other Internet documents of potential interest<BR>
</P>

<P>Search engines use large databases of indexed entries. Each entry represents
a specific web page or other Internet resource. A structured query of the
data base allows the user to select documents based on certain words, phrases,
or patterns within those documents. The terms entered in the query are
called keywords. The search engine then examines the database for documents
that match or are related to the user's criteria, and returns appropriate
documents to the user. The data bases are built by software, sometimes
called web spiders, which automatically travel cyberspace examining and
indexing documents, that is, entering it into the database using words
extracted from the title or text. Spiders use links in documents to find
pointers to other documents that haven't been indexed yet.<BR>
</P>

<P>Your ability to locate Internet resources of interest with a search
engines is dramatically increased if you approach Internet searching systematically.
The following chart provides a basic overview of how to search.<BR>
</P>

<CENTER><P><IMG SRC="IMG00002.GIF" HEIGHT=474 WIDTH=322><BR>
</P></CENTER>

<P>Probably the most crucial step is defining the search strategy and search
terms. The search strategy consists of a set of terms and the order and
logic you will use to construct the actual search phrase. The search phrase
is what you type into the search engine. <BR>
</P>

<P>When searching, you want to get a large number of hits and winnow those
down to a manageable size through the addition of more terms. Additional
terms may require complicated logic. The reason for this process is that
it is easier to make a search phrase more complicated than more simple.
The cost of making a type or other mistake is less. For example, a search
may crash if you do not balance out opening and closing parentheses. <BR>
</P>

<P>As you engage in this winnowing process you will reach a point where
you have less than 200 hits. Our experience is that this is the maximum
number of hits you can scan and review in a reasonable amount of time.
<BR>
</P>

<P>Search strategies should only be designed after<I> </I>reading the instructions
concerning the logic the engine can support. Most engines will support
some kind of Boolean logic, but how the logic must be written often differs.
<BR>
</P>

<P>The terms used to construct the search are often called <I>keyword<B>s</B></I>.
A few search engines can only use specific keywords for searching. Catalogs
typically have this constraint, though some allow open text searching of
their database. <BR>
</P>

<P>If any word can be used for searching, it helps to construct a <I>term
tree</I>. A term tree consists of a branching structure from a general
concept to more specific ones. Depending on the number of hits you are
receiving, you can move up and down the tree to open or narrow the search.
The following chart provides a very simple term tree for searching for
information about computer monitors. If you were interested in finding
manufacturers of Backlit Liquid Crystal Displays you might begin by searching
on that phrase. If you did not get enough hits to find the pages you want,
you would move up the tree to higher levels of generality (first Liquid
Crystal Displays, then Displays). <BR>
</P>

<P>A second issue in searching is to think about the kinds of sites and
pages or interest. For &quot;objective&quot; evaluations of competing technologies
(e.g., liquid crystal displays and cathode ray tubes) you might want to
attempt to restrict your search to government and university sites. Thus,
you would reject any hits whose URL address did not include either gov
or edu. Similarly, you might be interested in more scholarly papers on
a topic. In this case you might seek pages which had terms like &quot;abstract&quot;
or &quot;table of contents' (or toc or index) in their URL address or description.
<BR>
</P>

<P>A third issue to consider is whether the information on the pages you
find is likely to be accurate, current, and checked for typographical and
other errors. There is a lot of garbage out there in cyberspace. We recommend
thinking about the motivations of the people providing the site. Our experience
is the best sites tend to be ones where steady funding exists to support
the site. Thus, government-funded sites tend to have pretty clean information,
as do university sites. Government-funded sites include both those established
by federal and state agencies and those maintained under contract. Corporate
sites primarily focused on promotion are most clean with respect to product
and service information, although they will have a clear bias that their
stuff is worthwhile.<BR>

<P>The <A HREF="http://www.seeport.com/SBIR/catalog.htm">NSF SBIR Internet
Card Catalog</A> is the on-line companion to this document. Found at it
provides detailed information on hundreds of sites useful for proposal
preparation, conducting research, and commercialization, including finding
Phase III partners. Modeled on the library card catalog, unlike a search
engine or general Internet catalog (e.g. Yahoo), the <I>SBIR Internet Card
Catalog</I> contains information on the specific content of the site, the
tools available for navigating the site, how the accuracy and currency
of the information it contains is ensured, and an assessment of the utility
of the site for SBIR related activities. Information has been checked through
direct contact with the webmaster for the site. Hypertext links allow you

<H2><A NAME="I.6"></A>Using Internet as a Telephone/Mail System</H2>

<H3>The Experience of Communicating over Internet</H3>

<P>In order to use Internet effectively for interpersonal communications,
it helps to reflect for a moment on what makes Internet different from
more traditional modes of communicating. One of the most significant differences
is that most current Internet modes dramatically reduce the number of dimensions
of sensory information you have concerning the person with whom you are
communicating. <BR>
</P>

<P>The more dimensions of sensory information involved in an interaction
between people, the more personality is part of the interaction. Face-to-face
discussions for business require attention to how you look, how your breath
smells, and so forth. When you meet your counterparts, you take time to
say hello and establish a rapport before settling down to business. <BR>
</P>

<P>Phone conversations eliminate visual, smell, and all other sensory data
except sound. The artifact required for audio communication (that is, talking
through the phone) seems to permit moving much more rapidly to the point
of the conversation. In effect, e-mail even removes the audio quality of
your voice. All that remains is the way you use language, that is, the
structure of the message displayed on another's screen. This &quot;depersonalization&quot;
enables dispensing with all of the superficial pleasantries which accompany
more traditional modes of interaction without insulting your counterpart.
<BR>
</P>

<P>This depersonalized quality of most business e-mail, suggests where
e-mail can best be used. It works very well for targeted requests for information,
for conveying advice in response to a question from another, and to conveying
information where both participants to the exchange understand what the
information means and how it is to be used. Alternatively, e-mail is a
poor way to motivate a distant worker or subcontractor. <BR>
</P>

<P>It helps to consider the &quot;personality&quot; dimension when using
Internet. As more interaction is required either to convey emotional/motivational
messages or to explore and explain information and concepts (i.e. distance
learning); tools other than e-mail may be required. Within the next few
years, on-line real-time conferencing with video and audio images will
become increasingly common. Yet, such capabilities will come with strong
bandwidth requirements. Real time interactive communication requires dedicated
hardware and software to work effectively. The best &quot;white boards&quot;
and other interactive groupware run slow without at least ISDN lines. Still,
Internet conferencing and white board program which run at slower speeds
are now commercially available. These are useful for interactively marking
up draft proposals and other documents if both participants have a second
phone line enabling voice discussions during the process. <BR>
</P>

<P>When communicating by e-mail, remember that there is typically a time
lag in the communications. First, it takes time for messages to travel
through clogged channels. Second, participants in the discussion can be
anywhere in the world and thus in any time zone. <BR>

<HR></P>

<H3><A NAME="I.7"></A>Electronic Commerce</H3>

<P>Probably the most important development for small high technology businesses
is the emergence of electronic commerce. Like any other good, information
has costs for its production, distribution, and maintenance. The long range
costs of production can be cut by operating with economies of scale. Just
how large an operation has to be to attain economies of scale depends on
the production technology being used. What Internet has done is dramatically
drive down the Minimum Efficient Scale for the production and distribution
of information. <BR>
</P>

<P>This drop in Minimum Efficient Scale means that even a small company
can distribute and/or coordinate its operations in new ways. Electronic
product and process exchange enable new cooperative relationships between
small firms or small and large firms. <BR>
</P>

<P>At the heart of electronic commerce is a series of protocols for electronic
data interchange (EDI). EDI is the computer-to-computer exchange of business
documents in a standard electronic format. Rather than mail or fax purchase
orders, invoices, and the like, companies engaged in EDI, called trading
partners, transmit electronic versions. <BR>
</P>

<P>There are currently several on-going demonstrations for communicating
research administration data electronically to the federal government.
These include the already mentioned National Science Foundation's FastLane
project, NIH's Edison system for technology transfer and the government-wide
electronic research administration demonstration, NewERA. For more information
see <A HREF="http://web.fie.com/web/era/index.htm"><I>FEDIX's </I>Electronic
Research Administration</A><I> </I>page. <BR>
</P>

<P>The Department of Defense has its own electronic commerce initiative
for electronic data interchange (EDI). For additional information visit

Antonio Electronic Commerce Resource Center</A>. <BR>

<HR></P>

<H2><A NAME="I.8"></A>Using Internet for Distributed Problem Solving</H2>

<P>Internet can also be used as a tool for developing and coordinating
distributed work groups working on common problems. This feature makes
it especially attractive for SBIR related activities. <BR>
</P>

<P>As we use the term, work groups are ad hoc teams established to meet
predefined objectives. Certain tasks lend themselves to completion through
distributed work groups. Such tasks have three features which make it possible
for the work to be completed by people in different physical locations:
<BR>
</P>

<OL>
<LI>A clear objective for the activity can be stated and objective criteria
established for determining if the object is being attained or not. </LI>

<LI>The task is limited in duration and can be rigorously scheduled. </LI>

<LI>The task does not require a lot of informal interaction among group
members. Rather, each participant can work on his or her own and communicate
the results of the work to others in time for them to use it as required.
</LI>
</OL>

<P>
<HR></P>

<H3><A NAME="I.9"></A>Structuring the Group</H3>

<P>The major difference between distributed work groups and ones based
in a single location is that the coordination and management cannot be
accomplished by walking down the hall and talking with someone. Thus, a
formal management structure is imperative. We find an effective management
structure for distributed work groups can be built using three elements;
roles, tasks, and information flows. <BR>
</P>

<P>Just what roles are required reflects the reason for setting up the
work group in the first place. A group for product design will look different
from a group for proposal preparation. <BR>
</P>

<P>Roles have two components: function and authority. Function is the basic
area of activity the person holding the role is supposed to be conducting
to enable the group to meet its objective(s). Authority is the ability
to make a decision and expect others to follow it. <BR>
</P>

<P>The work and authority relationships between all other individuals needs
to be defined in advance. A crucial role is group leader. Someone must
be in charge and have the authority to make decisions immediately. Otherwise
long distance communication problems can cause nightmares should a coordination
problem emerge. <BR>
</P>

<P>Once the roles required have been identified, the next step is to clearly
define the specific tasks the group is to accomplish. Making a project
scheduling chart for the major tasks the group must perform is a good way
to accomplish this task. Any commercial project scheduling software will
work. <BR>
</P>

<P>For each task, next sketch the flows of information which must go between
group members and the sequence which messages must have. (Flow charting
software is helpful here.) Because information is flowing without face-to-face
contact, and usually without any voice contact, information flow cannot
be taken for granted. Thus, each set of tasks has a corresponding &quot;information
model.&quot; <BR>
</P>

<P>The information flows should have two components; The first component
is a channel. How will the information physically be moved. Will it be
attached to e-mail, accessible over FTP, available on a web site, or something
else (like US Mail)? Second, (i) what specific information must and may
flow through the channel and (ii) what information is forbidden or is discouraged.
This component can be referred to as the permissibility of the information.
Permissibility is related to the function of the information. The function
will also determine how each person receiving information is supposed to
respond. <BR>
</P>

<P>There is no reason to assume that each member of the work group will
require the same information, although that may be the case. There may
be no harm in providing complete information to each person so long as
everyone is clear what information to which they must respond and what
types of responses are desired. For example, is a member of a proposal
team receiving a draft section as a &quot;for your information&quot; or
for a detailed critique. <BR>
</P>

<P>It helps to have a specific person with authority over each channel.
That person is responsible for defining the specific character of the messages
which flow in the channel and for facilitating the quality of information
(i.e., its accuracy, timeliness, utility) flowing in the channel. <BR>
</P>

<P>Roles, tasks, and information flows provide the basic structure for
simple distributed work groups. Management becomes a matter of regularly
checking to ensure people are honoring their roles, completing tasks on
time with the desired results, and sending and responding to information
appropriately. <BR>

<HR></P>

<H3><A NAME="I.10"></A>Finding People to Work With</H3>

<P>The feasibility of working with people in distributed locations means
that it is possible to include people on teams with whom you might never
otherwise have worked. Finding the best possible people for a work group
is, however, itself a challenging problem. The traditional method is to
contact a group of five to seven experts in the field of interest and ask
them for a couple of recommendations. Those individuals recommended by
the most experts are probably the best people with whom to work. <BR>
</P>

<P>This method begs a fundamental question: How do you find the experts
to ask about other experts? We know certain institutional positions are
typically associated with expertise. Such positions include government
program managers, academic faculty and directors of university-based centers,
and technical experts in associations. Finding these people is straightforward
with the aid of Web search engines.<BR>
</P>

<P>First search on terms relevant for the area in which you are looking
for experts. Once you locate relevant sites, browse them and follow the
most plausible links to other pages of interest. For example, supposed
you were looking for help with technology transfer. A search on technology
transfer would lead to you to the National Technology Transfer Institute,
a government funded university-based center. It's <A HREF="http://www.nttc.edu/gov/other/tech.html">Technology
Transfer Links</A>page at contains links to academic, non-profit, and commercial
consultants. <BR>
</P>

<P>It also useful is to monitor a relevant listserver, newsgroup, or discussion
group. In selecting the listserver or group it is important to consider
the kinds of discussion and participants which are most relevant for locating
the experts you want. <BR>

<HR></P>

<H3><A NAME="I.11"></A>Building Tools for Passing Information</H3>

<P>Because all work group members are likely to already have commercial
word processing and spreadsheet software, it is possible to use this software
to construct the basic templates you need for most work group activities.
There is far to much hype about expensive and complicated programs like
Lotus Notes which, while excellent, are overkill for most SBIR-related
tasks required by small firms. <BR>
</P>

<P>Establishing Internet-based message templates for common SBIR related
tasks need not be complicated The forms creation and outlining capabilities
of word processors and spreadsheets can be used to quickly make templates
for most messages which will flow between group members. <BR>
</P>

<P>If a flow requires routing the same message through several people,
it is imperative to include a header with each message in the channel.
The header provides a place for people to indicate they have read the document
prior to passing it along. (Remember the old routing slips on paper. They
were useful.) <BR>
</P>

<P>Templates are recommended as a way of encouraging work group members
to include only important data in each message. As discussed above, a great
advantage of Internet based communication is that it can brief. Work group
members need to understand that messages within the channels have a strictly
instrumental function. They are there only to move the task forward towards
completion. All other communication should go through e-mail outside the
channels. <BR>
</P>

<P>Depending on the kind of software on each person's computer, attention
will have to be paid to file formatting. We have found that simply formats
like Rich Text File (RTF) for word processors and Lotus 1-2-3 spreadsheets
can be read by almost any commercial package. Thus, if you are working
with people who have widely divergent software, export files into these
simpler formats before attaching them to e-mails or uploading them onto
an FTP site. <BR>
</P>

<P>Move the forms around as attachments to e-mail or, if to large, through
an FTP site.<BR>
</P>

<P>A factor to remember is that binary files (like word processing documents
with their formatting intact) are encoded prior to transmission by e-mail.
Software running under most Microsoft operating systems will use Mime,
Apple systems will use BinHex, and UNIX and cc;Mail will use Uuencode to
encode attachments. Commercially purchased e-mail packages will commonly
decipher and apply the correct decoding scheme, but you do find problems
from time to time. <BR>
</P>

<P>A second factor to remember is that multiple versions of the same document
can pass each other in cyberspace as messages. Fortunately, version control
problems can be avoided with simple methods. On word processing documents,
for example, a simple version control method is to have each recipient
use a different color for annotations and revisions. Only the primary author
of the document is given the authority to accept and remove revisions and
annotation. Just who is the primary author may change over time, but it
is always just one person. <BR>

This is the introduction to the internet training manual.
There are two links at the bottom of this page.
The first link leads back to the table of contents.  The second link leads to the
next section of the manual.  The introduction begins here.</font>
<P>INTRODUCTION.
<P>WHAT IS A COMPUTER NETWORK?
<P>BASIC CONCEPTS.
<P>The idea of a network is familiar to us all. Most networks we know are collections of smaller networks.
 The highway system is made up of many road networks: toll-ways, interstate, state highways, city streets and
 county roads.  The power grid is a network of local power companies, connected through occasional large public
 power utilities.  The telephone system is the largest network on earth, an enormous web connecting many 
of the world's people.  
<P>Just like cars, toasters or telephones, computers can be connected to
networks.  Most computer networks are called LANs (Local Area Networks) and are
usually limited to the computers in one office or one building.  The LAN allows
all computers in the office to share information and resources, and simplifies
maintenance of the individual computer installations.  Businesses with more than
one office often connect their office LANs together to create WANs (Wide Area
Networks).  The creation of the WAN allows all of the computers in the
enterprise to share information and other resources. 
<P>WHAT IS THE INTERNET.
<P>The Internet is literally a giant mass of cables and computers, a network. 
A good analogy is the phone system.  You can call anyone, anywhere in the world,
so long as both you and the person you are calling satisfy these requirements:
(1,) you both have access to a phone, (2,) those phones are connected to national
phone systems, which are (3,) connected to international lines.  
<P>The Internet is sometimes called the network of networks, because it
provides the link between the various LANs and WANs for those who use it.  The
Internet provides a wide range of network services including: e-mail (electronic
mail and listservers, i.e. automated mail distribution systems), document access
(including access to thousands of catalogs and databases of information and to
newsgroups), file transfer (from one computer to another), news reports, telnet
(access to a remote computer as if you were connected to a local computer or
Bulletin Board System), and interactive conferences.  To access these services
the appropriate tools need to be installed into your computer.  Increasingly,
however, World-Wide-Web browsers, one of these tools, are including other tools
as well in order to provide an integrated package for the customer. 
<P>For this project, two tools have been installed on your computer provided by
Foresight: a web browser and dedicated e-mail software. 
<P>PROTOCOLS for INTERNET USE.
<P>Protocols are standard practices we all agree to follow, making it possible
to cooperate without having to continually negotiate over trivial issues.  Again
we will use our analogy of the interstate highway system.  Even though this
system is an enormous network of highways, roads and streets that connect
different countries and states and is governed by many different systems and
rules, these road systems all share certain common protocols.  The fundamental
protocol is that cars have agreed to drive on one side of an arbitrary line
painted down the middle of public roads under almost all circumstances.  Another
protocol involves the use of colored lights and signs to establish the order in
which vehicles move through areas too congested to allow the freedom of
unimpeded actions.  
<P>Similar protocols allow computers to operate internally, and to share
resources and exchange data with one another on LANs and on WANs.  Protocols
allow modems (a device that converts a computer's digital pulse into an analog
tone that can be transmitted over a telephone line) to &quot;handshake&quot; and
negotiate the fastest speed at which information can be moved over telephone
wires, to break the information stream into packets of data, to assess the
accuracy of packet transmissions and re-send packets damaged in transmission
until they have been correctly received.  The protocol that routes data between
hosts (i.e., registered computers) on the Internet is called IP (Internet
Protocol).  Each computer has its own IP address or &quot;borrows&quot; the IP
address of a host server which it logs onto by phone. 
<P>WHAT IS THE WORLD WIDE WEB.
<P>The World-Wide-Web is the gateway into an interactive, catalogued information system, 
it is also much more.  The Web contains a set of documents, primarily based on a protocol called 
HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol).  HTTP enables you to access documents (called Web pages)
 via an address scheme known as URL (Universal Resource Locator). URL protocol is the World-Wide-Web's
 address system.  It guides users to a specific spot on the Internet where information resides and transfers the files 
between the different systems.  It does not matter if their actual locations are in the same directory, on the same 
diskette, or located on a different computer halfway around the world, as long as you have a functioning link
 to the Internet. 
<P>HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) is the interpreted computer language that
operates as an extension to the ASCII (see below) text file format.  HTML is a
subset of a larger &quot;language&quot; called SGML (Standard Generalized Markup
Language).  HTML adds &quot;tags&quot; (encapsulated within less-than ((&lt;))
and greater-than ((&gt;)) brackets) to the text file which serve as commands and
turn text between the tags into commands.  These commands format image and text
&quot;links&quot; for URL address jumps to other hypertext files (.htm or
.html).  We can select these links by clicking the highlighted text (more on
this in the Searching with Web Browsers section).  The program you use to find
and read hypertext documents is called a browser.  As you follow one link to
another, you are navigating the Web.
<P>(ASCII is the American Standard Code for Information Exchange, a data
transmission standard for assigning seven-bit codes to 128 different elements
including the 26 letters of the alphabet in upper and lower case, the basic
number set (0-9), and punctuation marks).  (Fahey, page 16).
<P>The Approach of this Project on the Internet.
<P>E-MAIL, the WORLD WIDE WEB, NEWSGROUPS, and LISTSERVERS:
<P>For our research purposes we will be corresponding with mentors through
e-mail, searching for relative documents on the World Wide Web, reading articles
relative to our project in Newsgroups and corresponding with all members of the
project team.<BR>

<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" text = "#000000" LINK="#0000FF" vlink = "#008F93">
<font color = "#FFFFFF"> There are two links at the bottom of this page.
  The first leads back to the table of contents.
The second leads on to the next chapter.  The text of this chapter begins here.<BR></font>
<P>E-MAIL.
<P>Electronic mail applications allow you to send and receive mail
electronically over the Internet.  This is especially useful for research as we
are able to interact with mentors and other scientists working on similar
projects, get their opinions on our work or ask questions.
<P>How to use e-mail (EUDORA):
<P>To open your e-mail box, double click the e-mail icon on your computer
screen (located in Program Manager).
<P>Receiving messages: (As written in the Eudora Pro Windows User Manual by
Buckley and Pickering.  Pages 8-10.)
<P>To check your mail, select Check Mail from the File menu.  This will prompt
the mail server to ask for your password once per session.  Type your password
into the field and press the enter key or select OK.  A progress window will pop
up and a message will appear saying either &quot;you have new mail&quot; or &quot;sorry,
you don't have any new mail&quot;.  Regardless of whichever window is displayed,
click the OK button.
<P>If you have new mail, you can open it by selecting In from the Mailbox menu.
 Unread mail has a bullet in the far left column of the message summary. 
Incoming messages are saved in the In mailbox until they are deleted or
transferred to another mailbox.  To close the message, either double click the
close box in the upper left hand corner of the message window or select Close
from the File menu.
<P>Creating and Sending outgoing messages: (Steps 1-3 are as written in the
Eudora Pro Windows User Manual by Buckley and Pickering.  Pages 5-6.)
<P>To create an outgoing message, select New Message from the Message menu.  A
new composition window is displayed with the blinking caret (&gt;) situated in
the start of the To: field.  Type the e-mail address of the recipient of your
message into this field.
<P>The From: field cannot be altered.  This should be your own e-mail return
address.
<P>Press the [tab] key, or point and click the mouse, to move the caret down to
the Subject: field.  Type a brief description of what your message is about into
this field.
<P>Press the [tab] key, or point and click the mouse, again to move the caret
down to the Cc: field.  Into this field type:  eval@foresnt.com  (As part of
this project, we will be counting and categorizing communications as an
evaluation tool for our research.  Eval stands for evaluator.)
<P>Move the caret past the remaining Bcc: and Attachments: fields down to the
large area below them.  This is for the actual body of your message; here you
can type whatever you want.  
<P>When you have finished your message, if this is your only composition,
simply click on the Queue button.  The composition window will immediately
close.  You may now write another message.  When you are done writing all the
e-mail you wish to send, log on to the Internet and then use control T to send
all your queued messages.  A progress bar will appear on the screen as the
messages are sent. 
<P>Eudora does have an immediate send option.  However, this is only possible
if the Immediate Send switch in the Settings dialog (Sending Mail) is turned on.
 We have turned this switch off to save long distance phone charges.  By doing
your work off-line, and then logging-on to the Internet to send it, you can
transmit a large or small number of messages at virtually no cost.  When
Immediate Send is on, the time spent composing your message is being billed to
the school by the phone company.  If the Queue button does not appear in Eudora
when you open it, please ask for help in resetting the switch.  
<P>If you cannot finish a message, or want to review it before sending it, you
can save it by selecting Save from the File menu.  Your unfinished message is
stored in the Out mailbox.  You can open it, by selecting Out from the Mailbox
menu.  At this point you can finish it, edit it and send it or re-save it.  As
long as the message has not been sent, it can still be changed.
<P>Sending multiple messages:
<P>To send the same message to several recipients at a time, simply insert a
comma between each e-mail address in the To: field. 
<P>Replying to a message:
<P>For any incoming message, you can initiate a reply message to its sender
without having to create a new message from scratch.  With your incoming message
open, select Reply from the Message menu.  A new composition window is
displayed, with the sender's address automatically placed in the To: field of
the header.  The original sender's text, preceded by the time and date the
original message was sent, is automatically included in the body of the message.
 This text can be edited as needed  (Buckley, Page 12).
<P>Attaching document files to an e-mail message:
<P>To attach a document or file to an outgoing message, select Attach File from
the Message menu.  The Attach File dialog box is displayed (Buckley, Page 57). 
Find the full path name first, clicking to the correct drive (if you are on a
Local or Wide Area Network or a computer with multiple drives), followed by the
correct directory and subdirectory, and if appropriate, finally to the file
itself.  Once the file is located, select it and click the OK button to attach
it to your message.  The file will not appear within the text of your message,
instead the full path name of the file is displayed in the Attachments: field of
the message header.
<P>To attach multiple files to an e-mail message:
<P>Multiple files can be attached to a single e-mail message by selecting each
file as described above.
<P>Opening an attached document:
<P>With your incoming message open, you can automatically open an attached
document by selecting Open Attachment from the File menu.  
<P>Detaching a file from an e-mail message:
<P>To detach a file from an e-mail message, click anywhere on the name of the
file in the Attachments: field and press the delete key.

</HEAD>
<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" text = "#000000" LINK="#0000FF" vlink = "#008F93">
<font color = "#FFFFFF">There are 27 links on this page.  The first twenty-five are
links to internet search engines.  The final two link to the table of contents
 and to the next chapter of this manual.</font>
<P>USING THE WORLD WIDE WEB.
<P>We will be exploring the World Wide Web as we search for information
relative to our project.  We will be using a search engine browser to move
around within the Web.  Information is stored in catalogs and databases
classified and searchable by keywords.  While reading a document, you will
encounter &quot;links&quot; within the text to other relative Web pages.  You
can select and jump to these pages as you navigate the Web for other information
on your topic. 
<P>SEARCHING with WEB BROWSERS.
<P>Browsers can be located on your own computer, your local Internet service
provider's computer; or through a telnet connection to a publicly accessible
browser.  If you are running a graphics-capable browser like Internet Assistant,
Mosaic or Netscape, you can select a link by clicking on it.  The links are
underlined and/or highlighted text, or icons (a picture, image or other
representation) in a different color than the rest of the text.  If you are
using a plain text-only browser like Lynx, almost all navigation can be
accomplished with the arrow keys and the numeric keypad.  
<P>You will find three basic types of documents on the Web: Text that can be
read; Graphics that can be viewed; and Indexes that can be searched.  (There are
also audio and video documents but these are not widespread yet.)  When your
browser finds a text document, it retrieves the document and displays it for
you, one page at a time.  When it finds an index, it shows you a short
description and invites you to enter one or more keywords into a search field
box.  The browser then searches the index and returns whatever data matches the
keywords. 
<P>NETSCAPE'S BROWSER.
<P>From Program Manager, double click the Netscape icon.  The browser's
homepage will appear on your computer screen.
<P>Double click the search engine icon (Netscape's is called Netsearch).
<P>In the search field box, type words or phrases to describe what you're
looking for (See Search Tips below).  Click the Search button or press the
Return key.
<P>Or, double click the search engine's subject titles in highlighted
hypertext, if appropriate.  Into this search field box, type words or phrases to
describe what you are looking for.  Click the Search button or press the Return
key. 
<P>The results displayed are relevant documents linked by hypertext.  Double
click highlighted words (colored and/or underlined) or icons to bring another
page to your screen.
<P>NETSCAPE USER TOOLS.
<P>SCROLL BAR.
<P>The scroll bar allows you to scroll the page up and down.
<P>NAVIGATION BUTTONS.
<P>At the top or bottom of the screen is a set of navigation buttons to
manipulate your way back and forth between pages you have viewed.  The Back
button shows previously viewed documents; the Forward button, the pages in the
order you previously viewed them.  The Home button brings you back to the
homepage associated with the collection you are viewing.  You can also access
Back, Forward and Home from Go in the toolbar.
<P>BOOKMARKS.
<P>You can bookmark pages you have designated worthy of easy access by opening
Bookmark in the toolbar and clicking Add Bookmark.  Access bookmarked pages by
clicking Go to Bookmarks, and highlighting and double clicking items by title.

<P>The OPEN BUTTON.
<P>The File/Open button allows the user to connect to other documents by
specifying the URL address of the document or resource to connect to.
<P>You can also replace the URL in the present location field box with the URL
of the Internet resource you want.  Often you do not need to know a page's URL
because the location information is included as part of a highlighted link.
<P>The PRINT BUTTON.
<P>The Print button allows the user to print out the document seen on the
screen. The user may be given the choice of printing the document with images or
as a text-only document. 
<P>WEB PAGE'S E-MAIL ADDRESS.
<P>Web pages usually list an e-mail address.  The person in charge of
administrating a World Wide Web site is called a &quot;webmaster&quot;.  Any
problems with the hyperlinks, images, documents, or questions about the site
should be e-mailed to a webmaster address.
<P>NEW WEB BROWSER.
<P>Open a New Web Browser by choosing New Web Browser from the File menu.  You
can open and use four new browsers simultaneously.
<P>NETSCAPE SEARCH TIPS. (From the Infoseek Guide by Infoseek Corporation.)
<LI>Capitalize proper names. Adjacent capitalized names are treated as a single
name.
<LI>If you want to search for several names, use commas to separate them.
<LI>Use double quotation marks (&quot; &quot;) around words that must appear
next to each other.
<LI>Use hyphens (-) between words that must appear within one word of each
other.
<LI>Use brackets to find words that appear within 100 words of each other.
<LI>Put a plus sign (+) in front of words that must be in any documents found by
the search.
<LI>Put a minus sign (-) in front of words that should not appear in any
documents found by the search.
<P>LYNX's BROWSER. (From Academic Computing Services) 
<P>Lynx has a fully-featured World Wide Web browser.  It will display HTML
files containing links to files residing on your local system, as well as files
residing on remote systems.  When Lynx displays an HTML file, it shows links as
&quot;bold face&quot; or &quot;highlighted&quot; text.  The one link displayed
as &quot;highlighted&quot; text is the currently &quot;selected&quot; link. 
Lynx will display the file associated with the selected link by pressing a
right-arrow or a Return key.  To select a particular link, press the up-arrow or
down-arrow keys until the desired link becomes &quot;highlighted&quot; and then
press the right-arrow or Return key to view the linked information.  Almost all
navigation can be accomplished with the arrow keys and the numeric keypad.
<P>LYNX TOOLS. (Academic Computing Services)

<P>ARROW KEYS:
<LI>UP= Select Previous Link.
<LI>LEFT= Back to Previous Document.
<LI>DOWN= Select Next link.
<LI>RIGHT= Display Selected Link.
<P>NUMERIC KEYPAD:
<LI>1= End of Text.
<LI>2= (DOWN ARROW) Select Next Link.
<LI>3= Page Down.
<LI>4= (LEFT ARROW) Back to Previous Document.
<LI>5= (not applicable)N/A.
<LI>6= (RIGHT ARROW ) Display Selected Text.
<LI>7= Top of Text.
<LI>8= (UP ARROW) Select Previous Text.
<LI>9= Page Up.
<P>There are also a few other keyboard commands to aid in  navigation:
<P>Lynx keeps a list of each webpagefile you visit called the &quot;history
list&quot;.  The &quot;backspace&quot; or &quot;delete&quot; key will show you
the whole history list.  Any of the documents shown in the list may be revisited
by selecting them from the history screen.  
<P>The &quot;m&quot; key command will take you back to the starting document. 

<P>The &quot;i&quot; key presents an index of documents. 
<P>Two commands activate searching in Lynx: &quot;/&quot; and &quot;s&quot;. 
While viewing a normal document use the &quot;/&quot; command to find a word or
phrase within the current document.  The &quot;s&quot; key allows searching of
index documents.
<P>Lynx allows the user to select a link with the cursor (the visual position
indicator that moves along with each character as it is entered from the
keyboard) instead of the highlighting bar.  To do this, either recompile Lynx
with the appropriate options, or more simply, use the following command when
starting Lynx:  Lynx -show_cursor.  This will make the cursor point to the link
that is currently selected.  This is useful, especially if accessing the screen
with speech, if you do not want to search the whole screen for one piece of
information. 
<P>The &quot;g&quot; key in Lynx allows you to enter any URL.  The browser will
immediately leap to this location.  You can also type a URL on the command line
after the word Lynx.  
<P>By typing &quot;?&quot; you can look at the on-line user's manual for Lynx.

<P>NEWSGROUPS: (From the <U>Infoseek Guide</U>
by Infoseek Corporation.)

<P>
Newsgroup pages display lists of articles and threads (dialogue)
within the newsgroup.  The groups are organized by subject; each
newsgroup has a name reflecting the topic of discussion for its
messages.

<P>
Usenet is the collection of all newsgroups; it is the Internet's
bulletin board for people to communicate news with one another
on special interest topics.<BR>

<P>
There are two types of access to newsgroups; one is through a
newsgroup browser (you can read all postings but send messages
through a referee who decides if they are relevant and posts them
if appropriate).  The other method of access is by subscribing
directly to a listserver, in which case you receive newspostings
directly into your e-mail box and can post directly back to individuals
or everyone on the list simultaneously.


<P>HOW TO USE NEWSGROUPS. (From the <U>Infoseek
Guide</U> by Infoseek Corporation.)
<P>To open Newsgroups from Netscape:


<P>
Open your Netscape Browser and select Netscape News from
the Window menu.  The News window contains three smaller
windows: a News Server window, a Sender/Subject/Date
window, and a Message window.  Select and click on (news.interserv...fault
news host) in the News Server window to display your
listing of newsgroups.  Click on a newsgroup heading to activate
postings in the Sender/Subject/Date window.  Click on an
item in the Sender/Subject/Date window to open and display
body of text in the Message window. 

<P>
When you have opened the News window, the set of newsgroups you
have specified in the Options menu is displayed in the
newsgroup window.  You can choose Show All Newsgroups from
the Options menu to show all available groups.  (You may
prefer to limit your newsgroup window to newsgroups in your area
of interest.  You can access only the newsgroups you are interested
in without searching through the thousands available by subscribing
to individual newsgroups.)  The easiest way to subscribe to a
newsgroup is to, first, display all newsgroups (choose Options|Show
All Newsgroups) in the newsgroup window, then locate each
newsgroup you want access to and check the Subscribe check
box beside the newsgroup name.  After you subscribe to your favorite
newsgroups, you can choose the Options|Show Subscribed Newsgroups
or Options|Show Active Newsgroups menu item so each time
you open the News window, the newsgroup window displays only your
chosen newsgroups.
<P>
<I>(Remember, this is different than subscribing directly to a
newsgroup through a listserv where postings come to you through
your e-mail.  More on that in the next section, on Listservers.)
</I>
<P>
You can also subscribe if you know a newsgroup's URL. Enter the
newsgroup URL in the location field of the Netscape main window.
 Choose File|Add Newsgroup and type the newsgroup URL in
a dialog box.  Click on a link to a newsgroup or newsgroup message.
 You still must check the Subscribe box if you want the
newsgroup to be displayed in the window in subsequent news sessions.


<P>
<I>Each newsgroup has a unique name for its URL, described with
words separated by periods.  Some words (like alt. for alternative)
specify category types rather than a particular newsgroup.  You
can use the asterisk character (*) to find the names of individual
newsgroups among the many category types of  newsgroups.  For
example, the URL news:alt.* brings you a list of all the newsgroups
in the category alt..  Some of the URL categories of newsgroups
we might use for our project include news:sci.enviroment (science,
environment), news:sci.bio (science, biology) or news:sci.edu
(science, education.)
</I>

<P>Posting to Newsgroups.


<P>
To respond to a message, with the message open, from the Message
menu, choose Post Reply to post a reply to the newsgroup
listserver (which means everyone in the group can read your posting);
or Mail Reply to post only to the sender; or Post and
Mail Reply to post to both the newsgroup and the sender simultaneously.

<P>LISTSERVERS.


<P>
A listserver is an automated discussion group mailing-list distribution
system.  Newsgroups and discussion groups use listservers to send
postings to hundreds of e-mail addresses simultaneously.  In addition
to its mailing list functions, listservers may maintain a database
for each mailing list.  These special databases, (also called list
archives,) hold copies of every mail message distributed on a mailing
list. Users can search for and retrieve old mail messages by using
the database functions.  Another function of a listserver is that
of a file server. This means the server can be used as a central
file repository which can be interrogated and respond to retrieval
requests from any user.  Listserver users can also subscribe to
files so they are informed of file updates or automatically receive
an updated copy of a file.


<P>HOW TO USE LISTSERVERS.


<P>
There are three ways to communicate with listservers: via e-mail,
by interactive message or by file transfer.  For our purposes
we will be using regular e-mail and command e-mail: 


<P>1. By e-mail.


<P>
This is the most common method of communicating with a listserver
and can be employed by any user from any network.  Sending commands
to a listserver via e-mail is not the same as sending mail to
a mailing list. Command mail must be sent to the server itself
 and should contain a series of LISTSERVER commands in its text.
(A mail message intended for distribution to the members of a
mailing list should be sent to the name of that list using regular
e-mail protocol.) When a LISTSERVER server receives e-mail, it
will assume it is command mail and will sequentially execute the
commands found on each line in the mail. The results of these
commands will then be e-mailed back to the sender.


<P>2. Listserver command descriptions and command keywords.

<P>
These commands are designed for use with LISTSERVER mailing lists.
 With them you may do things such as find the names and addresses
of lists, sign on or off lists, review lists or change your personal
options for any mailing list to which you are subscribed.  <I>I
have included the full list for your information, however we will
only be using the following commands:</I>  

<UL>
<LI>JOIN Listname Sign on to a mailing list
<LI>
HELP      Return the general help file for that server
<LI>
HELP list_name   Return a help file for a particular list
<LI>
LEAVE list_name   Leave a list
</UL>

The following commands may also be used on some listservers. 
<UL>

<LI>
SUBscribe A synonym for the Join command which may work
<LI>
SIGNUP Another synonym for the Join command which may work
<LI>
UNSubscribe Sign off a mailing list
<LI>
SIGNOFF A synonym for the UNSubscribe command
<LI>
List  Receive a listing of all the mailing lists at a server
<LI>
REView Receive details of a mailing list
<LI>
Query  Review your optional settings for a mailing list
<LI>
SET  Change your optional setting for a mailing list
<LI>
CONFIRM Confirm your subscription to a mailing list
<LI>
STats  Display statistical information about a mailing
list
<LI>
REGister Register your name at a LISTSERV server<BR>

<P>OTHER NETWORK SERVICES.
<P>Gopher.

<P>
The Internet Gopher allows you to browse on-line catalogs and
libraries for resources using menus. When you find something,
you can access it through the Gopher without having to worry about
domain names, IP addresses, changing programs, etc.  It lets you
browse through &quot;Gopher Space&quot; Internet sources regardless
of file type.

<P>FTP, or file transfer protocol.


<P>
Sometimes, you will find information you want to download to your
own computer or print out.  Or, you might find free software you
want to try.  In either case you will need to move a copy of the
file to your local system so you can manipulate it there.  The
tool for doing this is ftp; it is the common language for transferring
files between operating systems.

<title>Why does it flood in Romney?  - week one</title>
</Head>
<BODY BGCOLOR="FFFFFF" TEXT="000000" LINK="0000FF" VLINK="008F93">
<font color = "#FFFFFF">There are three links at the bottom of this page, leading respectively to the 
previous page, the table of contents, and the next page.</font><BR>
<H2>Overview:<BR>  
What is science?</H2>
<P>Science is more than just another class you have to take in school.  It is a
discipline, a profession, and a process.   To be a good scientist requires
thinking about and testing facts and experiences in a way that is clear and can
be repeated.  Recent generations have seen the products of scientific discovery
applied in ways that seem like magic.  Whether we are talking about
understanding electricity or finding a cure to AIDS, the basic principles of
investigation are common to all branches of science.      
<H2>Description of the unit.</H2> 
<P>The following unit leads students through a process which incorporates
elements of scientific investigation: literature review, hypothesis, data
collection, analysis and conclusions,  while studying about flooding. At the end
of the unit information on hydrology and flooding will be collected and
processed into the form of a scientific article suitable for publication.
Computers will be used as a tool to collect and analyze information. Mentors
will be available through electronic mail, and can be used to answer technical
questions and assist students and teachers in publication of an on-line journal.

<P>This will be done as sort of role play.  The scientific team (the class)
will be divided into three groups to look for specific data on one of three
topic areas: Soil Moisture, Runoff, and Stream Behavior.  Each group will become
resources on these topics for the scientific team. When all of these topics are
put together the class will be able to answer the following 2 questions using
scientific analysis:<OL><LI> Why does it flood? <LI> Why did it flood in Romney?</OL>
<P>The program will take at least 12 class periods and may require some
independent study.    

<H2>Student Preparation.</H2> 
<P>Students should have a basic understanding of how to use a computer and
keyboard, math skills in algebra, and a general understanding of  water cycles,
evaporation, condensation, precipitation, and ecosystem.    

<H2>Mentors.</H2> 
<P>There are 24 mentors for this project.  Fifteen will be student advisors.
Three will be journal editors. Six will be independent experts.  
<P>The primarily role of advisors is to be a sounding board for the students as
they engage in their projects. A secondary role is to be a supportive &quot;friend,&quot;
encouraging the students to strive for excellence and helping them understand
the excitement and fun of doing science. 
<P>We have structured a series of activities into the student projects, which
require students to contact mentors.  These activities are:
<P>During initial training on the use of Internet, each student will be
randomly paired with one mentor.  We shall ask them to contact mentors to ensure
they can use e-mail.  They will be asked to query the mentor concerning what
they do as scientists and why they enjoy it..  
<P>As students conduct background research, they will have to hunt for relevant
sites and pieces of data.  We shall be &quot;seeding&quot; some of this data and
references to sites with the mentors. We encourage mentors to recommend other
relevant sites of which they may be aware, as well..  
<P>As work progresses, students will record their work on templates we have
provided. The templates are modeled on typical sections found in refereed
journal articles. We shall ask students to send each completed template to their
mentor for comment. 
<P>The above work assumes that mentors have experience doing science, but not
necessarily in this topic. Other mentors will be methodological and substantive
experts.  These individuals have direct work experience in fields appropriate
for this project..

<UL>
<LI>Read about models in modeltx.txt. (This can be done before or after the "basketball math"

<H2><LI>Day Three: How does water move through the watershed.</H2>     
<H3>Background Information.</H3> 
<UL>
<LI>Our planet has all the water it will ever have. We do not get new water from
outer space. This is it. In fact, we are drinking the same water that the
dinosaurs drank.  How can that be? 
<LI>The amount of rain or snow which falls on places in the U S is between 1 and 5
feet.
</UL>
<H3>Where does all that water go?</H3>
<UL>
<LI>It goes to three places. 

<OL><LI>  Some of it runs off into streams and rivers and back to the sea. 
<LI>  Some of it evaporates back into the air either directly or through the
leaves of plants. 
<LI>  The rest soaks into the ground to become groundwater.
</OL>
<LI>Rainfall will do different things in different places depending on where
that place is and what the season is in that place. There are factors which
control the percentage of rainfall will either runoff or evaporate or soak into
the ground. These factors are:
<OL>
<LI> The slope of the land. Slope is how steep an area is. Steep slopes make
most of the rain run off.
<LI> Land use. Forests absorb the most water so almost none runs off. Pastures or lawns
absorb some, and almost all water runs off pavement, bare soil, or buildings.
<LI> Distribution of rainfall in time. A long gentle rain will allow much more water to soak in than a cloudburst
which quickly saturates the surface and then must all run off into streams.
<LI> Geology. Under most conditions.  The bed rock and soils are the most important factor
of all.
</OL></UL>
<H3>Hydrology: understanding watersheds</H3>
<P>Hydrology is study of the water cycle.  Hydrologists are the people who
study water in the ecosystem. One of the practical applications of hydrology is
to predict when flooding may occur so people are warned of the potential danger.
<P>The hydrological system you are going to study is the Romney watershed which
contains mountains, rivers, undeveloped land, farming, forests, and buildings. 
A watershed is all of the area which drains into one creek or river. Usually a
watershed's borders are mountain ridges so if a raindrop falls on one side of
the mountain ridge it joins other raindrops, forms a rivulet and eventually
flows into a stream in that watershed. If it falls on the other side it goes
into a different watershed.     
<H3>Lesson.</H3>     
<UL><LI>Use the hands-on sponge model to show that water in a river comes
from the slopes, ground and channel. Use tree branch model of stream and </I>river
systems.   
<LI>Internet search for information on Hydrologic Cycle. GO TO URL:
<A HREF = "http://nppwm1.npp.usace.army.mil/hydrology.html">http://nppwm1.npp.usace.army.mil/hydrology.html</A>.
<LI>Students should read the definition of hydrology. Read the first
three paragraphs on Army Corps of Engineers web site and look for other relevant
information, using the browser. You may need to review the internet manual.
</UL>
<H2>Remember!</H2>
<H3>At the end of the day / week, review key points.</H3>

<H1>Week Two.</H1>     
<H2>Objectives.</H2>     
<OL>
<LI>To understand the key concepts affecting the hydrology of a watershed.
  
<LI>To practice using mathematical equations as they relate to these
concepts.
</OL>
<H2><LI>Day One: Precipitation and Stream flow (Inputs and Outputs of Water
in Watershed).<BR>Predicting Floods.</H2>
<h3>Background</H3>
<P>All of the following things effect the hydrologic process in the watershed.
They are interdependent, meaning no one factor alone will cause it to flood.
<UL>
<LI>Precipitation .
<LI>Infiltration.
<LI>Runoff.
<LI>Soil condition.
<LI>(Vegetation).
<LI>(Climate).
</UL>
<P>How would you predict when it could flood in Romney? In order to understand
flooding you need to know how water enters and moves through the watershed and
what are the factors effecting the water movement. An area floods when the water
input into a watershed exceeds the ability of the system to take up or dispose
of the water input. Mathematically the input is greater than the output. 
Scientists can use models to analyze the possibility of a flood occurring. What
do scientists need to know to model flooding?
<P>The basic information scientists need to know is: 
<OL>
<LI> Precipitation: how much and how fast is water entering a system (input);
<LI>What happens to that water when it gets to the watershed infiltration or
runoff (output).
</OL>
<P><I><B>Input: Precipitation.</B>.</I> 
<P>Precipitation occurs when moist air can no longer hold water as water vapor.
Water turns into droplets or ice crystals which get heavy and fall to the
ground.  In a watershed precipitation is the biggest input of water.
<P>The study of weather is a science called meteorology.  Today there are very
sophisticated instruments used to predict changes in the weather.  On the
internet you can find daily weather predictions. 
<P>Many kinds of people keep close track of the amount of precipitation that
has fallen.  A farmer does this to know if he needs to irrigate, a dam engineer
would do this if she anticipates heavy flows and needs to let more water out of
the dam to keep the reservoir from overflowing, and a skier to know if there is
good snow in the mountains. 
<P>Rain measurements are recorded in inches. It is also important to think of
rainfall over time. A quick cloud burst has a very different effect on a farmers
field than a long gentle rain. You will learn why when we talk about
permeability and how water soaks into the ground.    
<H2>Lesson Plan.</H2>
<OL>   
<LI><H3>Read about Historical Event in Romfldtx.txt.</H2> 
<UL>    
<LI>Flood Jan 19, 1996.   
<LI>Subzero weather for days froze ground.   
<LI>Then, 42 inches of snow in 48 hours.
<LI>Then temp rose to high 40's low 50's and rained on the snow.
<LI>Flood was caused by high volume event exacerbated by &quot;Total&quot; lack
of infiltration due to frozen ground.
</UL>
      <BR><BR>
<LI><H3>Exercise: What's the weather?</H3> 
<UL>
<LI>If possible link to internet or look up daily weather in the newspaper. 
<LI>Discuss how this information is collected (through weather stations placed
throughout the country and with weather satellites that send information to
computers).
<LI>Students write to mentors to an ask what the weather was there on that day.
<LI>They also ask about flooding and if the mentors live in areas where flooding
occurs. Ask the mentors what they know about why flooding occurs.    
</UL>
<BR><BR>
<LI><H3>Did an elephant land on the school? Volumetx.txt.</H3>
<UL>
<LI>Estimate the amount of water that landed on the school in the last rainstorm
using Aquatic Wild Exercise.
<LI>Calculate or download the following:
<UL>
<LI>Area of school grounds (for this activity you do not have to differentiate
between buildings and grounds, just use perimeter).
<LI>Determine the amount of rain that falls in the area by searching for
precipitation records.  
<LI>Using annual or specific storm rainfall, calculate the volume of rainfall on the school grounds. Equation: rainfall
(inches/12) times area (sq. ft) of school equals the volume (cubic feet) of rain
that fell on the school grounds. Make sure to check units. Example: if the area
of the school ground is 50,000 square feet and the annual rainfall is six inches
or .5 feet. Then the volume of rain would be: 50,000 square feet times .5 ft of
rain = 25,000 cubic feet of rain.
<LI>Calculate the weight of water that fell on the school.  Water weighs 62.5
pounds per cubic foot so  the weight of six inches of rain (25,000 cubic feet)
is: 25,000 times 62.5 = 1,562,500 pounds or 781.25 tons of rain.
<LI>Answer these questions: Where does water go after it leaves the school site?
How much water do you think is absorbed by different surfaces on the school
site? What kind of potential pollutants does the water contact as it leaves the
school site?  
</UL></UL></OL>  
<H2><LI>Day Two: Inputs and Outputs of Water in Watershed cont.</H2>     
<B><I><P>Output: Stream flow.</B></I>
<P>Thousands of streams throughout the US are measured daily for flow rate.
Flow rates are the amount of water which passes a given point in a given amount
of time. These rates are usually expressed in cubic feet per second or c.f.s.
<P>Buffalo Creek flow rates have been recorded since the 1920s..    
<H2>Runoff.</H2> 
<P>(Text from Aquatic Wild)
<P>Developing an understanding of precipitation and runoff is an important part
of understanding the water cycle. Rainfall is one form of precipitation. 
Once rain falls upon a surface, water begins to move both laterally outward
and vertically downward. Lateral movement is runoff and finds its way into streams, 
river, and lakes. Vertical movement seeps into the soil and porous rock and re-charges  ground
water supplies.
<P>Runoff is the dominant way that water flows from one location to another. It
is in runoff that many pollutants find their way into moving waters. These are
kinds of pollutants called &quot;non-point source&quot;. What this means is that
widespread sources of pollution such as garden insecticides, automobile
emissions caked on parking lots, lead from paints and exhaust, etc. are washed
by runoff into streams, rivers, lakes, and oceans. Eventually the water becomes
part of an aquatic habitat and toxins being their damage.
<P>Runoff is also responsible for erosion, transportation, and deposition of
sediments scoured from the land's surface. Substandard agricultural and other
land practices often prepare fields and their top soil to be washed away.
<P>On the positive side, much of runoff is uncontaminated. Runoff waters are
necessary to renew many aquatic habitats that are dependent upon inflow for
continuity. The inflow prevents lakes from shrinking due to evaporation and it
prevents streams from going below minimum flow levels. Inflows thus helps
support aquatic life. Without runoff, aquatic habitats would suffer    
<H2>Exercise:</H2> <UL>
<LI>read flow rates for Buffalo Creek.
<LI>Discuss the meaning of these rates.
</UL>
<H2><LI>Day Three: Porosity and Permeability.</H2> 
<P>Two properties are involved in water movement through the ground - porosity
and permeability.
<P>Water can pass easily through some soils and rocks but, others are airtight.
 Two properties are involved in water movement through the ground - porosity and
permeability.    
<H3>Porosity.</H3> 
<P>Porosity is the amount of space between rock or soil particles. Technically
defined it is the percentage of space between particles. This is the space where
water can collect and be held. A soil or rock is permeable if the pores are
connected. This allows for water movement through the ground. Imagine porosity
as the holes in a block of Swiss cheese. These holes are not connected so that
water could not pass through. The cheese is impermeable.    
<H3>Exercise.</H3>     
<UL>
<LI>Demonstration of gravel and sand in jars     
<LI>Discussion: Size does not make a difference for the amount of pore space.
Shape is the critical factor. The combination of big and small particles will
also effect pore space since little particles fit into the spaces between the
larger particles.     
</UL>
<H3>Permeability. (see permblty.doc.) </H3>
<P>Water can not move through soil which is not porous. But porosity is not
enough to guarantee water movement through soil. Soils must also be permeable.
<P>For soils or rock to be permeable and let water move through it, the spaces
between particles must be connected. For example, a Nestle's crunch bar has rice
crispees in it which are mostly air and form holes in the chocolate bar.  But,
because the chocolate fills the space between the rice crispees, and does not
let the holes connect, water could not get through the chocolate bar.
Theoretically, you could use a big Nestle's crunch bar as the roof on your house
and no rain would get in. The chocolate bar is not permeable yet it does have
pores.
<P>Another factor effecting porosity and permeability is the nature of water.
Water has a &quot;stiffness&quot; called surface tension. This can keep water
from getting through small openings.  A dry sponge will not take up water right
away because the surface pores of the sponge shrink when it dries. Water's
surface tension keeps it from getting into the shrunken pores.  An umbrella is
made of cloth which is made from weaving thread together. There are many minute
pores between the treads, yet, water runs off the top of an umbrella.  
<P>If the particles of soil or rock are the size of sand grains then water
moves through quickly, this is permeability.      

<H3>Infiltration</H3> 
<P>&quot;Infiltration is the movement of water into the soil. There is a
maximum rate at which the soil in a given condition can absorb water; this upper
limit is called the infiltration capacity of the soil.&quot; (Dunne and
Leopold). If rainfall is less than the infiltration  capacity then it is
absorbed into the ground. If it is greater that infiltration and exceeds the
infiltration capacity, it runs over the ground surface to streams (runoff). 
<P>Rate is a measure of quantity divided by an amount of time. Cars move along
roads at rates expressed in distance moved  (miles) per unit of time (hour) or
miles per hour. Rainfall intensity is expressed in inches accumulated per
24-hour day   Infiltration rate is expressed as depth per unit time. For example
1 inch per hour. (Actually, this is ironic... the world uses cm for infiltration
and inches for precipitation...)

<P>Rainfall intensity is also expressed in depth per time units. An equation
for predicting runoff can be set up as follows.
<OL>
<LI>If  Infiltration rate is greater than rainfall intensity then the water goes into the
ground.
<LI>If Infiltration rate is less than rainfall intensity then the water runs over the
ground.
</OL>
<H3>Process of Infiltration.</H3>
<P>Three factors are interconnected in their effect on infiltration process.
These are:
<OL>
<LI>entry through the soil surface, or  how much water gets into the soil,
<LI>storage within the soil, or how much is already there, and 
<LI>transmission through the soil, or how quickly it drains through the soil.
</OL>
<P>The rate of infiltration changes over time during a storm.  If the rate of
rainfall stays the same, the infiltration rate will be fast at first then after
one or two hours it will slow to a constant rate. This is because the small
pores in the soil fill up and are not taking in anymore water. If the soil is in
a low area such as a field next to a river, the water table will reach the
surface of the ground filling all of the soil particle spaces and the water runs
off.
<P>The most important factors effecting infiltration rate are:
<OL>
<LI>Rainfall characteristics.
<LI>Soil properties. 
<LI>Vegetation. 
<LI>Land use.
</OL>
<P><B>Rainfall. </B>The most important characteristics of rainfall, as it
affects infiltration,  are its intensity and its timing. The impact of a storm
is greatly influenced by its relation to prior weather.  Timing is crucial.  If
the soil is still partly or substantially saturated from a previous rain storm,
its infiltration capacity is proportionately reduced, and runoff will occur at
intensities that would not normally result in runoff.  
<P><B>Soil Properties</B>. If soil texture is coarse, such as sand, then the
water will drain through the soil quickly. If the soil texture is fine like clay
the soils drain slowly. Organic matter in the soil will also increase the rate
of infiltration. So a coarse textured sandy soil with organic matter will drain
much faster that a clay soil with no organic matter.
<P>Seasonal changes in soil properties can occur in areas where the winter
temperatures go below 32 degrees Fahrenheit. If the soil freezes, the ice
crystals in the soil can block water from infiltrating and cause precipitation
that would otherwise infiltrate to  run-off. 
<P>If rainfall is intense enough, and long enough, it can also cause the soil
surface pores to be clogged with fine soil particles (mud) and the infiltration
can be impeded.  The impact of raindrops thus compacts the soil surface and also
keep water from infiltrating.   There are other factors which can affect the
impedance of  exposed soil  (a way to express the resistance to infiltration of
the soil, useful in constructing mathematical models), including fire, which
scorches and glazes the surface into a nearly waterproof material. Exposure to
direct sunlight has a similar effect.  For this reason (and others) plowed
fields have vastly reduced infiltration capacity, compared to forests or
undisturbed areas. 
<P><B>Vegetation</B>.  Trees, grass, or just leaves on the soil surface will
break the impact of raindrops on the soil surface. They also provide organic
matter to the soil, and help keep the soil temperature low, reducing
evaporation. 
<P><B>Land use</B>. Urbanization. Replacing trees or meadows with roads, parking-lots and
walkways [paved with asphalt or covering the ground with buildings definitely
decreases infiltration and increases runoff.  Water is intercepted, because it
simply cannot penetrate these materials to infiltrate. 
<P>Associated with the buildings and pavement are a complex series of ditches,
gutters, storm-drains and other conveyances which redirect the intercepted water
to other areas, adding water which overwhelms the infiltration capacity of that
site.  
<P>Farming. Farming practices using heavy machinery to plow the fields and
remove vegetation can do two things to decrease infiltration:
<UL>
<LI>FIRST. Machines used in agriculture, especially motorized harvest equipment,
compact the soil and reduce the pore size so there is no room for water. 
<LI>SECOND. By removing vegetation, (as harvested crops), the soil is exposed to
impact from raindrops and looses much of its organic material.
</UL>
<H3>Summary.</H3> 
<UL>
<LI>A decrease in infiltration capacity can cause water to runoff.
<LI>Organic matter in the soils increases infiltration capacity.
<LI>Pavement and soil compaction decreases infiltration capacity.
<LI>Frozen soil can decrease infiltration capacity.    
</UL>
<H3>Exercise.  The sponge experiment. </H3>     
<P>Looking at different rates of water entering the
system and incorporating this into prediction problem. Students generate a
hypothesis and test it.
<UL>
   
<LI>Use DATAINST.DOC for guidelines on how to write up an experiment. Recommend
reading before designing the experiment.   
<LI>Design and conduct experiment.   
<LI>Send a written description of your experiment to your mentor for review.
Peer review and seeking a critique of your work is a normal part of science.

impacts and outcomes.)
<P>[Text from Greenpeace website]
<P>The driving force in a hydrological cycle is the radiant energy from the
sun. Heating of the sea surfaces causes evaporation. Eventually, the water
vapour changes back to the liquid state through condensation to form clouds and,
under certain atmospheric conditions, precipitation (rain or snow). The
precipitation returns directly to the ocean or embarks on a more indirect route
to the oceans via land surfaces. The rainfall may be intercepted by vegetation.
The intercepted water may return at once to the air by evaporation. Rainfall
reaching the ground may collect to form surface runoff or may infiltrate the
ground. The liquid water in the soil then percolates through the unsaturated
layers to the water table, where the ground becomes saturated, or is taken up by
vegetation from which it can be transpired back into the atmosphere. The surface
water runoff and groundwater flow join in surface streams and rivers that may be
held up temporarily in lakes or rivers, but finally flow into the ocean (in the
following, the term catchment area is frequently used (in American literature:
the drainage basin or watershed). It can be defined as the area that collects
and directs the surface water into the stream that drains it). 
<P>In most cases, the prevalence of heavy or intense precipitation in the river
basin is the primary cause of flooding. The meteorological variable of interest
is the intensity of rainfall. In case of low-intensity rainfall, the rainwater
infiltrates the soil and takes a relatively long period of time to reach the
stream (by the subsurface or groundwater flow). If much rain prevails in a short
time, intensity may be high enough to exceed the infiltration capacity of the
soil (the ability of a soil to absorb water). The residual (falling water that
is not absorbed by the soil) becomes surface runoff. Obviously, the potential
for flooding is then great. Hence, next to heavy rainfall the absorption
capacity is significant. This capacity depends on soil type and the amount of
moisture already present in the soil. For example, sandy soils absorb much of
the rain, but clay soils have very low infiltration capacities. When rainfall
continues, soil moisture increases and the water holding capacity of the soil
decreases. Whenever and wherever the rate of rainfall (or snowmelt) exceeds the
infiltration rate at the surface, the excess water begins to accumulate at the
surface. Even low-intensity rainfall will then produce surface runoff. Surface
runoff is most likely to occur in the low portions of the catchment, near the
streams, where the initial soil moisture content is highest. It is evident that
the chance on flooding depends on the combination of rainfall and catchment
characteristics. For example, high-intensity rainfall with limited duration may
heavily affect a brook but will have little impact on large rivers. The latter
are more sensitive to widespread rainfall over an extended period, especially
when the area of rainfall is large enough to affect the feeding tributaries.
   
<H3><LI>Work with flood model equation.</H3>
<P>Two conditions must occur for it to flood.

in Romney function and what were the flow rates during the time of the flood and
compare those to the channel capacity.
<H3>Tasks</H3>
<UL>
<LI>Obtain and study background information.
<LI>Describe flow rates. What is c.f.s.?   
<LI>Peak flows for streams near Romney which have U.S. Geologic Survey stream
gages.   
<LI>About channel capacity and its role in flooding.     
<LI>Obtain the following data:
<UL>
<LI>Flow rates at time of flooding from U.S.G.S. stream gages.   
<LI>Channel capacity of near-by river.
<LI>  The size and form of the riverbed.  
</UL>  
<LI>Assemble data from related studies or nearby streams.
<LI>Analyze data - what do these rates and numbers mean. Express in
terms the rest of the class can relate to. For example, translate c.f.s. to number
of bathtubs full of water passed by in one hour.
<LI>Prepare an oral or written report for class.
</UL>
<P><B><I>Related information: To enhance your report you may choose to
provide background information and discuss other aspects of the watershed such
as aquifer and ground water.</I></B>   
<H2>Information on Units:</H2>
<UL>
<LI>Runoff is expressed as cubic feet or acre feet.      
<LI>Cubic foot is one foot times one foot times one foot.
<LI>An acre-foot is one foot times 1 acre or one foot times 43560 square
feet, but an acre-foot is usually expressed in gallons.  Acre-foot = 325,851
gallons.
<LI>An inch per hour of runoff from 1 acre = 1 c.f.s. (cubic foot per second).
<LI>1 c.f.s. for 1 day = 1.98 acre-foot   
<LI>A bathtub holds 30 gallons. How many bathtubs of water are in an acre-foot. 
10,862.
<LI>Water weighs 62 and a half pounds per cubic foot.
</UL>     
<H1>Group 2: Runoff. Including slope and permeability.</H1>     
<P>The &quot;Runoff&quot; group is investigating what happened to water, or
precipitation, before and during the time of the flood.
As part of the report to your group you should cover the following
topics. This information can be obtained from mentors or from other sources if you
can't do a search on internet.

<P><I><B> 1-5 to be completed in one week. 6 to be completed as
soon as possible.</I></B>
<OL>
<LI>Read text on models.

</OL>
<H3>Review of Models.</H3>
<P>Black boxes - Models, especially engineering models, are constructed as &quot;black
boxes&quot;. The term comes from the world of science, where the test
instruments, and other &quot;observation&quot; tools and &quot;standards&quot;
used became too complex to understand. They became &quot;black boxes&quot;,
whose purpose was clear, whose function was clear, but the actual process that
went on inside the box was of little interest to the scientist, unless the
process that inside the test instrument interacted with the experimental
conditions in a way that caused problems or introduced error. All the scientist
needed to understand was the transformation that occurred between the input and
the output.  You do not have to understand how your watch works. It is a black
box.  What you do need to understand is how to use it, and at what point the
limits of its performance (accuracy, longevity, durability) are likely to affect
its use. 
<P>An engineer or scientist need not worry about how it works, all that matters
is what it does. The engine in an automobile is a &quot;black box&quot; from the
point of view of most of the people on the design team.  All the detail of its
workings one needs to know is its form and its performance characteristics to be
able to design the rest of the car around it.  The engine, even though it is &quot;black
box&quot; is really a system of many &quot;black boxes&quot; which reflect the
variety of functions it performs.  The performance characteristics of the engine
are its input requirements, and the outputs it delivers.  The inputs are the
cooling air it requires, the fuel and lubricants it consumes, and combustion air
it needs to burn the fuel.  The outputs are power, noise, air pollution, waste
heat, and water vapor. 
<P>There are many factors related to the black box that one needs to address to
build the rest of the car.  How much fuel does it take per hour, to produce
enough power to run the rest of the car? How much heat or noise does it make
when it is running?  How much air pollution does it make ?  Each of these
factors can be addressed independently, in separate black boxes.  
<P>A series of black boxes (input and output relationships) can be used to
describe a system. The system is created by &quot;assembling&quot; the boxes
into a more complex arrangement, where one, or several boxes feed into the next
box in the series.  Elements are added to increase the &quot;accuracy&quot; of
the model.  The black box concept means that it is not obvious why a certain
situation causes a particular outcome, but, using statistical analysis, a series
of connected and understood relationships have been found to contribute to the
outcome. For example, Think of the reason for why 5 inches of rain in January
can cause flooding when 5 inches of rain in July does not. Use the frozen ground
that the snow fell on, and the snow that insulated it from melting, a condition
which happens rarely. This rareness can be addressed as a probability. 
<P>These relationships can be developed mathematically [and expressed as a
statistical probability, sometimes it freezes, and the rain melts it, sometime
it doesn't, ....this is now a good match to flooding and black boxes] .  The
variables used in the equation relate directly to a part of the system.  For
example the amount and rate of water leaving the ecosystem is dependent on the
amount of water coming into the ecosystem and the things in the ecosystem which
use the water. 
<P>This project uses a series of black boxes to develop a model of a watershed
system.    

<H2>Class &quot;Mission&quot; Statement. </H2> 
<P>Imagine that you are a member of a team of scientists who were asked by the
Romney city council to determine why there was a flood in Romney in <B>1985</B>
and to see if you can predict the conditions which will cause the river to flood
again.  The members of city council are concerned because they need to develop
zoning regulations which can protect people from losing their homes or other
property.
<P>Your tools to accomplish this are as follows.
<UL>
<LI>Computer.
<LI>Models and templates.
<LI>Internet - searches and websites.
<LI>Mentors.
<LI>Each other.    
</UL>
<H2>Information needed to complete reports.</H2>
<UL>
<LI>What factors lead to the flood in 1996?
<UL><LI>List factors.   
<LI>Rank by importance.    
<LI>Discuss probability.     
</UL>
<LI>What factors lead to the flood in 1985?
<LI>Obtain data.   
<LI>List factors.   
<LI>Rank by importance.   
<LI>Discuss probability.
</UL></UL>
<P>Bring pieces of information together specific to that event and
solve the equation. Then predict or discuss the parameters which when met would
cause it to flood again in Romney.
<P>In the culminating report the following aspects should be covered.
 <UL>   
<LI>Describe flooding and your hypothesis about flooding.
<LI>Summarize what the small groups learned about flooding.
<LI>Describe the ecosystem of Romney in terms of type of vegetation,
general ecological parameters such as types of soils, geology, vegetation, and
human activity. For example include the length of time people have been farming
or living here.
<LI>Describe the annual rainfall, average (mean and median) &amp;
peak.
<LI>Describe what the events were that lead up to the flooding in Romney
in 1996 and 1985.
<LI>Discuss the likely set of events which would cause it to flood in
Romney again. For example: Snow fall over X inches, Z or greater amount of rain
for at least T period of time...causes runoff R which adds to river capacity at
least Y.
<LI>Draw conclusions concerning the significance of the data both
socially, for example: the impact of flooding on water quality, and
scientifically, for example, validity of a computer model concerning effects of
rain on snow events.</UL>
<P>Send articles first to the journal mentors and individual mentors for
comment. After receiving comments from mentors and incorporating their comments
into your work send the final draft to the journal editor at Foresight
[scied@foresnt.com] to be edited and put into the journal.
<P>You may need to keep week five open to allow for delay in previous
week's schedules.

<p>
<br   ALIGN=left><b><font SIZE=+1>THE WATER CYCLE.</font></b></p>

<p><font SIZE=+0>This is an education module about the movement of water
on the planet Earth. The module includes a discussion of water movement
in the United States, and it also provides specific information about water
movement in Oregon. </font></p>

<p><font SIZE=+0>The scientific discipline in the field of physical geography
that deals with the water cycle is called hydrology. It is concerned with
the origin, distribution, and properties of water on the globe. Consequently,
the water cycle is also called the hydrologic cycle in many scientific
textbooks and educational materials. Most people have heard of the science
of meteorology and many also know about the science of oceanography because
of the exposure that each discipline has had on television. People watch
TV weather personalities nearly every day. Celebrities such as Jacques
Cousteau have helped to make oceanography a commonly recognized science.
In a broad context, the sciences of meteorology and oceanography describe
parts of a series of global physical processes involving water that are
also major components of the science of hydrology. Geologists describe
another part of the physical processes by addressing groundwater movement
within the planet's subterranean features. Hydrologists are interested
in obtaining measurable information and knowledge about the water cycle.
Also important is the measurement of the amount of water involved in the
transitional stages that occur as the water moves from one process within
the cycle to other processes. Hydrology, therefore, is a broad science
that utilizes information from a wide range of other sciences and integrates
them to quantify the movement of water. The fundamental tools of hydrology
are based in supporting scientific techniques that originated in mathematics,
physics, engineering, chemistry, geology, and biology. Consequently, hydrology
uses developed concepts from the sciences of meteorology, climatology,
oceanography, geography, geology, glaciology, limnology (lakes), ecology,
biology, agronomy, forestry, and other sciences that specialize in other
aspects of the physical, chemical or biological environment. Hydrology,
therefore, is one of the interdisciplinary sciences that is the basis for
water resources development and water resources management. </font></p>

<p><font SIZE=+0>The global water cycle can be described with nine major
physical processes which form a continuum of water movement. Complex pathways
include the passage of water from the gaseous envelope around the planet
called the atmosphere, through the bodies of water on the surface of earth
such as the oceans, glaciers and lakes, and at the same time (or more slowly)
passing through the soil and rock layers underground. Later, the water
is returned to the atmosphere. A fundamental characteristic of the hydrologic
cycle is that it has no beginning an it has no end. It can be studied by
starting at any of the following processes: evaporation, condensation,
precipitation, interception, infiltration, percolation, transpiration,
runoff, and storage. </font></p>

<p><font SIZE=+0>The information presented below is a greatly simplified
description of the major contibuting physical processes. They include:
</font></p>

<p><b><font SIZE=+1>EVAPORATION</font></b><font SIZE=+0> </font></p>

<p><img src="" border=0  height=32 width =32 align=center ></p>

<p><font SIZE=+0>Evaporation occurs when the physical state of water is
changed from a liquid state to a gaseous state. A considerable amount of
heat, about 600 calories of energy for each gram of water, is exchanged
during the change of state. Typically, solar radiation and other factors
such as air temperature, vapor pressure, wind, and atmospheric pressure
affect the amount of natural evaporation that takes place in any geographic
area. Evaporation can occur on raindrops, and on free water surfaces such
as seas and lakes. It can even occur from water settled on vegetation,
soil, rocks and snow. There is also evaporation caused by human activities.
Heated buildings experience evaporation of water settled on its surfaces.
Evaporated moisture is lifted into the atmosphere from the ocean, land
surfaces, and waterbodies as water vapor. Some vapor always exists in the
atmosphere. </font></p>

<p><font SIZE=+0>Condensation is the process by which water vapor changes
it's physical state from a vapor, most commonly, to a liquid. Water vapor
condenses onto small airborne particles to form dew, fog, or clouds. The
most active particles that form clouds are sea salts, atmospheric ions
caused by lightning,and combustion products containing sulfurous and nitrous
acids. Condensation is brought about by cooling of the air or by increasing
the amount of vapor in the air to its saturation point. When water vapor
condenses back into a liquid state, the same large amount of heat ( 600
calories of energy per gram) that was needed to make it a vapor is released
to the environment. </font></p>

<p><b><font SIZE=+1>PRECIPITATION</font></b><font SIZE=+0> </font></p>

<p><img src="" border=0  height=32 width =32 align=center ></p>

<p><font SIZE=+0>Precipitation is the process that occurs when any and
all forms of water particles fall from the atmosphere and reach the ground.
There are two sub- processes that cause clouds to release precipitation,
the coalescence process and the ice- crystal process. As water drops reach
a critical size, the drop is exposed to gravity and frictional drag. A
falling drop leaves a turbulent wake behind which allows smaller drops
to fall faster and to be overtaken to join and combine with the lead drop.
The other sub-process that can occur is the ice-crystal formation process.
It ocurrs when ice develops in cold clouds or in cloud formations high
in the atmosphere where freezing temperatures occur. When nearby water
droplets approach the crystals some droplets evaporate and condense on
the crystals. The crystals grow to a critical size and drop as snow or
ice pellets. Sometimes, as the pellets fall through lower elevation air,
they melt and change into raindrops. </font></p>

<p><font SIZE=+0>Precipitated water may fall into a waterbody or it may
fall onto land. It is then dispersed several ways. The water can adhere
to objects on or near the planet surface or it can be carried over and
through the land into stream channels, or it may penetrate into the soil,
or it may be intercepted by plants. </font></p>

<p><font SIZE=+0>When rainfall is small and infrequent, a high percentage
of precipitation is returned to the atmosphere by evaporation. </font></p>

<p><font SIZE=+0>The portion of precipitation that appears in surface streams
is called runoff. Runoff may consist of component contributions from such
sources as surface runoff, subsurface runoff, or ground water runoff. Surface
runoff travels over the ground surface and through surface channels to
leave a catchment area called a drainage basin or watershed. The portion
of the surface runoff that flows over the land surface towards the stream
channels is called overland flow. The total runoff confined in the stream
channels is called the streamflow. </font></p>

<p><b><font SIZE=+1>INTERCEPTION</font></b><font SIZE=+0> </font></p>

<p><img src="" border=0  height=32 width =32 align=center ></p>

<p><font SIZE=+0>Interception is the process of interrupting the movement
of water in the chain of transportation events leading to streams. The
interception can take place by vegetal cover or depression storage in puddles
and in land formations such as rills and furrows. </font></p>

<p><font SIZE=+0>When rain first begins, the water striking leaves and
other organic materials spreads over the surfaces in a thin layer or it
collects at points or edges. When the maximum surface storage capability
on the surface of the material is exceeded, the material stores additional
water in growing drops along its edges. Eventually the weight of the drops
exceed the surface tension and water falls to the ground. Wind and the
impact of rain drops can also release the water from the organic material.
The water layer on organic surfaces and the drops of water along the edges
are also freely exposed to evaporation. </font></p>

<p><font SIZE=+0>Additionally, interception of water on the ground surface
during freezing and sub- freezing conditions can be substantial. The interception
of falling snow and ice on vegetation also occurs. The highest level of
interception occurs when it snows on conifer forests and hardwood forests
that have not yet lost their leaves. </font></p>

<p><b><font SIZE=+1>INFILTRATION</font></b><font SIZE=+0> </font></p>

<p><img src="" border=0  height=32 width =32 align=center ></p>

<p><font SIZE=+0>Infiltration is the physical process involving movement
of water through the boundary area where the atmosphere interfaces with
the soil. The surface phenomonon is governed by soil surface conditions.
Water transfer is related to the porosity of the soil and the permeability
of the soil profile. Typically, the infiltration rate depends on the puddling
of the water at the soil surface by the impact of raindrops, the texture
and structure of the soil, the initial soil moisture content, the decreasing
water concentration as the water moves deeper into the soil filling of
the pores in the soil matrices, changes in the soil composition, and to
the swelling of the wetted soils that in turn close cracks in the soil.
</font></p>

<p><font SIZE=+0>Water that is infiltrated and stored in the soil can also
become the water that later is evapotranspired or becomes subsurface runoff.
</font></p>

<p><b><font SIZE=+1>PERCOLATION</font></b><font SIZE=+0> </font></p>

<p><img src="" border=0  height=32 width =32 align=center ></p>

<p><font SIZE=+0>Percolation is the movement of water though the soil,
and it's layers, by gravity and capillary forces. The prime moving force
of groundwater is gravity. Water that is in the zone of aeration where
air exists is called vadose water. Water that is in the zone of saturation
is called groundwater. For all practical purposes, all groundwater originates
as surface water. Once underground, the water is moved by gravity. The
boundary that separates the vadose and the saturation zones is called the
water table. Usually the direction of water movement is changed from downward
and a horizontal component to the movement is added that is based on the
geologic boundary conditions. </font></p>

<p><font SIZE=+0>Geologic formations in the earth's crust serve as natural
subterranean reservoirs for storing water. Others can also serve as conduits
for the movement of water. Essentially, all groundwater is in motion. Some
of it, however, moves extremely slowly. A geologic formation which transmits
water from one location to another in sufficient quantity for economic
development is called an aquifer. The movement of water is possible because
of the voids or pores in the geologic formations. Some formations conduct
water back to the ground surface. A spring is a place where the water table
reaches the ground surface. Stream channels can be in contact with an unconfined
aquifer that approach the ground surface. Water may move from the ground
into the stream, or visa versa, depending on the relative water level.
Groundwater discharges into a stream forms the base flow of the stream
during dry periods, especially during droughts. An influent stream supplies
water to an aquifer while and effluent stream receives water from the aquifer.
</font></p>

<p><b><font SIZE=+1>TRANSPIRATION</font></b><font SIZE=+0> </font></p>

<p><img src="" border=0  height=32 width =32 align=center ></p>

<p><font SIZE=+0>Transpiration is the biological process that occurs mostly
in the day. Water inside of plants is transferred from the plant to the
atmosphere as water vapor through numerous individual leave openings. Plants
transpire to move nutrients to the upper portion of the plants and to cool
the leaves exposed to the sun. Leaves undergoing rapid transiration can
be significantly cooler than the surrounding air. Transpiration is greatly
affected by the species of plants that are in the soil and it is strongly
affected by the amount of light to which the plants are exposed. Water
can be transpired freely by plants until a water deficit develops in the
plant and it water-releasing cells (stomata) begin to close. Transpiration
then continues at a must slower rate. Only a small portion of the water
that plants absorb are retained in the plants. </font></p>

<p><font SIZE=+0>Vegetation generally retards evaporation from the soil.
Vegetation that is shading the soil, reduces the wind velocity. Also, releasing
water vapor to the atmosphere reduces the amount of direct evaporation
from the soil or from snow or ice cover. The absorption of water into plant
roots, along with interception that occurs on plant surfaces offsets the
general effects that vegetation has in retarding evaporation from the soil.
The forest vegetation tends to have more moisture than the soil beneath
the trees. </font></p>

<p><b><font SIZE=+1>RUNOFF</font></b><font SIZE=+0> </font></p>

<p><img src="" border=0  height=32 width =32 align=center ></p>

<p><font SIZE=+0>Runoff is flow from a drainage basin or watershed that
appears in surface streams. It generally consists of the flow that is unaffected
by artificial diversions, storages or other works that society might have
on or in a stream channel. The flow is made up partly of precipitation
that falls directly on the stream , surface runoff that flows over the
land surface and through channels, subsurface runoff that infiltrates the
surface soils and moves laterally towards the stream, and groundwater runoff
from deep percolation through the soil horizons. Part of the subsurface
flow enters the stream quickly, while the remaining portion may take a
longer period before joining the water in the stream. When each of the
component flows enter the stream, they form the total runoff. The total
runoff in the stream channels is called streamflow and it is generally
regarded as direct runoff or base flow. </font></p>

<p><b><font SIZE=+1>STORAGE</font></b><font SIZE=+0> </font></p>

<p><img src="" border=0  height=32 width =32 align=center ></p>

<p><font SIZE=+0>There are three basic locations of water storage that
occur in the planetary water cycle. Water is stored in the atmosphere;
water is stored on the surface of the earth, and water stored in the ground.
</font></p>

<p><font SIZE=+0>Water stored in the atmosphere can be moved relatively
quickly from one part of the planet to another part of the planet. The
type of storage that occurs on the land surface and under the ground largely
depend on the geologic features related to the types of soil and the types
of rocks present at the storage locations. Storage occurs as surface storage
in oceans, lakes, reservoirs, and glaciers; underground storage occurs
in the soil, in aquifers, and in the crevices of rock formations. </font></p>

<p><font SIZE=+0>The movement of water through the eight other major physical
processes of the water cycle can be erratic. On average, water the atmosphere
is renewed every 16 days. Soil moisture is replaced about every year. Globally,
waters in wetlands are replaced about every 5 years while the residence
time of lake water is about 17 years. In areas of low development by society,
groundwater renewal can exceed 1,400 years. The uneven distribution and
movement of water over time, and the spatial distribution of water in both
geographic and geologic areas, can cause exteme phenomena such as floods
and droughts to occur. </font></p>

</font></p>

<p><font SIZE=+0>The atmosphere above the 48 coterminous United States
of America stores about 36.5 cubic miles per day of atmospheric water.
A little over 10 percent or 3.9 cubic miles of it falls as precipitation
each day. About 1,430 cubic miles of precipitation fall over the 48 states
annually. This volume would be enough each year to cover the states with
about 30 inches of water. </font></p>

<p><font SIZE=+0>The greatest average yearly precipitation in the world
of 460 inches (1,168 cm) occurs at Mt. Waialeale, Hawaii. The lowest average
annual precipitation of 1.63 inches ( 4.1 cm) in the United States occurred
over a 42-year period in Death Valley, California. The longest dry period
with no precipitation in the United States occured during a 767 day period
from October 3, 1912 to November 8, 1914 at Bagdad, California. </font></p>

<p><font SIZE=+0>An average of 70 percent of the annual precipitation to
the coterminus U.S. ( 1,001 cubic miles) evaporates back into the atmosphere
from land and water surfaces and by transpiration from vegetation. The
remaining 30 percent of the annual precipitation ( 429 cubic miles) is
transported through the other surface and subterranean processes of the
water cycle to a stream, lake, or ocean. </font></p>

<p><font SIZE=+0>Groundwater storage in the coterminous United States has
been estimated to be about 15,100 cubic miles both in the shallow groundwater
(less than 2,600 feet deep) and an equal amount in the groundwater deeper
than 2,600 feet. Soil moisture in the top 3 feet of soil is estimated to
be equivalent to about 150 cubic miles of water. </font></p>

<p><font SIZE=+0>The United States has approximately 4,560 cubic miles
of water stored in freshwater lakes. Although there are about 5,540 cubic
miles of water are stored in the Great Lakes alone, over 50 percent of
the volume is considered to be in the United States. Also, about 14 cubic
miles are stored in salt lakes of the nation. In addition, there is approximately
12 cubic miles of surface waters stored in stream channels in route to
the oceans. Other sources of surface storage in the coterminous states
include 16 cubic miles of frozen water in glaciers. </font></p>

<p><font SIZE=+0>The stream flow volume that reach the oceans of the nation
is about 1.12 cubic miles per day ( 409 cubic miles per year). The total
combined surface and groundwater flow to the nation's oceans is 1.18 cubic
miles per day. The Mississippi River alone contributes 0.34 cubic miles
per day (annual natural runoff of 593,000 cubic feet per second). </font></p>

<p><font SIZE=+0>There are approximately 2700 reservoirs and controlled
natural lakes of more than 5,000 acre-feet in storage in the United States.
The reservoirs provide 142 cubic miles of storage, almost 90% of which
occurs in 600 of the largest reservoirs. Also, there are approximately
50,000 reservoirs ranging from 50 to 5,000 acre-feet in storage. It is
also estimated that there are about 2 million farm ponds in the United
States. Most of the major reservoirs in the nation are owned by the public.
The Bureau of Land Management is the manager of the most federal dams (over
750), but most are small dams. The larger reservoirs are managed by the
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the Bureau of Reclamation, and the Tennessee
Valley Authority. The Corps has built and operates almost 600 dams and
reservoirs ,the Bureau of Reclamation operates nearly 300 dams and reservoirs,
and the TVA has over 50 dams and reservoirs. Other federal agencies that
manage small dams include the US Forest Service with about 400, the Bureau
of Indian Affairs with over 300, the National Park Service with over 260,
the US Fish and Wildlife Service with over 175, and the Department of Energy

<p><b><font SIZE=+1>WATER IN THE STATE OF OREGON.</font></b><font SIZE=+0>
</font></p>

<p><font SIZE=+0>Oregon is divided into two distinct rainfall zones by
the Cascade Range. The annual precipitation west of the Cascade Mountains
ranges from 40 to 140 inches. East of the Cascades, precipitation ranges
from 10 to 20 inches per year. The average annual precipitation for the
entire state is 28 inches. The average annual runoff is about 20 inches.
The state has a network of 112,000 miles of rivers and streams to accomodated
the annual runoff. There are over 365 waterfalls mapped in Oregon that
are in the cascade and the cataract categories of waterfalls. Cascade waterfalls
have small volumes of water with perpendicular movement of the flowing
water often associated in a succession of stages. Cataract category waterfalls
have large volumes of water that move perpendicularly. Over 120 geothermal
hot springs in the state have been identified with water temperatures that
are 15 degrees F above the mean annual air temperature. The total groundwater
supply in Oregon has not been quantified. </font></p>

<p><font SIZE=+0>Oregon has an estimated available, annual surface water
supply of over 66 million acre- feet (19.5 cubic miles). Differences in
the seasonal and geographic distribution of water resources throughout
the state results in annual water shortages in many areas of the state,
especially in eastern Oregon. Use of natural flow of surface waters, surface
storage in reservoirs, and ground water supplies from aquifers are used
to meet the year around demands. </font></p>

<p><font SIZE=+0>The major river affecting Oregon is the 1,243 mile long
Columbia River. It forms much of Oregon's northern border with the state
of Washington. One of the Columbia's major tributaries, the Snake River
forms a major portion of the eastern border of Oregon with Idaho and is
the location of the 7,900 feet deep Hell's Canyon. The Columbia River originates
in adjacient states of Washington, Idaho, and Montana and in Canada. The
average annual flow is 265,000 cubic feet per second. This volume represents
0.15 cubic miles per day. </font></p>

<p><font SIZE=+0>There are seven watersheds that empty into the Pacific
Ocean. Two of the basins (*) are closed basin and do not discharge water
to the ocean or to receiving streams. Eleven are interior basins that empty
into receiving streams. </font></p>

<p><font SIZE=+0>Oregon abounds with over 6,000 natural lakes, ponds, marshes,
sloughs and reservoirs. Over 1,400 of them are named lakes. They have a
combined surface area of 500,000 acres (781 square miles). Hundreds of
the lakes are unnamed. There are 13 Lost Lakes, 11 Blue Lakes, 10 Clear
Lakes and 10 Fish Lakes. They range in surface area size from a maximum
of 90,000 acres (141 square miles) at Upper Klamath Lake to cattle pond,
farm ponds, and mill ponds of less than one acre. Crater Lake is the deepest
lake in the United States. It is 1,932 feet deep, with a capacity of 14
million acre-feet (4.14 cubic miles) and a surface area of 13,139 acres
(20.5 square miles). Following heavy rainfall and runoff during in 1984,
Malheur and Harney lakes in southeastern Oregon were joined together for
several years. Malheur Lake and Harney Lake are again separate lakes, but
connected as part of a closed basin wetland system, with Malheur Lake being
about 90,000 acres. The Malheur Lake complex is still considered the largest
natural body of water in Oregon. The 180,000 acres (281 square miles) of
the lake/wetland complex located in the closed basin forms the largest
freshwater marsh in the western contiguous United States. Other large lakes
in Oregon include Waldo, Odell, and Wallowa lakes. More than half of the
lakes in the state are volcanic or glacial depressions located on the high
elevation areas between the summits of the Cascade Range. Nearly 100 of
the natural lakes are clustered in the Wallowa Mountains of northeastern
Oregon. Many other lakes are located between sand dunes near the Oregon
shore. Many of the natural lakes throughout the state have had water control
structures built at their outlets to enhance storage in the lakes and to
control the release of stored water for downstream irrigation. </font></p>

<p><font SIZE=+0>Oregon has more than 60 reservoirs with capacities of
over 5,000 acre-feet each. The largest reservoir in the state is the Bureau
of Reclamation's Owyhee Lake in southeastern Oregon with over 1 million
acre-feet ( 0.3 cubic miles) of storage. Most of the reservoirs in Oregon
were built, at least partially, to store irrigation water. There are hundreds
of small single purpose reservoirs built by local irrigation companies.
Rarer types of single purpose reservoirs include recreation reservoirs,
fish and wildlife reservoirs, and water quality enhancement reservoirs.
</font></p>

<p><font SIZE=+0>Reservoirs are generally characterized by their project
purposes. Water supply reservoirs are distinguished by large storage volumes
that are capable of providing an expected annual supply of water and capable
of outlasting most droughts. Irrigation reservoirs have large conservation
pools with maximum conservation pools at the beginning of the growing season
and a mimimum pool during the nongrowing season. Flood control reservoirs
have a small permanent pools with a large storage capacities to reduce
downstream water levels key locations on rivers. Another characteristic
of flood control reservoirs is that they are generally drawndown as quickly
as possible following a high runoff event to reestablish their storage
capabilities. A hydroelectric reservoir is characterized by storage and
release properties that meet regional energy demands, especially during
the winter or the summer. Reregulation reservoirs are built below hydroelectric
dams to stabilize water flow in rivers to reduce flow fluctuations between
daily power generation periods. Headwater storage reservoirs for navigation
purposes have large storage pools at the beginning of the dry season and
they release enough water to support seasonal navigation traffic. Lock
and dam reservoirs, however, support waterborne navigation by creating
slightly vary pools that extends upstream a considerable distance from
the run-of-river projects. </font></p>

<p><font SIZE=+0>US Army Corps of Engineers reservoirs are multiple purpose
impoundments meeting several types of water resources needs such as flood
control, hydroelectric power generation, navigation, irrigation, municipal
and industrial water supply, water quality, fisheries, and recreation.
The Portland District, Corps of Engineers built and operates three run-of-river
reservoirs on the main stem of the lower Columbia River, Bonneville, The
Dalles, and John Day dams, that meet navigation, hydroelectric power, irrigation,
fisheries, water quality and recreation needs. The Portland District also
has built and operates 13 multiple purpose storage projects with a total
capacity of 2,308,020 acre-feet of water at maximum conservation pool (
0.68 cubic mile) in the Willamette River Basin. The district also stores
547,191 acre-feet of water (0.16 cubic mile) at the maximum pools of the
two Rogue River Basin projects. Additionally, John Day Dam, on the Columbia
River, has 534,000 acre-feet (0.16 cubic miles) of usable storage. Portland
District's Willow Creek Dam, on the north central Oregon tributary to the
Columbia River, stores 6,249 acre-feet (0.002 cubic miles) at it's normal
summer conservation pool level. Therefore, the total volume of water stored
in Portland District reservoirs is equivalent to over 75 percent of the
single daily flow of water from U.S. rivers into the oceans. </font></p>

<p><font SIZE=+0>The scheduling of water storage and release from dams
is part of a water resources engineering function called reservoir regulation.
</font></p>

<p><font SIZE=+0>If you would like to experience regulating a multiple
purpose reservoir, then go to <a HREF="2.htm">SIMRES</a>. Be prepared to
experience several randomly selected weather patterns that will change
the volume of water entering the simulated reservoir. Do your best to meet
the flood control, hydroelectric power, navigation, river fishery, reservoir
fishery, and reservoir recreation functions of the project. </font></p>

<P>
<b>WARNING</b>: Unless you are willing to get hold of the documentation for these programs and put a lot of effort into figuring out how these programs work, you will <i><b>not</b></i> be able to use them.  Bibliographic references to the documentation are included with the programs.  Addresses where you can buy the documentation are listed after the programs.<p>
I compiled all of these programs with a Microsoft <A HREF="6.zip">demo compiler</A> that expired on June 30, 1995. have not tested if resetting the date on your computer will allow it to function after June 30. One person who has tried it says that resetting the date does work. There was not any notice distributed with the compiler saying that I was not allowed to use it after June 30.  Therefore, you could make a case that using it after June 30 is permitted.  The compiler did give a message that it would cease to operate once June 30'th had passed, but that is not the same as saying that usage of the compiler was not permitted.  <a href="http://198.105.232.4:80/fortran/">Microsoft</a> is ofering a free Test Drive CD-ROM for their Fortran PowerStation 4.0 by calling 800-899-0435, Dept. 7VD. I don't know what's on it beyond that. It's only available in the U.S. and Canada.
<P>
Mac users may wish to download a demo Fortran compiler from <a href="http://www.langsys.com/langsys">Language Systems</a> to recompile these programs for Mac's. <p>
Some of these programs have been copied to other locations including <A HREF="http://dino.wiz.uni-kassel.de/model_db/server.html">Register of ecological models</A> and <A HREF="http://hydrosystems.com/ehisrvr.html">Enviromod</A>.
<P>
The files can be decompressed with <a href="http://www.pkware.com/">PKZIP</a>  or <A HREF="http://www.winzip.com/winzip/">WinZip</A>.  Winzip is easier to use.
<P>
The local net is busiest from noon to 1 pm and 3 to 6 pm Central time. (GMT-6)  You may be able to transfer these files more quickly if you download them during off-peak hours. However, this web page is on a machine that has an unfortunate tendency to crash frequently.  The programs are on a more stable machine so you can connect to that site directly if you can't access this page. <A HREF="ftp://aapg.geol.lsu.edu/pub/winston">ftp://aapg.geol.lsu.edu/pub/winston</A>
 <P>
As far as I know, these programs are all free of viruses.  I scan for viruses regularly and have never encountered any evidence of virus activity, but... you never know.  You use these at your own risk. 
You can download antiviral software from the <A HREF="http://www.mcafee.com/">McAfee Home Page</A>.
<P>
(Hint to Mosaic and Netscape users: use the shift key when clicking on the links for these files to download them directly to disk.)
<P>
Please <A HREF="http://aapg.geol.lsu.edu/reg.htm">register</A> the programs you have downloaded.  I would like to inform you if a program is updated.
<P>
In some cases a newer version of the source code is available.  I have listed the sites I am aware of under "<A HREF="#GW">Groundwater modeling links</A>". It may be impossible to link to some of these sites using Netscape or Mosaic.  You may wish to use <A HREF="http://gfecnet.gmi.edu/Software/softftp.html">WS_FTP</A>, to download the file(s). Some contain files that are compressed as TAR.Z or TAR.GZ files. They can be decompressed with <A HREF="http://www.winzip.com/winzip/">WinZip</A>.

The <a href="http://www.umanitoba.ca/geo_eng/Groundwater/">University of Manitoba Groundwater FTP site</a> has seven programs including two executable versions of SUTRA the newer of which appears to be identical to the one distributed by US Geological Survey, WRD. The program at <A HREF="ftp://srv3rvares.er.usgs.gov/pub/sutra.dir">ftp://srv3rvares.er.usgs.gov/pub/sutra.dir</A> differs from the one distributed by US Geological Survey, WRD in that the value of the variable K00 has been changed

there have been other changes between the two programs.

practical way to estimate well drawdown, pumping rate, and spacing of 
groundwater recovery and injection wells.  PUMPIT is also ideal for 
educational purposes because of its flexibility and ease of use.  Flow 
and particle tracking simulations assume homogenous aquifers under 
transient/steady state and confined/ unconfined conditions, and can 
include up to 50 wells. The demo is limited to 4 wells. Calculation methods are based on the Theis and 
Thiem equations for radial flow to wells.

<h2>Federal R&amp;D Funding </h2>

<p><b>We know that there are great ideas worthy of developing, but we also
know that no matter how good an idea may be, nothing happens without funding.
Finding funding for R&amp;D is a craft we have been honing for over 15
years.</b></p>

<p>If you are interested in obtaining Federal R &amp; D funding, Foresight
can:</p>

<ul>
<li>Assess Your Capabilities </li>

<li>Help You Find The Funding</li>

<li>Train You to Find Additional Funding on Your Own</li>
</ul>

<p>The <i>obvious</i> fact is that no matter how much the Federal Budget
goes up or down, there are always billions of R&amp;D dollars available.
Some of those dollars are in traditional R&amp;D prime contracts and grants.
Others are in special programs. SBIR, Manufacturing Technology, and Energy-Related
Inventions are a few examples. There are yet more available dollars in
subcontracts. Cooperative Research and Development Agreements, and other
partnerships, can provide yet more funding in the form of in-kind contributions.
</p>

<p>What is <i>not obvious </i>is how to find and win this money. Foresight's
network of staff and consultants walk the halls, work the phones and e-mail,
and follow-up to maintain our contacts year round. Timing and follow-up
often make the critical difference where R&amp;D dollars are concerned.
If you cannot conduct the kind of marketing you need in a timely manner,
we may be just the advantage you've been looking for in your quest for
Federal Funding. <a name="approach"></a></p>

<h2>Our Approach for Winning Federal R&amp;D Awards</h2>

<p>Before you spend money for marketing, you deserve to know what will
be done and how. Foresight services are based on the following 10 step
method. </p>

<ul>
<li>Define the research interests and capabilities of the client in cooperation
with the client. Conduct an intellectual property audit if it has not already
been done to insure that intellectual property systems are in place.</li>

<li>Identify the Presidential, Congressional, and Agency priorities as
well as other planned and current initiatives and projects of relevance.
After mapping the priorities, initiatives, and projects into R&amp;D funding
programs, use data bases and other secondary sources to determine the specific
priorities and funding levels for these programs.</li>

<li>Together with the customer, develop a set of &quot;strawman&quot; and
white papers for dissemination to those programs. Help the customer develop
a capability statement and other marketing documents, as necessary.</li>

<li>Contact all programs identified and use the strawmen to identify opportunities
and refine R&amp;D concepts. Determine proposal requirements, funding cycles,
ultimate end-users, etc. Seek information on additional programs to contact.</li>

<li>Revise the strawmen in light of information obtained from funding programs.</li>

<li>To influence funding programs, contact the ultimate end-users and assess
their needs and the timing of their technology introduction cycles. Also
assess if funding is available through them or sources they are aware of.
Determine their willingness to support fund-raising initiative.</li>

<li>Further refine white papers and prepare brief concurrent engineering
documentation for transitioning anticipated R&amp;D results into products
for Federal and, as appropriate, commercial markets.</li>

<li>Conduct market research (including preliminary sales) calls to relevant
programs. Develop R&amp;D funding and product introduction strategies including
the viable targets.</li>

<li>Review the strategies with the client and select a strategy (substantive
R&amp;D and product goals, funding goals, targets, training and information
systems enhancement tasking, timing, etc.)</li>

<li>Implement the strategy together with the client.</li>
</ul>

<P><BR>
</P>
</UL>

<P>Internet is as a low cost medium for transmitting and obtaining information.
As such, it is a competing technology for telephones, mail and delivery
services, television, radio, and so forth. <BR>
</P>

<P>Internet is a computer network. The idea of a network is familiar to
us all. Most networks we know are collections of smaller networks. The
highway system is made up of many road networks: toll-ways, interstate,
state highways, city streets and county roads. The power grid is a network
of local power companies, connected through occasional large public power
utilities. The telephone system is the largest network on earth, an enormous
web connecting many of the world's people. </P>

<P>Just like cars, toasters or telephones, computers can be connected to
networks. Most computer networks are called LANs (Local Area Networks)
and are usually limited to the computers in one office or one building.
The LAN allows all computers in the office to share information and resources,
and simplifies maintenance of the individual computer installations. Businesses
with more than one office often connect their office LANs together to create
WANs (Wide Area Networks). The creation of the WAN allows all of the computers
in the enterprise to share information and other resources. <BR>
</P>

<P>The Internet is just another network. A good analogy is the phone system.
You can call anyone, anywhere in the world so long as both you and the
person you are calling (1) have access to a phone and (2) those phones
are connected to national phone systems which are (3) connected to international
lines. <BR>
</P>

<P>The Internet is sometimes called the network of networks, because it
provides the link between the various LANs and WANs for those who use it.
The Internet provides a wide range of network services including: e-mail
(electronic mail and listservers, i.e. automated mail distribution systems),
document access (including access to thousands of catalogs and databases
of information and to newsgroups), file transfer (from one computer to
another), telnet (access to a remote computer as if you were connected
to a local computer or Bulletin Board System), and interactive conferences.
To access these services the appropriate tools need to be installed into
your computer. Increasingly, however, World-Wide-Web browsers, one of these
tools, are including other tools as well in order to provide an integrated
package for the customer. In this chapter we shall focus on using the Web
and e-mail. <BR>
</P>

<P>Internet relies on a series of protocols to function. Protocols are
standard practices we all agree to follow, making it possible to cooperate
without having to continually negotiate over trivial issues. Again we will
use our analogy of the interstate highway system. Even though this system
is an enormous network of highways, roads and streets that connect different
countries and states and is governed by many different systems and rules,
these road systems all share certain common protocols. The fundamental
protocol is that cars have agreed to drive on one side of an arbitrary
line painted down the middle of public roads under almost all circumstances.
Another protocol involves the use of colored lights and signs to establish
the order in which vehicles move through areas too congested to allow the
freedom of unimpeded actions. <BR>
</P>

<P>Similar protocols allow computers to operate internally, and to share
resources and exchange data with one another on LANs and on WANs. Protocols
allow modems (a device that converts a computer's digital pulse into an
analog tone that can be transmitted over a telephone line) to &quot;handshake&quot;
and negotiate the fastest speed at which information can be moved over
telephone wires, to break the information stream into packets of data,
to assess the accuracy of packet transmissions and re-send packets damaged
in transmission until they have been correctly received. The protocol that
routes data between hosts (i.e., registered computers) on the Internet
is called IP (Internet Protocol). Each computer has its own IP address
or &quot;borrows&quot; the IP address of a host server which it logs onto
by phone. <BR>
</P>

<P>If you have never used Internet a wealth of training material is available
simply by using a World Wide Web browser. (See the next section for an
overview about the Web.) An excellent overview for people with Microsoft
Windows or NT operating systems can be downloaded from the <A HREF="http://www.saecrc.org/menu/freestuf.shtml#Internet">San
Antonio Electronic Commerce Resource Center </A>at Help Download. Another
excellent overview, writing as a text file so it is accessible through
any operating system is Patrick Douglas <A HREF="ftp://ftp.seeport.com/science_education/student/internet/crispen/readme.htm">Crispen's
Roadmap for The Information Superhighway Workshop</A>. The workshop consists
of a series of lessons.<BR>

<HR></P>

<P><A NAME="I.1"></A></P>

<H2>The World Wide Web</H2>

<P>One of the most important parts of Internet is the World Wide Web, usually
referred to as the Web. The Web contains a set of documents, primarily
based on a protocol called HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol). HTTP enables
you to access documents (called Web pages) via an address scheme known
as URL (Universal Resource Locator). URL protocol is the World-Wide-Web's
address system. It guides users to a specific spot on the Internet where
information resides and transfers the files between the different systems.
It does not matter if their actual locations are in the same directory,
on the same diskette, or located on a different computer halfway around
the world, as long as you have a functioning link to the Internet. <BR>
</P>

<P>HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) is the interpreted computer language
which operates as an extension to the ASCII text file format. ASCII is
the American Standard Code for Information Exchange, a data transmission
standard for assigning seven-bit codes to 128 different elements including
the 26 letters of the alphabet in upper and lower case, the basic number
set (0-9) and punctuation marks.<BR>
</P>

<P>HTML is a subset of a larger &quot;language&quot; called SGML (Standard
Generalized Markup Language). HTML adds &quot;tags&quot; (encapsulated
within less-than ((&lt;)) and greater-than ((&gt;)) brackets) to the text
file which serve as commands and turn text between the tags into commands.
These commands format image and text &quot;links&quot; for URL address
jumps to other hypertext files (.htm or .html). We can select these links
by clicking the highlighted text (more on this in the Searching with Web
Browsers section). The program you use to find and read hypertext documents
is called a browser. As you follow one link to another, you are navigating
the Web.<BR>
</P>

<P>Information of all kinds can be found on the web. The following table
displays some kinds of the information available and the typical means
for accessing that information. <BR>

<H2><A NAME="I.2"></A>Why Use Internet<BR>
</H2>

<P>Most people use Internet as a library and telephone/mail replacement.
This is not surprising. Most new technologies are initially used in ways
patterned on previously used technology. For example, the personal computer
was initially used primarily as a fancy typewriter and calculator. In this
Chapter we will present one other way of using the Internet: as a tool
for distributed problem solving. <BR>

<HR></P>

<H2><A NAME="I.3"></A>Using Internet as a Library</H2>

<P>There are an number of features which make Internet attractive as a
library replacement. </P>

<P>For one thing, there is a vast amount of information and data to access.
<BR>
</P>

<P>Increasingly, all Internet-based resources can be accessed via Web browsers.
Therefore, we shall focus on this gateway. <BR>
</P>

<P>The scientific literature on the Web grows by leaps and bounds. Much
of this is highly useful for literature reviews concerning proposal topics
and for finding qualified scientists and engineers who might be consultants.
For example, most university faculty will post copies of recently published
papers on their personal web sites. In addition, a surprising number of
journals are available on-line. (For a discussion of on-line journals and
references to journals and source directories see<I>: &quot;A Survey Of
STM Online Journals 1990-95: The Calm Before the Storm</I>,&quot; by Steve
Hitchcock, Leslie Carr and Wendy Hall of the <A HREF="http://journals.ecs.soton.ac.uk/survey/survey.html">Multimedia
Research Group</A>, University of Southampton.)</P>

<P>A wealth of federal government information also is accessible. <I><A HREF="http://www.fedworld.gov/">FedWorld</A>
Information Network</I> is the basic gateway to all publicly accessible
federal on-line resources. Managed by the National Technical Information
Service, Technology Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce. <BR>
</P>

<P>The Web can be viewed as a collection of specialized libraries. Each
library exists as a hypertext linked set of pages in hyperspace. For example,
one such library would be information on R&amp;D funding opportunities.
A starting point for this library is this manual, the <I><A HREF="http://www.seeport.com/R&DBOOK/RDGUIDE.HTM">NSF
Small Business Guide to Federal R&amp;D Funding Opportunities</A></I>,
especially the sections on agency R&amp;D funding priorities and points
of contact. This document is available on-line at Foresight's Seeport web
site, http://www.seeport.com. Another important page is the <A HREF="http://web.fie.com/htdoc/fed/all/any/any/menu/any/index.htm"><I>FEDIX</I>
index</A>. <I>FEDIX</I> is a free one-stop information retrieval service
of federal opportunities for the education and research communities. Key
federal agencies support <I>FEDIX</I> under a cooperative agreement from
the Department of Energy. <BR>
</P>

<P>Unfortunately, as a library, the Web also has a number of problems.
The information found on the Web is often dirty, that is, it may not be
accurate, current, or checked for typographical and other errors. Indeed,
it is often not clear who is the source of the information or how the validity
of the information was confirmed. Web pages and <A HREF="http://www.neosoft.com/internet/paml/index.html">newsgroup/listserver
</A>postings in particular are black boxes when it comes to quality assurance.
As Joe Breskin of our company once put it: &quot;You can be 100% positive
that the person on the other end actually is a scientist of a very precocious
13 year old.&quot; <BR>
</P>

<P>A further problem is that relevant information is often hard to find.
Our experience indicates that <A HREF="http://altavista.digital.com/"><I>Alta
Vista</I> </A>is probably the best search engine for scientific information
on the Web. However, no search engine has complete coverage of the Web,
let alone of other Internet modes such as FTP. One solution is to use a
variety of search engines. Both free and fee-for-service engines exist.
You can also use an artificial intelligence based meta-search engine tool.
<I><A HREF="http://www.metacrawler.com/">Metacrawler</A></I>, by Oren Etzioni
and his colleagues at the University of Washington, retrives site references
by searching several several search engines at once. Etzioni refers to
it as a carnivore in a world of Web grazing herbivores. <BR>

<HR></P>

<H3><A NAME="I.4"></A>Searching </H3>

<P>There are two primary categories of tools for locating resources on
the Internet: subject catalogs and search engines. <BR>
</P>

<P>Subject catalogs are Web accessible documents that maintains lists of
links organized by their content. They are easy to use. You simply look
under the most appropriate topic in the catalog. Hypertext links lead from
the catalog to web pages or other Internet documents of potential interest<BR>
</P>

<P>Search engines use large databases of indexed entries. Each entry represents
a specific web page or other Internet resource. A structured query of the
data base allows the user to select documents based on certain words, phrases,
or patterns within those documents. The terms entered in the query are
called keywords. The search engine then examines the database for documents
that match or are related to the user's criteria, and returns appropriate
documents to the user. The data bases are built by software, sometimes
called web spiders, which automatically travel cyberspace examining and
indexing documents, that is, entering it into the database using words
extracted from the title or text. Spiders use links in documents to find
pointers to other documents that haven't been indexed yet.<BR>
</P>

<P>Your ability to locate Internet resources of interest with a search
engines is dramatically increased if you approach Internet searching systematically.
The following chart provides a basic overview of how to search.<BR>
</P>

<CENTER><P><IMG SRC="IMG00002.GIF" HEIGHT=474 WIDTH=322><BR>
</P></CENTER>

<P>Probably the most crucial step is defining the search strategy and search
terms. The search strategy consists of a set of terms and the order and
logic you will use to construct the actual search phrase. The search phrase
is what you type into the search engine. <BR>
</P>

<P>When searching, you want to get a large number of hits and winnow those
down to a manageable size through the addition of more terms. Additional
terms may require complicated logic. The reason for this process is that
it is easier to make a search phrase more complicated than more simple.
The cost of making a type or other mistake is less. For example, a search
may crash if you do not balance out opening and closing parentheses. <BR>
</P>

<P>As you engage in this winnowing process you will reach a point where
you have less than 200 hits. Our experience is that this is the maximum
number of hits you can scan and review in a reasonable amount of time.
<BR>
</P>

<P>Search strategies should only be designed after<I> </I>reading the instructions
concerning the logic the engine can support. Most engines will support
some kind of Boolean logic, but how the logic must be written often differs.
<BR>
</P>

<P>The terms used to construct the search are often called <I>keyword<B>s</B></I>.
A few search engines can only use specific keywords for searching. Catalogs
typically have this constraint, though some allow open text searching of
their database. <BR>
</P>

<P>If any word can be used for searching, it helps to construct a <I>term
tree</I>. A term tree consists of a branching structure from a general
concept to more specific ones. Depending on the number of hits you are
receiving, you can move up and down the tree to open or narrow the search.
The following chart provides a very simple term tree for searching for
information about computer monitors. If you were interested in finding
manufacturers of Backlit Liquid Crystal Displays you might begin by searching
on that phrase. If you did not get enough hits to find the pages you want,
you would move up the tree to higher levels of generality (first Liquid
Crystal Displays, then Displays). <BR>
</P>

<P>A second issue in searching is to think about the kinds of sites and
pages or interest. For &quot;objective&quot; evaluations of competing technologies
(e.g., liquid crystal displays and cathode ray tubes) you might want to
attempt to restrict your search to government and university sites. Thus,
you would reject any hits whose URL address did not include either gov
or edu. Similarly, you might be interested in more scholarly papers on
a topic. In this case you might seek pages which had terms like &quot;abstract&quot;
or &quot;table of contents' (or toc or index) in their URL address or description.
<BR>
</P>

<P>A third issue to consider is whether the information on the pages you
find is likely to be accurate, current, and checked for typographical and
other errors. There is a lot of garbage out there in cyberspace. We recommend
thinking about the motivations of the people providing the site. Our experience
is the best sites tend to be ones where steady funding exists to support
the site. Thus, government-funded sites tend to have pretty clean information,
as do university sites. Government-funded sites include both those established
by federal and state agencies and those maintained under contract. Corporate
sites primarily focused on promotion are most clean with respect to product
and service information, although they will have a clear bias that their
stuff is worthwhile.<BR>

<H3>The <A NAME="I.5"></A><I>SBIR Internet Card Catalog</I></H3>

<P>The <A HREF="http://www.seeport.com/SBIR/catalog.htm">NSF SBIR Internet
Card Catalog</A> is the on-line companion to this document. Found at it
provides detailed information on hundreds of sites useful for proposal
preparation, conducting research, and commercialization, including finding
Phase III partners. Modeled on the library card catalog, unlike a search
engine or general Internet catalog (e.g. Yahoo), the <I>SBIR Internet Card
Catalog</I> contains information on the specific content of the site, the
tools available for navigating the site, how the accuracy and currency
of the information it contains is ensured, and an assessment of the utility
of the site for SBIR related activities. Information has been checked through
direct contact with the webmaster for the site. Hypertext links allow you
to jump directly to sites of interest. <BR>

<H2><A NAME="I.6"></A>Using Internet as a Telephone/Mail System</H2>

<H3>The Experience of Communicating over Internet</H3>

<P>In order to use Internet effectively for interpersonal communications,
it helps to reflect for a moment on what makes Internet different from
more traditional modes of communicating. One of the most significant differences
is that most current Internet modes dramatically reduce the number of dimensions
of sensory information you have concerning the person with whom you are
communicating. <BR>
</P>

<P>The more dimensions of sensory information involved in an interaction
between people, the more personality is part of the interaction. Face-to-face
discussions for business require attention to how you look, how your breath
smells, and so forth. When you meet your counterparts, you take time to
say hello and establish a rapport before settling down to business. <BR>
</P>

<P>Phone conversations eliminate visual, smell, and all other sensory data
except sound. The artifact required for audio communication (that is, talking
through the phone) seems to permit moving much more rapidly to the point
of the conversation. In effect, e-mail even removes the audio quality of
your voice. All that remains is the way you use language, that is, the
structure of the message displayed on another's screen. This &quot;depersonalization&quot;
enables dispensing with all of the superficial pleasantries which accompany
more traditional modes of interaction without insulting your counterpart.
<BR>
</P>

<P>This depersonalized quality of most business e-mail, suggests where
e-mail can best be used. It works very well for targeted requests for information,
for conveying advice in response to a question from another, and to conveying
information where both participants to the exchange understand what the
information means and how it is to be used. Alternatively, e-mail is a
poor way to motivate a distant worker or subcontractor. <BR>
</P>

<P>It helps to consider the &quot;personality&quot; dimension when using
Internet. As more interaction is required either to convey emotional/motivational
messages or to explore and explain information and concepts (i.e. distance
learning); tools other than e-mail may be required. Within the next few
years, on-line real-time conferencing with video and audio images will
become increasingly common. Yet, such capabilities will come with strong
bandwidth requirements. Real time interactive communication requires dedicated
hardware and software to work effectively. The best &quot;white boards&quot;
and other interactive groupware run slow without at least ISDN lines. Still,
Internet conferencing and white board program which run at slower speeds
are now commercially available. These are useful for interactively marking
up draft proposals and other documents if both participants have a second
phone line enabling voice discussions during the process. <BR>
</P>

<P>When communicating by e-mail, remember that there is typically a time
lag in the communications. First, it takes time for messages to travel
through clogged channels. Second, participants in the discussion can be
anywhere in the world and thus in any time zone. <BR>

<HR></P>

<H3><A NAME="I.7"></A>Electronic Commerce</H3>

<P>Probably the most important development for small high technology businesses
is the emergence of electronic commerce. Like any other good, information
has costs for its production, distribution, and maintenance. The long range
costs of production can be cut by operating with economies of scale. Just
how large an operation has to be to attain economies of scale depends on
the production technology being used. What Internet has done is dramatically
drive down the Minimum Efficient Scale for the production and distribution
of information. <BR>
</P>

<P>This drop in Minimum Efficient Scale means that even a small company
can distribute and/or coordinate its operations in new ways. Electronic
product and process exchange enable new cooperative relationships between
small firms or small and large firms. <BR>
</P>

<P>At the heart of electronic commerce is a series of protocols for electronic
data interchange (EDI). EDI is the computer-to-computer exchange of business
documents in a standard electronic format. Rather than mail or fax purchase
orders, invoices, and the like, companies engaged in EDI, called trading
partners, transmit electronic versions. <BR>
</P>

<P>There are currently several on-going demonstrations for communicating
research administration data electronically to the federal government.
These include the already mentioned National Science Foundation's FastLane
project, NIH's Edison system for technology transfer and the government-wide
electronic research administration demonstration, NewERA. For more information
see <A HREF="http://web.fie.com/web/era/index.htm"><I>FEDIX's </I>Electronic
Research Administration</A><I> </I>page. <BR>
</P>

<P>The Department of Defense has its own electronic commerce initiative
for electronic data interchange (EDI). For additional information visit
the Department of Defense funded <A HREF="http://www.saecrc.org/menu/toc.shtml">San
Antonio Electronic Commerce Resource Center</A>. <BR>

<HR></P>

<H2><A NAME="I.8"></A>Using Internet for Distributed Problem Solving</H2>

<P>Internet can also be used as a tool for developing and coordinating
distributed work groups working on common problems. This feature makes
it especially attractive for SBIR related activities. <BR>
</P>

<P>As we use the term, work groups are ad hoc teams established to meet
predefined objectives. Certain tasks lend themselves to completion through
distributed work groups. Such tasks have three features which make it possible
for the work to be completed by people in different physical locations:
<BR>
</P>

<OL>
<LI>A clear objective for the activity can be stated and objective criteria
established for determining if the object is being attained or not. </LI>

<LI>The task is limited in duration and can be rigorously scheduled. </LI>

<LI>The task does not require a lot of informal interaction among group
members. Rather, each participant can work on his or her own and communicate
the results of the work to others in time for them to use it as required.
</LI>
</OL>

<P>
<HR></P>

<H3><A NAME="I.9"></A>Structuring the Group</H3>

<P>The major difference between distributed work groups and ones based
in a single location is that the coordination and management cannot be
accomplished by walking down the hall and talking with someone. Thus, a
formal management structure is imperative. We find an effective management
structure for distributed work groups can be built using three elements;
roles, tasks, and information flows. <BR>
</P>

<P>Just what roles are required reflects the reason for setting up the
work group in the first place. A group for product design will look different
from a group for proposal preparation. <BR>
</P>

<P>Roles have two components: function and authority. Function is the basic
area of activity the person holding the role is supposed to be conducting
to enable the group to meet its objective(s). Authority is the ability
to make a decision and expect others to follow it. <BR>
</P>

<P>The work and authority relationships between all other individuals needs
to be defined in advance. A crucial role is group leader. Someone must
be in charge and have the authority to make decisions immediately. Otherwise
long distance communication problems can cause nightmares should a coordination
problem emerge. <BR>
</P>

<P>Once the roles required have been identified, the next step is to clearly
define the specific tasks the group is to accomplish. Making a project
scheduling chart for the major tasks the group must perform is a good way
to accomplish this task. Any commercial project scheduling software will
work. <BR>
</P>

<P>For each task, next sketch the flows of information which must go between
group members and the sequence which messages must have. (Flow charting
software is helpful here.) Because information is flowing without face-to-face
contact, and usually without any voice contact, information flow cannot
be taken for granted. Thus, each set of tasks has a corresponding &quot;information
model.&quot; <BR>
</P>

<P>The information flows should have two components; The first component
is a channel. How will the information physically be moved. Will it be
attached to e-mail, accessible over FTP, available on a web site, or something
else (like US Mail)? Second, (i) what specific information must and may
flow through the channel and (ii) what information is forbidden or is discouraged.
This component can be referred to as the permissibility of the information.
Permissibility is related to the function of the information. The function
will also determine how each person receiving information is supposed to
respond. <BR>
</P>

<P>There is no reason to assume that each member of the work group will
require the same information, although that may be the case. There may
be no harm in providing complete information to each person so long as
everyone is clear what information to which they must respond and what
types of responses are desired. For example, is a member of a proposal
team receiving a draft section as a &quot;for your information&quot; or
for a detailed critique. <BR>
</P>

<P>It helps to have a specific person with authority over each channel.
That person is responsible for defining the specific character of the messages
which flow in the channel and for facilitating the quality of information
(i.e., its accuracy, timeliness, utility) flowing in the channel. <BR>
</P>

<P>Roles, tasks, and information flows provide the basic structure for
simple distributed work groups. Management becomes a matter of regularly
checking to ensure people are honoring their roles, completing tasks on
time with the desired results, and sending and responding to information
appropriately. <BR>

<HR></P>

<H3><A NAME="I.10"></A>Finding People to Work With</H3>

<P>The feasibility of working with people in distributed locations means
that it is possible to include people on teams with whom you might never
otherwise have worked. Finding the best possible people for a work group
is, however, itself a challenging problem. The traditional method is to
contact a group of five to seven experts in the field of interest and ask
them for a couple of recommendations. Those individuals recommended by
the most experts are probably the best people with whom to work. <BR>
</P>

<P>This method begs a fundamental question: How do you find the experts
to ask about other experts? We know certain institutional positions are
typically associated with expertise. Such positions include government
program managers, academic faculty and directors of university-based centers,
and technical experts in associations. Finding these people is straightforward
with the aid of Web search engines.<BR>
</P>

<P>First search on terms relevant for the area in which you are looking
for experts. Once you locate relevant sites, browse them and follow the
most plausible links to other pages of interest. For example, supposed
you were looking for help with technology transfer. A search on technology
transfer would lead to you to the National Technology Transfer Institute,
a government funded university-based center. It's <A HREF="http://www.nttc.edu/gov/other/tech.html">Technology
Transfer Links</A>page at contains links to academic, non-profit, and commercial
consultants. <BR>
</P>

<P>It also useful is to monitor a relevant listserver, newsgroup, or discussion
group. In selecting the listserver or group it is important to consider
the kinds of discussion and participants which are most relevant for locating
the experts you want. <BR>

<HR></P>

<H3><A NAME="I.11"></A>Building Tools for Passing Information</H3>

<P>Because all work group members are likely to already have commercial
word processing and spreadsheet software, it is possible to use this software
to construct the basic templates you need for most work group activities.
There is far to much hype about expensive and complicated programs like
Lotus Notes which, while excellent, are overkill for most SBIR-related
tasks required by small firms. <BR>
</P>

<P>Establishing Internet-based message templates for common SBIR related
tasks need not be complicated The forms creation and outlining capabilities
of word processors and spreadsheets can be used to quickly make templates
for most messages which will flow between group members. <BR>
</P>

<P>If a flow requires routing the same message through several people,
it is imperative to include a header with each message in the channel.
The header provides a place for people to indicate they have read the document
prior to passing it along. (Remember the old routing slips on paper. They
were useful.) <BR>
</P>

<P>Templates are recommended as a way of encouraging work group members
to include only important data in each message. As discussed above, a great
advantage of Internet based communication is that it can brief. Work group
members need to understand that messages within the channels have a strictly
instrumental function. They are there only to move the task forward towards
completion. All other communication should go through e-mail outside the
channels. <BR>
</P>

<P>Depending on the kind of software on each person's computer, attention
will have to be paid to file formatting. We have found that simply formats
like Rich Text File (RTF) for word processors and Lotus 1-2-3 spreadsheets
can be read by almost any commercial package. Thus, if you are working
with people who have widely divergent software, export files into these
simpler formats before attaching them to e-mails or uploading them onto
an FTP site. <BR>
</P>

<P>Move the forms around as attachments to e-mail or, if to large, through
an FTP site.<BR>
</P>

<P>A factor to remember is that binary files (like word processing documents
with their formatting intact) are encoded prior to transmission by e-mail.
Software running under most Microsoft operating systems will use Mime,
Apple systems will use BinHex, and UNIX and cc;Mail will use Uuencode to
encode attachments. Commercially purchased e-mail packages will commonly
decipher and apply the correct decoding scheme, but you do find problems
from time to time. <BR>
</P>

<P>A second factor to remember is that multiple versions of the same document
can pass each other in cyberspace as messages. Fortunately, version control
problems can be avoided with simple methods. On word processing documents,
for example, a simple version control method is to have each recipient
use a different color for annotations and revisions. Only the primary author
of the document is given the authority to accept and remove revisions and
annotation. Just who is the primary author may change over time, but it
is always just one person. <BR>

The ESSC data server is designed to provide on-line access to relevant 
data for ongoing student investigations at participating educational 
institutions. The on-line data can either be downloaded to the 
investigation site or be viewed as data visualizations through the ESSC 
Visual Data Browser, which can be accessible through this page. Since 
topics of investigation change during a school (academic) year, the 
on-line data holdings will constantly be updated and enlarged for 
accommodating the changing needs of students and educators throughout the 
year. In addition to on-line access to the investigation data, the ESSC 
data server also provides links to other earth system science data 
sources over the Internet. The ESSC members may further make requests for 
data which is either inaccessible or hard-to-access through the ESSC 
server.

<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>Flood Narrative</TITLE></HEAD>
<BODY><P>The Great Flood of 1996</P>
<P>A series of intense surges of subtropical moisture have inundated
western Oregon this week.  The combination of record-breaking rain, warm
temperatures, and a deep snowpack have led to severe flooding throughout
northern sections of the state.  Although maximum flood stages have not
yet been reached on major rivers such as the Willamette, it appears that
this flood will be of comparable magnitude to the December, 1964 flood,
the largest in Oregon since flood control reservoirs were built in the
1940's and 1950's.</P>
<P>The event began with unusually high amounts of snow in the middle
and high elevations of the Cascades and Coast Range.  In mid-January,
the snowpack was poor; the average for high-elevation sites (NRCS SNOTEL
stations) in the Willamette drainage was only 29% of average on January
17th.  The next two weeks, however, saw prodigious snowfall totals (in
many locations, several feet per day for many days).  By January 31, the
average snowpack for the Willamette drainage had risen to 112% of
average.  It appeared to be a good snow year after all.</P>
<P>An intense cold spell during the week of the 29th resulted in very
low temperatures in the northern half of the state.  Many Willamette
Valley stations had lows in the teens for 4 or 5 consecutive days.  A
number of eastern Oregon locations had lows well below zero.  A moderate
storm on February 3rd dropped  rain on top of frozen soil and roads,
causing a major freezing rain episode throughout the Willamette Valley. 
Traffic was slowed or completely halted in many locations.  The hardest
hit was the Portland area, where icy conditions lasted for three days,
and which also experienced wind chill factors of -20F or lower.</P>
<P>Then on February 6th, a strong subtropical jet stream reached
Oregon.  This warm, very humid air mass, which originated near the
Equator in the western Pacific (near the Date Line), brought record
rainfall amounts to northern sections of the state.  Although such
subtropical storms are by no means rare, it is unuual for them to
persist with such intensity for such a long period of time (3-4 days). 
Among the more notable precipitation amounts were:</P>
<P>	Laurel Mountain Coast Range) 	8.20 inches in 24 hours; more than 23
inches in 3 days</P>
<P>	Corvallis	3.26 inches in 24 hours (new record for any day in
February; 108 years of record)</P>
<P>	Eugene	5.17 inches in 24 hours</P>
<P>	Newport 	7.71 inches in 3 days</P>
<P>In addition to the wet conditions, temperatures were unusally mild. 
In the Willamette Valley, daily minimum temperatures were higher than
normal maximum values for early February.  Nighttime lows in the
mid-50's were quite common.  The freezing level quickly moved upward, to
7,000 - 8,000 feet.  Rain fell even at mountain pass level.</P>
<P>The warm rain and air temperatures quickly began to erode the
snowpack.  Streams rose quickly on the 6th and 7th, reaching flood stage
in many locations.  At Vida on the McKenzie River, the flow jumped from
4,000 cfs on the 5th to over 20,000 cfs on the 6th.  Major and minor
tributaries throughout western Oregon jumped their banks.  Gradually the
levels in the major tributaries and the main stem rivers increased as
well.  At this point, water levels in the Willamette are well above
flood stage.  When peaks are reached (mostly Feb. 9 and 10), the levels
will rival or exceed those observed in 1964.</P>
<P>Comparisons with 1964 are inevitable, since that flood event is
considered the largest in this area since flood control dams were
completed in the 1950's.  Current flood levels are very close to those
observed in 1964.  The major difference is the extent: whereas the 1996
flood affected mostly northwestern Oregon, the 1964 event extended from
Northern California through Washington, and from the coast well into
Idaho.</P>
<P>The 1996 flood caps a most unusual weather year in Oregon.  A very
wet November, big wind storm in December, and the snow and ice of
January merely set the stage for the flood event.  Doubtless we will
look back on this as one of the most interesting (and damaging) winters
in the history of Oregon.</P>

<HR>
<FONT SIZE="+0.5">
SimRes is a simulation of the regulation of a reservoir.  This simulation takes into account several factors that regulators must consider in real life.  These are:
<P>
<PRE>
          Flood Prevention
          Water Quality
          Power Generation
          Navigation
          Recreation
</PRE>
<P>
In addition to this the simulation incorporates random weather patterns, so the user of SimRes cannot cheat by learning a specific pattern.  You must adapt to the changing conditions, such as, heavy rain, drought, etc.
<P>
The simulation is very easy to use, and it is written for IBM PC Compatible computers in the DOS environment.
<P>
To use the software, click on the icon below to download the software.  Place the file in some directory.  Then go to a DOS prompt and type simresx in the directory with the software.  The software program will expand, and will create three files.  To run the SimRes program, simply type simres in the directory that you placed the files.  There are directions in the simulation so that you will know how to use it. 
<P>
If you decide to download it, then send us some email telling us what you think.

<TITLE>The MODFLOW help file download page</TITLE>
</HEAD>  
<BODY><h1>The MODFLOW help file download page</h1>

Last modified on Wednesday, February 14, 1996 - 12:20:28 PM
<p>
The current version is 1.01<p>
The MODFLOW help file consists of several linked html documents. It has a table of contents, glossary, brief MODFLOW tutorial, MODFLOW reference guide, a list of online MODFLOW resources vendors. The <a href="http://aapg.geol.lsu.edu/mfh_rec.htm">internet resources page</a> of the MODFLOW help file is available separately.<p>

To use the help file, you would need to download the files to your local machine and access them there.  All the files are compressed into a single file to simplify the transfer.  Several compressed formats are available. <p>For <b>DOS/Windows</b> download <a href="ftp://aapg.geol.lsu.edu/pub/winston/mfh.zip">mfh.zip</a>.<p>
For Unix, Download <a href="ftp://aapg.geol.lsu.edu/pub/winston/mfh.tar">mfh.tar</a>.<p>
For  Macintosh download <a href="ftp://aapg.geol.lsu.edu/pub/winston/mfh.mac.bin">mfh.mac.bin</a>.<p>
The contents of all these files are identical. Put the file in it's own directory or folder and decompact it. The Macintosh file is self-extracting; the others aren't. Use your web browser to access the file mfhelp.htm (the table of contents). From there on, everything should be self-explanatory.<p>
I presume that all Windows users know how to use <a href="http://www.pkware.com/">PKZIP</a>  or <A HREF="http://www.winzip.com/winzip/">WinZip</A> to unzip .zip files and that UNIX users know how to use the command "tar xvf mfh.tar" to unpack tar files.<p>

One person has suggested putting the help file in Adobe "Portable Document Format" (PDF). Like html documents, this format can be accessed on any platform for which there is a PDF reader. Putting the "help file" in PDF format might decrease the required disk space and would make possible easy searching for any term on the entire document.  However, the free Adobe PDF readers have no equivalent of the "Back" button of a web browser.  That might present a problem for portions of the document that can be reached by many different links.  For example, the same formats for matricies in MODFLOW are used in many different modules and in many parts of each module.  It would be impractical to create links from the descriptions of the matrix formats back to each spot where that format is used. Please comment on which format you would prefer.<p>

The MODFLOW help file is shareware with a $25 registration fee.  Any proceeds will be used as described in the help file.  Registered users can get free updates as they become available.<p>

If the background in the contents page of the Modflow help file appears too dark, try deleting mfh-back.gif or replacing it with this new version.<p>

Earth System Science Community</H3></center>

<h4>Community:</h4>
Students of the Earth System Science Community (ESSC) completed their
investigations of the hydrosphere. Students have published reports
addressing the relationship of the solar cycle to El Nino, the hydrologic

cycle of the Brazilian rainforest, the relationship of deforestation to 
the
hydrologic cycle, and the relationship of El Nino and the gulf stream, to

name a few. <P>

The final versions of the Burnaby South Secondary and the Provincial 
School
for the Deaf homepages are now accessible via the ESSC website.<P>

Completed evaluation and selection process for new faculty for ESSC.
Applications reviews and interviews were completed. Schedules coordinated

and selections announced.<P>

Four new high school and two new university faculty from around the 
country
were selected for participation in the ESSC.<P>
<ul>
       <li><b> John Dempsey, Arkansas High School, Texarkana, AR<br>

      <li>  John Despres, Brunswick High School, Brunswick, ME

       <li> Brad Williamson, Olathe East High School, Olathe, KS

<li>        James Grisham, F.W. Ballou Senior High School, Washington, DC

    <li>  David Allard, PhD, Texarkana College & East Texas 
State University, Texarkana, Texas

     <li>   Arthur Few, Ph.D., Rice University, Houston, Texas</b></ul><p>

<h4>Curriculum:</h4>
Began redesigning the ESSC curriculum over the last month. Recognizing 
that
the science research community may face similar challenges in the
organization and presentation of their research, we have decided to
redesign the ESSC curriculum followingScience Strategy for the Earth
Observing System  (Asrar and Dozier 1994) as follows:<P>
<ul>
* Modeling the Earth System:<br> 
    <dd>            Physical Climate System, Hydrologic Cycle and
Biogeochemical Cycles<p>
* Energy Budget:<br>
<dd>                Clouds, Radiation, Water Vapor and Precipitation<P>
* Oceans:<br>
<dd>                Circulations, Productivity, and Air-Sea Exchange<P>
* Troposphere:<br>
<dd>                Greenhouse Gases and Tropospheric Chemistry<p>
* Land Surface:<br>
<dd>                Ecosystems and Hydrology<P>
* Stratosphere:<br>
<dd>                Ozone and Stratospheric Chemistry<p>
* Cryosphere:<br>
<dd>                Ice Sheets, Polar and Alpine Glaciers, and Seasonal 
Snow<p>
 * Volcanos and Climate Change</ul><p>

<dd>Asrar and Dozier's approach to organizing the science content provides an

opportunity to connect the education agenda of the ESSC with the research

agenda of the professional science community. In the ESSC, we are 
exploring
an instructional design which gives students the responsibility of
directing their own research and the capability to draw their own
conclusions based upon objective analysis of the evidence they find.<br>
<dd> A major thrust of our effort is to help students understand the value of 
the process of investigation; how to apply this process to understanding
complex, fuzzy phenomena; and the significance of objectivity in 
scientific research and communications.<br>
<dd>   However, we will not understand the strengths and weaknesses of 
this approach until we have documented and evaluated the experiences of a 
diverse pool of teachers and students over the next several years.<P>

Began developing the curriculum for the 1995 ESSC Summer Immersion
Workshop: <b>Investigating the Hydrologic Cycle</b>.<br> 
Please see: <a 
href="46.htm">http://www.ecologic.net/ESSCC/WS/</a>  
for more details.<br>
 The Workshop will be hosted by Dr. Hikmet Senay, Director of Visualization
Research, ECOlogic Corporation.<P>

The theme for this year's summer immersion workshop is the global
hydrologic cycle. In Science Strategy for the Earth Observing System, 
Asrar
and Dozier (AIP Press, 1994) describe the Earth system as two 
water-coupled
subsystems - the physical climate and biogeochemical cycles - linked by 
the
global hydrological cycle. Because the hydrologic cycle plays such a
significant, mediating role, an understanding of it is essential to
teaching and learning about the Earth system.<P>

The goal of each participant in the ESSC in the two week workshop is to
develop a current understanding of the Hydrologic cycle and the teaching
requirements for enabling student teams to conduct investigations. In 
Week
I, after an introduction to Earth system science and the hydrologic 
cycle,
we will focus on developing the skills required to analyze systems using
STELLA II models, explore and analyze remote-sensing data using
visualization tools and techniques, and publish findings on the Internet
using html. We will close this week by planning and setting goals for the

ESSC for the next year. <P>

In Week II, working in teams to plan and conduct investigations, we will
identify individual needs by applying the skills developed in Week I. We
will seek learning opportunities and develop assessment and evaluation
methods. We will close Week II by planning and setting goals for the 
ESSC.<P>

Met two times with Dr. Ted Engman, Head, Laboratory of Hydrospheric
Processes, Hydrological Sciences Branch (Code 974) to discuss
investigations during the workshop.<P>

<h4>Presentation, Meetings, Exhibits:</h4><p>
Dr. Hikmet Senay attended a Forum (workshop) on Research and Technology
Advances in Digital Libraries (ADL'95) which was held in McLean, Virginia

on May 15-17, 1995.<P>

May 31 -June 1, 1995<br>
Spring Meeting of the American Geophysical Union in Baltimore.<br>
F. Mahootian, M. Keeler and D. Mack, a Gonzaga College High School 
student,
presented two posters at  the AGU SPA Special Session (SA02):  "Spreading
the Word: Education and Outreach Activities in Space Physics and 
Aeronomy".<br>
<ul> The poster titles were, "The Earth System Science in High School
Education" and Mesosphere-Stratosphere Ozone Interactions at the South
Polar Vortex.</ul><P>

<h4>Up-Coming Events:</h4>

June 19 to July 1, 1995<br>
ESSC Summer Immersion Workshop.<br> 
Four new high school and two new university faculty will be introduced to

the ESSC and the Internet curriculum.<p>

July 11-14, 1995<br>
The IEEE 1995 International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium 
(IGARSS
'95), Firenza, Italy.<br> M.Keeler and F. Mahootian will be presenting a 
paper,
"Building the Earth System Science Community", as part of the Earth 
System
Science Education Initiatives component organized by Dr. Nahid Khazenie,
NASA.<P>

August 11-16, 1995 <br>
SIGGRAPH <br>
Will exhibit the ESSC in the SIG-KIDS section of the SIGGRAPH conference 
as
part of the Interactive Planet Exhibition.<P>

Earth system science is "a holistic approach to the study of the Earth 
that stresses investigations of the interactions among the Earth's 
components in order to explain Earth dynamics, Earth evolution and global 
change."<font size=2>1</font> The objective of the course is to (1) 
develop a collective understanding of the Earth system through 
collaborative investigations, and (2) develop the skills needed to 
practice Earth system science and contribute to the community of 
scientists. <P>

Earth system science is a new way of looking at the Earth and a new way 
of doing science.  Since the 1960's, global environmental change has been 
recognized as a source of potential risk to the well-being and integrity 
of both natural and human environments.  We have come to realize that 
human activity has introduced, especially over the last 150 years, 
significant and radical change in the atmosphere, hydrosphere, and 
biosphere of our planet.  With the new power gained by scientific and 
technological advances, we have also gained a new responsibility.  We 
have the power to literally change the world; we must ask ourselves if we 
understand the nature of the changes we have introduced. <P>

Earth system science is an interdisciplinary, applied science. The 
challenge to Earth system science is to develop the capability to 
understand those changes that will occur in the next decade to century, 
both naturally and in response to human activity.<font size=2>2</font> 
Students will work in teams and use many scientific tools, including 
chemistry, math, physics, modeling, data visualization and simulation. 
Prior experience with these tools is helpful, but not required. Each team 
will be responsible for managing every aspect of their research project: 
planning, gathering information, conducting experiments, maintaining a 
logbook, submitting project reports, making presentations and publishing 
their findings.<P>

<h3><a name="method">Method</a></H3>
The class will meet for 10 periods each cycle in the Earth System Science 
Laboratory, room 542, Forte Hall at 1:05 and 1:50  PM. Each project will 
begin with individual research supported by lectures, practical exercises 
and testing. Students will work in teams to complete projects which focus 
on some aspect of the Earth system. Each project follows a standard 
format which defines the subject of the project and the process of 
investigation. Several textbooks and other source material including 
journal articles, electronic texts and on-line scientific data will be 
used. Students will be required to apply computer software tools in every 
project. Students can and should use any resources necessary to carry out 
their investigations effectively and efficiently. <P>

<H3><a name="eval">Evaluation and Grading</a></H3>
<UL>
Science education for older students (high school) must also be grounded 
in direct experience. However, as they mature, students become 
increasingly able to understand "invisible", conceptual worlds of 
science, and to build more abstract understandings. They develop 
manipulative and cognitive skills that allow more complex experimentation 
and involve collection and analysis of quantitative as well as 
qualitative data. In addition to their ability to identify patterns 
within such data, students become increasingly able to formulate 
explanations for phenomena in terms of models and theories, many of them 
mathematically grounded. Secondary resources also become more important 
(and meaningful) sources of scientific information and ideas as students 
mature. <font size=2>3</font></ul><P> 

Performance and work quality are the criteria in evaluating students and 
teams.  <P>

<B>Performance 	65%</b><BR> 
<DD>	Team performance 		35%<BR>
<DD>	Testing			25%<BR>
<DD>	Individual performance 	5 %<BR>
<B>Work quality 	35%</b><p>

<B>Performance</b><br> 
Performance refers to the manner in which the project is carried out. 
Specifically, performance consists of the ability to develop and 
demonstrate skills; the  capacity to work with colleagues to accomplish 
project objectives; time-management, attention to detail, timeliness of 
deliverables (meeting project milestones with required interim and final 
products, i.e. turning in  homework, maintaining logs), etc.<P>

Performance reviews involve (1) an evaluation by teachers of a student or 
team performance, and (2) a meeting with teachers to discuss strengths 
and weaknesses and set achievable goals for improvement. <P>

<B>Team performance</B><br>
The key to practicing science effectively is exuding professional 
behavior and maintaining objectivity in research.  Team performance is 
closely linked to students capacity to work together to solve problems. 
Patience and effort in group activities (brainstorming, negotiation, 
writing, data analysis) facilitates collaboration, and consistent 
communication will transform problems into guideposts. Team performance 
reviews will be conducted twice every project. <P>

<B>Student performance</B><br> 
A team can only perform to the capacity of the individuals. Thus, 
individual contributions are fundamental to the success of any project. 
Students will be individually responsible for professional behavior and 
held accountable for the timeliness and quality of their work. Students, 
like scientists, will be responsible professionally and ethically to 
their peers, requiring self-management to meet the individual duties of 
collective responsibility. Individual student reviews will be conducted 
once every quarter. By managing time efficiently in an out of the 
laboratory, and staying focused on their work students will be able to 
meet their responsibilities effectively.<P>

<h3><a name="work">Work Quality</a></H3>
Logs, management reports, project reports, and presentations will be 
evaluated to determine the quality of work for each team over the course 
of a project. Teams will receive intermediate grades for all deliverables 
during a project and a final team grade for each project. Team members 
will receive the same grade for work quality. (Students will not be 
graded individually for the quality of their work. It is, therefore, 
recommended that all work be shared, revised and approved by the team 
before submission.)<P>


<B>Project Manager</B><br>
Each team will have a project manager who is responsible for  managing 
team relationships through communications: planning and scheduling, 
clarifying the needs and responsibilities of individuals and their team, 
articulating steps in the investigation, leading discussions and research 
sessions, reporting to teachers and other teams, and guiding the overall 
course of the project. Ultimately, the goal of the project manager is to 
assure that the team successfully meets the major milestones of the 
project, i.e. delivers on time. Project managers will critique their 
team's performance at the end of their project by providing a 
<I>management report</i> to the class. Every student will have the 
opportunity to serve as project manager.<P>

The chief responsibility of the project manager will be to manage 
communications and relationships among the members of their team, between 
the team and the teachers and among the teams. Project managers will meet 
at the beginning of each project for orientation at which time the team 
of project managers will review and refine research plans.<P>

<B>The Scientific Process</b><br>
Maintaining objectivity and intellectual honesty requires strict 
adherence to the methods of science and attentiveness to the process of 
scientific inquiry. Maintaining objectivity requires a commitment to a 
dialectic of making and testing hypothesis through experimentation; 
respect for the existing corpus of scientific thought; reliance on 
empirical evidence; and dealing cogently with ambiguity by identifying 
and articulating uncertainties and unknowns.<P>

Adherence to the scientific process requires fully documenting the 
meaningful components of a project: recording and dating activities, 
observations, minutes of meeting and discussions, articulating the 
strengths and weaknesses of the observations, identifying any 
assumptions, conducting thorough analyses and responsibly and clearly 
reporting findings. Scientific communication is characterized by clearly 
organized, accurate and thorough statement of findings which include 
evidence and supporting arguments.<P>

<B>Scientific Reporting</b><br>
Statements made in a science report should clearly convey the strengths 
and weaknesses of the arguments they present.  The limitation of every 
argument, theory, and, dataset and data source should be explicitly and 
unambiguously communicated.  The reader of such a report should be able 
to understand clearly which of the author's statements stand on solid 
ground, and also what parts of the argument are less certain <I>and 
why</I> in either case.<P>
<UL>
<LI> Statements should be supported  by evidence which includes data 
(whether gathered by the author or other researchers) and theories and 
models drawn from current scientific research.
<LI> Statements which have no supporting evidence should be clearly 
identified as assumptions.  
<LI> Sources of data, arguments, theories and models should be clearly 
cited according to bibliographical standards. </UL><P>

The standard of a science report can be found in any scientific 
professional journal.  Any article in <I>Scientific American</I>  (or 
<I>Science</I>, for the more adventurous) will provide an example of the 
quality and style of writing appropriate for scientific communication.  
Articles in the weekly journal Science News, although shorter and more 
"newsy",  are also fine examples of science writing. These journals, and 
other resources, are available in the ESS lab.<P>

Teams will be responsible for <B>three reports and presentations for 
every project: </B>(1) Research plan report and presentation, (2) 
Finished Project report and presentation, and (3) Management report and 
presentation.<P>

<B>Project Reports and Presentations</B><br>
Project reports and presentations should document the method and findings 
of a team's investigation. The project report will be prepared and 
submitted in two forms: (1) <I>hardcopy</i>  six typed pages, (2) 
<I>HTML</i >,  a hyperlinked, multimedia report on your findings, models, 
data, and images. (This will be explained in greater detail at a later 
date.) Additionally, one member from each team will present the team's 
report in a fifteen minute oral presentation. <P>

Reports will be evaluated by the clarity of findings and conclusions, 
articulation of strengths and weaknesses of findings, accuracy of 
content, appropriate use of references and sources (style), and  
conciseness. Project reports will be submitted on the due date for every 
project. Project reports completed and delivered after the expected due 
date will automatically receive a penalty of one letter grade. (No 
exceptions.)<P>

<B>Management Reports and Presentations</b><br>
Management reports are a two page typed critique of a team's project 
produced by project managers. Additionally, project managers will present 
their findings in a fifteen minute in-class presentation. Management 
reports should discuss the team's initial project  plan for carrying out 
the project and how the plan evolved over the course of the project. 
Project managers should indicate the strengths and weaknesses of the 
team's strategy, problems and solutions and make recommendation about how 
the team could improve their investigations. Management reports completed 
and delivered after the expected due date will automatically receive a 
penalty of one letter grade. (No exceptions.)<P> 

<B>Project Logs </b><br>
Each team will maintain a daily log.  Logs will be the primary means of 
documenting a team's progress on their project. All activities should be 
clearly recorded. This may include minutes of meeting and discussions, 
observations, addresses of data sources, procedures for using data 
analysis software, phone numbers of scientists, key references and page 
numbers, quotes and sources, etc. Students will rely heavily on 
information contained in the logs in the creation of project and 
management reports. Teams will also refer to their logs extensively 
throughout the year because of the cumulative nature of the course. In 
this way, logs are essential to the effective management of time and 
information and directly affect team performance.  Log entries are to be 
made daily via the ESSC webserver.  The entries are automatically 
dated.<P>

Both team performance and work quality will be taken into account in the 
evaluation of logs and a separate grade given for each. The frequency of 
recordings will affect the team performance grade. The quality will be 
determined by the organization, thoroughness and clarity of work.<P>


<B>Teamwork</b><br>
In this course the instructor is  explorer,  guide, teacher, player and 
coach.  Feel free to pull us into your work: we want to help you in any 
way possible.  Questions about any aspect of the course or the subject 
matter are always welcome. <i>BON VOYAGE!!</i><P>

	<dd>In our efforts to create a high school curriculum for Earth System 
Science (ESS), we 
recognized that the conventional methods and tools by which science has 
been taught in the 
classroom, such as lecture and textbook, and the methods and tools by 
which science is really 
practiced are largely incongruent. There is a discontinuity between how 
students are supposed to 
learn in the classroom and how they are expected to work and communicate 
in their professional 
communities. In many ways, this discontinuity characterizes the systemic 
problems in science 
education today.<P>
<dd>	Earth System Science (ESS) is a holistic approach to the study of 
the Earth that stresses 
investigations of the interactions among the Earth's components in order 
to explain Earth 
dynamics, Earth evolution and global change. The challenge to Earth 
system science is to develop 
the capability to understand those changes that will occur in the next 
decade to century, both 
naturally and in response to human activity. <P>
<dd>	ESS, by design, intensifies the significance of scientific 
community-building. Through 
personal interviews with scientists involved in the U.S. Global Change 
Research Program, we 
came to understand that Earth system science serves as a model for 
interdisciplinary process study 
and communication. The tools used by scientists in investigation include: 
networked scientific 
computing facilities; distributed, remotely-sensed data; visualization 
and modeling tools; a 
standardized, widely-distributed publication environment; and a community 
of critically thinking 
peers.  The ESS model of interdisciplinary study and communication 
enables a broadening of 
academic perspective in the science community-at-large, and requires a 
higher degree of 
professional-social dialogue and information exchange than previously 
needed.<P>
<dd>	In May of 1993, ECOlogic was awarded a contract by NASA Space Data 
and Computing 
Division through the High Performance Computing and Communications 
Program.  Under that 
two-year contract, we worked closely with NASA scientists and staff to 
develop ECOlogica, a 
multimedia Earth System Science curriculum using NASA computational 
resources delivered over 
the Internet using the World Wide Web (WWW).  <P>
<dd>	ECOlogica  set forth the foundation for our Earth system science 
curriculum. Our 
instructional and curricular design approaches and methods of getting 
advice and support from 
researchers and data providers, which we will discuss later, were tested 
and refined in our pilot 
classes. However, we had a responsibility to figure out how to scale our 
classroom program, and 
eventually, help it survive. The curriculum had to be tested and adapted 
by other teachers and 
students and the needs of their local classroom environment had to be 
addressed in the design and 
implementation of the curriculum. Our strategy was to build a community 
devoted to enabling 
students to investigate the Earth system. We would use networked 
computing and 
telecommunication technologies to deliver support services for community 
activities. Our goal was 
to develop an application on the World Wide Web which would enable any 
teacher, student or 
school connected to the Internet to begin investigating the Earth system 
quickly, easily and 
inexpensively .<P>

<h3>ESS Community Objectives</h3>

<dd>	The Earth System Science Community is intended to provide on-going 
collaboration, 
professional development, and problem-solving in order to:<br>
<ul><li> enable students and teachers to investigate the Earth system;
<li> develop a collective understanding of the Earth system;
<li> enable students to learn process thinking, scientific method, 
collaborative problem-solving, 
model-building and scientific communication;
<li> develop a Earth System Science curriculum and support system over 
the Internet. </ul><P>

<h3>Community Development</h3>

<dd>	<a href="2.htm">Our community </a> development 
program 
focuses on supporting teachers. They are the primary entrepreneurial 
venue for introducing change 
in the classroom.  Our community development program addresses teacher 
professional 
development, enhancing teaching and learning in the classroom, 
facilitating collaboration and 
mentoring, and enabling team investigation in the classroom. <P>
	
<h3>Curriculum Development</h3>
<dd>	In our approach, curriculum development involves a variety of 
participants and requires 
networked scientific computing facilities and a connection to the 
Internet.  Curriculum development 
results in a process, rather than a product which can be shrink-wrapped 
and disseminated. This 
process must be directed, structured and supported as the community 
grows, in order to enable 
adaptation and evolution. Student investigation is the central process 
around which all other 
processes are organized and optimized. In this sense, curriculum refers 
to an integrated, 
streamlined and standardized set of processes (and sub-processes) to 
enable student teams and 
supporting faculty to collaborate, investigate, and access a wide range 
of content topics. (Laurel, 
1990) These processes define and schedule multi-tiered activities at the 
macro and micro scale. For 
example, curriculum processes not only structure and schedule human 
communications and human 
interactions with tools and resources, but are also embedded in software 
functionality. <P>
<dd>	This approach recognizes that technology is a tool and should be 
applied to achieve a 
specific goal, serving human needs to work and communicate. However, this 
approach also 
recognizes that the challenges of introducing technology to the classroom 
have more to do with 
human dynamics--how people relate to each other, the use of data, and the 
application of tools--
than with the functionality and capability of technology. Thus, in order 
to bring a scaled-down 
version of ESS into the classroom and to scale up from the classroom to 
the community requires a 
rethinking, a re-engineering, of curriculum development processes and 
human relationships. 
(Stedman, 1992) This requires inductive reasoning about instructional 
design and recognition that 
instructional design is a highly interactive, collaborative process 
involving all stakeholders. 
(Hammer, 1993) <P>
<dd>	Following the model of the Earth as a system of interacting 
subsystems presented in 
NASA's Earth System Science: A Closer View  (NASA, 1988), the <a 
href="17.htm">ESSC curriculum</a> consists of several team 
projects. The first and the 
last project focus on investigating and defining the Earth as a system, 
reflecting the syncretic nature 
of the course. The other projects are categorized according to Earth 
subsystems: atmosphere, 
hydrosphere, and biosphere. The ESSC Curriculum maps out a collection of 
major themes which 
highlight Earth system phenomena, such as the radiation budget, ozone 
distribution, cloud 
formation, the water cycle, the carbon cycle, and El Nino to name a few. 
<P>
<dd>	These themes cross Earth subsystem boundaries and, therefore, 
require a systems approach 
to understand. For example, El Nino is an air-sea phenomenon involving 
the physical dynamics of 
the atmosphere and the hydrosphere. For each project theme, students must 
address fundamental 
understandings of biology, chemistry, physics and math in their findings.  
These understandings 
might include the interaction of energy and matter, conservation of 
energy, wave theory, algebra, 
respiration, photosynthesis and others.  <P>
<dd>	The scope of the curriculum is limited to timescales of decades to 
centuries in which Earth 
processes are dominated by the physical climate system and the 
biogeochemical cycles, with 
human activities playing an increasing role in both. This presents Earth 
processes in the context of 
a human lifetime.  <P>
<dd>	The context of a human lifetime is appropriate for considering human 
and cultural values, 
the impacts of human activity, and policy-making. <P>
<dd>	Students conduct investigations in teams, relying on collaboration 
and peer education. The 
teams are guided by a process of investigation which organizes classroom 
activities. Team 
activities include background research, hypothesis formulation and 
qualitative modeling, 
background reporting, data sourcing and research, data visualization and 
quantitative modeling, 
and scientific communication, which consists of three steps: oral 
presentations and peer review, 
editing, and publishing scientific findings on the World-Wide Web 
(WWW).<p>
<dd>	Students use remote-sensing data from several sources in a variety 
of formats acquired 
primarily over the Internet. Students derive their own information 
products from remote-sensing 
data through visualization, manipulation, editing and layout (Excel, NCSA 
Collage, Spyglass 
Transform); apply the information to their quantitative models (STELLA 
II) (Hayes 1993); and 
create hypermedia scientific reports published on the WWW by integrating 
their information 
products, models and textual descriptions.<P>
<dd>	Students are evaluated for their individual performance (35%), team 
performance (35%) 
and their work quality (30%). Students are provided with a detailed 
checklist of requirements for 
performance, presentations and publications at the beginning of each 
project. <P>

<h3>Learning 
Fundamental Principles</h3> <ul>
Four components are involved in this stage: Background Research, Lecture, 
Exercises, and Discussion.  Each of these four activities serves to 
enhance students knowledge and understanding of a particular problem in 
order to formulate a research plan.</ul>
<p>

<h3>Research 
Planning</h3>
<ul>During this stage of the process, students formulate a hypothesis, make 
a qualitative model, write a background report, and 
integrate this information into a research plan.</ul>
<p>

<h3>Data Visualization</h3>
<ul>During this phase students collect data from relevant sources, visualize 
and interpret the results using graphing and visualization software.</ul>
<p>

<h3>Scientific Communications</h3>
<ul>In the concluding phase of the project, students present their work in a 
seminar, discussing their research and results. 
Finally, students will produce a hypermedia report of their research 
findings.</ul><P>

<b>Overview</b><P>

<DD>	This report is intended to introduce the members of the National 
Advisory Panel (NAP) to the Earth System Science Community, Year I.  The 
original motivations for the ESSC are reviewed to provide a context for 
the goals, objectives, and project management strategy.  Community, 
curriculum and system development is addressed. Finally, a summary of the 
ESSC Year I accomplishments, challenges and changes is provided.<P>

<B>ESSC Background</b><P>

<DD>	Scientific community-building began in western culture in Europe in 
the 17th century and is recognized as playing a major role in the 
scientific revolution.  The scientific societies and their journals 
provided individual scientists with a forum for discussing and 
criticizing old theories and new discoveries, sharing ideas and 
cooperative work.  Scientific societies catalyzed the advancement of 
science by cultivating dialogue, providing quality control through peer 
review, and disseminating proven innovations of individuals.  
Fundamentally, these organizations facilitated learning through 
communication.  <BR>
<DD>	The apex of the scientific revolution is marked by the emergence of 
two great national scientific societies and their professional scientific 
journals. The Royal Society of London for the Promotion of Natural 
Knowledge (1662) published Philosophical Transactions and the Acadmie 
des Sciences of Paris (1666) published Mmoires. (Hall, 1981)<BR>
<DD>	In the three-hundred and fifty years since the scientific revolution 
the idea of a scientific community has been well articulated and is 
considered commonplace today. (Kuhn, 1977) The American Geophysical Union 
is a prime example of the success and significance of these communities. 
<BR>
<DD>	However, scientific communities seem to target or are only 
accessible to post-graduate researchers. Students and teachers in 
elementary, high school and undergraduate science education have somehow 
missed out on this enabling sociological model and the benefits of 
organizational development in this way. <BR>
<DD>	In our efforts to create a high school curriculum for Earth System 
Science (ESS), we recognized that the conventional methods and tools by 
which science has been taught in the classroom, such as lecture and 
textbook, and the methods and tools by which science is really practiced 
are largely incongruent. There is a discontinuity between how students 
are supposed to learn in the classroom and how they are expected to work 
and communicate in their professional communities. In many ways, this 
discontinuity encapsulates the systemic problems in education. <BR>
<DD>	Earth System Science (ESS) is a holistic approach to the study of 
the Earth that stresses investigations of the interactions among the 
Earth's components in order to explain Earth dynamics, Earth evolution 
and global change. The challenge to Earth system science is to develop 
the capability to understand those changes that will occur in the next 
decade to century, both naturally and in response to human activity. <BR>

<DD>	ESS, by design, intensifies the significance of scientific 
community-building. Through personal interviews with scientists involved 
in the U.S. Global Change Research Program, we came to understand that 
Earth system science serves as a model for interdisciplinary process 
study and communication. The tools used by scientists in investigation 
include: networked scientific computing facilities; distributed, 
remotely-sensed data; visualization and modeling tools (Wolff and Yaeger 
1992); a standardized, widely-distributed publication environment; and a 
community of critically thinking peers.  The ESS model of 
interdisciplinary study and communication enables a broadening of 
academic perspective in the science community-at-large, and requires a 
higher degree of professional-social dialogue and information exchange 
than previously needed.<BR>
<Dd>	In May of 1993, ECOlogic was awarded a contract by NASA Space Data 
and Computing Division through the High Performance Computing and 
Communications Program.  Under that two-year contract, we worked closely 
with NASA scientists and staff to develop <I>ECOlogica</I>, a multimedia 
Earth System Science curriculum using NASA computational resources 
delivered over the Internet using the World Wide Web (WWW).  In support 
of this effort, NASA Science Internet installed a DS1 high-speed 
connection to the Internet at our host institution, Gonzaga College High 
School, operating at 1.544 Mbps.<BR>
<DD>	<I>ECOlogica</I>  set down the foundation for our Earth system 
science curriculum. Our instructional and curricular design approaches 
and methods of getting advice and support from researchers and data 
providers, which we will discuss later, were tested and refined in our 
pilot classes. However, we had a responsibility to figure out how to 
scale our classroom program, and eventually, help it survive. The 
curriculum had to be tested and adapted by other teachers and students 
and the needs of their local classroom environment had to be addressed in 
the design and implementation of the curriculum. Our strategy was to 
build a community devoted to enabling students to investigate the Earth 
system. We would use networked computing and telecommunication 
technologies to deliver support services for community activities. Our 
goal was to develop an application on the World Wide Web which would 
enable any teacher, student or school connected to the Internet to begin 
investigating the Earth system quickly, easily and inexpensively .<P>

<B>ESS Community Objectives</b><P>

<DD>	The Earth System Science Community is intended to provide on-going 
collaboration, professional development, and problem-solving in order 
to:<BR>
<LI> enable students and teachers to investigate the Earth system;
<LI> develop a collective understanding of the Earth system;
<LI> enable students to learn process thinking, scientific method, 
collaborative problem-solving, model-building and scientific 
communication;
<LI> develop a Earth System Science curriculum and support system over 
the Internet. <P>

<B>Research and Funding</b><P>

<DD>	In July, 1994, ECOlogic won an award through the NASA HPCC CAN 
"Public Use of Earth and Space Science Data Over the Internet" to build 
an Earth System Science (ESS) community and an on-line curriculum.  The 
ESS Community Curriculum Testbed is a threeyear $1.1 million project 
which will include 12 high schools and six universities from around the 
country.  <BR>
<DD> 	Our plan for managing the testbed focuses on community, curriculum 
and system development. (Barrett, 1989) We expect this approach will 
enable the community to scale and enable us to sustain the development of 
the curriculum. The plan is to:<BR>
<LI> design and refine a summer immersion workshop and professional 
enhancement services, which are provided during the academic year, with 
the testbed community;
<LI> design and refine the classroom and community curriculum with the 
testbed community;
<LI> develop commercially-viable, just-in-time education services over 
the Internet for high schools and universities.<P>

<B>Community Development</b><P>

<DD>	Our community development program focuses on supporting teachers. 
They are the primary entrepreneurial venue for introducing change in the 
classroom.  Our community development program addresses teacher 
professional development, enhancing teaching and learning in the 
classroom, facilitating collaboration and mentoring, and enabling team 
investigation in the classroom. <BR>
<DD>	NASA has provided funding and support for a summer immersion 
workshop for participating faculty.  Additionally, NASA has provided 
funding for participating schools to defray the costs of releasing 
participating faculty from one course for the first year of the their 
participation.<BR>
<DD>	In our first year, the ESS Community includes six high schools and 
two universities. Currently five high schools and two universities are 
participating in this 3 year NASA funded program.  Five high schools are 
located in the US, including, Pittsburg High School, Pittsburg, CA, Model 
Secondary School for the Deaf, Washington, D.C., Robertson, H.S., Las 
Vegas, New Mexico, Nerinx Hall, St. Louis, MO and the host institution, 
Gonzaga College High School, Washington, D.C. The sixth high school is 
Canadian: Burnaby South, Burnaby, British Columbia. Opportunities exist 
for four new high schools and two universities each year for the next two 
years.<BR>
<DD>	The two universities participating in the program are PennState 
University, Earth System Science Center and the U.S. Naval Academy, 
Department of Oceanography. <BR>
<DD>	The demographics of the program participants are diverse. Four high 
schools are public, two of which serve the hearing impaired.  Ethnicity 
is mixed in all schools serving rural, suburban and urban populations. 
Students enrolled in the ESS classes were handpicked in a few cases, but 
otherwise enrollment was open to 11th and 12th graders. Class sizes vary 
from 8 to 30 students per class.<BR>
<DD>	Over twenty scientists at NASA, NOAA, and other public science 
agencies, user support staff at the data active archive centers (DAAC) 
regularly support the ESS Community. They help us make the research, 
data, and applications available to the community in the appropriate 
technical and scientific context throughout the development process.  
NASA supports us through many different channels, including HPCC, and  
Mission to Planet Earth, Earth Sciences Directorate,  and the EOS Project 
Science Office. We are also preparing to build a database of mentors and 
an automated system to match classrooms and scientists with the help of 
the American Geophysical Union, NASA and NOAA. <BR>
<DD>	The ESS Community has on-going cooperation with the Earth System 
Science Educators, a NASA funded group of university faculty dedicated to 
curriculum development. In 1991, the Universities Space Research 
Association and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration 
initiated the Cooperative University-based Program in Earth System 
Science Education (ESSE) that linked faculty from twenty-two U.S. 
universities with one another and with NASA scientists to accelerate the 
development of undergraduate curricula in Earth System Science. <P>

<B>Curriculum Development</b><p>

<DD>	NASA has provided funding for developing the Earth System Science 
Community Curriculum, a World Wide Web application which integrates 
widely-distributed information and communication services in support of 
classroom activities.  (Please see: www.circles.org)<BR>
<DD>	In our approach, curriculum development involves a variety of 
participants and requires networked scientific computing facilities and a 
connection to the Internet.  Curriculum development results in a process, 
rather than a product which can be shrink-wrapped and disseminated. This 
process must be directed, structured and supported as the community 
grows, in order to enable adaptation and evolution. Student investigation 
is the central process around which all other processes are organized and 
optimized. In this sense, curriculum refers to an integrated, streamlined 
and standardized set of processes (and sub-processes) to enable student 
teams and supporting faculty to collaborate, investigate, and access a 
wide range of content topics. (Laurel, 1990) These processes define and 
schedule multi-tiered activities at the macro and micro scale. For 
example, curriculum processes not only structure and schedule human 
communications and human interactions with tools and resources, but are 
also embedded in software functionality. <BR>
<Dd>	This approach recognizes that technology is a tool and should be 
applied to achieve a specific goal, serving human needs to work and 
communicate. However, this approach also recognizes that the challenges 
of introducing technology to the classroom have more to do with human 
dynamics--how people relate to each other, the use of data, and the 
application of tools--than with the functionality and capability of 
technology. Thus, in order to bring a scaled-down version of ESS into the 
classroom and to scale up from the classroom to the community requires a 
rethinking, a re-engineering, of curriculum development processes and 
human relationships. (Stedman, 1992) This requires inductive reasoning 
about instructional design and recognition that instructional design is a 
highly interactive, collaborative process involving all stakeholders. 
(Hammer, 1993)<BR> 
<DD>	Following the model of the Earth as a system of interacting 
subsystems presented in NASA's Earth System Science: A Closer View  
(NASA, 1988), the ESSC curriculum consists of several team projects. The 
first and the last project focus on investigating and defining the Earth 
as a system, reflecting the syncretic nature of the course. The other 
projects are categorized according to Earth subsystems: atmosphere, 
hydrosphere, and biosphere. The ESSC Curriculum maps out a collection of 
major themes which highlight Earth system phenomena, such as the 
radiation budget, ozone distribution, cloud formation, the water cycle, 
the carbon cycle, and El Nino to name a few. <BR>
<DD>	These themes cross Earth subsystem boundaries and, therefore, 
require a systems approach to understand. For example, El Nino is an 
air-sea phenomenon involving the physical dynamics of the atmosphere and 
the hydrosphere. For each project theme, students must address 
fundamental principles of biology, chemistry, physics and math in their 
findings.  These principles might include the interaction of energy and 
matter, conservation of energy, wave theory, algebra, respiration, 
photosynthesis and others. (NRC, 1993)  <BR>
<DD>	The scope of the curriculum is limited to timescales of decades to 
centuries in which Earth processes are dominated by the physical climate 
system and the biogeochemical cycles, with human activities playing an 
increasing role in both. This presents Earth processes in the context of 
a human lifetime. (NASA, 1988) <BR>
<DD>	The context of a human lifetime is appropriate for considering human 
and cultural values, the impacts of human activity, and policy-making. 
<BR>
<DD>	Students conduct investigations in teams, relying on collaboration 
and peer education. The teams are guided by a process of investigation 
which organizes classroom activities. Team activities include background 
research, hypothesis formulation and qualitative modeling, background 
reporting, data sourcing and research, data visualization and 
quantitative modeling, and scientific communication, which consists of 
three steps: oral presentations and peer review, editing, and publishing 
scientific findings on the World-Wide Web (WWW).<BR>
<DD>	Students use remote-sensing data from several sources in a variety 
of formats acquired primarily over the Internet. Students derive their 
own information products from remote-sensing data through visualization, 
manipulation, editing and layout (Excel, NCSA Collage, etc.); apply the 
information to their quantitative models (STELLA II) (Hayes 1993); and 
create hypermedia scientific reports published on the WWW by integrating 
their information products, models and textual descriptions.<BR>
<DD>	Students are evaluated for their individual performance (35%), team 
performance (35%) and their work quality (30%). (Flagg, 1990) Students 
are provided with a detailed checklist of requirements for performance, 
presentations and publications at the beginning of each project. <P>

<B>System Development</b><P>

<DD>	The objectives of our system development plan are to create and 
refine a communication and information system, a transparent user 
interface (Michon, 1992), and a community memory (Ackerman 1994) to serve 
as a knowledgebase for problems solved and lessons learned. Our system 
development plan follows an iterative design method. (Hammer and Champy, 
1993) The system weaves together the curriculum and the community of 
users and follows their reorganization schedule (approximately one time 
each year). <Br>
<Dd>	We collect data on interactions across the community. We identify 
recurring interactions and processes. We then define community, 
curriculum and system needs, develop the system and graphic user 
interface, and, finally, test, evaluate and optimize the system (Diehl & 
Norman, 1988; Marchionini & Crane, 1994; Shniederman, 1992).<BR>
<DD>	Our initial system design included the following features:<BR>
<LI> student publications over the Internet
<LI> automated student and teacher investigation logs 
<LI> a task and interactions scheduler for students, teams, teachers and 
mentors (Tufte, 1990)
<LI> project and team management planner
<LI> easy access to remotely-sensed data and analysis tools
<LI> tutorials and examples: application of data visualization, image 
analysis and system modeling software tools
<LI> integrated evaluation and grading
<LI> easy access to mentoring, advice and help over the Internet<BR>
<DD>	We actively seek to integrate existing tools and research to advance 
the design, performance and functionality of the system. We are 
coordinating our efforts with NASA and USGCRP's human and technical 
infrastructure, especially EOSDIS. <P>

<B>Accomplishments, Changes and Challenges</b><P>

<DD>	The community has made extensive use of NASA and other federal 
agency resources and publications. For example, students used NASA 
technical report summaries, full reports, NASA Facts, and electronic 
brochures via WWW. <BR>
<DD>	Students have also used archived data products from many agencies 
and universities, including: ERBE, ISCCP, SAGEII, UARS HRDI, TOMS, 
CAC-SST, TOPEX/Posiden, TOGA, Ocean Flux and many others.  Students have 
produced and published more than ten new reports.<BR>
<DD>	Our extensive interaction with NASA DAACs and other data archives in 
our search, retrieval and preparation of data for use in the ESSC has put 
us in an interesting position between the data provision infrastructure 
and educational users. We are beginning to define generalizable processes 
in the provision of data to the education community. These observations 
will enable us to make recommendations to NASA and other providers about 
how to supply data. This has helped us to define our responsibilities as 
an application and curriculum developer, in terms of adding value to data 
and data products, distribution, and support in and out of the classroom. 
<BR>
<DD>	We have also included two intelligent search tools under development 
in government-funded programs: NASA JSC's ILIAD and the USGCRP's Assisted 
Search for Knowledge (ASK). 	<BR>
<DD>	The principal challenge to conducting an educational investigation 
of this nature (how do we enable students to learn about the Earth 
system?) is the diversity in school infrastructure and Internet access. 
We assumed at the beginning of the project that the system development 
effort would begin with the interconnection of Earth System Science labs 
at participating schools. Our intention was to explore curriculum 
development with schools which had comparable local information 
infrastructure and a synchronous connection to the Internet. However, 
participants were selected prior to competing for funding in the NASA 
program. Funding to provide local infrastructure at participating schools 
was included in the proposal to NASA but unsupported in the award. We 
have, therefore, adopted a strategy of developing a "bandwidth scalable" 
curriculum which enable users to access the same information with 
different speed connections. (Kahin, 1992) Despite our achievements in 
this area, we have often resorted to FTP and Fedex delivery of 
documentation in order to support daily classroom activities because of 
the lack of student access to information infrastructure.<BR>
<DD>	We expected teachers and students to use the software tools and data 
resources more frequently and systematically. We also expected teachers 
to collaborate and converse on their own more frequently. We realized 
that our selection process needed to identify teachers who are 
comfortable and experienced with an open-inquiry curriculum and that our 
professional development and training needs to extend to mentors, 
especially scientists and graduate students who interact directly with 
students about their work.<BR>
<DD>	For monthly reports of activities related to community, curriculum 
and systems development for Fall 1995 and Spring 1995, please refer to 
Appendix I and II, respectively.<BR>
<DD>In terms of the curriculum design, we have learned that it is 
extremely difficult to organize the content with a systems approach, 
i.e., the Earth regarded as unified system of interacting components. 
There are many different approaches currently being implemented which we 
have reviewed. Each has its advantages and disadvantages. We have 
reviewed approaches which present ESS ideas as issues or problems, eg. 
the global warming problem, ozone depletion. Another widely-used approach 
is to use data and the data collection process to drive the science 
investigations. Yet another approach is to follow a technology imperative 
in which the goal to teach software skills and the applications of 
technology guides the science. This approach uses Earth-related case 
studies to provide meaningful examples about how technology can be 
applied for problem-solving and scientific investigation.<BR>
<DD>	Recognizing that the science research community itself might face 
similar challenges in the organization and presentation of their 
research, beginning with the Summer Immersion Workshop (please see 
Appendix III), we have decided to redesign the ESSC curriculum 
followingScience Strategy for the Earth Observing System  (Asrar and 
Dozier 1994) as follows:
<UL>
<LI> Modeling the Earth System: <BR>
		Physical Climate System, Hydrologic Cycle and Biogeochemical Cycles<BR>

<LI> Energy Budget:<BR>
		Clouds, Radiation, Water Vapor and Precipitation<BR>
<LI> Oceans:<BR>
		Circulations, Productivity, and Air-Sea Exchange<BR>
<LI> Troposphere:<BR>
		Greenhouse Gases and Tropospheric Chemistry<BR>
<LI> Land Surface: <BR>
		Ecosystems and Hydrology<BR>
<LI> Stratosphere:<BR>
		Ozone and Stratospheric Chemistry<BR>
<LI> Cryosphere:<BR>
		Ice Sheets, Polar and Alpine Glaciers, and Seasonal Snow<BR>
<LI> Volcanos and Climate Change<P></ul>

<DD>	Asrar and Dozier's approach to organizing the science content 
provides an opportunity to connect the education agenda of the ESSC with 
the research agenda of the professional science community. In the ESSC, 
we are exploring an instructional design which gives students the 
responsibility of directing their own research and the capability to draw 
their own conclusions based upon objective analysis of the evidence they 
find. A major thrust of our effort is to help students understand the 
value of the process of investigation; how to apply this process to 
understanding complex, fuzzy phenomena; and the significance of 
objectivity in scientific research and communications.   However, we will 
not understand the strengths and weaknesses of this approach until we 
have documented and evaluated the experiences of a diverse pool of 
teachers and students over the next several years.<P>

Gonzaga sports a rich science curriculum on the forefront of information 
and technology. In fact, you wouldn't be reading this right now if it 
wasn't for the Earth System Science portion of the Gonzaga Curriculum. At 
this time, Earth System Science (student reports as well as a tutrial on 
what it's about and links to other ESS sites), Chemistry and 
Physics(tutorial and links) are online. I hope to bring student-based 
reports to the Physics and Chemistry sections in the future and maybe 
even create a Biology section. <i>maybe</i>

"The phase change of water between its gaseous, liquid and solid states 
involves 
storage and release of latent heat, so it influences atmospheric 
circulation and globally 
redistributes both water and heat.  Water's efficiency as a solvent also 

proves critical 
to biogeochemical processes.  The hydrologic cycle is the integrating 
process for the 
fluxes of water, energy, and chemical elements among components of the 
Earth 
system (National Research Council, 1991)."

<H2>Introduction</H2>

The theme for this year's summer immersion workshop is the global
hydrologic cycle. In <A 
HREF="http://spso.gsfc.nasa.gov/sci_strategy/Contents.html">Science 
Strategy for the Earth Observing System</A>, Asrar
and Dozier (1994) describe the Earth system as two water-coupled
subsystems - the physical climate and biogeochemical cycles - linked by 
the
global hydrological cycle. Because the hydrologic cycle plays such a
significant, mediating role, an understanding of it is essential to
teaching and learning about the Earth system.
<P>
<H2>Overview</H2>

The goal of each participant in the ESSC in the two week workshop is to
develop a current understanding of the Hydrologic cycle and the teaching
requirements for enabling student teams to conduct investigations. In 
Week
I, after an introduction to Earth system science and the hydrologic 
cycle,
we will focus on developing the skills required to analyze systems using
STELLA II models, explore and analyze remote-sensing data using
visualization tools and techniques, and publish findings on the Internet
using HTML. We will close this week by planning and setting goals for the


ESSC for the next year. 
<P>
In Week II, working in teams to plan and conduct investigations, we will
identify individual needs by applying the skills developed in Week I. We
will seek learning opportunities and develop assessment and evaluation
methods. We will close Week II by planning and setting goals for the ESSC


Year 2 participants for the next year.

ALIGN=right VSPACE=20 HSPACE=20><P>

	Earth's radiation budget is a vital part of the climate system. 
Absorption of solar radiation and heat lost to space determines, in large 
port, global temperatures and drives atmospheric winds and ocean 
currents. The amount of solar radiation absorbed by Earth depends largely 
on how much is reflected by clouds and aerosols. Clouds and certain 
active gases (called greenhouse gases) control the loss of heat from 
Earth.<P>

	The most influential greenhouse gas is water vapor, controlled primarily 
by natural atmospheric processes. Human activities, such as burning 
fossil fuels, hove increased concentrations of other greenhouse gases, 
including carbon dioxide. How increases in greenhouse gases have, and 
will, change the climate depends on their effects on natural radiation 
budget processes. Clouds have both warming and cooling effects that can 
change the radiation budget nearly as much as the warming from increased 
greenhouse gases. Climate modelers now regard clouds as the largest 
source of uncertainty in determining climate change associated with 
increases of greenhouse gases.<P>

	Clouds and water vapor also play a major role in the atmospheric 
hydrological cycle. We must understand global hydrological cycles to 
determine future distributions of clouds and water vapor and their 
effects on radiation. Atmospheric water evaporates from land and oceans 
and returns to the surface through precipitation. Evaporation cools the 
Earth's surface, while condensation of water vapor into precipitation 
heats the atmosphere. These effects could be as important as radiation 
for atmospheric and oceanic motions. Patterns of precipitation on land 
influence natural vegetation, crops, drinking water, and floods.<P>

<IMG SRC="" ALIGN=left VSPACE=20 HSPACE=20><P>

Mean Effective Cloud Cover for June 1988:  Average cloud cover is greater 
than 60 percent for white areas, decreasing with darker shades to less 
than 10 percent.<P>

	The EOS will enable scientists to observe key parameters of Earth's 
radiation budget and atmospheric water cycle. Instruments will survey 
both large-scale, global features and fine-scale features such as 
particular cloud banks or land types. Today, NASA missions such as 
Earth's Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE) and weather satellite services 
of many nations help EOS teams of atmospheric scientists, meteorologists, 
and hydrologists build advanced models for radiation, the water cycle, 
and climate prediction. These and other new predictive tools will improve 
our understanding of the role of clouds, radiation, and precipitation in 
global climate change, and allow us to assess their impacts on 
agricultural and industrial development.<P>

<B>Hurricanes</B><br>  
Hurricanes embody the overwhelming power of nature.  The amount of damage 
caused by these large, violent weather systems can prove catastrophic; 
yet, nature's fury can be mitigated to the extent possible through the 
advanced warning provided by meteorological satellites.  Providing storm 
development and tracking data, the Meteosat-3 satellite operated by the 
European Space Agency for the European Organisation for the Exploitation 
of Meteorological
Satellites (EUMETSAT) made this observation of Hurricane Andrew the 
costliest natural disaster ever to befall the U S-as it passed over the 
west coast of southern Florida on August 24, 1992.  Provided by: EUMETSAT

<B>Severe Storm Monitoring</B><br> 
When complementary data sets are combined, scientists are able to gain

from the European Space Agency's ERS-1 satellite have been superimposed 
onto a National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration's 
Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite-7 (GOES-7) infrared 
storm image to provide a cross-section through Hurricane Andrew of wind 
speed and wave height. Geostationary orbit enables the repetitive 
observations needed to detect and track severe weather, since payloads 
can continuously monitor the full Earth disk.  Data such as these aid in 
forecasting sea conditions and in estimating possible damage to land from 
approaching storms. Provided by: ESA and NOAA (Mallard Space Science 
Laboratory, James Rennell Centre, and University of Texas-Austin).<P><P>

<B>Stratospheric CIO Levels</B><br> 
Recent measurements collected by the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite 
(UARS) indicate that an ozone hole could form over
the northern hemisphere Highly reactive chlorine compounds generated by 
human produced chlorofluorocarbons snatch away
one of the oxygen atoms from ozone, forming chlorine monoxide (CIO). As 
such, CIO is an excellent indicator of ozone destruction
These UARS images derived from the Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS)-map CIO 
at an approximate 20 km altitude on February 17, 1993. Violets and reds 
show the regions of highly elevated CIO, primarily over northern Europe 
and Russia. The mercater and polar projections clearly reveal the 
potential for dramatic ozone reduction over populated regions, with not 
only regional but global consequences.  Provided by:  NASA<P>

<B>The Ozone Hole</B><br><IMG SRC="" ALIGN=left Border=0

The U.S. and former Soviet Union agreed to a cooperative project that put 
the Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) a board a Soviet rocket 
(Cyclone) and spacecraft (Meteor 3) TOMS/Meteor-launched from the 
Plesestsk Cosmodrome on August 15, 1991 (see home page)- continues the 
long-term data record of ozone measurements initiated by TOMS/Nimbus-7 
(October 1978).  Research has demonstrated that ice crystals in 
stratospheric clouds play a key role in the destructive chemistry that 
devastates the ozone layer over the south pole.  The data product to the 
left depicts depleted ozone concentrations associated with the 
development of the polar vortex (i.e.,  extremely cold stratospheric 
winds) in October 1992. Violets highlight the hole. Future flights of the 
TOMS instrument will take place in 1994 and 1996, as a U S. Earth Probe 
and as part of the payload aboard Japan's Advanced Earth Observing System 
(ADEOS), respectively.  Provided by: NASA.<P><P>

<h1> 
Atmosphere
</h1>

The atmosphere is one of the most important aspects of our earth.  Life 
could not exist without it.  It provides us with infinite sources of 
oxygen, carbon dioxide, and nitrogen; all of which are absolutely 
essential to animal and plant life. The atmosphere has a number of 
important functions. First, it provides us with the water that is 
essential to life. Secondly, the atmosphere sends the sun's radiation 
back to the earth, which is necessary for photosynthesis to occur. 
Thirdly, the atmosphere acts as the earth's protective bubble. It shields 
us from the sun's deadly ultraviolet radiation, and cosmic rays, and from 
the meteors that continually come down on the earth from space. Finally 
the atmosphere maintains the earth's climate. It warms the polar regions 
and cools the tropical regions. It is clear to see that the atmosphere is 
vital to the survival of the earth. (World Book,871)
<p>
The atmosphere is primarily composed of a mixture of permanent gases 
(mainly nitrogen and oxygen), ions, and a number of other solid and 
liquid particles.  The atmosphere can be divided into a number of layers 
depending upon their temperature.  The troposphere is the lowest layer of 
the atmosphere and the closest to the surface of the earth.  Lying above 
the troposphere is the second layer called the stratosphere.  Finally, 
above the stratosphere lies the mesosphere.
<p>
The atmosphere must be recognized as having political significance.  Laws 
must be made to protect it.  The depletion of the ozone layer and the 
pollution of the air are both major atmospheric problems.  On April 21, 
1993, in President Bill Clinton's Earth Day speech, he promised to "take 
the lead" in dealing with and solving the buildup of greenhouse gases 
(ie.  pollutants).  Fortunately, government has acknowledged the problems 
the atmosphere is facing.  More importantly, they are taking action and 
dealing with these problems. (Americana Annual, 221)
<p>
We, as a society, affect this sphere greatly.  There are many things that 
we can do to protect and maintain the atmosphere.  First of all, we can 
clean up the air.  Transportation is the single largest source of 
nitrogen oxides and carbon monoxide; the two elements that cause acid 
rain and pollution.  This problem could be simply dealt with if we as a 
society were willing to cut back the number of vehicular miles we travel.  
Secondly, we can cut packaging pollution.  When plastics and other 
synthetic materials burn oil during the manufacturing process, this 
contributes dierctly to global warming and acid rain.  Ways to cut down 
on packaging pollution would be to buy products that can be recycled, to 
buy biodegradable products, to buy in bulk, and to avoid excessive 
packaging.  Lastly, by recycling paper we could cut down the amount of 
pollution.  For example, if a school or office recycled one ton of the 
paper it uses, they'd be keeping 60 tons of air pollution out of the sky.  
(MacEacheron, 166)

It is equally important  we protect the ozone layer.  The ozone layer 
shields the earth from the sun's dangerous ultraviolet rays.  Ozone is 
the only gas in the atmosphere that limits the amount of ultraviolet 
radiation from the sun that reaches the earth.  Without this protective 
layer, we will be more susceptible to skin cancer, cataracts, and a 
weakened immune system.

There are many ways to help protect the ozone layer.  The most important 
is to avoid products containing chloroflurocarbons.  Chloroflurocarbons, 
more commonly referred to as CFC's, release bromine, the "ozone 
depleting" substance.  (MacEacheron, 167) CFCs have become the essential 
ingredients in refrigerators, air conditioners, and aerosol spray cans.  
It is necessary that we do not support any of these products.  We must 
opt for the products that do not contain CFCs.(MacEacheron, 167)

The atmosphere directly affects, and is affected by the other spheres.  
The atmosphere affects the biosphere and geosphere, because with the 
ozone layer's destruction, more sun is hitting the land, and this could 
cause the ground to virtually bake.  There would be less crops and 
plants, and more barren land.  The atmosphere is affecting the 
cryosphere, because with the ozone hole increasing global warming, the 
ice and glaciers of Greenland and the Antarctic could be melting.  
Finally, the atmosphere affects the hydrosphere because all the pollution 
in the air is causing acid rain.   The acid rain is going into the ocean 
and polluting the water and harming its inhabitants.

NASA is currently collecting data via satellite about the atmosphere.  It 
is called the EOS-Chemistry Series (2002).  This satellite is focusing on 
a number of things related to the atmosphere.  The chemistry of the 
troposhpere, the chemistry of the stratosphere, aerosols, and solar 
radiation are the main issues. (NASA, handout)

The atmosphere is an extremely important of our earth.  Without the 
atmosphere we could not survive.  Our carelessness and greediness have 
done so much harm to the atmosphere.  It is time for us all to learn to 
appreciate, understand, respect, and preserve the atmosphere.

<TITLE>STUDYING GLOBALCLIMATE CHANGE</TITLE>
<A HREF="144.map">
<IMG SRC="" ISMAP></A><br>
<H3>Studying Global Climate Change</H3>
<KBD>	The EOS focuses on the most critical issues in global climate change
research. Seven key issues in global climate change were identified by 
the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the U.S. Global Change
Research Program, an international scientific forum for coordinating 
research
programs in global change. The key areas of scientific uncertainty 
identified are:
<ul>
1. Sources and sinks of greenhouse gases, which affect predictions of 
their future concentrations and global warming;<p>

2. Clouds and the Earth's radiation balance, which strongly influence the 
magnitude of climate change (for example, by cooling and/or warming of 
the Earth);<p>
3. Oceans, which are the heat engine of global climate and influence the 
timing and patterns of climate change;<p>
4. Land surface hydrology, which affects regional climate and water 
availability, for agricultural and industrial development;<p>
5. Polar ice sheets, which affect predictions of global sea level;<p>
6. Ecological dynamics, such as vegetation patterns, biological diversity 
and carbon cycling, which are affected by or affect climate change; and<p>
7. Volcanoes, which can add materials to the atmosphere that produce 
short-term effects similar to climate change.<P> 
</ul>
	Scientists based these priorities on the scientific uncertainty that 
exists, particularly as it affects the accuracy of climate predictions. 
The EOS will sponsor studies of the extent, causes, and regional 
consequences of global climate change by providing the means for 
observation, data and information management, research, and assessment. 
In the sections that follow, these seven key research areas of global 
climate change, as redefined in the priorities set by the EOS 
Investigator's Working Group, are discussed in terms of their known or 
potential importance in global climate change.<P>

<H3>VOLCANOES</H3>

Eruption Plumes and Volcanic Clouds: The eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the
Philippines on July 5, 1991.<P>

<IMG SRC="" ALIGN=right VSPACE=20 HSPACE=20><P>

Since the eruption of Mount Tambora in 1815 in New Guinea, the scientific
community has recognized that volcanoes con influence weather conditions
on a global scale. Volcanic eruptions inject large quantities of dust,
gas, and aerosols into the atmosphere. Dust particles settle rapidly, but
aerosols and gases can stay aloft for years if they reach the
stratosphere. These materials absorb and reflect solar radiation in the
atmosphere, which causes cooling at the Earth's surface. This cooling can
temporarily offset global warming due to other climatic effects.<P>

Thus, volcanoes are important to global climate change research because
eruptions cause natural variations in the climate record. For example,
aerosols from the 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines
caused a decrease in global temperature through 1993. Volcanoes also serve
as natural tests for atmospheric circulation models by injecting ash into
the atmosphere that can then be tracked via satellites, as with the Mt.
Spurr (Alaska) eruption in 1992.<P>

The EOS will provide scientists with the means to study both the extent of
volcanic activity and inputs to the atmosphere. Remote sensing is used to
observe swelling of volcanoes or addition of new lava flows. Surface
temperatures can be observed from space to monitor activity in volcanic
craters. Scientists will develop methods to model and predict hazardous
activity. Volcanic eruptions will be monitored from space by remote
observations of atmospheric gases, aerosols, and clouds. The major
contribution to climate change research will be to evaluate the dramatic
effects of volcanic eruptions on atmospheric chemistry and radiation
budgets. This effort is critical for predicting the impacts of volcanoes
on short- and long-term global climate change.<P>

Earth observations satellites have confirmed that many natural disasters 
have regional and even global impacts; in addition, remote-sensing 
instrumentation helps identify industrial accidents that require 
remediation.  The full and open sharing of Earth observations data that 
CEOS promotes ensures the availability of vital information needed to 
monitor natural phenomena and to assess negative human influences on the 
environment.<P>

<B>Mt. Pinatubo Eruption</B><br> 

Mt. Pinatubo erupted on April 2, 1991, after a silence of over 600 years. 
The force of the pent-up blast gradually increased in intensity, until it 
crested on June 15, 1991.  this observation-acquired by the Multispectral 
Electronic Self-Scanning Radiometer (MESSR) onboard the Marine 
Observation Satellite-1 (MOS-1)-was made 20 days after the eruption had 
reached its peak.  As can be seen, the forest within a 12 km radius of 
the crater was buried by volcanic debris, with the area to the southwest 
hit the hardest.  Measurable quantities of volcanic ash and rocks were 
found 40 km to the south and west of the volcano.  In addition to ground 
damage assessment, this high-resolution optical sensor tracked the ash

The Massive outpouring of Volcanic material from Mt. Pinatubo in the 
Philippines-believed to be double that of any eruption in the past 
century-has been captured by the Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment 
II (SAGE I) aboard the Earth Radiation Budget Satellite (ERBS).  The 
volcanic eruption shot 15 to 20 million tons of sulphur dioxide at least 
25 km into the stratosphere.  The sheer magnitude of the blast and 
resultant plume could have two significant global climate impacts:  A 
dampening of the global warming trend (at least for the next several 
years), and temporary acceleration of the process that destroys the 
Earth's protective ozone layer.  This global map of volcanic aerosols in 
the stratosphere was compiled from observations collected between June 14 
and July 26, 1991, when the bulk of the plume resided between 20 degrees 
S and 30 degrees N.  Provided by:  NASA.<P>

<html><head><title>1994: Another Warm Year</title></head><body>


/* Written 12:21 PM  Mar 18, 1995 by larris in igc:climate.news */
Tiempo, Issue #15, March 1995<p>
 
<center><H2>1994: ANOTHER WARM YEAR</H2></center>
 
1994 proved to be the fourth warmest year in the record of global
surface air temperature. Mick Kelly places the year in its longer-term
context and discusses the derivation of this important indicator of
global climate.<p>
 
The warmth during 1994 was most marked over the Northern Hemisphere,
particularly over eastern and central Europe and parts of North 
America.<p>
 
The global average during 1994 was in keeping with the general
temperature level prevailing at the turn of the decade. The cooling
resulting from the eruption of Mount Pinatubo in June 1991 has waned.
The timing of the Pinatubo effect agrees with that predicted by climate
models at the time of the eruption.<P>
 
The net trend in the global temperature series amounts to 0.59 C over
the complete period of the record, 1854- 1994. This is a warming rate of
about 0.04 C per decade. The magnitude of the warming trend is not
inconsistent with model predictions of the effect of rising greenhouse
gas concentrations over this period.<P>
 
There are, however, discrepancies between the smooth rise in temperature
predicted by the models and the variable warming rate observed in the
real world. These discrepancies may be the result of other factors
temporarily masking or reinforcing the greenhouse trend.<P>
 
How reliable is the record of global surface air temperature? The record
is based on grid point estimates of monthly surface air temperature.
These estimates are derived by interpolating data from standard
meteorological stations on land and from ships of opportunity for marine
areas. Sea surface temperature is used as it is easier to correct for
error than marine air temperature. The data are expressed as departures
from a common period, 1951-80, to overcome the variation in absolute
temperature caused by local factors such as site elevation.<P>
 
In order to assess the reliability of the land data, each of the station
records was tested by visual comparison with neighbouring station time
series. As a result, some station time series were corrected while a
number of records were discarded. Station histories, where available,
were used to support this analysis.<P>
 
Perhaps the most serious problem affecting the reliability of combined
land records is the growth of towns and cities around some monitoring
sites. Increasing urbanization can lead to systematic warming trends in
the records of affected sites. Although many of the worst-affected sites
were identified in the station comparisons, some of the
marginally-affected sites most likely passed unnoticed.<P>
 
The degree to which remaining urbanization effects might bias the record
of global temperature change has been assessed by comparing
regional-average series with data from specially developed rural station
networks.<P>
 
The greatest residual warming is apparent over the contiguous United
States (about 0.15 C over the 1901-84 period). The additional warming in
the other industrial areas is barely noticeable. Hence urban warming is
not considered a significant source of error in the global temperature
record.<P>
 
Marine data often require correction to take account of changes in
measurement technique. For example, modern sea surface temperature
observations taken by measuring water temperature in engine intake pipes
are biased compared to earlier data taken from a sample collected by
throwing a bucket over the side of the ship. Correction factors can be
derived using a theoretical model or by comparing marine data from
coastal locations with observations taken on the neighbouring land.<P>
 
The spatial coverage of the temperature data set changes markedly with
time. Even today, there are areas of the Southern Ocean for which no
data are available and the coverage in the earliest decades of the
record is very limited.<P>
 
Analysis of the effects of changing coverage suggests that the
temperature level during the late 1800s is, in fact, well approximated
by the sparse network available then, so estimates of long-term trends
should not be significantly affected. Values for individual years during
the early decades of the record are suspect.<P>

<h1> 
Global Warming
</h1>

The earth is getting warmer.  The changes are small so far, but they are 
expected to grow and speed up.  Human activities which release greenhouse 
gases in the atmosphere are the main cause for this steady warming of the 
earth's surface.  "There is a very real possibility that man- through 
ignorance or indifference, or both- is irreversibly altering the ability 
of our atmosphere to perform basic life support functions for our 
planet." (McCuen 117).
<p>
The earth is surrounded by a gaseous blanket of air called the 
atmosphere.  It has a well-defined chemical composition consisting of 78% 
nitrogen.  The remaining percentage of the atmosphere is made up of 
oxygen, argon, and small amounts of carbon dioxide, water vapor, helium, 
neon, and ozone (Gallant 19-20).  The atmosphere extends from the earth's 
surface to heights of thousands of kilometers, where it gradually blends 
into space.
<p>
The atmosphere is commonly divided into three main layers.  They are the 
troposphere, the stratosphere, and the mesosphere.  The troposphere is 
the innermost layer of the earth's atmosphere.  It extends about 10 
kilometers into space.  The stratosphere is the second layer of the 
earth's atmosphere.  It extends from 10 to 48 kilometers into the 
atmosphere.  The stratosphere contains the ozone layer, which shields the 
earth from most of the ultraviolet radiation that comes from the sun.  
The mesosphere is the third layer of the earth's atmosphere.  It is an 
air layer that is about 30 kilometers deep and extends 80 kilometers 
above the earth.  The thermosphere and the exosphere are also part of the 
atmosphere, but they are very minor.  These separate layers work together 
to protect and shield the earth from dangerous components of the sun and 
deep space.
<p>
The atmosphere's diverse compostiion is completely necessary in order to 
keep a balance on earth.  Even a small change in the concentration of 
these atmospheric gases could have a tremendous effect on the temperature 
of the earth.  The increase of such gases as carbon dioxide, water vapor, 
methane, nitrous oxide, and other chlorofluorocarbons is magnifying the 
greenhouse effect.  The greenhouse effect is the warming of the climate 
that results when the atmosphere traps heat radiating from the earth 
towards space.  Carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases in the 
atmosphere protect the earth from the cold of outer space.  These gases 
contained in the atmosphere act almost like car windows on a hot day.  
The glass lets in the sunlight, but  it keeps the heat from escaping the 
automobile, just as carbon dioxide and other gases let some of the sun's 
radiation penetrate the earth but then it keeps most of this radiation 
from escaping back into the atmosphere.  An increase in these gases would 
mean an increase in the amount of dangerous radiation trapped near the 
earth.  This, in turn, would mean an increase in the temperature of the 
earth and its surrounding atmosphere.
<p>
Carbon dioxide is the main heat-absorbing component in the atmosphere.  
It keeps the air at a temperature that is comfortable for life on earth.  
If the earth were any richer in carbon dioxide, the temperature would be 
hundreds of degrees hotter, and life on earth would be highly unlikely, 
such as on Venus.  However, if the earth had any less carbon dioxide, the 
surface temperature would be so cold that the earth would again be 
lifeless, as it is on Mars (Pringle 11-12).  It is obvious that the earth 
has a very delicate balance of atmospheric gases, and even a very minor 
change could alter teh future of the earth permanently.
<p>
The amount of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere 
is steadily increasing.  In fact, there is now ten percent more carbon 
dioxide in the air than there was thirty years ago.  As a result of the 
immense carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere, it is possible that 
global temperatures will become higher than they have been in over 
100,000 years.
<p>
The ozone layer is also a key element in keeping the temperature of the 
earth constant.  It is a crucial part of life on earth.  It serves as a 
shield, protecting the earth from harmful radiations of the sun.  
Scientists have discovered that the "bad", dangerous ozone is increasing 
in the air people breathe, and the "good", helpful ozone is decreasing in 
the earth's protective ozone shield (Pringle 16).
If the ozone layer were to disappear, life on this planet would suffer 
severe damage from cancers and genetic mutations.  It is also likely that 
a huge portion of the earth's water supply would be lost due to the 
ultraviolet radiation and heat.  Basically, without the ozone layer to 
protect the earth, the human race would eventually die off, either as a 
result of disease or a lack of water.
<p>
Chlorofuorocarbons (CFCs) are also very damaging to the future of the 
earth.  CFCs consist of chlorine, fluorine, and carbon.  These substances 
have served as coolants for refrigerators and air conditioners, 
propellants for aerosol sprays, agents for producing foam, and cleaners 
for electronic parts" (NASA Facts).  Every molecule of CFC is an alarming 
10,000 times more effective in trapping heat than one molecule of carbon 
dioxide.  Once these substances enter the atmosphere, they gradually 
begin to destroy the ozone layer.  Airborne expeditions over the Arctic 
and Antarctica have led scientists to believe that chemical reactions 
involving manmade chlorine are the main cause of ozone
depletion in the upper atmosphere (Peckham 9).  Laws have been passed to 
limit he production of CFCs, but in order to end this problem, the 
govrnment is currently working to revise these laws to call for a 
complete phaseout of CFCs (NASA FActs).
<p>
All of these factors combined are causing and will continue to cause the 
temperature of the earth to rise.  Slowly but surely, as greenhouse gases 
increase, the invisible balance that has nurtured life for thousands of 
years is being destroyed.  Once the greenhouse gases are released into 
the atmosphere, they will begin to trap a much greater amount of heat 
than the atmosphere normally would.  This coupled with the depletion of 
the ozone, which will allow more harmful radiation from the sun to enter 
the earth's atmosphere, can be a very deadly combination.  The 
consequences of this may be so serious that it is prudent to take 
cautionary actions while there is still time.  The longer these actions 
are delayed, the greater the climate change will be, and the harder and 
more expensive it will be to deal with it. 
<p>
Scientists have tried to ocme up with other elements that may have caused 
the rise in the earth's temperature.  One idea is that changes in the 
earth's position in relation to the sun and the earth's orbit around the 
sun were the cause.  Another possibility is that the amount of radiation 
emitted by hte sun has increased.  This warming could also be due to any 
major catastrophes on the surface or in the atmosphere that would cause a 
sudden change in temperature.  Scientists after having explored all other 
possibilities now feel that the bottom line is that the earth is 
definitely warming, and it is in part due to the destroying of the ozone 
layer and the increase in the amount of greenhouse gases in the 
atmosphere.
<p>
Global warming has not yet been proven.  If it is true, it threatens to 
change the forces that control climate, which is the pattern of weather 
averaged over a long period of time.  The impact of this climate change 
could be detrimental.  Tropical storms wuld become more common, plants 
and animals that find it difficult to adapt could die out, and ice caps 
and glaciers would melt, causing the oceans to expand, in turn flooding 
the coastlines.  Scientists believe that if precautions are not taken 
soon, that eventually the temperature of the earth will reach very 
dangerous heights.  The theory is that the greenhouse effect, which 
provides necessary warmth for life, has been distorted by human 
activities, so that the upper atmosphere traps and increasing amount of 
heat, gradually increasing the temperature of the entire earth (Peckham 
12-13).
<p>
The atmosphere is a very complex part of the earth.  The atmosphere gives 
protection from th sun and gives human beings and animals air to breathe.  
People need to stop taking away from the atmosphere and start to think 
about how much it gives to their lives and about how much humans depend 
on it.  Without the atmosphere, there would be no human race.  Societies 
all over the world need to take a stand and protect that which is most 
important ot life and survival, the atmosphere.

Global Greenness Vegetation:  1-km AVHRR "greenness index" (increasing 
from brown-yellow-green, with white as clouds or snow) during the last 
week of June 1992.<p>

Human impacts on Earth are most visible in changes to the land. As our
population has grown, we have altered the landscape to raise crops and
animals, harvest forests, and build cities, roads, canals, and dams.<P>

Land cover influences local weather and climate. Weather and climate, in
turn, affect land cover, particularly patterns of vegetation and water
distribution. The Earth's radiation budget depends portly on absorption
and reflection from land surfaces, which differ greatly depending on soil
or rock type, moisture content, vegetation type, and snow cover. Changes
in vegetation cover can alter surface wind patterns and the exchange of
moisture and heat with the air. These land-air interactions can affect
local patterns of precipitation, water storage, and runoff that control
the amount of water available for use in homes, agriculture, industry, and
energy production.<P>

Patterns of life hove changed as land is converted from natural to
human-dominated conditions. Biological processes engaged in the global
carbon cycle have a significant but poorly quantified effect on greenhouse
gas accumulation in the atmosphere. The greenhouse gases influenced by
biological processes include carbon dioxide (CO2), methane, and nitrous
oxide. The most significant processes are those related to the storage and
release of carbon. Plants, through photosynthesis, transform atmospheric
C02 into organic matter. This process leads to a sink for CO2, with carbon
stored as living vegetation or as dead material in soils. Higher CO2
concentrations can stimulate plant production and this carbon may end up
stored by plants.<P>

<IMG SRC=""ALIGN=left VSPACE=20 HSPACE=20><P>
Land Use and Hydrology:  St. Louis and surrounding farmland at the 
confluence of the Mississippi River (upper left) and the Missouri River 
(center) at the peak of major floods in July 1993.<p>

However, some land use changes may release this stored carbon into the
atmosphere, thus changing land into a source of CO2. For example, carbon
is released to the atmosphere when forests are cleared and burned.
Space-based remote sensing provided by the EOS will contribute information
on vegetation cover and its productivity, geological and mineralogical
formations, soil moisture, and forest fires. In addition, detailed
observations from the Landsat missions, which began in 1972, will continue
to reveal changes in land use and land cover. Computer models of cycles of
energy, water, and carbon, developed by EOS scientists, will further our
understanding of how land processes affect, and are affected by, global
climate change.<P>

Biosphere
</h1>

The biosphere is that part of the earth in which life exists. It includes 
the plants and the animals on the air, sea, and land. It is a sphere of 
varying thickness extending around the entire earth. The outer limits 
extend just above the earth's surface, and the inner limits reach just 
below the surface of land by a few thousand feet. Living organisms in the 
biosphere aren't evenly distributed. They are sensitive to climate.
<p>
<IMG SRC=""><IMG SRC="">
<p>
The term biosphere also includes many relationships among living things 
for the transfer of materials and energy. The biosphere is divided into 
smaller units called ecosystems, which consist of all biotic (living) and 
abiotic (non-living) factors that surround organisms and affect their way 
of life. The ranges of environmental factors that individual organisms 
can withstand are important in the distribution of species. 

<ul>
<li>Temperature is an important factor in this distribution because of 
its effects on metabolism. 
<li>Water is essential to life. The main threat concerning water is the 
varying abilities of plants and animals to obtain and retain water, which 
is important in their distribution. 
<li>Light is the solar energy that drives all ecosystems, although light 
is not the most important factor limiting plant growth. 
<li>Physical structure, pH, and mineral composition of soil are important 
factors limiting the distributions of plants, resulting in the loss of 
animals that feed on those plants. 
<li>Wind helps in the effect of environmental temperature on organisms by 
increasing heat loss due to evaporation and convection, and affects the 
water loss in organisms by increasing the rate of evaporation in animals 
and transpiration in plants. 
<li>Environmental disturbances such as fires, hurricanes, typhoons, and 
volcanic eruptions can ruin biological communities.
</ul>
Interactions between the atmosphere and the biosphere vary over time. The 
record of these changes are preserved in sedimentary rock and studied to 
gain an understanding of the origin and evolution of life on earth.  To 
model all aspects of the bioshpere will take a long time but research has 
been carried out on atmosphere-land surface-vegetation interaction. 
People in the biosphere affect the atmosphere by pollution from cars and 
industrial businesses. We pollute the hydrosphere by dropping our trash 
in the oceans and by causing oil slicks. We affect the geosphere by means 
of ground soil pollution from landfills.
<p>
Human activities including fossil fuel burning, land use changes and uses 
of industrial chemicals have increased the amounts of greenhouse gases 
and other atmospheric parts drastically. Changes in animal populations 
reflect climatic variations through the limited availability of food and 
habitat. The most serious biospheric climate concern is human activity 
leading to increasing amounts of gases such as carbon dioxide, CH4, N2O, 
and CFC's; deforestation and air  and water pollution. The government 
imposes laws and regulations regarding the biosphere. Th Environmental 
Protection Agency protects the land suface, bodies of water, and all 
living things in the biosphere. Forest rangers protect the forest and 
parks from people cutting down trees for paper products. The disposal of 
certain wastes has to be authorized by governmental regulations. Leaves 
cannot be burned because the toxins pollute the air. Yard waste must be 
disposed of by bagging it separately from normal trash. 
<p>
<IMG SRC="">
<p>
Bioshperic research programs have been started, such as Sustainable 
Biosphere Initiative (SBI). This program focuses on management of Earth's 
resources and the maintenance of Earth's life support systems. To promote 
this sustainable biosphere, ecological science must determine patterns 
and indicators of the responses to stress, such as heat causing 
earthquakes; provide guidelines and ways to restore ecological systems, 
such as unleaded gas and carpooling, and develop and use ecological 
theory for the management of ecological systems, for example modeling. 
Bioshperics research uses space-based or aircraft technology. In the 
future the EOS-AM series (1998) called Morning Crossing will look at 
clouds, radiation, and aerosols, surface temperature of land and ocean, 
vegetation and ocean phytoplankton, and global biological productivity. 
EOS-Color (1998) will observe ocean phytoplankton and biological 
production.
<p>
To protect the biosphere in our everyday lives we can stop using paper 
plates which will keep some trees from being cut down, giving us more 
oxygen to breath. We can recycle paper, bottles, and aluminum cans to 
reduce the amount of trash going to landfills, which will decrease the 
amount of ground soil polluted. We can stop the burning of coal for 
electricity to prevent pollution of the air. We can use biodegradable 
products such as soaps, detergents, and cloth diapers that can be washed 
instead of plastic diapers that can't be broken down. By following some 
of these steps we can reduce the amount of pollution in our environment 
and make the biosphere a better place to live.

<B>The Aral Sea</B><p>

<IMG SRC=""><P>

For 10,000 years, two rivers have fed the Aral Sea-the Amu Darya and the 
Syr Darya creating one of the world's largest inland bodies of water. In 
1954, the 805-mile Kara Kum Canal was built to divert the Aral's inflow, 
primarily to irrigate cotton crops. As can be seen in the Landsat 
Multispectral Scanner (MSS) imagery, the lake has shrunk dramatically 
during the 1973 to 1987 time frame. Consequences of this human-induced 
change include increased water salinity, pesticide pollution, and loss of 
an important fishery.  In addition, climatic changes have made the summer 
and winter temperatures more extreme, and created myriad health problems 
for the area's inhabitants. The human impact has been and continues to be 
immense, with those depending on the diverted waters suffering in the 
attempt to salvage what was once the world's fourth largest lake.  Yet, 
if ignored, th Aral Sea, which once covered 26,000 square miles, could 
virtually vanish by 2020.  Provided by: USGS.<P>

	One concern about global warming is that melting glaciers and ice sheets 
will cause sea level to rise, threatening coastal ecosystems, cities, and 
low-lying agricultural regions. The last century has seen a decrease in 
water stored in temperate mountain glaciers, accounting for part of the 
accompanying rise in sea level. Temperature increases 
also result in higher sea levels by causing the oceans to expand. 
However, we do not know whether large polar ice sheets are growing or 
shrinking, or how they will respond to climate change.<P>

	Satellite laser and radar altimeters in the EOS will measure changes in 
surface heights of ice sheets and oceans to determine changes in the size 
of ice sheets. Scientists use this information, models of ice dynamics, 
and observations of temperatures and precipitation in polar regions to 
predict changes in the ice volume and sea level.<P>

	Studies of ice sheet dynamics will use high-resolution data from 
microwave 
synthetic aperture radar (SAR) instruments on European, Japanese, and 
Canadian satellites. The U.S. Landsat missions have collected 
high-resolution images since 1972 and will continue through the EOS era 
to build a detailed time record. Local measurements of sea level, which 
date back to the last century for some ports, help validate observations 
from satellite altimeters such as the Ocean Topography Experiment TOPEX/ 
POSEIDON) satellite mission begun in 1992. The goal of these efforts is 
to understand links between climate, glaciers, and sea level, and to 
assess environmental, economic, and social impacts for coastal 
regions.<P>

<h1> 
Cryosphere
</h1>

Ice.  Glaciers.  Snow.  These are all part of the cryosphere.  According 
to the Dictionary of the Physical Sciences, the cryosphere is the totaity 
of the world's ice.  Some of the things that the cryosphere includes are 
sea ice, polar ice, glaciers, and ice sheets.  Sea ice is ice that floats 
in the ocean.  It has a large insulating effect.  Polar ice consists of 
sea ice formed from the freezing water.  Glaciers are the combination of 
excess snow and melted snow on land which results in a mass of ice.  Ice 
sheets are large sheets of ice that float in the ocean.
<p>
It is important to study the cryosphere because it takes up so much area 
on earth.  The ice on earth covers 10.7% of land area and 3.1% of the 
earth's surface (Atlas of Satellite Observations Related to Global 
Change,401).  Water makes up 97% of the earth's surface.  According to 
NASA FActs, global sea ice coverage averages 25 million square 
kilometers, the area of North America.  Ice sheets and glaciers cover 15 
million square kilometers which is 10% of the earth's land surface area 
(1).  Glacier ice is the largest reservoir of fresh water on earth.  It 
makes up about 77% of the fresh water.  Glaciers are also the second 
largest reservoir of the total water on earth, making up 2.15% (Atlas of 
Satellite Observations Related to Global Change).  It is uncertain 
whether the two major ice sheets, located in Antarctica and Greenland, 
are growing or diminishing.  It is important to know more about the 
cryosphere and the size of these two sheets.  They, along with other 
parts of the cryosphere, have great potential for changing sea level.
<p>
There is a strong relationship between the cryosphere and the hyrosphere.  
If the ice melts because of global warming, the ice sheets over the ocean 
will melt which will increase the heat flow from the ocean to the 
atmosphere, leading to further warming.  If more ice is being formed, the 
heat flow from the ocean to the atmosphere is reduced (Modeling the Earth 
System in the Mission to Planet Earth Era,49).  The depletion of the 
ozone, located in the stratosphere, is causing the temperature of the 
oceans to rise and the ice to melt.  If sea level keeps rising, the land 
area in the geosphere will grow less and less, and living things  in the 
biosphere will have less room to live.
<p>
NASA is doing a lot of research to collect data about the cryosphere.  In 
the United States, missions conducted by NASA are contributing to our 
knowledge of polar ice on a global basis.  NASA is conducting a 
Pathfinder Program that will eventually lead up to the Earth Observing 
System (EOS).  EOS will involve a series of satellites to be launched in 
1998 that will provide coverage of the earth over a period of 15 to 20 
years.  The Defense Meteorological Satellite Program flew a special 
Microwave/Imager in 1987.  Its data is still used today to measure sea 
ice concentrations (NASA Facts,3).  Also, high resolution images from the 
Landsat series of satellites have been converted into photo maps for 
parts of the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets.  Radars from NASA have 
been used to determine and map the elevation contours of the southern 
half of the Greenland ice sheet and a small fraction of northern 
Antarctica.
<p>
There is a concern that global warming could contribute to the 
destruction of the cryosphere.  If global warming occurs, more ice is 
expected to melt, the energy is reflected back to space where the energy 
increases at the surface, and portions of the Earth still become warmer 
(NASA FActs, 1).  Since the water under the ice sheets would be warmer, 
the ice sheets could break up more easily causing very large ice bergs, 
very dangerous forms of ice in the sea.  Animals that live in the cold 
regions of the cryosphere are in danger.  Some animals live in the cold 
temperatures of the cryosphere, but they stay close to the land so that 
they can be warmer by the sun.  If sea levels rise, this will no longer 
be possible and the animals will die.  Some animals can live only in the 
cold temperature water.  If the temperature increases, the animals could 
die.  Some plant life will only grow in cold temperature water.  If the 
temperature of the water rises, the plant life could die, and another 
plant may begin to grow.  However, the sea animals and the phytoplankton 
in the ocean may not  be able to  survive on this new plant. The animals 
will die, thus causing a problem for the food chain.  If the 
phytoplankton die, the fish can not eat them.  Therefore, the sea mammals 
can not eat the fish, and sea life will greatly decrease.  We need to 
take care of our cryosphere because it is the home to so many wonderful 
living things.

<LI>Station - Since 1992 regular ozone soundings have been performed using ECC 5A sensors
mounted on RS80 radiosondes. Ozone profiles up to 35 km height were obtained about weekly. In
the time - height sections from 1992 and 1993 the annual ozone variation over Neumayer is
displayed. The ozone depletion - occuring during Antarctic spring - can be clearly recognized.
>From September - December 1994 real time data will be directly transmitted from Neumayer to
the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research (AWI). Due to the increasing public
interest the AWI trys to display the data as a time - height section, comparable with the
results of 1992 and 1993, as quickly as possible within this page. <A

<H3>THE STRATOSPHERE: OZONE CHEMISTRY</H3>
 
The "Ozone Hole:" Concentrations of ozone and chlorine monoxide (a 
product of ozone destruction) in the stratosphere over Antarctica during 
the peak of the "ozone hole" season in 1991 and 1992 (increasing from 
light pink-blue-green-yellow-red-hot pink-dark purple).<P>

	One of the most striking and well publicized examples of recent global 
change is the Antarctic ozone hole that develops each spring. This "hole" 
is actually a decrease in the amount of ozone in the stratosphere, the 
layer of the atmosphere approximately 11 to 48 kilometers above the 
Earth's surface. Since the mid 1970s, the Antarctic ozone hole has grown 
in severity and extent, and the stratospheric ozone layer has thinned 
over much of the globe. Scientists relate this trend to the release of 
certain man-made chemicals, such as the chlorofluorocarbons used in 
refrigerators and air-conditioners, which break down in the stratosphere 
to yield products that destroy ozone.  The fate of stratospheric ozone 
represents a prime example of the global reach of human activities.<P>

	The ozone layer protects life on Earth from dangerous forms of solar 
ultraviolet (UV) radiation. Thinning of the ozone layer can increase UV 
radiation reaching the Earth's surface. Increased exposure to UV 
radiation harms many organisms on land and near the ocean surface. In 
humans, UV exposure increases the occurrence of skin cancer and 
cataracts.<P>

	Transfers of chemicals and radiation between the stratosphere and the 
troposphere influence many atmospheric processes, including the 
greenhouse effect and ozone destruction. Whereas greenhouse gases in the 
troposphere warm the air near the Earth's surface, the same gases 
reaching the stratosphere can cool the upper atmosphere by reflecting 
heat into space. This heating and cooling will alter both the structure 
of the atmosphere and the speed of chemical reactions taking place.<P>

	Focused research programs and remote-sensing observations in the last 15 
years have improved our understanding of ozone chemistry. Ground 
measurements that first revealed the Antarctic ozone hole led to studies 
of atmospheric chemistry in polar regions using ground, aircraft, and 
balloon observations, along with modeling experiments. Total Ozone 
Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) instruments on several satellites hove 
collected data worldwide since 1978. These studies demonstrated the role 
of human made chemicals in ozone depletion. Policy responses include the 
Montreal Protocol, an international phase-out of the most dangerous 
pollutants that lead to ozone destruction.<P>

	The latest remote-sensing mission to study stratospheric chemistry began 
in 1 991 with NASA's Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS). The EOS 
will continue to monitor ozone and other elements of stratospheric 
chemistry. These investigations will improve the accuracy of observations 
and model predictions of stratospheric conditions, and help assess past 
and future policy decisions.<P>
