<title>The Truth About Free Trade and Protectionism - Heritage Commentary</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><center><h3>THE TRUTH ABOUT FREE TRADE AND PROTECTIONISM</h3>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/johnson.htm">Bryan T. Johnson</a><br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
April 25, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	There's a notion afoot that free trade is hurting the U.S. worker, that it is causing corporations to downsize and lay off their employees, and that the answer is for the U.S. government to impose economic sanctions against foreign countries like Japan. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In reality, this would be very unwise. History and economic common sense show that the "trade wars" approach to the world marketplace simply doesn't work. Consider the following myths: 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	<b>Myth #1</b>: Free trade has allowed manufacturers to go overseas to obtain cheap labor, destroying America's manufacturing infrastructure and losing American jobs. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>Reality</b>: If U.S. manufacturing companies were moving overseas in droves, manufacturing as a percentage of the total U.S. economy would have suffered a steep decline. Instead, it has maintained a constant level of about 21 percent of the total economy for three decades. And if cheap labor were the big draw people like Pat Buchanan and H. Ross Perot say it is, U.S. companies would be invested up to their eyeballs in countries like Haiti, Somalia and the Dominican Republic. Obviously they're not, or these countries wouldn't be destitute. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>Myth #2</b>: We must protect high-paying manufacturing jobs from foreign competition.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>Reality</b>: Not if such protection costs an even greater number of jobs in other industries and causes consumer prices to rise. Consider for example, U.S. import quotas on automobiles, which caused the price of new American autos to increase by 41 percent from 1981 to 1984. The auto industry claims these price hikes saved up to 22,000 jobs. But they also reduced sales -- by about 1 million cars. This drop forced some 50,000 layoffs by the late 1980s. In other words, even though protectionism saved some 22,000 jobs, it caused a net job loss of 30,000.  Some "protection."
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>Myth #3</b>: Free trade is causing America to lose its technological edge.  
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>Reality</b>: America by far is the world's leader in technological innovation and is the world's largest manufacturer of computer microprocessors, semiconductors, advanced consumer electronics, health equipment, telecommunications equipment, computers and computer software, and host of other information technologies and high-tech products. Over time, competition from other nations like Japan is making us do better, not worse.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>Myth #4</b>: U.S. trade deficits -- especially with Japan -- mean America is becoming poorer while others become richer.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>Reality</b>: If this were true, the United States wouldn't be the economic powerhouse it is today. The real reason the United States has a trade deficit with Japan is because there are twice as many Americans as there are Japanese. In order for America to have a trade "balance" with Japan, each and every Japanese would need to buy twice as much from America as Americans buy from Japan.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>Myth #5</b>: Trade deficits cost jobs.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>Reality</b>: History shows that as the U.S. trade deficit increases, unemployment actually decreases. For example, as the U.S. trade deficit leaped in 1983-84 and peaked in 1987, the U.S. unemployment rate plummeted. Conversely, when the trade deficit shrank, from 1989 to 1991, unemployment began to increase. The reason some major companies lay off large numbers of workers has nothing to do with trade deficits and everything to do with burdensome regulatory policies here at home.
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Myth #6</b>: U.S. companies will go under unless the government limits competition from foreign imports and forces foreign governments to purchase more U.S. goods. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>Reality</b>: U.S. companies who use this scare tactic to stampede lawmakers into passing protectionist policies are trying to protect themselves from competition, both foreign and domestic. If American companies are so beset by closed markets overseas, why is America the world's largest exporter? The U.S. auto industry -- so beat up by the Japanese years ago -- is now winning. It racked up $14 billion in profits last year and is making cars that are better built, have fewer flaws and are bigger sellers than many of their Japanese and European counterparts. They have free trade to thank, not government meddling. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In short, while it may be tempting to blame other countries when U.S. companies downsize or lay off  workers, there is no evidence that free trade is hurting us, or that "trade wars" are the answer. Rather, it shows that free trade is the road to prosperity.

<title>How Republicans Can Win the Environmental Debate - Heritage Commentary</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><center>
<h3>HOW REPUBLICANS CAN WIN THE ENVIRONMENTAL DEBATE</h3>
By John Shanahan<br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
April 25, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	Earth Day (April 22) was painful for Republicans. Unless they develop a new strategy on the environment, they will continue getting "gored" on the issue. Not because they failed to communicate their vision, but because they don't have one.
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Clinton administration sent its troops to the congressional districts of vulnerable Republican freshman in Congress to blast them on their environmental record. "Green" activists similarly conducted a media blitz attacking the "anti-environment" GOP.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Liberals have been successful at portraying the new Republican Congress as "planet pavers" who want to "roll back" environmental protection laws, all to satisfy polluting industrialists who contributed to the GOP's political coffers.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The Republicans, meanwhile, have been waging the environmental debate almost exclusively with  regulatory "horror stories"-- tales of real Americans suffering under oppressive environmental laws.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	These anecdotes work, but only to a point.  For example, most Americans would react with anger to the story of Earl Miller, my own dry cleaner in Arlington, Va., who lost his family business after 30 years because he could not afford a new (and largely unnecessary) $40,000 machine required by the Environmental Protection Agency.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	But Republicans have relied too heavily on such stories. As much as Americans  want the government to stop harassing people, they fear (understandably) that if the "regulatory safety net" disappears, we would return to the days of billowing black smokestacks and burning rivers. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	This is why the Republican message so far -- that we need to balance environmental protection with the demands of economic growth -- has fallen like a lead balloon. Many people are convinced the argument is just shorthand for rolling back environmental protections.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Even though environmental regulations cost the U.S. economy an incredible $171 billion annually, balancing this cost against a child's life is a losing proposition. Unless  Republicans can show that their policies protect jobs, eliminate unfairness, and do a better job protecting the environment and public health than the big-government approach, environmental issues will continue to be their Achilles' heel.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The fact is, well intentioned liberal environmental policies can kill. For example, according to a Harvard University study, current regulatory policies cost 60,000 lives per year. Why? Because the government squanders huge sums of money guarding against minuscule risks -- the theoretical loss of life due to trace amounts of chemicals on fruits and vegetables, for example -- while it ignores much greater risks. Dr. John Graham of the Harvard Center for Risk Analysis calls this "statistical murder." 
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Superfund and property rights reforms before Congress provide excellent opportunities to improve the environment and save more lives. Under the hazardous waste "Superfund" cleanup program, created in 1980, only about 20 percent of the 1,374 sites on the list have been cleaned up. Lawmakers should let people know they want to accelerate cleanups that are now delayed because trial lawyers -- big allies of the White House -- soak up 21 percent of Superfund's money. More lives would be saved because of faster cleanups of the worst sites posing the most risk to Americans.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Similarly, Republicans should explain that protecting the rights of property owners can actually benefit threatened species. Right now, under the Endangered Species Act, regulators can financially ruin families by taking away their ability to use their land, without compensation. This is unfair and counterproductive. It creates an incentive for property owners to make sure no one finds out about endangered species that may live on their land. The bumper sticker "shoot, shovel, and shut up" tells the whole story.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Republicans must recognize that the American people legitimately expect freedom from harmful pollution. That doesn't mean they should embrace the  environmentalist agenda, which opposes letting businesses find the best way to comply with environmental safeguards, and is hostile to free-market solutions. It does mean, however, that they must publicly acknowledge that polluting a neighborhood is not a conservative value. They should stress the need to prioritize risks and explain why market approaches often work better than regulations -- not only for preserving liberty and economic growth, but for the environment as well. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Most people want more freedom, a stronger economy and a clean and healthy environment. Republicans can win the environmental debate if they meet this challenge, and give people all three. With a positive vision, they can do just that.

<title>Clinton's New Budget: And the Winner Is..Big Government - Heritage Commentary</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><center><h3>CLINTON'S NEW BUDGET: AND THE WINNER IS ... BIG GOVERNMENT</h3>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/hodge.htm">Scott Hodge</a><br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
March 21, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The new budget President Clinton released this week was supposed to attack big government. Big government won.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Over seven years, President Clinton's fiscal year 1997 budget proposes $358 billion in higher spending and $232 billion in higher federal tax revenues than the balanced budget submitted to him by Congress last fall, which he vetoed. That amounts to $3,580 in higher spending and $2,320 in higher tax revenue for every household in America. So much for "the end of big government."
	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
And what about the deficit candidate Clinton vowed to slay within five years if elected? Compared to the 1995 Balanced Budget Act, the president's new budget adds $125 billion in new red ink through the year 2002.  That amounts to increasing the debt burden on every household by $1,250.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	But give the president credit -- for some exceptionally brazen budget gimmickry. On paper, his fiscal year 1997 budget balances by 2002, but only by leaving the real work of deficit reduction to a future president and Congress.  Consider:  The White House budget purports to save nearly $600 billion over seven years, but only 40 percent of those savings would come during Clinton's second term in office, if he wins.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Simply put, it's a lot easier to balance the budget when some other president will bear the brunt of responsibility for deficit reduction. Under the 1997 Clinton budget, the first president and Congress of the next century would have to find 63 percent of the savings -- not just from political lemons like foreign aid, but from favored programs like Medicare and Medicaid.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Not only does the president leave the spending mess for someone else to clean up, he hogs popular tax cuts for himself. Under his budget, middle-class families would get a tax credit for each child, increasing in value from $300 in 1997 to $500 by 1999. But in 2002, the deadline for a balanced budget, Clinton's child tax credit vanishes.  The result in that year: an $18 billion tax increase on families with children. But this doesn't worry the White House either, since some future president will have to deliver the bad news.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	What's more, the president's budget offsets these tax cuts with big tax increases.  All told, the White House budget contains $99.7 billion in tax cuts and $62.4 billion in tax increases.  New taxes exceed the president's proposed seven-year Medicaid savings ($59 billion) and surpass by half his proposed welfare cuts ($40 billion).  In the end, the net tax cut is $37 billion, or just 3 cents of every $1,000 taxpayers will send to Washington over the next seven years. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	And let's not forget: This is the same president who said he would work with Congress to craft some kind of capital-gains tax cut.  But not only does his budget propose no such tax cut, it calls for $4 billion in higher capital-gains taxes over the next seven years.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Meanwhile, the president's budget treats entitlement programs such as Medicaid and Medicare -- the real engines behind uncontrolled spending growth -- with kid gloves. In fact, spending on entitlements steams ahead by $370 billion, or 50 percent, over seven years.  For all "mandatory" programs, spending would grow from 49 cents of every federal dollar today to 59 cents of every federal dollar in 2002.  
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	This threatens not only the country's solvency, but the future of entitlement programs themselves.  In less than 15 years, spending on entitlements and debt interest will consume nearly every dollar in the federal budget, according to the Bipartisan Commission on Entitlement Reform headed by Sen. Robert Kerry, D-Neb., and retired Sen. John Danforth, R-Mo.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The president's response? His budget proposes to slow the growth of Medicare spending by $124 billion over seven years -- not nearly enough to save the program from collapse.  For Medicaid, the situation is just as bad. If nothing is done to reform the program, runaway costs could force states to raise taxes or cut spending by $146 billion. And the president's proposed "reform" -- placing a cap on how much the federal government will spend per Medicaid beneficiary -- could slap $47 billion in new costs on already cash-strapped states.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	There is one area of the budget, however, where the White House does propose real change: spending on presidential "pork" gets a big boost. Clinton's budget outlines a sweeping agenda of new spending initiatives on priorities important to politically influential special-interest groups: education (teachers' unions), high technology (corporations) and the environment ("green" activists). Compared to Congress' balanced budget, the president would shovel an extra $106 billion over seven years to programs supported by such groups.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Let's face it. The president's budget -- while claiming, technically, to eliminate the deficit by 2002 -- is just more obfuscation, smoke and mirrors. It is not the end of big government, it is the embodiment of it.

<title>The Unfinished Agenda on Unfunded Mandates - Heritage Commentary</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg">
<center>
<h2>THE UNFINISHED AGENDA ON UNFUNDED MANDATES</h2>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/antonel.htm">Angela Antonelli</a><br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
March 21, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	One year after Congress passed a law to deal with the problem of "unfunded mandates," the results are not encouraging.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Few Americans have any idea that Washington forces all sorts of laws and regulations on state and local governments -- concerning everything from storm-water drainage to health care for illegal immigrants -- without giving states and localities so much as a penny to pay for them.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	State and local government officials and business leaders met recently in Washington to examine the preliminary recommendations of the Advisory Council on Intergovernmental Relations (ACIR). This is the body Congress assigned last year to examine how "unfunded mandates" are hurting state and local governments, as part of its <a href="http://rs9.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/1?r104:./temp/~r104uCqz::+@1(S.+1)++">Unfunded Mandates Reform Act</a> of 1995. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	As the ACIR's recommendations show, unfunded mandates are still busting state and local budgets, diverting much-needed money from law enforcement, fire fighting, education and other activities people really need. In short, Congress accomplished little with last year's reforms. This should come as no surprise. After all, the <a href="http://rs9.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/11?r104:./temp/~r104YVpC::unfunded+mandates+reform+act+">
Unfunded Mandates Reform Act</a> of 1995  did absolutely nothing to address existing mandates -- except to have the ACIR study them. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	But the study is proving useful. Based on information from the National Governors' Association and dozens of other state and local governments and organizations, ACIR identified 14 mandates it sees as the biggest problems. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The report recommends that seven federal laws, including the Family and Medical Leave Act, the Occupational Safety and Health Act, and the Fair Labor Standards Act, no longer apply to state and local governments. Another seven laws, including the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act and the Clean Air Act, should be made more flexible or be funded more by the federal government instead of forcing state and local governments to pay.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Of course, the report has its shortcomings. It doesn't say anything about how unfunded mandates affect the private sector and whether reforms should extend that far. There also are countless environmental, health and education mandates the report doesn't address. And while the ACIR acknowledges that laws like the Occupational Safety and Health Act may not have a legitimate scientific basis, the ACIR's report doesn't reach into whether the laws themselves should be changed. Asking Congress to exempt states and localities from laws that are ill-conceived in the first place sets a bad precedent and creates a double standard for treatment of the private sector.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In short, the ACIR report just scratches the surface of a huge problem. Costly requirements imposed by Washington are undermining the fiscal health of state and local governments. For example, every three years the Safe Drinking Water Act requires the Environmental Protection Agency to identify 25 new substances localities must test for in their water supplies -- forcing cities across America to bear the cost of testing for substances that literally have been banned for decades. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Another example: A <a href="/heritage/library/categories/healthwel/cb22.html">study</a> by The Heritage Foundation showed that state spending on Medicaid will increase from $32 billion in 1990 to $104 billion in 2002, a 325 percent boost, if there is no reform of the current program. States like California and New York will have to raise additional billions just to pay for their share of this program.  
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Unfunded mandates can force states to raise taxes; reduce spending on education, infrastructure, law enforcement or some other service; or both. For example, in September 1995, Fairfax County, Va. reported that half its non-school budget is being consumed by programs and mandates issued by Congress and the Virginia General Assembly, for which the county receives no funds. In February, the county executive was forced to propose one of the largest tax increases in the county's history, as well as dramatic reductions in education and social service programs.. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Despite their limitations, the ACIR recommendations should give states and localities hope. They confirm that the burden of unfunded mandates is real and significant. The ACIR's final report could create the foundation for a new round of legislative initiatives. These could range from full federal funding of mandates to outright repeal.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	However, if state and local communities expect change, they will have to continue badgering Washington through legislation and the courts. Unless states and localities are vigilant in keeping Congress and the president focused on addressing the problem of unfunded mandates, there will be no reform at all. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Washington will be all too happy to keep passing the buck.  
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

<title>Why We Should Be Worried About Russia - Heritage Commentary</title>

<h3>WHY WE SHOULD BE WORRIED ABOUT RUSSIA </h3>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/cohen.htm">Ariel Cohen</a><br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
 February 29, 1996<br>

<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Russia has the potential to become a far more dangerous and unstable adversary than the Soviet Union ever was. Yet, as the April summit between President Clinton and Russian President Boris Yeltsin approaches, U.S. and international policy-makers seem oblivious to developments that daily make a future belligerent regime in Russia more likely.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Board of Directors of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) is considering granting Russia a $10.2 billion loan, and the U.S.- run Export-Import Bank may provide an additional $1 billion to boost Russia's flagging civilian aircraft industry. President Clinton strongly endorses the IMF loan, hoping it will bolster Yeltsin's faltering presidency. But giving Russia a handout will only encourage Russia on its destructive course. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;If a hard-line communist like Gennady Zyuganov were to carry the presidential election this June, which looks increasingly likely, IMF credits would be going to precisely the kind of regime that could resume threatening the United States and Europe with nuclear weapons. There is a chance that these loans would never be repaid since, under a communist government, Russia could sever relations with the IMF and the World Bank.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Economic reforms in Russia are grinding to a halt. First Deputy Prime Minister Anatoly Chubais, the last remaining radical reformer in Yeltsin's cabinet, was forced to resign to appease Yeltsin's nationalist and communist critics, whose power and influence are gaining strength. Vladimir Kadannikov, Chubais' replacement, directed Russia's inefficient auto-making giant VAZ, whose low-quality products have long been the laughingstock of Europe.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Meanwhile, in 1995 Russia's inflation rate raged between 120 and 130 percent, budget deficits remain very high, and privatization has failed to raise the revenues to reduce them. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Leading Yeltsin administration officials such as Interior Minister General Anatoly Kulikov, along with communist deputies in the Duma, are seriously considering reversing privatization and stopping economic reforms in their tracks. Communists and their allies control the majority of the Duma's committees and the powerful Duma Executive Council.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Moreover, election pressures have forced Yeltsin to break budgetary constraints and promise billions of dollars in credits and payments to powerful industry groups.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;For example, about $4 billion was earmarked for the defense industry and $2.2 billion in back wages has been promised to public-sector workers. The notoriously inefficient Russian miners, who went on strike in December 1995, were promised another $2 billion; $3.3 billion has been pledged to the agricultural sector; half a billion dollars went to pensioners, and more than $1 billion will be paid to officers and soldiers in the armed forces. All of these are panic-driven political payoffs by a frightened regime fighting for its survival.  
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Instead of offering a handout to the Russian government, the IMF and the World Bank ought to be providing policy advice to Russian leaders on decreasing tax rates to boost private enterprise and encouraging investment to make the Russian economy more attractive for domestic and foreign entrepreneurs. Only when investment, both foreign and domestic, is able to create prosperity for the Russian people will the tensions tearing the country apart be eased.   
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Russia has become such an investment risk that more than $12 billion a year is leaving the country  to be deposited in foreign banks. Such capital flight -- the result of incoherent economic policies -- is starving the Russian economy of investment and taxable income and creating political unrest. Even as it asks the IMF for loans, Moscow is forgiving sizable debts owed to it: $8 billion owed by Libyan dictator Muammar Qaddafi; $3 billion owed by the Sandinista regime of Nicaragua; and $250 million owed by Ethiopia. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Meanwhile, Russia continues to prosecute the war against Chechnya. According to estimates by Russian economists, this war is costing more than $4.5 billion a year. The IMF should not subsidize such a war, or any other military ventures into which a future Russian hard-line president might drag the country.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Most ominous of all, the country may be on the brink of a takeover by Gennady Zyuganov, the leader of the unreformed communists who has promised to restore the U.S.S.R. "by voluntary means."  Leading in opinion polls, he is followed by ultra-nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky, who has declared he will restore the Russian empire and possibly expand it even further into the Middle East.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Clinton administration should not lobby the IMF on behalf of Russia. More money  is not what Russia needs. At best the money will be wasted; at worst, it could be abused by a future anti-Western leadership. Instead, President Clinton should take the lead in ensuring that all aid to Russia is conditioned on the adoption of free-market and democratic reforms. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Otherwise, the foundation for a Russia more dangerous than the Soviet Union will continue to be laid.

<h3>RAISING THE BAR</h3>
By Nina Shokraii<br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
February 29, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In the debate over affirmative action about to begin in Congress, opponents of racial quotas and preferences should be ready to offer a better way of creating opportunity for racial groups that have been victims of discrimination.  The answer is high academic standards for everyone.
<p> 
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The greatest tragedy of public education today is the low expectations it sets for poor children, especially blacks and Hispanics.  Racial quotas and preferences reinforce this defeatism by sending a message that blacks and Hispanics can succeed academically and economically only if they are held to a lower standard than Asians and whites.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;But the experience of countless schools and teachers shows that when there are high expectations, black and Hispanic children can meet them.  Test scores for racial minorities can rise by quantum jumps without the ugly practice of "race-norming," where test scores are artificially raised to compensate for racial status.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Take, for instance, the experience of Rafe Esquith, a fifth- and sixth-grade teacher at Hobart Elementary School, located near the site of the 1992 riots in Los Angeles.  Most children at Hobart are poor immigrants from families that don't speak English; 80 percent are Hispanic, 16 percent Asian, 2 percent African-American.  But by the end of the sixth grade, Esquith's students have finished a year of algebra and classical literature -- including eight Shakespeare plays.  His junior thespian crew, the "Hobart Shakespeareans," have performed with Britain's Royal Shakespeare Company.  Their performance of "Measure for Measure" will open the World Shakespeare Congress in Los Angeles this June.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;How does Esquith bring out the best in his class?  The same way outstanding teachers always do.  He sets high standards and gives his students the help they need to meet them.  Esquith begins teaching his class at 6:30 a.m. and teaches straight until 5 p.m. (They even eat lunch in the classroom.)  By teaching his youngsters to solve difficult math equations and to read and perform Shakespeare early on, Esquith trains his kids to take on challenges that at first seem impossible.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The result: Last year, in the mathematics portion of the Comprehensive Test of Basic Skills (a test administered to the Los Angeles Unified School District), his fifth-graders achieved average scores in the 98th percentile while the school itself scored in the 64th percentile and the district in the 47th percentile.  On the English test, they produced similar results -- even though all of Esquith's students speak English as a second language. If not for his devotion, most would be written off as "slow" or "troubled."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;No one can attest to the success of a teacher like Rafe Esquith better than Barbara Lerner. A lawyer and psychologist, she was an outspoken advocate of the "minimum competence testing" movement in the late 1970s -- a grassroots movement demanding that no student be allowed to graduate from high school without first passing a test proving he or she had mastered basic skills in reading and math.  Lerner's 1983 testimony in <I>Debra vs. Turlington</I> (the case challenging Florida's minimum competence test) convinced the courts that minimum competence testing provided just the push these kids needed, pointing out that by the fifth attempt, more than 90 percent of them passed.  Lerner believes schools should make the minimum competence exam the standard for grade-school graduation and also should require children to pass an advanced competence test like the Scholastic Aptitude Test to graduate from high school.  
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;But lawsuits and policies challenging advanced competency abound, and efforts to make earning a high-school diploma contingent upon passing a stringent exam bear a heavy political risk -- because, at first, many students are likely to fail the tests.  According to a 1995 report by the North Central Regional Education Laboratory, only 17 states require all their high school students to pass some form of graduation test.  And of these 17 states, only New York  has made significant strides. Thanks to Ramon Cortines, former chancellor of New York City's public schools, standards and accountability were reinstalled as the centerpiece of education in New York City.  Although the results of the first year reveal a rise in course-failure rates among African-Americans and Hispanics, the number of minorities taking and passing the more rigorous courses increased greatly.  
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Opponents of affirmative action present myriad empowerment ideas, such as school-choice vouchers, when challenged to offer alternatives. But as the experiences of teachers like Esquith demonstrate, promoting high standards has proven to boost achievement in a way affirmative action never has and never will.  
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The best kind of affirmative action is that which will teach children the discipline they need to advance in the educational and professional arena.  
<p>

Richard Weaver's seminal book "Ideas Have Consequences" could be our theme today, despite the fact that it was published almost 50 years ago. The remarkable growth of the Internet proves again the power of ideas to reshape how Americans communicate with each other, and the world. <p>
The Heritage Foundation's World Wide Web site was created to spread the ideas of free enterprise, limited government, individual freedom, traditional American values, and a strong national defense, the same ideas which caused a political revolution in the 1994 elections. As Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich declared just after the election: "Heritage is, without question, the most far-reaching conservative
organization in the country in the war of ideas, and one which has had a tremendous impact not just in Washington, but literally across the planet." 
<p>
As a leader in both the political and communications revolutions taking place today, The Heritage Foundation will continue to demonstrate the power of our ideas well into the 21st century.

<P>	<B><FONT SIZE="+2">T</FONT></B>he alienation of African-American men from the churches of their communities 
is perhaps the single greatest tragedy facing black America. "While 75 percent of the 
mosque is male, 75 percent of the black church is female," laments Jawanza Kunjufu, 
author of <I>Adam Where Are You?: Why Most Black Men Don't Go to Church</I>. It wasn't 
always so: In earlier generations, black men were much more involved in the church, and 
their religious faith bolstered their commitment to families and neighborhoods. The most 
effective way to reduce black crime, and to strengthen black families, may be to return 
African-American men to their spiritual roots.</P>
<P>	A church in Baltimore that is itself returning to its roots is making great headway 
in its ministry to men. Bethel AME Church, founded in 1785, is the second-oldest church 
in the African Methodist Episcopal denomination and a venerable institution squarely in 
the black political mainstream. Bethel hosted much of the NAACP's national summit last 
year. Its pastor, Frank Madison Reid III, is the son and grandson of AME bishops, and his 
step-brother is Baltimore Mayor Kurt Schmoke. Reid was educated at Yale University 
and Harvard Divinity School. A veteran of the civil-rights movement, he served later as 
pastor of Ward AME Church, an important congregation in Los Angeles. He has earned a 
black belt in karate, a prominent image as a local television personality, and a position as 
an intellectual leader of the African-American church.</P>

<H3>A Growing Concern</H3>
<P>	When Reid, 43, was named pastor of Bethel in 1989, the congregation had 7,000 
members, 25 percent of them men. Today, its membership numbers 10,000, 40 percent of 
whom are men. Each week, 4,400 of the faithful attend one of the two Sunday services, 
and 45 percent of them are men. Secular agencies and politicians who want to improve 
urban life should take note of Reid's ministry. Black men in his congregation have 
reconciled with their wives, resumed responsibilities to their children and communities, 
committed themselves to becoming productive citizens, and dedicated themselves to God.</P>
<P>	Rare among traditional black churches, economic classes mix at Bethel. The 
church is located in the Druid Hill section of Baltimore, a historically working-class 
neighborhood now infested with drugs and dilapidated public-housing projects, but it 
draws its membership from middle-class suburbs as well as the surrounding 
neighborhood. At services, blue-jean-clad youths pray while holding hands with middle-
aged professionals and families dressed in their Sunday best.</P> 
<P>	Reid attributes the growth of his congregation to a return to its Methodist roots. 
The Methodist movement, started by Charles and John Wesley in England in the 18th 
century, was spread throughout America by preachers such as George Whitefield. When 
Richard Allen and other blacks were barred from praying in a Methodist church in 
Philadelphia in the late 1700s, they established the AME church. Early Methodism 
emphasized moral rectitude and discipline, revivalism, the study of Scripture in Bible 
groups, and personal conversion. The movement played a leading role in the national 
crusades against drunkenness and slavery. "We meet the spiritual needs of the people 
because of our focus on prayer and the mystical nature of connection between the 
individual human being and the Holy Spirit," says Reid.</P>
<P>	Worship at Bethel is boisterous; dancing and shouting infuse the atmosphere. 
Reid sees this as a return to the spirit of early Methodism, when religious intensity 
energized powerful campaigns for the betterment of society. Reid points with pride to the 
18th-century English Methodists who "went into the prisons and streets with a revival 
that saved England from the same revolutionary fate as France." And he cites as a model 
the 1870s revival at Philadelphia's Bethel AME Church, which prompted a moral uplift 
in the city's black population.</P>
<P>	Reid's ministry to men is in the early Methodist tradition of vigorous outreach to 
the unchurched, wherever they may be found. As the pastor of Ward AME in the early 
1980s, Reid concluded that the church wasn't addressing the needs of young men on the 
street. He also wondered why black males were joining the Nation of Islam or Los 
Angeles gangs like the Bloods and Crips, but not the Protestant churches. "Jesus said, `I 
will make you fishers of men,' " he says. "But either the church wasn't using the right 
bait or the lines weren't strong enough to bring the fish into the church."</P> 
<P>	How does Reid reel the men in at Bethel?  His television services encourage men 
to visit the church.  Highly approachable, he invites men to attend his church when he 
meets them on Baltimore's streets in his daily travels.  His use of the term "brother" 
suggests kinship and inspires male members to actively urge their friends to accompany 
them to Bethel.</P>  
<P>	Reid also uses a four-step plan that relies on "respect" for black males, teaching 
the "roots" of Christianity, "reformation" of habits, and "resurrection" of lives.  At 
Sunday services, male visitors are welcomed with applause and hugs. "We want to 
express our joy for your presence in the Lord's house," Reid says from the pulpit.</P>   
<P>	 Reid recently invited Louis Farrakhan of the Nation of Islam to speak at Bethel. 
Reid disagrees with Farrakhan's theology and racial and religious separatism. But Reid 
wanted men who are attracted to Farrakhan to be exposed to a church that emphasizes 
Christian manliness.</P>
<P>	Men who visit Bethel also find an atmosphere that is masculine as well as 
feminine, unlike many of the churches they are used to. At age 13 or so, many black 
youths tend to drop out of church. "At that age, black males who were once drawn to the 
choir as youth no longer sing, because robes look like dresses," says Reid. "Their Sunday 
school teacher, superintendent, and youth adviser are women. Their reaction to the 
religious femininity of the church drives them out of the church and into the seduction of 
a gang."</P>
<P>	At Bethel, men as well as women occupy important board and teaching positions, 
and Reid makes sure that men won't have to leave the church to find opportunities for 
brotherhood. In addition to all-female Bible study and family Bible programs, Bethel 
offers weekly all-male Bible classes. There, stories from Scripture inspire men to talk 
freely about difficulties in their relations with women, and--Reid calls this a common 
problem among black men--the resentment they may feel toward absent, domineering, or 
abusive fathers.</P> 
<P>	Every November, Bethel hosts a month-long celebration of men. Last year's 
activities included a retreat, African martial-arts experts, scholarly lectures, a Men's Day 
with noted personalities like talk-show host Tony Brown, and a week-long revival service 
at which 67 men, including some substance abusers, joined the church. </P>
<P>	Reid also attracts men to Bethel by setting strict standards of individual moral 
responsibility. Foul language, lying, cheating, and adultery are simply not tolerated. No 
drinking, smoking, or blasphemy is allowed in the congregation. In his sermons, Reid 
cautions the men against excessive anger, spitefulness, and abusive behavior created by 
high stress and low self-esteem. He advises them to restrain their anger through a close 
relationship with Christ. "If men are unable to handle their emotions," he says, "then they 
become prime candidates for abusing their wives or girlfriends and children, as well as 
their friends and neighbors and, ultimately, the community."</P>
<P>	Reid is convinced that exacting standards of behavior do not drive men away, but 
attract them. Men are empowered by morality, he says; they gain courage and conviction 
when they know they are acting responsibly. He argues that the appeal of Malcolm X and 
Louis Farrakhan comes more from their moral authority than their religion. Christianity, 
too, must emphasize its firmness along with its love and compassion. "Jesus drew strong 
fishermen to him," Reid says. "His moral authority was a magnet."</P>
<P>	Reid challenges the males in his congregation to be men rather than boys. "You 
can be 65 and still be a boy," he preaches. "You can be 45, married with children, and 
still be a boy. The difference between a boy and a man is that a man loves God and takes 
responsibility for himself and others."</P> 
<P>	Many congregants fail to live up to the church's standards. But all men are 
welcome. No stigma is placed on former convicts and drug-abusers. At each service, Reid 
asks men who have been incarcerated to stand and be applauded. Reid preaches that 
everybody in the church is sinful, citing the biblical injunction, "We were born in sin and 
shaped in iniquity, and we all have fallen short of the glory of God." </P>
<P>	Bethel provides wrongdoers with encouragement coupled with discipline. Biblical 
passages are cited to show why the behavior in question is wrong. The church is firm in 
response to wrongful deeds, but forgiving. The man admits his error, and he and Reid 
discuss ways to make restitution and bring healing for the wrongs he has committed. Reid 
strongly emphasizes restitution, arguing that one has a responsibility to bring wholeness 
to that which one has broken.</P>
<P>	Changa Onyanga used to be a lieutenant in the drug culture. When he first entered 
Bethel to visit a former member of his gang, he had no respect for ministers like Reid. "I 
looked him up and down and pressed on." Onyanga says now. "I did not speak to him. 
Besides, preachers had a bad rap because they were not doing anything for people who 
needed a cause to champion."</P>
<P>	Reid noted Onyanga's "terrible disposition" and responded. "No one walks 
around this church and does not speak," Reid said to him. "We are friendly and we speak 
to one another as Christians should." Reid had Onyanga's friend talk to him and teach 
him about the decorum of his church. Onyanga has since joined Bethel.</P>
<P>	In preaching personal responsibility, Reid acknowledges his own errors. Happily 
married with two daughters, eight and two, Reid also fathered a son out of wedlock 
during an earlier pastorate in Charlotte, North Carolina. "I do not deny my 15-year-old 
son," says Reid. "He is a reality." Although his son lives with the mother, Reid remains a 
significant part of his life. He provides monetary and moral support and communicates 
regularly. Reid even has him stand up in the congregation when he comes to visit.</P>
<P>	Reid tells the men that he has been where some of them are. Once they see that 
their spiritual leader is not above temptation, he believes, the men in his congregation can 
grapple more easily with issues of manhood and sexuality. </P>
<P>	Reid argues that spiritual leaders must be honest with men about their own 
failings. Some black men resist attending church because they regard the preachers as 
hypocrites. Reid chides his fellow clergy for not practicing what they preach. "Just 
because they received the calling," he says, "does not mean they are above the struggle or 
the contradictions." Citing St. Augustine and other great religious teachers who have 
acknowledged their sinfulness, he says pastors must realize they are preaching to 
themselves as well as to their congregations. </P>
<P>	Reid's ministry to men includes working with women to restore male authority in 
the home. Men will be better fathers and husbands and will participate more willingly in 
church and community life, Reid argues, if they are allowed to exercise authority as head 
of the household. This does not mean tyranny or dictatorial control, but rather loving 
responsibility. Reid teaches men to be the protector, priest, provider, and partner of the 
household. The Old Testament instructs the man to be "watchman for his family."</P>
<P>	"We teach that the man should be the first person his wife goes to for prayer," 
Reid says. "If there is need for the pastor to come into the household, then it should be to 
pray for the family. But that can only happen if the man takes the leadership in making 
prayer a part of the household. The man should take the leadership for making sure Bible 
study is part of family life." Reid preaches that wives should submit to their husbands, 
but also that husbands must not abuse this authority. "Paul's letter to the Ephesians 
teaches us: `Woman, submit thyself if your man loves you as Jesus loves the church,' "  
he says. "If the husband does not love his wife as Jesus loved the church, then she has no 
responsibility to submit to him. We submit to Jesus out of the fact that he loved us." </P>
<P>	The principle of male headship does not mean that the husband must be the 
primary breadwinner. "We teach the men that wives' earnings should not bruise their 
ego," says Reid. "A husband should be thankful when a woman who earns more, or has 
more education, looks to him as protector and provider." The word "provider," Reid 
points out, comes from the Latin for "seeing." It means supplying a family's vision as 
much as providing its material sustenance.</P>
<P>	Reid also teaches women how to respond to men in the household. Annette 
Brown, for example, used Reid's sermon on "a loving God" to endure six years of 
estrangement from her husband, Kevin. "There were times when my husband was gone 
for four days without contact," says Brown, "but pastor Reid's message told me to look 
beyond his faults and see his needs." Annette and Kevin are back together, and their 
relationship is stronger. He has joined Bethel and resumed his role as father of their two 
sons. He has even begun to prepare for the ministry.</P>
<P>	Brown is the religious leader and disciplinarian of the household. He is also in 
charge of sex education. Brown settles family decisions after family prayer. Matters in 
which he reserves the final say include private school for their children, vacations, family 
transportation, his work hours, visits to relatives, and house-buying. But his wife controls 
the household finances. She submits to him because he submits to the church. "Kevin 
takes the authority in the household," she says. "When there is a decision, he makes the 
final decision." She reserves the right to veto any decision not in the family's best 
interest, but she adheres to Biblical scripture: Better to live on a corner of the roof than 
share a house with a quarrelsome wife. "I always uplift my husband," she says.</P>
<P>	Reid denies that this approach oppresses women. "I have not talked to a single 
African-American woman," he says, "who has said `no' when I have asked whether she 
would gladly submit to a man who loved Christ, who provided for her and her children, 
who would protect her, and was spiritual. They recognize that the submission would not 
be an oppressive submission, but a submission in partnership." </P>
<P>	Reid encourages men to marry or, if they are separated, to reunite with the 
mothers of their children. But he does not always counsel marriage. "It makes no sense," 
he says, "to push together a couple that does not love each other. If the mother has 
become pregnant for the wrong reasons--out of lust, for example, or to get welfare 
payments--then it may not be possible for the father to exercise loving authority as head 
of the household."</P>
<P>	"In an ideal world, it is easy to say, `if you make a baby, then marry the mother,' " 
Reid says. "But as a pastor, I have to deal with the hard facts of family conflict. What 
happens to the child who grows up in a home where the parents hate each other because 
you made them get married? The child will grow up with their hostility and take it out 
into the world."</P> 
<P>	Reid thinks public policy treats African-American men with illegitimate children 
too harshly. He is especially troubled by a court system that cuts fathers off from their 
children. Men are presumed guilty in disputes over child support; visitation can be denied 
at the mother's request. Reid says the system "tortures fathers, who often want to do the 
right thing for their children, and is unfairly slanted toward the mother."</P>
<P>	According to Reid, models of Christian manhood from African and African-
American history are essential in attracting black men to church. Before becoming full 
members of Bethel, men must spend an hour with the pastor, who teaches them about 
Africans in the Bible and African-American church history. In this portion of his 
ministry, which he calls "roots," Reid tries to dispel the notion that Christianity is a 
Eurocentric, slave masters' religion. He teaches about the Africans Simeon (also called 
Niger) and Lucius of Cyrene, who ordained the Apostle Paul and Silas. He talks about the 
black abolitionist David Walker, who in 1829 published an anti-slavery tract known as 
the Appeal. This seminal publication demanded the end of slavery and appealed to the 
"God of the Ethiopians." </P> 
<P>	Another of Reid's models of black Christian manhood is Bishop Henry McNeil 
Turner. Born a slave in South Carolina, Turner became the first black chaplain of the 
Union army, a member of the South Carolina Legislature, and an advocate for the black 
emigration to Africa in 1874. His status as a bishop in the African Methodist Episcopal 
Church allowed him to carry the African-American religious tradition to South Africa 
more than 100 years ago. </P> 
<P>	Reid also likes to point out to his African-American audience that Jesus may not 
have been as European-looking as Hollywood and other forms of  popular culture 
typically have portrayed him--white, blue-eyed, and fair-haired. He quotes a passage 
from the Old Testament book of Daniel that describes the Messiah, whose "feet were like 
burnished brass and his hair was like lamb's wool," and the New Testament book of 
Revelation, which similarly describes Jesus with feet "like bronze glowing in a furnace." 
Some church members, such as Charles Wiggins, say they were greatly affected by 
Reid's more raw, human portrait of Christ. "I had never heard a minister talk about Jesus 
who looked like me," says Wiggins, who joined in 1991. "I have found a home."</P>
<P>	Reid brings in guest lecturers to talk about African-American manhood. In a 
recent program, Na'im Akbar, a Florida State psychologist who is an expert on black 
male psychology, urged men at Bethel to learn from "the courage of Dr. King, the 
defiance of the honorable Elijah Muhammed, the economic strategy of Booker T. 
Washington, and the uncompromising integrity of Paul Robeson."</P>
<P>	Reid encourages the men to spiritually mold young males of the community. 
Through Project RAISE, they mentor teenagers from local schools. The men do not 
pressure them to join the church, but some do, attending Sunday services and Bible study 
with their mentors.</P>
<P>	After a small riot erupted at Booker T. Washington Junior High School just before 
Christmas last year, Bethel began a direct partnership with the school. To prevent a 
reoccurrence, Reid summoned 150 men to the school. They lined the street in front of the 
school and remained watchful for arsonists, gangs, and visiting troublemakers. At the 
request of the principal, the men recently returned to supervise the children in the 
morning and afternoon. The pupils' tranquillity prompted one teacher to comment that 
they were "acting like children again."</P>
<P>	Bethel assists men in running their households. In the class for new members, 
men are shown how to allocate their earnings. The 10-10-80 plan is a voluntary financial-
management procedure wherein 10 percent of the new member's yearly earnings is 
contributed to the church. Another 10 percent goes into a savings account, while the 
remainder is used for living expenses. </P>
<P>	Men who need additional help in managing their finances can attend classes on 
preparing tax returns, taught by a CPA who donates her time. Bethel has helped its 
members form food co-ops and investment clubs for pooling risk capital, purchasing 
bonds and mutual funds, and setting up funds for children's college tuition.</P>
<P>	Reid and members of the congregation also find jobs for men. Some have 
convictions for crack use, weapons possession, or other felonies, while others possess 
little or no high school or college education. But Reid and other officers at Bethel often 
vouch for the character of church members who might not look good on paper.</P>
<P>	Reid himself hires men as security guards for the church. The security team not 
only protects the church and its membership; it gives young men the opportunity to 
"soldier"--to wear a uniform, carry walkie-talkies, use one's physical strength, and 
become close friends with other men. Reid argues that these are the principal lures of 
being in a gang. So why not channel these male yearnings into structures that help build 
spiritual soldiers?</P>
<P>	The security guards are called the Mighty Men of God after the warriors who 
followed King David.  There is no better symbol than these men of Reid's teaching that 
Christianity is a manly as well as a womanly religion. The Mighty Men of God hold 
respected positions in the church, including the leader of Bible study, sexton, and security 
guard. They are responsible for the safety of the congregation and community, and 
combat random crime with periodic community patrolling. </P>
<P>	The M.M.O.G. play an important role in the safety of the children who attend 
Bethel's day school. They greet parents and students each morning as they arrive. During 
the day, they guard against intruders and drug sales. At the end of the day, a Mighty Man 
of God sees each child safely across the street.</P>
<P>	The regimen of the M.M.O.G. requires discipline. They meet for two hours every 
Tuesday and Saturday. Officers open the meetings with a personal inspection. They 
check for fresh haircuts, cleanshaven faces, and shined shoes. Members are not allowed 
to smoke or drink, so officers check for burns and yellow stains from nicotine or 
marijuana. M.M.O.G. maintain two uniforms: a suit and a security outfit for guarding the 
church.</P>
<P>	After prayer, they discuss local and international events. Drilling, marching, and 
commands soon fill the room. An inspirational message from Reid follows, and the group 
closes with hand-holding prayer.</P>
<P>	One member of the Mighty Men of God is Max Taylor. After joining Bethel at the 
age of 18, Taylor joined forces with local drug dealers and descended into the world of 
drugs, guns, and violence. He was responsible for preparing street corners for potential 
drug sales. "I cleaned street corners for drug dealers by any means necessary," says 
Taylor, 29. He reached a point, he says, when he realized that if he continued he would 
soon "be dead or behind bars for a long time if I was arrested."</P>
<P>	In 1992, Taylor rejoined the church with rejuvenated purpose. He walked through 
local housing complexes challenging drug dealers, his old friends, for territory. "I was 
extremely cold and ruthless," says Taylor, "but due to the power of Frank Reid and God, 
I have changed."</P>

<P>	<B><FONT SIZE="+2">S</FONT></B>peaking in Galesburg, Illinois, in January, President Clinton proposed a federally 
funded job-training program "to keep the American Dream alive in the 21st century." 
Cost to American taxpayers: $3.5 billion a year.</P>
<P>	If he had driven about an hour north, Clinton could have visited a college campus 
that proves his program is unnecessary. DeVry Institute of Technology, headquartered in 
Oakbrook, Illinois, makes a handsome profit by offering a first-rate technical education to 
working-class students. This little-known school shows how private businesses 
outperform government in providing good job training.</P>
<P>	On 13 campuses from Atlanta to Los Angeles, more than 15,000 students--35 
percent of whom are black or Latino--are earning their bachelor's of science degrees at 
DeVry. Ninety-four percent of the school's graduates land jobs in their fields of study 
within six months, with an average starting salary exceeding $24,000 a year.</P>
<P>	DeVry's alumni enjoy cutting-edge technical careers. At Hughes 
Communications, the nation's largest satellite company, 22 of the 30 engineers 
responsible for orbit maintenance are DeVry graduates. KLA Instruments, which designs 
quality-control systems for the manufacture of microchips, boasts that a fifth of its 1,000 
employees graduated from DeVry. All this at an annual cost per student of $2,500 less 
than similar state-run programs.</P>
<P>	And DeVry posted a $12-million profit on revenues of  $211 million last year to 
boot.</P>

<H3>Selling Job Opportunity</H3>
<P>	Since its founding in 1931 by Herman DeVry, the inventor of the portable 
motion-picture projector, the institute has specialized in technical training that leads to 
lucrative careers. DeVry, which grants accredited bachelor's degrees, is a for-profit 
venture whose stock trades on the NASDAQ exchange. In short, it sells job opportunity.</P>
<P>	Five years ago, when Zaneta Rizzo graduated from a small high school in rural 
Louisiana, she "knew less than nothing" about computers, thought DOS was pronounced 
"dose," and was terrified of automatic-teller machines.</P>
<P>	After two years of bouncing among jobs in fast-food restaurants, Rizzo enrolled at 
DeVry's Dallas campus. Recently she graduated with a bachelor's degree in computer 
information systems and is deciding between several job offers with computer-training 
firms. Before DeVry, Rizzo's salary peaked at $760 a month. Her current offers are for 
$25,000 a year--a 275 percent pay hike.</P>
<P>	When Jeri Gomez graduated from high school near Fresno, California, she 
enrolled in a local community college to study the health sciences and dance, but classes 
were constantly being canceled, so she enlisted in the army. After serving in Desert 
Storm, Gomez enrolled at DeVry's Pomona campus. She is now deciding among several 
job offers in software programming that pay more than $30,000 a year.</P>
<P>	Rizzo's and Gomez's stories are typical of DeVry students, many of whom field 
multiple job offers before their commencement. In fact, more than 95 percent of 
engineering and accounting majors are placed in their fields within six months of 
graduation--a success rate many of the nation's top schools never approach. How does 
DeVry do it? By running the college like a business.</P>
<P>	Unlike most colleges, DeVry receives no direct government money or alumni 
gifts. Nearly all revenues, and therefore profits, come from tuition. And DeVry has found 
that the best way to attract more students--over half of whom are the first in their 
families to attend college--is to secure high-paying jobs for graduates. Dennis Keller, 
DeVry's chief executive officer, says the school avoids anything that doesn't help 
students find careers.</P>
<P>	To this end, DeVry maintains an enormous placement system with more than 100 
staffers and a database of thousands of employers. While most other schools in the 
country assign placement officers to handle a broad spectrum of careers, DeVry has 
found that employers prefer to communicate with staffers who understand their particular 
needs. For this reason, each officer is trained in a specific field. For instance, Motorola--
which is based near DeVry's DuPage County campus in northern Illinois--works closely 
with staffers specializing in telecommunications. The payoff has been tremendous. When 
the electronics giant was planning a major expansion in Illinois, it consulted DeVry 
placement officials in advance to secure an educated labor force.</P>
<P>	DeVry also edges out the competition by studying labor trends, nationally as well 
as in the local markets near each campus. DeVry does not depend on the federal 
government's research, which is mostly retrospective; its researchers analyze new and 
growing fields. Using data from interviews with small and large employers, annual 
alumni surveys, and more than a dozen local-industry advisory panels, DeVry graduates 
can target rapidly emerging areas that traditional schools miss. Relying on data from the 
Bureau of Labor Statistics, for instance, most colleges until recently paid little attention to 
the cellular industry. DeVry officials, on the other hand, adjusted their 
telecommunications curriculum eight years ago to include this technology, and 
subsequently launched the careers of many graduates. "Health care is the next big one," 
says Norman Metz, a senior vice president at DeVry. "We are currently focusing on the 
medical-equipment industry that will handle the graying of America."</P>
<P>	Despite these unsurpassed placement results, the Clinton administration has 
frowned upon for-profit schools like DeVry, insisting the capitalist model leads to a 
useless education. At a 1993 press conference, Labor Secretary Robert Reich told 
journalists to be wary of these institutions, claiming that they mismatch thousands of 
students, and that there is no market for their degrees. Reich's warning was reiterated by 
the media, including the Cleveland Plain Dealer, which urged some for-profit schools to 
carry "warning labels" detailing prospective students' chances of finding employment 
after graduation. In fact, if many state schools had to publish such information, students 
would likely flock to DeVry.</P>

<H3>Blood, Sweat, and Jobs</H3>
<P>	Some for-profit trade schools, to be sure, are little more than diploma mills that 
give gullible students a shlock education. These schools usually go bankrupt when 
students catch on that their degree leads nowhere. But for an institution that is in business 
for the long haul, producing high-quality education for satisfied customers is essential to 
growth and profitability. Keller believes that every graduate represents the school: If an 
employer is unsatisfied with the quality of a single graduate's work, he is unlikely to hire 
from DeVry in the future. That would ultimately harm the bottom line.</P>
<P>	To that end, the school maintains a demanding curriculum that students call 
"brutal" and Keller calls "tough love." It is a no-frills, lots-of-sweat education. The 
rigorous process begins even before the classes start. Although the school accepts SAT 
and ACT test scores--applicants average at the 45th percentile--all students are required 
to take DeVry's admissions test in math. About 14 percent of the applicants fail the exam. 
Of the remaining students, about a quarter are admitted on the condition that they take 
remedial classes. Applicants are also required to take a College Board English test that 
determines their placement in humanities courses.</P>
<P>	From the first day, students follow the curriculum in lockstep. There are no 
electives. Students immediately choose a major from among five fields: electronics-
engineering technology, computer information systems, business operations, 
telecommunications management, or accounting. Each major requires eight or nine 
semesters, and can be completed in three years with summer school.</P>
<P>	Students and DeVry's senior management both prefer this inflexible system. Like 
a manufacturer, the school desires a reputation for providing a consistent "product"; 
students say they enjoy receiving firm direction. "This gets rid of a lot of the time-
wasting filler classes, like underwater basket-weaving, that people take elsewhere," 
recalls Rose Huening, a 1986 graduate.</P>

<H3>Heavy Lifting</H3>
<P>	Here there is no time to waste. Each term, DeVry students take at least four 
classes, plus labs, often exceeding a conventional courseload by four to six credit hours. 
The first-year courseload for computer information systems is typical: five computer-
science classes, four computer labs, two math courses and a math lab, two English 
courses with one writing lab, an economics course, a psychology course, and a business 
course. In addition, since many of the students have never before been pushed to work so 
hard, all freshmen enroll in a class on "success strategies," which teaches study skills and 
time-management techniques.</P>
<P>	George Dean, the vice president for educational planning, believes that many 
traditional colleges waste a great deal of energy embracing new teaching methods. DeVry 
doesn't mandate teaching methods--professors can choose whatever textbooks they 
want--but the level of academic expectations is set at the head office, and it's set high. 
"At the end of the course, the students have to be able to do x and y and z," Dean says. 
"If it works better at the Columbus campus to teach it z then y then x, it doesn't bother 
me."</P>
<P>	Dean is comfortable giving the professors ample latitude because they are 
required to gain real-world experience in their field, and so tend to prefer the most 
practical methods. Although some students earn money for tuition by assisting faculty 
members, they are prohibited from teaching, and are usually limited to grading papers.</P>
<P>	Unlike trade schools that teach specific skills (many of which become obsolete as 
technology changes), DeVry's curriculum focuses on teaching students how to reason. In 
many ways, DeVry offers the liberal-arts version of a technical education: students learn 
how to solve technical problems. They are drilled thoroughly on the basics, and required 
to spend countless hours in the lab to build an educational foundation. On exams, 
students are rarely asked straight-forward mathematical questions; instead, they are 
usually given detailed descriptions of real-world problems, including information they 
must recognize as extraneous. Dean claims that this education prepares students to 
operate efficiently in the business world. Furthermore, teachers will fail students whose 
lab reports are not written in proper English, regardless of the experiment's outcome. 
DeVry doesn't shortchange the humanities, because these non-technical abilities will be 
vital to the students' careers. Alumni routinely tell Dean that the technical skills get them 
hired and the reasoning skills get them promoted.</P>
<P>	 A student with a grade point average below a "C" is placed on academic 
probation, and prohibited from taking a relaxed schedule. If the student's g.p.a. remains 
below a "C" average the following semester, he or she is expelled. Every year, 20 percent 
of the student body flunks out. DeVry does not pamper its students en route to the 
diploma. "We have hard classes, but if that is not met with enough commitment to be 
successful, then it is detrimental to this company for that student to stay," Keller says. 
Huening's class is a perfect example: of the 325 students who started, only 94 graduated 
on time.</P> 
<P>	Just as auto manufacturers are constantly reviewing the efficiency of their cars, 
DeVry maintains strict quality control. About a decade ago, DeVry was reviewing each 
course every three years, which was considered swift compared to traditional schools. 
Now it rewrites each course at least once a year. During the summer term, faculty 
members visit hundreds of employers across the nation and find out what their needs will 
be in five to 10 years. Together with information offered by industry leaders on DeVry's 
dozen or so curriculum-advisory boards, the school sets new course requirements. For 
instance, a few years ago most computer-programming courses only taught a 
programming language called COBOL, but professors noted that firms near some of their 
campuses were switching from mainframes to desktop-based systems that require C 
language. After DeVry adjusted its curriculum, businesses responded by hiring more of 
its graduates. Although industry does not dictate DeVry's curriculum, the school must 
measure success and failure by its placement rate.</P>
<P>	The institute's educational audit is exhaustive. DeVry's central headquarters 
evaluates randomly selected writing samples from students on every campus twice a year 
in order to ensure that writing skills remain high. The institute also administers 
standardized tests in electronics to be certain that technical skills are not dropping. 
Finally, administrators also investigate courses with unusual grade distribution.</P>
<P>	The best evidence of the quality of DeVry's curriculum is the on-the-job success 
of its graduates. Bill Buglewicz, a senior manufacturing manager at KLA Instruments, 
recruits at six of the campuses every year. "DeVry students have a great work ethic, 
higher motivation, and initiative," Buglewicz says. "The courseload, in particular the 
exhaustive lab work, makes them wonderful thinkers and troubleshooters."</P> 
<P>	Gary Nuzzi, a 1983 graduate, says the lab work helped him and 1963 graduate 
Bill Blethen develop a revolutionary lighting system that won an Academy Award for 
technical achievement last year. The portable strobe light allows movie cameras to 
capture detail at high speed. "The education was, at times, very challenging, but very 
practical," Nuzzi adds.</P> 

<H3>The Bottom Line</H3>
<P>	Most remarkable, however, is that DeVry makes a profit. By defining its mission 
narrowly, the school has perfected its product and minimized waste. DeVry's cost-saving 
efforts are immediately evident. There are no ivy-laden academic halls or rolling greens. 
Rather, each DeVry campus holds its classes in an office building that is usually 
surrounded by a parking lot. In such a modern facility, little space is wasted, maintenance 
costs are moderate, and classrooms can accommodate professors from various 
departments. And the school runs three cycles of classes--morning, afternoon, and 
evening--to use the space more efficiently. The institute does not own any dormitories. 
Instead, DeVry leases housing near its campuses from local landlords and sublets it to the 
students at a modest profit.</P>
<P>	DeVry also holds down costs by maintaining a narrow academic focus. DeVry 
does not fund any sports teams or clubs that are not directly related to job placement; on 
some campuses, students independently run intramural leagues by securing outside 
sponsors. "We are not trying to be all things to all people," says Kathy Perdue, head of 
the accounting department at the Atlanta campus. "We figured out what we do best, 
concentrating on the academics to get jobs, not filling social needs."</P>
<P>	The school does not grant tenure to any of its professors, allowing it to respond 
quickly to fluctuating enrollments. Moreover, DeVry is not a research or publishing 
institution, so faculty members carry teaching loads two to three times that of other 
college professors. Finally, since the school operates at full capacity, even in the 
summers, professors are expected to work as they would in private industry: year-round.
<P>	DeVry maximizes tuition revenue by actively recruiting students through 
television and newspaper advertising, direct mail, and recruiters. A traveling sales force 
of 200 visits high schools and Army bases throughout North America, while another 100 
salespeople respond to applicants who call DeVry in response to advertising. DeVry's 
$15-million advertising campaign promotes its focus on careers, profiling graduates with 
senior positions in prominent companies like Coca-Cola.</P>
<P>	The individual cost-saving measures add up. The price tag of a DeVry education 
is $6,015 for two semesters, or $26,730 for the complete degree. By comparison, a four-
year degree at public, non-research universities in the same states where DeVry operates 
costs much more in tuition and taxpayer subsidies: $40,148 in California, for instance, 
and $35,440 in Georgia.</P>
<P>	As an accredited school, DeVry participates in all the same financial aid programs 
as public schools. DeVry's loan default rate is 17 percent--better than many for-profit 
trade schools and far below the government's intervention zone of 25 to 30 percent. 
Industry analysts note that the institute's job placement record and bachelor's degree 
program distinguishes it from trade schools.</P>
<P>	For-profit schools such as DeVry are a model for the future of university 
education. As more adults return to school later in life, they will find they prefer the no-
nonsense DeVry degree, which can be finished in three years. Currently the average age 
of DeVry students is 26. In addition, the number of high-school graduates is expected to 
keep rising through 2013. Combine that statistic with downsizing in the military, for-
profit education's top rival for high-school graduates, and DeVry seems to enjoy a rosy 
outlook. In fact, the results are already beginning to show: Enrollment was up 4 percent 
this year, and the company added two new campuses. "Frankly, the demand is growing 
quicker than our ability to supply it," says Norman Levine, DeVry's chief financial 
officer. And two other for-profit college-education companies announced initial public 
offerings this year.</P>
<P>	Despite DeVry's proven track record in securing jobs for working-class students, 
bureaucrats may prevent the school from expanding. In New York City, for example, the 
state's department of education has not yet approved DeVry's 1993 accreditation 
application. Once the department okays the school's academic standards, government 
analysts will determine DeVry's impact on established local schools. Every college in 
New York City will be invited to comment on DeVry's entrance into the market. If area 
schools fear DeVry will steal students from their tuition rolls, they can urge the 
department to reject the application. The Education Department's Bureau of Planning will 
also analyze whether the local job market can accommodate the future DeVry graduates. 
Department officials note that, due to understaffing, it normally takes several years for a 
school's 300-page application to be approved.</P>
<P>	Even skeptics of for-profit education concede that public schools and private non-
profits are unable to expand to meet the growing demand. Public universities would 
require greater tax subsidies to support a larger student base, and private non-profits 
would have to raise even more through alumni giving. "Time and time again, we have 
seen that the healthiest and best systems in the world involve private enterprise 
competing," says Keller. "We're the future of education."</P>

<blockquote>

We must restore a balance between citizen and police responsibilities, [for] effective social control cannot possibly be achieved by hired hands alone.
</blockquote><p>

-- Herman Goldstein, <i>Policing a Free Society
</i><p>
	Americans live in fear. We live in the most criminally violent times in our nation's history. The level of street crime is between three and four times what it was in 1960, and the rate of violent crimes quadrupled between 1966 and 1990. People no longer feel safe walking to the corner store or letting their kids bike to the local park.
<p>	In healthy communities, individuals establish and enforce codes of conduct, both formal and informal. Litterers get a lecture. Speeders get yelled at. Unruly youths get a tongue-lashing. But in unhealthy communities, the fear of crime keeps people shut up in their homes (especially the elderly), cuts off commercial activity, alienates individuals from each other, and surrenders the streets to the very kind of disorderly activity that fuels crime in the first place. Community is eroded, and because individuals are afraid to maintain order, the community loses its lawful environment.
<p>	Until neighborhoods are safe again, they will not thrive economically or socially. Waiting for the government to make it all better is a losing strategy. People have to become more involved in ensuring their own security.
<p>	It is said that for every complex problem, there is a simple and elegant solution that is wrong. For crime, the simple answer is, "We need more cops and we need more prisons." Though extremely popular right now with politicians, this approach will ultimately do little to improve public safety. The best police force in the world cannot make safe a community in which people have no regard for the lives or property of others. Without question, swift and sure punishment of criminal activity is an important component of an effective crime policy. But the best defense against crime is not a thin, blue line, but a community of individuals respectful of others. 
<p>	There is a great deal that the government can and should do to improve public safety, but first it must recognize that it needs help. Restoring public safety demands a renewed partnership between the police and the community. Police must reacquaint themselves with the people in the communities they serve, and communities must recognize that the brunt of the task of policing a free society does not lie with the police, but with citizens themselves.
<p>
<b>Community Policing</b><p>
	From the time of America's founding, law enforcement has had a strong neighborhood foundation. In the early years of the Republic, male citizens in large U.S. cities were required to stand watch at night with no pay. Throughout most of America's history, in fact, citizens were expected to police their communities themselves -- at least part time -- as they went about their daily lives. The job of police officers was to support the community in keeping the peace.
<p>	Alexis de Tocqueville, who was particularly impressed by this, wrote, "In America, the means available to the authorities for the discovery of crimes and arrest of criminals are few. . . . Nevertheless, I doubt whether in any other country crime so seldom escapes punishment. . . . During my stay in the United States I have seen the inhabitants of a country where a serious crime had been committed spontaneously forming committees with the object of catching the criminal and handing him over to the courts. In Europe the criminal is a luckless man fighting to save his head from the authorities. In America he is an enemy of the human race and every human being is against him."
<p>	Direct community involvement doesn't mean vigilantes stringing up violators. Urban anthropologist Jane Jacobs explains, "The first thing to understand is that the public space -- the sidewalk and street peace -- of cities is not kept primarily by the police, necessary as police are. Rather, it is kept by an intricate, almost unconscious, network of voluntary controls and standards established and enforced by the people themselves."
<p>	Except in extremely small geographic areas, it is not economically possible to put a cop on every corner. No police department is large enough -- nor should it be -- to serve as an occupying army. A community must police itself. There is no way that New York City's 37,000 police officers can control the city's 7.5 million residents. The police are there to help. For much of America's history, this was understood.
<p>	In the 1960s, however, the public began to forget its role in controlling crime and grew increasingly dependent on the police. Police departments became more professionalized and shifted their primary mission from peacekeeping to crime fighting. Rather than regular beats, foot patrols, and informal pressure on the unruly, police forces increasingly used motorized patrols, radio dispatch, and rapid response as their main tools. In the terminology of television culture, the "Andy of Mayberry" model was replaced by the "One-Adam-Twelve" approach. 
<p>	Americans began to think of crimefighting as the job of police. The riots of the 1960s showed in violent detail how America's historic partnership between police and community had broken down. Police officers -- often in squad cars or behind desks at headquarters -- were spending more time with other officers than with citizens. The new policing methods had the effect of divorcing them from the community. The divorce was mutual: Many communities stopped policing themselves. <p>
	This alienation left everyone worse off. Americans are more dissatisfied with their police departments than ever before, and the police are straining under the weight of massive problems they are powerless to handle alone. 
<p>	Swift and sure punishment for criminals is important, but we shouldn't fool ourselves into thinking that the courts can make us safe, any more than the police can. We will never really get a hold on crime in America until we move back to a society where kids in trouble can be turned around before they get in more trouble and are sent away to prisons to become hardened criminals. "The total impacts [of public policy on crime] are not going to be that great in a free society," says James Q. Wilson. "A free society depends on the conscience and reputations of individuals and the social norms of communities to maintain order. That is what has collapsed in America."
<p>	To use an analogy from the manufacturing world, we can't afford to depend on an outside referee to detect and fix the defective products of our society; far better to create a system that isn't producing so many defects in the first place. From this perspective, product quality is no longer the exclusive responsibility of the inspectors in the quality department; rather, it's everyone's concern. Families come first, police and courts follow.
<p>	With its emphasis on crime prevention, community policing can be a part of the total picture. "We currently see ourselves as feeding the criminal-justice system," says police chief Daryl Stephens of St. Petersburg, Florida. "What if we saw our primary responsibility as starving it?"
<P>	At its heart, neighborhood policing recreates the partnership between the police and the community. In essence, the police tell the community, "We will help you do your job." Variations of the idea are being introduced all over the country, from Jacksonville to Madison to Seattle.
<p>	For community policing to work, the neighborhoods have to be willing to help themselves. Explains San Diego police officer Jim Coleman, "It is not the teacher's fault, it's not the police officer's fault, it's not the court's fault. The community has to recognize it has a responsibility for governing its own value standards. . . . People choose the way they want to live, and police can't remove that responsibility. The police can't come in and restore order if the community doesn't raise its own value standard."
<p>	San Diego has led the nation in embracing a partnership with neighborhood groups, citizen patrols, and volunteer "officers" (see <a href="#sandiego">sidebar</a>). To be sure, in America's toughest communities, where neighborhood control has been overrun by gangs, drug dealers, and a general sense of lawlessness, community policing of the San Diego model may not be enough. Community policing works best in the communities still controlled by law-abiding residents, not criminals. In the neighborhoods where criminals now hold sway, cops will be needed to help law-abiding citizens -- a majority in even the worst inner-city neighborhoods -- regain control and come out from behind their locked doors to augment the police presence. In the long run, however, community members themselves must take responsibility for making their neighborhoods unfriendly to criminals.
<p>
<b>Street Patrols
</b><p>	A key component of community policing is getting more cops back on the neighborhood beat. "Beat integrity," the practice of charging a small group of officers with responsibility for a small area, has hardly been seen since the 1950s. Patrols can be conducted on foot, on bike, in a car, or some combination of these. The beat system increases the connection between law-abiding citizens and the police and gives citizens opportunities to express their concerns. 
<p>	This sense of connection is evident in the community policing of officer Mike Elder, whose beat for the last two years has been a three-square-mile, lower-middle-class area on Indianapolis's south side. Elder's beat includes numerous vacant lots, some boarded-up buildings, and two of the city's worst public-housing projects. As in many cities, Indianapolis's urban sprawl makes it impractical for Elder to patrol his entire beat on foot. However, he makes up for this by spending a good part of each day walking around the housing projects and the neighborhood parks, checking in with store owners, and maintaining open office hours at his field office in the Clearstream housing project.<p>
	Elder is a reassuring presence to public-housing residents tired of living in fear. Before Elder set up shop at Clearstream, says one resident, "there would be gunfights in the project in the middle of the street in broad daylight." Another Clearstream resident, a single mother, says, "Before Mike came in, I wouldn't dare let my kids play outdoors because of the shootings and drug deals going down at all hours of the day and night. People living in projects want a normal life, too -- and we're getting there." After Elder started his beat, the number of service calls from the Clearstream projects to the police dropped from 1,500 in 1991 to 550 in 1993.<p>
	With an intense awareness of the neighborhood, community-based officers can stop crimes before they happen. The officer on the beat hears gossip from casual, informal contact with people. Elder knows most of the residents at his two housing projects. He can count on a dozen or so residents in each project to keep him informed of impending trouble by calling him on his beeper. If any drug dealing is taking place or any strangers are causing trouble, he'll know within a day.
<p>	Assigning officers to regular beats and emphasizing problem-solving can also prompt residents of troubled minority areas to look more favorably on the men and women in blue. Before Elder was assigned to their beat, residents of Clearstream didn't much trust the police. Residents only saw cops when they were responding to incidents, and viewed them as outsiders. With steady contact, Elder has built a relationship of trust. "If we tried to take Elder out of that beat, the residents would be marching on city hall within hours," jokes Michael Beaver, Indianapolis's director of public safety.
<p>	Most cops loathe beat patrols. Many police officers -- particularly those in middle management -- would prefer the safety of their desk jobs over venturing out onto the streets. Hitting the pavement is seen as a demotion by veteran cops, many of whom have worked hard to get off the beat and win an assignment to a specialty unit or to administrative work. 
<p>	Jersey City Mayor Bret Schundler learned the hard way that the opposition to community policing can be intense. When he was elected in 1992, just one cop worked foot patrol in Jersey City; Schundler wanted 300. The force hardly embraced the idea. "Comfortable jobs in all city departments were given as a reward for political service and loyalty," wrote Schundler in <i>Policy Review</i> (Summer 1994). "The patronage system has made assignments to street patrol intolerable."<p>
	The new mayor found himself battling with Jersey City's police union. When Schundler learned that two police officers spent their days delivering interoffice mail, he had them reassigned to street patrol. The police union filed a lawsuit to prevent the move, citing a contract clause that states: "Police work cannot be diminished except through contract negotiation." Like most people, Schundler can't understand how having officers patrol the street diminishes police work. He is fighting the suit.
<p>	Schundler cites union contracts -- supported by state arbitration rules -- as his biggest barrier to successful policing. "Our crime problem is not the result of our spending too little on policing," he says, "but rather of our getting too little policing for our money -- and the root cause of this problem is non-local government interference in police department management."
<p>
<b>Combating Disorder
</b>

<p>	Many urban areas are marked by evidence of physical decay: boarded-up buildings, vacant lots strewn with litter, and graffiti-covered walls. This sense of community despair creates an aura of lawlessness that encourages criminal behavior.
<p>	In a 1982 <i>Atlantic Monthly</i> article titled "Broken Windows," James Q. Wilson and George Kelling argued that disorder in a community, if left uncorrected, undercuts residents' own efforts to maintain their homes and neighborhoods and control unruly behavior. "If a window in a building is broken and left unrepaired," they wrote, "all the rest of the windows will soon be broken. . . . One unrepaired window is a signal that no one cares, so breaking more windows costs nothing. . . . Untended property becomes fair game for people out for fun or plunder."
<p>	If disorder goes unchecked, a vicious cycle begins. First, it kindles a fear of crime among residents, who respond by staying behind locked doors. Their involvement in the neighborhood declines; people begin to ignore rowdy and threatening behavior in public. They cease to exercise social regulation over little things like litter on the street, loitering strangers, or truant schoolchildren. When law-abiding eyes stop watching the streets, the social order breaks down and criminals move in.
<p>	"Stable neighborhoods can change in a few months to jungles," declare Wilson and Kelling. Disorder also can have dire economic consequences. Shoppers will shun an area they perceive as being "out of control." One study analyzing crime in 30 different areas found that the level of disorder of a neighborhood -- more than such factors as income level, resident turnover, or racial makeup -- was the best indicator of an area's lack of safety.
<p>	For decades, most big-city police departments have devoted little effort to combating disorder. By allowing an accumulation of small infractions, this neglect creates an environment that generates big infractions.
<p>	The community-policing movement is beginning to change this. Community policing emphasizes giving neighborhoods a greater say in determining police priorities, a surefire way to bringing issues of physical and social disorder to the top of the police agenda. An important part of a community patrol officer's job is enforcing a community's norms of tolerable behavior and order. Beat officers can't impose their personal rules on a community, but they can help a community maintain its own standards. "You have to be given the latitude to enforce the laws in different ways in different communities," says Indianapolis's Elder.
<p>	Although calls for order maintenance have historically been associated mostly with white middle- and upper-class neighborhoods, today some of the loudest voices are coming from poor minority communities. Says Ace Backus, a Milwaukee community organizer, "In the nice white communities don't be drunk on the street, don't be throwing down litter, the cops will stop you. In the middle of the black ghetto you can do that and the police will drive past. It's reverse discrimination."

<b>Problems, Not Symptoms 
</b>

<p>	Conventional policing is incident-driven: A citizen calls 911 to report a crime and then the police show up. Much of the time, all officers can do at this point is take a report. By reacting to crime rather than trying to prevent crime, police treat only the symptoms, not the root causes of problems. The key to improving New York's subway was the emphasis on preemptive problem solving, an example of what policing experts refer to as "problem-oriented policing" (see <a href="#subway">sidebar</a>).
<P>	Former San Diego Police Chief Bob Burgreen frames the issue this way: "Random patrol duty is little better than sleeping on duty."
<p>	In one large city, for example, a trucking company had 32 trailers burglarized in less than 18 months. A predictable routine developed: The owner would report the crime, the police would visit the yard, take a statement, and then wait for the next call from the owner. In desperation, the owner finally threatened to move his $13-million company out of the city unless something was done to stop the stream of break-ins. 
<p>	This prompted the police department to abandon business as usual. An outside consultant was brought in, and police soon determined that the physical layout of the trucking yard was encouraging the break-ins. The officers talked the owner into improving the lighting and raising the fence. Police then worked with other city agencies to erect a barricade between the truck yard and the adjacent vacant city property that was being used as an escape route. Problem solved.
<p>	Some level of problem-solving occurs in every police department, but it is typically done in a haphazard fashion. San Diego is alone in making problem-solving a focal point of each police officer's daily duties. Because it depends on identifying recurring patterns of disruptive activity, problem-oriented policing depends on good information. 
<p>	San Diego's crime analysis unit has set up a sophisticated computer tracking system that officers can tap into to get information on 60 types of problems, previous attempts to solve specific problems, and recurrent problems in different geographical areas. While problem-solving gives police officers some tools and the analytical framework for approaching community safety problems, community involvement is still a key component. "There are no long-term solutions to problems unless the community is involved," says Nancy McPherson, formerly the city's neighborhood-policing coordinator.
<p>	As already noted, people tend to equate the frequency of crime in an area with how the external environment "looks" and "feels." Visible disorder sends warning signals to our brains of impending danger. Disorder is a sign that the social mechanisms of control that characterize healthy neighborhoods have broken down, which in turn encourages lawlessness. To build safer neighborhoods, individuals and communities must exercise control of the physical environment in which they live. 
<p>
<b>Empowering Landlords
</b><p>

 	Police officers appreciate the role that landlords can play in keeping a neighborhood strong and safe. Historically, landlords in low-income, working-class neighborhoods adhered to the neighborhood's set of norms and refused to rent to individuals who, in the landlord's judgment, would not be a positive force in the neighborhood. This is because landlords, for economic reasons, desire essentially the same thing as neighbors do for social reasons: responsible and conscientious tenants who will respect the property of others.
<p>	In recent years, government regulations, civil-rights laws, and court rulings have made it almost impossible for landlords to turn away dubious renters or to evict destructive tenants from their apartments. The unintended consequence? Many working-class neighborhoods have been ripped apart by rental units that become crack houses.
<p>	Giving homeowners control of their property can help reduce crime. Almost by accident, the city of Milwaukee came up with a simple yet effective way for government to assist, instead of frustrate, landlords who want to maintain neighborhood norms. Marty Collins, a 15-year city employee, was looking for a way to improve the city's drug-addiction prevention program. Knowing that most drug dealing in Milwaukee occurred out of rental properties, Collins reasoned that the only people that really could control the situation are the landlords. 
<p>	Collins surveyed Milwaukee landlords and found that 70 percent of them reported having had destructive tenants at one time or another, yet virtually no landlords were using tenant screening techniques. Why not? "For fear of getting their butts sued," says Collins. Milwaukee's landlords were largely unaware that legal methods were available to enable them to discriminate against prospective tenants with destructive histories. By taking simple precautions, such as requiring favorable recommendations from previous owners, running a credit check, and visiting the current home of prospective renters, homeowners can eliminate the bad apples and help keep their neighborhoods safe.
<p>	Most landlords were also unaware of three Milwaukee companies that provide a listing of all tenants who have been previously evicted from rental properties. Milwaukee now informs all landlords how to be more discriminating.
<p>	While Milwaukee deserves credit for giving landlords the legal leverage they need to protect their property, the city sometimes goes too far in holding landlords responsible for the actions of their tenants. If police receive two complaints about drug dealing at a rented property, Milwaukee undercover police will attempt a drug buy. If successful, the city sends a notice to the landlord instructing him or her to take actions to stop the property from being used for drug dealing. If the problem persists, the city takes the landlord to court and can ask for the property to be forfeited. 
<p>	In essence, Milwaukee is asking the landlord to control their tenants' behavior or risk losing their property. Empowering landlords by allowing them to choose to whom they will and will not rent is one thing. Asking them to be responsible for the actions of their renters is quite another. Providing landlords with the legal assistance to screen and evict disruptive tenants is a step in the right direction, but we shouldn't expect landlords to act as chaperones for their tenants.
<p>	This trend toward relying on landlords to discipline tenants is ironic, for in many cases the most irresponsible landlord of all is the government. Much of the worst crime in America takes place in or around government housing projects. When Reuben Greenberg became the police chief of Charleston, South Carolina, in 1982, he thought it ludicrous that the government routinely rented units to the lowliest criminals of society. "No other landlord has to rent to child molesters, robbers, rapists, and arsonists. Why should people in public housing have to live with them?" asked Greenberg.
<p>	Working with city housing authorities, Greenberg set out to make the city's public housing the last place criminals would dare to set up shop. Prospective tenants were screened for criminal records. Tenants who engaged in illegal behavior were swiftly evicted. Through mostly common-sense measures that any sensible landlord would take, Charleston's public housing projects are now "the safest places to live in Charleston," says department spokesman Charles Francis.
<p>
<b>Closing off Streets</b>
<p>	Americans like to control their space. With their long driveways, high walls, and security systems, wealthier neighborhoods have never been known for their accessibility to outsiders. Wealthy city-dwellers have "doormen" that provide security for their apartment buildings. Middle-class suburbs have their own ways of discouraging strangers, including myriad cul-de-sacs and white picket fences. Residential community associations (RCAs) have taken the concept of designing for safety one step further. The typical RCA has walls, gates, cul-de-sacs, security systems, and an endless series of speed bumps. 
<p> 	In contrast, poor city neighborhoods are typically laid out in a grid format. "By allowing for lots of through traffic, grids compromise a neighborhood's integrity," says Judy Butler, the city of Houston's neighborhood coordinator. The grid format, while pleasing to city traffic engineers, makes neighborhoods susceptible to drive-by shootings and random through-traffic. 
<p> 	While some criticize the suburbs and RCAs for having a "fortress mentality," these communities provide residents with the security they desire, providing physical barriers that give people greater control over their living environment. These barriers not only keep strangers out, they mark the physical boundaries that define communities.
<p>	"Why not try to redesign the urban area to recapture the quality of life in the suburbs?" asks Oscar Newman, a city planner and architect. Newman is the country's leading expert on and proponent of creating "defensible space" in urban neighborhoods by closing off streets. Street closures, Newman has found, give residents greater control over the security of their neighborhood. Closures also broadcast a distinct message to potential criminals: This community is profoundly serious about deterring crime and anti-social behavior.
<p>	St. Louis has a long tradition of street closures. Beginning in the late 19th century, many streets in the wealthiest neighborhoods were deeded to residents instead of the city. Each of the streets was represented by an association that often also owned the sewers and water mains. At the time, St. Louis had shoddy public services, so the private streets were a way of attracting homebuyers by assuring them of reliable services such as water supply and street lighting.
<p>	In the 1950s, St. Louis was in decline. Crime was rising, property values were falling, and much of the middle class was fleeing to the safer and cleaner suburbs. Left behind were poorer residents, less likely to be homeowners and more likely to be transient. To stop the flight of middle-class homeowners out of the city, the city began to revive its private street program. Neighborhoods of all income levels were allowed and encouraged to petition the city to convert their public streets to private ownership. Many middle-class neighborhoods took the city's offer: They formed homeowner associations, put up gates, and assumed the costs and responsibilities of maintaining the streets themselves. 
<p>	Since the mid-1970s, more than 1,000 St. Louis streets have been closed off and privatized. By making these neighborhoods more distinct, street closures have made it easier to identify intruders and keep out unwanted visitors. The result: lower crime rates and higher property values compared to adjacent neighborhoods, according to Newman. It also has made the neighborhoods more cohesive, as they become safe places for children to play and conduits for social activity. "With traffic flow limited to an occasional moving car, the street has become an extension of the front yards of the abutting houses: an area where children play and adults can meet and socialize," writes Newman. Street closures can restore the balance between mobility for cars and livability for residents. 
<p>	Until recently, St. Louis was about the only city that made use of street closures in urban settings. But the increasing levels of crime, gang activity, and drive-by shootings throughout urban America are prompting other cities to experiment with street closures. Cities as diverse as Dallas, Chicago, Houston, Dayton, and Fort Lauderdale are aggressively closing off streets. Though St. Louis is unique in allowing a transfer of ownership to residents, these urban enclaves are proving an effective way for a community to regain control of its environment.
<p>	Dayton, Ohio, is home to one of the country's most ambitious street-closure experiments. Like many aging urban communities, Five Oaks, an integrated, lower-middle-class neighborhood in Dayton, found itself in decline. Homeowners were leaving, rental properties were poorly maintained, and drug dealers and prostitutes had set up shop. Located near the freeway, Five Oaks was an ideal location for crack houses. Experts predicted that within two years much of the neighborhood would be a disaster area.
<p>	In 1992, desperate neighborhood leaders turned to street closures. The city called in Oscar Newman to assist. A year later, 34 streets and 26 alleys were closed off in Five Oaks. Neighborhood residents divided Five Oaks into ten mini-neighborhoods to enable law-abiding residents to confront the problems in their immediate area.
<p>	Only a year after the streets were closed, substantial improvement was visible. Cut-through traffic, previously a big problem in the neighborhood, fell by two-thirds. Automobile accidents and traffic speed levels also declined dramatically. After dropping the previous two years, housing sales surged 55 percent, while the average purchase price of a home increased 15 percent. Violent crime was cut in half; overall crime plunged by 26 percent. Most importantly, Five Oaks residents felt much safer and in control of their immediate surroundings. "I have four little kids," said one neighborhood homeowner. "My kids can now play out in the yard. It's been a blessing for my family."
<p>
<b>Reclaiming Public Parks</b> 
<p>	Another problem of "space" in many cities (and some suburbs too) are local parks. Instead of serving as a place for kids to play and families to picnic, many parks have become gathering places for gangs and drug dealers. Instead of serving as a common area that knits the community together, many neighborhood parks are tearing communities apart. 
<p>	City officials refer to such parks as "orphan" parks because there is no real or perceived "ownership" of the park, and so no one takes care of it. City hall cannot possibly provide the same level of attention as the people who use the park every day. Local involvement is needed to make small parks a positive force in the neighborhood; only neighborhood residents, the people who use the park, can provide this. 
<p>	The inspiring story of San Antonio's Lee's Creek Park proves the point. "It's not every 41-year old that can leave a legacy for his children," says San Antonian Bill Lucas as he looks over the plans for Lee's Creek Park, a project that engrossed him for over a year. Lucas does not work for the city planning or recreation department -- he is a sales manager for Bekins Moving Systems. <p>
	Donated by the Lee family to the city, the park is located in a declining area of the city with swelling gang problems. After 10 years, it was still little more than a vacant lot. Then along came Bill Lucas and the local chapter of Optimist Club International, the 75-year-old "friends of youth" organization. In conjunction with around 35 neighborhood families, the Optimist Club transformed the weed-infested vacant lot into a thriving community parkwithout the aid of taxpayer money. Creating Lee's Creek Park was a true volunteer effort. A bridge over the creek was a gift from an Optimist Club member in memory of his wife. A running track was donated by a construction company. The sweat to clear the lot and plant the trees was contributed by neighborhood residents and even some nonresidents, including Mrs. Lee herself. "All we are doing is recreating in a small way neighborhood involvement like it was in the 1800s in America when people used to pitch in and help build their neighbors' houses and barns," says Lucas.<p>
	When the park was finished it was turned back over to the city, which agreed to maintain it. Lucas is confident the park will not fall victim to "orphan park" syndrome. "Our idea is for the neighbors to create ownership opportunities for themselves," he said. To do so, ownership committees were created and vested with control of certain blocked out sections of the park that they are responsible for beautifying and maintaining. The sense of ownership is critical. "If the park were given to us we wouldn't respect it," says Lucas. "We can see it in our own children. Make them earn it, and they own it." 
<p>	Turning over partial ownership or management of city parks to nonprofit groups and neighborhood associations is often the best way to ensure they remain a public asset. New York City's Neighborhood Open Space Coalition has assumed control of hundreds of abandoned lots and parks in this way, turning many dangerous eyesores into gardens. Nearly one-fourth of the city's nearly 1,500 public parks are now cared for by community associations under the Operation Green Thumb program.
<p>	Private groups usually have more success ensuring the park is in constant use, which is the key to keeping a park safe. The nonprofit Central Park Conservancy has raised more than $100 million for New York City's Central Park since its founding in 1980. It has taken over the care of trees, lawns, and plants and provides more than half of the park's operating costs. By 1989, 72 percent of Central Park users said the park felt safer after the conservancy got involved. Crime dropped 59 percent and robberies plummeted 73 percent. The drop in crime is attributed to the large increase in park activities put on by the conservancy. Good uses drove out the bad uses.
<p>
<b>Crisis Point</b> 
<p>	What is the future of public safety in America? One possibility is that we will continue to ask police to attempt the impossible: To create safe communities without the communities' help. Under this scenario, there will be more cops, more prisons -- and more crime.
<p>	The other possibility is more appealing. We can learn from America's most innovative public-safety models -- San Diego's problem-oriented, neighborhood policing; New York's subway-disorder reduction; Milwaukee's landlord empowerment policies; and Dayton's Five Oaks street closures -- to develop a new vision of policing America's neighborhoods and downtowns where police departments are closer to the communities they serve and citizens and communities take a more active role in protecting their safety. 
<p>	Under this scenario, America could see a future with fewer police and more security. We are fast approaching a crisis point in our country as crime and fear of crime paralyze our nation. How we respond will go a long way in determining what we become as a nation.

<a name="sandiego"></a><b>San Diego's Trailblazing Example (sidebar)</b>

<p>	Community policing demands that both police and citizens accept responsibilities. The community's contribution can take many forms, from setting up community watches and getting landlords to screen potential renters to cleaning up vacant lots, reporting suspicious behavior, and making sure teenagers don't roam the streets. If citizens don't take responsibility for the safety of their own community, the police can do little to help. 
<p>	San Diego's bold effort to involve citizens in public safety is unheard of among big cities. One San Diego official related this story: "I told a group of our officers that we were planning to have civilian volunteers take crime reports and collect evidence in cases of petty thefts. About three-quarters of them were nodding their heads, saying, 'Yeah, that makes sense.' If I tried that in New York or Chicago, they'd laugh me out of the room."
<p>	At San Diego's Eastern Division police headquarters, a group gathers around a conference table regularly to discuss better ways to patrol a certain neighborhood. But these blue-shirted peacekeepers aren't police officers. They are gray-haired volunteers of the Retired Senior Volunteer Patrol (RSVP), a major component of San Diego's commitment to neighborhood policing. 
<p>	"The partnership between the community and our department really works," says police captain Dan Berglund. In addition to 272 sworn officers, Berglund's division relies on 115 senior volunteers, 20 reserves, and 40 other resident volunteers. "Their influence in their own community has been extremely beneficial," says Berglund. 
<p>	Neighborhood policing requires a fundamental change in the department's operating philosophy. The police shift their attention from rapid response to putting more officers out on regular beats, where they can help the community solve public-safety problems. Neighborhood policing also entails much greater use of volunteers and soliciting the concerns of the citizens. In the language of Tom Peters, neighborhood policing means "getting close to the customer." 
<p>	San Diego uses volunteers in a wide range of nonconfrontational situations, such as towing cars, collecting evidence (including fingerprinting), and checking on the homes of absent neighbors. Instead of assigning a uniformed officer to spend, say, 45 minutes writing a report for a petty theft, San Diego uses volunteers trained at the police academy. This frees up officers for problems that require their special skills. "So long as volunteers are given meaningful work, and welcomed as a partner in the process, I will have an unlimited number of people in any community in this city to do that," Berglund said. 
<p>	The SDPD is unusual in its openness to citizen input and volunteer assistance. Admittedly, San Diego is blessed with many retirees. Although it's the sixth-largest city in America, San Diego's police force has a small-town feel. In most big cities, powerful police unions would oppose the use of community volunteers for police work. But San Diego welcomes them. 
<p>	This tolerant culture, which took years to develop, is due partly to Police Chief Jerry Sanders's deep commitment to community policing. San Diego is the first large city to adopt a department-wide approach to community policing. Nearly every SDPD police officer belongs to a team assigned to a discrete geographical area and charged with developing a close relationship with that neighborhood. "We are using persuasion rather than coercion to get people on board," says Nancy McPherson, who served as San Diego's neighborhood-policing coordinator before moving on to the Seattle police department.
<P>	Police departments customarily resist community policing because cops fear they will become social workers rather than crimefighters. The department dispelled that idea early on. After getting to know the residents on their beat, two San Diego cops trained in neighborhood problem-solving learned that a gang had taken over a particular section of an apartment complex. Through close relations with the building's law-abiding residents, they gathered the evidence needed to obtain search warrants. The bust that followed -- complete with SWAT teams and swarms of patrol cars -- put an end to the worry that neighborhood policing was soft on crime.

<p>

<a name="subway"></a><b>New York City's Subway (sidebar)</b><p>

	For years litter, graffiti, vagrants, and panhandlers had been turning New York City's subway into a vaguely sinister netherworld. The transit agency's first reaction to this problem was standard public-sector misjudgment: Add more "inputs." Additional police officers were assigned to patrol the transit system. The results were unimpressive, and riders remained frightened.
<p>	In the mid-1980s, David Gunn, the new transit authority president, decided to wage a war on the graffiti that covered nearly every square foot of every city subway car. Vast amounts of time and money had already been invested in increasing patrols and surveillance to reduce graffiti -- to no avail. Regardless of how many "taggers" were caught, there were always more. The overburdened courts never gave taggers more than stern lectures.<p>
	A deeper analysis of the graffiti problem revealed that taggers got a thrill from viewing their markings on future trips. Denied the satisfaction of beholding their "art," Gunn figured, many taggers would simply stop. He made the removal of graffiti from subway cars a top priority. The strategy worked. On May 12, 1989, five years after the launch of the Clean Car Program, the last of the graffiti-covered cars was removed from service. The Big Apple's notorious subway cars were among the cleanest in the world.<p>
	But removing the graffiti only solved part of the problem. New Yorkers still feared the disorderly people who always seemed to be hanging around the subway.
<p>	In 1990, the city hired William Bratton (now the city's police commissioner) as the new chief of transit police. "We understood early on that the problems of crime, disorder, and fare evasion were deeply interrelated," Bratton says, "and that therefore we would have to form a coherent strategy to deal with them." Bratton discovered that fare-jumpers not only cost the transit system more than $120 million a year in income, but also committed much of the crime and unruly behavior in the subway. He organized plainclothes "sweep teams" of four to six officers to catch fare-evaders. Says Bratton, "The sweeps produced some interesting results. One of every six fare-evaders we stopped either was carrying a weapon or was wanted for another crime on an outstanding warrant. That was an incredibly high statistic, and it made us realize that by fighting fare evasion, we were also making an impact on crime."
<p>	At the same time, Bratton set out to reduce the intimidating behavior of panhandlers and homeless people in the subways. Monthly ejections from the subway went from 2,000 to 16,000. In Bratton's first two years, the number of felonies in the subway fell 30 percent.

"The flat tax has some serious hurdles to overcome<br> 
before it can go from tax concept to tax code."</i><br>
-- J.D. Foster<br>
</center>
<hr>
<p>
<br>
The flat tax is the vanguard of tax reform, and for good reason. It is  
sound economically and easy to explain. It corrects some long-standing  
problems with the current tax system: complexity, high costs of  
administration and compliance, a depressing effect on the economy, and  
the unfairness of double taxation of income from capital. Its strengths  
have gained the flat tax many ardent fans and have brought it from an  
obscure oddity debated by economists to the forefront of the tax-policy  
debate.   
<p> 	  
Flat-tax advocates are nearly evangelistic in their drive to replace the  
current tax system, often as an integral part of their broader agenda to  
reshape government. They are also often unwilling to acknowledge that,  
despite its strengths, the flat tax also has some weaknesses and some  
serious obstacles to overcome before it can go from tax concept to tax  
code.   
<p>
<center>
<b><a name="Flat Tax">WHAT IS A FLAT TAX?</a></b><br>

<a href="#Contents">Contents</a><br></center>
<p>
Any tax with a single tax rate could be considered a flat tax. A flat tax on  
labor and business income has been popularized by professors Robert E.  
Hall and Alvin Rabushka of the Hoover Institution. A flat tax on labor  
and business income is also embodied in legislative proposals advanced  
by Congressman Dick Armey, the majority leader in the House of  
Representatives, and Senator Arlen Specter, a presidential contender.  
These flat-tax proposals do not tax income from saving; they are  
therefore a form of consumption tax.  
<p> 	  
One of the great advantages of a flat tax is its neutrality. It taxes all forms  
of income only once and does so at a single rate. It taxes individuals'  
labor income at a single rate after allowing for personal exemptions, and  
it taxes business's net cash flow at the same rate that applies to  
individuals. The flat tax thus gives no relative advantage to any means of  
earning income. It favors neither capital nor labor, neither physical nor  
intellectual capital, neither manufacturing nor real estate. By contrast,  
under current law, the federal government uses the tax code to  
micromanage the economy, distorting the allocation of resources such as   
capital and labor, and thereby diminishing both the level of economic  
activity and the standard of living.  
<p>	  
The flat tax is also vastly simpler than the current system and thus  
virtually transparent to taxpayers -- that is, taxpayers need not become  
lawyers or CPAs to understand the intent and application of the tax  
system. Such transparency is important for individuals and businesses   
making economic decisions, for taxpayers' confidence in the fairness of  
the system, and for assuring taxpayers that the tax code will not become a  
tool of deliberate or accidental oppression by government. Much of the  
distrust bred by the federal tax system derives from a suspicion that it  
conceals traps to snare the unwary taxpayer and torture him with tax  
penalties, interest charges, tax liens, and possibly jail. The flat tax aims to  
be so simple and transparent that taxpayers could shelve their fear of the  
tax man.  
<p>	  
<b>Individuals under a flat tax.</b> Taxable income under a flat tax includes all  
wages and salary, and excludes all capital income such as dividends,  
interest, rental income, and capital gains. In addition, all nonwage forms  
of labor compensation are also excluded, such as employer-provided  
health insurance and subsidized parking. The tax on individuals,  
therefore, is essentially a payroll tax collected at the employee level.  
Most flat-tax proposals also allow the taxpayer to take personal  
exemptions and an additional exemption for each child in the household,  
effectively creating a zero tax rate for low-income filers. Under the   
Armey version of the flat tax, for example, a single filer is allowed a  
$13,100 exemption ($26,200 for married, filing jointly), and the plan  
allows for a $5,300 exemption per dependent. Having calculated taxable  
income net of the personal and child exemptions, a flat tax imposes a  
single tax rate on any remaining taxable income.  
<p>	  
The most striking feature of a flat tax is that it eliminates the special  
deductions, phase-outs, and credits in the federal income tax, ensuring  
that most individuals could calculate their tax liability easily -- hence the  
claims by flat-tax advocates that a tax return could be filed on a postcard.   
(In his plan, Specter retains the two most popular individual deductions,  
the home-mortgage interest and charitable deductions.)  
<p>	  
Simplicity for the individual is indeed one of the flat tax's best selling  
points. It is a point that is often oversold, however. Under the flat tax,  
there are two tax rates -- zero and approximately 20 percent. No doubt a  
reduction in the number of tax rates would make tax planning easier, but  
for most individuals the number of rates is irrelevant to their   
actual tax filing.  
<p>  
The simplification of the calculation of taxable income may also be  
oversold. For the approximately 80 million tax filers who take the  
standard deduction, the difference in tax computation between the flat tax  
and current law is that taxpayers today must add their interest, dividends,   
and capital gains to the tax base. They do not suffer the complexities of  
tax deductions because they opt for the standard deduction. For the  
approximately 32 million itemizers, the flat tax offers a clearly simpler  
system. But taxpayers who itemize do so voluntarily. They itemize   
because it lowers their tax liability. Thus, for itemizing taxpayers, the flat  
tax represents a loss of a preferred option in the way they file their taxes.  
Flat-tax advocates assume that most itemizing taxpayers would happily  
give up their credits and deductions in exchange for a simpler tax system.  
<p>	  
<b>Businesses under a flat tax.</b> The taxation of businesses under a flat tax  
makes even greater strides towards simplicity and neutrality. All  
businesses are treated the same; no distinction is made between  
partnerships, sole proprietorships, corporations, and any other business  
form. There is a single tax rate. And businesses are taxed on their net  
cash flow, not on their net income as under current law, thereby  
eliminating all the complications of attempting to match the timing of  
income and expenses.   
<p>	  
Under a flat tax, a business calculates its net cash flow for the year by  
totaling its receipts from all sources and subtracting all payments made  
to its employees and all payments made to other businesses for such  
things as plant and equipment and inventory. Businesses would deduct  
from income the full cost of their investments at the time of purchase,  
instead of stretching out these expenses according to complicated  
depreciation schedules. Employee fringe benefits would not be  
deductible. Nor would interest payments. The business then calculates its  
tax liability by applying a single tax rate to its net cash flow.  
<p>	  
<b>More than just a tax system.</b> In the current political environment, the flat  
tax is far more than an alternative tax system. The flat tax is also a strong  
political and philosophical statement about the role of tax policy in   
society, as seen most clearly in the strong preference of flat-tax advocates  
for a single tax rate for all taxpayers.   
<p>	  
For decades, the prevailing doctrine of "tax fairness" has dictated a highly  
progressive income-tax system. This means that, as a family's income  
rises, so do its average and marginal tax rates. Under current law,  
progressivity is achieved through a combination of deductions,  
exclusions, phase-outs, and rising tax rates imposed on a comprehensive  
measure of income. For example, in 1994 a married couple with $50,000  
in Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) and two children, taking the standard  
deduction, would pay 10.1 percent in federal income tax, whereas the  
same family with $100,000 in AGI would pay tax at an 18.5 percent rate.  
<p>	  
Under a flat 20 percent tax rate, a family would be subject to a 20 percent  
rate however high its labor income above a certain threshold. Having  
exempted lower-income taxpayers from the tax, many flat-tax advocates  
believe that proportionality, not progressivity, reflects the prevailing   
sense of fairness in America: Taxpayers should pay more tax as their  
incomes rise, but the amount of tax should not increase more than  
proportionally.  
<p>	  
Flat-tax proposals actually include two tax rates -- zero (by virtue of the  
personal exemptions) and about 20 percent. Some critics worry that the  
inclusion of a zero tax rate in the flat tax will maintain a large  
constituency for expanded government. The dangers are apparent in any   
general system of taxation that allows any but the poorest of the poor to  
escape paying at least some tax when they have taxable income. Taxes  
reflect a price we pay for government. Whenever someone escapes  
paying tax to finance government services, the direct cost of those  
services is zero and the amount of services demanded is high. Even a   
minimal tax of a few dollars a month would remind taxpayers                                                                   
that government services are not free.  
<p>	  
Many advocates of the flat tax are using the tax reform debate as a means  
of reshaping the political debate. By directly challenging the doctrine of  
tax progressivity in the federal tax system, they seek to change not only   
established ideas about desired tax burdens, but also the very notion of  
using the state as an instrument of incomes policy. Nor does the challenge  
stop there.   
<p>	  
Armey has included as part of his proposal the elimination of income-tax  
withholding. To many, withholding is simply a convenience whereby  
their employers subtract a certain amount from their paychecks each pay  
period based on an estimate of the total tax due for the year. To Armey  
and others, however, tax withholding disguises the true magnitude of the  
taxpayer's federal individual income-tax liability. By clouding the amount  
paid, they argue, taxpayers object less to the tax burden and to the  
amount of government spending that tax receipts make possible. By  
replacing the withholding mechanism with a monthly payment directly  
from the taxpayer to the Treasury, Armey believes he will bring powerful  
new forces to bear on the size of the tax burden and the size of  
government.

<b><a name="Economic Benefits">ECONOMIC BENEFITS</a></b><br> 

<a href="#Contents">Contents</a><br></center>
<p>
Tax reform is a long and difficult process. Even the adoption of an ideal  
tax system creates transition costs for taxpayers, economic dislocation,  
and uncertainty. What benefits would justify these costs?  
<p>	  
<b>Saving, investment, and economic growth.</b> The net national savings rate  
in the U.S. has averaged 2.7 percent per year in the 1990s, less than one  
third the rate of the 1950s and 1960s. The savings rate is a prime  
determinant of the growth of incomes and wealth, so a low savings rate  
obviously does not bode well for future growth in standards of living.   
Certainly one contributing factor to the low savings rate is the high tax  
rate on saving and investment, due in part to the double taxation of  
income from capital. The flat tax would tax income from capital only  
once -- in the form of a tax on business income. Dividends, capital gains,  
interest payments, and other forms of capital income received by  
individuals would not be taxed, because they had already been taxed  
before. The flat tax would thereby reduce the tax burden on saving,  
which means, everything else held constant, that a flat tax would increase  
the rate of private saving.  
<p>	  
The flat tax may also reduce the tax burden on investment by eliminating  
the double taxation of corporate income and allowing businesses to  
deduct in full the cost of their plant and equipment purchases. However,  
the flat tax also appears to increase the overall tax burden of businesses   
(more on this later) so the net effect on investment incentives   
may be muted.   
<p>	  
The purpose of  encouraging saving and investment is, of course, to  
promote faster non-inflationary economic growth, boost real wages, and  
raise the nation's standard of living. At a recent conference sponsored by  
the Hoover Institution, Dale W. Jorgenson of Harvard presented a paper,   
"The Economic Impact of Fundamental Tax Reform," showing that the  
adoption of a consumption tax such as the flat tax would increase the  
discounted value of Americans' future income by about $1.3 trillion.  
<p>	  
Such increases certainly justify considering a change in tax systems.  
Projecting increases in economic activity is risky business, however,  
since the projections always depend on the underlying assumptions. At  
the same conference, Laurence J. Kotlikoff of Boston University  
presented results based on a different type of economic model indicating  
that a switch to a consumption tax would eventually increase real wages  
by 7 percent and GDP per capita by 8 percent. These two studies are  
impressive and, because they are based on different types of models,  
credibly imply that the economy would perform significantly better under  
a flat tax or another consumption tax than it would under the current  
income tax.	  
<p> 
It is important to recognize that accelerated economic growth also means  
accelerated tax collections for federal, state, and local governments.  
While congressional and Treasury Department analysts persist in  
ignoring these additional revenues, policymakers should understand that   
additional economic growth will mean additional tax revenue. Using  
Jorgenson's estimates of economic growth, in present-value terms a flat  
tax could eventually raise well over $200 billion in additional federal  
revenues and $150 billion in additional state and local revenues.  
<p>	  
<b>Compliance and administrative-cost savings.</b> According to an analysis by  
the Tax Foundation, the annual compliance costs associated with the  
federal personal and corporate income taxes are roughly $200 billion.  
These costs result from recordkeeping, tax filing, litigation and appeals,   
and so forth. In addition, the federal government spends almost $14  
billion administering the system, for a total annual cost of well over $800  
per person.   
<p>	  
Most compliance costs are borne by the business sector, and most of  
these costs can be attributed to those areas of the tax code dealing with  
the timing of income and expense, and with the taxation of foreign- 
source income. The flat tax is a tax on cash flow, and so at a stroke it  
eliminates the issue of timing. It also exempts from U.S. tax the foreign-  
source income of U.S. citizens, so it eliminates this compliance cost as  
well. And, at the individual level, most compliance costs arise in relation  
to capital income, which would no longer be taxed, so these costs, too,  
disappear. While every tax system imposes some administrative and   
compliance costs, there is good reason to believe the flat tax eventually  
would dramatically reduce this burden on the taxpayer and on the  
economy.  
<p>	  
<b>Thoughts of lower interest rates.</b> Proponents of the flat tax (and of many  
other tax reform proposals) often suggest that lower (nominal, after-tax)  
interest rates would ensue. If a flat tax raises saving levels as promised,  
the amount of capital available for domestic and foreign investment  
would increase and, if everything else were held constant, this could  
reduce interest rates under certain circumstances. Everything else is not  
held equal, however. 
<p>
The flat tax may also improve investment  
opportunities by reducing the marginal tax burden on capital income.  
Recall that the double taxation of corporate income would cease and   
that businesses could, for example, expense their capital purchases. Thus,  
the domestic demand for new investment in plant and equipment may  
also increase. At this point, we cannot say whether saving would increase  
more or less rapidly than investment. 
<p>
However, as the modern mantra  
runs, we live in a global economy, and no markets are more completely  
integrated than the capital markets. This means that, to the extent   
domestic saving exceeds the demands of the economy for capital, the  
excess saving finds its way overseas in search of more profitable  
investments. And, when domestic saving is insufficient to meet domestic  
investment demands, we import capital from abroad. Thus, whether  
domestic saving increases more rapidly than investment following a flat  
tax, or vice versa, no significant effect on after-tax interest rates should   
be anticipated on this score. 
<p>
Pre-tax interest rates are nevertheless sure to  
decline following a flat tax. Interest rates reflect many factors, including  
expected inflation, a real, after-tax required rate of  return, a degree of  
uncertainty and, possibly, a degree of credit-market tightness. Interest  
rates also reflect the taxes the interest income recipient must pay, which  
explains, for example, why there is a significant difference in the interest   
rates paid to taxable and tax-exempt bond holders. Under a flat tax,  
interest income is tax-exempt, so pre-tax interest rates would fall to about  
what are currently the rates paid on tax-exempt bonds. 
<p>
On the flip side,  
interest expense is not deductible under a flat tax, so there would be no  
net reduction in after-tax interest costs to borrowers and hence little or no  
stimulation of growth from lower interest rates.  
<p>

<b><a name="Middle-Class">PROBLEM #1: A MIDDLE-CLASS TAX BURDEN</a></b><br>  

<a href="#Contents">Contents</a><br></center>
<p>	  
At the tax rates currently discussed, the flat tax appears to impose a  
higher share of the total federal tax burden on middle-class taxpayers and  
appears to raise their taxes in dollar terms as well. Each of these  
represents an enormous political problem for flat-tax advocates.  
<p>	  
A progressive rate structure means that upper-income taxpayers pay a  
higher proportion of their labor income in taxes than do all other  
taxpayers. A revenue-neutral flat tax would shift some of the tax burden  
on labor income from upper-income taxpayers onto the middle class. This  
shift of tax burden to the middle class is exacerbated by the exclusion   
of capital income from the tax base, which on a per-capita basis is a  
larger fraction of a typical upper-income individual's taxable income than  
that of a middle-income individual. Finally, large personal exemptions  
would remove millions of lower-income individuals from the tax rolls.   
Consequently, the middle class would be forced to bear a greater share  
yet of the total tax burden.  
<p>	  
Flat-tax advocates take the fairness issue head on by advocating only one  
(or two) tax rates. Where the flat tax really attempts to redefine tax  
fairness, however, is in the exclusion of capital income from the tax base.  
Justice and tax neutrality are both served by excluding capital income  
since the capital has already been subject to tax at least once, if not   
many times over. Nevertheless, a clear problem of perceptions must be  
admitted.  
<p>	  
Consider two families. The Joneses have a combined salary of $50,000 in  
wages and salary. Under the Armey plan with a 20 percent tax rate, this  
family of four would owe $3,700 in tax. Now consider the Smiths, who  
in retirement consume every dollar of their $1 million in dividend  
income. Under the flat tax, the Smiths owe no tax at all because capital  
income is excluded from the tax base. This is appropriate, because their  
dividend income was taxed at least once before the Smith family received  
it. But the perception would persist that a wealthy family is paying no tax.  
<p>	  
When capital income, which would not be subject to personal income tax,  
is considered along with wage

<Font Size="2"><b>Less progressive.</b>  One potential criticism of the flat tax is that high-income groups appear to pay a lower percentage of their personal income in taxes than middle-income groups.  This occurs because higher-income groups receive a greater share of their earnings from capital income, which is exempt under the flat tax.  <b>Source:</b>  The Tax Foundation.<br>

<p>
income, average tax rates for higher- 
income groups are lower than for middle-income groups under the  
individual side of the flat tax (see chart below). And so this may be the  
Achilles' heel of a flat tax: Are the majority of the American people  
willing to define tax fairness entirely in terms of labor income? Can tax  
fairness be defined in such a way that individuals who consume 
significant  
amounts of capital income would be allowed to pay little or no tax? If so,  
then the flat tax has overcome its biggest hurdle. If not, then a flat tax  
solely on labor income probably cannot succeed.   
<p>	  
Flat-tax advocates can overcome this hurdle through careful analysis. As  
we shall soon see, a flat tax will shift the incidence of taxation sharply  
from individuals to business. While individuals will pay no tax on their  
own capital income, the businesses from which they earn capital income   
will pay higher taxes. The crucial point is this: The burden of business  
taxes is ultimately borne not by the entities that pay them but, one way or  
another, by workers (in the form of lower compensation) or by business  
owners (in the form of lower profits), who tend to belong to the higher- 
income group.  
<p>	  
The chart on page 29 shows the average tax paid at different income  
levels under a flat tax when business taxes are imputed to individuals.  
Following procedures adopted by the Congressional Budget Office, the  
Tax Foundation assumes that half of the business tax is ultimately paid by   
business owners and half is paid through reduced labor compensation.  
The imputation of the business tax shows a disproportionate share of the  
business-tax burden falling on upper-income taxpayers.  
<p>	  
The chart shows the distribution of the tax burden when we account for  
both the individual and business taxes under current law, under the  
Armey proposal with a 20 percent rate (which Armey argues reduces  
revenues by $40 billion annually relative to current law), and under a  
revenue-neutral version of the Armey proposal which the Tax   
Foundation calculates would require a 21.1 percent rate. (The lower rate  
claimed by Armey probably arises because his plan, by design, loses  
revenue relative to current law.) As the chart shows, when income is  
measured comprehensively and both labor and business income are taxed,  
the flat tax imposes a remarkably proportional tax burden (once  
individuals earn enough to pay tax).   
<p>	  
Analysis of the likely distribution of the tax burden also reveals some  
disturbing news for flat-tax advocates, however: At the proposed rates,  
the flat tax would impose a tax increase on middle-income taxpayers.  
This obviously creates an enormous political problem for flat-tax  
proponents. Many middle-income voters may object to a significant tax   
increase in exchange for a simpler tax system and the   
promise of a stronger economy. One solution is, of course, to   
cut spending to reduce the tax rate below 17 percent. This is   
Armey's solution. As noted below, however, this is far easier   
said than done.   
<p>
<center> 
<b><a name="Business End">PROBLEM #2:  THE BUSINESS END</a></b><br>

<a href="#Contents">Contents</a><br></center>
<p>	 
Successful tax reform must always originate in the barber shops and  
bingo parlors outside the Washington Beltway. Without sustained popular  
support, the enormous effort of fundamental reform will fall short. A new  
tax principle, having gained the necessary popular support, must then  
gain the support, or at least the acquiescence, of the bulk of the business  
community. Tax reform that fails employers will fail their employees as  
well.   
<p>	 
The simplicity of the flat tax would eventually benefit the business sector  
by reducing both compliance costs and the uncertainty that a complex tax  
code imposes on business decisions. On the other hand, the business  
sector, at least under the Armey flat tax, appears to bear a much higher  
share of the total federal tax burden. Currently, the business sector bears  
about 31 percent of the burden. Under the Armey flat tax, according to  
Tax Foundation analysis, the business sector would bear about 50 percent  
of the burden, an increase of about two thirds. In other words, under the  
Armey plan about 19 percent of the total tax collection is shifted from  
individuals to businesses. The higher burden on businesses is due to  such  
things as the loss of the deductions for state and local taxes and for  
employee fringe benefits. (Some of this burden would eventually be  
shifted back to individuals, as companies convert fringe benefits into  
labor income on which individuals would have to pay taxes.)  
<p> 	 
It is, of course, true that businesses only collect taxes; individuals  
ultimately bear the tax burden. Nevertheless, business leaders are very  
aware of their average tax rate and the after-tax earnings they report to  
their owners. The business community in the aggregate suffered a hefty  
tax increase as part of the 1986 Tax Reform Act, though much smaller  
than that apparent in the Armey flat tax. Many of today's CEOs and chief  
financial officers were tax directors and tax vice-presidents in 1986, and  
they remember how a laudatory tax principle eventually boomeranged to  
their firms' detriment. Business owners are likely to resist any tax  
proposal that would raise their effective tax rates, even if it promised to  
accelerate economic growth.   
<p>	 
At the very least, successful tax reform should probably avoid increasing  
the net tax burden on America's businesses. Even so, such reform would  
still create lists of winners, losers, and uncertains. Traditionally, the  
uncertains oppose tax reform while projected losers fight harder against   
their losses than winners will fight for their gains, so even a revenue- 
neutral tax reform between individuals and businesses is likely to create  
important opposition to a flat tax.  
<p>
<center>
<b><a name="Other Obstacles">OTHER OBSTACLES</a></b><br>

<a href="#Contents">Contents</a><br></center>
<p>	 
Aside from the basic tax-burden questions, there is a long list of obstacles  
for the flat tax to overcome:  
<p>	 
<b>Charitable contributions.</b> Under the current income tax, itemizing  
taxpayers can deduct amounts contributed to charitable organizations  
(churches, certain civic groups, educational institutions, research  
organizations, etc.) in calculating their taxable income. The charitable  
deduction is defended by politically powerful organizations from Harvard   
University and the Boy Scouts to the Catholic Church and the American  
Association of Retired Persons. For itemizers, contributions to these  
groups under current law are made in pre-tax dollars. Under a flat tax, the  
tax incentive to make a contribution is eliminated, so all such  
contributions must be made in after-tax dollars. Some decline in  
charitable giving should be expected for virtually all charities, at least  
initially, following the enactment of the tax. Over the long run, of   
course, the higher incomes and capital accumulation produced by a flat  
tax will lead to increases in giving that will offset the initial decline. Even  
so, charitable groups, recognizing the immediate threat to their funding,  
will surely lobby to keep the charitable deduction in the tax base.   
<p>	 
<b>Tax receipts under the Armey plan.</b> Flat-tax advocates also often strongly  
favor a smaller federal government, and the arguments in favor of one  
occasionally intermingle with arguments in favor of the other. However,  
a flat tax implies little or nothing about the desired level of government   
spending or taxation. It is a revenue system capable of raising a wide  
range of tax revenue levels depending on the tax rate chosen. Without  
question, a flat tax would be easier to enact and implement if the federal  
government
<p>

<hr width="50%">
<Font Size="2"><b>More proportional.</b>  When income is defined comprehensively to include business income, taxes on higher-income groups remain remarkably proportional.  That's because the flat tax appears to shift some of the overall tax burden to businesses, whose taxes are borne disproportionately by (higher-income) business owners.  <b>Source:</b>  The Tax Foundation.<br>

<p>
needed less revenue. General tax cuts would help avoid the  
contest of winners and losers that typically impede tax reforms. Also,   
all tax reforms impose adjustment costs on the economy as resources are  
re-allocated and re-priced. These costs would be easier to bear in the  
context of reduced overall tax burdens.   
<p>	 
The initial tax rate under the Armey flat tax is set at 20 percent, which  
Armey argues would reduce federal collections by about $40 billion  
annually; the tax rate drops two years later to 17 percent. The Armey plan  
argues forcefully for funding these cuts with spending cuts. Over the   
traditional five-year budget window, setting the flat rate at 20 percent  
means cutting spending by about $250 billion. To put it in perspective,  
the budget passed by the House Budget Committee in May to eliminate  
the deficit called for spending cuts of $459 billion over five years.   
<p>	 
The spending cuts needed to fund the Armey flat tax would be in addition  
to those in the Fiscal Year 1996 Budget Resolution. For advocates of a  
dramatically smaller government, a call for additional spending cuts to  
fund flat-tax reform is more of an opportunity than a problem. But,   
given the difficulties of achieving the cuts in the budget resolution, it is  
fair to question whether additional cuts of this size are possible. At this  
stage, the possible responses of the flat-tax advocates would seem to be  
either that the revenue scoring must include revenue gains from projected   
accelerated economic growth or that the extra spending cuts are possible  
and desirable.  
<p>	 
<b>The flat tax and the health care debate.</b> Under a flat tax, the employer  
would no longer be allowed to deduct the cost of employee health- 
insurance coverage. This arrangement eliminates a serious distortion in  
the current system -- the tax advantage of employer-provided health   
insurance. Denying employers the ability to deduct the cost of health  
insurance will discourage them from continuing to provide insurance as a  
benefit. Instead, they are likely to raise wage and salary income, and  
families would have to buy their own insurance. Eventually, such a  
family-based system should work as well for health insurance as it does  
for any other form of insurance.  
<p>	 
At the outset, the flat tax could expose individuals to much higher  
insurance premiums if they no longer receive the benefit of group rates.  
This is a serious transition issue for the flat tax for which no good  
solution seems available. One could, for example, require employers to  
continue to offer insurance for a specified period following tax reform.   
Another solution would be to require insurers to continue coverage  
indefinitely for previously covered employees, and set insurance  
premiums at the levels applicable to the employee's previous group.   
<p> 
<b>Double taxation and state and local taxes.</b> Alongside tax neutrality,  
avoiding double taxation between tax jurisdictions is a fundamental goal  
of good tax policy. Double taxation occurs when an individual pays tax to  
one entity and must pay tax to another jurisdiction on the tax paid to the  
first. For example, when a taxpayer pays $100 in state tax ad the federal  
government includes that $100 in the taxpayer's income for federal  
income-tax purposes, then the individual is effectively paying tax on  
taxes received by the state. This is unfair to the taxpayer.  
<p>	 
With the exception of sales taxes, state and local taxes are currently  
deductible for itemizers at the individual level and for all corporate  
taxpayers, thereby avoiding double taxation. This deduction is typically  
eliminated under a flat tax, thereby assuring double taxation and bringing  
new pressures on state and local government finances. A flat tax would  
disproportionately raise the costs of living and doing business in high-tax  
states and localities. Recognizing the threat, state and local government  
officials would strenuously oppose this change in policy. On the other  
hand, many advocates of smaller government would applaud the  
additional fiscal pressures on government under a flat tax, even at the  
price of a measure of unfairness.   
<p>	 
<b>Transition issues.</b> They say the Devil is in the details, and that is certainly  
true of tax reform. But the Devil is in his Heaven when dealing with  
transition issues. A complicated economy subject to a complex tax  
system produces extraordinary business and contractual arrangements. A   
simpler tax system may eliminate the need for some of these  
complications going forward, but the old arrangements would still be in  
force and must be addressed. The limited space available here precludes a  
discussion of these issues, but they would include the depreciation of  
previously purchased plant and equipment, the taxation of deferred  
foreign-source income, the use of accumulated Alternative Minimum Tax   
Credits, etc.

<b><a name="Possibility Awaits">A GREATER POSSIBILITY AWAITS</a></b><br>

<a href="#Contents">Contents</a><br></center>
<p>	 
Tax reform, and the flat tax in particular, is intended to replace a very  
poor tax system with a simpler tax promising better economic  
performance. Once such a system has been designed, the level of  
collections demanded of it is a matter of choosing the tax rate.  
<p>	 
The federal government, however, collects a wide variety of other taxes,  
including sales taxes on gasoline and other items, payroll taxes, and user  
fees which should also be considered for replacement. For example,  
federal sales taxes are highly distortionary, require separate and costly  
collection mechanisms, and are generally thought to be regressive.   
<p>	 
Once a new tax base has been established, strong arguments should be  
required in favor of keeping any of the other existing components of the  
federal tax system. Failing such arguments, we should give serious  
consideration to replacing these other, inferior tax systems, making up the   
revenue with a higher flat tax rate. A flat-tax rate of between 38 and 40  
percent would likely raise enough revenue to allow the elimination of the  
payroll tax and all other federal taxes.  
<p>	 
The nation faces many serious economic problems, including Social  
Security and Medicare systems racing towards bankruptcy, a costly  
private health-care system, and high regulatory burdens. So tax reform  
has some steep competition for national attention. It is all the more   
impressive, therefore, that the flat tax's advocates have succeeded in  
moving tax reform to the forefront so quickly. Replacing the current tax  
system with something significantly better, whether a flat tax or an  
alternative, will not solve all our economic ills. But the more rapid  
economic growth it promises may make finding the other solutions a   
little easier.

<h3><a name="Addendum">Taking on the Mortgage-Interest Deduction</a></h3>
<hr width="60%">

<a href="#Contents">Contents</a><br></center>
<p>
If the flat tax is to gain the support of the public, its advocates will have to confront defenders of existing 
deductions head on. The most important deduction for most itemizing individuals is the mortgage-interest deduction. Many observers defend this deduction as encouraging home ownership; some argue that it is necessary for tax neutrality. Under the Armey flat tax, the deduction disappears.
<p>
Many groups believe they would be injured by the elimination of the mortgage-interest deduction. They 
argue, for example, that the loss of the deduction would raise the cost of home ownership, reduce the value of existing homes, and generally cripple the home building industry. In combination, the realtors, the home-builders, the mortgage lenders, and the construction-workers unions make a very powerful lobby, particularly when millions of homeowners are added to the mix.
<p>
The concerns of the mortgage-interest deduction lobby are generally misplaced. As noted above in the 
discussion on interest rates, the tax a saver must pay on interest income is recovered by demanding a higher interest rate. Since a flat tax does not tax individual interest income, pretax market interest rates will fall significantly, just as tax-exempt bonds now pay interest more than 2 percentage points below the rate paid to taxable bonds. Mortgage lenders, seeing their cost of funds fall, will be driven by competition to pass these savings along to mortgage borrowers in the form of lower mortgage rates.
<p>
In after-tax terms, the elimination of the home-mortgage deduction will neither raise nor lower the interest
cost of home-mortgage borrowing. Therefore, that reform should have no affect on the demand for homes or on property values.
<p>
The benefit of lower mortgage rates does not extend to current mortgage holders unless they refinance their mortgages. Thus a legitimate problem is the treatment of mortgages underwritten prior to the enactment of a flat tax. Most of these borrowers assumed they would be able to deduct mortgage interest paid, thereby producing a lower after-tax interest rate and a lower tax burden. Since an estimated 27.4 million taxpayers will claim this deduction in 1995 to the tune of about $238 billion, a potentially huge bloc of voters stand ready to join the ranks of flat-tax opponents. While many or most may be able-to refinance, refinancing may be impractical for many current mortgage holders if, for example, they expect to sell the property in the following year or two.
<p>
A fair (and politically sensible) solution to the old mortgages problem might be to allow homeowners to 
deduct the interest on mortgages taken before the flat tax is enacted. While fairness demands 
grandfathering pre-existing mortgages, the consequence would be a slightly more complicated tax system and a short and medium-term erosion of the tax base, which would have to be offset with initially higher tax rates.
<p>
A loss in the battle over the mortgage interest deduction would not derail the essential effort to develop a flatter, simpler, more saver-friendly tax system. It would, however, require a much higher tax rate initially, and it would make it harder to repeal other popular deductions, like that for charitable contributions.

<b>Policy Review</b><br>

<i>Fall 1995, Number 74</I></center>

<p>

	Profit and the environment are supposed to be enemies. Remember that the next time you visit Yellowstone National Park, one of the crown jewels of the national park system and a popular attraction for tourists, backpackers, and amateur botanists, zoologists, and geologists. Yellowstone boasts some of the most breathtaking sights in all of North America. It also boasts an interesting capitalistic pedigree.
<p>	It was the Northern Pacific Railroad, a private corporation, that funded early expeditions to the Yellowstone region and helped establish the Yellowstone National Park in 1872. "Because it provided the main form of transportation to the region," report economists Terry Anderson and Donald Leal, "the railroad could profit from preservation of this scenic wonder and therefore had an incentive to preserve it." Many other Western parks were promoted and protected by private railroad and development companies for the same reason.
<p>	More recently, some private timber companies have found that, by exploring other uses of the forest lands they own, they can increase their profits. In International Paper's commercial forests in Texas, Louisiana, and Arkansas, company biologist Tom Bourland implemented a fee-based recreation program to make money from not harvesting trees. His program charged hunters for access and leased small tracts of land on which families could park their motor homes and enjoy the woods. After three years, International Paper saw its revenues from the program triple, constituting 25 percent of its total profits from the area. Since this valuable use of private land relied on beauty and diverse wildlife rather than ease of harvest, the company had an incentive to preserve habitat for white-tailed deer, wild turkey, fox, squirrel, quail, bald eagles, and red-cockaded woodpeckers.
<p>	Deseret Land and Livestock pursued a similar strategy when its cattle ranch fell on hard times. The firm's managers decided to invest in wildlife habitat, charging hunters for the right to hunt elk and other animals. Herds of elk and mule deer -- now a valuable commodity -- on Deseret land actually grew, and the company thrived. The 1,289-square-mile King Ranch in south Texas now makes 60 percent of its income from business activities other than cattle -- including revenues from hunters and nature lovers.
<p>	Within the corporate social-responsibility movement, there is no more important issue than environmentalism. Often, the call for corporate responsibility and the exhortation to "save the planet" from a host of environmental problems seem virtually to be the same thing. The firms most often honored for their responsibility -- such as the Body Shop, Patagonia, and Ben and Jerry's -- usually exhibit some sort of (highly publicized) commitment to environmental goals. "Corporations, because they are the dominant institution on the planet, must squarely face the social and environmental problems that afflict humankind," states Paul Hawken, a founder of Smith and Hawken catalog company. "How," he asks, "does business face the prospect that creating a profitable, growing company requires an intolerable abuse of the natural world?"
<p>	The notion that profit and ecology must be at loggerheads, and that businesses must place environmental obligations above economic ones, is but one viewpoint among social-responsibility advocates. A different notion, championed most famously by Vice President Al Gore, is that doing business in an "environmentally friendly" way is also to increase the profitability of firms. "We can prosper," he wrote in his book <i>Earth in the Balance</i>, "by leading the environmental revolution and producing for the world marketplace the new products and technologies that foster economic progress without environmental destruction."
<p>	When you think through the complex issue of corporate environmental responsibility, however, neither Hawken's "win-lose" proposition nor Gore's "win-win" proposition ultimately satisfies. Both have merit, but ignore the most important characteristic of environmental ethics: uncertainty. For Hawken, the fact that the world is headed for catastrophe is scarcely debatable. Only if you buy his apocalyptic predictions about overpopulation, global climate change, deforestation, and depletion of natural resources does his recipe for a low-growth, heavily regulated, "sustainable" economy make any sense. 
<p>	In Gore's case, he makes no conceptual distinction between profiting from innovation and profiting from regulation. Throughout much of his book, he argues that governments should make environmental regulations more strict, repeating many of the doomsday scenarios of which Hawken is fond, but then concludes that American firms can make money designing technologies to meet the higher standards. This is no doubt true, but it ignores the firms -- actually shareholders, workers, and consumers -- who clearly lose when regulatory standards change.
<p>	Innovative compliance might reduce the cost of regulation, but it doesn't eliminate it. For example, a state might decide to require that only cars fueled by electric batteries will be sold within its borders. This might well lead to the development of better, cheaper electric cars, as firms struggle to capture as much as they can of the new automobile market, but that's not the only consideration. Under the mandate, consumers would lose access to the products they prefer. Some individuals and businesses would leave the state entirely. The resulting costs and dislocations would far exceed the environmental benefits of lower auto emissions, which are questionable in any event. (The generation of electricity for the cars, for example, would still produce some air or water pollution.)
<p>	Gore, in other words, is essentially arguing that it's worth building a better mousetrap, regardless of how many mice you think may be actually running around in your house. But what if the more pressing problem you face in your home is termite infestation? Then the mousetrap doesn't help you.
<p>	In a different sense, though, Gore is on exactly the right track in charting a course for corporate responsibility on environmental matters. Corporations are not governments. They are not charities. They are unlikely to be successful if they pursue the same sorts of strategies that governments and philanthropic organizations use to protect wildlife habitats and promote clean air and water, such as setting and enforcing standards of health and safety for the public. Corporate America's unique contribution to solving real environmental problems will come from innovation -- finding new ways to produce goods and services, package and deliver them to consumers, and dispose of or recycle the wastes generated by their own production or by consumption.
<p>
<b>Pollution and Profits</b>
<p>	Corporate innovation in the pollution-reduction area is already widespread. The "Pollution Prevention Pays" program begun by Minnesota-based 3M in 1975 has reduced the company's emissions by more than a billion pounds while saving $500 million.
<p>	"At our company, we view a good portion of the environmental problems most talked about today as symptoms of an underlying disease," said 3M chairman Livio D. DeSimone. "That disease is waste -- the wasteful and inefficient utilization of our resources."<p>
	Similarly, Dow Chemical and Westinghouse have implemented waste reduction strategies that have saved millions of dollars since the mid-1980s. One Westinghouse plant in Puerto Rico reduced "dragout" -- the contamination accidentally spread as chemicals flow from one tank to another -- by 75 percent by shaking the tank to remove solids before releasing the chemical on to the next tank. Chevron saved $10 million in waste disposal costs and reduced hazardous waste by 60 percent in the first three years of its "Save Money and Reduce Toxics" (SMART) program.<p>
	Over the past few decades, timber companies have found that "sustainable-yield forestry" -- including preventing fires, spraying for pests, and quickly replanting harvested areas -- produces less waste and higher profits while also preserving habitat for wildlife. In addition, they have reformed their manufacturing processes, for example by using leftovers from lumbering to make paper pulp and to generate steam for paper mills. International Paper saved about $100 million in disposal expenses between 1988 and 1995 by recycling and reusing its manufacturing wastes.
<p>To be successful both at saving money and "saving the planet," however, corporate waste-reduction programs can't be based on rhetoric or ideology or guesswork about what is or isn't environmentally friendly. One of the greatest myths propagated by the corporate social-responsibility movement is that the most environmentally friendly way to produce goods and services is already known, and that all corporate executives need do is embrace the environmental ethic. This is untrue. Often, the consequences of corporate decisions are ambiguous in terms of overall affect on species, health, air, and water quality, and the global environment. In some cases, the very practices advocated by environmental activists harm the environment.
<p>	Consider the historical example of the automobile. Given the attention paid to air pollution and oil spills, one might believe that the environment would be better off if cars had never been invented and mass-produced for widespread use. But such a judgment would be hasty. Although cars created a new source of air pollution, they also virtually eliminated one of the oldest sources of air and water pollution known to man: animal dung.
<p>	A horse, for instance, produces about 45 pounds of manure each day. In American cities before the advent of automobiles, massive amounts of horse manure collected daily on streets, sidewalks, and public property. The resulting mess fouled the air, and contaminated water and food. It had to be collected and dumped or buried, often at great expense. And the horses died. In the late 19th century, New York City had to dispose of some 15,000 dead horses a year. Sometimes this difficult task wasn't performed as quickly as it should have been, resulting in outbreaks of disease.
<p>	In 1885, a British writer described London in the supposedly pristine days before the car. "It is a vast stagnant swamp, which no man dare enter, since death would be his inevitable fate. There exhales from this oozy mass so fatal a vapor that no animal can endure it. The black water bears a greenish-brown floating scum, which forever bubbles up from the putrid mud of the bottom. . . . It is dead."
<p>	Fred Smith, the president of the Competitive Enterprise Institute, in Washington, D.C., and a former environmental regulator, notes that the automobile swept away many of these environmental problems. Besides reducing the need to deal with horse and draught-animal wastes and corpses, the car "encouraged developments that reduce air pollution," he observed in Reason magazine. Before the automobile, most urban homes and businesses were heated with coal, an extremely dirty source of energy that spewed sulfur dioxide, particulates, and toxic ash into the air. As the demand for gasoline stimulated oil exploration, heating oil and natural gas became cheaper and more readily available.
<p>	Did the inventors and early manufacturers of the automobile perceive its potential environmental benefits? Have General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler been run by environmental activists for the past half-century? Hardly. Their environmental records are mixed. Nor have all the environmental problems created by the human need for transportation and fuel been "solved" -- particularly in those unique areas, such as southern California, where topography and climate make auto emissions, regardless of how numerous their source, a continuing problem. The automobile example shows only that economic decisions, motivated by an insatiable demand for higher productivity, lower costs, and bigger profit margins, can have unforeseen benefits for third parties and the environment.
<P>
<b>It's Not Easy Being Green</b>
<p>	One problem for corporate managers is that years of apocalyptic rhetoric and breathless media coverage have created environmental illiteracy among many Americans, including potential consumers and employees. When McDonald's first began to research whether its plastic "clamshell" hamburger boxes posed a significant waste-disposal problem, company scientists came to the conclusion that paper wrappers would actually be harder to recycle. But in a well-publicized 1990 decision, the restaurant chain nevertheless switched to paper.
<p>	The reason wasn't sound environmental policymaking, but public relations. A letter-writing campaign organized by environmental activists and teachers had schoolchildren across the country telling their favorite fast-food outlet (and their parents) that they wanted paper rather than plastic to "save the planet." McDonald's complied. Subsequently, a study in <i>Science</i> concluded that the plastic alternative was less environmentally harmful, once all the relevant costs -- such as the energy expended to make the paper wrappings -- were factored in.
<p>    Not only did McDonald's appear to make the environmentally "wrong" decision, but the company also nipped a promising business venture in the bud. Before the paper-packaging decision was announced, Dow Chemical and seven other plastic manufacturers had formed the National Polystyrene Recycling Company to recycle polystyrene from 450 McDonald's restaurants. The switch to paper nixed the deal, which would have advanced plastics recycling.
<p>	The effect of corporate decisions on the environment are, in other words, extremely difficult to predict with accuracy. Corporations pursuing profit have as much chance of generating environmental benefits as regulators or environmental activists do -- particularly when they are faced with prices for waste disposal that are as close to cost as possible.
<p>	For natural resources over which property rights are relatively easy to establish, such as oil, minerals, or timber, prices serve as an early-warning signal to companies about scarcity. If the price is rising, that suggests more demand for the resource than can be met by available supply. Companies then have a financial incentive either to find new supplies or to reduce its need by developing alternatives or ferreting out waste. This market process amounts to a sort of ongoing environment research project seeking an answer to this question: What is the most efficient and least resource-depleting method of producing the goods and services people need?
<p>	A good example of how this process works can be found in the development by Bristol-Myers-Squibb of a new way to make Taxol, a treatment for ovarian and breast cancer. Taxol had been made from the bark of the endangered Pacific yew tree, but the process killed the tree. Responding to the mounting cost of obtaining Pacific yew bark, the company found a way to make Taxol from the needles and twigs of the more common Himalayan yew tree, thus assuring a continued supply of Taxol while reducing the need to harvest the endangered species.
<p>	For resources over which property rights haven't been established, either because of technical difficulty or because of bad public-policy decisions, the pricing system doesn't work as well. When governments relieve corporations of the need for pay the full cost of disposing of waste, for example, by operating and subsidizing waste collection, landfills, incinerators, and recycling programs, they reduce the incentive for those corporations to find alternative methods that produce less waste.
<p>	
<b>Environmental Surprises</b>
<p>	Some ecological benefits come from surprising places. Man-made pesticides and the companies that produce them, for example, are often reviled for the risks they supposedly pose to humans and habitats. But according to Dennis Avery, the director of global food issues for the Hudson Institute, the Herculean efforts by American companies and researchers to make farming more productive -- by introducing insecticides, herbicides, crop-breeding, and genetic engineering -- have reduced the need for farmland in the United States and other countries. Besides lowering the real price and improving the quality of the foods consumers buy, this happy result has had the side-effect of protecting forests and other sensitive habitats from being cleared for agriculture. "Today's typical environmentalist worries about how many spiders and pigweeds survive in an acre of monoculture corn without giving environmental credit for the millions of organisms thriving on the two acres that didn't have to be plowed because we tripled crop yields," Avery comments.
<p>	Actually, reducing the price and improving the quality of agricultural produce has had its own salutary effects on human health. Throughout human history, most people in most societies have had little to eat. Starvation has until recently been the typical state of much of the Earth's population. Only within the past century, and especially since the early 1900s, has agricultural productivity increased rapidly enough to guarantee a plentiful supply of food at affordable prices in developed countries. 		Much of this productivity is due to the invention and production of agricultural chemicals and the development of new farming practices by American entrepreneurs. Even today, herbicides and pesticides make fruits and vegetables cheaper and more attractive. One study by Texas A&M University researchers found that without pesticides, potato yields would drop 50 percent, orange yields by 55 percent, and corn yields by 78 percent. Prices for these commodities would rise tremendously without pesticides.
<p>	Companies introducing these agricultural innovations have clearly advanced the interests of their shareholders, too. The Monsanto Co., founded in 1901 to produce saccharin in competition with German firms, has since diversified into chemicals, fibers, plastics, and pharmaceuticals. Two of its most profitable products for the past 30 years have been the popular herbicides Lasso (introduced in 1969) and Roundup (1973), one of the best-selling agricultural products of all time. Monsanto continues to introduce new products to increase agricultural productivity, such as Posilac, which boosts milk production in cows and reduces per-unit consumption of feed grains.
<p>
<b>Plastic Pleasures</b>
<p>	If anything symbolizes the irresponsible corporation in the minds of many theorists, it is the manufacturer of that epitome of 20th-century wastefulness, plastic. Typically made from oil, a nonrenewable resource, plastic has come to represent everything that is wrong with American commercial life and our "throwaway culture." But is plastic really a significant environmental problem? Does it provide no benefits to human health and safety or the environment that need to be weighed?
<p>	William Rathje, a professor of archeology at the University of Arizona, has spent years studying solid-waste disposal patterns. His excavations of landfills have found that plastics make up about 7 percent by weight and 16 percent by volume of the typical landfill -- much less than paper or yard waste. Polystyrene plastic, used in drinking cups and those "clamshell" hamburger containers McDonald's abandoned, makes up only 1 percent of landfill volume. Fast-food packaging amounts to no more than one-third of 1 percent. Of course, environmentalists fault plastic for much more than taking up space in landfills. They point out that plastic manufacturing relies on extracting and transporting oil. But since less than 2 percent of the world's petroleum is used to produce petrochemicals of all kinds, from fertilizers to plastics, the impact on oil consumption of using plastic to make consumer products is negligible.<p>
	Consider, on the other hand, the benefits of plastic. Even something as banal as plastic wrap has been a tremendous boon for Americans' health and safety. A hundred years ago, grocery stores had little in the way of prepackaged foods. At the turn of the century, paper packaging began to enter food retailing, but it had limitations. Meat, for example, was still often shipped in the form of whole carcasses only 50 years ago. Consumers would request particular cuts of meat from butchers, who kept carcasses until they were all sold or completely spoiled. The meat was expensive, particularly because butchers spent so much time carving it.
<p>	During the 1950s, however, the advent of plastic packaging began to change food delivery. Dow Chemical of Midland, Michigan, was an industry leader, not only in supplying plastic products to businesses but also by introducing its first major consumer product, Saran Wrap, in 1953. Plastic packaging allowed grocers to sell smaller portions at lower prices, and consumers to store food more efficiently and effectively. One study estimates that the modern system of packaging lowers the price of beef by about 40 cents a pound, while improving its quality.
<p>	Furthermore, the use of plastic and other types of packaging for foods seems to have reduced, not increased, total household waste. When Rathje took his garbage-archeology team to Mexico City in 1990, they found that the average household there discarded 40 percent more refuse each day than the average U.S. household, because Mexicans ate more whole fruits and vegetables and thus had more rinds, peels, and other food debris. In America, food processors sell prepackaged fruits and vegetables in cans, bags, or microwaveable plastic containers. From an environmental standpoint, this has the effect of accumulating the food debris in a central location, thus making it easier to dispose of in the form of compost, animal feed, and other products.
<p>	Today, the American plastics industry is one of the most innovative in the world. By finding new ways to manufacture, package, and store products that cost less, last longer, require fewer resources, and reduce harm to the environment, the industry is constantly improving the way we live. Since World War II, innovations in the manufacture, design, and use of plastics have yielded tremendous benefits for the public in terms of safety, health, economy, and quality of life. Consider these examples:
<p>	Plastic tubing made possible the first disposable, ready-to-use hypodermic needles. Initially introduced for combat use in the 1940s, the disposable needle soon made it possible to conduct safe and effective mass inoculations against disease in America and throughout the world.
<p>	In 1945, Earl Tupper introduced the first flexible plastic storage containers to replace glass, earthenware, and metal containers for storing food and other perishables. His product, Tupperware, vastly improved the freshness and quality of stored food.
<p>	Plastic siphon tubing made mass irrigation possible in the 1940s and 1950s, thus contributing to the Green Revolution that increased agricultural productivity and eliminated famine in much of the world. In the 1960s, plastic pipes began to replace other forms of piping for water distribution and drainage, because they were lighter and easier to install and resisted corrosion better than alternatives.
<p>	Plastic innovations during the past three decades by such companies as Phillips Petroleum, Union Carbide, and Shell Chemical have made possible such life-saving and life-enhancing products as artificial organs, comfortable prosthetics, body armor for law-enforcement personnel, unbreakable but light children's toys, and many automotive parts.
<p>	Cheap, all-temperature performance, flame-retardant, high-impact-resistant plastic parts made the first home computers -- manufactured by Apple Computer and Tandy -- viable products.
<p>	Lingering environmental controversies such as the risks of dioxin -- which many view as a potent human carcinogen -- are being resolved by plastic designers who, just in the past few years, have developed products that reduce or eliminate these real or perceived environmental problems. GE Plastics, for example, developed a new flame-retardant product that doesn't produce dioxin and that is also easier to make and costs no more than the plastic it replaces. Apple Computer is using the product in its Macintosh line of personal computers. Waste-to-energy plants, which dispose of about 60,000 tons of refuse each day and supply electricity to nearly a million Americans, also employ a series of technologies that reduce dioxin emissions to almost immeasurable levels.
<p>
<b>The Recycling Conundrum</b>
<p>	An article of faith among environmental advocates is that recycling will help American business conserve natural resources and demonstrate its environmental responsibility. This assumption doesn't account for the potential costs, including environmental costs, of pursuing recycling regardless of whether it is truly profitable.
<p>	For example, curbside recycling programs usually require more collection trucks. That means more fuel consumption and engine emissions. Some recycling programs produce high volumes of wastewater and use large amounts of energy. When researchers have tried to examine every aspect of the recycling equation -- from energy use to production costs -- they have found that sometimes recycling makes sense from an economic and environmental standpoint, while other times it does not.
<p>	Aluminum cans are a clear example of a commercial package that should be recycled. It takes 10 percent less energy to recycle aluminum than it does to make it from mined bauxite. So aluminum recycling is profitable -- and commonplace. Steel is also relatively economical to recycle. Virtually all products made with steel contain at least 25 percent reclaimed steel. On the other hand, recycling fruit-juice containers probably doesn't make economic or ecological sense. Filling disposable cardboard boxes takes half as much energy as filling recyclable glass bottles. For a given beverage volume, transporting the empty glass bottles requires 15 times as many trucks as does transporting disposable boxes. Transporting the containers once they are filled also costs less when using disposable boxes. Juice boxes don't break like glass bottles can, they are easily packed or frozen, and they seem to encourage juice consumption among the young, with whom they have proven to be popular.
<p>	For some commodities, such as newsprint, it seems that the only way to make recycling profitable is to force manufacturers to use them. Many states have laws requiring that newspapers contain a certain percentage of recycled paper, thus artificially creating a demand for newsprint. Even mandates sometimes fail to make recycling work: In Germany, laws requiring plastics recycling have resulted in a glut of collected plastics with few economical uses. Advocates for such laws point out that market prices don't capture all the costs of alternatives to recycling. But prices nevertheless contain important information. When forest stocks become scarcer, for example, the price of virgin timber rises, thus making recyclables more attractive. Similarly, as long as landfills are run to at least break even, then as they fill up their tipping fees will rise, again encouraging diversion of waste products into recycling or reuse. These price mechanisms already exist to a significant degree, and yet paper and plastic recycling often makes no sense absent government mandates.	

<p>For corporate managers trying to make heads or tails of the economic and environmental issues surrounding recycling, the answer may well be to trust an imperfect system of market prices over an even more imperfect attempt to guess at the ecological impact of various waste-reduction and recycling strategies. In everyday decisionmaking, this means weighing costs and benefits while maximizing shareholder return.
<p>

	Ford saved millions in 1994 when it converted several components of its automobiles into 100 percent recycled plastic. Chrysler is using completely recycled plastic in the interior trim of its popular minivans. Both car companies have made increasing use of these recycled plastics, made by companies such as Washington Penn Plastics and AlliedSignal, because of their cost and performance advantages over "virgin" plastic, not because of an attempt to meet some vague environmental goal. The savings "go straight to the bottom line," said Tony Brooks, Ford's special recycling coordinator. "Ford's position is that we will do everything we can to use recycled materials in our cars, but they can't cost more than virgin and they must perform at least as well as virgin."
<p>
<b>Problem, Innovation, Solution</b>
<p>	Most environmental issues in America today represent not only public-sector controversies but also private-sector opportunities. For companies that can identify a problem and devise a solution, the potential profits are significant.
<p>	In the case of plastics, profit-seeking corporations are experimenting with edible food packaging that offers better protection, lower cost, and few environmental considerations. ConAgra, Inc., the processed-food giant, is working on an edible bag in which to package products such as frozen entrees that currently used plastic bags. "If you could make a boilable, edible bag, you could replace the plastic with something that is part of the food -- ultimately eliminating a source of package waste," says the company's packaging director, Brian Hopkins. Other companies are working along similar lines. Quaker Oats is testing edible coating for breakfast cereals. RJR Nabisco is working on a film made from milk protein that could be used to coat frozen fish products and baked goods.
<p>	These innovations aren't being pursued simply to reduce package waste. Food manufacturers also want to improve food preservation to enhance the taste and freshness of their products. Instead of having consumers buy whole fruits and vegetables, for example, and then slicing or dicing them at home, manufacturers could prepare large quantities of fresh produce -- such as pre-sliced onions or oranges -- and then preserve them with edible coatings. The cost of the foods would be lower, consumers could enjoy the convenience of pre-sliced ingredients, and waste peelings -- currently spread out over the entire population of homes -- would be centralized in manufacturing facilities and thus easier to dispose of. The resulting boon to human health would be significant. "Consumption of fresh fruits and vegetables could be higher if this service were provided," says Attila E. Pavlath, a food scientist with the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
<p>Other corporations are focusing their innovative energies on hazardous waste spills, hoping to profit from creative solutions to this most serious of environmental dangers. Whether it is the Exxon Valdez oil spill of 1989 or Superfund sites or underground leakage of cancer-causing chemicals, the topic of hazardous waste often generates passionate feelings and great concern about environmental damage. But is the answer to spills to be found in banning substances or jawboning industry to reduce its dependency on them? Many entrepreneurial U.S. companies say no.

<p>The answer, they suggest, is to find new ways to clean up spills quickly, easily, and effectively. Bioremediation -- using bacteria or fungi either found in nature or engineered in laboratories to clean up hazardous wastes -- is a promising technology that offers the prospect of a cleaner economy without sacrificing the modern industrial processes that make our so economy productive. In Seattle, UNOCAL is using petroleum-eating bacteria to clean a six-acre patch of dirt where an oily residue of gasoline and disease fuels had accumulated over 65 years of leaks from its Seattle Marketing Fuel Terminal. Once the site is clean, UNOCAL expects to sell it for a significant price to commercial or residential developers.
<p>	Bioremediation isn't exactly a new idea -- municipal water systems have long used bacteria to purify sewage and paper companies have used them to remove organic matter from industrial sludgesbut a bustling new industry of bioremediation enterprises promises to clean up such hazardous materials as DDT, wood preservatives, toxic petrochemicals, and radioactive waste. Corporate pioneers in the area include Amoco and Du Pont, but most of the new technologies are coming from small, start-up firms such as Remediation Technologies of Concord, Massachusetts, Alpha Environmental in Austin, Texas, and Envirogen of Lawrenceville, New Jersey. Ironically, many bioremediation approaches have come from a close observation of how Mother Nature herself deals with waste. In searching for microbes to clean up oil spills, Alpha Environmental president Eugene Douglas said, "we went to where there are natural oil seeps in the Mediterranean, Central Asia, and North America, but where there isn't what you'd call pollution. Over time, microbes at these sites have evolved the ability to ingest that oil."
<p>	Bioremediation isn't the only solution profit-seeking corporations are working on. For the problem of oil spills, for example, Sea Sweep, Inc. of Denver, Colorado has developed an oil-absorbing, floating material, made from heating sawdust and woodchips, that will absorb 3.5 times its weight in oil. If administered to a spill, Sea Sweep will absorb the oil and then float to the surface for easy collection, after which it can be burned as fuel. Wyoming-based Centech has developed a centrifuge that generates relatively clean water and marketable oil from oil sludge, which is a serious problem around crude oil storage tanks and pipelines. In the area of industrial wastes, Tennessee's Olin Corp. has developed a process for dramatically reducing absorbable organic halides (such as dioxin) from the paper pulp-bleaching process. Martin Marietta Energy Systems, Inc. has a process for dechlorinating wastewater streams.
<p>	It would be impossible to list all of the environmental innovations and inventions one can find in just a single year, ranging from simple reuse technologies at plant sites to machines and acids that remove virtually all known pollutants from energy plant emissions. Some of these technologies have been developed, as Gore suggests, in response to regulatory mandates. Others have come about as companies seek to reduce their waste disposal costs, improve the efficiency of their production processes, or find new areas of opportunity in a growing, constantly changing economy. It is through innovation and productivity gains, not through corporate munificence or a commitment to a theoretical environmental ethos, that American business will make its most important contribution to a cleaner world and the health and safety of the public. 
<p>	For corporate decisionmakers, true responsibility entails a recognition of the uncertainty that often accompanies environmental controversies and an unwillingness to put the interests of shareholders at risk by accepting environmental "truisms" at face value. It is by no means clear that simply recycling more, or substituting paper for plastic, or abandoning profitable enterprises because they require nonrenewable resources will necessarily serve environmental ends. Ultimately, such ends are determined and valued by human beings who also value healthful and reasonably priced foods, high-quality consumer goods, and job opportunities. The chances of making a poor decision are higher when corporate managers try to act like public policymakers or conservation experts.
<p>	Instead, as much as is practicable, corporations should let prices guide their decisions. In most cases, wasteful industrial practices impose measurable costs on firms, be they for waste disposal, raw-materials purchases, or lost customer revenue. Thus firms have every incentive to find alternatives. "For all environmental issues, shareholder value, rather than compliance, emissions, or costs, is the critical unifying metric," said McKinsey & Co. management consultants Noah Walley and Bradley Whitehead in their noted 1994 essay on corporate environmentalism in the <i>Harvard Business Review</i>. "That approach is environmentally sound, but it's also hardheaded, informed by business experience, and, as a result, much more likely to be truly sustainable over the long term."
<p>	An example of how truly responsible companies might make decisions about environmental issues is the case of Eco-Foam pellets, a substitute for Styrofoam peanuts in packing boxes or other containers. Texas-based American Excelsior Co. makes Eco-Foam out of corn starch and markets it as environmentally friendly. "The biggest benefit is that it's manufactured from renewable resources instead of petroleum products," says one local distributor. Should responsible companies concerned about the global environment use Eco-Foam instead of Styrofoam, then? Probably not. Managers need not evaluate all the pros and cons of the two products. They need only watch the price. In early 1995, Eco-Foam cost 25 percent more than Styrofoam. If we ever really start running out of oil, the price of petroleum products, including Styrofoam, will rise -- making alternatives competitive. Until then, the environmental benefits of switching to corn starch won't be worth the cost.
<p>	Public policymakers will continue to develop more efficient ways to regulate waste and pollution, and scientists will continue to gather information about the environmental risks from various substances or practices. As they do, pricing structures will evolve that communicate even more accurate information to manufacturers and entrepreneurs about the true cost of commercial activities and the potential rewards from innovative solutions to environmental problems.
<p>	There are many promising trends in environmental thinking and regulatory policy, from markets for emissions permits to the increased use of cost-benefit analysis to establish public priorities. Once ecological and economic ends are brought closer together, the perceived clash of interests between American business and Mother Nature will largely disappear. For corporations, the complex issues of environmental responsibility will always be challenging. But dealing with them requires no redefinition of the core profit-seeking purpose of economic enterprises.

<b>Policy Review</b><br>
<i>Fall 1995, Number 74</i></center><p>
	Two competing paradigms of education reform have emerged in the United States in recent years, and the differences between them are growing sharper. One, commonly termed "systemic reform," assumes that reform efforts should be led by government and imposed from the top down. Its advocates believe that state (or federal) authorities must set standards not only for student learning, but also for teacher training, pupil assessments, textbooks, and school resources. Though undertaken in pursuit of higher standards and better results, systemic reform relies on uniform strategies to ensure that "inputs" everywhere are equal and all schools undertake similar activities. Government resources and bureaucratic regulation are, of course, its preferred mechanism for making this happen. Much of Goals 2000 embodies this approach.<p>	The second reform paradigm, which we call "reinventing education," embraces decentralized control, entrepreneurial management, and grassroots initiatives, all within a framework of publicly defined standards and accountability. Under this approach, public officials establish standards, make assessments, and hold schools accountable for meeting performance goals but do not themselves run the schools. Public officials also retain the power to cancel charters and school-management contracts on grounds of consistently poor performance, but they do not directly supervise or control the means by which schools pursue those ends.<p>	Under this paradigm, education may be delivered through charter schools (licensed by public authorities such as a state, city, or local school district), "opt out" schools that secede from their local education agencies and run themselves with what amounts to a "block grant" of public funds, "contract schools" (in which a performance contract is negotiated between private educational managers and a public agency), and "choice" programs (in which students use scholarships or publicly-funded vouchers to attend the schools of their choice). In all such situations, the continuing responsibility of public authorities is to establish standards for educational and fiscal performance and monitor progress in relation to those standards. (Those who reject this degree of public accountability may, of course, turn to wholly private schools or home schooling.)<p>	The "reinvention" approach welcomes diverse strategies and schools organized and run by various entities such as teacher cooperatives, parent associations, private corporations, religious institutions, and community-based organizations. It assumes that students and families are different and should be free to match themselves to the schools that suit them best. It requires little bureaucracy and few regulations because it rejects the proposition that schools must be centrally managed according to a single formula.<p>	We strongly favor the "reinvention" paradigm, provided that it contains one key element borrowed from the "systemic" approach: standards and accountability. It is our conviction that only clear and high standards for performance will ensure accountability, both to the marketplace (that is, to families making informed choices among schools) and to whatever public body authorizes the schools to operate.<p>	These standards need not be national, they need not be highly detailed, they should not prescribe pedagogy or resource use, and they need not cover the entire curriculum. (Indeed, the ability of schools to add their own features to the "core" described in the standards is part of what will make them different from one another.) But only when such standards are in place -- and accompanied by good tests and a steady flow of performance information -- can parents make informed choices among schools and public authorities determine which schools deserve to retain their "charters," contracts, or accreditations.<p>	These two approaches are now competing with each other, not only in Washington, D.C., but also in the states. Systemic reform remains the favored strategy of the Clinton administration and of some educators (especially in state departments of education and teachers unions), but the "reinvention" alternative is preferred in many other quarters -- including by many elected officials, business leaders, and parents, as well as by teachers and principals who welcome the possibility of breaking free from the stifling grip of bureaucracy. <p>	The reinvention impulse has even reached Capitol Hill, where the past year saw stirrings of the first major push in memory to "devolve" centralized activities to states, communities, and families and to lift restrictions on the use of federal aid. This impulse arises partly from the quest for better education, but also from a reaction against the regulatory burden of federal regulations and unfunded mandates.<p>	This is the motive behind recent congressional activity concerning "block grants" in areas as diverse as welfare, school lunches, and job training, as well as education aid. To be sure, turning categorical programs into block grants and devolving control to states and communities will not automatically foster reinvention. Indeed, recipients may not do much of anything. But doing away with "Washington-knows-best" approaches and removing strings from federal dollars at least permits reform-minded states and communities to experiment with new strategies for education and other public servicesand closes the easy route of blaming Uncle Sam for poor results.<p>	The federal government is so hamstrung by special interest groups that getting it out of the way of change-minded states and communities may be the most we can expect from Washington on the "reinvention" front. Certainly, all efforts by Uncle Sam to foster such reforms directly have proven halfhearted at best and fraudulent at worst. The so-called "Improving America's Schools Act" of 1994, for example, banned any use of federal aid for privately managed public schools and created a school "choice" program so laden with preconditions and constraints that it must be termed phony. It enables members of Congress to say they "voted for school choice" while ensuring that there is none.<p>	Even rigorous accountability based on testing was discouraged by explicit prohibitions in the Goals 2000 legislation on the use of federal funds for this purpose. Those who believe that such reforms are the main hope for serious educational improvement are learning that Washington is the wrong place to look. But much is happening elsewhere in the nation under the "reinvention" banner.
<p><b>Potemkin Charters</b><p>	The charter school idea has picked up tremendous momentum, as have variants, such as a flock of new, miniature high schools in New York City that are not called charters but share many of their characteristics. Those qualities include a large measure of operational independence from headquarters in return for a promise to achieve certain results over a stated period of time. (New York City's quasi-charters, however, have not agreed to any educational performance goals, and their quasi-independence relies on waivers by the local teachers union, waivers that do not even apply to the schools' many other employees.)<p>	By summer 1995, 19 states had enacted explicit "charter" school laws, including eight during the most recent legislative session (Louisiana, Arkansas, New Hampshire, Texas, Alaska, Wyoming, Delaware, and Rhode Island). Several hundred such schools were scheduled to be open this fall. Charter schools are no panacea -- not in a country with 85,000 public schools -- but this movement is the second-most-exciting development on the educational reform front.<p>	Not all charter laws are created equal, however, and several enacted in recent months are so weak that they are unlikely to do much good. We think of them as "Potemkin" charter programs with an impressive facade but no substance. Some of these laws were supported by people who actually oppose charter schools on principle and had decided to undermine support for them by promoting a bill that pretended to create them. This is currently happening in New Jersey, where the state teachers union is supporting a weak charter bill in the state assembly, although a stronger, competing bill supported by the state education commissioner, the state senate, and Governor Christine Whitman may yet prevail.<p>	Weak charter laws generally suffer from at least one of three serious failings:<p><ul><li>	They require the prior assent of too many "stakeholders," such as a majority of teachers currently teaching in the affected schools, and contain no mechanism for creating new charter schools that do not already possess such stakeholders. Of course, it would be wonderful if existing schools converted to charter status with the support of a majority of teachers and parents working together, and that is sure to happen in some places. But there are also situations in which parents and community leaders want to start a new school, and they should be allowed to do sowith the staff they want to teach in it. (Currently, California's charter law requires the approval of a majority of teachers, as do those in Georgia, Hawaii, and New Mexico.)<p>
<li>	They place local school boards in sole charge of granting charters. (Wyoming, Louisiana, and Texas have recently enacted such laws.) Though such a limitation is invariably a key political goal of school board lobbyists, it can be fatal for charter schools, because the uniform policies of a benighted local board and risk-averse superintendent are usually what charter-seekers are keenest to escape. That is why strong charter laws either lodge the authority to issue charters with a different entity (such as a state superintendent or state board) or -- better yet -- create multiple windows or appeal mechanisms so that no single entity has the absolute power to deny a charter application. In Michigan and Minnesota, state universities have the authority to issue charters. In Arizona, besides vesting this authority in both local and state school boards, the legislature created a new "charter school" board exclusively for this purpose<p>.<li>	They neglect to exempt charter schools from enough of the statutes, regulations, and contractual provisions that burden conventional schools. Thus, the charter school is not truly free to chart its own course. The whole point of such a school, after all, is to gain autonomy of action in return for accountability for results. The only regulations that charter schools should be expected to comply with are those governing health and safety and protections against racial discrimination. But many states leave numerous other rules in place. If a state still requires that U.S. history be taught in the 11th grade, that a school's pupil-teacher ratio cannot exceed 25:1, that 40 minutes a day must be spent on math, that certain textbooks must be purchased, and if there is no respite from seniority rules, salary schedules, or tenure requirements, then we see little point in calling an entity so regulated a "charter school." Such a charter is unlikely to be worth the paper it is printed on -- and few will go to the bother of seeking such a document.</ul><p>
	Why have so many states created these Potemkin charter programs? The explanation, of course, has to do with power and politics, catalyzed by the education establishment's fierce resistance to changes that threaten its monopoly. Though many teachers and principals crave opportunities to "opt out" of the system and run their own schools without the incessant oversight, time-wasting regulations, and innumerable mandates of the bureaucracy, their professional organizations seldom see it this way. Thus teachers unions, school-board associations, and superintendents, if they cannot defeat the charter bill altogether, generally do their utmost to weaken it. So do other advocacy groupsfor example, special educationwhose stock-in-trade is rule-bound uniformity rather than diversity. In fact, the Southwest Regional Laboratory recently leveled a novel criticism: that charter schoolsprecisely because many of them demand a high degree of parent involvementare unfair to children with bad parents!<p>	Obtaining a charter does not end the hazards that await these schools. Most also encounter practical problems when they first launch. One perennial challenge is finding a place to operate a charter school. To our knowledge, no state provides charter operators with buildings or capital financing. Though this is no huge burden for existing schools that convert to charter status, it poses a great obstacle to the creation of new charter schools. Another problem is that many charter school founders and managers have little prior experience in matters such as financial management, purchasing, and marketing.<p>	Our hunch, however, is that these are birthing and growing pains associated with a feisty, infant reform strategy that will, in time, turn into a strapping youth. We doubt that opponents will be able to halt its growth. In England, where "grant-maintained" schools have been in place for several years -- and where almost a fifth of all secondary schools have "opted out" into this independent status -- even the Labor Party is having to come to terms with their continued existence. Indeed, party leader Tony Blair now sends his own child to a grant-maintained school.<p><b>Gains for School Choice</b>
<p>	There was major progress on the choice front in 1994-95, centering on Milwaukee and Cleveland. In Wisconsin, Governor Tommy Thompson succeeded in persuading the legislature to pass his proposal to expand Milwaukee's voucher experiment to include many more children and to permit attendance at church-affiliated schools. As revised, and assuming the courts eventually assent, up to 15,000 low-income Milwaukee children (nearly all of them minority) will be able to attend any school within the city limits.<p>	In Ohio, the legislature agreed to a proposal by Governor George Voinovich to initiate a voucher "pilot" in 1996 for children in Cleveland. That city's catastrophically bad school system was "taken over" by the state under a federal court order in early 1995. Here, too, church-affiliated schools will be eligible recipients of voucher-bearing youngsters -- up to 2,000 of them. And here, too, the primary beneficiaries of this reform will be low-income minority youngsters.<p>	Court battles have already begun, and we do not doubt that choice's foes, having lost two significant political battles, will now throw vast resources into the effort to get vouchers thrown out as a violation of the "Establishment Clause" of the First Amendment. In August, the Wisconsin Supreme Court issued a temporary injunction against the Milwaukee plan. But the governors and legislators of Wisconsin and Ohio deserve hearty applause from those who believe, as we do, that no child should be forced to attend a bad public school against his and his parents' will when a better school -- public, private, or hybrid -- is available close by. Because the families of poor children often lack the wherewithal to exercise such a choice on their own, it is the obligation of elected officials to make it possible for them, as they have historically done in higher education. That this will now happen in two major U.S. cities is a development of immense significance to American education. <p>	A number of other states stepped up to the "choice" plate in 1995 but struck out. In Texas, Pennsylvania, Connecticut, Illinois, and Arizona, variations on the voucher theme failed to pass, and New Jersey delayed consideration of Mayor Bret Schundler's Jersey City plan until at least autumn of this year. The original Ohio choice bill, to encompass a broader area than Cleveland, was chopped down by the legislature. Another setback was the ruling by Puerto Rico's Supreme Court that the voucher program there violated the commonwealth's constitution.<p>	Nothing, of course, elicits tougher opposition from defenders of the public-school status quo than voucher schemes (and similar ventures that go by different names), even when such plans are aimed precisely at those disadvantaged children who are most likely to drop out of public school. But the idea is not going away. Meanwhile, privately-funded voucher projects also continue to multiply, from New York's Student/Sponsor Partnership, to the Golden Rule program launched in Indianapolis in 1991. Today 23 programs reach more than 10,000 students. <p>	We believe that it is just a matter of time before children from needy families in most parts of the country will be able to carry their vouchers (or scholarships or whatever they may be called) to any accredited school. We understand that some private schools fear government regulation, and may decline to participate. We recognize that public aid should be targeted toward those students in greatest need (as is now the case in higher education); and we acknowledge that the Supreme Court will have to sort through the constitutional questions posed by inclusion of parochial schools. (Recent Supreme Court decisions in this domain have encouraged voucher supporters.)<p>	Still, it must be noted that, in the meantime, primary and secondary schooling is becoming increasingly anomalous as vouchers come to prevail in most other domains of U.S. domestic policy. Even President Clinton has endorsed vouchers in job training and in public housing. Moreover, much of the rest of the world -- from Australia to Chile to the Netherlands -- treats publicly-subsidized private-school attendance as routine and normal.<p><b>Contract Management</b><p>
	Paul Hill's superb new book <i>Reinventing Public Education</i> sets forth a comprehensive vision of how this approach could work in the future -- and why it is apt to work better than direct operation of all schools by the school system's central office. Meanwhile, Educational Alternatives, Inc. (EAI) continues to manage a number of schools in Baltimore and recently added Hartford, Connecticut, to its portfolio. The superintendent of schools in the District of Columbia has tried to revive his plan to engage EAI to run some of D.C.'s troubled schools. A private management firm is functioning as "superintendent of schools" in Minneapolis.<p>The Edison Project opened its first four schools in 1995, with others due to follow if these succeed. And at least two other companies are already active in this field in the United States. Sabis is an international group that has been running a school in Minnesota and recently added a second (charter) school in Springfield, Massachusetts. Nashville-based Alternative Public School Strategies has reached an agreement with little Wilkinsburg, Pennsylvania, to run one of three elementary schools in that community -- a school in which 78 percent of students receive free or reduced-price lunches. (The future of this contract, however, is shadowed by ambiguity in the laws of Pennsylvania as to the legality of such an arrangement.) More companies and communities will surely follow, probably including big corporate guns such as Disney, which is creating a school in Florida that many view as a prototype.<p>	Unfortunately, not all the blossoms in this garden are healthy. EAI's relationship with a school in Dade County, Florida, has ended. Baltimore mayor Kurt Schmoke -- whose strong support is the main reason EAI has been able to withstand intense establishment pressure in that city -- has voiced dissatisfaction with student performance in the EAI-run schools after three years and has suggested that the arrangement may need to be rethought. And EAI's bold plan to alter budget priorities in Hartford kicked up such a storm from vested interests -- imagine shifting funds from surplus staff to areas such as technologythat the company and school board have decided to scale back most of the changes, at least for now, from the entire district to six schools that have "volunteered" for the full treatment. <p>	The difficulties of EAI in Baltimore and Hartford suggest that contracting will probably work best with new schools and with existing schools that are receptive. It is difficult to graft a new management program onto a school whose staff is determined to defeat the new managers. Perhaps private management should begin with a single school or manageable number of schools that want to be changed. Otherwise, the new managers will be forced to maintain all the elements of a system that currently does not work for children. And if they do, they will be doomed to fail.<p>	As for Edison, there is incredible pressure on its first four schools to be nearly perfect -- educationally, organizationally, and budgetarily -- from the very outset. The venture's future hinges on how well it meets these immense expectations. Every education journalist and researcher in the Western world is knocking on the Edison schools' door, probing for defects or missteps. No conventionally-run public school in America is likely to be subjected to the same degree of scrutiny or held to the same standards of perfection.<p>	In our view, contract management of public schools holds considerable promise, and these trials should be encouraged. We should also expect bumps along the road as these schools get their bearings; some may even fail. It is well to bear in mind, however, that we currently keep failing public schools open and even reward them when they should be closed down. Therefore, when a poorly run contract school or charter school is terminated, we should see such an action as a victory rather than a setback for the reinvention strategy. If and when that happens, it will prove that school authorities are willing to be held accountable for poor results.<p>	Meanwhile, beware the word "privatization," which is widely used by supporters of the current system to block all movement toward contract management. True "privatization" means selling or otherwise transferring a public asset to private owners who henceforth bear sole responsibility for its existence and are accountable to no one save their shareholders.<p>	That is what is happening to certain big, state-run factories in Eastern Europe, for example, but it is not what firms such as EAI and Edison are doing with the U.S. schools they manage under contract. Those schools remain public in every sense that a student, parent, taxpayer, or voter could think important: They are open to the public, financed by the public, and educationally and fiscally accountable to public authorities for their continued existence (and for the retention or termination of their private managers). Here is a sure test of whether an organization has been privatized: If public authorities can cancel the contract or withdraw the charter, the transaction is not privatization. It is a management contract on behalf of the public, not a transfer of public goods to private ownership.<p><b>Governance Changes</b><p>	The century-old governance structure of American public education is showing signs of change. As a recent <i>Education Week</i> headline put it, "Fervor spreads to overhaul state agencies."<p>	This year, it appears, 30 states carried out or at least considered reorganization or reduction of their education departments, mirroring the popular political trends of reducing government, pushing authority to local officials, and giving power to the elected officials whom the voters are apt to hold responsible at the polls for the effective use of their tax dollars. (Education spending is the largest or second-largest budget item in every state.)<p>	Texas offers a dramatic example. Now the second most populous state, Texas has been long known to have perhaps the most highly regulated school system in the country, with an immensely detailed education code and an all-powerful state education agency. Early this year, the legislature agreed with Governor George W. Bush Jr. that significant changes were needed. In effect, they repealed the entire education code and started afresh.<p>	The authority of the Texas Education Agency has been limited to six basic functions, including recommending education goals, granting campus charters, managing school funds, and administering federal programs. Several new categories of schools and school systems have been authorized, including "home rule" districts that are freed from most state mandates and charter schools that may be organized by individuals or groups outside the existing school system. (Unfortunately, as we noted earlier, almost all Texas charters must be issued by the local school board, and these boards are not likely to welcome dissenting approaches.) Texas also created a new network of alternative schools and made it easier to remove disruptive students from regular classrooms. And it created a powerful new state board for educator certification, to be named by the governor.<p>	Other states have taken different approaches. Minnesota abolished its department of education and merged these functions into a new department of children, families, and learning. Wisconsin took virtually all duties and powers away from its independently-elected state school superintendent, an office that was widely perceived as a captive of the education establishment, and turned them over to a new agency answerable to the governor. New Jersey's governor "froze" the regulatory process and directed the education commissioner and his colleagues to propose a comprehensive overhaul.North Carolina -- another highly centralized, heavily regulated state -- is shrinking its department of education by half and rewriting laws and regulations to give local districts far greater flexibility. The state has established annual performance standards for the state's almost 2,000 public schools based on "reasonable progress" in reading, writing, and math and with various interventions, sanctions (including suspension of principals and teachers), and rewards for success or failure to meet those standards. In other words, the state is moving from a regulatory compliance strategy to one based on standards and results.<p>	Illinois also made a radical change, though it affects only the city of Chicago, whose troubled and deficit-plagued schools have been the object of innumerable reform efforts in recent years. The legislature gave unprecedented control to the mayor, who has appointed (and can remove) all members of a small newly created "board of trustees" and a management team that includes a chief operating officer and fiscal, purchasing, and educational officers. The new law also places school principals in charge of all school employees (previously they had no authority over custodians) and authorizes them to set their own school hours and staff schedules. The Chicago Teachers Union is barred from bargaining over many nonsalary issues such as class size, staff assignments, academic calendar, hours and places of instruction, pupil assessment policies, privatizing services, and decisions over charter schools. It is also forbidden to strike for the next 18 months.<p><b>Will Unions Get with the Program?</b><p>	Chicago is not the only place where teachers unions have run afoul of public authorities. Largely because of their efforts to block state and local reforms, the unions are coming under more intense scrutiny and challenge. School boards, legislatures, and governors are promulgating policies and proposing legislation to abolish tenure, redefine collective bargaining rights, repeal "fair-share" agreements, and otherwise change laws and practices that sustain union interests and undergird their power.<p>	In Indiana, for example, the "fair share" law has been repealed. This law had authorized unions to extract fees from nonunion members in return for "services" performed for them by the unions, regardless of whether the individuals wanted those services. (An obvious example is a wage increase that affects all teachers in the district.) By repealing this law, the legislature made it illegal for unions to negotiate such arrangements with school districts. In another, more localized blow to the Indiana State Teachers Association, the legislature passed a reform bill for the Indianapolis schools that limits collective bargaining to the issue of wages only in that city. <p>	In neighboring Michigan, the state also erased collective bargaining over certain nonsalary issues, empowered school boards to put teachers' health insurance out for competitive bidding (rather than compelling purchase of this benefit from the Michigan Education Association's insurance subsidiary), instituted steep fines against teachers who go on strike, and forbade the union to deduct political contributions from teachers' paychecks without their permission.<p>	Such developments are apt to continue as long as unions throw sand in the reform gears. When education is reshaped around standards and performance rather than inputs and processes, just about every established routine will be affected, including personnel practices. No aspect of a school's management is more crucial to its effectiveness than how it handles staffing, and nothing is more fatal to performance-based innovation than attempts to preserve staffing rules that disregard performance.<p>	In New York City, for example, the contract with the United Federation of Teachers allows a school, if 75 percent of the staff agrees, to be included in the "school-based option transfer plan," which lets it (among other union-rule waivers) select its own teachers rather than having staff assigned on the basis of seniority. Sixty schools, including most of the struggling new, small high schools, have opted to be included in the program.<p>	In the city's 1,000 other public schools, however, which enroll 99 percent of the children in the system, transfers to vacancies continue to be based strictly on seniority. Junior teachers can be "bumped" by more senior teachers from other schools, no matter how much a school may want the junior teacher or how little it wants the more senior teacher. Such practices, of course, make it impossible for a school's staff to develop its own ethos, which is essential to the staff's effectiveness and its ability to work together as a team with shared goals.<p>	The Educational Excellence Network has had a long history of successful association on important projects with the American Federation of Teachers at the national level, and the authors of this report admire AFT head Albert Shanker's defense of high standards and high stakes, his international work on behalf of democracy, and his good sense about curricula issues. His staff has also produced some terrific products, and several AFT locals have pioneered (or at least tolerated) some promising reform strategies.<p>	At the state and local levels, however, far more often than not, the AFT and NEA are the most potent protectors of the status quo. In principle, they could change, abandoning their tired industrial model of unionism and turning to the flexible, responsibility- and accountability-seeking, participatory, professional approach to organizational behavior that modern organizations need, and that many other organizations have. We do not know whether, if only for self-preservation, they will prove willing and able to take such a step. We certainly hope they will.

<h3>Will Conservative Welfare Reform Corrupt Religious Charities?</h3>
<hr size=3 width=50%>
<b>Amy L. Sherman</b><br>
<b>Policy Review</b><br>
<i>Fall 1995, Number 74</i></center>
<p>	Welfare reform, says Governor John Engler of Michigan, is not "just about reforming a broken system, but about reforming what is broken in the human character." Engler is one of a growing number of policymakers who seek to shift responsibility for helping the poor from government bureaucracies to civil institutions -- particularly religious ones -- that can address the underlying moral and cultural aspects of chronic welfare dependency. Indeed, amidst the flurry of federal and state initiatives to scale back the welfare state, religious nonprofits are becoming the new provider of choice for funding and delivering social programs.<p>Engler has approved a multimillion-dollar contract with the Salvation Army to care for the state's homeless population. Mississippi governor Kirk Fordice has established a "Faith and Families" project in which state social-service agencies work with churches to "adopt" welfare families. The federal government provides some 350 grant programs for social-service nonprofits, many of them with religious roots. U.S. Senators John Ashcroft and Dan Coats have proposed legislation allowing individuals a dollar-for-dollar tax credit for donations made to charities, including religious groups, that serve the poor.<p>The enthusiasm for religion-based providers is well-deserved. Christian-based substance-abuse recovery programs, for example, reportedly boast a 70 to 80 percent success rate, whereas secular therapeutic programs report an average success rate of 6 to 10 percent. Research by Roger Freeman of Harvard University shows that black inner-city youth who attend church are 47 percent less likely to drop out of school, 54 percent less likely to use drugs, and 50 percent less likely to engage in criminal activities than those without religious values. Columnist William Raspberry of the <i>Washington Post</i> recently asserted that the most successful social programs "are those that are driven -- even if only tacitly -- by moral or religious values."<p>So it's beginning to look like th
e secular state wants some old-time religion. But what impact will increased state funding have on religion-based programs? Will more money allow them to help more needy people, or will it dilute -- or pollute -- their ability to exert the moral and spiritual influence that makes them uniquely successful? <p>In Michigan, where Engler has aggressively collaborated with religious nonprofits, the results are mixed. State agencies tend to treat these nonprofits not as equals, but as subcontracting functionaries doing the government's bidding. State contracts almost always come with conditions -- regulations that sometimes diminish a religious group's best assets: its personal involvement, its credibility with the community, and its commitment to addressing not only physical needs but spiritual ones as well<p>Moreover, religious nonprofits that contract with the state may, as a result, shift their purpose from the transformation of lives to the mere delivery of services. The most effective groups challenge those who embrace faith to live out its moral implications in every significant area of their lives, from breaking drug or alcohol addictions and repairing family relationships to recommitting themselves to the value of honest work. But state social-service contracts aren't mainly concerned with such outcomes; they focus on the number of meals served, beds available, and checks cashed. <p>
<b>Engler Calls in the Army</b><p>The aim of his welfare-reform efforts, Engler says, is to smash the entitlement mentality, promote the idea that aid entails responsibility, and empower the private sector (particularly the religious community) to deliver welfare services. To accomplish the first two goals, Michigan in 1992 began requiring recipients of Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) to sign a "social contract" with the state that committed them to work, job training, or volunteer service for at least 20 hours per week. To accomplish the third goal, Engler has increased collaboration with and funding of religiously based social-service groups.<p>Some public-private partnerships in the state are still too young to afford solid conclusions about their effects. Nonetheless, the most formal and visible partnership in social welfare in Michigan -- the state's annual $9.5 million contract with the Salvation Army to assist the homeless -- sheds some light on the deficiencies of public-private collaboration.<p>In December 1991, the Michigan Department of Social Services (DSS) awarded the Salvation Army a $3 million grant to provide emergency shelter and two meals per day to homeless individuals, either in its own facilities or by "subcontracting" with other private shelter operators. The partnership resulted from the expectation that homelessness would increase following Engler's most dramatic welfare reform: terminating the state's General Assistance (GA) program. Until October 1991, the GA program had provided about $240 million annually to childless, able-bodied, nonworking adults. Critics charged that without assistance, many of these individuals would become homeless. State officials wanted an inexpensive but effective initiative to prepare for such a contingency.<p>	The scale of this partnership is impressive. In the first year, the Army provided over 680,000 "nights of service" (a bed and a meal) to the state's homeless. The initial grant of $3 million has increased each year to reach $9.5 mi
llion in 1995. This works out to $10 per day per client and allows the Army a modest administrative overhead of 3 percent. From the time GA was terminated until March of this year, the Army and its subcontractors provided nearly 2.9 million nights of service to homeless individuals.<p>	From the state's perspective, this partnership has been, in the words of Rusty Hills, Engler's public-affairs director, "absolutely magnificent." In one fell swoop, Engler saved the taxpayers millions of dollars, dealt a significant blow to the entitlement culture, encouraged thousands of individuals to leave the dole and find jobs, and provided homeless people food and shelter far more cost-effectively than ever before. Despite the increase in homelessness that followed the GA cuts, state officials say, the Army and its subcontractors have risen to the challenge. Shirley Nowakowski, the director of energy, housing, and emergency programs for Michigan's DSS, says the Salvation Army partnership is a success because "everyone who wants a bed has a bed." Jerry Miller, the state's director of social services, agrees, noting that the Salvation Army is providing services far more cheaply than the state could.<p>	Leonard Krugel, the Army's director of divisional services and the point man in the Army's contract with the state, is also pleased with the collaboration. He explains that the Army would have had to confront an increased homeless population anyway, and having state dollars helped pay the bills. More importantly, Krugel argues that the partnership has provided the Army "regulatory relief." <p>	For example, city officials in Detroit recently passed a new ordinance requiring homeless shelters to provide, among other things, dietitian-approved menus, quiet study rooms for schoolchildren, and expensive fire-suppression sprinkler systems. The ordinance already has put some private shelter operators out of business, and critics say the regulations are excessive and unrealistic. But for the Army, Krugel explains, "all of [these reg
ulations] are outside the sphere of this contract."Just Send the Checks?<p>	Former Army staffers and outside observers, however, are less sanguine about the partnership. The Army has a long history of providing emergency shelter. But it also knows a lot about how to help the homeless break the cycle of dependency. Salvation Army chapters in Michigan offer drug rehabilitation programs, educational services, and job-training seminars. Nearly every Army center has a chapel on site, and Bible study classes and spiritual support groups are common. <p>   The state contract, however, is limited to emergency services only. It includes neither the practical nor spiritual functions that have distinguished the Army over the years. With state-supplied funds, the Army subcontracts with shelters and certifies that they meet minimum standards of health and safety and provide the basic services of food and shelter. The Army neither provides consulting services to the subcontracting shelters nor assists them in designing programs to serve the homeless. It simply acts as a conduit for state funds, distributing money to 116 shelters (including religion-based ones) throughout the state.<p>	The contract represents an enormous missed opportunity. On the one hand, state officials seemed to focus nearly exclusively on the cost effectiveness of turning over care of the homeless to the Army. On the other hand, Army staffers failed to insist that their emphasis on moral renewal be implemented in participating shelters.<p> 	"The Salvation Army has taken a very myopic approach to its role, that of being a fiduciary -- not a program monitor, just a 'pass through,'" says Dan Piepszowski, the Army's former director of social services in eastern Michigan who is now with the Catholic Archdiocese of Detroit. "I don't think the Army was able to fully integrate their church ministry agenda into the operation of the contract." Piepszowski says, for example, that there has been no clear ministerial role for core officers -- the heart of the Arm
y's religious leadership -- at the shelters. <p>	"They've got to figure out who they are in this collaboration," Piepszowski says. "Do we want to send the checks or do we want to work our magic? They've opted to send the checks."<p>	It appears that the Michigan DSS also had a too-limited vision of what it wanted out of the partnership. Leonard Krugel, for example, does not know why the state chose to work with the Army rather than some other entity. When asked the same question, Shirley Nowakowski of the DSS said that the state selected the Army because it has corporate offices in several Michigan counties. She seemed unaware that the Army, as a religion-based provider, might address moral and behavioral problems underlying chronic homelessness more effectively than typical secular programs. Neither did state welfare director Jerry Miller. He said the fact that the Army is a religious organization never entered his thinking. Rather, according to these officials, they wanted to ensure that every Michigan citizen who needed emergency shelter would get it -- and they believed the Salvation Army could deliver.<p>	Sam Chambers, the director of social services in Wayne County (which includes Detroit), complains that the state was never interested in a genuine partnership in which the Army could pursue its holistic approach to homelessness. "Case planning wasn't part of [the partnership]. Rebuilding people's lives wasn't part of it. . . . All that was bought by the state was direct emergency services -- a 'cot and a hot.'" Critics say the Army's involvement is not helping Michigan transform homeless individuals into productive citizens, but is simply feeding and sheltering a dependent homeless population more efficiently. All that has changed, they maintain, is who signs the checks for the individual shelters.<p><b>The Dole and the Soul</b><p>The drawbacks of state funding go deeper than the loss to welfare recipients of the benefits of a spiritual ministry. The nonprofits themselves risk losing their unique cap
acity to help the needy. For example, a nonprofit's credibility in the eyes of its beneficiaries may be tainted by its association with state agencies. Rev. Eddie Edwards, who oversees a community-development organization in east Detroit called Joy of Jesus, explains: "When we are working with people in the community, helping them become self-sufficient, helping them get off welfare, it would be extremely difficult to tell them to get off welfare if we were on some kind of public assistance."<p>	Other problems, though, exist largely because of the way public-private partnerships are now conducted. The impact of public funds on REACH, Inc., another church-based ministry in Michigan, illustrates several pitfalls into which such groups can stumble.<p>	REACH began as the brainchild of several lay members of Detroit's 12th Street Baptist Church, who started an outreach to senior citizens in the surrounding neighborhood. The group established a day-care center, purchased and rehabilitated crack houses, and even opened up a local restaurant. Rev. Lee Earl pastored the church, and REACH's offices were housed in the church building. As the group's vision for community renewal expanded, some members wanted to pursue government funding. In its early years, church members and private companies had financed the ministry's work. Earl says he was not sure that "the benefits of government funding outweighed the challenges," but his was a minority voice. <p>	In the early 1990s, the church won grants from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, the Small Business Administration, and the city government to expand its housing-redevelopment efforts and small-business training. But with the dollars came headaches. For one thing, bureaucratic sluggishness delayed their redevelopment program. Earl describes how government bureaucrats held up the processing of contracts because they lacked computer skills. "Their turnaround time might be a month and your turnaround might be a day," Earl says. "But you've got to move by
 their timetable." <p>	Local government officials overseeing REACH's work also lacked "street sense," Earl says. When REACH rehabilitated homes with private money, it negotiated only with the city's building authority. "The building authority was flexible to the realities of rehabbing," he says. "For example, the houses have to have gutters and doors and other parts made of aluminum. But you can't put that stuff on until the house has people in it, because the crack heads will steal the aluminum and sell it for drugs." Building authorities typically approved the inspection as long as the materials were purchased and ready to be put on. Once the home was approved, the family could move in, and church volunteers put on the aluminum within 24 hours. <p>	Once REACH received local, state, and federal funds, other agencies, including the community development department, assumed various responsibilities for oversight. According to Earl, the officials there did not understand the realities of rehabilitation in the inner-city. "They wanted [the aluminum] on the house before they would even come out and inspect it," Earl says. "They said, 'Put it on the house and we'll be out within seven working days.' Well, it wouldn't stay on the house for seven working hours!"<p><b>Up Close and Impersonal</b><p>	One attraction of religion-based social-service groups is that they tend to be more personable than their secular counterparts. Workers in the religion-based providers often come from the local neighborhood and can relate well to clients. Moreover, ministry staff are often volunteers or are underpaid; they are there because they view their work as a calling rather than a job. Nearly everyone in social service agrees that a friendly, supportive environment stimulates improvements in behavior among welfare recipients. Consequently, the "impersonalization" or "bureaucratization" of a ministry can severely undercut its effectiveness.<p>	The process of "impersonalization" unfolds in a variety of ways. Ministries complain th
at government funding brings enormous paperwork that steals time away from face-to-face ministry. In addition, government often dictates that groups receiving public funds hire only staffers with specific educational degrees, such as a masters of social work (M.S.W.), or with certification in professional substance-abuse counseling programs. Such "professionalization" can undermine the informal, relational style that once prevailed between staff and recipients of care.<p>	"Part of the criticism of us now is that we're too professional, too polished; that we can't relate to the things that [local residents] are going through," says Linda Smith, a REACH staff member since its inception. In the organization's early years, says former executive director Charlene Johnson, about 70 to 100 volunteers participated in various aspects of the ministry. Today, REACH's office "volunteers" number three -- all from the federally funded Americorps program. REACH's current director, Pamela Martin Turner, says the organization is "developing personnel policies, formalized job descriptions with job titles and salary ranges, and other things that happen when you become more bureaucratic."<p>	Gary Bayer, who used to oversee a Detroit homeless shelter serving substance abusers, argues that ex-clients who have overcome their addictions make some of the best employees. They have walked the same streets as the drug abusers they now serve; they have the authority to challenge them, and teach them how to get off drugs and stay off them. But under the government's credentialing requirements, such "homegrown" leaders often aren't eligible for employment as counselors.<p>	While credentialing requirements are appropriate in certain kinds of social-service work (no one wants volunteer "doctors" providing them medical care), they may be unnecessary elsewhere. In Detroit, DSS director Sam Chambers and his friends in the religious social-service sector are trying to design more creative programs with a greater role for paraprofessionals and v
olunteers. Unfortunately, such collaboration seems to be exceptional.<p><b>Organizational Drift</b><p>	At its heart, a religion-based service provider aims to transform lives. Such a goal can be difficult to measure by objective, quantitative data. That's why program leaders, when conferring with supporters in the private sector, typically tell stories. Progress in personal transformation is often judged by such things as changed language, faithful attendance in education/training programs, increased punctuality and personal responsibility, willingness to work, improved social relations with staff, reaffiliation with family, avoidance of drugs, commitment to financial accountability, greater reliability, and increasing initiative and enthusiasm. These often intangible and "qualitative" changes are the very ones credited with permanent socioeconomic improvement. <p>	Government, by contrast, focuses on objective statistics, usually to measure the number of commodities provided to a needy person or neighborhood. Consequently, nonprofits receiving government funds start counting numbers and recording statistics. And to ensure continued receipt of state dollars, they may start investing more effort in programs that produce easily quantifiable results rather than in holistic ministry that produces qualitative change.<p>	REACH's Linda Smith reports that the tone of the group's programs has changed. Before receiving major government grants, the ministry emphasized "human development," with great attention to moral and spiritual matters. "Our experience showed that if we didn't do this, we could move people into a house, but they'd trash it and not make the mortgage payments," says former director Johnson. Now the ministry's help is more "commodified" (providing people material goods such as houses) and its work is more project-oriented than relationship-oriented. Under Johnson's tenure, the ministry's largest annual budget was $1 million, distributed across youth, family, and economic-development programs. Today, 
the thrust of REACH's energy is on housing rehabilitation and construction, programs for which they can obtain major federal and state grants. REACH recently secured a $1.7 million grant for a major housing initiative.<p>
"Government funding will not realistically finance your Christian, holistic, or evangelistic purpose. You can't use it for that," says Virgil Gulker, a guru of the religion-based service community who has founded numerous projects in Michigan for the poor. "So you end up evaluating quantitative things -- how many houses did you build, how many meals did you serve, how many jobs did you find -- that will have no impact on your organization's original purposes, other than to diminish that original purpose or mission."<p>
<b>Secularization</b><p>	Gulker's insights touch on the crux of the issue of government funding of religion-based providers: the potential danger of secularization. REACH's current executive director, Pamela Martin Turner, admits quite openly that REACH has "evolved into a more secular, more ecumenical organization than in past years. . . . To some large extent, the work of the past was primarily based on faith, on a commitment to spiritual and religious values. Whereas now, on the staff level, there may be some internal spiritual value that compels people to come to work, but that's not the explicit understanding. People come to work because it's their job and they're expected to do a good job."<p>	The de-emphasis on the spiritual comes with a cost: REACH staffers are less likely to bring their religious convictions to bear in addressing, confronting, and meeting the needs of the needy. "We do not talk about the spiritual needs at all," says Smith. "When we worked out of the church, I knew every day, without a doubt, why I was there." Now, she says, "some days I come to work and people come in and I feel like I can't help them because they need more than to just talk about putting them in a house. It's a struggle for me."<p>	People of faith, of course, are concerned about the threat of secularization. But others ought to be worried as well, for the dilution of a ministry's religious distinctiveness may remove the very element that makes it so effective in addressing social problems. <p>	Even ministries known for their spiritually integrated approach are susceptible. The Detroit-based Joy of Jesus accepts no government funding, but financial problems led it to incorporate a separate, not explicitly religious, nonprofit partner organization called R-3 that solicits state funds. These are used principally in the organization's housing-redevelopment program. The ministry also moved its job training program to R-3 because private donations were insufficient to maintain it. Instructor Kevin Feldman reports that 
he used to integrate biblical principles in the training curriculum and pray with his students, but had to stop once the organization received government funding. In Feldman's view, the result has been that "our success rate has dramatically declined." Fewer individuals are completing the program and fewer are finding and retaining jobs. <P>	After reviewing this ledger of potential pitfalls, some faith-based groups in Michigan have decided that accepting government funds is too risky. "In general, there's a need for collaborative effort between the public and private sectors," says Joel Samy of American Family Hope, a Michigan nonprofit that helps the working poor. "But it's in the best interests of a church-based ministry to have minimal involvement with government at the funding level." Like Virgil Gulker and others, Samy worries that religion-based providers will exchange their original mission -- with its emphasis on spiritual awakeningfor a governmental agenda. <p><b>Exceptions to the Rule</b><p>	Although the problems afflicting religious nonprofits in their collaboration with the state of Michigan are serious, they do not seem to be inevitable. Some religious agencies have been able to work with government entities, accept tax dollars, and avoid the pitfalls identified above. If Michigan builds on these successful examples of collaboration rather than replicating its faulty models, then Engler's goal of transforming lives by cooperating with nonprofits in social welfare could be advanced.<p>	Detroit Rescue Mission Ministries (DRMM) provides substance-abuse programs and emergency shelter for homeless men and women. It enjoys excellent relations with Wayne County's Sam Chambers and has collaborated for decades with the county department of social services. Chambers has established a community-wide planning board, including several religion-based providers, to discuss policy. Chambers welcomes input from the religious nonprofits. These groups, he explains, are closer to the needs, more "user-friendly,"
 and less bureaucratic and intimidating. Noting that Detroit has 4,000 churches but only 33 welfare offices, Chambers says it is obvious he can meet needs more effectively by tapping into the religious sector. Such groups "do a better job because they tend to treat the whole man," he says.<p>	Aware of the church-state issues involved, Chambers says his evaluations of the religious nonprofits his department works with are "outcome-based." His office enforces health and safety regulations and conducts financial audits, but does not interfere with ministries' internal policies and procedures. There is no attempt to force groups to change their holistic approach or extirpate their religious sensibilities. Chambers says he works with DRMM because the ministry's track record is stellar: It has helped turn around the lives of some of the toughest clients in the welfare system.<p>	This partnership works not only because the approach Chambers takes is one of genuine, respectful, and pragmatic collaboration, but also because DRMM has a clear vision for its ministry and strong leadership. Its president, Don DeVos, says he'll refuse any government grant that compromises the ministry's commitment to holistic ministry. So far, it seems, he has.<p>	In Grand Rapids, Bethany Christian Services works with the Kent County Department of Social Services to provide foster care for at-risk children and residential care for abused and neglected children and juvenile sexual offenders. Its relationship with government is, like DRMM's, cordial and long-standing. John Cole, the program manager for the local DSS, is the ministry's principal government contact. Like Chambers, Cole takes a results-oriented and respectful approach to the partnership. Cole says he "doesn't implement any policy without first developing it in draft form and asking the private groups what they think about it." His staff meets with BCS staff monthly, and he meets personally with BCS leaders quarterly to discuss policy design and implementation. <p>	Unfortunate
ly, according to Cole, this kind of genuine and broad-based collaboration is rare in Michigan. He says that, despite the governor's strong support for privatization, most county welfare offices are biased against purchasing welfare services from private nonprofits. Because of the entrenched state bureaucracy, Cole explains, "There's a preference for county departments to provide their own services." And even when local welfare departments do purchase services from nonprofits, they do not do so as part of a broad, genuine, partnership. "They may purchase services but I don't think they really believe that that's the way they ought to go. I've been in meetings where they [government officials] are very critical of the [private] agencies," Cole says. And at the state level, he says, "the arrangements are very much businesslike and one-sided," even "adversarial" at times.<p><b>Redefining the Relationship</b><p>	Some of the most fruitful state collaborations with religion-based social welfare groups in Michigan appear to rest largely on the goodwill of certain government officials who treat nonprofits as equals and are more interested in enabling religiously based organizations to transform lives than they are in rigorously enforcing a church-state divide. This is a shaky foundation for the partnerships, since such individuals could be replaced by less sympathetic officials. Clearly, a stronger foundation for public-private partnerships is needed. And it must be built soon, before, in our zeal for welfare reform and "devolution," a whole superstructure of arrangements between government and nonprofits is erected. <p>	Some religiously rooted groups will, of course, continue to avoid any involvement with state contracts as they offer help to the needy, and their effectiveness bolsters the case for others to do likewise. But some ministries believe that relying on public funds through state and federal agencies is desirable and potentially beneficial. My investigation into private non-profits in Michigan suggests s
everal steps that both government and faith-based providers could take to guard the integrity of groups that seek out government grants and contracts.<p>	To start, state lawmakers and agency officials need to listen more attentively to the good Samaritans on the front lines. When big government imperiously issues decrees from on high, its private "partners" bust their budgets trying to conform. Genuine collaboration would mean, at best, that ministries would have some say in designing the regulations. Or, at least, that government entities would allow their grassroots partners flexibility in achieving the intentions of the regulations, if not the letter of the law. Otherwise, "working together" means that ministries accomplish less with the "help" they receive from government than they would have in the absence of a state contract.<p>	Politicians must redefine "public-private partnership" to go beyond the "delivery system" model, which is principally concerned with saving money, not transforming lives. In this model, the state decides what services will be offered and then pays private groups to deliver them. Some recent initiatives by Engler suggest he is on the right track. For example, Engler's "Clergy Summit" in October shows an awareness not only of the cost-effectiveness of outreach by the religious community, but also of that community's moral authority in low-income neighborhoods. At the meeting, state officials are expected to solicit the help of pastors in publicizing welfare services. Says an Engler spokesman, "If we can tap into the moral authority and trust that the pastors have, we are much more likely to reach people than if we just hope that some bureaucratic edict from the impersonal state government is suddenly going to make things happen." Absolutely right.<p>	In addition, state officials are now discussing how to broaden their arrangement with the Salvation Army. Social service director Jerry Miller says the state now recognizes the partnership should go beyond the provision of emergency 
services: "We need to work to get [the homeless] into transitional housing" -- and, eventually, permanently off the streets. It remains to be seen whether the Army can conduct this additional work in a way that takes full advantage of its strengths as a religion-based provider of social services.<p>	The Engler administration can go even further. It can hold up the work of officials like Sam Chambers and John Cole as examples of a smart way to develop genuine, effective partnerships with religious organizations. It's not enough for Engler to praise collaboration with these nonprofits. His administration must clearly define the kind of collaboration that is desirable -- and it should look more like the partnership between Wayne County and the Detroit Rescue Mission than the current partnership between Lansing and the Salvation Army.<p>Finally, government officials must acknowledge the value of a religion-based, holistic approach to serving the needy, and take the necessary actions to ensure that ministries agreeing to work with the state do not thereby stumble into the traps discussed. The government welfare system has failed, not only because it is a poor deliverer of the standard package of welfare benefits, but because the package itself is flawed. Cash and commodities are not the things that transform poor people's lives. Religious welfare providers have a better record in changing lives not only because they deliver services more effectively, but because their services are different. They provide "goods" like love, emotional support, spiritual instruction, trust, accountability, moral authority, hope, character training, and basic life skillsall in the context of personal relationships with the poor. They suffer with and walk alongside needy people until those people are able to walk out of the underclass.<p>	Any arrangement with state agencies that fails to give this level of autonomy to religiously grounded outreach efforts may serve the interests of government bureaucrats or certain activists for the 
poor. But it will not, in the long run, help the needy to help themselves.<p><b>AMY L. SHERMAN</B>, <i>a visiting fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center, is writing a book on urban ministry</i>.

John, 10, is one of America's children who waits. He waits for
a home, and he has been waiting nearly all of his life. When John
was a toddler, his drug-addicted mom lost her parental rights,
and claimed not to know who the father was. John has been legally
free to be adopted since he was three, but instead has lived in
state-run foster homes and group homes. While his childhood slips
away, John's social workers debate his best interests and the
programs they hope will address them. But this skinny kid who
loves baseball knows better: &quot;I'm all wrapped up in programs,&quot;
he says. &quot;What I need is a mom.&quot;  

<P>Across the country,
there are 50,000 foster children like John, who no longer live
with their mother or father and have been declared by courts as
free to be adopted, but who languish for months or years in state-run,
state-funded substitute care. On any given day, nearly 400,000
other children-none of them eligible for adoption-can be found
in government foster homes, group homes, and shelters. Many of
them are kept there by absentee parents clinging to the legal rights
to their children. 

<P>Foster care and adoption in America have sunk
to a state of near-catastrophe. 

<P>
According to the American Public
Welfare Association, the population of children in substitute
care is growing 33 times faster than the U.S. child population
in general. During each of the past 10 years, more children have
entered the system than exited. Every year, 15,000 children &quot;graduate&quot;
from foster care by turning 18 with no permanent family; 40 percent
of all foster children leaving the system end up on welfare, according
to the American Civil Liberties Union.  

<P>
What was for most of America's
history an entirely private endeavor has become a massive, inefficient
government system. State agencies consistently fail to recruit
enough families for the children eligible for adoption every year;
potential parents often are turned down because of racial considerations,
or turned off by protracted and unnecessary waiting periods; cumbersome
state regulations extend to private adoption agencies and can
even prohibit private attorneys from handling adoptions. The result
is that tens of thousands of children are now free to be adopted
but have nowhere to go. 

<P>
This is the dirty little secret of the
welfare state: Every child is adoptable, and there are waiting
lists of families ready to take in even the most emotionally troubled
and physically handicapped children. Government adoption policies
are utterly failing in their most basic purpose-to quickly place
children who are free to be adopted into permanent homes. 

<P>
The
problem lies not with the children. What keeps kids like John
bound to state care are the tentacles of a bureaucratic leviathan:
a public funding scheme that rewards and extends poor-quality
foster care; an anti-adoption bias that creates numerous legal
and regulatory barriers; and a culture of victimization that places
the whims of irresponsible parents above the well-being of their
children. 

<P>
I can identify with these kids. I was a foster child
in a family that cared for 110 children. That family-my family-adopted
me in the early 1970s. Years later, as a student at Harvard, I
happened upon a book of statistics on children in state care.
I was stunned to learn that decades of research, policymaking,
and government funding had only intensified the system's failures.
I was one of the lucky ones, but luck will not stem the tide of
parentless children. By the year 2000, well over a million children
will enter foster care, and tens of thousands of kids will become
eligible for adoption. Unless the government apparatus of foster
care and adoption is dismantled, these children could spend their
childhoods wishing for what most people take for granted: stability,
a family that will last longer than a few months, a last name.

<P><CENTER><B>Subsidizing</B></CENTER><BR>
Failure For years the rallying cry of many children's activists
has been: &quot;More money!&quot; The National Commission on Family
Foster Care, convened by the Child Welfare League of America,
says that &quot;family foster care and other child welfare services
have never been given the resources necessary&quot; to meet federal
standards, and calls for a &quot;fully funded array of child and
family welfare services.&quot; When it comes to child welfare,
rare is the research article that does not call for more money
and further research. 

<P>
America already is spending $10 billion
a year on foster care and adoption services through public agencies.
Federal dollars now account for nearly a third of all foster care
funding, with most of the rest coming from state coffers. California
alone spends at least $635 million a year on substitute care;
the District of Columbia spent $53 million last year on a system
that was so poorly run it recently was taken over by a federal
court. 

<P>
According to the ACLU, a year in foster care costs about
$17,500 per child, including per-child payments to foster families
and administrative costs of child welfare agencies. That does
not include counseling and treatment programs for biological parents
or foster parent recruitment and training. The <I>San Francisco
Chronicle</I> reports that per-child costs for foster home or
group home care have increased more than fourfold in the past
decade. 

<P>
The problem with foster care is not the level of government
spending, it is the structure of that spending. The funding system
gives child-welfare bureaucracies incentives to keep even free-to-be-adopted
kids in state care. State-social-service agencies are neither
rewarded for helping children find adoptive homes nor penalized
for failing to do so in a reasonable amount of time. There is
no financial incentive to recruit adoptive families. And as more
children enter the system, so does the tax money to support them
in substitute care.  

<P>
By contrast, private adoption agencies are
paid to find suitable families quickly, even if it means going
out of state. The public social-service bureaucracy, nearly overwhelmed
by other urban problems, has little to gain by devoting extra
resources to adoption. Private adoption agencies are free to focus
on finding homes for kids and are financially motivated to do
so. Private adoption agencies are paid according to the number
of successful placements; public agencies, in a sense, are paid
for the number of children they prevent from being adopted. 

<P>
There
is a similar reward for foster parents to keep kids in state care.
By law, adoption subsidies cannot exceed foster care payments,
and in practice they are almost always lower. According to the
National Foster Parent Association, foster families in 1993 received
anywhere from $200 to $530 a month for each child under age 10,
plus additional money from states and counties. The subsidies
are tax free, and foster parents receive more money as the children
under their care get older. So the longer the system fails to
find permanent homes for kids, the more money flows to those fostering.


<P>
In some states, payments to foster parents caring for four kids
equal the after-tax income of a $35,000-a-year job. The money
is tax free. It doesn't take much imagination to see that paying
people to parent can lead to mischief. Parents are not held accountable
for how they spend their federal and state allocations; for too
many foster parents, the children in their homes are reduced to
mere income streams. If foster parents don't wish to adopt the
children under their care, what incentive do they have to alert
other parents hoping to adopt?  

<P>
Let me be very clear: There are
many dedicated and compassionate people in the foster care system,
serving as case workers, counselors, and foster parents. My own
experience in foster care was a positive one. But I have seen
and heard of too many that were heartbreaking failures.

<P><CENTER><B>Special-Needs
Stigma</B></CENTER><BR>
I have heard perhaps a thousand times that the children
who wait cannot be adopted because they have &quot;special needs.&quot;
Of course they do-they need parents. They require love and nurturing
that endures. But the &quot;special needs&quot; referred to by
advocates come with federal dollars attached. In 1980, Congress
started offering states matching funds to assist the adoption
of children with special needs, which included children of various
ages, ethnic backgrounds, and those with severe mental and physical
handicaps who may require expensive care. The subsidy was to become
available only after a state determined that it could not reasonably
expect to place a child without it. 

<P>
As with so many other federal
subsidies, states quickly expanded their slice of the government
pie by broadening the criteria for receiving money. Today, nearly
two- thirds of all foster children qualify. In some states, special-needs
children include kids who have a sibling; are black, biracial,
Hispanic, or Native American; are &quot;older,&quot; as defined
by the state; or have been in foster care longer than 18 months.


<P>
Two leading adoption organizations report that there are no national
figures available that break down the type of need, or indicate
the number of children who have physical or emotional handicaps
that would require extra expenses by their new parents. This leaves
the door wide open to all sorts of graft and fiscal abuse.  

<P>But
there are other unintended and unconscionable consequences of
this masquerade. One is that the needs of very vulnerable children
are downplayed. The plight of a teen-age girl in a wheelchair
who requires constant attention is trivialized when she is included
in the same group as children whose &quot;needs&quot; are that
they are eight years old. Another result-one I see often-is that
local social-services departments discourage families from adopting
by telling them, &quot;Oh, these kids aren't for you. We only
have <I>special-needs</I> children.&quot; This emphasis on kids
with the most challenging emotional and physical handicaps unwittingly
contributes to the false notion that foster children are &quot;unadoptable.&quot;
Ironically, the Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980
that established special-needs matching funds warned that children
must not be &quot;routinely classified as 'hard-to-place.'&quot;
Government funding has had just that effect, and it is helping
to delay the placement of children ready for adoption.  

<P>
I am convinced
that the entire incentive structure for foster care and public
agency adoption helps perpetuate the system's failure. It is a
failure rooted in the notion that government funding is the panacea
for family disintegration. The National Commission on Family Foster
Care claims the foster care crisis is &quot;the logical result
of two decades of national neglect in providing funding and services
for children, youths, and their families.&quot; On the contrary,
as long as these children come with tax money attached-with little
in the way of accountability-those invested in perpetuating the
system will do little to reform it. As one foster child put it:
&quot;Everywhere I go, somebody gets money to keep me from having
a mom and dad.&quot;

<P>
<CENTER><B>Anti-Adoption Bias</B></CENTER><BR>  
Government funding schemes
and inefficiencies that prevent adoption exist within a larger
framework: a steadily growing bias against adoption. Despite all
the sociological evidence of the benefits of adoption, the conviction
that a child does best in a permanent, loving, and stable home
is all but missing from the ethos of state-run substitute care.
How can this be? 

<P>
In both the popular and elite media, a deep suspicion
of adoption is all too evident. Marvin Olasky, a professor at
the University of Texas at Austin, has noted that a New York Times
series on adoption included such headlines as &quot;The Ties that
Traumatize&quot; and &quot;Adoption is Getting Some Harder Looks.&quot;
And what do <I>Playboy</I>, <I>Mirabella</I>, and <I>Good Housekeeping
</I>have in common? As Olasky says, each has joined the offensive
with an article that warns readers against the &quot;distasteful
&#133; bartering of lives&quot; that supposedly is adoption. 

<P>
Television
writers would have us believe that adoption has no happy endings.
TV portrays adoption as shady, risky, and shameful. Over the last
year, a dozen programs featured adoption in their plots, and in
every case the adoption agency was depicted as callously profit-driven.
The adopting families were white, middle-class couples who kept
secrets from the authorities or from each other. Birth mothers
were unfairly portrayed as selfish or disturbed. The programs
paid little attention to the well-being of the children. 

<P>
Groups
such as Concerned United Birthparents (CUB) help give legal expression
to this bias. CUB was behind the &quot;Baby Jessica&quot; case
that led to the removal of a two-year-old from her adoptive family.
Groups like CUB claim that adoption is a feminist issue, that
only the outmoded ideal of a two-parent family makes the notion
of adoption palatable. As Olasky notes, Joss Sawyer's book <I>Death
by Adoption</I> calls adoption &quot;a violent act, a political
act of aggression toward a woman.&quot; 

<P>
Perhaps more significant,
however, is the battle against transracial adoption that has been
waged by the National Association of Black Social Workers (NABSW)
for more than two decades. Its 1972 position paper reads: &quot;Black
children belong physically, psychologically, and culturally in
Black families in order that they receive the total sense of themselves.&quot;
Otherwise, the group claims, black children &quot;will not have
the background and knowledge which is necessary to survive in
a racist society.&quot; Our institute has received letters from
adoptive families in many states who have been barred from adopting
transracially. According to the North American Council on Adoptable
Children, state adoption laws may allow for race-matching, but
 &quot;their preferencing policy isn't written down.&quot; 
 
<P>When
it comes to transracial adoptions, there is no longer much doubt
that current policies are bringing the greatest harm to the very
community they were intended to help: African Americans. Just
consider the numbers: Though black families adopt at very high
rates, black children represent nearly half of foster kids waiting
to be adopted. Fifteen percent of all children in America are
black; but 40 percent of the children in foster care are black.
State delays in finding homes for black children, as case workers
search for &quot;culturally consistent&quot; placements, can keep
kids languishing in state care for years. 

<P>
&quot;These policies
are seriously harmful to black children, requiring that black
kids who could get good homes be left in foster care,&quot; Harvard
law professor Elizabeth Bartholet told the <I>New York Times</I>.
&quot;There is not an iota of evidence in all the empirical studies
that transracial adoption does any harm at all.&#133;There is
plenty of evidence that delay in adoption does do harm.&quot;


<P>
Such policies reveal a profound misunderstanding of the nature
and effects of adoption. To insist that successful adoption means
placing a child in a family of his  racial or ethnic heritage
is to overlook what every adopted child understands intuitively:
Adoption is not easy. No matter how much a child's family looks
like him, it does not alter the fact that someone gave him up.
Having the same skin color as the people in his household doesn't
automatically erase that. Only love does. As someone who grew
up in a multi-ethnic family, I find it incomprehensible when people
tell me that I cannot love my siblings the way I could if our
skin color matched.

<P>
<CENTER><B>The Fallout</B></CENTER><BR>  
Attitudes against adoption, whether
racially motivated or not, share at least two flaws. First, they
ignore all the best evidence indicating that adoption leads to
positive outcomes for kids. Last year, the Search Institute of
Minneapolis released the largest study ever of adopted adolescents
and their families (see table above). The study, in which 881
adopted children and 1,262 adoptive parents were surveyed, found
that children who were adopted fared as well as or better than
a national sample of non-adopted adolescents in self-esteem, mental
health, school achievement-even the amount of time spent each
week helping others. Adopted adolescents were more likely to agree
or strongly agree with the statement &quot;There is a lot of love
in my family&quot; than were non-adopted children. 

<P>
Sociological
studies of transracial adoptions are equally encouraging. Rita
Simon of American University has conducted a 20-year longitudinal
study of transracial adoption. She found that such adoptions cause
none of the problems alleged by the NABSW. Rather, black children
adopted into white families typically &quot;grow up with a positive
sense of their black identity and a knowledge of their history
and culture.&quot; And such children, Simon says, often possess
&quot;special interpersonal talents and skills at bridging cultures.&quot;


<P>
Second, the anti-adoption movement fortifies the legal and bureaucratic
obstacles that are keeping children from finding permanent homes.
There are numerous state laws that needlessly complicate or block
the process. In Minnesota, for example, if filing deadlines and
other technical requirements of state adoption law are not precisely
met, parents can be prevented for months or years from finalizing
a child's adoption. Thanks to horror stories of baby-selling,
four states have laws that ban independent adoptions (though exceptions
are permitted). Despite this, more than 45,000 adoptions in 1992
were conducted through private agencies or independent agents-the
vast majority of them successfully. 

<P>
My office receives numerous
letters from people eager to adopt but frustrated by laws and
bureaucrats. One woman recently wrote: &quot;My husband and I
decided we would like to adopt a little girl, thinking we had
a lot of love, nurturing, and stability to give a child who had
been abandoned or abused. Almost immediately I hit a brick wall.&quot;
Her local department of social services-in a state with more than
5,000 foster children free to be adopted-told her it was &quot;not
taking new cases&quot; of families willing to adopt foster children.
A couple wrote that of their three adopted children, &quot;two
[had] lingered in foster care, one of whom we were not able to
adopt until he was age 18.&quot; 

<P>
<CENTER><B>Adoptable You</B></CENTER><BR>  
There is at least
one other mistaken notion that feeds the legal and cultural bias
against adoption-the idea that many of the children in foster
care are simply not adoptable. My own experience suggests otherwise,
as I was an older child when my foster parents adopted me. And
my experience with parents in and outside the foster care system
tells me that every child is adoptable. 

<P>
For every child who is
ready for a permanent home, there are families waiting. It is
time to shatter the myth that adoptive parents are interested
only in &quot;healthy white babies.&quot; There are waiting lists
to adopt white children, black children, Hispanic children, infants
and teens, children with Down's syndrome and with AIDS. Private
agencies for years have found families for all types of children.
Adopt a Special Kid, a California-based service, receives more
than 1,500 inquiries annually from families interested in adopting
children with disabilities. The National Adoption Center maintains
a computerized listing of 650 qualified families waiting to embrace
disabled &quot;older&quot; children. The center reports that infants,
even the most severely disabled, are adopted almost immediately.


<P>
Outside of the thousands of families who have successfully completed
home studies and have registered with with their states, there
are no hard figures for the number of parents able and willing
to adopt. Certainly there are families who would come forward
if public agencies recruited more aggressively. Beginning in November,
1993, Massachusetts stepped up its recruitment efforts with public-service
announcements, an aggressive media campaign, adoption &quot;open
houses,&quot; and community-based recruitment. Such efforts helped
increase foster child adoptions by 47 percent in one year. 

<P>
Most
people know someone who has gone to heroic lengths to adopt. Americans
adopted more than 7,300 children from other countries in 1993,
according to the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service.
The INS estimates that the 1994 figure exceeds 8,000. Others have
spent their life savings to offer permanence to a child; domestic
adoption through private agencies or independent attorneys can
cost more than $30,000. It is not unusual for foster parents to
adopt two, five, or even 10 children under their care. Clearly,
the barriers to adoption are neither the characteristics of children
who wait nor the parents who want to care for them.

<P>
<CENTER><B>The Route toFoster Care</B></CENTER><BR>
In addition to the 50,000 children who today are
legally free to be adopted, there are hundreds of thousands more
who drift for days, months, or years within the state-run system-a
system that too often guarantees a parentless future for some
of society's most vulnerable members. 

<P>
Children enter foster care
for a variety of reasons. Mom abuses or neglects one of her kids,
dad is using drugs or is arrested for a felony, or perhaps the
parents are just having a hard time coping with the responsibilities
of parenthood. The American Public Welfare Association reports
that 70 percent of foster children enter the system because of
abuse, neglect, or &quot;parental conditions&quot;-including drug
addiction, incarceration, illness, or death. More than 600,000
kids will spend all or part of 1995 in substitute care, up from
434,000 in 1982. 

<P>
A profile of children in state care belies the
stigma that foster children are mostly &quot;unadoptable&quot;
troubled teens. Researchers at the Chapin Hall Center for Children
at the University of Chicago studied five states whose foster
care children make up about half of the U.S. foster care population.
They found that from 1990 to 1992, nearly 25 percent of all first
admissions to foster care were babies less than one year old.
Between 1983 and 1992, the proportion of 12- to 15-year-olds entering
substitute care in those states declined. The American Public
Welfare Association cites similar trends.   

<P>
Sadly, the youngest
children remain in the system the longest. The University of Chicago
study revealed that, after controlling for other factors, children
who enter foster care as infants remain in the system 22 percent
longer than other young children.  

<P>
The fact remains, however,
that foster care is failing children of all ages. The ACLU reports
that one in 10 foster children remains in state care longer than
7.4 years. At least 40,600 foster children have been in care for
five years or longer; another 51,300 have been in care between
three and five years. System kids, on average, live with three
different families, though 10 or more placements is not uncommon.
&quot;Every new placement is a loss,&quot; says Michael B. Pines,
a psychologist specializing in attachment disorders. &quot;The
result is that these kids begin not to trust anyone.&quot; 

<P>
<CENTER><B>Paidto Parent</B></CENTER><BR>
One of the reasons that foster care tends to ensnare
children in a legal and emotional limbo is that its bureaucracy
and incentive system attract parents who are unable or unwilling
to adopt or help find homes for the children in their care. 

<P>
Whether
adopting through private or public adoption agencies, would-be
parents must undergo a home study.  Private agencies, which must
successfully place children in homes to stay in business, are
free to set higher standards for parents than public agencies
do. Christian or other faith-based adoption agencies typically
emphasize tough standards of behavior. But this is not so for
state-run substitute care. In many states, adults who fail the
adoption home study get a consolation prize: They can become foster
parents. Deemed unworthy to serve as legal adoptive parents, these
adults are then paid handsomely to raise children in state care.

<P>
Foster homes, group homes, and public orphanages share another
vice: Their government money comes with regulations attached.
This often guarantees confusion and conflict. Private orphanages
always have been driven by a mission:  keep girls from getting
pregnant, keep children in school, expose children to the Christian
faith, and so on. They use a combination of rules and rewards,
discipline and love to fulfill their mission. Often, this isn't
allowed in a state-run group home, where it may be against the
law to hug a child, or to lock the door after midnight, or even
to advertise for a married couple to serve as housemasters.  

<P>
If
a permanent, loving family is the surest route to producing happy,
well-adjusted children, then what effect does the foster care
system, at its worst, have on countless kids? The result of the
system's delays, incentive structure, and regulatory grip is that
many former foster children ultimately remain dependent on state
services. They are wildly over-represented among welfare recipients,
the homeless, and in juvenile and adult prison populations. In
Los Angeles County, 39 percent of homeless youth are former foster
children. In New York, 23 percent of the homeless were once in
foster care; in Minneapolis, the figure is 38 percent. According
to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, former foster children make
up nearly 14 percent of America's prison population.

<P>
<CENTER><B>Culture ofVictimization</B></CENTER><BR>  

The financial disincentives to adoption and the
legal and societal biases against it do not exist in a vacuum;
they are rooted in the soil of victimization. More than half of
the children who enter foster care were abused or neglected in
their families of origin. But the current system grants &quot;victim
status&quot; to these parents. It often allows them to cling to
their parental rights as they move in and out of social service
programs. As a result, tens of thousands of children remain trapped
in foster care, never free to be adopted into stable, loving homes.


<P>
Take the case of Halie (not her real name), a two-year-old girl
who one day wouldn't eat her dinner. Her mother and mother's boyfriend
tied her to an electric heater. Hours passed, until Halie's face,
chest, and arm were disfigured. Her mother then threw her into
a cold shower, dressed her, and took her to a hospital-claiming
the child had spilled hot water on herself. After weeks of hospitalization,
Halie entered foster care. For the next 10 years, her biological
mother-coached by the local department of social services-maintained
her legal rights to the child. Case workers helped Halie's mom
to toe the official line to prove she somehow was still capable
as a parent: She married her boyfriend and had a child with him.


<P>
When Halie was 12, her case workers and a judge approved overnight
and extended visits between Halie and her biological mother. Halie's
mother rejected a judge's offer to regain custody. She didn't
want to raise Halie, but didn't want to let her go, and the state
gave her all the legal and financial help she needed. Halie spent
her teen years in group homes and foster homes. She turned 18
in foster care. 

<P>
Most states give biological parents every possible
chance to prove they are fit-while their babies grow up in state
care. A family recently wrote me about their two-year-old foster
daughter: &quot;She is precious beyond belief, and her parents
are being given chance upon chance to clean up their lives-at
her expense, as we see it. She is so adoptable by the right family,
but the system will keep her under lock and key for years if necessary
for her parents' benefit.&quot; 

<P>
In our social-work schools, counseling
centers, and government-funded research, the culture of victimization
insists that the most despicable behavior by abusive parents has
its causes in economics, racism, broken homes-anything but the
consciences and moral choices of men and women. We have devised
a foster care system that puts a vogue pop psychology ahead of
the well-being of children. This helps explain why roughly a third
of all the foster children who are reunited with their families
of origin soon return to state care. Indeed, it is the only explanation
for some of the bizarre attempts I have seen to reunite a foster
child with a parent who is clearly unwilling or unfit. 

<P>
Under federal
law, states cannot obtain federal funds for foster care unless
&quot;reasonable efforts&quot; are made to keep members of the
family of origin together (&quot;family preservation&quot;) or
to reunite the family ( &quot;family reunification&quot;). But
the federal government nowhere defines &quot;reasonable efforts,&quot;
and only a few states have specific statutes. It's a classic Catch-22:
Children are not free to be adopted until every reasonable effort
is made to return them to their biological parents. But almost
no one seems to know what constitutes a reasonable effort, that
is, what services must be offered to parents who need outside
help. 

<P>
When, for example, a public agency reports to a judge that
a mother has failed her drug-treatment program, the judge is likely
to insist that the mom enter every drug treatment program available.
So biological parents are given multiple chances to fail at parenting,
while children may bounce between state care and their family
of origin. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) admits
that the inability to meet &quot;reasonable efforts&quot; standards
is the primary barrier to foster child adoption. 

<P>
From my own experience
in foster care, the most difficult part was watching my brothers
and sisters return to biological parents who had burned or beaten
them, or put out cigarettes on their children's bottoms. I felt
like an accomplice. It must have been hard for my parents, who
could do nothing to stop it. 

<P>
Most foster parents, at one point
or another, must relinquish a child to a home situation that is
precarious. One foster mother of five years wrote: &quot;I have
been seriously reconsidering my position as a foster parent because
when we started this it was to try to help these children, and
I am finding out that I am not able to do that. The pain and heartbreak
of not being able to protect these children is a heavy burden
to bear.&quot; Until the system is reshaped, it is a burden that
every one of us carries.

<P>
<CENTER><B>Assignment: Adoption</B></CENTER><BR> 
It is one thing to
tolerate inefficiencies and bureaucratic delays in other areas
of public life-public toll roads, for example. Such inefficiencies
don't cost children 18 years of their lives. We do not need another
study, or blue-ribbon commission, or congressional subcommittee
hearing. When I was four years old, it didn't matter to me that
someone was getting a research grant to study the effects of foster
care on childhood development. What I wanted was a last name.


<P>
I am convinced that there are more parents willing to adopt than
there are children ready to be adopted. But the market for adoption
is frustrated by the regulatory system now in place. To create
a more efficient system, one with incentives to help rather than
abandon innocent children, we must get Big Government out of the
business of parenting. I do not mean we should create a market
in babies. I am not talking about baby-selling. I am talking about
serving babies and children by removing the barriers to their
enjoyment of stable, loving homes.  

<P>
Where parts of foster care
and adoption are privately run, competition and incentives have
led to better outcomes for children. In Michigan, where two-thirds
of foster care management is privatized, private providers spend
less per child, yet have achieved better social worker-to-child
ratios than those of state-run agencies. Adoption is, in fact,
the ultimate form of privatization: wresting authority over children's
lives from the state and allowing children to be free, to be raised
not by government but by parents.  

<P>
We must reform, state by state,
our system of transferring parental rights-from the government,
which can never be a parent, to parents who are eager and able
to bring these children into their hearts and lives. Congress
recently has taken interest in adoption reform by proposing a
$5,000 tax credit for adoptive parents. But will that tax credit
get children out of foster care more quickly? No. Does it stimulate
a market in private adoptions? No. Does it allow independent adoptions
in states where they are now outlawed? No. 

<P>
Tax credits might make
adoption a little easier for some parents, but they will not make
adoption work. To do that, we need reform at the federal and state
levels-bureaucratic reform that will shatter the incentive structure
that traps kids in foster care, and legal reform that will free
children who already have spent years in substitute care. In Massachusetts,
we call it &quot;Assignment: Adoption,&quot; a comprehensive plan
that our institute is bringing before federal lawmakers and state
governors: 

<P>
<B>Hold states accountable for reporting their progress
in finding homes for children in foster care.</B> Here is one federal
mandate that states ought to be obliged to take on. Washington
should require that states make publicly available, within 30
days of the close of each fiscal year, the following information:
(1) the number of foster children in state care; (2) the number
of foster children free to be adopted and still in state care,
but not in pre-adoptive placements; (3) the number of state-recruited
families with completed home studies. 

<P>
Most conservatives right
now wouldn't touch a federal mandate with a 10-foot pole. I would
prefer to see an entirely private system that includes a strong
charitable element. Until that happens, a few basic requirements
on the states are in order. We're talking about giving children
a mother and a father. And until we know the depth of the problem
in each state, until the number of kids waiting for homes becomes
part of our thinking and vocabulary, state agencies are unlikely
to change. There are people in our state departments of social
services who know these numbers, but we're not hearing them. 

<P>
<B>Prohibit
race-based delays in adoption.</B> Congressional attempts to outlaw
race-matching in adoption have yet to free tens of thousands of
children of color from foster care. This summer, the U.S. Senate
will consider a welfare-reform bill that prohibits race-based
delays in adoption. Even if Congress approves the bill, its impact
could be minimal. 

<P>
Recall that the Multiethnic Placement Act of
1994, sponsored by former U.S. Senator Howard Metzenbaum, had
a similar goal, but it was watered down. Under guidelines released
by HHS in April, the new law allows adoption agencies to consider
the child's &quot;cultural, ethnic, and racial background.&quot;
As reported by the Washington Post, the guidelines &quot;stopped
far short of requiring that adoption must be colorblind.&quot;


<P>
It is at this point that the discrepancies between legal precedent,
public policy, and social-work practices become painfully clear.
The HHS guidelines have not overturned any state laws requiring
that race be considered in adoption. And with vaguely written
state statutes, case workers will continue to have a lot of power
over whether a child will be adopted or languish in long-term
&quot;temporary&quot; care. 

<P>
Suppose every state had adoption policies
that were truly colorblind. We at the Institute for Children are
challenging governors to remove any and all restrictions to adoption
based on race. What would happen if thousands of children of color
grew up in white or mixed-race families? It would produce an amazing
generation of young people who, instead of growing up without
a last name or a permanent home, were raised by loving parents
in a diverse, multicultural environment. Why are some black leaders
so afraid of that? If their real agenda is the well-being of children,
then the evidence is in. Children are infinitely better off in
a loving, interracial home than as virtual orphans in foster care.


<P>
<B>End government funding that creates incentives to keep children
in substitute care for longer than 12 months.</B> Part of the problem
is that government money extends indefinitely, with no sanctions
enforced against  bureaucratic delays. The Adoption Assistance
and Child Welfare Act of 1980 required a &quot;permanency plan&quot;
for every child within 18 months of entering foster care. This
means that case workers decide whether to reunite a child with
his family, place him in long-term fostering, an independent living
arrangement, a group home, or make him  free for adoption. Adoption
is the permanency plan for 100,000 foster children, but no one
knows how often these plans result in permanent homes for children.


<P>
Deadlines for permanency plans come and go, court dates are postponed,
files are lost as children are shuffled among foster families.
A federal study reveals that children spend, on average, 30 to
42 months in foster care before adoption is even decided on as
a permanency plan. Once that happens, the state files a petition
to terminate parental rights; the filing can take another six
months or more. A report by HHS admits that in some states &quot;children
had an official plan of adoption for more than three years, but
no petitions had been filed.&quot;  

<P>The result is that in probably
every state there are children who have been in foster care longer
than 10 years. Meanwhile, the money to support children in state-run
care keeps coming, with no consequences to the state bureaucracies
that fail to place children.  

<P>
<B>Require that states find adoptive
homes for children within 30 days after the termination of parental
rights.</B> The foster child who is freed for adoption typically has
been in the system for at least two years and has had a permanency
plan of adoption for at least one year. Yet, as children become
legally free to be adopted, states claim to need more time to
find families for them! Our institute recommends a 30-day window:
If the state does not have a qualified family waiting, one who
has met the child and is ready to proceed with the adoption, then
state officials must contract out the adoption process to a private
agency. Qualified families exist in large numbers, and private
adoption agencies are pretty good at finding them. Three years
ago, Michigan launched a carrot-and-stick program with public
and private adoption agencies to get kids into permanent homes
more quickly. Since then, total adoptions are up, and the number
of black children adopted has increased by 121 percent-about 700
kids in the past year alone. 

<P>
Critics call this baby-selling and
claim that government should not act like a business. As someone
who has seen the machinery of the state from the inside, I argue
that government could promote children's well-being much more
effectively if it acted more like a business. I am not alone in
noting the failure of foster care management. The director of
the ACLU's Children's Rights Project recently wrote, &quot;If
the foster care system were considered a business, with its profit-and-loss
statements judged in terms of unnecessary human suffering inflicted
by mismanaged systems, in terms of misspent dollars, or even in
terms of how far these systems depart from their own goals, it
would have been forced into bankruptcy long ago.&quot;

<P>
<CENTER><B>Getting
Kids Out of Limbo</B></CENTER><BR> 

All of the above reforms are aimed at getting
the children now eligible for adoption into permanent homes as
quickly as possible. But there are more than 600,000 children
in foster care at some point during the year. Most of those kids
are happily reunited with their parents. Many of them, however,
become trapped in the state-run system-children who are never
free to be adopted, but who will not or should not return to their
biological parents. There are at least three steps every governor
could take to rescue these children from the worst effects of
foster care and help them find a home: 

<P>
<B>Make entrance requirements
for foster families as stringent as those for adoptive families.</B>
In the wake of a wave of child deaths in foster care, people are
beginning to speak out about the need to raise the standards for
being licensed as a foster parent. As one advocate put it, to
be a foster parent &quot;all you need is a clean criminal record
and an extra bed.&quot; People who have failed an adoption home
study can sign up with the state as foster parents. Foster children
deserve better than that. 

<P>
Critics argue that if we raise the requirements
for foster families, there won't be enough qualified people to
take care of the kids. I have more confidence in the generosity
of the American people. I think if you raise the requirements,
you'll see more foster parents and better care. Look, for example,
at private schools with higher requirements and lower teacher
salaries than public schools; they  continue to attract excellent
teachers and deliver a quality education. By maintaining a separate
set of standards for foster parents than those for adoptive parents,
we are saying to a half-million kids that it is not important
where they spend the most formative years of their lives. 

<P>
But
this is not the only disgrace in foster-parent licensing and training
procedures. In state-sponsored training courses, foster parents
are admonished, &quot;Do not get too close to your foster children.
Do not form a bond.&quot; Foster parents are instructed that their
main task is to facilitate a child's return to his or her biological
parents. From day one, good foster parents are discouraged from
adopting. 

<P>
Certainly there is a stigma attached to being a foster
parent-the system has created it. It is that stigma that discourages
many capable and loving people from fostering. If the entrance
requirements for fostering were as high as those for adopting,
foster children would be better cared for. The anti-adoption establishment
wouldn't like it, because it would ruin the standard argument
that foster parents are not adequate to adopt. 

<P>
<B>Allow no more than
12 months for biological parents to prove their fitness to resume
custody of their children.</B> This may be the most difficult law
to pass at the state level, but it also may be the most desperately
needed. State laws can be so vaguely written and so easily assailable
that termination of parental rights is always a last resort and
can take years of court hearings. There are many in the field
who believe it is almost always better to send children back to
their natural parents. The Child Welfare League promotes the notion
that &quot;no one can truly substitute for the family of origin.&quot;


<P>
I agree that nature provides every child with two protectors-a
man and a woman-and that we're meant to be with our biological
parents. But nature didn't design women's bodies to endure crack
cocaine; it didn't design children to be shaken until they suffer
cerebral hemorrhages. Family preservation doesn't work in these
cases because there is nothing left to preserve. 

<P>
State governors
should take the lead in setting tough sanctions against parents
who neglect or abuse their kids. By setting a deadline for parents
to get their lives together-to get off drugs, get out of jail,
find a place to live, and even get a job or go to school-we remind
them that they really are responsible for their actions. But the
deadline must be final and incontestable; otherwise, irresponsible
parents will continue to imprison their children in a labyrinth
of legal battles and parentless foster care. The 12-month limit
has yet to be adopted by any state and is indeed a radical departure
from the years it can now take to legally separate a child from
unfit parents. 

<P>
<B>Allow no more than 30 days from the birth of the
child for biological fathers to formalize paternity.</B> The &quot;Baby
Jessica&quot; and &quot;Baby Richard&quot; cases have demonstrated
the law's allowance for biological fathers who come out of the
woodwork to claim their children after they've been adopted. In
the now pending &quot;Baby Emily&quot; case, a little girl born
in 1992 was soon placed for adoption after the father's rights
were terminated for abandonment (he was doing jail time for a
rape conviction). But now the father is out of prison and has
sued for custody of his daughter. The adoptive family's finances
have been completely exhausted as the case awaits adjudication
in Florida's supreme court. 

<P>
Governor William Weld of Massachusetts
has sent to the legislature a proposal that, if passed, will prevent
such tragic cases in Massachusetts. The proposal requires every
unwed biological father to formalize paternity within 30 days
of the child's birth, and to maintain contact with the child and
provide financial support to the best of his ability-or forfeit
his right to contest the child's adoption. Ideally, that would
mean no appeals, no hearings, no state officials pulling children
out of their adoptive homes. The legislation, if not severely
amended, could serve as a model for state reform.

<P><CENTER><B>A Life That Matters</B></CENTER><BR>
A teenage girl-we'll call her Sarah-who worked for our institute
last summer was a system kid; she had turned 18 in foster care.
This was her first job and she was surprised when she noticed
that taxes had been taken out of her paycheck. She asked me what
the government would do with her money. In my usual non-partisan
spirit, I explained how the federal government would spend the
$300 withheld from her summer earnings. She actually started to
cry. She looked at me and asked, &quot;Will it go to pay for foster
care?&quot; She said it hurt her that she had worked so hard only
to help the government keep some other child from being adopted.
 

<P>
That's what the system is doing to our children. Though my own
experience in foster care was a good one, it opened my eyes to
the real hardships of countless children. My foster brothers and
sisters who might have gone back safely to their families of origin
too often and for too long were delayed from doing so. Others
lived the saddest stories of rejection-they had been burned, beaten,
sodomized or battered, left in a doorway or in a fruit field,
but later sent &quot;home&quot; to their abusers. Like foster
children everywhere, many who could have been adopted were denied
the chance to be loved and cherished by a family who would always
be there. 

<P>
Let's be honest: Adoption is no fairy tale. It is a
risk. Kids don't always go home and live happily ever after. But
every parentless child knows the alternative: the feeling that
there is no one to whom her &quot;case&quot;-that is, her life-really
matters.  

<P>
When parents adopt, they can accomplish something government
cannot: They can convince a child she matters. That's what makes
adoption such a great gift, an expression of unconditional love
and compassion. Don't we, as a society, owe that gift to our children?

At least 90,000 children have been in foster longer than three
years. One in ten foster children remains in care longer than 7
years.
<P>
The population of children in substitute care is growing 33 times
faster than the overall U.S. child population. Every year, 15,000
foster children turn 18 with no permanent family.
<P>
A year in foster care costs taxpayers $17,500 per child. Last year,
California spent $635 million on foster and group home care.
<P>
More than half of all foster children were abused or neglected
by their biological parents.
<P>
Fifteen percent of all children in America are black,but 40 percent
of the children in foster care are black.
<P>
More than 600,000 kids will spend all or part of 1995 in substitute
care - up from 434,000 in 1982.
<P>
After Massachusetts launched an aggressive pro-adoption campaign, foster
child adoptions increased by 47 percent.

<p>
Suppose you are 20 years old and earning $10,000 a year. You and your employer are paying $1,240 a year in Social Security taxes. That's 12.4 percent of your hard-earned income, for benefits that you will never see.<p>
Suppose instead you could invest that same $1,240, as well as an additional $2.50 a week. By the time you are 65, thanks to the magic of compound interest, you would be a millionaire. You would be assured a comfortable retirement.<p>
This isn't a game-show fantasy. This isn't a lottery jackpot. It is a realistic goal. But unlocking this economic opportunity means revolutionizing Social Security. Every American who earns $10,000 a year or more can become a millionaire over the course of one working lifetime45 years. By the year 2000, there will be over 100 million Americans who fall in this category.<p>
In a recent survey, Americans between the ages of 18 and 34 reported they are more likely to see a UFO (46 percent) than their Social Security benefits (28 percent). They're right. The Social Security trust fund starts running out of money, under current projections, in the year 2013. If you're 20 today, that's when you turn 38. By the year 2030, when you turn 55, the fund will be short $200 billion a year and be unable to meet one quarter of its obligations. By the year 2042, when you turn 67 and reach your so-called normal retirement age, the fund will have an accumulated debt of $4.7 trillion. I'm not making this up. This isn't science fiction. These numbers come from the 1994 report of the trustees of the Social Security system.<p>
You could get all your benefits, of course, if there were an enormous tax increase for your children and grandchildren. According to the Social Security trustees, honoring existing promises for Social Security and Medicare benefits will require a rise in payroll taxes from the current level of 15.3 percent to 25.7 percent in 2030. But that simply isn't going to happen. Americans are already overtaxed. Do you think they'll put up with 25 percent payroll taxes, and federal income taxes, plus state and local taxes on top of that?<p>
Some politicians will tell you not to worry: Social Security is building up a big trust fund that will take care of all those promises. By the end of this year, the trust fund will have $475 billion in assetson paper. By 2020, there will be $3 trillion on paper. The trouble is, when the program needs the money, the money will already have been spent on everything the federal government spends money on. To redeem its IOUs to the trust fund, the federal government will have to borrow money or raise taxesby over $36,000 per familyjust as if the trust fund had no assets at all.<p>
So you and your employer are now paying one eighth of your income to pay for the Social Security benefits of current retirees, and to build up an illusory trust fund. Meanwhile, your own retirement is in jeopardy.<p>
No wonder younger Americans fear they are on a treadmill. No wonder there is so much trepidation about the future of the country. No wonder we have a savings crisis: our savings are being spent. No wonder most Americans now say their children will enjoy less opportunity than they do. <p>
It doesn't have to be this way. Social Security can be saved without raising taxes, and without lowering the benefits or cost-of-living adjustments of existing retirees. Social Security can be saved in a way that will open up opportunity for younger peopleso that their standard of living will be better than that of their parents and grandparents. If we use the principles of democratic capitalism to reform Social Security, the 20-year-old making the minimum wage can become a millionaire by the time he or she retires.<p>
Most Americans are on a treadmill because they have but one source of income: wages. The way to get ahead is to earn income from capital. Money makes money. With capital, you can retire in comfort and bequeath a nest egg to your children.<p>
Here is the beauty of capitalism. Any American currently earning $12,580 or more pays $30 a week, or $1,560 a year, into Social Security. Imagine that, beginning at age 20, you invest that $30 a week at market rates. When you retire, you'll be a millionaire. Whoever earns at least the minimum wage can become a millionaire in 45 years.<p>
The secret is compound interest. Let's assume a long-term return on your investments of 8 percent a year. (This is a prudent assumption; the annual return on the Standard & Poor's 500 over the past 70 years, including the Great Depression, is actually 10.19 percent.) If you can save $30 a week ($1,560 a year), after 10 years the value of your portfolio is $29,000. After 20 years, it is $110,000. After 30 years, it is $318,000. Forty years$822,000. And 45 yearsthe normal working lifetime$1.3 million. After 50 years, if you work until age 70, the value of your portfolio crescendoes to an estimated $2 million.<p>
You wouldn't exactly be a millionaire in today's dollars. If we adjust for inflation of about 4 percent a year, your portfolio of $1.3 million after 45 years would be closer to $230,000. That's still a larger nest egg than most working Americans even dream of. With that amount of capital, you could purchase an annuity at age 65 that would give you $18,256 a year (in today's dollars) during your retirement years.<p>
The way to save Social Security is to make the magic of compound interest work for its beneficiaries. I've been developing a proposal that will save Social Securityand enable 100 million Americans to become millionaires. The plan keeps Social Security as a mandatory, redistributive savings program, but it converts the program from the current pay-as-you-go system to a funded system, in which individuals own retirement portfolios at Social Security and choose private investment managers. Individuals would be allowed to set aside portions of their Social Security payments, together with additional voluntary contributions, in their own personal accounts. They could use their accounts for retirement income and pass on the capital tax free to their children. The plan has four basic elements:<p>
Pay existing obligations to all current retirees. Social Security benefits would be paid to all existing retirees, as promised, without changes, and without reductions.<p>
Divide Social Security into two tiers. If you are working now, you and your employer would continue to pay existing Social Security taxes of 12.4 percent on the first $61,200 of your income. Some of that would go to pay the benefits of existing recipients. Some of your payments would go into your own personal account. Payroll taxes would not rise from their current level. They would be cut by 2 percentage points around the year 2040.<p>
The benefits of current retirees would be paid out of the first tiercurrent payroll taxes. When they retire, current workers would draw benefits from two Social Security sources: income from future payroll taxes and income from their personal retirement accounts.<p>
Create personal investment and retirement accounts for the second tier of Social Security. Every worker who earns at least $4,000 would have his own IRA-like account with Social Security. (Unlike an IRA, you could use your account only for retirement, and could not withdraw from it earlier.) The first $500 that you and your employer pay into Social Security every year would be automatically deposited in your personal retirement account. You could increase the deposit in your personal retirement account by up to $3,000 per year by making voluntary contributions that would be matched by Social Security taxes you are already paying. The size of the match would vary according to income.<p>
Here's an example: If you earn $10,000 a year and you contribute $1,240 per year, the first $500 of this money would be paid into your personal account. If you add a savings match of $130, the Social Security program will deposit an additional $610 of tax money you are already paying into the fund into your personal retirement account, for a total of $1,240 per year. In 45 years, your portfolio will be $1,026,524 and you're a millionaire.<p>
If you are making $50,000, you might wish to put the maximum of $3,000 per year into your personal account at Social Security; $1,500 of the $3,000 comes from taxes you are already paying, and $1,500 comes from additional funds you save from your income, that is, from a personal-savings match. In 45 years, your portfolio would be $2.5 million.<p>
This money would be in your name, you would own it, and you would be in charge of picking an investment manager to invest it for you. Social Security would set up a corporation whose only purpose is to certify and approve private-sector money managers. (Criteria would include performance and experience in money management, years in business, and certfiably good character.) You would pick your investment manager from this list, and could switch to a different one any time you wanted. This sort of system is already working well in Chile.<p>
Use your capital account to increase your retirement income, and pass on your assets tax free to your children. When you retire, you would have two attractive choices of what to do with your capital account. One would be to use income from your capital (5 percent a year) for your retirement benefitsand then, when you die, to pass on your entire capital account tax free to your children or heirs. The second would be to purchase an annuity with your capital account, and receive higher retirement benefits during your lifetime but not pass any assets on to your children or heirs. <p>
Based on current life-expectancy charts, when you reach 65 you can expect to live, on average, to age 83, an additional 18 years. With an annuity you could currently receive an estimated 7.9 percent return per year.<p>
If you have a small portfolio when you retire, your Social Security benefits would be paid as promised out of the income from your capital (5 percent a year), as well as payroll taxes from future workers. Suppose, for instance, you have $100,000 in your personal account, and promised Social Security benefits of $10,000 a year. You would receive $5,000 in Social Security income from your capital, and $5,000 through the regular payroll-tax base. When you die, you would then be able to pass your retirement assets on to your children or heirs.<p>
As portfolios grow through compound interest, however, tens of millions of retirees would have the opportunity to increase their benefits. Twenty-year-olds today earning $10,000 a year will retire at age 65 in 2040. If the wages keep up with expected inflation, their final wages will be $15,236. Their promised present-law Social Security benefits will be $9,121 per year (a 59.9 percent replacement level). If payroll taxes are not increased, Social Security benefits would be reduced 24.4 percentfrom $9,121 to $6,892 per year.<p>
Under the Beard system, these retirees would have $1,026,524 in their personal accounts with Social Security ($182,769 in today's money). If they choose an annuity, their Social Security benefits will be $14,511 per year$5,390 higher than present-law Social Security promises. If they wish to pass the $1,026,524 tax free onto their children or heirs, their benefits will be $9,138.<p>
It would be enormously expensive to move from a pay-as-you-go to a funded Social Security system. Annual deposits into personal capital accounts would begin at over $100 billion per year and climb to over $200 billion per year (in today's dollars) by 2040. And this would be in addition to the massive deficits already projected for Social Security beginning in 2013. How can America possibly afford these expenses? The money would come from five sources. <p>
Over time, the largest increase in Social Security revenue would come from the income of the new capital accounts. By 2040, after 45 years in operation, the estimated value of retirees' capital accounts in today's dollars would be $8 trillion, almost double the current value of the private pension system. If we assume 5 percent income from capital to pay retirement benefits, retirees would receive over $400 billion every year from their capital (in today's dollars).<p>
Social Security payroll taxes currently exceed payments by about $25 billion a year. This surplus would go into the personal capital accounts. So would the $475 billion in assets that have supposedly accumulated in the Social Security trust fund. Those assets don't really exist, but workers have paid extra taxes on the federal government's promise that the surplus would go to a trust fund. Amortized over 20 years, the trust fund could be drawn down at the rate of $30 billion a year. In practice, this will mean that other federal expenditures will have to be cut by the same amount, bonds of $30 billion will have to sold to the public, or taxes will have to be raised by $30 billion.<p>
Some $60 billion a year would be saved through a special debt instrument we call the Liberty Bond. The Liberty Bond would be a voluntary 30-year interest-paying instrument. After 30 years, heirs and designees would receive principal and interest tax free. It would be marketed to retirees who do not need all their benefits to enjoy a comfortable retirement, and would gladly forego some of their benefits if they were sure this would help their children.<p>
I anticipate that five to 10 million Americans would purchase Liberty Bonds. Millions of retirees would gladly set aside $1,000 per year to create a $25,000 tax-free education fund for their children and grandchildren. Many would even set aside their full benefits$10,000 to $15,000 a year for their remaining lifetimeto build a nest egg for their children. The government could create a cap of $95 billion per year on the sale of Liberty Bonds, so that no more money is deferred than necessary.<p>
To make the numbers work, benefits will also have to be reduced for future retirees. There are two fair ways to do this. One is to raise the normal retirement age from the current 67 to 70, a change that can be phased in gradually. We are all living longer and we are in better health as we age. It is fair to extend the normal retirement age as our own lifetimes are extended. And in any case, with individual capital accounts in Social Security and the power of compound interest, Americans will want to work longerbecause they'll have the opportunity to build up even larger nest eggs.<p>
The second way to reduce Social Security benefits fairly is to reduce indexation for real wage growth. It is important to index Social Security for inflation. Once you retire, the cost of living continues to rise as a result of inflation. Without cost-of-living adjustments, the purchasing power of your benefits will decrease an estimated 4 percent per year. But Social Security is indexed again for real wage growthabout 1 percent a year. This is icing on the cake for retirees. It is not necessary, and it could be reduced by 50 percent.<p>
The current pay-as-you-go system is an economic, political, and cultural dead end. It will force us to raise taxes, and then raise taxes again to pay promised benefits, or to cut benefits and then cut benefits again to avoid mammoth tax increases. It will create no new capital opportunities. It will drain a growing amount of America's resourcesour savings and investmentout of the private sector. A shrinking private sector damages our ability to create new jobs and new industriesour future strength.<p>
The current system is also a recipe for conflict. If America is a shrinking pie, the young generation and older generation will fight over the crumbs. <p>
Under a funded, two-tier system, we would cut payroll taxes 2 percentage points in 2040 and then cut them again. As the system matures, we would increase retirement benefits by 25 to 35 percent. We would create 100 million millionaires. We would amass unprecedented savings and investment in America by opening the doors of capital ownership to most Americans. We would create a capital pool that no other nation in the world can equal, and use this investment to finance the high-paying jobs and new industries of tomorrow.<p>
By making every American a capitalist, a funded Social Security system would unleash new economic growth, raise the standard of living of our children, and return America to its historic role as the country of tomorrow, with its best days yet to come.

<p>
<br>
One of the most refreshing feelings in the new Washington is the growing  
sense that our current tax system is not long for this world.  
<p>	 
Only days after the November election, Congressman Bill Archer, the  
chairman of the House tax-writing committee, boldly declared his desire  
to "tear out the income tax by its roots." House Speaker Newt Gingrich  
and Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole have since formed a commission   
to consider entirely new alternatives. Presidential candidates Phil Gramm,  
Richard Lugar, and Arlen Specter want to scrap the system. A half dozen  
congressional panels are holding hearings on the subject. Even  
Congressman Richard Gephardt, the House Democratic leader, has  
floated a major rewrite (albeit without details).   
<p> 
The question is no longer whether America will get rid of its burdensome  
tax system; the question is, what new system should we replace it with? It  
is a question that will likely dominate our politics through the next  
election.  
<p>
<center>
<b><a name="The Contenders">THE CONTENDERS</a></b><br>  

<a href="#Contents">Contents</a><br></center>
<p>
There are three main contenders: One is a plan advanced by Senators  
Sam Nunn and Pete Domenici. They were among the earliest to call  
attention to the most economically lunatic feature of the current tax code  
-- the highly destructive double taxation of savings -- and develop a   
way to fix it. Called the "USA Tax," their proposal, while fairly  
complicated, defers taxation on income that is saved, while taxing income  
that is used for consumption. It is a sincere and innovative effort to  
encourage the savings necessary for continued economic growth.  
<p>	 
The second contender, which I strongly favor, is the flat tax. Designed to  
make the tax system as neutral and simple as possible, the flat tax would  
sweep away all loopholes, deductions, and exemptions, and replace them   
with a single generous personal allowance. All other income would be  
taxed at one low rate of 17 percent. As the plan's authors, economists  
Robert E. Hall and Alvin Rabushka, have pointed out, a flat tax would  
allow Americans to figure their taxes on a form the size of a postcard.  
The use of the tax code by would-be social engineers would end. Like the  
USA Tax, the flat tax would also end the double taxation of saving.  
<p>	 
While support for the flat tax is soaring -- almost 60 percent of  
Americans appear to favor a version of it, if polls are to be believed -- the  
Nunn-Domenici plan may have been overtaken by events. Conceived at a  
time when it appeared to many that the redistributionist Democratic Party  
would control Congress indefinitely, the plan contains sharply  
progressive tax rates that would kick in at surprisingly low income levels.  
It addresses the disincentive to save quite well, but it may make the other  
problems in the code, high rates and complexity, even worse than the  
current system. With the new politics in Washington and across the  
country, superior alternatives are now clearly within political reach.  
<p>	 
Then there's choice number three: the national sales tax. This is a  
sweeping plan to wipe away the current system and replace it with an  
unprecedented federal tax on retail purchases. Although it's not as widely  
discussed as the flat tax, it has substantial support among many far- 
thinking conservatives, including Archer and Lugar. Indeed, there are   
few conservative hearts that could not be at least a little warmed by its  
central promise to end the income tax altogether.   
<p>	 
This last choice demands serious examination at the moment. Although  
well-intentioned, the sales-tax option has several serious flaws. Before  
getting into that, though, we must remember that supporters of all these  
plans are allies in a fight to end America's single greatest impediment to  
achieving its possibilities: the IRS code, circa 1995.  
<p>	 
Any American tax system should meet three basic criteria. It should be  
fair, simple, and pro-growth. The current system fails miserably on all  
three counts.   
<p>	 
Is it simple? Not by a long shot. In 1990, American workers and  
businesses spent 5.4 billion hours preparing their taxes for the  
government. That's more time than it takes to build every car, truck, and  
van manufactured in the United States each year. After seven decades of  
amendments, revisions, exemptions, loopholes, and extensions, the code  
has become an incoherent mess. The IRS now sends out eight billion  
pages of forms and instructions each year. Laid end to end, they would  
stretch 28 times around the circumference of the earth.  
<p>	 
Is it fair? Hardly. The tax system is as much an exercise in social  
engineering as it is a way of raising government revenue efficiently.  
Through its exemptions and loopholes, the government tries to guide the  
economic decisions of free Americans in the misguided belief that the   
government knows best. Among other things, the code tells us that it is  
better to invest in a municipal sewer system than the next Microsoft, that  
buying rather than renting a home is a better choice for everyone  
everywhere, that purchasing air compressors is better than buying  
computer software. Government has neither the competence nor the right  
to make those decisions for us. The pretense that "government knows   
best" is an insult to our citizens.  
<p>	 
Is it pro-growth? As written, the tax code actually punishes savings and  
investment, by placing double or even triple tax burdens on capital. This  
lowers wages, destroys jobs, and depresses the living standards of all  
Americans. At the same time, it burdens American workers with  
punishingly high tax rates and overall tax burdens. With state and local   
taxes and other federal taxes, Americans now pay more in taxes than they  
spend on food, clothing, and shelter combined.  
<p>	 
All who have worked to end this system, no matter what plan they  
currently favor, should be welcomed as members of the tax-reform  
movement.   
<p>	 
Now for a closer look at option number three. What follows is my  
assessment of the major arguments advanced in favor of the national sales  
tax:  
<p>	 
<b>A sales tax is not an income tax.</b> The case for a sales tax begins with one  
highly appealing applause line. It will allow us, supporters argue, to  
eliminate the income tax altogether, possibly even repealing the 16th  
Amendment, which authorized it and made Big Government possible in   
the first place.   
<p>	 
Even if that goal were politically feasible -- and I don't think it is -- the  
exchange would come at a high price. We would give up the income tax  
for a more intrusive and pervasive tax system.  
<p>	 
The reason is simple. If the government sets out to collect a new tax at  
the cash register, it will soon have no choice but to extend that tax  
beyond the retailer to every level of production, as it desperately tries to  
stop inevitable and massive tax evasion. Any sales tax will become a  
complex, pervasive, multi-rate, value-added tax. We will soon be living   
under a VAT -- possibly the most insidious tax scheme ever devised.  
<p>	 
Sales-tax backers often oppose a VAT. But that's what they'll get. To  
generate sufficient revenue by taxing goods only at the retail level, the  
government would need to impose a sales tax of at least 20 percent,  
which means that consumers would suddenly find that everything they  
buy appears to be 20 percent more expensive. But people will not pay  
such a high tax. They will either find ways to label their consumer goods  
tax-exempt wholesale items, they will purchase goods in a cash black  
market, or they will evade it some other way. A sales tax, in other words,  
will be immediately undermined by a silent tax revolt, and the  
government -- following the pattern of European countries -- will respond  
by imposing a VAT.  
<p>	 
A VAT is assessed at each stage of production and is much easier to  
collect and enforce for a host of reasons. You can hear the bureaucratic  
lament in a 1993 report by the Organization for Economic Cooperation  
and Development, which noted: "Governments have gone on record as  
saying that an RST [retail sales tax] of more than 10 percent to 12 percent  
is too fragile to tax evasion possibilities, and it is probably not entirely  
accidental that in OECD counties, VAT rates are nearly always above 12  
percent and that, except in Canada and Iceland, RST rates have always  
been well below 12 percent."   
<p>	 
These unhappy governments were speaking from sad experience. In  
1967, 21 developed countries had retail, wholesale, manufacturer, or  
multi-stage sales taxes. Today, 20 out of 21 of these sales taxes have  
become value-added taxes. Every developed country except Australia  
that has had a sales tax now has a VAT. (Even Canada and Iceland,   
mentioned as exceptions when the OECD report was written, have since  
replaced their retail-tax-only systems with VATs.)  
<p>	 
Whether or not the sales tax evolves into a VAT, the government would  
become intimately involved in almost every economic transaction  
between consenting adults. The simplest exchange, from a vegetable  
farmer selling his produce to the corner grocer selling a loaf of bread,  
would be under the shadow of a government tax collector taking his cut.  
In fact, every businessperson in America would become a tax collector  
for the government.  
<p>	 
"But businesses already collect taxes for the government," sales-tax  
supporters counter. There's a big difference. Today, businesses collect a  
relatively small share of the income tax, since three quarters of the  
income in the economy is labor income, paid by individuals. But under a  
sales tax, there is no direct tax on individuals, so businesses will be  
responsible for collecting several times what they collect today. That  
means IRS scrutiny of American businesses could be expected to rise  
proportionately. Since the 10-12 million businesses in America have  
fewer rights under law than individuals, we can expect IRS abuses to rise   
exponentially as well.  
<p>	 
It would be an administrative mess. A national sales tax may well exempt  
many basic necessities from tax --beginning with food and clothing.  
This would lead to bitter disputes over the difference between food and  
candy, between real clothes and costume accessories. Congress and   
the courts would likely find themselves debating the nutritional value of  
Twinkies, the body coverage of sportswear, and much else, just as state  
governments do today, but on a larger scale.  
<p>	 
Worse, the federal sales tax and the dozens of different state sales taxes --  
aside from having different tax rates -- would likely exempt different  
items. That means a small businessperson would need to look up the  
correct state sales-tax rate, apply the federal rate, subtract the state tax  
rate from items exempted only by the state, or subtract only the federal  
rate from items federal-only exempted. Then he would need to do  
separate calculations for each of the states in which he does business.  
(And he would need to catch any mistakes before the tax enforcer  
appears.)  
<p>	 
The likely consequence would be a slowdown in business activity -- and  
a loss of jobs and drop in wages for millions of American workers.   
<p>	 
<b>We could eliminate the IRS.</b> Ignoring or dismissing this inevitable  
tendency for a sales tax to become an all-pervasive VAT -- with a huge  
accompanying bureaucracy -- some sales-tax advocates nevertheless  
argue that the sales tax would allow us to eliminate the IRS altogether.  
<p>	 
The argument is presented with an interesting federalist twist. The states,  
they say, could collect the new federal sales tax through their existing  
sales-tax systems. The federal government, then, could do without its  
own revenue collection agency. We could bring about the ultimate   
devolution of federal authority.  
<p>	 
One immediate problem, however, is that five states do not have a sales  
tax and would not take kindly to enforcing one for Washington. Even  
those that do would consider the costs of collecting a huge federal sales  
tax (the main source of federal revenue) an unbearable federal   
mandate.  
<p>
The enforcement costs for current sales taxes, currently about 5 percent,  
are manageable. However, if you add a 20 percent federal sales tax on top  
of that, the compliance problems grow exponentially. It makes little   
sense for a state government to pay the enforcement costs for a 25  
percent tax when it only gets one fifth of the revenue. Many states would  
simply eliminate their sales taxes.  
<p>	 
But the point is purely academic. For reasons dating back to the unhappy  
years of the Articles of Confederation, the federal government will never  
rely on state governments for its prime source of revenue. It will not  
happen.  
<p>	 
In truth, a sales tax would not eliminate any federal agency. It will  
actually allow a huge increase in the size of the federal government by  
allowing politicians to raise taxes with relative impunity. Why? Because  
sales taxes are hidden from the taxpayers, concealed in the price of the  
goods they buy.  
<p>	 
Try this experiment. Stand outside a grocery store and ask shoppers as  
they leave how much they just paid in sales tax. You'll find that virtually  
no one knows. Can you guess how much you paid in sales tax last month,  
or last year? The problem is, if people don't appreciate how much they  
pay in taxes, it is a lot easier for politicians to raise them.  
<p>	 
<b>Individuals would no longer need to file tax forms with the government.</b>
Since people would pay their taxes whenever they purchase an item,  
some sales-tax advocates argue, the government will never need to know  
a taxpayer's name. There would be no filing of any tax papers at all by an   
individual.  
<p>	 
That's not quite right. Under almost any sales-tax plan, individuals would  
still file with the government -- but for entirely different reasons than  
they do today.  
<p>	 
It's almost certain that one way or another, any federal sales tax would  
need to exempt certain basic necessities in order to make it progressive.  
One way to do this, as I've mentioned above, would be to order retailers  
not to charge tax on food and clothing and whatever else the government   
selects.   
<p>	 
But exempting a handful of items isn't enough. Absent a generous rebate,  
most Americans would face a stiff tax increase under a sales tax. That's  
why most sales-tax proposals provide for a rebate. The truth is, the   
overwhelming majority of Americans would still need to file with the IRS  
to claim their rebate (or else face a substantial tax increase).   
<p>	 
Some have suggested the IRS could simply send out checks to every  
American by Social Security number, obviating the need for taxpayers to  
file with the IRS. This is a fantasy. It wouldn't be long before there were  
more Social Security numbers than citizens. Whether or not Americans   
file directly with the IRS, the potential for fraud is staggering. Even under  
the current Earned Income Tax Credit program, fraud levels are as high  
as 30 to 40 percent. How much fraud would there be if the federal  
government were cutting thousand-dollar checks to every American?  
<p>	  
Of even greater concern is the political dynamic that would develop once  
we couple a hidden sales tax with a highly visible tax rebate. Americans  
would be quietly nickel-and-dimed to death by a sales tax they may  
hardly notice, but every year a very noticeable and generous check would  
arrive from Washington like manna from heaven. Government, and even  
the tax bureaucracy, might become highly popular after all. And in my  
judgment, if there could be anything worse then people hating the IRS, it  
would be for people to love the IRS.	  
<p>	 
<b>A sales tax will tax the underground economy.</b> The notion here is that a  
sales tax will more effectively tax illicit trade in both legal and illegal  
goods and services than any income tax. If true, this would bring in tens  
of billions of dollars in revenue to the government as we collect revenue   
from people who are currently outside the system.  
<p>	 
The neighborhood drug dealer almost always serves as the illustration.  
Since the drug dealer declines to file a 1040 form, the argument runs,  
maybe we could at least recoup some of his income through a sales tax.  
The government may have no record that he exists, but when he uses his  
blood money to buy a sports car, the government will collect tax from  
him.  
<p>	 
That sounds compelling at first, but if we think it through, it doesn't hold  
together. Look at it this way: Both systems will equally fail to tax the  
drug trade for the simple reason that the drug dealer will not play along in  
either one. If there's an income tax in place, he won't report his income. If  
there's a sales tax in place, he won't collect tax from his customers. Either  
way, the government loses exactly the same amount of money.  
<p>	 
Consider the following example. Suppose there is a drug dealer who  
makes $50,000 in sales to his customers every year and then turns around  
and spends it. Under an income tax system, we wish to tax the income of  
the dealer and his customers, while under a sales tax we wish to tax all of  
their purchases.  
<p>	 
Under the income tax, we tax the income of the drug consumers  
(assuming they are law-abiding citizens besides their drug use), but we  
can't tax the income of the drug dealer. Thus we lose $50,000 from the  
tax base. Under the sales tax, we tax the purchases of the drug dealer, but  
we don't tax the purchases of the drug consumers. Loss to the tax   
base: $50,000.  
<p>	 
It has to be the case that neither system taxes the value of the drug trade  
because the amount people spend on drugs must equal the income of the  
drug dealer. And since the drug dealer will not report sales or income tax,  
neither system will capture the value of the drug trade.   
<p>	 
The same would hold true for the underground economy in legal goods  
and services as well -- which, of course, is much larger. The proverbial  
plumber who doesn't report his house-call income today would not report  
it for sales-tax purposes either. At best, it will be a wash.  
<p> 	 
Actually, economic reasoning aside, the whole "underground economy"  
argument for a sales tax is flawed. It's obvious that if we try to impose a  
national sales tax of 20 percent or more on the public, the underground  
economy will explode. The "contraband" involved, though, will not be  
just crack cocaine, but virtually any sort of consumer good. That's   
exactly what happened in Canada when the government imposed its  
goods-and-services tax. The tax raised much less than projected.  
Coincidentally, the Canadian Treasury soon noticed a dramatic increase  
in the amount of real currency flowing through the economy. Why were  
Canadians suddenly using so much cash? Guess.  
<p>	 
<b>A sales tax will reduce the trade deficit.</b> Supporters say that a sales tax  
will increase U.S. competitiveness by taxing imports and not taxing  
exports. As tax-policy people put it, a sales tax is "border adjustable."  
Since exports aren't sold in the U.S., they would escape a domestic sales  
tax; since foreign imports are sold here, they will get hit. This way,  
American firms receive a significant tax advantage over foreign firms,  
and that will favorably alter our trade balance.  
<p> 
There are very few economists who hold this view, however. An  
immutable law of economics holds that trade surpluses and deficits are  
linked to the amount a nation lends or borrows. When savings are low,  
the trade deficit must be high, but if we substituted a tax on imports for  
some other tax, it will not affect the amount Americans save. That means   
the trade deficit not only will stay the same, it must stay the same, as a  
basic principle of economics.  
<p>	 
Economists might explain it this way (simplifying, of course): If there is  
more investment occurring in our economy than can be financed by our  
savings, then foreign investors must be accounting for the difference. In  
effect, they are taking the money we pay them for their cars and VCRs  
and using it to buy our stocks and bonds, thus supplying the investment  
capital that we don't supply ourselves. This difference is the "trade  
deficit."   
<p>	 
The only way to change the trade deficit, then, is to change our savings  
rate. If we increase our savings relative to our domestic investment, we  
will have less need for foreign cash. The trade deficit will then drop, as  
we spend relatively less money buying foreign goods and relatively more   
investing at home.  
<p>	 
But anything we do to tax incoming foreign goods -- including slapping  
them with a sales tax -- will have no effect on the amount of money  
Americans are putting into domestic stocks and bonds or even their own  
bank accounts. There is simply no relationship between them.  
<p>	 
What will happen instead is this: Our exports will increase at first because  
of the new tax advantage. But since our savings will remain the same, the  
dollar will be artificially strengthened. This will make our exports more   
expensive, and the original balance of trade will be gradually restored --  
along with the original trade deficit. The policy will be self-defeating.  
<p>	 
Even if a border adjustment were to work as its proponents claim, it  
would still be a bad idea. It would make the goods Americans buy --  
whether produced here in America or abroad -- more expensive, while  
foreigners could purchase American-made goods more cheaply. It's hard  
to see how Americans benefit from paying higher prices than foreigners  
do to purchase American products.  
<p>	 
Adam Smith makes a relevant point in The Wealth of Nations. Smith  
reminds us, "Consumption is the sole end and purpose of all production;  
and the interest of the producer bought to be attended to, only so far as it  
may be necessary for promoting that of the consumer."  
<p>	 
In a border-adjustable system, however, to borrow from Smith again, "the  
interest of the consumer is almost constantly sacrificed to that of the  
producer; and it seems to consider production, and not consumption, as  
the ultimate end and object of all industry and commerce."

<p>
All of the above assumes, of course, that we really could replace the  
income-tax system with a national sales tax. But could we? The roots of  
the income tax go back to the 16th Amendment, passed in 1916 to  
authorize the government to levy a tax on individual incomes. In my  
view, repealing the amendment and ending the income tax for good   
is, politically, not in the cards. Conservatives in Congress have tried for  
years to pass a balanced-budget amendment without success. I believe we  
will eventually succeed, but in the midst of that grueling fight, I believe  
the notion of getting 290 members of the House, 67 members of the  
Senate, and three quarters of the states to repeal the 16th Amendment is a   
dream.

And that is perhaps the best argument against the sales tax. If we try to  
exchange an income tax for a sales tax, we could easily end up with both.  
It would be a tragic irony if conservatives who favor a smaller  
government unwittingly provide the liberals with a comprehensive new  
taxing authority without eliminating the old one.  
<p>

<b><a name="Flat-Tax">THE FLAT-TAX OPTION</a></b><br>  

<a href="#Contents">Contents</a><br></center>
<p>	 
We must not lose sight of the commendable motives behind the sales tax.  
Its supporters want a tax code that does not interfere with economic  
decisionmaking, minimizes the paperwork burdens on the taxpayers,  
limits the size of the federal government, avoids excessive taxes on  
savings and investment, and is straightforward and fair.  
<p>	 
For all the above reasons, however, the sales tax is not likely to achieve  
those goals. The flat tax, however, will do so. By placing a single tax rate  
on all income, it will not distort economic decisions. Citizens will be free  
to spend and invest their money as they see fit without taking tax  
considerations into account. The paperwork burden, for most taxpayers,  
will be reduced to filling out a postcard-sized tax return. Americans will  
get an honest bill and know how much their government costs them.  
Savings and investment income will be taxed, but only once. The  
punitive double taxation of savings in the current code will be gone. The  
flat tax meets the tax-reform criteria -- it is simple, fair, and pro-growth.

<p>
As members of Congress consider legislative proposals that will lead us into the next century, it is important that we understand the demographic composition of the districts they represent. This book does just that. We have used 1990 Long Form Census information, and ranked the Congressional Districts in numerous key categories, including the total amount of public assistance districts get, the total amount of farm income, the number of people who have a mortgage, just to name a few. In all we have 97 different categories to look at.<p>The layout of these reports is straightforward. <p>



<pre>
              People Over 65 -- Percent
       Congressional District Average:	12.5%

		State	CD	%	Deviation

	1.	FL	22	31.1%	5.49
	2.	FL	13	30.9%	5.44
	3.	FL	19	28.1%	4.62
	4.	FL	10	26.2%	4.03
	5.	FL	05	25.7%	3.88
	6.	FL	14	25.6%	3.87
	7.	FL	16	23.9%	3.36
	8.	FL	09	21.7%	2.70
	9.	AZ	03	19.7%	2.13

</pre>





<ul><li>The ranking is simply where the Congressional District is in relation to the other 434 and the District of Columbia.<p><li>The CD identifies each district with the two letter state abbreviation, and the Congressional District number within the state. 
<p>
<li>The # or % is the actual information. For example, the % of Asians in a district.
<p>
<li>The deviation is a little more complex. This is to show how far from the average a particular district is. It answers the question of whether the district is just slightly different from the national average, or significantly different. It also allows you to see the difference between two districts more clearly as well. 
<p>
<li>For more information on the U.S. Census Bureau, visit their web page, at <a href="http://www.census.gov/">http://www.census.gov/</a>

</ul><p>
We hope this book will give readers a better understanding of all the Congressional Districts and what issues members might be concerned about.

<H2>THE NATIONAL ENDOWMENT:<BR>
IT'S TIME TO FREE THE ARTS</H2>
</CENTER>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 50%>
<P>
<CENTER>
<I>by</I>
<P>
<I>Robert H. Knight</I></CENTER>
<P>
After years of debate and attempted reform, it has become clear
that the National Endowment for the Arts is beyond reclamation
and should be zero-budgeted by the 104th Congress. 
<P>
Particularly with regard to the visual arts (drawing, painting
and sculpting) and &quot;performance&quot; arts (theater, film,
live acts), the NEA has been a platform for attacks on religion,
traditional art forms, traditional families and traditional values,
and a forum for the promotion of homosexuality.  In the name of
tolerance, it has shown increasing intolerance toward standards
of any kind, including ordinary standards of artistic skill. 
Its peer review process has long been a buddy system for awarding
grants to colleagues, friends and clients of panel members, who
are almost uniformly hostile to traditional culture.   
<P>
However, even if the federal agency did manage to clean up its
act, the entire idea of government sponsorship of art is a bad
one.  Whenever the government decides to subsidize one artist
and not another, the government, in effect, determines what is
art and what is not.
<P>
Unlike any other arts sponsor, the federal government has unique
authority and responsibility.  Its powers derive from its claim
to represent all Americans and its money from mandatory taxes.
 NEA grants greatly influence what is presented in museums and
theaters and what private donors feel is worthy of support.  As
former NEA Chairman John Frohnmayer noted: &quot;Our grantees
state unequivocally that fund-raising is substantially easier
because of an Endowment grant.  It is an endorsement -- a mark
of quality and achievement.&quot;[1]
<P>
And what has the NEA done with this awesome responsibility? 
<P>
Since its founding, the NEA has openly favored the avant-garde
-- defined by <I>Webster's Third New International Unabridged
Dictionary</I> as: &quot;Those who 
create, produce or apply new, original or experimental ideas,
designs, techniques...and sometimes: a group that is extremist,
bizarre, or arty and affected.&quot;[2]  Unfortunately, the NEA seems
to have taken the latter portion of the definition to heart. 
There is a place, of course, for experimental art, but it should
be funded privately, not by taxpayers whose money often is used
to disparage their most deeply held beliefs.
<P>
As a federal agency, the NEA should not be fostering a bias toward
one particular art style over another.  In fact its own grant
guidelines specifically forbid it to do so or attempt to direct
artistic content.[3]
<P>
One reason the NEA has been able to promote bad art without public
scrutiny is that the media are not telling the whole story.  TV
broadcasters and newspapers are restrained by the bounds of good
taste from reproducing the most offensive works funded by the
NEA.  A January 2, 1991 <I>Los Angeles Times </I>article about
an NEA grant to performance artist Karen Finley described her
work only as &quot;strongly feminist in tone.&quot;[4] This leaves
the impression that Finley, who calls herself the &quot;Queen
of Dung,&quot; is controversial merely for being a feminist, not
because of her vulgarities.  
<P>
Because of this kind of obfuscation, most Americans have only
an abstract concept of the works in question.  Senator Jesse Helms,
the NEA's most active critic, has offered to debate the issue
on any TV network providing he can show viewers what is being
debated.  All have refused.  And for good reason.  If NBC-TV actually
aired some NEA-funded works, it would violate Federal Communications
Commission rules against obscenity and risk losing its broadcasting
license.  One federal agency would find itself prosecuting a company
for displaying materials sponsored by another federal agency.
<P>
<H3><CENTER>THE CHAIRMAN'S VIEWS</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Under the chairmanship of actress Jane Alexander, the NEA has
not curbed its hostility toward traditional values.  In fact,
Alexander told the homosexual magazine <I>The Advocate</I> that
she intended to use the NEA to &quot;introduce people gently to
gay themes all across the country. And I mean gently, because
if you start with a kind of very overt thing, people get scared....
 You gently bring in gay people and introduce them to the world
through art.&quot;[5]
<P>
When asked, &quot;What sorts of grants would you reject out of
hand,&quot; Alexander answered: &quot;It's hard to say at this
point if there is any grant that I might reject.&quot;[6]
<P>
Indeed, Alexander later defended a performance in February 1994
at the NEA-funded Walker Art Center in Minneapolis in which an
HIV-positive performer, Ron Athey, sliced into another man's back
with a knife, mopped up the blood with towels and sent them on
clotheslines over the horrified audience.  He also had two female
assistants weave acupuncture needles through his own scalp and,
in turn, pierced the women's cheeks with steel spikes.[7]
<P>
Asked by a reporter what she thought of the performance, Alexander
replied that she trusted the judgment of the Walker management,
and said, &quot;Not all art is for everybody....  Americans are
certainly not used to seeing bloodletting, except in films, and
when it happens in person, it must be surprising.&quot;  Alexander
added that she thought &quot;all appropriate precautions&quot;
regarding health had been taken, &quot;So what are we left with
that was considered controversial?  The sacrification [sic], the
ritual-like aspect?  Is it that the man is homosexual?&quot;[8]
<P>
Congress responded to Alexander's lack of action by cutting $4
million from the NEA budget.  Athey then performed his act at
another NEA-funded theater, New York's P.S. 122.  &quot;With full
knowledge of this,&quot; culture critics David Horowitz and Laurence
Jarvik note, &quot;The NEA again funded both P.S. 122 and the
Walker Art Center in the most recent grant cycle.  Plainly, the
agency is deaf to the concerns of Congress and the public.&quot;[9]
<P>
Some of the more serious problems[10] at the NEA include:
<P>
- Bias against religion; rejecting positive portrayals of religion
as violating the separation of church and state, but funding attacks
on religion as &quot;artistic expression&quot;;
<P>
- Elevation of &quot;freedom of expression&quot; and &quot;artistic
merit&quot; as the main criteria for grants, ignoring the NEA's
charter legislation of 1965, which set &quot;encouragement of
excellence&quot; as the No. 1 criterion, followed by &quot;access
to the arts for all Americans&quot;;  
<P>
- Confusion in upper management about how to comply with congressionally-mandated
standards;
<P>
- Confusion about the NEA's primary mission;
<P>
- Conflicts of interest in the grant-awarding process;
<P>
- A bureaucracy openly hostile to public scrutiny;
<P>
- Bias against traditional forms of art and traditional values
in general.
<P>
<H3><CENTER>HOSTILITY TOWARD RELIGION</H3></CENTER>
<P>
The First Amendment prohibits Congress (and federal agencies authorized
by Congress) to infringe on religious liberties.  It is clearly
unconstitutional to use federal tax dollars to create and distribute
an attack on religious beliefs.  The government has no business
dictating the value of religious beliefs or prescribing changes
in them. 
<P>
Yet the taxpayer-supported NEA over the years has funded works
that degrade or mock religious belief, particularly Christianity.
<P>
- In June, 1993, the Whitney Museum of American Art, which received
$200,000 from the NEA during 1992-1993, displayed <I>Abject Art:
Repulsion and Desire in American Art</I>.  The exhibit's journal
explains the focus: &quot;Although 'abject art' is a play on 'object
art,' the term does not connote an art movement so much as it
describes a body of work which incorporates or suggests abject
materials such as dirt, hair, excrement, dead animals, menstrual
blood, and rotting food in order to confront taboo issues of gender
and sexuality....  Employing methodologies adapted from feminism,
queer theory, post-structuralism, Marxism, and psychoanalysis,
our goal is to talk dirty in the institution [of art] and degrade
its atmosphere of purity and prudery by foregrounding issues of
gender and sexuality in the art exhibited.&quot;[11]
<P>
The Whitney show included works by Joel-Peter Witkin, who received
four fellowship grants from the NEA: Fiscal year 1980, $3,000;
FY 1981 $12,500; FY 1986, $15,000; FY 1992, $20,000.[12] Witkin's
work includes &quot;Maquette for Crucifix,&quot; a naked Jesus
Christ surrounded by sado-masochistic obscene imagery, and many
grotesque portrayals of corpses and body parts.  Another Whitney
exhibit was a film by Suzie Silver titled &quot;A Spy,&quot; which
depicts Jesus Christ as a woman standing naked with breasts exposed.
 The Whitney also included &quot;Piss Christ,&quot; Andres Serrano's
photograph of a crucifix in a jar of urine, and a film by porn
star Annie Sprinkle titled &quot;The Sluts and Goddesses Video
Workshop or How to be a Sex Goddess in 101 Easy Steps.&quot;[13] Sprinkle
has performed numerous times in NEA-funded venues such as Highways
in Los Angeles and The Kitchen Theater in New York, where she
has had audience members come on stage to examine her exposed
genitals.
<P>
- Diamanda Galas, who was The Kitchen Theater's first artist-in-residence,
performed &quot;Plague Mass&quot; at the Cathedral of St. John
the Divine in Manhattan in 1990, during which she appeared topless
and covered with blood.[14] A member of ACT-UP, the AIDS activist
group, she was arrested during a demonstration at St. Patrick's
Cathedral in New York in 1989.[15] On July 8, 1993, she opened the
Serious Fun Festival at Lincoln Center, which was supported by
a $14,700 dance grant from the NEA.[16] As the New York Times explains,
&quot;Conceptually, her work is close to that of the late David
Wojnarowicz, the visual artist-writer who died of AIDS in 1992.&quot;
 In 1990, the NEA gave a $15,000 grant to Wojnarowicz, who specialized
in photographs of men performing oral sex, anal sex, anal-oral
sex and masturbation.  An essay in one of his exhibits described
New York's John Cardinal O'Connor as &quot;a fat cannibal from
that house of walking swastikas up on fifth avenue,&quot; and
a &quot;creep in black skirts.&quot;[17]
<P>
- Anti-Christian material is distributed through the NEA-supported
Video Data Bank at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago.[18]
The following are a couple of the offerings, with descriptions
cited from &quot;Gay and Lesbian Tapes Distributed by the Video
Data Bank&quot;:
<P>
<I>Popular Thought</I>.  This video equates the &quot;moral majority&quot;
with totalitarianism.  &quot;UThe message reverberates with the
interweaving of archival footage of Nazi Youth, book burnings
and modern day Ohio Youth for Jesus creating an audiovisual fabric
of hatredU -- Carole Ann Klonarides.&quot;
<P>
<I>Peccatum Mutum (The Silent Sin)</I>.  &quot;...explores relationships
among cloistered nuns....  Utilizing gothic expressionistic sets,
humor, serious kissing, and melodrama, this work expresses the
contradictions and ironic similarities between physical desire
and spiritual fervor.  A rare glimpse at the other side of Catholic
guilt.&quot;
<P>
<H3><CENTER>TARGETING THE FAMILY</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Promotion of &quot;alternative lifestyles&quot; has long been
a staple of NEA grants.  A case in point is, again, NEA support
of the Video Data Bank, which offers these films and accompanying
synopses:[19]
<P>
- <I>Swamp</I>.  &quot;This subversive soap opera targets the
family, psychotherapy and property as the villains.&quot;
<P>
- <I>A Coalminer's Granddaughter</I>.  &quot;This hysterically
funny epic about a brutally realistic American family does for
lesbians what John Waters did for Baltimore....  Under the thumb
of her sleazy, evil father (brilliantly portrayed by novelist
Kevin Killian) Jane is not the hero of her own life....  <I>Coal
Miner's Granddaughter</I> opens up into the impressionistic world
of her sexuality...highly charged sexuality [that makes] staples
of lesbian erotica seem tepid and silly.&quot;
<P>
- <I>Talk to Me Like the Rain</I>.  &quot;...two brothers whose
incestuous behavior feeds a disillusionment in the trust and faith
with one another [sic].&quot;
<P>
- <I>Stephen</I>.  &quot;This production focuses on the story
of siblings and, in this case, twins locked in a complex, emotional
and sexual relationship....  In the end, the expectations of both
religion and a modern world are abandoned....&quot;
<P>
- <I>The A Ha! Experience</I>.  &quot;...explores the erotic elements
of mother-infant intimacy that are repeated in the oedipal devaluation
of the mother, the object of desire for the daughter.&quot;
<P>
<H3><CENTER>PROMOTING HOMOSEXUALITY</H3></CENTER>
<P>
By validating the pro-homosexual viewpoint through taxpayer-supported
government grants, the NEA has helped legitimize pro-homosexual
theater in general.  <I>New York Newsday</I> arts critic Linda
Winer notes that: &quot;The fact is, much of the theater these
days is gay....  Indeed, much of it has been for a very long time....
 This season there have been so many gay projects that I've been
searching for an alternative to the term 'straight play' when
describing a nonmusical.&quot;[20]
<P>
NEA-funded venues such as The Woolly Mammoth Theatre in Washington,
D.C., The Franklin Furnace and The Kitchen in New York, Highways
in Los Angeles, and countless other NEA-funded theater groups
around the country present works promoting homosexuality and blasting
traditional morality.  The NEA also supports pro-homosexual projects
shown on the Public Broadcasting System.  Some recent examples
of pro-homosexual, NEA-supported works:
<P>
- In April, 1994, Woolly Mammoth staged NEA grant recipient Tim
Miller's one-man performance, &quot;My Queer Body,&quot; in which
he, among other things, describes what it's like to have sex with
another man, climbs naked into the lap of a spectator, and finally
arouses himself sexually in full view of the audience.[21]
<P>
- In January, 1994, the Public Broadcasting Service showed <I>Tales
of the City</I>, a three-part miniseries celebrating homosexual
life in San Francisco in the 1970s.  The series was full of gratuitous
nudity, crudity, lewdness and dozens of instances of foul language.
 Families are lampooned and homosexuality is portrayed as superior.
 The series was co-produced by American Playhouse, which received
$750,000 in NEA funds in 1993.  NEA received an on-screen credit
as a supporter of the film. 
<P>
- In August 1994, the Public Broadcasting Service aired <I>One
Nation Under God</I>, a misleading, one-sided documentary by two
homosexual activists that attempts to discredit ex-gay therapy
and counseling.[22] The NEA is credited as a main sponsor for the
film, which links Christian ministries to Nazi techniques such
as shock/aversion therapy, a practice which has long been denounced
by the ex-gay movement.  The film misportrays several homosexual
activists, misrepresents Evelyn Hooker's psychological studies
of homosexual men in the 1950's, and uses Biblical references
out of context.  The film also takes quotes from several therapists
and former homosexuals out of context.  In one clip, a former
homosexual explains that he used to think that &quot;God hates
homosexuals,&quot; but that he now knows that God loves them.
 The filmmakers include only the fragment, &quot;God hates homosexuals,&quot;
reversing the man's intended meaning.  Dr. Elizabeth Moberly,
author of <I>Psychogenesis</I> and founder of a Pennsylvania-based,
ex-gay ministry, says the filmmakers misrepresented themselves,
took her out of context in her taped interview and distorted severely
what she and other therapists had said.[23] The film was shown at
several gay and lesbian film festivals during the summer of 1994
and at the 1995 Gay Games and Cultural Festival in New York City.
 Over the years, the NEA has supported several gay and lesbian
film festivals, which have presented hard-core pornography and
anti-religious themes.[24]
<P>
- The NEA-supported Video Data Bank at the School of the Art Institute
of Chicago offers numerous homosexual films.  <I>Danny</I>, a
20-minute documentary, includes footage touting &quot; Uthe raw
sensuality of cruising and anonymous encountersU -- Robert Rosenberg,
Global Village.&quot;  <I>Jollies</I> is an 11-minute film by
Sadie Benning, who &quot;recounts her earliest sexual encounters.&quot;
 Another Benning work, <I>Me and Rubyfruit</I>, &quot;chronicles
the enchantment of teenage lesbian love.&quot;  Other titles in
the catalog are frankly pornographic.   
<P>
<H3><CENTER>TALKING POINTS</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<B>Curbing the NEA would amount to censorship, and that's against
the First Amendment, isn't it?</B>
<P>
The First Amendment to the Constitution states that &quot;Congress
shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or
prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom
of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peacefully
to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.&quot;
<P>
The Constitution limits the federal government and, by extension
of the 14th Amendment, the states, from censoring protected speech,
as defined over the years by Supreme Court cases.  It does not
limit individual citizens nor private groups, which have freedom
to maintain their own standards of decency and their own viewpoints.
 The issue is one of sponsorship, not censorship.  There is no
constitutional &quot;right&quot; of an artist to a subsidy from
his fellow taxpayers.  
<P>
<B>But won't the arts collapse without federal aid?</B>
<P>
More than $9 billion in private giving sustains arts in communities
all over America.[25} The NEA's $175 million is important more for
its symbolism than for the actual dollars involved.   An NEA grant
validates an artist, and the government should not be in the business
of determining what is art.  That process smacks of &quot;official&quot;
art, such as is imposed on the artistic communities in totalitarian
societies.
<P>
<B>Can the NEA be reformed?</B>
<P>
No, it can't.  Congress has tried several times to rein in the
rogue agency, including appointing an independent commission to
study the NEA in 1990.  With some fanfare, the NEA adopted a few
reforms, but continued to fund the worst excesses in the art world.
 Even after Congress slightly cut the NEA's budget in 1994 as
a message of discontent, it continued to shovel money to artists
whose primary purpose is to insult the majority of taxpayers.
 Also, NEA officials consistently have displayed an arrogant disregard
for the taxpayers.  Even a pro-reform arts critic, the late Samuel
Lipman, who had been a member of the National Council on the Arts
during the 1980s, finally came to the conclusion in the 1990s
that the agency was irreparable and should be abolished.
<P>
<B>Besides ending subsidies for bad art, are there any other reasons
to defund NEA?</B>
<P>
Yes.  The federal deficit is out of control, so Congress must
find ways to cut back without endangering infrastructure.  Before
1965, the United States got along just fine without federal art
subsidies, which are a product of the Great Society's massive
government expansion.   Also, NEA funds are distributed in a grossly
distorted fashion, with certain areas such as New York, Los Angeles
and Minnesota receiving far more money than other states and cities.
 And many grants go to artists who are already successful and
do not need the money.  Finally, ending federal subsidies would
put a dent in cultural imperialism; pampered artists could no
longer use the federal government to tell the rest of the nation
what is art and what isn't.  Pulling the plug on NEA money would
mean that communities would support the arts that the people in
those communities wanted -- not the art that is dictated from
Washington, D.C.

<P>
In the welfare debate last year, President Clinton himself stated
that &quot;the real source of [the] problem is the inordinate
number of out-of-wedlock births in this country.&quot;[1]  He also
conceded that &quot;there's no question that [ending welfare for
unwed mothers] would work.  The question is... 'Is it morally
right?'&quot;[2]
<P>
While the President's proposed policies leave much to be desired,
he has formulated precisely the right question to frame the current
debate over welfare reform in general and illegitimacy in particular.
 There can be no more important policy objective than the preservation
-- or more properly in this day and age, the revitalization --
of our nation's moral capital.  As James Q. Wilson wrote in his
oft-cited article, &quot;The Rediscovery of Character: Private
Virtue and Public Policy&quot;:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The essential first step is to acknowledge that at root, in almost
every area of important public concern, we are seeking to induce
persons to act virtuously....  Not only is such conduct desirable
in its own right, it appears now to be necessary if large improvements
are to be made in those matters we consider problems.[3]</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
There exists a striking public consensus that the welfare state's
practice of subsidizing illegitimacy is not only a massive problem,
but a moral problem at root.
<P>
Even so unlikely a source as Bruce Reed, President Clinton's leading
aide on welfare reform, acknowledges that the essential purpose
of reform must be to reverse the alarming rise in out-of-wedlock
births.[4]  If not driven exclusively by AFDC &quot;benefits,&quot;
the increase has at least been sustained and perpetuated by the
expansion of a system that pays recipients to bear illegitimate
children.  Current trends indicate that by the year 2015 -- some
studies project as early as 2000 -- one of every two American
babies will be born to a single mother, and illegitimacy will
surpass divorce as the main cause of fatherlessness.  If a job
program succeeds in putting more unmarried welfare mothers to
work (which is unlikely on a sufficiently grand scale, given budget
constraints), we will still be left with roughly the same number 
of fatherless children.  While
Great Britain has already succeeded in implementing reforms that
make work economically more attractive than welfare, the reforms
of the 1980s have only served to underscore in both Britain and
America the fact that little progress can be made without addressing
the collapse of the family.[5]
<P>
No moral judgment even need be adduced to acknowledge that intact
families bestow upon individuals and communities advantages that
simply come no other way.  Empirical evidence amassed by social
scientists in the last ten years (and chronicled for popular consumption
by Barbara Dafoe Whitehead in her April 1993 <I>Atlantic</I> article,
&quot;Dan Quayle Was Right&quot;) has confirmed in exquisite detail
what those who have lived in broken families already know.  A
single woman with children is not a viable economic unit for the
vast majority, but children need biological fathers for much more
than the extra dollars they add to the family budget.  As social
scientist Charles Murray has written, single parenthood is &quot;damaging
to children in so many ways that to list them individually would
be to trivialize them.&quot;[6]
<P>
Not surprisingly, Dr. Murray also concludes that &quot;illegitimacy
is the single most important social problem of our time...because
it drives everything else.&quot;[7]  More than 70 percent of all
juveniles in state reform institutions, for example, come from
fatherless homes; and the relationship between crime and one-parent
families is so powerful that controlling for family structure
erases the relationship between crime and race and between crime
and low income.  Illegitimacy feeds itself, too.  Young white
women who grow up without a father in the home are more than twice
as likely to bear children out-of-wedlock and to do so during
their teenage years when they are most likely to form long-term
attachments to AFDC.
<P>
If those on the welfare rolls have suffered most conspicuously,
it is also true that the welfare system has corrupted the ideals
and narrowed the vision of many who live well beyond the bounds
of the inner city -- even as it is now threatening our most cherished
civic institutions.  One obvious casualty is the weakening of
our conviction that the so-called &quot;bourgeois virtues&quot;
are available to all, regardless of race or class.  Early American
social workers, like Mary Ellen Richmond, understood the importance
of middle class norm-setting.  &quot;The way to reintegrate the
deviant into society, she argued, is to educate and indeed direct
them toward the shared values of the mainstream culture.&quot;[8]
<P>
The role of the traditional two-parent family is essential in
sustaining the institutions of a free society precisely because
it is the vehicle by which values are transmitted from generation
to generation.  If the family fails to impart virtues that temper
and restrain behavior, broad legal freedoms must give way.  So,
too, human dignity and equality, as the Founders understood them.
 Virtue, historian Gertrude Himmelfarb has said, is the only true
basis of equality and the only requisite for citizenship.[9]  As
Charles Murray made clear in his now famous op-ed &quot;The Coming
White Underclass,&quot; either we act now to reduce illegitimacy
and to reinfuse our public policy with a commitment to higher
and nobler things -- or we run the risk of sabotaging the entire
experiment in democratic self-government.
<P>
Or, as Michael Novak put it:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>[T]he project of self-government depends on the capacity of citizens
to govern their own passions, urges, habits, and expectations.
 If they cannot govern their own lives individually, how can they
be successful in self-government as a republic?  The project of
self-government is moral -- or not at all.[10]</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
The Founding Fathers and many succeeding generations understood
that only a virtuous people can be free.  Do we?
<P>
Given the consequences for the individual child, the surrounding
community, and the national polity, bringing a baby into this
world without a sense of sacred responsibility cannot long be
regarded as a morally neutral act.  In a report issued in December
1994, the Progressive Policy Institute, policy arm of the Democratic
Leadership Council, joined others in acknowledging that &quot;it
is wrong -- not simply foolish or impractical -- for women and
men to make babies they cannot support emotionally and financially.&quot;[11]
 Donna Shalala made the same concession a year earlier, however
reluctantly, when she said in an interview, &quot;I don't like
to put this in moral terms, but I do believe that having children
out-of-wedlock is wrong.&quot;[12]
<P>
Congress should now recognize that it is also wrong to sanction
such activity by subsidizing it.  Republican strategist Bill Kristol
has said that &quot;neither our politics nor our sociology can
ultimately be neutral as to the content of the _laws of Nature
and Nature's God,_&quot;[13] chief among which is the fact that
we were made to live in families.  Charles Murray asks rhetorically:
 if &quot;a social policy that induces people to believe that
they are not responsible for their lives is one that inhibits
the pursuit of happiness and is to that extent immoral[,] [c]an
then a policy that <I>fails</I> to stigmatize be a moral one?&quot;[14]
<P>
Historical experience, related by Marvin Olasky and others, does
indeed demonstrate that the most effective social services have
been offered by private community groups, without any illusion
of moral neutrality.  In her seminal historical study <I>Poverty
and Compassion</I>, Gertrude Himmelfarb writes that:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>[a]fter making the most arduous attempt to objectify the problem
of poverty, to divorce poverty from any moral assumptions and
conditions, we are learning how inseparable the moral and material
dimensions of that problem are.  And after trying to devise social
policies that are scrupulously neutral and _value-free,_ we are
finding these policies fraught with moral implications that have
grave material and social consequences.[15]</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
George Liebmann says, more simply, in a recent issue of <I>The
American Enterprise</I>, &quot;Rescuing an underclass is by definition
a highly moralistic undertaking.&quot;[16]  While controlling welfare
spending is a happy byproduct of terminating benefits to teen
mothers, even more promising is the opportunity to begin reversing
the message of the counterculture that has so eroded the character
of our people, in part by assaulting the family.
<P>
Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan has used the phrase &quot;defining
deviancy down&quot; to describe Americans' tendency to ignore
excess levels of deviancy by normalizing what used to be considered
pathology.  Only by &quot;defining deviancy down&quot; have we
been able to ignore until now all the signs of impending disaster
that attend a burgeoning illegitimacy rate.  Barbara Whitehead's
1993 <I>Atlantic</I> article heralded a real and significant change
in the public mood, however; and the near-mythic ascendancy of
Charles Murray's &quot;Coming White Underclass&quot; piece the
same year seemed to confirm a general convergence of public opinion.
 In a recent Family Research Council survey of 1,000 Americans,
a substantial majority (81 percent) of respondents indicated that
&quot;women having babies out of wedlock that they can't support
financially&quot; is a serious problem.  The mounting public consensus
presents a unique opportunity to implement more than symbolic
change in the 104th Congress and to make sanctions against illegitimacy
the focus of that change.
<P>
In sending his welfare package to Congress more than 30 years
ago, President Kennedy articulated contemporary liberals' fundamental
misunderstanding of the causal role welfare plays in boosting
illegitimacy rates.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>[W]elfare programs, [he said], must contribute to the attack
on . . . family breakdown [and] illegitimacy. . . .  Unless such
problems are dealt with effectively, they fester, and grow, sapping
the strength of society as a whole and extending their consequences
in troubled families from one generation to the next.[17]</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Kennedy's insight about the consequences has proven historically
accurate; but his &quot;service&quot; approach to curbing illegitimacy
worked no better than the current President's will -- a fact which
an unnamed aide on the Clinton welfare task force acknowledged
last year.
<P>
While the President advocates a massive and expensive public relations
campaign against out-of-wedlock births, his aide confided to <I>Newsweek</I>
reporter Joe Klein: &quot;We looked at a hundred different programs
around the country that were trying to deal with this problem,
and not one of them moved the needle.  There just weren't any
results.&quot;[18]  Likewise, a formal study of the Teenage Parent
Demonstration, sponsored by the Department of Health and Human
Services in response to &quot;persistently high rates of teenage
pregnancies and births,&quot; found that &quot;[t]he program had
an unusual and disappointing pattern of impacts on pregnancy and
birth rates . . . despite . . . the substantial efforts of the
programs to empower [the] young mothers to take control of their
fertility.&quot;[19]
<P>
Charles Murray anticipated the problem in his 1988 book <I>In
Pursuit of Happiness and Good Government</I>.  &quot;The task,&quot;
he concludes, &quot;is not to devise a public relations campaign
to discourage single teenage girls from having babies, but to
neutralize whatever is impeding the age-old impulse of human beings
to form families.&quot;[20]  Eliminating grants to unwed teenage
mothers will be necessary, but not sufficient, to restore the
integrity of the family unit.
<P>
Only by historical accident were unwed mothers -- of any age --
ever included in the AFDC program.  Frances Perkins, President
Roosevelt's Secretary of Labor and chief architect of welfare
policy, opposed extending federal entitlements to unmarried mothers
because she foresaw that subsidizing illegitimacy would escalate
family breakdown.  It would be ironic at best if the current majority
in Congress were to find themselves to the left of the most liberal
member of the Roosevelt Administration because they rejected that
intuition, now confirmed by years of sad experience.  It is the
potential to reverse that sad experience that must define &quot;compassion&quot;
in the present debate.  As the one policy option that promises
to effect change in the current system, restrictions on benefits
by definition constitute the compassionate alternative.
<P>
Himmelfarb notes that the word &quot;compassion&quot; once described
&quot;a moral sentiment, not a political principle, a sentiment
evoked by _misery_ or _sorrow,_ not by poverty as such.&quot;[21]
 As political salvationism sought to preempt traditional morals
in the last 30 years, it was only natural that moral sentiments
should be confused with political principles.  Likewise, that
misery and sorrow should be equated with material poverty; for
the redefinition of compassion required a highly artificial view
of man as no more than a material being.
<P>
If compassion is once again properly understood, perhaps then
it will become more obvious that the object of our concern must
be &quot;misery&quot; and &quot;sorrow,&quot; not economic poverty,
and that the &quot;misery&quot; most evident today is the spiritual
and moral deprivation visited upon dependents of the welfare system.
 It is time that we stop suppressing the moral responsibilities
that make life precious for a resident of the inner city just
the same as for a middle-class suburbanite.  It is time, in short,
to secure equal access to the central satisfactions of family,
virtue, and freedom.

<title>Hot Issues -- Travelgate -- ACU</title>
</head>
<body>
<center><h2>Hot issues<p>Travelgate</h2><br><p></center>
The following letter, from ACU Chairman David A. Keene, was delivered to the United States Senate on September 11, 1996.
<p>
Dear Senator:<p>
On behalf of the one million members and supporters of the American Conservative Union, I urge you to oppose the Levin-Biden amendment to the Treasury-Postal appropriations bill during floor considerations today.<p>
The Levin-Biden amendment would strike the provision providing for financial restitution for Billy Dale, the former head of the White House Travel Office, on the grounds that the measure is a private relief bill.
<p>
But that is not the case.  A private relief bill is legislation that, among other things, names a specific individual who will receive a benefit.  The Treasury-Postal bill contains no such specific reference.  The provision in question merely notes that its purpose is to provide restitution for the wrongly-fired former employees of the White House Travel Office.<p>
What's really going on here is that Senate liberals are trying to get Bill Clinton off the hook.  If they succeed in striking this provision, given the crush of legislative business remaining to be done in the few short weeks before the planned adjournment, Mr. Dale will have to wait until the next Congress to have his legal bills -- now in excess of $500,000 -- paid.  That's just not right.<p>
It wasn't right for Mr. Clinton to fire Mr. Dale in the first place.  It wasn't right for Mr. Dale to be accused and indicted.  It wasn't right for the White House to look over his FBI file seven months <i>after</i> they had fired him.  It wasn't right that Mr. Clinton -- even after a jury acquitted Mr. Dale on all counts in less than two hours, after a two-week trial -- continued to remind the public that Mr. Dale had once considered agreeing to a guilty plea.<p>
And it's not right that Senators Levin and Biden want to protect the president from having to sign this provision into law.<p>
Billy Dale was an innocent man, unjustly accused, who watched his world crumble around him -- all for the sake of political spoils.  His reputation was besmirched, his family humiliated, his integrity challenged.  You can't repair the emotional damage the Clinton White House has inflicted on this man and his family.  But you can help him get one step closer to being financially whole again.  Defeat Levin-Biden, and return to Billy Dale at the very least the money that was taken from him.<p>
Yours Sincerely,<p>
David A. Keene<br>
Chairman<p>

                    The following letter from ACU Chairman, David Keene, was sent to the United States House ofRepresentatives on March 27, 1996:             <P>                  Dear Representative: <P>       On behalf of the one million members and supporters of the American Conservative Union, I urge        you to support HR 1833, the partial birth abortion ban, when it comes to the floor today for a        vote.      <P>          As you know, this bill passed the House last November, and then passed the Senate with slight        modifications.  By passing the Senate version of the legislation today, you will bypass the needfor        a conference committee and send the bill directly to the president's desk.      <P>          One Senate amendment allows the procedure in cases where it is necessary to save the life of the        mother.  And another Senate amendment shifts the burden of proof to prosecutors to demonstrate        that the abortionist had other options available to save the life of the mother (whereas the original        House language had placed the burden of proof on the abortionist to demonstrate that he or she        had no other option).                We believe the Senate amendments are acceptable, and do not deviate from the basic thrust of the        bill:  to prohibit the grisly practice of beginning the delivery of a baby, only to stop when the        baby's head is still inside the mother so as to facilitate killing it.         <P>       Surely a nation as civilized as ours believes itself to be will not tolerate this ghastly activity.                That the pro-abortion lobby has rallied so vociferously against this legislation -- even prompting a        veto threat from the White House -- reveals better than words just how deep is their commitment        to the abortion cause and industry, and shows who are the true "radical extremists" in this policy        debate.                <P>                      Yours sincerely,                          <P>                                    David A.

The following letter from ACU Chairman, David Keene, was sent to the United States House ofRepresentatives on March 28, 1996:                                     <P>                              Dear Representative:     <P>  On behalf of the one million members and supporters of the American Conservative Union, I urge        you to support HR 3103, the "Health Coverage Availability and Affordability Act of 1996,"        during floor consideration today and tomorrow.      <P>          As you know, this bill is a combination of three separate bills -- HR 3103, HR 3070, and HR 995        -- that went through the Ways and Means, Commerce, and Economic Opportunities Committees,        respectively, and was melded together by the Rules Committee yesterday.  <P>              For three years now, as one of the largest grass-roots groups lobbying on the issue of health care        reform, we have held fast to a set of principles for dealing with health care reform.  They are:<P>                1)     Expanding coverage through portability, done on a group-to-group basis;      <P>  2)     Expanding coverage for individuals through encouraging states to create risk pools   for        persons with pre-existing medical conditions;     <P>      3)    Expanding coverage through the creation of Medical Savings Accounts;     <P>      4)     Reducing costs through the imposition of limits on medical malpractice lawsuits;       <P>    5)     Reducing costs through an increase in the deduction for self-employed workers.          <P>      HR 3103 deals with health insurance reform in a reasonable and limited fashion, in a manner        based on several of these principles.  The legislation would provide for portability of health        insurance coverage on a group-to-group basis; would increase the deduction for self-employed        individuals from 30 to 50 percent; would limit medical malpractice claims, a much-neededchange        that would make health insurance more affordable by lowering insurance premiums for healthcare        providers; would encourage, through tax policy, the creation of state-level high-risk pools; and        would authorize MSAs, a provision which conservatives have supported for years as the only        long-term solution of the health insurance problem.      <P>             We can tell you:  this legislation addresses the problems in the health care delivery system in a        limited, reasonable way, and should garner the support of all those wishing to correct somecurrent        inadequacies in the system without allowing for a government take-over of the industry.                     <P>                    Yours sincerely,                  <P>                       David A.

 The following letter was sent from ACU Chairman, David Keene, to the United States Senate on March 27, 1996:   <P>
                                                  Dear Senator:          <P>      On behalf of the one million members and supporters of the American Conservative Union, I urge        you to oppose the Kennedy-Wellstone amendment to raise the minimum wage.            <P>    Economists of all stripes agree that the minimum wage has but one guaranteed effect -- to make        job creation more difficult for those small businesses that are the engine of job growth inAmerica,        and to thereby make getting a job more difficult for those seeking entry-level positions.        <P>        Given that our economy has performed anemically over the last several years -- a direct result of        federal government policies which include burdensome regulations, high taxes, and wasteful        spending programs that take otherwise productive dollars out of the private economy and putthem        into unproductive dollars in the public sector economy -- this hardly seems the right time to be        considering raising the costs of offering a job to a prospective employee.      <P>          Could it be that there's something else going on here?  Perhaps a transparent political payoff toBig        Labor, whose bosses just this week endorsed Bill Clinton for reelection -- the earliest-ever        endorsement by the unions of a candidate for the office?  When you take that into consideration,        and add to it the fact that the AFL-CIO bosses also announced this week their plans to raise an        additional $35 million war chest to target 75 House Republicans (combined with their expected        $400 million in-kind donations to Democratic candidates in this fall's elections), one begins to see        a pattern emerging.      <P>          Don't fall for it.  The minimum wage is a job-killer.  At a time when we need to be creating more        new jobs, not less, don't make it more difficult for small businesses to do so.  Reject union boss        pressure and stay firmly on the side of those millions of workers looking for entry-level positions.     <P>                                 Yours sincerely,    <P>                                                          David A.

<hr>The following letter from ACU Chairman David Keene was delivered to Congress on March 14, 1996:<br>                 
        <p>
     
        Dear Congressman:<br>
        <p>
        On behalf of the more than one million members and supporters of the American
        Conservative Union, I urge you to support HR 2703, &quot;The Effective Death Penalty and
        Public Safety Act of 1996.&quot;<p>
        
        We believe the bill was strengthened by the passage yesterday of the amendment offered
        by Rep. Barr of Georgia.  No longer do we have to fear the U.S. government infringing
        on the constitutional protections of our citizens through wire-tapping crusades conducted
        willy-nilly, and no longer do we have to fear being charged with a crime for selling
        perfectly legal property which may or may not later be used in the commission of a crime.<p>
        
        Don't believe the liberal media, which has reported that the Barr amendment &quot;gutted&quot; or
        &quot;eviscerated&quot; the legislation.  It did not.  It strengthened it, by ensuring that in our desires
        to crack down on crime and terrorism, we are not gutting the constitutional rights of
        American citizens.<p>
        
        I urge you to vote &quot;yes&quot; on HR 2703.<p>

<h2>Hot Issues<p>
Welfare Reform</h2>
<br>
Friday, March 22, 1996
<p>
</center>



<hr>The following letter from ACU Chairman David Keene was delivered to Congress on March 
5, 1996:<br>                 
        <p>
        
        Dear Congressman:<br>
<p>        
        On behalf of the more than one million members and supporters of the American
        Conservative Union, I urge you to support legislation embodying the welfare compromise
        crafted by the National Governors Association.<p>
        
        We believe that, alone of all the possible welfare reform alternatives, the NGA proposal
        passes two critical tests:  it ends the entitlement status of welfare (a reform for which
        conservatives have been fighting for years), and it remains true to the principles of
        federalism (for which conservatives have been fighting for decades).<p>
        
        We understand that several of the leading social conservative groups oppose the NGA
        reform.  As we understand their argument, their opposition to the NGA proposal is
        primarily based on the fact that it doesn't mandate a family cap as established in HR 4.<p>
        
        While it is undeniably true that allowing states to set their own family caps is not as certain
        a method for seeing to their adoption nation-wide as would be mandating a federal family
        cap, it is also undeniably true that 13 states already have enacted family caps on their own,
        and another seven have already applied for the necessary federal waivers to do so.  We
        believe that more and more states would adopt them as their success was demonstrated in
        the states that have taken the lead already.  This is the essence of federalism.<p>
        
        Moreover, the NGA proposal was adopted unanimously at its early February meeting. 
        Why should a Republican-controlled Congress have a problem agreeing to a proposal
        supported by 50 state governors, most of whom are Republicans?  Isn't the essence of
        conservative government the notion that government governs best which governs closest to
        the people?<p>
        
        As Speaker Gingrich said more than a year ago, conservative micromanagement from
        Washington is just as bad as liberal micromanagement from Washington.<p>
        
        Although it is doubtful that President Clinton would sign the NGA compromise -- and it is
        not even necessary to send him a bill -- it is important for the GOP House to go on record
        supporting a proposal supported by all Democratic governors.  The NGA proposal does
        achieve the over-riding strategic goal of welfare reform:  ending the entitlement status of
        the programs, and returning power to the states.  I urge you to support the NGA proposal.<p>
        

<pre>

<h2>Hot Issues<p>
Product Liability Reform</h2>
<br>
Friday, March 22, 1996
<p>
</center>



<hr>The following letter from ACU Chairman David Keene was delivered to the United State Senate on March 
18, 1996:<br>                 
        <p>
     
       
        Dear Senator:<br>
<p>        
        On behalf of the more than one million members and supporters of the American
        Conservative Union, I'm writing today to urge you to vote for cloture tomorrow on the
        product liability conference report, and then to support its final passage.<p>
        
        America's current product liability laws are abused by lawyers seeking to make a &quot;fast
        buck&quot; and so-called consumer organizations seeking to shift blame from consumers to
        others with deep pockets.  The result is to drive up prices, make insurance unaffordable,
        and generally to deprive the public of many products which, when used as the directions
        suggest, are beneficial.<p>
        
        Trial lawyers have argued for years against meaningful reform of product liability laws, on
        the grounds that such changes would make consumers vulnerable to the wishes of so-called
        &quot;rapacious&quot; and &quot;greedy&quot; corporations.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  The
        product liability laws, when amended, would allow those truly to hurt to seek redress.  But
        they would let those of us who do want to buy products, and use them responsibly, to do
        so.<p>
        
        Vote for cloture tomorrow on this important legislation.  And support when it comes to a
        final passage vote.  America's consumers will thank you.<p>
        
           
        <p>

<h2>Hot Issues<p>
Small Business Deregulation</h2>
<br>
Friday, March 22, 1996
<p>
</center>



<hr>The following letter from ACU Chairman David Keene was delivered to the United State Senate on March 
18, 1996:<br>                 
        <p>
        
        Dear Senator:<br>
        <p>
        On behalf of the more than one million members and supporters of the American
        Conservative Union, I urge you to support S. 942, the small business deregulation bill,
        when it comes to the floor tomorrow.<P>
        
        For far too long, America's small businesses -- the engines of economic growth -- have
        been laboring under a stultifying myriad of regulations, increasing the costs of doing
        business and making difficult the creation of new jobs so vital to the growth of our
        economy.<p>
        
        The bill's specific provisions, we believe, are eminently reasonable, and simply make
        common sense.  Waive fines for first-time offenders if the violations are corrected within a
        reasonable time period.  Let small businesses recoup their legal expenses if they win a
        challenge against excessive enforcement of existing regulations.  And give Congress a 45-day window 
        in which to review and reject newly-issued rules.<p>
        
        Support S. 942 tomorrow.  America's millions of small business owners -- and the people
        who want to work for them -- will be watching.<p>

   
 <PRE>
                             Yours sincerely,

        <p>
        Dear Congressman:<BR>
        <P>
        On behalf of the more than one million members and supporters of the American
        Conservative Union, I urge you to support H.Con.Res. 148 when it comes to the floor
        tomorrow.<P>
        
        The United States must send a clear message that it will not stand aside while tyrants bully
        a peaceful, prosperous, pro-American neighbor.<P> 
        
        H.Con.Res. 148 expresses the sense of Congress that the United States should demand that
        the Peoples Republic of China (PRC) live up to its prior promises to resolve differences
        with the Republic of China on Taiwan (ROC) by peaceful means, and that the United
        States should assist in the ROC's defense if the PRC attacks.<P>
        
        For decades, the PRC has relentlessly striven to isolate the ROC from the world
        community. Despite the mainland regime's mean-spirited policy, the ROC is an important,
        influential participant in international affairs. It is one of the few rising democracies in
        East Asia, promoting and protecting economic, political and individual liberty. The ROC's
        national legislature and virtually all provincial and municipal officials are chosen by direct
        popular vote in free elections. This month, for the first time in China's long history, a
        direct popular election for president will occur. The ROC's political and economic
        progress is a textbook model of what bipartisan U.S. policy has always encouraged the
        world over.<P>
        
        Both the PRC and ROC agree that there should be one unified China. Each has long
        claimed to be China's sole legitimate government, but only the ROC has taken positive
        steps toward compromise. It conducts itself under a &QUOT;one China, two governments&QUOT; policy
        while working to resolve other differences case-by-case. Regrettably, recent events again
        underscore the fact that peace derives from strength and only constant pressure and resolve
        make untrustworthy Communists abide by their agreements.<P>
                 
        The Taiwan Relations Act of 1979 does not obligate the U. S. to assist the ROC should it
        become a victim of aggression. H.Con.Res. 148 can be an important step toward
        clarifying ambiguity and focusing the moral and political imperatives for U.S. policy. The
        choice is clear: if ever there was a stark case of &QUOT;good guys&QUOT; and &QUOT;bad guys,&QUOT; this is it. <P>
               
    <p>

<h3>A GUIDE TO KASSEBAUM-KENNEDY</h3>

By John C. Liu<br>

Issue Bulletin No. 222<br>

<p>
<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Both houses of Congress soon will consider sweeping legislation affecting the way millions of Americans get their health insurance. In the Senate, the chief sponsors of the Health Insurance Reform Act of 1995 (S. 1028) are Senators Nancy Kassebaum (R-KS) and Edward Kennedy (D-MA).<sup>1</sup>  In the House, Representative Dennis Hastert (R-IL) is coordinating the efforts to introduce an improved version of the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill.<sup>2</sup>  Both bills are intended to address a recurring and legitimate concern among millions of working Americans who currently have employment-based health insurance:  the threat of losing private health insurance when they lose or change their jobs, or try to obtain coverage when they have a pre-existing medical condition. But while the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill contains some useful provisions, it also contains serious flaws -- many of which would be corrected by incorporating language based on the House proposal.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Anxiety about health insurance coverage stems from the very nature of today's employment-based system. Typically, workers and their dependents are covered by an employer-based health insurance policy only as long as they remain with the same employer, and for just a short time afterwards. If a worker is laid off or takes a job with a different employer, the family may encounter pre-existing condition exclusions or different health care providers. If the worker joins a firm with no group insurance plan and buys his own coverage, he receives no tax breaks for purchasing that policy -- compared with generous tax relief if an employer obtains and owns the coverage. Lawmakers thus need to address two fundamental problems in trying to fix the broken health insurance market: 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>1.)</b> Health insurance is the only type of insurance tied to the place of employment. Other major forms of insurance such as homeowners, mortgage, and life are not normally tied to a worker's place of employment. The reason health insurance is employer-based today is that federal tax relief for insurance is available only to workers who obtain insurance through their place of work. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>2.)</b> The tax code effectively limits workers and their families to only one type of insurance option:  employer-based health insurance. Insurance market reforms do not resolve this underlying problem with a distorted health insurance market.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Kassebaum-Kennedy bill (S. 1028), as reported out of committee, is flawed legislation. While S. 1028 avoids the price controls and huge tax increases found in both the Clinton plan and other bills introduced in the last Congress, it contains vague provisions for federal regulation of the health insurance market, a responsibility traditionally left to the states. S. 1028 gives the Secretary of Health and Human Services disturbingly broad powers in this area.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Instead of just trying to guarantee Americans the right to purchase health insurance, Congress should take careful steps to make sure that Americans of all incomes, health status, and employment status have the ability to buy into the health care market.<sup>3</sup>  Therefore, Congress should focus on:
<p><ul>
<li> Group to group portability;<p>
<li> Limiting pre-existing condition exclusions upon losing employer-based coverage;<p>
<li> Reasonable mechanisms to allow small employers and legitimate associations to pool together to get better prices;<p>
<li> Tax equity for individuals and families seeking health insurance outside an employer setting; and<P>
<li> Full income tax deductibility for the self-employed increased to 100 percent.
</ul> <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In his 1996 State of the Union message, President Bill Clinton emphasized that the goal of S. 1028 is to end the loss of portable health insurance among millions of workers and their dependents.<sup>4</sup>  The issue of portability of insurance is a broad concern among Republicans and Democrats alike. S. 1028 is a well-intentioned attempt to address it, as well as the problem of pre-existing conditions. The bill also makes improvements in the areas of guaranteed availability and portability of group coverage. Unfortunately, for jurisdictional and procedural reasons, Senate rules have prevented the addition of several key health care reform components necessary to allow individuals, rather than the companies they work for, to own their health insurance policies. If it is Congress's intention to give workers and their families true portability of health insurance, lawmakers must correct the inherent flaws and inequities that are the unintended consequences of an inequitable federal tax code that penalizes the working poor and self-employed.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Thus, even though the Senate measure does contain extensive federal regulation of the individual health insurance market, intended to address portability, it lacks the key financial incentive to persuade healthy individuals to purchase health insurance in a timely fashion. Unless Congress is willing to address the core problem of today's health insurance system -- the federal tax code -- health insurance reform will fall far short of its goals.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The widespread fear of losing employment-based health insurance emerged as the driving force behind the health care debate during the 103rd Congress. An analysis of the March 1994 Current Population Survey showed that 55.3 percent of the uninsured population in 1993 were uninsured because they had lost their jobs or changed jobs.<sup>5</sup>  That insecurity stems from the design of today's employer-based health insurance system, itself the product of perverse incentives created by the federal tax code.<sup>6</sup>  Others worry about not having any form of insurance from their current employer.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The best way to achieve portability is to give Americans ownership and control of the financing of health benefits. Where appropriate, financial assistance should be given to low-income working families to help pay for basic care in the form of vouchers or tax credits. If individuals and families are allowed to comparison shop among a variety of health plans and benefit levels offered through their employer, a private organization, or an individual policy, costs can be controlled. True portability also can be achieved, because Americans will no longer face the possibility of losing their health insurance based on a change in job, loss of job, or pre-existing condition. 

<p>
<b>WHAT S. 1028 WOULD DO</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Kassebaum-Kennedy bill would create a uniform federal standard for health insurance that is intended to increase the portability of private health insurance policies. Under the legislation, individuals with employment-based health insurance would be able to maintain coverage while changing jobs. In the area of group coverage, the bill would reduce the length of exclusions for pre-existing conditions by crediting enrollees for maintaining continuous coverage through a previous employer. Furthermore, insurers and employers would be prevented from excluding employees from an employer's group health plan based on their medical status or experience.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The proposal also would create a new state-based system of health plan purchasing cooperatives (HPPCs) intended to give small businesses and individuals greater purchasing power in negotiating more favorable rates from insurance carriers and other health plan providers.

<p>
<b>A Limit on Pre-Existing Conditions</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Kassebaum-Kennedy bill places a restriction on the ability of health plans and employers to limit or deny coverage in group health insurance plans to 12 months for medical conditions diagnosed in the previous 6 months. A time credit is applied against the preexisting condition period by reducing it one month for each month that a worker and his dependents were continuously covered under a previous group health plan. In addition, the bill:
<P><ul>
<li> Places a ban on further preexisting condition exclusions by any insurer once a worker has been continuously insured for a minimum of 12 months. Thus, workers who change jobs or insurance plans would no longer be subject to waiting periods.
<p>
<li> Prohibits health plans and employers from canceling or providing coverage to any employee in the employer group plan based on a preexisting condition or health status.
<p>
<li> Promotes wellness programs by allowing employers and group health plans to provide discounts to employees who participate in activities (approved by state insurance regulators) designed to promote healthy behavior, prevent or delay the onset of illness, or provide for screening or early detection of an illness.
</ul> <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The guaranteed availability and renewability of health insurance in S. 1028 would alleviate the portability problem facing workers who want to change jobs. This is a welcome and long-overdue improvement in today's health insurance market.
<P>

<b>Group Purchasing Arrangements (Health Plan Purchasing Cooperatives)</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
S. 1028 attempts to make health insurance more affordable for small employers and self-employed workers by enabling them to purchase coverage as part of a larger group. The rationale is that small businesses generally pay higher per capita premiums than larger businesses because they lack economies of scale and the power to bargain. Under current law, when an employee or dependent incurs expensive claims, typically the employer's premiums increase sharply the following year, in many cases pricing that group out of the insurance market. The danger to the worker and his family occurs when a health plan provider drops the small employer from coverage, or the employer excludes the particular employee from the group plan due to his previous year's claims experience.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The bill attempts to correct this problem by promoting small group purchasing arrangements. Referred to as Health Plan Purchasing Cooperatives (HPPCs), they are private, voluntary coalitions/alliances developed to purchase health insurance and negotiate with providers and health plans. State laws prohibiting the formation of such HPPCs are preempted. Under the bill, HPPCs would require state certification and would have to be registered with the U.S. Department of Labor. In addition to purchasing insured products on behalf of members, HPPCs would not be permitted to bear risk,<sup>7</sup> although they would be given discretion in determining the eligibility requirements for employers and whether or not to include individuals -- as long as the individual's health status is not a factor.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
To facilitate the formation of HPPCs, and to get them to be active participants in the health insurance market, S. 1028 provides for a limited preemption of state insurance rating laws with respect to group health plans and individual health plans offered by health insurance carriers through HPPCs.<sup>8</sup>  Health plans purchased through other avenues, however, would remain subject to state small group rating requirements, which require carriers to pool all small group businesses for rating purposes. Thus, the Senate bill creates different rules for different insurance arrangements.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>An Uneven Playing Field.</b> By exempting HPPCs from state small employer group rating laws, Congress would be creating an incentive for small businesses with healthier than average employees to seek out coverage under a HPPC that has procured rate discounts:  Businesses could do this on any basis other than the health status and demographics of the HPPC's members. But there is a significant problem:  Without the premium payments from these healthy employer groups, others seeking coverage through non-HPPC arrangements could face higher than normal rates in a pool dominated by unhealthy employer groups. The Senate bill, in other words, could end up compounding the market distortions in a sector already distorted by an inequitable federal tax code. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Unfortunately, the legislative language creating HPPCs would lead to an uneven playing field against commercial insurance companies not selling products through HPPCs. While insurance premiums in the non-HPPC market no doubt would be higher than those in the HPPCs as a result of this provision, it is not definite how severe the impact would be. Congress would be wise to ensure that an even playing field exists in the health insurance market so that competition among health plan providers is fair. At a minimum, Congress should amend S. 1028 so that all health plans, whether issued through a HPPC or though a non-HPPC, are exempted from state rating requirements. Members of Congress should not worsen the distortions in health insurance markets through federal legislation.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Some in Congress have expressed an interest in enacting a blanket federal preemption of any state-mandated benefit laws that would apply solely to HPPCs. State-mandated benefit laws have added to the cost of insurance, rendering policies unaffordable for many small businesses and individuals. While it is perfectly understandable that Members would want to protect small businesses and individuals purchasing insurance through a HPPC from burdensome and costly state mandates, any preemption of state mandated benefit laws, however well-intentioned, should be applied to all forms of health coverage, HPPCs and non-HPPCs alike. A better approach would be to preempt state laws which:
<P><ul>
<li> Require health insurance policies to cover specific diseases, services, or providers;<P>
<li> Limit the ability of managed care plans to contract selectively with health care providers; or<p>
<li> Limit the ability of managed care plans to impose higher cost-sharing provisions on treatment obtained from providers outside a plan's network.<sup>9</sup>
</ul><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Lower premiums are a desirable goal. However, it would be extremely unwise of Congress to distort the health insurance market further by placing HPPC plans at a marketing advantage over non-HPPC plans. As drafted, the potential for HPPCs' gaining monopoly status is very real because of the legislative language creating these new entities. Although not theoretically exclusive, as under the Clinton health plan, these geographically based HPPCs might become the exclusive means for individuals and employers to obtain fully insured health coverage, if premium rates negotiated by the HPPC are less than those otherwise permitted under state law.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In this respect, Members of Congress should recall the ill-fated "managed competition" legislation introduced in 1994 by former Congressmen Jim Cooper (D-TN) and Fred Grandy (R-IA).<sup>10</sup>  Among other things, this health insurance reform proposal also would have established state-based health insurance purchasing cooperatives.<sup>11</sup>  While individual and family enrollment in these HPPCs supposedly would have been voluntary, the regulatory infrastructure and tax code revisions set up in the Cooper-Grandy plan eventually would have forced small businesses and individuals into such entities. Consistent with the managed competition model in the Cooper-Grandy plan, HPPCs under S. 1028 would be required to enroll all employers and individuals within a geographic area as determined by the state. If S. 1028 were enacted into law as reported out of the Senate Labor Committee, the combination of new federal rules with existing state insurance rules could make employee enrollment in HPPCs the only practical choice for insurance coverage. Workers and their families therefore would lose a large measure of personal choice in health plans.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Most significantly, current ERISA regulations do not prohibit states from establishing voluntary purchasing cooperatives.<sup>12</sup>  Congress should not create a regulatory infrastructure that could establish the groundwork for making such HPPCs mandatory within a state. The danger is that the instability created by the federally designed HPPCs would lead to further federal regulation to "correct" the problem -- resulting in still further problems. The result:  Congress, by degrees, would create a system of purchasing cooperatives similar to those found in the Clinton Health Security Act, which required every American to obtain health insurance through these alliances.

<p>
<b>Group-to-Individual Coverage</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;S. 1028 does take some of the first steps needed to construct a consumer-based health insurance framework -- even though other provisions conflict with this goal. Subtitle B does this by setting up an infrastructure to facilitate individual health plan portability. Insurance carriers that sell individual health plans are required to issue individual coverage when the following criteria have been met:
<p><ul>
<li> Individuals a) must have been covered previously under an employment-based health plan, b) must have paid health insurance premiums on a continuous basis without a gap in coverage of 30 days or more, and c) must have been covered for at least 18 months;<P>

<li> Individuals must not be eligible for coverage under an employee health benefit plan or group health plan, such as one offered by a new employer or by a parent's or spouse's employer;
<p>
<li> Individuals must have exhausted their eligibility for COBRA<sup>13</sup> continuation coverage (which is available for a minimum of 18 months to over 80 percent of individuals receiving employment-based coverage); and
<p>
<li> Individuals must not reside in a state which has adopted a high-risk pool or other means of covering individuals unable to maintain health coverage. 
</ul> <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Guaranteed issue and the availability of insurance in the individual market are addressed by forbidding insurance carriers to determine coverage or establish eligibility, continuation, or enrollment requirements based on health status, medical condition, claims experience, or medical history. Without these rules governing the group-to-individual conversion, the portability of health insurance will not be achieved. Under current law, individuals switching from an employer who offers insurance coverage to an employer who does not offer coverage would simply lose this benefit.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The bill also puts rules in place for health insurance carriers to ensure their financial stability and solvency. An insurance carrier or other health plan provider offering coverage to individuals under an individual health plan may deny applicants if the health plan ceases to enroll any new individuals. A carrier also may do so if it can demonstrate to the state that its financial or provider capacity to serve previously covered individuals will be impaired if the state requires it to enroll additional individuals.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Concerns have been raised about how these provisions would affect premium costs.<sup>14</sup>  Some critics of S. 1028's group-to-individual portability provision say that insurance premiums in the individual market would increase sharply, perhaps in the range of 10 to 15 percent.<sup>15</sup>  But the American Academy of Actuaries, the national organization representing actuaries of all specialties in the United States, says the increase in premiums would be quite small, ranging between 2 and 5 percent.<sup>16</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Since S. 1028 does not impose strict community rating requirements, or otherwise impose price caps on the premiums that insurers may charge individuals,<sup>17</sup> some insurance executives, such as those with one of the leading insurance trade associations, fear that the guaranteed-issue requirement for individuals with prior coverage would "make individual health insurance unaffordable over time."<sup>18</sup>  This concern is premised upon two assumptions:  1) that only unhealthy individuals will purchase health insurance, thereby increasing the likelihood of adverse selection in the individual market; and 2) that absent significant public subsidies, healthy individuals will not purchase insurance before they need it.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Because both consumer choice and competition are frustrated in a health insurance system that is predominantly employment-based, these concerns about insurance costs in the individual market are legitimate in today's tax climate. Since health insurance is entirely optional, those who purchase health insurance on their own must pay the entire cost of the premiums with after-tax dollars. Thus, healthier than average individuals would be more likely to decline insurance in a voluntary market, while unhealthy persons could see an economic benefit in getting coverage. A guaranteed-issue requirement in the individual market would lead to higher premiums since unhealthy people would comprise a disproportionate share of the market. While concerns about rising premiums in the individual insurance market are justified, Congress can and should address this potential problem by providing consumers with financial assistance to help offset any possible increase.
<p>
<b>HOW CONGRESS CAN IMPROVE S. 1028</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
While the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill makes improvements in the existing health insurance system, there are several provisions which should be strengthened. Without further changes, the laudable intentions of this legislation will not be realized in good public policy. Millions of Americans are painfully aware of the weaknesses in the current system. The Senate Committee on Labor correctly diagnosed the problem:  "[M]illions of Americans are at risk of becoming uninsured or subject to preexisting condition exclusions under the current system because they change jobs, lose jobs, or work for employers who change insurance policies."<sup>19</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Certain key policy changes can improve insurance reform legislation and better achieve the goal of portability and security in health insurance. These changes, as proposed in the House legislation, include tax equity for non-employer-based health insurance, medical savings accounts (MSAs), increased deductibility for purchasing health insurance for the self-employed, a clarification of the ERISA laws making it easier for smaller employers and individuals to pool and gain leverage in the insurance market, and medical malpractice reforms.

<p>
<b>Tax Equity Would Offset Most Adverse Effects in the Individual Market </b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;As noted, policy analysts and insurance industry executives have raised concerns over the effects that guaranteed issue and guaranteed renewability could have on premiums in the individual insurance market. Under the current system, unhealthy individuals leaving employment-based coverage find COBRA either the preferable or perhaps the only alternative to being uninsured. Healthy individuals have the luxury of making an economic decision to go with no coverage or purchase an individual-based policy with after-tax income. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
To the extent that Members of Congress remain concerned about a potential increase in premiums, they should re-examine the core problem behind today's health insurance system -- the federal tax code. Congress should provide an incentive for healthy employees to enroll in the individual market by giving them tax equity. This means giving individuals who purchase their own health insurance policies the same tax treatment as workers who get their health insurance through their employers. As drafted, the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill would not help college graduates entering the job market for the first time who end up working for small start-up businesses unable to offer health insurance. To fix this problem, Members of Congress need to look no further than the health-related tax provisions passed overwhelmingly by both houses of Congress in the Balanced Budget Act of 1995. A majority of today's uninsured population is made up of the self-employed, those working for small firms, or young individuals. These groups are affected by the distortions in an employer-based health insurance system and are the ones typically suffering from the absence of portability and ownership.
<p>
<b> Introduce medical savings accounts (MSAs).</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
MSAs would enable group-to-individual conversions to have a widespread impact on today's uninsured population. While there are other comprehensive forms of tax equity Congress could consider (such as tax credits and 100 percent deductions for the self-employed), MSAs would be a good start. They would provide sufficient incentive for healthy individuals to purchase insurance, thereby creating a solid and solvent risk pool that offsets the claims of future unhealthy enrollees. MSAs could be constructed as passed earlier this Congress:
<P><ul>
	<li>	Contributions of up to $2,000 for individuals and $4,000 for families, including employer contributions, would be 100 percent deductible from adjusted gross income;
<p>
	<li>	Interest earned on the income would be subject to taxation;
<p>
	<li>	Withdrawals made for non-medical expenditures would be included in the individual's gross income and subject to a 10 percent tax prior to age 59-and-a-half;
<p>
	<li>	Upon reaching age 59-and-a-half, the individual could make withdrawals for any purpose without the 10 percent tax;
<p>
	<li>	In order for a health plan to be classified as such, at a minimum it would have to provide catastrophic coverage in which the minimum deductible for individuals is $1,500 and $3,000 for families.
<p></ul>
<b> Increase and expand tax deductions.</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Under current law, self-employed individuals are permitted to deduct 30 percent of the amount paid for health insurance for themselves and their dependents. While a 30 percent deduction provides some tax relief for the nation's self-employed, the federal tax code still provides significant tax advantages for employees by exempting company-sponsored benefits from any federal income or payroll taxes (FICA), as well as from state and local taxes. In addition to pre-existing condition exclusion barriers, the availability of this tax exclusion for workers is one of the major impediments facing employees seeking to leave and start their own businesses. Congress should remove this bias, and also encourage creation of a sound individual-based health insurance market, by increasing the deduction for health insurance of self-employed individuals and their families.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Earlier this year, Congress passed legislation which would have increased the 30 percent deduction to 50 percent between 1996 and 2002. This proposal was vetoed by President Clinton. While a 100 percent deduction would provide tax fairness for all individuals and the self-employed, even a compromise of 50 percent would represent substantial progress.
As a condition of regulating private insurance at the federal level, consider pre-empting state mandated benefit laws. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The health insurance industry is one of the most highly regulated sectors of the American economy. Before an insurance carrier or health plan provider is allowed to enter and do business within a state, it must satisfy a litany of state requirements and regulations. Regulation of health insurance is usually within the jurisdiction of the states, not the federal government. A key component of state regulation is the imposition of mandated benefits on insurance carriers licensed to do business within their jurisdictions. These mandates are the product of intense special-interest lobbying at the state level, where medical specialists, marriage and family counselors, therapists, and other professionals have succeeded in imposing coverage requirements. Over the years, the number and scope of these benefits have grown substantially, adding to the cost of insurance plans sold to employers and individuals. Nationwide, there are over 1,000 such state mandates, ranging from in vitro fertilization to chiropractic care and psychological counseling. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In principle, Congress should refrain from regulating health insurance at the federal level. But with S. 1028, Congress is doing precisely that, arguing that the weaknesses of the current insurance market (the absence of portability and the growing numbers of uninsured) outweigh adherence to the principles of federalism. If Congress decides to regulate the individual health insurance market, sponsors of S. 1028 should seek at least a net deregulation of the market by preempting state mandated benefit laws. In return for preemption, Congress may seek to require catastrophic coverage as a consumer protection measure. This would substantially reduce both the regulatory burden and the cost of insurance for small businesses which employ a majority of the uninsured population.
<p>
<b> Avoid a Clinton-style standardized benefits package.</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Congress should refrain from imposing any requirements that health plans cover a particular benefit, medical procedure, or service. Several Senators favor requiring health plans to cover specifically defined medical benefits. But while such a proposal is appealing on a superficial level, this approach guarantees higher costs and unintended long-term consequences. Like the Clinton plan, a standardized benefits package forces all individuals to buy benefits they neither want nor need. It does not take into account the different medical needs and desires of individuals and families. While some Americans may want and can afford the inclusion of comprehensive and expensive benefits, millions of others -- especially younger, less well off, and healthier individuals -- may not. If a worker or family member suffers from a particular disease that is not included in the standardized benefits package, that person could be medically worse off if the required extra service he needs is unaffordable.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Specific benefits invariably are required if a Hollywood movie star or celebrity is willing to take up the cause of persons with a particular disease, replete with an appropriately colored ribbon.<sup>20</sup>  During the debate over the Clinton health plan and its variants in 1994, congressional staff, Representatives, and Senators were inundated with office visits, mail, faxes, and phone calls asking that a particular benefit or service be covered. If the group of patients is large and powerful enough, perhaps with the aid of a celebrity, it is likely that the benefit will be added by Congress. Supporters of mandated benefits should be honest about the unintended consequences that come with a mandated benefits package -- higher premiums and the politicization of diseases.
<p>
<b> Do not remove "lifetime limits" from employer-sponsored health benefit plans.</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Some Members of Congress are considering a prohibition on "lifetime limit" provisions in private health insurance plans as a way to protect patients facing high medical expenses due to catastrophic illnesses. The danger is that such a rule would raise employers' health care costs. For some companies, the extra cost could be severe enough to prevent a plan from being offered or continued, thus exposing the patient to 100 percent of all medical bills, including catastrophic claims.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Lifetime limits are necessary to help private insurance companies meet solvency standards required by the states. The same principle already applies to government health programs. For example, the Medicare Hospital Insurance (HI) Part A Trust Fund imposes a lifetime limit on two major services:  hospitalization (150 days) and skilled nursing facility care (100 days). It is all but certain that if such a rule were applied to Medicare Part A, the Trust Fund would be insolvent long before the projected date of 2002.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;While studies have estimated the cost of eliminating lifetime caps would be an additional 2.3 percent for employers,<sup>21</sup> the findings do not take into account the added cost of prohibiting separate "inside limits" on specific categories of services already contained within existing policies. Without lifetime and inside limitations in health insurance policies, many small to mid-sized employers would be unable to purchase any type of health plan for their employees. As pointed out by the Association of Private Pension and Welfare Plans (APPWP), a majority of employer-based health benefit plans include "inside limits" on certain benefits and services:<sup>22</sup> 
<p><blockquote>
	The Standard Option benefit package offered to federal government employees enrolled in the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP) includes a limit of one hospital inpatient treatment program per lifetime for alcohol, drug, and substance abuse.
<p>
	The Segal Company's "1994 Survey of State Employee Health Benefit Plans" also reports that 35 states included "separate annual/lifetime maximums" for mental health and/or substance abuse treatment.
</blockquote><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The strongest cost argument in favor of outlawing lifetime limits is that average increases in premiums for employers would be modest. But the American Academy of Actuaries (AAA) has cited several consequences that make the removal of lifetime limitation provisions financially unattractive. One is the "[p]otential for increased health care inflation, potential pressure to liberalize limited benefit structures in public programs, and the potential impact on reinsurance companies and insurer premiums."<sup>23</sup>  Another unintended consequence of repealing lifetime limits would be the added cost taxpayers would be forced to bear for the approximately 18.2 million federal, state, and local government employees. A majority of health plans covering government employees already have lifetime limit provisions, and many also contain additional inside limits. While lifetime caps appear onerous, they give employers who voluntarily offer health benefit plans reason to believe that these plans will remain affordable.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Lifetime caps are but one health benefit design feature that allows employers to offer the level of benefits they can afford. During consideration of the Clinton plan, Congress and the American people rejected mandating the level of benefits that employers must provide to their employees. The issue of employer-provided health benefits is a matter best left to employers and employees. Private employers and employees, not Congress, should decide what level of benefits they can afford. Congress should avoid piecemeal additions to benefit packages based on pressure from health industry groups. If Congress bows to pressure from such groups, employers will be forced to scale back or drop the benefits they provide to accommodate a repeal of lifetime limits. Employees and their families will receive fewer benefits, and this will lead to calls for additional mandated benefits, further increasing health care costs. This unnecessary yet inevitable circle of events is sure to be triggered if Congress gets into the perennially unfinished business of benefit setting. 
<p>
<b> Consider medical malpractice reform.</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
While there are federalism concerns involved in legislating malpractice reforms at the federal level, an urgent need exists to confront the liability problem. The federal government funds approximately half the nation's health care expenditures through Medicare, Medicaid, Veterans Administration, Indian, and Public Health programs; and medical malpractice and other liability costs, driven by pro-plaintiff state laws, have contributed to these already large costs. In fact, medical malpractice costs have contributed greatly to increased medical costs in both the public and private sectors.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In connection with medical malpractice litigation, the current legal system allows unlimited compensation for non-economic damages. Non-economic damages are separate from, and do not include compensation for, medical costs, rehabilitative costs, foregone wages, or other out-of-pocket expenses. During the first session of the 104th Congress, the House of Representatives passed legislation to limit non-economic damages associated with medical malpractice. Significant provisions of the reform included a $250,000 limit on non-economic damages and the option to pay future losses exceeding $50,000 in periodic increments. The Senate should carefully consider the House medical malpractice reform provisions while encouraging substantive reforms at the state level.
<p>
<b> Place no more power and control in the hands of the Secretary of Health and Human Services.</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Section 110 of S. 1028 requires insurance companies and other health plan issuers to guarantee issue coverage, without any exclusion of coverage for pre-existing conditions, to individuals who meet certain requirements related to prior group coverage. Section 111 requires guaranteed renewal of all individual health plans. Section 112 allows states to be exempt from the requirements of Sections 110 and 111 if, and only if, they have in place (or subsequently put in place) an alternative law or program that meets the same goals and is approved by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In evaluating whether a state meets the goals, the Secretary of HHS is to evaluate state programs according to the four criteria:
<P>
1) Whether the state law or program provides coverage to individuals leaving group coverage;<p>
2) Whether the state law or program provides coverage for preexisting conditions for individuals leaving group coverage;<p>
3) Whether the state law or program provides individuals leaving group coverage with a choice of health plans or a health plan providing comprehensive coverage; and<p>

4) Whether requiring a state to comply with Sections 110 and 111 would have an adverse impact on the number of individuals in the state who have access to affordable health insurance coverage.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Among insurance experts, there is a wide range of estimates on how much premiums in the individual health insurance market actually would increase under S. 1028. Rather than mandate a single uniform approach, as called for in Section 112, Congress should allow the various states to experiment with alternative approaches and methods. States should determine for themselves the best way to guarantee continued availability of health coverage to their residents leaving the group market. To date, 11 states already have enacted guaranteed issue requirements in the individual market.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Section 112 vests enormous power in the Secretary of Health and Human Services. The Secretary, in effect, can disapprove legitimate state initiatives that address the problem of how to guarantee continuation of coverage for individuals and families. For instance, the Secretary could rule that state high-risk pools are not "affordable" because their premiums are higher than prevailing market rates, even though significant subsidies are required to cover the true costs of enrollees. Under this scenario, most states' high-risk pools could be found "unaffordable" and unacceptable to the Secretary.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Instead of allowing the Secretary to control how states regulate their individual insurance markets (a traditional state function), S. 1028 should allow the state insurance commissioner (or the official or officials designated by the state to enforce the goals of this legislation) to determine whether the alternative state law or program meets the goals of S. 1028. No review or approval by the Secretary of HHS should be required.
<p>
<b> Reject Section 121's extension of COBRA.</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Section 121 of S. 1028 changes COBRA (P.L. 99-272) by allowing individuals who have disabled family members, or who become disabled at any time during their coverage under an initial COBRA extension period, to extend their coverage for the additional 11 months. Currently, this extension is available only to workers who are disabled at the time they lose their coverage.<sup>24</sup>  Today, coverage under COBRA may last from 18 to 36 months, depending on the circumstances of the event leading to loss of health insurance. Under current law, covered employees and dependents are required to pay up to 102 percent of the total premium during the 18-month period. Disabled employees and dependents are eligible for 29 months of continued coverage but then must pay up to 150 percent of the total premium during the additional 11 months.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
While the extension of COBRA sounds appealing to Members of Congress and the public, the reality is that employers, and ultimately workers, are required to pay the actual claims costs incurred by employees opting for coverage under COBRA. In short, such a change is another employer mandate. This extra expense has been particularly burdensome on employers already struggling to give health benefits to their current employees. According to the Employee Benefit Research Institute, a nonpartisan public policy research organization specializing in employee benefits, "many employers consider COBRA to be a costly mandate. Any expansion of COBRA would almost certainly increase employer cost for health insurance."<sup>25</sup>  And according to the Blue Cross/Blue Shield Association, "Claims costs for COBRA subscribers, on average, are typically 40 percent to 60 percent higher than the costs of active employees. Those people who seek COBRA coverage are people who need, but cannot obtain, affordable coverage as individuals, and their high use of medical services is directly reflected in the unusually high COBRA claims costs."<sup>26</sup>  These higher than average costs, which must be borne by employers, will lead inevitably to a reduction in employee benefits and compensation, or to withdrawal from the market.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Suggestions have been made that S. 1028's COBRA provision be extended to all companies. Placing additional mandates on small employers (less than 20 employees) could jeopardize protections for beneficiaries of self-funded ERISA health plans. For example, small employers who insure their employees under federal ERISA requirements have been able to avoid costly state-mandated benefits and taxes on their health plans. It would be ironic for Members of Congress to impose a new layer of federal mandates on a class of employers who have sought protection and relief from state mandates. Furthermore, such an unprecedented reach of federal regulatory power would preempt many of the innovative and effective health reform measures that states have developed and implemented themselves. Finally, the costs associated with such an extension would be too large for small businesses operating on a slim profit margin to bear.<sup>27</sup>
<p>
<b> Replace the Senate HPPCs with House provisions encouraging multiple employer health plans.</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The HPPCs in the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill as drafted are vague and will generate intrusive and burdensome federal regulations. Congress should strike this newly created infrastructure and replace it with provisions that would encourage the use of multiple employer health plans, voluntary health insurance associations, and other fully insured arrangements. Legislation to accomplish this (HR. 995) has been proposed by Representative Harris Fawell (R-IL).<sup>28</sup>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The goal of giving small businesses and individuals increased purchasing power in the health insurance market is shared by a vast majority of Members of Congress. Unfortunately, S. 1028 creates an additional federal regulatory framework in setting up its HPPCs while simultaneously placing them at a competitive advantage over non-HPPC plans in the health insurance market. Lawmakers should be cautious in supporting legislation which, in its present form, easily could turn the health insurance market into a government-run entity at either the state or federal levels, reproducing something that looks and works like President Clinton's Health Security Act.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In stark contrast, Title III of the Fawell bill would allow smaller businesses to join together under the auspices of ERISA to purchase fully insured coverage or to cover their employees under self-insured multiple employer health plans (MEHPs).<sup>29</sup>  Since 85 percent of the uninsured population are in families headed by a worker,<sup>30</sup> it is significant that Title III of the Fawell proposal seeks to use ERISA to preempt state laws that prohibit two or more employers from obtaining fully insured health insurance coverage under any fully insured multiple employer arrangement.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In addition to providing smaller employers and individuals with increased purchasing power, the Fawell proposal eliminates the confusion surrounding the responsibilities of the states and the U.S. Department of Labor under ERISA. This confusion has led to a cottage industry of fly-by-night insurance swindlers who hide behind the ERISA preemption clause. Ironically, states that have enacted statutes regulating legitimate self-insured multiple employer plans often have hurt legitimate arrangements meeting the ERISA plan definitions and caused such arrangements to dissolve. These state actions have been arbitrary and do not follow any consistent pattern of reasoning, either within a state or among states. To remedy this situation, Title III of the Fawell proposal would give states a consistent guideline for the regulation of legitimate ERISA multiple employer plans wishing to continue their operations.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Title III also would give legitimate self-insured associations (including but not limited to church plans, franchise networks, associations, certain large employers, and collectively bargained plans) two clear and distinct regulatory options. First, legitimate associations could maintain or establish multiple employer health plans by seeking licensure in the states permitting such practices. Alternatively, these plans could seek federal certification pursuant to the "exemption" provision in current ERISA law. Under Title III of the Fawell proposal, entities that are created for the express purpose of purchasing health insurance would automatically be subject to the laws of the state in which they seek to do business. In turn, the states could make these groups meet any state-defined insurance or multiple employer plan licensing requirements state.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
While smaller employers and individuals are at a disadvantage as they attempt to negotiate premium rates with insurance carriers, this does not necessitate the creation of new entities and additional federal regulations as prescribed in the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill. Accordingly, the Fawell proposal gives smaller employers and the self-employed the right to take advantage of the "[e]conomies of scale that large employers and multi-union employer plans have had for years under ERISA [to gain] access to affordable insurance."<sup>31</sup>  Unlike the uneven playing field created in S. 1028, the Fawell proposal would help ensure the ability of traditional insurance carriers to compete with self-insured plans for the small employer, self-employed, and individual market.

<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
S. 1028 enjoys broad bipartisan support in the Senate. In Congress, there is a strong desire to reform the broken health insurance market. S. 1028 is a well-intentioned effort to address the portability problem that confronts millions of workers and their families. While the creation of group-to-individual conversion is a positive step toward making health insurance more portable, its impact is diminished by the creation of additional regulatory distortions in the health insurance market. It is unfortunate that S. 1028 fails to address the tax system that currently impedes the ability of the market to function, and that it opens up the dangers of new distortions and sources of instability.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Over 80 percent of Americans under age 65 are covered by health insurance. While they generally are satisfied with their coverage, a genuine fear exists that this security could be lost. Reform of the health insurance market should address the source of this fear -- the fact that health insurance is predominantly employment-based and that federal tax policy exclusively favors this type of arrangement. This Senate bill does not address the key problems confronting the millions of Americans seeking to gain access to the health insurance market. The sponsors of S. 1028 attempt, instead, to create a transitional phase from group (employer-based) to individual coverage through federal regulation. Despite its drawbacks, however, S. 1028 could be the vehicle for significant health insurance reform, including the individual ownership of health insurance plans. By incorporating the improvements offered in the House proposal, S. 1028 could advance the security of health insurance for millions of working families. Instead of distorting the health insurance market with unnecessary and detrimental regulations, Members of Congress should promote a free-market policy by creating a health insurance system that is driven by consumer choice and genuine competition.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The health insurance market is one that traditionally has been regulated at the state level. Any congressional reform should not hamper the successes and innovations produced by state initiatives. To its sponsors' credit, S. 1028 challenges the false presumption that health insurance should be exclusively employment-based, and even more important, highlights the problems of portability and affordability that are inherent consequences of such a restrictive system. Members of Congress should build on the positive features of S. 1028 while making improvements that will give working Americans what they want from health insurance reform:  true portability and individual policies that give them long-term health insurance protection against the financial devastation of catastrophic illness.

<title>PRO-FAMILY TAX RELIEF</title>

<body>

<center>

<img src="/townhall/FRC/fampol/fampolgn.gif">

<h1>Pro-Family Tax Relief</h1>
<h2><i>A Look at Per-Child Credits ... and the Flat Tax</i></h2>

</center>

<p>

<font size=+3>N</font>ine years ago, President Reagan's White House 
Working Group on the Family issued a report entitled, <I>The Family: 
Preserving America's Future</I>, which had as its central recommendation
a dramatic expansion in per-child tax benefits.[1] Five years later,
the bipartisan National Commission on Children (on which then-Governor
Bill Clinton served) issued a report entitled <I>Beyond Rhetoric:
A New American Agenda for Children and Families</I>, which also
had as its central recommendation a dramatic increase in per-child
tax benefits.[2]

<p>

Given that leading officials from both parties have been talking
about pro-family tax relief for nearly a decade, the current debate
over per-child tax benefits should center around this question:
does the House GOP's proposed $500 children's tax credit offer
adequate relief to America's families or should Congress instead
move in the direction of the National Commission on Children's
call for a $1,000 per-child tax credit.

<p>

Sadly, that is not the debate taking place in Washington today.
In recent months, a noisy chorus of critics and naysayers have
been raising all sorts of objections to pro-family tax relief.
Their criticisms - which are at times contradictory - advance
a number of myths.

<p>

<center><h3>The Pander Bear Myth</h3></center>

<p>

Some argue that pro-family tax relief is an extravagant political
giveaway at odds with the larger public interest.  This idea is
advanced frequently by members of the media, who realize just
how popular pro-family tax relief is.  Rather than thoughtfully
considering the merits of various tax-cutting proposals, these
reporters and pundits smugly sneer at public officials, accusing
them of &quot;pandering&quot; to middle Americans.

<p>

One does not often find himself in the position of defending
politicians, but this sort of activity must be recognized for
what it is -- an attempt by members of the liberal media elite
to make Members of Congress feel guilty about doing what the people
elected them to do.  It is the flipside to the liberal media's
reaction to politicians who advance unpopular tax increases, who
are routinely hailed as &quot;profiles in courage.&quot;

<p>

Voters see nothing courageous about broken campaign promises.
Indeed, few things have contributed more to voter cynicism than
President Bush's failure to keep his &quot;no new taxes&quot;
pledge and President Clinton's decision to abandon his promised
&quot;middle-income tax cut&quot; soon after the 1992 election.

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<center>
<font size=+1><b><i>
It is important that policy-makers<br>
view this as a debate over 'pro-family<br>
tax cuts,' not simply 'middle-income<br>
tax relief.'
</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

The American people strongly support pro-family tax relief.
They want to keep more of the money they earn.  They sense that
the well-being of their families -- and the well-being of the nation
-- would improve if they had greater control over their lives.

<p>

On this point, they are right. To acknowledge as much is not
pandering.

<p>

<center><h3>The Bigger Deficit Myth</h3></center>

<p>

Some say pro-family tax relief will increase the deficit and
cause interest rates to rise.  It is quite true that the deficit
would rise if a pro-family tax cut were adopted <I>by itself</I>.
It is also quite true that an increase in government borrowing
would contract the supply of funds available for private lending,
thereby putting upward pressure on interest rates.

<p>

But it is important to point out that no one is talking about
adopting a pro-family tax cut <I>by itself</I>.  All of the sponsors
of major legislation have pledged to offset pro-family tax cuts
with dollar-for-dollar reductions in government spending.

<p>

Pro-family tax cuts &quot;paid for&quot;  by spending cuts cancel
each other out on the balance sheet.  They should have no effect
on the deficit or on interest rates.

<p>

<center><h3>The No-Growth Myth</h3></center>

<p>

Another argument often raised is that pro-family tax relief won't
spur economic growth.  This concern comes from those who believe
that tax policy should serve only economic ends, that it should
steer clear of social considerations and focus exclusively on
promoting economic growth.

<p>

There are two problems with this viewpoint.  First, much of what
is called  &quot;economic growth&quot; isn't growth at all.[3]
It is a movement of economic activity from the non-market home
economy to the quantifiable market economy.  For example, when
a family that once cared for its own child enrolls the child in
a paid day care program, there is no increase in the amount of
economic activity.  There is simply a shift from the non-market
economy to the market economy.  Yet this shift is counted as 
&quot;positive&quot; economic growth even though it often has a 
&quot;negative&quot; effect on the child's well-being.

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<center>
<font size=+1><b><i>
True economic growth involves an<br>
increase in productivity, not simply<br>
in market activity. Until our nation's<br>
economic debate is built around this<br>
fact, much of what is advanced in the<br>
name of 'growth' ought not to be adopted.
</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

True economic growth involves an increase in <I>productivity</I>,
not simply in market activity.  Until our nation's economic debate
is built around this fact, much of what is advanced in the name
of &quot;growth&quot; ought not to be adopted.

<p>

The second problem with the &quot;pro-family tax cuts don't spur
growth&quot; myth is that it pretends that economic policy can
be separated from social policy, that the size of a family's tax
burden simply affects its economic well-being and decision-making.
The truth, of course, is that tax policy not only affects people's
economic decision-making (about working, saving, spending, investing,
etc.) but also their &quot;non-economic&quot; decision-making
(about marrying, childbearing, childrearing, etc.).

<p>

While it is true that economic policy should strive to exert
as little influence as possible over &quot;non-economic&quot;
decisions (so that, for example, people who otherwise would not
marry won't get married just for the tax breaks), it is also true
that our nation's current economic policies exert considerable
influence over &quot;non-economic&quot; decision-making and that
this influence is almost always in an <I>anti-family</I> direction.

<p>

For example, Allan Carlson of the Rockford Institute has shown
that the Social Security system has a pernicious anti-child bias
because it robs parents of the social insurance value of their
children, thereby creating a disincentive for young couples to
invest in childrearing.[4] Indeed, if Congress were to seek to
offset this bias via the tax code (which is the only apparent
option given Social Security's sacrosanct status), it would have
to raise actual per-child savings to roughly $2,100 per child.[5]
When one considers that the net value of the current child tax
exemption is less than $400 per child (for the average family)
and that the high-water mark in the current debate is an additional
$500 per-child tax credit, it is easy to see why many people are
disappointed that the proposals currently being considered aren't
even bolder -- or to use the media's phrase, more courageous.

<p>

Of course, some are reluctant to adopt even a $500 credit because
they are intimidated by the economic &quot;cost&quot; in lost
revenue to the government.  While anti-family policies that took
more than 50 years to develop cannot be wiped out in 50 (or even
100) days, it is important to recognize that there is a social
&quot;cost&quot; to inaction or compromise.  The social &quot;cost&quot;
of weak families is measured in things like divorce rates and
crime statistics.  And these social problems impose enormous economic
costs on our society and our government.  Indeed, the best way
to reduce the demand for government services is to free families
to care for themselves.  Conversely, the best way to hinder the
dismantling of the welfare state is to leave the tax burden on
families with children at or near their current levels so that
families have a difficult time taking back responsibilities from
the state.

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<center><h3>The Middle-Class Only Myth</h3></center>

<p>

Should pro-family tax relief go only to middle-class taxpayers?
Some say so.

<p>

This concern makes the mistake of viewing tax issues through
the prism of class rather than through the prism of family.  It
is true that middle-class Americans often get short shrift in
current tax policy.  (For example, when combined employer-employee
payroll taxes are added to income taxes, some lower-middle-income
couples actually have a marginal tax rate comparable to 
upper-middle-income individuals in the 28 percent bracket.)

<p>

But it is even more true that families with children are shortchanged
in current tax policy.  For example, during the first four decades
after the end of WWII, the income tax burden on singles and childless
couples increased only slightly, while it increased more than
200 percent for families with two children.[6] Reagan-era reforms
helped to reverse this trend moderately, but the dramatic shift
in tax burden from non-parents to parents still dwarfs any shift
in tax burden along income lines.

<p>

Thus, it is important that policymakers view this as a debate
over &quot;pro-family tax cuts,&quot; not simply &quot;middle-income
tax relief.&quot;  This is the way both the 1986 Working Group
and the 1991 National Commission on Children saw the issue.  Indeed,
neither of these reports advocated any type of means-testing on
per-child benefits.  Both recognized that the principle being
advanced was tax relief for families of all incomes to use in
raising children, not tax relief to people who happen to fall
into an income category that everyone considers middle-class (a
category that invariably shrinks as public debate progresses).

<p>

The fact that tax relief should be first and foremost pro-family
does not mean that policymakers should be unconcerned about the
distributional impact of these cuts.  To its credit, the House
GOP plan extends relief in the form of a per-child credit rather
than an increased per-child exemption.  In actual dollar terms,
a credit provides equal relief to all taxpayers; but in 
percentage-of-tax-burden terms, it offers greater relief to working-class 
and middle-income taxpayers than to wealthier taxpayers. (Tax exemptions, 
conversely, skew savings up the income scale, offering greater per-child 
savings to those in higher brackets.)

<p>

This is not to say that tax exemptions are always inferior to
tax credits; for example, one of the virtues of the current exemption
is that its value rises if tax rates rise, thereby guaranteeing
continued horizontal tax equity between parents and non-parents
at any income level.

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<center>
<font size=+1><b><i>
The best way to reduce the demand<br>
for government services is to free<br>
families to care for themselves.
</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

Still, given the tax code's current problems, a non-means-tested
tax credit is the best mechanism for helping families with children.
Indeed, if Congress wanted to maximize its distributional bang
for buck, it might want to consider a non-refundable version of
the 1991 National Commission on Children's $1,000 credit (which
replaced the existing exemption, thereby offering $600+ in net
per-child relief to those in the 15 percent tax bracket, but less
than $300 in net per-child tax relief to those in higher tax brackets).
Moving in this direction would make it easier for Congress to
lift the existing (and newly-proposed) income caps on per-child
benefits -- a problem that definitely needs addressing since income
caps at any level produce marriage penalties.

<p>

Speaking of marriage penalties, the income caps on the Earned
Income Tax Credit have created such a serious anti-marriage effect
that Congress should use all of the monies set aside in the marriage
penalty section of the American Dream Restoration Act to address
the marriage bias facing families earning below the median income.
The Talent-Faircloth welfare reform initiative from 1994 called
for a $1,000 pro-marriage tax credit.  This would be a constructive,
problem-solving first step.  It ought to be adopted.

<p>

<center><h3>The Can't Trust Parents Myth</h3></center>

<p>

Some believe pro-family tax relief should tie benefits to family
expenses (like education) that the government should promote.
This concern springs from the notion that the government knows
more about what families should spend their money for than parents
do.

<p>

Not only is this a false premise, but it leads to all sorts of
unproductive economic distortions.  Indeed, one of the chief reasons
college tuition costs have been rising at a pace exceeding the
general inflation rate is that many students have been given grants
and loans that could be used only for educational purposes.  Knowing
this to be the case, college administrators have raised the cost
of higher education beyond what it would be if students' economic
resources were completely fungible and available for multiple
uses.

<p>

While no one wants to discourage bright young people from pursuing
a higher education, the sad truth is that tax cuts earmarked for
this or any other family expense will have the effect of increasing
the cost of that good or service, thereby exacerbating current
problems and putting a college education out of the reach of some
interested students.  In addition, tax deductions keyed to college
tuition expenses benefit students attending higher-priced schools
more than other students.

<p>

While it would be counter-productive for Congress to provide
tax cuts for specific expenses, it would be helpful for Congress
to modify existing Individual Retirement Account (IRA) rules to
permit taxpayers to enjoy tax-favored savings for a wider variety
of purposes (college tuition, first-time home-buying, etc.). 
In the first case, Congress would be limiting families' economic
freedom, in the second, it would be expanding it.

</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

This is not to say, however, that the Super IRA included in the
House GOP Contract should be adopted in its current form.  The
&quot;back-loaded&quot; nature of its design obligates future
generations to an economic promise made today.  Given the size
of the federal debt, and the pernicious anti-family influence
of intergenerational entitlement programs, Congress should steer
clear of repeating past mistakes.  If tax-favored savings are
to be expanded, they should be expanded within the context of
a &quot;front-loaded&quot; savings mechanism.

<p>

<center><h3>Armey's Flat Tax Appeal</h3></center>

<p>

While the proposed increase in per-child tax benefits is commanding
center stage in the current debate, there is growing interest
in a flat tax proposal sponsored by House GOP Minority Leader
Dick Armey.  The Armey proposal, which some Republicans want to
make a central plank in the 1996 GOP campaign platform, would
reduce the federal income tax form to the size of a post card
by eliminating all existing deductions, exemptions, and credits.
Thus, after claiming &quot;personal allowances&quot; (which allow
taxpayers to adjust their tax liability for family size), all
taxpayers would pay income taxes at a 17 percent marginal rate.

<p>

As such, the Armey plan has a number of appealing features.
These include:

<ul><p>

<li><b><i>Simplicity</i></b>.  Despite periodic attempts to make
tax filing easier, America's tax code is
littered with so many cumbersome rules, regulations, and stipulations
that many ordinary taxpayers feel justifiably overwhelmed.  Eliminating
the tax code's complexity would reduce errors and encourage respect
for and compliance with the code.  It would also free people to
make more productive use of the time they now devote to income
tax compliance.  According to economist Walter Williams of George
Mason University, Americans spend more than six billion hours
each year on record keeping, tax planning, and tax return preparation.
If those same hours were spent producing useful things, Williams
says they would be equal to the combined output of our auto, truck,
and aircraft industries.[7]

<p>

<li><b><i>No Withholding</i></b>.  Rather than continuing the
current system of having employers
withhold income taxes from employees' wages, the Armey plan would
permit taxpayers to take home their entire gross earnings and
then make a monthly tax payment to the government (much as they
currently make a monthly mortgage payment to their lending company).
Eliminating wage withholding would free employers from burdensome
administrative paperwork -- and would help taxpayers see just how
large their tax bite is.  Nothing fosters high taxes more than
the fact that they are currently &quot;hidden&quot; from full
view by wage withholding.  Were all earnings to &quot;pass through&quot;
taxpayers' wallets, Americans would undoubtedly become more aware
of their current tax burden -- and of any changes to it in the
future.

<p>

<li><b><i>Reduced Marriage Penalty</i></b>.  The Armey plan eliminates
most existing marriage penalties in the current income tax code by 
offering marrieds a personal allowance twice that of singles and by 
eliminating all tax rate progressivity. (By retaining the &quot;head of 
household&quot; filing category for single parents, the marriage penalty 
is not eliminated altogether.)  Given the size of the current penalty
(particularly among the working poor) and the larger cultural
need to strengthen the institution of marriage, the Armey plan's
improved treatment of marriage compares well to current law.

<p>

<li><b><i>No Junk</i></b>.  While there is a case to be made for
tax simplification for simplification's
sake, the Armey plan's eradication of existing deductions and
credits has the added virtue of eliminating many ill-conceived
tax write-offs.  For example, the deductibility of state and local
taxes has the effect of redistributing income from people living
in low-tax areas to people living in high-tax states.  Similarly,
the dependant care tax credit has the effect of redistributing
income from families that care for their own children to families
that enroll their children in day care.  Eliminating such write-offs
would eliminate economic distortions and perverse social incentives.

<p>

<li><b><i>Generous Family Benefits</i></b>.  The Armey plan proposes
personal allowances of $13,100
for singles, $26,200 for marrieds, and $5,300 for each dependent
child.  As such, a typical family of four would not begin paying
income taxes until it has earned $36,800 in income.  Although
these family benefits are less generous than those which existed
in the late 1940s and early 1950s, they are considerably higher
than current thresholds (which shield a family of four's first
$16,150 from income taxation).

</ul><p>

<center><h3>Challenges for The Armey Approach</h3></center>

<p>

While the Armey plan has many appealing features, it also faces
a number of challenges -- challenges that will need to be addressed
before the Armey plan (or any variation of it) can be adopted.
These include:

<p><ul>

<li><b><i>Doesn't The Federal Government Already Have An Effective
Flat Tax?</i></b> Most &quot;flat
tax&quot; proponents think only in terms of leveling federal
income taxes.  But America's taxpayers not only pay federal income
taxes but also federal payroll taxes.  The combined employer-employee
share of payroll taxes is just over 15 percent for taxpayers earning
up to $60,600.  This means that most working-class and middle-income
families have a combined marginal tax rate of roughly 30 percent
(divided almost equally between payroll and income taxes).  This
amount is comparable to the marginal tax rate of upper-middle-income
taxpayers in the 28 and 31 percent income tax brackets.

<p>

If Congress were to adopt the Armey plan, and to leave in place
the existing payroll tax, taxpayers in the current 15 percent
income tax bracket would see their combined marginal tax rate
rise to over 32 percent (because Armey replaces the 15 percent
rate with a 17 percent rate).  Meanwhile, upper-middle-income
taxpayers (whose incomes exceed the current cap on payroll taxes)
would experience a dramatic reduction in marginal tax rates from
28 and 31 percent to 17 percent.

</ul>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<center>
<font size=+1><b><i>
Nothing fosters high taxes more<br>
than the fact that they are<br>
currently hidden from full<br>
view by wage witholding.
</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<ul>

Armey proponents choose not to address the payroll tax question,
arguing that social security &quot;contributions&quot; should
be viewed as mandatory payments to a pension plan rather than
taxes to support a cash transfer program.  Given that taxpayers
have no control of these &quot;mandatory payments,&quot; Congress
should alter the construct of the Armey plan so that it takes
payroll taxes into consideration.  This would ensure that taxpayers
earning below $60,600 would not have higher marginal tax rates
than those making above $60,600.

<p>

<li><b><i>Doesn't Rate Progressivity Offset The Anti-Family Aspects
Of The Social Security System?</i></b> Allan Carlson of the Rockford 
Institute argues that &quot;the effect of a flat income tax rate at levels
above 10 percent is to weaken the family as an economic unit.&quot;[8]
Carlson believes a progressive income tax is preferable because
rate progressivity encourages non-market home production over
market production.  Given that the long-term health of our society
(and, for that matter, the long-term health of our economy) would
be threatened by the shift of certain responsibilities from families
and volunteer associations to the market economy, Carlson believes
taxwriters should attempt to make the tax code more progressive
rather than less.  (He would take the revenues generated by greater
progressivity and devote them to a $1,500 per-child credit and
a revival of income-splitting to solve the marriage penalty problem.)

<p>

While Carlson's call for greater progressivity is unlikely to
find an audience with most GOP policymakers, it is important to
point out that the case for a flat tax is seriously weakened by
the social security system's anti-child bias.  If there were no
social security system, parents would have a natural economic
incentive to invest in childrearing because their economic security
in old age would be directly linked to their children's future
productivity.  In other words, in a world without social security,
the workaholic who neglects his childrearing responsibilities
puts himself at risk in old age because his children may turn
out to be dolts or sloths incapable of offering him support if
needed.

</ul>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<ul>

In a world with social security, however, the workaholic who
neglects his childrearing responsibilities puts himself at no
such risk.  If his kids turn out to be unproductive, he does not
suffer -- so long as there are plenty of well-reared children from
other families capable of keeping the system afloat.

<p>

Thankfully, economic incentives are not the only factors -- or
even the primary factors -- influencing parental investments in
children.  Moral imperatives still carry much sway.

<p>

But lest anyone think economic factors are irrelevant, consider
how often one hears talk today from families that say they &quot;can't
afford another child&quot; or &quot;can't afford to have one parent
stay home with young children because they have to have two paychecks.&quot;

<p>

In the abstract, one can easily make a case that an ideal economic
system would have neither a progressive income tax nor an old-age
social insurance scheme.

<p>

Given that no modification in social security is being proposed,
proponents of the Armey flat tax must explain how they would propose
to counteract policy-based incentives for parents to neglect their
non-market childrearing duties.

<p>

<li><b><i>How Does Eliminating Charitable Contributions Square
With A Larger Social Vision That Wants To Replace Government Welfare 
With Private Charity?</i></b> 
To their credit, most proponents of the Armey flat tax are also
advocates of limited government who would like to see the welfare
state dismantled and replaced by private charity.  While this
philosophy does not obligate one to support the continuation
of tax write-offs for charitable contributions, it may be asking
too much to expect the American people simultaneously to support
an elimination of charitable tax deductions and a dismantling
of government welfare programs.  Given the serious social problems
associated with government welfare programs, Congress should do
nothing that might have the effect of undermining public support
for dismantling the welfare state.  Not only does this argue for
the retention of charitable contributions, it actually argues
for an expansion of them.

<p>

Here again, the question is not necessarily one of what is best
in the abstract.  The question, instead, is whether the goal of
a deduction-free tax code should supersede all other goals -- including
the goal of shifting welfare responsibilities from the state to
the charitable sector.

<p>

<li><b><i>How Will Eliminating The Deductibility Of Mortgage Interest
Affect Property Values And The Real Net Worth Of Families?</i></b> Just 
as charitable contributions present a dilemma to Armey flat tax 
proponents, so too do home mortgage interest payments.

<p>

While the intellectual case for mortgage interest deductions
is far weaker than for charitable contributions -- in fact, Carlson
argues that mortgage interest deductions have had an anti-family
effect by encouraging smaller households and spurring artificial
growth in housing prices[9] -- the problem is that eliminating the
mortgage interest deduction that is now in place could have an
even more serious anti-family effect.  Many families have a considerable
share of their entire net worth tied up in their homes.  If a
proposal eliminating the mortgage interest deduction were to pass,
and thereby to pull the rug out from under property owners, the
social and economic effects could be quite serious.  Indeed, the
recession that occurred during the Bush Administration was caused
in part by a decline in home values.  As families saw their net
worth falling, they understandably felt less freedom to make new
purchases.

<p>

It is possible, as Armey proponents maintain, that the negative
effect on property values of eliminating home mortgage deductibility
will be offset by the positive effect of greater economic growth
in other parts of the economy.  But it is also quite possible
that consumers will respond to the elimination of home mortgage
deductibility in the same manner they responded to the housing
recession of the late 1980s.

<p>

Given that those who have the most to lose from instability in
the housing market are young families who have recently purchased
first homes, Congress must proceed very cautiously in this area.

<p>

<li><b><i>Won't The Value Of Pro-Family Benefits Decline As The
Legislative Process Unfolds?</i></b> As noted earlier, the Armey tax 
plan includes
adjustments for family size that exceed current law.  While this
is one of the plan's most laudable features, there is reason to
believe that the benefit levels leaving the starting gate of the
legislative process would never survive the marathon to the finish
line.  The reason is simple:  if any change is made in the Armey
plan that would have the effect of reducing revenues (such as
reinserting certain tax write-offs) the only options Armey would
have would be:

<p><ul>

(1)  to increase the deficit;<br>
(2)  to raise the tax rate above 17 percent; or<br>
(3)  to reduce family benefits.

</ul><p>

The first option would be unlikely in any scenario, but is especially
so given that Armey's proposal, by his own estimates, would raise
$40 billion less than current law (and some claim the shortfall
would be as much as four times this amount).  Indeed, given the
level of concern that has already arisen about revenue shortfalls,
it is quite possible that family tax benefits could be raided
even if no other changes were made to the Armey plan.

<p>

The second option -- raising the tax rate above 17 percent -- is
also unlikely because the political support for the flat tax largely
hangs or falls on the size of this number.  Tax policy is mysterious
to most Americans.  Average citizens are far more likely to follow
fluctuations in the flat rate structure than fluctuations in the
family benefits -- especially since the premise of the debate is
that we need a flat <I>rate</I>.

</ul>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<font size=+1><b><i>
Those who believe the most serious<br>

</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<ul>

Thus, those who believe the most serious problem in the current
tax code is the absence of significant pro-family benefits are
poorly served by a debate that emphasizes rates rather than the
size of pro-family benefits.

<p>

Indeed, one of the virtues of the existing debate surrounding
the House GOP's Contract proposal is that it has centered around
the $500 per-child figure.  While this amount should be higher,
it will be difficult for Members of Congress to pass something
less than this amount without having to do an awful lot of explaining
to their constituents. Hopefully, Armey proponents can find
a way to offer this level of protection to pro-family benefits
during the legislative process.

</ul><p>

<center><h3>Family First</h3></center>

<p>

After years of talk but no action on the pro-family tax front,
Congress appears poised to finally adopt some significant per-child
relief.  This is long overdue.  In 1948, a median income family
of four sent two percent of its annual income to the federal government
in federal income and payroll taxes.  Today, that same family
sends 24.5 percent of its income to the Federal Treasury.[10] The
erosion in the value of per-child benefits is the primary reason
for this dramatic increase in the income tax burden of America's
families.  According to Eugene Steuerle of the Urban Institute,
the current child exemption would need to be quadrupled in size
in order to offset the same percentage of income that the exemption
shielded from taxation in 1948.[11]

<p>

Given the magnitude of this historic shift, nothing -- including
the possibility of making even more dramatic tax changes in the
near future -- should deter Congress from adopting at least $500
in per-child tax savings.

<h2>A CLOSER LOOK</h2>

<p><hr width=60% noshade><p>

<h2>The Limits of Tax Relief</h2>

</center>

<p>

<font size=+3>W</font>hile it is important for Members of Congress to 
recognize the virtues of pro-family tax relief, it is also important 
for them to recognize the limitations of pro-family relief.

<p>

Pro-family tax relief will not make husbands love their wives
or children respect their parents.  It will not clear up filthy
TV or remove child predators from our streets.  In short, pro-family
tax relief, by itself, will not magically solve the myriad social
problems facing America's families, neighborhoods, and communities.

<p>

But pro-family tax relief will make it easier for families to
thrive by reducing economic stress.  It will make it easier for
parent
them from other harms by freeing them to spend more of their time
with their children and less of their time frantically chasing
the almighty, overtaxed dollar.

<p>

In short, pro-family tax relief will empower parents to address
many family needs that only they can meet.

<p>

America needs parents who want to raise their children well.
But we also need policies that empower them to act upon these
sentiments.

<p>

The 104th Congress should adopt nothing less than $500 in per-child
tax relief for all taxpaying families.

<title>FREEING AMERICA'S SCHOOLS</title>

<body>

<center>

<img src="/townhall/FRC/fampol/fampolbl.gif">

<h1>Freeing America's Schools</h1>
<h2><i>The Case Against the U.S. Education Department</i></h2>

</center>

<p>

<font size=+3>A</font> century and a half ago, Alexis de 
Tocqueville recognized that increased centralization and 
bureaucratization saps civic and individual responsibility. 
"[A] centralized administration is fit only to enervate the 
nations in which it exists, by incessantly diminishing their 
local spirit",[1] wrote Tocqueville.

<p>

Cathy Duffy, in a new book titled <i>Government Nannies</i>, 
echoes Tocqueville's observation: "History and common sense 
tell us that people are more likely to assume responsibility 
when they know that no one else will.  If I knew that no one 
else was going to watch my car's gas gauge and remind me to 
fill the tank before it hits empty, I would do it myself.  
But my husband watches it closely and puts gas in the car for 
me.  As a result of his kindness, I rarely look at the gas gauge."[2]

<p>

Unfortunately, many Americans seem to have forgotten this principle 
and have yielded responsibility for certain domestic functions to 
central planners working in the federal government.  Nowhere is 
this more apparent than in the area of education, where increased 
bureaucratic control has bred local apathy which, in turn, has bred 
greater bureaucratic control.  Indeed, many contemporary Americans 
resemble the 19th century European described by Tocqueville:

<p>

<blockquote><i>

The condition of his village, the police of his street, the 
repairs of the church or the parsonage, do not concern him; 
for he looks upon all these things as unconnected with himself 
and as the property of a powerful stranger whom he calls the 
government....  This want of interest in his own affairs goes 
so far that if his own safety or that of his children is at last 
endangered, instead of trying to avert the peril, he will fold 
his arms and wait till the whole nation comes to his aid....</i>[3]

</blockquote>

</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

Tocqueville warns that, when a nation reaches this point, 
"it must either change its customs and its laws, or perish; 
for the source of public virtues is dried up; and though it 
may contain subjects, it has no citizens."[4]

<p>

<center><h3>Ending the Federal Role in Education</h3></center>

<p>

The United States Constitution is a document of enumerated powers. 
That is, the Federal government is permitted to do only what the 
Constitution specifically lists.  This is expressed clearly and 
succinctly in the 10th amendment:   "The powers not delegated to 
the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved 
to the States respectively, or to the people."

<p>

Since education is not listed as a Federal responsibility, it was 
exclusively under the jurisdiction of states and localities through 
most of our history.  Things began to change in the 1930s when the 
New Deal brought increasing Federal involvement.  Later, under 
Eisenhower, a cabinet-level department was created:  Health, 
Education and Welfare.  And under the Johnson Administration, 
passage of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act expanded 
federal involvement further.

<p>

Then, in 1976, Democratic presidential nominee Jimmy Carter 
promised the creation of a separate education department if 
elected and received the backing of the National Education 
Association (NEA) as a result.  In 1979, President Carter set 
about to make good on his promise.  But there was strong opposition 
from the American Federation of Teachers (the second-largest teacher 
union), from much of higher education, and from the general public. 
The AFL-CIO attacked the idea[5] and even the liberal <i>Washington 
Post</i> argued that "shifting federal education programs to a 
separate department increases bureaucratic costs."[6]

Many Americans feared that a cabinet-level department would 
lead to an expanded federal role in education.  Marvin Stone, 
in an editorial in <i>U.S. News & World Report</i>, put it 
this way:   Would the Education Department have the power to 
tamper with America's traditional local control of education? 
Of course it would.  Where there is money to be given, there 
is the implicit responsibility to make sure that it is spent 
according to the purposes of the donors  -- or else.[7]

<p>

While the bill establishing the department stated emphatically 
that the Department would not undermine state and local control, 
Stone noted:

<p>

<blockquote><i>

...a subtle schizophrenia, meandering through the legislation and 
the committee appraisal, suggests that the authors' inward dream 
for the department runs at odds with the stated restrictions. One 
keeps encountering such phrases as  "implement...at the local level" 
...  "assesses the achievement of federal objectives" ... and 
"monitoring parental and public participation."</i>[8]

</blockquote>

<p>

Today, Stone's essay seems prophetic.  The <i>Guide to U.S. 
Department of Education Programs</i> lists 241 separate programs, 
many of which have usurped the prerogatives of the states.  For 
example, the index identifies six programs exclusively for Native 
Hawaiians.  It is instructive to imagine tax monies garnered in 
Oahu, transferred to a federal bureaucracy 6,000 miles away, 
filtered expensively through Washington's education blob, and the 
remainder returned to the island state for Native Hawaiian 
education.  It is not difficult to believe that Hawaiians could 
manage these programs more efficiently and less expensively than 
the federal government.  And if Hawaiians, then why not Carolinians, 
Vermonters, and Texans as well?

<p>

The U.S. Education Department, then, is an entity with a dubious 
past.  Its conception was of doubtful legitimacy, given the 
strictures of Constitution and tradition.  The circumstances 
of its birth were suspect -- more or less a political payoff 
to the NEA.  Furthermore, the U.S. Education Department has 
not improved American education.

<p>

Before its creation, President Carter could point to  "[o]ur 
Nation's pluralistic education system" as "the most competent 
and open in the world...."[9] No longer so.  According to 
former Secretary of Education William Bennett, more than 90 
percent of the students entering U.S. colleges would not be 
admitted to post-secondary education anywhere else in the world.[10] 
The 1990 National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) declared 
that as many as half of elementary and secondary students do not 
demonstrate  "competency in challenging subject matter in English, 
mathematics, science, history, and geography.  Further, even fewer 
are able to use their minds well."[11]

Meanwhile, the U.S. Education Department has grown into a huge 
bureaucratic blob.  It has elbowed its way into places it does 
not belong, not the least of which are local schools and family 
life.

<p>

<center><h3>Goals 2000</h3></center>

<p>

On March 31, 1994, federal intrusiveness reached a new height with 
passage of Goals 2000.  Groundwork for the program was being laid 
as early as 1987 when Richard Riley and Hillary Rodham Clinton 
served on the Southern Regional Education Board's (SREB) Commission 
on Educational Quality.  Bill Clinton also participated in SREB 
meetings.  The commission developed a set of goals and published 
<i>Goals for Education:  Challenge 2000</i> in 1988.[12] In 1989, 
President Bush summoned the nation's governors to an educational 
summit meeting in Charlottesville, Virginia.  At this gathering, 
then-Governor Clinton played a major role in leading the governors 
to adopt six ambitious national goals for education.  These goals 
formed the basis of America 2000, President Bush's plan for 
education reform.

<p>

The America 2000 plan represented a dramatic departure from 
the American political tradition in education, as explained 
by John F. Jennings, director of the Center on National 
Education Policy:

<p>

<blockquote><i>

Democratic Presidents Kennedy and Johnson had proposed a major 
expansion of federal aid to education in the 1960s and had 
achieved the enactment of historic legislation that created 
the current array of federal programs.  But they were dogged 
along the way by criticism from conservatives who asserted that 
the liberals were really trying to nationalize education.  Now, 
25 years later, it was a self-proclaimed conservative Republican, 
not a liberal Democrat, who was advocating <b>a monumental 
movement away from local control of education</b>.</i>[13] 
<i>(emphasis added)

</i></blockquote>

<p>

While Bush failed to get both Houses of Congress to adopt his 
plan, President Clinton was quick to seize the initiative on 
this issue soon after his election in 1992.  Clinton expanded 
Bush's plan, renamed it Goals 2000, and made it the cornerstone 
of his Education Department's agenda.

<p>

The reach of Goals 2000 as educational innovation can hardly be 
overstated.  Albert Shanker of the American Federation of 
Teachers called it  "the most important piece of education 
legislation we've ever had."[14] And Secretary of Education 
Richard Riley wrote,  "For the first time in the nation's 
history, a statutory framework defining an appropriate role 
for the federal government has been enacted."[15]

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<center>
<font size=+1><b><i>
Goals 2000 includes national<br>
education goals and standards<br>
that override local priorities<br>
and ignore the fact that many<br>

standards for student learning.
</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

Goals 2000 provides a framework for restructuring the American 
system of education, creating tighter and more definite links 
between the federal, state and local levels.  This makes it 
even easier for the Education Department to tamper with local 
schools than Marvin Stone once envisioned.

<p>

Indeed, Goals 2000 includes national education goals and standards 
that override local priorities and ignore the fact that many 
private entities have developed standards for student learning. 
E.D. Hirsch, for example, has written a series of books on cultural 
literacy, describing fundamentals of education at each grade level. 
The Family Research Council has published an outline of U.S. history 
entitled <i>Let Freedom Ring</i>. William Bennett's best-selling 
<i>Book of Virtues</i> is a wonderful source of America's literary 
heritage.  All of these examples meet the need for high academic 
standards.

<p>

What is revolutionary about Goals 2000 is the idea that the federal 
government should be involved in creating and certifying standards 
for education and in determining  "official knowledge."

<p>

The goals, themselves, are highly problematic.  First, they smack 
of Utopianism.  They illustrate the 
"with-a-stroke-of-this-pen-I-change-the-world" kind of thought that 
sometimes afflicts high-level bureaucrats and politicians. For 
example,[16] Goal Six says that every adult American will be 
literate.  Since some estimates put the number of adult illiterates 
at nearly four million and the number of functional illiterates at 
30 million, their re-education would require a national mobilization 
akin to fighting World War I.  And these are <b>adults</b> -- 
outside the scope of compulsory education.  Goals like this with 
a timetable like this (all problems solved in six years!) are so 
unrealistic as to undermine public confidence in the politicians 
and the educational establishment.

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<center>
<font size=+1><b><i>
'National standards' could<br>
actually work to 'dumb down'<br>
educational expectations<br>
rather than to raise them.
</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

The goals also have coercive implications.  Goal One says "all 
children in America will start school ready to learn."  Assuming 
the statement is not mere rhetoric, how will the government meet 
this goal?  Or consider Goal Eight:   "Every school will promote 
partnerships that will increase parental involvement and 
participation in promoting the social, emotional, and academic 
growth of children."  Note the peremptory  "will": these 
"partnerships" are not optional.  They instruct school officials 
to direct parents rather than stating that parents are to be 
primarily responsible for their children's education. Moreover, 
Goals 2000 defines parental involvement in mostly peripheral 
terms: parent-teacher conferences, PTA meetings, etc.

<p>

Goal Three says that "American students will leave grade four, 
eight, and twelve having demonstrated competency in challenging 
subject matter...."  Who decides what  "challenging subject matter" 
is, and what is  "demonstrated competency" over it?  The Goals 2000 
law created a new federal agency, the National Educational Standards 
and Improvement Council (NESIC).  Under the law, states may draw up 
state educational standards or use the national standards that will 
also be made available.  All of this was declared, in the Goals 2000 
law itself, to be entirely voluntary.  Indeed, among its supporters, 
Goals 2000 is hardly mentioned without the assuring  "voluntary" 
prefix.  Calling it  "voluntary" is actually highly misleading, 
especially in light of other legislation.  As Secretary of Education 
Richard Riley said of the Goals 2000 law,  "We were determined that 
Goals 2000 become the prism through which amendments to every other 
program in elementary and secondary education would be considered."[17]

<p>

One such program is the Elementary and Secondary Education Act 
(ESEA), under which 90 percent of the schools in the nation 
receive funding.  Under <i>this</i> law states cannot receive federal 
funding for elementary and secondary education unless they follow 
an application process nearly identical to that contained in Goals 
2000.  In fact the ESEA declares that  "[i]f a State has State 
content standards or State student performance standards developed 
under title III of the Goals 2000:  Educate America Act and an 
aligned set of assessments...the State shall use such standards 
and assessments"[18] as its plan to be submitted for application 
purposes.

<p>

Some argue that Goals 2000 is voluntary because states are free to 
write standards of their own.  The catch is that even these state 
standards must be approved by the U.S. Department of Education in 
order for the state to receive Goals 2000 funds.  What kind of 
standards are the feds likely to approve?  Since there will be 
federal standards and curriculum for each discipline, no state 
will be left guessing.  And no one who understands human nature 
will be left guessing about what all the states' materials will 
tend to look like. "National standards" sounds challenging: 
they aren't. The U.S. Education Department, for example, recently 
sued Ohio for imposing an eighth grade reading requirement as a 
condition of high school graduation. The standard was too 
restrictive, too discriminatory. Thus, "national standards" 
could actually work to  "dumb down" educational expectations, 
rather than to raise them.

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<center><h3>Faulty Standards</h3></center>

<p>

Consider the U.S. history standards, written by the Center for 
History in the Schools at UCLA under a $2 million grant from the 
U.S. Education Department and the National Endowment for the 
Humanities.  They contain many historical facts and interesting 
teaching strategies.  But nothing could better demonstrate the 
dangers of a national curriculum.  The standards are replete 
with political correctness.  Paul Revere, Thomas Edison, J.P. 
Morgan, the Wright Brothers, Alexander Graham Bell, Robert E. 
Lee, and Albert Einstein are all omitted; yet, Madonna, Speckled 
Snake and The Simpsons are included.

<p>

The standards not only trivialize American history, but also 
present an exceedingly gloomy view of America.  Nobody wants 
a history written through rose-colored glasses --  but the 
standards go beyond an honest appraisal of national failures, 
replacing  "America: land of opportunity," with  "America: land 
of oppression."  As Albert Shanker pointed out, no other 
government has tried to teach its children to have negative 
feelings about their own country.[19]

<p>

Political correctness also colors many of the questions and 
assignments in the history standards.  For example, students 
are asked to  "explain how feminism was compelling in its 
analysis of women's problems and solutions offered."  To the 
ideologically charged individuals who wrote the standards, 
feminist ideology could only be  "compelling."  But for many 
Americans, this premise is highly debatable.  That there is 
such a disagreement should not be a problem.  Histories should 
acknowledge diversity of opinion, instead of pretending that all 
people hold the same views.  It is highly ironic that those whose 
very creed is  "diversity" should seek to ignore and marginalize 
opinion when it differs from their own.

<p>

Another weakness of the standards has been little noted in the 
national discussion:  they contain virtually no explanation of 
what communism is and what it did.  It is difficult to see how 
any student could make sense of the 20th century without 
understanding what Marx and Lenin taught and how Stalin acted 
on those teachings.  The Cold War for example -- nearly half a 
century of American history -- becomes inexplicable.  During this 
century, Soviet Communism was responsible for at least 60 million 
deaths.  Adding Communist China brings the toll to many millions 
more.  Without an understanding of this, the student could only 
consider the collision of democracy and Communism to be like some 
pointless dynastic or boundary-marker squabble of the distant past.

<p>

Indeed, the history standards implicitly subscribe to the doctrine 
of moral equivalence, describing the Cold War merely as "swordplay 
of the Soviet Union and the United States," and making no mention of 
Soviet invasions of Hungary, Czechoslovakia and Afghanistan.  They 
describe  "Soviet advances in space" and the <i>Challenger</i> 
disaster, while omitting any reference to John Glenn or the successful 
U.S. moon landing.  Columnist George Will says they show a "cranky 
anti-Americanism."[20]

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

How is it possible that a program like Goals 2000 -- quite inimical 
to American tradition -- has become the manual for running local 
schools?  Partly, as we have seen, through subterfuge: the 
insistent repetition that it is entirely voluntary.  Partly because 
the profound crisis of American education has convinced many that 
only an enormous federal initiative can cope with it.  But this 
conviction is based on the fallacy that the federal government has 
money of its own.  In reality, the only money the U.S. Education 
Department has is money that citizens once earned.  Think back to 
the example of the federal programs for Native Hawaiians.  They 
typify every federal education program:  the money localities give 
up to Washington is returned to them -- much diminished.  The 
total U.S. Education Department budget has reached a level of $30 
billion dollars.  What if this money were simply routed to the local 
schools instead of being routed through the federal bureaucracy? It 
tickles the imagination to think of the textbooks and desks and 
computers and art classes and chemistry labs and gymnasiums and 
field trips and new teachers that could be financed with the savings.

<p>

There would be another great advantage for localities if the 
federal government got out of the education business.  There 
is a misperception that Washington provides the lion's share 
of education funding in this nation.  In reality, federal 
spending accounts for only about 6.5 percent[21] of the funding 
that goes into local education. Yet, "Uncle Sam's leverage 
over U.S. education is greater than his six or seven percent of 
the school budget would indicate," notes Chester Finn, former 
assistant secretary of education under President Reagan.[22] 
Overbearing federal regulations hinder local school freedom. 
Getting the federal education bureaucracy out of our pockets 
and off our backs should liberate local leaders and infuse 
communities with a new sense of local spirit.

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

President Carter, arguing in 1979 for the establishment of a U.S. 
Education Department, boasted: "Under the proposal I am submitting 
today, the Department of Education will include more than 150 programs 
and 16,200 employees.  With a budget of more than $13 billion, this 
Department will be larger than five other Departments including Energy, 
Commerce, Justice, Interior and State."[23] Such was the sentiment with 
which the U.S. Education Department was formed.  Few politicians would 
dare to highlight these facts today.  In its 15 years of existence the 
U.S. Education Department has added 100 programs, more than doubled its 
annual expenditures, and doubled its outlays as a percentage of total 
federal spending, from one percent to two percent.[24] In hindsight, 
it is clear that enlarging the federal role in education was a mistake. 
As early as 1981, policy analysts recognized that "the creation of this 
Department was a mistake, that its enactment is analogous to an inversion 
of the proverbial miller's tale, spinning something fine back into 
something coarse."[25] The federal government should no longer have a 
role in American education.

<p>

<center><h3>Common Objections</h3></center>

<p>

Some argue that the U.S. Education Department must be preserved 
because of four seemingly critical functions of the federal department: 
helping the disabled, protecting civil rights, providing college loans, 
and conducting national educational research.  But there is reason to 
believe that these functions can be handled by state and local 
governments and by private entities.  Indeed, one-size-fits-all 
administrative policies handed down by the federal government have 
often proved counter-productive.  Consider, for example, special 
education.

<p>

The federal government's spending on special education accounts for 
a very small percentage of the cost of educating each student with 
disabilities -- only eight percent.  Yet, its regulations define the 
special education policies which local schools must follow.

<p>

The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) began two 
decades ago with the purpose of providing all children with handicaps 
a "free and appropriate public education."  After many reauthorizations 
and amendments, the federal special education requirements are now 
numerous, detailed and cumbersome.  Schools are instructed to place 
students in the  "least restrictive environment."  Today this policy 
is defined as full inclusion.  That means that the regular classroom 
must be the first option for all children with handicaps, and many in 
the education establishment, ignoring the fact that diverse needs require 
diverse solutions, are determined to make the regular classroom the "best 
option" by bringing in aides, special materials, equipment, etc.[26] As 
Albert Shanker has said,  "The argument on the part of inclusionists 
rests on the social benefits of education.  Some have even stated that 
they don't care if other children don't learn to read and write, if 
they have learned to 'get along.'"[27]

<p>

The federally mandated policy of inclusion presents an excellent 
example of why a federal Education Department is ineffective and 
inappropriate.  A single national policy cannot meet the needs of 
all students.  Nowhere is this more true than in special education, 
where a student's learning depends largely on how closely teaching 
methods meet his or her needs.  Those closest to the student with 
special needs -- parents and teachers -- should have authority to 
shape policy so it will be appropriate for that student.

<p>

Just as the U.S. Department of Education is poorly suited to the 
task of setting special education policies, it is poorly suited 
to the task of protecting the civil rights of students.

<p>

Civil rights issues in schools today are not significantly different 
from those in any other arena of American life.  To guarantee 
students equal protection under the law, the function of preserving 
civil rights in schools should be moved to the U.S. Justice Department. 
Schools have broken the chains of discrimination, and minority students 
have made considerable progress as a result.  Indeed, one of the few 
success stories in American education in the last three decades is the 
reduced disparity in the relative achievement and graduation rates of 
white and minority students.[28]

<p>

In dealing with schools, the Justice Department must heed the advice 
given in 1981 to the Office of Civil Rights (OCR) in the Education 
Department:

<p>

<blockquote><i>

The civil rights of individuals are fundamental, and should not be 
abridged.  But the role of the OCR...needs to be narrowed so as to 
allow state and local education officials to develop programs which 
will take into consideration the unique situations of particular 
schools and school districts.  Guidance and assistance, not broad, 
heavy-handed mandates and regulations, should be the role of this 
division.</i>[29]

</blockquote>

<p>

<center><h3>Private Solutions</h3></center>

<p>

The federal lending program for post-secondary education should be 
privatized.  Government should concentrate its limited funds on 
"inherently governmental functions," insists Robert Poole, president 
of the Reason Foundation.   "It should separate policymaking and 
regulation from actual service delivery."[30]

<p>

The federal government entered the educational lending business in 
1972 when it chartered the Student Loan Marketing Association (Sallie 
Mae) to ensure access to student loans for post-secondary education. 
Many argue that Sallie Mae has accomplished that mission and should 
now be privatized.[31] The Clinton Administration appears eager to 
let the quasi-private Sallie Mae do just that so that it may conduct 
a lending program with the exact opposite character: direct lending 
by the federal government.

<p>

Instituted in 1993, the Federal Direct Student Loan Program "has done 
nothing to 'reduce the complexity of administering student loans, 
eliminate unnecessary costs, and provide better service to students 
and schools'" as it claimed it would, according to Allyson Tucker of 
the Heritage Foundation.[32]

<p>

Robert Poole calls privatization "a major worldwide trend,"[33] yet our 
government has chosen to espouse the failed economic philosophy that 
government industries are preferable to private ones.  Bankers are 
doubtful that direct lending will succeed.[34] With the Education 
Department's history of students defaulting on loans, their pessimism 
is not unfounded.  The federal government should get out of the lending 
business; it should also get out of the educational research business.[35]

<p>

The federal government need not be involved for national educational 
research to take place.  Indeed, the most commonly cited measurement 
of student performance -- the Standard Achievement Test (SAT) -- comes 
not from the federal government but from the Educational Testing Service 
(ETS) in Princeton, NJ.

<p>

<center><h3>Conclusion</h3></center>

<p>

Bureaucracies are what bureaucracies do. Goals 2000 and the Elementary 
and Secondary Education Act clearly show the intent of the federal 
Education Department to intrude further into local schools and usurp 
community responsibility. The history standards that the Department 
financed are so biased that the United States Senate renounced them 
in a 99 to 1 vote.

If there is one lesson of our times it is that centralization and huge 
bureaucracies don't work very well.  That truth swept away the 
governments of the Soviet Union and half a dozen other countries. 
People in all corners of the globe are moving to take control of their 
own lives back from distant bureaucracies.  Our own nation needs a 
renewal of the local spirit that Alexis de Tocqueville praised so 
highly in 1835:

<p>

<blockquote><i>

I know of no people who have established schools so numerous and 
efficacious, places of public worship better suited to the wants 
of the inhabitants, or roads kept in better repair.  Uniformity 
or permanence of design, the minute arrangement of details, and 
the perfection of administrative system must not be sought for in 
the United States; what we find there is the presence of a power 
which, if it is somewhat wild, is at least robust, and an existence 
checkered with accidents, indeed, but full of animation and effort.</i>[36]

</blockquote>

<p>

It's time to disestablish the U.S. Education Department and end 
the federal intrusion into America's schools.

<title>ON DRUGS: THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION'S CURIOUS SURRENDER</title>

<h1>On Drugs</h1>
<h2><i>The Clinton Administration's Curious Surrender</i></h2>

</center>

<p>

<font size=+3>D</font>rug abuse among teenagers has risen significantly 
in recent years.  A nationwide survey by the National Institute on Drug 
Abuse (NIDA) found that between 1991 and 1994 annual marijuana use rose
from 6.2 percent to 13.0 percent among 8th graders, from 16.5 percent to 
30.4 percent among 10th	graders, and from 36.7 percent to 38.2 percent 
among 12th graders. Moreover, cocaine, crack, heroin, and LSD use among 
teenagers is also rising and may soon rival the high rates of the 1970s.[1]

<p>

Despite these trends, the Clinton Administration is leading an all-out 
retreat in the drug war. During the past two years, President Clinton 
has overseen the wholesale dismantling of government agencies that are at 
least partly responsible for the successes of the 1980s. The Clinton 
Administration has:

<p><ul>

<li>Dropped the drug war as one of the National Security Council's top 
priorities. It is now number 29 of 29.[2]

<p>

<li>Cut the drug czar's office by 80 percent from 146 to 25 personnel. 
It was partially restored by Congressional mandate.[3]

<p>

<li>Folded the State Department's Office of International Narcotics 
Matters into a potpourri organization that handles issues like labor, 
environment and population concerns.[4]

</ul>

</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<ul>

<li>Left two key anti-drug positions vacant for at least six months: the 
drug czar and the position of Assistant Secretary of Defense for Drug 
Enforcement Policy and Support.[5]

<p>

<li>Cut military anti-drug efforts by signing an executive order 
drastically reducing the Pentagon's interdiction efforts. These cuts 
included 1,000 military positions devoted to anti-drug activities,[6] a 
move Rep. Charles Schumer (D-NY) called "a terrible mistake."[7]

<p>
	
<li>Cut drug interdiction funds for the Customs Service and the DEA. 
Today,	even though 70 percent of all cocaine comes to the U.S. via Mexico, 
the Customs Service does not routinely search for drugs inside semi-trailers 
crossing the border.[8]

<p>

<li>Reduced mandatory minimum sentences for drug traffickers.[9]

<p>

<li>Recommended, during his first-year budget, cuts in drug education 
(26 percent) and enforcement (15 percent).[10] Drug Czar Lee Brown learned 
of the proposed	cuts from an article in a newspaper.[11]

<p>

<li>Recommended merging the DEA with the FBI as part of the National 
Performance Review.[12]

<p>

<li>Cut 355 DEA agents and 102 personnel from the Justice Department's 
organized crime drug enforcement task force.[13]

<p>

<li>Cut the Coast Guard's drug interdiction budget by $14.6 million.[14]

<p>

<li>Terminated the DEA's drug kingpin program, which tracks international 
drug lords with the intent of bringing them to justice.

<p>

<li>Published a	report endorsing needle exchange programs intended to 
reduce the spread of AIDS and encouraged local governments to begin needle 
exchange programs.

not abated.[15]

<p>

<li>Cut drug treatment and prevention budgets by $100 and $130 million 
respectively.[16]

<p>

<li>Disbanded Operation Snow-Cap, which assigned DEA agents to assist 
anti-drug police in cocaine-producing nations.

</ul><p>

<center><h3>Bearing Responsibility</h3></center>

<p>

While it is certainly appropriate for policymakers to make changes that 
will improve the effectiveness of legitimate government programs (and these 
changes	will sometimes take the form of budget cuts, departmental 
consolidation and new priorities) a growing number of experts believe the 
Clinton Administration's drug policy changes are at least partly responsible 
for the recent increase in youth drug use and addiction.  For example, former 
First Lady Nancy Reagan told a Congressional committee in March 1995, "Why is 
it we no longer hear the drumbeat of condemnation against drugs coming from 
our leaders and our culture?  Is it any	wonder drug use has started climbing 
and dramatically so?"[17]

<p>

Former drug czar William Bennett stated, there is "no viable effort by the 
Clinton Administration to prevent the complete disintegration of foreign 
supply control.  This is an unconscionable abdication.  We face the real 
prospect of foreign nations permitting the unchallenged production and 
shipment of illegal drugs to the U.S."[18]

<p>

Former Drug Enforcement Administration director Robert Bonner stated, "I 
believe	that there has been a near total absence of presidential leadership 
by President Clinton in the fight to turn back illegal drug use in this 
country...It [the Administration] clearly fails to promote an increased 
awareness of the dangers of drug abuse, arguably encourages it...The 
Clinton	Administration's national drug strategy has failed miserably, and 
indeed it is a tragedy. The President must reverse this trend and start 
leading our nation's anti-drug efforts."[19]

<p>

Rep. Charles Rangel (D-NY) said, "I've been in Congress for over two 
decades, and I have never, never, never seen a president who cares 
less about this issue."[20]

<p>

Rep. John Conyers (D-MI) told Lee Brown during the drug czar's 
confirmation hearings, "Either the president is with you, or he has just 
given you a chair at the cabinet level...If it is the latter, you are 
getting ready to be the biggest fall guy in the Clinton Administration...We 
might as well close [the drug office] down and stop the pretense."[21]

<p>

Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) spokesman Wayne Roques, a 25-year 
veteran of the drug war, states: "The drug culture, sensing a weakening 
in our national resolve, has reared its ugly head and embarked on a 
well-financed, unconscionable campaign to legalize drugs."[22]

<p>

Attorney General Janet Reno has heard enough of the criticism of the 
Clinton anti-drug efforts.  She stated, "I would just suggest that it 
has come time to stop the political labeling of this fight and all of us 
join together in one common-sense, concentrated	effort that goes after 
the traffickers, that goes after the violence spawned by the drugs but 
provides education, prevention and treatment in a way that can truly make 
a difference."[23]

<p>

The nation's chief law enforcement officer makes a good point, but the 
Clinton Administration's actions send a very different message.  They 
represent a major philosophical shift from the Reagan/Bush years.

<p>

Presidential candidate Bill Clinton told the Democratic National 
Convention in July 1992, "[President Bush] hasn't fought a real war on 
crime and drugs, I will."[24] He promised to combine tough law 
enforcement with expanded treatment and prevention programs.  He also 
pledged to appoint a strong drug czar.[25]

<p>

Clinton's longstanding commitment to drug treatment is evidenced in his 
1995 National Drug Strategy.  He states: "The National Drug Control 
Strategy...confirms...my priorities for addressing this nation's 
continuing drug problem...This strategy gives those who	have fallen 
prey to drugs the opportunity to change their behavior."  His strategy 
focuses on treatment.[26]

<p>
	
The President told <I>Rolling Stone</I> reporters that drug treatment 
is "a big issue."[27] He explained his intent to "change the focus of 
interdiction to work on the roots of the exports to the United States" 
and "we decided to go ahead and put drug treatment into the 
health-care bill."[28]

<p>

Former drug czar Bennett points out that a successful war on drugs must	
balance treatment with prevention and interdiction.  The Clinton strategy 
is unbalanced.

<p>

<center><h3>Some Curious Appointees</h3></center>

<p>

Clinton appointees have orchestrated a campaign to liberalize the 
government's war on drugs.

<p>

For example, Clinton's first Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders created a 
firestorm when she responded to a question at a National Press Club 
luncheon by stating, "I do feel	that we would markedly reduce our crime 
rate if drugs were legalized."[29]

<p>

Her comments evoked reactions from many sectors. Senator Bob Dole 
(R-KS) said, "Americans must be wondering if the Surgeon General 
is hazardous to our health."[30] But Baltimore Mayor Kurt Schmoke 
applauded Elders: "I think what the Surgeon General said was 
absolutely courageous and correct; there should be a study."[31]

<p>

While President Clinton sought to distance himself from Elders' 
comments, the Clinton Justice Department issued a study recommending 
reduction in mandatory minimum drug sentences.[32]

<p>

The DOJ's report, "An Analysis of Non-Violent Drug Offenders with 
Minimal	Criminal Histories,"[33] found that low-level drug law 
violators are much less likely to commit another crime than high-level 
defendants and that sentence length had no effect on recidivism	rates. 
The study recommends that the money spent on jailing low-level drug 
offenders could be better spent on other criminal justice needs such as 
more police.  

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<center>
<font size=+1><b><i>
The Clinton Justice Department<br>
issued a study recommending<br>
reduction in mandatory minimum<br>
sentences.
</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

But the study has a number of problems. A "significant number" (43 
percent) of the 16,316 federal inmates in this study were non-citizens 
with unknown criminal histories.  This fact should have eliminated these 
inmates from the study.[34] In addition, the study failed to consider 
the impact that incarcerating low-level	drug sellers has on the illicit 
drug market.  Incarcerating convicted drug dealers sends a clear message 
-- drug trafficking has a price.  No one knows how many potential 
traffickers consider the price and turn to alternative employment.

<p>

Not only did the Clinton Administration call for drug legalization, 
but it also issued a 1993 report advocating needle-exchange programs 
even though these programs fail.  Before joining the Clinton 
Administration, Dr. Philip Lee was the principal investigator for a 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study released in September 
1993 which analyzed 37 needle-exchange programs.[35] The report, "The 
Public Health Impact of Needle Exchange Programs in the United States 
and Abroad," concluded[36] that "needle exchanges neither increase 
nor decrease levels of inject[able] drug use,"[37] and stated that 
"studies of the effect of needle exchange programs on HIV infection 
rates do not...and probably cannot provide clear evidence that 
needle exchange programs decrease HIV infection rates."[38]

<p>

Despite these findings, the report recommends:

<p><ul>

<li>"[T]he U.S. government should repeal the ban on federal funding 
of needle exchanges."

<p>

<li>States should repeal their prescription and/or paraphernalia laws 
banning possession of needles.

<p>

<li>Local communities should encourage the wider availability of 
sterile needles by allowing pharmacists to sell or exchange them.

</ul><p>

The Clinton Administration has encouraged needle-exchange programs, 
alleging that they will slow the advance of the virus that causes AIDS. 
Such programs, however, are not effective.

<p>

The much-publicized "Needle Park" (Platzspitz) experiment in Zurich, 
Switzerland was canceled after Swiss authorities concluded that	
needle exchanges promote crime, AIDS, drug abuse, and prostitution. 
After authorities closed the park, drug dealers and addicts moved the 
drug market to a formerly scenic bridge (named Lettensteg). The 
bridge was soon littered with thousands of discarded and probably 
contaminated needles and syringes. In February 1995, Swiss police 
fought a series of fierce gun battles to terminate Lettensteg's drug 
culture operation.

</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

A government-sponsored needle exchange program in New York City has 
met a similar fate. "Ever since the lower east side Harm Reduction 
Center, a needle exchange program, began operating in a storefront 
in a residential population of working poor, our community has 
witnessed drug abuse not seen since Operation Pressure Point cleared 
the area of drugs in the 1980s," one resident observed. "You can 
receive your government-sponsored clean needles (there is no limit 
to the number), rob and steal to get money for drugs (or sell your 
clean needles), buy cocaine in storefronts or heroin on any corner, 
then leave behind a pool of blood, dirty syringes, glassine bags, 
alcohol swabs and bottle caps....Statistics on the spread of AIDS 
cannot be the only criteria for measuring the success of the 
program."[39]

<p>

<center><h3>Interdiction Failures</h3></center>

<p>

The Clinton Administration has also failed to sustain an effective 
international drug suppression effort.

<p>

Brian Sheridan, Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Drug 
Enforcement Policy and Support, told a House Committee in October 
1994 that the Pentagon recommended $135 million in counterdrug 
budget cuts.[40] The Pentagon has also cut at least 1,000 military 
personnel from drug interdiction programs and has terminated 24 
programs because of "insufficient utility."[41] Sheridan explained, 
"We must recognize that illicit drug use is a deep-seated social 
problem which, like the problems of crime and inner-city poverty, 
will have to be addressed by all Americans over the long-term."[42]
	
<p>

An equal threat is posed by drug lords in South America. The 
Colombia-based Cali cartel is a cocaine distribution network which 
includes a corporate headquarters and franchises throughout the United 
States.  It has effectively overwhelmed the Customs Service, Coast 
Guard and the DEA. It employs sophisticated production,	transportation 
and marketing efforts.  Some laboratories are the size of industrial 
factories, operating with the unofficial endorsement of host 
governments. There are ten entry point/distribution hubs in the U.S. 
The Cali kingpins or their operations chiefs oversee regional directors, 
who in turn supervise regional "cells."  And the cocaine comes to 
American shores	through contract carriers via air, land and sea.  They 
employ cargo jets, large tractor trailers which are seldom inspected 
at the Mexican border, and ships filled to the brim with tons of 
cocaine.  For example, a 14-ton shipment of cocaine was found hidden 
inside concrete fence posts and bound for Longview, Texas via Miami.[43]

<p>

DEA director Thomas Constantine told the House Judiciary Subcommittee 
on Crime, "[O]ur crime situation is controlled by foreign criminals. 
Marketing decisions made in Cali, Colombia or the highlands of the 
Golden Triangle have a direct impact on the drug trade in the 
streets of New York or the waterfront of Miami.  Highly organized, 
technologically-advanced criminal groups have come to dominate the 
production and distribution of heroin and cocaine destined for the 
U.S."[44]

<p>

Although Clinton's DEA chief, Thomas Constantine, pledged at his 
confirmation hearing to promote "the most effective [anti-drug] 
enforcement possible under the rule of law,"  Senator Orrin Hatch 
(R-UT) cautioned, "Some people are concerned there's a different 
attitude down there [at the White House] to legalize drugs."[45]
	
<p>

During Constantine's watch, the DEA has experienced serious personnel 
and budget cuts. He shut down operations for three weeks in early 
1995 to reorganize.  Constantine has also canceled Operation Snow-Cap, 
which had slowed the production and shipment of cocaine in the source 
countries. He has discontinued the TKO kingpin operation, which 
tracked drug lords and brought them to justice.  And now he has 
directed DEA agents to turn away from overseas and focus on the 
grass-roots level, helping police departments with street-level 
suppression.  The mobile enforcement team (MET)	program places teams 
of DEA agents in communities to assist police departments.[46]

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<center>
<font size=+1><b><i>
The Clinton Administration<br>

needle-exchange programs even<br>
though these programs fail.
</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

These radical changes jeopardize the U.S.'s international interdiction 
effort and severely threaten the morale of an organization that has 
long defended our borders.  FBI director Louis Freeh told a House 
Committee on March 30, 1995, "If law enforcement is to stem or even 
slow the flood of drugs into this country, we must have a strong and 
effective presence overseas."[47]

<p>

To add insult to injury, DEA agents are subjected to Justice 
Department briefings that show how to properly use syringes to 
inject illicit drugs.  This training is part of the Clinton 
Administration's mandatory AIDS awareness training for federal 
employees.

<p>

Mr. Clinton promised to hire a strong drug czar. In April 1993, 
Clinton elevated the drug czar to the cabinet level, explaining, "I 
believe drug abuse is as serious a problem as we have in America."[48] 
Then he slashed the czar's staff 80 percent.

<p>

Clinton spokeswoman Alice Rivlin, deputy director of OMB, told a 
Congressional budget hearing, "It is not that drug policy is less 
important...On the contrary it is more important...The problem has 
been a lack of leadership, not the size of the staff."[49]

<p>

Selecting Brown does not match the President's promise to hire "a 
strong drug czar" or seek the right "leader."  Brown, a former New 
York police commissioner, left that post under the shadow of the 
Crown Heights riot.

<p>

After becoming drug czar, Brown was excluded from the White House 
communication loop.  In July 1993, White House budget officials 
accepted a major cut in anti-drug programs without consulting Brown. 
He didn't know about the arrangement until he read it in <i>The 
Washington Post</i>.[50]

<p>

<center><h3>Bad Company</h3></center>

<p>

President Clinton has surrounded himself with many counselors, but 
their wisdom with regard to drug issues deserves scrutiny.

<p>

Consider some Clinton advisors and their views on drugs:

<p><ul>

<li><b><i>Clinton's Minister.</i></b> On Sunday, April 10, 1994	the 
Clintons were at church like millions of other Americans.  That morning 
their regular pastor, the Reverend Walter Shropshire of the Foundry 
United Methodist Church, said he believed the government could create 
"a safer environment for all of us" if now-illegal drugs were legalized. 
He later explained, "I happen to have the belief that one of the things 
that we need to re-examine in our current society is the...legalization 
of some drugs.  And my belief is that if the economic portions could be 
cut out of the cocaine and heroin traffic, it might be possible to make 
a safer	environment for all of us."[51]

<p>

<li><b><i>Clinton's College Mentor.</i></b> Not only are some of Mr. 
Clinton's spiritual advisors sympathetic to legalization but so are 
some of his former academic mentors.  His former Yale law professor, 
Steven Duke, co-author of a 1993 book <i>America's Longest War: 
Rethinking Our Tragic Crusade Against Drugs</i>, advocates legalizing 
cocaine, including crack, marijuana and heroin.[52]

<p>

<li><b><i>Clinton's Campaign Advisor.</i></b> Mathea Falco was 
recruited by the Clinton/Gore campaign to advise on drug policy 
issues. She is the president of Drug Strategy, a non-profit 
organization funded by pro-legalization billionaire George Soros, who 
gave Falco's organization a reported $2 million in 1994.[53] Drug 
Strategy is a drug policy think-tank that supports the legalization 
of marijuana.

<p>

During the mid-1970's, Falco was a special assistant to the president 
of the Drug Abuse Council, Inc. and testified in Congress on narcotics 
abuse favoring a "broad" reassessment of drug policy and the review 
of the feasibility of decriminalizing marijuana	and "possibly" cocaine. 
She subsequently served as an Assistant Secretary of State for 
international narcotics under President Carter.[54]

<p>

According to the pro-drug periodical <i>High Times</i>, Falco worked 
closely with Peter Bourne, President Carter's drug policy chief who 
fell from power after he was found to have snorted cocaine at a 
National Organization for the Reform of	Marijuana Laws (NORML) 
party.[55] The magazine told its March 1993 audience that Falco believes 
drug interdiction does not work and that she would support medical use 
of marijuana and needle	exchange.  She was thought to be a candidate 
for the drug czar's job.[56]

</ul>

</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<ul>

<li><b><i>Clinton's Advisors Reviewing DEA's Performance.</i></b> 
The Clinton Administration hired Mark Kleiman and Peter	Reuter to 
review the performance of the DEA.[57]

<p>

Kleiman is an associate professor at Harvard University's Kennedy 
School of Government and author of <i>Against Excess</i>, which includes 
an endorsement of marijuana legalization.[58] He was once a drug 
policy analyst for the Department of Justice and says that the 
primary goal of drug policy should be to limit the harms drug users 
do to themselves and the resulting harms to others.

<p>

According to <i>High Times</i>, Kleiman advocates user licenses 
for alcohol and pot and served as a graduate advisor for psychedelic 
researcher Rick	Doblin.[59] He spoke at a 1990 conference entitled 
"Regulation or Prohibition: Psychedelics in the	1990s."  In April 
1993, Kleiman spoke at a conference sponsored by NORML stating, "The 
hardest, intellectually, the hardest problem, I think, facing American 
Drug Policy is how to make the psychedelics available for their 
beneficial uses to people who can get benefit from them without	
increasing use under dangerous conditions, and abuse."[60]

<p>

In October 1994, John Carnevale, director of Office of Planning and 
Budget, Executive Office of the President, Office of National Drug 
Control Policy, defended the drug czar's decision to employ Kleiman's 
services. His organization, BOTEC, Inc., Carnevale said "has conducted 
a number of important studies over the past few years for ONDCP, 
especially in the area of monitoring the emerging heroin situation...At	
the current time, BOTEC's work, for whose timeliness and quality we have 
very high regard, continues to be the analysis of heroin use trends."[61] 
Kleiman is listed by Lee Brown as one of the many "expert individuals" 
to the drug czar for the 1995 National Drug Control Strategy.[62]

<p>

<li><b><i>Clinton's White House Staff.</i></b> All White House staff 
members require security clearances. Use of illegal drugs has long 
been a disqualification for a security clearance.

<p>

One of the first indications that drugs would be viewed differently 
by the Clinton Administration was the conduct of drug-testing for 
incoming presidential staff members.  The Clinton White House waived 
drug-testing until February 15, 1993 -- almost four weeks into the 
new administration.[63] By comparison, the Bush Administration 
required all new presidential aides to obtain negative test results 
before they could start work at the White House.[64]

<p>

The problem with staff drug testing continued for more than a year. 
In July 1994, then-press secretary Dee Dee Myers confirmed that one 
third of the White House staff still did not have "permanent 
passes."[65] This indicated a possible problem with drug-testing 
compliance. She admitted to being one of those without a pass, explaining 
she didn't have time to complete the paperwork.[66]

<p>

Director of White House Administration Patsy Thomasson oversees the 
security passes.  She once served at the right hand of an Arkansas 
investor, Dan Lasater, who pleaded guilty to federal drug charges. Her 
past association with a drug felon compelled the Senate to vote 98-0 
in June 1994 to require the president to certify that Thomasson	has 
no history of drug abuse.[67]

<font size=+1><b><i>
One of the first indications<br>
that drugs would be viewed<br>
differently by the Clinton<br>
Administration was the conduct<br>
of drug-testing for incoming<br>
presidential staff members.
</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<ul>

The suspicions about the White House staff linger. For example, the 
<i>Washington Times</i> reported in January 1995 that White House 
staffers have been seen	using drugs at parties around Washington. 
The paper quoted an unnamed source, "There's this private little 
social scene and everybody just assumes that no one's going to 
tattletale." Allegedly, one of the drug-using staff members works on 
the White House's National Security Council.[68]

<p>

Newt Gingrich ignited a firestorm on December 4, 1994 when he said, "I 
had a senior law enforcement official tell me that, in his judgment, 
up to a quarter of the White House Staff, when they first came in, 
had used drugs in the last four or five years...it's very clear that 
they had huge problems getting people through security clearances 
because they kept bringing people in who had a lot of things that 
weren't very easy to clear."[69]

<p>

White House Chief of Staff Leon	Panetta rebutted the allegation. "There 
is no one in the White House who uses drugs."  But according to 
the <i>Washington Times</i>, White House staffers who frequent the 
Oval Office were seen "passing around joints [marijuana cigarettes]" 
at a local party.[70]

<p>

An unnamed senior administration official said that Gingrich got 
the number right but the time period wrong.  He said that a quarter 
of the White House staff admitted to using illegal drugs at some point 
in the past, however, that's well below the national average of almost 
40 percent.  Miss Myers noted, "Only one employee has failed a random 
drug test and that employee was a career person in a non-policy	
role."[71]

<p>

As recently as March 27, 1995, Miss Thomasson told a Senate subcommittee 
that 11	White House staffers are in a special random drug-testing 
program because of concerns about "recent drug use."  She also 
acknowledged that volunteers without adequate security clearances have 
been given access to sensitive areas in the White House and added that 
92.2 percent of eligible staff members had received permanent entrance 
passes.[72]

</ul><p>

<center><h3>Other Pro-Legalization Allies</h3></center>

<p>

The Clinton Administration's retreat in the drug war has encouraged 
a wide range of pro-legalization advocates, including:

<p><ul>

<li><b><i>Ethan Nadelmann.</i></b> He heads a pro-drug organization, 
the Lindesmith Center, which is heavily funded by billionaire George 
Soros.[73] Soros is pushing the "harm reduction" agenda, which is 
widely viewed as a first step toward legalization.  Soros's goal "is 
to invigorate and support a broader debate on drug policy" and to shift 
from drug war to "drug peace."[74]

<p>

Nadelmann advances the notion that illegal drug use is a private issue 
and predicts that "in another five or ten years maybe the right over 
one's consciousness, the right to possess and consume drugs, may be 
as powerfully and as widely understood as the other rights of Americans	
are."[75]

<p>

Nadelmann told <i>Reason</i> magazine, "The replacement of the 
Bush Administration with the Clinton Administration was generally a 
good thing.  It brought in a lot of new blood, new thinking. Lee 
Brown is not what I would call a desirable drug czar, but he's no 
William Bennett, either. There's more room for consideration of 
alternatives."[76]

<p>

<li><b><i>Rep. Barney Frank (D-MA).</i></b> Congressman Frank told 
a 1994 NORML conference, "I think we ought to make smoking marijuana 
legal."[77] He also told a Harvard Law School conference titled, 
"Crime, Drugs, Health and Prohibition," that the government spends 
too much money to stop drug trafficking.[78] He told a radio 
audience, "We should give the money to drug treatment and local 
cops."[79]

<p>

<li><b><i>Eric Sterling.</i></b> He serves as president of the 
nonprofit Criminal Justice Policy Foundation and is a former counsel 
to the U.S. House Subcommittee on Crime and principal aide in 
developing parts of the Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984 and 
the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986.

<p>

He currently works with the Centers for Disease Control and the 
D.C. Commission on Public Health and has been honored by the U.S. 
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and the U.S. Postal 
Inspection Service. Sterling told a 1991 NORML conference, "Hi,	
I'm Eric Sterling and I'm a 15-year member of NORML and I'm really 
glad to be here to talk to so many of you...How many of you are 
stoned now?  Show of hands.  Honestly, how many of you are stoned 
now...about a quarter.  And I ask that question because I used to 
get stoned at NORML conferences	and it was my favorite, favorite 
times [sic] to get stoned."[80]

</ul>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<center>
<font size=+1><b><i>
White House staffers have<br>

parties around Washington.
</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<ul>

Mr. Sterling was a guest speaker at the 6th Annual Conference on 
Drug-Free Schools and Communities.  Some attendees called for his 
removal based on his open advocacy of drug use.

<p>

He continues to speak out for drug legalization. For example, he 
was a guest speaker at the 1993 Fifth Annual Hemp Freedom Rally in 
Massachusetts and spoke at a pro-pot rally in front of the White House 
on January 21, 1993.  He led the crowd in chanting "Inhale to the 
Chief."

<p>

<li><b><i>Organizations like the Drug Policy Foundation.</i></b> 
Michigan drug czar Robert Peterson observed, "Groups like [the] 
Drug Policy Foundation are run by three-piece-suited guys, not dope 
smokers, and they say they don't support legalization, that they're 
just studying alternatives...But I think that's just to put a 
respectable front on what they are really doing, lobbying for 
legalization...I got hold of the agenda for one of their meetings, 
and it included discussions of money laundering and bank secrecy."[81]

<p>

The DPF	will award more than $1 million in grants to promote drug 
legalization programs. For example, in February 1995, DPF awarded 
$25,000 to Cannabis Action Network, which advocates marijuana use; 
$15,000 to NORML for National Medical Marijuana Day; and $3,000 to 
the National AIDS Brigade which	promotes needle exchange programs.[82]

</ul><p>

<center><h3>Conclusion</h3></center>

<p>

The Clinton Administration's actions and its advisors' reputations 
suggest a general lack of commitment to the drug war.  With drug abuse 
on the rise, the President must lead the nation in an all-out effort 
to turn the tide of drugs away from our shores and especially away from 
our children.

<title>THE ONE-HOUSE SCHOOLROOM</title>

<body>

<center>

<img src="/townhall/FRC/fampol/fampolbl.gif">

<h1>The One-House Schoolroom</h1>
<h2><i>The Extraordinary Influence of<br>
Family Life on Student Learning</i></h2>

</center>

<p>

<font size=+3>S</font>he grew up during the depression in a small mill 
town in the South.  Her father was a textile worker.  Her mother, a 
homemaker. She not only became the first member of her family to go to 
college, but she also went on to get a graduate degree, to teach high 
school chemistry, and to be named Teacher of the Year.

<p>

So, when Lydia Lowie was asked several years ago to give a
speech describing the most influential teacher in her life, most
expected the retired schoolteacher to wax eloquent about an inspiring
high school science instructor or a brilliant college chemistry
professor.

<p>

Instead, Lowie talked about her mother.  That's right, this
highly-accomplished schoolteacher who had for years paid dues
to a teacher's union that boasts, &quot;If you can read this,
thank a teacher,&quot; identified as her most influential instructor
a poor, simple woman with a high school education.[1]

<p>

While some might be tempted to dismiss Lowie's comments as
sweetly sentimental, the truth is mothers -- and fathers -- exert
far more influence over their children's intellectual development
than is commonly realized.  In fact, more than three decades of
research shows that families have greater influence over a child's
academic performance than any other factor -- including schools.

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<font size=+1><b><i>
Families have greater influence<br>
over a child's academic performance<br>
than any other factor -- including<br>
schools.
</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

Yet, curiously, almost all public discussion about improving
education in this country centers around school-based reforms
of one kind or another.  Unless and until our education debate
begins to focus on the family, significantly improving student
performance in America is likely to remain an elusive goal.

<p>

<center><h3>Family Matters</h3></center>

<p>

Just as Jed Clampett once discovered &quot;buffalo crude&quot;
while shooting for some food, much of the early research measuring
the extraordinary influence of family life on student achievement
was uncovered somewhat by accident.

<p>

In the mid-1960s, University of Chicago sociologist James
Coleman led a major research study designed to explain why students
in certain schools or in certain classes within a school perform
better, on average, than students attending other schools or other
classes.  Coleman's pioneering research weighed the relative influence
on student achievement of different school factors (such as per-pupil
spending and school size) as well as the influence of different
teacher variables (such as teacher experience and levels of education
completed).

<p>

While several school factors proved to have a modest effect
on student performance, they paled in comparison to the influence
of family background.  According to Coleman, there is a &quot;powerful
relation of the child's own family background characteristics
to his achievement, a relation stronger than that of any school
factors.&quot;[2]

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<center>
<font size=+1><b><i>
What families</i> do <i>really matters.<br>
Differences in student learning<br>
are not determined simply by the<br>
quality of one's gene pool or by<br>
which side of the tracks one lives<br>
on. Instead, differences in child<br>
learning stem significantly from the<br>
values, habits, and relational<br>
dynamics at work within the household.
</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

Coleman's research spawned a number of studies replicating
his work and building upon it.  These studies consistently confirmed
Coleman's chief finding that families exert considerable influence
over student achievement.  For example, a 1984 research review
by the National Institute of Education concluded, &quot;Extensive,
substantial, and convincing evidence suggests that parents play
a crucial role in both the home and school environments with respect
to facilitating the development of intelligence, achievement,
and competence in children.&quot;[3] A 1993 survey of the research
literature by Benjamin Bloom and his colleagues reported, &quot;The
home environment is a most powerful factor in determining the
school learning of students -- their level of school achievement,
their interest in school learning, and the number of years of
schooling they will receive.[4] And a 1994 report issued by the
U.S. Department of Education noted, &quot;Thirty years of research
show that greater family involvement in children's learning is
a critical link to achieving a high-quality education ... controllable
home factors account for almost all the differences in average
student achievement.[5]

<p>

What is especially important about this body of research is
that it consistently shows that what families <I>do</I> really
matters.  That is, the research shows that differences in student
learning are not determined simply by the quality of one's gene
pool or by which side of the tracks one lives on.  Instead, differences
in child learning stem significantly from the values, habits and
relational dynamics at work within the household.

<p>

Indeed, a research review published in the <I>Phi Delta Kappan</I>
found that the home learning environment has an effect on achievement
that is at least twice as great as family social-economic status
(SES).[6] A Study commissioned by the Toronto Board of Education
found that parental encouragement at home and participation in
school activities have a more significant effect on children's
achievement than either SES or student ability.[7] And Bloom and
his colleagues summarize their findings by observing, &quot;Parents
from a variety of cultural backgrounds and with different levels
of education, income or occupational status can and do provide
stimulating home environments that support and encourage the learning
of their children.  It is what parents do in the home rather than
their status that is important.[8]

<p>

<center><h3>A Stimulating Home Environment</h3></center>

<p>

What characterizes the home learning environment in which children
are most likely to succeed?  In a 1994 review of the research
literature,[9] Anne Henderson and Nancy Berla of the National Committee
for Citizens in Education reported that children fare best when
their parents:

<p><ul>

<li>establish a daily family routine (including regular bedtimes
and times to study);

<p>

<li>monitor out-of-school activities (particularly television
viewing);

<p>

<li>model the value of learning, self-discipline and hard work
(especially through use of newspapers, encyclopedias, and other
home educational tools);

<p>

<li>express high but realistic expectations for achievement (and
reward success with special recognition);

<p>

<li>encourage children's development and progress in school (by
helping with homework, maintaining dialogue with teachers, and
the like);

<p>

<li>stimulate reading, writing, and discussions among family members
(including mealtime discussions, bedtime stories, and letters
to relatives); and

<p>

<li>facilitate use of community resources (such as libraries,
museums, sports programs, music lessons, and cultural events).

</ul><p>

That these &quot;home&quot; variables contribute to children's
learning should not surprise anyone.  What may surprise many,
however, is just how much difference &quot;home&quot; factors
can make.

<p>

Take, for example, family meals together.  While some might
consider this a rather trivial family ritual, several studies
have found the frequency of family meals together to be a strong
predictor of student test scores.[10] In explaining this high positive
correlation,  Chester Finn of the Hudson Institute says that consistent
mealtimes give parents regular opportunities to ask questions
about what kids are doing in school.  Mealtimes also give parents
regular opportunities to broaden children's educational horizons.
For example, Theodore Roosevelt's interest in public affairs
is said to have been cultivated by the rich dinnertime discussions 
his family regularly enjoyed when he was a boy.

<p>

Just as family interactions around the dinner table pay surprising
dividends, the number and variety of learning tools (books, tapes,
puzzles, encyclopedias, computers, and the like) in the home have
a far more profound effect on student achievement than is commonly 
realized. In his groundbreaking book, <I>School's Out</I>, Lewis 
Perelman of the Discovery Institute reports that data from the High 
School and Beyond Survey show that the number of learning tools 
available in the home is a much stronger predictor of academic 
achievement than factors such as whether parents expect 
children to attend college.[11] Moreover, Perelman argues that 
a much-publicized 1990 book by Terry Moe and John Chubb of 
the Brookings Institute underestimates the influence
of family factors on student achievement because it overlooks
data showing an extremely high correlation between schools with
high achievers and students who have an above average number of
learning tools in the home.[12]

<p>

Other studies also have found a high correlation between home
learning tools and student achievement.  For example, a report
issued by the Appalachia Educational Laboratory shows that apart
from fixed characteristics like family size and SES, student achievement
is influenced by variables like having books available, reading
to children, taking trips, and guiding TV watching.[13] A study of
third graders in southern California indicates that high achievers
are more likely than other students to spend time on homework,
to use the dictionary, and to take part in learning activities
with their parents.[14] And education analyst Ann Milne concludes
from her review of more than 100 studies, &quot;What is important
is the ability of the parent(s) to provide pro-educational resources
for their children -- be they financial, material, or experiential.&quot;[15]

<p>

Not surprisingly, the positive impact of home learning tools
is especially high when these materials are used in direct parent-child
interaction.  For example, a 1985 report from the National Academy
of Education found that the single most important activity for
building the knowledge required for eventual success in reading
is reading aloud to children.[16] Moreover, a 1992 study at the City
University of New York found that average IQ scores of low-income
preschoolers are boosted by nearly seven percentage points for
each day of the week that a mother reads to her child.[17]

The benefits of parent-child verbal interaction can also
be seen in recent research showing preschoolers placed in full-time
day care settings often lag behind their home-reared peers in
language development.  What is the primary reason for the difference?
Young children at home spend much of their day interacting verbally
with people (particularly Mom) whose language skills are more
advanced, whereas kids in day care spend most of their day interacting
verbally with peers whose language skills are no more developed
than their own.[18]

<p>

<center><h3>Structure Counts, Too</h3></center>

<p>

To say that family practices and processes make a significant
contribution to child learning does not imply that &quot;non-process&quot;
family factors (such as family income, size, structure, genetic
make-up, and parents' education) are somehow unimportant.  Indeed,
Milne reports that research consistently shows &quot;that both
males and females from single-parent families performed less well
than those from two-parent families.&quot;[19] A University of California
study shows that &quot;parent inputs do reduce the proportion
of low achievers, but they do not overcome the disadvantages of
low income.&quot;[20] Studies of twins suggest that genetic factors
account for at least one-third to one-half of the differences
in IQ scores.[21] And a study of Los Angeles elementary school students
finds that &quot;home process variables, parental responsibility
variables, and family background circumstances <I>worked together</I>
to shape student achievement patterns (emphasis added).&quot;[22]

<p>

These and other studies indicate that certain family structures
and backgrounds facilitate child learning more than others.  And
they suggest that the combined effect on student achievement of
&quot;process&quot; and &quot;non-process&quot; variables is most
apparent when either both sets of factors naturally pull in the
same direction (when, for example, highly-educated parents make
time to teach their children things at home) or when family roles
are adapted to facilitate home learning.

<p>

Consider, for example, the effect of family size on child learning.
For many years, researchers have reported that a child's learning
potential is threatened by the addition of new siblings to a household.
This notion that &quot;smaller families are better&quot; springs
from the fact that, in most American households, children are
primarily educational &quot;consumers&quot; taking from their
parents' learning resources, rather than significant &quot;producers&quot;
contributing to the family's overall learning environment.  When
children are given opportunities to contribute meaningfully to
the home learning environment, however, the negative effect of
increased family size can be eliminated  -- if not turned into
a positive.

<p>

That, at least, is one of the most important findings of a
fascinating 1992 University of Michigan study about the children
of Southeast Asian &quot;boat people&quot; who came to America
during the late 1970s and early 1980s.[23] This study found that
the refugee children's remarkable educational achievement (their
average scores were well above average in math and science, and
only slightly below average in reading and English) was due in
no small part to an effect similar to that found in the old one-room
schoolhouse.  Here's how the study's authors describe a typical
evening in a refugee home:  &quot;After dinner, the table is cleared,
and homework begins.  The older children, both male and female,
help their younger siblings.  Indeed, they seem to learn as much
from teaching as from being taught . . . [A] great amount of learning
goes on at these times -- in terms of skills, habits, attitudes,
and expectations as well as the content of a subject . . . Such
sibling involvement demonstrates how a large family can encourage
and enhance academic success.&quot;

<p>

Not only does this study of Indochinese refugee families challenge
prevailing assumptions about the educational impact of larger
family size, but it also challenges prevailing assumptions about
whether poorly-educated parents can contribute significantly to
their children's cognitive development.  Even though the refugee
parents had very limited English skills, they still enhanced their
children's literacy by reading to them.  In fact, &quot;the effects
of being read to held up statistically whether the children were
read to in English or in their native language,&quot; the University
of Michigan research team report.  &quot;This finding suggests
that parental English literacy skills may not play a vital role
in determining school performance.  Rather, other aspects of the
experience -- emotional ties between parent and child, cultural
validation and wisdom shared in stories read in the child's native
language, or value placed on reading and learning -- extend to
schoolwork.&quot;

<p>

<center><h3>Policy Implications</h3></center>

<p>

Just as it is important for families to appreciate the magnitude
of their influence over child learning, it is also important for
education officials to design policies and programs that envision
parents playing a major role in their children's cognitive and
moral development.

<p>

Unfortunately, this occurs far too infrequently -- in part
because education officials have far less control over family
structures and processes (thankfully!) than over school policies
and procedures.

<p>

Yet, if hopes for reversing America's education decline are
to be realized, serious attention must be given to the role of
families in improving student performance.  As Bloom and his colleagues
acknowledge, &quot;It seems most unlikely that a significant improvement
in the quality of education for all students can be achieved without
active support from other quarters . . . particularly families.&quot;[24]

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

a far more profound effect on<br>
student achievement than is<br>
commonly realized.
</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

To that end, three reforms are especially needed:

<p>

<b><i>1. Redefine &quot;parental involvement&quot; to give emphasis
to the role parents play as their children's first and most important
teachers.</i></b> While virtually everyone these days supports greater
&quot;parental involvement&quot; in education, few Americans --
including many parents themselves -- really believe it is critical.
If educating children is a pot luck dinner, then most Americans
perceive that schools provide the &quot;meat and potatoes,&quot;
while families contribute the dessert.

<p>

This analogy can almost be taken literally.  In many places
today, &quot;parental involvement&quot; is defined to include
little more than making brownies for school bake sales, being
room mothers for class parties, volunteering to chaperone school
field trips, serving on school advisory committees, and attending
open houses, PTA meetings, sporting events, plays, and musical
performances.

<p>

While no one would dispute the legitimacy of some -- if not
all -- of these functions, it is instructive that most of these
traditional parental functions do not center around learning.
Indeed, traditional definitions of &quot;parental involvement&quot;
do not fully appreciate the instructional contribution parents
can and should make to their children's cognitive development.

<p>

This is unfortunate, for the instructional role of parents
is not only very important, but is often more appealing to families
than other forms of involvement.  &quot;What appears to be a crucial
role for black parents is their role as teachers in the home,&quot;
notes Jacqueline Jordan Irvine in her book, <I>Black Students
and School Failure</I>.  &quot;It is the role that parents prefer
and the one directly related to the achievement of their children.&quot;[25]

<p>

In fact, Irvine believes part of the reason many parents are
apathetic about serving on advisory boards and in other traditional
capacities is because they perceive that their roles on such committees
are &quot;marginal&quot; and that their participation has little
or no direct impact on the achievement of their children.

<p>

These observations are echoed in a study of nearly 5,000 elementary 
school parents by researchers Steven Melnick and Richard Fiene.
In a paper presented to the American Education Research Association,
Melnick and Fiene report that &quot;parents did not want to be
part of a 'professional-client' relationship with the school or
to be patronized in any way.&quot;[26]

<p>

&quot;Parents belong at the center of a young child's education,&quot;
says former U.S. Secretary of Education William Bennett.  &quot;The
single best way to improve elementary education is to strengthen
parents' role in it.&quot;[27]

<p>

<b><i>2. Refocus &quot;educational choice&quot; to give emphasis
to the way in which it increases parental involvement in education.</i></b>
Currently, the case for giving parents &quot;school choice&quot;
often emphasizes ways schools would improve in a competitive free
market environment.  If parents easily could move their children
from one school to another, the argument goes, then schools would
work harder to educate students, thereby raising the quality of
all schools.

<p>

There is nothing wrong with this argument.  Competition would
improve schools.  That is a bedrock free market principle.

<p>

But this is not the only (or even the most) compelling argument
for adopting an educational choice plan.  Just as a break-up of
the government school monopoly is apt to affect supply-side behavior
and give us better schools, it is also apt to affect demand-side
behavior and give us better families. If genuine &quot;educational
choice&quot; existed, parents would be active, discriminating
consumers of various educational options rather than passive recipients
of schooling chosen by government planners using proximity-is-destiny
guidelines.

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<center>
<font size=+1><b><i>
This research argues for<br>
policies which facilitate<br>
greater parental involvement<br>
in children's lives -- not<br>
year-round, all-day, cradle-<br>
to-college school programs<br>
that leave little time for<br>
families to learn together.
</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

Indeed, no longer would parents enjoy the privilege of blaming
the government for supplying bad schools.  With parental choice
comes parental responsibility.  Ultimately, parents would be responsible
for the decisions they make -- whether those decisions produced
positive outcomes or negative ones.

<p>

In such an environment, parents undoubtedly would devote greater
time and attention to considering ways to improve their children's
academic outcomes.  They would carefully weigh the advantages
and disadvantages of different educational options -- and carefully
monitor the outcomes of various educational decisions.

<p>

And so long as the resources with which they have to work are
fungible, parents would be empowered to consider and pursue all
sorts of learning strategies that might benefit their children
-- including some that lie outside the realm of conventional schooling.

<p>

<b><i>3. Replace the existing model of education, which is heavily
based upon late-19th Century norms, with a new model designed
to seize 21st Century opportunities.</i></b> Several months before
issuing its much-publicized 1994 report on parental involvement,
the U.S. Department of Education issued a separate report that
said America's schoolchildren are &quot;prisoners&quot; of an
outmoded school schedule.[28] Specifically, the report said that
the typical nine-month school calendar (which was originally built
around the annual agricultural schedule) hinders learning continuity
and requires teachers to do considerable review after summer breaks.
The report also said the average school day ends before teachers
have adequate opportunity to cover all the subjects contemporary
schools seek to address -- and before many employed parents arrive
home from work.

<p>

Based on these observations, the report called for lengthening
the school day and the school year.  It also called for expanding
early childhood programs directed at preschoolers, in the name
of improving school readiness.

<p>

While at first blush these ideas may appear eminently reasonable,
their collective thrust towards more schooling fails to appreciate
the fact that data from the National Center for Education Statistics
show that U.S. students already rack up more &quot;seat&quot;
time in school each year than their counterparts in Japan, Germany,
England, Italy, Canada, and Korea. (Compared to others, however,
time in U.S. schools is more likely to be devoted to non-academic
pursuits like gym, driver's education, counseling, and assemblies.)[29]

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<center>
<font size=+1><b><i>
The result would be customized<br>
learning programs tailored to<br>
the unique needs of each child,<br>
with many part-time schooling<br>
options between the current<br>
polar opposites of 100 percent<br>
home schooling and 100 percent<br>
conventional schooling.
</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

More importantly, the drive for more schooling seems to be
at odds with the growing volume of research data showing how critically
important parental involvement is to children's learning.   Indeed,
this research argues for policies which facilitate greater parental
involvement in children's lives -- not year-round, all-day, cradle-to-college
school programs that leave little time for families to learn together.

<p>

Moreover, the most interesting educational trend in America
today -- the growth in home schooling -- is being driven both
by a frustration with rationalized, factory-style, morally-neutral
schooling and by a desire on the part of many parents to be highly
involved in the moral and cognitive development of their children.
What is especially interesting about this trend is the degree
to which some public school teachers have embraced it.

<p>

&quot;Family is the main engine of education,&quot; observed
junior high teacher John Taylor Gatto in a speech commemorating
his selection as New York City's Teacher of the Year. &quot;If
we use schooling to break children away from parents -- and make
no mistake, that has been the central function of schools since
John Cotton announced it as the purpose of the Bay Colony schools
in 1650 and Horace Mann announced it as the purpose of Massachusetts
schools in 1850 -- we're going to continue to have the horror
show we have right now.&quot;[30]

<p>

Gatto finds it &quot;curious&quot; that the literacy rate in
Massachusetts prior to compulsory attendance laws was 98 percent
-- seven percentage points higher than it has been at any point
since.  And he finds it &quot;curious&quot; that home-schooled
students score significantly better than their conventionally-schooled
peers on achievement tests.  Indeed, a 1990 study of more than
1,500 randomly-selected home-schooling families found that home-educated
students score, on average, at or above the 80th percentile in
all areas of standardized achievement tests.[31]

<p>

While conceding that we won't &quot;get rid of schools anytime
soon,&quot; Gatto says greater attention needs to be given to
facilitating learning opportunities that bring parents and children
together.  &quot;The curriculum of family is at the heart of any
good life,&quot; says Gatto.  &quot;The way to sanity in education
is for our schools to take the lead in releasing the stranglehold
of institutions on family life.&quot;[32]

<p>

Similarly, Seattle public school teacher David Guterson says
&quot;the notion of parents as educators of their children is,
in the broad sense, neither extreme nor outlandish.&quot;  Indeed,
Guterson points out that &quot;homeschooled children learn under
the ideal conditions that schoolteachers persistently cry out
for.&quot;[33]

<p>

In a compelling essay for <I>Harper's</I> magazine, Guterson
writes, &quot;Today it is considered natural for parents to leave
their children's education entirely in the hands of institutions.
In a better world, we [parents] would see <I>ourselves</I> as
responsible and our schools primarily as resources.  Schools would
cease to be <I>places</I> in the sense that prisons and hospitals
are places; instead education would be embedded in the life of
the community . . . Parents would measure their inclinations and
abilities and immerse themselves, to varying degrees and in varying
ways, in a larger educational system designed to <i>assist</i> them.
Schools -- educational resource centers -- would provide materials,
technology, and expertise instead of classrooms, babysitters,
and bureaucrats.&quot;

<p>

Guterson's vision of schools as interactive &quot;educational
resource centers&quot; is shared by Lewis Perelman, a former high
school physics teacher in New York state.  Indeed, Perelman believes
the era of conventional classroom-style schooling is coming to
a close, giving way to a variety of &quot;hyperlearning&quot;
strategies better suited to the computer-driven, information age
in which we now live.[34]

<p>

For families to be able to take full advantage of emerging
learning opportunities, Perelman believes school choice -- a one
time decision at the beginning of the school year -- will not
be enough.  Instead, he says parents will want and need to make
educational &quot;choices&quot; on an ongoing basis, much as they
do currently in other realms of economic activity.

<p>

Obviously, different families would answer education questions
differently, just as different families currently answer transportation
questions differently.  Some would lean heavily on do-it-yourself
strategies (driving oneself, teaching one's own), others would
depend heavily on outside services (taking the bus, enrolling
in classes).  But this model of education would be highly flexible
and adaptable.  Rather than offering a one-size-fits-all public
school monopoly, this new model would accommodate the different
needs and interests of different families.
<p>

The result would be &quot;customized&quot; learning programs
tailored to the unique needs of each child, with many &quot;part-time&quot;
schooling options between the current polar opposites of 100 percent
homeschooling and 100 percent conventional schooling.

<p>

<center><h3>Reviving Tuition Tax Credits</h3></center>

<p>

Quite appropriately, this new model would make parents the
principal educational decision-makers.  This doesn't mean that
parents would be experts in every educational subject any more
than consumers of microwave ovens are experts in microwave technology.
It simply means parents would be primarily responsible for the
moral and cognitive development of their 6-18 year-olds, just
as they currently are primarily responsible for the moral and
cognitive development of their children under the age of six.

<p>

And it means education policy-makers increasingly would need
to replace direct funding of schools with tax credits that empower
parents.  Tax credits are superior to vouchers as a means of empowering
families for a number of reasons, not the least of which is that
tax credits are more fungible.  Indeed, one of the reasons college
tuition expenses have increased at such a rapid rate in recent
years is because so many students partially or completely pay
for their higher education with non-fungible grants, loans, or
scholarships. Since college officials know that student aid
cannot be used for any other purpose, they have an easier time
increasing tuition expenses than would be the case if a larger
share of tuition expenses were being paid with cash that could
be used for other purposes.

<p>

How might a fungible educational tax credit initially be structured?
Perhaps the best plan would be modeled after the federal tax
code's current treatment of tax deductions. That is, the federal 
government could offer a &quot;standard&quot; educational tax credit 
of say, $400 per-child to all parents who have school-aged children, 
and an &quot;itemized&quot; educational tax credit option of up to
say, $1,600 per child would be available to families that
incur significant educational expenses for which they have receipts.
This would give all parents a hassle-free means of investing
in their children's education by doing things like purchasing
home learning tools (books, puzzles, computer equipment, art supplies,
etc.), and paying tuition expenses (for conventional classroom
instruction and/or for special learning opportunities like dance
lessons or summer camp).

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<center>
<font size=+1><b><i>
If educating children is a<br>

Americans perceive that schools<br>

</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

Funding such a plan could come from the existing expenditures
made by the federal government for education-related programs.

<p>

State governments could offer similar programs, drawing upon
resources saved from lower enrollment in all-day public schools
and from other sources.

<p>

To be sure, these ideas would not be popular with teachers'
union leaders, federal education bureaucrats, and other parts
of the &quot;education blob&quot; as Bennett is fond of calling
it.  But folks like Keith Geiger (head of the National Education
Association) can't have it both ways.  If, as Gieger has argued,
&quot;the most effective and cost efficient place for children
to acquire the foundation for learning and moral values is in
the home,&quot;  then it stands to reason that solutions to America's
education problems ought to be primarily home-based, not school-based.[35]

<p>

Certainly, parental empowerment strategies would benefit children
coming from strong families.

<p>

But these strategies would also benefit children coming from
disadvantaged environments whose educational experiences would
become more &quot;customized&quot; as learning opportunities become
more varied and tailored to the individual.

<p>

To be sure, some children would still fall through the cracks.
But the grim reality of education in America today is that many,
many children are already falling through the cracks.  And many,
many more will do so in the future if we continue to focus our
education debate on schools instead of families.

<p>

&quot;We should think clearly about the problems of schools
[and] ask ourselves why every attempt to correct them seems doomed
to fail,&quot;  Guterson writes.  &quot;We should recognize that
schools will never solve the bedrock problems of education.&quot;[36]

<p>

Only families can. Only families will.

<p>

That is the lesson Guterson believes Americans need to learn.
If indeed we learn it, this time we really should thank a teacher.

<title>BEIJING'S AFTERMATH: A CLOSER LOOK AT THE U.N. CONFERENCE</title>

<body>

<center>

<img src="/townhall/FRC/fampol/fampolgn.gif">

<h1>Beijing's Aftermath</h1>
<h2><i>A Closer Look at the U.N. Conference</i></h2>

</center>

<font size=+3>A</font>fter much heated debate prior to and during the 
United Nations Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing, China, the 
final Platform for Action was adopted on September 15, 1995.

<p>

What does the final document say?  And what are the implications of the
document for families, both in America and abroad?  This report
seeks to answer these questions as well as to shed light on the
inner processes surrounding the adoption of the Beijing Platform.

<p>

<center><h3>General Assessment</h3></center>

<p>

The United Nations spent $2.5 million to sponsor the Beijing
conference -- $1.8 million for conference services and $700,000
for public information.  Moreover, China incurred additional expenses
to host the event.  It took 12 days and a half-dozen committees
for the 4,969 delegates representing 189 countries to hammer out
the Beijing Platform for Action -- all the time under constant
pressure from 4,020 non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and
the watchful eyes of 3,235 members of the media.

<p>

The Beijing document, written over the course of two years, primarily
by NGOs from the old-line radical women's movement in collaboration
with several U.N. staff, arrived in Beijing with one third of
its text in brackets to show it was under challenge by various
government delegates.  (Brackets denoted areas of the text which
were disputed by government delegates.  No brackets could remain
in the final document.)

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<font size=+1><b><i>
What the feminists wanted<br>
from the Beijing conference<br>
was a redefinition of 'woman'<br>
in the radical feminist mold.
</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

The document that emerged from Beijing was an unwieldy mixture
of ideas, reflecting, in part, the many different factions represented.
But by far, this &quot;agenda for women's empowerment&quot; was
most heavily influenced by radical feminists advocating a &quot;gender
perspective.&quot;  In fact, several prominent national delegations
were led by radical feminists -- notably those from the United States,
Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the Caribbean and the European
Union.  These delegations demonstrated their determination to
extend international recognition of women's reproductive &quot;rights&quot;
beyond the Cairo Conference of 1994.

<p>

What the feminists wanted from the Beijing conference was a redefinition
of &quot;woman&quot; in the radical feminist mold.  They wanted
the U.N. to declare that women had a universal right to abortion
and that abortion was an acceptable means of family planning.
They wanted to enshrine the &quot;rights&quot; of adolescents
to information and medical services where sex and AIDS were concerned,
without the &quot;interference&quot; of parents.  They wanted
an endorsement of &quot;sexual orientation&quot; as an entree
for lesbian &quot;rights&quot; and, short of that, they wanted
the phrase &quot;in all its various forms&quot; appended to all
mentions of &quot;the family&quot; in the document, so as to make
way for non-traditional unions.

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<font size=+1><b><i>
Abortion was not declared<br>
a universal right nor<br>
accepted as a means of<br>

</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

What the feminists ended up with was something in between.  Abortion
was not declared a universal right nor accepted as a means of
family planning in the Platform.  However, controlling one's sexual 
and reproductive activity was declared
a &quot;human right.&quot;  Parents' rights were not completely
overruled, but they were subordinated to &quot;the best interests
of the child.&quot; Lesbian &quot;rights&quot; language was finally excluded 
at 4:45 a.m. the day scheduled for the adoption of the document, as weary
delegates looking for a few hours of sleep simply deleted all
references to sexual orientation from the document.  Nonetheless,
as Main Committee Chair Patricia Licuanan pointed out, this did
not change the fact that the day before, for the first time, a
lesbian had addressed a U.N. plenary on behalf of lesbian &quot;rights.&quot;

<p>

<center><h3>Issues in the Beijing Document</h3></center>

<p>

It must be acknowledged that the Beijing document contains some
positive aspects in that it denounces many terrible injustices
still suffered by women -- especially women in the Third World.
For example, the Platform denounces societies where son-preference
is practiced.  It spotlights poverty as a cause of women's suffering.
It condemns domestic battering and harassment in the workplace
and denounces forced prostitution, pornography, female genital
mutilation, bride-burning, sexual slavery and forced sterilization.
It condemns rape, especially as a weapon of war.

<p>

Still, as critics have pointed out, the document cultivates a
terrible moral and philosophic blindness to the human dignity
of women.  In many ways, the document is a monument to the &quot;exaggerated
individualism&quot; which characterizes the radical feminist movement.
It sees the role of wife and mother as impediments to a woman's
self-realization while refusing to recognize the harms, such as
disease and poverty, that are caused by irresponsible sexual behavior.

<p>

To take the issues in the Beijing document one by one:

<p>

<h4>1. Women's Roles</h4>

<p>

Despite the fact that 70 percent of the world's women are wives
and mothers, the Beijing document barely considers them in this
capacity.  Positive comments on women in connection with the family
are stuffed into a single paragraph (number 30), which reads:

<p><blockquote>

<i>

&quot;Women play a critical role in the family.  The family is
the basic unit of society and as such should be strengthened.
It is entitled to receive comprehensive protection and support.
In different cultural, political and social systems, various
forms of the family exist.  The rights, capabilities and responsibilities
of family members must be respected.  Women make a great contribution
to the welfare of the family and to the development of society,
which is still not recognized or considered in its full importance.
The social significance of maternity, motherhood, and the role
of parents in the family and in the upbringing of children should
be acknowledged.  Maternity, motherhood, parenting and the role
of women in procreation must not be a basis for discrimination
nor restrict the full participation of women in society.  Recognition
should also be given to the important role often played by women in many 
countries in caring for other members of their family.&quot;

</i>

</blockquote><p>

This paragraph is one of the few passages in the document which
speaks of women in connection with the family.  Another mention
(barely a nod) is paragraph 245b which urges that women's life
experiences, &quot;including, but not limited to their experiences
of balancing work and family responsibilities as mothers, as professionals,
as managers and entrepreneurs,&quot; be included in media depictions.

<p>

Elsewhere in the document, marriage is mentioned in a negative
way as, for example, in the context of dowry problems.

</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<h4>2. The Family</h4>

<p>

While the March, 1995 Copenhagen Programme devoted an entire
section to &quot;the family,&quot; and the September, 1994 Cairo
Plan of Action included a chapter on &quot;the family,&quot; the
Beijing Platform for Action, the U.N.'s longest document discussing
women, almost completely ignores the subject. The only mention
of &quot;the family&quot; of any length in the Beijing Platform
of Action is in the same paragraph 30, mentioned above.

<p>

Before it begins discussing &quot;motherhood,&quot; that paragraph
says: &quot;The family is the basic unit of society and as such
should be strengthened.  It is entitled to receive comprehensive
protection and support.  In different cultural, political and
social systems, various forms of the family exist. The rights,
capabilities and responsibilities of family members must be respected....
The upbringing of children requires shared responsibility of parents,
women and men and society as a whole.&quot;

<p>

Paragraph 30 was one of the most hotly debated sections in the
document.  From the first preparatory committee meeting in Jakarta,
pro-life delegates struggled to guarantee language acknowledging
the importance of the family (in its traditional sense) both in
the lives of women and to society at large, as stated in the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights (1948).  Feminists, on the other hand,
insisted on using the phrase &quot;the family in all its forms&quot;
to allow for homosexual unions.  A compromise sentence -- &quot;In
different cultural, political and social systems, various forms
of the family exist&quot; -- was added in Beijing to take into
account the existence of single-parent families and extended families.
Even this compromise sentence, however, could be misinterpreted
to condone homosexual unions.  It could also leave the door open
for &quot;the whole village&quot; (or more precisely, the state)
to direct the upbringing of children.

<p>

&quot;Family&quot; is mentioned again (cursorily) in the Beijing
document (paragraph 93) as one responsibility among many in a
woman's life.  It is mentioned in paragraph 285, where the document
speaks of the family's role in promoting the equality of the 
&quot;girl-child&quot; and in paragraph 108c, where men are encouraged 
&quot;to share equally in childcare and household work and to provide 
financial support for their families even if they do not live with 
them.&quot; The few other mentions of &quot;family&quot; in the document
are very negative.  In paragraph 114a, for example, the family
is mentioned as the venue for battering, sexual abuse, marital
rape, female genital mutilation, and other acts of violence against
women.

<p>

<h4>3. Women's Health</h4>

<p>

The women's health section is the longest and one of the most
troubling.  It begins rhapsodically, with the statement, &quot;Women
have the right to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard
of physical and mental health... Health is a state of complete
physical, mental, and social well-being, and not merely the absence
of disease or infirmity&quot; (paragraph 91).  To this it adds
(repeating Cairo) in paragraph 96: &quot;Reproductive health is
a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being, and
not merely the absence of disease or infirmity, in all matters
relating to the reproductive system and to its functions and 
processes.&quot;

<p>

To the point of neglecting most health problems, the document
concentrates on sexual or reproductive health.  AIDS alone gets
roughly 20 paragraphs, whereas cardiac disease and cancer are
mentioned only once or twice.  The document almost completely
ignores the problem of tropical disease which decimates female
populations in the Third World.

<p>

<h4>4. Reproductive Rights</h4>

<p>

The Beijing Declaration (paragraph 17) asserts that &quot;[t]he
explicit recognition and reaffirmation of the right of all women
to control all aspects of their health, in particular their own
fertility, is basic to their empowerment.&quot;

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<center>
<font size=+1><b><i>
Lesbian 'rights' language<br>
was finally excluded as<br>
weary delegates looking<br>
for a few hours of sleep<br>
deleted all references<br>
to sexual orientation<br>
from the document.
</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

But the most stunning part of the Platform is its pronouncement
that women have a &quot;human right&quot; to control their own
sexuality and reproduction.  Paragraph 97 of the health section
declares that: &quot;The human rights of women include their right
to have control over and decide freely and responsibly on matters
related to their sexuality, including sexual and reproductive 
health.&quot;

<p>

Raising a woman's right to control her own sexuality and reproduction
to a &quot;human right&quot; is a considerable step beyond the
1993 Vienna Programme of Action's statement that &quot;reproductive
rights rest on the recognition of the basic right of all couples
and individuals to decide freely and responsibly the number, spacing
and timing of their children and to have the information and means
to do so.&quot;  It is also a considerable step beyond Cairo's
similar statement on the subject.

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<center>
<font size=+1><b><i>
The Beijing document<br>
contains some positive<br>
aspects: it denounces<br>
forced prostitution,<br>
pornography, genital<br>
mutilation, bride-burning,<br>
sexual slavery and forced<br>
sterilization. It condemns<br>
rape, expecially as a<br>
weapon of war.
</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

The 1994 Cairo document had asserted that &quot;reproductive
rights embrace certain human rights that are already recognized
in national laws, international human rights documents and other
relevant U.N. consensus documents.&quot;  Moreover, the Beijing
Plan of Action had originally labelled controlling one's own fertility
&quot;a sexual right,&quot; but not &quot;a human right.&quot;
A woman's &quot;human right&quot; to control her sexual and reproductive
health could be understood to mean that she has a &quot;human
right&quot; to promiscuity, homosexuality and to abortion.

<p>

When this language was adopted in committee on September 10,
the Holy See was very concerned by what it saw as the invention
of a new &quot;human right.&quot;  At the conference and, more
recently, in the <i>Wall Street Journal</i> (September 21, 1995),
the Holy See delegation chief Mary Ann Glendon, an American and
professor of law at Harvard University, protested the Conference's
tampering with the Universal Declaration. &quot;All this is 
evidence,&quot; she said, &quot;of the increasing colonization of the 
great Universal Human Rights tradition by an impoverished U.S.-style 
libertarian rights dialectic whose features are (1) rights envisioned without 
corresponding individual or social responsibilities; (2) one's favorite 
rights (i.e., speech, property, etc.) touted as absolute while other
rights are ignored; (3) the rights-bearer is imagined as radically
autonomous and self-sufficient; and (4) the creation of new rights
which are often in conflict with one another (e.g., the right
to smoke versus a clean environment).&quot;

<p>

<h4>5. Abortion</h4>

<p>

Besides the disturbing paragraph 97, the Beijing document makes
no new inroads in promoting the legality of abortion.  Repeating
Cairo, the document says (paragraph 107k), &quot;In no case should
abortion be promoted as a means of family planning.&quot;  But
due to the precedent set at the 1994 Cairo conference, the term
&quot;reproductive rights&quot; in U.N. documents must now always
be understood to imply abortion in those countries where abortion
has been legalized.  Indeed, paragraph 107k continues by saying,
&quot;In circumstances where abortion is not against the law,
such abortions should be safe.&quot;

<p>

Despite the protests of pro-life delegates at both Cairo and
Beijing that abortion is never &quot;safe&quot; for the baby in
question, the Beijing document repeatedly condemns &quot;unsafe
abortions&quot; (which it defines as &quot;a procedure for terminating
an unwanted pregnancy either by persons lacking necessary skills
or in an environment lacking minimum medical standards&quot;).
For example, paragraph 95 lists &quot;unsafe abortion&quot; among
the consequences of early sexual experience, and paragraph 98
says that &quot;[u]nsafe abortions threaten the lives of a number
of women, presenting a serious public health problem.&quot; 
Paragraph 107k asks governments &quot;to deal with the health impact
of unsafe abortions as a major public health concern and to reduce
the recourse to abortions by increasing and improving family planning
services.&quot;

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<center>
<font size=+1><b><i>
The document is a monument<br>
to the 'exaggerated<br>
individualism' which<br>
characterizes the radical<br>
feminist movement.
</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

During the negotiations in Beijing, the draft document's several
mentions of unborn life were either struck down or severely weakened.
In each instance where the document formerly mentioned &quot;female
foeticide&quot; (paragraphs 40 ,41, 115bis, etc.), the term was
replaced by &quot;prenatal sex selection.&quot;  But paragraph
276c which condemns son preference and unethical practices such
as prenatal sex selection and female infanticide, still adds,
&quot;This is often compounded by the increasing use of technologies
to determine fetal sex resulting in the abortion of female fetuses.&quot;

<p>

Also notable is paragraph 107k which calls on states to &quot;consider
reviewing laws containing punitive measures against women who
have undergone illegal abortions.&quot;  This paragraph also states,
&quot;Prevention of unwanted pregnancies must always be given
the highest priority, and every attempt should be made to eliminate
the need for abortion.  Any measures or changes related to abortion
within the health system can only be determined at the national
or local level according to the national legislative process.&quot;
(Given the restrictions on pro-life legislation in this country,
one has to wonder whether the U.S. is in compliance with this
language.)

<p>

Paragraph 107k also states, &quot;In all cases, women should
have access to quality services for the management of complications 
arising from abortion.  Post-abortion counseling, education and 
family-planning services should be offered promptly, which will also 
help to avoid repeat abortions.&quot;

<p>

<h4>6. Parents' Responsibility for Children</h4>

<p>

Despite the fact that Article 26 of the United Nations' Universal
Declaration of Human Rights states, &quot;Parents have a prior
right to choose the kind of education that shall be given to their
children,&quot; the Beijing document hardly acknowledges parental
authority over children.  Indeed, at least 17 references to parental
responsibility for children were deleted from the draft document.

<p>

For example, there is no longer any reference to parents' rights
in paragraph 107m, which asks governments to &quot;[e]nsure that
girls have continuing access to necessary health and nutrition
information and services, as they mature, to facilitate a healthy
transition from childhood to adulthood.&quot;

<p>

Parental rights language was also removed from paragraph 109(1),
which approves condom use for male adolescents.  (Moreover, despite
strong objections voiced by Catholic and Muslim delegates, a paragraph
asking governments to &quot;encourage abstinence as responsible
behavior until marriage&quot; was swiftly discarded at the Beijing
conference, at the urging of the Canadian delegation.)

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<center>
<font size=+1><b><i>
Despite the fact that 70<br>
percent of the world's<br>
women are wives and mothers,<br>
the Beijing document barely<br>
considers them in this capacity.
</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

The only vestige of parental responsibility which remains in
the document relates to the &quot;direction and guidance&quot;
of children.  But this weak language still disregards parents,
leaving most decision-making responsibilities to the child, including
(possibly) the decision of abortion.

<p>

In the end, the key paragraph relating to parents' rights and
children's rights turned out to be paragraph 267.  This  paragraph
reads:

<p><blockquote>

<i>

&quot;The International Conference on Population and Development
recognized, in paragraph 7.3 of the Programme of Action, that
'full attention should be given to the promotion of mutually respectful
and equitable gender relations and particularly to meeting the
educational and service needs of adolescents to enable them to
deal in a positive and responsible way with their sexuality,'
taking into account the rights of the child to access to information,
privacy, confidentiality, respect and informed consent, as well
as the responsibilities, rights and duties of parents and legal
guardians to provide, in a manner consistent with the evolving
capacities of the child, appropriate direction and guidance in
the exercise by the child of the rights recognized in the Convention
on the Rights of the Child, and in conformity with the Convention
on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women.
In all actions concerning children, the best interests of the
child shall be a primary consideration.  Support should be given
to integral sexual education for young people with parental support
and guidance that stress the responsibility of males for their
own sexuality and fertility and that help them exercise their
responsibilities.&quot;

</i>

</blockquote><p>

Paragraph 108e  (about public health campaigns) takes the same
position, asking governments to:

<p><blockquote>

<i>

&quot;Prepare and disseminate accessible information...to ensure
that men and women, especially young people, can acquire knowledge about 
their health and especially information about sexuality and reproduction, 
taking into account the rights of the child to access to information,
privacy, confidentiality, respect and informed consent, as well
as the responsibilities, rights and duties of parents and legal
guardians to provide, in a manner consistent with the evolving
capacities of the child, appropriate direction and guidance in
the exercise by the child of the rights recognized in the Convention
on the Rights of the Child, and in conformity with the Convention
on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women.
In all actions concerning children, the best interests of the
child shall be a primary concern.&quot;

</i>

</blockquote><p>

<p>

<h4>7. Religion</h4>

<p>

There is only one paragraph in the Platform for Action dedicated
to the role of religion in women's lives. This paragraph (25bis),
which in its original form cast religion as oppressive to women
(i.e., associating it with extremism and violence), was reworked
to acknowledge that freedom of conscience and religion are recognized
by the Universal Declaration.

<p>

Paragraph 25bis now reads:

<p><blockquote>

<i>

&quot;Religion, spirituality and belief play a central role in the 
lives of millions of women and men -- in the way they live, in the 
aspirations that they have for the future. The right to freedom of 
thought, conscience and religion is unalienable
and must be universally enjoyed.  This right includes the freedom
to have or to adopt the religion or belief of their choice, either
individually or in community with others, in public or in private,
and to manifest their religion or belief in worship, observance,
practice and teaching, in order to realize equality, development
and peace there is a need to fully respect these rights and freedoms.
Religion, thought, conscience and belief may, and can, contribute
to fulfilling women's and men's moral, ethical and spiritual needs,
and to realizing their full potential in society.  However, it
is acknowledged that any form of extremism may have a negative
impact on women and can lead to violence and discrimination.&quot;

The most stunning part<br>
of the Platform is its<br>
pronouncement that women<br>
have a 'human right' to<br>
control their own reproduction.
</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

Within the Beijing Declaration, paragraph 12 includes &quot;the
right to freedom of thought, conscience, religion and belief,
thus contributing to the moral, ethical, spiritual and intellectual
needs of women and men&quot; among rights to be protected.  And
on occasion, the document also appends a phrase such as &quot;consistent
with religious and cultural values&quot; (paragraphs 74, 82f)
to qualify injunctions to action.
<p>

<center><h3>Concluding the Conference</h3></center>

<p>

The Platform for Action was hotly argued for twelve days, sometimes
long into the night.  Negotiations about sexual and reproductive
rights as human rights went on sporadically for three days. Canada's 
Ruth Archibald led the five-day drive to remove the document's 17 
references to parental rights.

<p>

But by far the most important and moving proceeding for pro-family
advocates came during the four-hour marathon following the formal
adoption of the Platform on September 15th in which 42 U.N. member
states registered reservations to the Platform.  (These 42 comprised
a full fifth of the organization's membership, not what critics
had at one time called &quot;a handful of Latin American and Moslem
states.&quot;)

<p>

These reservations were especially important because they countered
the claims made by members of the U.S. delegation -- Tim Wirth,
Geraldine Ferraro, Donna Shalala, and health negotiators Nils
Daulaire and Dottie Lamm -- who, throughout the conference, kept
insisting that things were going smoothly.  The reservations also
served to refute the networks, the <I>New York Times</I> and Ford
Foundation representative Frances Kissling (Catholics for a Free
Choice), who, in a consistent stream of disinformation, claimed
that the Vatican was caving in on contraceptives and condoms.

<p>

Announcing its reservations at the conference, the Holy See opted
out of the health section in its entirety, on the grounds that
it concentrated on sexual and reproductive health to the point
of almost failing to address other women's health needs, including
maternal mortality and morbidity. It objected to ambiguous terms
concerning unqualified control over sexuality and fertility which
might be interpreted as an endorsement of abortion and homosexuality.
With regard to the whole human rights section, the Holy See associated
itself with very little besides the quotations from existing human 
rights documents.  It asked that its definition of the word 
&quot;gender&quot;(biological sexual identity: male or female) be affixed 
to the document when it was printed.

<p>

Islamic states clarified that, for them, sexual rights apply
only within marriage, and that they had not agreed to anything
condoning abortion.  Several stressed that the Platform for Action
would be interpreted in their countries according to Sharia (Islamic)
law, especially in regard to inheritance for girls.  The Philippines
objected to treating reproductive rights as human rights.

Malaysia said it would interpret &quot;family&quot; in the document
as the traditional family, and Ecuador said that the family is
the fundamental unit of society.  When the delegate from Niger
prepared to enter her reservation, she said publicly what many
developing country delegates had said earlier in private, &quot;We
hope that joining in the consensus will not be a pre-condition
for [donors'] financing of health programs.&quot;

<p>

In its final statement to the conference, the U.S. stressed its
commitment to the cause of women's empowerment and declared that
the Beijing Platform for Action would serve as a detailed map
for achieving women's equality, development and peace.  However,
neither the United States nor any of the other donor countries who so 
strongly backed the document have promised any new money for women's 
programs. They insisted that no new resources could be provided, turning
down the African and Latin American delegates who contended that
new and additional resources were needed to provide basic health
care to women, which was, for them, the overriding concern of
the conference.

<p>

<center><h3>Beijing's Implications</h3></center>

<p>

There is no doubt that the Beijing document will have consequences
for the family.  A year after Cairo, the first global survey made
by the U.N. examining its membership's progress to fulfill the
promises made in that conference's Plan of Action showed that
out of 53 nations surveyed, 46 have undertaken new policies to
implement the Cairo document.  The other seven nations were recorded
either as having lost ground in implementing the document or stayed
the same.  The U.N. Population Fund has also recently announced
that it increased its budget almost 21 percent in 1994 and another
17.6 percent in 1995, to a total of $312 million.  And plans are
already being considered for another U.N. women's meeting in 2000
and for a declaration of &quot;The Century of Women.&quot;

<p>

While the Beijing conference yielded few high points, one positive
result is that it drew together pro-family, conservative women
who for so long had resisted dealing with the U.N. due to their
general distaste for the organization.  In 1994, there were perhaps
two openly pro-life organizations among the NGOs at the U.N.,
but as recently as last April's PrepCom, there were 50.  The conference
in Beijing -- a long and very expensive journey from the US without
government or U.N. assistance -- drew over 200 women from close
to 150 conservative NGO organizations from 20 countries, including
Protestants, Catholics, Muslims and others.

<p>

Despite their late entrance and the fact that the feminists had
written most of the document, pro-family women became an important
part of the proceedings and undid a good deal of the damage that
preceded their arrival.  They supported pro-family delegates,
long-used to jeering and mockery.  They made the case for family
values on talk radio shows at home, telephoning from Beijing.
They even assisted delegates confused by inadequate U.N. translations,
patiently explaining code words like &quot;orientation&quot; and
&quot;gender&quot; to Third World delegates.  (Many Africans thought
that &quot;reproductive rights&quot; meant the right to have a
family.)

<p>

Most of all, these pro-family women were able to challenge U.S.
delegates on their partisanship, their lack of responsiveness
to the public, and their dearth of fidelity to traditional human
rights.  When the U.S. unfurled a banner demonstrating how closely
its commitments matched those of WEDO (a radical feminist NGO
led by Bella Abzug), conservative women raised another banner
made from a hotel bedsheet, pointing out where the U.S. had covered
its ears to conservative women.  So uncomfortable did the U.S.
delegation finally become with these new lobbyists that they called
in U.N. security guards to confiscate the conservatives' passes.

<title>THE GREATEST OF THESE IS LOVE</title>

<h1>The Greatest of These is Love</h1>
<h2><i>A Faith-Based Alternative to the Welfare State</i></h2>

</center>

<p>

<font size=+3>I</font>n an 1844 essay entitled &quot;True and False 
Philanthropy,&quot; American preacher William H. McGuffey unwittingly 
diagnosed the ills of the modern welfare state.  McGuffey draws a 
contrast between a &quot;Mr. Fantom&quot; and a &quot;Mr. Goodman.&quot; 
Mr. Fantom begins: &quot;I despise a narrow field.  O for the reign of 
universal benevolence!  I want to make all mankind good and happy.&quot;
Mr. Goodman responds that &quot;one must begin to love somewhere;
and I think it is natural to love one's own family, and to do
good in one's own neighborhood, as to anybody else.&quot;  Mr.
Goodman laments of Mr. Fantom, &quot;And so, between the great
thing he cannot do, and the little one that he will not do, life
passes, and nothing will be done.&quot;

<p>

Today, the onset of moral relativism has driven a wedge between
those reformers who hope to promote moral uplift and those who
aim only to relieve material needs.  But in 1844, Mr. Fantom and
Mr. Goodman did at least agree that the object of benevolence
was &quot;goodness&quot; and &quot;happiness&quot; -- or, in more
sophisticated parlance, virtue and individual fulfillment.  Mr.
Fantom and Mr. Goodman parted ways in defining the means to achieve
those ends, and their differences frame the central questions
confronting contemporary reformers.

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

First, should the locus of our action be the individual or
the collectivity?  And are we intent upon &quot;making all mankind
good&quot; by coercion, as Mr. Fantom aspired, or in &quot;doing
good&quot; in the context of freedom, along with Mr. Goodman?

<p>

Simply limiting the size of the welfare state will not yield
a sparkling rebirth in the nation's naked cities.  Limiting government
will be necessary, but not sufficient, to repair cultural rot.
The insufficiency of libertarian means, however, does not imply
the existence of some proactive political means that will be adequate
to the task.  Restoring our society will require embracing a vision
of moral autonomy and inherent dignity for every individual.

<p>

<center><h3>Individual or Collectivity?</h3></center>

<p>

Nature has revealed two fundamental truths about man.  He
is perpetually weak and flawed, but also rife with potential for
love and renewal.  Personal failing, in fact, often contains the
seeds of renewal because it discredits an exalted sense of the
self.  By reflecting on the dynamics of human weakness, reason
itself can apprehend a higher law rooted in God, to whom man must
hold himself accountable.

<p>

Conservative theorist Frank Meyer argues that the cornerstone
of civic morality in the West is the Great Commandment &quot;to
love the Lord thy God with all thy heart . . . and thy neighbor
as thyself.&quot;  In reflecting on this mandate, Meyer introduces
a paradox.  By ignoring utterly everything but God and individual
persons, the world's most famous invocation to selflessness has
established the individual squarely at the center of the Western
tradition.  The individual must be &quot;the central moral entity,
and society as but a set of relations between persons -- not as
an organism morally superior to persons,&quot;[1] Meyer writes, because
&quot;no community, no state, no association -- only persons,
individual human beings -- can receive the beatific vision or
be redeemed by the divine sacrifice of love.&quot;[2] The words
are radical in implication.  They ask those who believe in the
divine sacrifice of love to acknowledge that healing the culture
will depend on the interaction of individuals, not the clash of
abstract political entities.

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<center>
<font size=+1><b><i>
Should the locus of our action<br>

all mankind good' by coercion,<br>
or in 'doing good' in the context<br>

</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

The concept of &quot;interaction,&quot; of course, is a necessary
corollary to the emphasis on the individual.  Meyer's vision of
social harmony, after all, rests on a vision of the individual
redeemed, and man is redeemed only by acquiring a sense of something
larger than himself.  Through a rich and vast array of daily interactions
with each other, individuals mature into complete human beings
with a sense of self-control, but also a sense of connectedness
and mutual obligation.  The state's role in fostering man's nobler
impulses depends ultimately on nurturing, not individuals directly,
but all the small groupings into which human beings organize themselves
-- outside of and distinct from government.

<p>

The moral superiority of individuals meeting each other face
to face, in the space we call &quot;civil society,&quot; emerges
with particular force in the story of a woman named Clara Hale.
A poor woman in her mid-sixties, living in a poor neighborhood,
Clara Hale took in a baby born with a drug addiction and went
on to found Hale House, a group home for addicted children in
Harlem.  &quot;It was Clara Hale who did this,&quot; Michael Joyce
writes, &quot;not an expert, not a bureaucracy.  Had she exercised
her citizenship in the modern, tragically devalued sense of that
term, Clara Hale would merely have advocated through voting and
political activism, more programs for state-funded professionals
to care for these children of God.&quot;  But she did not turn
away from them and speak to society, in the abstract.  She held
each child, one by one, and spoke their names to them.  &quot;Clara
Hale's sense of citizenship, her active and direct participation
in service to her fellow man, displays the vibrancy and proves
the superiority of civil society,&quot;[3] Joyce concludes.

</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

The proliferation of need is a cry for a new generation of
Clara Hale's, with an acutely personal sense of moral responsibility.

<p>

<center><h3>Freedom or coercion?</h3></center>

<p>

If the moral development of the individual is the central
concern, then liberty and virtue must be the twin ordering principles
of political and social life.  The pursuit of virtue is the highest
moral good, but it cannot be a political question.  Virtue depends
on individual freedom of choice and can be neither exercised by
collectivities nor achieved by political coercion.  F. A. Hayek
once wrote:

<p><blockquote>

<i>

Freedom is the matrix required for the growth of moral values
-- indeed not merely one value among many but the source of all
values.  It is only where the individual has choice, and its inherent
responsibility, that he has occasion to affirm existing values,
to contribute to their further growth, and to earn moral merit.[4]

</i>

</blockquote><p>

The only political means to promote virtue, then, is to establish
and maintain freedom for the individual.

<p>

If virtue depends on the preservation of liberty, however,
it is also true that the maintenance of liberty depends on the
status of virtue.  The meaning of freedom encompasses much more
than the absence of coercion or an abundance of options.  Because
a democratic society requires citizens to be capable of governing
themselves, freedom cannot be an end in itself.  As Lord Acton
put it, &quot;Liberty is not the freedom to do what you wish;
it is the freedom to do what you ought.&quot;  Libertarian means,
in short, must serve traditionalist ends, while traditionalism
must resist the temptation to use coercion to promote its own
ends.

<p>

The only satisfactory balance between virtue and freedom
is a vibrant civil society, that sphere of life that includes
all the institutions and interactions that stand between the individual
and the total state.  While the elemental building blocks are
the family and the church, civil society also encompasses the
Boy Scout troop that builds hiking trails for the community, the
school that teaches young ones how to read, and the homeless shelter
that keeps its doors open thanks to dedicated volunteers.  Civil
society may be as formal as the Red Cross chapter that has secured
its 501 (c)(3) tax status or as informal as an afternoon gathering
of young mothers at a neighborhood park.  It is both Hale House
and your house.  Sharing stories around the dinner table, holding
hands with a new widow, or looking men directly in the eye at
the local soup kitchen -- this is the stuff that softens hearts
and melts social barriers.  By maximizing opportunities for service
to one another, civil society promotes the strength of character
that safeguards against freedom's atomistic tendencies.

<p>

The freedom that allows civil society to thrive is, in fact,
much more likely to engender strong communities than the isolated
individuals of liberal myth-making, for human nature predisposes
man to live life in communal settings.  Alexis de Tocqueville
wrote in <i>Democracy in America</i>:

<p><blockquote>

<i>

The township is . . . so well rooted in nature that wherever men
assemble it forms itself.  Communal society therefore exists among
all peoples, whatever be their customs and laws.  Man creates
kingdoms and republics, but townships seem to spring directly
from the hand of God.[5]

</i>

</blockquote><p>

The prospects for civil society do depend critically, however,
on the preservation of the nuclear family as the basic unit of
society.

<p>

<center><h3>A Revival of Family</h3></center>

<p>

While his name is almost synonymous with self-interest, Adam
Smith also observed a near-universal human attribute of sympathy
that he identified as the source of human moral sentiments.  Although
distinct from altruism, Smith's notion of &quot;sympathy&quot;
inspired man to seek the approval of his fellow citizens by functioning
in ways that sustained healthy communities.  Endorsing Smith's
hypothesis, John Adams wrote in 1790 that &quot;as Nature intended
men for society, she has endowed them with passions, appetites
and propensities calculated . . . to render them useful to each
other in their social connections&quot;[6] -- if only to win the
love and esteem that gratify the self.

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<center>
<font size=+1><b><i>

between virtue and freedom is<br>

state.
</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

Along with the right of man to be free and independent, the
Founders asserted a strong belief that man was most magnanimous
when functioning as a free individual.  Jefferson for his part
argued that men have an instinctive moral sense that compels them
to respond with assistance when their neighbors are in distress.[7]
In examining the scientific evidence to test Jefferson's contention,
James Q. Wilson found ample evidence that individuals do have
a &quot;moral sense&quot; and that it is formed out of their earliest
interactions in the family.  Scholarly studies of altruism, for
example, demonstrate that &quot;the general pattern of warm familial
relationships is striking.&quot;  In a study of Christians who
rescued Jews during the Holocaust, the long-term rescuers were
very close to their parents, one or both of whom held strong moral
convictions.  And the same pattern reappears in a study of people
who were active for long periods in the civil rights movement
during the 1960s.  Compared to those who were only briefly involved,
the fully committed activists had a warm and close relationship
with one or both parents.[8]

<p>

By fostering human relationships of a type that are not always
found in the wider society, the family fulfills an indispensable
social function.  As the Pope wrote in <I>Familiaris Consortio</I>:

<p><blockquote>

<i>

The relationships between members of the family community are
inspired and guided by the law of &quot;free giving.&quot;  By
respecting and fostering personal dignity in each and every one
as the only basis for value, this free giving takes the form of
heartfelt acceptance, encounter and dialogue, disinterested availability,
generous service and deep solidarity.[9]

</i>

</blockquote>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<font size=+1><b><i>

</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

In reviewing a wide variety of studies in developmental psychology,
Wilson found that generous children were indeed raised by parents
who offered nurturing love and consistent discipline and who themselves
engaged in helping others.  Rather than caring intensely only
for members of the immediate family, children and adults who experienced
love at home were precisely the people who were most likely to
aid perfect strangers, often at risk to themselves.[10]

<p>

The empirical evidence, then, provides a powerful rebuttal
to the conception of the moral agent as an abstract force, stripped
of the intimacy and particularity of the family ties that undergird
moral experience in everyday life.  Michael Novak argues that
moral realism itself is the one habit learned in the family that
is most essential for successful self-government:

<p><blockquote>

<i>

[F]amily life is no utopia.  It isn't meant to be.  Its purpose
is to instruct us in the painful but also mind-enlarging angularities
of human nature.  Such realism, vital to any free republic, arises
from having your own self-images punctured, from learning to endure
tragedies together, from penetrating one another's weaknesses,
and from learning to forgive, to love, to be tolerant, and to
support.  Without such learning how could any civil society survive?[11]

</i>

</blockquote><p>

In order to have meaningful content, love for humanity, for the
stranger on the street corner, must evolve from the privilege
of basic human affections -- the experience of one heart knowing
another.

<p>

While grounded in moral realism, acts of personal kindness
elevate and ennoble the doer from within; and in learning the
unique worth of love, theologian Walter Rauschenbusch observed,
we learn to feel the worth of those we ought to love.[12] Thus, love
undergirds both moral autonomy and a sense of the dignity that
belongs to every individual.  Political coercion, by contrast,
is a flimsy tool for social cohesion.  &quot;The frequency with
which our communities have to fall back on . . . coercion is a
symptom of the failure of love, for love can usually dispense
with force.  The more love, the less force; the more force, the
less love,&quot;[13] Rauschenbusch wrote.

<p>

To the extent that centralized government usurps the space
in which families and neighbors thrive -- and thereby politicizes
all relationships -- it trumpets reductionist individualism and
denies the power of love.  Collectivism makes its mistake in assuming
that virtues like selflessness and generosity are a part of human
nature.  Asserting that man has a moral sense (or a variation
on self-interest that mimics a moral sense) is not to say that
man is inherently virtuous or altruistic.  If men were angels,
the loss of family would exact no price.

<p>

<center><h3>A Revival of Community</h3></center>

<p>

It is also true, however, that strong families require strong
communities.  Charles Murray explains that &quot;[a]ffiliation
is a means whereby people of common values are enabled to enact
those values.&quot;[14] A functioning community that promotes a wide
array of affiliations provides an extremely important venue both
for practicing virtue and for passing down to the next generation
the habit of virtue.  The passing of values from parent to child,
in fact, presupposes outlets for practice because it involves
-- as Murray puts it -- a &quot;reality test.&quot;

<p><blockquote>

<i>

How does one bequeath a habit of helping others, of giving, of
generosity, if this has not been a part of one's own life? . . . 
Watching parents support compassionate politicians just isn't
the same. . . .  If parents are engaged in directly paying other
people in the community -- supporting local institutions -- they
at least must do such things as choose whom they will pay and
how much.  And even these actions provide a richer basis for instruction
than signing a 1040 Form and then trying to explain compassion
to the child in the abstract.[15]

</i>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

Wilson's empirical findings concur: generous children are
in fact the sons and daughters of generous parents.  He also discovers,
however, that human sympathy is fragile.  Behavior depends, not
only on the development of right instinct, but on the extent to
which the circumstances create a sense of personal responsibility.
Adam Smith devised a famous thought experiment to demonstrate
the point:  If a man were to learn of the destruction of 100 million
Chinese, he might lament their passing, but in a moment would
return placidly to his business or leisure.  But we would recoil
at the thought of a man who in order to save the loss of his little
finger would will the death of the very same number of distant
Chinese. &quot;If our sentiments were directed simply by our
love of humanity,&quot; Wilson observes, &quot;we might feel equal
anguish at both tragedies, but we do not.&quot;[16] Adam Smith provides
the explanation:

<p><blockquote>

<i>

When the happiness or misery of others depends in any respect
upon our conduct, we dare not, as self-love might suggest to us,
prefer the interest of one to that of many.  The man within 
immediately calls.[17]

</i>

</blockquote><p>

Conversely, when the happiness or misery of others bears no relation
to our conduct, the man within remains silent.

<p>

Given the evidence that there is a &quot;man within,&quot;
the more appropriate question is -- not whether human beings are
capable of strong community -- but why do we not see more evidence
of community already in play.[18] The answer reflects Adam Smith's
insight about human nature, for civil institutions by definition
are groupings of flesh-and-blood men.  To the extent that the
welfare state has eliminated the necessity of a father who provides,
it has reduced the sense of personal responsibility that kept
him at home through good times and bad.  To the extent that Washington
hires social workers to do the job instead, Sioux City will almost
certainly experience a decline in the numbers of men and women
who feel compelled to volunteer their time at the end of a long
day.  In the words of Nathan Glazer, the reason social policy
weakens civil institutions is

<p><blockquote>

<i>

the simple reality that every piece of social policy substitutes
for some traditional arrangement, whether good or bad, a new arrangement
in which public authorities take over, at least in part, the role
of the family, of the ethnic and neighborhood group, of the voluntary
associations.[19]

</i>

</blockquote><p>

In Marvin Olasky's turn of phrase, bad charity drives out good.

<center><h3>A Revival of Faith</h3></center>

<p>

When families no longer have the benefit of strong communities
-- and many children no longer even have the benefit of family
-- reviving civil society is admittedly more complex than merely
relimiting the size of the welfare state.  Pulling out the knife,
as Professor DiIulio says, is unlikely to resuscitate the dying
man.[20] But neither will a fresh stab wound do the trick.  Civil
society must derive its strength from non-political sources, and
in all probability those sources must spring from a revival of
religious faith.  Relimiting government is essential precisely
because government can stultify, but never revivify, religion.

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

When public order is lost and the center does not hold, fidelity
to truth demands at least weighing the evidence that faith-based
drug addiction programs save more lives than their secular counterparts.[21]
Short of rigorous empirical calculations, fidelity to the truth
demands engaging in a simple thought experiment:  &quot;If you
are walking down the street in urban America and see four formidable-looking
young males approaching, would you relax a little if you knew
they had just emerged from a Bible study?&quot;  Probably, yes.
The federal government's own surveys of the professional literature
confirm that attachment to church is inversely related to violence.[22]
Given the scale of the current crisis and the clarity of the
evidence in defense of faith, many secular authorities are willing
to give religion its due.  The danger is not simply that government
will soften its bias against faith-based programs too late, but
that government dollars will disarm the very emphasis on faith
that made those programs a success in the first place.

<p>

Government contracting with community-based institutions,
including religious institutions, will almost certainly result
in a more efficient and effective delivery of services.  The issue
at hand, however, is neither efficiency nor material quality.
The issue is transforming lives ravaged, not by a lack of material
resources, but by a lack of the spiritual and moral fiber necessary
to sustain independence.  In a comprehensive study of religious
charities, Amy Sherman concludes:

<p><blockquote>

<i>

The most effective groups challenge those who embrace faith to
live out its moral implications in every significant area of their
lives, from breaking drug addictions and repairing family relationships
to recommitting themselves to the value of honest work.  But state
social-service contracts aren't necessarily concerned with such
outcomes; they focus on meals served, beds available, and checks
cashed.[23]

</i>

</blockquote><p>

Faith-based programs, like men, cannot serve both God and mammon
too.

<p>

Even programs that retain their original vision are likely
to face burdensome regulations that dilute the emphasis on faith.
In explaining why faith-based programs succeed when state-licensed
versions fail, Ed MacClellan, executive director of the Florida
Association of Christian Child Caring Agencies (FACCCA) summarizes
his experience in plain, unvarnished English:  &quot;'In the licensed
homes you'll find Jesus, but you'll have to look for him.  He's
put away in the chapel or in a closet. . . .   Go to one of our
homes, and Jesus is gonna open the front door. That's the 
difference.'&quot;[24] Regardless of right or wrong, the fact is that 
Jesus is unlikely to be opening the door at a public housing project any 
time soon. Faith-minded policymakers must accept that limitation for the
present, and plan accordingly.

<p>

While the loss of a programmatic emphasis on religion is
the most obvious compromise, government funding also changes the
quality of personal relationships in subtle ways that can undercut
any remaining vestiges of faith.  Government paperwork diverts
time from the face-to-face ministry that is the single most important
corrective to the bureaucratic model -- and the most likely avenue
to spiritual renewal.  Quite often the very thing needed, says
Virgil Gulker, founder of Kids/Hope/USA, is simply &quot;a person
who cares, befriending another person who is lonely.&quot;[25] Star
Parker, former welfare recipient, says from personal experience
that the question posed to welfare recipients must be: &quot;God
or government?&quot;[26] But government money damages the credibility
of the personal example individual volunteers can set for the
beneficiaries of their programs.  Reverend Eddie Edwards, who
oversees a community-development organization in east Detroit
called Joy of Jesus, explains: &quot;When we are working with
people in the community, helping them become self-sufficient,
helping them get off welfare, it would be extremely difficult
to tell them to get off welfare if we were on some kind of public
assistance.&quot;[27] Indeed, the most powerful witness men and women
of faith can offer is that dependence on God obviates the need
for dependence on the state.

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

As long as state funding remains a part of the landscape,
the church may do good works, but it will fail to realize its
full potential as the vital center of community life.  The heart
of Charles Murray's argument about the prospects for a rebirth
of civil society must be applied with particular urgency to the
institution that is charged with remoralizing civil society.
&quot;The church will be a satisfying institution of community
life (not just religious life) to the extent that the members
have something important to do&quot; -- that will not otherwise
be done.  But &quot;that institutional role will atrophy to the
extent that it does not.&quot;[28] Just as it will be impossible
to secure the benefits of community on the cheap, it will prove
impossible to restore the influence of faith in America without
churchgoers paying a rather steep price to vindicate that faith
in their own lives, day by day.

<p>

Lest the burden seem too overwhelming, Virgil Gulker places
the problem in perspective:  &quot;Somehow the statistics cover
up the fact that behind every number is a name and a face -- a
real person with a real need.  Categories and percentages seem
beyond our grasp, but individuals can be helped.&quot;[29] Faith
believes that the power of just one changed life is in fact more
powerful than an activist state.

<p>

Ultimately, collectivism itself is at war with faith; for,
it is a vision not of individuals finding love and renewal in
the presence of God, but of godlike individuals contriving the
salvation of the masses.  To vindicate the exaltation of an elite
-- often in the face of demonstrated failures to deliver the promised
goods -- collectivism insists upon an abstraction called &quot;society&quot;
to which all moral problems finally refer.  By absolving individuals
of personal responsibility, collectivism enervates the faith that
springs from man's reckoning with his own inadequacy.  But it
also leaves real, flesh-and-blood individuals hurting, by decreasing
the likelihood that men will stir themselves to serve each other
at the deepest point of need.  As Mr. Goodman lamented of Mr.
Fantom, &quot;Between the great thing [man] cannot do, and the
little one that he will not do, life passes, and nothing will
be done.&quot;

<center><h3>What Can Be Done?</h3></center>

<p>

In short, a myriad of the &quot;little things&quot; that
together will equal more than the sum of the parts.  In 1976,
Dr. Virgil Gulker founded an organization called Love, Inc. that
seeks to bridge the gap between needy individuals and suburban
church members.  Someone once observed that Love, Inc. is distinctive
because it has no heroes.  Its sole purpose is to mobilize ordinary
individuals to serve the poor, by making the needs both specific
and manageable and by providing the appropriate training for volunteers.
Today, some 4,000 churches nationwide are involved in Love, Inc.,
while other individuals like Reverend Ronald Moore in Jackson,
Mississippi are developing their own training curriculum to help
mobilize a critical mass of churches.

<p>

Dr. Gulker, for his part, has launched a new venture called
Kids/Hope/USA that links adult volunteers in one-to-one relationships
with at-risk children.  Echoing Wilson's empirical findings, Dr.
Gulker speaks from experience: &quot;[When] suffering people remain
nameless and faceless, a mass 'out there' who do not activate
our sense of personal responsibility, . . . [w]hen we lack direct
contact with people's pain, their needs become merely one item
on our agenda -- and not necessarily an important item. . . .
Thus ministry shaped by distance . . . is fatal to those in need.&quot;[30]
Ministry to individuals one by one, on the other hand, is life-giving.
Americans have grown too accustomed to sweeping government action,
aimed at amorphous collective masses.  We must learn to see social
problems as individual responsibilities, but first we must affix
names and faces to the need.

<p>

Secondly, we must find ways to divert economic resources
from failed government programs to successful private-sector initiatives.
But a word of caution at the outset.

<p>

Welfare state advocates often defend bureaucratic programs
by arguing that the private sector cannot possibly replicate existing
levels of government spending.  &quot;Based on the current welfare
model,&quot; Father Robert Sirico replies, &quot;they are right.
All levels of government spend $950 billion a year on welfare
programs.  Charities, excluding churches, spend less than half
this sum (about $360 billion).  Private efforts clearly cannot
assume the functions of the present welfare state.  But why should
they?  An annual welfare budget of $300 billion is roughly three
times the amount of money it would take to raise the incomes of
all poor people above the poverty line.&quot;[31]

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

The welfare delivery system, like any other bureaucracy-laden
government monopoly, is woefully inefficient.  One study found
that less than 35 cents out of every welfare dollar was paid in
cash directly to the needy.[32] And every year, welfare consumes
more tax dollars without any incentives to cut costs or monitor
results.  In the words of Indianapolis Mayor Steve Goldsmith,
&quot;The federal government offers the best deal in town:  The
more you spend, the more you get. Don't worry about results.&quot;[33]
The national average spending for government-subsidized homeless
shelters is $22 per person per day.  By contrast, Sister Connie
Driscoll operates St. Martin de Porres House of Hope, a homeless
shelter in Chicago, at an average cost of $6.73 per person per
day.  Sister Connie receives no government funding.  But she does
get results.  The House of Hope has the most impressive success
rate in Chicago.  Only 6 percent of its residents find themselves
on the street again.

<p>

The key to success, of course, is that Sister Connie sets
behavioral standards for the receipt of assistance.  The changes
in behavior pose savings over and above the dollars saved by a
more efficient delivery of goods and services.  In a monograph
entitled &quot;The Market Foundations of Philanthropy,&quot; Richard
McKenzie explains:

<p><blockquote>

<i>

The donors' demands for reforms on the part of recipients carry
weight for a simple reason:  the recipients understand that the
private aid can be withdrawn (without an act of Congress), which
means that private aid is much more likely to be performance-based
and cost-effective.[34]

</i>

</blockquote><p>

Just as government bureaucrats treat the agency budget as
a proxy goal to be maximized, recipients of open-ended checks
face their own perverse incentives to perpetuate the very behavior
that drains the tax dollars of millions of hard-working Americans
year after year.  The tax burden in turn undermines the economic
expansiveness that could create jobs -- and fund additional philanthropic
giving.[35]

<p>

Just as the private sector need not replace the welfare state
dollar for dollar, efforts to build private sector capacity do
not depend on an increase in charitable giving by every American.
Only a reasonable percentage of the population must participate.
And voluntary giving is certainly an attractive alternative to
taxation.  Far from serving as an efficient way to raise money
for public purposes, taxation hurts the economy by creating a
disincentive effect for production as well as a new layer of compliance
costs.  Both costs disappear under a voluntary system.  Until
the twentieth-century love affair with government, James Payne
notes in <I>The Public Interest</I>, logic dictated that voluntarism
was the &quot;principal way money was raised for social purposes.&quot;[36]

<p>

Despite the growing bite of government taxation, recent levels
of charitable giving remain impressive.  If the value of volunteer
labor is included, the current value of private charity exceeds
all government welfare spending combined.[37] Payne concludes:

<p><blockquote>

<i>

[Academic preoccupation with the free-rider problem] overlooks
the complexity of human behavior.  Human beings can be generous
as well as selfish, and this generosity makes possible the hundreds
of thousands of voluntary giving arrangements that we see all
across the country. . . . The moral power of this kind of voluntary
transaction can never be achieved with a tax system based on force.
. . .  It is worth speculating how such giving might thrive in
a society that decided to emphasize it, in a society where children
were taught, from their earliest days, that voluntary giving is
needed to sustain civilization.[38]

</i>

</blockquote><p>

Charitable activity does appear to correlate closely with
a coherent system of beliefs.  <I>The American Enterprise</I>
reports that government-shrinking conservatives are more than
twice as likely to volunteer time and likely to give more than
twice as big a percentage of their annual incomes to charity.
The most generous subgroup within the population is religious
conservatives.[39]

</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

Research shows, moreover, that giving patterns among individual
Americans have changed along with changes in the role of government.
From the early 1940s through 1964, as the U.S. grew wealthier,
an increasing portion of wealth was given to charities.  In the
mid-1960s, however, the trend was reversed -- despite the fact
that total wealth continued to increase.  A rise in charitable
giving did not reappear until 1981 (during a period of hard times,
incidentally) when the Reagan Administration proposed cuts in
social welfare spending and urged a return to voluntarism.[40] Richard
McKenzie has demonstrated that, as a result, charitable giving
by Americans in the 1980s increased by all possible measures,[41]
while voluntarism made a resurgence among both college students
and professionals.  In 1979, about 300 companies had programs
to encourage workers to participate in community service projects.
By the late 1980s, the number had increased to 600, and at least
200 companies were sending workers into the community on company
time.  Between 1984 and 1989, the number of Americans reporting
charitable volunteer work in Gallup polls rose from 34 percent
to 50 percent.[42]

<p>

Anecdotal evidence from more recent experiments also indicates
that private giving increases in response to cuts in public funding.
In reaction to a Wisconsin Supreme Court injunction against Milwaukee's
newly-expanded school-choice program, which allows parents to
use vouchers at private sectarian schools, residents throughout
the state donated more than $1.2 million to help children stay
in the schools of their choice.[43] And the Public Broadcasting Service
reports a 12 percent increase in private giving over last year.
Federal funds for PBS are scheduled to decrease 6 percent in
1996 and more in 1997.  According to Stu Kantor, PBS associate
director of corporate information, &quot;I think people have been
responding to reports in the news about budgetary pressures facing
PBS.&quot;[44]

</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

A number of technical analyses confirm, conversely, that
government spending crowds out private philanthropy.  Russell
Roberts, for example, concluded succinctly in the <I>Journal of
Political Economy</I>:  &quot;Current data and evidence from the
Depression yield support for the crowding-out result.  The huge
growth in public transfers in the 1930s crowded out private antipoverty
efforts and fundamentally changed the nature of private charity.
Current data also support this conclusion.&quot;[45] The explanation
rests on a simple truth about human nature:  People tend to defer
responsibility when someone else will answer the bell.  Charles
Murray captures the problem with characteristic genius:

<p><blockquote>

<i>

At the microlevel, the dialogue between the government and the
citizen goes roughly like this:

<p>

Do you want to go out and feed the hungry or are you going to
sit here and watch television?

<p>

I'm tired.  What'll happen if I don't go?

<p>

Well, if you don't go I guess I'll just have to do it myself.

<p>

In that case, you go.[46]

</i>

</blockquote><p>

By rewriting the dialogue between citizen and government,
cuts in government spending alone are likely to trigger increases
in voluntary giving.  At the very least, taxpayers should be allowed
to shift a percentage of their personal income tax payments from
public programs to private charities.  Several legislators have
already proposed a dollar-for-dollar tax credit for contributions
to charities engaged in poverty-fighting efforts (defined by the
income level of the service recipients).  Ideally, taxpayers would
be allowed to divert up to 41 percent of their personal income
tax payments -- that is, the share of total individual income
taxes that currently goes to federal means-tested welfare programs.[47]
For each tax dollar allocated to private sector charity, public
sector charity would be reduced by a dollar.  Thus, with the credit,
private organizations would at last be able to compete on a level
playing field for welfare tax dollars.  And taxpayers would have
the opportunity to indicate their preference: more government
bureaucracy or individuals helping individuals down the street?

</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

The dollars sent to poverty-fighting organizations would
not undermine giving to museums and symphony orchestras because
money donated to cultural institutions would still be tax deductible.
At present, the tax code permits charitable deductions from taxable
income -- not from the check owed the I.R.S.  Thus, under the
current system, donors in higher tax brackets benefit more from
charitable giving.  Congress should consider elevating the charitable
deduction to 120 percent, but also restoring the deduction to
non-itemizers.

<p>

Approximately seven out of 10 taxpayers opt for the standard
deduction -- even when they have donated a substantial amount
-- usually because they have no mortgage interest deduction.
An above-the-line deduction for charitable contributions for non-itemizing
taxpayers would not only benefit many middle-to-low-income people,
but is also likely to increase charitable giving to an array of
neighborhood organizations involved in poverty prevention efforts.
During 1985-1986, when a charitable deduction for non-itemizers
was last in place, charitable giving among non-itemizers did in
fact rise dramatically.  And tax provisions that empower <I>everyone</I>, 
not just people of means, are precisely the reforms most likely
to benefit the health clinics and mentoring programs in low-and
middle-income neighborhoods.  Surveys show that people who make
the least are inclined to give the highest percentage of their
income to help neighbors in need.[48]

<p>

While block grants simply reallocate power among public bureaucracies,
tax breaks for giving restore power to individual citizens and
communities -- power that in turn will fuel the ethic of caring
that is the true hallmark of freedom.  In <I>Prospects for Conservatives</I>, 
Russell Kirk wrote:  &quot;The enlightened conservative .
. . knows that the just and ordered society is that in which Love
governs us, so far as Love ever can reign in this world of sorrows;
and he knows that the anarchical or the tyrannical society is
that in which Love lies corrupt.&quot;[49]

is correct that men are &quot;put into this world . . . to aspire

end of a system that thrusts our benevolence out to the remotest
periphery, to people whose names and faces we do not know and
whose hands we cannot hold.  Life for them will not be whole again
until we learn to love, one heart at a time.

<h2>THE LAST WORD</h2>

<p><hr width=60% noshade><p>

<h2>My Favorite Volunteer</h2>

</center>

<p>

<font size=+3>I</font>n all the years of working with church members, 
my favorite volunteer is a woman in her mid-sixties.  For a long time, 
whenever I would speak with her, she would talk about friends who had 
died and about her arthritis.

<p>

She also talked wistfully about a great disappointment in
her life.  As a girl she had set her goal to become a teacher.
But she came from a poor family, and after the eighth grade she
was required to go out to work to help support her family.  Later
she married, and then she sometimes had to work outside the home
to supplement her husband's earnings and sometimes stayed at home
and cared for her four children.  She never regretted any of this,
but she wondered what might have been.

<p>

I approached this woman one day and said that we needed tutors
for Hispanic and Oriental children.  &quot;Will you tutor?&quot;
I asked.  In effect, I was asking, Will you become the teacher
you always wanted to be?

<p>

&quot;I can't,&quot; she replied.  &quot;I'm too old.&quot;

<p>

&quot;You're not too old,&quot;  I replied.

<p>

&quot;I don't have the skills,&quot; she objected.

<p>

&quot;I'll train you,&quot; I said.

<p>

She finally agreed to go through the training program --
probably to get me off her back.  But she told me she wasn't planning
to tutor; she would just help in other ways.  &quot;Fine,&quot;
I said.

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<center>
<font size=+1><b><i>
It is hard to imagine<br>
that anyone anywhere<br>
was happier that night.<br>
She had become the teacher<br>
she had wanted to be.
</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

At the end of the training, I asked her to tutor two Hispanic
boys. She gave in.

<p>

In subsequent months, when I saw her, I would ask, &quot;How
is your arthritis?&quot;

<p>

&quot;What?&quot; she would say.  Instead, she would tell
me about the boys.

<p>

&quot;Have you been reading the obituaries lately?&quot;
I would ask.

<p>

&quot;No,&quot; she would answer, and then tell me about
the problems the boys were having.  The boys became her life.

<p>

A week before Christmas she was sitting in her living room,
and she heard a terrible commotion outside.  When she opened the
front door, there stood the two boys in the snow.  They had brought
all their classmates to sing Christmas carols to their &quot;favorite
teacher.&quot;

<p>

It is hard to imagine that anyone anywhere was happier that
night.  She had become the teacher she had wanted to be.

<p>

I often think that this woman, who is my mother, is like
many other people:  all reticence and excuses, but when they get
the right opportunity, the training and the encouragement, they
succeed.

<title>STATUTORY RAPE: THE DIRTY SECRET BEHIND TEEN SEX NUMBERS</title>

<body>

<center>

<h1>Statutory Rape:</h1>
<h2><i>The Dirty Secret Behind Teen Sex Numbers</i></h2>

</center>

<p>

<font size=+3>C</font>ontrary to the common perception that teenage sex 
and pregnancy typically stem from two teenagers getting caught up in the 
heat of the moment, new research reveals that many teenage girls are
being sexually exploited and impregnated by adult men.

<p>

In fact, a recent study published in the <I>American Journal of
Public Health</I> found that adult men fathered two-thirds of
the infants born to school-aged mothers in California in 1993.
On average, these men were 4.2 years older than the senior-high
mothers and 6.7 years older than the junior-high mothers.[1]

<p>

Likewise, a review of California's 1990 vital statistics found
that men older than high school age sired 77 percent of all births
to high school-aged girls (ages 16-18) and 51 percent of births
to junior high school-aged girls (15 and younger). Men over age
25 fathered twice as many teenage births as did boys under age
18, and men over age 20 fathered five times more births to junior
high school-aged girls than did junior high school-aged boys.[2]

<p>

Unfortunately, this phenomenon is not limited to the state of
California. A recent study by the Population Reference Bureau
found that about two-thirds of births to teenage girls nationwide
are fathered by adult men age 20 or older.[3] Additionally, the Alan
Guttmacher Institute's 1994 report, &quot;Sex and America's Teenagers,&quot;
found that six of 10 girls who had sex before age 15 were coerced
by males an average of six years their senior.[4] The Urban Institute
cites a study showing that &quot;three quarters of females who
had sexual intercourse before age 14 reported having had sex 
involuntarily.&quot;[5]

</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

That our culture at large has been slow to recognize this phenomenon
is not surprising. At one time, the picture of teenage pregnancy
did look vastly different than it does today. In 1970, seven of
10 teen births were within marriage. Today, the opposite is true
-- seven of 10 teen births are out-of-wedlock[6] . . . and many are
the results of statutory rape and victimization.

<p>

In many respects, the rise in statutory rape is the tragic and
predictable consequence of the larger moral free-for-all that
began during the sexual revolution of the 1960s and 1970s. As
sex was severed from the context of marriage and perceived barriers
to personal &quot;freedom&quot; were torn down, the door was opened
to a &quot;liberation&quot; in which predators were given easier
access to the most vulnerable in our society.

<p>

<center><h3>Family Breakdown: Fatherlessness and Child Abuse</h3></center>

<p>

At the heart of this problem, as with most social pathologies,
is the breakdown of the intact two-parent family unit.

<p>

Over the last 25 years, the change in family patterns has been
dramatic. It used to be that the man in every girl's life was
her father. He was her protector and provider, shielding her honor
and ensuring her safety. But between 1970 and 1995, the share
of married-couple families with dependent children dropped by
one-third, while the proportion of single-parent families nearly
doubled. In 1995, 18.9 million children lived with only one parent,
compared with 8.2 million in 1970. Today, the large number of
single-parent families are increasingly due to illegitimacy rather
than divorce.[7]

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<center>
<font size=+1><b><i>
Fatherlessness is associated<br>
with increased risk of child<br>
sexual abuse.
</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

Consequently, fewer fathers are around to protect and defend their
daughters' safety. And with more girls lacking the love and attention
that only a father can give, more of them are vulnerable to abuse,
and that abuse leaves them willing to settle for perverse alternatives,
namely, seeking intimacy with predatory adult men.

<p>

The research is clear: fatherlessness is associated with increased
risk of child sexual abuse.

<p>

For example, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services'
<I>National Health Interview Survey</I> (1988) found that children
from disrupted families are at a much higher risk for physical
or sexual abuse than children from intact, two-parent families.[8]

<p>

A 1993 study in the <I>British Journal of Psychiatry</I> found
that childhood sexual abuse occurred more frequently in women
from disadvantaged and difficult family backgrounds, and that
their risks of becoming a victim were increased if they came from
a broken home.[9]

<p>

Furthermore, children whose parents separate are significantly
more likely to engage in early sexual activity than their peers
from intact, two-parent families, according to a 1994 study in
<I>Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent 
Psychiatry</I>.[10]

<p>

Dr. George Rekers of the University of South Carolina School of
Medicine found that compared with girls in intact nuclear families,
girls who lost their fathers through divorce were overly responsive
to males, more likely to be sexually involved with males in adolescence,
and more often pregnant before marriage.[11]

<p>

David Murray, a social anthropologist, explains the effects of
illegitimacy on girls this way: &quot;For the girls, at earliest
nubility comes predation by older males, undeterred by a resident
father who would protect her honor and her safety.&quot;[12]

<p>

One might mistakenly presume that the presence of a male figure,
besides the father, would help alleviate the situation. But in
fact, when illegitimacy or divorce results in a subsequent marriage,
remarriage, or cohabiting relationship, the likelihood of child
abuse increases.

<p>

According to a study by the Canadian researchers Martin Daly and
Margo Wilson, preschool children in stepfamilies are 40 times
as likely as children in intact families to suffer physical or
sexual abuse.[13]

<p>

Additionally, a 1994 study in the <i>Journal of Comparative Family
Studies</i> found that, out of 52,000 child abuse cases, 72 percent
involved children living in a household without one or both biological
parents, even though such households comprise roughly a third
of all households with children.[14]

<p>

Not only is fatherlessness associated with child abuse, but abused
children are also more vulnerable to further exploitation, particularly
further sexual exploitation. Kathy Szafran, residential program
director for the Florence Crittenton Homes and Services in West
Virginia, was quoted in <I>The Washington Times</I> as saying,
&quot;It shouldn't be hard to see 'why a child who's been molested
since age 7 is acting out sexually at age 14.'&quot;

<p>

Indeed, research shows that teenage mothers whose babies were
fathered by adult men are disproportionately the childhood victims
of sexual assault by adult men.[15]

<p>

A 1992 Washington state study of 535 adolescent mothers found
that 62 percent of the teenage mothers had had a history of rape
or sexual molestation by men whose ages averaged 27 years.[16] This
study found that, compared with nonabused mothers, abused adolescent
mothers initiated sex earlier, had sex with much older partners,
and engaged in riskier, more frequent, and promiscuous sex.[17]

</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

In a recent edition of <I>Newsweek</I>, Joe Klein poignantly described
the connection between fatherlessness, child abuse, and subsequent
sexual victimization when he recounted the personal testimony
of a girl whom he called Charlette. &quot;The guy's name was Mickey.
He was older, in his mid-20s. Charlette was going through a bad
time: her stepfather had come home from prison, was beating her
mother, was beating on her. 'I lived in the streets for a while,
starting when I was 14,' she said. 'I was young and vulnerable.
I had problems. He was going to protect me, teach me things, discipline
my mind. But when I told him I was pregnant, he was gone. I began
to ask around.... I found he had six other children, mostly with
younger girls. I was naive, and he took advantage of me.&quot;
Joe Klein later remarked, &quot;As for the girls, who are inevitably
fatherless, Charlette's yearning for protection -- for a <I>father</I>
-- seems entirely comprehensible.&quot;[18]

<p>

Fatherlessness, however, not only creates the environment for
more vulnerable girls, it also helps create more predatory males.
Research shows that boys who grow up without fathers are far more
likely to engage in violent behavior and promiscuity than those
who grow up in two-parent homes.

<p>

According to a 1990 article by Nicholas Davidson in <I>Policy
Review</I>, 60 percent of America's rapists grew up in homes without
fathers.[19] Furthermore, a research review by Dr. George Rekers of
the University of South Carolina School of Medicine found that
the fatherless boys exhibit greater aggressiveness or exaggerated
masculine behavior.[20]

<p>

It is also important to note that many of these predatory adult
men may have originated from fatherless families in which they,
too, had been abused.

<p>

<center><h3>Family Breakdown: The Lack of Parental Supervision</h3></center>

<p>

Ensuring that children receive adequate parental supervision is
already a difficult task in today's two-parent homes because the
financial constraints of modern-day life make it increasingly
difficult for one parent to stay at home full-time. But when parents
face single-parenthood because of divorce or illegitimacy, the
difficulties of supervising their children are compounded.

<p>

Research shows that teenagers who are subject to less adult supervision
are more likely to engage in sexual activity. This association
applies not only to homes which lack parental supervision during
the day, but also to neighborhoods in which a high percentage
of the adult labor force works full-time. This effect suggests
that teenagers who are less closely supervised have more opportunity
to engage in sexual behavior.

<p>

While the amount of parental and/or adult supervision that a teenager
receives during the day is difficult to measure, researchers have
often used maternal employment as a proxy for adult supervision
since much teen sexual activity today takes place after school
in the homes of &quot;latchkey&quot; children.

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<center>
<font size=+1><b><i>
The effect of maternal<br>
employment on early<br>
intercourse is greater<br>
for teens with mothers<br>
employed full-time than<br>
for adolescents with<br>
mothers employed part-<br>
time.
</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

For example, a 1993 study published in <I>Public Health Reports</I>
found that young males who have mothers that work full-time are
significantly more likely (by 89 percent in blacks and 26 percent
in nonblacks) to have initiated intercourse than are boys with
non-employed mothers. Young black males who have mothers that
work for pay part-time are 56 percent more likely to have started
having intercourse than are those whose mothers are not employed.[21]

<p>

The same study also found that the effect of maternal employment
on early intercourse is greater for teens with mothers employed
full-time than for adolescents with mothers employed part-time.
Compared with non-employed mothers, part-time work is associated
with a 26 percent increase in early intercourse and full-time
work is associated with a 45 percent increase.[22]

<p>

Furthermore, a 1994 study in the <I>Journal of Marriage and the
Family</I> reported that white females whose mothers are employed
outside the home are more likely to have had intercourse than
females whose mothers are not employed.[23]

<p>

This same study also found that the percentage of female labor
force participants who are employed full-time in a given neighborhood
is associated with an increased likelihood of premarital sexual
activity among young women in the neighborhood. This effect, which
is consistent in both black and white female teenagers,[24] suggests
that the deterrent effect of having a parent in the home may be
undermined somewhat if the girl's boyfriend goes home to an empty
house after school.

<p>

Additionally, a 1994 study published in the <I>Journal of Adolescent
Health</I> found that white teenage girls whose mothers work for
pay full-time outside the home are more likely to lead promiscuous
lives as adults (have multiple partners) than girls whose mothers
do not work for pay full-time.[25]

<p>

<center><h3>Erosion of Cultural Protections</h3></center>

<p>

While absent fathers figure prominently in this new phenomenon
of child abuse, they are not solely to blame for the devastation.
Cultural influences such as the media and schools have also failed
to protect children.

<p>

Television and movies regularly expose children to sexually explicit
images, glamorizing sex and violence. While the instances of this
type of cultural pollution are too numerous to count, one particular
example should be noted here. A recent (March 1996) episode of
the television prime time drama,<I> Chicago Hope</I>, featured
a storyline in which a 14-year-old girl was having sex with an
adult man. The drama explored both viewpoints about why it was
either permissible or impermissible for the young girl to be having
sex with an adult man, but in the end, the show condoned their
sexual relations because they were &quot;in love.&quot;

<p>

In addition to the media, schools have now taken up the mantle
of exposing children to sexually explicit information -- this
time, in the guise of &quot;sex education.&quot; Many school administrators
have mistakenly concluded that the way to &quot;prevent&quot;
the problem of teen pregnancy is to expose children at progressively
younger and younger ages to more explicit sex education in the
school, so that children can learn how to protect themselves with
condoms, etc. But this scenario is a textbook case in which the
&quot;cure&quot; is far worse than the disease.

<p>

The results of the National Survey of Adolescent Males published
in the November 1993 issue of <I>Public Health Reports</I> show
that young males who were taught about birth control were more
likely to experiment with sex at an earlier age than if they had
received no (formal) instruction.[26]

<p>

Furthermore, explicit sex education can tear down the natural
inhibitions and defenses of both young boys and girls, leaving
them vulnerable to sexual predators. Indeed, pedophiles often
use pornography to lure their young victims.[27]

<p>

In spite of this, the Sex Information and Education Council of
the United States (SIECUS), a federally-funded, nationally-recognized
organization, has issued national sex education guidelines which
promote teaching kindergartners about masturbation and junior
and senior high school students about the &quot;benefits&quot;
of pornography, among other topics.[28]

<p>

<center><h3>Erosion of Legal Protections</h3></center>

<p>

Declining cultural norms and values also have a detrimental effect
on laws intended to protect children. When the culture condones
particular kinds of illegal behavior, the law loses its authority
to prosecute. This has clearly been the case with statutory rape
laws.

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

Laws against statutory rape were originally designed to protect
adolescent girls -- typically aged 16 and under -- from sex under
any circumstance, regardless of whether there was &quot;consent.&quot;
These laws were premised on the belief that young girls were too
immature to be having sex and that they could no more give meaningful
consent to sexual activity than they &quot;could consent to work
nights as a stripper in a bar.&quot;[29] But during the sexual revolution
of the 1960s and 1970s, states began to change their laws to reflect
more permissive cultural attitudes.

<p>

First, the age of consent for sexual activity was lowered or altered.
In two states, Hawaii and Pennsylvania, 14 years is the age of
consent. Many other laws were changed to say that having sex with
a young teenage girl was statutory rape, but sex with a girl in
her mid-teens was only considered statutory rape if the male was
three or four years older than she was. In other words, a 15-year-old
girl could have sex with a 15-year-old boy, but not with a 19-year-old
man.[30]

<p>

For example, in Virginia, 18 is the age of consent. However, a
person can only be prosecuted for rape if the victim is under
13 years old. A lesser felony offense can be charged if a person
three or more years older has consensual intercourse with a 13-
or 14-year old, but it is only a misdemeanor if the offender is
less than three years older. It is also considered only a misdemeanor
if a person over 18 has consensual intercourse with a child aged
15 or older.[31]

<p>

In Indiana, where the age of consent is 16, there is no longer
a crime of statutory rape. Instead, the state can charge an adult
with child molestation if the child is under age 14, or with sexual
misconduct if the minor is 14 or 15 years old. However, the sexual
misconduct charge can only be leveled at people 18 years and older.
Thus, a 17-year-old who has sex with a 14-year-old could not be
charged with sexual misconduct.[32]

<p>

Although it may seem absurd that the United States allowed the
age of sexual consent to be lowered at all, the example of Britain's
current exploration on lowering their own age of sexual consent
laws is revealing. Indeed, the arguments being currently used
by British proponents of lowering the age of consent mirror the
arguments that led the United States down this slippery slope.
Consider the comments of Alison Hadley of The Brook Advisory Centres,
which runs 27 National Health Service-funded birth control clinics
for teenagers and young adults in England, Scotland, and Ulster:
&quot;Teenagers under 16 don't automatically put a brake on their
raging hormones and postpone having sex just because it is decreed
in law. The age of consent also presupposes that we all mature
at the same time. We don't. We often see mature girls of 14 as
well as 16-year-olds with plenty of growing still to do. Like
it or not, many 14- and 15-year-olds are having sex.&quot;[33]

<p>

Unfortunately, the United States knows all too well about the
devastating consequences of that perverse logic.

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<font size=+1><b><i>
Laws against statutory<br>

regardless of whether<br>
there was 'consent.'

</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

Second, lax law enforcement of statutory rape crimes have added
fuel to the fire. Few courts have given priority to the prosecution
of adults who have sex with minors, especially because they are
pressed with many other cases of violent delinquency and child
abuse. But prosecutors say that the biggest stumbling block against
bringing a case to court is the girls themselves. Many girls are
reluctant, if not hostile witnesses who either recant or refuse
to testify against their adult &quot;lovers,&quot; the fathers
of their children.[34] The girls may also decline to name the father
if they fear retaliation.[35]

<p>

In addition, parents have not usually understood that they can
seek legal protection through the courts. Parents may ask a juvenile
court judge to declare the girl &quot;ungovernable&quot; and order
her not to see the man. But such cases are low in priorities for
courts, and a court order may not stop stubborn lovers anyway.
If juvenile court sanctions fail, parents can take the next step
and press criminal charges. But police and prosecutors say they're
often hamstrung in these cases, by parents afraid that if the
law gets involved, their daughters will run away, and by lack
of evidence when lovestruck girls refuse to testify.[36]

<p>

Third, the law has not always upheld the rights of parents to
protect their children's innocence. For example, the federal family
planning program -- Title X of the Public Health Service Act --
undermines parental authority in their children's reproductive
health decision-making. Title X is a categorical grant program
which gives federal funds to family planning clinics all around
the country. Title X clinics offer contraceptives, pelvic exams,
pregnancy tests, screening for sexually-transmitted diseases,
and sexual health counseling to minors without parental notification
or consent.[37] However, even though the actual law specifies that
family participation is to be encouraged, the federal policy guidelines
state that clinics receiving Title X support must guarantee patient
confidentiality, and this mandate that has been upheld by the
courts.[38]

<p>

Furthermore, Title X clinics have no provisions regarding the
reporting of suspected cases of statutory rape. In fact, these
clinics may be indirectly aiding and abetting the problem in at
least four ways: (1) the clinic does not involve parents, even
in cases where the child is very young and is admittedly &quot;sexually
active,&quot; (2) the clinic's dispensation of contraceptives
can mask a problem that might otherwise be brought to light, (3)
clinics will see and treat &quot;any woman, regardless of age,&quot;
even when that &quot;woman&quot; is 11 or 12 years old,[39] and (4)
counselors are not trained to look for cases of statutory rape
nor are they required to report any suspected cases of statutory
rape to local law enforcement. That omission is especially horrendous
in light of the current data which show that two-thirds of all
teenage births are fathered by adult men.

<p>

<center><h3>Renew Efforts to Prosecute Statutory Rape</h3></center>

<p>

The most direct way to address the problem of statutory rape is
through the law enforcement system. California Governor Pete Wilson
has cracked down on statutory rapists as part of his state's campaign
against teenage pregnancy. Last summer he allocated $2.4 million
to a pilot program for 16 counties to begin prosecuting men who
engage in sex with underage girls, and in January 1996, he pledged
$6 million more for a statewide crackdown.[40]

<p>

The California State Assembly also recently passed a bill which
would add penalties of up to five years in jail for statutory
rape when a minor becomes pregnant. This penalty can be sought
in addition to civil and/or criminal suits for statutory rape.[41]

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<font size=+1><b><i>

</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

In Florida, state legislators will soon consider a &quot;Teen
Predators Act&quot; which would create a new child abuse felony
in cases where a man older than 21 impregnates a girl under 16.
A conviction would result in mandatory prison time.[42] Another bill
seeking consideration in Florida is nicknamed MAMA, which stands
for &quot;Make Adult Males Accountable.&quot; This bill would
allow some statutory rapists to be prosecuted under child-abuse
laws, which would have the beneficial effect of requiring medical
facilities, day-care centers, and schools to report statutory
rape as they would any other incident of suspected child abuse.[43]

<p>

Efforts must also be made to change the rhetoric and perception
under which minors are viewed as mature decision-makers. For example,
in the Alan Guttmacher Institute's 1994 report, &quot;Sex and
America's Teenagers,&quot; adolescents girls who have been exploited
by adult men are repeatedly referred to as &quot;sexually-experienced
women.&quot;[44] The Alan Guttmacher Institute, Planned Parenthood,
and other proponents of aggressive marketing of contraceptives
and abortions to minor children have consistently refused to use
language that reinforces the need for special protection for teenage
girls and boys -- especially that provided by their families.

</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

The use of &quot;women&quot; in this context serves the purpose
of fostering an egalitarian drive to repeal parental rights statutes,
but masks the emotional and psychological immaturity that makes
sexual activity at this stage of life especially risky.[45]

<p>

Finally, states should seriously consider raising the age of sexual
consent laws to mirror the age of marriage laws. Currently, 16
is the age of sexual consent in most states, but the minimum legal
age of marriage in most states is 18.[46] (A few states have higher
ages for marriage, but no state's marriage law is below the age
of 18, except with parental consent.) This action would not only
allow states to legally prosecute the statutory rape cases which
occur during the later teen years (ages 16-17), but it would also
help to relink sex to its proper context within marriage.

<p>

<center><h3>Strengthen the Family</h3></center>

<p>

While public policy can directly address the problem of statutory
rape through legislative means, its ability to impact the root
cause of statutory rape -- family breakdown -- is only indirect
at best. After all, the law cannot -- and should not -- dictate
to families how to raise their children, but the law can and should
encourage behaviors which help strengthen the family through the
use of incentives and disincentives.

<p>

For example, in order to discourage illegitimacy, public policy
makers have sought to implement a &quot;family cap,&quot; a measure
which would halt additional welfare payments to mothers who bear
further illegitimate children while on welfare. Public policy
makers have also sought to overturn no-fault divorce laws and/or
elevate marriage from a &quot;contract&quot; to a &quot;covenant&quot;
relationship in order to support the permanency of marriage. Furthermore,
laws which provide tax relief for families as well as policies
which provide employees with more flexible work hours and/or work-at-home
arrangements may help to increase parental supervision of children.

<p>

While the aforementioned policies are sound and can be very helpful,
they alone cannot break the cycle of illegitimacy and divorce,
especially because the scourges of illegitimacy and divorce are
transferred through generations. That is, children whose parents
are unmarried or divorced are more likely to also one day bear
illegitimate children or have their own marriages end in divorce.[47]
Thus, other non-public policy means of prevention must be encouraged
as well.

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<font size=+1><b><i>
States should seriously<br>
consider raising the age<br>
of sexual consent laws<br>

marriage laws.
</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

One effective method of prevention which should not be overlooked
is the impact of religion. Indeed, a large body of research shows
that religiously committed individuals are less likely to divorce
or separate from one's spouse.[48] Teenagers with high personal religiosity
are also less likely to engage in premarital sex or cohabit.[49] Another
study found that adolescent males who went to church more often
at age 14 were less likely to have early intercourse.[50]

<p>

<center><h3>Conclusion</h3></center>

<p>

The current trend of adult men impregnating teenage girls is a
natural consequence of family breakdown and its subsequent effects
on culture and the law. But what children need now is what they
have always needed -- for adults to protect their innocence. They
need fathers and mothers who will love and supervise them, laws
that punish statutory rapists, and a culture which values and
upholds the sacredness of marital sex, the permanency of marriage,
and the authority of parents.

<title>PARENTAL RIGHTS: WHO DECIDES HOW CHILDREN ARE RAISED?</title>

<body>

<h1>Parental Rights:</h1>
<h2><i>Who Decides How Children Are Raised?</i></h2>

</center>

<p>

<font size=+3>F</font>rom ancient times to modernity, political philosophy 
has grappled with the sensitive relationship between the child, family, 
and state.  In <I>The Republic</I>, Plato wrote:

<p><blockquote>

<i>&quot;The wives of our guardians are to be common, and their
children are to be common, and no parent is to know his own child,
nor any child his parent. . . .  The proper officers will take
the offspring of the good parents to the pen or fold, and there
they will deposit them with certain nurses who dwell in a separate
quarter.&quot;</i>

</blockquote><p>

In <I>Orthodoxy</I>, G.K. Chesterton observed:

<p><blockquote>

<i>&quot;In short, the democratic faith is this:  that the
most terribly important things must be left to ordinary men themselves
-- the mating of the sexes, the rearing of the young, the laws
of the state.&quot;</i>

</blockquote><p>

Like Plato, modern-day utopian thinkers and totalitarian
states have always looked upon the parent-child relationship with
suspicion at best, and more often as the crucial obstacle to ultimate
state power over the individual.  For even if the state is successful
in dissolving all other institutions which mediate between the
individual and state, such as local government, the church, and
private associations, it must still contend with the family unit
as the last bastion of organic relationships from which spring
an individual's prior loyalties.  Because a totalitarian regime
can admit of no prior loyalties, ultimately the natural bonds
between husband and wife, and parent and child must also be dissolved,
reducing even children to the status of atomized individuals,
helpless before the Leviathan.

<font size=+1><b><i>

</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

Conversely, as Chesterton so eloquently expressed, respect
for the autonomy of the family is as central to the democratic
ideal as popular sovereignty.  The democratic experiment is founded
on an optimism in the ability of the people to manage their own
affairs, in their capacity as citizens with authority over &quot;the
laws of the state,&quot; and in their capacity as parents with
authority over &quot;the rearing of the young.&quot;  Therefore,
restoring parental rights to its original firm foundation in U.S.
constitutional law is crucial to our overall efforts to reinvigorate
the democratic ideal of citizenship.

<p>

<center><h3>The Constitutional Roots of Parental Rights</h3></center>

<p>

Parental liberty as a fundamental right found a secure place
in U.S. constitutional jurisprudence beginning with two Supreme
Court cases from the 1920s.  The 1923 decision in <I>Meyer v.
Nebraska</I>[1] involved a challenge to a Nebraska state law which
prohibited the teaching of foreign languages in any school --
public or private -- prior to the eighth grade.  In determining
whether or not the foreign-language prohibition unreasonably infringed
upon family rights,[2] the Supreme Court declared that the 14th Amendment
liberty interest &quot;[w]ithout doubt, [] denotes not merely
freedom from bodily restraint but also the right of the individual
to contract, to engage in any of the common occupations of life,
to acquire useful knowledge, to marry, establish a home and bring
up children.&quot;[3] The Court held that the Nebraska statute interfered
with the parents' fundamental right to raise their children, including
the right to have their children learn a foreign language.

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<center>
<font size=+1><b><i>
With the parental<br>
responsibility to protect<br>
their children from harm<br>
comes the parental right<br>
to direct their children's<br>
upbringing and education.
</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

Two years later, in <I>Pierce v. Society of Sisters,</I>[4] the
Court examined an Oregon state statute compelling parents to send
their children to public schools from ages 8 to 16 -- essentially
banning private education.[5]  While acknowledging that the State
has the authority to enact reasonable regulations to ensure the
basic education of the citizenry,[6] the Court held that in this
instance state authority must yield to the rights of parents.
&quot;Under the doctrine of <I>Meyer v. Nebraska</I>, we think
it entirely plain that the [Oregon state] Act of 1922 unreasonably
interferes with the liberty of parents and guardians to direct
the upbringing and education of children under their control&quot;[7]
(citations omitted). The Court stated:

<p><blockquote>

<i>The fundamental theory of liberty upon which all governments
in this Union repose excludes any general power of the State to
standardize its children by forcing them to accept instruction
from public teachers only.  The child is not the mere creature
of the State; those who nurture him and direct his destiny have
the right, coupled with the high duty, to recognize and prepare
him for additional obligations.</i>[8]

</blockquote><p>

A generation passed before the high court issued another landmark
parental rights decision, <I>Prince v. Massachusetts</I>.[9] The
Court ruled in favor of state authority over the asserted parental
right of Sarah Prince, a Jehovah's Witness.  Prince was the guardian
of a 9-year-old girl whom she took with her to sell religious
pamphlets on the street.  When charged with violating state child
labor laws, Prince claimed that the law violated her religious
freedom and parental rights.  The Court, citing <I>Pierce</I>,
acknowledged parental rights in the strongest terms:

<p><blockquote>

<i>It is cardinal with us that the custody, care and nurture
of the child reside first in the parents, whose primary function
and freedom include preparation for obligations the state can
neither supply nor hinder.  And it is in recognition of this that
these decisions have respected the private realm of family life
which the state cannot enter&quot; (citations omitted).</i>[10]

</blockquote><p>

Despite this reaffirmation, the Court recognized that the state
may act to protect children by &quot;limiting parental freedom
and authority in things affecting the child's welfare&quot;[11] 
including protecting the child from &quot;the crippling effects of 
child employment,&quot; especially in public places.[12]

<p>

In 1972, the Supreme Court again considered a case involving
overlapping issues of parental rights and religious freedom.
In <I>Wisconsin v. Yoder</I>,[13] Amish families desired to remove
their children from school after the eighth grade, violating Wisconsin's
compulsory education law.[14] The Court declared:

<p><blockquote>

<i>Indeed it seems clear that if the State is empowered, as</I> 
parens patriae, <I>to &quot;save&quot; a child from himself
or his Amish parents by requiring an additional two years of compulsory
formal high school education, the State will in large measure
influence, if not determine, the religious future of the child.
Even more markedly than in Prince, therefore, this case involves
the fundamental interest of parents, as contrasted with that of
the State, to guide the religious future and education of their
children.</i>[15]

</blockquote><p>

While recognizing the State's &quot;high responsibility for
education of its citizens,&quot;[16] the Court concluded that this
interest did not outweigh the Amish parents' religious beliefs
and parent liberty interest in directing the education of their
children.[17]

<p>

<center><h3>The Modern Assault on Parental Rights</h3></center>

<p>

The state laws overturned by the high court in <I>Meyer</I>
and <I>Pierce</I> were generated by racial and religious tensions
typical of the 1920s (<I>Meyer</I> dealt with anti-German sentiment
following World War I, and <I>Pierce</I>, the anti-Catholicism
of the age).  Recent conflicts between parents and the state involve
a broad range of matters at the very heart of the parent-child
relationship.  The growing parental backlash against schools and
other government bureaucracies is best understood as part of the
overall struggle parents face as they attempt to transmit their
most cherished beliefs to their children in the midst of an anti-family
culture.

<p>

Many social commentators have focused attention on our degraded
popular culture, and it is widely recognized that parents face
an increasingly difficult task in monitoring their children's
exposure to the barrage of harmful images produced by Hollywood,
pop music, and the Internet.  But while a national debate rages
over the proper response to the polluted commercial marketplace,
relatively little attention has been focused on the fact that
too often parents have discovered that their own <I>government</I>
is part of the problem.  Increasingly, parents are demanding that
government policies support, rather than undermine, their authority.

<p>

The past generation has witnessed the growth of  two overlapping
trends in public policy which have significantly undermined parental
authority and family autonomy.  The first is exemplified by laws
giving minors access to abortion and birth control without parental
approval, and in looming threats like the U.N. Convention on the
Rights of the Child.[18] Implicit in these policies is an assumption
that children should be treated as &quot;short adults,&quot; i.e.,
as autonomous individuals, fully capable of making crucial decisions
about their upbringing, and legally entitled to make these decisions
outside the context of their family.  The second trend involves
the state's increasing propensity to substitute its judgment for
that of parents in matters relating to the upbringing and education
of children.

<p>

These trends run counter to the longstanding philosophical
and legal understanding  that with the parental responsibility
to <I>protect</I> their children from harm comes the parental
right to <I>direct</I> their children's upbringing and education.
But in cases where the state allows minors access to the full
range of choices formerly reserved for adults, parents are effectively
prevented from fulfilling their role as protector.  When the state
substitutes its judgment for that of parents by actually making
the choice for the minor, parental responsibility to guide their
children's choices is usurped.

<p>

<center><h3>'Short Adults'</h3></center>

<p>

Historically, the majority of our laws regulating minors' choices
have been of a protective nature.  For example, adults many not
enter into binding contracts with unemancipated minors, on the
assumption that a child should not be legally bound to fulfill
a contract between parties of such unequal bargaining power and
capacity.  Adults are also prohibited from selling alcohol, tobacco,
and pornography to children.  Abuse laws protect children if the
threat comes from within the family.  The law steps in to protect
the child from being harmed by a more powerful agent.

<p>

While it is indisputable that children have rights, parents
traditionally have been considered the proper custodians of these
rights until their children reach adulthood.  &quot;The presumptions
arising from the limited capacities of children account, in large
part, for their general limitation on the exercise of 'choice'
rights.  The law, and traditionally the culture, has assumed that
a basic capacity to make responsible choices is a prerequisite
to meaningful exercise of such rights.&quot;[19]

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<font size=+1><b><i>
The so-called 'children's<br>
rights' movement threatens<br>
to destroy a child's most<br>
precious right: the right<br>
to childhood innocence.
</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

The 1967 case of <I>In re Gault</I>[20] marked the Supreme Court's
first unequivocal ruling that children have constitutional rights.
While <I>Gault</I> involved juvenile court delinquency proceedings,
the Court's reasoning has far broader implications for the general
liberty of children.  Courts have begun to grant children &quot;choice&quot;
rights like adults in select areas, most notably, by guaranteeing
access to birth control and abortion.[21] This has served as a compelling
precedent for other state policies which prevent parents from
controlling minor's choice rights.

<p>

The movement to grant minors full access to the full range
of choices available to adults naturally leads to liberation of
children from their parents, who serve as an obstacle to the free
exercise of these new rights.  But in a tragic irony, the so-called
&quot;children's rights&quot; movement threatens to destroy a
child's most precious right:  the right to childhood innocence.
A startling example of this phenomenon can be found in local
public libraries.  The American Library Association is formally
opposed to any restrictions on a child's ability to check out
any item, no matter how pornographic or inappropriate for children,
regardless of parental objections.[22] The ALA has gone so far as
to refuse to let parents view the check-out records of their minor
children on grounds that such action would violate the child's
privacy rights.[23] The emotional and moral health of children is
thus sacrificed on the altar of &quot;intellectual freedom,&quot;
and parents are again prevented from fulfilling their responsibility
to protect the child.

<p>

The &quot;children's rights&quot; agenda perhaps is best embodied
in the U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child,[24] an international
treaty adopted by the U.N. General Assembly in 1989.  According
to the United Nation's Children's Fund (UNICEF), the Convention
&quot;defines the minimum standards for civil, economic, social,
cultural, and political rights of children.&quot;[25] Ratifying nations
are called to guarantee a host of rights to children, including
&quot;the right to freedom of expression; . . . regardless of
frontiers,&quot; and the right &quot;to freedom of thought, conscience
and religion.&quot;[26]

<p>

More than 170 countries have ratified the Convention.  In February
1995, President Bill Clinton sent the treaty to the U.S. Senate
for possible ratification, where it is currently pending.  The
U.S. Constitution declares that international treaties ratified
by the U.S. become the &quot;supreme Law of the Land.&quot;[27] Therefore,
the U.N. Convention raises serious questions as to its implications
for parental rights in the U.S.  Are these &quot;children's rights&quot;
intended to be legally enforceable over and against the rights
and responsibilities of parents? What might be the scope of a
child's right, for example, to &quot;freedom of expression?&quot;[28]

<p>

<center><h3>Substituted Judgment</h3></center>

<p>

Competing interests of the family and state most frequently
meet in the public school arena.  Schools traditionally have functioned
<I>in loco parentis, i.e.,</I> in place of parents. This
implies that parents have delegated partial authority to the school.
But when school officials contradict the will or values of parents,
they exceed their delegated authority and substitute their judgment
for that of the parents.  Several recent examples from around
the country highlight the increasingly brazen tendency toward
substituted judgment in the public schools.

<p>

On March 19, 1996, 59 sixth-grade girls from the J.T. Lambert
Intermediate School in East Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania, were taken
to the school nurse's office where they were required to remove
their clothes and submit to a genital examination as part of a
&quot;routine&quot; physical.  While Pennsylvania state law allows
for physical examinations at elementary schools, the East Stroudsburg
parents quite naturally did not expect such an examination to
include intrusive vaginal exams.

<p>

One family was horrified to learn that their daughter had been
forced to undergo the exam despite the fact that they had already
taken the option of submitting an exam report from their own doctor.
Their daughter reported that she had told the school official
in charge that her report was on file, but the official said
that the school had lost the report and that the girl had no choice
but to have the exam.  The girl began to cry and plead with the
school officials to use the phone to call her mother.  But she
was prohibited from calling her mother, and the school nurse stood
in front of the door, blocking the exit.  After submitting to
the exam, she came home in tears, physically and emotionally hurt.[29]

<p>

When questioned, the school initially denied that the girls
had been touched at all.  The school then abruptly changed its
position and admitted that gynecological exams had been conducted
on these 11-year-olds to check for sexually-transmitted diseases
and sexual abuse, even though no incident of disease or abuse
had been indicated.  At the time of this writing, several families
had filed suit against the school, which continues to defend its
action.

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<center>
<font size=+1><b><i>

</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

Unfortunately, the outrage of East Stroudsburg is not an isolated
case.  In Stephens County, Georgia, Sharon and Waymon Earls were
shocked to discover that their 14- and 15-year-old daughters had
been driven to a birth control clinic by a public school staffer
without their knowledge.  The county clinic dispensed birth control
pills and condoms to the girls and administered Pap smears and
AIDS tests.  Mr. and Mrs. Earls were then denied access to the
test results by the school, which defended its actions on the
grounds that the counselor believed she was doing what was best
for the girls.  The counselor's husband, Stephens County School
Superintendent Ed Mills, admitted that his wife had driven many
other girls to the clinic over the years.[30]

<p>

Public schools are also increasingly adopting policies whereby
an entire class is subjected to mandatory psychological testing
or explicit sex education which contradicts the values taught
at home.  Psychological testing of children is often performed
under the guise of standardized tests which include intrusive
questions about the child's emotional state and sexual experiences,
the child's relationship with his or her parents, and values and
habits within the home.

<p>

For example, a 149-question survey used in Minnesota public
schools without parental approval contains questions such as:

<p><ul>

<li><i>Have you ever tried to kill yourself?

<br>

<li>How often have you run away from home?

<br>

<li>Have you felt so discouraged or hopeless that you wondered
if anything was worthwhile?</i>[31]

</ul><p>

In California, in 1994, a statewide controversy erupted over
one such test known as the California Learning Assessment System
(CLAS), a mandatory, standardized test administered to over a
million public school students.  After rumors began circulating
among parents regarding the intrusive nature of some of the questions,
the public school bureaucracy added insult to injury by refusing
to let parents even see the CLAS test their children would be
required to take.[32]

<p>

Parents who have challenged intrusive government policies in
court have met with decidedly mixed results.  Three high-profile
cases recently rejected by the U.S. Supreme Court serve as a disheartening
barometer of the status of parental rights.

<p>

<i><b>Newkirk v. Lansing:</b></i>[33]

<p>

During the 1989-1990 school
year, Daniel and Nancy Newkirk from East Lansing, Michigan, discovered
that their 8-year-old son Jason was being psychologically counseled
by an unlicensed, untrained guidance counselor against their express
wishes.  The case began when Jason's teacher told the Newkirks
that their son wasn't &quot;interacting&quot; with classmates
as she thought he should.  The parents agreed to let their son
&quot;play games&quot; (like checkers) with the guidance counselor,
but flatly refused to allow any psychological counseling.

<p>

Despite this apparent understanding, the counselor began subjecting
Jason to &quot;The Talking, Feeling, and Doing Game, a Psychotherapeutic
Game for Children.&quot;  While the manufacturer of this game
warns that it is intended for use &quot;only by mental health
professionals,&quot; the counselor had no such training.

<p>

Questions posed to young Jason from the game included:

<p><ul>

<li><i>Tell something about your mother that gets you angry.

<br>

<li>What do you think about a boy who sometimes wished that
his brother were dead?

<br>

<li>What is the worst thing you can say about your family?</i>[34]

</ul><p>

After the counseling began, the Newkirks noticed changes in
their son's attitude, and he began complaining to his parents
about his sessions with the counselor.  The Newkirks' confronted
the school, but were told that the relationship between the boy
and the counselor was &quot;confidential.&quot;  They then had
a psychiatrist examine Jason, who diagnosed the boy as having
suffered emotional damage from the sessions, including separation
anxiety disorder and panic attacks.

<p>

The Newkirks filed suit in July 1991 in U.S. District Court
against the school district and some of the school staff involved.
In March 1993, the U.S. District Court ruled against the parents.
On appeal, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed this ruling,
and the U.S. Supreme Court refused to review the case,
leaving the Newkirks with no further remedy.

<p>

<i><b>Brown v. Hot, Sexy and Safer Productions:</b></i>[35]

<p>

In 1992, students in a Chelmsford, Massachusetts public high
school were compelled to attend a sex education seminar by Suzi
Landolph entitled &quot;Hot, Sexy, and Safer.&quot;  A transcript
of Ms. Landolph's performance in Chelmsford reveals that it included
simulated masturbation, crude language, and condom licking.  Chelmsford
parents were given neither advance notice nor a chance to remove
their children from the seminar.

<p>

Ronald and Suzanne Brown and other Chelmsford parents filed
suit, alleging that the school's &quot;opt-out&quot; policy was
not followed.  The parents lost their case before the First Circuit
Court of Appeals in Massachusetts, and in March 1996 the U.S.
Supreme Court declined to review another major parental rights
case, allowing the lower court decision against the parents to
stand.

<p>

<i><b>Curtis v. School Comm. of Falmouth:</b></i>[36]

<p>

Elizabeth Curtis and other parents from Falmouth, Massachusetts, filed 
suit in 1992 against their school board's installation of condom vending
machines in their high schools.  Moreover, according to school
board policy, school nurses were to give condoms upon request
to children as young as 11 in the junior high schools, notwithstanding
the written objections of their parents.  The County Superior
Court refused to grant a parental &quot;opt-out&quot; of the condom
program, and an appeal was rejected by the Massachusetts Supreme
Court in July 1995.  In January 1996, Bay State parents suffered
another loss when the U.S. Supreme Court refused without comment
to hear their appeal, further undermining parental rights in the
state of Massachusetts.[37]

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

The Massachusetts Supreme Court maintained that because the
condom program was not &quot;coercive,&quot; the school was not
usurping parental rights:

<p><blockquote>

<i>[T]he students are free to decline to participate in the
program. . . . For their part, the plaintiffs are free to instruct
their children not to participate. . . . Although exposure to
condom vending machines and to the program itself may offend the
moral and religious sensibilities of the plaintiffs, mere exposure
to programs offered at school does not amount to unconstitutional
interference with parental liberties without the existence of
some compulsory aspects to the program.</i>[38]

</blockquote><p>

This passage from <I>Curtis</I> reveals how treating minors
as &quot;short adults&quot; works in tandem with state-substituted
judgment to undermine parental authority.  First, we are told
that the condom program is &quot;voluntary&quot; because the <I>students</I>
&quot;are free to decline to participate,&quot; <I>i.e.</I>, they
are autonomous actors capable of making their own decisions about
choices presented to them at school.  The school maintains a facade
of neutrality with regard to the choice presented, but by presenting
to the child extra-curricular options that starkly contradict
the values of the parent, the state is assisting the child in
circumventing the parent's will.

<p>

<center><h3>Reaffirming Parental Rights</h3></center>

<p>

Until recently, the primary battleground in the struggle to
preserve parental rights has been the state and federal court
system.  While individual families continue to press their case
in courts around the country, it has become increasingly clear
that parents need legislative remedies.  As a result, the parental
rights movement has become proactive, inspiring the introduction
of legislation designed to guarantee parental rights at the state
and federal levels.

<p>

In its most common form, the Parental Rights Amendment reads:
<I>&quot;The right of parents to direct the upbringing and education
of their children shall not be infringed.&quot;</I> By codifying
language taken directly from the 1925 <I>Pierce</I> case, the
Amendment would provide parents with an explicit right grounded
in their state constitution.

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<center>
<font size=+1><b><i>
The federal parental<br>
rights legislation is<br>
a negative mandate on<br>
government. It checks<br>
power, not enhances it.
</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

A statute designed to protect parental rights has also been
introduced in Congress.  In the fall of 1995, Sen. Charles Grassley
(R-Iowa) and Rep. Steve Largent (R-Okla.) introduced the &quot;Parental
Rights and Responsibilities Act&quot; (PRRA).  The PRRA would
protect parental rights, including directing or providing for
the education of the child; making a health or mental health care
decision for the child; disciplining the child, including reasonable
corporal discipline; and directing or providing for the religious
teaching of the child. The PRRA would clarify the fundamental
nature of parental rights, thus providing much-needed direction
to federal and lower courts.

<p>

The high court in <I>Meyer</I> and <I>Pierce</I> established
that parental rights are fundamental under the liberty interest
of the Fifth and 14th Amendments to the Constitution.  The state
may not infringe a fundamental right without having a compelling
reason to do so.

<p>

In several important cases, however, lower courts have begun
to consider parental rights as less than fundamental, allowing
the state to demonstrate merely a &quot;rational basis&quot; for
infringing the right -- a much lower hurdle to clear.[39] By declining
to review lower court decisions in cases such as <I>Newkirk v.
Lansing, Brown v. Hot, Sexy, and Safer,</I> and <I>Curtis v. Falmouth</I>
-- each of which treated parental rights as less than fundamental
-- the Supreme Court has allowed the rights it enunciated long
ago in <I>Meyer</I> and <I>Pierce</I> to die the proverbial &quot;death
of a thousand cuts.&quot; 

<p>

The PRRA would codify the Supreme Court's longstanding interpretation
of parental rights as a fundamental liberty interest, and would
instruct federal and lower courts to employ the &quot;compelling
interest&quot; test when considering parental rights cases.

<p>

Some have claimed that the Parental Rights and Responsibilities
Act raises federalism concerns.  But by virtue of the rulings
in <I>Meyer, Pierce, Yoder</I> and others, the federal government,
through the Supreme Court, has already acted to protect parental
rights under the due process clause of the 14th Amendment. Congress
is given express authority to enact legislation to protect due
process rights of citizens by Section Five of the 14th Amendment.

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

It is important to remember that federal parental rights legislation
would not give Congress substantive authority over areas which
are properly a matter of state jurisdiction, such as education.
But when state regulation of education results in the violation
of  parents' constitutional rights, the federal government may
intervene to protect these rights.[40]

<p>

The federal parental rights legislation would not expand government
by creating a new federal &quot;program.&quot;  The PRRA would
not increase federal spending or require a new federal administrative
agency. Rather, the PRRA is a <I>negative</I> mandate on government.
It checks power, not enhances it.

<p>

<center><h3>The Fundamental Question: Who Decides?</h3></center>

<p>

Critics of both the federal parental rights bill and the state
constitutional amendments typically claim that parental rights
laws would make it tougher for the state to protect children from
abuse, and would give one parent the right to dictate school curriculum
for everyone else's child, leading to education gridlock.

<p>

These and most other criticisms are grounded in the mistaken
notion that these proposals would provide an <I>absolute</I> right
for parents, which would override any state interest in the welfare
and education of children.  But as both proposals seek to codify
the Meyer-Pierce doctrine, the well-established limits to parental
rights under this doctrine would continue to apply.

<p>

For example, in <I>Prince</I>, the high court made it clear
that &quot;neither the right of religion <I>nor the rights of
parents are beyond limitation</I>&quot; (Emphasis added).
<I>Prince</I> identified numerous areas in which the state may set
limits on parental rights, such as compulsory school attendance,
mandatory vaccination policies, and child labor laws.  And in
<I>Runyon v. McCrary,</I>[41] the Supreme Court held that parents
&quot;have no constitutional right to provide their children with
. . . education unfettered by reasonable government regulation.&quot;
All constitutional rights have their limits, and parental rights
are no exception.

<p>

The clash over parental rights proposals begs the fundamental
question: <I>Who decides what's in the best interests of childen?
Parents? Or the government?</I>  Are ordinary parents generally
competent to raise their children or should parents defer to elite
authorities backed by state power?

<p>

Unable to attack the underlying constitutional doctrine of
parent's rights, yet adamantly opposed to the people acting to
codify this doctrine through the democratic process, opponents
sometimes find themselves in the awkward position best expressed
by Elliot Mincberg, Executive Director of People for the American
Way, in criticizing the state Parental Rights Amendment: &quot;Our
view is that the Amendment is either unnecessary or it would seriously
conflict with the current legal notion of parental rights and
responsibilities.&quot;[42] Presumably, parental rights laws are
&quot;unnecessary&quot; in light of Supreme Court cases, which,
if codified, would be somehow radical and dangerous.

<p>

Other opponents go a step further in making explicit the fact
that parental rights laws are incompatible with the &quot;children's
rights&quot; agenda.  Professor Barbara Bennett Woodhouse of 
the University of Pennsylvania has written that the child should
be seen as &quot;having a direct relationship with government
. . . as public resource and public ward, entitled both to make
claims upon the community and to be claimed by the community.&quot;[43]
Prof. Woodhouse believes that focusing on parents' individual
rights &quot;objectifies&quot; children, and that the law should
concentrate on whether parents have &quot;earned&quot; the authority
they exercise over the child.[44]

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

How might parents &quot;earn&quot; their authority? Perhaps
through government-mandated licensing of parents, as proposed
by Dr. Jack C. Westman, professor of psychiatry at the University
of Wisconsin. &quot;Just as individual responsibility for driving
a car is certified by a driver's license, the individual responsibility
of a parent for child rearing would be certified by a parenting
license.&quot;[45] Requiring parents to obtain a government license
before being allowed to conceive and bear children would complete
the shift from the state acting <I>in loco parentis</I> to the
state <I>as</I> parent. Primary authority over children would
inhere in the state, which would then delegate its authority to
the biological parents of the child -- assuming they pass the
exam.[46]

<p>

<center><h3>Linking Rights and Responsibilities</h3></center>

<p>

If successful, the parental rights movement will provide parents
with greater legal standing to ensure that government respects
their rights through its policies, and, when necessary, in the
courts.  But beyond this immediate, practical benefit, a national
debate on parental rights also has great potential to foster more
parental responsibility.

<p>

The key to encouraging greater parental responsibility is to
explicitly recognize the link between rights and duties upon which
this nation was founded, and to renew our optimism in the ability
of the people to manage their own affairs, as citizens and as
parents.  Indeed, &quot;the most terribly important things must
be left to ordinary men themselves,&quot; including the right
of parents to protect their children from harmful influences and
to direct their children's upbringing.  Recognizing the irreplaceable
role of parents is essential to keeping the power of the state
in check, revitalizing citizenship, and ensuring that children
receive the love, protection and guidance only a parent can provide.

<li>&quot;Formal high school education
beyond the eighth grade is contrary to Amish beliefs, not only
because it places Amish children in an environment hostile to
Amish beliefs with increasing emphasis on competition in class
work and sports and with pressure to conform to the styles, manners,
and ways of the peer group, but also because it takes them away
from their community, physically and emotionally, during the crucial
and formative adolescent period of life. . . . Amish society emphasizes
informal learning-though-doing; a life of 'goodness,'
rather than a life of intellect; wisdom, rather than technical
knowledge; community welfare, rather than competition; and separation
from, rather than integration with, contemporary worldly society.&quot;

<li>Justice Douglas' dissent in <I>Yoder</I> hints at the changes in 
the parent-child-state relationship to come: &quot;If the parents in 
this case are allowed a religious exemption, the inevitable effect is 
to impose the parents' notions of religious duty upon their children. 
Where the child is mature enough to express potentially conflicting
desires, it would be an invasion of the child's rights to permit
such an imposition without canvassing his views.  And, if an Amish
child desires to attend high school, and is mature enough to have
that desire respected, the State may well be able to override
the parents' religiously motivated objections.&quot; <I>Yoder</I>,

<title>SPARE THE ROD? NEW RESEARCH CHALLENGES SPANKING CRITICS</title>

<h1>Spare the Rod?</h1>
<h2><i>New Research Challenges Spanking Critics</i></h2>

</center>

<p>

<font size=+3>O</font>pposition to parents spanking their children has been 
growing significantly in elite circles over the past 15 years.[1] No doubt
much of this opposition springs from a sincere concern for the
well-being of children. Child abuse is a reality, and stories
of child abuse are horrifying. But while loving and effective
discipline is quite definitely <I>not</I> harsh and abusive, neither
is it weak and ineffectual. Indeed, disciplinary spanking can
fall well within the boundaries of loving discipline and need
not be labeled abusive violence.[2]

<p>

Or so most Americans seem to think.  According to a recent
Voter/Consumer Research poll commissioned by the Family Research
Council, 76 percent of the more than 1,000 Americans surveyed
said that spanking was an effective form of discipline in their
home when they were children.[3] These results are made all the
more impressive by the fact that nearly half of those who answered
otherwise grew up in homes in which they were never spanked.
Taken together, more than four out of five Americans who were
actually spanked by their parents as children say that it was
an effective form of discipline.

<p>

In addition, Americans perceive lack of discipline to be
the biggest problem in public education today, according to a
recent Gallup poll.[4] Several studies show strong public support
for corporal punishment by parents.[5]

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

Critics claim that spanking a child is abusive and contributes
to adult dysfunction.  These allegations arise from studies that
fail to distinguish appropriate spanking from other forms of punishment.
Abusive forms of physical punishment such as kicking, punching,
and beating are commonly grouped with mild spanking.  Furthermore,
the studies usually include, and even emphasize, corporal punishment
of adolescents, rather than focusing on preschool children, where
spanking is more effective.  This blurring of distinctions between
spanking and physical abuse, and between children of different
ages, gives critics the illusion of having data condemning all
disciplinary spanking.

<p>

There are several arguments commonly leveled against disciplinary
spanking.  Interestingly, most of these arguments can be used
against other forms of discipline.  Any form of discipline (time-out,
restriction, etc.), when used inappropriately and in anger, can
result in distorting a child's perception of justice and harming
his emotional development.  In light of this, let us examine
some of the unfounded arguments promoted by spanking opponents.

<p>

<b>Argument #1:</b> <i>Many psychological studies show that spanking
is an improper form of discipline.</i>

<p>

<b>Counterpoint:</b> Researchers John Lyons, Rachel Anderson
and David Larson of the National Institute of Healthcare Research
recently conducted a systematic review of the research literature
on corporal punishment.[6] They found that 83 percent of the 132
identified articles published in clinical and psychosocial journals
were merely opinion-driven editorials, reviews or commentaries,
devoid of new empirical findings.  Moreover, most of the empirical
studies were methodologically flawed by grouping the impact of
abuse with spanking.  The best studies demonstrated beneficial,
not detrimental, effects of spanking in certain situations.  Clearly,
there is insufficient evidence to condemn parental spanking and
adequate evidence to justify its proper use.

<p>

<b>Argument #2:</b> <i>Physical punishment establishes the moral
righteousness of hitting other persons who do something which
is regarded as wrong.</i>

<p>

<b>Counterpoint:</b> The &quot;spanking teaches hitting&quot;
belief has gained in popularity over the past decade, but is not
supported by objective evidence.  A distinction must be made between
abusive hitting and nonabusive spanking.  A child's ability to
discriminate hitting from disciplinary spanking depends largely
upon the parents' attitude with spanking and the parents' procedure
for spanking.  There is no evidence in the medical literature
that a mild spank to the buttocks of a disobedient child by a
loving parent teaches the child aggressive behavior.

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<center>
<font size=+1><b><i>
The critical issue is<br>
how spanking is used<br>
more than whether it<br>
is used.
</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

The critical issue is <I>how</I> spanking (or, in fact, any
punishment) is used more so than <I>whether</I> it is used.  Physical
abuse by an angry, uncontrolled parent will leave lasting emotional
wounds and cultivate bitterness and resentment within a child.
The balanced, prudent use of disciplinary spanking, however,
is an effective deterrent to aggressive behavior with some children.

<p>

Researchers at the Center for Family Research at Iowa State
University studied 332 families to examine both the impact of
corporal punishment and the quality of parental involvement on
three adolescent outcomes -- aggressiveness, delinquency, and
psychological well-being.  The researchers found a strong association
between the quality of parenting and each of these three outcomes.
Corporal  punishment, however, was <I>not</I> adversely related
to any of these outcomes.  This study proves the point that quality
of parenting is the chief determinant of favorable or unfavorable
outcomes.[7] Remarkably, childhood aggressiveness has been more
closely linked to maternal permissiveness and negative criticism
than to even abusive physical discipline.[8]

<p>

It is unrealistic to expect that children would never hit
others if their parents would only exclude spanking from their
discipline options.  Most children in their toddler years (long
before they are ever spanked) naturally attempt to hit others
when conflict or frustration arises.  The continuation of this
behavior is largely determined by how the parent or caregiver
responds. If correctly disciplined, the hitting will become less
frequent. If ignored or ineffectively disciplined, the hitting
will likely persist and even escalate.  Thus, instead of contributing
to greater violence, spanking can be a useful component in an
overall plan to effectively teach a child to stop aggressive hitting.

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<b>Argument #3:</b> <i>Since parents often refrain from hitting
until the anger or frustration reaches a certain point, the child
learns that anger and frustration justify the use of physical
force.</i>

<p>

<b>Counterpoint:</b> A study published in <I>Pediatrics</I> indicates
that most parents who spank do not spank on impulse, but purposefully
spank their children with a belief in its effectiveness.[9] Furthermore,
the study revealed no significant correlation between the frequency
of spanking and the anger reported by mothers.  Actually, the
mothers who reported being angry were not the same parents who
spanked.

<p>

Reactive, impulsive hitting after losing control due to anger
is unquestionably the wrong way for a parent to use corporal punishment.
Eliminating all physical punishment in the home, however, would
not remedy such explosive scenarios.  It could even increase the
problem.  When effective spanking is removed from a parent's disciplinary
repertoire, he or she is left with nagging, begging, belittling,
and yelling, once the primary disciplinary measures -- such as time-out
and logical consequences -- have failed.  By contrast, if proper
spanking is proactively used in conjunction with other disciplinary
measures, better control of the particularly defiant child can
be achieved, and moments of exasperation are less likely to occur.

</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<b>Argument #4:</b> <i>Physical punishment is harmful to a child.</i>

<p>

<b>Counterpoint:</b> Any disciplinary measure, physical, verbal
or emotional, carried to an extreme can harm a child.  Excessive
scolding and berating of a child by a parent is emotionally harmful.
Excessive use of isolation (time-out) for unreasonable periods
of time can humiliate a child and ruin the measure's effectiveness.
Obviously, excessive or indiscriminate physical punishment is
harmful and abusive.  However, an appropriately-administered spanking
of a forewarned disobedient child is not harmful when administered
in a loving controlled manner.

<p>

Without the prudent use of spanking for the particularly
defiant child, a parent runs the risk of being inconsistent and
rationalizing the child's behavior.  This inconsistent manner
of  parenting is confusing and harmful to the child and is damaging
to the parent-child relationship.  There is no evidence that proper
disciplinary spanking is harmful to the child.

<p>

<b>Argument #5:</b> <i>Physical punishment makes the child angry
at the parent.</i>

<p>

<b>Counterpoint:</b> All forms of punishment initially elicit
a frustrated, angry response from a child.  Progression of this
anger is dependent primarily upon the parent's attitude during
and after the disciplinary event, and the manner of its application.
Any form of punishment administered angrily for purposes of retribution,
rather than calmly for purposes of correction, can create anger
and resentment in a child.  Actually, a spanking can break the
escalating rage of a rebellious child and more quickly restore
the relationship between parent and child.

<font size=+1><b><i>
The use of the term<br>
'violence' in the<br>
spanking debate only<br>
serves to deepen the<br>
confusion.
</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<b>Argument #6:</b> <i>Spanking teaches a child that &quot;might
makes right,&quot; that power and strength are most important
and that the biggest can force their will upon the smallest.</i>

<p>

<b>Counterpoint:</b> Parental power is commonly exerted in routine
child rearing and spanking is only one example.  Other situations
where power and restraint are exercised by the average parent
include:

<p><ul>

<li>The young child who insists on running from his parent in
a busy mall or parking lot.

<p>

<li>The toddler who refuses to sit in his car seat.

<p>

<li>The young patient who refuses to hold still as a vaccination
is administered, or as a laceration is repaired.

</ul><p>

Power and control over the child are necessary at times to
ensure safety, health and proper behavior. Classic child rearing
studies have shown that some degree of power, assertion,[10] and firm
control[11] is essential for optimal child rearing. When power is
exerted in the context of love and for the child's benefit, the
child will not perceive it as bullying or demeaning.

<h2>A CLOSER LOOK</h2>

<p><hr width=60% noshade><p>

<h2>Distinguishing Spanking from Abuse</h2>

</center>

<p>

<font size=+3>C</font>orporal punishment is often defined broadly as 
<i>bodily punishment of any kind.</i> Since this definition includes 
spanking as well as obviously abusive acts such as kicking, punching, 
beating, face slapping, and even starvation, more specific definitions
must be used to separate appropriate versus inappropriate corporal
punishment.

<p>

Spanking is one of many disciplinary responses available
to parents intended to shape appropriate behavior in the developing
toddler and child.  It is an adjunctive corrective measure, to
be used in combination with primary responses such as restraint,
natural and logical consequences, time-out, and restriction of
privileges.

<p>

Child development experts believe spanking should be used
mainly as a back-up to primary measures, and then independently
to correct deliberate and persistent problem behavior that is
not remedied with milder measures.  It is most useful with toddlers
and preschoolers from 18 months to 6 years of age, when reasoning
is less persuasive.

<p>

Moreover, child development experts say that spanking should
always be a planned action by a parent, not an impulsive reaction
to misbehavior.  The child should be forewarned of the spanking
consequence for each of the designated problem behaviors.  Spanking
should always be administered in private. It should consist of
one or two spanks to the child's buttocks, followed by a calm
review of the offense and the desired behavior.

</pre>

</center>

<p><hr><p>

<b>Argument #7:</b> <i>Spanking is violence.</i>

<p>

<b>Counterpoint:</b> Spanking, as recommended by most primary
care physicians,[12] is not violence by definition (&quot;exertion
of physical force so as to injure or abuse&quot;).[13] Parents who
properly spank do not injure or abuse their child.

<p>

The use of this term &quot;violence&quot; in the spanking
debate only serves to deepen the confusion.  Why do anti-spanking
authors repeatedly fail to distinguish between abusive violence
and mild spanking?  The distinction is so fundamental and obvious
that its omission suggests that these authors use such terminology
for its propaganda value, not to clarify issues.

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<b>Argument #8:</b> <i>Spanking is an ineffective solution to
misbehavior.</i>

<p>

<b>Counterpoint:</b> Though the specific use of appropriate spanking
has rarely been studied, there is evidence of its short-term and
long-term effectiveness. When combined with reasoning, the use
of negative consequences (including spanking) does effectively
decrease the frequency of misbehavior recurrences with preschool
children.[14] In clinical field trials where parental spanking has
been studied, it has consistently been found to reduce the subsequent
frequency of noncompliance with time-out.[15] Spanking, as a effective
enforcer of time-out, is a component of several well-researched
parent training programs[16] and popular parenting texts.[17]

<p>

Dr. Diana Baumrind of the Institute for Human Development
at the University of California-Berkeley, conducted a decade-long
study of families with children 3 to 9 years old.[18]
Baumrind found that parents employing a balanced disciplinary
style of firm control (including spanking) and positive encouragement
experienced the most favorable outcome in their children. Parents
taking extreme approaches to discipline (authoritarian-types using
excessive punishment with less encouragement or permissive-types
using little punishment and no spanking) were less successful.

<p>

Baumrind concluded that evidence from this study &quot;did
not indicate that negative reinforcement or corporal punishment
per se were harmful or ineffective procedures, but rather the
total patterns of parental control determined the effects on the
child of these procedures.&quot;

<p>

This approach of balanced parenting, employing the occasional
use of spanking, is advocated by several child rearing experts.[19]
In the hands of loving parents, a spanking to the buttocks of
a defiant toddler in appropriate settings is a powerful motivator
to correct behavior and an effective deterrent to disobedience.

<p>

<b>Argument #9:</b> <i>Adults who were spanked as children are
at risk for using violence as a means of resolving conflicts as
adults.</i>

<p>

<b>Counterpoint:</b> This theory comes from work done by Murray
Straus of the Family Research Lab at the University of New Hampshire.
Straus' conclusions are based upon theoretical models and survey
results of adults recalling spankings as teenagers. His work
is not clinical research, and many experts believe that his conclusions
go far beyond his data.  As with most of Straus' survey research,
teenage spanking is the focus, not the selective use of spanking
of young children by reasonable parents. The evidence for his
conclusion disappears when parental spanking is measured between
the ages of 2 and 8 years, and when childhood aggression is measured
at a later age.

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

In a 1994 review article on corporal punishment, Dr. Robert
E. Larzelere, a director of research at Boys Town, Nebraska, presents
evidence supporting a parent's selective use of spanking of children,
particularly those 2 to 6 years old.[20] After thoroughly reviewing
the literature, Larzelere concludes that any association between
spanking and antisocial aggressiveness in children is insignificant
and artifactual.

<p>

After a decade of longitudinal study of children beginning
in third grade, Dr. Leonard Eron found no association between
punishment (including spanking) and later aggression.  Eron, a
clinical psychologist at the Univeristy of Michigan's Institute
for Social Research, concluded, &quot;Upon follow-up 10 years
after the original data collection, we found that punishment of
aggressive acts at the earlier age was no longer related to current
aggression, and instead, other variables like parental nurturance
and children's identification with their parents were more important
in predicting later aggression.&quot;[21]

</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

Again, it is the total pattern of parenting that determines the
outcome of a parent's efforts.

<p>

<b>Argument #10:</b> <i>Spanking leads a parent to use harmful
forms of corporal punishment which lead to physical child abuse.</i>

<p>

<b>Counterpoint:</b> The abuse potential when loving parents
use appropriate disciplinary spanking is very low.  Since parents
have a natural affection for their children, they are more prone
to underutilize spanking than to overutilize it.  Both empirical
data and professional opinion oppose the concept of a causal relationship
between spanking and child abuse.

<p>

Surveys indicate that 70 to 90 percent of parents of preschoolers
use spanking,[22] yet the incidence of physical child abuse in
America is only about 5 percent. Statistically, the two practices
are far apart. Furthermore, over the past decade reports of child
abuse have steadily risen while approval for parental spanking
has steadily declined.[23]

<p>

More than 70 percent of primary care pediatricians reject
the idea that spanking sets the stage for parents to engage in
forms of physical abuse.[24]

<p>

Teaching parents appropriate spanking may actually reduce
child abuse, according to Larzelere, in his 1994 review article
on corporal punishment.[25] Parents who are ill-equipped to control
their child's behavior, or who take a more permissive approach
(refusing to use spanking), may be more prone to anger[26] and explosive
attacks on their child.[27]

<p>

Parental child abuse is an interactive process involving
parental competence, parental and child temperaments, and situational
demands.[28] Abusive parents are more angry, depressed and impulsive,
and emphasize punishment as the predominant means of discipline.
Abused children are more aggressive and less compliant than children
from nonabusive families. There is less interaction between family
members in abusive families and abusive mothers display more negative
than positive behavior. The etiology of abusive parenting is
multifactorial with emphasis on the personalities involved, and
cannot be simply explained by a parent's use of spanking.

<p>

In a letter to the editor in a 1995 issue of <I>Pediatrics</I>,
Drs. Lawrence S. Wissow and Debra Roter of Johns Hopkins University's
pediatrics department acknowledge that a definitive link between
spanking and child abuse has yet to be established.[29]

<p>

Finally, the Swedish experiment to reduce child abuse by
banning spanking seems to be failing.  In 1980, one year after
this ban was adopted, the rate of child beatings was twice that
of the United States.[30] According to a 1995 report from the government
organization Statistics Sweden, police reports of child abuse
by family members rose four-fold from 1984 to 1994, while reports
of teen violence increased nearly six-fold.[31]

</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

Most experts agree that spanking and child abuse are not
on the same continuum, but are very different entities.  With
parenting, it is the &quot;user&quot; and <I>how</I> a measure
is used much more than the measure used that determines the outcome
of the disciplinary effort.  Clearly, spanking can be safely used
in the discipline of young children with an excellent outcome.
The proper use of spanking may actually reduce a parent's risk
of abusing the child.

<p>

<b>Argument #11:</b> <i>Spanking is never necessary.</i>

<p>

<b>Counterpoint:</b> All children need a combination of encouragement
and correction as they are disciplined to become socially responsible
individuals. In order for correction to deter disobedient behavior,
the consequence imposed upon the child must outweigh the pleasure
of the disobedient act. For very compliant children, milder forms
of correction will suffice and spanking may never be necessary.
For more defiant children who refuse to comply with or be persuaded
by milder consequences such as time-out, spanking is useful, effective,
and appropriate.

<center><h3>Conclusion</h3></center>

<p>

The subject of disciplinary spanking should be evaluated
from a factual and philosophical perspective. It must be distinguished
from abusive, harmful forms of corporal punishment. Appropriate
disciplinary spanking can play an important role in optimal child
development, and has been found in prospective studies to be a
part of the parenting style associated with the best outcomes.
There is no evidence that mild spanking is harmful. Indeed,
spanking is supported by history, research, and a majority of
primary care physicians.

<h2>Guidelines for Disciplinary Spanking</h2>

</center>

<p>

<font size=+3>T</font>he following are guidelines that Dr. Den Trumball 
has used to advise the parents he serves in disciplining children. 
These guidelines should help policymakers appreciate the legitimacy
of disciplinary spanking.

<p>

1. Spanking should be used selectively for clear, deliberate
misbehavior, particularly that which arises from a child's persistent
defiance of a parent's instruction.  It should be used only when
the child receives at least as much encouragement and praise for
good behavior as correction for problem behavior.

<p>

2. Milder forms of discipline, such as verbal correction,
time-out, and logical consequences, should be used initially,
followed by spanking when noncompliance persists.  Spanking has
shown to be an effective method of enforcing time-out with the
child who refuses to comply.

<p>

3. Only a parent (or in exceptional situations, someone else
who has an intimate relationship of authority with the child)
should administer a spanking.

<p>

4. Spanking should not be administered on impulse or when a parent
is out of control.  A spanking should always be motivated by love
for the purpose of teaching and correcting, never for revenge.

<p>

5. Spanking is inappropriate before 15 months of age and is usually
not necessary until after 18 months.  It should be less necessary
after 6 years, and rarely, if ever, used after 10 years of age.

<p>

6. After 10 months of age, one slap to the hand of a stubborn
crawler or toddler may be necessary to stop serious misbehavior
when distraction and removal have failed.  This is particularly
the case when the forbidden object is immovable and dangerous,
such as a hot oven door or an electrical outlet.

<p>

7. Spanking should always be a planned action, not a reaction,
by the parent and should follow a deliberate procedure.

<p><ul>

<li>The child should be forewarned of the spanking consequence
for designated problem behaviors.

<p>

<li>Spanking should always be administered in private (bedroom
or restroom) to avoid public humiliation or embarassment.

<p>

<li>One or two spanks should be administered to the buttocks.
This is followed by embracing the child and calmly reviewing
the offense and the desired behavior in an effort to reestablish
a warm relationship.

</ul><p>

8. Spanking should leave only transient redness of the skin and
should never cause physical injury.

<p>

9. If properly administered spankings are ineffective, other
appropriate disciplinary responses should be tried, or the parent
should seek professional help. Parents should never increase
the intensity of spankings.

<title>Teens, big business and the politics of sex</title>
<body>
<p>
<center><h2>Teens, big business and the politics of sex</h2></center>
<p>
<h4>There's a lot at stake in hyped figures about teen's sexual
activity, but millions of virgins are alive and well out there,
too.</h4>
<p>
&quot;Hello, Family Research Council?  I'm a producer
for the noon and 9 <i>News on 10 </i>- network affiliate and all
that - and I'm looking for a virgin.&quot;
<p>
&quot;A virgin?&quot;
<p>
&quot;Yes, we heard that you might know one, if you can believe
this - ah, one that's over 18 and, ah, never had any intercourse.
<p>
&quot;We like to do television on oddities.  You know the format,
satanist accountants and IRS audit trend lines...the missing link
in Manhattan...
<p>
 &quot;And we heard that there were actually people claiming to
be virgins.  We though that went out in 1952 with a woman in Montana
named Ethel.&quot;
<p>
 A lot of people are &quot;discovering&quot; virginity as the
new minority class, thanks to the efforts of people like Rep.
Pat Schroeder, D-Colo., and her associates, who are working hard
to convince Americans that 80% of teens are actively engaged in
sex and pursuing many alternative lifestyles.
<p>
 In mid-April, the committee Schroeder controls in the House called
the federal government's response to rampant teen bed-hopping
a national tragedy. 
<p>
 But the tragedy is that sexual politics is big business in Washington.
<p>
 Schroeder's committee whipped up the 80% figure by adding 20-year-olds
into the mix. 
<p>
 In fact, a study by the Department of Health and Human Services
found that among girls under age 18, almost 65% were virgins.
 In ages 15-19 (a group said to be swarming to the bedroom), almost
50% were still waiting.
<p>
 But while the pro-abortion lobby's numbers are bad, their political
logic is good.  And it will cost taxpayers.  Financial self-interest
is one reason that groups like Planned Parenthood and their patron
saint of federal funding publish inflated numbers.  It's a simple
political formula:
<p>
 A + B = C.
<p>
If most kids have sex - A.<br>
And my programs deal with sexual issues - B.<br>
Then my program needs more tax dollars - C.<br>
<p>
 For all their alleged interest in health, abortion activists
and their business counterparts make hundreds of millions of dollars
annually from the government.
<p>
 Take Planned Parenthood, for example.  According to a 1990 report
in a philanthropic journal, $273 million of the group's $370 million
budget came from public sources.
<p>
 Logic would argue that it's in the abortion lobby's interest
to justify its existence to the governmental overseers who provide
over 70% of their budget.
<p>
 Schroeder's real interests can be clearly seen at budget time.
 In the last cycle, while $150 million went to Title X, the federal
government's contraceptive program, Schroeder fought to kill the
$7.8 million that went to Title XX.  Two-thirds of Title XX goes
to teen parenting and care programs, while the remainder goes
to the only abstinence-based sexual education program in 
the federal budget. 
<p>
 One would think Pat and Planned parenthood would talk constantly
about abstinence - the best way to avoid sexually transmitted
disease and pregnancy.  But if kids really &quot;just said no&quot;
to sex, their golden goose would be cooked.
<p>
 Every day, I talk with people amazed to discover that virgins
are alive and well in North America.  The vast majority of teen-agers
are waiting to have sexual intercourse.  And many others, after
limited experience, choose a lifestyle of abstinence.
<p>
 But don't be surprised that their stories go untold or run as
brief mention under oddities.  The real story behind sexual politics
can be found on an accountant's spread sheet.

<h3>HUD:  BACK TO THE DRAWING BOARD</h3>

By <br><a href="/townhall/columnists/schatz.html"> Thomas A. Schatz </a><p>
<hr></center>
It is heartening to hear Congress is considering the elimination of the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).  It is heartening to see that someone in Washington has figured out that 
Washington does not have all the answers and it is time to try something else.<p> 
HUD was created in 1965 out of several federal agencies concerned with housing, mortgage finance and urban issues.  HUD was formed to address an emerging urban crisis and a growing underclass, subject to squalid housing conditions, crime, unemployment, eroding families and limited educational achievement.<p>   
As originally conceived, HUD was an integral part of the "War on Poverty," which to date has cost $5 trillion.  Our urban problems have not markedly improved during the 30-year war, and many would argue that conditions have grown worse.  Life in the roughest parts of our cities is similar to Hobbes' state of nature:  nasty, brutish and short!  <p> 
Since the $8 billion HUD scandal in 1989, the words "financial mismanagement" and HUD have become synonymous.  In 1984, the Grace Commission warned of financial disasters stemming from HUD's fundamental flaw.  According to the Grace Commission, HUD is "a financial institution with a social mission," and the emphasis on its social goals "resulted in a higher priority on program execution at the expense of the internal management requirements normally associated with a financial institution."  Sound financial management is secondary to spending. <p>   
Since 1990, HUD has been featured prominently in the Office of Management and Budget's (OMB) "high risk" program, which lists by department the federal government's fundamental financial management weaknesses.  HUD's financial management systems for monitoring low-income housing assistance are so bad that HUD cannot assure taxpayers that their taxes are used for eligible recipients, or that there is adequate fund control for more than $100 billion in long-term contractual funding serving 3 million families.  The Federal Housing Administration's (FHA) insurance fund for single family housing loans may not be sufficient to cover losses.  Currently, FHA has in force $303 billion of insurance, but it may not be able to pay potential claims without seeking higher appropriations from Congress.  Also cited are 106 Public Housing Authorities (PHA), accounting for 17 percent of all PHA housing units, which have been identified as troubled.  Taxpayers cannot be "assured that public housing funds achieve intended purposes."  PHAs administer more than half of HUD's budget.   <p>
Not only is HUD wasteful and ineffective, it is a financial liability.  Any private corporation in the position of the federal government would have done something about the department long ago.<p> 
HUD's failure to resolve its 30-year internal conflict between its role as a financial institution and its social goals has prompted freshmen House Republicans, led by Representatives Sam Brownback (R-
Kan.) and Sue Myrick (R-N.C.), and a Senate task force, chaired by Senators Lauch Faircloth (R-N.C.) and Spencer Abraham (R-Mich.), to recommend HUD's elimination. <p>  
The recently released House bill, known as "The Federal Housing Reform and Local Empowerment Act," proposes to replace the existing public housing and housing assistance with a voucher program to be administered by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).  Under the proposal, state governments are given the options of participating in the HHS program, running their own voucher program, or setting up their own public housing program.  The Congressional Budget Office estimates that this would save $17 billion in budget authority over five years. <p>
The bill also consolidates many of HUD's programs into two block grant programs:  the Housing and Development Block Grant and the Special Populations Block Grant, both of which will be administered by HHS.  Other programs will either be eliminated, transferred to other government agencies, or privatized. <p>
Earlier this year, the Administration recognized that something had to be done to save HUD from the scalpels of Republican budget hawks.  As part of the vice president's reinvention program, HUD Secretary Henry Cisneros laid out the administration's strategy for saving the department.  Cisneros proposed consolidating 60 HUD programs into three community and housing funds, creating a voucher system for public housing, and converting FHA into a government-owned corporation 
to reduce costs.  According to OMB, the administration's proposal would save $770 million over five years.  That's less than five percent of the savings from the congressional reform bill. <p>
The "reinvention strategy," which has become a trademark of the Clinton administration, is an attempt to protect favorite programs and departments from budget cuts and taxpayer criticism, under the guise 
of improving the federal bureaucracy.  For the Clinton administration, reinvention substitutes for true reform.  More often than not, the rhetoric of reinvention has become an argument for the status quo and 
an assurance to special interests that business-as-usual can continue.<p>     
This rearguard action was recently rejected by former HUD Secretary Jack Kemp, who said that the "American people do not want to reinvent government, they want to reduce it."  He added that taxpayers, "[D]on't want to manage the bureaucracy better, they want to shrink the bureaucracy.  And they don't want people dependent upon government, they want people empowered." <p>
HUD has had its 30-year trial run.   It failed.   It's time to downsize, devolve, privatize and terminate HUD.

<b>President, Citizens Against Government Waste By:  Thomas A. Schatz</b>
<p> 
Much of the nation has been under the oppressive grip of a heat wave with temperatures exceeding 100 degrees.  These sweltering days of summer are no match for the oppressive burden of federal regulations that have gripped the nation for years.  Come October, the cool fall air will replace the stagnant heat, but unnecessary and ridiculous federal regulations will continue to cost American taxpayers nearly $600 billion per year. 
<p>
In its unrelenting leadership role, the House of Representatives is actively trying to get rid of burdensome regulations and return the nation to common sense and fiscal freedom.  The Regulatory Reform Bill, which was signed on February 24, 1995, allows property owners to seek compensation when a federal regulatory action has taken place and improves the process by which federal regulations are developed and 
issued.   
<p>
House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) again took on ridiculous regulations when he proposed "Corrections Days" earlier this year.  Corrections Days, which passed with a vote of 271 to 146 on June 20, 1995, is a mechanism to streamline the termination of silly regulations.  The House will be holding corrections days twice a month.  Among the many targets for corrections is the repeal of a provision that places costly safety requirements on ships carrying vegetable oil into or out of U.S. waters, even though the oil, if spilled, poses no threat to the environment or public health; and a federal rule barring the removal of trees surrounding an airport for safety purposes if those trees are in a wetland. 
<p>
In its first session of corrections on July 25, 1995, the House voted 269 to 156 to exempt San Diego, California from a water pollution regulation that would require the city to build a $2 billion sewage treatment plant.  Critics of the plant contend that discharging sewage into the Pacific Ocean four miles offshore would not affect sea-life 
and in some instances would benefit marine life.  This is an important first step in trying to bring the federal regulation leviathan under control.   
<p>
As the House catapults ahead with serious regulatory reform, the Senate has once again lagged behind.  Senate Majority Leader Robert Dole (R-Kansas) set aside the GOP-sponsored regulatory reform bill on July 18, 1995, because of lack of support.  Senator Dole is unsure when and if the bill will ever come up for consideration in the 
Senate.  The Senate is too timid to attack the voracious appetite of federal regulations. 
<p>
Regulation reform is not an esoteric or vague concept.  Regulations affect everybody.  Government regulation dramatically increases the cost of doing business, which results in fewer jobs and lower salaries, and makes U.S. companies less competitive. 
<p>
Regulations extend their claws into all sectors of society including food and medicine, the environment, and the Department of the Interior (DOI). 
<p>
Probably the most powerful regulatory agency in the entire federal government is the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).   The expansion of the FDA is unparalleled in the federal government.  Growing from 4,470 employees in 1970, with a budget of $227 million, the FDA currently has 9,217 employees at a cost of $764 million.  This is a 106-percent increase in employees and a 237- percent increase in budget.  The FDA approves more regulations rather than drugs.  Drug approval averages 12 years and $359 million per drug.  The cost of this excessive regulation is passed on to the consumer at approximately 25 cents per dollar.  Critically needed drugs are delayed incessantly because of excessive regulations. 
<p>
The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is notorious for its overzealousness in regulating.  Initially established in 1970 to combat a real and growing pollution problem, the EPA has turned into a monolithic regulating monster.  Evidence of such heavy-handed regulations include a Pennsylvania couple being threatened with 
polluting a waterway by installing a tennis court on their land; a couple in New York being fined $30,000 for building a deck on their house because, among other things, it cast a shadow on a wetland;  and an auto parts store owner being fined $10,000 because he didn't post a sign, which was down because of window washing, stating that his store accepts waste motor oil for recycling.  Micro- managing the 
environment instead of fighting pollution is the new mission of the EPA. 
<p>
DOI weighs in with its own stupid and environmentally unsound practice of micro management.  The Endangered Species Act (ESA) and the National Biological Survey (NBS) are examples of the DOI's misguided policies.  The ESA causes hardships for private property owners, businesses, and developers; it confers enormous power on unaccountable bureaucrats; and is costly to U.S taxpayers.   
<p>
The ESA has listed 853 species to be protected, while some 4,000 other plants and animals are official candidates for future listings.  According to Maura Dolans of the Los Angeles Times, blunders by the Fish and Wildlife Service may have contributed to an extinction.  The Service spent nearly $3 million  to buy a Florida habitat for the endangered dusky seaside sparrow -- and then neglected to manage the land properly.  The last bird died in 1987. 
<p>
The NBS was created to catalogue everything that walks, crawls, swims or flies around this country on public or private lands.  Critics say that the program will take years to complete, involve thousands of government scientists, and would clash with private property rights.  Because an area was designated under the NBS as a wilderness area, a lost Boy Scout was not rescued in a timely manner.  A rescue 
helicopter was not allowed to land in a sensitive area.  A note had to be dropped to the child.  The Boy Scout was eventually rescued by a second helicopter when the search party failed to find him. 
<p>
Needless regulations are shortsighted and stupid.  Some may seem humorous, but all are serious.  The increased presence of federal regulations erode away personal freedoms as well as our bank accounts.  The federal government should be for the people not against the people. 
<p>

<h2>Tales From the Gypped</h2>


By<br><a href="/townhall/columnists/schatz.html"> Thomas A. Schatz</a><p>
</center><hr>
<br>
Medicare reform will be among Congress' top priorities after the  
August recess.  Those who are fighting any reform, their message is  
that each dollar spent in the program produces a dollar in benefits  
for America's seniors.  Nothing could be further from the truth. <p> 
The Medicare program is a sitting duck for con artists, thieves, and  
degreed opportunists.   Because of its size, diabolical complexity and  
lax management practices, this $177 billion leviathan has become the  
equivalent of a Gucci-clad matron sauntering down the street sporting  
a flashing neon sign that says "please rob me!"  Those with a notion  
to defraud Medicare know that these three factors alone guarantee that  
the risks of gaming the system are worth taking because Medicare is  
where the easy money is.<p>
In fiscal year 1993, Medicare processed almost 700 million claims.   
That's nearly 2 million per day, about 250 million more than it  
processed five years earlier, and nearly six times the number of tax  
returns processed by the Internal Revenue Service.  Physicians, supply  
companies, or diagnostic laboratories have about three chances out of  
1,000 of having Medicare audit their billing practices in any given  
year.<p>
Medicare fraud is perpetrated by billing companies, providers,  
suppliers, even organized crime and drug dealers.  There are scams  
involving kickbacks, durable medical equipment, prescription  
marketing, nursing homes and home care providers, tampered medical  
supplies, ambulance and taxi services.  Medicare fraud is as varied as  
the imaginations of the criminals who game the system.  Citizens  
Against Government Waste's (CAGW) new report, Medicare Fraud: Tales  
from the Gypped, details more than one hundred examples.<p>  
Unless you've been away on the space shuttle, you surely are aware of  
the litany of waste that plagues the program.  But individual examples  
don't give the full picture.  It is heart-stopping.   At least ten  
percent, or $17 billion each year, in Medicare spending is irrevocably  
squandered.  That 10 percent is also, coincidentally, the annual  
growth rate that is leading the program to bankruptcy over the next  
several years.<p>  
Here are just a few of the countless examples:<p>     
** Several Michigan pharmacists obtained large supplies of expired  
drugs and dispensed them to nursing home patients, at full cost to  
Medicare.  One of the pharmacists who participated in the scheme  
quipped, "those people are old, they'll never know the difference, and  
they'll be dead soon anyway." <p> 
** A pharmaceutical salesman peddled $6 million in expired,  
mislabeled, unsterile, or second-hand pacemakers over an eight-year  
period, sometimes providing Hawaiian vacations or prostitutes as  
kickbacks to cardiologists who agreed to implant the adulterated  
devices in unsuspecting patients.  In his offices, authorities found  
"a number of bloody pacemakers, raising suspicions he was reselling  
devices surgically removed from other patients or even from corpses." <p> 
** In Florida, more than a dozen companies, claiming to supply  
Medicare patients with liquid nutritional supplements and feeding  
kits, defrauded Medicare of an estimated $20 million.  The "kingpin"  
of the scheme fled the country, but was found in Venezuela and  
extradited. <p> 
** A company in New York lured Medicare beneficiaries into disclosing  
their Medicare identification numbers in exchange for microwave ovens,  
air conditioners, or angora underwear.   <p>
** A Georgia health-care company is under investigation for allegedly  
pocketing more than $14 million in illegally obtained Medicare funds.   
Money allegedly went toward golf-course memberships, vacations, a new  
car for the CEO's son, $9.7 million for computer software, $84,341 for  
gourmet popcorn, and $18,600 for lobbying activities.  <p>
** A California supply company billed Medicare for $5 million worth of  
surgical dressings for patients who never underwent surgery. <p> 
There is no doubt that Medicare is in crisis.  We've heard from  
Medicare's Public Trustees that the program is faltering.  This year,  
the trustees have given us a date certain for Medicare's impending  
demise if its current rate of spending is not reduced: 2002.  They've  
told us that if we don't act today, never mind the long-range affect  
on baby boomers and their children, our parents and grandparents, who  
currently receive benefits, will be cut off in just seven years. <p>   
Rhetoric and denial are the postures of choice in Washington.  Some  
members of Congress, along with their outside supporters, claim there  
is no crisis.  Others argue that the federal government will never let  
the system run out of money, as if the American taxpayer is a never- 
ending source of cash for this out-of-control program.  And then there  
are those, like Minority Leader Richard Gephardt (D-Mo.), who can't  
resist the easy politics of intergenerational fear-mongering.    <p>
But Republican attention to Medicare's problems are not some partisan  
plot.  Mr. Gephardt ought to familiarize himself with the authors of  
the 1995 Trustees Report, which included such Republican "friends" as  
Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, Labor Secretary Robert Reich, Health  
and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala, and Social Security  
Commissioner Shirley Chater.  <p>
If Medicare's centralized, non-competitive, single-payer system is at  
the heart of billions of dollars in wasted resources, eliminating  
waste and fraud requires that competitive, market forces be introduced  
into the Medicare system.  Free market forces and incentives would  
reduce Medicare's excessive costs and improve the quality of health  
care available for seniors.  By putting the onus for rooting out fraud  
and abuse on the private sector, and creating inescapable incentives  
to do so, risk-free opportunities to defraud the system would be  
greatly reduced.  Moreover, we would finally provide seniors with a  
medical system that develops greater quality rather than one that  
simply increasingly consumes more and more health dollars.  <p>
How we deal with Medicare's crisis will speak volumes about who we are  
as Americans and what kind of society we value.  At stake is whether  
today's senior citizens, not to mention those of us who are following  
close behind, will have a viable health-care system in the future.   
Waste and fraud will only rob us all of a better future if we continue  
to assume it is an unavoidable result of a well-meaning big government  
program.<p>

<title> $100 BILLION GOVERNMENT GIFT </title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
For Immediate Release<br>
July 25, 1995<br>
<p>

<h2> AND THE WINNERS OF THE $100 BILLION GOVERNMENT GIFT ARE
          ROSEANNE, AL BUNDY, RUPERT AND THE TV MOGULS</h2>
<p>
                            
 --- SBSC'S KERRIGAN ANNOUNCES CAMPAIGN FOR BROADCAST COMPETITION ---
</center>
<p>


<b>  WASHINGTON, DC --</b> The already rich and powerful television networks and
broadcasters, who have made billions on the free television licenses given to them by the
government, are abut to get even more, courtesy of the U.S. taxpayers.  Congress and the Federal
Communications Commission, in a bill which has passed the Senate and will soon be considered
by the House, will bestow on broadcasters -- for free -- new spectrum valued at up to $100
billion, according to Karen Kerrigan, President of the Small Business Survival Committee
(SBSC).  The plan will double the airwaves controlled by each television broadcaster.
<p>
     Kerrigan today announced that SBSC is creating the Campaign for Broadcast
Competition (CBC), a coalition formed to facilitate a debate on the spectrum issue to expose the
television broadcasters' plan to shortchange the U.S. taxpayers.  The Campaign will be joined by
individuals and public policy groups around the country to enhance public awareness and
understanding of this issue.
<p>
     "The broadcasters were initially supposed to receive this valuable spectrum as a way to
shift their current analog service to High Definition Television (HDTV) but have recently
admitted their intention to use the spectrum, not just for HDTV, but for whatever is most
profitable for them such as the addition of up to six new television channels, or paging, cellular,
or similar services.  And Congress is going along with this plan!  Do the promoters of shows
under attack by this very same Congress for their violent sexual content deserve this multi-billion
dollar gift?," Kerrigan said.
<p>
     "The Campaign is asking only that the television broadcasters be treated the same as
every other entity that wants new rights to the airwaves.  The spectrum should be auctioned off,
creating a competitive broadcast environment, encouraging the growth of new companies and
generating up to $100 billion to reduce the federal deficit.  In an era when spectrum auctions are
welcomed by government for new wireless services, it is incomprehensible that they continue
corporate welfare to benefit America's wealthiest interests."
<p>
     "The marketplace is the only place to pick winners and losers.  Competition makes the
best technological decisions for the consumer, not government," added Kerrigan.

TO:  Concerned Citizens<br>
FROM:  Small Business Survival Committee<br>
RE:  <i><b>Broadcast Spectrum Could Cost Taxpayers Billions</i></b><br>
DATE:  August 3, 1995
<p>
<hr>
<br>
The Federal Communications Commission is about to give away billions of dollars worth of public airwaves to television broadcasters free -- this after the broadcasters have already made billions on the free television licenses they already possess.  Under the current plan, the broadcasters will double their spectrum and can use it for anything they want from pay television to cellular phone service to paging -- all at the taxpayers' expense.  The spectrum should be auctioned, creating a competing broadcast environment, encouraging the growth of new companies and granting up to $100 billion to reduce the deficit. <p>
Last week, FCC Chairman Reed Hundt called on broadcasters to forge a "Contract for Kids and Community" to meet the public interest obligations they have already shirked.  Hundt's efforts to expand education programming and attain concrete commitments for broadcasters to help parents choose high quality, nonviolent programming are well-meaning.  But he has failed to connect the dots.  The broadcasters have proven in the past (and backed by public opinion surveys) that they
do not use their spectrum to further the public good.<p>
<h3>WHY AUCTIONS?</h3><p>
Since Congress decided in 1993 to stop giving the airways away free, telecommunications companies have bid over $10 billion in auctions to obtain spectrum to provide services.  Why are the broadcasters entitled to twice as much spectrum at no cost?  Shouldn't they compete along with everyone else for the rights to use the public's scarce spectrum?  Hasn't the government proven that it is lousy at picking "winners and losers" in the marketplace?  Competition makes the best decisions for consumers not the government.<p>
Broadcasters claim that auctioning the spectrum will mean the end to free television. 
Competition has benefited not only consumers, but the broadcasters!  What they fail to mention is that the broadcasters have just enjoyed their most profitable year in history. <p>
Apart from denying broadcasters corporate welfare they do not deserve, auctioning the spectrum will provide funds and flexibility to truly use the spectrum for public good.  Auction proceeds could be used to reduce the national debt and better yet, new innovative broadcast companies will provide the public with the quality programming they are demanding.<p>
<h3>ACT NOW</h3><p>
The National Association of Broadcasters is a very powerful lobby in Washington.  House Speaker Newt Gingrich is on record saying no one will take them on.  FCC Chair <a href="mail to:kidstv@fcc.gov"> Reed Hundt</a> (e-mail address: kidstv@fcc.gov) and <a href="mail to:georgia@hr.house.gov">Speaker Gingrich</a> (e-mail address: georgia@hr.house.gov) need to hear from concerned taxpayers who will not sit idly by while the powerful NAB seeks protection from market competition and robs American consumers of innovative services and costs taxpayers billions of dollars.<p>
The FCC is considering this issue now, and must hear from concerned citizens when possible. We suggest that you send a letter to Speaker Gingrich and Chairman Hundt to send them the message that the public hopes that not all of its officials share their fear of the broadcasters.<p>

<h2>Hijacking the Broadcast Spectrum</h2><br>
<b>Opinion Editorial by 
Karen Kerrigan,
President
Small Business Survival Committee
&
Founder,
Campaign for Broadcast Competition</b>
</center>
<hr>
<br>
Here is a story you won't see on network shows such as "60 Minutes," "Dateline," or
"Prime Time Live." <p>
America's network broadcasters are scurrying to preserve one of the greatest government giveaways in history.  In an era when telecommunications companies are paying the government for the use of our nation's airwaves, the broadcasters are on the verge of gaining additional spectrum for free.   A gift of taxpayer assets which, if auctioned, could raise more than $100 billion for federal debt reduction.  Even in Washington, that's a big number.<p>
This sweetheart deal will double the amount of spectrum each broadcaster currently
controls, and will allow them to offer new services such as two-way paging and wireless voice and data services, in addition to multiple channels of digital television.  It should cause considerable consternation to the telecommunication companies who have had to pay billions for their right to use the airwaves.<p>
The deal originated as part of the government's attempt in 1991 to develop an American version of High Definition Television (HDTV).  Experts were afraid that the Japanese would dominate the next generation of television technology and eliminate any American presence in the high-profile consumer electronics industry.  In a classical case of wrong-headed industrial policy, the FCC coordinated the technology development effort, and agreed to provide the broadcasters with additional spectrum to transmit the HDTV signal in order to create a market and make the transition from analog television.<p>
But a funny thing happened on the way to the market.  Technological gains made HDTV a technological dinosaur -- especially in the broadcaster's eyes.  They realized that they could provide digital (but not high definition) television utilizing a fraction of the airwaves, making way for multiple television channels, while leaving space for other lucrative services.<p>
Given the market and technological realities, the broadcaster's reneged on their
commitment to deploy HDTV.  However, they still want the spectrum.  They argue that -- without the additional spectrum -- they will never be able to compete with the new players in television, such as cable and telephone companies.  This, despite a fifty year head start.  They also argue that paying for additional spectrum will sound the death knell for "free T.V." <p>     
This line of reasoning rings hollow, especially with a budget-focused and  market-oriented Congress.  For the past fifty years the broadcasters have profited handsomely from their current business;  there is certainly no need for the federal government to guarantee their future success as participants in a competitive communications environment.  It is also hard to feel sorry for an industry whose performance last year was the most profitable in history.  It is difficult to see this as the end of advertiser-supported television.<p>
A few Members of Congress and concerned citizens are finally raising this issue for what it really is -- a multi-billion dollar giveaway.  It is an insider deal that will come at the expense of others.  With increasing pressure to reduce the national debt, Congress cannot let this deal pass by unchallenged.<p>
More importantly, an extremely expensive and profoundly wrong presumption remains
untouched:  that the government should continue to be in the business of promoting certain technologies such as HDTV, or attempting to guarantee the success of an industry by shielding, for example, the broadcasters from competition.  Recent communications success stories such as direct broadcast television and cellular telephone service offer compelling evidence that the market remains the only effective vehicle for selecting industrial winners.<p>
The recent wireless auctions, where telecommunications companies bid $10 billion to
offer a new generation of cellular services, provide an effective model for allocating the public airwaves.  It would work beautifully in allocating spectrum now being offered free of charge.  Allow the broadcasters to keep their current, free licenses to use for broadcast television.  Put the new spectrum allocation up for auction.  And forget about foisting HDTV technology onto the American public -- if they want it, someone will figure out a way to offer it to them and make the necessary investment.<p>
     The current proposal reflects wasteful stewardship of a valuable asset.  At a time ofheightened awareness of our budget limitations, Congress should not be bullied into this giveaway.  Economics, not special-interest politics, should decide the allocation and uses of the spectrum.  In a competitive telecommunications environment, entrepreneurs will meet and create new demands.<p>
Allow the market to determine the value and use of this asset and let competition reign. It will pay great dividends to consumers, the economy and the Treasury.<p>

<h3>Gift to TV Networks</h3>
<br>
To the Editor:<p>
Re "Media Mergers" (editorial, Aug. 2): Under pressure from the television networks,
Congress and the Federal Communications Commission will soon reward these
megacorporations with a multibillion-dollar deal to double their share of the airwaves free.  The broadcasters were to use this spectrum for the transition to high-definition television.  However, they are reneging on that deal -- to provide more "quality" television.  They will also use the airwaves for paging, and voice and data services.<p>
Recent auctions of public airwaves raised $10 billion to reduce the deficit; if these
companies paid billions, why shouldn't Disney, Group W and Rupert Murdoch?  The giveaway is valued at $10 billion to $100 billion.  Unless Congress reverses course, the taxpayer will pay.<p>

<title> America To Receive Six Times The Sex and Violence From Broadcasters </title>
</head>

For Immediate Release<br>
July 31, 1995<br>

<center>

<h2> AMERICA TO RECEIVE SIX TIMES THE SEX AND VIOLENCE FROM
        BROADCASTERS, COMPLIMENTS OF THE U.S. GOVERNMENT</h2>
</center>
<p>
<b>Washington, DC --</b>  The networks and broadcasters are looking to double their pleasure.  And if
given twice the airwaves, we will all be subjected to six times the violence and six times the sex
already provided on network television.
<p>
     "As early as next week, HR 1555, a telecommunications bill that would give broadcasters
spectrum valued at up to $100 billion free of charge, may come to the House floor.  Broadcasters,
in this sweetheart deal with Congress, would receive spectrum initially allocated to them for
transition to High Definition Television (HDTV).  Recently, however, they have revealed that
they intend to use the airwaves for whatever is most profitable for them, such as the addition of
up to six new television channels, paging, cellular, or similar services,"said Small Business
Survival Committee president Karen Kerrigan.
<p>
     Last week, Kerrigan announced the formation of the Campaign for Broadcast
Competition (CBC), a coalition formed to spawn debate on the spectrum issue to expose the
tremendous loss of taxpayer funds to wealthy broadcast networks.
<p>
     "Instead of promoting the growth of new telecommunications industry by auctioning the
airwaves on the free market, we can expect the broadcasters to air six times the violence, sex and
immoral content already provided in order to sell advertising and increase their ever-expansive
profits," said Kerrigan.
<p>
     And, in a National Press Club Speech, FCC Chairman Reed Hundt called for a "Contract
for Kids and Community," in an attempt to clean up the airwaves.  Yet, with HR 1555,
broadcasters may double their spectrum giving them free reign, in all aspects, to insult the
sensibilities of middle America with scenes of deviance and violence.
<p>
     "The broadcasters say they deserve these airwaves because they are providing a public
service.  Let's examine the public service accessible to us now:  According to a 1994 study
conducted by the Center for Media and Public Affairs, during an 18 hour period, an average
viewer can expect to see 1,217 violent scenes on network shows and 388 violent scenes in
commercials and promotions.  According to the American Psychological Association, the
average child watches 8,000 murders and 100,000 acts of simulated violence before finishing
elementary school," Kerrigan added.

<B><h2><I>Congressional Misperceptions About Measuring The Costs Of
Universal, Unlimited, Tax-Deductible IRAs</B></I></center></h2>
<hr>
<P><blockquote>
 &QUOT;BUT, WE DON'T DO REVENUE ESTIMATES THAT WAY.&QUOT;
<P>
 &QUOT;STAFF SCOREKEEPERS WILL SHOW THAT IRAS PRODUCE HUGE REVENUE
LOSSES.  THUS, THE MEDIA, AND MY CONSTITUENTS, WILL PERCEIVE ME
AS A BIG SPENDER.&QUOT;</blockquote>

<P>

The above remarks are typical Congressional responses (with some
notable exceptions) to the League's position and documentation
that universal, unlimited, tax-deductible IRAs are the proper
method for taxing saving.
<P>
Breaking through this mind-set and the policy inertia it inspires
is not easy, but it must be done.  How?
<P>
A determined, persistent, broad-based public attack on these negative
Congressional misperceptions is imperative.  Every taxpayer, every
segment of the media, every business, union, and association,
and every professional person, including economists, actuaries,
accountants, and lawyers, should assume  responsibility for pushing
Congress and the Administration to face up to the extremely serious
fiscal problem of how our nation taxes personal saving.  All of
us must work to persuade Congressional policy makers to legislate
the right kind of tax environment for personal saving.
<P>

Universal, unlimited, tax-deductible IRA-type plans are the proper answer
to our nation's low saving dilemma and slow economic growth. These plans
are vital to our personal, family, business, and national prosperity. <P>
<blockquote>
&QUOT;BUT, THE GOVERNMENT WANTS AND NEEDS ITS MONEY NOW.&QUOT;</blockquote>
<P>
Far too often the above comment is used by members of Congress
and others to justify the government's contention that expanding
the tax deferral of saving is not possible, because the government
wants and needs &quot;its&quot; money now.
<P>
The government's money, of course, is extracted from taxpayers'
incomes and savings-the income that workers, savers-investors,
and business entrepreneurs earn as rewards for helping to produce
things people want to buy.  The more heavily government taxes
the income people save, the less saving people undertake, and
the less investment they make in adding to the nation's productivity
and output growth.
<P>
Government, therefore, should weigh these costs of taxing the
income people save-and taxing the income that savings earn-against
its need for tax revenue now.  Government impatience in raking
in tax dollars is extremely costly to the country and, in the
long run, to the government, too.  It must never be forgotten
that the economic strength of government is bound inextricably
with the economic strength of its taxpayers.
<P>
Government patience in collecting tax revenues is particularly
important when it comes to tax-deductible saving.  Until such
saving, unfettered by taxes, is consumed, it performs highly constructive
triple duty by (1) providing investment growth and/or income for
the saver, and (2) providing more capital to create production,
jobs, and profits, all of which (3) generate more taxes for the
government.
<P>
Only when the taxpayer wants to use for consumption some of the
income he or she has saved and invested should that income be
taxed.
<P>
Saving must come first for the government and taxpayer alike.
 Taxes must come last when saving stops.

<h2><B><i>&quot;Our Nation's Debt Is Sky High Already&quot;</center>
<br>
<center>&quot;More Debt From Universal, Unlimited IRA Tax Deferrals 
Scares Me To Death!&quot;</B></h2>
</center></i>
<hr>
Sound familiar?
<P>
According to the Committee on Ways and Means' Green Book (that
describes their income tax revenue estimates), tax-deductible
contributions to IRAs are considered as &quot;tax expenditures,&quot;
and &quot;...tax expenditures can be viewed as...spending programs.&quot;
<P>
In other words, the taxes deferred by tax-deductible IRAs are
treated by the government as if they were part of a spending program
that increases government debt.
<P>
The government, and many others, claim that these tax-deferred
saving programs are undesirable, because:  (a) government debt
is sky-high already; and (b) sound governance dictates that the
government's deficit and debt must be reduced.
<P>
Any debt, private or government, can finance either fruitless
spending or fruitful enterprise.  For example, a person's first
home mortgage probably sends his or her debt sky-high, but the
debt is collateralized by the home and reflects the borrower's
favorable prospect for repayment of the loan.  Such debt is not
considered fruitless.  Certainly, too, the lender treats the mortgage
as an asset upon which it expects to earn income.
<P>
In much the same way, IRA-related government debt is good, not
bad.  In reality, every penny of government debt arising from
IRAs is offset by the directly-related free-market investments
held within each taxpayer's IRA.  The tax money that wasn't collected
by the government didn't disappear-and it wasn't spent on consumption;
it was invested in income-producing assets, adding to the total
income of the economy, hence to total government tax revenues.
 
<P>
In accordance with law, all of this tax money is actually held
in trust within the IRA for the future payment of taxes and invested
in income-producing assets.  Each taxpayer has a legal liability
to pay his or her taxes upon any IRA withdrawal.  Thus, with every
dollar saved in an IRA, the government always obtains a tax receivable,
a governmental asset, that always matches the taxpayer's liability.
<P>
Certainly, too, if a bank loaned you money for a business and
you put up collateral equal to two to six times the size of the
loan, a bank wouldn't impose a second layer of cost upon you that
required you to pay a percent of the relevant increase in the
equity in your business each year until you paid off your loan
in full.  Such a second layer of cost is analogous to the government's
second layer of tax on saving under the ordinary income tax for
people in the various income tax brackets.  How long do you think
that bank would stay in business unless it had the sovereign power
of government to impose its will?
<P>
As shown in this analysis, with tax-deductible IRAs, the government
can make huge amounts of money by:  (a) not being so quick to
tax a taxpayer's income before he or she can even save and invest
it; and (b) not taxing the returns on that saving each year thereafter.
 Collecting taxes when saving ceases is proper and productive
taxation for the government.
<P>
Clearly, IRA-related government debt does not arise from any government
spending, it arises solely from taxpayers' saving.  Every home
owner with a mortgage knows that his or her liabilities (debt)
have increased-but so have his or her assets.  Thus, debt is not
inherently bad.  Our nation would be far poorer without it.  The
same accounting and economic perspectives are properly analogous
to tax-deductible IRAs.
<P>
Further, tax-deductible IRAs, in the aggregate and over time,
will create far more tax revenues for the government than can
flow from the suffocating financial and economic effects that
arise from the ordinary income tax on saving.
<P>
Tax-deductible IRAs increase new saving and private capital formation,
thereby creating more jobs and productivity growth.  From this,
our nation's economic fortunes will spiral upward, not spiral
downward, as currently induced by the ordinary income tax treatment
of saving.
<P>
<b>Existing Government Debt &amp; Existing IRA Assets</b>
<P>
Our nation's existing qualified plan assets (the assets of pensions,
profit sharing, 401(k) plans, IRAs, etc.) currently total more
than three trillion dollars.  In reality, these assets, primarily
investments in private enterprises, represent the present-value
of future taxable benefits payable to plan participants over some
future period of time.
<P>
If we assume that, on average, these taxpayers will be in the
30&#177;% tax bracket when benefits are paid, then 30&#177;% of
the $3&#177; trillion of qualified plan assets represent the present-value
of future taxes, or $900&#177; billion.  These mega-billions of
dollars currently held in trust for the payment of future taxes
offset an equal amount of directly-related government debt.  The
additional production that flows from these investments, and the
tax revenues on the additional income that production generates,
means that the government's finances are strengthened by these
savings.
<P>
These billions of tax receivables show up nowhere as assets on
our government's tax books.  That's as if the bank that loaned
mortgage money considered all such loans as spending (or losses)
until each repayment is received in some future year.  
<P>
Government debt arising from tax-deductible IRAs reflects a reservoir
of immense financial strength for our nation.  The dynamic tax
revenue gains for the government from universal IRAs will, in
reality, reduce and eventually eliminate that debt over a period
of time.
<P>
It is also very appropriate to point out that even though current
government tax policy decries tax deductions for IRAs, pensions,
and other tax deferred savings programs, the government simultaneously
casts covetous eyes at the wonderful, tax deferred, free-market
accumulations of assets now held within these plans.  The government
seems capable of ignoring the fact that this major reservoir of
free-market capital wouldn't be there without the tax deductions
and tax deferrals the government abhors.  
<P>
Every taxpayer must be constantly vigilant to protect this reservoir
of jobs creating capital from the social engineers within government
who would prefer, if permitted, to dictate how some, or all, of
these assets are to be invested, and/or who would prefer to tap
this reservoir of wealth by imposing more taxes thereon either
directly or indirectly.
<P>
<I>Tax-deductible, tax deferred, free-market assets are the lifeblood
of our nation.  They must be protected and nourished constantly
and vigorously.</I>

<B><h2><I><center>What's The Cost?</B></I></center></h2>
<hr>
<P>

That question is immediately asked by every member of the Congress
who considers tax legislation.  Universal, unlimited, tax-deductible
IRA legislation is certainly no exception, because the words &quot;universal,&quot;
&quot;unlimited,&quot; and &quot;tax-deductible&quot; invoke the
prospect of a large &quot;cost.&quot;
<P>
Congressional policy makers' thinking in these terms is encouraged
by the treatment of tax provisions like IRAs in the government's
so-called Tax Expenditure Budget.  Estimates prepared by the staff
of the Joint Committee on Taxation of the tax expenditures (i.e.,
&quot;costs,&quot; in the vernacular of Congress) for various
&quot;Income Security&quot; budget functions are shown in the
following table.  By precedent or rule, all members of Congress
use these figures as the basis for their legislative considerations.
<pre>
 				Year &amp; Billions of Dollars 
			----------------------------------------------------	
Net Exclusion of 						Total
Pension Contributions 	1994	1995	1996	1997	1998	'94-'98
&amp; Earnings
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Employer Plans 		55.3 	58.5 	62.0 	65.7 	69.6 	311.1

IRAs			6.2 	6.5 	7.0 	7.5 	8.0 	35.2

Keogh Plans 		3.0 	3.1	3.3 	3.5 	3.7 	16.6

* From Joint Committee Taxation Report
</pre>

The April 22, 1993, Joint Committee on Taxation report states that these
&quot;Tax expenditures are most similar to those direct <I>spending
programs</I> which have no spending limits, and which are available as
entitlements to those who meet the statutory criteria established for the
programs&quot; (emphasis added). Direct spending entitlement programs
include:  Social Security, railroad retirement, federal employees
retirement and insurance, unemployment assistance, Medicare, Medicaid,
veterans hospital care, housing, nutrition, public assistance programs,
etc. <P>

As previously discussed in this analysis, the tax expenditure figures
cited above are not &quot;spendings,&quot; regardless of the label used by
the staff.  And, in no way are net exclusions of pension contributions and
earnings &quot;most similar to direct spending programs&quot; such as
those listed in the paragraph above.  In reality, pension exclusions
result in &quot;tax deferrals&quot; (a government asset) upon which the
government receives a free-market rate of total return. <P>

Over three trillion dollars of &quot;qualified plan&quot; assets are now
held by various qualified plan trusts.  Those assets include the past
&quot;net exclusions,&quot; such as those cited in the table above. 
Because most of these assets were acquired by <I>new</I> saving undertaken
in response to the tax deferral, the various plans' aggregate tax
liability to the government with respect to those assets far exceeds the
directly-related government debt arising from the past net exclusions. 
This is particularly true of employer pension plans that generated huge
amounts of new saving over the years.  Over more recent years, however,
senseless and self-defeating funding constrictions imposed by Congress on
the plans have resulted in cut-backs and the abandonment of plans to the
great detriment of our economy. <P>

Regardless of the dollar magnitude of the &quot;tax expenditure&quot; that
the staff may estimate for universal IRAs, it must be recognized that not
a nickel of that amount is spent on consumption; every bit of it is
invested by the IRA owner in income-producing assets. If the average
taxpayers' tax bracket is 25%, for example, the total sum that's invested
in these IRAs will be four times the alleged tax expenditure.  Most of
that investment will be saving that wouldn't have been undertaken if the
universal IRA tax treatment hadn't been provided.  That's the greatest
thing that could happen to our nation's low rate of private saving.  As a
result thereof, our economy will expand dramatically, thereby providing
more production, more jobs, an increasing standard of living, and more
taxes. <P> In reality, contrary to the government's position that the
above &quot;exclusions&quot; are a cost, they should be viewed as a
working asset invested in free-market enterprise.  Thus, the larger the
aggregate tax deductions, the more positive are the prospective real
economic results.  <I>The government's disastrous perception of the
economic effects of tax-deferred saving faces 180 degrees in the wrong
direction!</I> <P> 

A few years ago a highly respected Washington, D.C., actuary (Paul H.
Jackson, FSA, The Wyatt Company), who specialized in pensions, wrote a
brief analysis of the government's methodology in determining pension tax
expenditures.  This analysis was published in the Newsletter of the
Society of Actuaries.  Mr. Jackson noted that within Congress, tax
expenditure figures are generally accepted as &quot;fact.&quot;  He also
noted that the largest single tax expenditure is the exclusion of pension
contributions, and investment income thereon, from the taxable income of
covered individuals.  Mr. Jackson concluded that &quot;...these tax
expenditure facts are conceptually flawed, arbitrary, and almost useless
for budget purposes.&quot;  He also concluded that &quot;...any tax law
based on such arbitrary and capricious figures can only be good by
accident.&quot; Mr. Jackson hit the nail on the head in precise, actuarial
fashion. 

<P>
<I>It is shocking that our government's fundamental tax policy,
as it relates to the vitally important fiscal element of tax-deferred
saving, rests upon analyses that are aptly described as being
&quot;arbitrary and capricious,&quot; and that produce legislation
that &quot;can only be good by accident.&quot;</I>

<CENTER><H2>What Is The American Conservative Union? </H2></CENTER> 
<HR>

<a href="#cpac">CPAC</a><br>
<a href="#staff">Staff and Officers</a><br><hr>
  </center> 
 <P> 
 The American Conservative Union is the nation's oldest conservative   
lobbying organization. ACU's purpose is to effectively communicate and   
advance the goals and principles of conservatism through one multi-issue,   
umbrella organization. The <a href="/conservative/acu.html">Statement of Principles</a> makes clear ACU's   
support of capitalism, belief in the doctrine of original intent of the   
framers of the Constitution, confidence in traditional moral values, and   
commitment to a strong national defense.  
 <P> 
Over the years, ACU has been on the cutting edge of major public policy   
battles. Among ACU's significant efforts, past and present, are opposing   
President Clinton's bureaucratic health proposal, his excessive spending   
and taxes, the Panama Canal giveaway, fighting to keep OSHA off the   
back of small businesses, opposing the SALT treaties, supporting aid to   
freedom fighters in Marxist countries, promoting the confirmation of   
conservative Justices to the Supreme Court, battling against higher taxes,   
and advocating the need for near-term deployment of strategic defenses.   
 <P> 
In 1994, through its Citizens Against Rationing Health coalition,   
sponsorship of national "town meetings," and a "Health Care Truth   
Tour," ACU spearheaded the conservative response on the health   
reform issue.  
 <P> 
Whether fighting for lower taxes and less government spending, more   
effective and efficient military protection, or the cause of freedom world-  
wide, by speaking for the entire conservative movement the American   
Conservative Union is always "Your Conservative Voice in Washington."  
 <P> 
<a name="ratings"><h3>RATINGS</h3></a><br>
<a href="#table">Contents</a>  
 <P> 
 Since 1971, ACU has published annual ratings of Congress. Each   
member of the House and Senate is rated on a scale of 0 to 100, based on   
actual votes cast on a wide range of issues. The ratings are designed to   
show how members vote on all the major issues to gauge their adherence   
to conservative principles. As the conservative rating listed in all major   
political almanacs and reference guides, the ACU ratings are often quoted   
by the media and are extensively used by political strategists and   
candidates running for public office.  
 <P> 
The American Conservative Union has periodically published several   
special Voting Indices on specific important issue areas such as defense   
and SDI, judicial nominations, and pork barrel spending. In election   
years, the ACU has provided Interim Ratings of Congress to track votes   
that occurred during that Session before the elections.  
 <P> 
  
<a name="pubs"><h3>PUBLICATIONS</h3></a><br>
<a href="#table">Contents</a>
 <P> 
ACU publishes selected legislative guides that are working manuals   
primarily used by members of Congress and their staffs. One example is   
<i>The Clinton Plan: More Power to Government</i>, documenting the  
Clinton record, and showing how he has consistently worked to give more power to Big Government -- and less to the American people.  
Another is <i><a href="/conservative/platformwelcome.html">The 1996 Committee for a Conservative Platform</a>  
</i>; a coalition effort by more than thirty groups to keep the Republican Party platform conservative.  
 <P> 
ACU has also produced audio and video messages, such as TV   
documentaries on the SALT treaties and the Panama Canal, among   
others. Recent productions have included hard-hitting ads on the Clinton   
gas tax, opposition to an invasion of Haiti, and an "infomercial" on health   
care reform. Complete A-V tapes of CPAC proceedings are also made   
available each year.  
 <P> 
<a name="cpac"><h3>CPAC</h3></a><br>
<a href="#table">Contents</a>  
 <P> 
 Since 1974, the ACU has hosted the annual <a href="http://www.cpac.org">Conservative Political   
Action Conference</a>. Thousands of conservative activists and leaders from   
around the nation meet for three days to discuss current issues and   
policies, and set the agenda for the future. Open to the general public,   
CPAC always offers a distinguished cast of participants. Among them   
have been Presidents Ronald Reagan and George Bush, Vice   
President Dan Quayle, Senate GOP leader Bob Dole, House Speaker 
Newt Gingrich, numerous other Senators and Representatives, Cabinet   
officers, media correspondents, international celebrities and other key   
political figures. CPAC serves to bring dedicated and talented Americans   
into the conservative movement and to train and motivate them for   
political action.<P>

<title>William W. Pascoe, III -- ACU</title>
</head>
<body>
<center>
<h2>William W Pascoe, III</h2>
</center>
<hr>
<br>
William W. Pascoe, III, is the Political Director of the American Conservative Union, based in Alexandria, Virginia.  The ACU, celebrating its 31st anniversary, is the nation's oldest conservative grass-roots lobbying organization, and represents more than one million members and supporters, in each of the 50 states.  The organization lobbies on the entire range of issues before the Congress, and its annual vote ratings -- widely used by the media, academics, and other congressional analysts -- are considered the premier indicator of the Congress' ideological voting patterns.<p>
In his capacity as Political Director, Mr. Pascoe is responsible for overseeing the legislative, communications, and field operations of the organization.  These responsibilities entail gathering, collating, and analyzing information on matters of legislative interest; maintaining liaison with Members of Congress on both sides of the aisle, their staffs, and committee staffs; representing the views of the ACU before such officials and staffs; directing the grass-roots lobbying efforts of the organization; compiling and analyzing the annual vote ratings; preparing all outgoing public communications of the organization; and dealing extensively with print and broadcast media to represent the organization's views on the wide range of public policy issues.<p>
In addition to his current duties at the ACU, Mr. Pascoe is also a columnist on national and international political issues for the Washington Times, and is the conservative talking head on "BattleLine," a twice-weekly point-counterpoint debate heard Tuesdays and Thursdays on Gene Pell's "Dateline America" radio show, nationally syndicated by Radio America. <p>
Prior to joining the ACU in 1993, Mr. Pascoe held numerous positions throughout the Washington political and policy-making community:  chief of staff to U.S. Rep. Bob McEwen (1992-93); Managing Partner of his own public affairs consulting firm, Pascoe, Norquist, Jones & Co. (1990-92); Executive Director of Krieble Associates, Inc., a private foundation and public affairs office in Washington dedicated to providing assistance to democratic activists behind the Iron Curtain (1988-90); liaison to the conservative community for Bush/Quayle '88, as Director of the Office of National Voter Coalitions (1988); Policy Analyst at The Heritage Foundation (1985-88); and consultant to the U.S. Department of State (1984-85).<p>
Mr. Pascoe was the Republican nominee for the 47th District seat in the Virginia General Assembly in 1987.<p>
Mr. Pascoe was graduated from the University of Virginia with a BA in Government and History in 1982, and an MA in Foreign Affairs in 1984.  He is a member of the Council for National Policy, the World Affairs Council of Washington, and MENSA.   <p>

<B><h2><I><center>
Does It Really Matter How The Government Estimates The Revenue Gains And Losses From Changes In The Tax 
Laws?</h2></B></I></center>
<hr>
 <P>
Absolutely.  For example, in 1986 the government wanted more tax
revenue, so it effectively increased taxes on commercial real
estate.  Thus, investors' after-tax net rates of return on commercial
real estate were significantly reduced.  Naturally, and as a result,
real estate values and prices came tumbling down, leading to defaults
on mortgages, failed S &amp; Ls, failed banks, and jobs lost.
 Government bailouts (i.e., more taxpayer taxes) followed.
<P>
Every taxpayer has been severely damaged, directly or indirectly,
because of these ill-considered tax increases.  Far more tax revenue
and economic growth was lost (and will be lost) because of these
real estate tax increases than any related revenue gain estimated
by the government in 1986.
<P>
And, of course, there was the luxury tax on boats, enacted in
1990, that was supposed to increase tax revenue.  All it did was
wipe out jobs and lose tax revenue.  Government tax revenue estimators
do not take into account the rational, to-be-expected response
of taxpayers to tax law changes.
<P>
Further, as so clearly demonstrated in this analysis, the government's
revenue estimation methods as applied to tax-deductible saving
create a tax policy that faces 180 degrees in the wrong direction.
 The economic costs to our nation of this gigantic error can be
measured in trillions of dollars.
<P>
Government revenue estimation methodologies are scandalously wrong.
This must be corrected.

<B><h2><I><center>The U.S. Government's 1995 Budget Estimates Of The Costs
Of IRAs</B></I></h2></center>
<hr>
<P>
The U.S. government's 1995 Budget, for the first time ever, has
included discounted present-value estimates of revenue losses
for certain &quot;tax expenditures&quot; set forth elsewhere in
the Budget presentation (The 1995 Budget of the United States
Government-Analytical Perspectives, pages 59, 60, &amp; 61).
<P>
The government describes these present-value estimates as &quot;representing
the tax expenditure revenue losses, net of future tax payments.&quot;
The 1995 budget document explains that the tax deferrals on the
contributions, and on the accrued earnings thereon (i.e., tax
expenditures), will eventually be paid out upon an IRA withdrawal
when taxes will then be due.  Thus, these expected receipts are
included in these government present-value estimates.  The government
also points out that the discount rate used for the present-value
estimates is the interest rate on comparable maturity Treasury
debt.
<P>
Based upon the above, the government's 1995 Budget document presented
the following estimates for IRAs:
<P>
<pre>		1994 Tax Revenue Loss Estimates for IRAs
		----------------------------------------	
			(In Millions Of Dollars)

	Tax Expenditure 			$5,415 (a)

	Discounted Present-Value
 	Of The Above Tax Expenditure 		$1,735 (b)
</pre>

Based on the above figures, the &quot;present-value&quot; costs of IRAs (b
above) only equal 32% of the tax expenditure costs (a above) used by the
government in formulating tax policy. <P>

In view of the fact that the government recovers the full IRA tax
deduction with interest upon a withdrawal, the above present-value costs
(b above) reflect solely the cost arising from the &quot;second
layer&quot; of ordinary income tax (double taxation) that should not be
imposed in the first place (see pages 6 &amp; 7). <P>

Clearly, the government now admits that its alleged cost estimate for IRAs
in 1994 is not $5.4 billion, but 68% less, i.e., $1,735,000. <I>In effect,
the government admits by its own analysis that its alleged &quot;tax
expenditure&quot; costs for IRAs that are used in formulating tax
legislation are three times higher than they should be!<B> </B>($5.4
billion &#247; $1.7 billion = 3.18)</I>

<P> And even the above severely reduced alleged cost of $1.7 billion is
erroneous, because, as portrayed earlier in this analysis, the government
is assuming that all the saving in IRAs is old saving.  This means that
the government would have, if it had not been for the IRAs, collected its
&quot;second layer&quot; of tax.  This second layer of tax is an improper,
self-defeating form of taxation. 

<P> The government also ignores the fact that there is <I>no</I> cost to
the government if IRA contributions are <I>new</I> saving. Further, the
government calculation <I>omits</I> the dynamic economic gains from
tax-deductible IRAs that create more capital through increased saving,
thereby increasing production, creating more jobs, higher standards of
living, and yes-more taxes. 

<P> <I>The magnitude of the true costs to our nation's economy arising
from such erroneous tax revenue estimates is virtually beyond
comprehension.  It is shocking, scandalous, and worthy of imposed
investigation and correction.</I>

<h2><center><I><B>The Unlocking Of Fringe Benefit Handcuffs</B></I></center>
</h2>

<hr>
<P>
Our nation's economy is rapidly changing character as new businesses
emerge, older businesses down-size, global competition and opportunities
increase, and people become more independent and mobile due to
rapid technology changes.  This has direct and indirect repercussions
on employment practices, including employer-provided fringe benefits.
<P>
The legendary business analyst and writer, Peter Drucker, in a
recent article about existing employer fringe benefit plans, likened
them to the old fashioned &quot;company store&quot; where employees
were bound to employers, via the products, services, and credits
these stores provided.
<P>
Under today's economic conditions in a very competitive national
and global economy, employer fringe benefit plans have often become
the &quot;company store&quot; handcuffs that keep employees from
exploring new areas of employment.  This &quot;locking in&quot;
operates to the detriment of the employees' economic position
in life, as well as to the detriment of the employer and our nation's
economy.  Handcuffs can tie two people together even if both need
release.
<P>
Universal, unlimited, tax-deductible IRAs can greatly change this
existing pattern of employer-provided fringe benefit plans for
the better.  And, there would be no need for government mandates
or controls.
<P>
For example, an employer could decide (and/or bargain) to replace
some part, or all, of its existing fringe benefit program by diverting
the costs of one or more of these plans into the employees' wages
or salaries.  The employees, as owners of unlimited, tax-deductible
IRAs, would receive this welcome wage increase and, in turn, deposit
it within their unlimited, tax-deductible IRAs.
<P>
Using his or her IRA, the individual could purchase fringe benefit-type
coverage(s) to fit his or her particular needs or desires.  By
allowing tax deductions for premiums and/or benefit payments paid
from the IRA, these tax effects could parallel those now found
under employer-sponsored plans.
<P>
Interestingly, the Administration's 1994 &quot;Health Reform Proposal&quot;
included a provision that premium payments made by &quot;self-employed&quot;
persons would be fully tax-deductible.  This is the same approach
that could be used when universal, unlimited, tax-deductible IRAs
are used to replace an employer-provided fringe benefit.
<P>
Consider these advantages of an IRA-based, individualized, fringe
benefit alternative:
<P>
  It enhances an individual employee's personal responsibility
for himself and his family in many ways.  For example, some persons
may choose &quot;high deductibles&quot; and &quot;major medical&quot;
insurance, while self-insuring the less onerous, but administratively
expensive, costs of medical care.
<P>
 Other persons may want or need more or less life insurance than
his or her employer provides.  Some people may choose a long-term
sickness insurance program that's not otherwise available through
the employer.  Alternatively, too, the diverted wages can be saved
in the tax-deductible IRA without replacing the employer-provided
coverage, as might be the case of a young, single employee in
good health.
<P>
 When one considers that a 10%, 20%, 30%, and up, wage increase
can flow from such a basic change in employee benefit plan structures,
it becomes obvious that far more efficient wage/benefits structures
are obtainable without increasing the costs of doing business.
<P>
  In short, the use of unlimited, tax-deductible IRAs as a means
to provide individualized fringe benefits is fiscally sound, very
flexible, and will be very attractive to many employees and employers
alike.
<P>
  Without question, too, the &quot;personal costs/benefits received&quot;
relationship between the IRA owner-buyer and the fringe benefit
provider will greatly enhance claims control and reduce the costs
of coverage.  Spending one's own IRA account money for &quot;coverage&quot;
and &quot;care,&quot; as contrasted with spending from an unlimited
employer or insurer fund, makes a very big &quot;cost control&quot;
difference.
<P>
  Employers may find it desirable to be relieved of the very heavy
burden of choosing, designing, administering, monitoring, and
paying for the plans they now offer.  The employer's overall costs
can be the same, but the diversion of benefit plan costs to wages
can be far more useful to the employee-and the employer.  Certainly,
the employer's &quot;benefit cost&quot; diversion to &quot;wages&quot;
creates a more controllable cost from both the employer and the
user perspective.
<P>
  Clearly, the existing employer-based structure to provide fringe
benefit plans has been stretched to the breaking point in many,
if not most, situations.  Most employers are, after all, in the
business of making products and services, not designing and administering
fringe benefits to fit each employee's particular needs.  This
is true of most all employers regardless of their size.
<P>
  IRA-based fringe benefits do not prohibit employers, unions,
associations, independent providers, such as insurers and Blue
Cross, etc. (or groups thereof), from offering plans to employees,
members, or individuals that will enable the employee (IRA owner)
to select the plan(s) that best fits his or her needs and desires.
 Such sponsored plans will be able to provide the discounts normally
associated with high volume business.
<P>
  Unlimited, tax-deductible IRA-based fringe benefits also help
solve the very serious problem of &quot;benefits portability&quot;
when an employee changes employers, moves geographically, and/or
retires.  Obviously, too, the universal, unlimited, tax-deductible
attributes of an IRA-type plan would greatly facilitate the personal
pre-funding of post-retirement coverages that are so vitally important
to our current and future senior citizens.
<P>
  There will be those in the government and in the private sector
who will claim that employees will wastefully spend the fringe
benefit costs diverted to tax-deductible IRAs.  However, people
need, and should have, the responsibility for their own actions-and
the vast majority of our citizens will welcome this.  There will
always be those who need help, but our localities, private institutions,
and charities are in a far better position to provide that help.
 This will be particularly true when personal saving is released
from the senseless bondage of double taxation.
<P>
Universal, unlimited, tax-deductible IRAs create a whole new environment
for imaginative, sound ways in which our citizens can personally
assume more responsibility and opportunity for their own current
and future &quot;financial&quot; and &quot;protection&quot; needs.
 These needs and desires embrace both a &quot;saving&quot; and
&quot;protection&quot; element that can best be decided at a personal
and family level.  And, of course, these needs and desires of
an individual, or family, will undoubtedly change over the years
as circumstances change.  Universal, unlimited, tax-deductible
IRA-type plans that can provide fringe benefits offer the maximum,
sound flexibility to meet these emerging changes from both the
employee's and employer's perspective.
<P>
Universal, unlimited, tax-deductible IRAs also provide each employer
with the opportunity to re-think the design of its fringe benefits
programs not only in regards to the company's objectives, but
those of its employees, too.  In contrast, replacing the &quot;company
store&quot; with the &quot;government's store&quot; for health
care coverage is a disastrous retreat from the sound, emerging,
very competitive trends of the future.
<P>
The attractive option of combining universal, unlimited, tax-deductible
IRAs with individually selected &quot;saving&quot; and &quot;protection&quot;
alternatives makes absolute sense.

<h2><center><I><B>The Social Security Trust Fund And Tax-Deductible 
IRAs</B></I></center></h2>
<hr>
 <P>
The Social Security Trust Fund can be compared to the proverbial
cookie jar into which mega-billions of excess Social Security
taxes are deposited, only to have these mega-billions borrowed
out by the government for the government's current spending, thereby
leaving the cookie jar filled with governmental IOUs.  
<P>
When baby-boomers retire and the so-called trust fund is diminished,
these IOUs must be redeemed in order to pay benefits.  Who must
then pay off these government bonds?-none other than baby boomers,
their children, and their grandchildren.
<P>
Haeworth Robertson, former Chief Actuary of the Social Security
Administration, states that:  
<P>
&quot;The government would have us believe that Social Security
is accumulating huge trust funds that will be used in the 21st
century to help finance the high cost of retirement benefits that
will become payable.  This simply is not true.  The present trust
funds, and probably the future trust funds, are mere window dressing
and have no economic reality.&quot;  (Newsletter of the Society
of Actuaries, September, 1992.)
<P>
Regardless of how Congress lowers Social Security benefits (e.g.,
increasing the normal retirement age to 70 or 75) and/or increases
Social Security taxes (Congress <I>must</I> take one or both of
these steps for Social Security to survive), the financial burden
of Social Security will always rest on the shoulders of the then-existing,
younger work force.  Such &quot;transfer payments&quot; from the
younger generation (and unborn generation) to the older generation
are a way-of-life that can not survive politically nor economically.
<P>
Unlike Social Security, unlimited, tax-deductible IRAs are fully
funded by investments in real income-producing assets.  The income
produced by those assets provides the benefits distributed to
the IRA owners, and the taxes on those benefits will more than
equal the compounded amount of the taxes deferred by the deduction
of the owners' contribution to their IRAs.  In contrast with Social
Security, the distribution of IRA benefits does not require taxing
our children's and grandchildren's income.  Universal, unlimited,
tax-deductible IRAs, as embodied in Individual Investment Accounts,
can and must become the strong financial bastion for current and
future generations.
<P>
 
<P>
The financial soundness of tax-deductible IRAs rests on the solid
rock of free enterprise.  Unlike IRAs, the financial soundness
of Social Security rests upon the power of government to tax,
and to tax again and again.  Such taxation progressively weakens,
not strengthens, our nation and its Social Security promises.
<P>
There is no effective prefunding with Social Security; the system
merely collects and redistributes taxes.  No basic economic growth
is created from Social Security, as is true of tax-deductible
IRAs.  Individual Investment Accounts, as proposed herein, help
create and generate economic self-reliance.  Social Security does
the opposite.

<h2><center><I><B>Wealth</B></I></center>
</h2>
<hr>
<P>
The word &quot;wealth&quot; has many connotations.  Too often,
financial wealth is interpreted negatively, thereby implying that
wealth is not desirable.  Or, that perhaps wealth above some level
is too much.
<P>
Obviously, too, financial &quot;wealth&quot; is easily interpreted,
as they say, in &quot;the eyes of the beholder.&quot;  Great wealth
to one person may be little wealth to another.
<P>
Regardless of personal feelings as to what is &quot;wealth,&quot;
from a financial perspective it is important for everyone to recognize
that savings, regardless of amount, are wealth.  And, having savings,
i.e., wealth, regardless of amount, is good for everyone-the person
who has it, those who use it directly or indirectly, and our nation.
<P>
We all prefer to live in a wealthy nation-and the wealth of a
nation is derived from the wealth of its people-not the other
way around.  The financial wealth of people can only arise from
saving (not consuming) and its fruitful use.  When people borrow,
they borrow someone else's saving.
<P>
Saving, and its growth, produces wealth.  Thus, it makes absolute
sense for governments-via their sovereign power-to encourage private
saving, and its growth, by every person.  Needless to say, for
our government to needlessly punish saving via the ordinary income
tax is crazy, self-defeating, and an abuse of power.
<P>
The growth of wealth invested via private enterprise should have
no bounds-for anyone-as amply demonstrated in this analysis. 
Government misconceptions concerning the taxation of wealth, and
its accumulation, must change-and change promptly-for everyone's
sake, including the government's.  
<P>
And, the accumulation of wealth (or its maintenance) must not
be constrained by notions that wealth existing at death above
some artificially set level must be captured by government (via
estate taxes, etc.), because the wealth is &quot;too high,&quot;
or because of some artificial notion promoted by some economists
of &quot;life-cycle&quot; taxation.  This usually means that if
the government didn't collect enough taxes while you lived, the
government should get the balance when you die.
<P>
From the government's fiscal perspective, with IRA-type saving,
death should be no more of a taxable event than an investment
transaction.  After all, inherited savings, i.e., wealth, will
continue to create production, jobs, rising standards of living,
more taxes, as well as prospective spending power for the owners
thereof.  Progressive estate tax rates applied to saving, like
the ordinary income tax, cut off the government's fiscal nose
to spite its face.
<P>
Universal, unlimited, tax-deductible IRAs avoid estate taxes through
the ongoing deferral of the income taxes on invested wealth. 
In due course, all withdrawals will be taxed at progressive income
tax rates.  This clearly maintains sound tax policy and accumulated
saving.
<P>
Wealth, small or large, is of great value to everyone, directly
and indirectly, including the government.  Certainly, to have
the government snatch away as an additional tax up to 55% of a
person's, or a family's, hard-earned investment growth (wealth)
at the time of death can destroy a lifetime of energetic, productive
work, and/or force individuals and families into nonproductive
(except to avoid the tax) tax avoidance methods.  The rational
taxation of saving, whereby the government maximizes its tax potential,
is to tax saving only when it's consumed.
<P>
<I>Unfortunately, the largest, persistent predator of wealth is
the irrational sovereign power of government.  Eternal vigilance
and diligence is required by each and every voter/taxpayer to
protect their wealth, and to nourish it.</I>

<h2><center><I><B>Inertia</B></I></center>
</h2>
<hr>
<P>
<blockquote>in*er*tia <I>n</I> The tendency of matter to remain at rest, if
at rest, or, if moving, to keep moving in the same direction,
unless affected by some outside force.</blockquote>
<P>
Common sense, as well as sound economic thinking, tells us that
punishing saving by double taxation just doesn't make sense. 
In fact, it's stupid (i.e., foolish; irrational-as, what a stupid
idea).
<P>
If so, why do we, as a nation, do it?  First and foremost, the
answer is that you, yes you, (and I), tend to be content with
bitching, moaning, wringing your hands, and never taking any action
on your own to change the direction of such taxation;  i.e., you
suffer from inertia-as do we all.
<P>
<I>Let it be stated clearly:  no Congressman, no Administration,
and no &quot;staffer&quot; can properly defend the way our government
taxes saving.  So, we, individually and collectively, must assume
the responsibility to take action to force change.</I>
<P>
Every voter/taxpayer must have the gumption to challenge and demand
of their Representative and Senators a clear statement of their
position on S. 929 and H.R. 3179 (a description of the Individual
Investment Account Act is included herein).  This Act is simple
to understand and is positive legislation from every perspective.
 There are, of course, an increasing number of legislative proposals
that include among their objectives the removal of the double
tax on saving.  It is not the specific bill that's so important,
<I>the most important objective is ridding our economy of the
double tax on saving.</I>  The singular advantage of the Individual
Investment Act is that it is simple to understand and simple to
implement after the legislation is enacted.
<P>
There is no valid reason why your Representative and Senators
should not cosponsor S. 929 or H.R. 3179, and other bills that
move in this positive direction.  Strange as it may seem to you
(if you're not a salesman), legislators have to be asked.  No
legislator has the desire to deny his or her constituents (and
himself, or herself) the fruits of personal saving.
<P>
Up to now, most all legislators have been content to follow the
lead of others (principally staff) who proclaim that &quot;there's
a large revenue loss from tax deferred saving,&quot; or &quot;this
legislation is not the way we do it.&quot;   Legislators, by tradition
or inertia tend to merely accept these proclamations as immutable
fact without digging deeper.  
<P>
Every legislator needs your personal push (i.e., outside force,
see above) to start him or her moving in the proper direction
away from his or her own inertia toward swift removal of the double
tax on saving.  S. 929 and H.R. 3179 certainly pave the way to
do the job completely.
<P>
Your personal note (handwritten  is best) is what it takes.  Have
your spouse, friends, family, and associates write letters, too,
in their own style.  Keep a copy, and if you wish, send the League
a copy, too-we'll follow up.  Don't settle for a bland response.
 Insist on &quot;cosponsorship&quot; or a sound reason why not.
 Be persistent.  And, if you need to be, even a pest.  After all,
it's your money and your financial health that's at stake.  And,
you know-you'll win!  And, so will our nation, including your
children and their descendants.
<P>
<I>An unstoppable force will grow from your personal and business
letters, and contacts, as they add their weight to those from
others.</I>

<h2><center><I><B>Home Ownership And Life Insurance</B></I></center>
</h2>
<hr>
<P>
<I>Home Ownership</I>
<P>
Owning one's home has been a major objective for our citizens
and our nation for well over a century.  Not only has this proven
to be of economic value to all, it has helped maintain and nurture
family values that are so important to any strong nation.
<P>
And, as would be expected, home ownership has proven to be the
largest investment made by most individuals during their lifetimes.
<P>
All of this has been fostered by attractive tax laws that permit
a tax deduction for mortgage interest on this investment, as well
as permitting any gain in the value of a home, to be carried forward
without income tax for lengthy periods of time, including no income
tax on any gain upon death.
<P>
Universal, unlimited, tax-deductible IRAs can further facilitate
home ownership in a very attractive, sound way from both the taxpayers'
and government's perspective.  For example, such IRAs could be
expanded to include an &quot;IRA/Residence Rollover&quot; provision
such as:
<P>
  Up to $15,000 could be withdrawn from a universal IRA without
any income tax, provided the sum is used for a first-time home
purchase.  Note, however, that the individual's basis in the home
would be reduced in like amount.  Thus, Uncle Sam's tax on this
type of IRA withdrawal is deferred, not lost.
<P>
  Upon the sale of the home, the sale proceeds could be rolled
over into the IRA without any income tax.  Note, however, that
the individual's tax basis on the home (including the $125,000
tax-free amount after age 55) is also rolled over into the IRA.
 Thus, the tax otherwise imposed on the sale proceeds is deferred
and not lost to the government.  In effect, the home seller exchanges
an &quot;unproductive&quot; asset (the home) for &quot;productive&quot;
IRA assets (investments).
<P>
Even though the government's taxes would be deferred via this
primary residence rollover option, the government would make money
on this program.  All withdrawals in excess of tax basis would
eventually be taxed at ordinary income tax rates, and the individual(s)
would be giving up a stepped-up basis at death.
<P>
<I>Life Insurance</I>
<P>
A family that is saving and investing for life's later years is
always subject to the calamity of a premature death.  Investments
in life insurance (either term or cash value) should be allowed
in universal, unlimited, tax-deductible IRAs, provided the proceeds
are to be paid into the account, or added to a policy's cash value.
<P>
By fulfilling the family's funding objective, enhanced, tax-deferred
financial resources can be available over ensuing years following
the death of the insured.  These proceeds, like the other account
assets, would be subject to tax upon subsequent withdrawal.

<h2><center><I><B>Entitlements</B></I></center>
</h2>
<hr>
<P>
So-called &quot;entitlements&quot; are government spending programs
that grow automatically without adequate cost control or constraint.
 Typically, these programs are initiated for modest and humanitarian
reasons.  However, their potential future costs are usually unmeasured,
measured improperly, or ignored.  Further, once established, people
become accustomed to their availability, and the benefits provided
become political magnets for enhancement due to inflation, demographic
changes in the population, and the political power of recipients.
 In short, with the passage of time, they become &quot;entitlements.&quot;
<P>
Three existing entitlement programs-Social Security, Medicare/Medicaid,
and federal welfare benefits-involve huge, ever-increasing costs
that, in aggregate when combined with interest on the national
debt, exceed the government's &quot;discretionary&quot; spending
over which it can, if it wishes, exercise control.  The growth
of these entitlement costs is alarming.
<P>
The funding of entitlement programs can only come from one contributing
source-taxpayers.  When these programs were initiated, the then-existing
contributor/recipient ratio was high (many more taxpayers were
contributors then recipients), and the level of benefits was low.
 With the passage of time, the contributor/recipient ratio has
grown much smaller, and the level of benefits has grown much larger.
 This has created an explosion of ever-increasing costs that are
borne by an ever-diminishing segment of the voter/taxpayer population.
 
<P>
Such costs can only be funded by raising taxes or by increased
governmental borrowing.  Income taxes and payroll taxes typically
transfer the economic values generated by one group of taxpayers
to another group as, for example, when younger people's payroll
taxes are used to fund older people's health care costs and pensions.
 Borrowing to cover these costs unethically passes these costs
to another generation.  
<P>
Regardless of the source of funds (tax or borrowing), these uncontrolled
entitlement spendings extract free-market capital from the marketplace.
 This, in turn, makes the economy progressively weaker, thereby
leading to a political/economic climate that fosters further enhancements
of entitlement programs.  This becomes a gradual, but never-ending,
spiral downward toward economic stagnation, unfair inter-generational
transfer payments via the tax code, and ultimate disaster.
<P>
Changing the way our nation taxes saving so that saving is promoted
and not punished can dramatically change the human/economic dynamics
that lead to these entitlements.  Taxpayers will be far better
able to accumulate assets for their retirement and life's potential
needs for health care and welfare.  Not only will free markets
grow more rapidly, thereby enhancing living standards and employment
growth, the need and pressures for entitlement programs will diminish.
<P>
Universal, unlimited, tax-deductible IRAs can do wonders by helping
to remove the ever-increasing and divisive cost burden of entitlements
from our nation's shoulders.

<h2><center><I><B>Family</B></I></center>
</h2>
<hr>
<P>

Personal saving is not just an economic matter for our nation; personal
saving helps build the strong sinews of family life. Family life is, and
should be, the strongest, most cohesive economic force within any nation. 
<P>
Parents, particularly, are always striving to better their lives, in no
small part in order to better help their children and other family
members.  The act of saving creates a storehouse of economic values for
future enjoyment or needs that can smooth and enhance family life. 
<P>
After all, our nation's economic strength and values must always represent
the aggregate economic strengths and values of individuals and their
families, not vice versa. 
<P>
Too often we have seen tax policy mistakenly curtail the individual's and
the family's ability and responsibility to accumulate savings. As a
result, without savings, individuals and families gradually, but
inexorably, become dependent on others or on the state. 
<P>
The ordinary income tax is the classic example of a slow, but
sure, progressive tax abuse of saving.  Other examples include
the misguided imposition of caps and limits on IRAs and on benefit
plans.  Such benefit plans provide advance funding and protection
against economic calamity.
<P>
Plain common sense and the traditional American drive for self-reliance
dictate that it is far better to permit individuals and families
to accumulate the maximum possible tax-deferred savings and investment
they can achieve.  People can better build their own lives and
protections without government interference or dole.  Not only
does this provide more freedom from economic fear, it adds joy,
purpose, and far greater economic health to everyone's life.
<P>
Universal, unlimited, tax-deductible IRAs provide each individual,
and his or her family, a far superior way to fulfill those innate
responsibilities to save and invest for their future needs and
desires.  These family needs, desires, and responsibilities are
intertwined among generations stretching over many years and should
not be curtailed by unwise taxation.

<h2><center><I><B>The Need For Leadership, Initiative, And 
Speed</B></I></center></h2>
<hr>
 <P>
Accountants, actuaries, economists, lawyers, financial officers,
and the leaders of our businesses, unions, associations, and the
media must assume a strong leadership role in forcing our government
to come to grips with its existing budget and revenue estimating
methodologies as they apply to saving.
<P>
Leaders within the private and non-profit sectors of our nation
have failed to seriously address this key issue of &quot;personal
saving&quot; that means so very much to the success of their work
and our nation.
<P>
These individuals, and the institutions that they represent, have
an enormous stake in making certain that remedial legislation
is enacted.
<P>
These people and institutions can have an enormous, positive influence
through personal conversations, meetings, conferences, letters,
newsletters, the media, talk shows, etc.  
<P>
It has been demonstrated in this analysis that universal, unlimited,
tax-deductible IRAs will provide, in aggregate and over time,
far more tax revenue for our government than can ever be derived
from the ordinary income tax treatment of saving.  The exciting,
dynamic financial aspects of such IRAs will add solid growth and
economic strength to our nation.
<P>
The existing methods used by the government for measuring the
IRA's impact on tax revenues are totally destructive.  Tax revenues
are shown as losses where, in fact, ever-growing real revenue
gains exist.
<P>
Because revenue estimates by government scorekeepers allege that
tax-deductible IRAs are billion dollar losers, Congress' existing
revenue neutrality requirements require an increase in taxes elsewhere
to offset the alleged loss from tax deducted saving.  Such erroneous
estimates, and related offsets, create fiscal chaos.
<P>
Huge amounts of economic growth have been, and will continue to
be, totally misdirected, curtailed, and wasted unless these existing
revenue estimation methodologies are completely changed.
<P>
Leaders of professions, labor, businesses, and associations must
lead their groups to demand corrective legislation.  Everyone,
including the government, will benefit.
<P>
<center><blockquote>ENACTMENT OF LEGISLATION TO CREATE UNIVERSAL, 
UNLIMITED, TAX-DEDUCTIBLE IRAS, AS EMBODIED IN INDIVIDUAL INVESTMENT 
ACCOUNTS, MUST BE IMMEDIATE.</center></blockquote>

<B><h2><I><center>Pension Plans Can Become Sensible Again</B></I></center>
</h2>
<hr>
<P>
IRAs are a form of pension.  Pension plans provide an important
and useful way for people to save.  Unfortunately, the effective
use of pension plans, including IRAs, has been more and more hampered
by one punitive change after another in the income tax laws and
regulations.  Most of these changes have resulted from the existing,
erroneous, self-defeating tax revenue estimation methodologies
of our government.
<P>
It is well-known to all pension plan sponsors, administrators,
advisers, and plan participants that pension plan tax laws, rules,
and regulations have reached the ultimate breaking-point in unfathomable
complexity and government micro-management.
<P>
These complexities are driven by the absurdity of trying to make
existing, outlandish, governmental notions of tax expenditure
revenue estimates of tax-deferred saving apply in the real world
of private enterprise.  It can't be done.
<P>
Billions of dollars are spent every year by the professions, industry,
labor, and government on examinations of the complex, interrelated
pension rules and regulations that are impossible to fathom, even
by those in government who create them or write them.
<P>
All of these complexities become unnecessary if unlimited, tax-deductible
IRAs are available.  Such complexities exist because of:  (1)
the erroneous government notion that tax-deductible IRAs and other
qualified plans cost the government mega-billions of dollars of
lost revenue; and (2) the erroneous government perception that
high-bracket taxpayers are favored economically.
<P>
With universal, unlimited, tax-deductible IRAs, employers, unions,
and associations can again arrange their pension plans to fit
their own unique needs and circumstances.  Rather than having
pension plans sponsored by employers, unions, or associations
decline in number, they will increase.  Further, with universal,
unlimited, tax-deductible IRAs, portable pensions become a reality.
 
<P>
Pensions of all types (defined benefit, defined contribution,
401(k), profit-sharing, thrift, annuities, etc.) will grow and
be better funded because of the recognition of the enormous contribution
of universal, unlimited, tax-deductible saving to the financial
well-being of our nation, our government, and of our taxpayers,
individually and collectively.
<P>
The absurdity of the ever-tightening governmental constrictions
on defined benefit pension plan funding is clearly evident when
such constrictions make the funding projections of The Pension
Benefit Guarantee Corporation (PBGC) ever-more alarming.  These
unfathomable, self-defeating, government-imposed pension plan
complexities are leading employers to abandon their defined benefit
plans to the detriment of the PBGC.  In short, the government
is fostering the abandonment of defined benefit pension plans,
with the net result that needlessly underfunded pension plans
are being dropped into the laps of taxpayers via the PBGC!
<P>
All of this convoluted government-created mess can only be corrected
when it is recognized by Congress and the Administration that
the unlimited tax deferral of saving <I>is not contrary to anyone's
interests,</I> including the government's.  It is the responsibility
of plan providers and plan participants to rise up in anger over
such irrational, self-destructive government.

<h2><center><I><B>&quot;Trickle-Down Economics&quot; And &quot;Tax Loopholes
For The Rich&quot;</h2></B></I></center>

<hr>
<P>
Both of the above inflammatory labels have been used to thwart
legislative attempts to improve, expand, and increase the allowable
tax deduction levels of IRAs.  These labels ignore the facts.
<P>
It is correct, of course, that higher-bracket taxpayers also gain
with tax-deductible IRAs.  However, as so clearly shown in this
analysis, this gain is derived solely from the removal of a crushing,
self-defeating, double and triple tax burden on saving that's
imposed by the progressive ordinary income tax.  This tax irrationally
and progressively wipes out the saving accumulations of all taxpayers.
 And, the higher the bracket, the more irrational the second layer
of tax becomes.
<P>
The ordinary income tax should not be applied to saving, because
it is progressively destructive to the government's tax revenues,
as well as the taxpayers' and our nation's wealth.  Under the
ordinary income tax, the higher the tax bracket, the greater the
destruction to all concerned, including the government.
<P>
High-bracket taxpayers should be encouraged to make unlimited,
tax-deducted contributions to IRAs.  Not only does the government
receive far higher tax revenues, the availability of investment
capital for the users of capital (in any tax bracket) is greatly
increased.  This is vital to our nation's economy.
<P>
And, it has been clearly demonstrated in many forums that the
bulk of the benefits derived from increased capital flow to labor.
 The more capital a worker has to work with, the higher is the
worker's productivity, the greater is the demand for his or her
labor, and the higher is his or her real wage rate.  In fact,
if capital doesn't increase more rapidly than labor, productivity,
employment, and real wage rates will not advance.  Increasing
the amount of capital per worker requires reducing the cost of
capital, and that requires reducing the cost of saving.  That's
what tax-deductible IRAs do.  Lowering the cost of capital will
also reduce the cost of government debt.
<P>
Small businesses, entrepreneurs, and job seekers will surely benefit
greatly from capital growth, as will all other taxpayers, both
directly and indirectly.  Without question, the slogans &quot;trickle-down
economics&quot; and &quot;tax loopholes for the rich,&quot; when
applied to universal, unlimited, tax-deductible IRAs, are nothing
but complete red herrings.

<center><h2>"IT'S DRUGS, STUPID," ACU SAYS</h2></center>
<p><strong>ALEXANDRIA, VA.</strong>--- "At a time when the latest statistics indicate marijuana use among teen-<br><br>agers is up 37% and as we face a national crisis on drug abuse, Bill Clinton fiddles while Rome <br><br>burns talking about tobacco use," said American Conservative Union (ACU) Chairman David A. <br><br>Keene. "The way the Clinton Administration and its liberal allies portray it, tobacco is the greatest <br><br>scourge affecting children since the dawn of time and nothing short of a full-blown crackdown by <br><br>the Federal government can solve it. But the real problem is drug abuse and all its associated evils, <br><br>and the Clinton Administration has exhibited a scandalous indifference to the appalling increase in <br><br>illegal drug use."
<p>Keene noted that U.S. Department of Health and Human Services statistics released earlier this month show overall drug abuse among teens is up 78% between 1992 and 1995.  Marijuana use by teen-agers is up 37%, LSD use is up 54%, and cocaine use is up 166%.  He also pointed to a second new government report showing hospital emergency room visits resulting from marijuana abuse is up 96%.  Before Clinton took office, teen-age drug abuse had declined for a decade according to a third survey, conducted by <em>USA Today</em>.
<p>"What's really at work here is a cynical attempt to gain political mileage at the expense of addressing the real problem," Keene continued.  "The Administration, knowing it lacks credibility when it comes to waging the real war -- the war on drugs -- thinks it can cover itself with a phony war on tobacco.
<p>"As early as the 1960's and 1970's, the science was conclusive about the hazards of illegal drug use," Keene said. "But the then-youthful liberals who today occupy top positions in Washington, Hollywood and elsewhere ridiculed the dangers of marijuana and rejected society's disdain over 'hard' drugs.  They agitated to decriminalize marijuana cutlivation, possession and use.  They attacked, then as now, conservatives and other advocates of traditional cultural and moral values.  Today, as adults, they minimize and rationalize their own dalliances in the illegal drug scene.  For example, the President did not say that his own marijuana experimentation was wrong because it was illegal, or dangerous, or manifested anti-social behavior -- he excused himself by saying that he 'didn't inhale.'
<p>"No one, not even the tobacco companies, who are clearly on record about it, think it's a good idea for young people to smoke," Keene added.  "But the liberal establishment's election-year hysteria over tobacco is hypocritical in light of its record on illegal drug policy.  After all, the permissive social and political attitudes of liberalism gave birth to the drug culture.  Many liberals seem unwilling to offer more than lip service when it comes to fighting it and belittle those who try -- as former First Lady Nancy Reagan can attest from experience.  Should anyone take this Administration seriously in its 'holy war' against tobacco in light of disturbing reports of illegal drug use among the White House staff? What moral authority does the President -- a cigar smoker -- bring to bear? Why is the Administration bent on expanding government power and imposing new layers of regulation on the American people in this instance while turning a blind eye and deaf ear to the critical problem of illegal drug use?
<p>"The American people should be asking tough questions," Keene concluded. "If the Administration should make a Federal case out of anything, it's national drug policy. Apparently Clinton has none, since the statistics speak for themselves. We therefore urge the Administration to wake up to the real and growing threat of illegal drug abuse and stop offering political sideshows to sidestep its real responsibilities."
<p>The American Conservative Union, founded in 1964, is the country's oldest grassroots conservative lobbying organization. On behalf of its nearly one million members and supporters, it lobbies on a wide range of issues before the Congress.

<h2>FLAT TAX, SALES TAX, WHATEVER: FOCUS MUST STAY ON<br>
JUNKING CURRENT NIGHTMARISH TAX SYSTEM, ACU SAYS </h2>
</center>

<p>
WASHINGTON, D.C.--- "Some conservatives favor a flat tax, others support a national sales or
value-added tax, still others have different ideas on how best to pay for the legitimate
functions of government. The main thing is, we must not allow differences over those approaches
from causing the tax reform movement to lose sight of the real goal: elimination of the current
Federal income tax non-system, with its enormous bureaucracy, byzantine rules and regulations,
and abuses and outrages. That's why ACU is happy to join forces with those who also recognize
the importance of staying focused on the larger objective," said David A. Keene, Chairman of the
American Conservative Union (ACU), at a "Commitment to Tax Reform" press conference in
Washington, D.C., hosted by Citizens for a Sound Economy.
<P>
     "This year's Tax Freedom Day- - May 7 - - was the latest ever," Keene continued. "When you
add in the hidden costs of government, such as regulations and other expensive burdens,
Americans must labor until July 3 before they're in the clear and able to keep all of what they
work hard to earn. That's an outrage to cause every American's blood to boil. The 105th Congress
cannot allow this level and scope of taxation to continue. The current tax structure is
hopelessly beyond repair and the only sane, fair thing to do is scrap it entirely.
<P>
     "ACU has already launched its own long-term project with the objective of abolishing the
IRS and repealing the 16th Amendment, which authorized the Federal income tax. Yet that does not
mean we cannot join with our friends who argue persuasively for a flat tax in saying with them
that what exists now is a nightmare that must end and that the American people deserve tax
justice," Keene concluded. "The issue is no longer whether or not to end taxation as we know it,
but how soon we will get there. Once we get there, we may find that a flat tax is the way to go,
or that the best option is the national sales tax, or that some other approach is better.
Whatever the outcome, we simply must not lose sight of the objective, we simply must not let
Congress dodge the issue any longer, and we simply must make sure that the American people don't
stop pressing for reform."

conservative lobbying organization. On behalf of its nearly one million members and supporters,

<h2>ON TAX FREEDOM DAY, ACU URGES 16TH AMENDMENT REPEAL </h2>
</center>

<p>


 
ALEXANDRIA, VA.--- "It's Tax Freedom Day. Starting now, Americans can keep what they 
work so hard to earn after having spent the past four months working to pay Uncle Sam's tax 
bill," said American Conservative Union (ACU) Chairman David A. Keene. "With this year's Tax 
Freedom Day being the latest ever, the need for comprehensive tax reform has never been greater. 
That's why ACU is making tax reform its top long-term priority." 
<p>    Keene said that a cornerstone of the ACU effort will be a grassroot-oriented lobbying and 
public education campaign to rally support for repeal of the 16th Amendment to the Constitution, 
which instituted the Federal income tax. 
 
 <p>    "Federal spending, the deficit, the national debt, and the growth of government have been 
spiralling out of control for decades," Keene said. "While the current Republican Congress has 
shown more determination to attack those problems than any in modern times, we have a liberal 
President who refuses to break with the past - - he vetoes every important reform and every 
serious attempt to bring needed change to the way Washington does business. Since the surest way 
to stop the big spenders is to not let them get their hands on the money, the current tax system 
has to go. The enormous tax-gathering bureaucracy, the byzantine rules and regulations, and all 
the abuses and outrages that go with it simply cannot be fixed. The slate must be wiped clean by 
repealing the 16th Amendment, and a sane, fair, workable means of paying for the essential 
functions of government should replace it." 
 
 <p>    Keene said ACU's strategy includes national "Town Meetings" on the tax reform issue, 
distribution of hundreds of thousands of citizen petitions to Congress calling for repeal of the 
16th Amendment and abolition of the Internal Revenue Service, direct lobbying of Congress, 
cooperation with public interest groups also interested in tax reform, and other projects. 

<p>     "The issue is no longer whether to drastically reform our tax non-system, but when," 
Keene added, noting that the issue was a major topic among GOP Presidential candidates and 
continues to rank high on the agendas of key Congressional leaders.  
 
 <p>    "ACU is preparing to buckle down for the long haul," Keene concluded. "We know it may 
take a few years for Congress and the states to complete the process of repeal and for a 
national consensus to be reached on a new and better tax system. ACU's job will be to help make 
sure that Washington does the right thing for the taxpayer, and we'll stay on the job for as 
long as it takes." 
 
<p>     ACU, founded in 1964, is the country's oldest grassroots-oriented conservative lobbying 
organization. On behalf of its nearly one million members and supporters, it lobbies on a wide 
range of issues before the Congress.

                    SURPRISE! IT'S TED KENNEDY </h2>
</center>

<p>
ALEXANDRIA, VA.--- "Ted Kennedy built a career out of portraying every problem, however 
minor, as a crisis of mammoth proportions requiring immediate, massive government intervention. 
How ironic, then, that this same Ted Kennedy is the only one standing in the way of further 
Congressional action on S.1028, the health care legislation of which he is the chief 
co-sponsor," said David A. Keene, Chairman of the American Conservative Union (ACU). "Obviously, 
the Senator from Massachusetts isn't the least reluctant to fiddle while Rome burns when it 
suits his liberal political agenda." 
 
<p>     Keene referred to Kennedy's thus-far-successful parliamentary ploy blocking the 
appointment of Senate conferees on S.1028, the Kassebaum-Kennedy health care bill. Kennedy's 
delaying tactic is an attempt to pressure Senate leaders into not adding supporters of Medical 
Savings Accounts (MSAs) to the proposed list of conferees. 
 
<p>     "Kennedy and his fellow ultra-liberals really aren't interested in true reform, which MSAs 
represent," Keene continued. "They only want to give the American people another dose of the 
same old Big Government elixir. They want to maintain government power and control, limit health 
care choices, and micromanage health care decision-making by patients, health care 
professionals, and the private sector. MSAs offer consumer choice, not government control - - 
and that is why the liberals oppose them. 
 
<p>     "In his vendetta against MSAs - - the most promising health care insurance reform idea 
proposed in years - - Kennedy shows he's all too willing to play inside-the-Beltway politics 
with people's health care. This is hypocrisy at its worst. The American people should insist 
that Sen. Kennedy either get on board for true reform, or get out of the way and let the rest of 
the American people's elected representatives deal with this issue promptly," Keene concluded. 
 
<p>     The American Conservative Union, founded in 1964, is the country's oldest grassroots 
conservative lobbying organization. On behalf of its nearly one million members and supporters, 
it lobbies on a wide range of issues before the Congress.

<h2>AX GAS TAX, ACU SAYS</h2>
</center>

<p>
 
<P>
ALEXANDRIA, VA.--- "A few months ago, President Clinton admitted that he raised taxes too
much and that it was a mistake. That's all the more reason why he should start making amends
now by supporting the growing movement in Congress to repeal his unnecessary 4.3-cent
gasoline tax. If not, the least he ought to do is make a public commitment not to veto a repeal,"
said American Conservative Union (ACU) Chairman David A. Keene. 
<P>
     "The current increases in gasoline prices stem from many factors," Keene added, "and as
the marketplace deals with them, prices will eventually decrease - - but only to a point. The
marketplace can't make tax burdens disappear. The public has been forced to get along with less
thanks to Clinton's various tax increases. ACU says it's high time government went on a diet,
and a good place to start is by junking the Clinton gas tax."        
<P>
     ACU, founded in 1964, is the country's oldest grassroots conservative lobbying
organization. On behalf of its nearly one million members and supporters, it lobbies Congress on

<title>ACU Press Release - REPUBLICANS SUPPORT TAX LIMITS, 
DEMOCRATS STILL BIG SPENDERS</title>

<h2>REPUBLICANS SUPPORT TAX LIMITS, <br>
DEMOCRATS STILL BIG SPENDERS</h2>
</center>

<P>
ALEXANDRIA, VA.--- "The tax-and-spend crowd couldnt escape this time," said American Conservative Union (ACU) Chairman David A. Keene, commenting on the tax limitation Constitutional amendment vote in the House of Representatives this week. "This was a real test of who wants to make it harder for the government to get its hands on the peoples money and who is a big spender. By and large, Republicans passed the test and the Democrats failed."
Republicans voted 219 to 24 to support limits on the taxes government takes. Democrats voted for business as usual by a vote of 160 against tax limits and only 16 for tax limits.
<P>
"All it takes is a simple plurality to raise taxes and increase spending," Keene said. "Because its so easy for Congress to spend other peoples money, thats why were in the fiscal mess we face today. If Congress claims to be serious about getting taxation and spending under control, then it should be prepared to vote for serious measures to do that. The Tax Limitation Amendment was just such a measure. Were pleased that it won the support of a majority in the House, but disappointed that it fell short of the necessary two-thirds. 
<P>
"We urge the American people to ask some tough questions of Congressmen who opposed this measure, to find out why they think it should continue to be so easy to tax, spend, run up the deficit and expand the national debt," Keene continued. "They also should ask these politicians, especially Democrats, why they insist on maintaining a tax-and-spend policy so out of control that Congress needs to pass a Taxpayer Bill of Rights. Isnt it more sensible to change that system so that we dont have to pass laws to protect people from it?"
<P>


Keene rejected a chief argument of opponents that limiting the ability to raise taxes means   restricting the ability of Congress to use taxation as one way to help balance the budget and reduce the deficit.
<P>
"Too many tax-and-spend liberals think taxes first, spending cuts last - - if they think of spending cuts at all. If you give politicians easy access to the money, theyre going to spend it and then some. The answer is to cut off the gravy train. Americans already pay plenty in taxes. Even if Democrats and a few Republicans dont get it, the American people do: cut government spending and stop raising taxes. The two go hand in hand. ACU will keep up the pressure and work to make sure that next time, there will indeed be enough votes to enact this important remedy," Keene said.
<P>
ACU, founded in 1964, is the countrys oldest grassroots conservative lobbying organization, with nearly one million members and supporters.

  By "lower," we do not mean "bad."  The bliss of marriage 
consists in part in the sexual union of spouses.  That union 
is, in the human species, elevated and inspired by the 
rational and moral union that married people enjoy.  A 
lifetime of commitment, chosen and not dictated by 
instinct, sustained by determination in the face of obstacles, 
is the specifically human satisfaction of human sexual 
relations.  In that context, the human family is a reflection 
of the divine nature of man.

Rights: The Regime of the 'Discrete and Insular Minority,'"

Harold W. Horowitz, "Affirmative Action and Equal 
Protection," Virginia Law Review 60:955-974.
  A national marketing survey indicates that the average 
homosexual enjoys a household income of more than 
$55,400, a figure $23,000 higher than the average American 
household.  Homosexuals are far more likely to hold a 
college degree, and far more likely to work in a professional 
or managerial position than average Americans.  They are 
more than four times as likely to travel overseas, or to earn 
over $100,000 annually.  See "Overcoming a Deep-Rooted 
Reluctance, More Firms Advertise to Gay Community," in 
The Wall Street Journal, July 18, 1991, p. B-1.

vote, read as follows:  "Shall there be an amendment to 
Article II of the Colorado Constitution to prohibit the state 
of Colorado and any of its political subdivisions from 
adopting or enforcing any law or policy which provides that 
homosexual, lesbian, or bisexual orientation or conduct, or 
relationships constitutes or entitles a person to claim any 
minority or protected status, quota preference or

  The Federalist, no. 78, Clinton Rossiter, ed. (New York: 
The New American Library, 1961), p. 469.  Alexander 
Hamilton wrote that the "independence of the judges is 
equally requisite to guard the Constitution and the rights of 
individuals";  James Madison, in urging the First Congress of 
the United States to adopt a bill of rights, noted that 
"independent tribunals of justice will consider themselves in 
a peculiar manner the guardians of those rights."  1 Annals 
of Congress (Gales and Seaton, eds., 1834), p. 457.  For the 
Progressive view see J. Allen Smith, The Spirit of American 
Government, pp. 299-300: "In carrying out the original 
intent of the Constitution with reference to property the 
courts have developed and applied the doctrine of vested 
rights-a doctrine which has been used with telling effect for 
the purpose of defeating democratic reforms."
  Robert E. Brown, Charles Beard and the Constitution: A 
Critical Analysis of "An Economic Interpretation of the 
Constitution" (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1956).  
Using the same data that was used by Beard, Brown was able 
to show that as many members of the "predator classes" 
opposed the Constitution as supported it.
  In his essay "On the Jewish Question," Marx had pointed 
out that progressive taxes can be used by the state as an 
effective means to abolish private property:  "when men 
strive to liberate themselves through political emancipation, 
the state can, and must, proceed to abolish and destroy 
religion; but only in the same way as it proceeds to abolish 
private property, by declaring a maximum, by confiscation, 
or by progressive taxation, or in the same way as it proceeds 
to abolish life, by the guillotine" (emphasis original).  Robert

  In 1927, the Progressive historian Vernon Parrington 
made this remarkable reinterpretation of the American 
Founding: "The substitution of 'pursuit of happiness' for 
'property' [in the Declaration of Independence] marks a 
complete break with the Whiggish doctrine of property 
rights that Locke had bequeathed to the English middle 
class, and the substitution of a broader sociological 
conception; and it was this substitution that gave to the 
document the note of idealism which was to make its appeal 
so perennially human and vital."  In the view of Parrington, 
the radical welfare state had been present in America's most 
authoritative documents from the very beginning!  Main

Claremont Institute Briefing #1992-19, October 27, 1992, p. 
3). The cash equivalent of her free health care was $450. 
(According to the California Department of Personnel 
Administration, the state paid $430 in 1992 to Foundation 
Health for HMO coverage for an employee family of three. I 
added $20 because Foundation coverage is more restrictive 
than Medicare and MediCal.) Her Section 8 housing voucher 
was worth $565. (According to HUD, the average one-
bedroom apartment in Los Angeles costs $704 in rent; I 
estimate $60 in utilities for a total of $764; a Section 8 
certificate is worth $764 minus 30% of cash income: $663 X 
30% = $199, and 764 minus 199 is 565.) Thanks to Jennifer 
Nelson for help with these numbers.

* Editors' Note: The idea for this appendix arose during a 
November 1992 segment of the television interview show, 
"Meet the Press."  Its purpose, like that of Appendix A, is to 
demonstrate that Bible-based religious faith is perfectly 
compatible with the principles and traditions of American 
democracy.  Indeed, it is much more so than the facile 
moral relativism of modern liberals.

The political leaders of Hanoi were assured a joyful 20th 
Anniversary of their victory over South Vietnam after 
unwrapping a priceless gift.  It was a retrospective book of 
our involvement in Southeast Asia, authored by former 
Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara, in which one line 
takes precedence over all others:  . . .We were wrong, 
terribly wrong.

<P>
President Clinton, not unexpectedly, has praised the 
book and commended the courage it took to write it.

<P>
Don't for a moment believe that this is a book of self-
deprecation.  It is, instead, a book in which the author 
misses few opportunities to praise himself, even including 
a picture of a mountain he climbed in Wyoming.  He 
modestly concedes that President Johnson wrote in a letter 
that the President never liked or admired anyone more 
than Robert McNamara.  

<P>
It is written in the same kind of confusion in which he 
served as Secretary of Defense:  one sentence contradicts 
another sentence, one paragraph impugns another 
paragraph, one point is made with strength, and then 
nurtured with weakness.  Those with whom he worked, 
including Presidents Kennedy and Johnson, are criticized 
and complimented all at once.  It appears to be his way of 
covering all bases.  Mr. McNamara even devotes one short 
paragraph in praise of the Americans who gave their lives 
in Vietnam.  (It's on page 333 for those who may easily 
miss it.)

<P>
He further writes  that I do not know to this day 
whether I quit or was fired.  Maybe it was both. Maybe.  
Everything seems to be uncertain.  Nevertheless, when all 
the contradictory points, incidents, and dialogues are put 
aside, McNamara clearly blames President Johnson for 
not accepting much of  McNamara's wisdom.

<P>
The book, by its own omissions, encourages the spread 
of an American amnesia, a disease with which President 
Clinton has already been stricken.  Robert McNamara 
stops his history when he departed his job, thereby 
conveniently leaving out the evidence that we were not 
wrong, terribly wrong in becoming involved, but instead 
that our Congress was wrong, terribly wrong during the 
two-and-one-quarter years after our military came home.  
Those two-and-one-quarter years have been wiped from 
America's memory as our amnesia makes us believe that 
when our troops left, Vietnam fell.

<P>
It was January of 1973 when our military engagement 
ended under the Paris peace accords in which both sides 
agreed to be permitted to make periodic replacement of 
armaments, munitions and war material which have been 
destroyed, damaged, worn out or used up after the cease-
fire, on the basis of piece-for-piece. . . .  North Vietnam 
replaced their losses on a four-to-one ratio rather than 
keeping the agreement of piece-for-piece, and the 94th 
Congress of the United States voted against supplying any 
replacements for South Vietnam's losses, stopping all aid 
of any kind to both Cambodia and South Vietnam, making 
defeat inevitable.  In April of 1975, both nations fell.

<P>
We signed those accords because Chapter Four, 
Article Nine of the agreement states that the South 
Vietnamese people shall decide themselves the political 
future of South Vietnam through genuinely free and 
democratic elections under international supervision.  
Article Eleven stipulates the insurance of the democratic 
liberties of the people; personal freedom, freedom of 
speech, freedom of the press, freedom of meeting, 
freedom of organization, freedom of residence, freedom of 
work.

<P>
None of this is recorded in the McNamara book, nor 
will President Clinton remind the American people of 
those accords when, as expected, he gives diplomatic 
recognition to a government that to this day refuses to 
keep its word on an agreement that was the very reason we 
left Vietnam.

<P>
By McNamara concluding the book where he does 
there is no mention of the horrors that came about when 
the communists won the war.  There is not even a footnote 
recording the over one million fleeing boat people, the 
genocide in Cambodia, or the post-war concentration 
camps in Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia.  The morality of 
what we tried to do has been proven by the immorality of 
the victors.

<P>
In the chapter entitled <B>The Lessons of Vietnam</B>, he 
generously sets in print his recommendations for future 
foreign policy.  With the depth of a single piece of saran-
wrap, we are told that we should achieve a nuclear-free 
world in which multilateral decision-making takes place 
within a burden-sharing context, while we assure 
preservation of the global environment.  That should work. 

<P>
It's entirely possible that waiting for Robert McNamara 
to mature may take more time than patience will allow.  It 
is my hope, however, that the time will come when  he 
will review what he wrote in the mid-1990s and conclude 
that his anniversary gift to Hanoi was wrong, terribly 
wrong.

<font size=3><b>The Impact Of The Ordinary Income Tax On Saving<br>
by <a href="/savers/library/tkbio.html">Tom Kelly</a></b></font><br>
<hr>

<b>Executive Summary</center></b>
<P>
The financial strength of taxpayers at all economic levels, as
well as the financial strength of our government and our nation,
is being increasingly eroded year after year by the taxation of
private savings and investment growth.  A change from the ordinary
income tax treatment of saving to an expanded IRA-type tax treatment
of saving would benefit the economy, the taxpayer, and ultimately
the Treasury, too, by promoting higher rates of saving and economic
growth.  An example based on historical market returns on savings
will illustrate this fact.
<P>
Two taxpayers invested $100 of after-tax income in an actual mutual
fund on January 1, 1926.  Sixty-seven years later on 12/31/92
both taxpayers sold their fund.  This sixty-seven year period
included depressions, recessions, wars, and good times, too. 
This period also provides a reasonable illustration of what the
reward to saving might be in the many decades ahead.
<P>
Let's assume that one taxpayer, Larry Lo-bracket, was always in
the 15% tax bracket, and the other, Harry Hi-bracket, was always
in the 50% tax bracket (many, if not most, of those years had
tax brackets exceeding 50%).  On 12/31/92 Larry's $100 investment
was worth $57,708 and Harry's was only worth $9,195.  These compare
with values of $141,940 and $241,296 if Larry's and Harry's income
and investment <I>had not been subjected to the ordinary income
tax.</I>
<P>
In short, the ordinary income tax reduced Larry's otherwise invested
capital by 59% and Harry's by 96%!  Interestingly, Larry Lo-bracket's
loss was <I>four</I> times his tax bracket, and Harry Hi-bracket's
loss was <I>two</I> times his tax bracket!
<P>
In contrast, under a tax-deductible IRA-type plan, Larry would
have avoided the 15% tax ($17.65) on his income, and, thus, his
investment would have been $117.65.  Harry would have avoided
the 50% tax ($100) on his income, and his investment would have
been $200.00.  These larger investments provide the proper IRA
comparison with a $100 after-tax investment by each taxpayer under
the ordinary income tax.
<P>
Larry's <I>after-tax</I> value under the IRA-type plan on 12/31/92
would have been $120,649, <I>as would have Harry's.</I>  The $120,649
after-tax value for each man equals 85% of the $141,940 untaxed
value for Larry and 50% of the $241,298 untaxed value for Harry
(see above).  Larry's loss due to taxes was equal to his tax bracket
(15%), and Harry's loss due to taxes was equal to his tax bracket
(50%).  This is fair and proper taxation.
<P>
<I>As illustrated, under a tax-deductible IRA-type plan, both
men had the same after-tax value, $120,649, because each man's
out-of-pocket contribution consisted of $100, with the government
deferring its tax, i.e., $17.65 for Larry and $100 for Harry.</I>
<P>
Upon the IRA withdrawal on 12/31/92, the government not only recovered
its full tax deferral ($17.65 for Larry &amp; $100 for Harry),
it also enjoyed the entire untaxed, free-market investment return
on these tax deferred amounts.  While collecting the full free-market
growth on these IRA tax deductions, the government gave up the
yearly taxation of investment return and realized gain that it
would have otherwise collected under the ordinary income tax.
 <I>It is this yearly ordinary income tax on investment return
that punishes saving so harshly, and it is solely this second
layer of tax that is properly removed by tax-deductible IRAs.</I>
<P>
As illustrated above, each $100 of a taxpayer's IRA-type <I>net</I>
saving (i.e., <I>net</I> of the tax that's deferred) will enjoy
the same investment growth from the same investment <I>regardless
of tax bracket</I>.  This is so, because there is no further tax
on the <I>net</I> saving.  In short, this means that all of every
taxpayer's investment return and realized gain derived from <I>net
</I>IRA saving is received totally tax free.  This is sound economics,
as well as sound and fair tax treatment, because every dollar
of private saving adds equal economic value to our nation's success,
regardless of the source of the saving, be it from Larry Lo-bracket
or from Harry Hi-bracket.
<P>
The <I>new</I> saving generated by such a proper reversal of our
nation's existing and punitive ordinary income tax treatment of
saving will be very large and ongoing.
<P>
Clearly, the ordinary income tax destroys each taxpayer's investment
values that would otherwise be available for his or her own future
use.  The ordinary income tax also concurrently destroys the capital
available for the economy as a whole.  After all, capital saved
and invested by each taxpayer is used over and over again by others,
thereby generating more production, more jobs, and more taxes.
<P>
The negative bias of the ordinary income tax treatment of saving
has led to an increasing Congressional awareness that corrective
legislation must take place.  As a result, bipartisan legislation,
the Individual Investment Account Act, S. 929 and H.R. 3179, has
been sponsored in the 103rd Congress by Senator John Breaux (D-LA)
and Representative Jim McCrery (R-LA).  Briefly, this Act establishes
IRA-type accounts that permit-
<UL>
<LI>Unlimited tax deductions for all contributions by any taxpayer.<p>
<LI>No tax on the account's investment return or realized gain.<p>
<LI>No penalty taxes nor forced distributions at any age.  Taxes
are paid solely upon withdrawals.<p>
<LI>No income tax nor estate tax at death.  Beneficiary has benefactor's
tax basis.<p>
<LI>Up to $15,000 of tax-deferred &quot;rollover&quot; for first-time
home buyers.  The tax basis of the home is reduced by the rollover.<p>
<LI>The proceeds from the sale of a primary residence may be rolled
over without tax into the tax-deferred IRA-type account, including
the $125,000 tax-free home sale proceeds after age 55.  The account's
tax basis is increased by the former residence's tax basis and
the $125,000 tax-free proceeds.<p>
<LI>The tax-deductible purchase of life insurance, provided the
proceeds are added to the tax-deferred account.
</UL>
<P>
These universal, unlimited, tax-deductible IRA-type plans without
penalty taxes and forced distributions will create such an upsurge
in new saving that any revenue loss will soon be outweighed by
the tax revenue gains arising from a greatly increased saving
rate.  Such increased saving leads to more investment, more production,
reduced costs of capital, more jobs, a higher standard of living,
and yes-more tax collections from sound economic growth.
<P>
The dynamic economic gains that flow from universal, unlimited,
tax-deductible IRAs can be measured in trillions of dollars of
increased GDP (Gross Domestic Product).  And, these GDP gains
translate into net dynamic tax revenue gains vs. the ordinary
income tax.  An appropriate report by the respected economics
consulting firm, Fiscal Associates, and included herein as Appendix
B, forecasts the static and dynamic economic results flowing from
the proposed legislation.
<P>
For example, three years after the adoption of universal, unlimited,
tax-deductible IRAs, a healthier economy would bring in about
$17 billion in new federal tax revenue.  This would offset all
but about $10 billion of static revenue loss, as measured in the
erroneous &quot;tax expenditure&quot; manner utilized by government
analysts.  Within eight years, the real dynamic gains would (a)
fully offset the government's erroneous static revenue losses
and (b)<I> increase most taxpayers' after-tax income by approximately
15% to 20%.</I>  The bulk (85%) of this increase in after-tax
income would flow to taxpayers (including joint returns) with
adjusted gross incomes of under $100,000 per year.
<P>
Further, in a relatively short period of time (years 2000 - 2010),
annual GDP would be $500 billion to $1 trillion higher than otherwise,
thereby creating up to an additional two million more jobs than
otherwise.  Because of faster economic growth, annual tax revenues
would gradually grow each year to 30 billion dollars higher than
otherwise by the year 2010.  By the year 2060, GDP would be $32
trillion higher than otherwise and over 5 million more jobs than
otherwise would be created.
<P>
It is relevant to point out that the government relies upon its
staff-formulated &quot;static&quot; tax expenditure figures when
tax legislation is being considered.  This static tax expenditure
methodology is seriously flawed in that, among other things, it
ignores rational taxpayer reactions to tax law change.
<P>
Moreover, the government's 1995 Budget document admits for the
first time that the present value of its static IRA tax expenditure
figures for 1994 overstates IRA costs by over three times!  Thus,
it can be observed that not only is the government's static method
for measuring revenue loss flawed, the government's own numbers,
even using its own erroneous static method, are three times too
high!  In real life, the more realistic &quot;dynamic&quot; tax
revenue forecasts, as portrayed in this analysis, are superior.
 
<P>
Enacting universal, unlimited, tax-deductible IRA-type plans has
many very favorable, interrelated consequences for taxpayers,
our government, and our nation.  Similarly, there are often-heard
and generally superficial objections to expanding IRA-type plans.
These consequences and objections are addressed individually
and thoroughly in the &quot;perspectives&quot; section of this
analysis.
<P>
<U><I><b><center>Conclusions</I></U></b></center>
<UL>
<LI>The ordinary income tax as applied to saving and investing
imposes enormous, ever-growing economic losses on our nation.
The net result is an ongoing compounding of economic injury to
savers, workers, users of capital, and the Treasury itself.<p>
<LI>The existing governmental tax revenue estimation methods that
neglect the dynamics of saving, and hence completely mismeasure
the tax revenue impact of tax-deductible IRA-type plans, are a
major driving force of our nation's erroneous tax policy as applied
to saving.<p>
<LI>The government's existing methods of estimating tax revenues
from IRA-type plans must be scrapped in favor of a more accurate
estimating process.<p>
<LI>The next sixty-seven years of savings and investment results
will have economic ups and downs not unlike the past sixty-seven.
Thus, the economic results, as portrayed in this analysis, that
flow from continuing the ordinary income tax treatment of saving
are a reasonable harbinger of a dismal economic future for our
nation if this irrational taxation of saving is not corrected
promptly.  On the other hand, tax-deductible IRA-type saving helps
everyone-including the user of capital, the government, and our
nation-not just the taxpayer.<p>
<LI>IRA-type plans must be improved, expanded, and promoted.<p>
<LI>Rather than limiting and discouraging the use of tax-deductible
IRA-type plans by taxpayers, the government should remove all
tax impediments to these plans and extol their use by everyone.<p>
<LI>The ordinary income tax as applied to saving creates an ever-growing
atrophy of the economic strength of taxpayer/voters, the users
of capital, government, and our nation.  Expanded and improved
tax-deductible IRA-type plans will reverse this economic emaciation
and create sound, robust growth.

   <H1>Hitler vs. The United Nations</H1>
   <h2>Liberty and the Bosnian Conflict</h2>
   <H3>By Bruce Herschensohn</H3>

</center>

Hitler was born sixty years too early to serve his ambitions.  Had he come to power in the 1990s instead of the 1930s, he would have won.

<p>
In the 1990s he would have been faced with the United Nations organization and the current leadership of the United States, and they would have offered little resistance.  I do not mean to suggest that they would have done nothing:

<p>
The U.N. forces would have stood at the railway stations, monitoring the families that were split apart among screams and tears.  U.N. monitors would also have stationed themselves outside Buchenwald and Dachau to monitor smoke when it was seen coming from the crematoriums.  But their orders would have been not to take a side in the conflict.

<p>
The United States leadership would adamantly oppose any aid to Great Britain on the grounds that it would "Americanize" the war, and the President would reject any weapons going to the underground movements in Europe, saying this would only "cause the death of innocent civilians."

<p>
In the 1990s the U.S. Presidents foreign policy has turned the nation into a Maxi-Switzerland, with his perception of our military as little more than a uniformed Peace Corps.  But its not only the administration.  Prominent voices in the opposition party are saying that engagement in Bosnia would not be in our national interest.  Are they saying the prevention of genocide would not be in the interest of the people of the United States?  And both major political parties concur that we must not send in U.S. ground troops to help the 
victims of Serbian aggression.

<p>
Without the will, our power (if we still have it), means nothing.  Militarily, Rule Number One is never to announce what <i>will not</i> be done.

<p>
The larger tragedy of contemporary times is that the word "peace" is given more importance than the word "liberty."  As is always the case when peace takes precedence over liberty, neither are achieved.  It is only when liberty is paramount that liberty and peace can both be realized.

<p>
President Lincoln could have had peace easily, saving 500,000 American lives.  He could have done that by ordering U.S. troops from Fort Sumter and allowing South Carolina and any other state to secede from the Union.  And there would have been peace.

<p>
President Franklin Delano Roosevelt could have had peace if on the morning of December 8, 1941 he would have asked Congress, not for a Declaration of War, but for a Declaration of Accommodation with the Axis powers, as an Asian and European War would not be worth the death of one more American.  And we would have had peace.

<p>
President Bush could have had peace in this decade by allowing Sadam Hussein to keep his troops in Kuwait and to allow him entry into Bahrain, Qatar, and Oman.  Surely Sadam Hussein would have sold us oil as he would have needed the dollars.  And there would have been peace.

<p>
In all cases there would have been the peace of the slave for the many, the peace of the master for the few, and the peace of the grave for the rest.

<p>
As President Clinton rejects any troops to protect the Bosnian civilians, he does not rule out 25,000 U.S. troops to safeguard the U.N. forces.  Why does he care more about the uniformed who were misplaced there by the U.N. than about the civilians who were born there--or who went there to be in a U.N. "safe area"?

<p>
What should we do?

<p>
Ignore the U.N.  Lift the arms embargo.  And with or without NATO, bomb all military targets of the Serbs, including all missile deployments, all anti-aircraft sites, all roads, supply lines, bridges, and arms factories, whether in Bosnia or Serbia, all the way to Belgrade with no privileged sanctuaries.  (The lesson we should have learned from the Vietnam war.)  And we should be willing to send in ground troops if necessary after the bombing, and make our willingness known.

<p>
Why should we do this?

<p>
Because were alive at this time.  Our obligation as human beings is to stop the atrocities of which we once said, "Never again."

<p>
But we said that a long time ago.  It was, after all, more than a half century ago that Hitler encountered a difficulty too large for him to overcome. The difficulty was that back then there were leaders in the world who held liberty as the most cherished human right.

What should every schoolchild know about the history of this land of liberty we call America?  The National History Standards Project, sponsored by the National Endowment for the Humanities and the U.S. Education Department, attempted to provide an answer to this
question; however, their report, released in late 1994, contains serious omissions and amusing political correctness.  In response, the Family Research Council prepared <I> Let Freedom Ring!, </I>an outline of U.S. history that avoids political fashion and emphasizes real knowledge of America's past.

Instead of coming up with  a list of New Year's Resolutions for 1997, it appears that our public leaders  are putting together a list of New Year's Irresolutions. </FONT></P>  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR>  At the top of the list is Social Security reform. The advisory council  on Social Security recommends that the private investment market be used  to shore up the nation's endangered old age insurance system. Failure to  do so offers the prospect of higher payroll taxes and benefit reductions  in the years ahead, while prompt action to link Social Security to the  private sector and the &quot;miracle of compound interest&quot; offers  nothing less than capitalistic ownership of the means of production by  the entire workforce and a better retirement for everyone. Seldom has there  been a subject where the choices are so clear and where so many are affected  so deeply. </FONT></P>  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR>  Yet the initial reaction of politicians to the latest call for action is--irresolution.  The typical official response is &quot;cautious,&quot; which in government  lingo means, &quot;Let's punt.&quot; In private, Republicans embrace the  idea and such Democrats as the influential Sen. Patrick Moynihan of New  York acknowledge that it needs to be addressed. Some other Democrats, including  the President, are thought to be supportive of reform. However, excepting  Sen. Kerrey of Nebraska, they are not about to say so. <BR>  </FONT></P>  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Social Security reform is only one of the 600  pound policy gorillas officialdom is determined to ignore in hopes that  maybe they will go away. The solvency of Medicare is still more pressing,  so it will take the full concentration of our leaders to pretend that they  are doing something about that problem while doing nothing.<BR>  The same goes for tax reform, upon which the government also has resolved  to be irresolute. The distilled opinion coming out of the election campaign  was that tax cuts could stimulate growth and stabilize the economy. Dole's  proposed 15% rate reduction across the board may never have caught fire,  and neither did Clinton's parade of &quot;targeted&quot; cuts, but everyone  professed to believe that something could and should be done. Now that  talk apparently can be filed under &quot;Campaign Rhetoric.&quot; </FONT></P>  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Maybe in the information age it doesn't matter  whether the Consumer Price Index exaggerates inflation, the tax code punishes  marriage and raising children and discourages investment. Maybe we have  repealed economic cycles and are fated to plug along with low, but satisfactory  growth. Maybe. But nothing in economics is as seductive--and wrong--as  the impression that present trends can be extended indefinitely into the  future. The statesman knows that and looks ahead. So where are the statesmen?</FONT></P>  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR>  Next on the list of New Years Irresolutions comes the long range foreign  policy of this country. You would think that we had made the world safe  and serene forever and that violence in the Middle East or the Balkans  are simply curiosities on the evening news. Are think tanks and recently  retired generals warning us about reduced fighting readiness in the US  military and demoralization in the ranks over gender issues? Defense can  wait until we discover a breakdown in the course of an emergency. Put it  all on the New Year's Irresolutions List. </FONT></P>  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR>  How about the environmental reforms that both liberals and conservatives  supposedly agree need addressing? Liberal environmentalists professedly  realize that the current, mainly proscriptive laws read great, but are  not really protecting the environment. Conservatives continue to complain  that the same laws handicap the economy and actually make sensible conservation  more difficult. It is time to find a pathway to reform--of the Environmental  Protection Agency, for example, and of the Endangered Species Act, for  another--that aims more at consequences than procedural purity. Any takers?  Or do we put the environment also on the Irresolutions list?</FONT></P>  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR>  Telecommunications mistakes found in the 1996 act? Live with them. Impending  disaster with Amtrak? Hold off hearings until everyone agrees--in the sweet  bye and bye.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR>  The great thing about such a long list of New Year's Irresolutions is that  it frees the body politic to attend to matters that are much more amusing,  if infinitely less important: petty scandals. We already are into the middle  of January and the topic that Congress and the media find most engrossing  is whether Newt Gingrich used non-profit money to organize a partisan college  course, or used political funds to organize a non-partisan college course.  Now, if you don't find that sexy, look to the Paula Jones scandal spread  over the latest issue of Newsweek. What's the future of Social Security,  the solvency of Medicare and the state of America's defenses in comparison  to a soap opera like that?</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE><P><CENTER><BR><B><I>Bruce Chapman, president of the Seattle-based Discovery Institute,writes on this page each Friday.</I></B></CENTER></P><P><CENTER><B><I></I></B>&nbsp;</CENTER></BODY></HTML>

   <H1>Transferring the USIA to the Department of Many Umbrellas</H1>
   <H3>By Bruce Herschensohn</H3>

</center>


<p>
The dismemberment of the Soviet Union has brought many in Congress to the conclusion that the United States can close or cut those foreign policy entities that took a lead role in the Cold War.  As a result, the United States Information Agency (USIA) may soon be slated for takeover by the U. S. State Department, with a commensurate and severe cut in the funds of USIA's radio arm, the Voice of America (VOA).  The VOA could then be virtually destroyed by the Chamerlainesque policies of State.  The hallways of the State Department are lined with dripping umbrellas, even when it isn't raining outside.

<p>
Is the USIA and its VOA still valuable with the Soviet Union gone?  Of course it is.  The death of the Soviet Union does not guarantee that democracy is the one and only outlook for Russia and other former Soviet Republics.  Nor does it mean that totalitarians around the world will applaud U.S. policy.  The VOA is the SDI of information.  Its stories about the United States have balanced the movies, rap songs, and gang activities which many citizens of the world would otherwise think consume this nation.  Its truth-telling of world news and events has encouraged the citizens of the world to accept nothing less than liberty.

<p>
On the sixth anniversary of the Tiananman Square massacre, the VOA's transmitters reached tens of millions of people in China despite their government's attempts at jamming it.  Would our State Department be so insistent?

<p>
When the Nobel Peace Prize recipient, Ms. Saw Aung San Suu Kyi of Burma, was released from house arrest this month, she told reporters that during those six years of confinement the VOA was her outside line to the free world.  Everyday at 6:00 PM she stopped everything to listen to its broadcasts.

<p>
The National Spiritual Assembly of Bahai's of the United States officially expressed its appreciation to the VOA for keeping the Teheran regime of Iran aware of America's commitment to the cause of the Bahai's human rights.

<p>
The representative of the Dalai Lama recently contrasted the truth of the VOA to the propaganda from the People's Republic of China media to Tibet.  He wrote, "The Voice of America's Tibetan Language News Service is the only independent source of news for the Tibetan speaking areas of the world."

<p>
What would our State Department say to Cuba, Burma, Iraq, Iran, North Korea, Vietnam, Serbia, and Libya as it directs the Voice of America?  What would it say to Tibet?

<p>
There are areas of the USIA that I believe can be eliminated without risk.  The Fulbright scholarship programs should not be part of the workings of the federal government and the exchange programs should be served by private institutions.  But the USIA's libraries in 130 countries, its publications, its films and television programs and, of course, the Voice of America, are invaluable allies of those who want to know what the United States is all about, and what liberty is all about, and what truth is all about.

<p>
The 104th Congress is magnificently doing what has not been done since the birth of our nation. Its members, like our Founders, are acting against political nature by giving power to the states, the localities, and the people.  James Madison wrote that the federal government's duties "will be exercised principally on external objects," meaning foreign affairs.  The power now being surrendered by our federal government in foreign affairs will, of course, not revert to the states, the localities, and the people, as it will in domestic affairs.  

<p>
If the USIA is stripped of its influence, that power will not go to the people of California, Iowa, Kentucky, Montana, and Delaware.  It will go to Kim Jong Il, Mu'ammar el-Qaddafi, Fidel Castro, Hafez al-Assad, and Deng Xiaoping.

   <H1>Restoring  Conservative  Unity</H1>
   <H3>By Larry P. Arnn</H3>

</center>

The radical change of the 1994 election was produced by a unity of conservatives as strong as in the days of Reagan.  All the elements of the Reagan coalition functioned together magnificently in the congressional races and a forty-year lock on the Congress was broken.  Economic and social conservatives stood arm in arm.

<p>
Now, that harmony strains and threatens to break.  Last week, a long report on the <i>McNeil-Lehrer News Hour</i> presented a parade of conservatives chastising one another and threatening to break ranks.  Social conservatives threaten to walk away from the coalition if the moral agenda is not given priority.  Economic conservatives claim that religious zealots are attempting to control politics in the name of a faith they do not share.  Of course, the liberal journalist reported all of this with delight.

<p>
The correspondent for <i>McNeil-Lehrer</i> drew the obvious conclusion:  If this division deepens, the chances of the new majority will be ended.  Real reform requires an enduring majority, a majority broadly-based and stable over time. 	

<p>
The warning signs are then apparent, and we can avoid the danger they portend only if we recover the foundation upon which all stable majorities in America must stand.  That foundation lies among the simple truths that were the basis of our country at the beginning.  When our nation stood upon that foundation, no one divided the "economic" from the "social"  issues, and no one fought about the difference between them.

<p>
These simple truths are the central principles of our country.  They address themselves to our status as human beings and citizens, and cover all of our rights and all of our duties. Conservatives should understand that these principles apply just as much and in the same way to the economic as to the social issues, and just as much to the protection of the family as to the defense of private property.  

<p>
These truths receive their finest expression in the Declaration of Independence, where they are described as certain "self evident truths."  They stem from something called "the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God."  What are these truths, and what are these laws?  They have a lot to do with common sense.  They tell us that we are free and equal citizens.  They tell us that we are on the one hand entitled to our liberty and on the other responsible for our own actions.

<p>
First of all, these principles provide the strongest foundation in history for what we now call "economic liberty."  The authors of the Declaration and of the Constitution assert this belief with simple eloquence.  Thomas Jefferson wrote in 1812 that "To take from one, because it is thought his own industry and that of his fathers has acquired too much, in order to spare to others, who...have not, exercised equal industry and skill, is to violate arbitrarily the first principle of association, the guarantee to everyone the free exercise of his industry and the fruits acquired by it."  In the <i>Federalist</i>, James Madison writes that the "chief object of government" is to "protect the different and unequal faculties of acquiring property."

<p>
The right to property is then a sacred right, no less firmly established than the right to speak one's mind or worship God in one's own time and way.  The right to property gives a vital assurance that these other rights can be secured.

<p>
What do these principles say about the importance of moral behavior?  Consider the Virginia Bill of Rights and its assertion "That no free government, or the blessings of liberty, can be preserved to any people, but by a firm adherence to justice, moderation, temperance, frugality, and virtue, and by frequent recurrence to fundamental principles."  

<p>
A conservative movement built upon these ideas would then encourage moral behavior.  It would reform the welfare system for example, because it encourages young women to conceive children out of wedlock.  It would not tax more heavily those who are married than those who are not.  It should support the authority and responsibility of parents over children and the obligations of husband and wife.

<p>
A conservative movement united upon the ideas of the founding would also encourage religion.  George Washington affirmed the importance of religion during his farewell address when he said that "Of all the dispositions and habits which lead to political prosperity, religion and morality are indispensable supports...reason and experience both forbid us to expect that national morality can prevail in exclusion of religious principle."  

<p>
A conservative policy on religion would respect the freedom to practice any religion that encourages good citizenship.  It would not supplant the role of religious and other charities in social welfare.  It would encourage prayer in school and upon public occasions.

<p>
A conservative movement united under these policies would act under the principles of our founding.  It would adhere to the Constitution and those higher laws, the laws of nature and of nature's God, upon which that Constitution stands.  

<p>
Such a conservative unity can lead America from its troubles.  Such a unity can be built only by a people who know as well as Jefferson the meaning of their country, and who fight as bravely as Washington for its principles.

Liberal Republicans in the Senate are at it again, doing their best to derail the conservative
revolution -- and if you don't call or write today, they'll get away with it!<p>

Senator Arlen Specter, Republican of Pennsylvania, has introduced and passed an appropriations
bill for the Departments of Labor and Health and Human Services that reverses the hard-fought
gains we made during House consideration of the measure last month.  <p>

The bill as it came out of the House was the single most dramatic example of the conservative
revolution at work.  Among other things, the House version of the Labor-HHS appropriations
bill:<p>
<ul>
     <li>Ended welfare for lobbyists by placing new restrictions on taxpayer funding for political
     advocacy groups;<br>
    <li> Terminated funding for the Office of the Surgeon General;<br>
     <li>Ended taxpayer financing of abortions through Medicaid;<br>
     <li>Abolished the liberal Goals 2000 Program;<br>
    <li> Overturned President Clinton's executive order barring the use of striker replacements by
     federal contractors;<br>
    <li> Established tough new restrictions on the regulatory authority of OSHA and the NLRB.<br>
</ul>
But Senator Specter stopped the train in its tracks!<p>

Senator Specter -- who has a lifetime ACU rating of just 39, making him the 4th most liberal
Republican in the Senate -- decided to sabotage the work of his party's members in the House,
and refused to even consider any of these tough legislative riders.<p>

As you read this, the Specter version of the appropriations measure may already have passed the
full Senate -- but it's not over yet, because the two competing versions will still have to be
reconciled in a House-Senate Conference Committee.<p>

Call,  write or fax Senator Specter today, and let him know what you think of his arbitrary and
capricious decision to abandon his party's principles and support higher spending, more
regulation, and other failed liberal policies.<p>

You can reach him at:<br><br>

     SENATOR ARLEN SPECTER<br>
     530 Hart Senate Office Building<br>
     Washington, D.C.  20510-Concord, N.H. 03301<br>
     Phone:  (202) 224-4254   FAX (202) 224-1893<br><br>

Or, if you'd like, email your thoughts directly to the Senator at <a href="mailto:Specter@bizserve.com">Specter@bizserve.com</a>
<p>

Remember, it's not too late to act -- but to have an impact on this debate, you must call or write
Senator Specter today!<p>

Tell him you want him to support the original House-passed language in the Labor-HHS
appropriations bill.  Demand that he do his part to further the progress of the conservative
revolution, and overturn four decades' worth of failed liberal policies.<p>

Call or write Senator Specter TODAY and let him know just you think about his decision to
become a turncoat Republican.<p>

Together, we can fight Senator Specter's plan to let business as usual reign on in Washington. 
We'll keep putting the pressure on him here in Washington, but we need the help of good
conservatives like you to make it work at the grass-roots level.  <p>

So contact Senator Specter TODAY, and we'll be able to get a good, tough Labor-HHS
appropriations bill, like the one they originally passed in the House.<p>


Remember -- Senator Specter is running for President. If he has a campaign office in your state,
call there, too.<p>

   <H1><i>United States v. Lopez</i></H1>
   <h2>Restoring a Constitutionally Limited Government</h2>
   <H3>By Edward J. Erler</H3>

</center>

<p>
For the first time in more than sixty years, the Supreme Court has put restrictions on Congress' 
use of the Commerce Clause.  Under the Constitution, Congress is delegated the exclusive power 
to regulate Commerce with foreign nations, and among the states.  Since the New Deal 
revolution, the Supreme Court has allowed Congress to regulate those purely state and local 
matters that substantially affect commerce between states either directly or indirectly.  


<p>
Accordingly, in <i>Wickard v. Filburn</i> (1942) the Court upheld a fine assessed against a farmer who 
planted 12 acres of wheat in excess of the allotment permitted under the federal Agricultural 
Adjustment Act of 1938, even though the excess wheat was used only for private consumption.  
As the Court noted, the wheat supplied a need of the man who grew it which would otherwise be 
fulfilled by purchases in the open market.  Homegrown wheat in this sense competes with wheat 
in commerce.  


<p>
In the intervening years, the Court has routinely deferred to the judgment of Congress whether 
the regulated activity, although on its face not obviously related to interstate commerce, 
nonetheless substantially affected interstate commerce.  The result has been a tremendous 
expansion of centralized federal power over the states.  


<p>
The Supreme Court's recent decision in <i>United States v. Lopez</i> signals that Congress may no 
longer have unlimited discretion to expand its power under the Commerce Clause.


<p>
At issue in <i>Lopez</i> was a challenge to the Gun Free School Zones Act of 1990, which made it a 
federal offense for any individual to possess a firearm at a place that the individual knows is a 
school zone.  Almost all states have laws prohibiting guns in or near schools, and in the Lopez 
case a state indictment was dismissed in order for federal charges to be brought.  


<p>
Chief Justice Rehnquist, writing for a 5-4 majority, declared the act unconstitutional because it 
neither regulates a commercial activity nor contains a requirement that the possession be 
connected in any way to interstate commerce.  In oral argument, the government maintained that 
the presence of guns in schools so disrupts the quality of education that economic activities are 
affected.  Future citizens will be less educated and consequently less productive; the cumulative 
affect on the nation's economic well being will thus be  substantial.


<p>
The danger of accepting such a weak causal argument was pointed out by the Chief Justice.  It 
would allow Congress to regulate <i>any</i> activity that it found was related to the economic 
productivity of individual citizens; including family law (marriage, divorce, and child custody).  
Indeed, the Chief Justice rightly concluded that under the Government's theory it would be 
difficult to perceive any limitation on federal power, even in areas such as criminal law 
enforcement or education where states historically have been sovereign.


<p>
The appropriate constitutional argument was detailed in Justice Thomas' incisive concurring 
opinion.  Thomas noted that in adopting the substantial affects test the Court has drifted far from 
the original understanding of the Commerce Clause.  Indeed, taken to its logical extreme, the 
substantial affects test would give Congress police power over all aspects of American life.  


<p>
Thomas notes that the Court's Commerce Clause jurisprudence comes close to turning the Tenth 
Amendment on its head.  The Tenth Amendment generally reserves the powers not delegated to 
the federal government to the states or to the people.  This is a confirmation of the fact that the 
Federal Government is limited to the exercise of constitutionally delegated powers or to those 
that are reasonably inferred to be a necessary and proper exercise of delegated powers.  


<p>
As Thomas rightly points out, the Commerce Clause that emerged from the New Deal revolution 
allows Congress to exercise all powers not specifically prohibited, thus reversing the federal 
relationship contemplated by the Framers of the Constitution.  The New Deal interpretation of 
the Commerce Clause was explicitly calculated to allow the federal government to extend and 
magnify the reach of its regulatory powers.  


<p>
<i>Lopez</i> is a welcome reevaluation of Congress' power under the Commerce Clause, and it may 
well presage the beginning of a series of decisions that will reestablish the federal relationship as 
envisioned by the Framers.  The threat posed to the administrative state by the Court's decision 
may be gauged by President Clinton's frantic reaction.  Not only has the President severely 
criticized the <i>Lopez</i> decision, but he has also ordered the Attorney General to find a way around 
the ruling!

   <H1>How to Beat the Supreme Court on School Prayer</H1>
   <H3>By Harry V. Jaffa</H3>

</center>

"We are a religious people, whose institutions presuppose a Supreme Being."

<p>
There is no better way to confirm the truth of the foregoing aphorism of the late Justice William O. Douglas, 
than to take a tour through the state constitutions.  Forty-seven of the fifty states have preambles invoking the 
name of Almighty God.  A joint resolution of the Congress could declare that children in public schools might 
lawfully recite voluntary prayers employing only such acknowledgment of divine power and goodness as is 
present in their own state constitution, or in the constitutions of any of the other states.  When this resolution is 
signed by the President--and it is difficult to imagine any reason to object to it--it could take effect 
immediately.  It is also difficult to imagine that the Supreme Court could take exception to such a resolution.  
To do so would not only put it in direct opposition to the elected branches of government, but also would 
require it, in effect, to declare the state constitutions unconstitutional!


<p>
Consider the perfectly nonsectarian piety embodied in the fundamental laws of the states:

<blockquote><i>We the people of Alabama, in order to establish justice, insure domestic tranquillity, and to secure the blessing 
of liberty to ourselves and our posterity, invoking the favor and guidance of Almighty God, do ordain and 
establish the following Constitution and form of government . . .</i>
</blockquote>

<blockquote><i>We the people of the State of California, grateful to Almighty God for our freedom, in order to secure and 
perpetuate its blessings, do establish this Constitution.</i>
</blockquote>

<blockquote><i>The people of Connecticut, acknowledging with gratitude the good providence of God, in having permitted them 
to enjoy a free government . . .</i>
</blockquote>


<p>
This selection should be sufficient to illustrate the consistency in the patterns of all the preambles. Who could 
ask more in a school prayer than to acknowledge that it is through Divine Providence that we enjoy our civil 
and religious liberty, and that we reaffirm our faith in and constant reliance upon God to preserve and 
perpetuate it?


<p>
It is notable that the state constitutions have provisions equivalent to the "no establishment" and "free exercise" clauses of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution.  One example that will suffice for present 
purposes is that of California:

<blockquote>
<i>Free exercise and enjoyment of religion without discrimination or preference are guaranteed.  This liberty of conscience does not
excuse acts that are licentious or inconsistent with the peace and safety of the State.  The legislature shall make no law respecting the establishment of religion.</i>
</blockquote>

<p>
From this it is apparent that the people of the states have seen no inconsistency between the guarantees of 
religious freedom in their constitutions, and the expressions of gratitude to God for the enjoyment of that 
freedom in the same constitutions.

<p>
American constitutions whether federal or state, rest ultimately upon the theology of the Declaration of 
Independence.  This fact has been obscured by the domination of a legal positivism which is simply unable to 
understand the relationship between natural and divine law on the one hand, and human law on the other.  Yet 
this relationship was axiomatic for our Founding Fathers.  If however we ask why we have an obligation--that 
is to say, a moral duty--to obey the laws, either of our State, or of the United States, there is only one answer.  
It is because those laws exist "to secure these rights," rights with which we have been "endowed by [our] 
Creator."  Constitutional governments have no other purpose but to render valuable rights whose origin is 
altogether independent of human will, rights which are unalienable because they are fixed eternally in "the laws 
of nature and of nature's God."  Through the ages many governments which did not respect the rights of the 
individual have claimed to be based upon the consent of the governed.  But the consent of the governed 
required by our republican constitutions is derived from the equal and unalienable rights of each human person.


<p>
Legal positivists deny to the Declaration any role in constitutional interpretation.  However, according to the 
United States Code, adopted by the Congress, it is the first of the Organic Laws of the United States.  That this 
is not merely formal or ceremonial is shown by the fact that every enabling act by the Congress for the 
admission of a State to the Union since the Civil War has had the following provision.  


<p>
<blockquote>
<i>The Constitution of the State of ______ shall always be republican in form and shall not be repugnant to the 
Constitution of the United States and the principles of the Declaration of Independence.</i>
</blockquote>


<p>
It can be seen that the rights secured to us by the human law, whether of the states or of the United States, are 
means of implementing antecedent rights whose origin is in a Supreme Being.  It is difficult to imagine how we 
can teach citizenship to future citizens, without inculcating in them an understanding of and a reverence for this 
origin.

FRC's staff of public policy experts -- and extramural family experts recommended by FRC -- are frequently called to testify before Congressional committees debating pending legislation or seeking guidance on vital family issues.  FRC also routinely submits unsolicited testimony to House and Senate Committees open to informed public opinion.  Topics range from the mundane and technical to the speculative and controversial.  Congressional testimony represents one of FRC's prime educational functions as a nonprofit organization located in the nation's capital.

<CENTER><H3> End Federally Funded Abortion</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<B> OBJECTIVE</B>:  There are 13 appropriations bills that fund U.S. government agencies and pro-grams.  These bills are voted on annually, and they originate in the House of Representatives.  During the Clinton administration, federal money has been used directly or indirectly for abortion through various appropriations.  The 104th Congress, however, has the opportunity to delete this funding or restore previous restrictions on tax dollars paying for abortion.  Also, the House Leadership has instructed the appropriations subcommittees to cut funding for programs that have not been "reauthorized" or approved by separate legislative committees.  For example, the Title X family planning program has not been reauthorized since 1985, but it continues to receive funding through the appropriations process.
<P>
<B> BILLS AND SPONSORS</B>:  The chairman of the powerful House Appropriations Committee is Rep. Bob Livingston (R-LA).  However, legislative action takes place first in various Appropriations subcommittees that have jurisdiction over the particular department or programs.  The sub-committee chairman plays a key role and can include the desired language in the subcommittee "mark", or bill.  A subcommittee version goes to the full committee for consideration and then to the House floor.  The key subcommittees and chairmen are:  Labor/HHS/Education (Rep. John Porter [R-Ill.]); Treasury, Postal Service, General Government (Rep. Jim Lightfoot [R-Iowa]); and District of Columbia (Rep. Jim Walsh [R-N.Y.]).
	<P>
<B> STATUS</B>:  Since the government's new fiscal year begins on October 1, these bills will be in the forefront during the next few months.
<P>
<B> SUMMARY AND RATIONALE</B>:  
<P>
<UL> 
<LI>The current Hyde amendment applies only to programs under the jurisdiction of the Department of Health and Human Services, such as Medicaid.  The Hyde language was "expanded" in 1993 to include payment for abortions in the case of rape and incest.  The fiscal year 1995 Labor/HHS bill contained this language.
<P>
<LI>A key issue to be decided will be language introduced by Rep. Ernest Istook (R-OK) that blocks the Clinton administration's interpretation of the "expanded" Hyde language.  Under that interpretation, the state pays for poor women's abortions whenever the abortionist claims the pregnancy resulted from rape or incest.  Many states have stricter policies, allowing payment only in the case where the mother's life is endangered.  Rep. Istook tried to offer this corrective amendment during the "first 100 days" of Congress, but was persuaded not to and was promised a vote later in the year.
<P>
<LI>Also, attempts will be made to cut funding via the National Institutes for Health for human fetal tissue research, human embryo research, and RU-486 research.  Furthermore, Rep. Tom DeLay may offer an amendment to eliminate Title X family planning, which funds Planned Parenthood and distributes contraceptives to teens without parental permission.   The Senate Budget Resolution recommended defunding the Office of Surgeon General.  If the Appropriations Committee follows through, Dr. Henry Foster will have no job as Surgeon General, whether or not he is confirmed by the Senate. 
<P>
<LI>The Fiscal Year 1995 appropriations for Treasury, Postal Service, and General Government did not contain language prohibiting participating health plans from paying for Federal employees' abortions through the Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHBP) program.  FEHBP provides health care benefits for 9 million federal employees.  The government (taxpayers) pays about 60 percent of the cost and the employee pays the rest.  In previous years, the Smith/Ashbrook amendment had been attached which restricted FEHBP-participating health plans from funding abortion.  This language should be reinstated.
<P>
<LI>The Fiscal Year 1995 District of Columbia appropriations contains a prohibition on the use of  "federal" funds to pay for abortions, which is meaningless, since DC can use "local"  funds.  These funds are commingled with federal funds since DC's funds are appropriated by the U.S. Congress.  Language is needed to ban all congressionally appropriated funds, both "federal" and "local," for abortion on demand in the nation's capital, a city where the number of abortions is comparable to the number of live births.
</UL><P>
<B> PROSPECTS:  </B> Majority support should be there for these appropriations bills in the House, but that will not be the case in the Senate.  In the first test vote on abortion in the House on May 24, the pro-life position (an amendment offered to the foreign aid bill by Rep. Chris Smith) prevailed by 59 votes.  President Clinton must sign the appropriations bills if he wants the money to run the government for fiscal year 1996.  

<P>
<LI><B> Prohibit D & X Abortions</B>
<P>
<B> OBJECTIVE</B>:  To ban a particularly heinous method used to perform late-term "partial birth" abortions carried out on unborn children as early as 20 weeks of gestation and as late as 32 weeks.   
<P>
<B> BILLS AND SPONSORS</B>:  Rep. Charles Canady (R-Fla.), Chairman of the House Subcommittee on the Constitution, along with Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde (R-Ill.) will introduce legislation in early June to ban "partial birth" abortions, or as they are more commonly known, "dilation and extraction" or "D & X" abortions.
<P>
<B> STATUS</B>:  The House Subcommittee on the Constitution held a hearing on June 15 which focused on the D & X abortion procedure, fetal pain, and a constitutional analysis of the legislation.   
<P>
<B> SUMMARY AND RATIONALE</B>:  American Medical News, (July 5, 1993) devoted a front-page article to the gruesome D & X abortion procedure.  The article explained the step-by-step procedure.  First, the unborn baby's legs are pulled into the birth canal.  Next, the abortionist delivers the baby's entire body, except for the head.  The abortionist jams scissors into the baby's head, inserts a catheter and sucks the brains out.  The dead baby is then "evacuated."  
<P>
<B> PROSPECTS</B>:  As a starting point, this legislation seeks to build public support for further prohibitions and an ultimate ban on all elective (non-life-of-the-mother) abortions.  While specifically intending to prohibit late-term abortions, this legislation and corresponding Congressional hearings will educate the public about the humanity of the unborn child and the horror of abortion.  Sadly, this basic public education is still greatly needed.  There should be widespread support for this measure, although some will argue that abortion is legal and that this is not a common procedure because late-term abortions are "rare."
<P>

<CENTER><H3> Retain Forced-Abortion Asylum Policy </H3></CENTER>
<P>
<B> OBJECTIVE</B>:  Language included in the pending foreign aid and State Department reauthorization bill (H.R. 1561) would reinstate a Reagan-Bush policy that provided asylum to those who can prove a well-founded fear of persecution for resisting the People's Republic of China's grotesque and coercive population control program. 
<P>
<B> BILL AND SPONSORS</B>:  Rep. Chris Smith (R-N.J.) added this language to the foreign aid bill when it was before the International Operations and Human Rights Subcommittee in May.  Rep. Smith is the subcommittee chairman.  The provision remained intact throughout the full committee's deliberations and became part of the foreign aid bill, known as the American Overseas Interests Act (H.R. 1561), to be considered by the House of Representatives. 
<P>
<B> STATUS</B>:  Rep. Patricia Schroeder (D-Col.) will likely seek to delete this key provision on the House floor when the House resumes consideration of H.R. 1561.  
<P>
<B> SUMMARY AND RATIONALE</B>:  Despite fears by some anti-immigration groups that the number of immigrants entering this country will soar, it is important to note that from 1987 through 1993, when the forced-abortion asylum policy was in effect, less than 200 people per year were granted asylum on these grounds.  This is a humanitarian policy and should be reinstated.  President Clinton revoked this pro-life policy soon after he took office.  This policy has real implications for Chinese families living in the U.S. who face imminent deportation and persecution, if it is not adopted quickly.  On Good Friday (April 14), the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) moved 13 Chinese women to a deportation holding center in Bakersfield, Calif.  Five of these women had fled China after being forced to have abortions.  Others had been forcibly sterilized, or had escaped after being ordered to undergo abortions and/or sterilization.  It appears that their deportation is imminent unless Congress passes H.R. 1561 with the forced-abortion asylum provision intact.
<P>
<B> PROSPECTS</B>:  The anti-immigration lobbyists are stirring up some fears, but the fact that a militantly "pro-choice" Member of Congress (Rep. Patricia Schroeder) is their champion undercuts their ability to appeal to the pro-life majority in the House.  Rep. Schroeder will be hard-pressed to explain why she isn't more sensitive to the fact that Chinese women don't have any "choice" about abortion.  However, President Clinton has threatened to veto H.R. 1561 for other reasons, mainly because it significantly cuts foreign aid.  If the House cannot override the veto, Rep. Smith would have to find another vehicle to enact the forced-abortion asylum policy.  
<P>
<CENTER><H3> Adopt the $5,000 Adoption Tax Credit </H3>
</CENTER>
<P>
<B> OBJECTIVE</B>:  The $5,000 adoption tax credit is a pro-family measure that would help to reduce some of the financial obstacles associated with adopting a child.  It enjoys strong support in the House, but has weaker support in the Senate. 
<P>
<B> BILLS AND SPONSORS</B>:  The $5,000 adoption tax credit was a primary component of the House GOP's Contract with America.  The provision -- adapted from Rep. Chris Smith's (R-N.J.) Omnibus Adoption Act, H.R. 1066 -- was passed by the House as part of H.R. 1215, the tax cuts package sponsored by Rep. Bill Archer (R-Tex.) and unveiled before an FRC audience.
<P>
<B> BUDGET RESOLUTIONS</B>:  In order to make the $5,000 adoption tax credit a reality, the provision must be included in the budget for each fiscal year.  The first step in that process is the budget resolution, which serves as a blueprint for the appropriating of funds in the final budget.  The House recently passed an historic budget resolution for fiscal year 1996, sponsored by Rep. John Kasich (R-Ohio).  The resolution balances the budget by the year 2002, and includes the $5,000 adoption tax credit in its proposed tax cuts.
<P>
In contrast, the Senate's budget resolution would balance the budget by 2002 but failed to include the adoption tax credit (or any other tax cuts).  Sen. Phil Gramm's (R-Tex.) tax relief amendment (which included the adoption tax credit) was defeated by a vote of 69-31.
<P>
<B> STATUS</B>:  The House and Senate versions of the budget resolutions will now be melded together to produce one budget known as reconciliation.  It remains to be seen whether the $5,000-per-child adoption tax credit will be maintained in the final version.
<P>
<B> SUMMARY AND RATIONALE</B>:  This provision would make adoption a more affordable choice for prospective adoptive parents by allowing them to receive a tax credit of up to $5,000 for quali-fied adoption expenses, including adoption fees, court costs, and attorney fees, among others.  This provision is important because it reduces the financial obstacles that might otherwise hinder middle- and low-income families from adopting.  [The average cost of an adoption is between $10,000 and $15,000.]  It is also an important step in encouraging the adoption choice -- a choice which benefits the birth mother, the adopted child, and the adoptive parents.
<P>
<B> PROSPECTS</B>:  Much depends upon the reconciliation of the two budget resolution versions.  If the Senate and, most especially, the members of the House-Senate conference committee on the budget can be convinced of the importance of pro-family tax cuts, prospects are good for the passage of the $5,000 adoption tax credit.
<CENTER><H3> Coercive Abortion Training Threatens Accreditation of Hospitals </H3></CENTER>
<P>
On February 14, 1995 the 23-member Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) voted unanimously to pass new regulations mandating that all medical residents specializing in obstetrics and gynecology be trained to perform elective abortions.  Individual residents expressing moral and/or religious objections to abortion would, presumably, be able to opt out of the abortion training, but common sense suggests that they will face strong pressure to undergo the new "standard" training.  Medical schools with a religious affiliation that oppose abortion would not be required to provide abortion training directly, but they would be required to arrange for such training for those students who do not object.  Many religious medical schools currently reject any affiliation whatsoever with abortion providers.  
<P>
Programs which fail to comply with the new regulations risk losing their accreditation.   However, over the last 20 years, the number of medical schools offering elective abortion training to their residents has declined.  In 1976, 92.5 percent of U.S. medical schools offered first-trimester abortion training, either on a routine or optional basis.  In 1991, 68.8 percent of medical schools offered first-trimester abortion training.  About one third of medical schools refuse to provide abortion training due to moral and/or legal reasons. 
<P>
<B> BILLS AND SPONSORS</B>:  Rep. Pete Hoekstra (R-Mich.) plans to offer legislation in June that would reverse this coercive directive.  The legislation would "protect individuals, entities and programs from discrimination on the basis of their refusal to be trained, to train, or to arrange for training in the performance of induced abortion."  Senator Dan Coats (R-Ind.) is prepared to introduce similar legislation in the Senate. 
<P>
<B> STATUS</B>:  The House Economic and Educational Opportunities Oversight and Investigations subcommittee examined this issue during a hearing on June 14.  Witnesses included several medical directors of OB/GYN departments at public universities or hospitals who oppose the new requirement and a representative from ACGME.
<P>
<B> SUMMARY AND RATIONALE</B>:  Congressional action is necessary to reverse this coercive policy.  Accreditation status qualifies teaching hospitals to receive federal reimbursement (from Medicare and Medicaid) for services which medical residents provide to patients.  Moreover, doctors must ordinarily graduate from accredited training programs to get certified as competent in their specialties.  
<P>
<B> PROSPECTS:  </B> Rep. Hoekstra's legislation may be attached as an amendment to health care legislation, such as the Health Professions Education Consolidation and Reauthorization Act.

</CENTER><P><CENTER><H3> Getting Back to the Basics:  Disestablishing the U.S. Education Department</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<B> OBJECTIVE</B>:  Education has been traditionally -- and constitutionally -- a responsibility of states and localities.  But since the U.S. Education Department was founded in 1979, it has followed the iron law of bureaucracies, seeking to expand its range and influence.  Legislation is needed to take educational decisions from the hands of federal bureaucrats and return them to parents, teachers, and communities.
<P>
<B> BILL AND SPONSORS</B>:  On May 24, 1995, the Back to the Basics Education Reform Bill was introduced.  This bill's main sponsors are Joe Scarborough (R-Fla.), Steve Chabot (R-Ohio), 
and John Boehner (R-Ohio).  Members of the House Education Task Force are among the cosponsors.
<P>
<B> SUMMARY AND RATIONALE</B>:  Within one year of passage, this bill would shut down the U.S. Education Department.  Many programs, including Goals 2000, would be repealed, while general funding for elementary/secondary and higher education would be converted to two block grants for the states.  The only stipulation is that 98 percent of a state's block grant be passed on to the local level.  Authorization for the block grants would last just three years, at which time the bill proposes that a tax cut for families replace the block grants.  A few functions of the Department would be transferred to more appropriate agencies:  Impact Aid to the Department of Defense, Indian Education to the Department of the Interior, Civil Rights to the Department of Justice, Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) and student loan programs to the Department of Health and Human Services.  The proposal goes beyond talk of shuffling offices and putting a new sign on the door; it takes a serious step towards removing the federal government from our schools.  The proposed tax cut would further reduce the government's influence over education.  Increased revenue for parents would empower them to make more decisions about their children's education.
<P>
<B> PROSPECTS</B>:  President Bill Clinton has already promised the National Education Association (NEA) that he would "remember who put me here."  He will clearly veto legislation that eliminates the NEA's primary representative in the federal government, the Education Department.  However, the executive office cannot authorize expenditures which have not been appropriated by the House.  The House Republican Budget Resolution zeroes out funding for the U.S. Education Department by 2002.  That improves the prospects for the Back to the Basics Education Reform Bill.
<P>


<P>
<CENTER><H3> Getting Back to the Basics:  Repealing Goals 2000</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<B> OBJECTIVE</B>:  Ignoring parental pleas for education to get "back to the basics," the 103rd Congress adopted Goals 2000, a program which further centralized education, increased bureau-cracy, and added a host of new non-academic programs.  It was described by supporters as a new pattern for local-state-federal partnership in education.  The debate has now shifted to limiting the federal role in education.  Goals 2000, representing the height of federal intrusiveness into schools, should be the first program to be dismantled.
<P>
<B> BILLS AND SPONSORS</B>:  On May 10, Rep. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) offered an amendment in 
the House Economic and Educational Opportunities Committee to repeal Goals 2000.  The committee did not vote on the motion at that time, but Rep. Graham plans to raise the issue again later this year.  That same day, the committee voted in favor of H.R. 1045, a bill to abolish the National Education Standards and Improvement Council (NESIC), which was created by 
Goals 2000.  Opportunities Committee chairman Bill Goodling (R-Penn.) is sponsoring the bill. 
<P>
<B> DATE INTRODUCED</B>:  H.R. 1045 was introduced on February 24, 1995.
<P>
<B> STATUS</B>:  The House passed H.R. 1045 soon after the bill was reported out of committee.  Legislation to remove the opportunity-to-learn (OTL) standards from the law may be introduced later this summer.  A bill to repeal the whole law should appear later this year.
<P>
<B> SUMMARY AND RATIONALE</B>:  NESIC would have functioned much like a national school board by reviewing and certifying state and national standards.  There is a general consensus that this is an inappropriate function for the federal government.  OTL standards shift the focus of reform back to increasing inputs into education, which requires increased spending.  We know that spending does not drive academic performance.  OTL standards should be removed from the law.  However, the Goals 2000 agenda will carry on as long as block grants to states continue.  Education reform at this historic moment calls for a reduction in the role of the federal government in American schools and a return to the traditional role of school:  teaching students the basics like reading, writing, and arithmetic.  A decisive first step will be the repeal of Goals 2000, which subverts education reform with more federal regulation and spending.     
<P>
<B> PROSPECTS</B>:  H.R. 1045 should see minimal opposition, but the U.S. Education Department will fight fiercely to maintain its new conduit for imposing policy on the local school:  Goals 2000.  But the department is on the defensive.  Gov. George Allen of Virginia has announced that he will not accept Goals 2000 funding for his state.  Across the nation, parents are outraged by the implentation of Goals 2000 in their local schools.  The U.S. Education Department's new partnership has turned against them:  it is being attacked from all sides -- federal, state, and local.
<P>

<CENTER><H3> Promote Parental Choice in Education </H3>
</CENTER><P>
<B> OBJECTIVE</B>:  As evidence of the academic failure of our monopoly public school system mounts, legislation is needed to help parents choose a safe, academically successful public, private, religious or home school for their children. 
<P>
<B> BILLS AND SPONSORS</B>:  Sen. Dan Coats (R-Ind.) and Sen. Joseph Lieberman (D-Conn.) have introduced S. 618, a bill to spend $30 million on 10-20 demonstration projects.  It would allow low-income parents of students in inner-city schools to choose among public, private, and religious schools.  In addition, FRC is considering alternative legislation to grant a tax credit to parents who choose private, religious or home schools or who select a public school different from the one to which their children have been assigned. 
<P>
<B> DATE INTRODUCED</B>:  March 24, 1995 (Coats-Lieberman).
<P>
<B> STATUS</B>:  Coats-Lieberman is in committee. 
<P>
<B> SUMMARY AND RATIONALE</B>:  Sens. Coats and Lieberman offered this legislation in the 103rd Congress.  It was narrowly defeated in the Senate last year (52-41).  Their proposal has since gained the interest and support of prominent columnists, such as neoconservative Ben Wattenberg and E.J. Dionne, writer for the liberal Washington Post.  The purpose of the bill is to fund what are called demonstration projects.  Sponsors believe that when poor parents choose schools, the evidence we gain from this experiment will be so positive and so compelling as to clinch the argument for parental choice in education.  Because this bill would benefit low-income, inner-city students, who are disproportionately minority children, its backers believe that the idea will overwhelm the usual liberal case against parental choice.  Advocates of the public school monopoly generally argue that parental choice in education is elitist, that it will "re-segregate" the public schools, that private and religious schools merely "skim off" the best students.  Some pro-family advocates, however, argue that the Coats-Lieberman bill would expand the federal role in education at a time when the goal of dis-establishing the U.S. Education Department is a higher priority.  A better solution at the federal level may be tuition tax credits.  FRC is considering legislation which would allow all parents to retain a portion of their earnings for the purpose of selecting safe, excellent schools for their children.  This legislation would enable parents to select among public, private, religious or home schools.  It would protect the integrity of independent schools since there would be no cash transfer from the government to the schools. 
<P>
<B> PROSPECTS</B>:  Despite arranging for quality private schools for their own children, Bill Clinton and Al Gore will vigorously oppose parental choice legislation which includes non-public schools.  Coats-Lieberman therefore faces a veto threat.  Tuition tax credit legislation would face a gauntlet of liberal opposition and senators who stubbornly regard any family tax relief as a "giveaway,"  but it could benefit by being referred to a more friendly committee.

<CENTER><H3> Adopt the $500 Per-Child Tax Credit</H3>
</CENTER><P>
<B> OBJECTIVE</B>:  The $500 per-child tax credit is a pro-family measure that would help to relieve some of the tax burden on parents.  It enjoys strong support in the House, but has weaker support in the Senate.
<P>
<B> BILLS AND SPONSORS</B>:  The $500 per-child tax credit was an integral part of the American Dream Restoration Act, the "crown jewel" of the Contract with America, which passed as part of H.R. 1215 (sponsored by Rep. Bill Archer [R-Tex.]).  The credit is non-refundable (meaning that it only reduces taxes; it does not provide cash welfare to those with no tax liability).  This serves to target the bulk of the tax savings to middle-income families in the 15 percent tax bracket.
<P>
The House recently passed its fiscal year 1996 resolution, sponsored by Rep. John Kasich (R-Ohio), to balance the budget by the year 2002, and it includes the $500 per-child credit in its proposed tax cuts.  The Senate's resolution, though it also balances the budget by 2002, included no tax cuts, as Sen. Phil Gramm's (R-Tex.) amendment to add the per-child tax credit to the budget resolution was rejected in the Senate.  It remains to be seen whether or not the $500 per-child tax credit will survive once these budget resolutions are melded into one budget by the two houses.   
<P>
<B> STATUS:  </B> The fate of the $500 per-child tax credit is uncertain.  While Sen. Gramm's amendment to the budget resolution was defeated, Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole has indicated that he intends to secure a significant per-child tax credit in the budget resolution conference committee meeting with the House.  In addition, Sen. Dan Coats (R-Ind.) and Sen. Rod Grams (R-Minn.) have pledged to offer amendments on the Senate floor calling for the $500 per-child tax credit if the Senate Finance Committee, headed by Sen. Robert Packwood (R-Oreg.), continues to balk at offering pro-family tax relief.
<P>
<B> SUMMARY AND RATIONALE</B>:  FRC has been calling on Congress to adopt pro-family tax relief for many years.  Today, the average family of four contributes 25 cents on every dollar in income taxes and payroll taxes to the U.S. government, compared to 2 cents on every dollar in 1950.  In light of this, the per-child tax credit is designed to help offset the extraordinary erosion in per-child income tax benefits over the last half-century.  Passage of significant pro-child tax relief should be a top priority in the ensuing months of Congress.  
<P>
Streamlining government spending and permitting families to keep more of their own income -- for things like dental appointments and clothing purchases and electric bills -- benefits both the national economy and the personal economy of families.  Immediate pro-family tax relief should be a part of any government plan to balance the budget and make government more efficient.  In the months to come, it will be interesting to see if the Congress as a whole and the Senate in particular heard Americans last November and will give American families the opportunity to keep more of their own money.
<P>
<B> PROSPECTS</B>:  At this point, the fate of the per-child tax credit is uncertain.  However, if the Senate and, most especially, the members of the conference committee on the budget can be convinced of the importance of pro-family tax cuts, prospects are good for passage of the $500 per-child tax credit.

<P>
<CENTER><H3> Broaden IRA Eligibility to Non-Employed Spouses</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<B> OBJECTIVE</B>:  To help alleviate the financial burden on families in which one spouse stays at home.  Legislation to allow expansion of IRA benefits to non-employed spouses would help provide relief for families who choose to have one spouse stay at home and would recognize the important contribution that non-employed spouses make to the income production of employed spouses -- an acknowledgment commonly made in divorce settlements.
<P>
<B> BILLS AND SPONSORS</B>:  The Family Reinvestment Act (H.R. 1040), introduced by Rep. Bill Baker (R-Calif.), allows full-time homemakers and wage-earning spouses a deductible IRA contribution 
of up to $2,500 each; this was passed in the House as part of the Contract with America.  (Furthermore, this legislation permits families to borrow from their IRA for education expenses or to buy a home, with the provision that the funds be paid back to the family with interest.)  Similar legislation, the IRA Equity Bill (S. 287), has been introduced in the Senate by Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-Tex) and allows deductible contributions of up to $2,000 by non-employed spouses.  
<P>
<B> STATUS</B>:  It is important that the Senate pass legislation to help relieve the tax burden on families.  The House bill was passed as part of the Contract with America.  
<P>
<B> SUMMARY AND RATIONALE</B>:  Along with the attractive idea of expanding the uses of IRAs to help free-up family finances (e.g., penalty-free withdrawals to cover major housing, education, and health expenses) is the proposal to broaden the eligibility of IRA's to include non-employed spouses.  While broadening the eligibility of IRA's in general would primarily benefit upper-middle- and upper-income taxpayers, a more targeted broadening of the eligibility to non-employed spouses would provide relief primarily to middle-income families with children -- those most in need of pro-family tax relief.  Currently, two-earner couples can claim almost twice the benefits as single-earner couples, penalizing those families who choose to stay home with their children and ignoring the significant contribution the full-time homemaker makes to the income production of the employed spouse.  Passage of legislation to help level the playing field for single-earner families is a key step to providing relief to American families.
<P>
<B> PROSPECTS</B>:  The battle for IRA benefits for non-employed spouses must be won in the Senate, as pro-family House legislation has been passed already.  It is crucial that the Senate give priority to measures that promote pro-family tax relief. 
Support Medical Savings Accounts
<P>
<B> OBJECTIVE</B>:  In the ongoing effort to reform health care, it is important to support any positive measures which would make health care more cost-effective for families.  Medical savings accounts, or Medical IRAs, are one such measure.  Making the option of medical savings accounts available to employees and unemployed individuals would encourage more prudent use of health care dollars and promote greater family autonomy in health care decisions.
<P>
<B> BILL AND SPONSORS</B>:  Reps. Bill Archer (R-Tex.) and Andrew Jacobs (D-Ind.) have formulated legislation promoting medical savings accounts.  The proposal would amend the existing tax laws to create cost-effective incentives for employers to offer, and for employees to choose, medical savings accounts.  Rep. Archer expects to introduce his bill in mid-June and has said that many of his colleagues in the House have expressed great interest in cosponsoring such legislation.
<P>
<B> STATUS</B>:  The bill is currently being "scored" by the Congressional Budget Office to see what impact, if any, the reform will have on the overall budget, e.g., whether it is budget-neutral,  whether it will save money, or whether it will require the allocation of additional federal funds.  
<P>
<B> SUMMARY AND RATIONALE</B>:  Medical savings accounts (MSAs) are similar to individual retirement accounts (IRAs) in that pre-tax dollars up to a certain limit may be set aside for lower-level medical expenses to be controlled by and used by families.  MSAs usually supplement catastrophic health insurance coverage, helping to cover medical expenses before the insurance deductible is reached.  Because individuals are directly responsible for the use of their health care dollars, MSAs guard against the overutilization of health care services, thereby helping to curb skyrocketing health care costs.  Moreover, individuals reap the rewards of managing their health care dollars wisely and of practicing good habits, for any monies not spent by the end of the year may be kept by the individual as taxable income, or kept in the account for future health care needs.
<P>
MSAs also promote greater autonomy in health care choices.  Because MSA funds may be used toward any medical expenses, including those not expressly covered within the insurance deductible, an individual has more flexibility to choose health services and providers and more portability of coverage (i.e., ability to keep coverage even when changing jobs).
<P>
Furthermore, evidence indicates that MSAs work well.  Golden Rule Insurance company recently conducted a survey of their employees who are covered under MSA plans.  The results show that (1) MSA enrollees saved money and reduced overall health care spending, and that (2) MSA enrollees were highly satisfied with their plan -- fully 88 percent prefer the MSA plan to other health insurance plans they had in the past.
<P> 
<B> PROSPECTS</B>:  The idea of MSAs is not new; therefore, many members of Congress are already familiar with and support the concept.  MSAs should have a good chance of passage in the 104th Congress, especially considering the fact that MSAs were a key component in many Republicans' health care reform proposals last year.

<CENTER><H3> Implement the Gay Ban</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Most Americans thought the military homosexual issue was resolved with the passage of a law.  Wrong.  The Clinton Administration ignored the law when it wrote the implementing policies and lifted the ban anyway.  Now, the Administration is using the courts to get around public opinion and scuttle the ban by building a case that will lose in the Supreme Court.  That's why new legislation is imperative.
<P>
Pentagon and Justice Department officials have told FRC that what we thought was an exclusion policy is really an accommodation policy which permits homosexuals to serve.   So far, Congress has ignored this swindle by failing to exercise its constitutional responsibility to enforce military regulations.
<P>
The Pentagon policy that took effect February 28, 1994 differs in several ways from the law it purportedly implements:
<P>
<UL><LI>The law carries the statement, "homosexuality is incompatible with military service."  The Clinton regulations omit it. 
<P>
<LI>The law forbids service by homosexuals.  The Clinton regulations permit service by homosexuals.  At least 15 avowed homosexuals are now serving openly.
<P>
<LI>The law relies on commander discretion to initiate investigations.  But the Clinton regulations create a "criminal-like" standard.  According to Secretary of Defense William Perry, if soldiers attend gay pride parades, frequent gay bars, and possess gay materials, this does not constitute "credible" evidence to initiate an inquiry.
<P>
<LI>Contrary to 200 years of military experience and practice, Clinton's Defense Department no longer acknowledges homosexual behavior as a marker for increased security risk.  Information discovered during a security investigation cannot be used without high-level political permission.
<P>
<LI>Although the law permits asking about homosexual acts and orientation at the point of admission and whenever appropriate, the Clinton Administration refuses to do so.</UL>
<P>
In the first court test of the new law, the Clinton Justice Department failed to use key arguments and called no witnesses.  
<P>
On March 30, 1995, Judge Eugene Nickerson of the Eastern District of New York ignored volumes of case law precedents and struck down the military's "don't ask, don't tell" policy.  The case is<I> Lieutenant Colonel Jane Able, et al. v. United States of America</I>.
<P>
The Justice Department did not bother to:
<P>
<UL><LI>Dispute biased research and testimony by "expert" pro-homosexual witnesses.
<P>
<LI>Present well-documented physical and psychological problems with homosexuality.
<P>
<LI>Show that homosexual "lifestyles" and "values" jeopardize morale and unit cohesion.
</UL><P>
FRC's Military Readiness Project (MRP), with senior advisors former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Thomas M. Moorer and former Marine Corps Commandant Robert H. Barrow, is lobbying Congress to amend the 1996 Defense Authorization Act.  Should the <I> Able </I>case be heard by the Second Circuit Court of Appeals before the law is changed, irreparable damage may be done.
<P>
FRC's MRP wants the following changes included in the 1996 Act:
<P>
<UL> <LI>Require the Secretary of Defense to ask all potential recruits whether they are a homosexual or have engaged or intend to engage in homosexual acts.
<P>
<LI>Require the Secretary of Defense to revoke current policy and issue regulations consistent with the law.
</UL><P>
TheDefense Authorization Act will come to a final vote in early August.  Some members want to avoid another debate over homosexuals in the military and will try to torpedo any amend-ments.  However, without legislation the courts will have the final say on an issue which  constitutionally belongs to the Congress.  And the Clinton Administration will continue to keep more homosexuals in the military, thus undermining combat readiness, legal defense of the ban, and the moral fabric of the nation.  The stakes are extremely high.  If the military falls, federal power will be used to validate the rest of the homosexual agenda, including gay "marriage" and adoption of children.
<P>
Senators Phil Gramm (R-Tex.) and Dan Coats (R-Ind.) have both expressed concern and may take legislative action.

<CENTER><H3> Cable Porn</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<B> OBJECTIVE</B>:  Some cable TV operators include channels featuring pornographic material in their basic cable subscriptions.  This increases access to pornography, particularly by young people.    
<P>
<B> BILLS AND SPONSORS</B>:  Rep. Tony Hall (D-Ohio) and Rep. Chris Smith (R-N.J.) introduced the Family Viewing Cable Television Act of 1995 (H.R. 1540) on May 2, 1995.  The bill forbids cable operators from including pornography in basic cable packages.  
<P>
<B> STATUS:  </B> H.R. 1540 is currently pending before the House Judiciary Committee but no hearings have been scheduled.
<P>
<B> SUMMARY AND RATIONALE</B>:  Currently, many consumers are forced to accept channels featuring pornography as part of their basic cable package.  This makes it more difficult for them to protect their children.  The bill would secure the right of parents to keep their television safe for family viewing.  It would not outlaw pornographic material on cable television.  Rather, the bill would merely prohibit operators from automatically including it in basic cable packages.  Consumers wishing to have pornographic channels on their cable systems would be free to do so, but they would simply have to request them from their cable company.  
<P>
<B> PROSPECTS</B>:  The bill is facing opposition from industry lobbyists and advocates of unrestricted free speech.  Supporters may offer it as an amendment to another bill if hearings are not scheduled soon.
<P>
<CENTER><H3> Promote Porn-Free Technology</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<B> OBJECTIVE</B>:  The growth of technology has created many exciting opportunities.  Unfortunately, it is also being used to expand access to pornography.  Many on-line computer networks such as the Internet operate largely unregulated and are a virtual no-man's land where material is exchanged without regard to laws on obscenity and indecency.  Legislation is needed to bring computer networks into compliance with obscenity and pornography laws.
<P>
<B> BILLS AND SPONSORS</B>:  The Communications Decency Act of 1995 (S. 314) introduced by Sen. Jim Exon (D-Neb.)  
<P>
<B> DATE INTRODUCED</B>:  February 1, 1995.
<P>
<B> STATUS:  </B> The bill has been incorporated as an amendment to the Telecommunications Competition and Deregulation Act of 1995 (S. 652).  The telecommunications bill has been reported out of committee and is awaiting floor action. 
<P>
<B> SUMMARY AND RATIONALE</B>:  The Communications Decency Act amends current dial-a-porn laws regulating obscenity and indecency to include computer technology.  Without questioning Sen. Exon's intentions, many pro-family groups, including the Family Research Council, fear that the bill in its present form might actually create more problems than it solves.  Computer industry lobbyists have hit Sen. Exon hard, resulting in significant weakening of S. 314 since February.  FRC and other groups are working with Sen. Exon and other senators to develop a strong law that incorporates the original goals of  S. 314.
<P>
<B> PROSPECTS</B>:  FRC will continue to work with Sen. Exon to try to restore S. 314.  Meanwhile, several alternative proposals are in the works.  Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) intends to add an amendment to the telecommunications bill which would instruct Attorney General Janet Reno to "study" the problem of computer porn.  Sen. Leahy's approach is a do-nothing approach which pro-family groups will oppose.  If Sen. Exon's bill does not improve, parents might see help from Sen. Dan Coats (R-Ind.) or Sen. Charles Grassley (R-Iowa) who are working on solutions that are more in line with pro-family concerns.

<CENTER><H3> Military Profits from Pornography</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Military exchange managers are responsible to select magazines based on sales volume, customer preferences, and, in the case of pornographic material, whether it fits the definition for "obscenity" outlined in the 1973 Supreme Court case of Miller v. California.  At present, the services oppose removing so-called "soft" pornography from exchange shelves because of  the perceived threat of legal action from the American Civil Liberties Union.  
<P>
Obscenity was legally defined by the Supreme Court in the Miller v. California decision.  According to this ruling, something is obscene and therefore unprotected by the First Amendment when it satisfies the following criteria:
<P>
<UL> <LI>Taken as a whole, appeals to a prurient interest in sex.
<P>
<LI>Depicts sexual conduct in a patently offensive manner.
<P>
<LI>Taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political and scientific value.
</UL><P>
These criteria were written to protect freedom of speech and expression.  But there are kinds of speech and expression not protected by the Constitution: slander, libel, perjury, false advertising, conspiracy, yelling "fire" in a crowded theater, copyright violations and child pornography.  The military has determined that certain "soft" pornographic material is protected (not obscene) and should be sold to uniformed patrons in government stores.
<P>
Pornography is sexually explicit material intended to arouse the consumer.  It is addictive and very often leads men to sexual crime.  This fact should persuade military leaders to judge wisely between two competing outcomes: the damage attributable to addictive pornographic material versus an ACLU lawsuit.  For now, the government is more fearful of an ACLU lawsuit.  
<P>
The government has much experience selling addictive merchandise to military patrons.  For example, it has sold alcohol, a potentially addictive substance, to servicemembers for most of the military's 200-year history.  Admittedly, most alcohol users avoid addiction, but enough do become addicts and they cost the services dearly -- productivity losses, personal injury, judicial expenses and property damage.
<P>
Pornographic material is much like alcohol; it is a very powerful stimulant.  The consumer begins with limited exposure -- "soft" pornography sold in military stores.  In some cases a  desire for sexually explicit material grows to require more explicit, more deviant images for the consumer to reach a previous level of sexual stimulation.  Gradually the addict is desensitized to the more explicit material.  Finally, he may act out sexually his pornographic fantasies prompted by the material.  These activities may include compulsive promiscuity, exhibitionism, group sex, voyeurism, having sex with children, rape, or sadism.
<P>
Serial killer Ted Bundy stated just before his execution for the sexual assault and murder of many women, "You are going to kill me, and that will protect society from me.  But out there are many, many more people who are addicted to pornography, and you are doing nothing about that."  Bundy blames his addiction to pornography for his mental state that led to his murdering as many as 31 women.
<P>
No pending legislation mandates the removal of pornographic materials from military exchange shelves, but President Clinton has the unilateral authority to do so.  Military consumers can purchase the material without the government's help.

<CENTER><H3> Combat Illegitimacy in Welfare Policy</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<B> OBJECTIVE:  </B> The current welfare system promotes family breakdown by guaranteeing a right to cash benefits even if one engages in irresponsible conduct.  Moreover, the bureaucratic arrangements that spring up to administer those benefits supplant voluntary organizations that offer real help -- the kind of help that changes lives.  Any legislation that attempts to reform welfare must end the entitlement status of numerous welfare programs, including AFDC cash benefits, and afford states the maximum flexibility to experiment with anti-poverty efforts that impose behavioral requirements (charitable alternatives, in particular).
<P>
<B> BILLS AND SPONSORS</B>:  House bill, H.R. 4, "The Personal Responsibility Act."  Senate floor action is expected.
<P>
<B> STATUS</B>:  In March, the House passed The Personal Responsibility Act as part of its Contract with America.  The welfare reform bill will reach the Senate floor later this summer.  While the Senate Finance Committee did vote to eliminate the federal guarantee of cash assistance in favor of a strategy that "block grants" money to the states, the committee bill fails to ensure that illegitimacy remains a prominent focus of the debate on the floor.  The House bill, H.R. 4, included three essential provisions to strengthen families:  a prohibition on cash payments to mothers under age 18 who bear children out of wedlock; a freeze on benefits for mothers who bear additional children while on welfare; and incentive bonus payments to states that reduce illegitimacy rates -- without increasing the number of abortions.  While the Senate bill does not include any of the essential provisions that were incorporated in the House bill, at least four senators have indicated that they will fight to restore the focus on family breakdown.  Family groups expect either Senator Bob Dole (R-Kans.) or Senator Phil Gramm (R-Tex.) to lead the  initiative.
<P>
<B> SUMMARY AND RATIONALE</B>:  Given the consequences for the individual child, the surrounding community, and the national polity, bringing a baby into this world without a sense of sacred responsibility cannot be regarded as a morally neutral act.  Congress should now recognize that it is also wrong to promote such activity by subsidizing it.
<P>
"The task," Charles Murray concludes, is to "neutralize whatever is impeding the age-old impulse of human beings to form families. . . .  A major change in the behavior of young women and the adults in their lives will occur only when the prospect of having a child out of wedlock is once again so immediately, tangibly punishing that it overrides everything else."  Eliminating grants to unwed teenage mothers will be necessary, though not sufficient, to restore the integrity of the family unit.  
<P>
Frances Perkins, chief architect of Franklin Roosevelt's welfare policy, opposed extending federal entitlements to unmarried mothers because she foresaw that subsidizing illegitimacy would escalate family breakdown.  It would be ironic at best if the current majority in Congress were to find themselves to the left of the most liberal member of the Roosevelt Administration, because they rejected that intuition, now confirmed by years of sad experience.
<P>
<B> PROSPECTS</B>:  While Congress is almost certain to pass a welfare bill this session, the fate of the illegitimacy provisions is uncertain.

<P>
<CENTER><H3> Zero Out Title X</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<B> OBJECTIVE</B>:  Title X of the Public Health Service Act was enacted in 1970 as a grant program to fund family planning projects throughout the country.  The program helped to spawn the proliferation of family planning clinics within states, granting federal sanction to the distribution of contraception to unmarried women and to minors without parental consent.  Having received over $193 million from taxpayers last year, funding for this unauthorized and failed program should be eliminated altogether.
<P>
<B> BILLS AND SPONSORS</B>:  Title X of the Public Health Service Act receives its funding through the Labor/HHS Appropriations bill which comes before Congress for a vote every year.  Neither the House nor Senate budget resolutions included a proposal to zero out Title X funding.  However, House Majority Whip Tom DeLay (R-Tex.) has promised to bring an amendment to the House floor to defund Title X if funding is not eliminated in committee.  Sen. Tom Coburn (R-Okla.) and his state's Congressional colleagues, Reps. Ernest Istook and Steve Largent, are also working to zero out Title X funding.
<P>
<B> STATUS:  </B> Efforts to defund Title X are in progress. The Labor/HHS Appropriations bill will be considered by Congress this summer.
<P>
<B> SUMMARY AND RATIONALE</B>:  The reasons to defund Title X are numerous.  First of all, Title X should not continue to receive funding because it is an unauthorized program.  Its authorization expired in 1985.  Secondly, Title X is duplicative.  Several other programs such as Medicaid and the Maternal and Child Health Block Grant provide family planning to low-income and other targeted populations.  There is no clear basis for the federal government to run a categorical family planning program when state governments have the capability to set health care priorities within the parameters of an alternative block grant.  Finally and most importantly, Title X is a failed program.  Since the inception of Title X, out-of-wedlock births, abortions, and sexually-transmitted diseases have all risen dramatically, especially in the populations Title X is supposed to have targeted.
<P>
<B> PROSPECTS</B>:  Expect a huge fight pitting pro-abortion, pro-contraception groups intent on saving Title X against pro-family, pro-life groups working to defund the program.  Because Planned Parenthood receives a good portion of Title X monies, expect them to launch a campaign to save the program.  Outcome of a floor fight is uncertain.
<P>
Another approach, which may or may not prevent a floor battle, could be far more effective.  Overall grant reform may eliminate Title X funding without targeting any specific program.  For example, Congress could pass a law saying that no funds shall be appropriated to any program unless that program is currently authorized.  This is a justifiable reform in light of the efforts to balance the budget and the recently passed law eliminating unfunded federal mandates to states.  Thus, Title X funding might be eliminated on the basis of its unauthorized status.  However, if such grant reform passes, it is probable that pro-abortion members of Congress may try to bring Title X up for reauthorization.  Prospects to successfully reauthorize Title X are slim.  However, without such grant reform, funds could still be appropriated to unauthorized programs.
<P>
<CENTER><H3> Derail the AIDS Gravy Train</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<B> OBJECTIVE</B>:  The federal government, all told, is spending $7.1 billion on AIDS through several government agencies in fiscal 1995.  The Public Health Service alone spends about $2.9 billion yearly ($91,355 per AIDS death contrasted with $1,060 for every cancer death).  Other federal expenditures come from HUD, Social Security, Veterans Affairs, and the Agency for International Development.  Legislation is needed to bring AIDS spending in line with money spent on other terminal diseases such as cancer.  And AIDS funds should not go toward the promotion of homosexuality in the guise of  "AIDS education."  Time-tested epidemiological responses such as early diagnosis and partner tracing should be employed.
 <P>
<B> BILLS AND SPONSORS</B>:  Congress seems prepared to take a business-as-usual approach to AIDS.  On April 3, Sen. Nancy Kassebaum's (R-Kans.) Ryan White Comprehensive AIDS Resources Emergency (CARE) Act (S. 641) provides $4.3 billion over the next five years, beginning in fiscal 1996, and allows for "such sums as may be necessary," a budget-busting possibility.  Other sponsors include Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.) and Majority Leader Robert Dole (R-Kans.).  A House version was introduced by Henry Waxman (D-Calif.) on January 4, 1995.
<P>
<B> STATUS</B>:  The Senate bill was passed out of the Labor and Human Resources Committee.  Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) has put a legislative hold on the bill.  No hearings have been scheduled.
<P>
<B> SUMMARY AND RATIONALE</B>:  Much AIDS money goes to legitimate activities, such as HIV research and care for AIDS victims.  A significant amount, however, goes to politically active groups that promote the radical homosexual agenda.  Congress needs to hold hearings to examine how the money has been used so far.  All funding to groups that promote homosexuality should be cut, leaving more money for groups that deal with AIDS in a medically responsible fashion.  Current AIDS education funding should be terminated, since the money is going toward promotion of condoms and the myth of  "safe sex" instead of documentably successful abstinence education.  And spending formulas should be changed:
<P><OL> 
<LI>Only those infected with HIV or AIDS who need care should receive benefits.  Formulas based on "AIDS prevalence" distort funding needs, because they count the dead along with the living.  More of the money should go to under-served minority communities.
<P>
<LI>People with HIV or AIDS should qualify where they currently live, not where they were diagnosed.  Someone might be diagnosed in a large city but return home elsewhere for care.
<P>
<LI>Means testing for AIDS dollars should be introduced.  Those with adequate insurance should not be in the same pool with those who truly have no other means of payment.</OL>
<P>
<B> PROSPECTS</B>:  Fifty-five senators have signed on as sponsors, but hearings could result in positive changes.  Sen. Dole's role is pivotal if the bill's abuses are to be addressed.  
<P>
<CENTER><H3> Defund Federal Promotion of Homosexuality</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<B> OBJECTIVE</B>:  The Clinton Administration mandated AIDS/Awareness Training for all Federal employees.  Some of this training is used to promote homosexuality.  Legislation is needed to defund this training.
<P>
<B> BILLS AND SPONSORS: </B>  S. 25 -- To stop the waste of taxpayer funds on activities by government agencies to encourage their employees or officials to accept homosexuality as a legitimate or normal lifestyle.  Sponsor: Senator Jesse A. Helms (R-N.C.)
<P>
H.R. 862 -- To prohibit the use of Federal funds to promote homosexuality.  Sponsor: Represent-ative Robert K. Dornan (R-Calif.)
<P>
<B> STATUS</B>:  H.R. 862 -- was introduced February 8, 1995, and was assigned to the Subcommittee for Human Resources and Intergovernmental Affairs of the Government Reform and Oversight Committee. 
<P>
S. 25 --  was introduced January 4, 1995, but is unlikely to be voted on until late summer or 
early fall.
<P>
<B> PROSPECTS</B>:  Congressman Dornan's strategy is to amend all appropriations bills to include this language.  H.R. 862 will not likely be passed as a stand-alone bill, and thus, the Senate strategy is likely to be similar.
<P>
<B> OVERVIEW</B>:  President Clinton directed all federal departments to provide HIV/AIDS training.   According to many federal employees, the mandatory training promotes homosexuality and includes unnecessarily graphic explanations.  A Defense Department worker complained that her training included a slide show of  "sex toys" and flavored condoms.  Other workers were lectured that their grandmothers probably had engaged in sodomy as a form of birth control.
<P>
Two supervisors and 41 employees in the Federal Communication Commission's audio services division chose not to attend mandatory "AIDS Awareness Training."  An FCC employee stated, "The classes are basically an adult version of high school sex ed., with the modern-day sensitivity training thrown in."
<P>
Department of Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary created "Walkin' the Talk" AIDS training materials for three-hour, mandatory training sessions.  A memo from the Department's Federal Workplace HIV/AIDS Education Coordinator states, "All employees are required to complete this training."
<P>
The training includes a brief history of HIV and a discussion of symptoms, prevention, and risk reduction.  There also is a discussion of needle-sharing and sexual contact.  Federal employees are told to reduce their HIV contraction risk by practicing "safer sex" by using barriers like condoms, dental dams, plastic wrap, and latex gloves.  The manual states, "A dental dam 
(a small, square piece of latex) or plastic wrap may be used for any oral-vaginal or oral-anal contact.  All types of barriers (condoms, dental dams, and plastic wrap) are effective against HIV transmission only if they are used correctly and consistently from start to finish."
<P>
The Energy Department makes a disclaimer: "HIV is transmitted without regard to gender, age, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, religion, or identification with any group.  For this reason, we avoid referring to high risk groups."  Not identifying "high risk groups" is irresponsible.  The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention HIV/AIDS Surveillance Report shows that at least 87 percent of AIDS victims either contracted the virus from homosexual encounters or by sharing needles.
<P>
Probably the most outrageous example of government-sponsored AIDS training was done for the Forest Service.  It took place in the Forest Service's Tahoe Region on May 6, 1994 and was conducted by a local health official with degrees in sexology, a self-described homosexual phlebotomist (individual who draws blood), and an HIV-positive woman from the community.
<P>
The phlebotomist was an ex-convict who tried to debunk "homophobic" misconceptions.  He speculated that many husbands were involved in homosexual affairs.  He showed a variety of condoms and how to apply them to a life-size replica of erect male genitalia.  He even explained a technique for using one's mouth to apply the condom.  He also explained the proper cleaning techniques when sharing hypodermic needles.
<P>
The Forest Service also has a training booklet entitled, "Valuing Diversity."  Inside the booklet are statements such as: "Fact: Psychological and social influences alone cannot cause homosexuality....Fact: A biological (genetic, hormonal, neurological, other) predisposition toward homosexual, bisexual, or heterosexual orientation is present at birth in all boys and girls."  No source for these "facts" is provided, nor could there be.  So-called genetic studies on homosexuality are flawed and typically conducted by homosexual activists.
<P>
AIDS/HIV awareness training and diversity training have become vehicles for promoting homosexuality in the federal government.

<CENTER><H3> Restore Combat Exemptions for Women</H3></CENTER>
<P>
The Clinton administration has removed 250,000 combat exemptions for women.  Women can now be assigned to more than 80 percent of all military positions -- many combat-related.  Meanwhile, Congress has failed to host hearings to examine the recommendations of the 1992 Presidential Commission on the Assignment of Women in the Armed Forces, which opposed many of the recent changes.  The Administration, with Congressional neglect, has advanced a feminist agenda without regard for readiness. 
<P>
Secretary of Defense William Perry promises, "Our over-arching goal is to maintain a high-quality, ready and effective force.  By increasing the numbers of units and positions to which women can be assigned, the military services gain greater flexibility in the development and use of human resources."
<P>
The Clinton Administration has not explained how liberalization of the female assignment policy will accomplish the goal of maintaining "a high-quality, ready and effective force."  According to Mr. Perry, these changes are intended to expand "the opportunities for women in the military."
<P>
The Administration's decisions to end more exemptions for women have no justification in military necessity and will hurt readiness:
<P><UL>
<LI>There is a sufficient number of male recruits, especially now that the military is downsizing.  
<P>
<LI>No new scientific studies refute the findings of the 1992 Commission on the Assignment of Women in the Armed Forces, which recommended that "military readiness should be the driving concern regarding assignment policies."
<P>
<LI>The American people still support a go-slow approach to expanding military roles for women.
<P>
<LI>America's likely adversaries still assign only men to their militaries because they know that national security interests cannot be sacrificed to social experimentation.</UL>
<P>
On October 6, 1994,  Representative Ike Skelton (D-Missouri) of the House Armed Service Committee's Subcommittee on Military Forces and Personnel hosted the only hearing since 1991 to consider assignment policies for women.  Although Mr. Skelton began the hearing by stating, "Women should not serve in direct ground combat," and, "I'm of the opinion that second place does not count on the battlefield," he limited the two-hour hearing to one three-member panel which supported the Administration's changes.  Rep. Jon Kyl (R-Ariz.) had asked to hear dissenting views from a panel of commissioners from the 1992 Presidential Commission on the Assignment of Women in the Armed Forces.  His request was denied.
<P>
Article 1, Section 8 of the Constitution gives the Congress the responsibility to "raise and support armies" and to "provide and maintain a navy."  Congress also must make the rules and regulations that govern the military, and that includes the number of women in the military and their assignments.
<P>
The 104th Congress should conduct a thorough review of Pentagon policies and seek to reverse the Clinton administration's current course.  No hearings or bills are pending.
<P>
<CENTER><H3> Off The Dole: No Taxpayer Support for Special Interests</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<B> OBJECTIVE</B>:  In Washington, DC some of the most intensive lobbying is done by recipients of taxpayers' money.  Using the funds received from awards, grants and contracts, these government-created special interests lobby Congress for continued, and often increased, taxpayer support.  Moreover, many of the programs created are hostile to the values of the citizens whose money is used to fund them.
<P>
<B> BILL AND SPONSORS</B>:  On March 3, 1995, Rep. Robert Dornan (R-Calif.) introduced the Integrity in Government Act (H.R. 1130), which would prohibit recipients of taxpayer money from lobbying for continuation of their funding.  The bill is currently cosponsored by Rep. Ernest Istook (R-Okla.) and Rep. Mel Hancock (R-Missouri).  
<P>
<B> STATUS</B>:  The Integrity in Government Act is currently before the House Committee on Government Reform and Oversight.
<P>
<B> SUMMARY AND RATIONALE</B>:  The bill is designed to keep taxpayer money out of lobbyists' hands.  It is carefully worded so that it applies only to lobbying for continued support of various programs and agencies.  It does not apply to recipients of entitlements such as Social Security and Medicare.   Nothing in the legislation restricts or interferes with individual citizens' ability to communicate with their elected representatives.  
<P>
The Integrity in Government Act does not have many friends among the special interest groups that are so prevalent in Washington.  Many Members of Congress do not want to support the bill for fear of the money and power of these groups or because they like the idea of taxpayer money being used to lobby Congress for causes they favor.  
 <P>
<B> PROSPECTS</B>:  Although no hearings have been scheduled for the bill, supporters say they want to move forward with plans to attach similar legislation to each appropriation and authorization bill that comes up in Congress.  It is believed that attaching such an amendment to each appropriation and authorization will make it more difficult for special interests to oppose efforts at reform.

<CENTER><H3> Stem the Resurgence of Drug Abuse</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Drug abuse among teenagers has increased significantly in recent years.  This change is attributable to the culture's pro-drug influence, less-than-effective prevention programs, and President Clinton's silence on the issue.  The Administration's national drug strategy focuses on "harm reduction" --  treatment for chronic drug users and less enforcement.  Meanwhile, Congress may cut drug prevention programs.  Any long-term solution requires parental involvement, community programs, and strong national leadership. 
<P>
A nationwide survey by the National Institute of Drug Abuse (NIDA) in 1994 found that annual marijuana use among 8th graders rose from 6.2 percent in 1991 to 13 percent in 1994.  The trend is also evident among 10th (16.5 percent to 30.4 percent) and 12th (36.7 percent to 38.2 percent) graders.  And cocaine, crack, heroin, and LSD use among teenagers is also rising and may soon rival the high rates of the 1970s.
<P>
The largest rise is in marijuana abuse, possibly because it is perceived differently from the "hard" drugs.  Although some young people don't even consider marijuana a "drug,"  Dr. Carlton Turner, former NIDA director and head of the Marijuana Research Project at the University of Mississippi, warns, "There is no other drug used or abused by man that has the staying power and broad cellular actions on the body that cannabis [marijuana] does."
<P>
Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala states, "Young people must understand that there is clear scientific evidence that marijuana is a dangerous drug that can have acute and hazardous effects."  Over 10,500 published scientific papers show that marijuana damages brain cells, the lungs, may adversely affect reproduction in women and fertility in men, endangers the unborn baby and newborns of pot-smoking women, and could damage the heart.
<P>
Shalala calls for "strong and comprehensive solutions....Young people must grow up knowing unambiguously that drug use -- including smoking marijuana -- is unwise, unhealthful, illegal and wrong.  They must hear this from everyone in their communities -- their parents, their teachers, their employers, their peers, the media -- all of us.  We need anti-drug messages that are every bit as pervasive and strong as the pop culture images that tell our youth drugs are o.k."
<P>
These strong words are not echoed by other Administration officials.  President Clinton has been virtually silent on the topic.  And his national drug strategy focuses on a new philosophy entitled "harm reduction," which provides and supports programs to reduce the danger of drug use-related risks, like HIV infection.  Needle exchange is a key component.  The strategy is geared at changing but not eliminating drug-using behavior, in order to reduce the threat of disease due to drug use.
<P>
Meanwhile, the Administration has cut drug interdiction efforts and increased efforts to treat chronic abusers.  The hope is that having more abusers in treatment will reduce demand -- a step toward ending the plague.
<P>
Unfortunately, the pop culture glamorizes drugs, and there are few alternative cultural icons warning teenagers to "just say no."  Additionally, there is no sign that drug production and distribution are declining.  In fact, there continues to be an ample supply.
<P>
The 104th Congress may cut school-based drug prevention programs believing they don't work.  There are some ineffective programs, but others have good track records and should be kept.  
<P>
The House rescissions bill (H.R. 1158) cut most of the FY 95 drug prevention money.  Pending legislation in the Senate may recover some of the funds.   
<P>
The national drug crisis requires committed parents and community leaders to join forces.  At the national level, leadership such as that provided by President and Mrs. Ronald Reagan is needed to curb the drug glamorization messages and boost effective prevention programs.
<P>

<CENTER><H3> Free Public Broadcasting</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<B> OBJECTIVE</B>:  The Corporation for Public Broadcasting was created in 1967 during Lyndon Johnson's "Great Society" to meet a perceived need for taxpayer-financed alternative programming not provided by commercial networks.  Congressional authorization for CPB is due to expire at the end of 1996.  The 104th Congress should let authorization expire and decline to appropriate any more taxpayer money for CPB.  Instead of giving more taxpayer support to CPB, Congress should let it thrive on its own, as it has shown it can do.
<P>
<B> BILLS AND SPONSORS</B>:  The House budget resolution (H. Con. Res. 67) sponsored by Rep. John Kasich (R-Ohio) takes the first steps by providing a three-year phase out of funding for CPB.  The resolution passed the House on May 18 by a vote of 238 to 193.  A weaker Senate budget resolution (S. Con. Res. 13) was passed on May 25 by a vote of 57 to 42.  It includes a provision sponsored by Sen. Hank Brown (R-Col.) to bring commercial sponsors to CPB in order to offset possible reductions in taxpayer subsidies.  The Senate resolution includes no explicit cuts in funding and falls short of the goal of privatization.
<P>
<B> STATUS</B>:  Budget resolutions in both houses of Congress provide a starting point for privatizing CPB, but more action is needed.  Budget resolutions are only suggestions for how to spend taxpayers' money.  Bills dealing with the appropriation of CPB funds will be making their way through the Congress this summer.
<P>
<B> SUMMARY AND RATIONALE</B>:  The CPB should be privatized for several reasons.  First, the federal government should not be in the broadcasting business.  The basis for CPB's existence is the assumption that for good television programming to exist, the government must provide it.  This $285.6 million a year, anti-free market philosophy insults the intelligence of the viewing/listening public because it assumes that they won't support good programming.
<P>
Second, CPB has been a regular launching pad for attacks on the family.  Independent Television Service's Television Families, Dottie Gets Spanked, and Terminal USA ridicule traditional families and glorify non-traditional households.  A PBS documentary What Kids Want to Know About Sex and Growing Up contains graphic sexual information, aimed at children as young as 8 years old.  The role of parents in the education of their children as well as the moral and familial ramifications of sexuality are almost invisible.  PBS's Tales of the City and Tongues Untied are offensive and graphic promotions of the homosexual lifestyle.  Both programs contain gratuitous nudity, lewdness and foul language.  Religious bigotry is also common in CPB programming. National Public Radio's The Politics of Bigotry was billed as an "in-depth investigation of the Christian Right."  It was actually an ugly smear of Christians which violated the First Amendment's guarantee of free exercise of religion.
<P>
Finally, in a time of massive federal deficits, it makes no sense to require taxpayers to shell out their hard-earned dollars so that the government can run a television network that could survive on its own anyway.  As any family knows, serious budget cutting must start with non-essentials. 
<P>
<B> PROSPECTS</B>:  Defunding CPB is a priority for conservatives.  But these efforts are being met with stiff opposition from CPB supporters in both parties who argue that opponents are trying to kill "Big Bird."  It is hoped that the merits of privatization will drown out such scare tactics.

<P>
<CENTER><H3> Free the Arts and Humanities: Defund the NEA and NEH</H3></CENTER>
<P>

<B> OBJECTIVE</B>:  Over the years, a total of more than $5 billion in taxpayer money has gone toward the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities.  These federal agencies disburse millions of dollars each year in grants to institutions and individuals, most of which are not controversial.  But continued revelations of wasteful spending, public sponsorship of blatantly anti-family, anti-Christian, anti-business, pro-feminist and pro-homosexual "scholarly" projects and "art works" may finally motivate Congress to defund the endowments. 
  <P>
<B> BILLS AND SPONSORS</B>:  The House Budget Resolution (H. Con.Res. 67), which passed 238 to 193 on May 18, provides no funds to either of the endowments.  A separate reauthorization bill, however, sponsored by Rep. Bill Goodling (R-Penn.), passed the Education and Economic Opportunities Committee on May 10.  That bill would phase out NEA and NEH by 1999 and is awaiting floor action.  In the Senate, the budget resolution sponsored by Sen. Pete Domenici (R-Ariz.) would cut the endowments but not phase them out.  Senators Jeffords, Kassebaum, Kennedy, et al. have introduced S. 856, the Arts, Humanities, and Museum Services Act of 1995.  This bill would reauthorize both endowments.  Introduced on May 25, it was referred to the Labor and Human Resources Committee.  
<P>
<B> SUMMARY AND RATIONALE</B>:  Most legislation on the NEA and NEH seeks to trim funding.  But merely reducing the budgets for the endowments would be breaking faith with American voters who want government to cut back on non-essentials now.  And leaving the endowments bleeding but still very much alive guarantees several years of shrill politicking by subsidy-seeking arts and campus groups.  It also ensures an easier renewal of spending if Congress falls back into 
liberal hands.
<P>
The NEA is budgeted $162.5 million in fiscal 1995 (down $4.5 million from $167 million because of an earlier rescission bill).  NEH is budgeted $172 million (also trimmed by $5 million from $177 million).  The House bill would also place a 5 percent cap on administrative expenses, thus gutting the Washington operations of the endowments, and send 80 percent of the grant money to the state arts councils in block grants.
<P>
<B> PROSPECTS</B>:  An attempt to zero out funds for NEA and NEH failed in the House Education and Economic Opportunities Committee, which settled for the phase-out.  But the House Budget Resolution calls for no funding.  House negotiators will have to choose whether to do the right thing (zero out the agencies) or succumb to pressure from liberal colleagues and the more liberal Senate to retain the agencies in some fashion.  The latter course will earn budget cutters no love from the arts and humanities crowd, and will only ensure more conflict in the years ahead.   
<P>
<CENTER><H3> Religious Rights Restored</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<B> OBJECTIVE</B>:  Although the First Amendment to the United States Constitution includes the right to freely exercise religion, the ultra-broad interpretation of the provision prohibiting government from establishing a religion has nearly nullified the free exercise right.  A restorative amendment is needed to return to citizens their full First Amendment rights.
<P>
<B> BILLS AND SPONSORS</B>:  Rep. Ernest Istook (R-Okla.) is heading a coalition of congressmen and pro-family groups in drafting an amendment to the U.S. Constitution which would restore to individuals and groups the right to speak and express their religious beliefs.  Rep. Henry Hyde (R-Ill.) and Rep. Charles Canady (R-Fla.) may cosponsor the amendment.  
<P>
<B> DATE INTRODUCED</B>:  The amendment has not yet been introduced.
<P>
<B> STATUS</B>:  Before any proposed language is introduced, the House Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution will hold hearings around the country on the topic of  "Religious Liberties and the Bill of Rights."  The first hearing was scheduled to take place in Washington, DC on June 8, 1995, followed by hearings in Harrisonburg, Va., Oklahoma City, Los Angeles, Tampa Bay, New York City, and Philadelphia.
  <P>
<B> SUMMARY AND RATIONALE</B>:  The starting point for this legislation was H. J. Res. 424, introduced October 7, 1993, which contained the language discussed in the Senate during the Reagan Administration.  The premises upon which this effort is based include the following:  that a constitutional amendment approach is necessary due to existing court decisions on constitutional grounds; that participation in prayer should not be compelled; and that neither a moment of silence nor government-mandated language is acceptable.  While the language of the amendment is not yet final, it is expected to include provisions preventing the government from prohibiting prayer or other religious expression where non-religious expression is permitted, and from discriminating against or denying benefits to groups on account of their religious identity or ideas.
<P>
<B> PROSPECTS</B>:  This amendment will see heavy opposition from the ACLU and like-minded groups.  It is unclear whether the "super-majority" (two-thirds) needed for the amendment to pass is possible. 
<P>

<CENTER><H3> Parental Rights Restored</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<B> OBJECTIVE</B>:  Increasingly, parents' efforts to teach their children morals, values, and discipline are frustrated by government bureaucrats who claim a superior role in the development of the child.  A law is needed to restore to parents the right to direct the upbringing of their minor children without governmental interference.

<P>
<B> BILLS AND SPONSORS</B>:  Rep. Steve Largent (R-Okla.) and Sen. Charles Grassley (R-Iowa) are each drafting legislation to prohibit the government from interfering with the right of parents to direct the upbringing of their children. 
<P>
<B> DATE INTRODUCED</B>:  The bills have not yet been introduced.
<P>
<B> STATUS</B>:   Both bills are on hold while the Family Research Council and other pro-family groups hammer out appropriate language.
<P>
<B> SUMMARY AND RATIONALE</B>:  The Parental Rights Act is designed primarily as a response to parents' inability to control important aspects of their children's education.  The Act would, for example, support parents who want to opt their children out of offensive sex education programs.   However, the Act not only protects parents' rights vis a vis education, but also prohibits government interference with regard to medical decisions for their children, reasonable corporal punishment of their children, and the direction of, or provision for, religious teaching for their children.   Some pro-life groups have some concern that the medical decision provision of the Act would prohibit governmental intervention in cases where parents attempt to coerce a daughter into having an abortion.  Similarly, there is currently some doubt as to whether the Act would indeed provide a counterbalance to privacy arguments against parental consent statutes, as it was originally envisioned.  The concept of statutorily restoring parents' rights is a good one, and, once the wording issues have been resolved, the Act will need support from pro-family citizens.
<P>
<B> PROSPECTS</B>:	The bills will likely be introduced and debated this term.
<P>

<CENTER><H3> Defund Anti-Family Legal Activism</H3></CENTER>

<P>
<B> OBJECTIVE</B>:  The Legal Services Corporation is a federally-funded program created in 1974 to provide poor people with access to expensive legal services.  In actuality, LSC serves as a deep well for anti-family litigation.  Each year hundreds of millions of dollars in legal services are donated to the poor from the private sector.  This $415 million a year pot of gold for the anti-family movement is not needed and should be abolished.
<P>
<B> BILLS AND SPONSORS</B>:  There is no pending legislation dealing narrowly with Legal Services Corporation, but the House and Senate budget resolutions each call for rolling back LSC funding.  Thus, legislation which at least reduces funding of LSC is likely to come out of the Senate and House Appropriations Committees later this year.
<P>
<B> STATUS</B>:  Although there is no current legislation on LSC, pro-family groups, including FRC, are working on strategies for abolishing it.  These efforts include a letter to House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole calling for the defunding of LSC.  In mid-May, Sen. Phil Gramm's Appropriations Subcommittee on Justice, State, the Judiciary and Related Agencies held hearings on LSC.  Sen. Gramm pledged to fight the appropriation of money for LSC in the upcoming appropriations bill.  
<P>
<B> SUMMARY AND RATIONALE</B>:  The Legal Services Corporation has operated for 15 years without Congressional authorization.  Yet it continues to be one of the most powerful weapons in the anti-family arsenal.  LSC has played a major role in expanding abortion, divorce and the homosexual agenda.  It has spent $5 billion since 1974 on outrageous litigation ranging from providing cable TV for prisoners to forcing states to fund sex-change operations.  LSC has been a major combatant against welfare reform.  Supporters of LSC claim that it balances the scales in a system where poor people are at a disadvantage because of the high cost of legal services.  But state and local governments as well as bar associations and individual lawyers already provide a great deal of legal aid to the poor.  Instead of helping poor people, LSC often joins the efforts of well-funded anti-family groups such as the ACLU and the National Organization for Women.  Moreover, LSC lacks oversight.  According to Rep. Steve Largent (R-Okla.) oversight has dropped significantly during the Clinton Administration.  Two years ago over 150 on-site audits took place, compared with fewer than 10 this past year.
<P>
<B> PROSPECTS</B>:  The battle to defund the Legal Services Corporation will be a hard one.  Like many expensive government programs, LSC has appeal because it appears to help people in need.  Supporters will try to play to the public's sympathy for the poor, portraying those who want to cut the program as cruel.  But LSC's 21-year track record of radical anti-family activism will be brought to light during the debate.  Also, the deficit-conscious 104th Congress is more
likely to take a serious look at whether such programs are really necessary.

Adopted Children Fare Better than Children in Single Parent 
Households</a><br>
An Article By Gracie S. Hsu

<p>

Since joining the Family Research Council in September 1993, Gracie 
Hsu's research skills -- honed at the Johns Hopkins University -- 
have served as an asset to the work of the pro-family advocacy group's 
policy department.  In her current position as policy analyst, she is 
responsible for managing the Family Research Council's efforts in the 
fields of adolescent sexuality and life issues.  As part of FRC's 
outreach to the academic, media and legislative arenas, Miss Hsu's 
work consists of tracking, analyzing, and writing critical essays on 
new research, policy trends, and legislative initiatives concerning 
teen sexuality and abortion issues. She also represents FRC, 
explaining pro-family policy to audiences from capitol hill to the 
<i>CBS Evening News</i>. Her craftsmanship with the written word is 
a special skill she brings to FRC. As an op-ed writer, Miss Hsu 
(pronounced "Shoe") has been published in the <I>San Diego Union 
Tribune, St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Orange County Register</I>, and 
other leading publications.

<p>

Miss Hsu began her work at the Family Research Council as a research 
assistant for health policy issues during the crucial first phases of 
health care reform.  Her project opposing abortion in health care 
reform contributed to U.S. Senate hearings on the subject. Prior to 
joining the Family Research Council, her research experience included 
work at Johns Hopkins on health issues and at the University of 
California at Los Angeles in a study of urban poverty.

<p>

Work in adolescent issues is also a task to which Miss Hsu comes 
well-prepared.  She served as a student health advocate under the 
University of California's Department of Student Health Services 
from 1990-1991, advising her peers on an individual basis regarding 
their various emotional and physical health concerns.  She also 
gained experience by participating in California's Watts Public 
Library Literacy Program, in which she worked as a tutor for inner 
city youth.

<p>

Miss Hsu graduated <I>cum laude</I> and with College Honors from 
the University of California at Los Angeles, receiving a Bachelor 
of Arts degree in English.  She went on to graduate <I>summa cum 
laude</I> with a Masters of Health Sciences degree from the Johns 
Hopkins University School of Hygiene and Public Health in Baltimore, 
Maryland.

<TITLE>NEW RESEARCH SHOWS ADOPTED CHILDREN FARE BETTER THAN
CHILDREN IN SINGLE PARENT HOUSEHOLDS</TITLE>

<P>
<H2>NEW RESEARCH SHOWS
<BR>ADOPTED CHILDREN FARE
<BR>BETTER THAN CHILDREN IN
<BR>SINGLE PARENT HOUSEHOLDS</H2>
</CENTER>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 50%>
<P>
<CENTER><I>by</I>
<P>
<I>Gracie S. Hsu</I></CENTER>
<P>
New research data released by the National Center for Health Statistics
shows that adopted children fare better than children in single
parent households on a number of practical health indicators.
 The study, &quot;Health of Our Nation's Children,&quot; is based
on the 1988 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS).
<P>
Specifically, the study found that adopted children are far more
likely than fatherless children in single parent households to:
<UL>
<LI><B>Wear seatbelts</B> -- While 20.6 percent of adopted children
rarely or never wear seatbelts, nearly 40 percent of children
in single-mother homes do not wear seatbelts.  This disparity
is especially marked when the children are under the age of 12.
 Among fatherless children, 30.1 percent of 3- to 4-year-olds
and 44.6 percent of 5- to 11-year-olds rarely or never wear seatbelts;
only 12.3 percent of adopted children in either age range do not
wear seatbelts.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI><B>See a dentist</B> -- Only 10.3 percent of  adopted children
aged 3-17 have not seen a dentist in the past 2 years, compared
with 19.7 percent of children living in single-mother homes.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI><B>Live in a smoke-free home</B> -- Less than 32 percent of
adopted children currently live or have lived during the past
year in a household with a smoker, but the percentage increases
to nearly 50 percent for children in single-mother households.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI><B>Have a regular bedtime</B> -- While 8.3 percent of adopted
children have a late or irregular bedtime, fully 22 percent of
their fatherless counterparts have a late or irregular bedtime.
</UL>


<P>
These data show that children from adoptive two-parent homes are
at significantly lower health risk than children in fatherless
homes.  Such practical measurements add a unique contribution
to the overwhelming empirical evidence which demonstrates that
children living with two continuously married parents, whether
biological or adoptive, are healthier than children in single-parent
or stepparent households.  In light of the current national debates
over welfare reform and the adoption tax credit, the NHIS findings
take on even more significance.

<P>
<CENTER><H3>WELFARE REFORM AND ILLEGITIMACY</H3></CENTER>
<P>
At a time when some are attempting to shift the emphasis of welfare
reform away from discouraging illegitimacy these new data show
just cause to squarely focus attention on combating illegitimacy.

<P>
The evidence regarding illegitimacy is clear:  there is nothing
&quot;healthy&quot; about the decay of families.  Children of
never-married mothers are at elevated risk in the long term: 
they are more likely to use drugs, to be promiscuous, and to engage
in violent crime, among other high-risk activities.  But even
in the immediate, concrete terms of everyday life, measured by
seatbelt use or living in a smoke-free home, illegitimacy places
children at increased risk.  These findings are reason enough
for the welfare system to halt the subsidizing of illegitimacy
by increasing benefits to mothers who bear additional illegitimate
children while on welfare.
<P>
<CENTER><H3>THE ADOPTION TAX CREDIT</H3></CENTER>
<P>
As an alternative to illegitimacy, adoption ranks as one of the
best options.  In fact, when presented with four options as the
best means to resolve out-of-wedlock pregnancies among teenagers,
Americans ranked adoption as the best alternative (33 percent),
followed by keeping the child and marrying the child's father
(25 percent), keeping the child and raising it by herself (13
percent), and having an abortion (10 percent), according to a
recent Family Research Council poll.
<P>
Adoption is indeed a good option, and the aforementioned NHIS
data only adds more weight to the large and growing body of evidence
which shows that <B>adoption benefits children</B>.  Adopted children
are not only very often the recipients of a loving, two-parent
home, but they also exhibit high levels of self-esteem and self-identity,
as a recent Search Institute study shows.
<P>
Thus, it is encouraging that the U.S. House of Representatives
recently passed a proposal to make adoption a more affordable
choice for prospective adoptive parents by allowing a tax credit
of up to $5,000 for qualified adoption expenses.  These expenses
could include adoption fees, court costs, attorney fees, and other
expenses which are directly related to the legal adoption of the
child.

   <H1>Fatherlessness</H1>
   <h2>The Central Social Problem of Our Time</h2>
   <H3>By Tom Lowe</H3>

</center>

<p>
For most of our history, a child growing up in the United States of  America could reasonably expect to grow up with a 
father at home.  Today, he can reasonably expect not to.  Fatherlessness is fast replacing fatherhood.  Never in our nation's 
history have so many men decided to abandon their children.  And never have the effects of that abandonment been felt so 
ubiquitously.


<p>
Divorce; child poverty; youth violence; the failure of education; unsafe neighborhoods; domestic violence; the weakening of 
parental authority--all are most directly attributable to the scourge of fatherlessness.  In his incisive new book <i>Fatherless 
America</i>, David Blankenhorn points out that, "Tonight, about 40 percent of American children will go to sleep in homes in 
which their fathers do not live . . . Fatherlessness," says Blankenhorn, "is the engine driving our most urgent social 
problems."


<p>
Our ancestral understanding of fatherhood, which in many ways was responsible for early American success and survival, is 
under siege.  Men in general, but fathers in particular, are viewed as superfluous--America is now unable to believe in 
fatherhood as an inherent domain of males that absolutely effects the well-being of children and society.  

<p>
A blizzard of statistics and studies confirms the relationship between fatherlessness and child poverty.  In married-couple 
homes as of 1992, 13 percent of all children under the age of six lived in poverty, while in single-mother homes an 
unbearably sad 66 percent of young children lived in poverty.  And consider that in married-couple homes with pre-school 
children, median family income in 1992 was approximately $41,000, while in single mother homes, median income was 
about $9,000.  America cannot address its child poverty problem without first addressing its most powerful determinant--fatherlessness. 


<p>
After protection and provisional responsibility, the central task of fatherhood is cultural conveyance.  As described in the 
Book of Genesis, paternity does not just mean males providing food and shelter for children, it also means that they ensure 
that the child grows up to be a <i>certain type of person</i>.  Biological paternity means producing a child--fatherhood means 
producing an adult.  For boys, the most insidious manifestation of fatherlessness has been juvenile violence, and for girls it 
has been out of wedlock childbearing.  


<p>
Studies show that girls who grow up without fathers are at much greater risk for early sexual activity, adolescent 
childbearing, and divorce.  Among white families, one study finds that "daughters of single parents are 111 percent more 
likely to have children as teenagers, and 164 percent more likely to have a pre-marital birth."


<p>
These studies also confirm that boys who grow up without a father at home are three times as likely to get in trouble with the 
police.  Historian James Q. Wilson reminds us that, "Neighborhood standards may be set by mothers, but they are enforced 
by fathers, or at least by adult males.  Neighborhoods without fathers are neighborhoods without men able and willing to 
confront errant youth, chase threatening gangs. . . The absence of fathers. . . deprives the community of those little platoons 
that informally but often effectively control boys on the street."


<p>
Frighteningly, an entire generation of young people is now growing up in neighborhoods substantially devoid of fathers or 
responsible males.  As of 1994, the illegitimacy rate among blacks was 68 percent, and in certain welfare-infested inner city 
neighborhoods over 80 percent of children are growing up in fatherless homes.  <i>Over 80 Percent.</i>


<p>
The federal welfare system is partly to blame.  Welfare cash payments to out-of-work mothers usurp a man's traditional role 
as provider; they make the struggling male breadwinner unnecessary, emasculating him.  His response is predictable.  He 
turns to the super-masculine world of the streets:  drinking, drugs, male camaraderie and crime.  The dissolution of the ties 
that bind men to their children explains much of the rampant pathology from the city streets to small towns across America.


<p>
What is the solution to fatherlessness?  Laws strengthening the traditional family are part of the answer.  There should be 
firm public endorsement of healthy families, especially in textbooks written for schools.  Divorce should be made more 
difficult.  So-called alternative life-styles should be treated with the contempt they deserve for damaging our childrens well-
being.  State legislatures could reaffirm the value of two-parent families by passing laws to prohibit sperm banks from 
selling sperm to unmarried women.  The tax codes, which are unfriendly, if not downright hostile to families, must be 
changed to promote two-parent families and the raising of children at home.


<p>
As Blankenhorn insists, the most urgent social challenge for America as it heads into the twenty-first century is the re-
creation of fatherhood as a vital social role for males.  Does every child deserve a father?  The current answer in American 
society is "no" or "not necessarily."  The only answer that can save our children's future is an unabashed yes, but today, few 
ideas could be more radical.

<font size=5><strong>CURRENT PROPOSALS TO CHANGE THE TAXATION OF 
SAVING</strong></font><br>
<hr>
</center>
The Flat Tax (Dick Armey), The Sales Tax (Bill Archer), The USA (Unlimited
Savings Allowance) Tax (Domenici-Nunn), and The Individual Investment
Account Act (Breaux-McCrery)
<p>

All four revolutionary tax proposals have identical prime objectives:  (1)
totally <i>eliminating</i> the double tax on saving; and (2) greatly
<i>simplifying</i> the tax system.  These objectives are entirely proper
and achievable.  What it takes is sound judgment, good leadership, and the
guts to stop the "hand-wringers" from conjuring up ghosts that drag out
and obfuscates sound analysis and action. 
<P>
Appropriate comments follow.  But first, please recognize that
the League focuses on the taxation of <i>personal saving</i>.
Corporate tax changes, while relevant, are not commented upon herein.
<P>

<b>Flat Tax</b>:<br>  

We applaud it, because it totally removes the double tax on saving.  It
has undeniable attraction via simplicity. It is challenged by some,
because they claim it is less "progressive" than they prefer.  It suffers
due to the prospective elimination of tax deductions for home mortgage
interest, charitable contributions, and certain other embedded, existing
tax provisions. 

<P>
<b>Sales Tax</b>:<br>  

Again getting rid of the double tax on saving is a major attribute.  The
champions of the sales tax stress that it removes the whole income tax
structure and effectively removes the need for any IRS-with its legions of
tax collectors.  Further, the sales tax can be adjusted to correct the
present tax imbalance on foreign imports and exports.  Some commentators
fear that the sales tax will eventually evolve into a value-added tax,
with many levels of taxation that are masked from the public.  The sales
tax concept is simple, but faces a need for public acceptance due to its
perceived regressiveness.  The states, many who rely upon sales taxes, may
fight a national sales tax. 

<P>
<b>Domenici-Nunn (N-D) USA Plan:</b><br>

The centerpiece of the USA Tax is the Unlimited Savings Allowance from
which the new tax system for America's future derives its name" (4/25/95
N-D memo).  This plan has been endorsed by the <i>Washington Post</i>. 
The N-D plan, insofar as the taxation of personal saving is concerned, is
virtually identical to in concept, and is derived from, the Individual
Investment Account Act.<p>

<b>The Individual Investment Account Act (S. 159 and H.R.
328):</b><br> 

Described by knowledgeable economists as ... "one of the boldest, most
imaginative, and most constructive pro-growth tax initiatives in many
years," this plan zeros in solely on the major fault with the existing
income tax system:  the senseless double tax on saving.  <p>

The simple, effective substance of this legislation creates an IRA-type
account for every person into which unlimited, fully tax-deductible
contributions may be made.  All assets accumulate on a tax-free basis. 
There is no penalty tax, nor forced distributions at any age.  There is no
income tax nor estate tax at death, and beneficiaries have the same tax
basis as the benefactor.  All withdrawals are taxed at ordinary income tax
rates.  The net effect of this legislation is, like the other more complex
legislation above, a zero tax on <i>after-tax income </i> that is saved
and invested.  Additionally, this act provides a simple, most desirable
"home and account" rollover procedure that helps people not only purchase
their home, but also sell their home on a sound, tax-deferred "investment
transaction "basis.

   <H1>Imagineering a State Budget</H1>
   <H3>By Tom McClintock</H3>

</center>

In Anaheim, California, the creative technicians at Disneyland use the term, 
"Imagineering" to describe the process of letting their imaginations run wild and then 
trying to engineer fantasy into reality.  In Sacramento, California, the creative politicians 
at the Capitol use the term "budgeting" to describe a similar exercise.  The principal 
difference is that the Disney folks are good at it.

<p>
The Imagineers in Sacramento have once again produced a budget that fantasizes much 
higher revenues than the state will receive, much lower expenditures than the state has 
authorized, with virtually no budget reserve.  Thus, every miscalculation will 
immediately translate into red ink, piling on to the already staggering debt load 
shouldered by California's taxpayers. 

<p>
Since 1990, California's economy has significantly <i>under</i>-performed the rest of the 
nation--dragged down by one of the heaviest tax and regulatory burdens in the country.

<p>
Nevertheless, California's new budget is based on predictions of a miraculous economic 
explosion in 1996, including a 33 percent jump in building permits. 

<p>
Last year, Californias personal income grew only half as fast as the rest of the country, 
but next year, the budget requires an economy growing a 33 percent faster than the 
nation.  Last year, Californias employment grew at only one third the national rate.  Next 
year, it must grow 25 percent faster than the rest of the country.  Taxpayers will make up 
the difference between fantasy and reality.  Meanwhile, the budget counts on a $500 
million federal gift that Washington has not even agreed to give.

<p>
In their defense, Sacramentos Imagineers are quick to point out that the budgets 
economic forecasts are "mid-range estimates, when compared to other forecasters."  
That's an important distinction, since the "other forecasters" they use for comparison have 
been very good at over-estimating the states performance in past years.  Economists like 
Arthur Laffer, who have been consistently correct in predicting Californias economy, are 
far more pessimistic.  Laffer observes that Californias economy now drags along at the 
bottom of national numbers, on its way to becoming "perpetual West Virginia."

<p>
On the expenditure side, the budget is balanced by significant and overdue cuts in social 
welfare spending.  But theres a hitch.  The cuts cant take effect until waivers are granted 
from the federal government, or federal laws are changed.

<p>
Yet the budget assumes these authorizations will soon take effect.  California will run a 
deficit up to $1.5 million every day the authorizations are delayed.  Thats a very likely 
scenario.  The state is still waiting for waivers for cuts made last year.  The same 
imprudence last year added millions of dollars to the deficit.

<p>
In addition, a number of court cases are pending against the state for past fiscal 
gimmicks.  For example, past budget games have shorted the state's pension system of 
nearly $1 billion. Court cases challenging state raids of this nature--which are part of the 
state's structural deficit--are very likely to add $2 billion to the states obligations, yet no 
reserve has been set aside.

<p>
A press release from the budgets author boasts, "Without any gimmicks, tricks, or smoke 
and mirrors, the proposed 1995-96 budget is balanced and even has a small reserve of $41 
million."  "Small" is putting it mildly. It amounts to 95/1000ths of one percent of the 
state general fund.  The Imagineers may not have relied on "smoke and mirrors," but their 
new budget will only fly with ample quantities of faith and trust--and a little of Tinker 
Belles pixie dust.

<p>
The difference between the fantasy of this years state budget and the reality of the states 
ailing economy will be measured by a growing deficit that future taxpayers will bear.  
Meanwhile, the state continues to carry at least $2.5 billion of debt from past years, or 
about $300 per family, which California taxpayers must eventually pay. 

<p>
Kudos to those few legislators who stood in the face of intimidation and pressure to vote 
against this wasteful and irresponsible budget.  The fact that this years budget was 
passed by a bi-partisan vote should not be hailed as a breech in "gridlock".  Instead, 
support for this business-as-usual budget, which will continue to drag California to its 
knees, should be seen for what it is: a sad commentary on the quality of political 
leadership in California.

   <H1>What Welfare Should Be</H1>
   <H3>By Larry P. Arnn & Thomas G. West </H3>

</center>

What should welfare be twenty-five years from now?  The current system and everything like it should be a faint memory.  In its place should be a system that is local in administration.  This new system must support family and work.  It must respect marriage, disdain illegitimacy, and distinguish the deserving poor from the pretenders.  It must rely in large part upon the initiative of private parties and 
organizations, in other words it must be again a system of charity and not of interest-group driven public policy.  It must be fair and good.

<p>
During the 1960's, 70's, and 80's the public debate over welfare consisted mostly of money talk.  Can we afford welfare?  Who should have to pay for it?  Much, however, has changed over the past decade. Now, thanks to the accumulation of bad experience, and the clear heads of a wise few, we are reaching to the fundamentals.  We see now that a vast treasure of ill targeted relief has bought us only more misery.  We see that the poor have been hurt even more than the tax payer has been bilked.

<p>
Between 1960 and 1990 government welfare spending increased from about $30 billion (measured in 1990 dollars) to $225 billion per year; an increase of 750 percent.  The reasons for this dependency are many and complicated, but consider that in 1992, for example, a welfare mother of two living in California with a Section 8 housing voucher from the federal Department of Housing and Urban 
Development, had a tax-free equivalent income of $1,817 per month, or $21,804 per year.  This is more than twice the after-tax amount she could have earned at a full-time minimum-wage job.  Why should she work when welfare prices work out of the market?

<p>
The percentage of poor Americans has not been reduced since modern welfare began in the mid-1960s.  On the contrary, these programs have in truth worked against economic growth and opportunity for the poor.  Before the big 1960s increases in welfare spending, the poverty level had actually been <i>declining</i> rapidly.  According to government figures, 35 percent of Americans were poor in 1950.  By 1965, that figure had declined to 14 percent, which is about where it has stubbornly remained ever since.

<p>
The stubborn immobility of the poverty numbers is bad enough, but it is not the worst.  The nature of poverty has changed insidiously.  Prior to the 1960s, most poor Americans were poor because their work brought them a paltry income.  But since the middle of the 60s there has been a sharp and ominous increase of social pathology in urban, welfare-infested communities.  Poverty has increasingly become a problem stemming from a new underclass of able-bodied people who work rarely or not at all.  Many of them, especially males, reject the qualities that most Americans admire:  self-control, sobriety, duty to family, loyalty, courage, fair play, and faith in God.

<p>
The new underclass, mired in government dependency, rejects the ethic of hard work and self-reliance.  Low-paying jobs--where many Americans have traditionally learned the basic skills of showing up on time and getting the job done--are scoffed at.  The underclass regards these jobs as "dead-end" and their pay as "chump change."  For this urban underclass, many of whom have spent care-free years not working, hanging around smoking reefer and drinking 40-ounce beers, the reality of trying to hold down a regular job is too much.  In this world, the drug dealing thug is lionized and the man who sweeps floors is scorned.  Welfare has taught our poor all the wrong lessons.

<p>
If today's welfare policies are not working, what then is the alternative?  Prior to the new, post-1965 approach, America had the most successful poverty program in history.  Two centuries ago, at least 90 percent of Americans were desperately poor by today's standards.  By the 1960s a majority of Americans had moved into the middle class.  The recipe for America's successful 189-year-long poverty program was simple: 
<ol>
<li>Establish free markets and opportunity for all who can work.
<li>Provide strong governmental support for the traditional family and for a morality of self-control, industriousness, and basic decency.
<li>Provide individual support in local communities for the deserving poor (orphans, the elderly, and the disabled), and temporarily for the wayward able who desire to pull themselves out from poverty.
</ol>


<p>
Let us assume that the federal government is acting on the new prevailing intellectual consensus about poverty programs by handing over to states and local governments the authority to set and administer their own assistance programs for the poor.  With that in mind, here are characteristics of programs and ideas that can help in the transition away from the disastrous federal welfare state.

<p>
<ul>
<li><b><i>Political and community leaders should again talk candidly about virtue, vice and shame.</i></b></ul>

<p>
We know destructive and immoral conduct when we see it.  Its carnage is all around us and there is no reason to refrain from pointing out the truth.  One of the most frustrating problems in trying to resolve the current poverty question, as <i>Newsweek</i> pointed out in a cover story last fall, is the fact  that "shame" has all but disappeared from American society.  Thirty years ago, it was considered shameful to be on the government dole.  But beginning in the 60s, as Marvin Olasky points out in <i>The Tragedy of American Compassion</i>, the poor were taught by welfare organizers that welfare is "nothing to be ashamed of."  Before that, he says, poor mothers had  "a sense that welfare should be avoided."  But, "the constant repetition of <i>rights</i> got through."  The result was "a changing outlook among many poor and the near poor."  The deceptive notion that there was "dignity" in accepting government aid was widely promulgated in these years.  Accordingly, within a few years a much larger proportion of those eligible for welfare chose to take advantage of it.  

<p>
When the stigma of accepting hand-outs is lost, so then is much of the self-reliant spirit it takes for people to pull themselves out of poverty.  Society must not be afraid to cast shame upon laziness, and leaders must affirm with renewed vigilance the duties and responsibilities of citizenship:  hard work, honesty, duty to family and self-sufficiency.

<p>
<ul><li><b><i>Understand that fatherlessness is the central social problem of our time.</i></b></ul>

<p>
It is in fact the key to solving poverty and crime problems.  While we know children do better with a father at home, and while it is damaging for a child to grow up without one, an almost incomprehensible disaster happens when an entire generation of young people grows up in neighborhoods substantially devoid of fathers or responsible males.  As of  1994, the illegitimacy rate among blacks was 68 percent, but in certain welfare-infested inner city neighborhoods 80 percent of children are growing up in fatherless homes.

<p>
The problem, however, has spread far beyond the inner city.  In his incisive new book <i>Fatherless America</i>, David Blankenhorn points out that, "Tonight, about 40 percent of American children will go to sleep in homes in which their fathers do not live. . . . Fatherlessness," says Blankenhorn, "is the engine driving our most urgent social problems, from crime to adolescent pregnancy. . . . A blizzard of statistics and studies confirms the relationship between fatherlessness and child poverty."  These studies indicate that in married-couple homes as of  1992, 13 percent of all children under the age of six lived in poverty; while in single-mother homes a deplorable 66 percent of children lived in poverty.  

<p>
The federal welfare system is partly to blame.  Welfare cash payments usurp a man's traditional role as provider; they make the struggling male breadwinner superfluous, emasculating him.  His response is predictable.  He turns to the masculine world of the streets:  drinking, gang banging, drugs, male camaraderie and crime.  The dissolution of the ties that bind men to their children explains much of today's rampant pathology.

<p>
Cash payments to underage girls who decide to have children without bothering to get married put the government in the indefensible position of encouraging reckless sexual behavior and illegitimate births.  Laws supporting family integrity need strengthening.  There should be firm public endorsement of healthy families, consisting of a married father and mother raising their own offspring.  Divorce should be made more difficult; and so-called alternative life-styles should be treated with the contempt they deserve for damaging our children's well-being.

<p>
<ul><li><b><i>A serious response to the crime that plagues poor neighborhoods is required forthwith.</i></b></ul>

<p>
In the urban quagmire most poor now find themselves trapped in, there is a clear and present need for an efficient system of arrest, prosecution, trial (not plea bargains), rigorous adherence to stiff sentencing, a crackdown on youth violence, and imprisonment for the first violent offense.

<p>
The most pressing purpose of government is to protect life, liberty, and property.  That purpose is subverted daily and pervasively in every major city in America, where flagrant piracy is a way of life.  The law-abiding poor need protection more urgently than the law-abiding middle class, who always have the option of moving to a safer neighborhood.

<p>
<ul><li><b><i>The failure of public schools must be acknowledged and repaired.</i></b></ul>  

<p>
In the immediate term, tax credits or vouchers for school expenses would instantly enable the poor to send their children to private schools, something that is an affordable option today only for the middle class and the wealthy.  In the longer term, public schools need radical overhaul.  Control over schools should be returned to local communities, and large numbers of administrative positions should be canceled.

<p>
<ul><li><b><i>Private charity must be supported and not supplanted by the government welfare system.</i></b></ul>

<p>
In the current "division of labor" in welfare, private charities provide few "on-line services," which means giving direct help to the needy.  That job is done by government.  Private action is forced to the sidelines, where it spends its time conducting experiments, running model programs, and giving expert advice to the government.  Private charity must be liberated so that it can flourish in America as it once did. We should invest private groups with the responsibility to do the main work in assisting the poor.  

<p>
<ul><li><b><i>Separate the deserving poor from the lazy at the local level--make welfare less generous and 
more burdensome.</i></b></ul>

<p>
In <i>The Tragedy of American Compassion</i>, Olasky describes how local assistance programs in the nineteenth century separated the "idle" from the "truly needy" by using "work tests" to discern the character of those seeking assistance.  Charities and shelters had "wood-yards" attached to their property.  "Transients willing to chop were given two meals and a nights lodging."  Not surprisingly, a commentator in 1894 noted that, "when the managers of a Boston charity attached a wood-yard and announced that relief would be given to no able-bodied man, unless willing to do a certain amount of work, the daily number of applicants fell off at once from one hundred and sixty to forty-nine."  Today, and in the future, of course, the wood-yard would be some variance on "workfare," but the idea remains the same:  To provide basic sustenance consistent with the apostle Paul's common-sense injunction, that able-bodied men who do not work are not entitled to eat.

<p>
The first steps in replacing the welfare mess should focus on turning assistance into a temporary safety-net instead of the entrapping spider web it is today.  For instance, people in dire need whose families cannot help them should have to live in local communal arrangements, with requirements for long hours of work, and  with strict rules of behavior (no overnight guests for the unmarried).  Getting tough on dependency is the only solution.  Benjamin Franklin said of welfare, "I am for doing good to the poor, but I differ in opinion of the means.  I think the best way of doing good to the poor, is not making them easy in poverty, but leading or driving them out of it." 

<p>
America needs to discover again, as we once knew well, that true compassion calls for treating the able-bodied poor as adults with souls rather than as mindless children who will never grow up.

   <h1>Tom McClintock</h1>

</center>
 
<p>

Tom McClintock serves as Director of Economic 
and Regulatory Affairs for the Claremont 
Institute's Golden State Center for Policy Studies 
in Sacramento.  He is the foremost spokesman 
in California on conservative fiscal policy and state 
government waste.

<p>

Mr. McClintock is the author of the most 
comprehensive survey of state government waste 
available and has published numerous articles 
on the state's finances. He is regularly quoted in 
budget and fiscal stories from Sacramento.  
Of his work, Dan Walters of the <i>Sacramento Bee</i> has 
written that Tom McClintock has "consistently 
been one of the very few legislators who's been 
right about what California is experiencing."  
In May 1993, Tim Ferguson of the <i>Wall Street 
Journal</i> observed, "Mr. McClintock remains 
about the only man in California who has 
consistently projected correctly the magnitude of 
the budget crises of the 1990s."  The <i>Orange 
County Register</i> said,  "Former Assemblyman 
Tom McClintock has consistently been among the 
most accurate forecasters of the effects of state 
tax and spending policies."

<p>

McClintock was first elected to the California Legislature 
in 1982 at age 26, and 
immediately earned a reputation as a freshman who 
was unafraid to stand up to legislative 
leaders.  Within two years, he became Assembly 
Republican Whip, a leadership position he held 
for five years.  In 1987 he jointly authored the 
Mello-Condit-McClintock Tax Rebate Act, which 
returned $1.1 billion of tax over-collections to 
the taxpayers of California.  In 1992, he authored 
California's current lethal injection death penalty law.

<p>

For a period of four years, beginning in 1978, 
McClintock wrote a newspaper column which 
he syndicated nationally in 1980.  From 1980-82, 
McClintock served as Chief of Staff to Senator 
Ed Davis.  He is a recognized expert in parliamentary 
law and is designated as one of the fewer 
than 2,000 Professional Registered Parliamentarians 
in the United States by the National 
Association of Parliamentarians.

<p>
Active in Republican politics since 1972, he served 
from 1973-1974 as president of the 
California Student Republican Organization; from 
1979 to 1981 as Republican County Chairman 
for Ventura County; and from 1985 to 1992 as Resolutions 
Chairman for the California Republican party.

<p>

In 1984, McClintock was named one of five 
outstanding young Californians by the 
California Jaycees and received the civilian 
Medal of Merit from the Ventura County Peace 
Officers Association for rescuing an elderly man 
from a condominium fire in 1985.  He has been 
honored by numerous taxpayer associations around 
the state for his leadership on state budget issues.

<p>

From 1992-1994, McClintock served as Director 
of the Center for the California Taxpayer, a 
project of the National Tax Limitation Foundation.  
In 1994, he overwhelmingly received the 
Republican nomination for California State Controller, 
narrowly losing the general election by one and a half points.

<p>

Tom McClintock and his wife, Lori, have two children, ages 3 and 5.

	Prior to joining the Claremont Institute in 1993, he was Vice President for Academic Relations at The Heritage Foundation in Washington, D.C.  He edited the now-famous Mandate for Leadership, a blueprint for the Reagan Administration's first 100 days.  He also co-edited that book's sequel, Mandate for Leadership III, written for the Bush Administration.  In 1988 he was project manager for another pioneering Heritage Foundation book, the The Imperial Congress, which included an introduction by a little-known freshman congressman from Georgia, Newt Gingrich.

<p>

</center>

Just prior to the 104th Congress, Catherine A. Deeds joined the 
Family Research Council in 1994 as a lobbyist to both the U.S. 
Senate and the U.S. House of Representatives. Her responsibilities 
include developing legislative strategy, meeting and working with 
key decision makers on Capitol Hill, and tracking current policy 
developments. With a broad understanding of the legislative 
process, Miss Deeds focuses on specific family issues that 
incorporate her policy skills and background.

<p>

Formerly a Legislative Assistant in 1993 for freshman U.S. 
Congressman Bob Inglis of South Carolina, Miss Deeds followed 
a number of domestic policy issues such as health care, labor, 
veterans, senior citizens, religion, and family.

<p>

Miss Deeds gained key legislative experience with family policy 
issues in several different arenas especially during a political 
appointment in the Bush Administration. In 1992, Miss Deeds 
assisted the management of the Office of the Deputy Assistant 
Secretary for Legislation in the U.S. Department of Health and 
Human Services. She served as a liaison and political appointee 
in the Bush Administration to over two hundred Congressional Offices 
on public health issues.

<p>

On Capitol Hill in 1991, Miss Deeds worked as Policy Analyst for 
the House Republican Study Committee where she performed extensive 
research and writing on issues including health care, civil 
rights, labor, family, and education.

<p>

In 1989, Miss Deeds established her expertise on family issues as 
she served on a House Select Committee on Children, Youth, and 
Families. This position included not only the reporting on various 
topics affecting children and families but also the screening 
of witnesses for Congressional hearings.

<p>

From 1987-1989, Miss Deeds served at Free Congress Research and 
Education Foundation as Managing Editor of the monthly Family 
Protection Report and later, Associate Editor of the twenty-four 
page, monthly Family, Law & Democracy Report.

<p>

Cathy Deeds currently serves on the board of directors at a crisis 
pregnancy center and Advisory Board for American Collegians for 
Life, has volunteered for five campaigns for pro-life candidates, 
and founded the Arlington chapter of the Virginia Society for Human 
Life.

<p>

In 1986, Cathy graduated from Marquette University with a Bachelor of 
Arts in Journalism.

</center>

Once a gladiator in the trenches of the National Football
League, now a pro-family advocate, Phillip V. Olsen joined the
Family Research Council in 1992 where he is Vice President for
Resource Development.  In his new capacity, the former professional
athlete directs his energies into marketing the pro-family, policy,
lobbying and educational organization.  As FRC takes its analysis
of pro-family policy to our nation's leaders and lawmakers, Mr.
Olsen and his Resource Development team broadcast the news about
FRC to its supporters nationwide.  His work involves the coordination
of resource development and grass roots networking as well as
the oversight of programs, activities and events that deliver
the message of FRC.

<p>

Mr. Olsen may be best known as a consensus first team collegiate
All-American Defensive End who was also a first-round NFL draft
choice in 1970. From there the two year All-American went on to
play nine years in the NFL, until his retirement in 1979.  A highly
decorated athlete during his athletic career, he was inducted
into the State of Utah Sports Hall of Fame in 1985.  He was also
named to Utah State University's All-Century football team in
1993 and was inducted into it's Athletic Hall of Fame in 1994.

<p>

As a concerned professional athlete, Mr. Olsen, and his brothers
Merlin and Orrin, originated and operated the Olsen Brothers All
Sports Camps throughout the western U.S.  He has also initiated
a number of student/athlete enhancement programs to promote athletic
and academic achievement. Mr. Olsen has continued his career
in sports through his work as a color commentator covering college
football on radio and as a member of the NBC TV broadcast support
team covering two Super Bowls and numerous other college and NFL
football games.

<p>

In business, Mr. Olsen has more than twenty years experience
in commercial/industrial real estate.  His experience includes
expertise in real estate finance, development, brokerage and investor
equity funding.

<p>

Active in community service, Mr. Olsen has served as chairman
of the NFL Players Association Men's Committee for Childhelp USA,
a national not-for-profit organization serving abused and battered
children.  He has also been actively involved with a number of
other charities and volunteer organizations such as Life to Life,
Sigma Chi Fraternity, the California Care Coalition, the Billy
Graham Crusade, &quot;Men at the Marriott&quot;, Friends of the
Family Research Council, and South Coast Community Church.

<p>

Mr. Olsen graduated from Utah State University in 1970 with a
Bachelor's degree in business and economics. He and his wife Connie
and their two daughters live in Maryland.

<p>

<font size=+3>I</font>n 1888, the U.S. Supreme Court declared that marriage 
is &quot;the foundation of the family and of society, without which there 
would be neither civilization nor progress.&quot;

<p>

Because of its crucial role, marriage has a special status within
the culture and the law.  Its essence -- the joining of one man
and one woman in an exclusive legal, sexual, economic and spiritual
bond with the procreation of children as a desirable and common
result -- had not been seriously challenged for thousands of years.

<p>

<center><h3>Hawaiian Havoc</h3></center>

<p>

Now, a tiny segment of a tiny fraction of the population -- the
homosexual activist community -- is on the verge of radically
redefining marriage and family.  If they succeed, all distinctions
based on sex may fall, and the worst aspects of the rejected Equal
Rights Amendment will be imposed.  Homosexuals will gain the &quot;right&quot;
to adopt children; schoolchildren will be taught that homosexual
sex is the equivalent of marital love between husband and wife;
businesses will be forced to subsidize homosexual relationships;
churches will be pushed outside the civil law; and government
power will be wielded against anyone who holds the biblical view
of homosexuality.

<p>

In August, a Hawaiian court is expected to strike down that state's
law limiting marriage to &quot;one man and one woman.&quot;  The
case, <i>Baehr v. Lewin,</i> was brought by three same-sex couples
who charged the state with &quot;discrimination&quot; for not
granting them marriage licenses.  Despite widespread opposition
within Hawaii (recent polls show that 71% of Hawaiians oppose
same-sex &quot;marriage&quot;), homosexual activists hope to impose
their agenda through compliant courts.

<p>

Because the U.S. Constitution's Full Faith and Credit Clause calls
for states to honor each other's laws, homosexuals are planning
to fly to Hawaii, &quot;marry,&quot; and return to the mainland
to claim &quot;married&quot; status.  About 25 states now have
efforts underway to protect marriage, and three of them -- Hawaii,
Utah and South Dakota -- have enacted new laws protecting marriage.

<p>

In Washington, a bill is being drafted to bind the federal government
to a &quot;one-man, one-woman&quot; definition of marriage.  Tentatively
titled the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), the bill would protect
the military, Social Security,  and all federal agencies from
radical redefinition of wedlock.

<p>

<center><h3>Full Court Press</h3></center>

<p>

The marriage battle is being fought while several other key cases
involving homosexuality are being decided in the nation's courts.
The Supreme Court is expected to rule soon in a key Colorado
case in which voters had passed a constitutional amendment to
bar any city or county from enacting special rights based on sexual
orientation.  About a dozen cases challenging the military's ban
on homosexuality are being heard around the nation.

<p>

In Georgia, a federal appeals court ruled in favor of a lesbian
fired from her job at the state attorney general's office after
she announced that she had  &quot;married&quot; her lover.  Bear
in mind that the attorney general is required to defend Georgia's
sodomy law.  In  New York, the state's high court opened adoption
proceedings to homosexual couples and unmarried heterosexual couples,
thus devaluing marriage and jeopardizing children.

<center><i><font size=+2>
TWENTY-FIVE STATES MOVE TO<br>
PROTECT MARRIAGE.
</font></i></center>
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>

The pattern is clear:  homosexual activists are using the courts
to get what they cannot achieve through democracy.  But the courts
do not operate in a vacuum.  U.S. Supreme Court justices noted
that one factor that affected the <i>Casey</i> decision upholding
<i>Roe v. Wade</i> was the court's public image.  Amherst legal
scholar Hadley Arkes notes that if Americans boldly defend marriage,
the courts may hesitate to radically redefine it.  If the states
pass marriage protection bills, and Congress enacts DOMA, the
judicial assault on traditional morality could falter.

<p>

<center><h3>What You Can Do</h3></center>

<p>

Call your Congressman and Senators and ask that they cosponsor
the coming Defense of Marriage Act.  The Capitol Hill switchboard
is 202-225-3121.

<p>

Call state legislators and ask them to support your state's marriage
protection bill, or if there isn't yet such a bill, ask them to
sponsor one.

<p>

Educate yourself about the threat to marriage today -- from mistaken
public policies and cultural decay.  Consult the enclosed reply
card for information on new resources that defend this embattled,
but essential institution.

<h3>On the Hill</h3>

<p>

<b>Border Order.</b>  H.R. 2202 by Rep. Lamar Smith (R-Tex.),
and two competing Senate bills, Alan Simpson's (R-Wyo.) S. 1394
and Spencer Abraham's (R-Mich.) S. 1535, each seek to reform immigration
policy.  FRC deplores nativist rhetoric and supports provisions
which reflect the following principles:  (1) Illegal immigration
must be halted; America should not reward those whose first act
in this country is to break the law, and (2) America must remain
a country that welcomes legal immigrants, with appropriate safeguards
for our national sovereignty.

<p>

<b>Red Letter.</b> President Clinton went on record in a Feb.
28 letter to Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch (R-Utah),
saying he will veto the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act when it
reaches his desk.  Mr. Clinton claims the legislation is unacceptable
because it does not protect a woman's life or &quot;health.&quot;
FRC responded by saying, &quot;That President Clinton would veto
a ban on a procedure characterized as four-fifths infanticide
and one-fifth abortion shows his clear disregard for the value
of human life.&quot;

<p><a name="gamble">

<b>Gambling Gambit.</b> On March 5, the House of Representatives
passed legislation to establish the National Gambling Impact and
Policy Commission.  The nine-member commission would conduct a
two-year study and report its findings to states, Congress and
the president. &quot;[T]his legislation creates no new regulations
and imposes no new mandates on gambling or state and local governments,&quot;
said its sponsor, Rep. Frank Wolf (R-Va.).  The sole purpose,
he added, is to help communities make informed decisions on gambling
questions.  Senate consideration is next.

<p>

<b>Healthy Debate.</b> On April 18-19 the Senate will debate
a health insurance reform bill sponsored by Ted Kennedy (D-Mass.)
and Nancy Kassebaum (R-Kan.).  The bill, which President Clinton
supports, does <I>not</I> contain medical savings accounts (MSA's),
and would give Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala
the power to ensure that state health insurance plans conform
with the &quot;goals&quot; of the bill, including &quot;comprehensive
coverage.&quot;  A related House bill, sponsored by Rep. Dennis
Hastert (R-Ill.), is expected to contain MSA's, no new taxes,
and no defined comprehensive benefits package.

<p>

<center><h3>Around Town</h3></center>

<p>

<b>Teens and AIDS.</b> A new study released by the White House
advocates more efforts to reduce the spread of AIDS among teenagers.
Twenty-five percent of Americans infected with AIDS each year
are under the age of 20.  The report calls for more explicit AIDS
education and HIV testing without parental notice.  Meanwhile,
a House-Senate conference committee on the Ryan White Care Act
reauthorization is deadlocked over an amendment by Reps. Tom Coburn,
M.D. (R-Okla.) and Gary Ackerman (D-N.Y.) to require AIDS testing
of newborns.  The Clinton administration opposes the requirement.
FRC supports it.

<p><a name="prayer">

<b>Wing and a Prayer.</b> The Department of Transportation is
at odds with a DOT employees' group over whether a prayer and
fellowship group can label homosexual behavior a sin.  The 50-member
Christian organization has waited more than 14 months for official
status because it rejects a &quot;nondiscrimination&quot; clause
that includes sexual orientation.  Group leaders say they welcome
homosexuals, but cannot agree to give them leadership positions
or sanction actions they consider sinful.  Meanwhile, DOT has
already given preferential treatment to GLOBE, the Gay, Lesbian
or Bisexual Employees group.

<p>

<center><h3>Across the Nation</h3></center>

<p>

<b>Court-Assisted Suicide.</b> The Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals ruled March 7 that Washington state's ban on assisted
suicide is unconstitutional.  The next day, a Michigan jury acquitted
Dr. Jack Kevorkian on charges of assisting in the suicide of two
individuals, the second time he has been exonerated.  Judge Stephen
Reinhardt, writing for the Ninth Circuit's 8-3 majority, directly
linked the ruling with <i>Roe v. Wade</i>, the 1973 case that
established abortion on demand.  Decision by Washington state
officials on an appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court is pending.

<p>

<b>Damsels in Distress.</b> A new Population Reference Bureau
study confirms what Massachusetts and California have already
found:  about two-thirds of births to teenage girls are fathered
by men age 20 or older.  In addition, a 1994 Alan Guttmacher Institute
report found that six of 10 girls who had sex before age 15 were
coerced by males an average of six years their senior.  As more
girls grow up without fathers to protect their honor, their search
for a father figure leaves them more vulnerable to predatory males.

<p>

<b>Grave But Stable?</b> Another Population Reference Bureau
report reveals both positive and negative trends among U.S. families.
Good news is that the divorce rate has leveled off, the growth
rate of single-parent families has been halved, and more two-parent
families with children have formed. However, the report also shows
that the U.S. still has the world's highest divorce rate and that
single-parent families are increasing three percent annually.
Census reports such as these sometimes reflect only a change in
demographics, not a genuine attitudinal shift.

<h3>FRC Soldiers On</h3>

<p>

FRC's Military Readiness Project (MRP) was present on March 4
in Seattle, Washington when the ACLU and the Clinton Justice Department
once again misrepresented the military's homosexual law.  In the
case of <i>Philips v. Perry</i> which involves a homosexual sailor
who admitted to misconduct, Justice's attorney told a three-judge
appeals court panel that what the military has is a &quot;homosexual
accommodation law.&quot;  In fact, it has always had an exclusion
policy.

<p>

The government cited as evidence the fiction that some homosexual
service members have successfully convinced administrative boards
that being homosexual does not mean that they will engage in
illicit conduct.  At the hearing the ACLU asserted that homosexuals
can legally serve, and then argued that the <i>Philips</i> case
was really about discrimination.  Unbelievably, it took a judge
(a Bush-appointee) to highlight the fact that Philips had admitted
to homosexual sex with &quot;a dozen&quot; men.

<p>

The MRP has participated in five federal appeals court cases.
Most recently, on March 15, it joined the <i>Richtenberg v. Perry</i>
case which involves an Air Force captain who declared himself
a homosexual.  Like the others, he seeks to invalidate the law
and the Pentagon's regulations.  This case may present another
opportunity for the MRP to make oral arguments, as it did last
December in <i>Thomasson v. Perry</i>. The MRP will defend the
underlying law, and the Clinton Justice Department will defend
the faulty &quot;Don't Ask, Don't Tell&quot; implementing regulations.

<p>

Two cases soon to be decided, <i>Abel v. U.S.A.</i> and <i>Thomasson</i>,
are competing for the attention of the Supreme Court.  Decisions
in both cases are expected this spring, and one of them will be
appealed to the high court this summer with oral arguments likely
during the court's next term.

<p>

Meanwhile, a new administration could discard Clinton's faulty
&quot;Don't Ask, Don't Tell&quot; regulations and require the
Justice Department to defend the law before the Supreme Court.
In any event, major news on this issue is only months away.

<h3>Rx for the Drug War</h3>

<p>

On Feb. 15, FRC hosted a national drug abuse prevention strategy
meeting.  Nationally known experts from diverse backgrounds and
regions came together to develop an eight-part action plan.  The
participants agreed:  the drug scourge is getting worse, and something
must be done to reignite grass-roots anti-drug efforts.

<p>

The strategy has a two-part prevention focus:  use of mind/mood-altering
drugs is dangerous to the individual and society, and comprehensive
community-based prevention is the most viable solution to the
drug crisis.

<p>

Drug education must begin at home.  The strategy calls for drug
education resources to be tied to accountability.  Drug abuse
messages must be congruent and consistently broadcast through
every educational setting (homes, schools, workplaces, communities
and media).

<p>

Law enforcement must identify all users and impose consequences
on abuse.  It must also create systematic accountability for funding
and success rates.  Key to the strategy is leadership.  Leaders
at all levels must speak clearly and serve as role models.

<p>

Grass-roots citizen action is vital.  Accountability for drug
abuse prevention must be locally based, and citizen groups must
have power over funds to make their programs work.  The media
must stop glamorizing drugs and provide truthful alternative messages.
The strategy calls for an annual report on media handling of
the drug prevention message.

<p>

Treatment for abusers should be delivered at the point of need
with accountability.  This includes providing appropriate long-term
treatment.  Finally, the strategy calls for reallocating available
drug funds with strict standards.  This year the federal government
will spread $13 billion across 140 programs with little accountability.

<p>

FRC wants the strategy to influence each political party's presidential
platform and all future drug-related legislation.   It provides
a federal model for the drug war that focuses the government on
supply interdiction and passes responsibility and fiscal authority
for prevention and treatment to local communities.

<p>

FRC's short-term goal is to have drug abuse recognized as a national
crisis. America must aim to cut current abuse levels at least
in half by the year 2000.  The long-term goal is the eradication
of drug abuse.

by Gary L. Bauer

<p>

Several years ago, radical homosexual members of the ACT-UP group
invaded St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York City and desecrated
the Host.  Millions of Christians around the world believe that
Christ is really present in the sacrament of communion.  America
has had, tragically, anti-Catholic riots in its history.  &quot;Know
Nothing&quot; mobs even dumped one of the stones intended for
the Washington Monument into the Potomac because it had been generously
donated by the pope.  But Act-Up's church invasion set a new low
for efforts to offend the deeply held religious beliefs of a whole
community.

<p>

In suburban Washington, D.C., the Montrose Baptist Church has
twice been the site of suspicious fires.  No one has been charged
with arson, but church members have cited the congregation's strong
pro-life stance and its high profile during the 1992 Maryland
abortion referendum as making it a likely target in liberal Montgomery
County.

<p>

Now we have even more disturbing evidence of hatred in action.
At least 25 black churches have been hit in a new wave of arson
in California and a number of southern states. This form of bigotry
cannot be tolerated. That is why I have joined with a group of
black, Jewish, Catholic and evangelical Christian leaders to call
for prompt hearings by the Judiciary Committees of the House and
Senate.

<p>

The current wave of church bombings began on April 4, 1993.  That
was the 25th anniversary of the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther
King, Jr.  The pace of these attacks has picked up since January,
1995.  There is evidence of a pattern here, a pattern that suggests
a conspiracy to violate our civil rights laws. There is every
reason for the federal government to act.

<p>

It does not matter what motivates the haters.  Whether it is a
<i>Hamas</i> suicide bomber who catches Bus No. 18 in Jerusalem,
or a racist who wants to terrorize black Christians peacefully
worshipping here at home, terrorism is evil and we must mobilize
against it.

<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>
<center>
<i><font size=+2>WE MUST MOBILIZE AGAINST<br>
TERRORISM.</font></i>
</center>
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>

This is also a good time to reassert the real meaning of the First
Amendment. The right of the people to the &quot;free exercise&quot;
of religion is a precious one, bought with the blood of patriots
and martyrs.  Millions of our American ancestors came to this
country seeking this right above all others.

<p>

It does not help the cause of religious tolerance when the federal
government itself treats religion as a suspect classification.
Christian employees of the Federal Aviation Administration are
still finding their request to start a prayer group stiff-armed
by bureaucrats who welcome gay activist groups (see 
<a href="#news"><I>Newswatch</I></a>).

<p>

Moreover, the Clinton administration has recently moved to squelch
tuition assistance which has been provided since 1929 for Americans
serving in Ecuador.  The parents who chose the Alliance Academy,
a Christian school, were evidently pleased with the quality of
education provided and the spiritual and moral guidance their
children received there.  But now, with the opening of a completely
secular private school in Ecuador's capital, Quito, parents have
been told to enroll their kids in this private school or forego
the assistance the U.S. government has long provided.

<p>

Anti-Semitism, anti-Catholicism and racism have no place in our
sweet land of liberty. Nor does the disdainful view of too many
that religion itself is to be discouraged. As Irving Kristol has
wisely noted:  &quot;The real danger is not from a revived Christianity...but
from an upsurge of antibiblical barbarism that will challenge
Christianity, Judaism and Western Civilization together.&quot;
To which, I say: &quot;Amen!&quot;

<li><b>Prospects for welfare reform remain uncertain.</b>  Despite
bad advice from National Governors Association to follow President
Clinton's cues and abandon illegitimacy, Congressmen Jim Talent
(R-Mo.) and Tim Hutchinson (R-Ark.) continue to <b>insist that
children need two-parent families.</b>  Father absence is leading
cause of welfare dependency.  Talent and Hutchinson hope to reinsert
family cap, which would <b>freeze existing cash benefits for women</b>
who bear additional children while on welfare, and to strengthen
work requirements. <b>Family Research Council supported Talent-Hutchinson</b>

<p>
<font size=+3>I</font>n a sweeping victory for families, Congress recently 
passed the Telecommunications Act of 1996, including provisions protecting
children from computer pornography.  The Telecom Act extends current
child protection laws to cyberspace, using the court-approved
&quot;indecency&quot; standard to keep patently offensive material
away from minors.  The cyberporn provisions punish only knowing
violations, while preserving existing electronic mail privacy
laws.
<p>
The significance of the new law's computer porn section cannot
be overstated.  It represents a once-in-a-generation opportunity
to set ground rules for the next great communications medium.
Pornographers have been flooding this promising technology, and
the new Telecom Act comes not a moment too soon.
<p>
<center><h3>ACLU Logs In</h3></center>
<p>
The American Civil Liberties Union has filed suit to strike
down the computer pornography section as unconstitutional.  Clearly,
the ACLU is fighting a losing battle.  Time and again, the courts
have upheld the constitutionality of &quot;indecency&quot; restrictions
in other contexts, most recently regarding dial-a-porn services.
FRC will file its own brief in response to the ACLU challenge.
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>
<center><i><font size=+2>ACLU FIGHTS A<br>
LOSING BATTLE</font></i></center>
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>
The battle now shifts to the Clinton administration, whose
resolve in defending the law is questionable.  Last April, President
Clinton voiced concern that children &quot;may be exposed to things
on computer, which in some ways are more powerful, more raw and
more inappropriate than those things from which we protect them
when they walk in a 7-Eleven.&quot;  Clinton declared, &quot;I
do not believe in any way, shape or form that we should be able
to do on e-mail, or through the electronic superhighway anything
beyond what we could elsewhere.  I think the First Amendment has
to be uniform in its application.&quot;
<p>
However, in recent days the Clinton administration has appeared
to retreat from this resolve.  The floundering is reminiscent
of the notorious <I>Knox</I> case, where the administration tried
to weaken the federal child pornography law it was bound to defend.
Although Congress rebuffed that attempt, fear remains that the
administration might try a similar tactic again.
<p>
Objections to the new cyberporn law have less to do with
free speech than with arrogance and greed.  The &quot;online elite&quot;
know that if this new medium is to be truly open to a diverse
community, all members of that community will deserve respect,
including children.  Even with the new law, parents must be ever
vigilant in ensuring that cyberporn remains off-limits to their
children.
<p>
<center><h3>Nixing PX Porn</h3></center>
<p>
FRC continues to fight pornography on other fronts.  Last
month at the Supreme Court, FRC filed a legal brief in <I>Alliance
for Community Media v. F.C.C.</I>, a case challenging the regulation
of pornographic programs on cable television access channels.
The challenged law would simply give private cable operators
the ability to limit indecent programs.  It would relieve operators
of the current law requiring them to show everything, no matter
how offensive. In their lawsuit, the plaintiffs charge that restoring
a cable operator's right to decide against airing indecent programs
amounts to indirect government censorship.  FRC supports the right
of private cable operators to reject &quot;nude talk shows&quot;
and &quot;amateur porn hours&quot; on access channels.  Oral argument
at the Supreme Court was set for Feb. 21.
<p>
Pornography in the military has been another flashpoint.
For years, the U.S. military has been the nation's largest porn
purveyor, stocking military exchanges with tax-free smut worth
millions of dollars.  Not surprisingly, in recent years the military
has been plagued by sexual misconduct and assault.  New Jersey
Rep. Christopher Smith is drafting a bill to prohibit the sale
of pornography at military facilities worldwide.
<p>
<center><h3>What You Can Do</h3></center>
<p>
Over the last few months, tremendous progress has occurred
in the fight against pornography, thanks largely to grassroots
support.  Your continued involvement will help keep these gains
intact.  Insist that child protection laws apply consistently
to all areas of society, including the Internet.  Urge your members
of Congress to support the pending Smith bill on military porn.

<h3>On the Hill</h3>
<p><a name="believers">
<B>Forsaken Brethren.</B>  FRC President Gary Bauer testified
on Feb. 15 before the House Subcommittee on International Operations
and Human Rights regarding anti-Christian persecution overseas.
Bauer testified that this persecution takes many forms, from
harassment of worshippers to, in Ethiopia, actual crucifixion.
Abuses seem to be especially prevalent in certain Moslem countries.
Bauer called for a more coherent response from the U.S. Government
and from U.S. religious leaders:  &quot;How much longer,&quot;
he said, &quot;can we allow persecuted Christians overseas to
call out, 'Why have you forsaken us?'&quot;
<p>
<B>CAREERS Update.</B>  The National Governors Association recently
released a statement urging final passage of the CAREERS bill
(H.R. 1617) within 30 days.  Progress in a House-Senate conference
committee to combine CAREERS with the Senate's Workforce Development
Act (S. 143) has been slow due to major differences between the
bills, which would consolidate job training programs.  The bills'
extensive Labor Market Information System and implementation of
a skill certificate system could threaten workers' economic freedom.
Governors favor consolidation, which gives them more authority
over state job training and economic development.
<p>
<B>Pro-Life Progress.</B> A short-term spending bill signed by
President Clinton on Jan. 26 included three pro-life measures.
They are:  a ban on federal funds for the experimental creation
of human embryos; a ban on federal funding of abortions for prison
inmates, except in the case of rape or life of the mother; and
a compromise restriction on international population funds.  The
compromise will bar funding until July 1 for organizations that
perform or promote abortions overseas, but allow funding thereafter
at reduced levels from 1995 spending.  Pro-life members of Congress
continue to seek permanent restrictions.
<p>
<center><h3>Around Town</h3></center>
<p>
<B>Innocent as Charged.</B> After a more than year-long federal
grand jury investigation, the Clinton Justice Department has found
no evidence of a national conspiracy to attack abortion clinics.
However, Attorney General Janet Reno has vowed to continue the
probe, and Rep. Chris Smith (R-N.J.) has called for congressional
hearings on the issue.  Meanwhile, federal and state prosecutors
have used the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances (FACE) act
to charge two peaceful pro-lifers, sidewalk counselors Carmen
Vazquez and Bobby Riley, with &quot;obstructing&quot; and 
&quot;interfering&quot; with women seeking abortions.
<p>
<B>Drug Fighter.</B> President Clinton has selected a get-tough
soldier to lead our nation's battle against drugs.  During his
State of the Union address, Clinton announced his decision to
tap Army Gen. Barry McCaffrey to replace drug czar Lee Brown,
who is now teaching in Texas.  Gen. McCaffrey is an expert on
narcotics trafficking who returns to Washington from a command
in Panama, where he has overseen U.S. cooperation with Latin American
and Caribbean nations on drug intelligence and interdiction since
February 1994. Drug abuse among American youth con-tinues to
rise.
<p>
<center><h3>Across the Nation</h3></center>
<p><a name="baer">
<B>Baer Backs &quot;Mule.&quot;</B> Federal Judge Harold Baer,
Jr. provoked a firestorm Jan. 24 when he threw out the drug trafficking
conviction of Carol Bayless.  Bayless was driving a car with 80
pounds of cocaine and heroin in the trunk. Two accomplices ran
when police observed them.  Judge Baer,  a Clinton appointee,
said: &quot;Residents in this neighborhood tend to regard police
officers as corrupt, abusive and violent.  Had the men not run
when the cops began to stare at them, it would have been unusual.&quot;
Bayless had confessed to being a regular drug courier (&quot;mule&quot;).
<p>
<B>PC &quot;Volunteers.&quot;</B>  Mandatory voluntarism takes
the spirit out of serving, argue many parents and secondary school
students.  Graduation requirements for &quot;volunteering&quot;
are prompted by Goals 2000, which encourages community service.
But what some programs call service is actually political activism.
Others exclude religious service activities.  The conflict over
mandatory service may soon reach the U.S. Supreme Court if a New
York decision upholding a service requirement is appealed.  Federal
parental rights legislation (S. 984, H.R. 1946) could provide
a remedy by defining parental authority in school matters.
<p>
<B>Army Salvation.</B> An Army wife, Tambra Hartmann, lost her
license to run a home-based day-care service on a military post
because she said grace with the children over meals and played
Christian music.  The children's parents selected the service
in part because it was faith-based.   Last November, the U.S.
Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the Army overstepped
its authority and violated the families' First Amendment freedoms.
The Army has changed the regulation to permit faith elements
as long as child-care providers inform parents of that fact before
enrollment.

<h3>Wedding Bans</h3>
<p>
Acting before Hawaiian courts mandate homosexual &quot;marriage,&quot;
which may occur in July, pro-family activists nationwide are working
to protect the definition of marriage.
<p>
In California, the state assembly voted 41 to 31 on Jan.
31 to prohibit the recognition of same-sex relationships as marriage.
A tougher vote is expected in the liberal Senate.  Utah enacted
a law in 1995 that defines marriage as the union of &quot;one
man and one woman&quot; and bars recognition of same-sex nuptials.
Other states considering such measures: Alabama, Alaska, Colorado,
Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, New Mexico, Oregon, Rhode Island,
South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia and Washington.  In Maine,
a marriage protection bill was introduced but withdrawn after
a lesbian legislator withdrew her own homosexual rights bill.
In Nebraska, a bill legalizing same-sex marriages has been introduced.
<p>
At the national level, a federal bill is being written to
reinforce the &quot;one-man, one-woman&quot; definition in all
policies, including Social Security and the military.  The tentative
title is the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), and a sponsor was
being sought at press time.
<p>
The gravity of the situation cannot be overstated.  If homosexual
&quot;marriage&quot; becomes law in Hawaii and is imposed on all
other states through the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the Constitution,
businesses will be forced to subsidize homosexuality, schoolchildren
will be taught that homosexuality is equivalent to marital sex,
and churches will be pushed into a religious &quot;ghetto,&quot;
where pressure will mount for conformity to civil law.  Redefining
marriage would redefine the family, giving homosexuals an uncontested
&quot;right&quot; to adopt children.
<p>
Citizens can do two things to preserve marriage:  1) contact
your state legislators and urge them to support current legislation
or to introduce a bill protecting marriage; 2) ask your congressman
and U.S. Senators to cosponsor the eventual federal bill.  The
Capitol Hill switchboard number is (202) 225-3121 or (202) 224-3121.

Marriage (513) 733-8908.

<h3>Wobbling on Welfare</h3>
<p>
The promise to &quot;end welfare as we know it&quot; remains
a popular talking point, but on Jan. 9 President Clinton vetoed
the welfare bill passed by congressional Republicans.
<p>
The nation's Governors have now advanced their own welfare
reform package, and regrettably they have chosen to abandon serious
attempts to reduce illegitimacy.  The House and Senate agreed
last year to prohibit states from using federal funds to increase
welfare payments to women who bear additional children while on
welfare, but would have allowed states to opt out of the prohibition.
<p>
While erasing the focus on illegitimacy, the Governors proposed
<I>adding</I> an extra $4 billion in child care funding.  Their
recommendation would increase spending on day care 49% more than
current law, without spending a penny on abstinence programs to
help reduce out-of-wedlock births.  The emphasis on child care
is ironic, since the Governors also moved to weaken the work requirements
passed by congressional Republicans.
<p>
In a letter to House colleagues, Congressman Jim Talent (R-Mo.)
argued that the last time Congress adopted a welfare plan proposed
by the Governors, a Democrat from Arkansas rode to the White House
partly on the strength of his pledge to fix the mess.  If the
Congress listens to the Governors' advice this year, it will have
committed itself to spending over half a trillion dollars to subsidize
fatherlessness through cash benefits, day care, job training,
and other services.
<p>
A recent FRC poll shows that three out of four Americans
believe that welfare encourages illegitimacy and, by a ratio of
two to one, that reducing illegitimacy is more important than
merely encouraging single mothers to support themselves.  A hefty
84% of Americans support a family cap, and an overwhelming majority
believe that work requirements should focus last on mothers with
preschool-aged children.  Both provisions would help reduce the
Governors' incentive to capture new federal dollars for child
care -- and would allay our concerns about leaving children, yet
again, at the mercy of public institutions.

<center><font size=+2><b><i>Foster Has a Future</i></b></font><br>
by Gary L. Bauer</center>
<p>
In his State of the Union Address on Jan. 23, President Clinton
made an appeal to pro-family Americans.  He talked about balancing
the budget, reforming welfare, attacking drug abuse, and reducing
the rate of teen pregnancy, among other things.  For Drug Czar,
the President made a choice American families warmly applauded,
Army Gen. Barry McCaffrey.  Now comes Clinton's Teenage Pregnancy
Czar, and the ovation is over:  Dr. Henry Foster, Planned Parenthood
advocate extraordinaire and failed nominee for Surgeon General,
is back in the saddle.
<p>
Almost a year ago, President Clinton tapped Dr. Foster to
replace Joycelyn Elders as Surgeon General, saying that he wanted
Foster's Nashville-based teen pregnancy program, &quot;I Have
A Future,&quot; replicated throughout the nation.  But part of
the reason Foster was rejected as Surgeon General was that his
program, like all contraceptive-based programs, proved a dismal
failure.  According to an evaluation by the Carnegie Corporation,
a program underwriter, participants in &quot;I Have a Future&quot;
actually had <I>higher</I> rates of sexual activity than those
outside the program.
<p>
This is not the kind of leadership that America wants or
needs to help combat teen pregnancy.  This is not the kind of
program that will help reach the President's stated goal of reducing
the teen pregnancy rate by one-third over the next 10 years. 
And this is surely not the kind of approach that will help our
children grow up to be responsible and mature adults.
<p>
The research is crystal clear.  Teenagers' best safeguard
against having or causing an out-of-wedlock pregnancy is to have
two loving parents involved in their lives.  But it's also important
to create a culture where the values that parents teach their
children are reinforced outside the home.  Several abstinence
programs have done just that, with excellent results.
<p>
For example, only 1.1 percent of participants in the Washington,
D.C.-based <I>Best Friends</I> program became pregnant, as opposed
to 25 percent of other girls in the city.  The abstinence curriculum
<I>Teen-Aid</I> helped to reduce the teen pregnancy rate in Jacksonville,
Florida, by 35 percent just three years after it was implemented.
Examples of other successful abstinence programs abound.
<p>
Tragically, the President has chosen to support ideology
over progress.  The Foster task force has been christened the
&quot;National Campaign to Reduce Teen Pregnancy.&quot;  Reducing
pregnancy among unmarried teens is a laudable goal.  But to reach
it we must have a sustained reversal of the sexual activity that
haunts the young with unprecedented rates of pregnancy, abortion,
disease and emotional heartbreak.  Unfortunately, the Foster
group has already admitted that it intends to promote contraception
rather than abstinence.
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>
<center><i><font size=+2>CLINTON CHOOSES IDEOLOGY<br>
OVER PROGRESS</font></i></center>
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>
While raising children well is a tough job, it's not impossible.
In truth, the teen pregnancy rate has been declining for the
last two years because more teens are choosing abstinence despite
all of the federal projects and cultural pressures promoting the
contrary.  Statistics published by the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention show that the drop in teen pregnancy rates reflects
a rising number of teens choosing to abstain from sex.
<p>
The familiar Scripture says, &quot;Train up a child in the
way he should go, and when he is old he will not turn from it.&quot;
(Proverbs 22:6).  Last June the U.S. Senate reviewed Dr. Foster's
credentials and told the President this <I>isn't</I> the way
we should go.  But the President has refused to turn from his
old friend.  So now it appears that Henry Foster has a future
in government.  It's our nation's young people for whom the future

<p>

&quot;<font size=+3>T</font>he Defense of Marriage Act is a powerful 
antidote to the destructive trend that has gripped this country at the 
hands of some injudicious judges.&quot; -- Gary Bauer, FRC president, 
before the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee on July 11, 1996.

<p>

On July 12, the House of Representatives approved the Defense
of Marriage Act (DOMA) by an overwhelming vote of 342 to 67.
The bill defines marriage for federal purposes as &quot;the union
of a man and a woman as husband and wife.&quot;  It also asserts
the power of Congress to interpret the Full Faith and Credit Clause
of the Constitution to protect the other 49 states if Hawaii legalizes
homosexual &quot;marriage&quot; as expected later this year.

<p>

<center><h3>Senate Action Soon</h3></center>

<p>

As of press time, DOMA was slated for Senate action before the
August 3 recess.  Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.) has threatened
to attach an amendment to the bill that would grant homosexuals
special workplace protection.  This could kill DOMA, since the
Kennedy amendment is an unacceptable, back-door way of enacting
federal gay rights legislation.  Calls are needed to Capitol Hill
to urge legislators to &quot;pass DOMA pure.&quot;

<p>

The swift consideration of DOMA is testament to the hard work
of thousands of pro-family activists who have pressed Congress
to act.  FRC's government relations staff report that Capitol
Hill has been inundated with calls and letters supporting DOMA.

<p>

On June 24, leaders of 11 state family policy councils allied
with FRC and Focus on the Family spoke in support of DOMA at a
Washington press conference that drew national and regional press
coverage.

<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>
<center><i><font size=+2>
"URGE LEGISLATORS TO<br>
PASS DOMA PURE"
</font></i></center>
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>

On July 3, FRC hosted a Capitol Hill briefing on DOMA with eight
experts who analyzed the faulty research on homosexuality and
addressed the importance of traditional marriage in law, culture,
education and adoption.  Speakers included author Dr. Jeffrey
Satinover,  Transformation Ex-Gay Ministry leader Anthony Falzarano,
Amherst Professor of Jurisprudence Hadley Arkes, FRC cultural
studies director Robert Knight, social work specialist Brenda
Destro, adoption expert Mary Beth Style, former school principal
and author Linda Page, journalist Peter LaBarbera, and Gary Bauer.

<p>

<center><h3>Briefing Highlights</h3></center>

<p>

The two-hour briefing ran live on C-SPAN, which repeated it three
times during the next two days.  Millions of Americans learned
facts about homosexuality and the homosexual political agenda
that are routinely omitted from media coverage.  Here are some
excerpts:

<p>

<b>Jeffrey Satinover, M.D.</b>, former Fellow in Psychiatry and Child
Psychiatry at Yale:  &quot;Two profoundly mistaken ideas have
sunk deeply into public sentiment where they exert a powerful
influence in the shaping of public policy as it relates to family,
sexuality and marriage.  1) Homosexuality is genetic, and that
consequently, 2) Homosexuality is unchangeable.  Neither idea
is true, and in fact there is a mountain of scientific evidence
to the contrary.&quot;

<p>

<b>Hadley Arkes</b>: &quot;Every argument for gay marriage is an argument
that would support polygamy.  The gay activists may not have the
remotest interest in promoting polygamy, but ... they have the
most profound interest...in discrediting the notion that marriage
finds its defining ground in 'nature.'  We can count on the fact
that there will be someone, somewhere, ready to press this issue
by raising a challenge in the court....&quot;

<p>

Anthony Falzarano: &quot;I speak to you today not just as an
observer of this movement, but as one of them.  I am a former
homosexual.  I lived that lifestyle from the time I was 17 until
I was 26.  I entered the gay lifestyle thinking that there really
wasn't any choice for me.  What I didn't realize is that although
I didn't choose to be homosexual, I did not have to be gay.  I
had a choice.... Many of us are sick and tired of a lifestyle
that initially seems very freeing but eventually puts us in all
kinds of bondage and eventually will kill us....&quot;

<h3>On the Hill</h3>

<p>

<b>Bill Emerson, RIP.</b>  A strong champion of the sanctity of
life and the family, Rep. Bill Emerson (Mo.) died of cancer June
22.  Emerson was universally admired by his colleagues and popular
with his constituents.  His public career was sparked by service
as a Congressional page at age 16.  The flag-waving families who
lined his funeral route and the members of Congress who paid him
tearful tribute during a July 12 memorial service offered praise
to his memory.  Emerson's quiet service was marked with integrity
and devotion.

<p>

<b>Istook Tries.</b> On July 11, the House passed the 1997 funding
bill for the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services and
Education. Defeated: a pro-family amendment offered by Rep.
Ernest Istook (R-Okla.) that would have required written parental
consent before a teenager receives any services, including abortion
referrals, under the Title X federal family planning program.
The House also defeated an attempt by Rep. Nita Lowey (D-N.Y.)
that would have allowed federally-funded human embryo experiments.
Current law prohibits such research on live human embryos.

<p>

<b>Unaccountable.</b> The House and Senate passed separate health
reform bills last spring with bipartisan support, yet no compromise
has been reached.  Sen. Ted Kennedy (D-Mass.) has been holding
the bill hostage by refusing to let the Senate leadership appoint
conferees.  Kennedy opposes medical savings accounts (MSAs), which
were contained in the House bill but narrowly defeated by the
Senate.  He has vowed to continue stalling until the leadership
appoints a majority of conferees opposed to MSAs. If Kennedy
succeeds, much-needed reforms (in access and ability to keep insurance
when changing jobs) will go by the boards.

<p>

<b>Jubilee Pits.</b> &quot;Come, Holy Spirit&quot; -- with those
words, Rep. Bob Dornan (R-Calif.) took the floor of Congress on
June 27 and defended his Christian faith, biblical sexual morality,
and FRC's role in exposing the homosexual &quot;circuit&quot;
party in a federal building in April. Dornan made the remarks
in response to a personal attack by fellow Rep. Steve Gunderson
(R-Wis.).  For a full transcript of Rep. Dornan's remarks as they
were printed in the <I>Congressional Record</I>, call 1-800-225-4008.

<p>

<center><h3>Around Town</h3></center>

<p><a name="fdabortion">

<b>FDA Variety Store.</b> In a highly unusual move, the Food
and Drug Administration (FDA) Reproductive Drug Advisory Committee
initiated hearings on two new abortion drugs -- hearings not solicited
by a drug manufacturer.  On June 28, the FDA committee decided
that increased dosages of oral contraceptives were &quot;safe&quot;
and &quot;effective&quot; for use as an abortifacient &quot;morning-after
pill.&quot;  Pro-abortion groups urged the FDA to force reluctant
manufacturers to relabel oral contraceptives for post-coital use.
On July 19, the same FDA committee considered approving RU-486
for use in the US.  FRC attended both hearings and  publicly opposed
both FDA actions.

<p>

<b>China MFN.</b> The Clinton administration prevailed in renewing
China's &quot;most favored nation&quot; (MFN) trade status for
the coming year.  On June 27, an effort to revoke China's MFN
status failed in the House of Representatives by vote of 141 to
286.  However, the House did pass a second, non-binding resolution
(H. Res. 461 by vote of 411 to 7) which called for hearings and
possible legislation to punish China for its military intimidation
of Taiwan, weapons sales, and human rights abuses.  FRC supports
hearings and opposes MFN for China because of its myriad human
rights abuses.

<p>

<center><h3>Across the Nation</h3></center>

<p>

<b>Five-ring Political Circus.</b> The 1996 Olympics in Atlanta
were, sadly, misused to advance the homosexual agenda.  The Olympic
torch run bypassed Cobb County, Georgia, and Greenville County,
South Carolina, because officials there passed resolutions opposing
homosexuality.  The torch was actually hidden in a van and driven
through Greenville County during the night.  Meanwhile, the Clinton
administration lifted the ban on HIV-infected immigrants for the
Olympics, just as was done earlier for the Gay Games in New York.
It's not known whether other infectious diseases got equal opportunity.

<p>

<b>First Advocate.</b> In a first-ever presidential interview
with a homosexual magazine, President Clinton told <I>The Advocate</I>
(June 25) that his administration &quot;has taken more steps than
any previous in bringing the gay and lesbian communities to the
table.&quot;  Los Angeles-based Liberation Publications, which
publishes <I>The Advocate</I>, also owns Alyson Publications,
a Boston-based publisher of <I>Heather Has Two Mommies, Daddy's
Roommate, Daddy's Wedding</I> and books about sado-masochistic
sex with children.  One book gives advice for homosexual pedophiles
on how to avoid prosecution.

<p><a name="marijuana">

<b>MUM's Not the Word.</b> California's &quot;Medical Use of
Marijuana&quot; initiative will appear on the November ballot.
International &quot;decriminalization&quot; promoters who have
bankrolled this initiative claim it will provide &quot;compassionate
use&quot; of marijuana without prescription for people with cancer,
AIDS and glaucoma, but the initiative allows use for &quot;any
other illness&quot; and would virtually legalize possession and
cultivation for anyone, including children.  The federal government
rejects smoking marijuana as a medicine because it has serious
physical and psychological consequences.  Physicians wishing to
prescribe THC, marijuana's active ingredient, have the FDA-approved
drug Marinol.

<h3>FRC: Ready and <i>Abel</i></h3>

<p>

The Supreme Court will decide this September whether to hear the
first challenge to the Pentagon's new ban on homosexuals in the
military.  This appeal was prompted by the high court's recent
ruling that Colorado cannot constitutionally bar &quot;special
rights&quot; laws for homosexuals.

<p>

On July 1, 1996, former Navy Lieutenant Paul Thomasson, who was
discharged for proclaiming, &quot;I am gay,&quot; asked the high
court to hear his case.  He challenged both the law passed by
Congress and the Clinton administration's regulations on homosexuality
in the armed forces.

<p>

Thomasson lost his challenge in both the federal district and
appeals courts.  The appeals court hearing was noteworthy because
it included oral argument presented on behalf of the Family Research
Council.  FRC had filed two briefs in this case, both of which
thoroughly exposed the administration's illegal plans to use the
military to legitimize homosexuality.

<p>

Thomasson's attorney said his appeal decision was influenced by
the high court's <I>Romer v. Evans</I> ruling, which struck
down Colorado's &quot;special rights&quot; amendment.  He claims
that the judicial landscape has improved greatly with <I>Romer</I>.
Writing for the Supreme Court's minority in the <I>Romer</I>
decision, Justice Antonin Scalia said there is &quot;no foundation
in American constitutional law&quot; for the court's ruling.

<p>

It's expected the Clinton Justice Department will favor the appeal
request.  If the court accepts <I>Thomasson</I>, oral arguments
will likely be held this fall with a decision next spring.  The
military's ban should be upheld -- if the Supreme Court relies
on the constitution.

<p>

FRC's Military Readiness Project (MRP) has participated in 12
homosexual court cases so far.  Should the <I>Thomasson</I> case
be heard, the MRP will file an amicus brief and ask the high court
for time to make oral argument.

<p>

Meanwhile, also on July 1, 1996, the U.S. Court of Appeals for
the Second Circuit returned the <I>Abel et al. v. Perry</I> case
to federal district court directing that judge to determine whether
the military can constitutionally exclude soldiers who engage
in homosexual conduct.  The lower court previously ruled that
the First and Fifth Amendment rights of the six service members
in <I>Abel</I> were violated when the military sought to discharge
them based solely on their <I>admission</I> of homosexuality,
without regard to actual conduct.

<h3>Ban the Postcards!</h3>

<p>

The Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act passed the House of Representatives
and the Senate and was vetoed by President Clinton on April 10,
1996.  The House will first attempt to override the President's
veto shortly after Labor Day. A two-thirds majority of those
present and voting is required to override.  If the House vote
is successful, the Senate is expected to make an override attempt
shortly thereafter. These are crucial pro-life votes.

<p>

On June 29-30, the nation's Catholic bishops sponsored a massive
pro-life postcard campaign (in local churches) to members of Congress
to urge support for the override.  It is expected that millions
of postcards will flood Capitol Hill in the next month or two.
The House Post Office has reportedly hired extra workers to deal
with the heavy influx of cards.

<p>

The Clinton White House is not waiting for the cards to react,
however. Administration officials at the Pentagon attempted to 
silence Catholic chaplains on military bases by issuing a directive 
forbidding them to mention the postcard campaign in church. They 
claimed it involved &quot;partisan political activity,&quot; a 
claim belied by the fact that the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban was 
passed overwhelmingly by bipartisan majorities in both houses of 
Congress.  Many Catholic service members and their families believe 
that they were illegally denied the guidance of their priests and 
bishops on this vital issue. A legal defense fund which specializes 
in religious liberty cases is reportedly planning to file suit on 
behalf of military chaplains who believe that their First Amendment 
rights were violated.

<p>

FRC urges concerned citizens to call on their legislators to override
the veto by talking with them personally, especially at local
&quot;town meetings&quot; during the August congressional recess.
Calls and/or letters to the members' district offices are also
encouraged.  Please continue to educate your friends and neighbors
about partial-birth abortions by writing &quot;letters to the
editor&quot; to local newspapers, participating in radio talk
shows, etc.

<font size=+2><b><i>The Court's Conscientious Dissenter</i></b></font><br>
by Gary L. Bauer
</center>

<p>

<font size=+3>J</font>ustice Antonin Scalia is making a name for himself 
as a conscientious objector to a Supreme Court run amok.  He is heard 
most often from the dissenting side these days, frequently accompanied 
by Chief Justice Rehnquist and Associate Justice Clarence Thomas.
His dissents are noteworthy -- some would say notorious.  Justice
Scalia has an uncanny knack for cutting through the majority's
sophistry and sloppy self-justification to make a stunning legal
defense of American tradition, true democracy, plain old common
sense and decency.

<p>

Scalia shines the light of truth on &quot;this most illiberal
Court, which has embarked on a course of inscribing one after
another of the current preferences of the society (and in some
cases only the counter-majoritarian preferences of the society's
law trained elite) into our Basic Law.&quot;  He believes that
it is &quot;no business of the courts (as opposed to the political
branches) to take sides in the cultural war.&quot;  We at FRC
believe the same, and Scalia's measured umbrage is our vicarious
voice.

<p>

In response to special rights gained by the well-funded gay lobby
in several Colorado cities, voters across the state approved a
constitutional amendment that would prevent any person from getting
such legal privileges solely on the basis of their homosexuality.
The Court majority said that the amendment was unconstitutional
because it was obviously born of hatred against gays, despite
what the Coloradans say.

<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>
<center><i><font size=+2>
THE COURT UNASHAMEDLY<br>
OVERSTEPS ITS AUTHORITY.
</font></i></center>
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>

Scalia retorted that &quot;[t]he Court's portrayal of Coloradans
as a society fallen victim to pointless, hate-filled 'gay-bashing'
is so false as to be comical.&quot;  He also deplored the sinister
effect of the Court's &quot;verbally disparaging as bigotry adherence
to traditional attitudes.&quot;  Scalia charged the majority with
&quot;tak[ing] sides in the culture wars,&quot; specifically,
choosing &quot;the views and values of the lawyer class from which
the Court's Members are drawn&quot; and supporting this choice
&quot;by inventing a novel and extravagant constitutional doctrine.&quot;

<p>

The Court unashamedly overstepped its authority, he wrote: &quot;Amendment
2 is designed to prevent piecemeal deterioration of the sexual
morality favored by a majority of Coloradans, and is not only
an appropriate means to that legitimate end, but a means that
Americans have employed before.  Striking it down is an act, not
of judicial judgment, but of political will.&quot;

<p>

Scalia took up his pen again in the case challenging the male-only
admissions policy at the Virginia Military Institute:  &quot;Since
it is entirely clear that the Constitution of the United States
-- the old one -- takes no sides in this educational debate, I
dissent....Today the Court shuts down an institution that has
served the people of the Commonwealth of Virginia with pride and
distinction for over a century and a half.&quot;  To do that,
it &quot;sweeps aside the precedents of this Court, and ignores
the history of our people.&quot;

<p>

In one of the last cases of the term, Justice Scalia rhetorically
shook his head: &quot;The court must be living in another world.
Day by day, case by case, it is busy designing a Constitution
for a country I do not recognize.&quot;

<p>

Those are stark words from the bench, words befitting the steady
dismantling of legislative prerogatives today's &quot;conservative&quot;
Supreme Court is engaged in.  But Scalia is no doomsayer.  A recent
report of a celebration of his first 10 years on the bench with
his present and former law clerks noted that, despite his angry
dissents, Justice Scalia is a happy man with a sense of hope.
Apparently he knows, as we know, that ours is not in the winning,
but in the trying.

<TITLE>Wlliam R. Mattox JR. Article</TITLE>

<CENTER><H2>A Lesson for Allison</H2>
by <br>
Wlliam R. Mattox JR. <p>
THE WALL STREET JOURNAL<BR>
THURSDAY, APRIL 28, 1994<P>

</CENTER><HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 50%>
<P>
	I am not the kind of guy who normally takes part in feminist "consciousness-raising" efforts.  But I am participating in Take Your Daughter to Work Day today because I have an eight-year-old daughter whose self-esteem matters a great deal to me.
<P>
	For the uninitiated, Take Your Daughter To Work Day is an annual event dreamed up by the Ms. Foundation in response to research showing that girls' self-esteem often plummets during the fragile pre-teen and early adolescent years.  By exposing young girls to successful women in the workplace, organizers hope that girls will learn to think more highly of females in general and of themselves in particular.
<P>
	I have a great day planned for my daughter, Allison.  This morning, I plan to take her by the offices of two women whose job it is to meet regularly with members of Congress and other public officials.  Then, I plan to have her talk with a young woman who just finished graduate school at Johns Hopkins University and is now serving as a health policy analyst.  At lunch, she'll chat with a woman who does some public speaking, and another who crunches numbers in our accounting department.  Finally, in the late afternoon, Allison is scheduled to meet with a woman who used to practice law and now manages a bevy of staff writers.
<P>
	I am sure all of this will be interesting to Allison.  But the time I am most looking forward to is the ride home.  For it is then that I plan to point out to my daughter that some of the exciting tasks carried out by my female colleagues in the workplace are tasks my wife performed in jobs she held prior to motherhood.  She used to meet regularly with congressmen and senators.  She used to do some writing and public speaking.  And she has a Phi Beta Kappa key from hr college days.
<P>
	After I remind my daughter of these things, I plan to turn to her and look her in the eye and say, "Allison, you must be a very special young girl.  Your mother could be using her talents and skills in all sorts of jobs in the workplace, but she has chosen instead to use them at home teaching you.  She must love you very, very much and think you are very, very important."
<P>
	Somehow, I think that at that moment my daughter' self-esteem will rise to a level heretofore unimagined by the organizers of Take Your Daughter to Work Day.  And for that I owe debt of gratitude to my wife, whose esteem-building job as a mother at home rarely receives the public esteem it deserves.
<P>

<a name="family"><center><h1>Family Hopes</h1></center>
<p>
<font size=+3>C</font>ontrary to the impression left by the recent O.J. Simpson 
trial, a large majority of black Americans support get-tough efforts to combat 
crime.
<p>
According to FRC's newly released Family Issues Survey, 82 percent
of blacks favor &quot;requiring convicted criminals to work while serving their 
sentence.&quot; Seventy-seven percent favor &quot;requiring convicted criminals 
to pay their victims and their victims' families financial compensation for the
pain, suffering, and economic hardship they caused.&quot;  Moreover,
85 percent of blacks favor &quot;requiring criminals to undergo drug tests to show 
that they are drug-free before completing their sentence.&quot;
<p>
<center><h3>Choose Life</h3></center>
<p>
The FRC poll, conducted by the Voter/Consumer Research Firm, also
found that:
<p>
<li><b>Adoption is considered the best response -- and abortion the
worst response -- to an unwed pregnancy.</b>
<p>
When asked what is the best response to an unmarried pregnancy,
29 percent choose adoption, 24 percent say marrying the child's father, 11 
percent choose single motherhood, eight percent opt for abortion, and the 
rest either volunteer that &quot;it depends&quot; or say they &quot;don't 
know.&quot; Conversely, when asked which of these options would be worst, 55 
percent say abortion, 13 percent say single motherhood, 12 percent say marrying 
the child's father, and six percent choose adoption.
<p>
<li><b>Most Americans -- including rank-and-file pro-lifers -- strongly
oppose subsidizing illegitimate births.</b>
<p>
Opposition runs strong and deep to &quot;increasing a welfare
mother's monthly welfare check if she has another child out of wedlock.&quot; 
Two-thirds (66 percent) say they &quot;strongly&quot; oppose such
increases.  Another 18 percent &quot;somewhat&quot; oppose welfare
benefit increases for illegitimacy. 
<p>
Only 13 percent say these increases are justified. Among those
who &quot;strongly&quot; favor laws against abortion, 70 percent 
&quot;strongly&quot; support the family cap, and another 16 percent 
&quot;somewhat&quot; support this measure.
<p>
<li><b>The religiously devout are more apt to give and volunteer --
and say they would do more if government welfare programs were dramatically 
cut or abolished.</b>
<p>
People who attend worship services at least once a week report
higher levels of giving (97 percent) and volunteering (79 percent) than any 
other demographic group. Frequent churchgoers are also more likely to say they 
would give and volunteer more if &quot;government welfare programs
were cut back dramatically, or abolished.&quot;
<p>
<li><b>Even young people think today's popular culture encourages
teen sex, violence and drug use.</b>
<p>
When asked to assess the degree to which today's movies, television,
and music lyrics encourage teenage sex, 63 percent of young Americans say 
&quot;a great deal&quot; or &quot;quite a lot.&quot;  Fifty-six percent
offer identical responses to a question about the entertainment
industry's role in encouraging violent crime, and 47 percent say the same 
about pop culture's contribution to alcohol and drug abuse. Moreover, 75 percent 
of Americans aged 18 to 30 either &quot;strongly&quot; or &quot;somewhat&quot; 
agree with the statement, &quot;The values promoted in today's movies,
on TV, and in music lyrics do not represent my own views.&quot;
<p>
<li><b>Single parents say families need help shielding kids from harmful
cultural influences.</b>
<P>
Only 36 percent of all single parents -- and 33 percent of divorcees
-- say parents can adequately shield children from violent or sexually-explicit 
material by themselves.  Better than 60 percent of single parents agree 
with the statement, &quot;These days, it is too difficult for parents to deal 
with this alone.&quot;  Moreover, 92 percent of all those surveyed say they
do not believe public libraries should make <i>Playboy</i> magazine available 
to children without parental permission.
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>
<center><i><font size=+2>FOUR FIFTHS OF AMERICANS<br>
FAVOR FAMILY TAX RELIEF.</font></i></center>
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>
<li><b>Most Americans strongly support permanent tax relief for families
raising children.</b>
<p>
Roughly four out of five Americans (79 percent) favor tax relief
for families raising children. Sixty-one percent say they would rather have 
&quot;a permanent tax cut beginning next year&quot; than &quot;a
temporary tax cut beginning this year.&quot;  Only 26 percent
say they would prefer temporary relief immediately.

<p>
<h3>On the Hill</h3>
<p>
<b>Partial Victory.</b> Accommodating the request of a majority of senators,
a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing was held on the Partial-Birth Abortion 
Ban Act (H.R. 1833) on Nov. 17. The bill passed the House by vote of 288-139 
on Nov. 1, drawing the votes of such infrequent supporters of abortion limits 
as Minority Leader Richard Gephardt (D-Mo.) and freshman Rep.
Patrick Kennedy (D-R.I.).  Nurse Brenda Shafer told the Senate
committee that she assisted an Ohio abortionist with several partial-birth 
abortions, but was repulsed and then quit.  Senate floor action is likely 
before Dec. 7.  The Clinton White House continues to signal a veto.
<p><a name="gambling">
<b>Gambling Scourge.</b> Rep. Frank Wolf's bill (H.R. 497) to create
The National Gambling Impact and Policy Commission is gaining momentum. The 
bill, which has broad bipartisan support, does not outlaw, tax, or regulate 
gambling, but recognizes its growing influence. In 1993, Americans
made more trips to casinos than they did to major league ballparks.
 Today, casinos operate in 23 states, and 37 states have lotteries.  Studies 
show that gambling increases public corruption and other criminal activities. 
It cannibalizes legitimate businesses, and government's gambling-related
costs for regulation, lost productivity and family disintegration
outstrip the economic gain.
<p>
<b>Budget Break?</b> The battle between Congress and the White House
moved to the next stage Nov. 19 with an agreement to enact a balanced budget 
within seven years, using Congressional Budget Office (CBO) economic estimates. 
President Clinton reversed course and agreed to negotiate legislation by Jan. 
1 to achieve the zero deficit goal. Republican concessions on
spending control are likely.   FRC will work hard to keep the
$500-per-child tax credit in the GOP bill, as well as real spending limits 
to avoid leaving our children a legacy of debt.
<p>
<center><h3>Around Town</h3></center>
<p>
<b>Playing the Odds.</b> Gambling industry political action committees
(PAC) are influencing legislation such as proposals to tax gambling revenues 
and regulate the American Indian gaming boom.  Gambling is projected to grow 
to an $80-billion-per-year industry this decade. According to the Federal 
Election Commission, PACs gave $321,942 to the major political parties in 
1993-94, and four non-PAC industry gifts totaling $690,000 went to the 
Republican National Committee in 1994. Columnist William Safire warns 
that state-sponsored gambling is a &quot;cancer ravaging society, corrupting 
public officials and becoming the fastest-growing teenage addiction.&quot;
<p>
<b>Murphy Brown Sweeps.</b> According to a new Census Bureau report,
America is experiencing a rise in the number of Murphy Brown-style moms. 
The study, released in early November, shows that the proportion of 
college-educated, never-married women who have given birth has more
than doubled in the past 10 years, while the proportion of young,
single, black women giving birth has dropped. The report also says that 
the illegitimacy rate among all never-married white women rose from 6.7 
percent to 12.9 percent.  The greatest rise in this group was, indeed, among 
women who are managers and professionals.
<p><a name="divorce">
<b>Divorce, American Style.</b> The U.S. divorce rate dropped slightly
in 1994, but <i>The Economist</i> magazine reports that divorce is still more 
common in America than anywhere else in the world. To combat this problem, 
a growing number of pro-family state leaders are working to reform
divorce laws to protect individuals who want to save their marriages
rather than promote the interests of individuals initiating divorce proceedings. 
By a margin of 55 percent to 31 percent, Americans support such reforms, 
according to FRC's newly-released Family Issues Survey.
<p>
<center><h3>Across the Nation</h3></center>
<p>
<b>FRC Intervenes.</b> In a highly unusual move, the Fourth U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals granted a motion Nov. 20 that will permit FRC to present 
oral arguments in a key case involving homosexuals in the military. The 
case <i>Thomasson v. Perry</i> is likely to reach the Supreme Court next 
year. FRC sought to intervene in the appeals court to argue that the
Clinton administration regulations at issue do not faithfully reflect 
Congressional intent and will result in allowing declared homosexuals 
to serve.  Melissa Wells-Petry, a former Army litigator, will represent 
FRC at the Dec. 5 hearing.
<p>
<b>Young Guns.</b> A quarter of those arrested on weapons charges are
juveniles, and such offenses are the fastest growing crime among adolescents. 
Juvenile weapons cases have grown 86 percent since 1985 to more than 61,000 
arrests last year, and teen gun violence has risen steadily even
though the number of teens has declined.  Weapons offenses include
illegal use, possession, importing or exporting of guns, ammunition and the 
like.  Attorney General Janet Reno warns, &quot;If the last decade's trends 
continue unchecked, juvenile arrests for violent crime will double by the
year 2010.&quot;
<p>
<b>Money Talks.</b> A record turnout of Maine voters narrowly rejected
a proposal on November's ballot to deny special rights to homosexuals.  Four 
hundred thousand voters took part in the 53 to 47 percent outcome.  
Pro-homosexual rights forces spent an unprecedented $1.2 million, 10 times 
more than those who oppose special rights.  Despite the close vote, 
homosexual activists are pushing ahead with their plans to introduce gay rights 
bills into the Maine legislature for the 10th time.  None has passed to date.

<h3>The Bare Non-Necessities</h3>
<p>
Did local schools notice the difference when 89 percent of the
U.S. Education Department's 5,500 employees were sent home as 
&quot;non-essential&quot; federal workers during the recent budget show-down? 
Equally unnoticeable is any improvement resulting from Washington D.C.'s 
recurrent attempts at top-down education reform:  National Education Goals,
the Goals Panel, Goals 2000, the National Standards for U.S. History.  With all 
the rhetoric and frenzy over initiatives with such visionary titles, you'd 
expect to see some results as 1995 draws to a close.
<p>
But when the National Education Goals Panel met in November to provide a 
halftime report on progress toward the eight National Education Goals, set in 
1990 for the year 2000, they could point to no significant improvement. 
&quot;Progress is spotty at best,&quot; said Albert Shanker, President of 
the American Federation of Teachers union.  The panelists urged patience; 
Americans put up $3 million this year to hear the Goals Panel stall for time.
<p>
Americans are growing increasingly impatient with dismal academic
test scores year after year. Recently released results from the 1994 
National Assessment of Educational Progress remain poor: less than a 
third of the students tested were proficient readers; 57 percent of high 
school seniors scored &quot;below basic&quot; in their knowledge of U.S.
history.  Writers of the National Standards for U.S. History released last 
year thought they could improve performance by imposing an official body 
of knowledge.  However, if the 30,000 copies already distributed make their 
way into classrooms, students will continue to know more about Madonna,
whom the standards mention, than they do about Robert E. Lee, whom the standards 
ignore.
<p>
Regrettably, our millions earmarked for education reform over
the past five years have been ill-spent on bureaucracy and systems management. 
Bill Bennett, former Secretary of Education, suggested in 1989, &quot;I'd 
give the education reform movement another five years.  If we're not able
to get our schools back to where they were in 1963, after spending
40 percent more, then maybe we should just declare bankruptcy, give the people 
back their money, and let them start their own schools.&quot;  Time's up. We 
want our money back.

<h3>We the Parents</h3>
<p>
FRC has taken its battle for parental rights to the Supreme
Court.  FRC joined forces with the Of the People Foundation and asked the 
high court to hear the case of Massachusetts students and parents who oppose 
a school district's program of condom distribution to junior high and high
school students.  A &quot;friend of the court&quot; petition was
filed on Nov. 15.
<p>
In early 1992 the Falmouth School District adopted a policy
whereby school nurses were instructed to distribute free condoms to students 
as young as 11 years old -- even over their parents' objections.  Condom 
machines were also installed in high school student restrooms. FRC's brief 
argues that the program violates the parents' right to direct the upbringing 
of their children as well as the right to free exercise of religion.
<p>
In 1993, New York's highest court ruled that an identical public school 
condom distribution program violated the right of parents to rear their children 
as they see fit.
<p>
This dispute highlights the need for legislation to acknowledge
and solidify parents' fundamental rights.  To accomplish this, Sen. Charles 
Grassley (R-Iowa) and Rep. Steve Largent (R-Okla.) have introduced the 
Parental Rights and Responsibilities Act of 1995 (H.R. 1946).  The
act establishes the fundamental right of parents to direct and
provide for the education and religious teaching of their children, and also 
addresses health care decisions and reasonable corporal discipline. Importantly, 
the act allows the government to intervene when it has a compelling interest 
to do so, and has specific allowances for cases of child abuse and neglect.
<p>
Support this much-needed legislation by calling or writing
your representatives today.

<p><hr width=30% size=2><p>
<center><font size=+2><b><i>Looking for Lincoln</i></b></font><br>
by Gary L. Bauer</center>
<p>
<font size=+3>G</font>en. Colin L. Powell has declined to run for President in 
1996. He has also said that he will not accept the Vice Presidency, though 
time may change this decision. Finally, he is joining the Republican party. 
These are crucial decisions.
<p>
As everyone knows by now, Powell had described himself as 
&quot;pro-choice&quot; on abortion during an interview with ABC's 
Barbara Walters on the eve of his national book tour.  That position, 
combined with the warm reaction to his candidacy among some conservative
leaders in Washington, raised the real possibility that, for the first time 
in two decades, the Republican platform next year would reflect a 
&quot;pro-choice&quot; position on abortion.
<p>
The media response to this prospect, as well as to Powell, was
wild excitement.  From a strict news sense, it's not hard to understand why. 
A Powell candidacy presented historic opportunities: the nomination and 
possible election of the first black American President. Second, a GOP 
abandonment of its pro-life plank would have caused an earthquake
on the American political landscape.  Earthquakes are hard news.
<p>
The Republican Platform calls for a constitutional amendment to provide legal 
protection for the unborn.  It also calls for the appointment of judges who 
respect traditional values and the sanctity of innocent human life.  Has it 
made much difference?  One conservative leader has said that a pro-choice 
president like Powell &quot;could do more to lower the number of abortions 
than a presidential candidate who claims to be pro-life, who supports a 
constitutional amendment to ban abortions, but who does nothing more than pay 
lip-service to the pro-life constituency.&quot;
<p>
Of course, pro-life Americans want no part of this leader's dilemma.
 They prefer a third way: someone, Republican or Democratic, who not only claims 
to be, but is, pro-life, who supports full legal protection for the unborn, 
and who will pay service to that goal in both speech and action.
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>
<center><i><font size=+2>PERSISTENCE ISN'T<br>
ALWAYS APPRECIATED.</font></i></center>
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>
So why are pro-life Americans so often made to feel like skunks at the wedding 
party?  Partly, I'm sure, it's because nothing is more alien to the modern 
American mind than a moral absolute, even when that absolute is the 
overwhelming duty to refrain from taking innocent human life.  Second,
there is the matter of persistence.  It isn't always appreciated.
<p>
In his <i>Lincoln: The War Years</i>, Carl Sandburg retells the story
of a White House reception after Lincoln's Second Inaugural. Frederick 
Douglass, the black anti-slavery leader, tried to enter the White House 
to greet the President.  Guards barred his way.  Douglass eluded them 
and rushed through the door.  He was seized and escorted to a plank that
led outside through a window. Once again on the street, he asked a 
passerby entering the White House to tell Lincoln that &quot;Frederick 
Douglass is detained by officers at the door.&quot;
<p>
Hearing the news, Lincoln invited Douglass into the East Room, and the 
journalist finally greeted the reelected president.  Lincoln told Douglass 
that he had seen him in the crowd listening to his address. &quot;There 
is no man's opinion that I value more than yours,&quot; Lincoln told him, 
&quot;what do you think of it?&quot;  Douglass replied, &quot;Mr. Lincoln, 
it was a sacred effort.&quot;
<p>
In this world of slippery slope relativism, where rights to do
wrong are enshrined among our political commandments, the pro-life cause 
is often treated like an unwelcome guest.  As 1996 approaches, some of 
the political &quot;palace guards&quot; are already trying to show us to the 
window again.  As they do so, we could use a little of the spirit of
Frederick Douglass.  After all, this cause is a sacred effort, too.

<center><h1>TYRANNY IN ROBES</h1></center>

<p>

<font size=+3>O</font>n May 20, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a ruling 
whose destructive power may rival the infamous <I>Roe v. Wade</I> 
(1973) decision.

<p>

In <I>Romer v.  Evans</I>, the court voted 6-3 to strike
down a voter-approved amendment to Colorado's constitution that
would have prevented homosexuality from being added to civil rights
laws by the state and local governments.  The people of Colorado
had voted for Amendment 2 in response to adoption of homosexual
rights laws in several cities, including Denver and Aspen.  The
amendment took no rights away from homosexuals, merely ensuring
that homosexuality would not receive preferential treatment.

<p>

<center><h3>800,000 Bigots?</h3></center>

<p>

Justice Anthony Kennedy, writing for the majority, concluded
that the voters were motivated only by &quot;animus&quot; toward
homosexuals, seeking to deny them access to the political process.
In effect, he called more than 800,000 Coloradans &quot;hate-filled
bigots&quot; for withholding a powerful legal weapon from homosexual
activists.

<p>

In a scathing dissent, Justice Antonin Scalia said the ruling
has &quot;no foundation in American constitutional law and barely
pretends to. ... Amendment 2 is designed to prevent piecemeal deterioration
of the sexual morality favored by a majority of Coloradans ... striking
it down is an act, not of judicial judgment, but of political
will.&quot;

<p>

Scalia noted that under the court's reasoning, polygamists
could demand redress because they are disadvantaged by state laws
prohibiting polygamy.  He asked whether the court had somehow
concluded that polygamy was a greater social harm than homosexuality.
Scalia also noted that the majority had completely ignored the
1986 <I>Bowers v. Hardwick</I> case, which established that states
can criminalize sodomy.  If states can do that, he wrote, then
surely they can deny &quot;preferential treatment&quot; to a class
that defines itself solely by its willingness to engage in that
behavior.

<p>

Homosexual activists celebrated the <I>Romer</I> ruling.
Conservative activist Paul Weyrich and Colorado for Family Values
President Will Perkins called for impeachment of the six majority
justices, who include Reagan appointee Kennedy, Sandra Day O'Connor
(Reagan), David Souter (Bush), John Paul Stevens (Ford),  Stephen
Breyer (Clinton) and Ruth Bader Ginsburg (Clinton).  Other leaders
raised the question of judicial term limits and of activating
Congress' constitutional power to limit which cases the Supreme
Court can rule upon.

<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>
<center><i><font size=+2>
"NOT JUDICIAL JUDGMENT,<br>
BUT POLITICAL WILL."
</font></i></center>
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>

The court did stop short of elevating &quot;sexual orientation&quot;
to the same level of protection as race, ethnicity and other traditional
civil rights categories.  But the legal effect may be less than
the cultural effect.  Within hours of the decision, a lesbian
attorney in Florida said the court had ruled that homosexuality
could not be taken into account in child custody cases.  The court
did no such thing, but such broad interpretations can now be expected
to be routinely advanced in homosexuality-related cases.

<p>

<center><h3>Pass DOMA Now</h3></center>

<p>

Citizens who believe in traditional morality and the rule
of law must now rally around the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA),
a federal bill that defines marriage as &quot;the union of one
man and one woman as husband and wife&quot; and allows states
to ignore out-of-state marriage licenses issued to homosexual
couples.

<p>

Liberal judges in Hawaii are expected to legalize homosexual
&quot;marriage&quot; as early as September, and homosexuals are
preparing to fly to Hawaii, get &quot;married,&quot; and claim
marital status in their home states.  Given the Supreme Court's
usurpation of power in Colorado, passage of DOMA (H.R. 3396) and
(S. 1740) is imperative.  DOMA will reassert the constitutional
authority of Congress, send the courts the message that America
will not surrender to homosexual activists, and secure marriage
against radical redefinition.  So far, 11 states have passed bills
protecting marriage, but DOMA is needed immediately to protect
the federal code and state marriage laws.

<p>

<center><h3>What You Can Do</h3></center>

<p>

Call or write your senators and congressman and urge them
to sponsor DOMA, not merely pledge to vote for it.  The Capitol
Hill switchboard is 202-225-3121.  Addresses:  U.S. Senate, Washington,
D.C.  20510; U.S. House of Representatives, Washington, D.C. 
20515.  Also, ask your state representatives to pass a marriage
protection law at the state level.

<p>

<h3>On the Hill</h3>

<p>

<b>Medicare Package.</b> The Medicare trustees issued a report
on June 5 indicating that Medicare Part A (payment for hospital
costs) may become insolvent by 2001.  The Part A trust fund lost
$2.6 billion in 1995.  The trustees recommended that an independent
commission develop a long-term strategy. Congress passed a budget
last year which limited projected increases in Medicare spending
to an annual average of 6.4 percent.  President Clinton vetoed
that plan and insists that Congress enact his more limited proposal.
An election year resolution of this issue is unlikely.

<p>

<b>No Relief in Sight.</b> Family tax relief continues to receive
consideration on Capitol Hill, even as the presidential candidates
float various tax cut plans.  Congressional leaders may include
the child credit in a package with welfare and Medicaid reform,
or include it as part of a separate tax package.  President Clinton
threatens to veto any bill that contains the Republicans' proposed
Medicaid reforms, but it does not appear that he will sign the
tax cuts without comparable cuts in spending.  Sounds like another
&quot;Catch-22&quot; situation.

<p><a name="privacy">

<b>Preventing Predators.</b> The Children's Privacy Protection
and Parental Empowerment Act of 1996 was introduced by Congressman
Bob Franks (R-N.J.) on May 22. The purpose of this bill is to
empower parents to further protect their children from child predators.
The bill would allow parents to learn what information commercial
vendors have obtained about their children, where the information
originated, and where it has been distributed.  People who prey
on children should not be able to purchase, receive, sell, or
in any way handle personal information about children.

<p>

<center><h3>Around Town</h3></center>

<p>

<b>No Federal Cradle.</b> Many news stories on the Stand for
Children rally sponsored by the Children's Defense Fund asked
the same questions FRC raised at a press conference the day before
the event:  Is more spending on failed federal programs really
helping children?  Or are liberal advocacy groups just using children
as props to make one last stand for big government?  FRC argued
that strong parents are still the best advocates for children.
Society's role is to help rebuild healthy communities that strengthen
the hands of those who rock the cradles.

<p>

<b>Dues Under Duress.</b> A new House Republican task force on
labor policy has recommended legislation that would protect union
members from being forced to pay dues to fund partisan politics.
In the 1994 election, 40 percent of union members voted for conservative
candidates while union chiefs generally backed liberals.  Giving
workers an option to restrict their dues to collective bargaining
purposes is an obvious way to protect the integrity of representative
government while protecting workers' interests -- and putting
hard-earned dollars back in the pockets of American workers.

<p>

<b>Justice Denied.</b> Some black youngsters in a Washington,
D.C. suburb were almost denied the chance to see how faith and
hard work can pay off in America.  Supreme Court Justice Clarence
Thomas was publicly disinvited to speak at a student awards ceremony
in early June when a school official threatened to disrupt the
event.  Although the school board ultimately voted to reinvite
Thomas, the whole spectacle sent a troubling message to students,
who, fortunately, ultimately got to hear Thomas's powerful message
of personal virtue and equality before the law.

<p>

<center><h3>Across the Globe</h3></center>

<p><a name="beijing">

<b>Costly Habitat.</b> From June 3-14 in Istanbul, Turkey, Habitat
II, the United Nations Conference on Human Settlements, built
on the anti-family agendas of previous U.N. conferences, this
time focusing on the environmental and economic challenges of
rapid urbanization.  Urging more efforts to implement that agenda,
Clinton Secretary of State Warren Christopher called for a moratorium
on further U.N. world conferences.  And none too soon.  A recent
General Accounting Office study found that the U.S. Government
spent a whopping $5.9 million on the U.N. Conference on Women
held last September in Beijing, China.

<p>

<b>Rewarding Tyranny.</b> On June 3, President Clinton formally
announced his intention to extend &quot;most favored nation&quot;
(MFN) trade privileges to China.  Unless Congress quickly opposes
Clinton's stand, China will continue to enjoy low tariffs on exports
to the U.S.  FRC opposes extending China's MFN status not only
because the U.S. runs a trade deficit of $34 billion every year
with China, but especially because of China's myriad human rights
abuses, such as forced abortion and sterilization policies, exploitation
of prisoners as slave laborers, and systematic persecution of
Christians.

<p>

<b>Wirth Stumbles.</b> During a Senate Foreign Relations Committee
hearing June 4, chairman Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) put two questions
to witness Timothy Wirth, Undersecretary of State for Global Affairs.
Citing Hillary Clinton's speech during the U.N. Beijing conference,
where she strongly denounced sex selection abortion and mandatory
abortion, Helms asked Wirth if the Clinton administration would
support legislation outlawing sex selection abortion in the U.S.
and admitting refugees fleeing China's coercive abortion policies.
Wirth could not answer either question directly, saying there
were &quot;other implications&quot; which needed to be considered.

<h3>Parental Rights Vote Near</h3>

<p>

The recent pro-big-government &quot;Stand for Children&quot;
rally in Washington, D.C. had little in common with the growing
grass-roots parental rights movement, except for its focus on
children.  The Family Research Council's message to rally participants
was that government programs can never provide what children vitally
need -- parents raising them with love and direction.  Which is
to say, parents are irreplaceable.

<p>

With public school officials handing condoms to pre-teens,
it is no wonder that the parental rights movement has captured
the public's attention.  Parents across the country are finding
their voice against intrusive state and federal governments.
At the state level, parents are supporting constitutional amendments
which protect the right of parents to direct the upbringing and
education of their children without unwanted government infringement.
At the federal level, parents are supporting the Parental Rights
and Responsibilities Act of 1996 (PRRA), which simply codifies
Supreme Court rulings that parents have a fundamental right to
raise their children which the government must respect.

<p>

That parents, not government, should have the primary responsibility
and authority in raising their children seems beyond dispute.
Yet, the ubiquitous ACLU and their education counterpart, the
National Education Association, have weighed in with heavy protests.
They are fond of presenting hypothetical &quot;horror stories&quot;
of child abuse they claim the PRRA will permit, yet the bill specifically
excludes abusive parents from its protection.

<p>

In contrast to these theoretical concerns, real-life instances
of outrageous government violations of parents rights persist.
If the PRRA were law, parents in Pennsylvania would probably
not have had to file suit against the East Stroudsburg public
school for forcing their sixth-grade daughters to undergo vaginal
examinations without their knowledge or consent and over the tearful
protestations of the girls.  This flagrant usurpation of the right
of parents to make health care decisions for their children would
not be tolerated under the PRRA.  Without it, the Pennsylvania
parents have little certainty of success.

<p>

A vote on the PRRA is expected before August.  Call 202-225-3121
and urge your congressman and senators to vote for the PRRA (H.R.
1946; S. 984).  For information on state initiatives, contact
Of the People at 703-351-5051.

<h3>Indecent Opinion</h3>

<p>

The District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania
has ruled against provisions of the Communications Decency Act
(CDA), the first major anti-pornography legislation for cyberspace.
This is a sad defeat with ominous implications for the burgeoning,
new &quot;global community.&quot;  The Clinton Justice Department
will appeal the ruling to the Supreme Court.

<p>

The CDA was passed as part of the Telecommunications Reform
bill in February 1996.  It seeks to protect children from sexually
explicit material on the Internet by prohibiting adults from knowingly
sending or displaying &quot;indecent material&quot; to kids.
It imposes criminal penalties for violation of the law.

<p>

The ACLU and a coalition of liberal groups and on-line service
providers filed the challenge to the CDA in Philadelphia.  A similar
challenge was filed in New York and is still pending.  The Family
Research Council and the National Law Center for Children and
Families submitted 400 pages of legal argument and exhibits on
behalf of anti-pornography groups defending the CDA.  Judge Delores
Sloviter, a Carter appointee, headed the Philadelphia three-judge
panel which heard testimony this spring from ACLU and government
witnesses.

<p>

The CDA uses the time-tested standard of &quot;indecency&quot;
to draw the line between material that is appropriate for adults
but not for children.  &quot;Indecent material&quot; is defined
as material depicting or describing sexual or excretory activities
or organs which, in context, is presented in a patently offensive
manner.  The Supreme Court has ruled that adults have a First
Amendment right to receive indecent material and share it with
other adults, but no right to foist it upon children.  The indecency
standard has protected children in the broadcast television, radio,
and telephone media.

<p>

At closing arguments in Philadelphia, it was clear that the
ACLU was not simply quarreling with this particular law, but was
advocating no restrictions whatsoever on the dissemination of
computer pornography to children.  The Philadelphia court was
openly hostile to the Justice Department and its defense of the
CDA, and its ruling absurdly implies that the advancement of Internet
technology depends upon unfettered exhibition of sexual material
to children.

<p>

<font size=+3>W</font>e got a postcard from Air Force Captain Dave Panzera 
the other day.  That's not so unusual, since we receive many calls
and letters from active duty military.  But Captain Panzera's
card came to us from <I>Antarctica.</I>

<p>

That's a dramatic example of how far and wide the
message of FRC is traveling these days.  It's not at all unusual
for us to host meetings with pastors from Southern Africa, champions
of religious liberty from Russia and pro-family leaders from Canada,
Australia and New Zealand.  The international interest in Family
Research Council is a reflection of the global nature of the threat
to the family.

<p>

I always try to give encouragement to our friends from abroad.
They often report feeling &quot;overwhelmed&quot; by a tide of
pornography, drugs, abortion and sexual misconduct.  I share with
our allies some of the expanding array of communications tools
we use to get our message out.  In trying to support them, I find
that <I>I</I> am uplifted. Let me share with you, a regular reader
of <I>Washington Watch,</I> the growing array of devices we have
used in the fight for faith, family and freedom.

<p>

As Americans reduce their reliance on the liberal talking
heads of TV network news, radio has filled the gap.  Sure, there
are the Howard Sterns and Don Imuses, but well-informed pro-family
callers to radio talk shows shatter the media myths about our
movement.  My nickname for conservative programs broadcast from
our nation's capital is &quot;Radio Free Washington.&quot;  I'm
proud that Focus on the Family's news and information feature,
<I>Family News in Focus</I> (FNIF), is broadcast to hundreds of
religious stations every day.  FNIF's Washington bureau, and its
veteran chief, Carl Ramsey, are good neighbors to FRC.

<p>

My daily radio commentary, which bears the same title as
this newsletter, keeps many of you informed of late-breaking
stories and my perspective on the issues.  You can call our FRC
toll-free line at 1-800-225-4008 to obtain a listing of 
participating stations in your community.

<p>

FRC's <I>Legislative Hotline</I> is easily reached by dialing
1-202-783-HOME.  It's available 24 hours a day and is put together
each week (or more frequently as events warrant) by our top-notch
government relations staff.  You can also receive the text of
the <I>Hotline</I> via FAX.  Just call our Government Relations

FRC's staff includes some intrepid &quot;cybernauts&quot;
who are using the latest technology to make sure we are represented
on the Internet.  Our site is located at: http://www.frc.org.
I confess I'm a bit &quot;low-tech.&quot; My word processor is
located under my hat, and I carry my printer around in my shirt
pocket.  But for those of you who find that the world begins with
a keyboard, our Internet site should please you.

<p>

When David Brinkley's producers called me recently to appear
on <I>This Week,</I> I was pleased (even if I did have to lock
horns with Rep. Barney Frank).  And CBS-TV's <I>Face the Nation</I> 
gave me yet another opportunity to tout the Defense of Marriage
Act (DOMA).  As gratifying as these major media appearances are,
it's good to know that FRC isn't dependent on others to spread
our message.  We have our own means of getting the word out.
And that word is clearly reaching the ends of the earth.

<a name="budget"><center><h1>KEEPING BUDGET<br>
REFORM ON TRACK</h1></center>
<font size=+3>W</font>hite House Chief of Staff Leon Panetta and Senior Counselor
George Stephanopoulos know the drill well. They are using today
the same tactics they employed in 1990 when they successfully
maneuvered President George Bush into breaking his &quot;no new
taxes&quot; pledge. Today, they decry &quot;a train wreck&quot;
they say will occur if Congress makes spending cuts stick. 
<p>
First, some background. The U.S. Government will begin the 1996
Fiscal Year October 1.  Congress has spent the last nine months
paring down Clinton budget requests, eliminating billions in future
wasteful spending, and pushing for a balanced budget by 2002.
<p>
House Republicans earlier this year passed a FY 1996 budget resolution
that calls for a balanced budget by FY 2002.  They tried to cut
federal taxes by $354 billion over the same seven-year period,
but Senate liberals limited tax relief to  $245 billion. Clinton
and his  congressional supporters vigorously denounced both the
proposed tax cuts and the 2002 balanced budget target. 
<p>
<center><h3>Media's False Picture</h3></center>
<p>
Journalists describe the major difference between Congress and
the president as a dispute over whether to balance the budget
in a seven-year or ten-year period.  However, the Congressional
Budget Office's (CBO) analysis of Clinton's  proposed budget found
a $209 billion shortfall in the year 2005 -- the very year that
he claims to achieve a balanced budget.  His ten-year proposal
also produces <i>$2 trillion in new federal debt</i>.
<p>
Liberal critics of the GOP budget plan attack the tax cuts, claiming
that they favor the rich or that they will gouge Medicare.  They
claim the tax cuts will &quot;explode the deficit,.&quot;  But
more than half (55 percent) of the House-passed tax relief is
dedicated to the $500-per-child tax credit.  And approximately
three-quarters of this tax credit is slated to go to families
with incomes less than $75,000;  nearly five million families
at the lowest levels will be freed from federal income taxes.
Senate GOP leaders have strongly suggested that the final composition
of the tax package will be very &quot;family friendly.&quot;
<p>
Conservatives see savings in the cuts in discretionary spending
programs and welfare reform.  They also note that Medicare spending
is projected to <i>increase at twice the rate of inflation</i>
even as reforms are instituted to restrain the rate of growth.
 The argument that tax cuts &quot;explode the deficit&quot; is
answered by pointing out that <i>tax revenues</i> actually increased
by more than the rate of inflation during the 1980s.  If spending
increases had been held to the rate of inflation, we'd have a
budget surplus today. 
<p>
Not a penny can be spent unless both houses approve. This gives
the GOP tremendous leverage to set conditions on the use of taxpayers'
money. Funding battles are also battles over abortion, federal
subsidies for pornographic art, the gay agenda and liberal legal
activism. Congress has an obligation to use its &quot;power of
the purse&quot; to protect the legitimate interests of the American
family.
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>
<center><i><font size=+2>BUDGET "TRAIN WRECK"<br>
WON'T HAMPER ESSENTIAL<br>
SERVICES</font></i></center>
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>
<center><h3>A Contest of Wills</h3></center>
<p>
Who will blink first, Bill Clinton or Congress?  Both sides may get
through October by short-term "continuing resolutions," but by early November,
the Treasury's authority to borrow money will expire.
 Congress can then apply conditions to legislation to raise the debt ceiling. 
If the budget dispute is not resolved by then, a real clash will occur. But 
<i>essential services</i> like mail delivery, air traffic control and Social
Security checks will continue during this dispute. Doubtless there will
be a great hue and cry from the liberals who see their funds disappearing.
<p>
A government shutdown poses great risks for liberal interest
groups.  What happens if a few weeks go by and the public
doesn't miss the &quot;services?&quot;  That would provide a very
powerful argument for reducing spending even further. Our national
debt and much of our cultural decline have been the products of
several decades of reckless government spending. If it takes a
 liberal &quot;train wreck&quot; to get our country back on track,
that may be a small price to pay.

<h3>On the Hill</h3>
<p>
<a name="porn"><b>Calculating Moves.</b> The cyberporn debate has gone behind closed
doors during Congress' recess.  FRC has participated in several
meetings to work on a package to address this menacing aspect
of exciting new communication technology.  Later this month, Congress
will make final decisions about bill language.  Lawmakers should
stand firm in their commitment to enact strong laws against this
exploitative material, and not be swept in by the liberals' false
promise of &quot;parent-empowering&quot; software.  The software
might help, but it is no more a substitute for strong pornography
laws than bullet-proof vests are a substitute for laws against
homicide.
<p>
<b>Saving Health Care.</b> The Clinton health care plan is dead but the
issue of health care reform is still alive.  Escalating health
care costs are one of the biggest threats to the current system.
Congress is likely to consider  H.R. 1818, introduced by Reps.
William Archer (R-Texas) and Andrew Jacobs (D-Ind.), to allow
tax-free medical savings accounts in which families or individuals
set up a special account for lower-level health care expenses,
typically around $2,500.  The benefit is the account is tax free,
portable, and can carry over from year to year for future health
needs. HR 1818 has 90 cosponsors. In the Senate, Chuck Grassley
(R-Iowa) has taken the lead in pushing the medical savings account
concept.     
<p>
<center><h3>Around Town</h3></center>
<p>
<b>Quarterback Kemp.</b> The 14-member commission on taxes headed by
former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Jack Kemp, is
expected to give its report to the congresssional Republicans
 in October.  The commission examined a flat tax plan (with no
deductions), a national sales tax, and other proposals to simplify
the tax code.  Pro-family advocates will be especially interested
in how the commission handles tax treatment of families, charitable
contributions, and home ownership.
<p>
<b>New Security Order.</b> President Bill Clinton Aug. 4 signed an Executive
Order barring the federal government from denying security clearances
to homosexuals.  The 13-page order &quot;establishes a uniform
Federal personnel security program&quot; for all federal employees
to include members of the military and commercial contractors.
 It states, &quot;No inference...may be raised solely on the basis
of the sexual orientation of the employee.&quot;  Homosexuality
has long been a red flag for national security officers performing
background investigations  because it is so often linked to known
security risks, such as drug and alcohol abuse, promiscuity and
violence.
<p>
<b>Gay Asylum, Yes. Moms, No.</b> While Mrs. Clinton talked about advancing
women's rights during the Beijing conference, 13 Chinese women
were being imprisoned by the United States and awaiting deportation
back to China. Their crime?  Fleeing China's forced abortion policies.
 Even though these Chinese women will face extreme punishment
in slave labor (Lao Dai) camps or even death if they are returned
to China, Bill Clinton has refused to grant them asylum.  In a
reversal of the Reagan-Bush immigration policy, Clinton declared
that forced abortion was no longer grounds for political asylum.
He has instead extended asylum to homosexuals fleeing &quot;persecution.&quot;
<p>
<a name="polls"><b>Polls Go South.</b> Recent public opinion polling suggests 
that Americans are not altogether pleased with Congress. A <i>Wall Street 
Journal/NBC News</i> poll found that 53 percent of respondents <i>disapprove
</i>of Congress' performance and only 36 percent approve, while
a <i>New York Times/CBS News</i> poll found a 56 percent disapproval
rating and a 31 percent approval rating for Congress.  Interestingly,
however, according to a <i>Times Mirror</i> poll, the Republican
party is ahead of the Democratic party by a greater margin than
when they swept Congress last November -- 50 percent to 43 percent.
 Taken together, these results suggest that Americans are less
satisfied with the pace of change than the direction of change.

<h3>Children's Defense?</h3>
<p>
<font size=+3>W</font>hile President Bill Clinton's anti-smoking campaign grabbed
headlines, his administration went to court against a South Carolina
university hospital's very successful mandatory drug testing/treatment
program for pregnant cocaine-addicted women. Mothers who refuse
treatment for themselves and their unborn children would face
arrest and jail time. The program works. Most women stayed drug-free
during their pregnancy. Still, Clinton's aides charged that South
Carolina's program was punitive and violated the addicted mother's
&quot;privacy rights.&quot;  Is the health and well-being of unborn
children less important than those who already born?
<p>
<a name="aids">Then there is the issue of 7,000 deliveries per year in U.S.
to HIV-infected women. About 2,000 of these infants are infected
with HIV. Rep.Tom Coburn (R-Okla.), who is a medical doctor, and
Rep. Gary Ackerman (D-N.Y.) plan to offer an &quot;infant testing&quot;
amendment to the Ryan White Care Act (H.R. 1872/S. 641) that would
require states -- in order to qualify for federal Ryan White Care
funding -- to pass laws requiring every newborn be tested for the
HIV virus if mother does not (voluntarily) undergo prenatal
testing.  The amendment would require the test results to be told
to mothers, and it also encourages HIV counseling, testing and
treatment of pregnant women.
<p>
According to Dr. Coburn, his amendment is an important step in
combating AIDS.  &quot;In fact, studies have shown that the rate
of transmission of the virus from mothers to children can be reduced
by two-thirds if the drug AZT is administered during pregnancy,
labor and the first six weeks after birth,&quot; Coburn explains,
&quot;Knowing the status of the baby right away would allow treatment
and counseling to begin immediately and prevent an uninformed
mother from transmitting HIV to her baby through breast feeding.&quot;
<p>
Presently, 45 states require up to <i>nine</i> mandatory generic
newborn tests, such as syphilis and hepatitis, but not HIV. As
a public health issue, the incidence of AIDS in infants requires
that common sense become public sense.

<h3>Defending our Defenders</h3>
<p>
<font size=+3>F</font>RC has filed an <i>amicus curiae</i> (&quot;friend of 
the court&quot;) brief with the U.S. Supreme Court in the &quot;Amendment 2&quot;
case.  Media reports contend that <i>Romer v. Evans</i> will decide
whether the Constitution allows Colorado to &quot;discriminate
against&quot; homosexuals. Wrong. The case is really about
whether the people of Colorado may decide not to grant special
protected legal status to this &quot;class&quot; of persons.
 The Supreme Court justices will hear oral argument in the case
 Oct. 2.    
<p>
<a name="gay">In the military, homosexual servicemen have begun filing lawsuits
to block their discharge.  FRC is working on the following cases:
<ul>
<li>In <i>Philips v. Perry</i>, FRC filed the winning brief calling
for the dismissal of a case filed by a homosexual sailor seeking
to block his discharge.  In the case, Philips admitted past sexual
misconduct and his intention to engage in future misconduct. 
The federal district court dismissed Philip's case, and FRC is
preparing another brief arguing against his appeal.  
<p><li>A federal district court June 9 upheld the military's policy
on homosexuality in <i>Thomasson v. Perry</i>.  The ruling was
based upon the pre-1993 exclusion policy, not on the Department
of Defense's  (DoD) new &quot;don't ask, don't tell&quot; regulations.
 This is significant.  The Clinton administration has argued that
its 1993 change in policy was necessary to avoid constitutional
problems, but the Thomasson ruling shows that the &quot;old
rules&quot; were constitutionally sound.  Thomasson has appealed
this ruling to the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, and FRC has
filed a brief supporting the constitutionality of the old policy.
</ul><p>
The <i>new</i> DoD regulations were the subject of a challenge
in the case of <i>Able v. U.S..</I> The federal district court
judge in Able ruled that six service members' First and
Fifth Amendment rights were violated when the military sought
to discharge them solely based on their open admission they were
homosexuals, and ruled that the Pentagon was enjoined from discharging
them.  Attorney General Janet Reno has appealed the ruling, but,
given the Justice Department's  lackluster performance so far,
FRC does not anticipate a vigorous effort at the appeals court
level.  FRC has filed an <i>amicus</i> brief setting forth all
of the key arguments for prohibiting service by avowed homosexuals
which the Clinton administration has ignored. FRC's efforts have
been undertaken by the Military Readiness Project, a joint task
force of FRC and senior retired military leaders.

by Gary L. Bauer</center>
<p>
School's back. The bumper stickers on buses remind us to be careful
of the youngsters. Time was when accidents going to and from school
were the main worry of parents. No more. Today, we have concerns
about violence and drugs in schools. Many parents are troubled
by efforts in school to undermine the values and beliefs the kids
are taught at home. And, of course, there's OBE. Outcome-based
Education is the latest in a long line of educational fads that
have dumbed down American classrooms. 
<p>
<center><h3>&quot;Re-structuring&quot; SATs</h3></center>
<p>
Now, it seems, even the SATs have been affected. The Scholastic
Aptitude Tests have been  an important measure of how well our
young people are doing.  I remember during my service as President
Reagan's Undersecretary of Education how we pointed to the 85-point 
skid in SAT scores (1960-80) as indisputable proof of educational
decline. We even prodded a sluggish education establishment to
cough  up the extensive data we published as &quot;the Wall Chart.&quot;
That chart demonstrated that many of the states which spent the
least per pupil nonetheless produced students with the highest
scholastic aptitude. Was I unpopular with the bureaucrats!
<p>
Despite a 93 percent spending hike in the 1980s, the education
establishment continued to crank out under-prepared graduates.
So the SATs have been subjected to steady criticism from liberals.
Finally, the College Board has responded. With great fanfare,
education leaders announced that this year's scores were -- UP!
That <I>would</I> be great news except for some inconvenient truths.
First, this is a new and improved SAT test. They call it SAT I,
but its real name should be <i>SAT-lite.</i> It has fewer
questions, but it allows students 30 minutes more to finish. The
designers of SAT-lite have thrown overboard the more challenging
antonyms section, making it easier to score high on the the verbal
portion of the exam. Oh, and it's now OK to use a calculator.
No more unfair advantages to those grinds who memorized their
times tables! 
<p>
Test-makers say  they have changed the SATs in order to keep
up &quot;with what and how students are learning today.&quot;
What and how students learn today is increasingly determined by
President Bill Clinton and Education Secretary Dick Riley under
their ill-conceived &quot;Goals 2000&quot; legislation. Of course,
the College Board disclaims any attempt to dumb down the SATs.
But they are funded by the U.S. Department of Education. We could
hardly expect them to bite the hand that feeds them. With these
new SAT-lite test results, the Clinton administration will be
able to reassure concerned parents: &quot;See, our reforms are
working!&quot;  But this is the same team that called the State
of Ohio on the carpet last year for requiring high school graduates
to pass an eighth grade-level test. The Clinton administration
said those tests might be racially discriminatory.

COKE: YANK IT!</font></i></center>
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>
<center><h3>Excellence the Goal</h3></center>
<p>
Make no mistake: pro-family Americans don't want kids
to fail in school. We believe that a stress on solid academic
basics, giving special needs children the extra help they may
require, is the best way to progress. We believe in competition
and a commitment to excellence. We know that parents are the key
to real education progress. And we think parents should be able
to choose the safe and challenging school that meets their childrens'
needs. We don't believe it helps anyone artificially to try to
build up a child's self-esteem by lowering the standards. Minority
children, as well as special needs kids and rural kids, can achieve.
The pursuit of excellence helps everyone.

<center><h1>THE LEAST OF THESE</h1></center>

<p>

<font size=+3>D</font>oes increased social spending equate with better 
childhoods? For lack of a better answer, both Republicans and Democrats 
have been inclined to say &quot;yes.&quot;  Social spending by the
federal government for children and families has increased dramatically
since 1960, far exceeding the rate of inflation.  Yet, almost
all indicators suggest that child well-being today lags behind
what it was three decades ago.

<p>

Social spending advocates expect government to substitute
for mothers and fathers.  But noted child psychologist Urie Bronfenbrenner
has written that what a child needs more than government programs
is the &quot;irrational emotional attachment&quot; of fiercely
loving parents.

<p>

It's time to acknowledge that government can't buy love for
children any more than money can buy happiness for adults.  What
children really need are a mom and a dad.

<p>

<center><h3>Parents, Not Programs</h3></center>

<p>

Rather than winking at government's encroachment on families,
Congress should move quickly to pass pending parental rights legislation
(S. 984; H.R. 1946).  The legislation would neither create new
rights for parents nor repeal child abuse laws that protect children.
The new law would simply protect parents' rights to decide what
is best for their children without excessive interference from
Washington.

<p>

Having affirmed the central importance of parents, government
does sometimes have a role to play in helping parents.  One good
example is &quot;Megan's Law,&quot; which Congress has just passed
and the President has signed.  The new law requires states to
notify local law officials when convicted sex offenders are released
from prison and requires the police to notify the public when
a dangerous sex offender moves into the neighborhood.

<p>

<center><h3>Yes to Adoption</h3></center>

<p>

The community, of course, must step in to provide for children
who have no parents of their own.  But the importance of parents
remains the same -- or is even greater -- for children who are
alone.  The best government can do is to speed these children
into loving homes where loving parents are waiting.

<p>

&quot;The Adoption Promotion and Stability Act of 1996&quot;
(H.R. 3286), passed by the House but not yet by the Senate, offers
hope for vulnerable children currently free to be adopted.  In
the United States alone, there are over 50,000 foster children
awaiting adoption.  Over 20,000 children have been waiting for
a family for years.  The new legislation includes a $5,000 
non-refundable tax credit for qualified adoption expenses (for both 
domestic and international adoptions).  In order to eliminate unnecessary 
waiting periods for minority children in foster care, the legislation
also prohibits the use of racial considerations if they cause
a delay or denial of an adoption placement.

<p>

New adoption incentives will help some children; but Conna
Craig, President of the Institute for Children, argues that only
an overhaul of the foster care system will save children like
John.  A skinny kid who loves baseball, John has been waiting
for a home for nearly all of his 10 years.  Legally free to be
adopted since he was three, John's childhood is fast slipping
away.  He needs policymakers to understand that every child needs
a mom and a dad.

<p>

<center><h3>It Takes a Pro-Family Village</h3></center>

<p>

Even strong two-parent families require strong communities
to help pattern for children right habits of the heart.  When
so many children are languishing without families of their own,
community becomes all the more important.

<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>

<center><i><font size=+2>
STAND FOR CHILDREN?<br>
STAND FOR FAMILIES.
</font></i></center>

<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>

&quot;The American Community Renewal Act of 1996,&quot; spearheaded
by Republican Congressmen James Talent (Mo.) and J. C. Watts (Okla.),
will strengthen communities more than any government handout
ever could by offering tax incentives for charitable giving, public
housing reform, and an end to government regulations that stifle
economic development in depressed neighborhoods.  By rebuilding
communities, we will strengthen the hands of parents -- and restore
some of childhood's lost innocence.

<p>

It's fair to admit that it takes a village.  Just as long
as we really mean a local &quot;village&quot; that preserves parent
autonomy, instead of a federal fiefdom that chains both children
and families to an all-powerful state.  Standing for children means
standing for families first.

<h3>On the Hill</h3>

<p>

<b>Senate Shake-Up.</b> Robert Dole leaves the Senate on June
11, freeing him of the need to navigate the Senate's procedural
obstacles.  Dole's departure has also set off a chain reaction
of races for top leadership posts in the Senate.  Majority Whip
Trent Lott and Republican Conference Chairman Thad Cochran are
vying to succeed Dole, with most insiders predicting a Lott victory.
GOP Policy Committee Chairman Don Nickles is running unopposed
to succeed Lott in the number two position of Whip.  Both have
advocated limited government, traditional family values, and the
sanctity of life.

<p>

<b>Suicide with Dignity?</b> The House Judiciary Subcommittee
on the Constitution recently held a hearing on assisted suicide.
The hearing followed two new federal circuit court decisions
legalizing &quot;physician-assisted suicide.&quot;  Witnesses
discussed the legal and moral ramifications of the rulings.  The
Ninth Circuit based many of its arguments on the <I>Roe</I> (1973
abortion decision) interpretation of &quot;privacy,&quot; overturning
a law approved by Washington State voters to ban assisted suicide.
The Second Circuit overturned a similar New York law. Several
members of Congress are writing legislation to reverse or restrict
these flawed decisions.

<p>

<b>Aiding Babies.</b> Congress has passed a measure under the
Ryan White Care Act to reduce the transmission of AIDS from pregnant
women to their babies.  The provision promotes voluntary counseling,
testing and treatment for pregnant women and the testing of newborns
for HIV.  Testing of newborns for HIV will be required if states
have not reduced the number of infected infants by 2000.  This
issue had been in deadlock for months because of opposition by
certain homosexual and feminist groups.  They argued that it could
lead to expanded mandatory AIDS testing and infringe on a woman's
&quot;right to privacy.&quot;

<p>

<b>PX Porn.</b> The House of Representatives' 1997 Defense Authorization
Act bans future military sales of pornography.  Last year the
Pentagon sold 12.6 million copies of 219 different pornographic
magazines, earning $4.3 million.  Military customers pay less
than the market price and pay no tax.  Government vending of pornography
sends the message that profiting from material that demeans women
is okay.  But common sense and science show that readily available
porn encourages, rather than discourages, episodes like Tailhook.
Senate action is next.

<p>

<b>Gambling Loses.</b> Pro-family forces, overcoming a well-financed
gambling industry campaign, secured Senate committee passage
of legislation to create a Gambling Impact and Policy Commission
(S. 704) on May 14.  The House passed similar legislation (H.R.
497) on March 5.  The unanimous Senate vote eases the way for
final congressional approval.  The Gambling Commission, which
has been granted subpoena power, will evaluate the industry's
impact on families, businesses and society.  The Commission will
submit recommendations for Congress and the states and will provide
insight into the consequences of legalized gambling.

<p>

<center><h3>Around Town</h3></center>

<p>

<b>Bioethical Lapse.</b> President Clinton will soon appoint
15 members to his National Bioethics Advisory Commission.  The
commission's role is to &quot;identify broad principles to govern
the ethical conduct of research.&quot;  A White House office released
a revealing list of potential nominees.  Among the extreme views:
a Harvard Medical School professor who advocates legal changes
in the definition of death so that organs can be harvested for
transplantation before brain death occurs, and a Yale lawyer who
argues that parents who withhold birth control from their adolescent
children commit child neglect.

<p>

<b>Racial Reconciliation.</b> Family Research Council recently
hosted a meeting of African-American leaders in Washington, D.C.,
to discuss projects for racial reconciliation.  Among the goals
of the meeting was to reaffirm FRC's desire to address the specific
needs and concerns of all families, regardless of race or culture.
Participants explored how FRC and other family organizations
can more effectively fulfill the pro-family mission and help to
heal ethnic divisions in modern America.

<p>

<center><h3>Across the Nation</h3></center>

<p>

<b>Sleet, Snow, and Frosty U.S. Attorneys.</b> On May 9, the
U.S. Postal Inspection Service successfully busted a nationwide
child pornography ring, despite the refusal by U.S. Attorney Janet
Napolitano and others to cooperate.  Napolitano, a Clinton appointee,
reportedly refused to authorize a search warrant for the operation
because she felt it improperly targeted homosexual men.  However,
inspectors were able to obtain the search warrant from local authorities.
Senators Bob Dole (R-Kan.) and Charles Grassley (R-Iowa) have asked
Attorney General Janet Reno to investigate Napolitano to determine
whether she wrongly impeded the sting.

<p>

<b>Pro-life Planks.</b> Twelve Catholic and Protestant pro-life
leaders (including Gary Bauer) have signed a public pledge supporting
the current Republican platform language on legal protection for
unborn children.  While most media stories have focused on 
&quot;inside-the-beltway&quot; Republican skirmishes over this language, 
many pro-life Democrats are disturbed about their party's entrenched position 
favoring abortion on demand. Some 40 pro-life House Democrats are urging
party leaders to rewrite the 1996 platform to support at least
some protection of prenatal life.

<h3>FRC: Friend of the Family</h3>

<p>

The battle for pro-family policy is increasingly being fought,
not only in the halls of Congress, but in the courts.  In many
cases, groups opposing pro-family policies take advantage of liberal
courts, avoiding public and congressional debate of controversial
issues.  FRC has filed amicus curiae (&quot;friend of the court&quot;)
briefs in many cases, several of which are highlighted and described
below.

<p>

FRC has been active in defending anti-pornography laws in
cases like <I>ACLU v. Reno</I>.  In this case, FRC acted
as co-counsel defending the Communications Decency Act.  Our brief
defends the constitutionality of the Act, which is designed to
prohibit the knowing distribution of pornography to children.
No matter the outcome, all parties anticipate that the case will
ultimately go to the Supreme Court.

<p>

FRC has also been vocal in pro-life cases around the country.
Most recently, FRC filed an amicus brief in <I>Shenck v. Pro-Choice
Network</I>, a case to be heard in the Supreme Court in October
debating the constitutionality of court-ordered, 15-foot &quot;floating
bubble zones&quot; around patients entering and exiting abortion
clinics.  These &quot;zones&quot; are specifically intended to
prevent peaceful demonstrators from talking to anyone going in
or out of an abortion clinic.

<p>

In <I>United States of America v. Commonwealth of Virginia</I>,
FRC has co-sponsored a brief defending the right of the Virginia
Military Institute to admit males only and to continue receiving
government funds.  This case holds implications for all publicly
supported single-sex schools, whether military or not, across
the country.

<p>

<I>Romer v. Evans</I> (the &quot;Amendment 2&quot; case)
was decided on May 20.  FRC filed an amicus curiae brief asserting
that the Supreme Court of Colorado wrongly negated the people's
right to pass laws that deny special rights to homosexuals.  The
6-3 Supreme Court decision means that pro-family voters are effectively
precluded from winning on this issue at the state level, at least
insofar as a measure binds lower political jurisdictions.

<p>

Melinda Paras, spokeswoman for the National Gay and Lesbian
Task Force, commented that the decision drives a &quot;stake through
the heart&quot; of ballot measures sponsored by pro-family groups.
FRC is examining options for a legislative response to <I>Romer,</I>
and the House Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution has
promised to hold hearings.

<h3>Free Needles for Junkies?</h3>

<p>

A major media push is under way, using government reports,
to prove that giving clean needles to drug addicts slows the 
spread of the AIDS virus without encouraging illegal drug use. 
But the evidence is inconclusive and should not be used to 
start dangerous needle give-away programs.

<p>

Two of the three medical doctors on the leading and much-cited
government needle study say that needle exchange programs (NEPs)
&quot;are not the panacea their supporters hope for.&quot; They
favor more drug treatment rather than exchanges.

<p>

A 1993 law permits the government to use federal funds to
support exchanges if they can be scientifically shown to slow
the AIDS virus without increasing drug abuse.  So far, however,
needle studies are problem-plagued.  They rely on self-reporting
by addicts, downplay sexual transmission of the AIDS virus, generally
ignore the impact on communities near exchange sites, trivialize
the drug problem and never measure HIV seroconversion rates, the
only true indication of effectiveness.

<p>

Philip Lee, assistant Secretary of Health and Human Services
and a former needle researcher, has expressed concern that NEPs
&quot;may send a mixed message about drug use.&quot;  There are
75 NEPs now operating in 55 U.S. cities without federal funds.
These programs provide free drug-injecting supplies, condoms,
advice on shooting drugs properly, warnings about bad heroin,
and counseling that sometimes leads to treatment.

<p>

Lee Brown, President Clinton's first drug czar, said he &quot;can
find no compelling reason&quot; to fund NEPs.  Barry McCaffrey,
the nation's new czar, has said, &quot;The problem is not dirty
needles; the problem is heroin addiction.&quot;

<p>

&quot;Our goal should be to eliminate drug abuse,&quot; says
Rep. Charles Rangel (D-N.Y.), &quot;not to find a cleaner, safer
way to do it.&quot;  Dr. James Curtis, director of the Department
of Psychiatry, Harlem Hospital Center, says exchanges are &quot;poor
medicine&quot; and &quot;promote a breakdown in law and order.&quot;

<p>

Although the science is inconclusive, expect AIDS activists
and pro-drug legalization forces to pressure the federal government
to approve funds for NEPs.

<font size=+2><b><i>Renewing Our Vows</i></b></font><br>
by Gary L. Bauer
</center>

<p>

<font size=+3>I</font>n announcing his support for the just-introduced 
federal Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), Sen. Dan Coats of Indiana had
this to say:

<p>

&quot;The definition of marriage is not created by politicians
and judges, and it cannot be changed by them.  It is rooted in
our history, our laws, our deepest  moral and religious convictions,
and our nature as human beings.  It is the union of one man and
one woman.  This fact can be respected or it can be resented.
But it can't be altered.&quot;

<p>

If someone had told me five years ago that we would find
ourselves in 1996 defending marriage as the union of one man and
one woman, I would have asked him if he wanted me to take him
to my leader -- jokingly, of course.

<p>

Yet this idea of opening marriage to homosexual couples,
which seems more suited to another planet, is stalking the land.
Prompted by an impending court decision in Hawaii, legislators
in more than 30 states are rushing to protect their marriage statutes.
As of this writing, 11 states had enacted marriage protection
laws. 

<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>

<center><i><font size=+2>
ELEVEN STATES HAVE ACTED TO<br>
PROTECT MARRIAGE.
</font></i></center>

<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>

At the federal level, the Defense of Marriage Act was introduced
in the House on May 7 by Reps. Steve Largent (R-Okla.) and Bob
Barr (R-Ga.) and in the Senate on May 8 by Don Nickles (R-Okla.).
It is being endorsed by a slowly growing list of Congressional
sponsors, but many more are needed -- and swiftly, as the Supreme
Court decision in <I>Romer v. Evans</I> illustrates (<I>See</I> 
&quot;Courtwatch,&quot; page 3).

<p>

This is the most important pro-family legislation in many
years.  If marriage falls, it will begin a domino effect that
will totally redefine families within the law and culture.  For
starters, children will be taught in school that homosexuality
is the moral equivalent of marital love, businesses will be forced
to subsidize homosexual relationships, and churches that uphold
biblical morality will find themselves outside the civil law.

<p>

On Mother's Day, I debated Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.) on
<I>This Week With David Brinkley.</I>  I reminded Mr. Frank that
it was fitting that we were discussing this on Mother's Day, since
our celebration of motherhood is one of the most powerful expressions
of just why the idea of homosexual &quot;marriage&quot; is so
dopey.  But it is more than dopey; it is dangerous.

<p>

If unelected judges in Hawaii are able to impose their will
on the rest of the nation through the Constitution's Full Faith
and Credit Clause (which compels the states to recognize each
other's licenses and records), then what's safe?  If two men can
marry, why can't three men?  Or two men and a woman?  Or a man
and a boy?

<p>

During our debate, Frank made the usual unfounded charge
that his opponents are motivated by &quot;hatred&quot; and 
&quot;prejudice.&quot; He repeated what has become homosexual activists' 
key argument against DOMA:  it is unnecessary.  Homosexual 
&quot;marriage&quot; is still illegal all over the U.S.  In other words, 
Barney Frank and friends want us to wait for a judicial defeat before we 
take the field in defense of marriage.  I'm sorry, but that's not good
enough. Marriage is the God-given foundation of society, and if
we let it be ruined, our children will rightly hold us responsible.

<p>

During the Battle of Britain, when things looked darkest,
Winston Churchill told the English people to &quot;never give
up.  Never, never, never, never give up.&quot;  Well, friends,
not only won't we give up defending marriage, we cannot give up.
I urge you to call or write your senators and congressman now
and press them to sponsor DOMA. Next Mother's Day, I don't
want to be debating a triumphant Barney Frank and his newly married
&quot;spouse.&quot;

<p><hr width=50%><p>

On May 19, the Family Research Council placed a full-page ad in 
<i>The Washington Post</i> with the tag line, "Let's Save Marriage, 
Before the Whole Cake Crumbles." The ad summarized the arguments for 
preserving the institution of marriage as a legally binding 
relationship between one man and one woman. <b>For a copy of the ad,

<center><h1>A NATION MOURNS</h1></center>

<p>

<font size=+3>O</font>n April 10, President Bill Clinton vetoed the 
Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act (PBA).  With a stroke of his pen, Clinton 
continued to authorize abortion on demand, leaving to the abortionist 
the gruesome method of his choice.

<p>

And gruesome it is. In a partial-birth abortion, a child between
five and nine months of gestation is delivered -- all but the head --
and living brain tissue is vacuumed out after the child is stabbed
at the base of the skull with surgical scissors.  A top physician
testified before Congress that babies subjected to this process
most certainly feel pain.  Strangely, if a &quot;mistake&quot;
were made and the child slipped out of the mother, he would be
legally human and fully protected from being killed.

<p>

<center><h3>Broad Support</h3></center>

<p>

The brutality of this technique seemed capable of delivering a
first -- the first federal restriction of abortion since the 1973
<I>Roe v. Wade</I> Supreme Court decision.  In fact, Rep. Patricia
Schroeder (D-Colo.) fought to keep pictorials of the procedure
off the House floor, but the pro-life side carried the day, winning
the votes of House and Senate members who had never cast a pro-life
vote in their careers.  Winning margins in the House were 288-139
and 286-129, and in the Senate, 54-44.

<p>

When the bill went to the White House on Good Friday, it included
an exception allowing the procedure if necessary to save a mother
whose life &quot;is endangered by a physical disorder, illness
or injury.&quot;  The bill also received important symbolic support.
Many national leaders called for the President to approve it,
including liberal columnists and prominent clergy.  Several Catholic
bishops, including two cardinals, endured a soaking rain on April
1 to pray outside the White House.

<p>

When Bill Clinton vetoed the bill, beside him stood five women
who had experienced troubled pregnancies.  The setting was designed
to suggest that PBA had been the only answer to their trauma.

<p>

But it was not even clear that the women beside him had undergone
PBA, according to transcripts of the President's remarks and
media accounts.  The President said, &quot;The emotional power
of the description of the procedure -- which I might add did not
cover the procedure these women had ... was so great ...&quot;
He also cited the bill's omission of an exception for the &quot;health&quot;
of the mother -- a term defined so broadly by the courts that, PBA
supporters say, it means unrestricted abortion.

<p>

<center><h3>Feeling Pain</h3></center>

<p>

Many myths have been reported as fact in the PBA debate.  Among
the cruelest is that anesthesia kills the baby before the procedure
is carried out, a falsehood that, dangerously, only scares many
pregnant mothers needing legitimate surgery.

<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>
<center><i><font size=+2>
MANY MYTHS HAVE BEEN<br>
REPORTED AS FACT.
</font></i></center>
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>

The decision on whether to attempt an override of the President's
veto rests first with the House leadership.  Since PBA began in
the House, the vetoed bill has been returned there.  If two-thirds
of the House votes to override the veto (a margin previously achieved),
then it would go to the Senate. The initial vote in the Senate
was short of the two-thirds margin needed for adoption.

<p>

The veto comes at a time when recent polls show that more than
two-thirds of Americans support either restrictions on abortion
or an end to PBA altogether.

<p>

&quot;I am among the majority of Americans who know that our nation
has more to offer than abortion,&quot; Family Research Council
President Gary L. Bauer said.  &quot;This is a time for us to
pray for the return of a respect for life, born out of our Judeo-Christian
heritage and honored by our nation's founders.  Our future depends
on it.&quot;

<p>

<center><h3>What You Can Do</h3></center>

<p>

Write your member of Congress and two senators and urge them to
continue to press for enactment of the PBA.  Write or call FRC
(1-800-225-4008) and obtain a copy of our free packet (PK033) 
describing the truth about PBA's and the need
for federal legislation.  Thomas Jefferson once said that he trembled
for his country when he reflected that God is just.  A nation
that will not protect children (and mothers) at the very threshold
of birth has reason to tremble -- and to mourn.

<h3>On the Hill</h3>

<p>

<b>Omnibus Riders.</b> A new omnibus spending bill (H.R. 3019)
may include several pro-family provisions.  The Coats amendment,
which passed the Senate 63-37, would protect medical schools from
losing federal funds if they ignore an abortion mandate issued
by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education. 
The mandate requires medical students specializing in obstetrics
to be trained in performing elective abortions.  House and Senate
conferees on the bill are also expected to maintain restrictions
on District of Columbia abortion funding and on international
population assistance to groups that perform elective abortions.

<p>

<b>Health Savings.</b> The House recently passed a health reform
bill (H.R. 3103) by a vote of 267-151.  FRC supported the bill,
which includes 100 percent tax-free medical savings accounts for
families and individuals.  MSA's allow working families to choose
their own doctors and make their own health care spending decisions.
An amendment by Sen. Robert Dole to include MSA's in the Senate
bill, cosponsored by Nancy Kassebaum (R-Kan.) and Ted Kennedy
(D-Mass.), was defeated, 52-46, under a veto threat from President
Clinton if MSA's were adopted.

<p>

<b>Et Tu, Newt?</b> House Speaker Newt Gingrich gave a speech
on March 24 endorsing a candlelight AIDS march that benefits pro-homosexual
organizations. Among them are the Whitman-Walker Clinic, which
treats AIDS victims but also runs homosexual activist workshops,
promotes lesbian parenting, and places &quot;safe sex&quot; ads
in a Washington homosexual newspaper that promotes strip clubs
and bathhouses.  The newspaper noted that Gingrich credited Rep.
Steve Gunderson (R-Wis.) for asking him to publicize the march.
Gingrich also credited Gunderson's homosexual partner.

<p><a name="fda">

<b>Rubber Stamp.</b> After experimenting on 2,100 pregnant American
women, the Population Council recently filed a petition with
the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to request approval for
the abortion drug, RU 486. FDA Commissioner David Kessler had
earlier suggested that the FDA would put RU-486 on a fast-track
review process, perhaps approving the drug within six months.
FRC condemns any action by the FDA that would legitimize, for
the first time ever, a drug that would have no other use except
to kill innocent human life.

<p>

<b>Fostering Failure.</b> Dr. Henry Foster, head of a new Presidential
teen pregnancy task force, appeared with several pro-teen contraceptive
advocates at an April 10 Capitol Hill briefing.  The panelists
criticized abstinence-only programs, despite their proven effectiveness
in reducing teenage sexual activity and sexually transmitted diseases.
The panelists stressed instead more vigorous sex education programs,
increased use of contraception, and self-esteem programs. A hand-out
they distributed claimed that &quot;abstinence until marriage&quot;
programs and programs to produce &quot;secondary virginity&quot;
have not been shown to work.

<p>

<b>MIT Saber-Rattling.</b> On March 20, a Massachusetts Institute
of Technology faculty task force announced that it wants to open
the college's Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) program to
avowed homosexuals.  The task force encourages universities nationwide
to rethink their relationship with the ROTC and their adherence
to its homosexual policy. MIT risks losing $56 million, 16 percent
of its annual research budget, because of a 1996 law that denies
Pentagon dollars to any institution that has an anti-ROTC policy.
Last year, ROTC commissioned 7,200 officers, barely reaching
the Pentagon's goal.

<p>

<center><h3>Across the Nation</h3></center>

<p><a name="marriage">

<b>States of Matrimony.</b> Kansas has become the fifth state
to enact a law protecting marriage, joining Hawaii, Utah, South
Dakota and Georgia.  Other states are also acting against an expected
Hawaiian court ruling that may legalize homosexual &quot;marriage&quot;
licenses, which could then be imposed on other states under the
Full Faith and Credit Clause of the U.S. Constitution.  In Hawaii,
the Senate also voted 24-0 specifically to ban same-sex 
&quot;marriage.&quot; The vote boosts the state's case in the suit 
brought by three homosexual couples that triggered the controversy.

<p>

<b>Ornery.</b> The Republican and Democratic political establishments
were both thwarted by insurgent candidacies in the April 9 Texas
primary runoff.  Former Congressman Ron Paul beat incumbent Republican
Greg Laughlin, a recent party-switcher.  House Speaker Newt Gingrich
was among those who campaigned vigorously for Laughlin. Both
candidates had vied for the support of pro-family activists.  In
the Democratic race for U.S. Senate, school teacher Victor Morales
defeated veteran Congressman John Bryant despite Bryant's support
from former Gov. Ann Richards and labor unions, including the
Texas Federation of Teachers.

<p>

<b>Revisionists Revise.</b> Revisionist historians missed the
U.S. landing on the moon and the presidency of George Washington
in their first, politically correct attempt back in 1994 to devise
national history standards. Now the latest revision, just released,
re-defines the family as &quot;a group of people from whom we receive
love and support.&quot;  The standards also endorse President
Clinton's embattled Goals 2000 plan and, for good measure, put
in a plug for equalized school funding nationwide.  Some conservative
critics were assuaged, but the standards remain a biased political
document.

<h3>Implementing Beijing</h3>

<p>

Despite the fact that most women in the world marry and have
children at some point in their lives, the family remained a non-issue
at the 40th session of the United Nations Commission on the Status
of Women (CSW) which met in New York in mid-March.  The CSW is
planning the implementation of the Platform for Action of last
autumn's Beijing Women's Conference.

<p>

There was no statement at the session that the family had
value, no effort to protect or shore it up now that it is under
siege, not even an invocation of the UN's usual definition of
the family as &quot;the basic unit of society.&quot; 

<p>

Most of the meeting revolved about the issues of &quot;women
and poverty&quot; and &quot;women and child and dependent care.&quot;
Noting that women constitute the majority of the world's poor,
the Commission urged governments to undertake education and training
programs and to adopt legislation promoting women's rights to
inheritance, land ownership and political decision-making.  The
&quot;dependent care&quot; debate urged redistribution of responsibilities
in the home and more part-time work, child care services and elder
care.

<p>

The session ended with the adoption of strong resolutions
condemning traffic in women and girls (a growing problem especially
in some developing countries) and wartime violence against civilians.
The Commission also approved the UN's System-Wide Plan of Action
(known as SWIMTEP) for implementing the Beijing Platform, including
its controversial provisions for health and &quot;reproductive
rights,&quot; which many UN advocacy groups hold to include abortion
and contraceptive programs for girls.

<p>

Among the tasks which SWIMTEP assigned regarding reproductive
rights were: a directive for the World Health Organization (WHO),
UNICEF and UNESCO to report on promotion of these rights to the
UN Population Division; a directive to the WHO 
and the UN Fund for Population to provide governments with technical
guidelines on methods of family planning and community distribution
of contraceptives; and a directive to UN agencies to provide special
programs for youth regarding sexual behavior.  (These directives
make no mention of parental rights or the influence of religious
or ethical traditions.)

<h3>FRC's Day in Court</h3>

<p>

On April 5, FRC received good news from a federal appeals
court in a pace-setting military homosexual case, <I>Thomasson
v. Perry</I>.  In this case, a homosexual sailor challenged both
the law passed by Congress and the Clinton administration regulations
on homosexuality in the armed forces.

<p>

The full court of 13 judges heard oral argument in December,
including argument presented by FRC's Military Readiness Project.
The MRP had filed two briefs in this case, both of which thoroughly
exposed the administration's failure to implement the law.

<p>

The law Congress passed is very clear:  no homosexuals in
the military.  But this binding expression of the will of the
American people has not stopped the administration from creating
regulatory loopholes through which homosexuals not only could
serve, but could serve openly in the military.

<p>

In <I>Thomasson,</I> the majority federal judges said, &quot;no
way.&quot; They cited FRC by name as they ruled that the Clinton
regulations on homosexuals are invalid.  The judges declared that
the administration deliberately mischaracterized the law and deliberately
shaded its answers to Congress when concerned members tried to
pin down exactly how the White House was implementing the new
statute.

<p>

Meanwhile,  the MRP was in court April 8 to hear <I>Richenberg
v. Perry</I>, a federal appeals case involving a homosexual Air
Force officer.   Predictably, the government mischaracterized
the law, but for the first time a government lawyer spoke of the
increased risk of AIDS posed by homosexuals serving.

<p>

Government counsel quoted a gay activist, &quot;I didn't
fight all my life to remain celibate&quot; and used an illustration.
If an airman identifies himself as an F16 pilot, can't the military
reasonably infer that he flies?  The counsel said the military
excludes homosexuals for a similar reason.  After all, soldiers
who identify themselves as homosexuals will engage in illicit
behavior. The court in <I>Thomasson</I> found this logic compelling.

<font size=+2><b><i>The &quot;Big Blue&quot; Summit</i></b></font><br>
by Gary L. Bauer
</center>

<p>

<font size=+3>&quot;A</font>t the end of today, give me your badge, your 
desk key and everything that belongs to IBM,&quot; Charlene Mitchell
remembers her manager saying to her.  &quot;Go home and don't
come back.&quot;  Mrs. Mitchell told <I>The Washington Post</I>
how she was &quot;surplused&quot; in 1993 by the computer giant,
known for decades as &quot;Big Blue.&quot;  It was a bitter pill
for Mrs. Mitchell to swallow.  She was the third generation in
her family to work for IBM.

<p>

Charlene Mitchell was just one of 12,500 layoffs by IBM in
the Washington area since 1987.  Nationally, more than 3.2 million
Americans have gotten pink slips from large multinational corporations
over a recent six-year period.  Many layoffs are inevitable, of
course, but controversial firing practices have become &quot;business
as usual&quot; under the leadership of a new crop of corporate
high-rollers.

<p>

IBM's chief, Lou Gerstner, Jr, bluntly told the nation's
governors in 1995 that they should &quot;confront and expel&quot;
anyone they saw as a barrier to achievement of the national education
goals. He invited them to a summit last month at IBM's New York
conference center:  &quot;We'll pull it all together,&quot; he
said.  Pull it he did.  Gerstner ruled discussion of parental
choice out of order, even though he conceded that the &quot;public
education system is broken.&quot;

<p>

Gerstner clashed with Gov. George Allen (R-Va.) behind closed
doors when the conservative opposed national curricula and national
tests.  How could Gerstner force the governors to accept his edicts?
He pointedly reminded them and the press that IBM is already
the largest employer in North Carolina and Vermont.  He enlisted
other corporate bigs into making the same threat: reform our
way or face a hiring boycott of your states.

<p>

It's ironic to be battling over education standards now.
Pro-family conservatives were among the first recruits for the
education reform movement of the 1980's.  We cheered when my boss,
Bill Bennett, called for &quot;Content, Character and Choice.&quot;
We battled the &quot;dumbing down&quot; of American education.
We wanted teachers who can teach and school curricula that emphasize
the basics:  reading, writing, math, history and reliable standards
of right and wrong.  Instead, we've seen the education reform
movement hijacked by people who have given such &quot;triumphs&quot;
as vague, behavioral Outcome-Based Education (OBE) and anti-American
history standards.

<p>

Nobody has greater concern for the future economic success
of America's young graduates than their own parents.  But it's
a mistake to look at education as just a matter of work force
preparation. Education is primarily about family, faith
and freedom.  It must pass on the heritage of Western Civilization.
When we concentrate on basics, when we respect parents' rights
and the authority of locally elected school boards, excellence
will follow.

<p>

One corporate executive at the IBM summit admitted as much.
He described his state of New Hampshire. They still have New
England town meetings to discuss school issues, he said, and parents
are actively engaged in their children's education.  The result:
top scores for New Hampshire kids on national tests, even though
the state spends very little per pupil.

<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>
<center>
<i><font size=+2>&quot;I LIKE THE NEW HAMPSHIRE<br>
MODEL.&quot;</font></i>
</center>
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>

I like the New Hampshire model, not the German model that
is increasingly put forward by Marc Tucker, a liberal education
theorist and close associate of Hillary and Bill Clinton.  In
the same issue of <I>Newsweek</I> (April 8) where Jonathan Alter
touted the German model for education and job training, the magazine's
&quot;Business&quot; section reported a German unemployment rate
twice ours. Mercedes-Benz is building factories outside Germany
for the first time in its history.  There is serious division
in German society -- East-West splits, anti-immigrant violence,
and skinhead, directionless youth.

<p>

We can have excellent schools if we respect parental rights,
institute parental choice and uphold our free institutions.  We
should not try to make our kids over in anyone else's image: 
Let Americans be Americans!

<center><h1>CONGRESS ADVANCES PRO-FAMILY AGENDA</h1></center>

<p>

<font size=+3>F</font>rom defending marriage to fighting to prevent the 
killing of the unborn late in pregnancy to presenting an unprecedented
balanced budget with family tax relief, the 104th Congress took
historic steps for America's families, according to Family Research
Council President Gary Bauer.

<p>

<center><h3>Missions Met</h3></center>

<p>

To be sure, the 104th Congress did not achieve all of its
objectives.  But the addition of a large group of conservative
freshmen substantially changed the legislative agenda.  These
freshmen apparently had an impact on national policy even before
they took office.  On Nov. 10, 1994 -- two days after the election
that reversed control of Congress -- the Justice Department abandoned
its two-year effort to weaken the interpretation of a child pornography
statute.  According to a new book by former Surgeon General Joycelyn
Elders, the election results also prompted the administration
to reverse a decision to provide clean needles to drug addicts.

<p>

The new chairman of the House Judiciary Subcommittee on the
Constitution, Rep. Charles Canady (R-Fla.), was in the forefront
of congressional initiatives to defend the traditional definition
of marriage and ban partial-birth abortions.  Canady held very
illuminating hearings in his subcommittee, helping to set the
stage for overwhelming House approval of the Defense of Marriage
Act and the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban.

<p>

Sen. Don Nickles (R-Okla.), the Senate sponsor of the Defense
of Marriage Act (DOMA), fended off an effort by Sens. Ted Kennedy
(D-Mass.), Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) and others to attach the
Employment Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA) and other pro-homosexual
amendments to DOMA.  The Human Rights Campaign, a major homosexual
rights advocacy group, took credit for developing this amendment
strategy to &quot;derail&quot; the Defense of Marriage Act, which
they alleged was &quot;hate-driven.&quot;  Nickles and Majority
Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.) negotiated an agreement that provided
for a clean vote on DOMA, followed by an up or down vote on Sen.
Kennedy's ENDA proposal.

<p>

An overwhelming majority of senators agreed with the argument
that marriage was not instituted to 'discriminate' against homosexuals,
but rather to unite one man and one woman and provide a strong
foundation for the nurturing of children.  President Clinton signed
DOMA into law at 12:50 a.m. on Sept. 21.  Despite last-minute
phone calls from the president to wavering senators, the Kennedy
homosexual jobs proposal came up one vote short, 49-50.

<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>
<center><i><font size=+2>
"THE 104TH CONGRESS<br>
TOOK HISTORIC STEPS."
</font></i></center>
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>

Congress produced strong majorities in favor of the Partial-Birth
Abortion Ban, but on Sept. 26 the Senate fell eight votes short
of the two-thirds majority necessary to override a veto.
Despite administration objections, Congress did succeed in enacting
five pro-life provisions as amendments to spending bills.  One
of these measures protects medical schools from the loss of federal
funds if they refuse to provide abortion training. Another restores
a limitation on funding of abortions through federal employees'
health insurance programs.

<p>

<center><h3>More Vetoes</h3></center>

<p>

Several new anti-pornography bills were enacted and signed
into law by the president, but they will face difficult battles
in the courts.  Congress passed a balanced budget and family tax
relief package, but it was vetoed.  A modified welfare reform
package was enacted into law after stronger measures were twice
vetoed.

<p>

Line-item veto authority was provided to the president, effective
January 1997.  Vice President Gore suggested on a weekend news
program that this would give the administration leverage to press
Congress to liberalize welfare policies.

<p>

Since every new Congress starts with a clean slate, the policies
enacted during the past two years will be subject to revision
by the next Congress and president.

<p>

<center><h3>Whose Children Are They?</h3></center>

<p>

Parents, have you encountered
incidents where your rights to parent your children have been
infringed upon, at schools or elsewhere?  Please send all stories
to the attention of FRC congressional liason Jacqueline Halbig,
who is compiling these incidents as part of a research project.

<h3>On the Hill</h3>

<p>

<b>FDA Checks Parents.</b> House Commerce Committee Chairman
Thomas J. Bliley (R-Va.) recently held hearings into why the FDA
refuses to allow the marketing of an Atlanta mother's drug testing
kit to parents who want to test their children.  FDA regulations
label the kit (a plastic cup and a shipping box) as a &quot;Class
III&quot; medical device, equivalent to an MRI or  pacemaker.
Even though businesses and athletic teams use the same kit, the
FDA claims it &quot;is concerned about issues such as anonymity,
confidentiality, coercion, and family discord.&quot;  Will the
same considerations govern FDA rulings on RU-486?

<p><a name="ex-gay">

<b>Hope for Homosexuals.</b> On Oct. 10, FRC co-sponsored a press
conference for the Second Annual Coming Out of Homosexuality Day
(Oct. 11) and the new support group, Parents, Family and Friends
of Ex-Gays (PFOX).  Hosted by Michael Johnston, a former homosexual
who is HIV-positive, the event was taped for C-SPAN.  FRC Cultural
Studies Director Bob Knight also spoke, along with <I>Lambda Report</I>
editor Peter LaBarbera, the Philadelphia Family Policy Council's
Bill Devlin, Tom and Ann Taylor, who have a homosexual son, and

<b>Refuge for Abortion Victims.</b> Several immigration provisions
were rolled into the FY 1997 Omnibus Appropriations package, including
a humanitarian measure which allows people fleeing from coercive
abortion policies to seek asylum in the United States.  Effective
immediately, asylum may be granted for up to 1,000 people per
year who have been forcibly aborted or involuntarily sterilized,
or have a well-founded fear of persecution under coercive population
control policies. This restores a similar policy which was effective
under the Reagan and Bush administrations.

<p>

<b>Immigrants and AIDS Treatment.</b> Congress dropped a provision
in its immigration legislation preventing taxpayer-funding of
HIV-AIDS treatment for legal and illegal aliens.  Rep. Lamar Smith
(R-Texas) and Sen. Alan Simpson (R-Wyo.), chairmen of House and
Senate immigration subcommittees, said the change could encourage
&quot;thousands of HIV-infected aliens to seek asylum in the U.S.&quot;
Despite a 1993 law barring admission of HIV-positive immigrants,
earlier this year the White House directed the Immigration and
Naturalization Service (INS) to consider granting asylum to HIV-positive
individuals.

<b>Elders on Drugs.</b> As Surgeon General, Joycelyn Elders called
for a drug legalization study, favored giving needles to
addicts and advocated marijuana as medicine.  On Oct. 9, she blamed
the new teenage drug epidemic on easy-to-get marijuana and then
said pot &quot;probably causes very little problem to anyone.&quot;
Marijuana can be addictive, damages the immune system, causes
respiratory diseases and mental disorders, and impairs coordination
and judgment.

<p>

<b>Gagging Chaplains.</b> Air Force Reserve chaplain Fr. Vincent
Rigdon has filed a federal lawsuit against the Secretary of Defense
(<I>Rigdon v. Perry</I>) for interfering with his religious liberty
and free speech by issuing a &quot;gag order&quot; that bars religious
leaders from discussing specific legislation in sermons or counseling.
In June, a Pentagon directive to Catholic military chaplains
prohibited them from &quot;participating or urging others to participate&quot;
in a nationwide postcard mailing to Congress which supported a
vote to override the veto of the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act.

<p>

<b>Bork's Beatitudes.</b> Will America survive?  Not without
strong churches, says Robert Bork, respected jurist and author
of the controversial new book <I>Slouching Towards Gomorrah: 
Modern Liberalism and American Decline.</I> Bork contends that
the loss of reliable standards of right and wrong has resulted
in a &quot;loss of nerve, which means the community cannot summon
the will to suppress&quot; many social ills such as pornography
and crime. &quot;The Church which ought to be shaping and influencing
culture is instead being influenced by culture,&quot; Bork says.

<b>Insulting Hispanics.</b> Apparently, the Enola Gay controversy
taught the Smithsonian Institute little.  Hispanic Heritage Month,
which ended on Oct. 15, featured Andres Serrano, best known for
his vulgar and anti-Christian art.  (His creations include a crucifix
immersed in a jar of urine.)  The Hispanic community lacks not
for serious artists.  Selecting Serrano &quot;because of the body
of his work&quot; reveals the politically correct values of the
Smithsonian.  Such art merits no taxpayer money.  The real irony
is that Serrano would receive no support if his works glorified
Christian symbols.

<b>PX Porn Challenge.</b> Now that the sale of pornographic materials
at military stores has been prohibited, <I>Penthouse</I> publisher
Bob Guccione is challenging the 1997 Defense Authorization Bill,
claiming it is unconstitutional.  Guccione's magazine alone earned
$1.16 of the $4.6 million in 1995 sales at the Pentagon's worldwide
chain of tax-supported stores.  Mr. Guccione's real gripe with
the new law may be its threat to his revenues.  Getting the U.S.
government out of the porn business has been an accomplishment
10 years in the making.

<b>BULLETIN --</b> In education news, the CAREERS bill (H.R. 1617)

Congress next year.

<h3>Katy Bar The Schoolhouse Door To Parents</h3>

<p>

Parents effectively lose their right to direct the upbringing
of their children when they drop them off at school, according
to one federal court judge.  Earlier this year, Judge Melinda
Harmon, appointed by President Bush, ruled that Katy Independent
School District in Texas did not violate parents' rights by allowing
Child Protective Services to interrogate a student without notifying
his parents, nor by instructing him to lie to his parents about
the incident.

<p>

Take, for example, the case of 6-year-old Jonathan Prevette,
who last month kissed a classmate in Lexington, N.C.  Such incidents
have a long history in schoolyards across America and, until now,
were brushed off as childhood innocence, or reprimanded by teachers
and principals after discussing the situation with parents.  But
this time it was called &quot;sexual harassment.&quot;  The &quot;culprit&quot;
was suspended for a misdemeanor he can't even spell.

<p>

What prompted such a response?  Perhaps it was a nudge from
the U.S. Education Department, which this summer distributed guidelines
urging schools to set up sexual harassment policies.  Schools
were warned that under Title IX &quot;gender equity&quot; provisions
for federally funded programs, they may be held liable for letting
&quot;sexual harassment&quot; among students go unnoticed.

<p>

With even admiring looks now considered &quot;sexual harassment,&quot;
it is no wonder a school would seek cover from lawsuits by laying
down a blanket prohibition against anything remotely affectionate.
Ironically, the very same federal Education Department has promoted
sex education schemes that push condoms and the like on boys and
girls at even younger ages.

<p>

Such cold, heavy-handed responses to children like Jonathan
Prevette will continue if federal court decisions shut parents
out and let a remote and liberal federal education bureaucracy
hand down one-size-fits-all policies.  Embracing parents, on the
other hand, would result in the improved discipline and academics
many schools now seek in vain.

<h3>A Duty to Die?</h3>

<p>

The Supreme Court has accepted two important cases concerning
doctor-aided suicide.  In <I>Glucksburg v. Washington</I>, the
Ninth Circuit federal court &quot;found&quot; a constitutional
&quot;liberty&quot; right for terminally-ill patients to be killed
by their doctors.  Judge Stephen Reinhardt explained that his
reasoning is &quot;identical&quot; to the Supreme Court abortion
cases of <I>Roe v. Wade</I> and <I>Planned Parenthood v. Casey</I>.
These poisonous precedents live on, defending the destruction
of life.

<p>

The other case creates a constitutional right to be killed
by a doctor, not based on &quot;liberty&quot; but &quot;equality.&quot;
The Second Circuit federal court in <I>Vacco v. Quill</I> declared
that the New York law against causing or assisting suicide was
unconstitutional because it discriminates among terminally-ill
people.  According to the court, refusing artificial life support
and getting a lethal injection are equivalent, and since the former
is permitted, the latter may not be prohibited.

<p>

If these decisions are not overturned by the high court,
a &quot;right to die&quot; may soon become a &quot;duty to die&quot;
for those most in need.

<p>

A recent report on the Netherlands euthanasia experience
by Rep. Charles Canady (R-Fla.) provides a compelling context
for the current debate on doctor-assisted suicide in America.
Euthanasia of the terminally ill in the Netherlands has been
expanded since its inception in 1973 to permit the killing of
healthy people experiencing psychological distress.  Voluntary
euthanasia has given way to involuntary euthanasia, called &quot;termination
of the patient without explicit request.&quot;  In 1990, 1,000
people in the Netherlands were killed without their consent, 140
of whom were fully competent.

<p>

FRC is part of a broad coalition of groups urging the Court
to overturn the lower rulings, drafting <I>amicus</I> briefs detailing
the right of society to forbid euthanasia, and recounting the
tragedy of pre-Nazi Germany, where mercy killing was thought to
be the compassionate response to the plight of physically or mentally
disabled people, &quot;life unworthy of life.&quot;  Germany has
learned from its horrific mistakes, and now calls mercy killing
a crime against humanity.  Pray that the Supreme Court will not
sacrifice the lives of the infirm as they have done the lives
of the unborn.

<font size=+2><b><i>An Exercise of Citizenship</i></b></font><br>
by Gary L. Bauer
</center>

<p>

<font size=+3>E</font>veryone needs to belong, to identify with something 
larger than self.  For some it is religion, for some it is a social 
construct, and for virtually all, it is national identity, citizenship, a
precious commodity involving rights, duties, and privileges.
I for one cannot imagine what it would be like to be the fabled
&quot;man without a country&quot; -- a man without citizenship.

<p>

Millions of people have left friends, family and their native
lands to immigrate, often at great personal risk, to the United
States.  Why?  Inscribed on the Statue of Liberty are the words,
&quot;Give me your tired, your poor; your huddled masses yearning
to breathe free. ...&quot;  That's it.  They come here for freedom.
Freedom of opportunity, of religion, from oppression, to raise
their families, to educate their children, to associate with friends
of their choice, and to achieve the American Dream.  They have
come because America is the land of the free.

<p>

Becoming an American involves more than a labeling process.
It implies adopting our language, customs, and national as well
as historical traditions.  It requires swearing allegiance to
the Constitution of the United States, renouncing fidelity to
any foreign state, and expressing willingness to serve this nation
as required by and under the law.

<p>

Recently, however, the process of becoming a U.S. citizen
has been &quot;dumbed down.&quot;  In the last 12 months, according
to published accounts, the Immigration and Naturalization Service
has conducted a full-court press to naturalize more than 1.2 million
new citizens.  Congressional hearings reveal that in the process,
longstanding rules have been bent, the citizenship test has been
simplified, citizenship has been granted to people who could not
speak English and, in many cases, criminal background checks may
have been bypassed.

<p>

Despite denial by the INS, evidence suggests that in at least
one case, hundreds of tests were submitted all of which were completed
in the same handwriting.  Extensive testimony before the Senate
Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration alleges a White House-initiated,
election-year effort to dramatically accelerate the naturalization
of new immigrants prior to Nov. 5.

<p>

The blessings of this land have not been bought cheaply.
Millions have paid the ultimate price while defending our way
of life.  To grant citizenship cheaply to anyone who applies or
for political advantage is an insult to those who have served
this nation.

<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>
<center><i><font size=+2>
"THE BLESSINGS OF THIS<br>
LAND HAVE NOT BEEN<br>
BOUGHT CHEAPLY."
</font></i></center>
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>

Every American is endowed with the God-given right to life,
liberty and the pursuit of happiness.  Among the privileges are
the freedom to participate in the social, economic, political,
religious and cultural aspects of the community.  No wonder people
around the globe aspire to come to our shores!

<p>

Rights are important, but there are obligations crucial to
the survival of a free society.  Citizenship imposes broad responsibilities
on our nation, our community, our neighbors and our families.
One of the most cherished of these is the obligation to vote.
This democratic republic will survive only if it is truly representative
of all the people, and that requires broad participation in the
political process.

<p>

Sadly, far too few Christians go to the polls.  Abraham Lincoln
believed elections to be so important that he offered furloughs
to soldiers who wanted to vote. Edmund Burke said, &quot;All it
takes for evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing.&quot;
Now is not the time for any of us, whatever our heritage, to
lower the standards of good citizenship.  After all, we are men
and women <I>with</I> a country -- a country that needs us more
than ever.

<p><hr size=5 noshade><p>
<a name="compact"><center><h1>An American Compact</h1></center>
<p>
<font size=+3>O</font>ne year after the Republican Contract with America, 
FRC President Gary Bauer has written a book in which he announces &quot;A 
Compact with Our Fellow Americans.&quot; Like the GOP Contract,
this Compact is an effort to put down on paper the goals of a movement. 
It follows in the long tradition of &quot;getting it in writing&quot; which 
has characterized our people's history, from Magna Carta to the U.S. 
Constitution.  Like the Contract, too, it contains 10 key items and invites 
supporters to sign on.
<p>
But the Compact differs in that it seeks to go beyond reforms to be enacted 
by Congress. Rather, it emphasizes actions which Americans can take in their 
homes, churches and communities, even if reform is thwarted in Congress. 
The Compact also differs in that any American, regardless of party ties, 
can freely subscribe to it.  The &quot;Compact with Our Fellow Americans&quot; 
touches on what Alexis de Tocqueville called the &quot;habits of the heart&quot;
which define and preserve us as a free people.
<p>
<center><h3>What We Want</h3></center>
<p>
The Compact is part of Gary Bauer's new book, <i>Our Hopes, Our Dreams:
A Vision for America</i>. The book is being published this month by Focus 
on the Family. <i>Our Hopes, Our Dreams</i> is an effort to go directly to 
Americans, to appeal to their hearts, <i>without the reinterpretation and
distortion of the major media</i>. It seeks to answer the question so often 
asked by brusque reporters, but which is also asked with sincerity by many 
of our fellow citizens:  &quot;What do you people want?&quot;
<p>
Bauer states the case for a pro-family America.  He tackles head-on
not only the issues which shape our political choices, but, more importantly, 
those cultural questions, beliefs and actions which determine whether our 
American experiment in ordered liberty will survive at all.  Despite
the facts that we are not at war and that Wall Street's Dow Jones
Index has been daily reaching new highs, most people think our country is 
on the wrong track.
<p>
Bauer recently spoke to this anxiety when he told Dan Rather: &quot;I 
want to see an America where I don't have to worry about date rape when my 
daughter goes out for the first time at college. I want an America where, 
when a young man pledges to love and honor her for the rest of their lives, 
there is a good chance he means it.  I want a country where children come 
first again and where virtue is honored, a place where values matter and 
the American Dream is still real.&quot;
<p>
<i>Our Hopes, Our Dreams</i> is not just a policy manual.  It goes behind
today's headlines and tomorrow's talk shows to explore the reasons why 
conservatives defend the family as the fundamental unit of society. It 
describes in detail what this nation would look like if the pro-family
cause were to triumph.  It seeks to summarize the aspirations of families 
and to quell the fears of citizens who have been urged by the polarizing 
media to view &quot;family values&quot; with grave suspicion.
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>
<center><i><font size=+2>&quot;MOVE BEYOND<br>
BREAD-ALONE POLITICS...&quot;</font></i></center>
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>
Even though the book includes over 100 public policy recommendations,
it ultimately resists the temptation to put &quot;our trust in princes,&quot; 
as if the cure for America's ills could be found in Washington. It challenges 
our national leadership to move beyond &quot;bread-alone&quot; politics.  It
includes some thoughtful questions for citizens to ask all candidates
who seek power over us, giving pro-family Americans the chance to shape 
public debate.
<p>
<center><h3>Getting the Word Out</h3></center>
<p>
Look for <i>Our Hopes, Our Dreams: A Vision for America</i> at your local
Christian bookstore, or use the enclosed card to order from us.  Urge your 
neighborhood group, your church, your public library to obtain copies. 
Share them with family and friends who may be sympathetic but skeptical. 
This is a year of decision.  The decisions that are made will shape the world 
our children inherit.

<h3>On the Hill</h3>
<p>
<b>Kinsey's Pedo-File.</b>  U.S. Rep. Steve Stockman (R-Tex.) has introduced
a bill, with over 40 cosponsors, calling for federal investigation into the 
infamous Kinsey sex studies.  The &quot;Child Protection and Ethics in 
Education Act&quot; also calls for a cut-off of federal funds to programs 
that use the Kinsey research uncritically.  Media attention continues
to build regarding Kinsey Institute Director John Bancroft's admission that 
a key table on child sexuality was based on the records of a single pedophile. 
FRC has publicly called on the Institute to identify all of its pedophile 
sources.
<p>
<b>In the Dark.</b> What had originally been slated as a House hearing
to expose &quot;the homosexual agenda in schools&quot; turned into a 
mostly watered-down exercise on &quot;parents, schools and values.&quot; 
The Dec. 5 and 6 hearing drew little media coverage.  Virtually
ignored was shocking testimony by avowed lesbian Claire Connelly of 
Ventura County, California, who gave evidence that millions of taxpayer 
dollars' worth of AIDS programming is being hijacked by homosexual activist
groups. The hearing was held by the House Subcommittee on Oversight
and Investigations.
<p>
<b>Not with My Kid.</b>  A hearing was held in November on the Family
Privacy Protection Act (H.R. 1271), which requires researchers to get 
written parental permission before administering surveys to children. 
FRC's Robert Knight supported the bill in testimony before the Senate 
Committee on Governmental Affairs.  Knight said the law is needed because 
some researchers are prying into family matters and/or asking children 
graphic questions about sex. The FRC video about Alfred Kinsey, <i>The 
Children of Table 34</i>, was submitted to the committee to illustrate 
research run amok.

<b>Life Gains.</b> On Dec. 7, the Senate passed the Partial-Birth Abortion
Ban Act, 54-44.  Since the Senate-passed version has been amended slightly, 
a final version still must be approved by the House, possibly by the end of 
January.  After final congressional approval, the bill will go to
President Clinton, who threatens to veto it.  While thousands of Americans 
are calling the White House about this legislation, it is also important to 
educate your neighbors by writing letters to the editor and calling talk 
radio programs.

<p>
<b>Slippery Summit.</b> Ever since the 1989 governors' education summit
in Charlottesville, Va., produced the National Education Goals and 
prompted Goals 2000, Americans are rightly suspicious of such gatherings. 
When word got out last summer about a follow-up meeting to recommit to 
the national goals, the ensuing uproar scuttled the meeting. Now a summit 
is scheduled for March 26-27 in Palisades, New York.  Business leaders
have been invited to join governors to discuss opportunities for participation 
in the Goals 2000 school restructuring. Unfortunately, a new partner in a bad 
venture won't improve it.
<p>
<b>Holiday Spirit.</b> On Dec. 19, Andrei Codrescu, a commentator on
National Public Radio's <i>All Things Considered</i>, said this about 
the Christian concept of Rapture: &quot;The evaporation of four
million who believe in this crap would leave the world a better
place.&quot;  The taxpayer-funded NPR issued an apology. The week 
before Christmas, NPR also devoted considerable air time to commentators 
who tried to debunk Christianity.  And it was business as usual over 
at PBS, which re-aired the sexually explicit homosexual series <i>Tales 
of the City</i>.
<p>

<p><a name="npr">
<b>New Allies?</b> While the fate of the GOP's $500 per child tax credit
remains tied up in the budget deadlock, the National Parenting Association 
(NPA), a liberal academic group, has begun to lobby for pro-family tax cuts. 
On Dec. 15, an NPA youth violence task force hosted testimony
from representatives of Promise Keepers, the Christian pro-fatherhood
group that reached 826,000 men in 1995.  Meanwhile, a new Heritage Foundation 
study shows that the Clinton family tax cut covers 23 million fewer children 
than the GOP proposal.
<p>
<b>Maine Rebounds.</b> Pro-family forces have won a big victory in the
Pine Tree State.  For the first time in 20 years, Maine legislators won't 
face homosexual rights legislation in 1996.  An openly lesbian state 
senator withdrew the bill, citing the need for &quot;healing&quot;
on the issue.  But the real reason was the bill's certain defeat.  In 
November, voters narrowly rejected a statewide referendum that would 
have struck down local gay rights laws.  Outspent 10 to one, pro-family 
forces still snagged 47 percent of the vote, sending lawmakers a message.
<p>
<b>Saving Marriages.</b> Divorce reform is gaining momentum in the new
year.  Michigan and Iowa are among states likely to consider bills that 
reintroduce the fault concept in contested cases where children are present. 
Randy Hekman, head of the Michigan Family Forum, a member of the Association 
of State Policy Councils, points out that under current law, &quot;I can 
divorce my wife of 26 years with less difficulty than I can fire a 
secretary I hired last week.&quot;

<h3>Cyberprogress</h3>
<p>
At the end of 1995, staff members for the House and Senate
conferees on the large telecommunications deregulation bill came to 
agreement on strong pornography restrictions, but only after a series 
of tough negotiations.  Leaving pornography unrestricted in cyberspace 
would be like leaving a loaded gun on a playground.  If the &quot;telecom
bill&quot; is passed, the anti-cyberporn language will help parents protect 
their children by making pornography inaccessible by children.
<p>
Highlights of the cyberporn provisions as negotiated include:
<p><ul>
<li>Use of a court-approved indecency standard, defined in
the bill as an <b>&quot;image or other communication that, in context, 
depicts or describes, in terms patently offensive as measured by 
contemporary community standards, sexual or excretory activities or 
organs&quot;</b>;
<p>
<li>Indecent communications are available to adults but <b>barred
to children</b>;
<p>
<li>People are liable only for <b>knowing violations</b> of the law;
<p>
<li>Online service providers are not liable for violations beyond areas 
they own or control;
<p>
<li>E-mail privacy laws are left unchanged;
<p>
<li>Those making good faith efforts to keep pornography away
from children have a defense against prosecution.
</ul><p>
Contrary to much of the current rhetoric from civil libertarians,
the anti-cyberporn provisions could not be used to find Shakespeare or 
any other serious work of literature or art to be indecent. Adults with 
common sense do not confuse art and literature with patently offensive
materials which degrade women, harm children, and corrupt men.
Under the indecency standard, the courts will be obliged to evaluate 
material in its proper context.
<p>
A few other provisions of the bill remained unresolved as <i>Watch</i> 
went to press. Congressional leaders should make every effort to conclude 
these matters as soon as possible, so that we do not risk losing the 
opportunity to protect our children from the cultural poison of cyberporn.
<p>
FRC's legal policy director took part in the negotiations leading to 
these provisions.  In the past, telecommunications reform has happened once 
a generation. FRC will continue to monitor this legislation in the days 
to come.

<h3>FRC: Ready and Abel</h3>
<p>
FRC's Military Readiness Project (MRP) is challenging the Clinton
administration's military personnel policies in the courts.  On Dec. 5, the 
MRP had the rare privilege to make oral arguments before the U.S. Circuit 
Court of Appeals in Richmond, Va., in the case of <i>Thomasson v. Perry</i>. 
Thomasson is an avowed homosexual who wants the military's ban declared 
unconstitutional.  The MRP defended the law's intended meaning, while
the U.S. Justice Department hid behind the Clinton administration's faulty 
regulations.  A decision is expected in April.
<p>
Last summer, the MRP filed a brief in <i>Abel et al. v. U.S.A.</i>, which
involves six avowedly homosexual service members.  This case was scheduled 
for oral argument in the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan on Dec. 
19.  That hearing was delayed after a Clinton-appointed judge was reminded 
that he had made a biased comment about the issue.  The hearing was re-set 
for mid-January with a decision expected this spring.  This case will
compete with <i>Thomasson</i> for a high court hearing next year.
<p>
On other fronts, the MRP worked with key members of Congress
to close a loophole in President Clinton's regulations on homosexuals. 
In response to Hill queries, the Pentagon's general counsel wrote a 
memo to the services clarifying Clinton's &quot;don't ask, don't tell&quot; 
regulations which say that &quot;sexual orientation&quot; is not a bar to 
military service. The memo was necessary because last summer a Navy 
administrative board used the faulty regulations to retain an avowed lesbian 
who promised to avoid homosexual acts.
<p>
Meanwhile, on Dec. 15, the MRP filed a Supreme Court brief in
<i>U.S.A. v. Commonwealth of Virginia</i> (the Virginia Military Institute 
case).  The Clinton administration wants the high court to impose a 
&quot;strict scrutiny&quot; standard which would make all classifications 
by gender very hard to defend legally.  With high court approval, this would 
amount to back-door adoption of the Equal Rights Amendment, reviving old 
debates about everything from the Boy Scouts to unisex bathrooms. It would 
also remove most gender-based exemptions in the military, like women serving
in infantry units.  The FRC brief argues that gender classifications
should be subject to a less exacting standard.

<center><font size=+2><b><i>Hope Is a Hand-up</i></b></font><br>
by Gary L. Bauer</center>
<p>
<font size=+3>J</font>ust before Christmas, Family Research Council hosted 
an important event in Washington.  It was a one-day conference, with 
distinguished speakers like authors Michael Novak and Dr. Marvin
Olasky.  The conference was devoted to the tragedy of poverty, with a 
close look at the tricky question of welfare reform.
<p>
I'm more convinced than ever that we must look with new eyes at
the scale of this tragedy.  It's really not enough to say that certain 
kinds of welfare reform will cause suffering.  We have to come to terms 
with the degree of suffering that is happening right now -- and not just 
suffering from material want, but from the sense of purposelessness that
saps the human spirit.
<p>
Those of us who believe most fiercely in the durability of traditional
values are precisely the ones to stand up now and say that every individual 
has qualities that no welfare system should be allowed to destroy. FRC 
recognizes that the best and most compassionate help comes from
private individuals who build personal relationships and offer
material support simultaneously. A hand-up not a handout. The premise is 
that needy individuals are not &quot;clients,&quot; but fellow human
beings.
<p>
America cannot implement neat, clean, top-down policies that will
jumpstart a network of caring in every community.  Instead, each of us must 
take direct action to heal the hurt -- not at the ballot box, but in our 
neighborhoods and communities as we minister daily to needy individuals.
<p>
One happy byproduct is that our own children, by watching our
example, will grow to appreciate what is great and good.  Even strong 
parents depend on the interplay of thoughtful neighbors to help pattern 
right habits of the heart.
<p>
FRC is taking the initiative to encourage a new ethic of caring
because, I believe, social conservatives are the very people who have the 
idealism and initiative to build up a new network of helping institutions. 
As we have begun to speak out, we have discovered that the scale of the
crisis is an unprecedented opportunity for us to demonstrate, in full 
technicolor action, a fundamental truth:  Traditional values are traditional 
because they are functional.
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>
<center><i><font size=+2>TRADITIONAL VALUES<br>
ARE<br>
FUNCTIONAL VALUES</font></i></center>
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>
When nothing else moves the needle, God's ways work.  His love
binds up wounds.  Our service to those who are hurting is one of the most 
obvious means we have at our disposal to let earth know what heaven looks like. 
God's love looks most beautiful, in fact, against a backdrop of despair.
<p>
Dr. Virgil Gulker, founder of Kids Hope USA, tells a story about
one small step in a child's journey to God.  Kids Hope USA aims to link adult 
volunteers in one-to-one relationships with at-risk children. This Christmas 
season, one volunteer took &quot;her child&quot; to see a Christmas pageant
at her church that included a living nativity.  As Mary, Joseph,
and the baby Jesus took their places, the child Amanda turned to her new 
friend and asked with wide eyes, &quot;Is this real?&quot;  The volunteer 
replied, &quot;Oh yes, Amanda, it's very real.&quot;
<p>
That moment almost undoubtedly left a mark on Amanda's soul. In time, 
I suspect, she will be much more likely to regard that scene as real 
because one of God's loving servants was sitting by her side.
<p>

Freshmen members of the House of Representatives are in the media
glare as the budget dispute continues between Congress and the White House. 
The first-termers have been called both &quot;principled citizen 
legislators&quot; and &quot;inflexible extremists.&quot; What's the 
reality?
<p>
Nearly all of the freshmen have strongly endorsed term limits
and committed to do what they think is right, regardless of short-term 
political consequences. They want a balanced budget and tax relief for 
America's families.  Their insistence on these policies led to stronger 
agreements with the Senate than first seemed possible.  They have been 
just as tough in negotiations with the White House.
<p>
Moreover, despite President Clinton's opposition, the freshmen
have helped to restore two abortion limitations that were overturned 
during the last Congress: limits on abortion funding through federal 
health insurance programs and a ban on elective abortions in overseas 
military hospitals.
<p>
Freshmen House members also helped sidetrack a bill to fully fund
the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA).  Their efforts forced the House 
leadership to zero out NEA funding within two years.
<p>
The principles of this freshman class will be further demonstrated
in 1996 as they strive to move parental rights and religious liberties 
legislation through Congress. They are truly making a difference on issues 
vital to pro-family Americans.

</center>

Robert H. Knight examines cutting-edge social issues that affect and 
are affected by cultural values.  Of special interest are federal 
policies relating to arts funding, sex-related topics and education, 
censorship and freedom of expression, as well as the role of public 
interest groups and the media.  Mr. Knight wrote, produced and 
directed the 1994 FRC video documentary about Alfred Kinsey, <I>The 
Children of Table 34.</I>

<p>

Prior to joining FRC, Mr. Knight headed a similar program as Senior 
Fellow for Cultural Policy Studies at the Heritage Foundation.  
That program examined federal policies that undermine the traditional 
values of family sovereignty, religious freedom, property rights, 
individual responsibility and the idea of limited government.

<p>

While at Heritage, Mr. Knight authored studies on the 
<A HREF="/townhall/FRC/insight/is95a1cu.html">National Endowment for the 
Arts</A>, the U.S. Labor Department's regulatory disputes with the 
Salvation Army, the federal role in early childhood education, and 
the debate over the exemption of women from military combat roles. 
He testified before the U.S. Senate's Labor and Human Resources 
Committee in July 1994 as well as the Presidential Commission on the 
Assignment of Women in the Armed Services in 1992, and was an expert 
witness in the 1993 Colorado legal case dealing with Amendment 2, 
which barred cities from extending special civil rights protections 
based on sexual orientation.  He also testified in January 1995 before 
a House Appropriations subcommittee concerning the Corporation for 
Public Broadcasting and at a CPB public hearing in Washington in 
January 1994.

<p>

Before joining Heritage in September 1990, Mr. Knight was a Media 
Fellow at the Hoover Institution, Stanford University, where he 
researched and began writing a book on cultural relativism.

<p>

Mr. Knight was a news editor and writer with the <I>Los Angeles 
Times</I>, where he worked for seven years prior to his Hoover 
fellowship.  During his 15 years in journalism, Mr. Knight has 
written for <I> The Wall Street Journal, National Review, Chicago 
Tribune, Philadelphia Inquirer, Baltimore Sun, Washington Times, 
San Francisco Chronicle, Orange County Register</I> and other 
publications.  He has appeared on the <i>CBS Evening News, NBC 
Nightly News</i>, ABC's <i>World News Tonight</i>, ABC's 
<i>Nightline</i>, CNN's <i>Crossfire</i>, NPR's <i>All Things 
Considered</i>, CNN's <i>Sonya Live</i>, CNBC'S <i>McLaughlin</i>, 
NBC's <i>A Closer Look</i>, NPR's <i>Fresh Air,</i> a PBS special 
on the arts and other television and radio broadcasts.

<p>

Mr. Knight worked for the <I>Fort Lauderdale News/Sun Sentinel</I> 
as a weekend project coordinator and copy editor, with the 
<I>Maryland Gazette </I>as assistant editor and the <I>Annapolis 
Evening Capital</I> as a reporter, and as a reporter and later 
editor of the <I>Maryland Coast Press</I>.

<p>

Mr. Knight has a Master's degree and a Bachelor of Science degree 
in political science from American University in Washington, D.C.

This month marks a departure from the usual format of <i>Washington Watch</i>. While most families are beginning summer vacations from school, Congress is entering the heart of its regular legislative schedule.  This special issue of <i>Watch</i> is designed to bring you up to date on what FRC regards as the most important pro-family policy measures pending on Capitol Hill.
<p>
On the inside pages, you'll find a convenient "scorecard" on the legislative achievements of the 104th Congress.  You may want to keep a copy handy for future reference.  Feel free to duplicate copies of these pages as you see fit for your neighbors or your church.

<font size=+2><b><i>Dear Reader:</i></b></font>
<p>Late last year, <i>The Wall Street Journal</i> asked me to write an essay on what pro-family Americans expected from the new Congress.  I was happy to do so, even though I had to begin my article with a concession.  The concession was this:  the new Congress should keep the promises made in the Republican Contract with America -- most of which involved economic and structural reforms -- then turn to the social agenda:  reversing the breakdown of the family, defunding our grossly mismanaged (and too often simply gross) arts agencies, protecting the sanctity of human life, reforming the education mess.
<p>
In the last four months, the pro-family movement has helped to implement a lot of reforms related to the budget and the economy.  Now it's time to deal with issues related to our families and values.  Patience may be its own reward, but in public policy, too much patience can be poison.  In my two decades in Washington, I have witnessed only a handful of opportunities for progress on a pro-family platform.  We are now in the midst of such an opportunity.  We can move forward and see dramatic policy change to strengthen the family unit morally, socially and economically.
<p>
Or we can see the opposite.  Because just as this opportunity is upon us, so too is there unprecedented danger to the family.  Every parent in America senses this fact.  To read a daily newspaper is to be bombarded with a hail of horrors.  To look at our nation's illegitimacy rate -- and to understand its correlation with youth crime -- is to recognize that America may be just a decade away from an explosion of street violence.  To see the staggering toll of abortions, the pressures on our court system to sanction euthanasia and assisted suicide, and other anti-life trends, is to know that the nation is perilously close to complete dissolution of the Judeo-Christian consensus that has sustained it through the centuries.
<p>
A wise veteran on Capitol Hill put our situation to me bluntly.  For the first time since it has been his job to understand the pulse of the American people, he cannot tell which way this nation is headed.  In the next five years, he said, anything seems possible, from a religious and pro-family renaissance to an utter collapse of traditional values that brings on drug legalization, homosexual marriages, and all-pervasive pornography.  
<p>
Life and death truly have been set before us.  Which way we will choose?  What follows in this special edition of <i>Washington Watch</i> is an effort to lay out an agenda for <i>the way of life</i> -- an American way of life.  My hope is that you will share these pages with your friends, your neighbors and those with whom you attend church.  Each of us has the responsibility to take a clear look at the alternatives that lie before us -- before the window of opportunity is shut.

<i>Introduction:  The architecture of family freedom is no accident, even if, once upon a time in America, government officials almost instinctively adopted policies to protect family stability and promote civic character.  Today, both deliberate and unintentional assaults upon the family have multiplied.  But the structure of the family is written on the heart of humanity.  Lawmakers can ignore that God-given structure, but they cannot erase it.  Here are ways that the 104th Congress can help to restore family-friendly public policy</i>.
<p>
<a name="life"><center><h3>Restoring the Sanctity of Human Life</h3></center>
<p>
<b>1. The Civil Right to Life.</b> Four members of the House, two Democrats and two Republicans, have introduced constitutional amendments to restore the right to life of children before birth.  Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) has introduced S. 320, the "Unborn Children's Civil Rights Act."  It would put Congress on record as declaring, among other things, that the U.S. Constitution sanctions no right to abortion and that <i>Roe v. Wade</i> was improperly decided.  It would also bar any federal funding or promotion of abortion, and provide for an expedited right of appeal to the Supreme Court when any abortion restriction is found unconstitutional by a lower court.  These proposals do not merely "modify" the abortion right, they would give protection to unborn children for the first time in 22 years.
<p>
<b>2. Members Against Dismemberment</b>. As a first step toward providing constitutional protection for unborn children, Rep. Charles Canady (R-Fla.) and Henry Hyde (R-Ill.) will offer legislation to ban "partial birth abortions," which involve the heinous D&X procedure performed on unborn children 20-26 weeks of gestation.  Hearings are scheduled this month in the House Judiciary Committee, Subcommittee on the Constitution.
<p>
<b>3. "Lady Liberty" Means No to Forced Abortions.</b> The Clinton administration has shown blatant disregard for fundamental human rights by overturning previous administrations' asylum policy for families fleeing China's coercive "birth quota" system, with its forced abortions and sterilizations.  Rep. Chris Smith (R-N.J.) recently attached language to the foreign aid bill (H.R. 1561) to restore the previous policy.  By record vote of  240-181 on the same bill, the House voted to deny U.S. foreign assistance dollars to non-governmental groups that perform or provide abortions, or that lobby other nations to repeal their laws restricting abortion.  The same measure would also require the United Nations Population Fund to end its involvement in China's draconian family planning program -- or lose all U.S. funds.  H.R. 1561 should pass the House as is, and the Senate should agree.
<p>
<b>4. Adopt Adoption Assistance.</b> In an effort to encourage adoption by lowering financial obstacles, the House of Representatives has passed a budget provision which allows taxpayers a $5,000 credit for qualified adoption expenses.  The Senate did not include the adoption assistance measure in their budget measure, passed on May 25.  An amendment offered by Sen. Phil Gramm (R-Tex.) that included the credit was defeated on May 23 by vote of 69-31.  The differing budgets now go to a House-Senate conference, and FRC will be working to ensure that the adoption credit survives in the final bill.  Adoption is the <i>option of choice</i> for dealing with crisis pregnancy.
<p>
<b>5. No Abortion Mandate</b>. Rep. Pete Hoekstra (R-Mich.) will introduce legislation to prohibit the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) from requiring hospital ob/gyn residency programs (including religious hospitals) to train or refer medical students to perform abortions, lest they lose accreditation.  At stake are federal  Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement dollars.  Subcommittee chairman Hoekstra also scheduled a June 14  hearing in the House Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee to examine ACGME's coercive policy.
<p>
<a name="education"><center><h3>Empower Parents for Education</h3></center>
<p>
<b>6. Be True to Our Schools.</b> At last, serious efforts are under way to dismantle the U.S. Education Department.  The House budget resolution withdraws funding for the department.  In addition, the House Education Task Force's "Back to the Basics Education Bill" returns authority to the state and local level.  This is a high-priority issue for FRC; action could come in Congress within several months.  The decline in American education parallels the rise of the Department of Education; it's time to test the linkage in reverse.
<p>
<b>7. Be True II.</b> The House has taken one small swipe at Goals 2000, the omnibus education legislation that transferred unprecedented education authority from localities to Washington, D.C.  Last month, the House passed H.R. 1045, which would eliminate NESIC, the equivalent of a national school board set up by the law.  Congress should now repeal <i>all</i> of the intrusive programs instituted by Goals 2000.  Kudos to Rep. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), who has raised the issue in the House Economic and Educational Opportunities Committee, and to Gov. George Allen of Virginia, who has refused to accept Goals 2000 funding for his state.  We have to free our children from the control of the national education bureaucrats and their allies at the National Education Association.
<p>
<a name="purse"><center><h3>Protect the Family Purse</h3></center>
<p>
<b>8. Pro-child Tax Credits.</b> The $500-per-child tax credit helps relieve the tax burden on American families.  The House of Representatives has passed a tax bill that includes the $500-per-child credit and has also included it in its budget resolution.  Unfortunately, the credit's fate in the Senate is uncertain:  key Republican senators are raising doubts about the bill, and the Senate budget resolution passed on May 25 omitted it.  The Senate should change course and act to protect the family budget as it works to fix the federal budget.
<p>
<b>9. Don't Forget Health Reform.</b> Rep. Bill Archer (R-Tex.) has drafted legislation, not yet introduced, to change the income tax code to permit individual Medical Savings Accounts (MSAs).  These MSAs would give individuals and families greater control over their health care decisions, resulting in your family having coverage even if you change jobs, decreased costs, and broadened access to health care services.  FRC has joined a coalition of pro-family groups to promote such legislation.  The effort in 1994 to turn over health care to the government -- socialized medicine -- was defeated.  Sound reform is more critical now than ever.
<p>
<a name="wilderness"><center><h3>Tame the Cultural Wilderness</h3></center>
<p>
<b>10. Ban Homosexuality in Uniform.</b> Most Americans thought the military homosexual issue was resolved when Congress passed a reform bill in 1993.  Wrong.  The Clinton administration ignored the text of the law when it wrote the implementing regulations, effectively lifting the ban anyway.  Now the administration is using the federal courts to get around public opinion and scuttle the ban by building a losing case in the Supreme Court.  New legislation is imperative.  None is pending, but FRC's Military Readiness Project, with senior advisers former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Thomas Moorer and former Marine Corps Commandant Robert Barrow, is seeking Congressional support for appropriate amendments to the 1996 Defense Authorization Act.
<p>
<b>11. Porn-Free Cable TV.</b> With the encouragement of FRC, Reps. Tony Hall (D-Ohio) and Chris Smith (R-N.J.) have introduced legislation that would require cable TV operators to provide basic cable packages free of pornography.  Meanwhile, pro-family groups are working on alternatives to Sen. Jim Exon's (D-Neb.) Communications Decency Act of 1995, S. 314.   Exon's bill is a well-intentioned attempt to restrict transmission of pornography via computer, but may actually make it more difficult to prosecute.
<p>
<b>12. Porn-Free PXs</b>. Under current policy, military exchange managers are responsible to select magazines based on sales volume, customer preferences, and, in the case of pornographic material, whether or not it fits the definition of "obscenity" outlined in the 1973 Supreme Court case of <i>Miller v. California</i>.  The services oppose removing so-called "soft-core" pornography from exchange shelves because of the threat of legal action from the ACLU.  President Clinton has the unilateral authority to remove pornographic material from military stores.  He should do so, and Congress should adopt a resolution urging that action upon him.
<p>
<a name="misguided"><center><h3>Reform Misguided Federal Programs</h3></center>
<p>
<b>13. True Welfare Reform.</b> The full Senate should vote on a measure to restore the anti-illegitimacy provisions that were adopted by the House but then eliminated by the Senate Finance Committee on May 25.  The critical provisions are:  a restriction on federally funded cash benefits for adolescent unwed mothers; a "cap" on benefits  to mothers who bear additional children while on welfare; and bonus payments to states that succeed in reducing their illegitimacy rates without increasing the number of abortions.
<p>
<b>14. X Out Title X.</b> Title X of the Public Health Service Act -- a program which funds family planning projects throughout the country -- has been a dismal failure, especially among teenagers.  Since it began in 1970, out-of-wedlock births, pregnancies, and abortions among teenagers have all risen sharply.  Sexually transmitted diseases have multiplied in variety and are on the rebound as well.  Last year, Title X received $194 million in your tax money.  This summer, FRC will work to change that figure to zero.  Planned Parenthood will be poorer, but adolescent well-being should flourish.
<p>
<b>15. Cures, Not Activism.</b> Federal taxpayers spend billions on AIDS through the Ryan White Care Act. Unfortunately, much money now goes to groups promoting homosexuality to school-children through "AIDS education." The Act is the single largest source of funds for homosexual activism. A Washington, D.C., recipient, the Whitman-Walker Clinic, endorses "safe" bathhouse sex (with condoms) and holds gay political seminars. Basic reform is needed.
<p>
<a name="ideas"><center><h3>Other Family-Friendly Ideas</h3></center>
<p>
<b>16. Women at Arms.</b> The Clinton administration has conducted an aggressive campaign to thrust women into military combat.  Women can now be assigned to more than 80 percent of all military positions -- many combat-related.  Meanwhile, Congress has failed to host hearings to examine the recommendations of the 1992 Presidential Commission on the Assignment of Women in the Armed Forces, which opposed many of the recent changes.  The administration, with Congressional neglect, has advanced a feminist agenda without regard for readiness.  Congress should convene hearings and prepare legislation that puts readiness first.  If they don't, someday soon your daughter could be drafted.
<p>
<b>17. Off the Dole.</b> The Integrity in Government Act (H.R. 1130), sponsored by Rep. Bob Dornan (R-Cal.), would limit federally funded persons or organizations, such as contractors and advocacy groups, from lobbying Congress for more funding.  It would also prohibit lobbyists from receiving federal funds.  The legislation would not apply to recipients of entitlements and would not restrict the ability of individual citizens to communicate with their elected representatives.
<p>
<b>18. Revitalize Drug Abuse Prevention.</b> Drug abuse among teenagers has increased significantly in recent years.  This change is attributable to a resurgence of pro-drug sentiment in popular culture, less-than-effective prevention programs, and President Clinton's silence on the issue.  The administration's drug strategy focuses on "harm reduction" -- treatment for chronic drug users and less enforcement.  Meanwhile, Congress is considering cuts in drug prevention programs.  Any long-term solution requires parental involvement, community programs, and strong national leadership.  New legislation is needed to address this plague. 
<p>
<b>19. Liberate the Arts.</b> The House passed a budget resolution (H. Con. Res. 67) on May 18, providing no funds for the National Endowment for the Arts or the National Endowment for the Humanities.  The resolution also ends funding for public television after three years.  A separate bill (H.R. 1557), passed by a House committee on May 10, would phase out the endowments by 1999.  Meanwhile, several senators have introduced S. 856, a bill that would keep the NEA alive.  FRC and other pro-family forces favor total defunding.  Artists need their freedom -- and so do taxpayers.
<p>
<b>20. Restore Religious Rights.</b> Rep. Ernest Istook (R-Okla.) is heading a congressional coalition in drafting an amendment to the U.S. Constitution which would restore to individuals and groups the right to speak and express their religious beliefs.  The language of the amendment is not yet final, but it is expected to include provisions preventing the government from prohibiting prayer or other forms of religious expression wherever non-religious expression is permitted.  The amendment is also likely to ban discrimination against or denying benefits to groups on account of their religious identity or ideas.  No more second-class status for this First Amendment freedom.
<p>
<b>21. Restore Parental Rights.</b> Sen. Charles Grassley (R-Iowa) and Rep. Steve Largent (R-Okla.) are working on legislation to prohibit the government from interfering with the right of parents to direct the upbringing and education of their children.  Such a law would, for instance, support parents who want to opt their children out of offensive sex education programs.  State constitutional amendments to protect parental rights have also been introduced in over half of the states.  Public policy cannot put families first if it does not empower parents.
<p>
<b>22. Defund Anti-Family Legal Activism.</b> Pro-family groups are calling for defunding of the Legal Services Corporation.  The $415 million per year program purports to provide legal services to the poor but often engages in politically motivated legal assaults on the family.  Since 1974, taxpayers have given LSC $5 billion, some of it used for things like obtaining cable TV for prisoners, fighting welfare reform, seeking public abortion funding, and forcing states to fund sex-change operations.

<a name="meaning"><center><h3>The Meaning of Family</h3></center>
<p>
On the grounds of the U.S. Capitol there is a small cluster of crab apple trees, one of the most moving monuments in all of Washington.  The cluster was planted on June 12, 1952 in memory of the Sullivan brothers, five sons of Iowa who died in 1942 during an attack upon the <i>U.S.S. Juneau</i> in the Solomon Islands.
<p>
After this devastating tragedy, the U.S. Navy changed its policy allowing service by family members on the same vessel.  Never again would a single American family lay, simultaneously, so "costly a sacrifice on the altar of freedom." (A. Lincoln)
<p>
In 1942 the contributions of American families -- the meaning of <i>family</i> -- to our nation's well-being and survival were never in question.  Today, as the accompanying <i>Blueprint</i> shows, our nation is at grave risk of forgetting all that the courage and faithfulness of families have given this land.
<p>
As Americans commemorate the family during this month of June -- from  
celebrations honoring the 50th anniversary of the end of World War II, to Father's Day -- Congress could give the nation no greater gift than to make pro-family legislation a priority.
<p>

<p><hr size=5 noshade><p>
<a name="un"><h2><i>UN:  Bound for Beijing</i></h2></center>
<p>
<font size=+3>F</font>rom Sept. 4-15, 1995, the United Nations (UN) will hold
its Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing, China.  The United
States will be sending a delegation to the conference -- despite
the objections of pro-familiy advocates.  First Lady Hillary Clinton
was originally slated to attend, but at latest word will not,
due to China's imprisonment of American human rights activist
Harry Wu.
<p>
<center><h3>Bracketing the Family</h3></center>
<p>
This conference purports to advance women's rights.  However,
many pro-family groups, including FRC, oppose the Beijing conference
agenda for the very reason that it denigrates women and families,
reflecting a radical feminist agenda.  For, not only is the conference
being hosted by a country with a long track record of abusing
women (e.g., female infanticide, coercive abortion policies),
but the platform document:
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>
<center><i><font size=+2>"<font size=+3>M</font>OTHER" IS BRACKETED<br>
FOR REPLACEMENT.</font></i></center>
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>
<b>Denigrates motherhood and traditional family life.</b> For example,
the word &quot;mother&quot; has been bracketed throughout the
entire platform so that it might be changed to the term &quot;caretaker.&quot;
 Similarly, the word &quot;family&quot; has been bracketed for
change to &quot;household.&quot;  Bracketed sections indicate
that delegates could not agree in advance on the text.  These
sections are to be debated in Beijing.  In addition, the word
&quot;family&quot; almost always appears in a negative context,
i.e., in relation to domestic violence or female oppression.
<p>
<b>Devalues the husband-wife relationship to a mere power play.</b>
  Consider paragraph 198 of the platform:  &quot;Inequality in
the public arena can often start within the family when power
relations between men and women are unbalanced with discriminatory
attitudes and practices within the family.  The unequal division
of labour and responsibilities within households based on unequal
power relations also limits women's potential...&quot;  Thus,
rather than acknowledging marriage as a cooperative partnership,
the platform pits one mate against the other.  Notably, the words
&quot;wife&quot; and &quot;husband&quot; are never used.
<p>
<b>Leaves the term &quot;gender&quot; open for interpretation.</b>
 &quot;Gender&quot; appears more than 200 times in the platform
document.  But when asked to define the term, the UN rejected
the suggestion that there are two genders: &quot;male&quot; and
&quot;female.&quot;  The UN also rejected the definition of &quot;gender&quot;
as &quot;the socially-constructed roles which society assigns
to men and women.&quot;  In feminist literature, this definition
means that gender is subject to change and there exists a spectrum
of genders, perhaps even five (e.g., male heterosexual, female
heterosexual, homosexual, bisexual, and transsexual).  Instead,
the UN decided that &quot;gender&quot; was to be understood &quot;in
its commonly accepted meaning.&quot;  The definition battle will
be a major focus in Beijing.
<p>
<b>Undermines parental authority in reproductive health decisions.</b>
 The platform repeatedly states that governments should &quot;emphasize
the role and responsibility of adolescents in sexual and reproductive
behavior through the provision of appropriate services and counseling[.]&quot;
 While occasionally mentioning the legal responsibility of parents
for their children, the platform refuses to recognize parental
authority regarding their children's reproductive health.
<p>
<b>Promotes abortion and contraception as reproductive &quot;rights.&quot;</b>
  In the tradition of previous UN conferences in Cairo and Copenhagen,
the Beijing platform urges governments to &quot;take action to
ensure that women's sexual and reproductive rights are fully recognized
and respected&quot; (paragraph 232).  In fact, the platform elevates
reproductive &quot;rights&quot; above all other rights, stating
that &quot;the ability of women to control their own fertility
forms an important basis for their enjoyment of other rights&quot;
(paragraph 98).
<p>
<center><h3>What You Can Do</h3></center>
<p>
Contact your representative and senators, either in Washington
or at their in-state office.  Tell them to speak out against the
Beijing conference, publicizing its violations of women's fundamental
dignity.

<h3>On The Hill</h3>
<p><a name="issues">
<b>The House Holds.</b> Before adjourning for its August vacation, the
House of Representatives passed two amendments to curb U.S. promotion
of abortion overseas.  Rep. Chris Smith (R-N.J.) led the fight
to prevent U.S. funding of groups that seek to overturn the anti-abortion
laws of sovereign nations.  The Smith amendments would also deny
U.S. aid to the UN Population Fund (UNFPA) if it continues to
participate in China's coercive population control program.  Sen.
Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) intends to offer the same amendment to S.
908, the State Department authorization bill.
<p>
<b>Pro-Family Sendoff.</b> U.S. delegates to the Beijing Women's Conference
received pro-family instructions from the Senate on August 1.
 Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-Tex.) offered an amendment which
called on the U.S. delegation to promote a representative perspective
on the value of motherhood and the traditional family.  The amendment
also urged the delegates to define &quot;gender&quot; classically,
as in &quot;male and female, the two sexes of the human being.&quot;
 Pro-family delegates and observers participating in pre-conference
negotiations at the UN headquarters in New York were energized
by passage of the resolution.
<p>
<b>Pop Aid Bust.</b> The foreign aid bill passed by the House in July
will make it more difficult for the Clinton Administration to
carry out its population control agenda.  The &quot;development
assistance&quot; account, which has traditionally provided hundreds
of millions of dollars each year for international population
projects, was substantially reduced and a separate account was
dedicated to child survival and disease prevention efforts.  Pro-family
forces will now try to persuade the Senate to go along with the
reduced anti-population money.

<center><h3>The United Nations at Half-Century: A Primer</h3></center>
<p>
<font size=+2>T</font>he messages of congratulation poured in from all over the
world.   President Truman thanked Almighty God for bringing the
world community so far in its search for peace.  South African
Prime Minister Jan Christian Smuts called its Charter &quot;not
a perfect document, by any means . . . But at least it is a good,
practical, workmanlike plan for peace.&quot;  As he presided over
the final vote to create the United Nations, taken on June 25,
1945, Britain's Lord Halifax expressed the hope that the delegates
had taken part &quot;in one of the great moments of history.&quot;
<p>
To carry out its charter, the United Nations has, over time,
created an alphabet soup of commissions and agencies.  Some of
these entities have social and economic missions; others have
military missions.  Recently, peacekeeping activities by UN agencies
in such trouble spots as Somalia (UNISOM), Haiti (UNMIH) and the
former Yugoslavia (UNPROFOR) have raised serious questions about
the world body's effectiveness and its proper role.  
<p>
The UN has grown with the decolonization of major European
powers and the breakup of the Soviet empire. The major bodies
of the UN have different functions. The UN's annual budget is
$4 billion. The U.S. contribution, according to our Mission to
the UN, is between $1 billion and $1.5 billion.  UN documents
are printed  in the five official languages: English, French,
Spanish, Chinese and Russian.   Unless otherwise indicated, the
UN body described below is headquartered in New York.
<p>
<b>The General Assembly.</b>  The largest UN body, the General Assembly
is comprised of 185 member states.  Each member has one vote in
the General Assembly.  The General Assembly has authorized many
of the key UN agencies which have a direct impact on families.
 These include the UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD),
the UN Fund for Population Activities (UNFPA), the United Nations
Children's Fund (UNICEF), and the UN Development Fund for Women
(UNIFEM).
<p>
<b>The Secretariat.</b> This body is headed by the Secretary-General,
who reports to the General Assembly.  He supervises executive
functions of the UN.  The Secretary-General has traditionally
been selected from the ranks of the &quot;non-aligned&quot; nations.
 Boutros Boutros-Ghali (Egypt) currently serves in the post.
<p>
<b>The Security Council.</b>  The Security Council consists of 15
members.  Five of these -- Russia, China, the U.S., Britain and
France -- have veto powers over council actions.  The Council
is charged with responding to threats to peace.
<p>
<b>The Economic and Social Council.</b>  The 54 members of this
body are elected to terms by the General Assembly.  It is responsible
for UN efforts in the economic and social areas.  It includes
many specialized agencies.  Among them are the Food and Agriculture
Organization (FAO, Rome), the World Health Organization (WHO,
Geneva), the International Labor Organization (ILO, Geneva), the
very influential International Monetary Fund (IMF, Washington),
the newly created World Trade Organization (WTO), and the United
Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO,
Paris). 
<p>
<b>The International Court of Justice (World Court, The Hague,
Netherlands).</b> The 15 judges are elected to nine-year terms by
the General Assembly and the Security Council.  Questions are
decided by majority vote.  All members of the UN are members of
the World Court, as are non-members Switzerland, San Marino and
Liechtenstein.

<p><a name="convention">
<font size=+3><i>The</i></font> United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child
(UNCRC) was approved by the UN General Assembly on Nov. 20, 1989.
 It was in force on Sept. 2, 1990 after the 20th nation ratified
it.
<p>
The United States Ambassador to the United Nations, Madeleine
Albright, signed the treaty on Feb. 16, 1995.  President Clinton
has said that the U.S. will spell out its interpretation of the
Convention with a statement of  &quot;reservations and understandings&quot;
that will go to the Senate.
<p>
A treaty becomes law in this country if the U.S. Senate ratifies
it by a two-thirds vote (67 Senators, if all are present).  This
has not yet happened and seems unlikely because Sen. Jesse Helms
(R-N.C.), a strong opponent of the Convention, is chairman of
the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which must review it.
<p>
In fact, on June 14, Helms introduced S. R. 133.  This resolution
expresses the sense of the Senate that &quot;the primary safeguard
for the well-being and protection of children is the family, and
that, because the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the
Child could undermine the rights of the family, the President
should not sign and transmit it to the Senate.&quot;  Twenty-three
Senators are cosponsors.
<p>
As an international treaty, the UNCRC would be co-equal with
federal statutes, and possibly the United States Constitution.
 If the United States were to ratify the treaty as it stands,
it would become not only an international obligation, but also
a domestic obligation potentially regulating the most intimate
details of American family life. 
<p>
Several articles in the Convention grant children new rights
independent of their parents and families.  In the U.S. today,
children's rights are, in effect, held in trust by their parents.
 Under the Convention, children would hold those rights themselves.
 Conceivably, taking a child to church, when he would rather not
go, could be a violation of the child's right to freedom of religion
(Article 14); telling a child to turn off the television could
violate the child's right &quot;to seek, receive, and impart information&quot;
(Article 13), and so forth. 
<p>
The Convention on the Rights of the Child is a risk America's
families do not need -- and cannot afford -- to take.
<p><hr><p>
<a name="march"><center><h3>The UN and the Family: Major Documents</h3></center>
<p>
<font size=+2>T</font>he United Nations was founded in the shadow of the Second
World War, a renewed attempt by the victorious democracies to
establish an international body to safeguard the peace and promote
human rights.  From the beginning, with the drafting of the UN
Charter and related documents such as the Universal Declaration
of Human Rights, the UN has attempted to give voice to the common
aspirations of the world's people.  Only within the past two decades
has the UN expanded its agenda in ways that pose direct threats
to the traditional family.
<p>
Here are some major landmarks in the history of UN advocacy
regarding marriage and the family:
<p>
<b>Universal Declaration of Human Rights.</b> Article 16 asserts
the right &quot;to marry and to found a family,&quot; provides
that marriage must be entered into &quot;freely&quot; by the spouses,
and defines the family &quot;as the natural and fundamental group
unit of society . . . entitled to protection by society and the
state.&quot;  The Declaration was adopted by the UN General Assembly
in 1948.
<p>
<b>International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.</b>
 The Covenant, which is in treaty form, promotes special measures
to protect the family, mothers, and children.  Article 10 repeats
the definition of family in the <b>Universal Declaration</b> and calls
for &quot;the widest possible protection and assistance&quot;
to the family. Addresses such issues as family leave and child
labor.
<p>
<b>International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.</b> Article
23 of the Covenant uses the same definition of family as the <b>Universal
Declaration</b>, and requires nations that have ratified the Covenant
&quot;to ensure equality of rights and responsibilities of spouses
as to marriage[.]&quot;
<p>
<b>Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination
Against Women.</b> Article 12 introduces language requiring nations
to ensure access to health care, including family planning.  Like
the <b>Universal Declaration</b>, it speaks clearly of &quot;men&quot;
and &quot;women&quot; in these contexts.  Article 16 enumerates
eight specific rights as regards marriage, with emphasis on equality
of rights regarding children and property and the &quot;right
to decide freely and responsibly on the number and spacing of
their children[.]&quot; The United States has not ratified this
Convention.
<p>
<b>International Year of the Family (IYF).</b> First proposed in
1987, the year was actually celebrated in 1994.  In the best modern
UN mode, Secretary General Boutros-Ghali announced that &quot;[t]here
is no single definition of a family.  There is no one model.&quot;
 An IYF document, &quot;The Changing Family Structure,&quot; lumped
together everything from &quot;polygamous&quot; and &quot;community&quot;
families to &quot;biological&quot; and &quot;adoptive&quot; families.
 &quot;Same-sex&quot; families also get equal footing in the document.
<p><hr width=65%><p>
<h3><center>NGO: FRC and the UN</center></h3>
<p>
&quot;NGO&quot; is one of the most commonly heard terms in
UN-speak.  It stands for &quot;Non-Governmental Organization,&quot;
and refers to private associations specifically recognized and
consulted by the United Nations.  Examples include the International
Red Cross, Amnesty International, Greenpeace, and Planned Parenthood.
 NGOs are first mentioned in the UN Charter of 1945 as important
resources for the General Assembly and the various commissions
it creates to address specific issues.
<p>
NGOs may be international or merely national in scope.  Their
number is large (some 1,500) and growing.  The presence of UN
Headquarters in New York City has given New York-based NGOs a
considerable advantage in lobbying the UN on a daily basis.  Some
NGOs, like WEDO, led by former Congresswoman Bella Abzug and a
major participant in UN conferences on population and the environment,
are almost fully funded by foundation money.  Others are grassroots-oriented.
<p>
NGO status can be permanent or temporary, allowing a group
access to the UN generally or merely to specific conferences.
 The Family Research Council was granted NGO status for the world
population conference in Copenhagen, Denmark, in 1994.  FRC has
also obtained NGO status for Beijing (<i>see earlier article</i>).  This status
does not allow FRC to vote on the Beijing Plan, but it <i>will</i> make
us more effective eyes and ears for the American family.

<center><b><font size=+2><i>What So Proudly We Hail?</i></font></b><br>
by Gary L. Bauer</center>
<p>
Americans have historically sacrificed for peace. We went
to war twice in this century for the peace and freedom of Europe.
 Americans fought and died defending the independence of Korea,
Vietnam, Grenada, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.  Most recently, Americans
have shouldered the burden of famine relief in strife-torn Somalia.
The American people and their government respond generously to
natural disasters. 
<p>
America has taken a leading role in supporting the United
Nations, too.  From 1945 on, the U.S. provided the greater part
of UN funding and support.  President Kennedy defended the world
organization when the Soviets tried to hamstring it with a three-man
troika in place of its single Secretary-General.  That formula
would have guaranteed paralysis -- which is what the Soviets really
wanted.
<p>
Despite this record, the UN has often been a three-ring circus
of anti-Americanism.  The U.S. has regularly been denounced as
&quot;imperialist&quot; and a &quot;war monger&quot; during what
passed for UN debates.  Efforts to empower the nations of the
&quot;South&quot; by levying confiscatory assessments on the free
industrial democracies of the &quot;North&quot; have been popular
among all too many members of the General Assembly.  Third World
delegates have cheered the so-called New World Information Order,
which is nothing more than a dignified name for press muzzling
by tinpot despots. 
<p>
Still, Americans have remained largely willing to tolerate
the UN as an important forum for international discussion.  For
the sake of peace, we have gone the extra mile.  Recent stories
about UN diplomats who have run up thousands of parking violations
in New York City and who have stiffed the Big Apple's merchants
to the tune of millions have struck nerves, however.  No warm
and fuzzy talk of &quot;cultural disparities&quot; should cover
the obvious truth:  a ripoff is a ripoff.
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>
<center><i><font size=+3>UN E</font><font size=+2>XPANSION</font> 
 <font size=+3>T</font><font size=+2>HREATENS</font><br>
<font size=+3>U.S. S</font><font size=+2>OVEREIGNTY</font></i></center>
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>
This corruption is far less troubling than the new trend
toward building an army of &quot;blue helmets&quot; to police
the world.  UN Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali has moved
aggressively since the collapse of the Soviet Union to assert
a new doctrine of sovereignty. <i>Sovereignty</i>. That's a key word
and concept.  Americans recognize it better by referring to our
founding document, the Declaration of Independence.  That document
set forth our right to stand &quot;among the powers of the earth&quot;
as a free and equal nation.
<p>
The Secretary General's expansive view of UN authority is
not just an opinion.  The UN fielded only two peacekeeping missions
in its first five years, but it has dispatched the blue helmet
19 times in the past four years.  Many have greater ambitions
still.  Former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, a communist, is
pushing a worldwide environmental initiative which sees a major
role for the UN.  Former French President Francois Mitterand,
a socialist, advocates the creation of a &quot;UN Legion&quot;
to give military teeth to the UN's resolutions. 
<p>
Veteran liberal Ronnie Dugger would go even further.  He
writes in <i>The New York Times</i> that if the member states are unwilling
or unable to man a UN Legion, the UN should accept volunteers
from the recognized Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs).  These
private groups are playing an increasing role in UN activities.
 The <i>Rainbow Warrior</i>, the Greenpeace ship that has confronted
whalers and nuclear test personnel, might be the first of a whole
fleet under the Dugger plan.
<p>
All of these suggestions come at a time of growing UN military
focus.  The UN Department of Peacekeeping has expanded from a
staff of 23 to more than 350 today, with a modern &quot;situation
center,&quot; staffed 24 hours a day.  What are the limits to
this mushrooming role?
<p>
As we watch the UN's Beijing Conference on Women, we should
each ask ourselves:  what if an army had the power to enforce
the resolutions passed by these delegates?  Would Americans remain
free and independent? I once considered such questions idle speculation.
 Not anymore.

<title>Gary Bauer's January, 1997 Letter</title>

<body>

<center><h2>A Message From Gary L. Bauer</h2></center>

<p><hr width=75% height=2><p>

January 3, 1997

<p>

Dear Friend,

<p>

On January 22, our nation will mark the 24th anniversary of the
Supreme Court decisions that elevated a choice for death to the
level of national policy.  In <I>Roe v. Wade</I> and its companion
case, <I>Doe v. Bolton</I>, seven men dressed in black robes delivered
a cruel blow that continues to reverberate throughout our land.
Those seven Justices, arrogant and unelected, elevated abortion
on demand to a status of grand Constitutional privilege.  The
chilling effects of their ruling have not stopped even to this
day, as a culture of death continues to descend across this good
and decent land.

<p>

Just how deeply a nation can sink into a depraved indifference
to human life was vividly illustrated recently in Delaware.  There,
prosecutors charge, two unwed college students -- Brian Peterson,
Jr. and Amy Grossberg -- entered a hotel for the express purpose
of giving birth to their firstborn son.  What happened next, prosecutors
say, is horrible to contemplate.  On a cold November night, the
child was placed in a plastic bag and dropped outside in the hotel
dumpster, where maintenance workers later found his body.  The
dead baby had a fractured skull and other injuries that the coroner
attributes to blunt-force head trauma and shaking.

<p>

Reaction to this case has been extraordinary.  Many columnists
have noted the fact that Brian Peterson and Amy Grossberg are
among those society would call its &quot;fortunate souls.&quot;
They come from well-to-do families; they have had the best of
everything.  As the <I>New York Times</I> reported it, they &quot;grew
up where many teenagers have their own cars and secure futures,
where gardeners tend landscaped lawns and shrubs[.]&quot;[1] They
do not live in some remote, forsaken corner of the world, or in
a culture where out-of-wedlock childbearing is rare or scorned.
They come from prosperous families in a populous state (New Jersey),
at a time when unwed pregnancy is so common that, apparently,
no one at Amy Grossberg's college even discussed with her the
fact that she was clearly on the verge of childbirth.

<p>

These young people are entitled to the legal presumption of innocence,
of course, so we will withhold our judgment about what happened
in that hotel room.  But we don't have to wait to react to what
is being said about their case by the swarms of psychologists
and lawyers now descending on Delaware.  Getting at the truth
seems far down on the list of priorities for these apologists.
One commentator regretted that Peterson and Grossberg had not
gone to New Jersey's local Planned Parenthood, where their problem
could have been averted by the nation's largest abortion provider.
New Jersey Gov. Christine Todd Whitman, who has led the fight
to remove the pro-life plank from the Republican platform, talked
vaguely about the couple's failure to consider adoption and &quot;other
options.&quot;  Charles Oberly, Amy Grossberg's attorney, with
no hint that he was merely trying to shift the blame to Peterson,
told <I>The New York Times</I> that &quot;[t]here is a serious
question whether this woman did anything criminal.&quot;[2]

<p>

Now, it may be true that both of these privileged young adults
are &quot;all-American kids.&quot;  It may be, as their lawyer
claims, that they were panic-stricken and irrational to the point
of insanity in that hotel room.  But it might also be the case
that they engaged in an act of calculated rationality.  Columnist
George Will put his finger on this exactly when he pointed out
how, under only slightly different circumstances, Peterson and
Grossberg could have found themselves visiting the White House
for a veto ceremony instead of standing before a grand jury in
Delaware. &quot;Don't young people read newspapers?&quot; he
wrote. &quot;Don't they know that, thanks to President Clinton,
they could have <I>chosen</I> to have a doctor suck their baby's
brains out, and Delaware would not have <I>chosen</I> to charge
them with murder?&quot;[3]

<p>

In the world in which we now live, it is surely possible that
two 18-year-olds could not see the logical and rational difference
between dropping their baby boy into a dumpster and dropping by
the New Jersey clinic that has performed 1,500 partial-birth abortions
in a single year.  And if there is no rational difference between
these two actions, why then would society insist on punishment
for the one deed and presidential praise for the right to do the
other?

<p>

This is where the abortion culture has led us in January 1997.
On the 8th of this month, the Supreme Court of the United States
will hear a case that will determine whether or not there is an
individual constitutional right to commit suicide with the aid
of another.  Lawyers for our side, including FRC's own Cathy Cleaver,
have argued strenuously in legal briefs to the court not only
that no such right exists, but that to invent it would be to open
the floodgates to the wholesale &quot;termination&quot; of the
elderly and severely handicapped.  We have many allies on this
issue -- and compelling arguments -- but at this writing we are
keenly aware that the odds are against us: the Supreme Court is
radically liberal on social issues, and both federal appeals courts
in this case have held that the states may not restrict assisted
suicide.

<p>

In Michigan, Jack Kevorkian has claimed at least 45 victims. 
This pathological ex-pathologist, whose obsession with death includes
painting pictures that feature Nazi images and human cannibalism,
has so far evaded the condemnation of jurors.  The media depicts
him as a hero and trail-blazer.  He depicts himself as a latter-day
Thomas Jefferson, while conveniently forgetting all the while
the words of Jefferson, who said that &quot;[t]he care of human
life and happiness, and not their destruction, is the sole legitimate
object of good government.&quot;

<p>

How then can we restore respect for the sanctity of human life?
The Family Research Council is determined to do its part.  We
will continue to battle in the courts, as we have done in opposing
assisted suicide and defending the right of pro-life sidewalk
counselors to offer aid to those entering abortion clinics.[4] We
will continue to address our case to the Congress, urging the
adoption of legislation to ban partial-birth abortions and to
provide legal protection for human life from conception until
natural death.  And we will keep the pressure on Bill Clinton
and Al Gore to reverse their pro-abortion policies.  As long as
we have breath in us to speak, we will remind those in office
of their sacred duty to defend the weak and the helpless.

<p>

We will also continue to conduct research and to publish analysis,
both legal and social, of the key issues under debate.  This month,
we are releasing two more contributions to this effort.  Gracie
Hsu and Robert G. Morrison of my staff have joined with me in
preparing a comprehensive statement on the sanctity of human life.
We approached this task humbly, knowing that many great writers
and thinkers have addressed this subject more powerfully than
we ever could.  Still, we believe that Americans need a constant
recalling to the faith and vision of our founders and to the lessons
of our Judeo-Christian heritage.

<p>

It has been said over and over again that the abortion industry
is the most unregulated commercial enterprise in American history.
When a New Jersey newspaper revealed, as noted above, that a
clinic there had performed 1,500 partial-birth abortions in a
single year, it reported a startling fact that no power in state
government knew or wanted to know.  The information currently
being gathered about the number of abortions performed in America
and the harm these abortions do to women is woefully inadequate.
You can use the enclosed reply card to obtain a copy of FRC's
Special Report, <I>A Woman's Right (Not) to Know</I>, by Virginia
Delegate Robert G. Marshall.

<p>

January, of course, also marks the birthday of the Rev. Martin
Luther King, Jr.  His speech at the Lincoln Memorial still resonates
throughout every corner of this land, too, because he invoked
the &quot;unalienable rights&quot; to life, liberty and happiness
that belong to all people not by virtue of their skin color or
utility, but by virtue of their humanity.  That humanity is holy
because it reflects the image and likeness of our Creator, a Creator
who loves us &quot;irrationally&quot; -- not according to our
merits or usefulness to Him -- but because he has <I>chosen</I>
to love us.

<p>

How like that love the noblest human love is.  I think of the
woman in our area of Virginia a few years back, who came home
to find her family's trailer ablaze.  Knowing that her two children
were inside, she rushed into the inferno to save them.  A firefighter
who tried to restrain her said that she was on fire the moment
she passed through the trailer door.  Her body was found outside
the room where the bodies of her two sons lay. <I>Irrational love.</I>

<p>

Or the heartrending footnote to that searing story of the young
boy in the Chicago housing project who was thrown to his death
from an upper floor by two 12-year-olds because he refused to
steal candy for them.  That act of gross disrespect for human
life was matched by the impossible act of love displayed by the
dead boy's 5-year-old brother, who raced down the stairs of the
high rise immediately after the incident.  Asked by a counselor
what was going through his mind, the little boy said he had hoped
to catch his brother before he hit the ground.  <I>Irrational
love.</I>

<p>

Or, finally, the young police officer in Tennessee, struck by
a bullet in the line of duty, who lay in a &quot;persistent vegetative
state.&quot;  (That's an awful term for a physical condition that
none of us can fully comprehend.)  One day, after several years
of this coma-like condition, the officer awoke for a brief time,
recognized his children, and spoke to them.  His brother rushed
to the hospital to be with him.  When the press asked the brother
what his reaction was to so many years of waiting and worrying,
he said that it was worth it all just to be able to tell his brother
that he loved him, and to be understood.

<p>

My friends, these are acts of irrational love -- performed out
of profound, reflexive respect for the sanctity of human life.
All around us in 1997, there are signs that affirm this kind
of love, but unfortunately there are also many other signs that
tell us we have lost our way -- a way of service and sacrifice
on behalf of those who desperately need us.

<p>

In the days to come, let us all pray that our Supreme Court, our
Congress and our President will recover their sense of direction
and help this nation, once again, become a beacon to the oppressed,
a Shining City on a Hill.

<p>

Sincerely,

<p><br>

Gary L. Bauer<br>
President

<p>

P.S.  As always, your partnership with us is essential to our
success.  We thank God for all you do to make our work possible.
Your generosity and your prayers, your friendship and notes of
encouragement -- these things mean more to me that you will ever
know. I pray that you and your family will enjoy all of God's blessings
in 1997.

<title>Gary Bauer's December, 1996 Letter</title>

<body>

<center><h2>A Message From Gary L. Bauer</h2></center>

<p><hr width=75% height=2><p>

December 6, 1996

<p><br><br>

<ul><ul>

<i>It was a great comfort to feel, all during the
last days when affairs looked doubtful, that no matter how things
came out the really important thing was the lovely life I have
with mother and with you children and that compared to this home
life everything else was of small importance from the stand point
of happiness.

<p><ul><ul>

Theodore Roosevelt<br>
from a letter to his son Kermit<br>
1904</i>

</ul></ul></ul></ul>

<p>

Dear Friend:

<p>

Christmas comes to Washington, D.C., much the
same way it comes to your hometown.  Street lights come on earlier,
stores stay open later, there are smiles on more faces, and bell-ringing
members of the Salvation Army brave the cold and take up their
posts.  Around the city seasonal decorations are hung from every
pillar and post, multi-colored bulbs burn in windows and on trees.
Fervent prayers for safe travel go forth, as we remember Christmases
past and eagerly anticipate the arrival of family members, including
sons and daughters from college or military assignments around
the globe.

<p>

Yes, Christmas comes to Washington as it does
to every other city, but it comes here with a rather peculiar
force.  Partly it's because of the history of our nation's capital,
but even more significantly, I think, it's because of the political
nature of this city.  Throughout most of the year, an air of aggressive
secularity reigns in Washington.  Faith is not absent here, but
it too often takes a backseat to the public business being conducted.
Not so at Christmas-time, however.  As an anonymous writer once
noted about Christmas in Washington, &quot;Officially, the government
of the United States does not celebrate religious holidays.  Unofficially,
of course, it does.&quot;

<p>

That &quot;unofficial&quot; celebration of the
birth of Christ has irresistible power.  The white columns of
government buildings are festooned with wreaths and ribbons.
Christmas trees are lit at both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue.
On the open Ellipse just south of the White House the National
Christmas Tree stands proudly, established by President Calvin
Coolidge and lit every year since 1923.  Each year, thousands
of visitors come to visit the tree and to see the life-sized Nativity
scene that even the Scrooges at the ACLU have been unable to dislodge.

<p>

On one occasion our National Christmas Tree
was nearly darkened -- not by church-and-state lawyers, but by
the nightmare of a nation at war.  On December 7, 1941, Japanese
forces attacked Pearl Harbor.  America entered the war and Nazi
Germany and Fascist Italy declared war upon us.  In those first
days of the conflict blackouts were declared along the East Coast
as American leaders feared the worst.

<p>

In Washington, too, a blackout was ordered.
Our military and the Secret Service compiled a list of actions
they wanted taken to protect the Executive Mansion and the Congress,
including even the repainting of the White House in standard Army
Air Corps camouflage.  President Franklin Roosevelt resisted many
of their recommendations, rightly sensing that they would seriously
depress the indomitable American spirit.  But one security demand
made him bristle the most:  <I>no Christmas Tree on the Ellipse</I>,
the agencies said, <I>it would be too obvious a target</I>.

<p>

But Roosevelt refused to give in, and on Christmas
Eve, 1941, President and Mrs. Roosevelt stood on the south portico
of the White House and threw a switch to light the National Christmas
Tree, as a national radio audience tuned their receivers.  In
the midst of the blackout, the tree provided the only light for
miles around.  Beside the Roosevelts on the portico stood Winston
Churchill, who had traveled secretly to Washington and arrived
only that morning to encourage his American partners.  That night,
the British leader delivered a message that captured the essence
of the symbol Roosevelt was defending in lighting the tree.  Churchill
spoke to (and for) all Americans when he said:

<p><blockquote>

<i>Let the children have their night of laughter . . . Let us
grown-ups share . . . in their unstinted pleasures
before we turn again to the stern tasks and the formidable
years that lie before us, resolved that by our sacrifice
and daring these same children shall not be robbed
of their inheritance or denied their right to live in
a free and decent world.</i>

</blockquote><p>

Today, of course, the clouds of war are not
gathered on every side.  But Churchill's words, and the meaning
of Christmas, retain all of their urgency.  Sacrifice and daring
are still needed in this fight, fought with words of persuasion
and prayers of petition, for the right of our children and our
grandchildren to live in a free and decent world.  If I have any
goal at the Family Research Council, it is to continue to frustrate
the Scrooges and the nay-sayers by keeping the lights burning
brightly on the Christmas trees of family, faith and freedom all
throughout this great land.

<p>

Christmas truly is the feast of childhood.
On this holy day, we mark the event where our God in heaven came
to us as a child, with a message that we must come to Him as children
if we want to see His face.  The words of Teddy Roosevelt that
I quoted at the beginning of this letter offer us another reminder
of the meaning of our work in this life.  Teddy was a remarkable
president, but an excellent book about him called <I>A Bully Father</I>
reminds us of the priorities that ruled his life even in the midst
of political turmoil. Teddy Roosevelt placed his family first,
no matter what the season.

<p>

His ardent devotion to conservation led him
to refuse to place a freshly cut Christmas tree in the White House.
But during his White House years he turned a blind eye when his
sons carried a tree up into the residence and hid it in their
closet.  On Christmas morning, his letters to his children reveal,
he rejoiced in the family custom of gathering in his and Edith's
bedroom as the six children romped and peered into their stockings
and opened their presents.  These events recalled for TR &quot;just
such a Christmas&quot; as he had known in his youth, and it was
&quot;just such a Christmas&quot; he endeavored to reproduce exactly
for his own family.

<p>

This Christmas season, I'm sure your family
has its own traditions to relive, customs you seek to renew time
and time again.  It doesn't really seem to matter what they are:
large or small, children remember and treasure each one.  My prayer
is that you will enjoy each and every moment that you have together.

<p>

For my family, Christmas will be particularly
special this year.  For a short while, life once again will be
exactly as it was ... Carol and me coming down the stairs each
morning to find all of our children under our roof.  Our daughter
Elyse will be home from college after a long semester.  She hasn't
chosen a major yet, but increasingly she feels drawn toward political
science and law.  On campus, she really enjoys her involvement
in the Fellowship of Christian Athletes.  Our high school sophomore,
Sarah, is learning to drive.  In addition to that excitement,
every Tuesday she and a dozen classmates gather at our house at
6:30 in the morning to pray and share their love for God and His
Son Jesus Christ.  Our son, Zachary, just celebrated his 10th
birthday.  He continues to grow in his faith, while he uses his
God-given talents and abilities to play every sport possible.
His soccer season just ended and basketball practice has already
begun.

<p>

Now that I have filled you in on my family,
it occurs to me that we would like to have an update from you, too. 
A few years ago, I asked readers of my monthly letter to send us
a family picture and tell us about their family.  We still treasure
the pictures and letters we received.  With permission, many of
those letters and the incidents they relate have found a place
in one of our publications, like <I>Reunion</I> or <I>Let Freedom
Ring</I>, or in the military exhibit at our new location in 
Washington.

<p>

If you have a moment -- perhaps while you're
sending out your Christmas cards or in the quieter days after
Christmas -- could you send us an updated photograph and tell
us how your family is doing?  If you haven't written before or
are new to my letters, we're all the more anxious to learn something
about you and your family.  Your photos and letters mean a lot
to all of us at FRC.  They remind us, just as Teddy Roosevelt's
letter to Kermit does, why we're here and whom we represent. They
also remind us that our happiness rests on a foundation that no
one can take away.

<p>

Thank you for all you do in partnership with
us to help build and preserve that &quot;free and decent world&quot;
of which Churchill spoke.  Next month, I'll be writing to share
with you the specific policy steps we will be pursuing with the
105th Congress to help achieve that &quot;world&quot; -- steps
to protect the sanctity of human life, to clean up our polluted
culture, to ease the economic pressures on families, and to promote
education reforms that help ensure that every child hears the
kind of historical truths that are recounted in this letter.

<p>

From all of us at FRC to all of yours, both near
and far, we wish you a peaceful and blessed Christmas.  May God
be with you this holiday season and throughout the coming year.

<p>

Sincerely,

<p><br>

Gary L. Bauer<br>
President

<p>

P.S.  End-of-year gifts represent a major portion
of the funds the Family Research Council receives from our supporters.
As you consider the gifts you intend to make this Christmas,
I sincerely hope you will consider FRC worthy of your continued
support.

<title>Gary Bauer's August, 1996 Letter</title>

<body>

<center><h2>A Message From Gary L. Bauer</h2></center>

<p><hr width=75% height=2><p>

August 13, 1996

<p><br><br>

<ul><ul>

<i>He giveth power to the faint; and to them that have no might
he giveth strength. Even the youths shall faint, and be weary; and 
the young men shall utterly fall. But they that wait upon the Lord 
shall renew their strength; they shall mount with wings as eagles; 
they shall run, and not be weary; and they shall walk, and not 
faint.</i>

</ul></ul>

<p><center>

<i>- Isaiah 40:29-31</i>

</center><p>

Dear Friend:

<p>

While watching the Olympic games last month, I couldn't help
but recall these poignant words from the prophet Isaiah.  These
verses play a pivotal role in the classic film <I>Chariots of
Fire,</I> the true story of Scottsman, Eric Liddell, an Olympic
runner.  Liddell recites this passage from Scripture at a church
service held on a day he was supposed to run a race in the Paris
Games. <I>Chariots of Fire</I> tells how Liddell, a dedicated
Christian, refused to run on the Sabbath, standing by his personal
conviction in the face of intense pressure from the future King
of England and others.

<p>

Even though my athletic ability won't get me into the Olympics,
I must tell you that these hectic summer months have all of us
at Family Research Council (FRC) running hard.  Time and again,
we are led back to God's promise that He will renew our strength,
that he will enable us to effectively run the race and that His
strength will never fail.  FRC's staff has truly been pressed
to the limit in recent days, and just like Olympic athletes, we
have experienced the thrill of victory and the agony of defeat.
Let me share with you, some of the many hills and hurdles FRC
has encountered.

<p>

This month, the major events requiring our attention are the
conventions of national political parties.  The Republicans met
first in San Diego, followed by the National Taxpayer's Party,
Ross Perot's Reform Party, and finally the Democrats.  The Libertarian
Party has already nominated its presidential candidate.  As a
non-partisan organization, FRC continues to focus its energies
on providing each of these parties with a detailed agenda for
families. As I reported to you last month, FRC has advocated
the pro-family agenda in a wide variety of public forums and we
will continue to do so regardless of  the response we receive
from party leaders and the media elite.

<p>

As you read this, chances are I'll be returning to Washington
after having taken the pro-family message to the GOP Convention
in San Diego.  We have urged each of the nation's political parties
to make America's families a priority.  We want Democrats, Republicans,
and the smaller &quot;third parties&quot; alike, to see &quot;family&quot;
<b><i>not</i></b> in terms of election cycles, but in terms of daily
responsibilities and everyday needs.  We have urged them all to
adopt platforms that strengthen marriage, recognize the sanctity
of human life, cut taxes for families, and to pay increased attention
to the cultural decay undermining our society.

<p>

In San Diego, I addressed a rally at Sea World designed to urge
the GOP to uphold its commitment to the sanctity of life, to lower
taxes on families and to work for economic opportunitiy and growth.
I made our case to convention delegates and to the national media,
who always crowd these events.  In the weeks before the conventions,
my schedule was crammed with appearances on network and cable
talk shows to discuss the issues at stake during this election
year.  Incredibly, FRC was cited more than 1,500 times in the
print media nationwide in June.  Needless to say,  FRC Press Secretary,
Kristi Hamrick and her quality staff are incredibly busy.

<p>

For my part, there was CNN's &quot;Inside Politics&quot; to discuss
the GOP platform plank on abortion, an appearance on &quot;Crossfire&quot;
with former Gov. Carroll Campbell to discuss the presidential
campaign, another visit to the weekly commentary show, &quot;The
Capital Gang,&quot; an interview with Ollie North on his daily
radio show and numerous other media opportunities.

<p>

Meanwhile, on Capitol Hill, FRC has provided in-depth research
and related resource materials to lawmakers who are concerned
about the attack on traditional marriage. Our recent full page ad in
<I>USA Today</I>, which I described in my June letter, was just 
the opening move in our effort to inform citizens
about the potential impact of an expected court decision in Hawaii.
This decision would recognize same-sex marriages and potentially
impose similar recognition on other states.

<p>

To most Americans, I suspect, the reason that one man/one woman
marriage is so vital to the survival of our society almost goes
without saying.  But in these times, people need regular, convincing
reminders about the fundamentals.  That's why FRC recently hosted
a briefing on Capitol Hill, which gathered together a group of
distinguished scholars, physicians, and public policy experts
to discuss the far reaching implications of  &quot;same sex&quot;
marriage.  The briefing was carried live on C-Span, and was re-aired
several times during the next 24 hours.  As a result, millions
of Americans had the opportunity to join with legislators and
congressional aides to see and hear the powerful testimony that
was presented.

<p>

The arguments against homosexual marriage are convincing and
familiar -- so familiar, in fact, that many of us have forgotten
how to effectively articulate them.  FRC's briefing brought together
people like adoption expert Mary Beth Style, former homosexual
Anthony Falzarano (who now leads Transformation Ex-Gay Ministries
in Washington, D.C.), Amherst Professor of Jurisprudence Hadley
Arkes, psychiatrist and former Yale University Fellow, Jeffrey
Satinover, and FRC's own Bob Knight, each of whom drove home the
essential values that are at stake in this debate. <i>(To help
you understand and articulate the arguments, FRC has condensed
this briefing into an hour-long video -- see the enclosed
reply card for information on how to obtain a copy for your church
or action group.)</i>

<p>

One week after the briefing, I found myself in the thick
of things again as I testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee
in favor of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA).  Disappointingly,
most of the senators who attended are very liberal and they are
also in favor of allowing same-sex marriages.  Before I testified,
Sen. Ted Kennedy (D-Mass.), a primary opponent of DOMA, used the
hearing to attack the bill.  His central point was that marriage
laws traditionally have been made by the states, and that DOMA
would violate the principle of &quot;federalism,&quot; which says
that Congress will not interfere with the powers of state government.
Unbelievable! Ted Kennedy, quoting &quot;states rights,&quot;
while he has been the major proponent of bigger and bigger government
here in Washington. Maybe cows really can fly!

<p>

Kennedy left before I testified, but as I was finishing my remarks
he returned to the hearing room, so I couldn't resist a jab.
&quot;Senator Kennedy,&quot; I said, &quot;this is the first
time in your career you've made such an outstanding defense of
federalism.&quot;  The usually somber hearing room broke into
raucous laughter, and the liberal senator from Massachusetts sank
back into his chair speechless.  The irony is, DOMA makes a powerful
statement in support of the right of each state to ignore the
radical judicial inventions of other states.  It's true federalism
all the way.

<p>

On the day after my testimony, the full House of Representatives
voted for DOMA 342-67.  This 5-1 margin of victory makes it clear
that DOMA <b><i>is</i></b> mainstream and that the aggressive ambitions
of the homosexual lobby <b><i>are not</i></b>.  In the coming days, FRC
will continue scrambling to help ensure that DOMA passes the Congress
without amendments and goes to the president for signature.  We
intend to do everything we can to send the Hawaii courts -- and liberal
judges everywhere -- a powerful message.

<p>

Here are several other fronts on which FRC has been fighting
for America's families:

<p><ul>

<li>FRC Director of Legal Policy, Cathleen Cleaver, has been in
the thick of the raging debates over computer pornography, cable
porn, and social issues from assisted suicide to religious liberty.
Cathleen played a key role in the recent adoption of the Communications
Decency Act, a bill passed by Congress earlier this year that
will help keep distributors of computer porn away from our children.
A federal court in Philadelphia struck down this law, but Cathleen
has begun work on FRC's legal brief to the Supreme Court, which
is likely to hear the case this fall.

<p>

FRC is also fighting for the right of citizens to offer sidewalk
counseling to women seeking abortions.  Cathleen prepared a brief
to the Supreme Court in the <I>Schenck v. Pro-Choice Network</I>
case and she is working with other lawyers to prepare oral arguments
to be made before the Court. Two major assisted suicide cases
are also getting our attention.  Either one could lead to a landmark
Supreme Court ruling which would protect human life, or put millions
of elderly and handicapped Americans at risk.

<p>

Finally, Cathleen is taking her effective debating skills before
some very tough audiences, and more than holding her own.  This
summer she has debated cable porn with Elliott Mincberg of People
for the American Way. She also locked horns over computer porn
with the government relations director of America On-line (a
longtime lawyer for the porn industry.) The computer porn debate
was shown on C-Span to a national audience.

<p>

<li>Robert Maginnis, FRC Policy Analyst has continued to spearhead
our Military Readiness Project. Bob came to FRC from the U.S. Army,
following his retirement, with the rank of Lieutenant Colonel.
Together with Melissa Wells-Petry, the Armed Forces' acknowledged
expert on the policy banning service in the military by homosexuals,
Bob has guided FRC's work this summer on three major court cases
regarding the ban. One of these cases, <I>Thomasson v. Perry</I>,
may soon be considered by the U.S. Supreme Court.

<p>

Bob has been working diligently on the drug issue as well, and
one glance at the trends will tell you how urgent this is.  In
the past three years, drug abuse has spiraled, especially -- and
most disturbingly -- among elementary school-age children using
gateway drugs like marijuana.  Bob recently attended a major
international drug conference in Sweden, and in early August he
met with Gen. Barry McCaffrey, President Clinton's drug czar,
to lay out FRC's specific concerns.

<p>

<li>Then there's Marty Dannenfelser, FRC Director of Government
Relations, and his excellent staff who have worked long and hard
on the effort to override the Clinton veto of the partial-birth
abortion ban. A vote in Congress, on this issue, is expected
soon after Labor Day. Marty's experienced team also played a
major role in the passage of a new bill which creates a national
commission on gambling, working in conjunction with our friend,
Congressman Frank Wolf (R- Va.).

<p>

<li>FRC has also been blessed to have the talents of Bob Morrison
and Jennifer <i>A</i>. Marshall on education issues, Jennifer
<i>E</i>. Marshall (that middle initial is not a misprint -- the
mail-sorting staff at FRC has its hands full!) on welfare reform
and voluntarism, Ryan Dobson (Jim Dobson's son) on youth issues,
and Steve Knudsen, our new director of state and local affairs,
who helped put together our recent press conference with state
family policy councils to endorse laws barring same-sex marriage.

</ul><p>

These are just a few of the activities that have kept FRC moving
at a sprinter's pace this summer. I wish I could tell you more
about the work of each and every member of our dedicated staff
members in Washington, D.C. and in Holland, Michigan, where our
constituent services and information systems teams are located.
FRC's team is top-notch, and it includes you, our beloved supporters.
Working together, we can make a significant difference in the
future of our country... in the way our families, our children,
and our grandchildren will spend their lives.

<p>

Thank you for all you do to help keep FRC moving forward. Your
involvement in our work is essential to our success.

<p>

Sincerely,

<p><br>

Gary L. Bauer<br>
President

<p>

P.S. While we've been busy running the race, financial support
for our work has fallen into the typical summer doldrums.  Your
help would give FRC a special boost right now, so please consider
making a contribution if you possibly can. Again, thank you -- and
God bless you.

Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee,<BR>

</CENTER>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 50%>
<P>
MADAM CHAIRMAN, DISTINGUISHED MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE, I am pleased to have the opportunity to offer the testimony of the Family Research Council on the nomination of Dr. Henry W. Foster to be Surgeon General of the United States.  The Family Research Council is a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization dedicated to analysis of the impact of public policy on the traditional family.  We place particular emphasis on the ways in which society can preserve and strengthen the two-parent family, and maximize the benefits that stable, intact family structure can confer on this nation's economic vitality, social well-being and spiritual strength.
<P>
     We believe that the position of Surgeon General of the United States now, more than ever, requires an individual who understands these dimensions of public policy.  Evolu- tion of the office of Surgeon General in the past two decades has diminished its direct policy-making and admini- strative role.  Evolution of the nature of many of the public health threats facing this nation today has magnified the importance of the Surgeon General's office in articulat-ing the essentials of healthy behavior.  The intersection of individual health and moral responsibility has never been more obvious.
<P>
     For this reason, it is critical that the office of Surgeon General be occupied by a person who has worked comfortably within that intersection.  That person must possess a clear, and consistently expressed, vision of public health.  He or she must be alive to the profound ethical dimensions of health issues in the late 20th century, and have a proven track record of responding cor-rectly to issues as they arise, not merely riding with the tide of public or professional opinion.  In short, he or she must be a leader, not a follower, intellectually and instinctively true to the highest standards of ethical behavior in medicine.  
<P>
     As a threshold matter, a Surgeon General must know and be able to articulate who he is and what he believes.  From the very beginning, when President Clinton announced his choice of Herny Foster on February 2, this nominee has been unable to articulate from one day to the next a consistent account even of his own career.  At every turn, members of this committee, of our own organization, and of the press have elicited from Dr. Foster and the administration new and revised accounts of various dimensions of his creed and his practice.  To this day, not one of these accounts fully squares with the other.  To this day, not one of these accounts amounts to a full disclosure by the nominee regard-ing his personal involvement in the most wrenching health policy questions of our time.
<P>
     The course of this nomination resembles a tent in spring rain.  Touch its soggy canvas anywhere and more revelations seep through.  It is hard to imagine an individual who has been implicared in more major public health controversies than Dr. Foster.  From the Tuskegee syphilis experiment, to involuntary sterilization of men-tally handicapped women, to the performance of abortions and advocacy of abortion on demand, to distribution of condoms and other birth control devices to children, to the school-based clinic debate, to involvement with radical sex education programs, Dr. Foster has been on the cutting edge -- and nearly always on its wrong side.
<P>
     As this testimony is written, it is impossible to say with assurance that he hasn't <B> always </B>been on the wrong side, because nothing of what is known about Dr. Foster's role in each of these controversies is the result of the nominee's frank and full disclosure.  Everything that is known about them is the result of examination of the nominee's record and repeated questioning of that record by others, our-selves included.  The Administration has been reluctant to take the first step to volunteer accurate information about any of the issues that have placed this nomination in jeopardy.
<P>
     Before discussing those issues in detail, I want to make one final point.  This nomination has not been, and is not being, "Borked."  No one has led an advertising campaign distorting the nominee's record, impugning his character, or implying dreaded, unnamed consequences for the nation if he takes office.  No one has scrolled through a list of his tastes in videos. The debate over this nomination is first and foremost about profoudnly important questions of public policy, and this nomination is in difficulty first and fore-most because the nominee himself has been unable to provide a consistent and accurate account of where he has stood and what he has done regarding these questions.  Even Robert Bork's most vociferous opponents will agree, I think, that he did not leave anyone in doubt about the authenticity of his beliefs.
<P>
     Doubt, on the other hand, is the essence of Dr. Foster's nomination.
<P>
<B> Biographical Omission</B>
<P>
     The difficulty with Dr. Foster's nomination began with the refusal of the White House to share with the public, and with this committee, his basic philosophy.  The biography of Dr. Foster released by the White House mentioned his chron-ological affiliations, but totally ignored his lifelong ties to Planned Parenthood.  That this would be the occasion for controversy can hardly be something the Administration would not recognize.  The <I> Chronicle of Philanthropy </I>has noted on several occasions that the Planned Parenthood Federation of America is among the top 10 most frequently objected to "charities" in the United States.  The <I> Chronicle </I>has reported that no nonprofit in the United States is more commonly eschewed through "restricted" gifts to the nation's United Way agencies.
<P>
     The reasons are simple, and to express them is to belie the White House's claim that Dr. Foster is a "mainstream" nominee.  The nominee claims that he is committed to absti- nence as the primary approach to sex education.  Planned Parenthood has led the ideological and legal assault on abstinence education programs in the United States.  The nominee claims that he desires to make abortion "safe, legal and rare."  But he has served as a "Public Policy Advocate" for the Planned Parenthood Federation during a time when its national leadership had dedicated itself to opening 75 abortion clinics across the United States<I> merely to meet a numerical goal consonant with the 75th anniversary of its founding</I>.
<P>
     Dr. Foster has sought to portray himself as an advocate for the family, and for parent-child communication.  But during his time as an official of Planned Parenthood of Nashville, that organization filed suit against a Tennessee law requiring parental consent for abortion.  Far from being a strict statute, that law provided for a judicial bypass procedure by which teenagers could seek abortions under court auspices without parental involvement.  Such an arrangement was not liberal enough for Planned Parenthood, which has led the national legal fight to exclude parents from involvement with their minor children's abortion decisions.  Again, this is not a mainstream position -- Americans support parental consent for abortion by margins of 2-1 or 3-1.  Parents themselves show an even higher rate of support for such laws.
<P>
     It is possible that Dr. Foster was and is ignorant of these positions taken by organizations with whom he has been associated for nearly two decades.  But it is not likely. Ignorance is a valid defense in some circumstances, but it is not a valid credential for someone who seeks to become the "nation's doctor," and the leader of a national crusade against teenage pregnancy.
<P>
     The American people had a right to know of Dr. Foster's association with this organization and its ideas.  The White House had no right to omit it from the biographical informa-tion it provided the Congress and the nation.
<P>
<B> Tuskegee Institute</B>
<P>
     "Ignorance" is also the nominee's defense against the circumstantial evidence, and the direct testimony of one individual, Dr. Luther McRae, that, as Vice President of the Macon County Medical Society in 1969, Dr. Foster partic-ipated in a Public Health Service briefing on the infamous Tuskegee syphilis experiments.  It is not in dispute that Dr, Foster spoke out against the experiments in 1972, when they were publicly revealed in media accounts.  It is pre-cisely that public expression of outrage that provoked the reaction of Dr. McRae, who has stated that he is willing to testify to this committee under oath that Dr. Foster was indeed present at the meeting on May 12, 1969 where PHS officials sought the "surrogate informed consent" of the MCMS for continuation of the Tuskegee Study.<P>
     McRae is categorical, and here is what he told Carl Ramsey of Family News in Focus:
<P>
<UL> The most striking thing about it, when
         the news broke . . . I saw on television
         and read in the papers that Dr. Foster 
         was involved in the public outrage about
         the study having been conducted.  And I
         was struck by that, in that I knew he was
         at the meeting . . . I asked myself why
         Henry didn't go ahead and say something at
         the meeting that night in 1969. Because he
         had every opportunity, nobody had a muzzle
         on him.i</UL><P>     McRae is also specific, recalling where Dr. Foster sat.  Moreover, he holds no animus against his colleague and believes -- in contrast to my view -- that he would make an excellent Surgeon General.  This fact lends added weight to his assertion regarding Dr. Foster's knowledge of the Tus-kegee experiment in 1969.
<P>
     Dr. McRae insists that Henry Foster did know about the existence of the experiment.  But it is equally important to recognize that he should have known, and that the May 12 meeting at a restaurant outside Tuskegee was not his only opportunity to inform himself about a PHS study that had been under way for nealry four decades.  First, the study had been described in the medical journals; as an obstetric-ical chief working in a county with one of the nation's highest rates of syphilis (indeed, this was one reason PHS originally chose Macon County as the site of the nontreat-ment study), at perhaps that county's most prominent ob-gy
center, Dr. Foster would have reason to be well read in the literature of venereal disease.
<P>
     Dr. McRae has noted, as does James Jones' account of the Tuskegee experiment, Bad Blood, that PHS officials supplied the Macon County Medical Society with a list of the individuals "participating" in the study, to assure that they would not obtain treatment, particularly antibiotics, by other means from local physicians.ii  Given the "zeal," as Jones puts it, with which PHS officials pursued the cooper- ation of Macon County physicians, it seems unlikely that distribution of this list to the Vice President of the Society's Vice President would be overlooked.<P>    Jones also points out that in 1970the PHS "also reestablished something of its former working relationship with medical personnel at John A. Andrew Hospital."  A representative of PHS, Dr. Joseph G. Caldwell, met with the hospital's administrator and medical director and contracted to have the surviving men's X-rays taken there in the hospital's new facility.  Again, it is possible that the presence of PHS officials, and the conduct of examinations of the syphilitic men, in the facility where he was chief of obstetrics would have entirely escaped the notice of Dr. Foster.  
<P>
     Assuming as much, however, it is hardly a flattering protrayal of Dr. Foster's engagement with public health issues when the most significant events of his time took place in his immediate vicinity, with the cooperation of the Medical Society of which he was Vice President, without his taking cognizance of them.  Such a lapse may not amount to much for a physician who simply desires to continue his work serving the general population; it is a fatal failure of responsibility in an individual who claims to have the ability to serve as the nation's top spokesman on public health.  Dr. Foster says that he did not know of the exper- iments.  The key is that nearly all his colleagues did, that at least one says that he himself did, and that, in any case, he should have known.
<P>
<B> Dr. Foster and Abortion</B>
<P>
     On the issue of abortion, Dr. Foster has taken the fifth.  That is to say, he has taken at least five posi- tions on the number of abortions he has performed or guided to completion.  He has misstated not merely his own involvement in abortion, but inaccurately described the guidelines on medical education under which, he claims, a study of prostaglandin suppositories was conducted during his tenure at Meharry Medical School.  Worse, he has used language in documents officially released by the Department of Health and Human Services that finesses the question of his involvement in abortion.  These finesses put his vera-city not merely in question, but in grave doubt.  
<P>
    Let me summmarize:<P>
<UL> <B> Late January.  </B>A White House official informs<BR>
      Chairman Kassebaum that Dr. Foster had per-<BR>
      formed one abortion during his medical career.<BR>
      ("Foster Says He Performed Abortions,"<I> The Wash-<BR>
      ington Post</I>, Feb. 4, 1995).
<P>
 <B> February 3, 1995.  </B>The Department of Health<BR>
       and Human Services releases a statement by<BR>
       Dr. Foster which states, " I believe that I<BR>
       performed fewer than a dozen pregnancy term-<BR>
       inations." (Statement by Dr. Henry Foster,<BR>
       Nominee for U.S. Surgeon General.)
<P>
 <B> February 6, 1995.  </B>The International Foundation<BR>
       for Genetic Research/Michael Fund releases a<BR>
       transcript, first disputed by the White House<BR>
       but then acknowledged to be genuine, in which<BR>
       Foster states, "I have done a lot of amniocen-<BR>
       tesis and therapeutic abortions, probably near<BR>
       700." (Department of Health, Education and Wel-<BR>
       fare, Office of the Secretary, Ethics Advisory<BR>
       Board, Meeting V, Friday, November 10, 1978<BR>
       Seattle, Washington, p. 180, 197).
<P>
       The Foundation also releases a story from the<BR>
       November 1980 <I> ObGyn News </I>describing an abortion-<BR>
       pill study conducted by Dr. Foster at Meharry on<BR>
       behalf of Upjohn Pharmaceuticals that resulted in<BR>
        59 completed abortions on patients in the trial.     <BR>
<P>
 <B> February 8, 1995.  </B>Appearing on ABC's<I> Nightline</I>,<BR>
        Dr. Foster acknowledges performing 39 abortions, but<BR>
       notes that this does not include any abortions he<BR>
       may have performed before 1973.  Foster tells Kop-<BR>
       pel that this total also does not include the 59<BR>
       abortions carried out under the trial he super-<BR>
       vised, because he did not personally perform them.</UL>
 <P>
     Thus, in little more than a week, Dr. Foster deployed five different versions of his record regarding abortions.<P>
Volatility like this makes the Mexican peso look stable by comparison.  It prompted even the spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Human Services, Avis LaVelle, to remark, "The next time we utter a number [of Foster's abortions], it won't be based on Dr. Foster's recollec-tions."iii  But if you take a closer look at the February 3 statement released over his name, it appears amply crafted to disguise the information that was released on February 6 by the International Foundation for Genetic Research.<P>     As <I> The Washington Times </I>pointed out on February 7, Dr. Foster's artful February 3 statement offered circumlocu- tions regarding his term as chief of service at Tuskegee and Meharry.  Of the "wide variety of medical procedures and research" performed at both, "all," he wrote, "were in accordance with the law and educational requirements."iv  As the <I> Times </I>observed, "Abortion . . . has been legal for many years, and thus had Dr. Foster performed hundreds of abortions as chief of service - as opposed to acting in his capacity as a private physician - that fact would not have been actually lied about, given the statement's careful wording."
<P>
     The same can be said about the prostaglandin supposi- tory trial, which Dr. Foster was compelled to elaborate upon the following night in his exchange with Ted Koppel.  There he launched the "educational requirements" explanation, citing alleged accreditation requirements as the justifi- cation for seeking grant money to test the abortion suppos- itory for Upjohn.  There are two issues here.  One is the intended evasion by Dr. Foster of a full accounting of his abortion activity in his February 3 statement.  The second is his misunderstanding -- or possible evasion -- regarding the rationale for the prostaglandin trial.
<P>
     As chief of obstetrics at two major medical instituti- tions, Dr. Foster surely should have known that nothing in the then-extant accreditation guidelines from the Accredi-tation Council for Graduate Medical Education required any medical school to offer training in performing abortions, much less to conduct trials of experimental abortion drugs.  In relevant part, the guidelines state that:
<P>
<UL> Resident education [in obstetrics and<BR>
         gynecology] must include, but not neces-<BR>
         sarily be limited to the following:<BR>
<P>
         1. Obstetrics<BR>
         a. The full range of obstetrics, includ-<BR>
            ing high-risk obstetrics and medical<BR>
            and surgical complications of pregnancy.</UL>
<P>
     Arguably this standard could be interpreted as requiring training in the management of complications resulting from botched abortions, although the term "abor-tion" (or any euphemism for it) is nowhere mentioned in the standards.  Even under this reading of the standard, however, it would clearly be unethical for a program to arrange for a botched abortion to give the residents a training opportunity.  Conducting a trial of a new drug (one that never did reach the market) would just as clearly be an unethical way to fulfill such an obligation.
<P>
     But the bottom line is that no such obligation existed in the late 1970s when the trial was conducted, nor does one exist now, when Dr. Foster cites it as justification for Meharry's participation in the Phase 2 trial and uses it as a mask for a major abortion activity he obviously did not want disclosed.  It is only an added insult to common knowl- edge when Foster continues to cite this erroneous account of accreditation requirements to justify a project that was clearly taken on because of Dr. Foster's lifelong commitment to abortion.
<P>
     Finally, it should be pointed out that as of the date of this testimony, March 24, 1995, a complete accounting of Dr. Foster's activity on behalf of abortion is still not in the public record.  He has specifically excluded revelations regarding any abortions he may have performed prior to 1973, when he began his association with Meharry.  His basis for the exclusion is the unavailability of records prior to that date.  Given how well Dr. Foster's "recollections" have served him and the administration on other issues, it's just as well.
<P>
<B> Involuntary Sterilization</B>
<P>
     Dr. Foster's involvement in the possily involuntary sterilization of four mentally handicapped women is the only controversial issue in his background that was placed before the public by action of the White House.  Its discovery, however, was inevitable, as Dr. Foster himself described the prcedures in an article entitled "Removal of the Normal Uterus" in the <I> Southern Medical Journal </I>in 1976.v  Dr. Foster states in the article only that he had "begun to use hysterectomy in patients with severe mental retardation.  Hysterectomy," he noted, "can be done <I>eithe</I>r [emphasis added] for sterilization or to eliminate the menses[.]"vi<P>     Whatever the presumed indication for the procedure, obviously hysterectomy eliminates both fertility and the menses.  This is important because hysterectomy carries significantly higher risks to the mother than the conven-tional means of sterilization (salpingectomy, i.e., removal of the Fallopian tubes).  As Stephen Trombley's valuable history of coercive sterilization makes clear, the United States in the early 1970s experienced a "sterilization explosion."vii  At least part of the impetus for the proce- dure (besides the desire of Planned Parenthood and other population control groups to promote permanent methods of sterilization, particularly on eugenic grounds) was the desire to provide medical students with the opportunity to perform hysterectomies.viii<P>
     This "sterilization explosion" did not go unnoticed or unopposed.  In fact, by 1973 the Health Research Group, affiliated with Ralph Nader's Public Citizen, Inc. had pub-lished a major report on sterilization abuse.  The report documented the sudden rise in sterilization, particularly targeting the indigent, the uneducated and the young, and called for federal regulation, especially to ensure informed consent.
<P>
     This report provided the statistical and anecdotal basis for federal interest in sterilization reform, but as Trombley writes, the report attained its full effect "only after the problem of sterilization abuse was heightened by the personal tragedy of the Relf family."ix<P>     Interestingly, the Relf case took place in Alabama in 1973.  Once again a major public health controversy brewed virtually under Dr. Henry Foster's nose, without his being aware of it, and at a time when had begun to perform hyster- ectomies.  The Relf case deserves a brief synopsis.  A poor balck family living in Montgomery, the Relfs had three daughters, ages 12 to 16.  At the behest of the local family planning service, the three girls were injected with the contraceptive drug Depo-Provera.  In March 1973, the oldest girl, Katie was taken, without her parents' consent, to a family planning clinic, where an IUD was inserted over her objections.
<P>
     A series of events then brought the remaining two girls, along with their mother, to a local hospital, where the mother, unable to read or write, was induced to place an "X" on a document authorizing them, without hr knowledge, to be sterilized.  A subsequent effort by the family planning service to sterilize Katie failed.  
<P>
     That summer, the Relf case came to the attention of Sen. Edward Kennedy, who on July 10, 1973 invited the Relfs to his office.  By happenstance, Sen. Kennedy's committee was at that same time engaged in the hearings on health care and human experimentation spawned by the Tuskegee incident.  The Relfs proceeded to file suit against the Department of Health, Education and Welfare, resulting in a judgment requiring the federal government to issue guidelines providing for the protection of minors from sterilization and for informed consent.
<P>
     Contemporaneous with <I> Relf </I>was the <I> Wyatt </I>case, in which a federal court declared unconstitutional an Alabama law that permitted the sterilization of mentally retarded inmates of state institutions.  Although compulsory steril-ization remained legal in many states during the 1970s, the issues raised by the Health Research Group and debated in the federal courts in Alabama had risen to national prominence two to three years before Dr. Foster's article appeared in<I> the Southern Medical Journal</I>.  Despite this fact, Foster's article makes no mention of these develop- ments, and betrays no awareness of any kind that, even in his own state, he was part of a rapidly dying consensus that such sterilizations as he had "begun" to perform were med- ically and morally unacceptable.
<P>
     As columnist Charles Krauthammer wrote on February 17, the circumstances surrounding these surgical sterilizations (why higher-risk hysterectomies were performed, whether informed consent was obtained, and from whom) involve serious questions.  The apologia that Foster performed only four such sterilizations does not answer these questions; in fact, as Krauthammer notes, "It breyas an obvious discomfort with what Foster did.  It reinforces the sense that the moral climate of the 1970s was not nearly as alien as some pretend and that even in that ancient time surgically sterilizing the retarded was a morally troubling act."x<P>    I only note in passing that Dr. Foster's first account of abortions he performed was one.  Once again, Foster failed to notice a major public health controversy that sprang up largely as a result of incidents just down the road from the institutions he helped to lead.<P><B> I Have a Future</B><P>     The plausibility of Dr. Foster's commitment to abstinence as his first priority in educating young people about sexuality was discussed above.  One example should suffice.
<P>
     In 1987 the Planned Parenthood Federation of America distributed a report written for it by Marie Haviland-James, apparently affiliated with Michigan Planned parenthood.  The report was an ideological assault on "Sex Respect," one of the most venerable abstinence education programs in the United States.  The following account of the Haviland-James report appears in an analysis of sex education programs written and published in 1991:
<P>
<UL> The Haviland-James report provided guidance<BR>
       to Planned parenthood sex educators opposing<BR>
 <I> Sex Respect </I>and seeking its removal from the<BR>
       schools.  The memo urged opponents of <I> Sex <BR>
       Respect </I>to argue that it "violates the separa-<BR>
       tion of church and state" and risks litigation<BR>
       from the American Civil Liberties Union {whose<BR>
       late counsel, Harriet Pilpel, once represented<BR>
       both organizations].  It charged that the pro-<BR>
       gram is faulty because it contained "many refer-<BR>
       ences . . . to a 'spiritual' dimension of sex-<BR>
       uality; contained use of the word 'baby' for<BR>
       fetus"; expressed "bias . . . against people<BR>
       who are sexually active and unmarried"; "com-<BR>
       pared stealing of money continually with con-<BR>
       tinued sexual activity'; contained " a descrip-<BR>
       tion of a woman haunted by guilt"; omitted <BR>
       "pro-choice material"; and, of greatest inter-<BR>
       est, included "unsubstantiated claims" such as<BR>
       "abstinence has future benefits for teens" and<BR>
       "because of the special nature of human sexual-<BR>
       ity, there's no way to have premarital sex <BR>
       without hurting someone."  The memo concluded<BR>
       that <I> Sex Respect </I>"appeals . . . to the lowest <BR>
       common denominator of mentality."xi</UL><P>     Once again, the most chartible interpretation that can be put on Dr. Foster's involvement with an organization that takes this aggressive a stance against abstinence education is that he is wholly unaware of it.  Fortunately, there is more direct evidence of Dr. Foster's approach, which is at best "abstinence-plus," with the abstinence part thrust with embarrassment up his sleeve.
<P>
     The Family Research Council has obtained a copy of the eight-page brochure produced by Foster's "I Have a Future" program to introduce the program.  Over a couple of thousand of words of text, the word "abstinence", or its equivalents is not mentioned once.  The phrase, "delaying the initiation of sexual activity," common in all true abstinence materials, is not mentioned once.  On the other hand, the brochure repeatedly stresses the objective of the program to enhance "contraceptive availability," to address the problem of "poor" "contraceptive practices," and to promote "distribution of contraceptives."xii<P>     Efforts by the Council and the media to obtain a full copy of the "I Have a Future" curriculum have been rebuffed.xiii  If the currciulum is as its sponsors say it is, this reaction to public curioisity is itself curious.  In fact, one would expect that, upon his elevation to Surgeon General, Dr. Foster would proudly promote the "I Have a Future" curriculum as a model abstinence program.  His pride should be just as great before this committee votes.<P><B> Conclusion</B><P>    These are but a few of the issues that attend the nomination of Dr. Herny Foster.  Ther common link is that in 1995, the United States deserves to have in this position of authority an individual with a clear vision of the public health consequences of personal behavior, an abiding commit- ment to marriage and the family, an alertness to the ethical dimensions of today's contemporary controversies in medicine and public policy, an unblemished record of candor and truth-telling to the American people, and a concern for every mother and child.  
<P>
     Henry Foster has shown that he is not that person.

<title>Gary Bauer's July, 1996 Letter</title>

<body>

<center><h2>A Message From Gary L. Bauer</h2></center>

<p><hr width=75% height=2><p>

July 12, 1996

<p>

Dear Friend:

<p>

The Bauer family had a close call last month.  An unusually strong
summer thunderstorm ripped through the Washington area, bringing
with it 150-mile-per-hour winds.  To make matters worse, a tornado
touched down on our street, knocking down trees and sending limbs
flying through walls and onto rooftops.  Fortunately, our house
was largely spared, but a neighbor's home was badly damaged.

<p>

My daughter, Elyse, and I were driving home through the storm
when the tornado hit.  I'll never forget the sight as we turned
down our street and saw how the severe weather had rearranged
the familiar objects of our daily lives.  The storm was gone in
a little more than an hour, but it was incredible how quickly
so much raw destruction was wreaked on our community.  Human beings
are no match for the forces of God's Creation.  We were struck
with a sense of awe -- and our hearts were filled with thanks that
the destruction was not worse and that no one was injured or killed.

<p>

That twister wasn't the only storm I encountered last month.
Throughout the month of June, I found myself caught up in a whirlwind
over the Republican Party Platform and the sanctity of human life.
Debate over the GOP's pro-life plank has been going on for years,
but this new storm kicked up suddenly and unexpectedly.  It came
about when Sen. Robert Dole, the certain GOP presidential nominee,
called for the addition of  a &quot;declaration of tolerance&quot;
to the platform, and suggested that it be applied <I>only</I>
to the abortion language.  That current language in the existing
platform says that the unborn child has a fundamental right to
life that cannot be infringed, and calls for a human life amendment
to the Constitution.

<p>

Let me say right up front that Sen. Bob Dole and I have known
each other for years.  I consulted with him last fall, at his
request, before he delivered his speech in Hollywood calling on
the entertainment industry to reverse its tide of sex-and-violence
for profit.  We have collaborated over the years on many other
issues.  A few weeks ago, Jim Dobson and I prayed together with
Bob in his Capitol Hill office.  I consider him a friend, and
I believe he would say the same about me.

<p>

But, in my humble opinion, Bob Dole is wrong about the pro-life
plank. It cannot and should not be changed.  Talk about revising
the plank has been swirling, of course, for months in GOP circles.
Some prominent pro-abortion Republicans, like Govs. Christine
Todd Whitman and Pete Wilson, have insisted on removing it altogether.
To do so would repeat the discussion that took place in the Democratic
party some years ago. The 1992 Democratic Platform endorsed an
abortion on demand philosophy.  A previous statement tolerating
the presence of pro-life Democrats in the party was stripped from
the platform.  As a result, President Clinton has vetoed every
attempt to restrict abortion, including those in the 7th, 8th
and 9th months of pregnancy.

<p>

All during the early summer, I was among a number of pro-life
leaders who were kept abreast of negotiations taking place among
leading Republicans.  After weeks of discussion, an agreement
was reached to include &quot;open door&quot; language in the preamble
to the platform.  That language would only state the obvious:
that the GOP platform stands for a set of principles, and that
not every member of the party agrees with every one of those principles.
The sanctity of human life would not be singled out or in any
other way watered down.  The current pro-life plank, powerful
and unequivocal, would remain as written. No deletions.  No dilutions.

<p>

This solution was acceptable, but within 24 hours Bob Dole himself
overturned it. He used a television interview to declare his
intention to put the tolerance language right in the pro-life
plank. Talk about a twister out of the blue!  This so-called
solution was totally unacceptable, and I said so publicly.  The
sanctity-of-life plank is among a handful of essential statements
in the GOP platform.  To attach &quot;tolerance&quot; language
directly to that plank would signal to the world (and the media
immediately interpreted it this way) that the Republican Party
regards it as one of the least important issues facing the nation,
when in fact the issue goes to the heart of the fundamental purpose
of liberty.

<p>

Just consider the impact of including tolerance language on another
subject, say, taxes:  &quot;We favor tax relief for overworked
Americans, but we recognize that many people disagree with us.&quot;
You would instantly recognize that the party which said this
wasn't serious about cutting taxes.  The same holds true for the
profound question of whether unborn children and their mothers
should be protected from the exploitation of abortions.

<p>

What followed my public criticism of Sen. Dole's proposal was
uncomfortable for both of us.  The senator took me on by name,
and major newspapers were happy to splash the dispute across page
one.  I kept my comments focused on the issues at stake, but it
was an awkward moment for me anyway.  Disputes among friends will
always draw a crowd of spectators.  But this fight, gut-wrenching
as it was, has an upside.  First, I have high hopes that, by the
time you read this, the dispute over the pro-life plank will be
resolved with an agreement that makes it clear that our children
deserve the full protection of the laws of the United States.
Second, this public argument gave me a rare chance to address
the nation on why the sanctity of human life matters so much.

<p>

National Public Radio, as liberal a media outlet as there is,
interviewed me in drive-time, and my comments were carried fairly
and without censorship.  <I>The New York Times</I>, <I>Washington
Post</I> and other major papers accurately reported my defense
of our children.  The following weekend, I was invited to appear
on the prestigious CNN public policy show, <I>The Capital Gang.</I>
I was able to tell large segments of the American people what
our nation's abandonment of the sanctity of human life is doing
to the fabric of our society.  All of this came on the heels of
unprecedented media opportunities for the Family Research Council
(FRC), including appearances on <I>This Week with David Brinkley</I> 
and <I>Face the Nation</I> and a write-up in <I>Time</I> magazine
featuring our principled stands.

<p>

Since all of this happened, I have heard from many people who
say they don't necessarily agree with FRC on every issue, but
that we give them something to think about.  This is vital to
remember.  Where &quot;tolerance&quot; language goes in the Republican
platform -- whether it's there at all -- isn't just a matter of dotting
&quot;i's&quot; and crossing &quot;t's.&quot;  If an issue isn't
important enough to appear in any party's platform, then it's
not worth a national conversation.  How we address the sanctity
of human life will determine whether this nation endures, or whether
it is torn away forever from the ideals that motivated our Founders.

<p>

Let me take a moment here to thank you.  In the middle of this
hot debate, hundreds of you called, wrote and faxed me your support.
Countless friends prayed for my family and for FRC.  Believe
me, we felt that encouragement.

<p>

My relationship with Washington leaders in both parties, including
Bob Dole, matters very much to me.  But the Family Research Council
is committed to speaking the truth:  on the needs of families,
on neglected children, on coarseness in the culture, on the virtue
deficit, and on the violence corroding our common sense of neighborliness.
We will speak the truth in election years and non-election years.
We will speak up when it pleases our friends, and when it doesn't.
To do otherwise would be to convert this organization into just
one more nest of political hired guns in the nation's capital.
I won't have that.  The issues facing America are bigger and
more enduring than one presidential race.

<p>

You will be happy to know, for example, that we are working with
a courageous band of Democrats in Congress who are struggling
to add &quot;tolerance&quot; language to the 1996 Democratic Platform.
This is &quot;tolerance&quot; language we <b><i>can</i></b> support
because it moves in the opposite direction:  it would say that
there is room in the Democratic party for people who champion
the &quot;little guy&quot; in the womb.  Unfortunately, I am not
optimistic about a change in their platform even though 40 percent
of registered Democrats hold pro-life beliefs.  For nearly a decade
now, the party has turned a deaf ear to their pleas.  Instead,
they have allowed radical feminists, the ACLU and gay rights groups
to turn the party into a vehicle for radical social change.

<p>

As I've emphasized many times before, FRC does not endorse candidates,
but we do work diligently to keep the issues affecting America's
families at center stage.  Toward that end, we will work with
anyone, anywhere, who is genuinely willing to espouse family-friendly
public policy.

<p>

While I'm writing to you, let me give you an update on another
&quot;contest&quot; in which I've been involved.  This is the
competition I proposed last January between two visions:  the
big-government philosophy of Hillary Rodham Clinton's book, <I>It
Takes a Village</I>, and the family-centered ideals of my book,
<I>Our Hopes, Our Dreams.</I> This spring, Family Research Council
placed advertisements in newspapers and magazines challenging
the American people to compare the visions in these two books
and to choose the one that best represents their hopes for the
next generation of American children.

<p>

So here are the results to date.  The first lady's publisher
reports that 360,000 copies of <I>It Takes a Village</I> are in
print.  Those figures do not necessarily reflect actual sales.
A similar number of copies of <I>Our Hopes, Our Dreams</I> have
now been sold, enough to put this little paperback on the Top
Five list of Christian best-sellers for the past three months.
In short, my competition with Mrs. Clinton is neck-and-neck.

<p>

I realize that this has happened only because thousands of faithful
supporters like you have bought multiple copies of <I>Our Hopes,
Our Dreams</I> and shared them with neighbors, friends, and fellow
believers.  I can hardly ask you to do more.  But consider this:
<I>Our Hopes, Our Dreams</I> was written as a straightforward,
easily understood summary of what has drawn pro-family Americans
into the public policy arena in record numbers.  Can you think
of anyone -- an acquaintance or business associate -- who would benefit
from the couple of hours it takes to read this statement of pro-family
principle?

<p>

If you can, it's easy to use our &quot;800&quot; number to order
<I>Our Hopes, Our Dreams</I> directly from us.  Better still,
however, you can take a step that will aid a vital voice in your
community and help boost the ranking of <I>Our Hopes, Our Dreams</I>
on the best-seller lists.  Visit your local Christian bookstore
and obtain or order a copy there.  Christian booksellers play
an irreplaceable role in spreading the Word, attracting new Christians
and encouraging &quot;old&quot; ones.  Many of these establishments
exist on a shoestring, and they struggle at this time of year.
Please take a moment to drop by and let them know you appreciate
their presence in your community.

<p>

Have a blessed and enjoyable summer (may it be as storm-free
as possible, too!).  From all of us at Family Research Council,
thank you for your support, and God bless you.

<p>

Sincerely,

<p><br>

Gary L. Bauer<br>
President

<p>

P.S. Summers are a great time for families, a time for vacations
and building memories for a lifetime.  The only problem is that
cagey Washington insiders know that grassroots Americans are distracted
from their handling of critical issues. <b><i>This summer, FRC especially
needs your help</i></b>. The Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) <I>must</I>
be passed before a Hawaiian court acts in August.  The
Partial-Birth Abortion bill <I>must</I> get a powerful vote in
the House this month to override Bill Clinton's veto.  And we
<i>must</i> push for desperately-needed tax relief for families with
children before Congress adjourns for the fall election campaigns.
I hope you will prayerfully consider giving us your financial
support this month.  With your help, I am convinced that we can
stay in the fight and win. Thank you and God bless you.

<title>Gary Bauer's June, 1996 Letter</title>

<body>

<center><h2>A Message From Gary L. Bauer</h2></center>

<p><hr width=75% height=2><p>

June 7, 1996

<p>

Dear Friend:

<p>

June is fittingly called &quot;the month of weddings.&quot; 
As the first real warm days of summer finally arrive, skies are
blue, flowers are blooming, and brides and grooms are seemingly
everywhere.  Marriage is never out of season, but I can think
of no better time than the month of June for our nation to reaffirm
the value and meaning of marriage.

<p>

As this letter is written, a reaffirmation of marriage is taking
place all across our land.  You can hear it in the peal of church
bells and read about it in wedding announcements and church bulletins.
You can even see it in brightly decorated cars parading by on
dazzling June days.  But this reaffirmation is taking place in
another way, too.

<p>

In Washington, DC, and in over 30 states, legislators are stepping
forward to make sure that marriage is protected in American law.
My letter is brief this month because the Family Research Council
is in the thick of this essential effort.  The reaffirmation of
traditional marriage is coming <b>just in time</b>.  Even as I
write this, an organized assault is in progress to redefine marriage
to allow men to marry men and women to marry women.

<p>

Let me recap quickly what has happened.  In 1993, the highest
court in Hawaii handed down a shocking decision.  Liberal judges
there said that Hawaii's law limiting marriage to one man and
one woman (similar to laws in every other state) was a form of
sex discrimination -- unless the state could somehow show that it
had a &quot;compelling interest&quot; in reserving marriage to
couples of the opposite sex!  Hawaii is a very liberal state politically,
but this ruling sparked immediate outrage even there.

<p>

Nearly three quarters of Hawaii's citizens told pollsters they
<I>reject</I> making Hawaii a haven for homosexual couples to
&quot;marry.&quot;  In 1994 the Hawaii legislature responded and
passed a law reaffirming that marriage is intended for &quot;man-woman
units&quot; -- not two men or two women.

<p>

Despite the findings of this poll, and subsequent efforts to
convince the courts that Hawaii does have a &quot;compelling interest&quot;
here, most experts believe that traditional marriage in Hawaii
will be struck down -- perhaps as soon as this August.  If that happens,
homosexual couples from every state in the Union are ready to
fly to Hawaii and find &quot;chapels&quot;or Justices of the Peace
to marry them.  They will then return to their home states and
demand recognition of these marriages from their state and local
governments, from their employers, from the courts, from their
churches (and from you)!

<p>

The worst news is that these demands have a good chance of succeeding.
Under what is known as the &quot;Full Faith and Credit&quot;
clause of the U.S. Constitution, each state is required to recognize
the &quot;Public Acts, Records and Judicial Proceedings&quot;
of every other state (Article IV, Section 1).   States that refuse
to recognize these Hawaiian &quot;marriage&quot; licenses as valid
are likely to find themselves being sued in court, with the outcome
uncertain.  Unbelievably, the action of a single court -- or even
a single judge -- in Hawaii could lead to a revolution that undoes
the sanctity of the marriage bond in every corner of the United
States.

<p>

<b>We must not -- and cannot -- allow this to happen!</b> When Hawaii's
Supreme Court ruled in 1993, FRC responded with alerts and issue
papers pointing out the devastating impact that would follow.
We and other groups encouraged states to respond by reaffirming
the traditional definition of marriage to insulate it from attack.
The word has spread rapidly, and a wide coalition of religious
and family groups and legislators of all political persuasions
is currently pushing for marriage protection laws.

<p>

Such laws have now been enacted in at least eleven states, and
more may be signed into law by the time you read this.  In addition,
the Congress of the United States is set to respond to this challenge.
With FRC's help and through the dedicated efforts of legal experts
on Capitol Hill, legislation has been introduced to protect marriage
in federal law.  This legislation is called the Defense of Marriage
Act, or DOMA.  It was introduced in the House of Representatives
on May 7 by Reps. Steve Largent (R-Okla.) and Bob  Barr (R-Ga.).
Senate introduction of the legislation followed on May 8 with
Don Nickles (R-Okla.) and Bob Dole (R-Kans.) as co-sponsors.
The respective bill numbers are H.R.3396 and S.1740.

<p>

Make no mistake, this bill is vitally needed.  Sen. Dan Coats
(R-Ind.) issued a powerful statement endorsing the bill and explaining
the importance of marriage.  His quote is worth sharing at length:

<p><blockquote>

<i>Marriage is the institution that civilizes our society by 
humanizing our lives. It is the social, legal and spiritual 
relationship that prepares the next generation for its duties and 
opportunities.  An 1884 decision of the Supreme Court called it 
&quot;the sure foundation of all that is stable and noble
in our civilization.&quot;

<p>

The definition of marriage is not created by politicians and judges, 
and it cannot be changed by them.  It is rooted in our history,
in our laws, our deepest moral and religious convictions, and our 
nature as human beings.  It is the union of one man and one woman. 
This fact can be respected or resented, but it can't be altered.

<p>

The institution of marriage is our most valuable cultural inheritance. 
It is our duty -- perhaps our first duty -- to pass it intact to the 
future . . . It is amazing and disturbing that the debate should even 
be necessary.  It is a sign of the times, and an indication of a deep 
moral confusion.  But events have made the definition of traditional 
marriage essential.  The preservation of marriage has become an issue 
of self-preservation for our society.</i>

</blockquote><p>

With Senator Coats' words, the case for marriage rests.
Be assured that the Family Research Council will continue to
work with him and other like-minded legislators in both parties
to secure passage of this bill as soon as possible -- before a final
decision is reached by the Supreme Court in Hawaii.  Americans
need to be heard before our courts intervene and disturb yet another
legal ideal.  Our goal is that DOMA will swiftly reach President
Clinton's desk and that he will have no choice but to sign it
into law.

<p>

<b>The need for passage of this bill could not be more urgent.
On May 20, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the state of Colorado's
Amendment 2, which would have blocked special rights for homosexuals.
One leader of the homosexual movement bragged, &quot;This is
a joyous day for gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender Americans.&quot;</b>

<p>

Please join with us in this effort.  Use the enclosed card, or
call us at 1-800-225-4008, to obtain a free copy of our information
packet on saving the institution of marriage.  Take note of the
enclosed copy of the full-page advertisement we placed in the
May 19 <i>Washington Post</i>.  Feel free to make copies or contact
us to arrange to run this ad in your local newspaper.

<p>

Be assured that your prayers and financial support of the work
of the Family Research Council are what sustain us.  Your involvment
and commitment to FRC will enable us to continue in our efforts
to defend the divine institution of marriage.  As always, thank
you for your friendship, and may God bless you.

<title>Gary Bauer's May, 1996 Letter</title>

<body>

<center><h2>A Message From Gary L. Bauer</h2></center>

<p><hr width=75% height=2><p>

May 15, 1996

<p>

Dear Friend:

<p>

You probably read about the incredible speech Supreme Court Justice 
Antonin Scalia delivered at a prayer breakfast in early April at 
the Mississippi College School of Law in Jackson. Scalia delivered 
a stirring defense of the role of Christians in public life. The 
reaction was a prolonged standing ovation. But there was no ovation 
for the speech inside the Washington Beltway, where FRC fights 
every day on behalf of your family, or among America's cultural 
elite.

<p>

&quot;Justice Scalia: Defender of the Faith,&quot; sneered the
headline in the <I>International Herald Tribune.</I>[1]

<p>

The speech &quot;clearly undermines public confidence in [Scalia's]
objectivity regarding religious controversies,&quot;[2] said Barry
Lynn of Americans United for the Separation of Church and State.

<p>

&quot;This is a disturbing view for a Justice to have,&quot;[3] said
Elliott Mincberg, legal director of Norman Lear's group, People for
the American Way.

<p>

The speech should have set off &quot;alarm bells,&quot;[4] charged
political columnists Jack Germond and Jules Witcover.

<p>

In a few pockets of liberalism outside the beltway the reaction
was even harsher:

<p>

Humor columnist Art Buchwald fired away: &quot;When a Justice
is hearing a case, no secular person can feel comfortable with
a member of the court who is thinking, 'If this lawyer doesn't
believe in the &quot;burning bush,&quot; he has a serious constitutional
problem.'&quot;[5]

<p>

<I>Des Moines Register</I> writer Donald Kaul, suggested that
Scalia &quot;occupies the outermost reaches of the right of the
court (some days you can only reach him by dogsled).&quot;[6]

<p>

What words could have possibly sparked such -- there's no other word
but <I>scornful</I> -- reactions from so many elements of the working
press? Scalia spoke to the crowd of 650 fellow Americans about the 
difficulty of upholding Christian beliefs, especially a belief in miracles,
in our increasingly secular society. He pointed out that the word
&quot;cretin,&quot; or &quot;fool,&quot; is derived from the French
word for &quot;Christian,&quot; and added:

<p><blockquote>

<i>To be honest about it, that is the view of Christians taken
by modern society. Surely those who adhere to all or most of these 
traditional Christian beliefs are to be regarded as simple-minded.</i>[7]

<p>

The &quot;worldly wise,&quot; he went on:

<p>

<i>just will not have anything to do with miracles . . . [they
assume] that everything from Easter morning to the Ascension had to 
be made up by the groveling enthusiasts</i> (the disciples - ed.) 
<i>as part of their plan to get themselves martyred.</i>[8]

</blockquote><p>

In the midst of this cynicism, he concluded, &quot;We must pray
to endure the scorn of the sophisticated world.&quot;[9] Justice 
Scalia's prayers came not a moment too soon. Those
who immediately attacked the speech, calling it contrary
to American tradition and inconsistent with his role as a judge,
seemed blissfully unaware that they were only confirming the truth
of what he said.

<p>

One professor of constitutional law at American University in
Washington, D.C., blasted the speech and remarked, &quot;We expect
our Supreme Court justices to be the most secular of our public
servants.&quot;[10] <b><i>We</i></b>? Where in our
Declaration of Independence and Constitution is it written that
judges must be less endowed with a sense of religious conviction
than other officials? The professor could only have been speaking
for that group of Americans who agree with <I>his</I> own expectation.
Most Americans <i>still</i> believe that every citizen, regardless
of their religious belief, is equal before the law. It is that
very equality -- the right of Christians to bring their full convictions
into the public square -- that Justice Scalia, and we at FRC, believe is 
under attack.

<p>

Don't let me leave the impression here that Scalia was without
defenders. Among them was syndicated newspaper columnist Cal Thomas,
who eloquently reminded readers that it was a rather
well-known &quot;public servant,&quot; Abraham Lincoln, who said,
&quot;But for this Book [the Bible], we would not know right from
wrong.&quot;[11]

<p>

Is there a difference between Presidents and Supreme Court Justices
in this regard? Our history and tradition say otherwise. The
Supreme Court begins each day of oral argument with the bailiff
stating, &quot;God save this honorable court.&quot; As you enter
the Supreme Court building, there is, on the right side of
the portico, a statue of Moses holding aloft the tablet of the
Ten Commandments.

<p>

The critics say, &quot;Those are mere symbols, devoid of meaning.&quot;
They believe that Scalia crossed a line that Justices must never 
cross -- expressing his religious faith. But once again, they 
don't know our history! Justices of our Supreme Court have time 
and again pronounced themselves about religious faith in general 
and Christianity in particular.

<p>

John Jay, the first Chief Justice, said in 1777:

<p><blockquote>

<i>Providence has given to our people the choice of their rulers,
and it is the duty, as well as the privilege and the interest, of a 
Christian nation to select and prefer Christians for their rulers.</i>[12]

</blockquote><p>

Imagine any public official saying something similar today! No
Christian leader or politician would echo Jay's observation today,
but the point is, such beliefs were not extraordinary among the
men and women who founded this nation. Daniel Webster is esteemed
as one of the five greatest senators in U.S. history, by resolution
of the Senate.[13] At the bicentennial of the Pilgrims' landing at
Plymouth Rock in 1620, Webster's keynote address included these
words:

<p><blockquote>

<i>Our ancestors established their system of government on morality
and religious sentiment. Moral habits, they believed, cannot safely be 
trusted on any other foundation than religious principle, nor any 
government be secure which is not supported by moral habits. Whatever 
makes men Christians, makes them good citizens.</i>[14]

</blockquote><p>

In July 1835, when Chief Justice John Marshall died, the Liberty
Bell was rung, sustaining the crack that is one of the keys to
its fame.[15] Are American traditions affronted by the fact that the
Liberty Bell, one of a handful of supposedly secular American
&quot;shrines,&quot; bears the words of Leviticus 25:10: &quot;Proclaim
liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof&quot;?
In 1852, Justice John McLean wrote a letter asserting that &quot;Aside
from Revelation, darkness rests upon the world and upon the future.
The Bible has shed a glorious light upon the world.&quot;[16]

<p>

To all of these examples, dozens more could be added, from
Lincoln to McKinley to Coolidge, to TR and FDR, to John F. Kennedy,
to Jimmy Carter, to Ronald Reagan. Candid assertions of the importance
of religious beliefs to democratic institutions transcend partisan
divisions. It was Justice William O. Douglas, perhaps the Supreme
Court's leading liberal for nearly four decades, who wrote
that, &quot;We are a religious people whose institutions
presuppose a Supreme Being.&quot;[17]

<p>

In short, what Justice Scalia said is in keeping with
a long line of statements by American jurists and statesmen. But
what about the substance of what he said? Do Christians face any
special level of scorn in modern society? Sadly, I believe they
do. Among the Beltway publications, the liberal <I>Washington Post</I>
published the most hostile appraisal of Scalia's speech. Of course, 
just a few years ago, they printed a front-page story suggesting 
that Christian voters are &quot;poor, uneducated and easily led.&quot;

<p>

Just a few weeks ago, the <I>Los Angeles Times</I> printed a cartoon
showing a crucified Bob Dole. A crown of thorns was depicted lacing
his head, with the crown composed of letters spelling out, &quot;Christian
Coalition.&quot;[18] That same paper, on Easter Sunday, refused to
print the regular Johnny Hart comic strip called &quot;B.C.&quot;
because it referred positively to the Resurrection of Christ.
&quot;B.C.&quot; was out, and PC, political correctness, was in!

<p>

Perhaps the real scourges in our society today are reserved for
sincere religious believers <I>of any kind</I>. Consider what
happened to Marian P. MacDonald and Teen Challenge. Marian spent
32 years building an outstanding record as a public school teacher
in Greensboro, North Carolina. She was forced to resign her post
last month under pressure from the school system. The reason?
She invited members of Teen Challenge to one of her health and
physical education classes. Teen Challenge is an extremely effective
drug rehabilitation organization that incorporates religious principles
in its program.

<p>

The visiting teens told MacDonald's class they believed God had
helped them overcome drug abuse, but added, &quot;We are not here
to push our religion off on anybody.&quot; Apparently, that disclaimer
was not enough. The school principal sent a note home to parents
apologizing for the teens' &quot;insensitive comments.&quot; An
investigation followed, and MacDonald was essentially fired.[19] 
Stories like this are all too common.

<p>

I believe that Justice Scalia, whose sense of fairness and level
of scholarship are without match in the federal judiciary, has paid
religion the high compliment of taking it seriously. As I reported
to you last month, Christian convictions <I>are</I> cause for
persecution in many lands around the globe. Bigotry against
Christians in American, by comparison, seems mild; but that bigotry
is real nonetheless. Moreover, the aggressive, secularizing forces
in our nation today are committed to keeping you and me out of 
government, law, and the public debate on all the great issues.

<p>

True religious tolerance <i>is</i> the American way. But Justice
Scalia's critics would have you believe that the sanctity of human
life, traditional marriage, equal access of religious speakers
to the public square, and dozens of other ideas are merely a religious
creed and not the common code of civilization. In a healthy society,
Scalia's articulation of his private thoughts in the setting of
a private prayer breakfast would not have been news. That
they are news at all tells us a great deal about the crisis facing
America today.

<p>

I can assure you that, with your help, the Family Research Council
will continue to speak calmly, but passionately, in behalf of
moral values and true religious liberty. We hold with Daniel Webster
that good Christianity and good citizenship go hand in hand. And
we invite all Americans of goodwill to join with us in honoring
and preserving the values of family, faith and freedom.

<p>

Sincerely,

<p><br>

Gary L. Bauer<br>
President

<p>

P.S. We'd love to hear from you this month. Many of you are already
aware of the &quot;Compact with Our Fellow Americans&quot; included
in my book <I>Our Hopes, Our Dreams.</I> The Compact is designed
to renew the spirit of cooperation among our citizens. Its final
provision states, &quot;In our personal lives, we promise to honor
the Creator, who made us and endowed us with such unalienable
rights as life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. We will
practice our faith on a daily basis and will gather with others
to worship regularly. Without resorting to coercion or vilification,
we will encourage faith, and the fruits of faith, in others.&quot;

<p>

Just check the enclosed reply card if you would like a free copy
of the Compact, suitable for framing. Thank you for your support
of our efforts on behalf of America's families and for reading
my letter this month. God bless you.

</center>

Since 1991, Kristi Hamrick has served the Family Research Council 
as director of communications, aggressively taking the pro-family 
message forward both in paid media (advertising) and earned media 
(news).  Mrs. Hamrick manages a broad operation that handles all 
in-coming requests from the news media -- from CNN to <I>The New 
York Times</I> -- and out-going media strategy, developing the 
framework for taking the pro-family message nationwide, via 
television, radio and print, and through such vehicles as op-ed 
articles or policy pieces.

<p>

The news operation at FRC, a pro-family policy and lobbying group, 
works to respond to breaking events and to look ahead at the trends 
that are shaping the American family.  The goal is to influence the 
cultural mindset by taking part in every pro-family debate as it 
happens.  Mrs. Hamrick is a spokesperson for FRC as well as a 
representative of the organization at events and conferences. She 
debates regularly on television, and her appearances include ABC's 
<i>Good Morning America, CBS This Morning</i>, NBC's <i>Today Show, 
The Montel Williams Show, Fox News</i>, CNN's <i>Jesse Jackson Both 
Sides</i> and numerous other CNN programs.  Her articles have appeared 
in <a href="/townhall/FRC/whois/hamdoc.html"><I>USA Today</I></a>, 
and she has been quoted nationwide, in publications including the 
<I>New York Times, Washington Post, Wall Street Journal, Washington 
Times, USA Today, Boston Globe</I>, Gannett News, Knight Ridder News, 
and The Associated Press. Her voice can be heard daily on radio 
programs throughout the United States.

<p>

As part of the coordinated FRC effort, Mrs. Hamrick also develops 
media strategies as part of FRC's work in government relations, 
grassroots coalition building, research and policy development, 
corporate and community outreach and publication marketing.

<p>

Before joining FRC in 1991, Mrs. Hamrick worked as press secretary 
in the Hopkins for Governor Campaign.  Mrs. Hamrick was a spokesperson 
for the campaign and directed the media operation for the U.S. 
congressman from Kentucky when he won his primary bid. Earlier in her 
career, Mrs. Hamrick also worked in the press operations of the late 
U.S. Senator John Heinz and Senator Arlen Specter, both of Pennsylvania.

<p>

Most of Mrs. Hamrick's experience is in the media.  In Washington, 
D.C., she was an on-air correspondent for CBN News Washington, D.C. 
Bureau, covering social issues.  In print, Mrs. Hamrick worked for 
<I>The Muncie Star</I>, covering courts, crime and politics, after 
completing a Pulliam Fellowship at <I>The Indianapolis Star</I>. In 
fact, Mrs. Hamrick worked her way through college as a writer and 
journalist.  She continues the crafts of a wordsmith, working on 
occassion as a freelance journalist.

<p>

Mrs. Hamrick's extensive speaking experience includes many appearances 
in schools and colleges.  She also taught news writing and advanced 
news writing at Ball State University in Indiana.

<p>

Mrs. Hamrick graduated <I>cum laude</I> and with honors in 
communications from Anderson University in Anderson, Ind. She and 
her husband, Michael Hamrick, reside in Northern Virginia.

<title>Gary Bauer's October, 1996 Letter</title>

<body>

<center><h2>A Message From Gary L. Bauer</h2></center>

<p><hr width=75% height=2><p>

October 16, 1996

<p>

Dear Friend,

<p>

<i>Last month, just before the Congress adjourned, the Senate held its 
historic debate on partial-birth abortion.  At the end of an incredible 
day on Capitol Hill, I sat down at 1:00 o'clock in the morning to write 
you this "eyewitness account"</i>:

<p>

It's nearly 1:00 o'clock in the morning as I write this month's letter to 
you. I have just finished an unbelievable 20-hour day in which my emotions 
have run the gamut from exhilaration to deep despair.  The focus of 
today's events was the vote in the United States Senate to overturn 
President Clinton's veto of the partial-birth abortion bill. We lost that 
vote, but in the process we may have taken a giant step toward stopping the 
ongoing tragedy of abortion on demand.  Let me share with you a few excerpts 
from the roller coaster ride I was on today as we spoke the truth about the 
sanctity of human life to the powerful elites here in Washington, D.C.

<p>

My day began on the <i>CBS Morning News</i>, where I debated Kate Michelman 
of the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League.  As is 
usually the case, the morning talk shows only give us four or five minutes 
to present our views on an issue -- this morning was no exception.  I knew 
I had to have my arguments down pat, for there is little time to hesitate 
or reflect when you're sitting in a TV studio under a bank of hot 
lights.  I also knew a sharp debater like Michelman would be sure to 
quickly fill any time I didn't use.

<p>

I often feel frustrated after such a debate because I don't usually get 
enough time to fully express my views or because I don't think of the 
best way to articulate some arguments until the debate is over.  But 
this morning was a "home run."  The CBS anchorwoman was fair, and she 
gave me equal time.  I was able to establish for the millions of people 
watching that partial-birth abortions <i>do</i> occur thousands of times a 
year -- most of them for purely elective reasons rather than because of 
health problems of the mother or her baby.  Kate Michelman presented few 
relevant arguments and seemed unusually low-key.  It had to be tough for 
her to defend the position that it could ever be okay to abort a baby in the 
eighth or ninth month of pregnancy by stabbing it in the back of the head.

<p>

But there was no time to relish the debate victory. I was immediately 
rushed from the CBS studio to attend an extraordinary prayer breakfast 
on Capitol Hill.  Pro-life senators led by Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania 
hosted the gathering to pray that senators' hearts would be touched 
before they voted.  The solemn gathering in that small room included 
some of the real "stars" of the pro-family/pro-life movement -- proven 
crusaders like Chuck Colson and my good friend and colleague Jim Dobson 
of Focus on the Family. We took turns asking God for His wisdom and 
strength for the tough hours of lobbying ahead.  More importantly, we 
prayed that God would have mercy on our country as it slips further 
and further into the culture of death.

<p>

A few minutes after breakfast, the ecumenical group gathered again -- 
this time in the office of Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott.  There 
we participated in a press conference on the upcoming vote.  Fourteen 
pro-life leaders made individual statements before a bank of TV cameras 
and a forest of microphones.  The room was jammed from one wall to the 
other, and the hot TV lights glared down on us all.  We were expecting 
the usual hostility of the liberal Washington media.  But again, 
strangely, there were no real arguments -- no hardball questions. Only 
one reporter even asked a question, and I was given the opportunity to 
answer.  He asked whether I was satisfied with the attention Bob Dole 
had paid to the issue. My response was clear: I told the reporter 
that Bob Dole was not responsible for partial-birth abortions.  I said 
we were here because Bill Clinton had vetoed a bill passed overwhelmingly 
by the Congress to stop these horrible procedures.  I then urged Senator 
Dole in the remaining days of the campaign to emphasize the issue and to 
draw the stark comparison between himself and his opponent so the 
American people could clearly understand their choice.

<p>

After the press conference, we all fanned out on Capitol Hill to buttonhole 
lawmakers.  We met Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania as he got off the 
Capitol subway, and, even though he is usually pro-abortion, we ultimately 
won his vote. A few minutes later, we encountered Senator Joe Biden of 
Delaware, and he ended up voting with us too.  Unfortunately, other senators 
were harder to convince.  Senator Nancy Kassebaum of Kansas refused to hear 
us out when we appealed to her in the Senate dining room.  She said she 
didn't even think the Senate should be discussing the issue.  My good 
friend Kay James, who is a black American, told Mrs. Kassebaum that she was 
glad that her attitude didn't prevail in our country when slavery was 
being debated over 100 years ago!

<p>

As we walked the halls of the Capitol, the abortion debate was raging on 
the floor of the Senate.  Good friends, senators like Dan Coats of Indiana, 
John Ashcroft of Missouri and Don Nickles of Oklahoma, led the floor debate 
while a hushed gallery of visitors looked on.  The pro-abortion side was 
led by Barbara Boxer of California.

<p>

We sat in the Senate gallery together to watch the proceedings -- myself, 
Dr. Dobson, Kay, Beverly LaHaye of Concerned Women for America, Anthony 
Cardinal Bevilacqua of Philadelphia, Rabbi Daniel Lapin and a dozen other 
allies.  As I looked around, I couldn't help but wonder what was going on 
in the minds of tourists from all over America who had brought their 
children there with them.  They seemed subdued, almost shocked, as they 
heard senators describe this terrible procedure.  At one emotional moment, 
one pro-life senator pointed to a picture of a baby and shouted in 
exasperation, "This is not an appendix; this is not a lump of tissue; this 
is a baby!"  Here's what happened next as reported by <i>The Washington 
Post</i>:

<p><blockquote>

<i>And then, impossibly, in an already hushed gallery, in one of 
those moments when the floor of the Senate looks like a stage set, with its 
rich wooden desks somehow too small for the matters at hand, the cry of a 
baby pierced the room, echoing across the chamber from an outside hallway.

<p>

No one mentioned the cry, but for a few seconds no one spoke at all.</i>

</blockquote><p>

No one knows whose baby it was that brought the Senate to silence that day, 
but I can't help but believe that God chose that moment for this child to 
cry and, by so doing, to remind the Senate that "choice" in this case means 
the death of <b>real</b> human beings.

<p>

Soon the voting began.  As I am sure you know by now, our efforts helped 
win a clear majority, but we still fell short of the 66 votes needed to 
overturn Clinton's veto.  It was a tragic day, but even in the midst of 
our disappointment and heartbreak, there were some encouraging developments. 
I am convinced that something is stirring among God's people.  The 
cooperation of a large number of religious leaders from different 
denominations and from all parts of the country was unprecedented.  I'm 
convinced, too, that a new level of coalition building has been achieved 
and that the groundwork has been laid for better communication and 
cooperation in the future.

<p>

As the day wore on, my message was the same in every press interview. I 
told reporter after reporter that America is better than the vote that just 
took place.  I also told them that our nation was founded as a "shining 
city on a hill", that we are a unique experiment in liberty under God 
with rights and responsibilities that come only from Him. And this vote 
to allow the outright killing of nearly-born children through the promotion 
of abortion-on-demand sticks in our throats.  It will never go down easy 
with Americans because it violates every tenet of our founding.  Our 
conscience will not rest easy as long as we continue to allow the sacrifice 
of these children.

<p>

More than ever, I believe our beloved nation is at a crossroads, with the 
question Lincoln posed at Gettysburg still before us. As he stood on 
hallowed ground, he said we were conceived in liberty and asked whether 
"this nation or any nation so conceived and so dedicated can long endure?"

<p>

This is the great question facing our nation as we go into the next century. 
How we resolve the issues of life, family and marriage will determine whether 
America during the next century can still be that "shining city on a hill".

<p>

Even though the hour is late for our country, we must never cease our efforts 
to protect our spiritual heritage.  As God told Solomon, "if my people, who 
are called by my name, will humble themselves and pray and seek my face and 
turn from their wicked ways, then will I hear from heaven and will forgive 
their sin and will heal their land." (II Chronicles 7:14 NIV) We must 
redouble our prayers seeking God's mercy as the elites of our nation look 
farther away from Him. I want you to know that my staff and I are committed 
to do everything in our power to defend the values that have made our 
country great.

<p>

The Family Research Council is here to represent and serve you.  But I have 
to be honest. In recent weeks we haven't been hearing from enough of you. 
We need your encouragement, and your prayers, and we need to know if you 
stand with us in the battle for family, faith and freedom.  We also pray 
that, if you are able, you will choose to help FRC financially, <b>after</b> 
you have met the needs of your family and your church.

<p>

In closing, it's my prayer that God will richly bless you and your family. 
I look forward to hearing from you soon.

<p>

Sincerely,

<p><br>

Gary L. Bauer<br>
President

<p>

P.S. FRC is preparing a special analysis of the upcoming elections

<title>Gary Bauer's November, 1996 Letter</title>

<body>

<center><h2>A Message From Gary L. Bauer</h2></center>

<p><hr width=75% height=2><p>

November 6, 1996

<p>

Dear Friend,

<p>

I know that your first reaction to yesterday's election returns 
is to be disheartened. I found myself recalling the words of Thomas 
Jefferson, who suggested that we should tremble for our country as 
we consider that God is just.

<p>

But, my friends, as people of faith devoted to the family, there must 
be no room in our hearts for demoralization.  It is not just that 
there were many bright spots on Election Day, including the 
strengthening of pro-family forces in Congress.  No, it's the fact 
that we are obliged in conscience to carry on our fight for the family, 
no matter what one day's election returns suggest. The worst thing we 
could do now is to retreat from the public square.  Instead we must 
advance the pro-family banner boldly and without shame.  I have hope 
for the future -- because the truth is on our side, 
the lessons of history are on our side, and, I believe, the will of 
the people is on our side.

<p>

I am not naive.  In the coming year, the principles that unite us -- 
traditional values, the sanctity of human life, smaller government, 
and lower taxes -- will be under political and cultural attack as 
never before. Regarding these threats, I can speak only for me and my 
"house" at the Family Research Council: "We will redouble our efforts to 
speak for your values and to bring the truth to the American people."

<p>

With that in mind, as election day approached, my staff and I put 
together a six-point plan of action.  Today, as the final vote is 
still being tallied we begin to implement this plan, with you at our side.

<p><ul>

<li>Pro-family Americans have been too passive -- not <i>too active</i>! -- 
in their approach to public life.  Too often we've waited for our party system 
to produce for us candidates who will subscribe to some portion of our 
world view, candidates who, by design and default, always seem to fail 
us at the finish line.  The truth is, our movement should be producing 
and promoting leaders of its own.  I want you to know that achieving 
this goal is at the top of my personal priorities for the coming year. 
In my capacity as a private citizen, I will be organizing a political 
action committee, which I believe you'll be hearing a lot about in 
the near future.

<p>

<li>Each month 250,000 American homes receive our monthly publication, 
<i>Washington Watch</i>.  With your help, <b>FRC will double the 
circulation of this publication within the next 12 months</b>. Early 
next year <b>FRC will unveil a new and expanded version of <i>Watch</i></b>. 
We must make it our goal <b>to reach every American home in which 
there still burns a spark of love for this land Lincoln called 
"the last, best hope of Earth."</b>

<p>

<li>FRC will launch a youth leadership program here in Washington, 
D.C.  If the family is to survive (my friends, it <i>will</i> survive), 
if religious values are not to be completely routed from the public 
square (my friends, they <i>will</i> not), <b>we must act now to foster a 
new generation of leaders with a profoundly Christian world view.</b> The 
darker this night of cultural amorality becomes, the more youthful 
flames we must light that will kindle hope for our country.

<p>

<li>Our very self-government is at stake when the acts of duly elected 
legislatures, or of the people themselves, to restrict abortion, protect 
parental rights, and safeguard the institution of marriage are trampled 
by our runaway judges.  Judicial tyranny must end.  I pledge to you 
today <b>a sweeping campaign to check and balance our out-of-control 
courts.</b> We must become again a people who insist that <b>no one govern 
us without our consent.</b>

<p>

<li>The power to tax is the power to destroy.  How many of our 
government's destructive schemes would be possible if it did not 
seize nearly 45 cents of every dollar that hardworking families 
earn? There will be no freedom without tax freedom. <b>Today I am 
launching, in partnership with key economic conservative organizations, 
a massive push for across-the-board tax relief.</b> We will begin with 
tax credits for families with children and end the double taxation 
that occurs when government taxes the estates our families have 
shored up over a lifetime of sweat and sacrifice. <b>Our families 
built this capital; the meddling Washington establishment must be 
stopped from hauling it away.</b>

<p>

<li>Early in the new year, FRC will convene a summit of leaders of 
major pro-family groups and religious leaders who share our profound 
concern for the cultural decay now gripping the Western world. We will 
pool ideas and, where possible, resources to provide an effective 
counter to the forces of cultural disintegration.  Our response will be 
as global as the threat we face.  In the coming months and years, it is 
imperative that pro-family groups work together. <b>I pledge my total 
effort to help achieve this goal.</b>

</ul><p>

One final word. I do not view these steps as an ambitious plan. This 
is the <b>minimum</b> we must do to give this generation, and the next 
generation, of American families a fighting chance.  I cannot promise 
you we will succeed at everything we do, but I can promise you that we 
will try as never before. FRC has been positioned -- I pray by 
God's grace -- in the nation's capital to be here for the family at 
such a time as this.

<p>

In the coming days, please consider this plan and let me know if I have 
your support.  Your prayers and encouragement mean so much, and your 
financial support is FRC's very lifeblood.  I know that you are counting 
on the Family Research Council.  We will do everything we can to be worthy 
of the trust you place in us. God bless you.

<p>

Sincerely,

<p><br>

Gary L. Bauer<br>
President

<title>Gary Bauer's September, 1996 Letter</title>

<body>

<center><h2>A Message From Gary L. Bauer</h2></center>

<p><hr width=75% height=2><p>

September 13, 1996

<p><br><br>

<ul><ul>

<i>Restoring parental rights to their original firm foundation
in U.S. constitutional law is crucial to our overall efforts to
reinvigorate the democratic ideal of citizenship.</i>

</ul></ul>

<p><center>

-- from <i><b>FRC's Moms' and Dads' School Survival Guide</b></i>

</center><p>

Dear Friend:

<p>

A few weeks ago Carol and I drove our oldest daughter, Elyse,
back to college for her second year of studies.  It was wonderful
to have her home for the summer, and saying good-bye was really
hard.  The summer months flew by, reminding us once more how precious
is the time that we have together as a family.  Even though Elyse
attends college only a few hours' drive from our home outside
Washington, D.C. -- close enough for us to see her on some weekends -- 
she's still much farther away than we would prefer.

<p>

Millions of families go through this emotional ritual each September,
and it doesn't really matter that much whether your child is heading
off to college, high school, or to a nearby elementary school
classroom.  Each fall mothers and fathers face the same anxieties
and pressures:  how will my children fare in school?  Will their
teachers recognize their special qualities?  Will teachers honor
and respect their talents and beliefs or will they try to convince
them to &quot;question authority&quot; and reject the values they
have been taught?  What about their classmates?  Will they make
friends?  Will those friends help uphold their faith?  Or will
their faith be weakened?  Or worse, will our children be lead
into trouble?  Is there anyone out there besides us who really
understands the worth of our beloved children?

<p>

Today, questions like these are being asked by every parent and
they unfortunately have a special sharpness to them.  Many of
our nation's schools are no longer the &quot;common ground&quot;
of shared values and aspirations that generations of families
counted on them to be in the past. All too often, today's classrooms
are laboratories for radical ideological experimentation. The
teaching profession has been politicized as never before. Textbooks
and lesson plans routinely foster a liberal world view. Attempts
to isolate, intimidate and confuse religiously inclined students
continue. Violence and illegal drugs are found even in elementary
schools. The &quot;safe sex&quot; philosophy still dominates
sex education.

<p>

I'm sure you're familiar with the statistics on educational decline,
so I won't repeat them here.  The public education establishment
routinely goes out of its way to question the depth of the problem,
but, in the same breath, rushes to endorse the latest reform plan,
a tacit admission that our schools are falling short.  Let me
be especially clear here:  many, if not most, of our teachers
are dedicated educators who are motivated by a love of learning
and of children.  Many, if not most, are disturbed by the same
education fads that distress parents.  Like parents, these teachers
are ill-served by education leaders who are constantly reinventing
the wheel and interfering with what works in real classrooms.

<p>

In fact, the education policy debate of the last few years has
been dominated by the <I>illusion</I> of reform. With every fiber
of their being, the leadership of the nation's massive teachers'
unions, the National Education Association (2.2 million members)
and the American Federation of Teachers (900,000), have opposed
nearly every change in the way our schools are financed and operated.

<p>

Bogus education reform schemes come and go.  Many of them have
impressive-sounding names and a stellar line-up of sponsors.
Desperate for signs of improvement that will give their children
hope, parents are sold various reform packages under such brand
names as Outcome-Based Education, Goals 2000, character education,
mandatory voluntarism, New American Schools and restructuring.
These schemes have different details, but they have at least
two omissions in common:  they leave the basic method of funding
public education untouched, and they leave parents at the margin
of education decision-making.

<p>

The Family Research Council (FRC) is keenly aware of the concerns
expressed by America's families about education, and we are dedicated
to reversing these omissions.  We want parents to control their
education dollars.  We believe that the same hands that rock the
cradle, smooth the fevered brow, set the table, and clothe the
child should direct the funds that educate the child.  The centerpiece
of our campaign for education reform is massive tax relief for
families with children, coupled with genuine parental choice policies
that enable parents to select the school their children will attend.

<p>

Today, more than ever before, I am optimistic about our chances
for success.  School choice plans are gaining momentum and making
headway.  A new study by Harvard's Paul Peterson and Jay P. Greene
at the University of Houston shows that the City of Milwaukee's
parental choice plan has resulted in real academic gains for the
children enrolled in the program.  In August, state courts in
Ohio upheld the constitutionality of a school choice program that
includes religious schools.  Tax credits for families with children
will now be a centerpiece of this year's election debate.

<p>

Most importantly, I'm encouraged that, in the true spirit of
America, parents are not waiting for politicians to respond to
their needs.  They are moving in pioneering numbers to options
like homeschooling, classical education and parent-based education,
which are not so much novelties as rediscoveries of the art of
family-centered teaching and learning.  At the center of all of
this is spiritual renewal, the faith that moves mountains.

<p>

With all of the forces at work in today's education debate, FRC
has developed the <I>Moms' and Dads' School Survival Guide</I>.
This 64-page booklet is packed with resources to help you through
the coming school year.  Between its covers you'll find:

<p><ul>

<li>A glossary of education jargon -- what do the fancy terms 
<I>really</I> mean?

<p>

<li>Feature articles on major topics like Outcome-Based Education,
the religious rights of students, and parental rights in today's
schools.

<p>

<li>Addresses and phone numbers of key resources for homeschooling
and classical education.

<p>

<li>A reference section containing everything from newsletter sources
to web sites dealing with education issues.

</ul><p>

Our <I>Survival Guide</I> is designed to put a wealth of helpful
information at your fingertips.  It's yours for a donation of
any amount -- please use the enclosed reply card to order your copy
today.

<p>

I had intended this letter to deal solely with education issues,
but drug abuse and educational failure feed off one another.
There is no way to dismiss the disturbing statistics: in the
war against teenage drug abuse, America is in full retreat. A
new federal survey shows that teen drug use has risen 105 percent
since 1992.  The sharp increases span every form of illegal drug.
Use of LSD and other hallucinogens is up 183 percent; cocaine
use, 166 percent (from 1994 to 1995 alone); marijuana, 105 percent.
One of every 10 teenagers has used an illegal drug in the past
month.

<p>

The tragedy here is that these numbers come after a decade of
progress.  By 1992, teen drug use had been driven to its lowest
point in decades.  The reason for that progress was and is easy
to understand. Our nation's policy was direct -- and repeated over
and over again in every forum where young people gather.  It said:
&quot;Drug abuse is wrong, dangerous, and stupid.&quot;  But
then, following a change in the Oval Office, we changed course.

<p>

The flow of anti-drug messages from our nation's capital dried
up.  The Clinton administration cut the office of National Drug
Control Policy some 83 percent.  MTV, and even the networks, began
to produce material that winked at the drug threat, or openly
declared the war on drugs a failure. Leaders in Congress turned
their attention to other issues. Treatment funds were reduced,
and &quot;civil libertarians&quot; ratcheted up their pressure
on highly effective social agencies like Teen Challenge that use
faith-based messages to help teenagers and young adults kick the
habit.

<p>

Let me say something here about the liberal versus conservative
debate about the treatment versus law enforcement approaches to
drug abuse.  In fact, let me say one word about it -- it is a 
<I>fallacy.</I> Both approaches are needed.  Drug abusers need treatment
if they are to re-enter society as productive citizens.  But the
truth is that even the best treatment programs are only partially
successful. Preventing the abuser from taking that first hit,
snort, or injection is crucial.

<p>

Who would propose that we eliminate hospital emergency rooms
to treat automobile accident victims?  No one, of course.  Then
again, who would argue that we eliminate speed limits, safety
belts, guard rails, and the like because, after all, we have emergency
rooms? But that's precisely what advocates of drug legalization
argue! Remember when then-Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders suggested
that problems like crime would be reduced if America legalized
drug use, saying it was time to study this option and rely on
treatment rather than law enforcement?

<p>

Elders, thankfully, is gone, but the legacy of permissiveness
she represented is reflected in what is happening now to our youth.
Last month, my senior adviser for drug issues, retired Army Lieutenant
Colonel Bob Maginnis, met with General Barry McCaffrey, President
Clinton's drug czar.  Gen. McCaffrey is a dedicated man, but he
has his work cut out for him.  FRC offered the general our heartfelt
support and suggested various ways to recapture the initiative.
New efforts to control the flow of drugs through Mexico and out
of Colombia are especially needed.

<p>

Again, we must not settle for illusion.  Attempting to treat
an ever-rising wave of drug-abusing youth will destroy our economy
and bankrupt this nation -- and, worst of all, waste the potential
of thousands of our children. Attempting to reform education
without putting parents back at the center of school decision-making
is doomed to fail as well. As always, on both of these issues,
FRC will continue to fight for the home truths that really matter:
we will work with legislators, government officials -- anyone of
goodwill, regardless of party -- who recognizes the need to strengthen
our education system and to gird our children against the sex-and-drug
culture.

<p>

We would really like to hear from you this month.  Your financial
gifts to FRC provide the lifeblood that enables us to advance
the pro-family cause.  Your prayers and involvement are essential,
too.  The cards and letters we receive provide a tremendous lift
to me and the entire FRC staff.  Because the work we do is both
draining and difficult, being able to associate names and faces
with the cause we are advancing makes our efforts all the more
meaningful.

<p>

Once again, thank you for your faithfulness.  As we continue
to work together, we can move closer to our hope and dream of
family renewal in our beloved nation.

<p>

Sincerely,

<p><br>

Gary L. Bauer<br>
President

<p>

P.S. As our <I>Survival Guide</I> illustrates, FRC is constantly
developing new materials that make the case for family values.
Let me close by mentioning another resource that you've helped
to make a household word: <I>Our Hopes, Our Dreams.</I> This
companion book to the family values debate of 1996 has now reached
a total distribution of nearly 400,000 copies.

<p>

I conceived <I>Our Hopes, Our Dreams</I> as a vision for a pro-family
future -- a book that would make the case for our cause to a cross-section
of the American public. Earlier this year, FRC took out paid
advertising posing a challenge to Hillary Rodham Clinton, who
had just released her book, <I>It Takes a Village.</I> We asked
the American people to choose between the alternative visions
represented by these books.  I'm pleased to report that, thanks
to support like yours, <I>Our Hopes, Our Dreams</I> has held its
own in this contest of visions.

<p>

Our original goal was to distribute 1,000,000 copies of <I>Our
Hopes, Our Dreams,</I> and to get them into the hands of people
who may not know just how much today's cultural clash over the
family means to them. If you can help us make one last push to
reach this goal and to spread the pro-family message, please take
this opportunity to do so. The enclosed card has all the information
you need.

Early in 1995, Miss Marshall joined the Family Research Council's 
public policy team to contribute her research skills and experience 
in the field of welfare. Her responsibilities as policy analyst 
include tracking, analyzing, and writing about proposed legislation 
on welfare reform. In addition, her analysis and research benefit 
FRC in educating key decision makers in the U.S. Congress and at the 
grass roots nation-wide.

<p>

Through her studies at Rice University, in various internships 
throughout her undergraduate experience, and most recently, at the 
American Enterprise Institute with Charles Murray, Marshall has 
developed a keen understanding of compassionate welfare reform and 
school choice as well as a familiarity with the U.S. Congress and 
the formulation of public policy. 

<p>

Miss Marshall began her career in Washington as an intern in the 
Office of Congressman Tom DeLay in the summer months of 1990 and 
1991. In 1992, she served an extended internship in the White 
House Office of Political Affairs during the critical months of 
the campaign. She moved on to work in the Office of the Deputy 
Convention Manager at the 1992 Republican National Convention, with 
particular responsibility for caucus teams. Since then, she has worked 
in the Houston office of George Bush and, in 1993, in the office of 
the Deputy Executive Director at the National Republican Senatorial 
Committee.

<p>

Through the years, she has volunteered time for local Republican 
party activities and campaigns, both local and Presidential. Her 
campaign experience includes a stint as opposition research 
coordinator for a Congressional candidate in Houston. 

<p>

Native of Texas, Marshall graduated <I>Summa Cum Laude</I> from Rice 
University in 1994 with majors in Policy Studies and English. She is 
a member of Phi Beta Kappa and Rice Fellow.

<A HREF="/townhall/FRC/insight/is95c2dr.html">Legalization of Drugs: 
The Myths and The Facts</a>: an article by Robert L. Maginnis

<p>

After a distinguished career in the U.S. military, Lieutenant 
Colonel Robert (Bob) L. Maginnis, USA Ret., joined the Family 
Research Council in 1994 to handle one of the most difficult 
social problems facing American society and American families 
today -- the crisis of crime.  In addition, Colonel Maginnis' 
skills as an analyst, writer, speaker and team leader will be 
applied to family issues impacted by military/foreign affairs 
policy and cultural issues. Already nationally known as an expert 
on the Pentagon and a spokesman on military issues, Colonel 
Maginnis brings to FRC a broad perspective on today's toughest 
issues.

<p>

In his many roles, Colonel Maginnis has appeared on ABC, NBC and 
CBS evening news shows, CBS "This Morning," "The MacNeil/Lehrer 
Newshour," CNBC "Cal Thomas," CNN's "Crossfire" and "Larry King 
Live" as well as other programs, such as "Donohue," and on numerous 
networks.  He has been quoted many times in newspapers across the 
country from the <I>New York Times</I> to the <I>LA Times</I>.  
His editorial pieces have been published in the <I>Washington 
Times, Orange County Register, Chicago Tribune, The Miami Herald</I> 
and elsewhere. And the colonel has been featured on most major radio 
shows nationwide.

<p>

In July 1993, Colonel Maginnis retired from an assignment in 
the Pentagon where he served as an Inspector General.  He is 
an airborne-ranger infantry officer with an assignment history 
that includes Korea, Germany, Alaska, and several posts in the 
continental United States.  He served in command and staff 
positions in four infantry divisions from platoon to division 
level.  The colonel was the chief for the U.S. Army Infantry 
School's leadership training branch.  He developed curricula, 
taught, participated in leader development research and consulted 
with leaders and soldiers throughout the Army. He is the author of 
more than fifty articles published in professional military 
journals concerning ethics, leadership, and personnel matters 
impacting the military.

<p>

In the last eight months of his military service, Colonel Maginnis 
was a member of the Army's study group examining the homosexual 
ban.  He also was advisor to the Defense Department Military 
Working Group on homosexuals in the military.  In that role, he 
debated the issue in the media as well as speaking in various forums 
-- including testifying before a House subcommittee. Because of his 
expertise, Colonel Maginnis is also, on occasion, a spokesman for 
the Defense Readiness Council, a non-profit organization that led 
the fight to keep the homosexual ban.

<p>

Colonel Maginnis' service in the armed forces was commended with 
the Legion of Merit, the highest peacetime decoration, as well as 
with five meritorious medals and four commendations. Among his over 
fifty letters of commendation is one from former President Jimmy 
Carter who honored the colonel for inventing a laser training 
device, at great savings to the armed forces.

<p>

Colonel Maginnis received his B.S. from the United States Military 
Academy, West Point, New York in 1973 and a M.S. from the Naval 
Postgraduate School, Monterey, California, in 1983.  He is also 
a graduate of many military schools, including the Command and 
General Staff College.

<p>

Long active in his community and in many organizations, the colonel 
now coordinates his church's participation in homeless shelters. 
He, his wife and two children live in Northern Virginia.

Each month, <a href="/townhall/FRC/whois/bauer.html">Gary L. 
Bauer</a>, President of the Family Research Council, writes a letter 
to the friends of FRC that highlights a current topic, analyzes a key 
family issue, or describes an ongoing or new activity of the Council. 
These personal letters both describe the FRC President's perspective 
on the most pressing family issues and chronicle the development of 
FRC projects and programs to address those issues. These letters give

EDO Marine and Aircraft Systems is  focused on defense products
and technologies for the United States as  well as foreign nations.
 These products and technologies represent the  principal mechanical
and electro-mechanical capabilities that reside  within EDO Corporation.
 
<P>
There are two major product lines within Marine and Aircraft Systems:
Mine Countermeasures and Suspension and Release Equipment for
military aircraft.   Both of these  areas require extensive engineering
expertise as well as fabrication and  systems integration capabilities.
 These product lines draw heavily on  the background and expertise
that EDO has developed in the aerospace  industry since its founding
in 1925. 
<P>
Another area that is developing into a separate product line is
Transportation.  EDO Marine and Aircraft Systems is able to  apply
certain electro-mechanical and electronic capabilities, originally
developed for military customers, to the transportation industry.

Since 1954, when EDO Corporation first established its piezoelectric
ceramics design and manufacturing capabilities, the company has
become the largest US based developer and producer of specialized
active piezoelectric ceramic components and devices. EDO produces
fourteen active piezoelectric material compositions and can produce
active ceramic material in virtually any shape and size. EDO continues
to aggressively research and develop new compositions to meet expanding market needs.
<P>
EDO Piezoelectric Products specializes in the development and
manufacture of piezoelectric actuators, sensors, transducers,
drive electronics and sub-systems for industrial, commercial,
medical and military applications.
<P>
EDO's Active Force Control Subsystem for Precision Machining is
currently under development. This system utilizes EDO's actuators,
sensors and electronics integrated into a grinding machine for
active force control while the machine is removing material. This
retrofitable subsystem will significantly enhance workpiece quality
and decrease throughput.

EDO Canada Ltd. is the manufacturer of the all composite EDO LiteRider&#174;
Compressed Natural Gas Vehicle (NGV) Cylinder. The introduction
of the LiteRider&#174; cylinder in 1993 represented a significant
breakthrough for an industry that had been burdened by heavy,
low volume steel and aluminum cylinders required to store CNG
on-board vehicles. At 1/3 the weight of traditional steel tanks
and 1/2 the weight of aluminum tanks wrapped with fiberglass,
the EDO cylinder is not only the lightest in the world, but also
holds up to 30% more fuel that any other cylinder on the market.
Certified to the highest standards for NGV cylinders
(AGA/ANSI NGV-2; CGA B51 Part 2), the cylinder also meets the
criteria established by the US Department of Transportation's
FMVSS Standard #304.
<P>
EDO Canada Ltd. is an ISO 9001 registered manufacturing plant
and a joint venture between majority shareholder EDO Corporation,
the Government of Alberta, Canada, Toray Industries Inc (Japan)
and Sumitomo Corporation (Japan).

<P>
<H3>To Our Shareholders</H3>

At last year's annual meeting, I reported our first quarter of positive earnings in two years. I expressed my hope that this reflected only the early impact of our strategic plan to return the company to profitability and strong liquidity, and that we would continue improvement throughout the year.<P>

We did show steady improvement in 1995, and I am very pleased to announce that the first quarter of 1996 continued the trend. We recorded our fifth consecutive quarter of increased earnings.  Revenues for the first quarter were $26,281,000, up 25.6%, from the first quarter of 1995, while earnings were $650,000 or $0.11/share up from $0.02/share the first quarter of 1995. Backlog increased to $95,760,000, up 7.6%, from the first quarter of 1995. This increase in backlog reflects, principally, contracts received from Hughes Space and Communications Company and Barry Controls. Both these awards are from major prime contractors with whom we hope to share in the growth of these two solid and growing markets.<P>

Early in the first quarter, we concluded the sale of our College Point, New York property which eliminated significant idle fixed assets and reduced operating expenses. This will improve our future balance sheet and operating results, while paving the way for additional, planned, consolidation of our operations. Our first quarter cash balance of $26.3 million provides a strong reserve and resources to operate our current businesses without the need for borrowing. We announced today that our bank has agreed to additional favorable revisions to the terms of our lending instruments.<P>

Now, a few comments about 1995 operations.<P>

Since our 1995 annual report gives details on operations, I will today highlight only some significant points which impact our current and future situation. Most importantly, 1995 was a year for improvements in almost all of our businesses. While revenues for the year were up only 1% to $91.1 million, we recorded a net profit of $1.4 million or $0.25 per share, compared to a loss of $23.9 million or $4.30 per share in 1994.  We achieved our primary goal of returning the corporation to profitability.<P>

We also achieved our second major goal of improved liquidity. We funded operations with internally generated cash flow and ended 1995 with a cash balance up 42% to $25.6 million.<P>

In late 1995, our line of credit was increased from $5.0 million to $15.0 million. We appreciate the show of confidence by our bank and the excellent working relationship we have developed. While we do not anticipate drawing down on the line for operations, we increased it in anticipation of the need for letters of credit to cover advanced payments on international orders. <P>

In 1995, we increased our equity by approximately 32% to $14.2 million and market capitalization increased 58% to $29 million at year end. We hope that the continued increases in our market capitalization, since the end of 1995, reflect a growing investor awareness of the inherent worth of our company.<P>

Year-end 1995 backlog was up to $89.7 million, a 13% increase over the prior year.  As announced today, backlog continued to increase during the first quarter. We believe the current backlog, and anticipated orders in 1996, demonstrate the strength of our core businesses and validate our strategy.<P>

The defense segment of our business performed very well, capturing new programs in a very competitive and declining market, yielding profits, producing good cash flow, and improving its backlog of orders by 22%.<P>

We received development, production and logistic support contracts in our stores release and airborne mine countermeasures product lines which are the bulk of this backlog.<P>

The use of commercial off-the-shelf (known as "COTS") components in military systems has been embraced by the U. S. Department of Defense and is gaining international acceptance.  We believe that we are a leading company in the use of COTS for military systems, giving us a cost advantage over competition which uses equipment built to military specifications. We have already captured significant defense contracts for COTS-configured systems.<P>

In 1995, we completed the consolidation of the command and control and sonar systems product lines at our Chesapeake, Virginia facility. Co-locating these staffs has facilitated our ability to offer a cost-effective COTS combat system. We will begin international marketing of this internally funded system in 1996.<P>

Our position as a market leader in satellite earth sensors was expanded, in 1995, with the award of a contract from Daimler-Benz Aerospace for sensors used on the Loral "Globalstar" cellular communication satellite. This important win adds another major satellite constellation to the already impressive list of satellites which depend on EDO sensors for attitude control. Consistent with our long-term strategy of expanding our market to related satellite navigation systems, this contract also includes the development of a new sun sensor.<P>

A major turning point, in 1995, was the turnaround in our space business. This business, which has been a financial drain in the past, improved significantly. With the completion of the most difficult development programs in 1995, we are entering the production phase in 1996. The concurrent transition to production of several programs will present a significant management challenge in 1996. We are giving a great deal of management attention to this challenge.<P>

Our program, to supply Doppler speedometers for use on New York City subways, has been a success.  In late 1995, we received a contract for additional speedometers, closely followed in the first quarter of 1996 by an additional order to round out the remaining New York City subway market. We believe the basic speedometer technology complements other ground transportation products being developed by our industrial products division, and intend to attack this market in an integrated fashion.<P>

We have selected, as a target  market, vibration control in precision applications, where EDO's proprietary piezo-electric actuator technology is critical to success.  We received contracts for actuators for Barry Controls' STACIS 2000 active vibration cancellation table for the semiconductor market. The STACIS 2000 is enjoying increased customer acceptance. We are seeing a corresponding increase in orders, which hopefully will continue to grow.<P>

In cooperation with a machine tool manufacturer in 1995, we proved the concept of active vibration control on a precision cylindrical grinder. When development is completed, this new product will result in considerable savings to the end user. We expect to introduce a product in late 1996 or early 1997.<P>

EDO is a leading supplier of quality acoustic products to the world's defense and commercial markets.  In 1995, we were awarded a contract from Westinghouse for additional transducer assemblies for the U. S. Navy's primary anti-submarine warfare sensor.  Additionally, we were recently awarded orders from both Magnavox and Spartan for ceramic assemblies.<P>

We continued to be a leading supplier of water and waste tanks to commercial airlines, and are particularly proud to be a primary supplier of water and waste tanks for all the major Boeing aircraft, including waste tanks for the newest technology 737 series.<P>

In early 1996, we began production deliveries of wind blades for an international customer. These blades will be used on wind farms which "harvest" wind energy to produce electrical power. This environmentally friendly energy source should see an increasing market as greater emphasis is placed on cleaning the environment around the world.<P>

As part of our initiative to apply composite technology to the ground transportation market, we have formed a strategic alliance with Ingersoll-Rand, a leading supplier of large truck and bus air starter systems. As part of their system, Ingersoll-Rand will market our lightweight, corrosion resistant pressure vessel. We have just received an increased commitment, from Ingersoll-Rand, for more pressure vessels. In 1996, our composite brake cylinders will be tested on a major railroad's freight cars. We believe that composites have many potential applications in ground transportation. We plan to approach this market with partners who already have established positions. <P>

We have maintained our presence in the compressed natural gas fuel storage and infrastructure market, even though it has been developing very slowly. An increasing number of customers are recognizing the significant advantages of the EDO LiteRider natural gas fuel tank. We have increased our share of the load sensitive vehicle market typified by natural gas buses.<P>

In 1995, we formed a strategic marketing and technology alliance with three Japanese firms who purchased an equity interest in EDO Canada, Ltd. This alliance will strengthen our marketing and technical presence with Asian auto and bus manufacturers and enhance our ability to expand to other areas of the region. <P>

We are pursuing various natural gas vehicle fleet opportunities. For example: we are currently funded to configure New York City taxis as natural gas fueled vehicles.  In the first quarter of 1996, we received a contract from the new York state energy research and development authority for a program to develop a hybrid natural gas and electric powered vehicle, which should have application to the taxi and short range delivery market.<P>

With original equipment manufacturers, we are: under contract from Chrysler, to develop fuel tanks for their Cirrus natural gas vehicle; cooperating with General Motors on their test program to select a fuel tank for their small passenger vehicle; and are performing, under contract with an international OEM, a test program which we hope will lead to a production decision in 1996.<P>

Sales of our natural gas infra-structure related products, such as  compressor stations, are developing more slowly. While we are well positioned to exploit this market when it develops, because of its slow growth, we are moderating our investment.<P>

What's ahead?<P>

In this period of mega-mergers what has worked for EDO is a basic strategy of positioning ourselves as suppliers to major customers in the defense, space and commercial markets. We plan to continue to provide these large customers with high quality, specialty niche products, which are more cost effective to buy from us than to develop and produce themselves.<P>

Throughout this presentation and our annual report, we have referenced strategic alliances and partnerships. This proven method of leveraging our technology with complementary technical, production or marketing expertise of others, is a key feature of our future plans.<P>

In 1996, we will continue to emphasize profitability and liquidity. However, we believe that we must use our financial means and management resources to emphasize the revenue growth element of our strategic plan. By operating profitably with positive cash flow, our continuing core businesses will be the foundation of our future, by funding internal growth. We also plan to pursue additional revenue growth through acquisitions. We hope that by continuing to demonstrate prudent assets management, while willing to take reasonable risks, we will be able to attract additional capital from outside sources for prudent acquisitions consistent with our technical, management and market skills.<P>

We are optimistic about the future of our corporation. Our optimism is based on results. In 1995, we went back to basics and succeeded in creating a firm foundation of improved operations, increased backlog and a sound management team. So far, in 1996, we have continued our steady growth proving that we have a strong company, capable of performing in today's complex business environment.<P>

The results of the past year have been very encouraging, and personally satisfying, for all of us on the EDO team. A special word of appreciation from management and the  shareholders is due to all the dedicated people of EDO who have produced these results.<P>

Also, on behalf of all of your management and board of directors, may I express our appreciation for the loyalty and support of our long term shareholders and welcome the new shareholders who have recently joined us. We assure you all that we appreciate the confidence you have displayed by your investment in our corporation, and we are dedicated to further increasing shareholder value.<P>

Thank you for your attention.<P>

   EDO Corporation Reports<BR>Third Quarter Results </CENTER>
</H2>
<P>
COLLEGE POINT, NY  OCTOBER 23, 1996  EDO Corporation (NYSE:EDO) today reported net income for the third quarter period ended September 28, 1996 of $842,000, or $0.14 per share after the net effect of a $7.6 million provision for a loss on the discontinuance of the Company's participation in its energy related operations, including provision for operating losses during the phase out period, and a $7.1 million gain from the curtailment of post-retirement healthcare benefits for Medicare eligible retirees.  In the comparable 1995 period, EDO reported net income of $477,000, or $0.08 per share.<P>

Earnings from continuing operations before taxes in the 1996 third quarter increased 25% to $1,867,000, before the aforementioned $7.1 million gain, from $1,495,000 earned in the same period a year ago.  Sales from continuing operations for the 1996 third quarter increased 24% to $23,107,000 from $18,634,000 reported in the similar period a year ago.<P>

For the first nine months of 1996, EDO reported net income of $2,242,000, or $.37 per share after the above noted special items, compared to $869,000, or $0.15 per share, reported a year ago.  Earnings from continuing operations before taxes in the 1996 first nine months increased 38% to $5,277,000, before the aforementioned $7.1 million gain, from $3,811,000 earned in the same period a year ago.  Sales from continuing operations for the first nine months of 1996 increased 22% to $71,547,000 from $58,461,000 in the prior year.<P>

The Company's order backlog from continuing operations decreased to $81,754,000 at September 28, 1996 from $87,345,000 reported in the third quarter a year ago.  The decline stems principally from timing delays in the receipt of certain contracts, including a major contract from an international customer received after the quarter ended and disclosed in an October 21, 1996 press release.  Backlog as of October 21, 1996 was approximately $101 million. The backlog reported for the third quarter includes follow-on orders under long-term contracts for Mk 105 Airborne Mine Countermeasures System Upgrade Kits for the U. S. Navy, F-15E Bomb Release Units for the U.S. Air Force and piezo-ceramic elements for the Sparton and Magnavox sonobuoy programs.<P>

Frank A. Fariello, President and Chief Executive Officer, stated:  "Our third quarter results shows a continuation of improved operations.  The results reflect the fact that EDO is a strong, technology rich company that offers the potential for tangible growth in today's business environment. In order to maximize the return to our shareholders, our current strategic plan concentrates our resources on those core businesses which have been growing and increasing in profitability. The implementation of our plan also includes growing the company by internal funding of new products and aggressively pursuing new and complementary products through selective acquisition.<P>

"Consistent with our plan, we have sold our Seaplane Float operations and are in the process of selling an instrument product line.  We are very disappointed in having to discontinue our participation in the alternative fuels market, since we believe that it will be viable over the long term. However, the business does not meet our current strategic criteria.  Our energy businesses will continue to operate as before, while we seek financially sound investors who will be committed to the long term continuation of the businesses."<P>

Mr. Fariello continued:  "Our decision to discontinue medical benefits for our Medicare-eligible retirees reflects the popularity of Medicare HMOs, and the success of converting retirees' health coverage to such plans.  EDO had been encouraging Medicare-eligible retirees to join these HMOs because they typically are less costly to these retirees while also providing more services."<P>

EDO is principally a supplier of proprietary advanced electro-optical, electronic, mechanical, acoustic and composite products to major prime defense contractors and commercial original equipment manufacturers.  EDO also serves the domestic and international defense markets as a prime contractor for military systems.<P>

<H2><CENTER> EDO LiteRider Compressed Natural Gas Cylinder Selected by Honda Corporation for 1998 Natural Gas Civic Models </CENTER></H2><P>

COLLEGE POINT, NY  SEPTEMBER 16, 1996   EDO Corporation (NYSE:EDO) announced today that Honda of America has selected EDO (Canada) Ltd. (ECL), a majority-owned subsidiary of EDO Corporation, manufacturer of the LiteRider CNG cylinder, as the supplier of on-board fuel storage tanks for the 1998 Natural Gas Honda Civic. Tank selection for the Honda program was made public on September 15, 1996 by Honda of America at the AGA/NGVC Conference and Exhibition in Dallas, Texas.<P>

For the past two years,  EDO (Canada) has been working in close cooperation with Honda to develop a custom designed cylinder for the Civic. During this time, EDO (Canada), Ltd. has manufactured a number of prototype and pre-production cylinders which have been subjected to a series of standard and special tests to ensure suitability for use on the Civic under a variety of road and environmental conditions. Production levels have not yet been announced by Honda.<P>

Since their introduction in 1994, EDO LiteRider cylinders have offered OEMs and vehicle converters lightweight and high volume fuel storage capacity.  These cylinders have eliminated two of the most significant barriers to the widespread use of natural gas as a vehicle fuel: the heavy weight of traditional steel and aluminum cylinders and the limited range associated with natural gas.<P>

Mr. Frank Fariello, President and CEO of EDO Corporation said: "We are pleased and honored that Honda has chosen the LiteRider cylinder for the 1998 NGV Civic. The extensive design and  testing programs in  which we jointly participated ensure that Honda will use the most advanced design and construction in CNG fuel cylinders in the world. With weight and range being key issues for the lightweight Civic, the LiteRider cylinder was a logical choice as an integral part of Honda's plans for its NGV platforms. The Honda cylinders will be manufactured at EDO (Canada) Ltd., Calgary, Alberta."<P>

EDO Canada Ltd. is an ISO 9001 registered manufacturing facility and a joint venture of EDO Corporation, the government of the Province of Alberta, Toray Industries, Inc., Sumitomo Corporation, Japan, and Sumitomo Corporation of America.<P>

Principally a designer and manufacturer of advanced electronic, mechanical, acoustic and composite products for military, space, marine and commercial aviation markets, the Company continues to pursue the application of its sophisticated and diverse technologies to new commercial and industrial markets.<P>

<H2><CENTER> EDO ANGI Awarded $1,750,000 <BR>in Contracts for<BR>CNG/NGV Fueling Stations </CENTER></H2><P>

COLLEGE POINT, NY  August 7, 1996    EDO Corporation (NYSE:EDO) today reported that its EDO ANGI (EDO Automotive Natural Gas Inc.) business unit has been awarded a series of contracts, valued at $1,750,000, for several compressed natural gas (CNG) fueling stations for natural gas vehicles (NGV) to be installed in domestic and international locations.  EDO ANGI is the compressed natural gas fueling station packaging unit of EDO Energy, a wholly-owned subsidiary of EDO Corporation.<P>

Five complete NGV fueling stations, equipped with Ariel compressors, will be built for the Natural Gas Vehicles Company (NGVC), Cairo, Egypt, with deliveries scheduled to begin in October and continuing into early 1997.

An EDO CNG fueling package, currently in final stages of installation and qualification, has been delivered to Great Falls Gas Company of Great Falls, Montana for use at a station that will supply fuel for the utility's own natural gas vehicles (NGVs) as well as those owned by private citizens and nearby fleets.  The 40 scfm RIX station package also includes an EDO ANGI AMP III control system, gas dryer, cascade storage, and dual-hose dispenser.<P>

Start-up and training services for all programs will be conducted by EDO ANGI's customer service department.<P>

Mr. Frank A. Fariello, President and Chief Executive Officer, stated:  "These contracts are a result of the concentrated and continued efforts EDO has put forth into establishing an important role in the NGV industry. For nearly fourteen years, EDO has provided a product and service base that has technically supported more than 250 CNG station sites across North America."<P>

EDO ANGI is a full service packager and manufacturer of compressed natural gas fueling stations and vehicle conversion equipment. Established in 1983 as Automotive Natural Gas Inc. the company is a pioneer of the alternative fuels industry and has installed more than 250 CNG refueling stations across the country, and distributed approximately 14,000 CNGV conversion kits to a broad spectrum of vehicle markets including passenger cars, trucks, school buses, forklifts, and marine vessels.<P>

<H2><CENTER> EDO Corporation <BR> Awarded Additional Contract, <BR>Valued at $8.1 Million,<BR>by U.S. Navy for<BR>Mk 105 Airborne Mine<BR>Countermeasures (AMCM)  System<BR>Upgrade Kits</CENTER></H2><P>

COLLEGE POINT, NY  July 29, 1996    EDO Corporation (NYSE:EDO) announced today it has been awarded an additional contract, valued at $8.1 million, by the Department of the Navy for Mod 4 Upgrade Kits for the U. S. Navy's Mk 105 Airborne Mine Countermeasure (AMCM) Systems.<P>
The contract will be performed by EDO's Marine and Aircraft Systems business unit, located in College Point, New York, with deliveries starting early in 1998.  The U.S. Navy plans to purchase additional Mod. 4 Upgrade Kits for incorporation into its Mk 105 AMCM Systems over the next few years.  Depending on budget constraints, the total potential upgrade market, including logistics, could be significant.<P>
The Mod. 4 Upgrade provides a significant improvement to the maintainability, reliability and performance capabilities of the Mk 105 AMCM System.  The Mk 105 AMCM System is towed through the water by the MH-53 helicopter, and generates a magnetic field which explodes mines.  This system has been in service in the U.S. Navy since the early 1970s and is also in service in an international Navy.  <P>
Frank A. Fariello, President and Chief Executive Officer of EDO Corporation, stated:  "EDO, one of the world's leaders in the design, development and production of mine counter measure systems,  is committed to aggressively supporting the U.S. Navy's airborne mine countermeasures efforts.  In addition to this new contract award, we received approximately $16 million in contracts from the U.S. Navy during the past 12 months for Mk 105 Mod. 4 engineering work, Mod. 4 Upgrade Kits production and logistics support."<P>
Principally a designer and manufacturer of advanced electronic, mechanical, acoustic and composite products for military, space, marine and commercial aviation markets, EDO Corporation continues to pursue the application of its sophisticated and diverse technologies to new commercial and industrial markets.<P>

<center><h2> EDO Corporation Reports 1996 Second Quarter Results;<P> Operating Results Continue to Improve </h2></p></center><P>

COLLEGE POINT, NY  July 24, 1996  EDO Corporation (NYSE:EDO) today reported operating results for the 1996 second quarter.<P>

Sales for the 1996 second quarter increased 15% to $28,556,000 from the $24,879,000 reported in the similar period a year ago.  Operating earnings increased 17% to $1,116,000 from $953,000 reported for the 1995 second quarter.  The increases are reflective of continuing improvements in operations and represent a 9% increase in sales and a 15% increase in operating earnings over the 1996 first quarter.  The Company reported net earnings available for common shares of $750,000, or $0.12 per share, for the 1996 second quarter, compared to $283,000, or $0.05 per share, reported a year ago.<P>

The Company's order backlog at the end of the 1996 second quarter was $88,979,000, 8% higher than the $82,517,000 reported in the comparable 1995 period. The backlog includes additional orders for F-15E ejection and release mechanisms for the U. S. Air Force, MK-105 logistic support for the U. S. Navy, and piezo-ceramic elements for the Sparton and Magnavox sonobuoy programs.  The backlog shows some decline from the first quarter due to unexpected delays in the receipt of certain contracts.<P>

Frank A. Fariello, President and Chief Executive Officer, stated:  "Our second quarter results reflect another consecutive quarter of improved operations.  We are meeting our plan for continued growth in revenue and earnings based on a solid foundation of backlog in our core businesses.

Principally a designer and manufacturer of advanced electronic, mechanical,
acoustic and composite products for military, space, marine and commercial
aviation markets, the Company continues to pursue the application of its
sophisticated and diverse technologies to new commercial and industrial

COLLEGE POINT, NY  June 25, 1996    EDO Corporation (NYSE:EDO) today announced that its Canadian subsidiary, EDO (Canada) Ltd. ("EDO Canada"), has received $3,380,000 in contract awards for its LiteRider all-composite NGV (natural gas for vehicles) cylinders.<P>

Orion Bus Industries of Mississauga, Ontario has awarded EDO Canada a series of contracts for LiteRider cylinders destined for transit systems in San Bernadino, Oxnard, Monterey and Sacramento, California and in Toronto, Canada on Toronto Transit Commission passenger buses.<P>

Neoplan USA Corporation of Lamar, Colorado has awarded EDO Canada a follow-on contract for LiteRider cylinder assemblies destined for the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transit Authority.  Each LiteRider cylinder package will provide a passenger bus with a CNG capacity of more than 16,000 scf and provide 400 miles per fill.<P>

Thomas Built Buses, Inc. (Chassis Division) of High Point, North Carolina has awarded EDO Canada a contract for three specially configured LiteRider cylinder packages for Thomas's upcoming fleet of natural gas powered buses.

<H2><CENTER>EDO Corporation Announces Receipt of<BR>New York City Subway Speedometer Contracts<BR>Totaling $1,222,954 From The<BR>New York City Transit Authority 
</CENTER></H2><P>

COLLEGE POINT, NY -- May 13, 1996 -- EDO Corporation (NYSE:EDO) today announced that its Marine and Aircraft Systems business unit was awarded two contracts by the New York City Transit Authority (NYCTA) totaling $1,222,954.  The contracts cover the production of 1,768 Speed Indicator Units (SIUs) which will be installed on New York City subway cars and will bring the total number of EDO SIUs on the New York City subway system to over 3,500.  The NYCTA plans to equip the remainder of its subway cars with speed indicator systems within the next few years.
<P>
EDO's SIU is a state-of-the-art, high technology "Doppler" system which utilizes electronics and signal processing experience developed by EDO as part of its defense product lines.  The Doppler SIU emits a low-power detection beam which is directed ahead and down to the track bed.  A portion of the radiated beam is reflected back to the sensor.  The frequency of the reflected signal is shifted by an amount proportional to the speed of the train relative to the track bed.  Once the sensor receives the reflected signal, a signal processor converts the signal into a two-digit, miles per hour speed indication.  The new SIU is extremely accurate, whether the train is accelerating, decelerating, or moving forward or in reverse.  In addition, the new SIUs are unaffected by slippage of subway car wheels or changes in wheel diameter.
<P>
Frank A. Fariello, President and Chief Executive Officer of EDO Corporation, stated:  "During the past 24 months, EDO has received approximately $3.5 million in contracts for the NYCTA for Speed Indicator Units and Conductor's Emergency Valve Alarms.  These contracts represent an example of the Company's ongoing business diversification efforts.  We will continue to utilize our defense electronics and mechanical systems expertise in the commercial marketplace."
<P>
Principally a designer and manufacturer of advanced electronic, mechanical, acoustic and composite products for military, space, marine and commercial aviation markets, EDO Corporation continues to pursue the application of its sophisticated and diverse technologies to new commercial and industrial markets.

<H2><CENTER> EDO Corporation<BR>Awarded $1.1 Million Boeing Contract 
</CENTER></H2><P>

COLLEGE POINT, NY - April 22, 1996 - EDO Corporation, (NYSE:EDO) announced today that it has been awarded a $1.1 million contract from the Military Airplanes Division of Boeing's Defense and Space Group.  The Company will be supporting Boeing as it executes its prime contract to develop "Weapons Carriage Technology" (WCT) for the United States Air Force, Wright Laboratory, Armament Directorate at Eglin Air Force Base.

The WCT program will develop new suspension and release equipment for use on future tactical military aircraft.  These aircraft will require equipment that is easily adaptable for use with both existing and new design weapons and that can also be readily used in either an internal weapon's bay or an external pylon.  WCT will also dramatically reduce the levels of maintenance and logistics required in addition to offering reduced weight.

Frank A. Fariello, President and Chief Executive Officer of EDO Corporation stated:  "Thehe Boeing/EDO relationship will ensure that WCT will benefit from the unique perspective that each company brings to the effort.  This award will serve to enhance the opportunities available to EDO as aircraft development programs, such as Joint Attack Strike Technology (JAST), begin to mature."

Principally a designer and manufacturer of advanced electronic, mechanical, acoustic and composite products for military, space, marine and commercial aviation markets, EDO Corporation continues to pursue the application of its sophisticated and diverse technologies to new commercial and industrial markets.
