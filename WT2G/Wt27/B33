In Reply to: <a href="585.html">Unlikely Existence of God</a> posted by Amanda on December 26, 1996 at 18:46:35:<p>
: This posting is a continuation of an issue discussed regarding atheism/agnosticism where I claimed that there was evidence that the existence of God was unlikely. Lynn was curious as to what this evidence was so off the top of my head I'll attempt to list that which I've come across but I'm sure other people here will have more to add and of course arguments on anything that I state are more than welcome.<br>: First, let me state that over the years many definitions of God have been invented and I basically see it as an attempt made by theists to cover their ass with the discoveries made by science. With space exploration we have discovered there are no anomolies in our solar system of an entity that could be God or of the heavens referred to in various bibles. You would think that no matter how different this entity was from a human - even taking into consideration the ideas of other possible dimensions and planes of existence there would be SOMETHING; whether chemical or physical or following the natural laws that would show a change from other findings.<br>: Second, after Darwin found a mechanism to explain how man evolved along with other animals that over the years has accumulated much evidence for it then the whole idea of creation was seriously reconsidered by all intelligent humans. Most have given up the idea of creation completely.<br>: Third, if we trace the history of religion we can understand how it might have been invented and it is completely justified to those times - nomads who could be considered the first Homos are said to have worshipped the "old man" of the tribe as he was wise and capable of magic - this later evolved into an old man myth. The first human civilizatons with more leisure time to ponder the mysteries of the world chalked all natural phenomena to a higher being. Curiosity is definately a strong trait in humans and without any knowledge of the way the world works, I really can understand why one might think that thunder and floods and disease etc.. were produced by something with a purpose. Right up until the Enlightenment I can see why the religious beliefs were deemed more realistic and rational than any others - though that didn't warrant all the great minds that were silenced. <br>: Then if you look at the big religions; christianity, judaism and Islam, you can see that a lot of their material was borrowed from other existing religions of the time. Most of the key concepts - heaven, salvation, judgement day, good vs evil etc... were already being discussed. One of the purposes of religion has always been to control the herd and through fear and clever propoganda this was acheived. It's fairly likely Jesus existed (and Mohommed too for that matter) and it can be thought that a few of their teachings were admirable but there is no evidence that they were anything more then men. There is no evidence for the miracles of both the Old and New Testaments. (I haven't read the Koran yet so I'm not sure if miracles happened in it).<br>: What else? Hmmm...<br>: The big argument atheists used at the dawn of this century was that "if there is a God why is all this suffering going on" - that's been explained away now by theists but still - considering God was mighty pissed when the first humans he created got a little out of hand, you'd think we would have all been drowned long ago for our "sins".<br>: I'll leave it at that before I get carried away but there is much more if you're interested, Lynn.<p>: Amanda <p><br>Dear Amanda,<p>Obviously I disagree with you.  I could take every argument you make and turn it around to prove my own point, but I doubt if I could convince you.  There is only one way to know for sure if God is real.  First you would have to accept the possibility that there is a God.  Then you would have to open you mind and heart and sincerely humble yourself before Him and just say "God, if you are there would you please reveal yourself to me?"  You'd have to have the right attitude and little persistence, but I guarantee if you "keep knocking the door will be opened".  I suspect that most people at this site would find that to be a very hard thing to do, since, even if there is a God, he has already been judged to be cruel, uncaring, judgemental,...pick your own adjective.

: Dear Amanda,

: Obviously I disagree with you.  I could take every argument you make and turn it around to prove my own point, but I doubt if I could convince you.  There is only one way to know for sure if God is real.  First you would have to accept the possibility that there is a God.  Then you would have to open you mind and heart and sincerely humble yourself before Him and just say &quot;God, if you are there would you please reveal yourself to me?&quot;  You'd have to have the right attitude and little persistence, but I guarantee if you &quot;keep knocking the door will be opened&quot;.  I suspect that most people at this site would find that to be a very hard thing to do, since, even if there is a God, he has already been judged to be cruel, uncaring, judgemental,...pick your own adjective.

The first human civilizatons with more leisure time to ponder the mysteries of the world chalked all natural phenomena to a higher being. Curiosity is definately a strong trait in humans and without any knowledge of the way the world works, I really can understand why one might think that thunder and floods and disease etc.. were produced by something with a purpose.

It appears that most people who claim to be religious i this day and age seem to have similar feelings as you - I think science and enlightenment and the onslaught of freethinkers have been the things responsible for such a change and I think these factors will produce many other "good" changes in the future but again, I see no need for Gods to be brought into the picture.

I'm sure you're aware of the many "bad" things that have happened in the past as a result of religion - how a woman can be a christian is a question I have asked myself time and time again. We can still see today how religion is harmful though I do admit it is not as harmful as it once was. The suppression of science is to me probably the most obvious harm - the amount of ignorance we see in this country especially is another - the hand that the church plays in politics, education, economy, soceity are others.

:Do you not think we would be better off in believing in things that we can see - things that are natural - things that are realistic? <p>	Be careful about this sort of talk.  What you describe, if I understand your words correctly, leaves out theoretical exercises.  What of atomic theory? Surely on the scale of our existence, it was once thought, these things are not worthy of out attention.  Now it's the quantum, and the two relativity theories?  Most undeniably, relativity has no applications to our slothly motions.  It does assist us in astrophysics, but that also is a pragmatists thorn.  Pure mathematicians do not deal in the tangible, the visible, the mundane.  What they do now may become applied mathematics in the future, but today it is absolute abstraction.  AND there remains a large body of work that is centuries old but has no applications.  This would bring us to the fine arts and music.  Neither deal much with the tangible or mundane; they are in the realm of transcendence and ineffability.  Both give us glimpses behind, through, or outside the human experience.  Should these not be persued?  I'm more that a little curious about your outlook!<p>============================<p><br>:The suppression of science is to me probably the most obvious harm - the amount of ignorance we see in this country especially is another - the hand that the church plays in politics, education, economy, soceity are others. <p>	Bravo!  Exactly as I'd have stated it.  I am reminded of some research that I had done on American media history.  The movie censorship code was initiated when film became more of an influence on society (early '20's).  When religious zealots got going on the subject, there was harm done to artistic creativity.  I question, by my current standards, the wisdom of using religion as a template for moral and ethical conduct.  One need look no further than the three Crusades, N. Ireland, the Middle East or Jimmy Bakker to see the insensibilities exhibited in the name of religion.  The Production Code forwarded by the religious community were very specific in their directives.  It mentioned great painting and music as morally uplifting art, and indecent books and unclean paintings as degenerate art. <br>Well..... WHAT?  Did any of those people enjoy VanGogh's vision, which was considered heretical in its day?  Did James Joyce err in penning _Ulysses_?  Which art is uplifting?  Point to some.  Why?  Is it, by definition, universally uplifting because certain individuals find it so?  Who will be the art "experts"?  The clergy, who as a group are unqualified for this assignment?  Who will "make" the artists?  Whenever religious institutions get involved in policy beyond their venue, there is rampant silliness, and above all, stunted intellectual growth for the individual and society.  This sounds harsher than I really feel about it, but the case must be made.  Please note that my sharp words are not directed at the idea of religion.  One must ignore dumb, dogmatic people in any circumstance, but rather is aimed at the viral INSTITUTION which, as with any other group, has an agenda.  But is is frequently mean-spirited and insensitive.  That's all.  I'm done.

: ============================

: 
: :The suppression of science is to me probably the most obvious harm - the amount of ignorance we see in this country especially is another - the hand that the church plays in politics, education, economy, soceity are others. 

: 	Bravo!  Exactly as I'd have stated it.  I am reminded of some research that I had done on American media history.  The movie censorship code was initiated when film became more of an influence on society (early '20's).  When religious zealots got going on the subject, there was harm done to artistic creativity.  I question, by my current standards, the wisdom of using religion as a template for moral and ethical conduct.  One need look no further than the three Crusades, N. Ireland, the Middle East or Jimmy Bakker to see the insensibilities exhibited in the name of religion.  The Production Code forwarded by the religious community were very specific in their directives.  It mentioned great painting and music as morally uplifting art, and indecent books and unclean paintings as degenerate art. 
: Well..... WHAT?  Did any of those people enjoy VanGogh's vision, which was considered heretical in its day?  Did James Joyce err in penning _Ulysses_?  Which art is uplifting?  Point to some.  Why?  Is it, by definition, universally uplifting because certain individuals find it so?  Who will be the art &quot;experts&quot;?  The clergy, who as a group are unqualified for this assignment?  Who will &quot;make&quot; the artists?  Whenever religious institutions get involved in policy beyond their venue, there is rampant silliness, and above all, stunted intellectual growth for the individual and society.  This sounds harsher than I really feel about it, but the case must be made.  Please note that my sharp words are not directed at the idea of religion.  One must ignore dumb, dogmatic people in any circumstance, but rather is aimed at the viral INSTITUTION which, as with any other group, has an agenda.  But is is frequently mean-spirited and insensitive.  That's all.  I'm done.

I think that it is more to the point to say that science and evidence has rolled back our arrogant idea of self-importance in the universe.  First it was losing the geocentric conception of the solar system in favour of a heliocentric model.  Then alnog came Darwin, and I do not need to regurgitate what his theory did to our conception of preferred placement in the scheme of things.  Next was A.

Light is the only reliable and constant measurement tool in the universe, not the human immortal soul (quantitatively at least).  Next was Edwin Hubble and his expansionary model for the universe.  We do not sit in the centre of the universe's expansion; come to think of it, there is no centre of expansion for all things are in recession of one another.  And now with modern cosmology and cosmogony, along with the Big Bang theory, we see that a supernatural hand is likely unnecessary to guide the universe to its present structure and features.Let me state that I do feel that there is something that is infinite, completely incomprehensible, pervasive and ineffable that transcends human experience.

No "wise, old, bearded caucasian man", no intimate interest in the goings-on of this very, very insignificant section in a very large place, no interest in individuals, no vindictive retribution, none of it.  I think that we are alone in this respect and must, as you say, pay attention to the mundane here-and-now things that you talk about.

It is what keeps me "alive" and vigorous, and nary a day passes that I am not in either proactive thought about, or passionate banter with, friends at work about the nature of God, beauty, life, the universe, the unknowable.  I am on a quest; one that will undoubtedly yield no answers to the unknowable questions, but I will continue to try!Also, you or anyone interested in science ought to be reading the book that I am.  It is entitled, _The End of Science; Facing the Limits of Knowledge in the Twilight of the Scientific Age_.

<br>: <br>: Dear Amanda,<p>: Obviously I disagree with you.  I could take every argument you make and turn it around to prove my own point, but I doubt if I could convince you.  There is only one way to know for sure if God is real.  First you would have to accept the possibility that there is a God.  Then you would have to open you mind and heart and sincerely humble yourself before Him and just say "God, if you are there would you please reveal yourself to me?"  You'd have to have the right attitude and little persistence, but I guarantee if you "keep knocking the door will be opened".  I suspect that most people at this site would find that to be a very hard thing to do, since, even if there is a God, he has already been judged to be cruel, uncaring, judgemental,...pick your own adjective.  <p><br>Hi Lynn,<p>I'm relatively new to this message board and I'd like to comment on your response to<br>Amanda.

: : : Dear Amanda,

: : : Obviously I disagree with you.  I could take every argument you make and turn it around to prove my own point, but I doubt if I could convince you.  There is only one way to know for sure if God is real.  First you would have to accept the possibility that there is a God.  Then you would have to open you mind and heart and sincerely humble yourself before Him and just say &quot;God, if you are there would you please reveal yourself to me?&quot;  You'd have to have the right attitude and little persistence, but I guarantee if you &quot;keep knocking the door will be opened&quot;.  I suspect that most people at this site would find that to be a very hard thing to do, since, even if there is a God, he has already been judged to be cruel, uncaring, judgemental,...pick your own adjective.  

: : 
: : Hi Lynn,

: : I'm relatively new to this message board and I'd like to comment on your response to
: : Amanda. I don't know if you read it yet but I also responded to your post on Big Bang
: : cosmology.

: : The argument you made is similar to the &quot;Skeptic's Prayer&quot; argument made by Peter Kreeft
: : in his book, &quot;Handbook of Christian Apologetics.&quot; For a good response to the Skeptic's
: : Prayer, I recommend http://www.infidel.org/library/modern/robby_berry/skeprayr.html.
: : A similar approach can also be found in the Book of Mormon:

: :      &quot;And when ye shall receive these things, I would exhort you that
: :      ye would ask God, the Eternal Father, in the name of Christ, if
: :      these things are not true; and if ye shall ask with a sincere
: :      heart, with real intent, having faith in Christ, he will manifest
: :      the truth of it unto you, by the power of the Holy Ghost.&quot;
: :      (Moroni 10:4)

: : Devout Mormons call this &quot;Moroni's Challenge&quot; and they see this as a way of converting
: : non-Mormons.

: : I think there are problems with this sort of argumentation. For an analogy, let's say a
: : boy came up to you with a small box. Let's say he told that he has a fairy inside the
: : box. You open it and you find it's empty. The boy replies that you must ask the fairy
: : to manifest itself first. You do this but still no fairy. The boy says you must do it 
: : the correct way. You have to remove all your doubt first, or maybe give the box a
: : little shake, or perhaps caress and kiss the box, then maybe the fairy will appear. If
: : nothing happens then there's something you're doing wrong.

: : The problem here is a lack of testability. What constitutes an answer? This method of 
: : contacting a metaphysical being is reduced to ambiguity and confusion. Let's say I 
: : make this prayer and I find a $20 bill on the sidewalk. Is it divine intervention
: : or was I just lucky? Or let's say I get into a car accident next week. Was God trying
: : to tell me something or could it be that Canadian roads in the winter can get pretty
: : slippery? In addition, what particular religious entity should I pray to if I want to
: : know if it exists? Why should I accept your deity instead of opting for Moroni's

: : Prayer and Moroni's Challenge too. This is like the fairy in the box analogy except

: : even see Daffy Duck. Which boy should I believe?

: : that I had the wrong attitude or I wasn't sincere enough, but then I'll have to point
: : the boy with the fairy in the box analogy.

: : By the way, I hope I don't seem condescending to you or anything. Please understand I
: : don't mean any offense. I try to write as if we were having a polite intellectual
: : conversation but sometimes I might present myself different than I intended to.

: Dear Jason,

: I am not offended at all.  

: I don't necessarily think your prayer has been unanswered.  God works in His own time and His own way.  I believe that seeds that were planted when I was a child did not come to fruition until my early 20's.  One thing I know is that he always answers my prayers, but never in the way I hoped.  It's always better than any solution I could have concocted.

: You say I'm presenting you with an invisible fairy in a box, well, I would use the analogy that you and I are on a trek through a rugged wilderness.

: : : Dear Jason,

: : : I am not offended at all.  

: : : I don't necessarily think your prayer has been unanswered.  God works in His own time and His own way.  I believe that seeds that were planted when I was a child did not come to fruition until my early 20's.  One thing I know is that he always answers my prayers, but never in the way I hoped.  It's always better than any solution I could have concocted.  

: : : I can't prove or explain to you what it is like to have a relationship with God.  It is something you simply have to experience.  I also don't think anyone saved or unsaved should jump to conclusions about whether a windfall or a tragedy is something that has been &quot;done to them&quot; by God.  Some things just happen by chance, but God always uses these events for the spiritual benefit of those who love him.  

: : : You say I'm presenting you with an invisible fairy in a box, well, I would use the analogy that you and I are on a trek through a rugged wilderness.  We're existing on nuts, berries, and bugs, and have no clothes to wear,when I discover a magnificent banquet table full of every kind of food.  I try to convince you to come have a taste, yet you, feeling proud of your self-sufficiency, (and finding it hard to believe in the first place) refuse to come with me to the table or even to admit that it exists.  I feel terrible that I have discovered something so wonderful and can't share it with you, as I watch you struggling and sweating your way through the briars and bushes, not knowing where you're headed or why you've taken the journey.

: : 
: : Interesting analogy. I'm quite familiar with Christian theology in this regard. A
: : similar analogy I heard went like this: &quot;Christians aren't superior to anyone
: : else, we're simply beggars telling other beggars where they can find food.&quot; I
: : appreciate the thought behind this way of thinking. I know that you're concerned
: : for my spiritual well being. However, although I can respect your religious 
: : beliefs, I cannot embrace them. If one day I find out that you are right and I'm 
: : wrong, I'll be quite surprised, but I'll happily embrace the truth whatever it may
: : be. However, at this time I don't think your religious beliefs stand up to the
: : tests of reason and logic.

In Reply to: <a href="585.html">Unlikely Existence of God</a> posted by Amanda on December 26, 1996 at 18:46:35:<p>
: This posting is a continuation of an issue discussed regarding atheism/agnosticism where I claimed that there was evidence that the existence of God was unlikely. Lynn was curious as to what this evidence was so off the top of my head I'll attempt to list that which I've come across but I'm sure other people here will have more to add and of course arguments on anything that I state are more than welcome.<br>: First, let me state that over the years many definitions of God have been invented and I basically see it as an attempt made by theists to cover their ass with the discoveries made by science.

: : This posting is a continuation of an issue discussed regarding atheism/agnosticism where I claimed that there was evidence that the existence of God was unlikely. Lynn was curious as to what this evidence was so off the top of my head I'll attempt to list that which I've come across but I'm sure other people here will have more to add and of course arguments on anything that I state are more than welcome.
: : First, let me state that over the years many definitions of God have been invented and I basically see it as an attempt made by theists to cover their ass with the discoveries made by science. With space exploration we have discovered there are no anomolies in our solar system of an entity that could be God or of the heavens referred to in various bibles. You would think that no matter how different this entity was from a human - even taking into consideration the ideas of other possible dimensions and planes of existence there would be SOMETHING; whether chemical or physical or following the natural laws that would show a change from other findings.
: : Second, after Darwin found a mechanism to explain how man evolved along with other animals that over the years has accumulated much evidence for it then the whole idea of creation was seriously reconsidered by all intelligent humans. Most have given up the idea of creation completely.
: : Third, if we trace the history of religion we can understand how it might have been invented and it is completely justified to those times - nomads who could be considered the first Homos are said to have worshipped the &quot;old man&quot; of the tribe as he was wise and capable of magic - this later evolved into an old man myth. The first human civilizatons with more leisure time to ponder the mysteries of the world chalked all natural phenomena to a higher being. Curiosity is definately a strong trait in humans and without any knowledge of the way the world works, I really can understand why one might think that thunder and floods and disease etc.. were produced by something with a purpose. Right up until the Enlightenment I can see why the religious beliefs were deemed more realistic and rational than any others - though that didn't warrant all the great minds that were silenced. 
: : Then if you look at the big religions; christianity, judaism and Islam, you can see that a lot of their material was borrowed from other existing religions of the time. Most of the key concepts - heaven, salvation, judgement day, good vs evil etc... were already being discussed.

: : I'll leave it at that before I get carried away but there is much more if you're interested, Lynn.

: Your agruements are simply against a Christian God they by no means
: explore or deny the possiblily of another God...There are million of 
: possible theories for a god, and it would be impossible to find any proof
: or arguement against them.

I'm quite happy to believe in what I do and when the time comes to change my beliefs it won't be embarassing at all for me - my beliefs and my thinking could do a 180 degree turn tomorrow if new evidence was found to support the opposite of what it does now. I enjoy having educated beliefs that I can support with a lot of provisional truths - I am proud to know my mind and be decided on how I see things. I can't see the benefit at all in not believing in ANYTHING as you say - perhaps you can fill me in. As for noe, I don't think we're at all alike - and if I'm on the side of the evidence and you're not then we're not on the same sides. Happy New Year!

: : We are definately on the same 'side'.  But, just because evidence 'seems' to weigh in 
: : favor of one theory or another I don't think that is reason to lean either way.  Think
: : how much evidence is unknowable or that you or I just can't comprehend.
: : respectfully grasshopper

: Oh, I certainly sway in the direction of the evidence and have no qualms about it - 
: You say you don't believe in anything - I think that's a bit sad and perhaps untrue. I'm quite happy to believe in what I do and when the time comes to change my beliefs it won't be embarassing at all for me - my beliefs and my thinking could do a 180 degree turn tomorrow if new evidence was found to support the opposite of what it does now. I enjoy having educated beliefs that I can support with a lot of provisional truths - I am proud to know my mind and be decided on how I see things. I can't see the benefit at all in not believing in ANYTHING as you say - perhaps you can fill me in. As for noe, I don't think we're at all alike - and if I'm on the side of the evidence and you're not then we're not on the same sides. Happy New Year!

: : : As you can see, we are dealing with BELIEFS which are based both on evidence and conjecture, which, even if proven true, do not explain how these gases, from which all the universe is comprised, came into being.  Nor does it deal with the obvious problem of how the resulting solid particles, hurling through space from the explosion ordered themselves into a complex universe.  I cannot think of a single instance of this ever happening in nature.

: : : I also do not know of any evidence of an observable mutation that ever resulted in a superior creature.  I realize that we have dominant and recessive genes that allow us to adapt to our surroundings, resulting in changes in color, etc., but in order for a new species to evolve from an old one, there must be mutation.

: : That is one of the misconceptions about evolution, that it HAS to go from inferior to superior. This is not necessarily true. Evolution is what helps an organism survive long enough to reproduce, it doesn't have to lead to a superior form of life such as us humans.

: As I said, I realize that we have recessive genes that gradually become dominant as our surroundings change.  This still does not explain how all these thousands of mutations created new creatures from old. As far as I am aware, mutations only result in defects.  
: Obviously , the theory of evolution requires that higher life forms evolve from lower ones, so I don't understand your point about not having to evolve into a superior form of life.  Where is the real evidence that one species ever evolved into another?  This leads back to my mutation question, which I still haven't gotten an answer to.  My mind is open, convince me.  

: : If we were to start from scratch life on this planet would be completely in form.

: You perplex me.  Please explain.

: : : Haven't the processes always been the same, or did nature do a 180 at some point?  If in the distant past, order ascended from chaos, and mutation was once a good thing, then everything is working in  reverse now.     

: : How so? The universe isn't as all &quot;ordered&quot; as we would like to believe it is. We are only aware of a very tiny percentage of it.

: Again, please explain this disorder to me.  I don't get it.

: : One example of a mutation that I can remember is about a moth in England when they were burning a lot of coal. The moth was the same color as a tree, but with all of the soot covering the trees they can't hide from their predators. There was a mutant form that would appear every now and then that was black which matched up with the sooted trees. Not the &quot;normal&quot; moths were getting eatened by their predators which allowed the mutant moths to survive and reproduce more than the others. Though, now that they are not burning as much coal in England as they once did things have reversed with the moths. Evolution in action.

: This is not evolution of species, it is merely a color change.

Such confusion is due in large part to the inability of scientists to communicate effectively to the general public and also to confusion among scientists themselves about how to define such an important term. When discussing evolution it is important to distinguish between the existence of evolution and various theories about the mechanism of evolution. And when referring to the existence of evolution it is important to have a clear definition in mind. What exactly do biologists mean when they say that they have observed evolution or that humans and chimps have evolved from a common ancestor. <p>One of the most respected evolutionary biologists has defined biological evolution as follows, <p>"In the broadest sense, evolution is merely change, and so is all-pervasive; galaxies, languages, and political systems all evolve. Biological evolution ... is change in the properties of populations of organisms that transcend the lifetime of a single individual. The ontogeny of an individual is not considered evolution; individual organisms do not evolve. The changes in populations that are considered evolutionary are those that are inheritable via the genetic material from one generation to the next. Biological evolution may be slight or substantial; it embraces everything from slight changes in the proportion of different alleles within a population (such as those determining blood types) to the successive alterations that led from the earliest protoorganism to snails, bees, giraffes, and dandelions." <p>- Douglas J. Futuyma in Evolutionary Biology, Sinauer Associates 1986 <p>It is important to note that biological evolution refers to populations and not to individuals and that the changes must be passed on to the next generation. In practice this means that, <p>Evolution is a process that results in heritable changes in a population spread over many generations. <p>This is a good working scientific definition of evolution; one that can be used to distinguish between evolution and similar changes that are not evolution. Another common short definition of evolution can be found in many textbooks, <p>"In fact, evolution can be precisely defined as any change in the frequency of alleles within a gene pool from one generation to the next." <p>- Helena Curtis and N. Sue Barnes, Biology, 5th ed. 1989 Worth Publishers, p.974 <p>One can quibble about the accuracy of such a definition (and we have often quibbled on these newsgroups) but it also conveys the essence of what evolution really is. When biologists say that they have observed evolution they mean that they have detected a change in the frequency of genes in a population. (Often the genetic change is inferred from phenotypic changes that are heritable.) When biologists say that humans and chimps have evolved from a common ancestor they mean that there have been successive heritable changes in the two separated populations since they became isolated. <p>Unfortunately the common definitions of evolution outside of the scientific community are different. For example, in the Oxford Concise Science Dictionary we find the following definition; <p>"evolution: The gradual process by which the present diversity of plant and animal life arose from the earliest and most primitive organisms, which is believed to have been continuing for the past 3000 million years." <p>This is inexcusable for a dictionary of science. Not only does this definition exclude prokaryotes, protozoa, and fungi, but it specifically includes a term "gradual process" which should not be part of the definition. More importantly the definition seems to refer more to the history of evolution than to evolution itself. Using this definition it is possible to debate whether evolution is still occurring but the definition provides no easy way of distinguishing evolution from other processes. For example, is the increase in height among Caucasians over the past several hundred years an example of evolution? Are the color changes in the peppered moth population examples of evolution? This is not a scientific definition. <p>Standard dictionaries are even worse. <p>"evolution: ...the doctrine according to which higher forms of life have gradually arisen out of lower.." - Chambers <p>"evolution: ...the development of a species, organism, or organ from its original or primitive state to its present or specialized state; phylogeny or ontogeny" - Webster's <p>These definitions are simply wrong. Unfortunately it is common for non- scientists to enter into a discussion about evolution with such a definition in mind. This often leads to fruitless debate since the experts are thinking about evolution from a different perspective. When someone claims that they don't believe in evolution they cannot be referring to an acceptable scientific definition of evolution because that would be denying something which is easy to demonstrate. It would be like saying that they don't believe in gravity! <p>Recently I read a statement from a creationist who claimed that scientists are being dishonest when they talk about evolution. This person believed that evolution was being misrepresented to the public. The real problem is that the public, and creationists, do not understand what evolution is all about. This person's definition of evolution was very different from the common scientific definition and as a consequence he was unable to understand what evolutionary biology really meant. This is the same person who claimed that one could not "believe" in evolution and still be religious! But once we realize that evolution is simply "a process that results in heritable changes in a population spread over many generations" it seems a little silly to pretend that this excludes religion! <p>Scientists such as myself, must share the blame for the lack of public understanding of science. We need to work harder to convey the correct information. Sometimes we don't succeed very well but that does not mean that we are dishonest. On the other hand, the general public, and creationists in particular, need to also work a little harder in order to understand science. Reading a textbook would help. <br>

: [Last Update: January 22, 1993]

In Reply to: <a href="509.html">Re: Refuting Creation Science</a> posted by Lynn on December 13, 1996 at 12:55:07:<p>
<p>: : : Ladies and Gentlemen,<br>: : : At an ever increasing rate, I am inundated with Creation Science rhetoric.  Next month, a fellow by the name of Gary Parker is coming to my local area to speak on the "fallacies of Evolution" and why there should be equal time granted in the science curricula for creationism. Can anyone direct me some good resources from which I can draw upon to methodically refute these nuts?  Perhaps to, point by point, provide a counter argument to all their assertions based upon science's current understanding of astronomy, cosmology, geology, biological evolution, biological chemistry, isochron dating, etc...<p>: : <br>: : Here is something that might help that I had gotten from a FAQ file.<br>: : ______________________________________<p>: : The universe is so complex it must have been designed<p>: : "The presence of design in the universe proves there is a God. Surely you don't think all this appeared here just by chance?"<p>: : <br>: : This is known as the Argument From Design.<p>: : It is a matter of dispute whether there is any element of design in the universe. Those who believe that the complexity and diversity of living creatures on the earth is evidence of a creator are best advised to read the newsgroup talk.origins for a while.<p>: <br>: : There is insufficient space to summarize both sides of that debate here. However, the conclusion is that there is no scientific evidence in favour of so-called Scientific Creationism. Furthermore, there is much evidence, observation and theory that can explain many of the complexities of the universe and life on earth.<p>: : The origin of the Argument by Design is a feeling that the existence of something as incredibly intricate as, say, a human is so improbable that surely it can't have come about by chance; that surely there must be some external intelligence directing things so that humans come from the chaos deliberately.<p>: : But if human intelligence is so improbable, surely the existence of a mind capable of fashioning an entire universe complete with conscious beings must be immeasurably more unlikely? The approach used to argue in favour of the existence of a creator can be turned around and applied to the Creationist position.<p>: : This leads us to the familiar theme of "If a creator created the universe, what created the creator?", but with the addition of spiralling improbability. The only way out is to declare that the creator was not created and just "is" (or "was").<p>: : From here we might as well ask what is wrong with saying that the universe just "is" without introducing a creator? Indeed Stephen Hawking, in his book "A Brief History of Time", explains his theory that the universe is closed and finite in extent, with no beginning or end.<p>: : The Argument From Design is often stated by analogy, in the so-called Watchmaker Argument. One is asked to imagine that one has found a watch on the beach. Does one assume that it was created by a watchmaker, or that it evolved naturally? Of course one assumes a watchmaker. Yet like the watch, the universe is intricate and complex; so, the argument goes, the universe too must have a creator.<p>: : The Watchmaker analogy suffers from three particular flaws, over and above those common to all Arguments By Design. Firstly, a watchmaker creates watches from pre-existing materials, whereas God is claimed to have created the universe from nothing. These two sorts of creation are clearly fundamentally different, and the analogy is therefore rather weak.<p>: : Secondly, a watchmaker makes watches, but there are many other things in the world. If we walked further along the beach and found a nuclear reactor, we wouldn't assume it was created by the watchmaker. The argument would therefore suggest a multitude of creators, each responsible for a different part of creation (or a different universe, if you allow the possibility that there might be more than one).<p>: : Finally, in the first part of the watchmaker argument we conclude that the watch is not part of nature because it is ordered, and therefore stands out from the randomness of nature. Yet in the second part of the argument, we start from the position that the universe is obviously not random, but shows elements of order. The Watchmaker argument is thus internally inconsistent.<p>: : Apart from logical inconsistencies in the watchmaker argument, it's worth pointing out that biological systems and mechanical systems behave very differently. What's unlikely for a pile of gears is not necessarily unlikely for a mixture of biological molecules.<p>: Hello,<br>: Somehow I feel you have missed the main point of the watchmaker argument.  If we see a watch on the beach, yes we assume a watchmaker made it.  We do not believe that he took all the parts necessary for making the watch, threw them in a bag, shook them up, and a perfectly arranged and working mechanism assembled itself in the bag.  You could shake that baby from now 'til doomsday, and it ain't gonna happen.<p>P.S.     I defy anyone to grasp the concept of infinity.  Never the less, that doesn't mean that it is ONLY a concept.  I believe God is infinite, but I don't see how the universe could be.  The elements within it age, die and decay, therefore, it seems logical to me that the universe had a beginning, and will have an end.

: : : : Ladies and Gentlemen,
: : : : At an ever increasing rate, I am inundated with Creation Science rhetoric.  Next month, a fellow by the name of Gary Parker is coming to my local area to speak on the &quot;fallacies of Evolution&quot; and why there should be equal time granted in the science curricula for creationism. Can anyone direct me some good resources from which I can draw upon to methodically refute these nuts?  Perhaps to, point by point, provide a counter argument to all their assertions based upon science's current understanding of astronomy, cosmology, geology, biological evolution, biological chemistry, isochron dating, etc...

: : : 
: : : Here is something that might help that I had gotten from a FAQ file.
: : : ______________________________________

: : : The universe is so complex it must have been designed

: : : &quot;The presence of design in the universe proves there is a God. Surely you don't think all this appeared here just by chance?&quot;

: : : 
: : : This is known as the Argument From Design.

: : : It is a matter of dispute whether there is any element of design in the universe. Those who believe that the complexity and diversity of living creatures on the earth is evidence of a creator are best advised to read the newsgroup talk.origins for a while.

: : 
: : : There is insufficient space to summarize both sides of that debate here. However, the conclusion is that there is no scientific evidence in favour of so-called Scientific Creationism. Furthermore, there is much evidence, observation and theory that can explain many of the complexities of the universe and life on earth.

: : : The origin of the Argument by Design is a feeling that the existence of something as incredibly intricate as, say, a human is so improbable that surely it can't have come about by chance; that surely there must be some external intelligence directing things so that humans come from the chaos deliberately.

: : : But if human intelligence is so improbable, surely the existence of a mind capable of fashioning an entire universe complete with conscious beings must be immeasurably more unlikely? The approach used to argue in favour of the existence of a creator can be turned around and applied to the Creationist position.

: : : This leads us to the familiar theme of &quot;If a creator created the universe, what created the creator?&quot;, but with the addition of spiralling improbability. The only way out is to declare that the creator was not created and just &quot;is&quot; (or &quot;was&quot;).

: : : From here we might as well ask what is wrong with saying that the universe just &quot;is&quot; without introducing a creator? Indeed Stephen Hawking, in his book &quot;A Brief History of Time&quot;, explains his theory that the universe is closed and finite in extent, with no beginning or end.

: : : The Argument From Design is often stated by analogy, in the so-called Watchmaker Argument. One is asked to imagine that one has found a watch on the beach. Does one assume that it was created by a watchmaker, or that it evolved naturally? Of course one assumes a watchmaker. Yet like the watch, the universe is intricate and complex; so, the argument goes, the universe too must have a creator.

However, the conclusion is that there is no scientific evidence in favour of so-called Scientific Creationism. Furthermore, there is much evidence, observation and theory that can explain many of the complexities of the universe and life on earth.<p>The origin of the Argument by Design is a feeling that the existence of something as incredibly intricate as, say, a human is so improbable that surely it can't have come about by chance; that surely there must be some external intelligence directing things so that humans come from the chaos deliberately.<p>But if human intelligence is so improbable, surely the existence of a mind capable of fashioning an entire universe complete with conscious beings must be immeasurably more unlikely? The approach used to argue in favour of the existence of a creator can be turned around and applied to the Creationist position.<p>This leads us to the familiar theme of "If a creator created the universe, what created the creator?", but with the addition of spiralling improbability.

One is asked to imagine that one has found a watch on the beach. Does one assume that it was created by a watchmaker, or that it evolved naturally? Of course one assumes a watchmaker.

Firstly, a watchmaker creates watches from pre-existing materials, whereas God is claimed to have created the universe from nothing. These two sorts of creation are clearly fundamentally different, and the analogy is therefore rather weak.<p>Secondly, a watchmaker makes watches, but there are many other things in the world. If we walked further along the beach and found a nuclear reactor, we wouldn't assume it was created by the watchmaker. The argument would therefore suggest a multitude of creators, each responsible for a different part of creation (or a different universe, if you allow the possibility that there might be more than one).<p>Finally, in the first part of the watchmaker argument we conclude that the watch is not part of nature because it is ordered, and therefore stands out from the randomness of nature. Yet in the second part of the argument, we start from the position that the universe is obviously not random, but shows elements of order. The Watchmaker argument is thus internally inconsistent.<p>Apart from logical inconsistencies in the watchmaker argument, it's worth pointing out that biological systems and mechanical systems behave very differently. What's unlikely for a pile of gears is not necessarily unlikely for a mixture of biological molecules.<p>

<br>: Speaking of taxpayer funding and insidious encroachments, I was just checking out the American Atheists' web page (http://www.atheists.org/visitors.center/intro.html) and their literature makes the claim that American taxpayers are supporting christianity through tax dollars.  AA points out that churches and businesses owned by churches are tax exempt. Also there are no taxes on properties owned by churches, including land (20% of privately owned land is held by churches, according to AA). Therefore, the rest of the taxpayers have to pay more (about $200 per year per person) in order to support this policy.  Anyone care to comment on this issue?<p>The tax exempt status of churches is probably the biggest complaint of groups such as 'freedom from religion' and 'freethinkers: separation of church and state' - If I remember correctly, there has been some headway made to stop this by groups such as those mentioned. I think the more the issue is brought to the public eye (as very few people know facts such as these) - the more likely we will see something being done about it. It's my opinion that churches and all that is affiliated with them should survive on their own. Congregations seem to have no disputes about donating money to their churches or else they can practice tithing again (if they ever stopped). Also, when I take a drive in some of the poor neighbourhoods around here and see beautiful new churches being built amongst the trailer homes - or when I hear about how much profit the 700 Club et al, rakes in - it makes me a bit angry that they continue to be tax exempt. If they can't survive on their own two feet like the rest of us have to do - then it's just the natural course of things (social/business darwinism) that they become extinct.

Also, when I take a drive in some of the poor neighbourhoods around here and see beautiful new churches being built amongst the trailer homes - or when I hear about how much profit the 700 Club et al, rakes in - it makes me a bit angry that they continue to be tax exempt. If they can't survive on their own two feet like the rest of us have to do - then it's just the natural course of things (social/business darwinism) that they become extinct.

Kepp me posted if you hear anything.<p><br>If this is true I'd be interested in knowing how Ms. O'Hair can justify such a petition. It is my understanding that the stated goals of the American Atheists (of which she is the founder) do not include any effort toward restricting the freedom to practice any religion, but instead wish to prevent the imposition of religious belief systems on non-believers, particulary through government involvement. Broadcast religion doesn't seem to me to be much of an imposition since, as Amanda pointed out, the disinterested are free to switch stations or turn it off at will.  I can't really imagine that atheists would perceive these broadcasts as a threat to their freedom.  Also, wouldn't such an amendment as this petition seeks to promote violate the Constitution on several points?  Its an interesting question, because applying it to a more extreme situation, one would have to ask if we should prevent the desemination of information pertaining to certain points-of-view that might be considered dangerous, i.e. neo-nazi propaganda, or the messages of the hate-mongers.  <br>

: : : whose efforts successfully eliminated the use of the 
: : : Bible reading and prayer from All public schools 
: : : fifteen years ago [What was the date?] has been granted

: : : the petition, R.R. 2493, which would in effect pave the

: : : are restricted by hospitilization and recouparation
: : : [sic] from illnesses, who depend on the media of
: : : television and radio to fullfill [sic] their worship
: : : needs every week [?].

: : : Madelyn is also campaigning to remove all Christmas and
: : : Jewish Programs, songs, and carols from public schools.
: : : This time you can HELP!  We need 1,000,000 signed 
: : : letters to defeat Mrs. O'Hare's efforts and show that 
: : : there [are] many God worshipping Americans alive and
: : : well, and concerned about our country.  Madelyn is also
: : : trying to remove the statement &quot;IN GOD WE TRUST&quot; from
: : : all the currency in this country.  

: : 
: : Wow - that's interesting. It looks a bit valid from the motive point of view. It could also be a group formed under her name - I imagine there's one of those out there somewhere. 
: : I can't see how she could make any headway on the radio ban - it's freedom of speech and us atheists don't have to listen to it if we don't want to. I can't see censorship being of any help. I do agree with trying to get &quot;in god we trust&quot; off the currency though and things like swearing on the bible in court rooms.
: : The last I had read was that Madelyn was in Texas. I don't think she was ever missing - I think she just got out of the spotlight. There was also a rumour going around that she ran away with $600,000 - I have no idea if this is true or not but I doubt it. Kepp me posted if you hear anything.

: 
: If this is true I'd be interested in knowing how Ms. O'Hair can justify such a petition. It is my understanding that the stated goals of the American Atheists (of which she is the founder) do not include any effort toward restricting the freedom to practice any religion, but instead wish to prevent the imposition of religious belief systems on non-believers, particulary through government involvement. Broadcast religion doesn't seem to me to be much of an imposition since, as Amanda pointed out, the disinterested are free to switch stations or turn it off at will.  I can't really imagine that atheists would perceive these broadcasts as a threat to their freedom.  Also, wouldn't such an amendment as this petition seeks to promote violate the Constitution on several points?  Its an interesting question, because applying it to a more extreme situation, one would have to ask if we should prevent the desemination of information pertaining to certain points-of-view that might be considered dangerous, i.e. neo-nazi propaganda, or the messages of the hate-mongers.

In Reply to: <a href="650.html">Re: late entry into Lynn and Stephen's conversation </a> posted by Tyler on December 30, 1996 at 13:17:29:<p>
<br>: <br>: : I'd like to make a late entry into the conversation <br>: : between Lynn and Stephen regarding the origins of the <br>: : universe and evolution.  Lynn asked several times for <br>: : an explanation of how an orderly universe could arise <br>: : from the chaos after the big bang.  True, a universe <br>: : full of aimless particles and lawless energy would never<br>: : produce order "of itself." But the gases and energy of<br>: :  the early universe had to answer to the laws of physics.<br>: : Cosmologists don't know exactly how gravity and <br>: : quantum mechanics formed the stars and the planets <br>: : and the pulsars -- but none doubts that it happened.   <p>: <br>: Hello again Chris, and welcome to a magificent site!  I've learned much here.<p>: I must have missed the exchange, but I guess I'd like to ask for a definition of "orderly".  Is there a universal sense in which to use this word, or is it a perception?  The view from physics is that the idea of order arises from the state of lowest potential energy.  If the universe is indeed cyclic, waxing and waning through implosion and explosion, then I have to argue that we are continuing into disorder as the universe expands (but you'll have to accept that well-evidenced axiom first).  This is in accordance with the 2nd Law of Thermodynamics; the universe as a whole is experiencing a continuously decreasing energy density.  As a finite and static quantity of energy spreads into the larger and larger volume, the higher and higher entropy becomes............ from the perspective of science.<p><br>I suppose by "orderly", I am referring to things like the revolving of the planets, the fact that you can use the stars and such to tell time, months, days, etc., the complexity of DNA, mathematics, a leaf, you name it.  We have not even begun to comprehend the awesomeness of creation.  If the universe is "experiencing a continuously decreasing energy density" it is because it is aging.  The Bible says it will "wear out and be rolled up like and old garment".<br>

I also would add that in mathematics, Godel's Incompleteness Theorem pretty much shut the door on the idea that mathematics is self-coherent.  In this monumental proof, the conclusion was made that in any rigidly logical system, propositions exist that are undecidable and/or undemonstrable within the axioms of the system.  Mathematics is just not internally consistent, primarily from the fact that the base assumptions on which everything is built rest on non-proven footing; they are assumed "self-evident" (things like the sum of interior angles on a triangle = 180 degrees, two points demark a line, the shortest distance btw. two points is a straight line, etc.).

: I suppose by "orderly", I am referring to things like the revolving of the planets, the fact that you can use the stars and such to tell time, months, days, etc., the complexity of DNA, mathematics, a leaf, you name it.  We have not even begun to comprehend the awesomeness of creation.  If the universe is "experiencing a continuously decreasing energy density" it is because it is aging.  The Bible says it will "wear out and be rolled up like and old garment".<p>Many make the mistake of assuming that since the Universe seems to be "orderly" that it must have a creator, but we are only comparing it to our own limited perceptions of it. The Universe may not operation on a human scale. Things are not as orderly as they may seem at first glance.  The orbits of the planets are not perfect, The majority of our DNA is "junk" and unused, plus it mutates a lot. As for math try muiltipling 1/3 by 3 and see if you can get 100. It's all a matter of scale and perspective.<p>The Bible also says that bats are fowl, and that rabbits chew their cud, both incorrect.<br>

: : I suppose by &quot;orderly&quot;, I am referring to things like the revolving of the planets, the fact that you can use the stars and such to tell time, months, days, etc., the complexity of DNA, mathematics, a leaf, you name it.  We have not even begun to comprehend the awesomeness of creation.  If the universe is &quot;experiencing a continuously decreasing energy density&quot; it is because it is aging.  The Bible says it will &quot;wear out and be rolled up like and old garment&quot;.

: Many make the mistake of assuming that since the Universe seems to be &quot;orderly&quot; that it must have a creator, but we are only comparing it to our own limited perceptions of it. The Universe may not operation on a human scale. Things are not as orderly as they may seem at first glance.  The orbits of the planets are not perfect, The majority of our DNA is &quot;junk&quot; and unused, plus it mutates a lot. As for math try muiltipling 1/3 by 3 and see if you can get 100. It's all a matter of scale and perspective.

: The Bible also says that bats are fowl, and that rabbits chew their cud, both incorrect.

<p>I'd like to make a late entry into the conversation <br>between Lynn and Stephen regarding the origins of the <br>universe and evolution.  Lynn asked several times for <br>an explanation of how an orderly universe could arise <br>from the chaos after the big bang.  True, a universe <br>full of aimless particles and lawless energy would never<br>produce order "of itself." But the gases and energy of<br> the early universe had to answer to the laws of physics.<br>Cosmologists don't know exactly how gravity and <br>quantum mechanics formed the stars and the planets <br>and the pulsars -- but none doubts that it happened.   <p>As for evolution, Lynn says she doesn't know of any case<br>where a mutation actually helped an organism. In her <br>opinion, any adaptations are merely a case of recessive<br> genes rising to dominance.  Let's examine the case of <br>Adam and Eve, the first humans.  As depicted by the <br>Christians, the first humans were white humans.  White<br>skin is clearly adaptive for people living in Europe. <br> But the descendants of Adam and Eve that migrated to <br>Africa developed dark skin, a very effective defense<br>against skin cancer.  Did Adam and Eve carry <br>unexpressed recessive genes for dark skin?  If so, one<br>in four of their children would have been dark-skinned.  <p>If Adam and Eve were the first humans, a genetic <br>mutation must have crept into their bloodline, giving <br>rise to a race of people well-equipped to live in the <br>tropics. By the way, I happen to think that the story<br> worked the other way around, that the first humans had<br> dark skin and a mutation gave rise to a race of people <br>that could thrive in Northern Europe. But the point <br>remains the same.  <p>Many mutations are meaningless, some are lethal, but <br>some mutations are clearly beneficial.  The short-necked<br> ancestors of giraffes did not have recessive genes for<br> extremely long necks. Mutations that made the neck <br>incrementally longer tended to get passed on to future<br> generations  until modern giraffes could reach the very<br> tops of the trees.  Penicillin used to be extremely <br>lethal to infectious bacteria, but mutations made many <br>strains of bacteria resistant to antibiotics.  The <br>examples of beneficial mutations are endless.     <p>Sorry I entered this discussion so late.  I only <br>discovered this site a few days ago.  Looks like a <br>great place to hold a conversation.  Happy remainder of <br>the holidays.<p><br>

<br>: : Also, you or anyone interested in science ought to be reading the book that I am. It is entitled, _The End of Science; Facing the Limits of Knowledge in the Twilight of the Scientific Age_. A very compelling read so far, and you can see a synopsis of it at the Amazon Books link below.<p>: I've heard of this book and it is very short sight. They had once thought that the library at ancient Alexandria contained all the knowledge that could ever be know. Now we produce the equivilent of this library every day. The book doesn't take into account different methods of coming up with new ideas.<p>I read the excerpts from the book in the last "Skeptic" magazine - here's what I highlighted and why...let me know what you think.<p>"...But according to Darwinian theory, science stems not from our desire for truth per se but from our compulsion to control our environment in order to increas the likelihood that our genes will propogate." Yet another misinterpretation of Darwin - the list is long on all the misunderstandings and abuse of Darwins findings - much longer than the proper interpretation. Our desire for truth can in part be for the purpose of being better adapted to our environment - the more we know about the Cosmos - the more we know where we fit in and how we can make it all work to our advantage - the more we know about ourselves and our actions - the more better we can serve the purpose of our survival, so our desire for truth is advantageous to our species and this is a part of Darwinism. By evolving it may not be in our best interest to reproduce exponentially (most of us see clearly that it isn't) and so Mr. Horgan has misunderstood the theory of evolution here. We are not trying to control our environment and propogate genes solely - there is much more to it than that - our main goal is to survive and we have yet to discover what is in our best interest to attain that goal - when we do, it will more than likely fit into the theory of evolution.<p>I do agree with how he explains soceity's support of science by quoting Stent - unfortunately he's right in this area and society's lack of support will end up to our disadvantage in the short and long term. <p>The idea that science will end is an example of a bad joke to me - and I am not at all in agreement of it. I see it diminishing in importance due to soceity's lack of support but no doubt - actually, that's happening right now - but we'll see that it leads to further problems and support will again rise - science will never stop. <p>Here's another part I highlighted that fits into my work -<br>"Although it cannot compete with science's far more compelling stories about the physical realm, religion still retains some value in offering moral guidance." I, you may have guessed, disagree with this very very much. The myth that religion is responisble for morality is one area that all sorts of people, from every walk of life, are still terribly misinformed about - and there is evidence of course to back my claim up. Morality is inherrent in our nature and can be seen in other social species from all categories. The earliest fossils found are called stromatolites - they're generated by mats of bacteria and the individual cells live together in order to survive. We see in ants also a society based on getting along and sharing. The morals that include our species working together and all the wonderful things that go with that - kindness, sharing, love, etc... is inherent in our nature and it is in our best interest to survive so that is why we see it. Now look at the other things like reclusit, racism, war etc.. - they have been started by misconceptions between right and wrong - by movements such as religious ones - they are not in our best interest to survive yet - few people have realized that. Here is another way people have misunderstood Darwin - the inappropriate phrase "survival of the fittest" has been used to justify war between our own people or to justify the killing off of what some people see as the "inferior" class. We are a species - we either are all fit to surive or we are not - there is no boundary between us of fit and unfit. We see in other species - the strong protecting the weak and helping them along when need be - it is in their species best interest to do so in order that they survive. It is in our species interest to help those who are weak among us not to kill them off - but by minimizing ignorance and the other causes that make them weak. To me, religion has nothing to do with this morality and as I'm sure you know, has worked against it many times in the past and I claim, they continue to do so. Dependency does not work - as can be seen both in religion and in government proposals such as welfare - we need to work to break that dependency and increase strength.<p>He also states that science keeps imposing limits on itself by the advancements it makes - like Einstein's theory - this too is a joke. If there are limits we must work inside them but of course continue to question them for the limits may not actually be what they appear to be. Science in no way works against itself - how can one explain that?<p>Another statement "we have come so far so fast" - I hear this everywhere "- wow, look at what science and technology has discovered - it's advancing so quickly!" I laugh here too. Look at the timeline we're using -  from the Greeks onward to the Renaissance - science was suppressed almost completely and in the last couple of centuries we've been able to break the bondage a bit but still it continues to be supressed by a variety of influences - one of the major ones being religion. It could go a lot "faster" - and we'd most likely be much more advanced now if it was let loose to roam freely in the first place. The idea that it has been advancing without interuption is not true. <p>He mentions the adverse consequences of science and yes, these have to be taken into consideration. Along with advancements in science we also need to advance in several other fields - ourselves being top priority here so that we don't have idiots using nuclear weapons to destroy parts of our species et al. We need to figure out what's in our best interest but science as a tool is a very important part of that goal and we can't lose it because of the bad it's done - like criminals we need to understand the reasons why the bad was done to fix the problem. <p>Another highlight which I still have to think about because I believe there's a little truth to it and we need to work to avoid it is "As scientists become more arrogant and less tolerant of other belief systems, notably religious ones, Spengler declared, soceity will rebel against science and embrace religious fundamentalism and other irrational systems of belief." I think this might be going on right now - it's fucking scary. One thing must be said and that's the idea that it is the scientists who have the answers - no, no, no - they are just the mediums and they aren't the only ones. I've been around my share of scientists and a lot of what they are about I disagree with - there are a few who have worked towards the goal but only a few - Carl Sagan and Stphen J Gould are among these few but there have been others throughout the ages and will no doubt continue to be some in the future. I pick on scientists as well because I understand science - much of it - and I disagree with the idea that the people behind it are the key to our survival. So many of them are terribly one sided and focussed soley on their area of expertise and cannot apply it to the big picture. So many of them haven't a clue about reality and the many other fields that will help us solve a few of our serious problems. Science is an important tool - probably the most important - but there is so much else that must be considered - history, philosphy, psychology, and the majority of people that live in this world that are ignorant of ALL. I dropped out of my science degree after 2 years of studies as I felt I wasn't learning a damn thing I didn't already know and because it was so terribly confined to the one subject that it would lead me in the wrong direction. Since then I've educated myself and though I know I'm far from the ideal well-rounded person - and I've got mountains to climb that will take me 5 lifetimes - I do believe what I see is a damn fine picture of the way it actually is and the advantage to the life I've lived has been to also see possible solutions. I may be completely wrong - I do accept that possibility - but I figure if my end result is to make this place a better place then by trying to voice my opinions - I figure there is nothing to lose. Everyone should voice their opinions I think, in whatever subject interests them and no matter if they have an immense and complex formal education or if they've been living on the streets or in prisons all their lives. Evolution will weed out the bad opinions naturally - if our intelligent people continue to strive for the betterment of soceity.<p>"we have been deluded into thinking that such a rate of progress can be maintained indefinately" Quote of Glass in the book. I think we're looking at this the wrong way - maybe we won't have great discoveries like that of evolution and relativity but now we will begin to see progress in other areas due to the discoveries of science. Look at medicine and psychology - we're beginning to understand ouselves and have a ha\eck of a way to go. Look at all the room we've got left to figure out the brain - what will we find? What wonders will be next in technology? What effect will nanotechnology have on soceity - It's so freaking exciting I can hardly attain myself. I don't think I'm deluded - maybe I am but I see great things in our future if we figure out how to weed out the bad. I'm not entirely optimistic - sometimes I get little Philip Dick type dystopias running through my thoughts but shit, we can't give up - let's go go go! A universal pep rally would be appropriate here; I used to be a cheerleader, maybe I can contribute!<p>Two more comments and then I'll let you mull it all over. (I've had far too much caffeine today - that's my excuse for this lengthy post)<p>"both physics and science as a whole are now beseiged by environmentalists, animal-rights activists, and other anti-scientific movements." I agree with this but I don't agree that those two types mentioned are necessarily anti-science. Sure, there are the extremes and they can really get under my skin but I consider myself an envirmentalist and I am in no way anti-science. I think there are others like me also. The ones that are intelligent and have qualms about science usually have something worthwhile to listen to and neither side should be discounted - in most cases a happy medium can be found which will advance science in the proper direction and protect the environment as well. The altruists however in these groups are seriously misguided and should be enlightened.<p>And then there is a comment that both the ignorant masses and the highbrow types find scientific knowledge mildly interesting. No wonder! The majority of it has been made far too complicated for the simple mind or the explanations given are far too dry and unimaginable BUT we do have the great contributions of Sagan, Asimov, Gould and others and then the amazing tales in scifi that could be used to our advantage in getting science out to the public. They are the minority right now unfortunately but people like ourselves should follow their example and not be concerned about using big words and our misconceptions of intelligence to impress our colleagues or those we want to say "boy, that guys smart - look how he uses the word 'monosodium glutamate' instead of salt!". Humour and wit should also be an ingredient when writing cause we all love it and it will have the right effect. So - lets try to communicate to the rest of the world why we get so darn excited and happy about science - it's a fascinating part of life and so are all the others that we can do the same for. I read a book (with pictures) on oil rigs the other day - it was great. <p>Here's my purpose in life....(copyrighted of course cause it's the best thing that's ever come out of my mouth)<p>"What Bugs Bunny did for classical music, I would like to do for science." I'm not the first or the last that has this idea in mind - we can all contribute - no competition or jealousy need come into the picture. <br>

: Another statement &quot;we have come so far so fast&quot; - I hear this everywhere &quot;- wow, look at what science and technology has discovered - it's advancing so quickly!&quot; I laugh here too. Look at the timeline we're using -  from the Greeks onward to the Renaissance - science was suppressed almost completely and in the last couple of centuries we've been able to break the bondage a bit but still it continues to be supressed by a variety of influences - one of the major ones being religion. It could go a lot &quot;faster&quot; - and we'd most likely be much more advanced now if it was let loose to roam freely in the first place. The idea that it has been advancing without interuption is not true. 

: He mentions the adverse consequences of science and yes, these have to be taken into consideration. Along with advancements in science we also need to advance in several other fields - ourselves being top priority here so that we don't have idiots using nuclear weapons to destroy parts of our species et al. We need to figure out what's in our best interest but science as a tool is a very important part of that goal and we can't lose it because of the bad it's done - like criminals we need to understand the reasons why the bad was done to fix the problem. 

: Another highlight which I still have to think about because I believe there's a little truth to it and we need to work to avoid it is &quot;As scientists become more arrogant and less tolerant of other belief systems, notably religious ones, Spengler declared, soceity will rebel against science and embrace religious fundamentalism and other irrational systems of belief.&quot; I think this might be going on right now - it's fucking scary. One thing must be said and that's the idea that it is the scientists who have the answers - no, no, no - they are just the mediums and they aren't the only ones. I've been around my share of scientists and a lot of what they are about I disagree with - there are a few who have worked towards the goal but only a few - Carl Sagan and Stphen J Gould are among these few but there have been others throughout the ages and will no doubt continue to be some in the future. I pick on scientists as well because I understand science - much of it - and I disagree with the idea that the people behind it are the key to our survival. So many of them are terribly one sided and focussed soley on their area of expertise and cannot apply it to the big picture. So many of them haven't a clue about reality and the many other fields that will help us solve a few of our serious problems. Science is an important tool - probably the most important - but there is so much else that must be considered - history, philosphy, psychology, and the majority of people that live in this world that are ignorant of ALL. I dropped out of my science degree after 2 years of studies as I felt I wasn't learning a damn thing I didn't already know and because it was so terribly confined to the one subject that it would lead me in the wrong direction. Since then I've educated myself and though I know I'm far from the ideal well-rounded person - and I've got mountains to climb that will take me 5 lifetimes - I do believe what I see is a damn fine picture of the way it actually is and the advantage to the life I've lived has been to also see possible solutions. I may be completely wrong - I do accept that possibility - but I figure if my end result is to make this place a better place then by trying to voice my opinions - I figure there is nothing to lose. Everyone should voice their opinions I think, in whatever subject interests them and no matter if they have an immense and complex formal education or if they've been living on the streets or in prisons all their lives. Evolution will weed out the bad opinions naturally - if our intelligent people continue to strive for the betterment of soceity.

: &quot;we have been deluded into thinking that such a rate of progress can be maintained indefinately&quot; Quote of Glass in the book. I think we're looking at this the wrong way - maybe we won't have great discoveries like that of evolution and relativity but now we will begin to see progress in other areas due to the discoveries of science. Look at medicine and psychology - we're beginning to understand ouselves and have a ha\eck of a way to go. Look at all the room we've got left to figure out the brain - what will we find? What wonders will be next in technology? What effect will nanotechnology have on soceity - It's so freaking exciting I can hardly attain myself. I don't think I'm deluded - maybe I am but I see great things in our future if we figure out how to weed out the bad. I'm not entirely optimistic - sometimes I get little Philip Dick type dystopias running through my thoughts but shit, we can't give up - let's go go go! A universal pep rally would be appropriate here; I used to be a cheerleader, maybe I can contribute!

: Two more comments and then I'll let you mull it all over. (I've had far too much caffeine today - that's my excuse for this lengthy post)

: &quot;both physics and science as a whole are now beseiged by environmentalists, animal-rights activists, and other anti-scientific movements.&quot; I agree with this but I don't agree that those two types mentioned are necessarily anti-science. Sure, there are the extremes and they can really get under my skin but I consider myself an envirmentalist and I am in no way anti-science. I think there are others like me also. The ones that are intelligent and have qualms about science usually have something worthwhile to listen to and neither side should be discounted - in most cases a happy medium can be found which will advance science in the proper direction and protect the environment as well. The altruists however in these groups are seriously misguided and should be enlightened.

: And then there is a comment that both the ignorant masses and the highbrow types find scientific knowledge mildly interesting. No wonder! The majority of it has been made far too complicated for the simple mind or the explanations given are far too dry and unimaginable BUT we do have the great contributions of Sagan, Asimov, Gould and others and then the amazing tales in scifi that could be used to our advantage in getting science out to the public. They are the minority right now unfortunately but people like ourselves should follow their example and not be concerned about using big words and our misconceptions of intelligence to impress our colleagues or those we want to say &quot;boy, that guys smart - look how he uses the word 'monosodium glutamate' instead of salt!&quot;. Humour and wit should also be an ingredient when writing cause we all love it and it will have the right effect. So - lets try to communicate to the rest of the world why we get so darn excited and happy about science - it's a fascinating part of life and so are all the others that we can do the same for. I read a book (with pictures) on oil rigs the other day - it was great. 

: Here's my purpose in life....(copyrighted of course cause it's the best thing that's ever come out of my mouth)

: &quot;What Bugs Bunny did for classical music, I would like to do for science.&quot; I'm not the first or the last that has this idea in mind - we can all contribute - no competition or jealousy need come into the picture.

: : : :Do you not think we would be better off in believing in things that we can see - things that are natural - things that are realistic? : : Be careful about this sort of talk. What you describe, if I understand your words correctly, leaves out theoretical exercises. What of atomic theory? Surely on the scale of our existence, it was once thought, these things are not worthy of out attention. Now it's the quantum, and the two relativity theories? Most undeniably, relativity has no applications to our slothly motions. It does assist us in astrophysics, but that also is a pragmatists thorn. Pure mathematicians do not deal in the tangible, the visible, the mundane. What they do now may become applied mathematics in the future, but today it is absolute abstraction. AND there remains a large body of work that is centuries old but has no applications. This would bring us to the fine arts and music. Neither deal much with the tangible or mundane; they are in the realm of transcendence and ineffability. Both give us glimpses behind, through, or outside the human experience. Should these not be persued?

It may not be a hoax, however, G. Patrick Flanagan, who became known in the 70's for patenting pyramid-power devices, is no crank, but is one of America's formost inventor, who was known early on for his genius. There is a new biogrphay of Flanagan, but I can't remember the title. He has stated that when he firts heard about pyramid power, that he did some experiments, and said that they worked, but that they did not work consistently-which may explain the variability of the results of scientific tests.

<br>: So I'm reading my paper over a nice cup of coffee<br>: this morning (Santa Rosa Press Democrat for Monday December 16, 1996)<br>: and the front page article on the *Business* page is:<br>: "Making the write (sic) choice - Exchange Bank uses graphology<br>: in recuiting". I CANT BELIEVE THIS! I blink hoping that it<br>: is just a typo, but no, it is an article (taking up almost<br>: 2 *whole* newspaper pages) on how this "conservative <br>: 106-year old" bank "and a growing number of companies<br>: across the country are using newly sophisticated handwriting<br>: studies in their personnel decisions." I won't go on about<br>: this because the article speaks for itself. If you are interested,<br>: the article is on the web at: www.pressdemo.com/news/12-16/st004.html<br>: If you want to call the bank to comment (I did), the name of the woman<br>: at the bank is Sharon Stockham (she is quoted in the article) - <br>: the number there is: (707) 524-3222.<p>: Lori Bowden<br>: Santa Rosa CA<p><br>Dear Lori,<p>I am equally outraged, but not suprised.

It sound's to me like the handwriting thing might be a way of not hiring someone without telling them the real reason why.<p>I really have no hope that the trend will change.  <p>By the way, just for fun, a lady came to the radio station where I work and did a handwriting analysis of all the disc jockeys.  It's really amazing how accurate she was.  It's a good thing they didn't use this kind of analysis in hiring me.  She said I was so sensitive that I could almost feel what people are thinking.  This is not necessarily a good thing.

: Dear Lori,

: I am equally outraged, but not suprised.  Your employer may also access your medical records and credit history, give you a psychological exam and/or polygraph test, deny employment to you if you smoke, award bonus's according to how thin you are (it's true...a friend of mine works at a place that gives bonus's based on your height/weight ratio), pee in a cup...well, I could go on forever.  It sound's to me like the handwriting thing might be a way of not hiring someone without telling them the real reason why.

: I really have no hope that the trend will change.  

: By the way, just for fun, a lady came to the radio station where I work and did a handwriting analysis of all the disc jockeys.  It's really amazing how accurate she was.  It's a good thing they didn't use this kind of analysis in hiring me.  She said I was so sensitive that I could almost feel what people are thinking.  This is not necessarily a good thing.

I won't go on about<br>this because the article speaks for itself.

: : Dear Lori,

: : I am equally outraged, but not suprised.  Your employer may also access your medical records and credit history, give you a psychological exam and/or polygraph test, deny employment to you if you smoke, award bonus's according to how thin you are (it's true...a friend of mine works at a place that gives bonus's based on your height/weight ratio), pee in a cup...well, I could go on forever.  It sound's to me like the handwriting thing might be a way of not hiring someone without telling them the real reason why.

: : I really have no hope that the trend will change.  

: : By the way, just for fun, a lady came to the radio station where I work and did a handwriting analysis of all the disc jockeys.  It's really amazing how accurate she was.  It's a good thing they didn't use this kind of analysis in hiring me.  She said I was so sensitive that I could almost feel what people are thinking.  This is not necessarily a good thing.

This has been a great learning experience for me.  Not only do I have a better understanding of skeptics/agnostics/atheists, but your last posting sent me on a search for evidence of my own beliefs that has left me feeling great!<br>I've decided not to try and convince you any longer.  If I do, I'm going to start sounding like a preacher.  I can sight scientists and experts who say one thing.  You can sight those who have a differing opinion. The argument is ultimately spiritual and, unless you tell me otherwise, I assume that's not somewhere you want to go.  Having said that, let me tell you one thing that I am so excited about that I've got to share it.<p>I'm having the greatest Christmas ever!  I am experiencing some of those "percieved" miracles.  As I stated in my original posting, I am here out of concern for my loved ones.  If you knew them, you would KNOW that it's a miracle that my mom, dad, and brother <br>are now praying and reading the Bible.  I only found out yesterday!<br>Their experience seems to be taking shape much the way mine did.   I am so thrilled that even though we are living a thousand miles apart here on earth, that we'll be together in perfect love in the paradise <br>of God, forever.   Yipeeeeeeeeee!!

: : : Old Testament. To me, the evidence of antiquity of the earth is beyond
: : : reasonable doubt. The account of creation cannot be taken literally.

: : : There are a number of Old Testament accounts that are impossible. 
: : : For example, the ark. 
: : : There is simply no possible way that all the species that exist could
: : : fit, survive, or anything in a vessel that size. So, the apologists,
: : : such as Gish et al propose &quot;kinds&quot; rather that species, and suggest
: : : some limited &quot;evolution&quot; from kind to species. This also was a recent
: : : as 3000 years ago, if you use a literal approach and accept Usher's 
: : : chronology. Whether 3000 or 8000 years (the maximum suggested by the 
: : : creation science people the last I heard) you would still have to 
: : : accept an extremely rapid rate of evolution to develop all the species
: : : existing today from the number of &quot;kinds&quot; that could fit in and 
: : : survive in the ark. For these, and other reasons (ex. geological 
: : : evidence lacking, etc.) I find that the story of the flood has to be
: : : viewed as non-literal.

: : : On to the New Testament. I personally know people who could write 
: : : something like it.  They are sincere, they believe, and they want
: : : to help the cause. With wishful thinking they convince themselves of
: : : all kinds of miracles or &quot;interventions&quot; by God (answers to prayer) 
: : : of some kind or another. Eyewitness accounts written and recorded
: : : 70 to 120 years after the fact by a second or third party could
: : : contain some of the same &quot;wishful thinking&quot;. Is it possible to be a 
: : : part of something that is &quot;in part&quot; a piece of wishful thinking, and 
: : : then be willing to die for it?  Yes, there seems to be ample evidence
: : : of that around in the Jonestowns, the Koreshes, etc.

: : : These are some of the things that put me into the agnostic camp. I 
: : : cannot say there is &quot;not&quot; a god out there somewhere. I am quite 
: : : convinced that if there is, that she/he is not the god that I grew up
: : : believing in as an evangelical christian.

: : 
: : You bring up some valid points.  These are areas I hope to have a better understanding of someday.  Hopefully I will be able to respond soon.


: Hi, I'm back, Bob.

: First, I want to thank you and everyone at this message board for your gracious hospitality.  This has been a great learning experience for me.  Not only do I have a better understanding of skeptics/agnostics/atheists, but your last posting sent me on a search for evidence of my own beliefs that has left me feeling great!
: I've decided not to try and convince you any longer.  If I do, I'm going to start sounding like a preacher.  I can sight scientists and experts who say one thing.  You can sight those who have a differing opinion. The argument is ultimately spiritual and, unless you tell me otherwise, I assume that's not somewhere you want to go.  Having said that, let me tell you one thing that I am so excited about that I've got to share it.

: I'm having the greatest Christmas ever!  I am experiencing some of those &quot;percieved&quot; miracles.  As I stated in my original posting, I am here out of concern for my loved ones.  If you knew them, you would KNOW that it's a miracle that my mom, dad, and brother 
: are now praying and reading the Bible.  I only found out yesterday!
: Their experience seems to be taking shape much the way mine did.   I am so thrilled that even though we are living a thousand miles apart here on earth, that we'll be together in perfect love in the paradise 
: of God, forever.   Yipeeeeeeeeee!!

Hello Skeptical Friends,<p>I'm really trying to understand the philosophy of the Skeptics's Society  I've looked in the dictiontionary under "agnostic", "atheist", and "skeptic", yet I haven't found a satisfactory definition.  I'm trying to determine if "skeptics" assume there is some sort of higher power, but that the truth of the matter is unknowable, therefore, unsearchable.

<p>: : I'm sure you have some of his writings.  I have never read him.  Would you care to share a few of his thoughts that have made an impact on you?<p>: He has two very good books that are more of an objective outlook on the history of philosophy but by looking at philosophy they cover many other areas as well. When I read "Wisdom of the West" - I didn't know very much about the various philosophers through the ages and many of them that I've attempted to understand have been far too difficult for me. Russell has a similar 'poplularizing' talent for philosophy as Sagan does for science or TH Huxley had for darwinism. He explains things well - clearly - and has a great sense of humour. He's also known for his contributions to math and logic but I haven't delved into those areas very much. I suppose the most influential writings were those on religion. He has written a very famous essay entitled "Why I Am Not A Christian" - a book by that name also includes several other essays on the topic of religion. In the essay he refutes the proofs of God that Aquinas is known for and which continue to prevail in Catholic schools. He discusses the charater of Christ and the defects in his teachings. He covers the moral issues, the emotional issues, fear as the foundation for religion and how religion has retarded progress. He concludes the essay with a "what we must do" bit that is very realistic. The entire essay is a good read - he's not as nasty as people make him out to be - his arguments are based on intelligent thought and evidence and his purpose in all of it was to try to make this world a better place. There's also a great recounting of an experience he had in New York - when he was asked to be a professor there but then the clergy got involved and a court case insued and injustice was rampant. He's believed by some to be a contributor to the 'free love' of the 60s - supposedly advocating promiscuity and such. But this is not so. He wrote a lot on sex and relationships and marriage and what he wrote was worthwhile. We can all see that divorce and adultery are common things in our society - he attempts to reduce such things by his philosophy. One other bit of info I enjoyed reading was how once philosophy and science were very much a part of eachother but after christianity was adopted by the Romans and Popes no longer tolerated the support of science - many philosphers were too scared to discuss science and focussed more on thought as it pertains to God. Mnay of the philosphers were also commissioned by the papacy and therefore built there philosophies around the 'truths' of the church. Comments?<p>Would you comment further on his teachings about Christ and scripture.  I would appreciate an opportunity to refute his claims, as I'm sure I would disagree, from what you have told me so far.

: : I'm sure you have some of his writings.  I have never read him.  Would you care to share a few of his thoughts that have made an impact on you?

: He has two very good books that are more of an objective outlook on the history of philosophy but by looking at philosophy they cover many other areas as well. When I read &quot;Wisdom of the West&quot; - I didn't know very much about the various philosophers through the ages and many of them that I've attempted to understand have been far too difficult for me. Russell has a similar 'poplularizing' talent for philosophy as Sagan does for science or TH Huxley had for darwinism. He explains things well - clearly - and has a great sense of humour. He's also known for his contributions to math and logic but I haven't delved into those areas very much. I suppose the most influential writings were those on religion. He has written a very famous essay entitled &quot;Why I Am Not A Christian&quot; - a book by that name also includes several other essays on the topic of religion. In the essay he refutes the proofs of God that Aquinas is known for and which continue to prevail in Catholic schools. He discusses the charater of Christ and the defects in his teachings. He covers the moral issues, the emotional issues, fear as the foundation for religion and how religion has retarded progress. He concludes the essay with a &quot;what we must do&quot; bit that is very realistic. The entire essay is a good read - he's not as nasty as people make him out to be - his arguments are based on intelligent thought and evidence and his purpose in all of it was to try to make this world a better place. There's also a great recounting of an experience he had in New York - when he was asked to be a professor there but then the clergy got involved and a court case insued and injustice was rampant. He's believed by some to be a contributor to the 'free love' of the 60s - supposedly advocating promiscuity and such. But this is not so. He wrote a lot on sex and relationships and marriage and what he wrote was worthwhile. We can all see that divorce and adultery are common things in our society - he attempts to reduce such things by his philosophy. One other bit of info I enjoyed reading was how once philosophy and science were very much a part of eachother but after christianity was adopted by the Romans and Popes no longer tolerated the support of science - many philosphers were too scared to discuss science and focussed more on thought as it pertains to God. Mnay of the philosphers were also commissioned by the papacy and therefore built there philosophies around the 'truths' of the church. Comments?

He quotes two other of Christ's teachings that he likes but says they aren't practiced by the majority of Christians - these are: "Give to him that asketh of thee, and from him that would borrow of thee turn not thou away" and  "If thou wilt be perfect, go and sell that which thou hast, and give to the poor." These comments were all under the heading "The Character of Christ".<br>Under the heading "Defects in Christ's Teachings" he gives examples of how Christ appears in the Gospels and why he doesn't find them very wise. If you take it narratively it certainly looks that Christ thought His second coming would occur before the death of all the people who were living at that time. Comments like "There are some standing here which shall not taste death till the Son of Man comes into His kingdom". Russell also remarks that Christ believed in Hell and believed that and person who is profoundly humane can not believe in everlasting punishment. There appears tobe a vindictive fury associated with Christ in the Gospels, against those people who would not listen to his preaching. He compares Christ to Socrates and I enjoyed the comparison. He quotes such lines as "Ye serpents, ye generation of vipers, how can ye escape the damnation of hell." and "Whosoever speaketh against the Holy Ghost it shall not be forgiven him niether in this World nor in the world to come." That last bit has caused a lot of misery in this world for people who have believed that they committed a sin and would never be forgiven. Russell claims that a person with a proper degree of kindliness in his nature would not have put fears and terrors of this sort into the world. He also quotes the sayings of Christ regarding hell and what it will be like - "wailing and gnashing of teeth", "fire that shall never be quenched" and claims it put added cruelty into the world and gave the world generations of cruel torture. <br>I only looked at the one essay to give you this info - there is much more and would be happy to give it to you if you want. I think Russell makes some good points on this subject but I have come across other people who perhaps do a better job at discussing Christ. Anyway, let me know what you think.

I think I should probably get one of his books and read it for myself so we can have a more interesting debate, never the less, I will take a stab at a couple of these points.<p>I believe portions of the truth are sure to be found in most religions, (there are probably exceptions).  Truth is truth, and it is not hidden only for a chosen few to find.  The problem is, most of us, Christians included, like to pick out the part of the truth that suits us.<p>"Judge not, lest ye be judged", means that Christians are not supposed to condemn others in our hearts and decide the condition of their spiritual health.  I have always found it to be true that when I become angry with someone and get all eat up over it, I start looking at their life and pointing out all that is I see that is wrong in order to prove to myself that I am the better person, therefore, I am right.  Inevitably, God will show me how I have also committed those same errors in one form or another (and many others besides), and reminds me about the depths from which I have been rescued, and that I ought to be thankful that the One who forgives me is far nobler, kinder, and merciful than I was just being to that other person.  This is when I am reminded of the words, "judge not lest ye be judged".  <br>This is not an instruction to let criminals run amuck.  America is considered to be a Christian country, founded on Christian principles, at least that's what people on both sides of the God issue keep telling me.  It is my understanding that we have a pretty liberal justice system compared to most countries.  Have I been misinformed?<p>"There are some standing here who will not taste of death until they see the Son of Man come into his Kingdom" is not a very good example of that very interesting point.  This is referring to the Transfiguation of Christ, when the apostles witnessed Jesus in his  glorified state talking with Moses and Elijah in a cloud.  <br>The Jews living at that time were witnessing the "end of the age" as pertaining to the Old Testament law and the way they percieved God.<br>As Jesus was being led to the cross, a woman was following behind him weeping and waling.  Jesus said something to the effect of, "Woman do not weep for me, but for yourself and your children."  There were terrible times of persecution and war after Jesus' death.  There are many references to these times of trouble in the New Testament, and they are sometimes hard to distinguish from end time prophecy.  I do not yet totally understand this subject myself, but I am fascinated by it and hope to have a better answer one day.<p>The thing about never being forgiven for blaspheming the Holy Spirit pertains to a particular circumstance.  If you'll notice, He says that all sins , including anything spoken against the Son of Man, (i.e., Jesus, God..) WILL be forgiven.  In this instance, someone was saying that the miracles that Jesus had performed through the Holy Spirit were of the Devil.  I guess that's where God has drawn his line where forgivenss is concerned.

: : 
: : : Would you comment further on his teachings about Christ and scripture.  I would appreciate an opportunity to refute his claims, as I'm sure I would disagree, from what you have told me so far.

: : Sure, I'd appreciate your comments.

: : He initially makes the claimthat to be a Christian one must believe that Christ was, if not divine, then the best and wisest of men. He grants Christ a very high degree of moral goodness but no divinity nor a &quot;best man&quot; title.
: : He quotes Jesus' saying &quot;Resist not evil: but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also.&quot; He shows that this is not a new principle and was used by Lao-tse and Buddha 500 years before Christ. He also quotes the &quot;Judge not lest ye be judged.&quot; line and shows how this has never been popular in the law courts of Christian countries. He quotes two other of Christ's teachings that he likes but says they aren't practiced by the majority of Christians - these are: &quot;Give to him that asketh of thee, and from him that would borrow of thee turn not thou away&quot; and  &quot;If thou wilt be perfect, go and sell that which thou hast, and give to the poor.&quot; These comments were all under the heading &quot;The Character of Christ&quot;.
: : Under the heading &quot;Defects in Christ's Teachings&quot; he gives examples of how Christ appears in the Gospels and why he doesn't find them very wise. If you take it narratively it certainly looks that Christ thought His second coming would occur before the death of all the people who were living at that time. Comments like &quot;There are some standing here which shall not taste death till the Son of Man comes into His kingdom&quot;. Russell also remarks that Christ believed in Hell and believed that and person who is profoundly humane can not believe in everlasting punishment. There appears tobe a vindictive fury associated with Christ in the Gospels, against those people who would not listen to his preaching. He compares Christ to Socrates and I enjoyed the comparison. He quotes such lines as &quot;Ye serpents, ye generation of vipers, how can ye escape the damnation of hell.&quot; and &quot;Whosoever speaketh against the Holy Ghost it shall not be forgiven him niether in this World nor in the world to come.&quot; That last bit has caused a lot of misery in this world for people who have believed that they committed a sin and would never be forgiven. Russell claims that a person with a proper degree of kindliness in his nature would not have put fears and terrors of this sort into the world. He also quotes the sayings of Christ regarding hell and what it will be like - &quot;wailing and gnashing of teeth&quot;, &quot;fire that shall never be quenched&quot; and claims it put added cruelty into the world and gave the world generations of cruel torture. 
: : I only looked at the one essay to give you this info - there is much more and would be happy to give it to you if you want. I think Russell makes some good points on this subject but I have come across other people who perhaps do a better job at discussing Christ. Anyway, let me know what you think.

: 
: Hello Amanda,

: Thank you for the information.  I think I should probably get one of his books and read it for myself so we can have a more interesting debate, never the less, I will take a stab at a couple of these points.

: I believe portions of the truth are sure to be found in most religions, (there are probably exceptions).  Truth is truth, and it is not hidden only for a chosen few to find.  The problem is, most of us, Christians included, like to pick out the part of the truth that suits us.

: &quot;Judge not, lest ye be judged&quot;, means that Christians are not supposed to condemn others in our hearts and decide the condition of their spiritual health.  I have always found it to be true that when I become angry with someone and get all eat up over it, I start looking at their life and pointing out all that is I see that is wrong in order to prove to myself that I am the better person, therefore, I am right.  Inevitably, God will show me how I have also committed those same errors in one form or another (and many others besides), and reminds me about the depths from which I have been rescued, and that I ought to be thankful that the One who forgives me is far nobler, kinder, and merciful than I was just being to that other person.  This is when I am reminded of the words, &quot;judge not lest ye be judged&quot;.  
: This is not an instruction to let criminals run amuck.  America is considered to be a Christian country, founded on Christian principles, at least that's what people on both sides of the God issue keep telling me.  It is my understanding that we have a pretty liberal justice system compared to most countries.  Have I been misinformed?

: &quot;There are some standing here who will not taste of death until they see the Son of Man come into his Kingdom&quot; is not a very good example of that very interesting point.  This is referring to the Transfiguation of Christ, when the apostles witnessed Jesus in his  glorified state talking with Moses and Elijah in a cloud.  
: The Jews living at that time were witnessing the &quot;end of the age&quot; as pertaining to the Old Testament law and the way they percieved God.
: As Jesus was being led to the cross, a woman was following behind him weeping and waling.  Jesus said something to the effect of, &quot;Woman do not weep for me, but for yourself and your children.&quot;  There were terrible times of persecution and war after Jesus' death.  There are many references to these times of trouble in the New Testament, and they are sometimes hard to distinguish from end time prophecy.  I do not yet totally understand this subject myself, but I am fascinated by it and hope to have a better answer one day.

: The thing about never being forgiven for blaspheming the Holy Spirit pertains to a particular circumstance.  If you'll notice, He says that all sins , including anything spoken against the Son of Man, (i.e., Jesus, God..) WILL be forgiven.  In this instance, someone was saying that the miracles that Jesus had performed through the Holy Spirit were of the Devil.  I guess that's where God has drawn his line where forgivenss is concerned.

I've looked at several myself (not in great depth) and I enjoy the ancient ones the most. Our creative minds are such fascinating things - I believe it is due to our curiosity and imagination that we have come this far in solving the mysteries of the Universe. I am grateful in a way, to past religions - including Christianity - for having the curiosity to ponder the big questions in the first place. Why are we here? What effect do the Cosmos have on us?

The idea to 'do unto others as you would have them do unto you' which is a bit of a take of from the 'judging' quote did not originate in Jesus' days however and was around before Judaism as well.

It was the first sign of a separation of church and state. In no way were they atheists but they did see the importance of keeping religion out of running a democracy. In the Bill of Rights - freedom of religion is an important part. Anyone should be able to practice whatever religion they like without fear of persecution. I agree with this.

Besides what I've read in the NT and a few historical accounts of the time - I know very little and understand it even less. I'm assuming you believe then that the apostles did see Jesus after he was resurrected? Do you have anything more to say about this - I'd be interested. Also, how do you interpret what Jesus meant by what he said to the crying woman?

: : As Jesus was being led to the cross, a woman was following behind him weeping and waling.  Jesus said something to the effect of, &quot;Woman do not weep for me, but for yourself and your children.&quot;  There were terrible times of persecution and war after Jesus' death.  There are many references to these times of trouble in the New Testament, and they are sometimes hard to distinguish from end time prophecy.  I do not yet totally understand this subject myself, but I am fascinated by it and hope to have a better answer one day.

: Interesting interpretation - thank you. Besides what I've read in the NT and a few historical accounts of the time - I know very little and understand it even less. I'm assuming you believe then that the apostles did see Jesus after he was resurrected? Do you have anything more to say about this - I'd be interested. Also, how do you interpret what Jesus meant by what he said to the crying woman? Also, what do you think about the idea that Christians were angry with the Jews and Romans for crucifying Jesus - do you not think that if it was God's will for Jesus to die at the cross then they shouldn't have been angry?

: : The thing about never being forgiven for blaspheming the Holy Spirit pertains to a particular circumstance.  If you'll notice, He says that all sins , including anything spoken against the Son of Man, (i.e., Jesus, God..) WILL be forgiven.  In this instance, someone was saying that the miracles that Jesus had performed through the Holy Spirit were of the Devil.  I guess that's where God has drawn his line where forgivenss is concerned.

: So if one were to say that Jesus was possessed by the devil or something to that effect, hw would not be forgiven, ever? 
: The Catholics interpret the Holy Spirit as the 'truth' - what do you interpret it as?
: It's an interesting topic...just one more question...
: Why is it that according to christian doctrines (if I've understood them correctly) would a man, who has led the mst noble of lives - been honest and kind and absolutely wonderful - but never became a Christian (perhaps even was an atheist) - why would he go to Hell and a man who was the most vile and loathsome type - commiting unspeakable crimes throughout his life - but confessed to his sins, embraced Jesus and God on his deathbed and was baptized or whatever is necessary to become a Chrsitian - why would he go to heaven?

: Thanks Lynn - I'm enjoying this 'new and better' way of debate!

: <br>: : Hello Amanda,<p>: : Thank you for the information.  I think I should probably get one of his books and read it for myself so we can have a more interesting debate, never the less, I will take a stab at a couple of these points.<p>: Most libraries should carry a few of his books - most likely a collection of his writings. Though you may not agree with him regarding religion, you might enjoy his views on other topics. Also, if you have any interest in philosphy and the life it has led - Wisdom of the West is a brilliant piece of work. <p>: : I believe portions of the truth are sure to be found in most religions, (there are probably exceptions).  Truth is truth, and it is not hidden only for a chosen few to find.  The problem is, most of us, Christians included, like to pick out the part of the truth that suits us.<p>: I'm not quite sure if I understand you here when you say that 'portions of the truth are to be found in most religions'. What sort of truth are you talking about? Do you have any examples of parts of other religions that could constitute the truth? I've looked at several myself (not in great depth) and I enjoy the ancient ones the most. Our creative minds are such fascinating things - I believe it is due to our curiosity and imagination that we have come this far in solving the mysteries of the Universe. I am grateful in a way, to past religions - including Christianity - for having the curiosity to ponder the big questions in the first place. Why are we here? What effect do the Cosmos have on us? Is there a thinking entity at the helm or are we a result of chance/accident/luck? Does form come before function or as I believe, function before form? It's wonderful to be able to ask these questions in the first place, let alone answer a few of them!<p>: : "Judge not, lest ye be judged", means that Christians are not supposed to condemn others in our hearts and decide the condition of their spiritual health.  I have always found it to be true that when I become angry with someone and get all eat up over it, I start looking at their life and pointing out all that is I see that is wrong in order to prove to myself that I am the better person, therefore, I am right.  Inevitably, God will show me how I have also committed those same errors in one form or another (and many others besides), and reminds me about the depths from which I have been rescued, and that I ought to be thankful that the One who forgives me is far nobler, kinder, and merciful than I was just being to that other person.  This is when I am reminded of the words, "judge not lest ye be judged".  <br>: : This is not an instruction to let criminals run amuck.  America is considered to be a Christian country, founded on Christian principles, at least that's what people on both sides of the God issue keep telling me.  It is my understanding that we have a pretty liberal justice system compared to most countries.  Have I been misinformed?<p>: I like your interpretation of the 'judging' quote - I too have made the same mistake of judging a person in hopes to prove I was a better person. God wasn't the one that showed me that this was wrong however - it was something I realized for myself and continue to remind myself of when the need arises. The idea to 'do unto others as you would have them do unto you' which is a bit of a take of from the 'judging' quote did not originate in Jesus' days however and was around before Judaism as well. I think it is we humans that figured this one out - a part of morality that Jesus recognized as valuable and thankfully brought to more people's attention. Unfortuantely, many christians and non-christians alike have forgotten this ethical statement and by horrific actions, have practiced the opposite.<br>: Regarding - America...this country was a product of the Enlightenment. Jefferson and Franklin were part of a society called "the Lunar Society" in England before coming here - Erasmus Darwin (Charles' grandfather) was also a member. They were what you might call freethinkers of that age and when drawing up the constitution attempted to keep Christianity or any other religion out of it. It was the first sign of a separation of church and state. In no way were they atheists but they did see the importance of keeping religion out of running a democracy. In the Bill of Rights - freedom of religion is an important part. Anyone should be able to practice whatever religion they like without fear of persecution. I agree with this. Unfortunately, much pressure was made by christian clergy and the like and the division line between church and state got a bit fuzzy, which can still be seen today.<p>: : "There are some standing here who will not taste of death until they see the Son of Man come into his Kingdom" is not a very good example of that very interesting point.

: : : 
: : : : Hello Amanda,

: : : : Thank you for the information.  I think I should probably get one of his books and read it for myself so we can have a more interesting debate, never the less, I will take a stab at a couple of these points.

: : : Most libraries should carry a few of his books - most likely a collection of his writings. Though you may not agree with him regarding religion, you might enjoy his views on other topics. Also, if you have any interest in philosphy and the life it has led - Wisdom of the West is a brilliant piece of work. 

: : : : I believe portions of the truth are sure to be found in most religions, (there are probably exceptions).  Truth is truth, and it is not hidden only for a chosen few to find.  The problem is, most of us, Christians included, like to pick out the part of the truth that suits us.

: : : I'm not quite sure if I understand you here when you say that 'portions of the truth are to be found in most religions'. What sort of truth are you talking about? Do you have any examples of parts of other religions that could constitute the truth? I've looked at several myself (not in great depth) and I enjoy the ancient ones the most. Our creative minds are such fascinating things - I believe it is due to our curiosity and imagination that we have come this far in solving the mysteries of the Universe. I am grateful in a way, to past religions - including Christianity - for having the curiosity to ponder the big questions in the first place. Why are we here? What effect do the Cosmos have on us? Is there a thinking entity at the helm or are we a result of chance/accident/luck? Does form come before function or as I believe, function before form? It's wonderful to be able to ask these questions in the first place, let alone answer a few of them!

: : : : &quot;Judge not, lest ye be judged&quot;, means that Christians are not supposed to condemn others in our hearts and decide the condition of their spiritual health.  I have always found it to be true that when I become angry with someone and get all eat up over it, I start looking at their life and pointing out all that is I see that is wrong in order to prove to myself that I am the better person, therefore, I am right.  Inevitably, God will show me how I have also committed those same errors in one form or another (and many others besides), and reminds me about the depths from which I have been rescued, and that I ought to be thankful that the One who forgives me is far nobler, kinder, and merciful than I was just being to that other person.  This is when I am reminded of the words, &quot;judge not lest ye be judged&quot;.  
: : : : This is not an instruction to let criminals run amuck.  America is considered to be a Christian country, founded on Christian principles, at least that's what people on both sides of the God issue keep telling me.  It is my understanding that we have a pretty liberal justice system compared to most countries.  Have I been misinformed?

: : : I like your interpretation of the 'judging' quote - I too have made the same mistake of judging a person in hopes to prove I was a better person. God wasn't the one that showed me that this was wrong however - it was something I realized for myself and continue to remind myself of when the need arises. The idea to 'do unto others as you would have them do unto you' which is a bit of a take of from the 'judging' quote did not originate in Jesus' days however and was around before Judaism as well. I think it is we humans that figured this one out - a part of morality that Jesus recognized as valuable and thankfully brought to more people's attention. Unfortuantely, many christians and non-christians alike have forgotten this ethical statement and by horrific actions, have practiced the opposite.
: : : Regarding - America...this country was a product of the Enlightenment. Jefferson and Franklin were part of a society called &quot;the Lunar Society&quot; in England before coming here - Erasmus Darwin (Charles' grandfather) was also a member. They were what you might call freethinkers of that age and when drawing up the constitution attempted to keep Christianity or any other religion out of it. It was the first sign of a separation of church and state. In no way were they atheists but they did see the importance of keeping religion out of running a democracy. In the Bill of Rights - freedom of religion is an important part. Anyone should be able to practice whatever religion they like without fear of persecution. I agree with this. Unfortunately, much pressure was made by christian clergy and the like and the division line between church and state got a bit fuzzy, which can still be seen today.

: : : : &quot;There are some standing here who will not taste of death until they see the Son of Man come into his Kingdom&quot; is not a very good example of that very interesting point.  This is referring to the Transfiguation of Christ, when the apostles witnessed Jesus in his  glorified state talking with Moses and Elijah in a cloud.  
: : : : The Jews living at that time were witnessing the &quot;end of the age&quot; as pertaining to the Old Testament law and the way they percieved God.
: : : : As Jesus was being led to the cross, a woman was following behind him weeping and waling.  Jesus said something to the effect of, &quot;Woman do not weep for me, but for yourself and your children.&quot;  There were terrible times of persecution and war after Jesus' death.  There are many references to these times of trouble in the New Testament, and they are sometimes hard to distinguish from end time prophecy.  I do not yet totally understand this subject myself, but I am fascinated by it and hope to have a better answer one day.

: : : Interesting interpretation - thank you. Besides what I've read in the NT and a few historical accounts of the time - I know very little and understand it even less. I'm assuming you believe then that the apostles did see Jesus after he was resurrected? Do you have anything more to say about this - I'd be interested. Also, how do you interpret what Jesus meant by what he said to the crying woman? Also, what do you think about the idea that Christians were angry with the Jews and Romans for crucifying Jesus - do you not think that if it was God's will for Jesus to die at the cross then they shouldn't have been angry?

: : : : The thing about never being forgiven for blaspheming the Holy Spirit pertains to a particular circumstance.  If you'll notice, He says that all sins , including anything spoken against the Son of Man, (i.e., Jesus, God..) WILL be forgiven.  In this instance, someone was saying that the miracles that Jesus had performed through the Holy Spirit were of the Devil.  I guess that's where God has drawn his line where forgivenss is concerned.

: : : So if one were to say that Jesus was possessed by the devil or something to that effect, hw would not be forgiven, ever? 
: : : The Catholics interpret the Holy Spirit as the 'truth' - what do you interpret it as?
: : : It's an interesting topic...just one more question...
: : : Why is it that according to christian doctrines (if I've understood them correctly) would a man, who has led the mst noble of lives - been honest and kind and absolutely wonderful - but never became a Christian (perhaps even was an atheist) - why would he go to Hell and a man who was the most vile and loathsome type - commiting unspeakable crimes throughout his life - but confessed to his sins, embraced Jesus and God on his deathbed and was baptized or whatever is necessary to become a Chrsitian - why would he go to heaven?

: : : Thanks Lynn - I'm enjoying this 'new and better' way of debate!

: : I agree that this country was not founded as a &quot;Christian&quot; nation even though most of its citizens were no doubt Christians. In a treaty with Tripoli which was passed unanimously in the senate and signed by president Adams on 6/10/1797 it was stated that: &quot;The government of the United States is not, in any sense, founded on the Christian religion&quot;. Thomas Jefferson in a letter to John Adams wrote: &quot;The day will come when the mystical generation of Jesus, by the supreme being as his father in the womb of a virgin, will be classed with the fable of the generation of Minerva in the brain of Jupiter&quot;.

: Hello Ray,

: I foudn your Thomas Jefferson quote so shocking that I went to look up some information on him.  I could hardly believe the things he was quoted as saying, as he was very anti-christian.  I'm feeling very disolutioned and betrayed by those who are certainly educated enough to know that THomas J. was not a Christian, yet they have been telling me all these years that he was.  I feel I must go and do a lot of research on history before I can continue to debate with all of you.

<br>: I read a brief blurb in NY Times Book Review on a new book that's out on Bertrand Russell - "The Spirit Of Solitude" by Ray Monk. Anybody know anything about it?

Posted by Amanda on January 06, 1997 at 07:26:01:<p>
I read a brief blurb in NY Times Book Review on a new book that's out on Bertrand Russell - "The Spirit Of Solitude" by Ray Monk. Anybody know anything about it? It seems to be a lambasting of a great man - The blurb states "an unforgiving portrait of a monstrously cruel man, this biography may be one-sided, but it contains the materials for a corrective to its hostile view." I'll have to wait until the library gets a copy because in no way do I want to support this sort of shit. In my opinion - Russell was a hell of guy - he's been influential in my own views - does anyone have anything bad to say about him? If so - let me hear it - maybe I'm one-sided on this issue myself.

Also, there is some evidence for the Big Bang Theory resulting in the arrangemeent of the galaxies, solar systems, suns and planets - it has more weight than the idea that a guy in th sky was playing with balls and stuff so the belief should sway in the former's direction.<br>If you're just using the word "god" to define what we know thus far regarding how the planets came to be - this is a bad word to use - supernaturalism is implied when using the word god.<p>: hmm...this is all a hologram...I would concider the maker of the hologram<br>: to be 'god' (all definitions)...a very detailed holagram.<p>Some psychologists have hypothesized that idea - that this is all a dream but hell, we've got to put a bit of stock in what we sense - We start by realizing that there is more to reality then what goes on in our mind - we use our senses to observe our surroundings and there are certain facts we can discover - we are real and we exist. A God making this all for us is probably the best idea out there but still, no evidence and therefore no belief.<p>: I made this world (universe we perseve)...just yesterday...to the finest detail<br>: your memories and all.<p>Ok, let's see you do it all again. Evidence - none.<p>:  There are a few...of course there are many more...I would enjoy arguing these<br>: out and I'll make up some more possiblities later.<p>The point is you have to back up your claims with evidence and you're not doing that whereas we have evidence for an explanation to this entire universe where a god is not necessary. What belief would you think would help us survive in the cosmos?<br>You do have a great imagination though, write some scifi books!

: : : Well, put 'em out on the table then - I'll try to give you some evidence for the unlikeliness. This is how we progress - we make claims, back 'em up with evidence, weigh the evidence pro and con, and believe or disbelieve. So, let's play!

: : Ok, I'll try to make up different theories of 'god', so here are a few.
: : Maybe, god creates the universe, arranging the planets...to the minute
: : detail (making it perpetually expand and all)...this god has no intrest 
: : in us now...

: This just sounds like a term being used for the indifferent laws of the Universe - some of which we've discovered. Also, there is some evidence for the Big Bang Theory resulting in the arrangemeent of the galaxies, solar systems, suns and planets - it has more weight than the idea that a guy in th sky was playing with balls and stuff so the belief should sway in the former's direction.
: If you're just using the word &quot;god&quot; to define what we know thus far regarding how the planets came to be - this is a bad word to use - supernaturalism is implied when using the word god.

: : hmm...this is all a hologram...I would concider the maker of the hologram
: : to be 'god' (all definitions)...a very detailed holagram.

: Some psychologists have hypothesized that idea - that this is all a dream but hell, we've got to put a bit of stock in what we sense - We start by realizing that there is more to reality then what goes on in our mind - we use our senses to observe our surroundings and there are certain facts we can discover - we are real and we exist. A God making this all for us is probably the best idea out there but still, no evidence and therefore no belief.

: : I made this world (universe we perseve)...just yesterday...to the finest detail
: : your memories and all.

: Ok, let's see you do it all again. Evidence - none.

: :  There are a few...of course there are many more...I would enjoy arguing these
: : out and I'll make up some more possiblities later.

: The point is you have to back up your claims with evidence and you're not doing that whereas we have evidence for an explanation to this entire universe where a god is not necessary. What belief would you think would help us survive in the cosmos?
: You do have a great imagination though, write some scifi books!

: Jehovah the god of Judaism was a nasty son of a bitch - genesis has been disproven many times over and the stories of the OT seem nothing more than good fiction or at best accounts of real people and their delusions.
: The unnamed God of the Christian religion is just a take off from Jehovah with a little more lovin' but still - creation of man was disproven by evolution and the heavens aren't where they said they were ETC...
: Ra the sun God of the Egyptians is probably one of the most rational as the Pagans saw the sun as necessary for their health and survival so thought it was a God - fit the times, explained the mysteries but no need for that myth anymore.
: Allah - just another take off of Jehovah.
: Apollo - clearly not real.
: And on and on and on....
: I've yet to encounter a God that can make sense in the world we live in today.

: Well, of course I think you're an idiot for not putting a little 'faith' in science but then again - that's my opinion. By faith I mean belief in this case - science as an effective tool towards understanding and interpreting reality has by far proven to be our best thus far. Do you have any complaints about it or are you just being consisitent in your 'belief in nothing' stance?<p><br>: As for the proof against any gods - here's a bit....<br>: It seems fairly obvious to me that the god in man's image that has been popular through the ages is just another anthropomorphic view of things - our imaginations at work.<p>Now come on Amanda!  You present no real proof in a scientific, logical or mathematical sense to your assertion, and I think a little reflection will help.  This issue can only be reduced to *probability*, not truth.  Besides, there is no "truth" in science- only likelihoods, and this is manifested nowhere else as it is in quantum theory.  At that level, it is all indeterminate.  That is why statistical analysis is of primary and fundamental importance in the mathematical sciences.  As I've stated before, the only universal truth that appears to be accessable to humanity are those that lie at the end of a correct line of mathematical reasoning.  It transcends language difficulties, cultural and personal bias, and is universally correct.  2+2=4 here and at Cygnus 4a.  There is no interpretation or open-endedness in a closed, airtight mathematical proof.  It is not possible to assign "truth" to a literary or poetic work; it is an interpretive endeavour, and I consider the Bible as such.  But science IS subject to verification through observable consequences, and various levels of truth can and ought to  be assigned to theories and thus is better situated to attain "truth" in physical settings<br>=== ======================<p>: Now that we have plausible theories to explain pretty much how things got started and led to today without needing a god<p>We have? How, and what are they?  Science can describe and predict, but it seems inadequate to the task of answering, "Why?".  Oh, well, we can DESCRIBE the evolution of living systems, but we/science cannot answer the question of, "Why is there life as opposed to none?" and the further question of, "Why is there anything as opposed to nothing at all?".  These questions, and the many others like them, are beyond the scope of science.  At this point then, we must use 'a priori' logical arguments to make the best plausible conclusions based absolutely on little or no evidence at all.

But I would challenge you to either explain or outline a path to same to address the questions that I'd posed.<br>"Why is there life, as opposed to none?"<br>"Why is there anything at all?"<br>And the additional questions of:<br>"If the universe is the answer, what is the question?", as Leon Lederman puts it.<br>"Why are there only two charges in the universe (+ and -), as opposed to one or three?"  For that matter, just what is a charge in an operational sense?<br>"Why the unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics in the sciences?"<br>"Why is life, as we define the concept, inherently biological?"  Why not mechanical, or even non-corporeal?<p>I do agree that history has demonstrated repeatedly that what one day is considered to be unexplainable, magical or unthinkable is thinned as time goes by.  And I do think that science is far reaching, but is not the endpoint of all knowledge.  Science will never be able to predict emotional, interpersonal, and creative thought.  Science will not explain how Beethoven would have finished his 9th Symphony, or Mozart his Requiem.   It just will not ultimately explain all, as Richard Dawkins would have it.  I am skeptical.

: : 
: : It looks like I didn't explain myself well here again. Forgive me - I'm not choosing my words carefully. 
: : I'm well aware that we can neither prove of disprove God's existence - what I meant, in my point of view, was that the evidence appears to sway towards the unlikeliness of His existence. I don't mean just scientific evidence and our present knowledge in it but also our present knowledge in the fields of history, prehistory, cultural anthropology, human psychology and that of comparative religion. 
: : I'm also aware that all truths, all facts are 'provisional' but when the truths are based on observation, facts, experimentation etc... as opposed to revelation, heresay and an inspired book - my beliefs are formed from the former type.
: : In my opinion, the supernatural is being swept out of the universe in the flood of new (and old) knowledge of what is natural. 

: 
: Well, generally agreed.  But I would challenge you to either explain or outline a path to same to address the questions that I'd posed.
: &quot;Why is there life, as opposed to none?&quot;
: &quot;Why is there anything at all?&quot;
: And the additional questions of:
: &quot;If the universe is the answer, what is the question?&quot;, as Leon Lederman puts it.
: &quot;Why are there only two charges in the universe (+ and -), as opposed to one or three?&quot;  For that matter, just what is a charge in an operational sense?
: &quot;Why the unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics in the sciences?&quot;
: &quot;Why is life, as we define the concept, inherently biological?&quot;  Why not mechanical, or even non-corporeal?

: I do agree that history has demonstrated repeatedly that what one day is considered to be unexplainable, magical or unthinkable is thinned as time goes by.  And I do think that science is far reaching, but is not the endpoint of all knowledge.  Science will never be able to predict emotional, interpersonal, and creative thought.  Science will not explain how Beethoven would have finished his 9th Symphony, or Mozart his Requiem.   It just will not ultimately explain all, as Richard Dawkins would have it.  I am skeptical.

:  : Why not? We are seeing the universe from this end of time. It could have easily been completely different. We only have an example of one right now, who knows, once we move out into the universe we may find out that things are not exactly as we perceive them.

: Yes, but isn't the issue about why this way and not one of the other possibilities?
: ============================

: 
: : The Universe doesn't exist for our benefit.

: I do not believe that I've ever made an argument for a human preferred place.
: =============================

: : : I do agree that history has demonstrated repeatedly that what one day is considered to be unexplainable, magical or unthinkable is thinned as time goes by.  And I do think that science is far reaching, but is not the endpoint of all knowledge.  Science will never be able to predict emotional, interpersonal, and creative thought.  Science will not explain how Beethoven would have finished his 9th Symphony, or Mozart his Requiem.   It just will not ultimately explain all, as Richard Dawkins would have it.  I am skeptical.

: : Eventually it may do just that once we learn how RNA is encoded.

: This will only address replication, not sentience.  Sentience is such a transcendent term, not to mention very unclear, that this research likely will not reveal any clues.
: ==============================

: : All creativity is is an effective neuro-net.

: Are you sure?  Neuro-nets are good for an electrochemical transmission of information but alas, pathways can be altered from any number of unpredictable events, perceptions and feelings.  So much so that I cannot concur...

: : In one of the few passages of the Bible that talks about Lucifer, it states that he once, "...walked among the stones of fire".  Are there any heavenly bodies that could be described in this way?  I believe stars are made of gas, aren't they?<p>: Yes, stars burn hydrogen initially.  The fusion then converts it into helium, then lithium, and so on through carbon and eventually into all of the naturally occuring elements that we observe.  Earth, and all that is on it (from the science point of view) are relics.  It all results from burned-out old stars.  Bodies that are "on fire" would include, in a broad definition, any planet that we know of.  All of the solar planets have very hot/molten cores and could, I suppose, be labeled a hot stone with a cool surface.<p>: Since I treat the Bible as non-literal, figurative writing, I may interpret "stones" to mean "matter" and then you could include stars, plasma, etc.<p>I don't bother trying to interpret any of the bible in a meaningful(?) way. I don't see any justification for doing so.<p>

: : That is exactly my point, thanks.  Science and rationalism will not answer this large question b/c we are reduced to just throwing up our arms and saying, &quot;Why not?&quot;.  We dance around in the semantic game, but there is no answer through evidence.  Philosophical and theological treatments are what's left.  I put my coins into the philosopher's hat first though.

: 
: One can't answer the unanswerable. To do so can only be opinion and conjecture set to help us handle reality. We are only fooling ourselves if we think that we could get the answer that easily.

: : No, I do not think so.  Think of the many things that I assume you give meaning to in your life; work, family, thought, etc.  In the cosmological sense, these things are pitifully insignificant.  Your objection appears to be a theological one, and I state nothing about either that, or a God's love for humanity. 

: 
: We try to give meaning to something that is far beyond our own limited standards and perceptions.

: : Tell me where that line is?  Are you defining it?  Is someone else?  Can you be sure it is a universal truth?   

: When does a baby go from acting merely on instinct to be a sentient being?

: : I'm not sure of your argument here, but I agree that we have &quot;programming&quot; from DNA to algorithmic thought processes- but that is where it ends.

: 
: Are YOU so sure of this yourself? Will one day the Internet become a sentient being when enough systems go online? Have you read &quot;The Moon is a Harsh Misteress&quot; by Robert A. Heinlein? It is mainly about a computer that attains sentience after it system has a certain about of processing power. Maybe we are the sum of our parts? BTW, I here that they are going to make a movie of this book soon.

: In one of the few passages of the Bible that talks about Lucifer, it states that he once, "...walked among the stones of fire".  Are there any heavenly bodies that could be described in this way?  I believe stars are made of gas, aren't they?<p>Yes, stars burn hydrogen initially.  The fusion then converts it into helium, then lithium, and so on through carbon and eventually into all of the naturally occuring elements that we observe.  Earth, and all that is on it (from the science point of view) are relics.  It all results from burned-out old stars.  Bodies that are "on fire" would include, in a broad definition, any planet that we know of.  All of the solar planets have very hot/molten cores and could, I suppose, be labeled a hot stone with a cool surface.<p>Since I treat the Bible as non-literal, figurative writing, I may interpret "stones" to mean "matter" and then you could include stars, plasma, etc.

<br>: I would be interested to hear how you all define the word god...?<p>When I refer to him - he is always a supernatural being. That's how it was defined in the beginning and that should be how it is defined today  - all of these new definitions like the idea that man is god confuses the idea and is another example of our manipulation of language. The way that will end is having us all running around blabbing in our language - not understanding a thing another is saying until we've returned to the caveman type grunt. Hey, maybe it is all a cyclical process - perhaps we've reached the arch and are now headed back from whence we came. I best go buy up some mountain property.

In one of the few passages of the Bible that talks about Lucifer, it states that he once, "...walked among the stones of fire".  Are there any heavenly bodies that could be described in this way?  I believe stars are made of gas, aren't they?

He does not try to start with a definition of God but attempts to prove that there must be an "unmoved mover", an "uncaused cause", a "necessary being", a "most being being", and a source for order in the universe. He then says that these qualities are what people believe a God to be. He then uses the qualities he has "proven" to exist to derive what God must be: there can only be one, must be unlimited, etc. His proofs are very interesting and I think most skeptics would be surprised at how logically a 13th century monk can think. The problem is that it the arguments are based on scholastic philosophy and might not make much sense unless you are familiar with the jargon.

He does not try to start with a definition of God but attempts to prove that there must be an &quot;unmoved mover&quot;, an &quot;uncaused cause&quot;, a &quot;necessary being&quot;, a &quot;most being being&quot;, and a source for order in the universe. He then says that these qualities are what people believe a God to be. He then uses the qualities he has &quot;proven&quot; to exist to derive what God must be: there can only be one, must be unlimited, etc. His proofs are very interesting and I think most skeptics would be surprised at how logically a 13th century monk can think. The problem is that it the arguments are based on scholastic philosophy and might not make much sense unless you are familiar with the jargon.

: : As well as it not being based on real hard evidence. He is still only using his opinion. A logical arguement is still not proof.

: Great thing is though - they're not even logical! Hoorah for us!!!!

For a doctrine which is to maintain itself not in clear light but only in the dark, will of necessity lose its effect on mankind, with incalculable harm to human progress. In their struggle for the ethical good, teachers of religion must have the stature to give up the doctrine of a personal God, that is, give up that source of fear and hope which in the past placed such vast power in the hands of priests. In their labors they will have to avail themselves of those forces which are capable of cultivating the Good, the True, and the Beautiful in humanity itself.

I do not believe in a personal God and I have never denied this but have expressed it clearly. If something is in me which can be called religious then it is the unbounded admiration for the structure of the world so far as our science can reveal it.<p>The latter quote is from "Albert Einstein: The Human Side", edited by Helen Dukas and Banesh Hoffman, and published by Princeton University Press. Also from the same book:<p><br>I do not believe in immortality of the individual, and I consider ethics to be an exclusively human concern with no superhuman authority behind it.<br>

For him neither the rule of human nor the rule of divine will exists as an independent cause of natural events. To be sure, the doctrine of a personal God interfering with natural events could never be refuted [italics his], in the real sense, by science, for this doctrine can always take refuge in those domains in which scientific knowledge has not yet been able to set foot.

: But I am convinced that such behavior on the part of representatives of religion would not only be unworthy but also fatal. For a doctrine which is to maintain itself not in clear light but only in the dark, will of necessity lose its effect on mankind, with incalculable harm to human progress. In their struggle for the ethical good, teachers of religion must have the stature to give up the doctrine of a personal God, that is, give up that source of fear and hope which in the past placed such vast power in the hands of priests. In their labors they will have to avail themselves of those forces which are capable of cultivating the Good, the True, and the Beautiful in humanity itself. This is, to be sure, a more difficult but an incomparably more worthy task...

: 
: Einstein has also said:

: It was, of course, a lie what you read about my religious convictions, a lie which is being systematically repeated. I do not believe in a personal God and I have never denied this but have expressed it clearly. If something is in me which can be called religious then it is the unbounded admiration for the structure of the world so far as our science can reveal it.

: The latter quote is from &quot;Albert Einstein: The Human Side&quot;, edited by Helen Dukas and Banesh Hoffman, and published by Princeton University Press. Also from the same book:

: 
: I do not believe in immortality of the individual, and I consider ethics to be an exclusively human concern with no superhuman authority behind it.

: I lived in Canada at the time too but I the Ontario &quot;OHIP&quot; did not cover it - I was 19 at the time and had dental benefits through my employment that covered 70% of the costs. After recovering from the effects of the gas I thought I was all better and lucky to have had minimal pain so off I went to the bar to join my friends - the next morning I awoke in severe pain looking like a chipmunk and for 2 months I was addicted to painkillers.

I'm trying to make a list here of the organs and instincts we possess that are remnants of our ancestors though no longer useful to a large degree - I've read that there are 180 odd such structures in the human body of which the appendix is one. Also, the idea that the pineal body located at the base of the brain once might have been a third eye is an interesting theory I'd like to know more about. As for instincts - the desires to crawl and cling to things which is seen in infants are supposedly examples of such as well as the instinct of fear that many of us posess. I agree that fear serves a useful purpose in the modern world to some degree but I think that perhaps we have too much of it. I can understand how it was certainly more useful in the primitive animals - in this area I'm interested in the idea that instinct was around before reason which is no doubt the case and that often our instinct will overcome our reasoning in the different examples of fear. Then there's the hypothesis that religious systems have made the most of the instinct of fear and that in order to obtain freedom from this ancient heritage we need to have our rational mind control our instinctive behaviours. Any info or opinions on this subject would be appreciated.

Zai jian.<p>Right, I took a few courses in evolutionary science and learned about our evolutionary lines and the various adaptations we've made from similar structures - but never did I learn anything on vestigial organs and instincts except the little blurb thrown in here and there. I think it's really interesting and I sometimes write scifi stories and thought there might be an idea here - like Stephen noted about people already being born without wisdom teeth - that's a great example when someone asks "well, is evolution happening now?" As far as I know lungs and ears have important functions - isn't it the lungs that absorb cigarette tar and the ears that absorb tongues and other foreign particles so we are more suited for our environment? I do think there's some part of the ear that is no longer of use though and I think it's named after Darwin if I remember correctly - I'm not sure if it is a relic from fish or not. Isn't there something about the thumb too?

As for instincts - the desires to crawl and cling to things which is seen in infants are supposedly examples of such as well as the instinct of fear that many of us posess. I agree that fear serves a useful purpose in the modern world to some degree but I think that perhaps we have too much of it. I can understand how it was certainly more useful in the primitive animals - in this area I'm interested in the idea that instinct was around before reason which is no doubt the case and that often our instinct will overcome our reasoning in the different examples of fear. Then there's the hypothesis that religious systems have made the most of the instinct of fear and that in order to obtain freedom from this ancient heritage we need to have our rational mind control our instinctive behaviours. Any info or opinions on this subject would be appreciated.

: :    I can think of the lungs (modified fish swim bladders) and the ears (modified  fish gills), for starters.  They're not specifically vestigial, but are certainly clear indicators of human evolution. 
: :    Our cravings for sugar and fat are remnants of a time when our ancestors were engaged in a daily life-and-death struggle to get as many calories into their bodies as they posibly could.  Though we now can get all the calories we need (and then some), our genes don't know that.
: :    I can give you more later.  Gotta go, now.  Great topic of discussion.  I'm sure plenty of folks will be happy to list more for you.  Zai jian.

: Right, I took a few courses in evolutionary science and learned about our evolutionary lines and the various adaptations we've made from similar structures - but never did I learn anything on vestigial organs and instincts except the little blurb thrown in here and there. I think it's really interesting and I sometimes write scifi stories and thought there might be an idea here - like Stephen noted about people already being born without wisdom teeth - that's a great example when someone asks &quot;well, is evolution happening now?&quot; As far as I know lungs and ears have important functions - isn't it the lungs that absorb cigarette tar and the ears that absorb tongues and other foreign particles so we are more suited for our environment? I do think there's some part of the ear that is no longer of use though and I think it's named after Darwin if I remember correctly - I'm not sure if it is a relic from fish or not. Isn't there something about the thumb too?

I've heard it has serious disputes with the US. I also know that in Canada, Jean Cretian is working hard to further the ties with China and I'm wondering what the big deal is about? Are there reasons why it has become so important and is being discussed more in the media?

It appears that China has been spending a bit of money in the US similar to what Japan did in the 80s but not with as much success. It doesn't seem like there is anything to be worried about here.

: : : Is there any truth to this idea that China has something up its sleeve? That it now has an impressive collection of high-tech weaponry that could compete with the US and that it has plans to increase it's power in the world by some secret technology or advancement. I've heard it has serious disputes with the US. I also know that in Canada, Jean Cretian is working hard to further the ties with China and I'm wondering what the big deal is about? Are there reasons why it has become so important and is being discussed more in the media? I know little about China save that it is a communist country with the largest population and will be taking back Hong Kong in July. Is there any validation why some seem to fear the possible future actions of this country?

: : The fear of China is that they have characteristics that we Americans find unappealing, poverty

: Compare the Chinese with South African Blacks. Why do you think the

: 1)Because they had the courage, determination and self-sacrificed.
: The South Africans resolved that they would suffer whatever 
: consequenses resulted from their revolution.

: &quot;might lead to being thrown in jail without a fair trial?&quot;

: Jail is a picnic compared to a &quot;neclacing&quot; (a South African punishment
: for political revolutionaries, consisting of having a gasoline filled
: tire tied to your neck and lit on fire)

: 2) Financial support, this includes the boycoting of South Africa, this
: happened because we appriciated the revolutions resolve.
: It was a long bloody battle for them but they prevailed

: You asked why do we do bussiness in China? Because we don't see a
: resolve that asks us to intervene.

: As for them being a &quot;Super Power&quot; make no mistake about it when their
: population overflows their capacity they will be a super power of the
: worst kind, a huge and desparate one! As far as weapons go, any 
: two-bit terrorist with the resolve to do it can wipe out millions
: of people through water contamination. Nuclear weapons are not required.

<br>Hi everyone,<p>No matter wether you are a believer or a skeptic I am sure you would like Whitley Schrieber's website. Seeing that the man is an "abductee" he does look at things from a very cautious viewpoint. The articles on this page are also a source of interest. A notable example would be the presence of a parculiar object following the comet Hale-Bopp on the edge of our solar-system. The last I have heard, The object is 3 times bigger than the Earth, it is hollow because it has no gravitational effects on the comet or any near by planets. It is also meant to be emmiting radio waves in a set pattern and it also radiates it's own light. Has anyone heard anything more than this? Will this be the close encounter we are waiting for, a hoax or a star?<p>Sarah.

What I mean by this is that many Christians, or any other religous persons for that matter, say that we have free will in that we chose to belief in their god or not, but when one doesn't chose to belief one is accused of being influenced by some evil enity "away" from their truth. IMO this negates the concept of free will. Can anyone else see this contradiction when they say we have free will and than say the we are being influnced as well?<br>

: : : : What I mean by this is that many Christians, or any other religous persons for that matter, say that we have free will in that we chose to belief in their god or not, but when one doesn't chose to belief one is accused of being influenced by some evil enity &quot;away&quot; from their truth. IMO this negates the concept of free will. Can anyone else see this contradiction when they say we have free will and than say the we are being influnced as well?

: : Yes, I see the contradiction. and I agree with you. I do have free will, and christians or other theist cannot change that by any means.
: : : 
: : : There may indeed be some people who are influenced by demons.  I prefer to think that those who commit the most despicable acts of torture and mutilation, especially on children, are acting outside of the boundaries of human will.
: : : I think I understand your point.  Many say how can we have free will if the exercise of such leads to punishment?

I.E.; Abraham and his son, Adam and Eve, etc...<p><br>Hello Stephen,<p>It is very difficult to debate with you since you're always changing the subject.  If the question is, "Is there a God?", and I answer it, you shift to "Well, your God is unjust", if I try to explain why I think He is just, the topic changes to, "there's no proof that God exists"...If I manage to make a good point, it's, "...That didn't originate with your God", and back and forth we go.  I was trying to give an answer to your specific point about free will from my own perspective.  Your understanding of the Bible is so misguided, I'm not sure where to begin.  As far as Abraham goes, he was greatly blessed by God.  Adam and Eve excercised their free will by believing the Devil instead of God, thereby handing the dominion they were given over the earth to Satan.  God didn't do it to them, they did it to themselves.  God also didn't need circumcision in order to identify his followers.  You would know this if you tried to understand my quote from Paul.  Circumcision was a sign and token of the covenant God made with Abraham, representing the rejection of fleshly living.  It was also pretty good for hygeine too.  Babies are routinely circumcised for totally non-religious reasons.

: : I never understood why they needed to be circumcised? An all-knowing god wouldn't need anything like this to identify his/her/its followers, they would already know.

: : : I believe the words Christian and faith could be substituted for Jew and circumcision.  So you see, God IS just.

: : 
: : From what I've read your god is not always just. In fact there are many examples of his/her/its being very petty with the lives of their so-called faithful. I.E.; Abraham and his son, Adam and Eve, etc...

: 
: Hello Stephen,

: It is very difficult to debate with you since you're always changing the subject.  If the question is, &quot;Is there a God?&quot;, and I answer it, you shift to &quot;Well, your God is unjust&quot;, if I try to explain why I think He is just, the topic changes to, &quot;there's no proof that God exists&quot;...If I manage to make a good point, it's, &quot;...That didn't originate with your God&quot;, and back and forth we go.  I was trying to give an answer to your specific point about free will from my own perspective.  Your understanding of the Bible is so misguided, I'm not sure where to begin.  As far as Abraham goes, he was greatly blessed by God.  Adam and Eve excercised their free will by believing the Devil instead of God, thereby handing the dominion they were given over the earth to Satan.  God didn't do it to them, they did it to themselves.  God also didn't need circumcision in order to identify his followers.  You would know this if you tried to understand my quote from Paul.  Circumcision was a sign and token of the covenant God made with Abraham, representing the rejection of fleshly living.  It was also pretty good for hygeine too.  Babies are routinely circumcised for totally non-religious reasons.

: What I mean by this is that many Christians, or any other religous persons for that matter, say that we have free will in that we chose to belief in their god or not, but when one doesn't chose to belief one is accused of being influenced by some evil enity "away" from their truth. IMO this negates the concept of free will. Can anyone else see this contradiction when they say we have free will and than say the we are being influnced as well?<p>Just because somebody is being influenced doesn't mean that they have not got free will.  Look at elections, most people would say you have the choice to vote for who you want.  The fact that you decide to vote one way doesn't mean that you haven't got free will.  Similarly in religious eyes you can vote for God or the devil.  If you are seduced by the offerings of the devil it doesn't mean that you didn't have free will in the first place.

I agree that atheists handing out hate material due to anit-religious beliefs is wrong but I don't think that all anti-religious material can be considered wrong. I consider myself not only a non-religious type but also an anit-religious type because I believe it does a lot of harm to soceity and humankind. I disagree with Sagan's comment that he made once concerning his opinion that we should just leave religion alone and if we can't be kind then be silent. I believe there is a middle groud that could do a lot of good and examples of such are the writings of Bertrand Russell and William Fielding - even Nietzsche to an extent. I do try not to attack people personally but I do attack religion and I try to do this in an intelligent manner with as much respect and kindness that is appropriate. Humanism has many aspects - my feeling is that everyone would be better off without religion. If you can show me where I might be wrong - please do.<p>: : : : <br>: : : : I would be interested to know why you, and others here, feel that religion is dangerous to you.  The truth seems to be that it's the Christian religion that most of you are bothered by.  Amanda stated that she had more respect for the ancient Pagan religions of the time as opposed to the God of the ancient Israelites.  I found this interesting, since many of these religions commonly practiced human sacrifice and other abominations.  She cited the superiority of the  Greek civilization even though they worshipped a myriad of gods and were constantly at war.  And even though she was arguing about how Christianity has been unfair to women, she didn't seem to have much of a problem with the Muslim religion which is notorious for it's less than humane treatment of women.  (Sorry, Amanda, I don't mean to pick on you) The fact that Christianity seems to be the only politically INcorrect religion only tends to strengthen my belief that it is the right one.<p>: : : That's all right Lynn, feel free to pick on me but please try not to put words in my mouth.<br>: : : Regarding Paganism - I have many problems with it as well but because many great Greek minds were able to prosper along side it - I have less problem with that aspect of the suppression of science. There are several examples of scientific discoveries made by Greek men and women that we didn't see again until the early Renaissance period and that was due to its suppression by christianity and thankfully because the Arabs kept it going and handed it back to Europe. I don't think we EVER discussed Islam - but Imost certainly do have problems with it but again the idea that the Arabs saved some ancient science from being lost to oblivion makes me like them a bit better. Mohammed was less respectable than Jesus from what I've read and I'm well aware of the harms that Islam has done and certainly continues to do moreso than Christianity. The reason I didn't mention Islam was because you never brought it up and I was simply giving my opinions on your postings - that's also why I only mentioned Paganism briefly.  I'm not sure where you get the idea that Christianity is considered politically incorrect from what has been discussed here. I'm not a politically correct person myself so I certainly wouldn't attack something for being politically incorrect - that's all a bunch of nonsense to fit the 90s - you should check out the last issue of Skeptic on that topic. Anyway, if you don't mind me saying so, you don't appear to be a skeptic on this particular issue - your beliefs seem to be based on faith and faith alone. I can respect that if it doesn't interfere with the facts but when you claim that evolution or the cosmos are a product of a Creator than you've got to give evidence to back those claims up. If you solely claim that God is within you personally and has nothing to do with the outside world then great, much happiness for you. Happy New Year! <p>: : <br>: : You're right.  I'm about as skeptical of Christianity as you are of evolution.  I just enjoy the debate, although we do seem to be at an impass.  I'm sorry if I misinterpreted you.  I was commenting that those times were barbaric, and you sited the Greeks as an example of that not being true.  I was merely pointing out that Greeks were not perfect either.  You also stated something to the effect that Paganism was preferable to Judaism, and I was trying to make the point that if you condemn the OT because you see it as cruel, you cannot possibly feel otherwise about the abominable pagan religions of that time.<br>: :  <p>: Yes, I believe we are at an impass and I think it would be best to call it quits as this "nice, intelligent" debate is becoming a "nasty, emotional" one. I think it would be good for you though to study evolution a bit. That we actually evolved like all other animals and plants and that we are related to many of them is a fact. It is the mechanisms of evolution that can be debated - Darwin's mechanism of natural selection or decent by modification is the leader in how to explain evolution - it has withstood a century of scrutiny and has accumulated much evidence to support it. I believe in it but in no way am I certain about it - if evidence was found to support another mechanism then I would have to give it adequate consideration. Evolution however is not under the same "skeptic rules" - anyone that doesn't accept evolution IS not informed. If you're trying to get closer to reality Lynn, you've got to accept evolution as a fact if there ever was one and I'm not saying this because that's what I want you to do but if you ever claim that there is no truth to evolution to anyone with intelligence - you are going to be ridiculed. Any intelligent theists (of which there are a lot of) will agree with me on this. When the Pope made his declaration that the theory of evolution could not longer be seen as just a hypothesis he was referring to Darwin's mechanism - although it took him far too long to make this claim - it did make a lot of us happy. Only the fundamentalists still deny it - claiming that Genesis is the literal truth and I don't think you're a fundamentalist. If you are - I don't know why the hell you're here. <p><br>I really didn't realize that I had become nasty and emotional with you.

I disagree with Sagan's comment that he made once concerning his opinion that we should just leave religion alone and if we can't be kind then be silent. I believe there is a middle groud that could do a lot of good and examples of such are the writings of Bertrand Russell and William Fielding - even Nietzsche to an extent. I do try not to attack people personally but I do attack religion and I try to do this in an intelligent manner with as much respect and kindness that is appropriate.

The truth seems to be that it's the Christian religion that most of you are bothered by.  Amanda stated that she had more respect for the ancient Pagan religions of the time as opposed to the God of the ancient Israelites.  I found this interesting, since many of these religions commonly practiced human sacrifice and other abominations.  She cited the superiority of the  Greek civilization even though they worshipped a myriad of gods and were constantly at war.  And even though she was arguing about how Christianity has been unfair to women, she didn't seem to have much of a problem with the Muslim religion which is notorious for it's less than humane treatment of women.  (Sorry, Amanda, I don't mean to pick on you) The fact that Christianity seems to be the only politically INcorrect religion only tends to strengthen my belief that it is the right one.<p>: : That's all right Lynn, feel free to pick on me but please try not to put words in my mouth.<br>: : Regarding Paganism - I have many problems with it as well but because many great Greek minds were able to prosper along side it - I have less problem with that aspect of the suppression of science. There are several examples of scientific discoveries made by Greek men and women that we didn't see again until the early Renaissance period and that was due to its suppression by christianity and thankfully because the Arabs kept it going and handed it back to Europe. I don't think we EVER discussed Islam - but Imost certainly do have problems with it but again the idea that the Arabs saved some ancient science from being lost to oblivion makes me like them a bit better. Mohammed was less respectable than Jesus from what I've read and I'm well aware of the harms that Islam has done and certainly continues to do moreso than Christianity. The reason I didn't mention Islam was because you never brought it up and I was simply giving my opinions on your postings - that's also why I only mentioned Paganism briefly.  I'm not sure where you get the idea that Christianity is considered politically incorrect from what has been discussed here. I'm not a politically correct person myself so I certainly wouldn't attack something for being politically incorrect - that's all a bunch of nonsense to fit the 90s - you should check out the last issue of Skeptic on that topic. Anyway, if you don't mind me saying so, you don't appear to be a skeptic on this particular issue - your beliefs seem to be based on faith and faith alone. I can respect that if it doesn't interfere with the facts but when you claim that evolution or the cosmos are a product of a Creator than you've got to give evidence to back those claims up. If you solely claim that God is within you personally and has nothing to do with the outside world then great, much happiness for you. Happy New Year! <p>: <br>: You're right.  I'm about as skeptical of Christianity as you are of evolution.  I just enjoy the debate, although we do seem to be at an impass.  I'm sorry if I misinterpreted you.  I was commenting that those times were barbaric, and you sited the Greeks as an example of that not being true.  I was merely pointing out that Greeks were not perfect either.  You also stated something to the effect that Paganism was preferable to Judaism, and I was trying to make the point that if you condemn the OT because you see it as cruel, you cannot possibly feel otherwise about the abominable pagan religions of that time.<br>:  <p>Yes, I believe we are at an impass and I think it would be best to call it quits as this "nice, intelligent" debate is becoming a "nasty, emotional" one. I think it would be good for you though to study evolution a bit. That we actually evolved like all other animals and plants and that we are related to many of them is a fact. It is the mechanisms of evolution that can be debated - Darwin's mechanism of natural selection or decent by modification is the leader in how to explain evolution - it has withstood a century of scrutiny and has accumulated much evidence to support it. I believe in it but in no way am I certain about it - if evidence was found to support another mechanism then I would have to give it adequate consideration. Evolution however is not under the same "skeptic rules" - anyone that doesn't accept evolution IS not informed. If you're trying to get closer to reality Lynn, you've got to accept evolution as a fact if there ever was one and I'm not saying this because that's what I want you to do but if you ever claim that there is no truth to evolution to anyone with intelligence - you are going to be ridiculed. Any intelligent theists (of which there are a lot of) will agree with me on this. When the Pope made his declaration that the theory of evolution could not longer be seen as just a hypothesis he was referring to Darwin's mechanism - although it took him far too long to make this claim - it did make a lot of us happy. Only the fundamentalists still deny it - claiming that Genesis is the literal truth and I don't think you're a fundamentalist. If you are - I don't know why the hell you're here.

I apologize Lynn, I didn't mean to imply that you were not welcome here. We're all equally welcome here. It's just very difficult for me to have a debate when the facts aren't recognized. I'm not saying that all I've ever written is factual - I'm well aware it's not. But, evolution is a fact and I see no point in debating that it's not. When I stated that last bit about being a fundamentalist what I meant was that fundamentalists are not skeptical of any of their beliefs - they don't listen to the other side and have no plans to change. I never thought you were one because you have obviously been listening to the other side. I shouldn't have said what I did - I suppose it was a very bad way of asking why you are here. Is there a possibility that you might question your beliefs - if so, I'd be happy to debate the issue with you and explain the evidence I use in forming my beliefs and of course this works both ways - I'm open to question my beliefs and will enjoy reading the evidence in favor of yours - if it adds up to something substantial, I'd be more that happy to change my beliefs on God. I haven't mastered this debate thing yet - and have been unable to keep my emotions out of the picture - this is a part of me that needs to be worked on. How about we start again and I'll try harder to reach that goal - again, I apologize for the personal attacks. I too see the benefits of having you here - and never was it my intention to gang up on you or anything like that - I think the comparison with Hitler set off a little bomb inside me, it's always been difficult for me to deal with such misunderstandings. I also try to be as open minded as is possible in this case. I read somewhere that the difference between being religious and not being may have something to do with psychology - there may be something in you that allows you to believe and something in me that just can't imagine it. I don't know how true this is but it's something to consider. Anyway, please don't hesitate to write to me further - I will change my ways and respect your stand.

: : I apologize Lynn, I didn't mean to imply that you were not welcome here. We're all equally welcome here. It's just very difficult for me to have a debate when the facts aren't recognized. I'm not saying that all I've ever written is factual - I'm well aware it's not. But, evolution is a fact and I see no point in debating that it's not. When I stated that last bit about being a fundamentalist what I meant was that fundamentalists are not skeptical of any of their beliefs - they don't listen to the other side and have no plans to change. I never thought you were one because you have obviously been listening to the other side. I shouldn't have said what I did - I suppose it was a very bad way of asking why you are here.

I agree that atheists handing out hate material due to anit-religious beliefs is wrong but I don't think that all anti-religious material can be considered wrong. I consider myself not only a non-religious type but also an anit-religious type because I believe it does a lot of harm to soceity and humankind. I disagree with Sagan's comment that he made once concerning his opinion that we should just leave religion alone and if we can't be kind then be silent. I believe there is a middle groud that could do a lot of good and examples of such are the writings of Bertrand Russell and William Fielding - even Nietzsche to an extent. I do try not to attack people personally but I do attack religion and I try to do this in an intelligent manner with as much respect and kindness that is appropriate. Humanism has many aspects - my feeling is that everyone would be better off without religion. If you can show me where I might be wrong - please do.<p>: : <br>: : I would be interested to know why you, and others here, feel that religion is dangerous to you.  The truth seems to be that it's the Christian religion that most of you are bothered by.  Amanda stated that she had more respect for the ancient Pagan religions of the time as opposed to the God of the ancient Israelites.  I found this interesting, since many of these religions commonly practiced human sacrifice and other abominations.  She cited the superiority of the  Greek civilization even though they worshipped a myriad of gods and were constantly at war.  And even though she was arguing about how Christianity has been unfair to women, she didn't seem to have much of a problem with the Muslim religion which is notorious for it's less than humane treatment of women.  (Sorry, Amanda, I don't mean to pick on you) The fact that Christianity seems to be the only politically INcorrect religion only tends to strengthen my belief that it is the right one.<p>: That's all right Lynn, feel free to pick on me but please try not to put words in my mouth.<br>: Regarding Paganism - I have many problems with it as well but because many great Greek minds were able to prosper along side it - I have less problem with that aspect of the suppression of science. There are several examples of scientific discoveries made by Greek men and women that we didn't see again until the early Renaissance period and that was due to its suppression by christianity and thankfully because the Arabs kept it going and handed it back to Europe. I don't think we EVER discussed Islam - but Imost certainly do have problems with it but again the idea that the Arabs saved some ancient science from being lost to oblivion makes me like them a bit better. Mohammed was less respectable than Jesus from what I've read and I'm well aware of the harms that Islam has done and certainly continues to do moreso than Christianity. The reason I didn't mention Islam was because you never brought it up and I was simply giving my opinions on your postings - that's also why I only mentioned Paganism briefly.  I'm not sure where you get the idea that Christianity is considered politically incorrect from what has been discussed here. I'm not a politically correct person myself so I certainly wouldn't attack something for being politically incorrect - that's all a bunch of nonsense to fit the 90s - you should check out the last issue of Skeptic on that topic. Anyway, if you don't mind me saying so, you don't appear to be a skeptic on this particular issue - your beliefs seem to be based on faith and faith alone. I can respect that if it doesn't interfere with the facts but when you claim that evolution or the cosmos are a product of a Creator than you've got to give evidence to back those claims up. If you solely claim that God is within you personally and has nothing to do with the outside world then great, much happiness for you. Happy New Year! <p><br>You're right.  I'm about as skeptical of Christianity as you are of evolution.  I just enjoy the debate, although we do seem to be at an impass.  I'm sorry if I misinterpreted you.  I was commenting that those times were barbaric, and you sited the Greeks as an example of that not being true.  I was merely pointing out that Greeks were not perfect either.  You also stated something to the effect that Paganism was preferable to Judaism, and I was trying to make the point that if you condemn the OT because you see it as cruel, you cannot possibly feel otherwise about the abominable pagan religions of that time.<br> <br>

I'm not sure where you get the idea that Christianity is considered politically incorrect from what has been discussed here. I'm not a politically correct person myself so I certainly wouldn't attack something for being politically incorrect - that's all a bunch of nonsense to fit the 90s - you should check out the last issue of Skeptic on that topic. Anyway, if you don't mind me saying so, you don't appear to be a skeptic on this particular issue - your beliefs seem to be based on faith and faith alone. I can respect that if it doesn't interfere with the facts but when you claim that evolution or the cosmos are a product of a Creator than you've got to give evidence to back those claims up. If you solely claim that God is within you personally and has nothing to do with the outside world then great, much happiness for you. Happy New Year!

And even though she was arguing about how Christianity has been unfair to women, she didn't seem to have much of a problem with the Muslim religion which is notorious for it's less than humane treatment of women.  (Sorry, Amanda, I don't mean to pick on you) The fact that Christianity seems to be the only politically INcorrect religion only tends to strengthen my belief that it is the right one.

Just realized I made an error in that last posting by attributing paganism to the Greeks - forgive me. I realize they took a lot from the Egyptian religion but called in Hellinism instead. So, I suppose I should point out that the Egyptians respected their women somewhat. I think the reason I have less of a problem with paganism though is because it's all but died out. I no doubt focus more on Christianity because I'm more familiar with it and it is the leading religion in the country I live in and because I can see first hand what it does. I agree there's little reason to focus on the past horrors of religions but some still exist today. I don't think that Christianity is harming me personally - I feel it's harming humanity in general. This whole issue is not really a "personal" one for me - though I'm aware my opinions are my own. I try to focus on the harms that can be seen today - in North America mostly but also in other parts of the world. My biggest complaint is the effect it has on science and progress. <p><p>:<p><p><p><p><p><br> <br>

HATE never came into my mind. Being against something does not necessarily mean hatred of that something. I realize that a lot of scientists are Christians or what have you BUT science itself is NOT - if anything it is athiestic. Not once - have I attacked a Christian persay - I am attacking Christianity - there IS a difference. Now THINK about this - Christianity has all the answers to life, the world, the Universe - there are no mysteries to solve for a true Christian, there are no discoveries about the Universe to be made - they were made 2000 years ago and are to be found in a book. There is NO thinking left to be done as to why the world is the way it is etc... and so that is WHY it halts progree, that is WHY it supresses science. Science from day one has been in conflict with religion - it continually pushes the Christian doctrines farther and farther out in the Universe. The truths of the bible have already - LONG AGO - been found to be false. These are FACTS Lynn - you can't dispute ANY of it. Yes, there are a handful of scientists that use science to confirm Genesis and other Judoe-Christian maxims and they have been shot down from the beginning. The majority of scientists are disbelievers - fact. On to your next comment where you AGAIN twisted my words - I did not say Christians were a danger to soceity - I stated that Christianity is harmful to soceity. Comparing me with Hitler is absolutely ridiculous and might I refer you to his book "Mein Kampf" where it can be found that HE was indeed a Christian. It was the Christians that backed anti-Semitism from the very beginning - another FACT. I've been studying Christianity for years Lynn, I've got mountains of evidence to support my claims and will happily provide you with such. You are completely narrow minded on this subject and totally ignorant of the facts - I gave up disputing this shit with individual people long ago because most of those people were like you - it's enough to drive a person insane. If you want to discuss this intelligently then you must NOT manipulate my words and you MUST have an open-mind to the evidence that is there and you MUST accept the facts. I know this is rather insulting but Lynn, you can't insinuate that I am filled with hatred and am comparable with Hitler and expect me to treat you with the same respect as I once did. <p>

In Reply to: <a href="661.html">Carl Sagan</a> posted by Amanda on December 30, 1996 at 18:30:38:<p>
: When I subscribed to "Skeptic" magazine over the holidays - the woman who took the call mentioned that they were working on a tribute issue on Carl Sagan much like their first issue on Asimov. It will no doubt be a beauty so I thought I'd share the info. He was a great man and I was looking at other great minds that have died such as Asimov and Russell and a host of others and I'm wondering if anyone has any examples of ones that are alive today - fighting to get science out to the people and perhaps minimizing the effects of religion and mysticism in the process? One I can think of is Stephen J. Gould. <p>When I learned that Carl Sagan died, I felt saddened by it. I consider him a role<br>model. I admire him not only because of his views on science and reason, but also<br>his concern and activity for the community, environment, tolerance of differences,<br>and other humanistic principles.<p>Another person I am impressed by is right here in the Skeptic Society. It's Dr.<br>Michael Shermer (if you're reading Mike, I hope you don't mind a little bit of<br>flattery ;) ). I'm generally quite impressed by his writings and I consider him<br>a good role model as well. I like the fact that he stood up to Holocaust <br>Revisionist bigots (I wouldn't be surprised if he got a few death threats). In<br>another case, when he was debating Duane Gish, he stood up to an atheist handing<br>out obnoxious anti-religious hate literature. It's not good enough to champion<br>reason and skepticism only. Tolerance and concern for the community should be<br>championed as well.<br>- Jason<br>

: : When I subscribed to &quot;Skeptic&quot; magazine over the holidays - the woman who took the call mentioned that they were working on a tribute issue on Carl Sagan much like their first issue on Asimov. It will no doubt be a beauty so I thought I'd share the info. He was a great man and I was looking at other great minds that have died such as Asimov and Russell and a host of others and I'm wondering if anyone has any examples of ones that are alive today - fighting to get science out to the people and perhaps minimizing the effects of religion and mysticism in the process? One I can think of is Stephen J. Gould. 

: When I learned that Carl Sagan died, I felt saddened by it. I consider him a role
: model. I admire him not only because of his views on science and reason, but also
: his concern and activity for the community, environment, tolerance of differences,
: and other humanistic principles.

: Another person I am impressed by is right here in the Skeptic Society. It's Dr.
: Michael Shermer (if you're reading Mike, I hope you don't mind a little bit of
: flattery ;) ). I'm generally quite impressed by his writings and I consider him
: a good role model as well. I like the fact that he stood up to Holocaust 
: Revisionist bigots (I wouldn't be surprised if he got a few death threats). In
: another case, when he was debating Duane Gish, he stood up to an atheist handing
: out obnoxious anti-religious hate literature. It's not good enough to champion
: reason and skepticism only. Tolerance and concern for the community should be
: championed as well.

: Just a comment on that last bit. I agree that atheists handing out hate material due to anit-religious beliefs is wrong but I don't think that all anti-religious material can be considered wrong. I consider myself not only a non-religious type but also an anit-religious type because I believe it does a lot of harm to soceity and humankind.

I believe there is a middle groud that could do a lot of good and examples of such are the writings of Bertrand Russell and William Fielding - even Nietzsche to an extent. I do try not to attack people personally but I do attack religion and I try to do this in an intelligent manner with as much respect and kindness that is appropriate.

Religions, ingenral, have been a cause to many attocities.  I think it is important for us to understand why this happens.  It is real easy to say that it is because they were irrational, or not using free thought.  This is true and the answer is more complacated than that.  Stail bad bad, buit to say that it was just him it to miss the point.  Stalin was not just a product of his time but a product of the instatutions that brought him to power, that is he had the power and most everyone else listened.  The same thing happens in a lot of institutionalised religions.  There are those that interpate god, and everyone else then believes.  Those people who are doing the interpeting get their agendas met, of course.  It seems that power is the corupting factor, and many religions cater to human's pre-disposition to dominate hierarchies.  When this happens, catastraphy! <p>-Jeff<br>

: : : I probably touched on a major point of contension in the humanist/freethought
: : : movement. That is, to what extent should we be pro-human vs. anti-religious? I
: : : agree that religion certainly has its fair share of dogmatism and harm. We see
: : : things like cults, pseudoscience, hatred, war, healing frauds, etc... But there
: : : are many secular forms of harm, credulity, and dogmatism as well. An example 
: : : would be Stalinism. Stalinism is a secular system but it was responsible for a
: : : host of atrocities, persecution, and even pseudoscience (Stalin supported the
: : : Lysenkoism fiasco).

: 
: : More wars and killings have been done in the name of one god or another than because of anything else.

: : Stalin was a product of his time and he was a socio-pathic monster who would use anything to his advantage.

: I Agree.  Religions, ingenral, have been a cause to many attocities.  I think it is important for us to understand why this happens.  It is real easy to say that it is because they were irrational, or not using free thought.  This is true and the answer is more complacated than that.  Stail bad bad, buit to say that it was just him it to miss the point.  Stalin was not just a product of his time but a product of the instatutions that brought him to power, that is he had the power and most everyone else listened.  The same thing happens in a lot of institutionalised religions.  There are those that interpate god, and everyone else then believes.  Those people who are doing the interpeting get their agendas met, of course.  It seems that power is the corupting factor, and many religions cater to human's pre-disposition to dominate hierarchies.  When this happens, catastraphy!

Jason,<p>Could you do me a favor and check out the debate below that Lynn and I have been having under the same heading and give me your honest opinion. I'm afraid I'm losing my cool and it would be best for me to shut off my fingers. I'm also looking for an objective, unbias opinion - I claim to be a skeptic on most issues though there are some that I take as fact or truths though I do understand the logic behind both fact and truth and so the best there can be is provisional in both cases. I'm aware I have personal views that usually come out but it's a bit difficult for me to take an honest, outside look at them. If you have a minute, take a look, give me some hard criticism - I'd appreciate it. <p><br>

I also agree with the idea that some religious people have been inspired to use science to confirm a creator though I know none who have reached that result. I suppose what I meant by stating most scientists are disbelievers was more that scientists must attempt to keep their religious beliefs out of science when doing their research. I am still very convinced that supernaturalism with theism as its handmaiden is harmful to humanity but I don't take the stand that we should work to destroy it or suppress it - I claim that we should look at the evidence - research both the good and the bad of Christianity in this case - discard the bad and if what is left can constitute the original definition of Christianity then it shll survive naturally but I do claim that what will be left will not adhere to the baseic tenents of this religion (ie God, immortality and Christ) so we should call what is left by a different name. One area that is terrifically misunderstood is morals and ethics and we must accept the evidence that it is natural for humanity to be moral animals - inherited down from our ancestors - without the belief in God to steer us in the direction of morality.<br>

I'm afraid I'm losing my cool and it would be best for me to shut off my fingers. I'm also looking for an objective, unbias opinion - I claim to be a skeptic on most issues though there are some that I take as fact or truths though I do understand the logic behind both fact and truth and so the best there can be is provisional in both cases. I'm aware I have personal views that usually come out but it's a bit difficult for me to take an honest, outside look at them. If you have a minute, take a look, give me some hard criticism - I'd appreciate it. 

: : I'd be happy to comment on your debate with Lynn. In fact, I'm honoured that you
: : asked me specifically for my input. Of course, I'm not immune to bias either. 
: : Remember, I'm a godless infidel too! ;) I noticed that your response branched off
: : into two parts. I'll comment on them separately.

: : I'll first comment on the branch you began at 03:01:09. For the most part, I agree
: : with you. Lynn makes some conclusions based on a misunderstanding of your arguments.
: : I don't have much background knowledge of pagan religion history so I won't comment
: : on that. In this branch, I don't think you were &quot;nasty or emotional.&quot; Although, I'm
: : curious what you meant when you said, &quot;If you are - I don't know why the hell you're
: : here?&quot; I'm sure Lynn is here to debate intellectual differences. To me, she comes
: : across as a pretty conservative Christian, and although I don't find her arguments
: : convincing, I respect her tenacity to debate in a forum with tough minded skeptics.

: : Now the branch at 04:30:12. Well....  maybe you were a little harsh on Lynn in your 
: : last reply. Also, keep in mind that in Internet etiquette, USING CAPS IS SHOUTING!
: : I don't think she was insinuating that you were filled with hatred towards Christians.
: : I think she was just concerned that a view like &quot;Christianity is harmful to society&quot; 
: : may encourage some people to persecute them.

: : I agree with you on several points in this branch and again Lynn misinterpreted some 
: : of your arguments. However, I disagree on a few things. First (I know you disagree on
: : this), but I don't think we should make a blanket condemnation of Christianity as 
: : being harmful to society. Indeed, like I mentioned in my last post, Christianity is
: : harmful in some ways and is actually beneficial in other ways. There are many bigoted 
: : and credulous  Christians out there, but there are many enlightened and tolerant 
: : Christians out there too. For example, during the US Civil War, the Southern Baptists 
: : endorsed slavery while the Quakers were totally opposed to it.

: : In regards to science, I have a few comments. I'm not sure if most scientists are 
: : nonbelievers or not. This would be difficult to determine. We would have to take a
: : very large international poll. Even if most scientists were nonbelievers, appealing
: : to authority isn't a good argument. Also, perhaps it's more accurate to say that
: : science is nontheistic rather than atheistic. The scientific method can neither
: : verify or falsify things like a god or spiritual realm. Finally, you said that the
: : belief that Christianity has all the answers can stagnate scientific progress. Well,
: : this is true in many respects. But this is not always the case. Indeed, some religious
: : people are motivated to study science because they see it as a way to understand their
: : god's creation. Two notable examples are Isaac Newton, and yes, Charles Darwin
: : (although, Darwin became an agnostic later on in his life). A good scientist who is
: : religious knows where to draw the line when it comes to their faith and the scientific
: : method. I believe Newton said something like, &quot;the Bible tells us how to get to 
: : heaven, not how the heavens work.&quot;

: : Well, that's all I can think of for now. Hope this helps!
: : - Jason

: Thanks Jason, yes it did help - being able to see it from another person's viewpoint is certainly helpful.
: I especially agree with the comments you made on Lynn's point of view - I now can see that. I also agree with the idea that some religious people have been inspired to use science to confirm a creator though I know none who have reached that result. I suppose what I meant by stating most scientists are disbelievers was more that scientists must attempt to keep their religious beliefs out of science when doing their research. I am still very convinced that supernaturalism with theism as its handmaiden is harmful to humanity but I don't take the stand that we should work to destroy it or suppress it - I claim that we should look at the evidence - research both the good and the bad of Christianity in this case - discard the bad and if what is left can constitute the original definition of Christianity then it shll survive naturally but I do claim that what will be left will not adhere to the baseic tenents of this religion (ie God, immortality and Christ) so we should call what is left by a different name. One area that is terrifically misunderstood is morals and ethics and we must accept the evidence that it is natural for humanity to be moral animals - inherited down from our ancestors - without the belief in God to steer us in the direction of morality.

<br>: : Just a comment on that last bit. I agree that atheists handing out hate material due to anit-religious beliefs is wrong but I don't think that all anti-religious material can be considered wrong. I consider myself not only a non-religious type but also an anit-religious type because I believe it does a lot of harm to soceity and humankind. I disagree with Sagan's comment that he made once concerning his opinion that we should just leave religion alone and if we can't be kind then be silent. I believe there is a middle groud that could do a lot of good and examples of such are the writings of Bertrand Russell and William Fielding - even Nietzsche to an extent. I do try not to attack people personally but I do attack religion and I try to do this in an intelligent manner with as much respect and kindness that is appropriate. Humanism has many aspects - my feeling is that everyone would be better off without religion. If you can show me where I might be wrong - please do.<p>: I probably touched on a major point of contension in the humanist/freethought<br>: movement. That is, to what extent should we be pro-human vs. anti-religious? I<br>: agree that religion certainly has its fair share of dogmatism and harm. We see<br>: things like cults, pseudoscience, hatred, war, healing frauds, etc... But there<br>: are many secular forms of harm, credulity, and dogmatism as well. An example <br>: would be Stalinism. Stalinism is a secular system but it was responsible for a<br>: host of atrocities, persecution, and even pseudoscience (Stalin supported the<br>: Lysenkoism fiasco).<p>I agree, there are other forms of harm but Stalinism didn't become as strong as religion did and certainly hasn't lasted as long.<p>: In the case of religion, although there are many Christians endorsing things<br>: like the Christian Coalition and young-earth creationism, there are many<br>: enlightened Christians who are more than happy to stand with us against them.<br>: Religion can certainly be harmful but it can be beneficial as well. Many<br>: religious people, including some friends of mine, are actively volunteering<br>: for the community. Many churches are involved in social justice causes (for<br>: example, things like human rights, environment, 3rd world aid, social security,<br>: and even things like fighting creationism, fighting the religious right,<br>: and supporting abortion rights). Overall, I think the enemy is not religion, <br>: but dogmatism. And we should oppose dogmatism in whatever form it may have, <br>: whether religious or secular.<p>The problem I have with this is the manipulation of definitions that has gone on over the centuries. Religion in the beginning was defined as belief in the supernatural and a Christian was defined as one who believed in the supernatural and who also believed in the bible literally and thought Jesus was the son of God. I'm well aware that religion and christianity now takes on many definitions but would it not be a lot less confusing if new words were used. I understand there are many non-theist groups that call their beliefs religious and now the popular definition is anything one might deem important or fundamental. I suppose when I attack religion and christianity I refer to the original definitions but it does bother me that the english language has been put through such manipulation to the point where people have no fucking clue as to what one means when the claim to be something or other. <p>: I'm not sure if you live in the USA, but perhaps there is more anti-religious<br>: sentiment because fundamentalism is widespread there.

I suppose I may be letting my present environment exagerate my feelings - I am presently living in one of the two worst states for such one-sided, extreme right wing, religious fundamental crap. I do admit most of the harms were done in the past and no longer are relevant but I still see many in the present day - well-hidden and ones that take a lot of thought to understand and because they have been a part of us since the very moment we came into this world, it's even that much more difficult to break away and see them from the outside.

Posted by <a href="mailto:kakadoo@sprynet.com">Amanda</a> on December 30, 1996 at 18:30:38:<p>
When I subscribed to "Skeptic" magazine over the holidays - the woman who took the call mentioned that they were working on a tribute issue on Carl Sagan much like their first issue on Asimov. It will no doubt be a beauty so I thought I'd share the info. He was a great man and I was looking at other great minds that have died such as Asimov and Russell and a host of others and I'm wondering if anyone has any examples of ones that are alive today - fighting to get science out to the people and perhaps minimizing the effects of religion and mysticism in the process? One I can think of is Stephen J. Gould.

He had<br>been fighting bone marrow cancer for the last several years.  He was <br>with his family when pneumonia finally finished him.   I had read an<br>account of his fight against his illness some time ago, it was stirring<br>and courageous.<p>There are several web sites devoted to Sagan right now.  The Dawkins<br>site has a good link.<p>Frederick<br>

: : WAIT A SECOND!!!!!!
: : YOU'RE GOING TO MISS WHOM????!!!!
: : What do you mean you're going to MISS Sagan?!

: : Granted, I'm a tad out of the loop being here in Taipei, but I can't believe that Sagan could have died without my hearing about it.  Are you guys on the level?  Cosmos is a modern bible, and Dragons of Eden was a fantastic compilation of modern thought on the evolution of the human mind.  Say it aint so! I can't believe his death wouldn't even get a mention on BBC World Service.  Someone write to me to clear this up, please.

: 
: Yes, it is true.  Sagan died Dec. 20th in Seattle, Washington.  He had
: been fighting bone marrow cancer for the last several years.  He was 
: with his family when pneumonia finally finished him.   I had read an
: account of his fight against his illness some time ago, it was stirring
: and courageous.

: There are several web sites devoted to Sagan right now.  The Dawkins
: site has a good link.

: Frederick

There are people who actually think that technology is magic.<p>No, I haven't heard of Clarke's Law - tell me about it.<br>As for technology - there are already people claiming that the internet was God's creation as was the printing printing press in the Middle Ages. You can see that whenever any large advance has been made in the communications industry - a revival of religion takes place. Time magazine did a half-ass job on the subject recently.

: 
: : : It seems like you're saying here that because we can't prove in something's non-existence then a belief in it is as reasonable as a disbelief in it but again, like the question of whether God exists or not - I'll have to disagree. There IS evidence that an afterlife is unlikely (medical science would be the leader in this I believe) so this is the criteria I use to base my beliefs on. It would seem more realistic to me that an afterlife did not exist by weighing the various findings in the matter - so I think that instead of deluding ourselves with the &quot;pleasant&quot; thought of a reunion with our loved ones we should find a better way for people to accept death without ripping their hearts out. It is a sad issue but I think it's even sadder that we need such an irrational belief to ease the suffering - I think there are alternatives. I apologize if I've offended anyone - feel free to offend me back!

: : Even with all of the evidence for evolution and the like there will always be those who will only believe the old outdated beliefs. I'm constantly amazed that there are still people who believe that the Earth is flat and that we are the centre of the Universe.

: : You've heard of Clarke's Law about technology and magic? Well I read in an issue of Analog that it can be applied to many in our own society today. There are people who actually think that technology is magic.

: No, I haven't heard of Clarke's Law - tell me about it.
: As for technology - there are already people claiming that the internet was God's creation as was the printing printing press in the Middle Ages. You can see that whenever any large advance has been made in the communications industry - a revival of religion takes place. Time magazine did a half-ass job on the subject recently. The Vatican will supposedly have a site come the new year and I imagine it will be most beautiful but the whole idea of a revival of religion scares me. We are well aware of the effects that slick advertising can have on a mind and unfortunately skeptical minds aren't the majority yet. The Celestine Prophecy also had a great deal to do with this revival I believe - in my books, spirituality and mysticism are almost synonomous with religion and it's making it very difficult for me to have a decent conversation with anyone outside of my small circle of friends and loved ones.

<br>: I am glad to see someone besides the pompous cycops giving the other side of things on new age and other far out or supernatural topics.  I just want you to know that all of us who believe in someone higher than ourselfs are not flat earthers or creationists.  I am a christian but unlike fundlementalists I don't have the presumption to state that I know the mind of the Allmighty.  I know also that no person can really know what happens after death.  Or if anything happens after death.  But, I certainly hope that all the great people and loving personalitys that have walked the earth don't simply cease to exist. Thank you for the soapbox.  I'm not trying to convert anyone.  Just wanted to say that not all of us people of faith are kooks.<p>This makes you an agnostic. I'm one as well, I'm also what is called a Secular Humanist.<br>

: Don't you think that the reason why most people believe in life after death is more through desire rather than fact as you state.  Nobody wants to think that when they die they are gone, nobody wants to think that great men/women or loved ones are simply dead or buried.  Unfortunately all rational evidence points to the fact that everyone is dead and gone.  However it is almost impossible to prove that anything does not exist (try and prove that fairies and goblins don't) so it ultimately comes down to your own belief system.  If you were just about any other religion other than Christian you would probably believe in reincarnation for everyone (not just Christ).<p>When it comes to something like this reason and logic go out the window.<br>BTW, before Vatican I reincarnation was a major part of Christianity.<p>

I am glad to see someone besides the pompous cycops giving the other side of things on new age and other far out or supernatural topics.  I just want you to know that all of us who believe in someone higher than ourselfs are not flat earthers or creationists.  I am a christian but unlike fundlementalists I don't have the presumption to state that I know the mind of the Allmighty.  I know also that no person can really know what happens after death.  Or if anything happens after death.  But, I certainly hope that all the great people and loving personalitys that have walked the earth don't simply cease to exist. Thank you for the soapbox.  I'm not trying to convert anyone.  Just wanted to say that not all of us people of faith are kooks.

In Reply to: <a href="810.html">Definition of faith?</a> posted by Stephen Charchuk on January 03, 1997 at 23:20:25:<p>
<br>: I've been having an involved discussion on a BBS about the concept of faith. In all of the dictionaries that I've ever read it basically says that faith is the unquestioning belief in something, usually a religion. The problem is that many on this BBS say that it isn't unquestioned. What do any of you think faith is if not unquestioned belief?<p><br>I think you're probably right that religious people, once they have aquired faith, are probably unwaivering in their belief in God, although I think there are many who continue to question the interpretation of scripture.  <br>I have always been a person that questions everything.  The answer I found was Jesus.  Now that I trust Him, I find that he gives me an answer for every life situation.  If only I had the wisdom to listen everytime.<br>I hope I'm not offending anyone by speaking plainly about my beliefs, but since I am representing the Christian point of view, I figure I might as well.

Obviously though it doesn't always go unquestioned or unchanged or the statements  "keep the faith" and "I'm losing  faith in ..." wouldn't be around. I think faith can perhaps be compared with your belief system. My belief system is similar to that of science - no beliefs are permenent, all are based on evidence and all are subject to change - same goes for my faith in things. When Carlos stated in a posting "keep the faith" I think he refered to the skeptic type faith. Faith in God is probably the one example of the most common held faith around. Regardless of all this though - I try not to use the word much at all, it has to much of a connection with religion now and the original definition has no doubt been lost to that same manipulative power that's played with the rest of them. I suppose I see "belief" and "faith" as meaning the same thing in my case but perhaps I should use "faith" when dealing with personal subjects that require feeling to be taken into account. Like faith in myself and my loved ones. Maybe there's an added bit of feeling when it's used that you have some sort of hope in that thing you place your faith in - you don't think it will let you down whether it's a theory or a person - it can apply to all. Maybe the desire you have that it won't be found false by evidence is part of the meaning.  Whenever I use such words where the definitions are cloudy - I try to research when it first was used and in what pretext and then the various ways it's been used since. When I write about it - I take the time to explain which defintion I'm using and usually it's the original one before the manipulation began - it's a pain in the ass to have to do that all the time but it saves a lot of confusion and misinterpretion by the reader.

   I so often find people who themselves are atheists ot agnostics writing about how people of various faiths should be able to get along together and tolerate each other's beliefs.  They don't see why people can't just live and let live.  Those people obviously have little understanding of the major religions beyond the basic tenets of them.  <p>   I was raised as a christian.  Even after coming to my senses in college, I allowed my "soul" to be courted by various christians who hoped to get me to "see the light" and join their churches.  While my christian upbringing may have hindered my intellectual progress, it did give me an understanding of just what kinds of people we're dealing with and just what drives them.  After all, I myself once thought that all non-christians were going to hell.  Please listen, all live-and-let-live skeptics, to what I have to say.<p>   The christians and the muslims believe that there is one, and ONLY one way to their god; i.e. their way.  The christians believe that jesus christ is the only way to god, and that is their duty to see to it that all persons on this earth become christians.  The muslims have the same sense of duty to bring all persons to follow mohammed, the seal of the prophets.  There is no room in their programs for co-existence or tolerance.  The fact that the infidels don't want to believe or are too smart to believe can not be allowed to stand in the way of the fulfillment of god's will for ALL humanity.  Anyone who opposes their efforts, like biology teachers who dare to teach about evolution, are enemies of god and have thus forfeited any rights to clemency.<p>   Some of you will wonder how anyone could possibly think in such a way.  Some of you will not want to believe this.  Some of you will want to dismiss me as simply an anti-religionist.  That would be a mistake.  Just because you couldn't ever bring yourself to feel a certain way doesn't mean that such feelings don't exist.  Just because I don't like watermelon doesn't mean there aren't plenty of people who do.<p>   Yes, there are moderate christians and muslims who don't feel the need to evangelize.  It's lucky for the rest of us that they are too lazy, selfish and complacent to take on the task that their religion demands of them.  If they were true to their faith, they'd be making life hell for the rest of us right now.<p>   An analogy that has occured to me about various religions is that of tumors.  Some religions, like Buddhism and Hinduism, are relatively benign tumors.  They won't metastasize and threaten the entire body with systemic cancer.  Other religions, like christianity and islam, are malignant tumors which pose a grave threat to entire body.  They will, if allowed, metastasize and spread cancer where ever they can.<p>   What is the logical conclusion of my statements?  Am I "preaching" war on religion?  Of course not.  I'm simply saying that we can't be complacent about defending our rights to freely explore the universe of knowledge and to question dogma.  We must do our best to ensure fully open intellectual doors for future generations.  There are those out there who would just love to take our freedom away from us.  Our intellectual freedom is like a shining city standing in the midst of a land of barbarians.<p>   That's all for today.  I'm sure we'll continue this later.

The christians believe that jesus christ is the only way to god, and that is their duty to see to it that all persons on this earth become christians.

Anyone who opposes their efforts, like biology teachers who dare to teach about evolution, are enemies of god and have thus forfeited any rights to clemency.<p>I think these are pretty sweeping statements. Not all Christians and Muslims believe<br>in these things. Just the hard line fundamentalists. Yes, I agree that conservative<br>Christians believe Jesus is the "only way" and that all who don't submit will be <br>roasted by their deity. Yes, it is a form of metaphysical chauvinism, but despite<br>this, many conservative Christians are interested in tolerance. In fact, I've learned<br>that many of them oppose anti-tolerance movements like the Christian Coalition and <br>the Christian Reconstruction movement.<p>:    Yes, there are moderate christians and muslims who don't feel the need to evangelize.  It's lucky for the rest of us that they are too lazy, selfish and complacent to take on the task that their religion demands of them.  If they were true to their faith, they'd be making life hell for the rest of us right now.<p>This is an ad hominem attack. I know some liberal Christians and I have read some<br>of their literature.

: :    The christians and the muslims believe that there is one, and ONLY one way to their god; i.e. their way.  The christians believe that jesus christ is the only way to god, and that is their duty to see to it that all persons on this earth become christians.  The muslims have the same sense of duty to bring all persons to follow mohammed, the seal of the prophets.  There is no room in their programs for co-existence or tolerance.  The fact that the infidels don't want to believe or are too smart to believe can not be allowed to stand in the way of the fulfillment of god's will for ALL humanity.  Anyone who opposes their efforts, like biology teachers who dare to teach about evolution, are enemies of god and have thus forfeited any rights to clemency.

: I think these are pretty sweeping statements. Not all Christians and Muslims believe
: in these things. Just the hard line fundamentalists. Yes, I agree that conservative
: Christians believe Jesus is the &quot;only way&quot; and that all who don't submit will be 
: roasted by their deity. Yes, it is a form of metaphysical chauvinism, but despite
: this, many conservative Christians are interested in tolerance. In fact, I've learned
: that many of them oppose anti-tolerance movements like the Christian Coalition and 
: the Christian Reconstruction movement.

: :    Yes, there are moderate christians and muslims who don't feel the need to evangelize.  It's lucky for the rest of us that they are too lazy, selfish and complacent to take on the task that their religion demands of them.  If they were true to their faith, they'd be making life hell for the rest of us right now.

: This is an ad hominem attack. I know some liberal Christians and I have read some
: of their literature. They are often very sincere and intelligent people. In fact,
: I know four liberal Christians who were ex-fundamentalists who changed their
: religious beliefs due to philosophical reasoning. Before making such statements about
: liberal religionists, I highly recommend that you understand why they hold their

:    I so often find people who themselves are atheists ot agnostics writing about how people of various faiths should be able to get along together and tolerate each other's beliefs.

After all, I myself once thought that all non-christians were going to hell.  Please listen, all live-and-let-live skeptics, to what I have to say.<br>:    The christians and the muslims believe that there is one, and ONLY one way to their god; i.e. their way.  The christians believe that jesus christ is the only way to god, and that is their duty to see to it that all persons on this earth become christians.  The muslims have the same sense of duty to bring all persons to follow mohammed, the seal of the prophets.  There is no room in their programs for co-existence or tolerance.  The fact that the infidels don't want to believe or are too smart to believe can not be allowed to stand in the way of the fulfillment of god's will for ALL humanity.  Anyone who opposes their efforts, like biology teachers who dare to teach about evolution, are enemies of god and have thus forfeited any rights to clemency.<br>:    Some of you will wonder how anyone could possibly think in such a way.  Some of you will not want to believe this.  Some of you will want to dismiss me as simply an anti-religionist.  That would be a mistake.  Just because you couldn't ever bring yourself to feel a certain way doesn't mean that such feelings don't exist.  Just because I don't like watermelon doesn't mean there aren't plenty of people who do.<br>:    Yes, there are moderate christians and muslims who don't feel the need to evangelize.  It's lucky for the rest of us that they are too lazy, selfish and complacent to take on the task that their religion demands of them.  If they were true to their faith, they'd be making life hell for the rest of us right now.<br>:    An analogy that has occured to me about various religions is that of tumors.  Some religions, like Buddhism and Hinduism, are relatively benign tumors.  They won't metastasize and threaten the entire body with systemic cancer.

<br>: I've been reading through several of the lively debates elsewhere on the board, and I was wondering:<br>: At what point does skepticism become cynicism?<p>This is my opinion but I don't necessarily think skepticism does develop on into cynicism if one sticks to reason. Cynics appear to me as grumpy pessimistic people seeing nothing good in the world that wasn't put there for a selfish reason or an alteriro motive then what it looks like. There most definately is a lot of that in the world and a cynic has most likely seen a lot of it - maybe found the "american dream" (or any other nation) to be not what it's cracked up to be. I think we can be cynical in several areas - for me I suppose politics would be one such area. When I was young my dad and his pals belonged to an intimate group called "the cynic's corner" - I thought hey, I wanna be a cynic too! Then I saw what it was really all about - just a bunch of whining men pissed off that the 'systems' of the world are the way they are. In their case - they are all professors and are pissed about the university's administration system - I can't blame them either. More than likely though, a cynic isn't as cynical as he thinks he is and is still able to laugh and enjoy life like all of us. Skepticism I don't think really comes into the picture as a factor but probably most cynics are skeptics as well. Like all terms they've both been used and abused over the course of their lives and there are several definitions for either. I like the magazine 'skeptics' idea that skepticism is more of a tool than a position. As a skeptic - I'm quite willing to believe in something if there's adequate evidence to back it up. In this case cynicism and skepticism don't really have much in common - or at least I can't see where cynicism might apply. I could be hallucinating though.

<br>: (This post is a reply to Lynn's comments)<p>: In your previous post you said that I may get proof of a<br>: spiritual realm but it would be from the Anti-Christ who would<br>: perform signs and wonders. When this begins, you claimed that<br>: people with anti-Christian sentiments would start the <br>: persecution of Christians. You also wanted to discuss biblical<br>: scripture.<p>: To start, I would like to say that I am not your enemy. I'm not<br>: anti-Christian but more accurately, I'm non-Christian. Just because<br>: you're not a Bahai doesn't mean you're anti-Bahai does it? Like I<br>: said before, I can respect the religious beliefs of others but I<br>: cannot embrace them. Also, even if some guy showed me that he had<br>: supernatural powers, I'd rather die than persecute people for their<br>: religious beliefs (and I'm sure that most people who post here<br>: would agree with me).<p><br>I do not consider you my enemy, Jason, but when the time comes for the anti-christ to be revealed he will decieve many, "even the elect, if that were possible".  There are already many who see Christianity as dangerous and the source of many social ills, and worse.   Perhaps they won't participate, but they may turn a blind eye.  Although, atheists and freethinkers my be persecuted too if they do not worship the Beast.      <p><br>: Getting into biblical scripture, I do have a few questions. I'm<br>: sure that you're familiar with the Mosaic Law in the OT. Here's an<br>: example:<p>: "If anyone secretly entices you-- even if it is your<br>: brother, your father's son or your mother's son, or<br>: your own son or daughter, or the wife you embrace, or<br>: your most intimate friend-- saying, "Let us go worship<br>: other gods," .... you must not yield to or heed any<br>: such persons. Show them no pity or compassion and do<br>: not shield them. But you shall surely kill them; your<br>: own hand shall be first against them to execute them,<br>: and afterwards the hand of all the people."<br>: (Deut. 13:6,8-9)<p>: Now if you were an Israelite living in OT times, would you really<br>: obey such an order?

: : (This post is a reply to Lynn's comments)

: : In your previous post you said that I may get proof of a
: : spiritual realm but it would be from the Anti-Christ who would
: : perform signs and wonders. When this begins, you claimed that
: : people with anti-Christian sentiments would start the 
: : persecution of Christians. You also wanted to discuss biblical
: : scripture.

: : To start, I would like to say that I am not your enemy. I'm not
: : anti-Christian but more accurately, I'm non-Christian. Just because
: : you're not a Bahai doesn't mean you're anti-Bahai does it? Like I
: : said before, I can respect the religious beliefs of others but I
: : cannot embrace them. Also, even if some guy showed me that he had
: : supernatural powers, I'd rather die than persecute people for their
: : religious beliefs (and I'm sure that most people who post here
: : would agree with me).

: 
: I do not consider you my enemy, Jason, but when the time comes for the anti-christ to be revealed he will decieve many, &quot;even the elect, if that were possible&quot;.  There are already many who see Christianity as dangerous and the source of many social ills, and worse.   Perhaps they won't participate, but they may turn a blind eye.  Although, atheists and freethinkers my be persecuted too if they do not worship the Beast.      

: 
: : Getting into biblical scripture, I do have a few questions. I'm
: : sure that you're familiar with the Mosaic Law in the OT. Here's an
: : example:

: : &quot;If anyone secretly entices you-- even if it is your
: : brother, your father's son or your mother's son, or
: : your own son or daughter, or the wife you embrace, or
: : your most intimate friend-- saying, &quot;Let us go worship
: : other gods,&quot; .... you must not yield to or heed any
: : such persons. Show them no pity or compassion and do
: : not shield them. But you shall surely kill them; your
: : own hand shall be first against them to execute them,
: : and afterwards the hand of all the people.&quot;
: : (Deut. 13:6,8-9)

: : Now if you were an Israelite living in OT times, would you really
: : obey such an order? If I was the Israelite I would have said,
: : &quot;God, you may have the might but you don't have the right!&quot; Like
: : I said, I'd rather die than persecute people because of their
: : religious beliefs. There's more. Mosaic Law commanded the death
: : penalty for things like: not keeping the sabbath, being a
: : stubborn son, homosexuality, and adultery. In addition, things
: : like genocide and murdering infants and children are routinely
: : commanded to the Israelites by a supposedly omnibenevolent deity.
: : If you subscribe to &quot;Skeptic&quot; perhaps you may have read John
: : Hartung's essay on religious xenophobia and genocide in the OT
: : (vol.3, no.4).

: 
: The latter half of Deuteronomy 13:4 says, &quot;...that man has tried to draw you aside from the way in which the Lord your God commanded you to walk.  So shall you put the evil away from your midst.&quot;
: Worshipping false gods is about the worst thing you can do in God's eyes.  Spiritually speaking, these false worshippers were already dead.  To put them physically to death served two purposes, one was to keep the Israelites undefiled, and two was to keep those destined for punishment from stacking the charges against themselves even higher.    

: : You would probably argue that Jesus fulfilled the OT law and
: : is therefore negated. However, this still doesn't change 
: : the fact that these kind of laws are barbaric and reprehensible.
: : Even if these laws were negated later on, they are totally
: : inconsistent with the idea of an omnibenevolent deity. Now
: : compare the Mosaic Law with something like the Universal 
: : Declaration of Human Rights. Supposedly, one of these systems
: : was inspired by an omnibenevolent deity, and another by sinful
: : imperfect humans. Which system appears more benevolent to you?

: Perhaps you could direct me to a copy of the Declaration of Human Rights

: 
: : I should point out that there is a group called the Christian
: : Reconstruction movement who think that the OT law should still
: : be applied today. They believe that Jesus only fulfilled OT
: : laws like circumcision, animal sacrifice, and dietary rules.
: : From your writing you appear to be a very decent and tolerant 
: : person, so I can tell that you don't adhere to CR beliefs.
: : - Jason 

: :  
: No, I don't.

: I wonder if you, or anyone else here has ever played the game &quot;MYST&quot;.  Unlocking the Bible is a lot like it.  To play the game you go in, look around, and at first glance nothing makes sense, but you keep searching, thinking, and experimenting in order to solve the mystery because you go into it knowing that the answers are there if you look hard enough.  Once you discover the answer to one of the riddles it seems so simple that you can't believe you missed it in the first place.  If you didn't know for sure that the creators of the game had actually made the puzzle solvable, you might be inclined to give up, and quick!  The Bible is a mystery also, and I suppose it takes a certain amount of faith just to look for the meaning and truth of it because you have to believe that it is a solvable puzzle before your start.  I hope this analogy makes sense.  I'm having trouble putting it into words, although I understand it completely in my head.

(This post is a reply to Lynn's comments)<p>In your previous post you said that I may get proof of a<br>spiritual realm but it would be from the Anti-Christ who would<br>perform signs and wonders. When this begins, you claimed that<br>people with anti-Christian sentiments would start the <br>persecution of Christians. You also wanted to discuss biblical<br>scripture.<p>To start, I would like to say that I am not your enemy. I'm not<br>anti-Christian but more accurately, I'm non-Christian. Just because<br>you're not a Bahai doesn't mean you're anti-Bahai does it? Like I<br>said before, I can respect the religious beliefs of others but I<br>cannot embrace them. Also, even if some guy showed me that he had<br>supernatural powers, I'd rather die than persecute people for their<br>religious beliefs (and I'm sure that most people who post here<br>would agree with me).<p>Getting into biblical scripture, I do have a few questions. I'm<br>sure that you're familiar with the Mosaic Law in the OT. Here's an<br>example:<p>"If anyone secretly entices you-- even if it is your<br>brother, your father's son or your mother's son, or<br>your own son or daughter, or the wife you embrace, or<br>your most intimate friend-- saying, "Let us go worship<br>other gods," .... you must not yield to or heed any<br>such persons. Show them no pity or compassion and do<br>not shield them. But you shall surely kill them; your<br>own hand shall be first against them to execute them,<br>and afterwards the hand of all the people."<br>(Deut. 13:6,8-9)<p>Now if you were an Israelite living in OT times, would you really<br>obey such an order? If I was the Israelite I would have said,<br>"God, you may have the might but you don't have the right!" Like<br>I said, I'd rather die than persecute people because of their<br>religious beliefs. There's more. Mosaic Law commanded the death<br>penalty for things like: not keeping the sabbath, being a<br>stubborn son, homosexuality, and adultery. In addition, things<br>like genocide and murdering infants and children are routinely<br>commanded to the Israelites by a supposedly omnibenevolent deity.<br>If you subscribe to "Skeptic" perhaps you may have read John<br>Hartung's essay on religious xenophobia and genocide in the OT<br>(vol.3, no.4).<p>You would probably argue that Jesus fulfilled the OT law and<br>is therefore negated. However, this still doesn't change <br>the fact that these kind of laws are barbaric and reprehensible.<br>Even if these laws were negated later on, they are totally<br>inconsistent with the idea of an omnibenevolent deity. Now<br>compare the Mosaic Law with something like the Universal <br>Declaration of Human Rights. Supposedly, one of these systems<br>was inspired by an omnibenevolent deity, and another by sinful<br>imperfect humans. Which system appears more benevolent to you?<p>I should point out that there is a group called the Christian<br>Reconstruction movement who think that the OT law should still<br>be applied today.

<br>:: I do not consider you my enemy, Jason, but when the time comes for the anti-christ to be revealed he will decieve many, "even the elect, if that were possible".  There are already many who see Christianity as dangerous and the source of many social ills, and worse.   Perhaps they won't participate, but they may turn a blind eye. <br>The Book of Revelations is nothing more than a collection of letters which sent to the 7 major Christian Churches during the first century by John of Patmost. They were mainly his interpretation of the Book of Daniel (If you read the two you will see many simularities.) <p> Although, atheists and freethinkers my be persecuted too if they do not worship the Beast.      <p>The beast in the BoR is Nero Caesar, in those days numbers were interchangacle with letters and the number 666 with a smybol for Nero's name. It was the recent translators who made it a reference to the Devil, or Satan. The name Satan is taken from two nature spirits Sat and Tan.<p>: The latter half of Deuteronomy 13:4 says, "...that man has tried to draw you aside from the way in which the Lord your God commanded you to walk.  So shall you put the evil away from your midst."<p>Standard warning to scare followers into staying in line.<p>: Worshipping false gods is about the worst thing you can do in God's eyes.  Spiritually speaking, these false worshippers were already dead.  To put them physically to death served two purposes, one was to keep the Israelites undefiled, and two was to keep those destined for punishment from stacking the charges against themselves even higher.    <p>There are around 6 billion people on this planet now, out of this # there are around 1.5 Christians/Jews, about 1 billion Muslims, around 1 billion people without any religious beliefs (Most live in Russia and China.), less than 1 billion Hindi with the rest being different. ALL have a different idea on the topic of what god is or isn't. Any religion will "warn" its followers against "false" gods, it is a standard practice.<p>: I wonder if you, or anyone else here has ever played the game "MYST".  Unlocking the Bible is a lot like it.  To play the game you go in, look around, and at first glance nothing makes sense, but you keep searching, thinking, and experimenting in order to solve the mystery because you go into it knowing that the answers are there if you look hard enough.  Once you discover the answer to one of the riddles it seems so simple that you can't believe you missed it in the first place.  If you didn't know for sure that the creators of the game had actually made the puzzle solvable, you might be inclined to give up, and quick!  The Bible is a mystery also, and I suppose it takes a certain amount of faith just to look for the meaning and truth of it because you have to believe that it is a solvable puzzle before your start.  I hope this analogy makes sense.  I'm having trouble putting it into words, although I understand it completely in my head.<p>The bible is like a Rubic's Cube where the person, when having trouble matching up the correct colors, will take it apart and reassemble it in the desired order and say that they had "solved" it correctly.<br>

: : The latter half of Deuteronomy 13:4 says, &quot;...that man has tried to draw you aside from the way in which the Lord your God commanded you to walk.  So shall you put the evil away from your midst.&quot;

: Standard warning to scare followers into staying in line.

: : Worshipping false gods is about the worst thing you can do in God's eyes.  Spiritually speaking, these false worshippers were already dead.  To put them physically to death served two purposes, one was to keep the Israelites undefiled, and two was to keep those destined for punishment from stacking the charges against themselves even higher.    

: There are around 6 billion people on this planet now, out of this # there are around 1.5 Christians/Jews, about 1 billion Muslims, around 1 billion people without any religious beliefs (Most live in Russia and China.), less than 1 billion Hindi with the rest being different. ALL have a different idea on the topic of what god is or isn't. Any religion will &quot;warn&quot; its followers against &quot;false&quot; gods, it is a standard practice.

: : I wonder if you, or anyone else here has ever played the game &quot;MYST&quot;.  Unlocking the Bible is a lot like it.  To play the game you go in, look around, and at first glance nothing makes sense, but you keep searching, thinking, and experimenting in order to solve the mystery because you go into it knowing that the answers are there if you look hard enough.  Once you discover the answer to one of the riddles it seems so simple that you can't believe you missed it in the first place.  If you didn't know for sure that the creators of the game had actually made the puzzle solvable, you might be inclined to give up, and quick!  The Bible is a mystery also, and I suppose it takes a certain amount of faith just to look for the meaning and truth of it because you have to believe that it is a solvable puzzle before your start.  I hope this analogy makes sense.  I'm having trouble putting it into words, although I understand it completely in my head.

: The bible is like a Rubic's Cube where the person, when having trouble matching up the correct colors, will take it apart and reassemble it in the desired order and say that they had &quot;solved&quot; it correctly.
