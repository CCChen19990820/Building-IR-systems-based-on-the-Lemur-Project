<h3>CLINTON IS BYPASSING THE SENATE ON THE ABM TREATY</h3>

Backgrounder Update No. 266<br>
December 15, 1995<br>
<p>
(Updating <i>Backgrounder</i> No. 867, "Removing the ABM Treaty Obstacle to U.S. and 
Soviet Defenses Against Missiles," November 15, 1991.)
<p>
<hr width=50%>
</center><p>
The Clinton Administration has reached a "framework agreement" with Russia to resolve two long-
standing disputes over the future and scope of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) 
Treaty.<sup>1 </sup>  The ABM Treaty all but bars the United States from deploying defenses 
against long-range ballistic missiles. The agreement with Russia would do two things: 
<p><ol>
<li>Name which republics of the now-defunct Soviet Union are subject to the treaty; and 

<li>Define a new dividing line between defenses against long-range missiles, which are subject to 
the ABM Treaty's restrictions, and defenses against shorter-range missiles, which are not. 
</ol><p>
The U.S. Constitution requires that the executive branch submit these new agreements to the Senate 
for its advice and consent. Failing to do so would be illegal.
<p>
Yet this is exactly what President Bill Clinton intends to do. The President wants the new 
agreement with Russia to be implemented as an "agreed statement" in the Standing Consultative 
Commission (SCC), a joint U.S.-Soviet committee established in 1972 to consult on the details of 
implementing the ABM Treaty. "Agreed statements" in the SCC do not require the consent of the 
Senate. In effect, the Clinton Administration is attempting to bypass the Senate, thereby 
circumventing its constitutional role in the ratification of international treaties. This is not only 
illegal; it is strategically unwise. The Senate needs to ensure that its constitutional prerogatives are 
preserved. It needs to take action to force the Clinton Administration to submit the U.S.-Russian 
agreement to the Senate for its advice and consent.
<p>

<b>The Framework Agreement with Russia</b>
<p>
While the official text of the framework agreement between the U.S. and Russia has not been made 
public officially, the press has published a classified version of it.<sup>2 </sup>  From public 
reports, it is clear that the agreement framework attempts to resolve two problems regarding the 
ABM Treaty. These problems have remained ever since the collapse of the U.S.S.R. in December 
1991, which effectively nullified America's previous partner in the ABM Treaty -- the Soviet 
Union.
<p>
<b>Problem #1</b>: The first is designating which republics of the former Soviet Union would 
replace the U.S.S.R. as the new legally bound partners of the treaty. Press reports reveal that the 
Clinton Administration plans to "multilateralize" the treaty by designating several of the 15 former 
Soviet republics as the new treaty partners.<sup>3 </sup>  These republics would include Belarus, 
Kazakhstan, Russia, and Ukraine, among others.
<p>
<b>Problem #2</b>: The second unresolved problem is to define a new line between defenses 
against long-range (strategic ballistic) missiles, which are subject to ABM Treaty restrictions, and 
defenses against shorter-range missiles, which are not. The original language in the text of the 
ABM Treaty is ambiguous. Article II both fails to define "strategic ballistic missiles" and Article VI 
fails to explain exactly when non-ABM systems are given an ABM capability or are tested in "an 
ABM mode."
<p>
The framework agreement would establish entirely new definitions for these systems. Any anti-
missile interceptor tested against a target missile with a velocity of 3.1 miles per second or higher 
and a range of 2,175 miles would be considered a defense against strategic (long-range) ballistic 
missiles. Therefore, such an interceptor would be subject to the treaty. Second, the agreement 
would impose a limit on the speed of interceptors. If the interceptor speed is 1.9 miles per second or 
less, it would not be regarded as a treaty-limited, strategic defense system. An interceptor with a 
speed in excess of 1.9 miles per second would be presumed to be a strategic defense interceptor and 
thus subject to the ABM Treaty. 
<p>
In addition, the framework agreement includes a number of "confidence-building measures."  One 
would be to impose restrictions on the number and location of defenses against shorter-range 
missiles deployed by the U.S. The purpose would be to ensure that short-range missile defenses 
cannot be used as interceptors against the long-range missiles deployed by Russia.
<p>
The new definitions and restrictions established in the framework agreement apparently are 
designed to kill the Navy Upper Tier system, a missile defense system the Navy is developing for 
use on cruisers. The Navy Upper Tier's interceptor, called the <i>Standard</i> missile, has a 
velocity of greater than 1.9 miles per second; therefore, it would be subject to ABM Treaty 
restrictions under the framework agreement. Since Article V of the ABM Treaty prohibits the 
development, testing, and deployment of interceptors on mobile platforms such as ships, the 
velocity for the <i>Standard</i> missile would have to be reduced to comply with the Treaty. This 
would weaken the capability of the missile, effectively making it less useful as a defense against 
ballistic missiles. 
<p>
Moreover, the confidence-building measures contained in the agreement would give the Russians 
and other countries a veto over where and in what numbers the Upper Tier ships may be deployed. 
The reason: The agreement requires the U.S. to provide assurances to its ABM Treaty partners that 
deployed defenses against short-range missiles will not pose a realistic threat to long-range 
missiles. But this means that Russia and other countries, not the U.S., will judge whether these 
deployments are a threat. If they feel threatened by U.S. defenses, they simply will veto America's 
deployment of the Upper Tier ships.
<p>
<b>Clinton Bypasses the Senate</b>
<p>
Anticipating that the Clinton Administration was likely to bypass the Senate with a new resolution 
on the ABM Treaty, Congress last year sought to ensure that an agreement with Russia and perhaps 
several other republics of the former Soviet Union would be subject to review by the Senate. 
Section 232 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1995 (Public Law 103-337) 
states: "The United States shall not be bound by any international agreement entered into by the 
President that would substantively modify the ABM Treaty unless the agreement is entered 
pursuant to the treaty making power of the President under the Constitution."
<p>
In the past, the Clinton Administration has argued that it could not pledge in advance to submit 
ABM Treaty agreements to the Senate because it could not know whether their content would 
warrant Senate review. Of course, the content of the agreement is now known, but the Clinton 
Administration still refuses to submit the agreement to the Senate. Instead, it rushed to a meeting of 
the Standing Consultative Commission, on December 4, in order to formalize the agreement with 
the Russians. All outward appearances indicate that the Administration intends to treat the 
agreement as an SCC "agreed statement" not subject to Senate review.
<p>
In short, the Clinton Administration apparently plans to present the Senate with a <i>fait 
accompli</i>. The President's advisors may try to argue that the Russian agreement does not 
substantively modify the ABM Treaty. But this would make a mockery of the law and the facts. 
The very first clause of the ABM Treaty begins by saying that "The United States of America and 
the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, hereinafter referred to as the Parties" will be subject to the 
treaty. Surely, striking the reference to the Soviet Union and replacing it with the names of as many 
as 12 countries substantively modifies the ABM Treaty.
<p>
Changing the names of the parties amounts to more than a formality. It could result in a 
fundamental change in the deployment restrictions of the treaty. A 1974 protocol to the treaty limits 
each side to one ABM site of 100 interceptors.<sup>4 </sup>  If 12 states are designated to replace 
the Soviet Union, each as a legal party to the treaty, then the ABM Treaty now would allow 12 
ABM sites on the territory where it previously allowed only one. Surely, adding 11 new ABM sites 
is a substantive change in the treaty.
<p>
Further, the SCC was designed to work as an implementation forum between two parties. 
Substantive arrangements for the functioning of the SCC must change if more than two states are 
participating. Under the new arrangement, the U.S. would face as many as 12 representatives on the 
other side of the table instead of one. One of those representatives is certain to be Russia. Most of 
the other countries in the SCC would likely be under the influence of Russia and might even form a 
voting bloc with Russia, thereby easily outvoting the U.S. in settling disputes. It would be absurd to 
argue that changing the SCC in this way is not substantive.
<p>

<b>What the Senate Should Do</b>
<p>
The impending actions by the Clinton Administration present the Senate with a challenge to its 
treaty-making authority. The Senate has political and legal tools at its disposal to confront the 
Clinton Administration's attempts to bypass it.
<p>
The political tool is to withhold Senate action on matters deemed important by the President until 
the agreement is submitted to the Senate. The logical targets of delay by the Senate would be other 
treaties, including the Chemical Weapons Convention, the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty II 
(START II), and, if the dispute carries on beyond next year, the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban 
Treaty as well.<sup>5 </sup>  The Senate leadership should make it clear that it will not complete 
action on any of these treaties if the Administration tries to circumvent the Senate with its changes 
in the ABM Treaty.<sup>6 </sup>
<p>
The legal tool is for the Senate to pass a resolution calling on President Clinton to submit the 
framework agreement for the advice and consent of the Senate. Assuming Clinton refused, the 
Senate could instruct its Office of Legal Counsel to file suit against the Clinton Administration with 
the intent of barring implementation of an ABM Treaty agreement that does not have Senate 
approval. While the statute governing the operation of the Senate's Office of Legal Counsel does 
not expressly authorize initiating lawsuits on behalf of the Senate as an institution, it would be 
possible for the Senate leadership to authorize this action by adopting a Senate resolution. Further, 
an individual member of the Senate could file a similar suit on his or her own. It would be 
preferable, however, for the Office of Legal Counsel to file the suit and speak for the Senate as an 
institution.
<P>

<b>Conclusion</b>
<p>
The framework agreement which the Clinton Administration has reached with Russia, assuming it 
is formalized in the coming days, will have a profound impact on the nation's security. It will 
determine which countries become ABM Treaty partners, change the way the ABM Treaty 
functions, and impose new restrictions on U.S. programs for fielding defenses against both shorter-
range and long-range missiles. The voice of the Senate deserves to be heard on such important 
matters.
<p>
However, hearing the Senate's voice appears to be too inconvenient for the President. He is trying 
to bypass the Senate by changing the ABM Treaty on his own, without submitting his changes to 
the Senate for its advice and consent. This is patently illegal. The treaty-making powers vested in 
the Senate by the Constitution exist to protect the nation's security, not to suit the convenience of 
the Clinton Administration. The Senate should be prepared to fight to uphold both its 
responsibilities and the nation's security. The Administration's framework agreement on the ABM 
Treaty should be brought before the Senate for its advice and consent.

as for China, this is a critical relationship, one that will significantly shape the economic and 
strategic contours of the Asia-Pacific region. This is a region in which the United States has vital 
national interests at stake. Indeed, China's emergence as a great power, how it integrates into the 
international system or fails to do so, will be among the defining issues for the United States, for 
Asia, and for the international community for at least the first quarter of the next century. Our 
speakers today have played significant roles in the evolution and development of United States 
relations with China over the past 25 years. Looking ahead, their experience, both inside and 
outside the government, and their judgment should serve as useful and thoughtful guides in dealing 
with the challenges of the next century.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<a name="free">CHAS FREEMAN</a>: Thank you very much, 
Jim. I'm going to go right into the subject of U.S.-China relations and a variety of issues that have 
arisen in those relations. 
 On one level, U.S.-China relations are flourishing. Economic interaction and cultural exchange are 
very healthy elements of Washington's relationship with Beijing, but political relations are deeply 
strained. They are drifting. The situation is highly unstable for several reasons which I will address. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The recent so-called summit meeting in New York between 
President Jiang Zemin and President Clinton was a great success in the sense that the highest 
aspiration of both sides was to prevent further deterioration in their relations, and that objective was 
achieved. The meeting accomplished virtually nothing in positive terms and left many questions 
unresolved. Indeed, it may have inadvertently confirmed a Chinese view that the United States is 
indifferent to the fate of Taiwan. The Taiwan issue, which is the central issue in U.S.-China 
relations at the moment, continues to be one that the Administration does not wish to address, and 
which the Chinese are happy to see the United States neglect.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;It is often stated in this city that the strain in U.S.-China relations 
on the political level is the product of some sort of succession crisis in Beijing, or of domestic 
difficulties in China. Neither proposition can stand up to scrutiny. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;First, the succession has in fact occurred. One of Deng Xiaoping's 
great achievements is to be a Chinese leader who turned over to others responsibility for leading the 
country while he was still alive--something that is rare in Chinese history and which will be a great 
contribution to Chinese political culture if others emulate it in the future. There are differences 
between leaders in Beijing just as there are differences in every capital between political leaders 
(we've just had an illustration of that in this city), but to describe this as a power struggle in terms of 
the 1950s, 1960s, or 1970s is a gross overstatement. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The second issue that is cited is the four difficulties that China 
faces domestically, which some would call crises. I do not call them crises because they are not 
urgent; nor are they impossible to resolve. But there are four major difficulties facing the new 
Chinese government.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The first is a spiritual or ideological vacuum. The Chinese people 
are cynical about ideology, and nationalism alone now serves as a strong force for Chinese unity. 
Nationalism is not a congenial principle in terms of management of difficult issues like the Taiwan 
question.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The second problem is the pattern of Chinese economic 
development, which has rested on bureaucratic entrepreneurship. When bureaucrats buy and sell 
things, people buy and sell bureaucrats. In other words, corruption is the inevitable result. From the 
point of view of the Chinese populace, corruption is probably the central issue in Chinese politics at 
present. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The third problem is the lack of definition of relationships between 
the center and the provinces. This is not a crisis; things work. Thirteen percent economic growth for 
the last three years or so is not bad by any standard; it was 10 percent for the previous decade. Yet 
the center is trying to do things which it is incapable of doing, and the provinces are trying to do 
things which they are incapable of doing. The result is confusion and a measure of unpredictability 
about decisions that are important in economic and political terms. This is an issue which must be 
addressed.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The final problem, I believe, is in the context of rising nationalism 
and an inadequate structure for civilian control of the military. I will leave that for a later 
discussion. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; These factors do have an influence on U.S.-China bilateral 
relations, but it is not the decisive influence. Let me simply make an obvious point. China now 
enjoys its best relations in history with most of the world's great powers. The relationship between 
China and Russia is the most equal and healthy that it has been in two centuries. Relations between 
China and the great powers of Europe--including Britain, where differences over Hong Kong have 
recently been set aside; Germany, which is actively courting China; and France, which after some 
difficulties over the Taiwan question has returned to the good graces of Beijing--are all as good as 
they have ever been in this century. Relations between China and Japan, due to careful management 
by both sides, have not been troubled as they were in the past. They are probably the best that they 
have been in many, many years. Relations with India are the best since the 1950s. Only the United 
States is an exception. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;If we look for why this is the case, perhaps we should look not in 
Beijing, but here. American relations with Japan and Britain are the least cordial and effective they 
have been since World War II. Relations with Germany are the least intimate they have been since 
the 1950s. Relations with France are the most strained they have been since the early 1960s. U.S. 
relations with Russia are deeply troubled, and relations with India still fall far short of their 
potential. So perhaps we should ask why China should be the exception in U.S. foreign relations, 
rather than looking for explanations inside China. Nevertheless, the fact is that U.S.-China relations 
have taken some very hard knocks over the past five or six years. Remember how this relationship 
began. It began at the outset of the 1970s, based on a common strategic concern with Soviet 
expansionism. It rested on several principles. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The first was to pursue, first, strategic dialogue and later, after 
1979's normalization agreement, strategic cooperation. The second was to live and let live in terms 
of ideological differences and the differences between the two societies' cultural and social 
traditions. Mutual tolerance rather than mutual harping and criticism were agreed. We set aside 
regional differences--even major ones about the Vietnam War at the beginning of the 1970s--in 
order to pursue these larger interests in cooperation. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;This relationship also entailed a series of very delicate 
compromises on the issue of Taiwan. These centered on American acknowledgment, and then 
recognition, of the principle that there was only one China and that Taiwan is part of China. In the 
first instance, this was a common belief in Taipei and Beijing. In the normalization communiqu‚, it 
was the position of the Chinese government recognized by the United States. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;This principle of managing relations with Taiwan found expression 
in three communiqu‚s. Let me review those briefly. The Shanghai Communiqu‚ of 1972 
abandoned U.S. policies of containment towards China and reached a compromise on the Taiwan 
issue, taking the United States out of the middle of the Chinese civil war while expressing the 
expectation and hope that the Chinese parties concerned on either side of the strait would work out 
a peaceful solution. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Normalization Communiqu‚ replaced the strategic dialogue 
initiated in the Shanghai Communiqu‚ with strategic cooperation. It strengthened the U.S. formula 
with regard to Taiwan, acknowledging the Chinese position that Taiwan is part of China and that 
there is only one China. It recognized Beijing as the site of the only legal Chinese government and 
traded form for substance in U.S. relations with Taiwan so that the United States--within the 
context of recognizing one China and Taiwan as part of China--would be able to maintain 
economic, cultural, and other unofficial ties with the people of Taiwan. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In August of 1982, the tacit normalization understandings about 
arms sales to Taiwan were made explicit and strengthened. China acknowledged that U.S. arms 
sales to Taiwan would continue, and the U.S. agreed to cap the quality of those arms sales and to 
reduce them step by step, leading over time to a final resolution of the dispute. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;This is the history. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;From the Chinese perspective, the United States has now strayed 
from or explicitly violated every one of the undertakings that I have just cited. This is the core of 
the problem from Beijing's point of view. From the American point of view, I would say, events 
from 1989-1991 destroyed the agreement to set aside ideology in the interest of strategic 
cooperation and replaced tolerance with strident criticism of Chinese human rights practices and an 
ideological confrontation, which has continued. These events then destroyed the strategic triangle. 
The Soviet Union itself -- the common enemy--disappeared. At the same time, Taiwan began to 
withdraw from the consensus it had previously enjoyed with Beijing, that it was part of China and 
that the division of China was an unnatural state of affairs which time and dialogue should repair. 
And, finally, over this period, the United States abandoned an effort we had conducted for 15 years 
to integrate China into global institutions. Increasingly, global institutions were crafted with China 
on the outside. That was the case with the Missile Technology Control Regime. It was the case with 
the Australia Group. More recently, it is the case with the successor to COCOM -- the New Forum. 
We thus have guaranteed that these global regimes will be a source of friction in U.S.-China 
relations. China will not be bound by rules that it did not participate in crafting. Frankly, none of 
these regimes can work because they exclude one of the principal actors with regard to their subject 
matter. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Let me turn now to the present and close. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;This drift and the absence of consensus on a strategic framework 
for the relationship, the absence of strict adherence by either side to understandings that have been 
reached, and the emergence of a strong drive in Taiwan for a separate international identity have 
come together to produce the collapse of mutual confidence and trust. They have engendered 
Chinese effort to deal with the Taiwan issue separately from the United States. In the late spring, 
the Chinese saw Lee Teng-hui come here and Lien Chan (the Prime Minister) go to Europe. They 
saw an offer of a billion dollars to the United Nations for a separate seat for Taiwan. They 
interpreted these things as a major offensive by Taiwan against the status quo, and a breaking of the 
tacit modus vivendi which had preserved peace in the Taiwan Strait. Their response has been 
somewhat erratic but has settled down into the following pattern. You might call this <i>xuan ying 
jian shi</i> -- soft and hard policies simultaneously applied.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;First, the hard policy. It is clear that in the summer the People's 
Liberation Army received authorization to use force against Taiwan to re-impose a <i>modus 
vivendi</i> in the Taiwan Strait. Of the series of exercises to be conducted, two of six known to be 
scheduled have already been carried out. One is apparently about to begin. These exercises are not 
an empty show of force. They are a campaign of military intimidation which could, and may well 
as the coming year unfolds, extend into the actual outbreak of combat in the Taiwan Strait and even 
strikes against Taiwan targets. This campaign of pressure will continue until Taiwan returns to the 
<i>modus vivendi</i> from which it strayed over the preceding year. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;On the soft side, at the same time that this pressure is being 
applied, the PRC has escalated indications of flexibility in terms of reunification. Without getting 
into detail, I can say that Beijing has very clearly signaled to Taiwan that many things which had 
previously seemed non-negotiable are now up for negotiation. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;From the point of view of the United States, which had hoped that 
the Taiwan issue was behind us, this is a most unfortunate set of developments. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;There are many people in Taiwan who are convinced that the 
United States has a commitment to come to Taiwan's aid in the event that its actions provoke 
conflict with the mainland. They are not correct. There is no such commitment, and Taipei should 
not bank on such American steadfastness in pursuit of objectives that the United States has not 
endorsed. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Beijing for its part contains many people, including senior 
members of the Chinese military, who are convinced that the United States will not intervene in the 
Taiwan Strait or come to Taiwan's assistance in the event of conflict arising. These people, too, are 
mistaken. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;They base their conclusions on the following factors: first, that the 
United States is legally stopped from intervening in Chinese internal affairs and that Taiwan is a 
matter of Chinese internal affairs: second, that the American performance in Bosnia and in Somalia 
demonstrates a lack of resolve which would also be played out in the Taiwan Strait; and third, that 
while Taiwan is a vital interest of China which the Chinese explicitly state they are willing to 
sacrifice millions of people and entire cities to manage, it is not such an interest for the United 
States. Nor is the United States prepared to make comparable sacrifices. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;This is not a happy situation. In a legal sense, the Taiwan issue 
may well be a matter of Chinese internal affairs--that is not something I wish to dispute -- but in a 
strategic sense, it is anything but a local matter. The implications of conflict in the Taiwan Strait 
reach well beyond the immediate region of Greater China in two senses. First, I believe it is true 
that the region sometimes called Greater China -- that is, the region of "Straits China," the region 
from Shanghai to Hong Kong, including Taiwan -- will determine the future of China. The future of 
China will determine the future of the Asia-Pacific region. I believe it is most likely that the future 
of the Asia-Pacific region will determine the future of the world, at least for the next century or two. 
Second, if there is conflict in the Taiwan Strait the United States will indeed have to make a 
decision about whether we intervene or don't. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;If we don't intervene, I believe the strategic consequences are 
enormous. The United States has no intrinsic strategic interest in Taiwan, but we do have an interest 
derived from our responsibility for the strategic defense of Japan. That interest, plus his ideology of 
anti- communism, is what led MacArthur in 1949 and early 1950 to dissent from the Truman 
Administration's decision to let the People's Liberation Army conquer Taiwan without opposition. 
He sat in the imperial army headquarters in Tokyo. Like everyone before him who had sat there 
from the time of the Meiji restoration, he saw the strategic importance of Taiwan to Japan's defense. 
Therefore, when Kim Il-Sung attacked South Korea on June 25, 1950, the Seventh Fleet was 
interposed in the Taiwan Strait for two purposes: to prevent the spread of the Korean War and the 
outbreak from its existing borders of the Sino-Soviet bloc and, second, to discharge American 
responsibilities for the strategic defense of Japan. If the United States did not come to Taiwan's aid, 
and if we do not manage the Taiwan question in a suitable manner, Japan will feel betrayed. This is 
not simply a matter of strategic betrayal. It has emotional overtones. There are many people in 
Taiwan who have fond feelings for Japan and many in Japan who have fond feelings for those 
Taiwanese. This is rather unusual in Asia. In fact, Taiwanese are by far the most admiring of 
Japanese among Asians. This is a close emotional relationship. If Japan cannot count on the United 
States to defend its strategic interests, it must do so itself. That means Japan must assume 
responsibility for its own defense. That is Japanese rearmament. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;If the United States does come to Taiwan's assistance in the event 
of conflict, we must use bases in Japan to do so. That will pose a terrible dilemma for the Japanese 
government. One strategic imperative of Japanese policy is to avoid a hostile relationship with the 
mainland of China. It would have to choose between that strategic imperative on the one hand and 
its interest in maintaining the U.S. alliance and its strategic interest in Taiwan on the other. I believe 
Japan would choose the United States and Taiwan. I also believe no future Japanese government 
would ever be willing to be put in a position again in which foreigners made such a momentous 
strategic decision for Japan. The result in this case would be rearmament, but at a slower pace. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;So whether the United States chose to intervene or not, whether the 
PRC succeeded in bringing Taiwan within its orbit or not, the Taiwan issue has the potential to 
overthrow the entire Asian-Pacific strategic balance: not simply to poison U.S.-China relations for 
decades, but also to break the U.S.-Japan alliance and to reignite rivalry between Japan and China, 
with all of the implications in terms of an Asian pattern of containment of China that this might 
itself set off. Therefore, I believe the drift in U.S.-China relations, the failure of the United States 
and China to manage the Taiwan issue, and the very rash actions which Taipei has been taking are a 
great danger to the peace and security of the East Asian and Western Pacific region. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<a name="hard">HARRY HARDING</a>: It's a great pleasure 
to be here this morning, and especially to see so large an audience, containing people every bit as 
knowledgeable about China as the four of us on this panel. The size of the crowd is not only a 
tribute to the convening power of <a href="/heritage/staff/przystup.htm">Jim Przystup</a> and his 
colleagues at The Heritage Foundation, but also an indication of the widespread interest in China's 
growing role in world affairs. As Chas Freeman has just said, China will be the determining factor 
in the future of the Asia-Pacific region.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Chas's remarks have focused on the Taiwan issue. I want to look 
more broadly at the U.S.-China relationship, organizing my comments around three headings. First 
of all, I will suggest why we have legitimate cause for concern about the future of China. Second, 
however, I will argue equally fervently that we should not exaggerate our concern about China, but 
should keep the rise of China in perspective. And finally, I'll draw the implications for American 
policy. I'll suggest that neither of the two policy alternatives most usually discussed--containment 
and engagement -- is a fully adequate or appropriate strategy for dealing with China in the decades 
ahead. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Why are we concerned about the rise of China?  Different people 
will give you different answers to this question. Some would stress China's domestic 
circumstances: that it remains a Communist country, or that it is not yet democratic. My concern is 
more with China's international behavior, and with the nature of the international community 
surrounding China. I can summarize my concern in the following four points:
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;First of all, we are concerned because we are seeing a dramatic 
increase in China's national capabilities, both its economic capabilities and, at least potentially, its 
military capabilities. We see rapid economic growth, we see significant increases (at least in 
nominal terms) in the official Chinese military budget, and we see a commitment to acquire force 
projection capabilities. We also know from the historical record that China is willing to use force to 
achieve its national objectives, even when others might argue that the odds are against it or that it is 
not fully rational in doing so.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Second, we realize that China is not a status quo power. It is a 
demandeur both regionally and, to a degree, globally. Its most obvious demands involve its 
territorial claims, most notably to the South China Sea and to Taiwan. It is also clear that China 
seeks major power status and the acknowledgment of that status by others. It seeks to expand its 
influence in the institutions and forums that make decisions economically and strategically for the 
region and the world. China's ambitions are being fueled by rising nationalism. This is not just an 
elite-sponsored nationalism; indeed, I do not yet see any concerted attempt by the Chinese 
government to fan the flames of nationalism. Instead, this is largely a popular nationalism, 
emerging among young people and urban intellectuals, many of whom we might have supposed 
were predisposed to the United States and to the West. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Third, China is not proving to be fully cooperative in various 
international regimes and relationships, both multilateral and bilateral. It is very skeptical about 
non-proliferation regimes, about arms control and disarmament regimes (especially in the nuclear 
field), about environmental regimes, about many global and regional economic regimes, and about 
some of the bilateral trade agreements that it has undertaken with the United States.
<p.
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Finally, the environment surrounding China, a very important 
determinant of any country's international behavior, is not entirely stable. There are long-term 
uncertainties about the balance among the major powers in the region, and about their political 
relationships. There are important potential flash points around China's periphery, including the 
Korean Peninsula, the Taiwan Strait, the South China Sea, and Indochina more generally. Key 
countries that are strategically important to China have uncertain domestic futures, particularly 
Burma, Cambodia, Mongolia, and North Korea. The collapse or the fragmentation of these 
countries could produce pressures or opportunities for Chinese intervention. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;But while all of these developments are grounds for concern, I 
want to emphasize that alarmist thinking is not warranted at this point. The Chinese make a 
distinction between <i>guanxin</i>, which means to be concerned about something, and 
<i>danxin</i>, which means to be very worried about something. My attitude towards China 
currently is much more one of concern than it is one of alarm. This is because each of the four 
points I've mentioned requires immediate qualification. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;First, let me return to China's capabilities. It is very dangerous to 
make the kind of straight-line long-term forecasts that figure so prominently in the discussion of 
China's future here in the United States. Although the Chinese may not be facing an acute or 
immediate crisis along any of the four dimensions that Chas Freeman identified, it is facing chronic 
problems that are potentially extremely serious. Indeed, one discovers that as one travels around the 
periphery of China, other Asian countries are at least as concerned about China's long-term 
weakness as they are about its long-term strength. Or, to put it differently, they are as worried about 
the unconventional security threats that would come from collapse as much as they are concerned 
about the more conventional security threats that would come from strength. In contrast, the 
analysis of China in the United States has not yet fully come to grips with the challenges to China's 
continued economic and social success in the middle to long term.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;With regard to the military more specifically, to say that China is 
increasing its nominal military budget and is seeking to acquire force projection capabilities does 
not mean that China is in a position immediately to attain this kind of modern military force. China 
remains far behind the United States and other major powers technologically, and will remain so for 
many years. While we should monitor China's military preparations very carefully, I don't think we 
should overreact to them.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Second, although China is not a status quo power, it also is not a 
revolutionary power or even a power that seeks major changes in the international system. In the 
1960s, China was exactly that: a revolutionary power that sought to overthrow every single major 
international institution from the United Nations to the World Bank and to promote revolutionary 
insurgencies throughout the Third World. Today, in contrast, China does not seek to undermine 
international institutions, but rather to expand its role within them, just as a claimant to major 
power status might be expected to do. Although this is a matter of some concern, it is not as 
threatening to the international community as is the behavior of truly revolutionary powers that 
regard the international structure as fundamentally illegitimate.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Third, with regard to China's willingness to cooperate, I'm editing 
a volume on the patterns of cooperation in China's international conduct, which I hope will appear 
in print sometime next year. The basic thesis of the book is that, although China is by no means 
fully cooperative in international affairs, it has become increasingly cooperative over the last 150 
years. Chinese leaders have come to understand that they need cooperative international interaction 
to achieve their domestic and foreign objectives. They are therefore increasingly willing to work 
within international institutions and to forge cooperative relationships with other countries. The 
pattern of China's behavior--albeit more in the economic realm than in the security sphere--has 
increasingly been to accept the strictures of the international community. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Finally, although the environment surrounding China is not 
entirely tranquil, still, in comparison with other regions, the Asia-Pacific region is one of the most 
vibrant and stable in the world. There are no power vacuums into which China can easily expand. 
There is a good chance of dealing constructively with the flashpoints and unstable countries around 
China's periphery. So the situation today is very different from the situation that confronted the last 
aspirant to major power status in Asia, namely Japan in the 1920s and 1930s. At that time, Japan 
faced a China in collapse and a number of European colonies in Asia at a time of European 
retrenchment. That was obviously a much more unstable and less vibrant international environment 
than we see in Asia today. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Let me turn finally to the third section of my remarks, about the 
implications for U.S. policy. I'm not satisfied with any of the three major alternatives which have 
been put out on the table in recent years. The first of these is one that I didn't even mention in my 
introductory remarks because, fortunately, it has begun to fall out of favor: a policy of fragmenting 
China, encouraging its breakup into its constituent regions and provinces. There's an internal 
contradiction in that policy that I've never been able to fully understand. If China were really so 
weak that we could cause it to break apart, then why would it pose such a threat to American 
security that a policy of fragmentation would be warranted?  Moreover, a policy of fragmentation 
would be guaranteed to ignite precisely the kind of Chinese nationalism that it is in our interest to 
avoid. And even if we were successful in catalyzing China's disintegration, the fragmentation of 
that country would be an extremely messy process that would have security consequences very 
detrimental to the interests of the United States and its allies. So a policy of fragmentation fails, 
with regard both to the end that it pursues and to the means that it entails.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Containment is, of course, the policy that is more frequently 
presented these days as an alternative to the Clinton Administration's approach. In my judgment, 
the analysis of China's intentions and capabilities that I have presented does not warrant a strategy 
of containing Chinese influence or seeking to hamper China's rise to major power status. Were we 
to do so at this point, we would find ourselves engaging in a self-fulfilling prophecy, creating a 
hostile China. In addition, we would find that no other Asian government -- not Japan, not South 
Korea, not Southeast Asia, not even Taiwan or Vietnam -- would join us in this undertaking. So we 
would be taking on China absolutely alone, condemning ourselves to an adversarial relationship 
with China and therefore to a second Cold War. If it's necessary, a containment policy can, of 
course, be adopted later. But it is by no means an optimal choice for the United States, and it is 
neither necessary nor desirable for us to select this strategy under present circumstances. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The alternative that the Clinton Administration puts forward is the 
policy known as "comprehensive engagement."  There are several problems with this strategy. One 
is that the key word, "engagement," has so many different meanings that it is very difficult to 
explain it to anyone else. It could denote, for example, a betrothal or an agreement to get 
married--certainly not what it means in this particular case. It could mean a military battle, which is 
what many Chinese believe that it means. Or it can mean a meshing of gears or a process of 
dialogue and interaction, which is what the Clinton Administration wants it to mean. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;But even if we go beyond the semantic confusion that surrounds 
the term "engagement," we find that it refers to process without substance. Our engagement with 
China is guided by what vision, and directed at what objectives?  In the end, the concept of 
engagement is an empty one. It refers to dialogue and interaction but does not give a clear sense of 
what American objectives are. As short-sighted and ill-conceived as they are, at least the concepts 
of fragmentation and containment tell you very clearly what American goals towards China would 
be. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;So what's the alternative?  Well, I've never been a good phrase-
maker, and I'm not entirely satisfied with the word that I will put forward. But I would recommend 
a policy of integration: attempting to integrate China into an increasingly vibrant community of 
nations in the Asia-Pacific region in which the United States is also an active participant. In other 
words, our policy should be to encourage the expansion of China's bilateral political and economic 
ties with its neighbors and its active and responsible participation in the emerging economic and 
security institutions that are being established in the Asia-Pacific region. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Now, people in the Clinton Administration might well say that that 
is what they mean by "engagement," even though they don't spell out their objectives quite so 
clearly. But I think there are some significant differences between a policy of engagement and a 
policy of integration. First of all, by talking of integrating China into a regional community, we 
immediately put our policy in a multilateral setting and not just a bilateral one. A policy of 
integration implies that we work together with our friends and allies in the Asia-Pacific region to 
enmesh China in a system of mutually beneficial bilateral and multilateral institutions. In short, 
whereas engagement is an essentially bilateral strategy, integration is inherently multilateral, 
although successfully managing the bilateral relationship between China and the United States 
would be a prerequisite for its success. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Second, a policy of integration would require us to identify our 
common interests with China more clearly, as well as to delineate our concerns about Beijing, 
something that the Clinton Administration has still not fully done. We might say that we welcome 
China's emergence as a major actor in the international economy, including its ability to export to 
other countries, but that we are also asking that China open up its own markets to trade and 
investment from other countries, including the United States. We could make clear that we 
welcome China's growing prosperity, which is good both for the Chinese people and for the rest of 
the world, but that, at the same time, we are concerned about the environmental consequences of 
Chinese industrialization. We should indicate that we acknowledge China's right to national 
security and to a reasonable defense establishment, but that we are very concerned about the 
possibility that China's growing military capability could be destabilizing to the Asia-Pacific 
region, especially when not conducted in a transparent way. And we could say that we respect the 
desire of both the Chinese leaders and the Chinese people for political stability, but that we believe 
that genuine stability can be achieved better through a process of gradual and sustained political 
reform than through repression alone. That kind of statement, identifying both our common 
interests and our differences with the Chinese, would be an important element of an integration 
policy. Such a statement of American objectives has generally been absent from the articulation of 
our engagement policy thus far. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Finally, because of its multilateral dimension, a policy of 
integration alerts us to the importance of not just having a clear strategy towards China, but also 
promoting the stability and vitality of the region as a whole. Security threats are not produced 
simply by the rise of an ambitious or irresponsible major power. Rather, they are created by the rise 
of such a power in an international environment that provides it with either nettlesome provocation 
or easy opportunities. It's therefore very important for us and our friends in the region to maintain 
an international environment that sends a very clear signal to the Chinese: 
<p><ul>
<li>We welcome you into our international community on mutually beneficial terms.
<p>
<li>We are not going to do things that impinge upon your vital national interests. 
<p>
<li>We are not going to create easy opportunities for you to take unfair advantage of. 
<p>
<li>If you attempt to take unreasonable advantage of those opportunities, you will find that the 
community will come together to resist your encroachments and that it has both the resources and 
the political will to do so. 
</ul><P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;So in sum, although this policy of integration is obviously closer to 
engagement than it is to either containment or fragmentation, I think there are three differences: It 
positions the United States as part of an Asia-Pacific community seeking to integrate China, rather 
than focusing so narrowly on our bilateral ties with Beijing; it identifies our common interests with 
the Chinese, as well as the areas in which we differ; and it places as much emphasis on managing 
the regional setting surrounding China as on trying directly to influence Chinese thinking and 
behavior.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<a name="feld">HARVEY FELDMAN</a>: I am not nearly as 
apocalyptic as Chas and I fear probably not as brief as Harry, so I hope you will bear with me, 
particularly because I want to examine the Taiwan leg of this triangular relationship between 
Washington, Beijing, and Taipei in a way that we haven't quite come to grips with yet. And the first 
thing I have to say is that it seems to me that for some 50 years now, our China and Taiwan policies 
have been built upon an interlocked set of confusions and misperceptions. From 1950 to 1979, we 
took the position that China's legal government somehow was lodged in Taipei. Since 1979 we 
have genuflected to Beijing's position that it is also the government of Taiwan. Each of these 
stances is as totally unrealistic as the other. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;As Chas pointed out, successive administrations have said that our 
China and Taiwan policies are based on the three communiqu‚s which he enumerated: Shanghai 
'72, the Recognition Communiqu‚ '78, and the August 17, 1982, communiqu‚ decreasing arms 
sales to Taiwan, plus something called the Taiwan Relations Act. There are substantial 
contradictions among these documents and an even more basic misunderstanding of what they 
mean in their legal effect. The three communiqu‚s are policy statements by the Nixon, Carter, and 
Reagan Administrations. Although the Bush and Clinton Administrations also have adhered to their 
terms, the communiqu‚s are not a body of law, international or domestic. Embedded in them is the 
famous "one-China policy" so often cited to us by White House and State Department spokesmen 
and others as the rationale for a policy which seems so often to be irrational. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Recognition Communiqu‚ signed by Carter in '78 is the one-
China formula most often quoted: "the government of the United States of America acknowledges 
the Chinese position that there is but one China and Taiwan is part of China."  This is a unilateral 
statement of position; it is not a treaty. Nor does it mean, despite what Chas has said, that the 
United States accepts the PRC position that Taiwan is a part of China. Had we said, for example, 
the government of the United States of America acknowledges the Chinese position that Mao 
Zedong sits on the right hand of God and has learned to brush his teeth, that wouldn't mean that we 
believed it. It would mean that we understand that is what the Chinese government believes to be 
the case. The acknowledgment formula is an elegant way of saying we hear you and we don't 
contradict you. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;By contrast, the Taiwan Relations Act, Public Law 96-8 of April 
10, 1979, is the law of the land. It establishes a continuing relationship between the United States 
and Taiwan on an unofficial basis to "preserve and promote extensive close and friendly 
commercial, cultural and other relations."  It also states that the United States considers "any effort 
to determine the future of Taiwan by other than peaceful means including boycotts and embargoes 
is a threat to the peace and security of the Western Pacific area and of grave concern to the United 
States." 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The language "threat to the peace and security of the Western 
Pacific area" was chosen by the Congress for a very specific reason. It replicates the language of 
Chapter Six, "peaceful settlement of disputes," and Chapter Seven, "action with respect to threats to 
the peace," of the United Nations Charter. Moreover, in a statement which is reminiscent of the 
former Mutual Defense Treaty with the Republic of China, the Act goes on to say, "the president is 
directed to inform the Congress promptly of any threat to the security of the social or economic 
system of the people on Taiwan and any danger arising to the interests of the United States 
therefrom. The president and the Congress shall determine in accordance with Constitutional 
processes appropriate action by the United States in response to any such danger." 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;There can be no question that the TRA mandates a much closer 
relationship with Taiwan and with its people than is contemplated by the three communiqu‚s and, 
of course, a much closer relationship with Taiwan than the PRC has wanted us to have. From Carter 
on, administrations have been pressured by Beijing to ignore the plain meaning of the Taiwan 
Relations Act and to cut back on that relationship. In varying degrees, all have been willing to do 
so, reinterpreting the law to suit policy considerations and presumed economic interests. These 
contradictions were much easier to deal with when Taiwan was, like the mainland, a police state 
with all the apparatus of repression, the political prisoners and so on and so forth. Under those 
circumstances the pretensions of the government on Taiwan could be and were treated with a kind 
of amused contempt, and the United States concentrated on getting on with Beijing while still doing 
business with and admitting students from Taiwan. And, of course, the central core of this policy 
was the need to add China as a makeweight in the worldwide struggle with the Soviet Union. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;But now the situation has changed. Not only is the Cold War over, 
but in a remarkably short period of time Taiwan has evolved into a full fledged democracy. It is no 
longer that authoritarian police state. In fact, for the first time in all four thousand years of Chinese 
history, there is a multiparty democracy, a free press, no political prisoners, a representative 
Parliament in which seats are contested at election time. And the major opposition party was 
recently given license to own and operate a television station. Next March, the head of state on 
Taiwan will be chosen by free popular vote, again something unique in Chinese history. Moreover, 
the division of national income on Taiwan is probably the most egalitarian in all of Asia and far 
more egalitarian than here in the United States. To top it all off, the government in Taipei no longer 
asserts any claim to be the legitimate government of all China. It takes the position that within the 
broad historic and cultural entity of China, there are now two governments, that each of them rules 
a defined territory, that each has all the attributes of sovereignty that entitle it to recognition. The 
government in Taipei points out that the government in Beijing has never since its founding on 
October 1, 1949, ruled Taiwan even for a single day. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;So, under these circumstances, what should American policy be?  
Well, we're often given the mantra that goes: PRC is very, very large; PRC is a major military 
power; PRC is a growing economic power; PRC has a seat on the Security Council; Taiwan has 
none of those things. Therefore, the PRC is very, very important to us and Taiwan is not important 
at all, except perhaps, as Chas suggested, strategically in the case of Japan. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;I would make a different argument. Twenty-one million people, 
the population of Taiwan, is not an inconsiderable amount of people, unless you're comparing it 
with the population on the mainland. Twenty-one million people is, after all, the population of 
Australia plus New Zealand plus all the rest of the South Pacific combined. The PRC is much 
larger, but I don't know that size ought to be the criterion of American policy. If size were the 
criterion, we would have taken the part of Indonesia back in the Sukarno days when it was in 
confrontation with Malaysia, the Philippines, and Singapore. In fact, if size were the criterion, we 
would never have founded NATO because, after all, the Soviet Union was very, very large and had 
a very large army and a seat in the Security Council -- all the things that China has. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In fact, policies should not be determined by size but by interests. 
We have a great many of these with the PRC, and they are often interests that deal with issues of 
global reach. We want PRC cooperation with the Security Council on non-proliferation matters and 
on specific problems of trade. In fact, the issues that we have on our China agenda are a great many 
indeed: PRC export of nuclear technology to Pakistan and perhaps to Iran; PRC shipments of 
missile components to Iran and perhaps Iraq; drug trans-shipment through Yunan; piracy of 
American intellectual property; the question of cooperation to restrain the North Korean drive to 
acquire nuclear weapons; export to the U.S. of prison-made goods; reneging on commitments to 
allow Red Cross visits to political prisoners; and, of course, the terms of entry into the World Trade 
Organization. This is without even getting into the question of PRC violation of the norms of 
human rights and fundamental freedoms as defined by the United Nations Charter and by 
international instruments which the PRC itself has signed. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The list is long and obviously contentious, but I have to say that 
the fact that it is long and contentious is not the result of American ill will. In almost every instance, 
everything that is on our agenda puts us in the position of asking Beijing either to make good on a 
promise which it had given us previously, to remain faithful to an international obligation which it 
voluntarily assumed, or to adhere to a standard agreed to by the international community at large. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;From Beijing's point of view, of course, we look like an obnoxious 
bill collector who comes knocking at their door at all kinds of awkward times. But, in fact, the bills 
are important and the debts were honorably incurred. It's hard for me to take seriously the argument 
of some who say that by asking the PRC leadership to make good on these promises that they've 
given, and to live up to the agreements they have signed, we are convincing them that we have 
become a hostile power adopting a policy of containment. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;We've often been told that how the U.S. behaves with respect to 
Taiwan is going to directly affect how the PRC responds to that specific agenda and, therefore, we 
have no choice but to reject Taiwan's hopes for better treatment at our hands because we need the 
PRC. We need the PRC, goes the litany, and we don't need Taiwan. Therefore, in the larger 
interests of regional stability and world peace, we have to take account of Beijing's sensitivities, and 
especially those sensitivities that concern Taiwan. But it seems to me that the claim that PRC 
behavior on regional and world issues is conditioned by how the U.S. behaves with respect to 
Taiwan is simply farfetched. How we deal with Taiwan will certainly affect our relationship with 
Beijing. It may mean that things might get pretty cold. But Beijing sold nuclear technology and 
missiles to Iran long before Lee Teng-hui was admitted to the United States to speak to an alumni 
group at Cornell. The PRC's claim that the entire South China Sea is their territorial water has 
nothing to do with Lee Teng-hui's visit or our sale of F-16 fighter planes to Taiwan. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The fact of the matter is, the policy Beijing adopts with regard to 
any of the items on our agenda responds to their view of their interests and, of course, to the 
exigencies of their own domestic and factional politics. Now I don't mean to suggest that their 
views are unimportant. They obviously are important. Nor do I mean to suggest that we should 
break off dialogue. Obviously, we want to continue. But there is no reason for us not to press our 
own interests with persistence and without hesitation, because they are our interests, and we should 
do so without any apology, no matter whether they refer to the Korean Peninsula, the South China 
Sea, the Philippines, or even Taiwan. I have never believed that we need or should take the view 
that a fruitful Washington-Beijing relationship has to be more important to us than it has to be to 
the PRC. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;I want to point out that we do have interests in Taiwan as well, 
though they are not on the macro world level. About a million Americans have roots in that island. 
It is our fifth, perhaps sixth trading partner. But probably most important of all, it is an example of a 
one-time police state, a Chinese police state at that, that has transformed itself into a democracy. 
This is something that we should value, something we should want maintained, something that we 
should want maintained before the eyes of the Chinese people on the mainland because our and the 
world's interests would be enhanced if that example were imitated on the mainland.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;As far as the strategic element is concerned, given PRC behavior in 
the South China Sea, I cannot conceive that it would be in our interest to have the PRC control both 
sides of the Taiwan Strait as well as the waters of the Bashi Channel between Taiwan and the 
Philippines. This doesn't mean that we have to support Taiwan's claims or become its sponsor on 
the international scene. But I think it does mean that we should treat it with dignity and with a 
seriousness that its accomplishments deserve. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Public Law 96-8, the Taiwan Relations Act, speaks in terms of 
unofficial cultural and commercial relations with Taiwan, so it seems to me there was no reason for 
us ever to have made a fuss about granting a visa to Lee Teng-hui to speak to an alumni group at 
Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. Ithaca is not the navel of the universe. Indeed, it seems to 
me it was the continuing insistence of the State Department that granting such a visa would destroy 
the basis of our one-China policy that created this scandal and its aftermath. If the State Department 
says giving the visa is going to destroy our one-China policy, what can Beijing say?  It can hardly 
say anything less. Let me point out that in the year before we granted that visa, the Prime Minister 
of Taiwan, Lien Chan, spoke at a graduation at the University of Chicago, which is his alma mater, 
and his Foreign Minister Chen Fo had visited the United States twice. Beijing said nothing about it 
either time. Why?  This was all done very, very quietly. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;I think, with Beijing and with Taipei, we should do what our 
interests and our honor require of us. I think our honor requires that we not turn our back on the 
government that has transformed itself into a democracy, and our interest requires that there be no 
aggression in the Taiwan Strait. Here I have to say that deterrence is a very, very important factor, 
and I agree with Chas we have to tell the people on Taiwan that they cannot count on our assistance 
if they crudely provoke Beijing to action. But we also have to say to Beijing that they cannot 
conclude we would stand idly by in the event of invasion, boycott, or embargo, exactly as is stated 
in the Taiwan Relations Act. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;As far as Taiwan's hopes to raise its international profile, I think 
there are things in our interest that we can and should do. We found it in our interest to help Taiwan 
back into the Asian Development Bank. Given the fact that Taiwan has a hundred billion dollars in 
foreign exchange reserves, I see no reason why we should not try to have Taiwan enter into some 
form of association with the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the World 
Bank, and the International Monetary Fund. It's worth noting that Taiwan continued to be a 
member of the Bank and the Fund for nine years after it lost its General Assembly seat, making the 
point that you don't have to be a member of the General Assembly to be a member of the Bank and 
the Fund. It's also interesting to note that the PRC is that Bank's largest debtor. If Taiwan is willing 
to lend money to the PRC, I say let them do it. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<a name="sol">RICHARD SOLOMON</a>: This panel 
discussion has covered very rich and controversial material. Let me try to pull together some of the 
key points in terms of policy.
I should begin by saying that my political instinct--which over more than a dozen years of 
government work I've learned to trust--is that within a decade we are likely to be back in a military 
confrontation with the PRC. There are territorial and strategic issues of extreme importance to both 
the United States and the PRC that, without wise and engaged leadership, are very likely to impel 
us back in the direction of a confrontation. What I'll try to do here is to suggest there is a way to 
cope with these issues in a more constructive way than confrontation, but it does require a 
leadership commitment on both sides that I'm not sure is there. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The crisis in U.S.-PRC relations of this past summer ("mini-crisis" 
might be more appropriate) over a range of factors--the Lee Teng-hui visit, the Harry Wu 
case--played an important role in focusing our attention on issues related to the U.S.-China 
relationship that, frankly, we haven't paid much attention to. Since the Tiananmen suppression in 
the early summer of 1989, the United States has essentially been paralyzed on China policy. In one 
night of violence, as we all saw it on CNN, the political consensus in the United States for normal 
relations with the PRC was destroyed. It put the leadership in Beijing on the political defensive; it 
de-legitimized certain PRC leaders who were seen as responsible for the violence; and it made it 
very difficult to sustain a high-level dialogue between Washington and Beijing. As we all know, the 
secret Scowcroft trip to China in July of 1989, which was an effort to sustain a leadership dialogue, 
was roundly attacked in our domestic politics. And that has led to a situation where the ground rules 
for managing the U.S.-PRC relationship -- which were established during the Nixon Administration 
in the Shanghai Communiqu‚ and the two subsequent joint communiqu‚s on normalization in 1979 
and Taiwan arms sales in 1982 -- have now largely broken down.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;I think we also have to recognize that for the quarter of a century 
since President Nixon's visit to China in 1972, all the parties involved in this situation -- China, 
Taiwan, Hong Kong, the United States -- have really had a very good show. Everyone has benefited 
by the stability in the region induced by U.S.-PRC normalization. It has enabled China under Deng 
Xiaoping's reforms of late 1978 to make an economic takeoff that has put China on the path to 
national economic development for the first time since the early 19th century. The "self-
strengthening" effort late in that century failed with the collapse of the Ching dynasty, and there 
followed a century of foreign intervention and revolution. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The turmoil of that extended period prevented the Chinese from 
taking off economically in the way, for example, that Japan, the United States, and the nations of 
Europe did. So today, for the first time in that 150-year period, the Chinese have finally attained a 
high rate of sustained economic expansion. As you know, China today is growing at more than 10 
percent a year and is projected to become the largest aggregate economy in the world sometime in 
the second or third decade of the coming century.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Taiwan has flourished as well since the early 1970s. In the 25 
years since the secret Henry Kissinger trip to Beijing, Taiwan's per capita income has gone up 
tenfold, from a little over twelve hundred dollars to ten times that today. They've attained the kinds 
of reforms that Harvey Feldman has noted and have done spectacularly well for themselves. Today, 
of course, their interest is in trying to protect their achievements.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;For the United States, for the first time in over a century, we've 
benefited from good relations with all the major players in East Asia, especially Japan and China, at 
the same time. And our domestic economic growth has been fueled in large measure by exports to 
the booming Asia-Pacific economy. I call to your attention the just-released Heritage report on 
APEC, which identifies our substantial economic interests in the region.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;If everyone has benefited from the situation that grew out of the 
negotiation of the Shanghai Communiqu‚, out of U.S.-PRC normalization, why is this mutually 
beneficial situation now breaking down?  If everybody is doing so well, why do we have such 
unease about the future?  I think our presenters today have laid out the major factors. A major 
consideration is the end of the Cold War. The rationale of "the China card," as we came to call it, 
enabled us to push off the agenda our concerns with many Chinese activities that are now at the top 
of the agenda. The human rights issue is, of course, only one factor. U.S.-China trade has grown 
tremendously, and now we're concerned about the trade imbalance and Chinese trading practices. 
We are concerned about the impact on sensitive regions of Chinese arms sales abroad. And Taiwan 
wants to find some way to stabilize its autonomy and give greater legitimacy to its 
accomplishments.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Now, how can we fix the situation?  Is it possible to reestablish a 
set of political ground rules that will reactivate the pattern of interactions that have been so 
beneficial to all of the players in the China equation for the last quarter century?  I believe this can 
be done, but it requires an active U.S. leadership role. We have to help craft a framework for all the 
players, but without being too out-in-front on issues that are freighted with strong nationalistic and 
territorial qualities for all the Chinese parties involved.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Can we lead without being out in front?  As we see in President 
Clinton's cancellation of his November trip to APEC, our nation's leadership is preoccupied, for 
very good reasons, with domestic issues. It is difficult under normal circumstances to get our 
national leaders out to Asia. During my tenure at State, Secretary of State Baker spent only one 
night in Japan, as people will recall from criticism of that fact. Asia is a long way away, and our 
interests in the region compete in our political life with very complex domestic and international 
agendas, and to get Presidents, secretaries of state, and national security advisors out to the region is 
very difficult. I think President Clinton is due credit for elevating the yearly APEC meeting to the 
summit or heads-of-state level, but it is difficult to sustain a dialogue at that level. The question we 
face is whether we can focus our national attention on Asia, as we did over the summer because of 
all the tensions, in order to play the leadership role that we must play if we are to reset the political 
parameters on the sources of potential conflict in the region. To do so would serve our national 
interest in regional stability, but it's not easy to gain a claim on the attention of our national leaders 
in the absence of a crisis.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;If we don't do it, the passivity and drift in leadership that was 
induced after Tiananmen, the paralysis in our domestic politics about dealing with China, is likely 
to lead to initiatives by others who will force our hand and heighten tension as they pursue their 
own interests.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;One issue that was not mentioned this morning, but which should 
be seen as another source of potential trouble with the PRC, is the recession of Hong Kong to 
Chinese sovereignty in July 1997 -- something that is part of Beijing's 19th century agenda as it 
enters the 21st century. Hong Kong, as you know, was wrested from the Chinese by the British in 
the early part of the 19th century, and it will soon return to Chinese control. There is great concern 
and interest here about how that process unfolds. A set of basic agreements for Hong Kong's 
recession was negotiated in the 1980s between Beijing and London. Heritage has put out a good 
summary of U.S. interests as they will be affected by the transition in Hong Kong to PRC sovereign 
control. I personally am rather pessimistic that Beijing will handle that transition in a way that will 
provide confidence that it is abiding by its agreements with the British. My expectation is that the 
way Beijing handles Hong Kong as it takes over control will give Taiwan little comfort about how 
its interests will be dealt with in any reunification arrangement.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;How do we try to reset some ground rules for the United States, 
the PRC, and Taiwan relations if the Shanghai Communiqu‚ and the other parameters of the U.S.-
PRC relationship are no longer working well?  No one wants to play the role that General George 
Marshall played in 1945. One of the basic presumptions about U.S.-China policy that evolved after 
the failure of the Marshall mission to mediate the Chinese civil war back in 1945-1946 was that we 
don't want to get caught in the middle as these two parties deal with their differences. Taiwan is 
viewed by Beijing as an internal issue, and they are not interested in having us play the role of 
mediator. Yet what happens across the Taiwan Strait is of great concern to the United States. It 
affects our national interests in very important ways--and not just economically. Remember that 
East Asia was the site of our last three major wars.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Generally, we get into trouble, as we did in Korea in 1950, when 
we say we're not interested, when we don't pay attention. That leads others to say, "Well, if the 
Americans are not interested, then we'll pursue our own interests."  We have to lean forward, in my 
view, and indicate in more than just words that the peaceful resolution of these territorial and 
related issues is very much in the U.S. national interest.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Now what would be the objective of an American political 
initiative?  The core objective should be to make sure that the PRC-Taiwan situation does not 
become remilitarized. Beijing's missile tests and other military activities over the last six months or 
so have shown an inclination to remilitarize the Taiwan situation, which since the Shanghai 
Communiqu‚ Beijing has approached in a political framework. It is in our interest, and in Taiwan's, 
to see that Beijing handles the Taiwan issue in political terms.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Can it be done?  It seems pretty clear at the moment that the 
prospects for a successful negotiation across the Strait, which Beijing and Taipei have been 
pursuing for several years via the so-called Koo-Wong talks in Singapore, are not good. The 
question, I believe, is whether restraint will be shown on all sides, whether the deal that was struck 
between Kissinger and Chairman Mao will be sustained. In 1973, Mao told Kissinger that the 
United States and China had larger interests than a fight over Taiwan because of the Soviet 
challenge. "We don't need to resolve the Taiwan issue for a hundred years," said Mao. In effect, 
Mao was prepared to delay dealing with the issue far off into the future, as long as the United States 
supported the "one-China" principle, and to let circumstances evolve in ways that he would not be 
responsible for.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Today, no Chinese leader seems prepared to compromise the 
country's 19th century agenda. While Mao put the issue on the shelf, it stands like a bookend at the 
outer limit of the country's politics. Beijing's recent military pressures on Taiwan raise the question 
of whether China's contemporary leaders are preparing to take the Taiwan issue off the shelf and 
seek a solution to their goal of reunification in the near term. This is not a question they totally 
control, but my impression, based on recent high-level discussions in Beijing, is that PRC leaders -- 
even the military -- say their first priority today is economic development.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Now, of course, their hope is that over the next 10 or 20 years they 
will sustain growth at 10 percent a year and acquire the accouterments of modern national power, 
including military power, and on that basis be in a stronger position to assert their various territorial 
and political claims.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;But I believe today there is still common interest among all the 
parties involved to maintain stability and focus on economic growth. The challenge for the United 
States is to re-engage in a quiet way the various parties involved in this situation to reestablish 
political parameters which will sustain the mutually beneficial situation that persisted for the past 
quarter of a century. This will require considerable restraint on the part of both the PRC and 
Taiwan. In the case of Beijing, their handling of the Hong Kong transition will be a major mood-
setter for Taiwan and could substantially degrade attitudes in the United States about the extent to 
which Beijing will honor its international agreements. This situation also requires restraint on 
Taiwan's part about how it will handle the autonomy-independence issue. From my recent visit to 
Taipei, I have the impression that responsible people are thinking seriously about how to define that 
set of issues in ways that are not a provocation to the PRC. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In our own politics, since Tiananmen there has been a universal 
tendency to demonize the PRC. I would only note that our most recent ambassador to Beijing, 
Stapeleton Roy, says that much of the characterization of China in our domestic debate doesn't 
sound like the China that he lived in for four years. Having gone to China myself 25 or more times 
since the early 1970s, in terms of openness, social change, and economic transformation, what you 
see going on in that country is a set of developments which, if they are given sufficient time to play 
themselves out, are as likely to produce a China we can work with as they are a threatening China. 
But our tendency to demonize is very strong, and this may foreclose opportunities to deal 
constructively with Beijing.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Ultimately, the issue comes down to the Administration and 
presidential leadership. We have a capacity to engage all the players involved if it is done in the 
right way. But one of the foreign policy dilemmas we have in the post-Cold War world is that our 
domestic preoccupations make it very difficult for our national leaders to pay attention to loaded 
international issues that, if handled badly or allowed to drift, may well impose great costs on our 
country down the road.

<title>The Contract With America: Implementing New Ideas in the U.S. -- Heritage</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg">
<b>Heritage Lecture No. 549</b>
<h3>Heritage Foundation <a href="/heritage/dept_writeups/95lect.html">Lectures and 
Educational Programs</a></h3>

<h2>The Contract With America: 
Implementing New Ideas in the U.S.</h2>

By <a href="/heritage/staff/gaynerj.htm">Jeffrey B. Gayner</a><br>
[Jeffrey Gayner is a Senior Fellow at <a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation.</a>
 He spoke on October 12, 1995, at a conference in Athens, Greece, on "Beyond Statism: New 
Ideas." The conference was sponsored by the Athens-based Centre for Political Research and 
Information, a privately supported research institution that supports individualism and the free-
market economy.]
<p>

Decades from now, historians quite likely will reflect back upon the Contract With America as one 
of the most significant developments in the political history of the United States. As Newt 
Gingrich, the first Republican Speaker of the House of Representatives in 40 years, has written: 
"there is no comparable congressional document in our two-hundred-year history."
<p>
Never before had so detailed a document become such an integral part of a congressional election 
campaign; never had so many innovative ideas been drafted into legislation so quickly; and never in 
the previous six decades had so much legislation been passed by the House of Representatives in 
less than 100 days after the newly elected Members of Congress took office. As the chief political 
columnist for <i>The New York Times</i>, R. W. Apple, wrote in a front page news analysis: 
"Perhaps not since the start of the New Deal [in 1932], to which many of the programs now under 
attack can trace their origins, has Congress moved with such speed on so many fronts."
<p>
The revolutionary character of the change represented by the Contract went beyond the U.S. House 
of Representatives. Not only did the 367 Republican candidates for the House of Representatives 
who signed the document run election campaigns based on its provisions, but many of the 
campaigns for the U.S. Senate, as well as state and local government races, also pivoted around the 
fundamental questions concerning the role of government in society as reflected in the Contract. In 
short, the Contract may come to symbolize the most profound change in the American political 
landscape in the last half century and, in many respects, determine the character of American 
government well into the 21st century.
<p>
<b>The Contract and the Conservatives</b>
<p>
There has been a consistent growth of the role of the central government in the United States, or 
what you might call statism. This expansion of the government was never effectively challenged 
from the development of Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal beginning in 1933 until the 1960s. Only 
after the defeat of Richard Nixon in the presidential campaign of 1960 did conservatives in 
America begin to vigorously challenge the growth of the state; at that time, conservatives won 
control of the Republican Party. From this position, the conservatives developed fundamental 
criticisms of statist liberal policies which culminated in the nomination of Barry Goldwater for 
President in 1964. Although Senator Goldwater was badly defeated in that election, both the 
conservative ideals he championed and the cadre of workers he enlisted became the basis of the 
modern conservative political movement in the United States.
<p>
Fortuitously, Senator Goldwater remained active in American politics through his final re-election 
to the United States Senate in 1980, the same year the second great transformation of American 
politics took place with the election of Ronald Reagan as President. It was then that conservatives 
learned two lessons about the role of the Presidency. On the one hand, the President can have a 
profound international impact through his policies, as reflected in the winning of the Cold War and, 
later, the war in the Persian Gulf. On the other hand, in the most fundamental area of the size and 
scope of government activities, the President could lead, but a Congress controlled by the 
opposition did not have to follow. Thus, liberal Congressmen often effectively thwarted President 
Reagan's actions. As they often noted, the President is only in office for four or at most eight years, 
whereas Congressmen remained in office often for decades, as did the huge staff support system 
they developed. This "permanent staff" eventually reached over 20,000 personnel on Capitol Hill.
<p>
Thus, the third leg of the conservative revolution in post-World War II America is represented by 
the Contract With America and the election of a clear conservative majority in the U.S. House of 
Representatives. This can become the defining moment in the transformation of the responsibility 
for government in the United States away from the central government and back to state and local 
governments or to the private sector, to families and individuals.
<p>
The changes being debated in America now can provide useful lessons and insights to democratic 
societies throughout the world dealing with social and economic problems similar to those 
confronting the United States.
<p>
In many respects, the changes are already profound. The Contract With America led to much more 
than a change of parties in the United States, leading instead to fundamental philosophical 
questions being raised about government in ways not contemplated for 60 years.
<p>
Perhaps the best way to address various aspects of the Contract With America, the ideas in and 
behind the Contract and its relation to the size and scope of government activities, is to answer 
three basic questions:
<P><ul>
<li>Why was it done?
<li>How was it done?
<li>What has become of the Contract and the ideas it embodied?
</ul>
<p>

<b>Why was it done?</b>
<p>
Despite both the ascendancy of conservatives in the Republican Party and the election of Ronald 
Reagan as President, it became obvious that only a substantial change in the U.S. Congress could 
lead to the revolutionary transformation of America sought by conservatives for decades.
<p>
Many conservatives who came into Congress in the 1980 election and thereafter shared a much 
more dynamic vision of the role of conservatives in the Congress than did their predecessors. And 
among them, Congressman Gingrich consistently articulated his principal goal as the creation of a 
Republican majority in the House and the adoption of a very wide-ranging reform agenda.
<p>
In order to draw the attention of the public to the House of Representatives in the 1994 election, the 
Contract With America was created. The Contract provided the mechanism to move from vague 
political rhetoric to creating a specific political program. Through such a program, one could 
clearly delineate to the general public the contrasting philosophies of government the 1994 election 
offered the electorate.
<p>
The Contract's lineage can be traced back to the 1980 election campaign when most of the 
Republican candidates for federal office similarly stood on the steps of the Capitol in early October 
of that year and promised to support tax cuts, a strong national defense, and reductions in federal 
spending. While the Republicans gained 33 seats in the House that year, the Democrats nonetheless 
maintained their majority, and only the first two of three agenda items were initially adopted; but 
several years later, even the tax cuts and defense spending increases were abandoned. Federal 
spending continued out of control throughout the 1980s.
<p>
The ideas in the Contract emerged from extensive interaction between the new, more aggressive 
conservative Congressmen and the emergence of an extensive network of conservative think tanks, 
such as The Heritage Foundation. In 1980, Heritage and other conservative think tanks initially 
focused attention on changing the government through a change in the executive branch, as 
reflected in our monumental study <i>Mandate for Leadership</i>.
<p>
But after 1980, the attention of conservatives increasingly focused on the Congress. Heritage, for 
example, published a study in cooperation with the Claremont Institute in California on <a 
href="/townhall/townhall_shop/imp.html">The Imperial Congress: Crisis in the Separation of 
Powers</a>, which was published in 1988. Five years later, a successor study from Heritage came 
out entitled <a href="/townhall/townhall_shop/ruli.html">The Ruling Class: Inside the Imperial 
Congress</a>; 2.3 million copies of the later volume reached a wide audience. Both volumes drew 
attention to institutional problems within the Congress that were eventually addressed in the 
Contract With America.
<p>
And finally, Heritage developed a useful handbook, <a 
href="/townhall/townhall_shop/issu.html">Issues '94</a>, that provided specific legislative and 
policy recommendations for conservative candidates for Congress; many of these recommendations 
worked their way into detailed provisions of the Contract With America. In this manner, an 
extensive philosophical groundwork formed the intellectual foundation for the Contract With 
America when it formally appeared in the fall of 1994. Sound ideas thus became anchored into 
concrete policy recommendations.
<p>

<b>How was it done?</b>
<p>
The Contract itself emerged publicly with the staging of the mass signing of the Contract on the 
steps of the U.S. Capitol by 367 candidates for office on September 27, 1994. On that day, all of 
these candidates publicly pledged: "If we break this Contract, throw us out."  The Republicans who 
were already Members of the House of Representatives organized themselves into 11 working 
groups that eventually drafted ten bills that made up the Contract.
<p>
The items in the Contract were carefully selected in terms of issues that were of fundamental policy 
importance but also were "doable," that could be accomplished rather quickly because of the broad 
support they engendered. Extensive public opinion polling revealed that at least 60 percent of 
Americans supported all ten of the specific items in the Contract. By dealing initially with popular 
items, such as the Congress being governed by the same rules as all Americans, and broad 
philosophical concepts, such as balancing the federal budget, the Contract engendered popular 
momentum that could eventually lead to confronting more contentious issues, such as 
environmental regulations and Medicare and Medicaid reforms.
<p>
Politically, the Contract found a particularly receptive audience in the elections in the fall of 1994 
because of a combined disenchantment with the existing Congress and the widespread view of a 
lack of leadership being provided by President Bill Clinton in the White House. The Clinton 
campaign in 1992 had generated the expectation of great changes being made to deal with domestic 
problems. Moreover, the fact that Democrats in 1993 controlled both branches of the Congress 
together with the White House seemed to create the means for changes to take place by breaking 
the so-called partisan gridlock in Washington. But the failure to make substantive policy changes in 
1993 and 1994 clearly facilitated the political changes in November 1994. Thus, the concept of the 
Contract found a particularly receptive audience.
<p>
<b>What has become of the ideas embodied in the Contract?</b>
<P>
One of the revolutionary elements of the Contract is the fact that it actually was implemented as 
promised. Profound disillusionment within the American political system centered on the 
perception that politicians make promises only to be elected and then promptly abandon their 
pledges once safely ensconced in office. Thus, the first and most innovative idea reflected in the 
Contract required politicians to take their own promises seriously and actually implement them.
<p>
The idea of the first 100 days repeated, in a Republican Congress, what had been done by the most 
successful Democratic President in American history; in 1933, Franklin D. Roosevelt vigorously 
launched the New Deal in his first 100 days in office. The key difference between 1994 and 1932 
was that Republicans only controlled the Congress while a Democrat, President Clinton, still 
remained in the White House. This has clearly limited both the speed and scope of changes.
<p>
The ten items in the Contract were all acted upon in the first 100 days of the new Congress, which 
is what the signatories had pledged. Nine of the ten items in the Contract passed the House: Only 
the constitutional amendment on term limits (which required a two-thirds vote) was defeated. Out 
of a total of 302 roll call votes on issues related to the Contract With America, the conservatives 
prevailed on 299 of them. A balanced budget amendment passed in the House by a 300-123 margin 
but was subsequently defeated as it fell one vote short of the two-thirds needed for passage in the 
U.S. Senate. The overall margin by which the items in the Contract were passed averaged about 70 
percent despite the fact that the Republicans only held a 12-seat margin over the Democrats (52-48 
percent, the smallest House majority margin in 40 years). Given the notorious lack of party 
discipline in the American Congress, the passage by a large majority of nearly all of the items in the 
Contract was a remarkable achievement.
<p>
The ten specific bills which made up the Contract contained numerous provisions addressing a 
wide range of issues. Other elements of the Contract dealt with fundamental institutional political 
reforms. Outlined here are a few of these ideas and their status today.
<p>
<b>Institutional Reform: Making Congress More Democratic</b>
<p>
Most dramatically, the new Congress immediately implemented long-sought reforms within the 
House of Representatives. In this one area where the new Republican majority had full authority, 
they effectively exercised it by dramatically changing the nature of the House of Representatives 
itself during their first day in office; they passed nine major reforms.
<p>
First, they made all the laws that applied to the rest of the country apply to Congress itself; this 
indicated that Congressmen should be treated like other citizens and not remain a privileged elite, 
often immune from the consequences of the very laws they imposed on the rest of the country.
<P>
The House drastically cut by one-third the number of committees and similarly reduced committee 
staff personnel by one-third. In short, the lesson was that cutting back the size of government 
should begin in one's own House and thus establish a useful precedent for the rest of the federal 
government.
<p>
The House also provided for an independent audit of the finances of the House itself. This 
eventually led to a report by Price Waterhouse that found 2,200 instances of double payments for 
travel expenses, 700 retroactive pay hikes despite a rule against this, and, in general, accounting 
practices so out-of-date that the auditors could not be sure of the actual numbers they were working 
with.
<P>
Fundamental institutional change also arose in the Citizen Legislature Act provision of the Contract 
With America, which sought to limit the amount of time a Member of Congress could serve in one 
body to 12 years. This measure thus sought to limit the role of career politicians in Washington. But 
the measure required amending the Constitution and failed to achieve the two-thirds constitutional 
margin necessary. Term limits nonetheless remains a very popular issue, passed by many state 
legislatures; and Republicans promise that it will be the first item voted on if they retain control of 
the House after the 1996 elections.
<p>
<b>Controlling the Growth of Government: The Fiscal Responsibility Act</b>
<p>
A key ingredient, both explicit and implicit, in the Contract is a fundamental change in the 
character of government in the United States. The very first item in the Contract With America 
sought "to restore fiscal responsibility to an out-of-control Congress, requiring them to live under 
the same budget constraints as families and businesses."  The key components of this act were a 
line-item veto and balanced budget/tax limitation amendment. The line-item veto would allow the 
President to strike specific spending provisions in bills without having to veto the entire bill, and 
thus eliminate unnecessary spending. This provision passed both the House and Senate in slightly 
different forms, and President Clinton promises to sign it into law. On the other hand, the balanced 
budget amendment, which required a two-thirds vote to change the Constitution, was defeated. 
Even though not succeeding in passing the amendment itself, the House did pass a balanced budget 
resolution, which in the short term would have the same effect. Thus, the concept of balancing the 
budget has remained a central theme in the U.S. Congress; the means of achieving this could only 
come from a drastic reduction in the size and scope of the federal government.
<p>
The effort to eliminate unnecessary federal government programs has proven to be one of the 
biggest challenges facing the new Congress. Initial enthusiasm about eliminating unjustifiable 
federal programs, such as subsidies to the arts and humanities as well as public television and radio, 
generated fierce and well-organized opposition by the special-interest groups who benefit from the 
programs. Thus, instead of immediately eliminating them, the Congress only voted to phase them 
out over several years. What this means in Washington is that the battle is renewed each year.
<p>
The key lesson for anyone wanting to scale back the size of government is that it is best to 
eliminate a program immediately, as that engenders just as much opposition as reducing funding for 
a program. Only when a program is totally eliminated is the battle over that program won; in 
contrast, incremental reduction simply means revisiting the issue every year.
<p>
The example of the Reagan Presidency is instructive. Only 12 of 94 programs the Reagan 
Administration proposed to eliminate actually ended, and 10 of those were in Mr. Reagan's first 
term. Attempting to simply cut back programs ultimately failed. For example, the Small Business 
Administration (what we now call a welfare program for very few businesses) was cut back from 
$2 billion in 1980 to $85 million in 1989, but by the end of the Bush Administration in 1993, the 
program rose back to $975 million, and it is now once again a target of the new Congress.
<p>
Efforts to eliminate entire Cabinet-level departments of the government also have proved difficult. 
Conservatives have long sought to pursue a policy of "rollback" in dealing with proliferating 
government departments. The prime candidates on the list of government departments 
conservatives seek to eliminate are the Departments of Commerce, Education, Energy, and Housing 
and Urban Development. But at present, only the Commerce Department seems vulnerable. 
Another congressional initiative that has sought to consolidate the United States Information 
Agency, the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, and the Agency for International 
Development into the State Department prospectively would save $3 billion over the next four 
years. The combination of disenchantment with the size of the central government and growing 
budgetary constraints in Congress has created real momentum to seriously reduce the size and 
scope of central government activities in America.
<p>
<b>Welfare Reform: The Personal Responsibility Act</b>
<p>
One of the key ingredients in the initial Contract With America has led to one of the most 
contentious debates in Washington: reforming the welfare state. The Personal Responsibility Act in 
the Contract included prohibiting welfare going to mothers under the age of 18, halting the increase 
of benefits for mothers each time they had additional illegitimate children, and cutting welfare 
spending. In 1965, President Lyndon Johnson declared a so-called War on Poverty; but 30 years 
later, after spending an estimated $5.4 trillion on welfare programs, it seems that poverty is winning 
the war. Thirty years of central government welfare programs seem only to have worsened the 
situation. The key problem, as my colleague at The Heritage Foundation, Robert Rector, has 
pointed out, is that "the welfare programs present a 'moral hazard' -- a strong tendency to increase 
the behaviors which are rewarded by welfare benefits."  Specifically, "when welfare benefits are 
tied, directly or indirectly, to such behaviors as low work effort, divorce, and illegitimacy, welfare 
strongly promotes an increase in those behaviors."  This only creates an ever-escalating cycle of 
more spending.
<p>
The Personal Responsibility Act of the Contract sought to fundamentally revamp the role of the 
state in welfare policy by developing policies to reduce teenage pregnancies and illegitimate births 
by prohibiting aid to mothers under 18 who give birth out of wedlock and requiring them to name 
the fathers of their children, who would be held accountable for their actions. Such women would 
be required to live at home to receive any aid and would not get housing subsidies to set up their 
own apartments. The Act also required that aid be cut off if recipients did not work.
<p>
The federal government provides 72 percent ($234.3 billion) of all welfare benefits, compared to 28 
percent ($90 billion) by the states. This has led the Congress to set certain general standards and 
criteria that recipients of aid must meet to receive benefits. But beyond some general restrictions, 
the key reform of welfare consists of attempting to decentralize the program to the 50 states and 
thereby stimulate numerous creative approaches to dealing with social problems.
<p>
This reflected the general conservative philosophical view in the Contract. As Speaker Gingrich 
writes in his book <i>To Renew America</i>: "We must replace our centralized, micro-managed, 
Washington-based bureaucracy with a dramatically decentralized system more appropriate to a 
continent-wide country... 'Closer is better' would be the rule of thumb for our decision making; less 
power in Washington and more back home, our consistent theme."
<p>
<b>Unleashing the American Economy: The Job Creation and Wage Enhancement Act</b>
<p>
This Act attempted to reverse the increasingly debilitating role of the federal government in the 
American economy. One of its major provisions that has passed both the House and Senate ended 
so-called unfunded mandates which require states and local communities to impose various 
regulations but do not provide them the money to carry them out. In this manner, Congress passed 
allegedly beneficial laws that were cost-free, at least to the federal government. But such laws had 
enormous destructive power on states, local communities, and businesses. It was estimated by the 
Congressional Budget Office that such regulations cost state and local government from $8.9 
billion to $12.7 billion between 1983 and 1990 and that the costs were growing. Similarly, the 
federal government often imposed costly regulations on businesses that stifled economic expansion 
by companies.
<p>
The Job Creation and Wage Enhancement Act included a variety of tax law changes and reforms in 
federal bureaucratic procedures that would enhance private property rights and economic liberty. 
Specifically, it provided for a 50 percent capital gains rate cut, allowed small businesses to deduct 
the first $25,000 worth of investment each year, reduced paperwork burdens on business by at least 
five percent, and required federal agencies to assess the risks and cost of each new regulation being 
imposed. Finally, the Contract provided for a Citizens Bill of Rights for anyone subject to 
investigation or inspection by a federal agency.
<p>
<b>Non-statist Approaches to Social Problems: The Family Reinforcement Act</b>
<p>

This Act similarly sought to refocus attention on the family and away from the government as the 
source of solutions to social problems. Thus, the Act reinforced child support orders issued by 
courts requiring absent fathers to financially support their children and provided both a refundable 
tax credit of up to $5,000 for families adopting a child and another tax credit of $500 for families 
caring for a dependent elderly parent or grandparent. Rather than emphasize institutionally provided 
state care, this Act sought to get orphaned children into homes and encourage family care of 
relatives. Similarly, another element of the tax provisions of the Contract provided a $500-per-child 
tax credit, which would mean that a family of four earning $28,000 would have their tax burden cut 
by one-third.
<p>
Other provisions provided incentives for saving money to be used for college education or buying a 
home and for ending a tax benefit for couples who live together but do not get married. For 
example, a couple earning $40,000 each will pay only $6,633 each in taxes if filing returns 
separately; but on a joint return, their combined taxes will rise by $1,285 to $14,541, or about a 10 
percent tax penalty for being legally married.
<p>
These proposals, as well as others, rested upon a fundamental philosophical principle, as stated in 
the book version of the Contract With America: "The American family is at the very heart of our 
society.... After forty years of putting others first [we] will put families first.... It is through the 
family that we learn values like responsibility, morality, commitment and faith." 
<p>
<b>Other Items in the Contract</b>
<p>
The remaining items in the Contract deal less with the role and nature of the state than with 
confronting specific legal and security issues. This includes dealing with the growing threat of 
crime in America, reforming the legal system, and improving the security of the country. They 
reflect the broad scope of the Contract but go beyond the scope of this lecture.
<p>
<b>Conclusion</b>
<p>
The ideas espoused in the Contract With America represented the culmination of 30 years of 
creative conservative thinking dealing with the basic social and economic problems of modern 
America. The ideas provided the background for the widest range of legislative initiatives, certainly 
since the 1930s, and possibly at any time in American political history. The fundamental principle 
involves re-examining the role of the government in society.
<p>
Central government attempts to solve many problems have only made them worse; thus, the 
Contract With America represents specific practical steps that can be taken in a wide range of 
government activities to roll them back. Ultimately, the government should cease many of its 
activities; but what is necessary now is a realistic transitional mechanism to achieve that goal. The 
Contract With America provides precisely the kind of formula that can accomplish that objective.

<title>Lessons on Reforming Health Care at the State Level -- Heritage</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg">
<b>Heritage Lecture No. 548</b><br>
<h3>Heritage Foundation <a href="/heritage/dept_writeups/95lect.html">Lectures and 
Educational Programs</a></h3>

<h2>Lessons on Reforming Health Care At the State Level: 
Massachusetts, Minnesota, And Washington State</h2> 
A Physicians Council Symposium<br>
June 13, 1995<br>


<a href="/heritage/staff/moffit.htm">DR. ROBERT E. MOFFIT</a>, Deputy Director of 
Domestic Policy Studies, The Heritage Foundation: With last year's collapse of President Clinton's 
huge health plan, we have seen throughout the country a growth in policy experimentation at the 
state level. But the striking feature about most of these state-based reforms is that, in many 
instances -- such as Washington, Tennessee, Minnesota, and Kentucky -- the health care reform 
proposals resemble, in crucial respects, the discredited Clinton health care plan.
Like the Clinton plan, these systems concentrate key decisionmaking power in the hands of 
government officials. The health care system is to be governed by a central board or commission 
that issues rules and regulations and guidelines for the system. Almost all of them have a 
comprehensive, government-standardized benefits package specifying in some detail the treatments 
or procedures that must be available to citizens. Most establish government-sponsored health care 
cooperatives, or regional alliances at the state levels, or managed care networks. Most include 
employer mandates and a system of price controls.
<p>
But state reformers have painfully discovered that, in many respects, reform at the state level is 
subject to the same explosive politics as reform at the national level. The politics of health care 
reform is like the politics of a Rubik's cube. It is an excruciating exercise in frustration: You fix one 
thing only to find that you are breaking another.
<p>
Talking about reform of health care at the state level, we have three distinguished panelists.
<p>
<a href="#mass">Charles Baker</a> comes to us from the state of Massachusetts. He was 
appointed Secretary of Administration and Finance by Governor William Weld in November of 
1994. Mr. Baker directs the preparation of the Governor's budget proposals in Massachusetts and 
serves as the Governor's chief advisor on fiscal matters. Prior to assuming that role, he was 
Undersecretary of Health in the Executive Office of Health and Human Services. As 
Undersecretary, he managed six health agencies and was responsible for the reform of the hospital 
finance system.
<p>
The second of our panelists is <a href="#minn">Dr. Ken Heithoff</a>. Dr. Heithoff is Chairman 
of the CDI Management Corporation and Medical Director of the Center for Diagnostic Imaging in 
Minneapolis, Minnesota, a physician-owned company. He is a member of the Hammond County 
Medical Society, the Minnesota Medical Association, and the American College of Radiology. 
Very active in market-based health care reform in Minnesota, he served as an advisor to 
Congressman Jim Ramstad and Senator Rod Grams, the new Senator for Minnesota. Dr. Heithoff is 
the Chairman of the Minnesota Independent Republican Health Care Task Force, which has been 
meeting regularly since April of 1994.
<p>
<a href="#wash">Phil Dyer</a> is the state representative of the fifth district in Washington 
State. Representative Dyer serves on the Health Care Committee of the Washington State House. 
He has a B.S. from Oregon State University. He also is a graduate of the Army Corps of Engineers, 
serving as a member of the Command General Staff College. Representative Dyer received a public 
service award from the National Federation of Independent Business. He was the leading opponent 
of Washington State's Clinton-style health care plan.
<p>
<a name="mass"></a>
<b>MASSACHUSETTS</b>
<p>
CHARLES BAKER: The most important thing about state-level health care reform is to remember 
the old Clint Eastwood saying about knowing your limitations. I agree with The Heritage 
Foundation and with Dr. Kevin Vigilante and others that the major genetic error in the current 
structure of the existing health care system is the federal tax code. And because that's the major, 
fundamental structural problem, it has created a corporate relationship between health plans and 
provider systems as opposed to an individual relationship between patients and doctors.
<p>
Therefore, I was never that interested, at the state level, in pursuing anything as broad and as 
comprehensive as Minnesota Care, or Tenn Care, or Washington State Care, or whatever else you 
call them. But we did have some things to deal with when Governor Weld took office in 1991. Our 
Medicaid program had been growing 22 percent a year for the previous three or four years and was 
basically "PacMan-ing" its way through the rest of the state budget. At the same time, you had an 
angry beneficiary community, an angry provider community, an angry physician community -- 
everybody was angry, but the thing was hemorrhaging money at the same time.
<p>
We also had probably the most regulated hospital finance system in the United States, second only 
to perhaps Maryland or New York. Hospital prices were still growing 10 and 11 percent a year. 
Health care costs generally were growing about 16 percent a year. 
<p>
The standard response from a lot of the folks in the political establishment was, "Well, obviously 
the regulatory model isn't being implemented hard enough."  This was directly opposed to my point 
of view, which was that the state's regulatory model was creating the perverse incentives that were 
driving the rate of spending and making everybody so cranky about what they were getting on the 
service delivery end at the same time.
<p>
<b>Deregulation.</b> So we pursued a fairly aggressive strategy on two fronts. The first was to 
disencumber the provider system from the existing regulatory mass. We managed to pass 
legislation that was signed by the Governor in the fall of 1991 that basically deregulated, on 
January 1, 1992, the entire hospital financing system. Among the naysayers, the sense at the time 
was that this was going to ruin the tight rules that had done such a good job of controlling spending 
in Massachusetts. 
<p>
The good news is that health care spending in Massachusetts in fiscal 1994, the last year for which 
we have final year data, was actually up a little less than two or three percent, and hospital spending 
was actually down a little bit. And the hospital industry overall was in pretty good financial shape. 
This was the exact opposite of what the liberals had said was going to occur. Instead, we took the 
lid off on the pricing, and a very funny thing happened: The market worked. This, of course, didn't 
come as a big surprise to me, but I think it came as a big surprise to lots of other people.
<p>
<b>Medicaid.</b> The second was to improve Medicaid. We started with two assumptions. First, 
that markets were good. Second, that doctors were good. A big part of the political problem that we 
had in Massachusetts was that nobody trusted anybody. In 1988, the head of the Massachusetts 
Medical Society went to the national annual meeting of the AMA and referred to Massachusetts as 
the Beirut of medicine. Early on, I made it a point to make sure that we had doctors involved in 
practically all of our major health care initiatives -- and I mean practicing doctors, not unpracticing 
doctors -- because I believed that they would have a lot of very positive and useful and helpful 
insights into how you could go about doing something to fix a very broken Medicaid program.
<p>
We ended up implementing what I think remains today the largest and perhaps the only statewide 
managed care initiative for Medicaid recipients in the United States. It's got almost 650,000 folks 
enrolled, and it's really two programs. We have a traditional HMO program, but that only serves 
about 100,000 folks. That is the straight plan -- a capitated payment arrangement. But the vast 
majority of the recipients that we serve are served through a primary care program managed by 
about 3,000 doctors. 
<p>
One of the things we decided not to do was to compel physicians to participate in this program. 
Rather, we proposed to raise their fee structure, believing that if we raised their fee structure, they 
would be more likely to serve Medicaid recipients. We thought one of the problems we had with 
the old system was that its fee structure was so bad, and its rules were so bad, that a lot of folks who 
otherwise would have been served by doctors were going to hospitals. This was the most expensive 
and, in many cases, the most inappropriate place for them to get served.
<p>
The other thing we learned was that, despite the statewide availability of plenty of good physicians, 
we had unbelievably high utilization of the Boston teaching hospitals as a source for primary care -- 
totally disproportionate to the population it represented -- for our Medicaid population. So we got 
very aggressive about working with the medical societies and some of the other major physician 
groups to try to create a new relationship between the physician community and the Medicaid 
program. 
<p>
One objective was to get care out of Boston and to hospitals in other parts of the state, and to try to 
develop real relationships out in the hinterlands to serve this population. As a result, there has been 
a dramatic decline in the use of teaching hospitals as sources of primary care for Medicaid 
beneficiaries. As you might suspect, this has been good for patient care, good for local physician-
patient relationships, and good for us. We saved a lot of money by giving people a local and more 
appropriate source for primary and preventive and specialty health care.
<p>
The other interesting thing that we did -- based on advice we got from people on the plan side and 
from the physician community -- was hire an independent company to help us help Medicaid 
beneficiaries make decisions about who they wanted to have do their primary care for them, and to 
help solve what I would refer to as the doctor/program conflict.
<p>
There was never anybody they could call, except some 1-800 number in Boston, to get an answer 
about some problem they were having with the Medicaid program. So one of the things we did was 
contract with a private entity to set up a field-based intermediary that could help solve, at the local 
level, physician problems and recipient problems with the Medicaid program. As a result, I think 
we were able to level the playing field and take some of the marketing and enrollment techniques 
that have dominated a lot of the public payer programs on the plan side out of the loop, and we 
created a truly level playing field. We also gave physicians a place to go to get their questions 
answered.
<P>
We now have over 3,000 doctors enrolled in the primary care program. For the most part, we 
survey them, and we have a standing advisory committee that works on particular issues. It has 
been very successful. For example, we discovered we had a big problem with hospitalization for 
pediatric asthma -- just off-the-chart numbers. It didn't make any sense. The standard way to deal 
with that would be to assume that it's bad medicine and that somehow it's the doctors' fault.
<p>
What we did instead was ask our advisory group to start talking to some of the doctors who dealt 
with significant numbers of Medicaid patients to find out why this was happening. We learned 
three things. Most physicians didn't know that nebulizers were covered under the Medicaid 
program. The two primary drugs that you would prescribe to serve kids who had asthma problems 
were on a prior approval list that was a colossal pain in the neck for a physician to get approved, 
and, as a result, they weren't prescribing them. And we found we had done a lousy job of helping 
the physician community understand what kinds of services and medications were covered under 
the Medicaid program.
<p>
So, again, working with some of the professional societies, we went through a major education 
campaign. We took all of the asthma drugs off the prior approval list, made sure people knew that 
nebulizers were indeed part of the program, and used the medical society as our primary outlet for 
information. Information from those of us in the government always ends up reading like 
bureaucratic prose, whereas if it comes from medical groups, it can be translated into a language 
that doctors participating in the program understand.
<p>
The end result has been a gradual decline in pediatric asthma admissions, which -- as the father of a 
four-year-old who has asthma and spends a lot of time with that kid on the nebulizer -- is a big win. 
It's a big win for physicians who want to do the right thing on behalf of their patients, it's a big win 
for the state in terms of cost-effective service delivery, and it's a big win for families who don't like 
to have to sleep on the chair next to the hospital bed for two or three nights while their kid's sitting 
there breathing so hard that every fiber of his being is concentrating on just making sure he gets his 
next puff of air.
<p>
<b>Treating AIDS.</b> The other thing we've done that has been kind of interesting in this area 
is take some of our most difficult populations -- end stage AIDS sufferers, for example -- and ask 
physician groups if they would be willing to capitate to serve these populations. The argument is 
simple: Medicaid is a very narrowly defined program under federal rules, and there are many things 
you can do for AIDS patients that make a very big difference in terms of dignity, quality of life, and 
cost effectiveness that aren't covered under the existing fee-for-service program.
<p>
So, we said to some of the group practices that dealt with a lot of HIV patients, "Look, we'll 
capitate you, and we'll establish some risk relationships so you're not wildly exposed out there, and 
we'll try to sell it to the federal government. The idea here will be that you'll be able to spend your 
capitation on whatever you think the patient needs, which in many cases is not traditional but is 
appropriate for somebody in those circumstances, both from a cost-effectiveness point of view and 
a quality of life point of view. We think this will be good for you. It will get us out of your hair on 
prior approval, we will refrain from looking over your shoulder, and you'll have a lot more 
flexibility about how you treat them. It will be good for us because it will give you an opportunity 
to expand your horizon in terms of how you take care of them, and if we can do it at a rate that 
looks as good, or better, than our fee-for-service average participant, then we win, too."
<p>
But, of course, we had to run it by Washington. It took us a year and a half to get the federal 
government to agree to let us do this, despite the fact that they were going to save money on their 
Medicaid program, because they paid for 50 percent of it. But the results have been astounding. 
Hospitalization, for example, for these folks has been driven practically to zero, and doctors have 
been using all kinds of interventions and service delivery techniques that are very nontraditional to 
improve the way they take care of these patients. It also has moved the knowledge base a light year 
as a result. 
<P>
What was required to make this work was a lot more flexibility on our part about how the physician 
treated the patient. People say, "Well, you can't make capitation work because the population is too 
sick," but people say this about the Medicare population, the over-65s. The best capitated program 
we've put in place is taking care of the end stage AIDs patient. You can't get much sicker than that 
population, and it has turned out to be, in many ways, a big improvement over what we did 
previously.
<p>
And, you know, our Medicaid growth rate this year is less than 2 percent. Our case load adjusted 
growth rate has seen negative numbers for three years now. We have a provider community that's a 
lot happier with what we are doing now than they were with the system before. The client 
community also is a lot happier. But most of it is really a function of giving people, at the level 
where the decisions needed to be made, more authority to make decisions and turning some of the 
incentives around. I believe you can do the same thing with Medicare. 
<p>
<b>Implications for Medicare.</b> When people say the way to fix Medicare is to cut the fees, 
they are missing the point. The way to fix Medicare is to create a system with the right set of 
incentives for both the provider and the patient to do the right thing. More often than not, doing the 
right thing is the cheapest and most cost-effective way to solve a problem. It also assures the 
highest quality.
<p>
I really hope this Medicare debate does not become fear mongering and scare tactics, because there 
is a much larger issue at stake here. The physician-patient relationship is part of it, but more 
importantly, at least from my point of view as a dad, we have to balance the federal budget for our 
children and we have to do it soon. Otherwise we are just ruining the lives of our children and our 
grandchildren and setting up an impossible dynamic for them. It will be impossible for them to 
grow and be successful in this country while carrying this huge debt and its growing interest 
payments.
<p>
<b>Federal Deficits.</b> The final point I'd like to make is also the most important: Medicare has 
to be part of the discussion about the federal budget deficit, as does Medicaid. You simply can't 
balance the federal budget unless you take an honest look at these two programs. As a real deficit 
hawk, whose four-year-old and one-year-old sons are already inheriting four-and-a-half trillion 
dollars worth of federal debt, I'm ashamed that we have let this happen. I've been saying this to all 
the folks that come see me as the chief financial person in the state and whine about this cut and 
that cut. I don't care whose ox gets gored here. I want to see a federal budget that is balanced at 
some point in the next ten years, because I'm jeopardizing the lives and well-being of my children 
by not being willing to bite the bullet on this one.
<P>
The important role that you and Heritage and others can play in this discussion is to drive home the 
core message that balancing the federal budget is something this country has to do. And you can't 
do it by raising taxes. Why?  Because it's a spending problem. It's not a revenue problem.

<b>MINNESOTA</b>
<p>
<b>DR. KEN HEITHOFF</b>: I happen to agree with Bob Moffit's statement that you can't really 
achieve much fundamental reform at the state level, and that's the quandary. Representative Dyer 
has been there, and he's back from the trip. And in Minnesota, we're pretty much back.
We had a Clinton-style plan, just as Washington State did. Let me describe for you the chronology 
of Minnesota Care and how it evolved. When Surgeon General Everett Koop was there in 1992, he 
looked at Minnesota's health care system, which had been rated as one or two in the country in 
terms of quality. He said, "This system doesn't seem to be broken. Why fix it?" 
<p>
It was a political and economic phenomenon. We had a recession. There were a lot of white collar 
workers out of jobs, and the first thing that they were going to lose, because we had an employer-
based system, was their health care benefits. Liberal politicians came back from their little political 
sojourn into the rural countryside in Minnesota and decided that they needed to fix the state's health 
care system.
<p>
They had some very capable help. Although Representative Dyer in Washington and I have been 
there and are on our way back, some of you are going to begin this journey. The template for the 
Clinton-style state-based reform is going to be the same. Whether it's Minnesota or Washington or 
Tennessee or Kentucky, they will all look the same. They all have the same structure, and they all 
follow the same political agenda.
<P>
Nevertheless, after two years of this in Minnesota, I don't think there are any bad people. As 
physicians we need to stop feeling sorry for ourselves; nobody else is going to. Regardless of the 
reality, we are seen as a privileged, wealthy class. That's not the reality for a lot of our primary care 
practitioners, but nobody is going to listen to you.
<p>
I used to sit and carp about this in the doctors' lounge. I used to be very angry about it. I'm not 
angry any more. The reason: A lot of our state-based reformers simply have a different philosophy. 
It's not about health care. There isn't a damned thing that you can do, sitting in your office, to 
practice better medicine that will change how this thing turns out.
<p>
First of all, physicians have to understand that it's about economics, and it's about power. We have 
been villainized by the media and by the politicians during the past two or three or four years for a 
very specific purpose. It is not because they think we're bad people, but they have to break the bond 
of trust between physicians and their patients in order to have the kind of government disruption of 
the medical delivery service that they have been attempting. So forget all of the things that you hear 
and read in the papers. Maybe stop reading the papers for a while. Have faith in free-market 
principles, because they're extremely powerful and they do work.
<p>
I am convinced that we are at the low point. Five years from now, we will have a hard time 
recognizing the kind of fear and trepidation that we have experienced in recent years. The classic 
managed care and HMO philosophies will become pass‚ because personally managed care -- I 
think Speaker Newt Gingrich coined that term -- is a much more powerful concept than managed 
care. "Managed care" is a misnomer. It should be called "restrictive care."
<p>
In Minnesota, we started, I think, between 1985 and 1987. Some of our legislators teamed up with 
the Children's Defense Fund. The debate always starts with access, because you can't really get 
people too excited about cost, at least at first. But the debate quickly shifts to costs. Quite frankly, 
this is the fruit of a dysfunctional third-party employer-based system of finance which has become 
unaffordable for employers.
<p>
<b>The Role of Business.</b> I don't happen to share the view that the employers are necessarily 
physicians' enemies. They now understand that they are going to be taken care of by the same 
system. CEOs in our state have come face to face with the Minnesota health care delivery system. 
The legislation collapsed the insurance market into three oligopolies, where 80 percent of our 
insurance products are delivered by three highly integrated, vertically integrated systems. The 
Business Health Care Action Group was instrumental in proposing that health care be delivered in 
that way. But after playing with the "reformers" for two years, they got very frightened by what 
happened. Why?  Because under Minnesota Care, fee for service would be destroyed, but it would 
be replaced by a tightly managed care delivery system. Care would be delivered through integrated 
service networks, and those integrated service networks, by definition, included physicians, 
hospitals, and an insurance company.
<p>
There were only a few people that could play in such a marketplace, and it was, in fact, promoted 
by this Business Health Care Action Group. They put out a request for proposal which could only 
be answered by such a very, very strongly integrated service network. But after two years of 
working with that, and seeing the competitive market collapse, they became very frightened. About 
a month to six weeks ago, they did a 180 degree about-face. They have announced their intention to 
contract directly with competing physician groups rather than obtain coverage through health plans. 
They are all self-insured employers. This is a watershed event, not just for Minnesota, but for the 
nation as a whole. 
<p>
The business leaders have gone to the health plans, the health plan not being an arrangement 
between the physician and the patients, and have said, "You know, we're really sick and tired of 
paying you guys millions of dollars and having all the recipients [the doctors] be upset about it."  
Who is upset?  The providers, the patients, and even the employers. The people who are buying the 
plans are not the people who are receiving the care. 
<p>
So now they are saying, "We want to contract directly with the physician organizations for our 
health care. We want to put the health plan outside of the physician-patient relationship, not 
between it."  The health plans have become huge oligopolies; we have a $2.2 billion organization 
which used to be our physicians' health plan -- it became United Health Care when the state 
government declared that physicians couldn't own it. United Health Care now has $2.6 billion of 
cash. Our Physicians Health Plan, which became Medica, merged with 27 hospitals into a $2.2 
billion structure called Allina, and now they're buying out the physicians that started Physicians 
Health Plan.
<P>
We have about five physician-directed organizations in Minnesota, independent physicians who 
have gathered together as an alternative, to practice and to try to stay independent rather than be 
enrolled in integrated service networks. 
<p>
<b>The Political Process.</b> Although they wanted to go to a single-payer system like the 
Canadian system -- the people who began this process were all still single-payer advocates -- there 
were a few people who understood that the single-payer option wasn't politically palatable. They 
tried it in 1991. It was vetoed by the Republican Governor, Arne Carleson.
<P>
Because the Republicans were convinced that the Governor's veto would be overridden and we 
would have a single-payer system in 1991, the Republicans in the legislature had to sit down with 
the Democrats and the Governor. We thus had a situation where both political parties and the 
Governor favored Minnesota Care, even though the people who started that process and who ran 
Minnesota Care from the beginning were dyed-in-the-wool, absolute advocates of the single-payer 
system. They pushed Minnesota Care in that direction, using emotional appeals and saying 
anything but what they were really after. Both political parties in the state went along.
<p>
Minnesota Care became a very tightly regulated, centrally controlled, Clinton-type plan instead of 
the free-market approach it was supposed to be, and which the Governor continued to say it was. It 
wasn't until 1994, when the Governor and the people in the Republican caucuses began to be very 
skeptical of where this was going, that the Governor reversed course and wrote an open letter to 
Minnesotans expressing concern over the direction of Minnesota Care. 
<p>
Minnesota Care was an incremental bill. It started in 1992, but it wasn't to be fully implemented 
until 1997. It set up a series of stepping stones along the way. The Governor signed the bill, but in 
the open letter to the people of Minnesota in 1994, he raised some very significant questions. At the 
same time, I had been working with Representative Jim Ramstad, and I had also obtained 
considerable material from The Heritage Foundation, which was really pushing for free-market 
health reform. Senior Republicans came to me and said, "Put your money where your mouth is. If 
you really want to pursue a free-market approach, if you want to have something, let's start a health 
care task force. But it has to be self-funding."
<p>
We started with an initial funding of about $18,000 and took a multidisciplinary approach to health 
care reform. The idea was to educate the legislators because it was appalling to me that after two 
years of this national and state debate, when you would think that all the legislators would be 
unequivocally informed about health care, the fact was that most of them were not. Everybody told 
them that health care was too difficult to understand. For most people, that was a convenient excuse 
for not putting forth the effort to become informed, and they really didn't understand it.
<p>
We held field hearings. We went to regional briefings for all the candidates before the election. We 
sat down with all the incumbents. We sat down with all of the new prospective candidates. We used 
Heritage Foundation materials extensively, explaining the relationship between the health insurance 
markets, tax policies, and the health care "crisis."
<P>
Initially, we couldn't talk about Minnesota Care because it was supported by the Republican Party 
leadership. We started with an anti-single-payer slant, or an anti-Clinton slant. But it was quite 
interesting that, when we talked specifically about what was bad about the Clinton health care plan, 
they had been around Minnesota Care long enough to know they were similar in many respects.
<p>
We formed a legislative subcommittee which drafted an alternative bill. I would invite you to look 
into this educational process, because it's wonderful to be inside the process and not a special-
interest lobbyist on the outside, not a physician who's complaining about something or looking for 
something. If you are promoting solid information -- which is a good policy for all, not just 
providers -- they come to trust you. The information that you're giving is something that is good for 
them and that is good for their constituents.
<p>
As a result, we drafted a bill, an alternative to Minnesota Care, which was the first time that this 
had even been contemplated. The Governor did not openly support the process. But then came the 
1994 election. We had two of the old guard of the Minnesota Republican Party who decided they 
would not run for re-election, and it gave us a chance for new blood and new leadership. The end 
result was that we proposed the bill and crafted a bill with providers, with the physicians and 
patients, with insurance people, with nurses, chiropractors, and dentists. Everybody got involved.
<p>
At the same time, we got involved in politics. We had 3,000 members. We had 800 major 
contributors, and we raised $86,000. We participated in probably six major campaigns. We worked 
closely with Rod Grams in his successful Senate bid. I personally wrote a letter to 14,000 health 
care providers in Minnesota about two weeks before the election, and a lot of those people 
contributed individually.
<p>
In the meantime, our task force crafted a reform bill. Because it had business input, and because it 
had insurance industry input, as well as provider and consumer input, it was well crafted and 
economically sound. Even though we were still in the minority in Minnesota, we came within two 
votes of passage. We weren't as successful as our colleagues in Washington State, but we came 
within two votes of having our bill supersede Minnesota Care. In the process, because our 
legislators not only were convinced of the correctness of the free-market approach, but also really 
understood it, they talked across the aisles with their Democrat colleagues, and we, in fact, had 
pretty close to a working bipartisan majority. 
<p>
We got the head of the Senate Finance Committee -- a Democrat and probably the most respected 
legislator on both sides of the aisle -- to cosponsor our health reform bill. And because our 
legislators understood the issues, and they were passionate about free-market health care reform, we 
amended the Minnesota Care bill that came out of committee. We slowed and, in some cases, 
repealed some of the more onerous parts of Minnesota Care.
<p>
In the 1994 election, 13 seats were added to the conservative Republican side. Conservatives won 
all five special elections. The Governor is going to be appointing a couple of Democrats to 
positions in the state bureaucracy. We're going to win those special elections, so I think we're going 
to have a clear majority or a working conservative majority in our House, and we're very close in 
the Senate.
<p>
It is remarkable what we have accomplished and how much fun it has been, for somebody who was 
totally out of politics or the policy process before this, to be part of this effort. I had never chaired 
anything like this before. I tried to shy away from it, but I saw my ideas begin to have effect, and 
we continued to show gains and gather momentum. It also would not have been possible if we had 
not been supplied an executive director. The chairman of the Republican Party gave us a 
remarkable young woman who had worked in Congressman Bob Michel's office. She knew the 
political arena. She knew who was important at meetings and how to approach them -- what we 
could and could not say. I got the credit for being the chair, but she was responsible for the success 
that we had in terms of setting up the meetings, the agenda, and providing continuity and vital 
advice and contacts. 
<p>
In terms of education, <a href="/heritage/staff/liu.htm">John Liu</a> and <a 
href="/heritage/staff/moffit">Bob Moffit</a> of The Heritage Foundation came out and did a 
remarkable job for us, along with Molly Bordonaro from the American Legislative Exchange 
Council. The education of legislators was (and continues to be) the most important function we 
perform. We are back, and what we did not get this year, we will get next year. We repealed price 
controls on providers. We put off the mandated universal coverage that was supposed to go into 
effect in 1997. We put that off indefinitely. We also changed the universal defined benefit plan and 
repealed the regulated all-payer system. This was supposed to be left for us independent 
practitioners. It was a highly regulated, impossible situation. Only now are people beginning to 
admit that it was never intended to be implemented but proposed to frightened independent 
physicians to persuade them to voluntarily become employees of the large integrated service 
networks.
<p>
We have come back -- not as far as Washington State, but we are on our way. What are the lessons? 
 First, you should trust free-market principles. They will work. What has been unleashed in this 
debate are the free-market ideas: medical savings accounts, personally managed care, voucher 
systems, and so forth. That is so compelling to me. I have no fear that we independent practitioners 
will continue to exist and that private medical practice will see a real comeback. But we have to do 
nationally what we've done in Minnesota: form larger organizations of independent physicians.
<p>
We have 1,300 physicians in five physician-directed organizations. I sat on two of their boards, and 
it was heart-breaking for me to see these proud professionals go hat in hand to the three large health 
plans, essentially begging for some insurance product that the PDOs -- physician directed 
organizations -- could offer through the health plan. I knew it wasn't going to happen because it was 
not in the interest of the health plans to do so. They don't want us to succeed; they want physicians 
subjugated to their bureaucracies.
<p>
We have been meeting to try to put together a physician-directed organization where all five would 
come together and offer an insurance product. One of the ideas was that physicians and their 
families and their employees -- all 12,000 of us -- would offer a medical savings account (MSA) 
and demonstrate to the employers in our market that we could, in fact, drive down the cost of 
medicine by 30 or 40 percent with an open access, consumer-friendly plan -- to use our own 
practices as a beta test site.
<P>
We are looking at other options. I don't think we can out-HMO the big corporate players, but if we 
come to the market with some very creative alternatives, such as MSAs and managed care in its 
best sense -- best practices, best practitioners, and so forth -- we can succeed.
<p>
Given my recent experience, and the successful momentum generated by a relatively small group of 
dedicated individuals, I have little sympathy for people in the medical profession who say that they 
do not have the time and money to become involved in the political process. I've seen the 
chiropractors do a lot more with a lot less money and a lot more contributions. They were very 
helpful in getting bipartisan support. They also bought into the idea of medical savings accounts 
and wrote a letter of support.
<p>
We have to educate ourselves. Most physicians haven't heard about The Heritage Foundation. I 
think that's a problem. They don't understand that health care reform is not about how they practice 
medicine, but about the perverse incentives of the current financing system; that turning our 
delivery system upside down can cure the ills if the financial incentives aren't damaged. Thankfully, 
that is occurring.
<p>
The underlying principle and meaning of professionalism is a primary focus on our vocation and 
disinterest in economic gain. I firmly believe that 98 percent of the professionals that I practice 
with, and all of you in this room, are interested in taking care of your patients and would just like to 
get back to doing that. But you can't ignore the economics. Instead of playing golf, we have to do 
this. If it's another hour, then do it. You all worked 24 hours a day when you were interns. I think 
you have to go back to that for a short period of time. I don't want to do this for a long time, but I 
think that for the next year or two it is essential.
<p>

<b>WASHINGTON STATE</b>
<p>
<b>REPRESENTATIVE PHIL DYER:</b> Dr. Heithoff talked about sacrifice. I don't mean to 
sound "Woe is me," but I'd like to take you back in history just a little bit. In 1990, in the state of 
Washington, Governor Gardner, the predecessor to our current Governor Lowry, in his second term 
convened a broad, bipartisan, cross-cultural, horizontal agglomeration of business, labor, all the 
players, and called it his Health Care Commission. There were 13 voting members, plus a large 
number of advisory committees.
<p>
I, for 24 years now, have worked in the medical malpractice insurance field, so I come with a little 
bias in understanding the delivery system and the finance system. I worked for the task force 
regarding tort reform, which had been a crusade for me for many, many years.
<p>
I watched as the 13 Commission members, through 1990, leading up to 1992's election, sat and 
narrowly voted for provision after provision. You are going to hear some similarities between what 
Ken talked about in Minnesota and what Washington State adopted, as if the two states were 
literally lying on top of each other.
<p>
For instance, in 1992, the Commission voted, by one vote, to go with the single-payer system. It 
was an insidious setup for what they called managed competition, the system that was introduced 
following the 1992 elections in Washington State. The political complexion of the Washington 
state legislature at that time then became very heavily Democratic, which it had narrowly been for a 
long time.
<p>
I was not an elected official. We had an open district where there was an open seat, a Republican 
district. And I, a white male Republican, found myself facing a female Democratic opponent. I 
won, with 50.4 percent of the vote, less than 51 percent. 
<p>
I went to the legislature as a freshman. I walked into a caucus in the House of Representatives of 98 
members, and the ranking minority leader turned to me and said, "We need a chairman for the 
Health Care Committee. We've got a minor little debate going on on major policy here. Phil, you're 
it. You're all we've got."
<P>
Four days into the legislature, I became the ranking minority member on the Health Care 
Committee, where I watched the passage of a bill that was constantly being revised, with 202 FAX-
headers -- the latest wisdom from Washington, D.C. -- coming into the Democratic caucus, because 
in that spring of 1993, the Ira Magaziner task force had been formed and was, in fact, operating.
<p>
We ended up with a "managed care only" law that had premium caps, a broad-powered health 
services commission independent of public accountability, a uniform benefit plan dictated by that 
commission, and employer mandates. The only difference between the Clinton plan and ours was 
that Clinton was an 80 percent mandate and we were 50 percent sponsorship. We also had alliances 
that were unique geographic monopolies, and government-certified health plans -- a mimic of what 
we saw introduced later here in the lesser Washington, as we prefer to call it.
<p>
In 1993, the liberal mantra was not dissimilar to our friends at Nike: "Just do it."  And in "just 
doing it," you'll see another similarity. It was later admitted, in reviews with the legislators that 
passed the law in 1993, that fewer than ten out of 147 legislators had even read the bill. They were 
caught up in the emotion of the reform rhetoric and compassion for the downtrodden. No 
understanding of either the current system or the damage they were going to do to that system was 
evident. 
<p>
Nor did they understand the dissimilarities between health care financing and health care delivery. 
They would mix their rhetoric in talking about universality and access as if no one was getting any 
health care at all. This was in direct contradiction to the 1986 COBRA, which had said to all 
facilities, "You're going to take somebody in whether they've got a dime to their name or not."  No 
discussion of uncompensated care was contemplated.
<p>
The similarities are dramatic. Dr. Heithoff and I had talked briefly, but in listening to his 
presentation, I could have listened for another hour, because it would have been my speech. It's 
what happened in Washington State.
<P>
I referenced my manic compulsiveness, and I referenced back to his sacrifice. I turned to my wife 
and said, "Let me remind you of a fellow I worked for out of Texas years ago. He told me as a 
young insurance salesman following my departure from Washington, D.C., having worked for 
President Ford and not winning against President Carter, I had to go get a real job. He said, 'When 
you get out there to sell, don't make your competition angry, because they're going to work real 
hard to beat you if you do.'"
<p>
In 1993, I think the latter occurred, because I left that session, and I said, "This is absurd. This was 
a fraud on the people of the state of Washington. It has been a fraud on my fellow legislators. And, 
by God, we're going to turn this thing around."
<p>
I was not alone. There was a large employer community that became concerned, particularly the 
small business community. It was not only the denouement of the Clinton plan, but the denouement 
of my own business. I had to sell my business. I became preoccupied.
<p>
Over a space of 18 months, I did 168 speeches around the state of Washington. I would talk to 
anybody who would listen to me. It came to the point where I thought I would be wearing a 
sandwich board walking in downtown Seattle. I felt like Don Quixote. I had one Sancho, then two, 
then three, then four. And pretty soon, the windmill was no longer ethereal. It became quite real. 
We started being able to predict, and to see, what the implementation of that law would mean.
<p>
Dr. Heithoff referred to Minnesota's as a staged and incremental plan, not unlike the Clinton health 
care plan. We had the same staging, and, in fact, the time frame is so similar it is scary. Ours was 
implemented July 1, 1993, with final implementation in 1999. This is the frog and water syndrome. 
It is easy to take a frog and throw him into boiling water. The frog is not stupid. There's a 
neurological response: The water is hot, and he jumps out. It's not good for the frog. But put the 
frog in a pan of tepid water and turn the degrees up incrementally over time, and he will sit there 
and cook in his own juice. 
<p>
That was the staging of these Clinton-style health care scenarios in both Washingtons. But it 
became their downfall. It gave us time to get the word out. As I began to tour the state, my 
audiences in the fall of 1993 were this Rotary Club of 20 and that Kiwanis of 25. But by the fall of 
1994, in September and October, I was not speaking to an audience of less than 500.
<p>
<b>Business Interests.</b> The coalitions built by the Association for Washington Business 
included Boeing, Weyerhauser, and Microsoft -- names you all know -- along with the National 
Federation of Independent Business. We soon found that we had strange allies. Organized labor 
began to come on board, starting with the traditional Republican labor organizations of police and 
fire fighters and municipal employees. They were affected because they were no longer ERISA-
protected. They are never ERISA-protected, and they had given up cash wage benefits to negotiate 
nontaxable, noncash benefits in health care for the last 20 years.
<p>
When we showed them what the uniform benefit plan was going to do to their negotiated plan, and 
what the community rating on a one-to-one compression -- just like New York's great plan -- was 
going to do, that they were going to get less and pay more for it, we soon started picking up Boeing 
Aerospace 751 machinists' union. And the next thing you know, instead of a 98-member House 
with 33 Republicans, on the morning of November 9 we had 61 Republicans and 37 Democrats. 
Even more important, conservatives got control of the process.
<P>
<b>Political Change.</b> And I became Chairman of the House Health Care Committee with two 
years under my belt, and they said, "Watch out. He's got the gavel."  Well, "By God," I said, "We're 
going to do it," and we did it.
<p>
We had that bill out of committee in three and a half weeks. It was a 47-page bill; 44 pages were 
repealers. Three pages included three things. The first was continued expansion of our basic health 
plan, which is a complement to the Medicaid asset-based program for providing care to the 
uninsured. We agreed: You have to treat the uninsured. We also had the insurance reforms in there 
-- portability, guaranteed issue, and guaranteed renewability. And then we had MSAs. Beyond that, 
and the repealers, we had a pretty tight bill. 
<p>
We passed the bill through the committee and onto the floor of the House. Then we sat there with a 
slingshot, waiting for the Senate to figure out what they were going to do if we sent it over there. 
They panicked, because we started reminding them of the players who had supported the 1993 act. I 
said, "Can you find one who is vocal about the act being good, who is still elected today?"And with 
half the Senate up next year in 1996, looking around them, realizing they had a one-vote majority 
where they used to have a seven-vote majority in a 49-member Senate, all of a sudden two of the 
Democratic Senators came over and supported my bill. That was all it took.
<p>
We passed it out of the Senate and on to the desk of the Governor, who for two years, arm and arm 
with Bill and Hillary, had been touring the nation's capital as a hero of the populace. He was staring 
us down earlier in the session, saying, "I will veto any changes to my health care act."  He now was 
saying, "Because of the failure of Congress to give me an ERISA waiver, I can't have my plan, so I 
have to make it workable by making this change."  An interesting reversal of theme.
<p>
On April 23 of this year, Governor Lowery signed my bill. It was April 22 of 1993 that the original 
bill passed. I missed it by 24 hours: two years to the day.
<P>
What's next?  We have essentially a level playing field and an opportunity for enfranchisement, to 
bring the public back to the table. They have had an education. The federal health policy debates 
were essential to our success in Washington State because they educated the rank and file through 
the media. All we had to do during the course of the debate was say, "They are, in fact, alike. The 
principles are the same."
<p>
So what am I saying to doctors?  Listening to this morning's discussion, I'm noticing that your 
themes here at The Heritage Foundation are not dissimilar to the themes I see in Washington State.
<P>
Your traditional organized medicine is not always your friend. The Washington State Medical 
Association supported the Washington State health care plan. They had a distinct change in their 
Board of Trustees and their executive management. Politically, family practice physicians and 
specialists were engaged in civil warfare. For years, there had been a balance between primary care 
and specialty care, but in recent years there was no longer a balance; primary care had taken over 
organized medicine, and they were going to stick it to the specialists. 
<p>
And they were going to support this Clinton-style plan because it put them in charge, not realizing 
that we never changed the litigation playing field in the courtroom and that the four-week rotation 
in orthopedics for the primary care doctor is going to be adjudged in a malpractice action by the 
standard set by a board-certified orthopod. They are now beginning to wake up and realize that. Be 
careful what you wish for.
<p>
I also found that organizations like the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons, which 
had 38 members in Washington State, has now over a thousand in the space of 16 months. Doctors 
were bailing out of the state medical association right and left. Traditional medical organizations 
had been critics of mine for two years but are now giving me every opportunity to speak.
<p>
The animosity between providers and financiers as a result of profits and intrusions in clinical 
standards, and between financiers and providers on utilization controls, employers and financiers on 
premium costs, and employers and financiers or employees and financiers regarding deductibles 
and copays, are only a hint of the battles to come.
<p>
To providers, if you are ahead of the curve, my advice would be to get close to the employer 
community. Managed care organizations don't pay for health care. Employers, 87 percent of them, 
are the source of the funds. Politically, you have to build a relationship to the employer, not to the 
managed care organization.
<p>
In terms of your everyday practice, the challenges yet to come are managed care contract provisions 
that intrude upon your ethics and clinical sovereignty. Most of you have signed, I'll bet, a managed 
care contract that says you cannot criticize the plan to your patient. That is an absolute violation of 
your own ethics. 
<p>
Because you can't write contract standards, how can you get around ERISA and get to those self-
funded plans and not let them have those contracts?  I just gave you the clue. I'll have a bill in 
January that does it using your own licensing boards. It will enable you to make it illegal for 
yourself, under your license, to sign a contract with those provisions that's not ERISA-protected for 
those plans, and no plan can operate without a provider.
<p>
Antitrust has yet to come under safe harbor. It doesn't have the right tolerances, and scoped 
utilization review is my next hope in Washington State, where we don't -- and my apologies, 
because I made the analogy to Texas -- but we don't have an RN in Lubbock, Texas, telling a 
radiologist in Seattle what the standard of care is, and how that patient is going to be treated. I want 
to see utilization review that matches the scope of practice. But it can be superior to subordinate, 
not subordinate to superior, in the rank of scope and training.
<p>
So there's more to come. All we did was take the Nike theme of "Do it,"and just undo it. And now 
we're back to a level playing field, but we have a lot of work to do.

<h3>Life With Russell Kirk</h3>

<b>By Annette Kirk</b>
<p>
<a href="/heritage/kirk/kirklect.html">Russell Kirk Memorial Lecture</a>, Delivered November 17, 1995
<p>
My estimation of Russell can best be summed up by an incident that occurred several years ago:  
After an especially tiresome travel schedule delivering lectures in several states, Russell returned 
home with a very sore throat. When I phoned the doctor's office to obtain an appointment for him, 
the receptionist said she had no appointments available for at least a month. Hoping to explain the 
urgency of my request, I burst out, "But he's a national treasure; civilization needs him!"
<p>
And so it did and does need the words of Russell Kirk and those other giants who serve as 
guardians of culture, transmitters of our heritage. We are but dwarves standing on the shoulders of 
these giants who provided the philosophical underpinnings of our present political discourse. 
Russell's own significant historical and literary contributions have been widely recorded. As Ken 
Cribb observed, "He lifted with his own hands our forgotten patrimony from dusty oblivion."
<p>
After almost 30 years of marriage to Russell Kirk, there is simply so much to say that it is hard to 
know where to begin. Russell recounts his life in his memoir, <i>The Sword of Imagination</i> 
(published by Wm. B. Eerdmans, 1995). Today, I will offer my reflections on what life with 
Russell was like, and insight into how his conservative heart shaped his conservative mind.
<p>
Let me begin by answering a question I am often asked:  "Where did you and Russell meet?"  
When I was a junior in college, and president of the student body, I attended many student 
gatherings, at which I met the young men and women who were later to emerge as the leaders of 
the conservative movement. During this time, I became involved in the founding of several 
conservative youth organizations. One snowy Saturday morning in February of 1960, I spoke at a 
conference in Manhattan on a book entitled <i>The American Cause</i>. At the luncheon, I was 
invited to sit next to the author, Russell Kirk. I found him charming and shy and, by dessert, 
discovered that we were kindred spirits. 
<p>
The next year, as a college senior, I arranged lectures for him at my college, as well as at several 
campuses on the east coast. After graduation, I began teaching English and directing dramatic 
productions in a high school on Long Island, while also taking courses for a master's degree and 
remaining politically active. During these years, Russell and I saw each other on many occasions, 
but wrote each other even more often. The two years prior to our marriage, he wrote long missives 
daily -- letters often amusing, but always full of wise insights.
<p>
In addition to writing long letters, Russell also sent me books as gifts -- books such as W.H. 
Mallock's <i>An Immortal Soul</i>, George Gissing's <i>The Private Papers of Henry 
Ryecroft</i>, and <i>The Mind and Heart of Love</i> by the theologian Martin D'Arcy. It was 
this last book, which contrasts the classical concept of love as eros with the Christian concept of 
love as agape, that captured our imagination. We discovered that we both envisioned marriage as a 
vocation, an opportunity to serve not only each other and one's family, but one's community, one's 
culture. To explain how we got from this point of agreement on marriage in the abstract, to my 
writing him a letter agreeing to marry him in particular, would take at least another lecture. So 
suffice it to say that it had long been evident that Russell wished to marry me. Simultaneously, I 
came to the conclusion that I wanted to live all my days with him, to be part of his life, of his world 
-- in short, that I loved him.
<p>
On March 17, 1964, I wrote Russell a letter announcing, "Our marriage is inevitable," which 
sounds rather dour at this distance. Amused, he replied, "Yes, inevitable like death and taxes."  We 
were married on September 19 of that year at my parish chapel, named "Our Lady of the Skies" 
because it was located at, of all places, Kennedy Airport. A zither-player from a restaurant called 
the House of Habsburg performed, and after a small reception at my parents' home, during which 
Bill Buckley held court in the kitchen, we were driven to the airport to depart for our honeymoon in 
a 1929 Rolls-Royce Phantom II hearse, with a bumper-sticker affixed to it proclaiming "Goldwater 
for President."  A classmate of Russell's from St. Andrews University was trying to sell this car and 
was eager to drive us to the church. This seemed a bit much, but not wanting to offend him, we had 
him take us to the airport instead, with our wedding party in the back of the hearse.
<p>
After a brief honeymoon on remote Beaver Island in the middle of Lake Michigan -- a long way 
from the pleasant caf‚s and hectic pace of New York City where we had courted -- we soon 
departed for California, where we feverishly campaigned for Senator Goldwater in the weeks 
before the election. This was the first of many campaigns in which we would be active, attending 
state conventions as delegates and hosting in our home innumerable gatherings for candidates for 
public office.
<p>
In Henry Regnery's preface to the 40th anniversary edition of <i>The Conservative Mind</i>, there 
is a description of Russell as a young man:  "He doesn't say much, about as communicative as a 
turtle, but when he gets behind a typewriter the results are <i>most</i> impressive."
<p>
During the first few years of our acquaintance, I experienced the truth of that statement -- Russell's 
preference for typing rather than talking. If he happened to be in New York when my parents held 
their Sunday evening gathering of conservatives, Russell would come. If he were asked a question, 
he would give an excellent response. When one asked him to tell a story, he kept us in charmed 
awe. Otherwise, he was mostly silent. Within a few days after the gathering, however, once he had 
returned to his typewriter, I would receive a letter from Mecosta containing wonderful comments 
and reflections provoked by our discussions.
<p>
After some years of marriage, one of Russell's assistants put the question to him:  "Dr. Kirk, you 
and Mrs. Kirk are two very different people. Mrs. Kirk is very energetic, always on the move, and 
outgoing. You, on the other hand, are more meditative, stoical, and reserved. How is it that you 
have such a happy marriage?"  Russell replied in his typical manner -- without hesitation and to the 
point -- "What you have said is true -- we are very different. First Principles -- this is the basis of 
our happiness."  Needless to say, the young man was startled to receive such an encapsulated 
answer.
<p>
We did agree on all important matters. Yet, there were two items on which there was some 
contention -- how much the monthly phone bill should be and whether we should drive home the 
70 miles from the airport via the expressway or the scenic route. I'll leave it to you to guess who 
always wanted to take the scenic route.
<p>
Perhaps some background on my education can shed light on Russell's response to the question 
posed to him about our apparent differences, and in doing so touch upon his influence on my mind 
as well as on my heart. When I attended a Catholic college in the late '50s, the curriculum was 
designed to introduce students to first principles, to both the life of the mind and the realm of the 
spirit -- to dispose them to what Newman termed a "philosophical habit of mind."  Philosophy, 
emphasizing logic, and theology, especially apologetics, were then at the core of the curriculum.
<p>
Unlike most of the young men I knew, Russell enjoyed discussing the essential questions in which I 
was interested -- questions such as the metaphysical understanding of "being," the proofs for the 
existence of God, and the meaning and purpose of life. While he agreed that what made man unique 
was his ability to reason and to know the difference between right and wrong, Russell also believed 
that pure reason had its limits and that logical proofs were not needed to validate religious truths. 
He persuaded me that even if a transcendent order were denied in the realm of reason, evidences of 
every sort -- proofs from natural science, history, and physics -- demonstrated that we were part of 
some grand mysterious scheme working upon us providentially.
<p>
Russell introduced me to the "illative sense," an expression employed by Newman to explain a 
method of reasoning beyond logic. The illative sense is constituted by impressions that are borne in 
upon us from a source deeper than our conscious and formal reason. It is the combined product of 
intuition, instinct, imagination, experience, and much reading and meditation. (See <i>The 
Conservative Mind</i>, Chapter VIII, "Conservatism with Imagination:  Disraeli and Newman.") 
Quoting Pascal, Russell often reminded me that "The heart has reasons that the reason does not 
know."
<p>
Russell's emphasis on things of the heart and the hearth became more evident after we were married 
and began to have daughters. So mindful was he of pleasing children that when building an addition 
onto his ancestral home, he instructed the carpenters to place the windows closer to the floor so 
little ones could look out more easily. He also made sure there was a room in a tower that could be 
used as a clubhouse and a winding staircase to a cupola set atop the house allowing them to view 
village fireworks on the Fourth of July. To entertain them he created a garden walk and called it the 
Troll's Path.
<p>
Perhaps an episode that occurred when our first three daughters were young will illustrate Russell's 
enjoyment of everyday life and display how he derived profound insights from ordinary events. In 
his memoirs, which he wrote in the third person, he recounts this tale:
<p><blockquote>
	At Mecosta, snowdrifts persist well into April; when the drifts vanish, the lilacs 
bloom. On the first warm and bright morning of April 1971, there burst out of the 
pantry door of the Old House Monica, aged three; Cecilia, aged two; and Felicia, 
aged eleven months -- the latter two in their pajamas. They commenced to caper and 
sing.
<p>
	Monica, emulated enthusiastically by Cecilia, began piling stones on the back steps. 
"Stones for breakfast!"  she shouted, "We're going to have stones for breakfast 
tonight!"  While Felicia writhed in an endeavor to escape from her father's clutch to 
crawl on the new grass, Cecilia, not to be outdone in fantasy, tried to feed her 
pebbles while exclaiming, "Tones for b'ekfas'!"
<p>
	"Hush!"  said Monica, "I hear a bird!"  Cecilia spied a picturesque insect. Only [her 
father's] prompt exertions prevented Felicia from devouring pebbles in earnest.
<p>
	Returning from the post office, Annette reproved [her husband] for surrendering 
feebly to the desires of their strong-willed daughters who might catch cold outside 
in their pajamas; he protested that their gamboling could not be restrained. Before 
their marriage, Annette had declared that any husband of hers ought to be ready to 
romp with the children. Now she found her Russell all too liberally fulfilling her 
commandment. 
<p>
	In the spring of life, Kirk reflected, nearly everything is wondrous. The fortunate are 
those who have not lost their sense of wonder; who subsist upon the bread of spirit, 
laughing at the stones of dullness and hard materialism.
<p>
	"The life eternal is determined by what one says and does here and now"; so Martin 
D'Arcy had said. With these three playful daughters, that spring morning, Kirk 
enjoyed one of those moments in which time and the timeless intersect:  a glimpse 
of immortality.... 
<p>
	Those men and women who fail to perceive timeless moments are the prisoners of 
time and circumstance. Only by transcending the ravenous ego, and sharing their joy 
with others, do mortals come to know their true enduring selves and to put on 
immortality.
</blockquote><p>
Russell believed that we all long for immortality, for the garden before the fall. Perhaps this is one 
of the reasons why he derived such pleasure from gardening. Our fourth daughter, Andrea, who has 
tended sheep, and shared her father's love of the land, has written:
<p><blockquote>
	When he first took up residence at Piety Hill, my father found the land shaved of its 
lush trees by the family's first settlers, earning it the name "Stump Country."  So to 
make amends for the sins of his ancestors, he planted hundreds of trees on our land 
and in the village. Despite this great number, it seemed as though he could 
remember when each tree was planted and any other interesting detail about it.
<p>
	Agrarian life was well understood and appreciated by my father. Under the dimming 
September sun he and I worked together planting and pruning. He loved to watch 
the progress his labors had achieved; the growth of new life from his ancestral earth. 
The most precious objects in my father's life were his family, his home, and his five 
acres of land.
</blockquote><p>
With Chesterton, Russell believed that all life is an allegory and could be understood only in 
parable. Thus, he relied chiefly on myths, fables, and imaginative tales to teach his children how to 
live in a bent world.
<p>
In an essay entitled "A Literary Patrimony," our second daughter, Cecilia, recalls:
<p><blockquote>
	Night after night my father read aloud to us, all of us delighted by the stories. 
Sometimes we listened for hours. Occasionally, he was even more eager to read 
than we were inclined to listen:  when we fell asleep, we were carried up the 
wooden hill -- the stairs -- to the land of nod.
<p>
	My father also invented his own tales. He related these stories as installments beside 
the fireplace, the traditional place for a community's stories, developing the 
characters and plots as he spoke. We followed "Hew and His Knife," "The Elusive 
Earl," and other tales. Often he would conclude an episode with the protagonists 
caught in a perilous predicament -- surrounded by bandits or the like -- which on 
one occasion so infuriated us that we demanded that he "get those children home to 
their momma."  Laughing, he appeased us with a more satisfactory conclusion.
<p>
	Haunting works, far removed from the tales he told us, my father's published fiction 
often considers the eerie, the macabre, even the diabolic. For the sheer pleasure of 
their evocative titles, I specify: <i>Old House of Fear</i>, <i>The Surly Sullen 
Bell</i>, <i>The Princess of All Lands</i>, <i>Lord of the Hollow Dark</i>, and 
"The Invasion of the Church of the Holy Ghost."  His published fiction and 
unwritten children's tales do, however, share a common element:  the appeal to the 
normative consciousness, touching upon struggles of an ethical nature.
<p></blockquote>

During our three decades together, Russell and I enjoyed the company of dozens of people who 
became, for months or years, part of our extended family. Because of their presence, we were able 
to celebrate more fully holidays, feast-days, and birthdays. At one point, we had so many 
celebrations that Russell conferred upon one of our "little platoon" the distinction of "Mistress of 
Revels."
<p>
Halloween was always an especially festive night. Russell wore his saffron-colored St. Andrews 
academic gown. The village children always referred to him as "The Great Pumpkin."  Later in the 
evening, after the doorbell stopped ringing, he would gather us all around to play an English game 
called "Snapdragon," which involved snatching flaming raisins soaked in brandy from a brass tray 
and eating them while they were still burning.
<p>
During those years, our household included students, refugees, several musicians, and Russell's 90-
year-old aunt, who lived in a log cabin next door. Every day at 5 p.m., tiny Fay Jewell invited all of 
us to join her in her daily drink, a single glass of whiskey and water. The students always liked to 
join her to hear her tales of Mecosta and to take a break from their more scholarly pursuits.
<p>
One could give innumerable examples of Russell's hospitality, shown in large and small acts of 
kindness to others regardless of age or stature. Perhaps the best illustration of this hospitality was 
his acceptance of the hobo who lived with us for six years until he died. A stalwart white-haired 
Viking with piercing blue eyes, Clinton Wallace came to us on probation, having done time for 
stealing from church poor-boxes. He reasoned that he was the poor, and so he was justified in 
taking what he needed. Other than stealing on occasion, his only vices were laziness and buying 
lottery tickets. For years he had kept himself warm while on the road by visiting libraries, where he 
actually read the books. He memorized reams of poetry and loved to recite it at our seminars, 
especially Shakespeare and the <i>Rubiayat of Omar Khayyam</i>. Russell wrote his best and, to 
my mind, most beautiful short story about Clinton and called it "A Long, Long Trail A-Winding."  
In it, the main character, Frank Sarsfield, patterned after Clinton, dies in a snowstorm. Ironically, 
just one year later, Clinton died in a snowstorm, on his way home after seeing the movie "Across 
the Great Divide."  He is buried in our family plot, next to Russell.
<p>
For two decades, we held formal weekend seminars several times a year, sponsored by the 
Intercollegiate Studies Institute. These seminars addressed a wide variety of topics, including "Our 
Classical Patrimony," "Historical Consciousness," "In Search of the American Spirit," "Literature 
in an Ideological Age," and "Can Virtue Be Taught?"  We also held hundreds of informal seminars 
for the many graduate students who lived with us. All together, some two thousand students and 
professors attended these gatherings. 
<p>
Several of these ISI/Piety Hill seminars were held over the New Year's Eve holiday, and so 
naturally called for a celebration. After three days of serious discussion, furniture in the drawing 
room was pushed back to accommodate the dancing of reels, the singing of carols, and the breaking 
of a pi¤ata. The most memorable of these New Year's Eve seminars was the one attended by Kitty 
and Malcolm Muggeridge. The topic was "Pilgrims in the Dark Wood of Our Time."  It was an 
awesome experience to hear Muggeridge reflect upon his fascinating life, to take walks in the 
snowy woods, returning to drink hot cider before the fireplace in Russell's library -- the barn-like 
structure in which all such seminars were held and where Russell did almost all of his writing for 
40 years.
<p>
His writing, or "scribbling," as he referred to it, resulted in 30 books, 500 <i>National Review</i> 
articles, 2,500 newspaper columns, and 400 essays. He also wrote introductions and prefaces to 
countless numbers of books, and edited 30 titles for his series "The Library of Conservative 
Thought."
<p>
Russell was never a dry-as-dust type of scholar. He departed from academe early on and instead 
strove to write evocative prose which spoke to a larger audience, one he identified as "the common 
reader."  He deemed it urgent to speak to this group -- which might include scholars, but mainly 
consisted of people in commerce, the professions, public officials, parents, or students. He wished 
to reach those who perceived that civilization had lost its object, its aim or end, had become 
decadent. He sought to articulate this loss, and to give hope that renewal was possible, to 
continually remind us that for there to be outer order in society, there must be inner order in the 
souls of its members.
<p>
Russell desired us to recognize that a conservative disposition always displays piety toward the 
wisdom of its ancestors. Piety, by which he meant reverence not merely for things spiritual, but also 
for habit, custom, tradition, and history, provides us with an understanding of the limits of our 
intellect and leaves us open to the paradoxes and mysteries of life. Of piety, Richard Weaver has 
said:
<p><blockquote>
	[I]t seems to me that it signifies an attitude toward things which are immeasurably 
larger and greater than oneself without which man is an insufferably brash, 
conceited, and frivolous animal. I do not in truth see how societies are able to hold 
together without some measure of this ancient but now derided feeling.... The 
realization that piety is a proper and constructive attitude... helped me to develop 
what Russell Kirk calls "affection for the proliferating variety and mystery of 
traditional life."... [This realization] was for me a kind of recovery of lost power or 
lost capacity for wonder and enchantment.
</blockquote><p>
It seems significant that the last book Russell published before he died was <i>The Politics of 
Prudence</i>, a selection from the 60 lectures he gave here at The Heritage Foundation over a 
period of 16 years. The last chapter of this book is entitled, "May the Rising Generation Redeem 
the Time?"  One reviewer wrote:  "There is something fitting about Russell Kirk addressing the 
younger generation... because there is a remarkable youthfulness about Russell Kirk himself.... His 
impishness, his capacity for wonder and delight, his intellectual enthusiasm, his freedom from 
academic cant -- all make him the ideal pedagogue for the next generation of conservatives."  Of 
those Heritage lectures, Ed Feulner commented:  "I never ceased to be amazed by the inevitable 
overflow crowd of young people who couldn't get enough of him. I asked one of them what his 
hold was on them.... [A] young Reagan appointee said, 'He taught us all why our role was important 
beyond ourselves and beyond politics.'" 
<p>
Russell did not live to see the great congressional victory of '94. While he would have been pleased 
at this turn of events, he would have cautioned us to place this triumph in perspective. Probably, he 
would have approved the "Contract with America," but he would have reminded us of another 
contract, which joins in the community of souls those dead, those living, and those yet to be born -- 
the contract of eternal society.
<p>
This understanding of being part of a "community of souls" was very much evident in a eulogy for 
her father delivered by our third daughter, Felicia:
<p><blockquote>
	My father was delighted at my discovery at the age of fifteen of the Afrikaaner 
writer Sir Laurens van der Post. One of the first books of the many he presented to 
my mother before they were married was <i>The Seed and the Sower</i> by van 
der Post, whom he considered "a wise man."
<p>
	As my interest in the works of Sir Laurens grew, my father began searching his 
favorite book shops and catalogues for anything of a similar topic. On my last 
birthday I received eighteen books in this field. He often sent me postcards, typed of 
course, relating his progress in this endeavor. Our talks were of the bushman and his 
myths, of the land of Ethiopia, and the wonder of the world.
<P>
	This was the original basis of our friendship -- a bond of two of "God's spies," who 
did indeed as Shakespeare wrote in <i>King Lear</i>:  "live, and pray, and sing, 
and tell old tales and laugh at gilded butterflies... and take upon's the mystery of 
things."
<p>
	At our last Christmas gathering my father gave me a tape of an interview with Sir 
Laurens entitled "From the Heart."  We watched it together and listened to Sir 
Laurens speak of the prospect of his impending death and how after seeing "people 
of all races, of all cultures, and of all conditions die" [it was extraordinary to see 
how] "a certain majesty and dignity inside the human spirit comes to take people on 
to the end."  This was the way my father met death -- with reverence and dignity. 
What stories we'll have to tell, God willing, when next we meet!

Being with Russell was never boring. Because he viewed life as a perpetual adventure and loved so 
deeply, we were continually surprised by joy. Through my reflections and through the words of 
others, especially his daughters, I have tried to reveal the essence of his mind and heart, which 
continues on in the legacy that he has left us.
<p>
Perhaps our eldest daughter, Monica, best expressed our family's thoughts on life with Russell:  
"My father was a great intellectual and a distinguished writer. He was a teller of ghostly tales and a 
planter of trees. He was a devoted husband and loving father. But above all, in his words and in his 
actions, my father was a gentleman. Even when he was in considerable pain, my father never lost 
his gracious dignity. When I made a commitment to help my mother care for my father in his 
illness, I knew that it was my duty. I now realize that it was an honor."
<p>
For those of us who knew and loved Russell Kirk, the promulgation of his wise words is both a 
duty and an honor. In this regard, T.S. Eliot's words seem especially appropriate:  "The 
communication of the dead is tongued with fire beyond the language of the living."

<title>The Duma Elections: Russian Reformers Beware -- Heritage</title>

<h3>THE DUMA ELECTIONS: RUSSIAN REFORMERS BEWARE</h3>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/cohen.htm">Ariel Cohen, Ph.D.</a><br> 
Salvatori Fellow in Russian and Eurasian Studies<sup>1 </sup><br>
<a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Executive Memorandum No. 443<br>
December 29, 1995<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
The elections to the State Duma, the lower house of the Russian parliament, on December 17 
demonstrated that democratic politics are beginning to take root in Russia. A healthy majority of 
eligible voters participated, and the political elites are learning that they must appeal to them. 
However, many voters clearly are frustrated with the hardships of economic transition, crime, and 
corruption. The impressive performance by Gennady Zyuganov's communists at the polls, and the 
high public opinion ratings of ultra-nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky as a presidential candidate, 
indicate that the pro-market forces may lose control of the executive branch in the June 1996 
presidential elections. If this occurs, there is a danger that the 1995 elections will be the first and the 
last free and "clean" parliamentary elections in Russia for a long time.
<p>
<b>More Hardline Duma.</b> Half of the Duma (225 seats) is elected by party lists. To win 
seats in this half, parties had to gain more than five percent of the popular vote. Only four parties 
met this test. The Russian voters gave the communists 22 percent and Zhirinovsky's "Liberal 
Democratic" Party of Russia (LDPR) 11 percent. The centrist Our Home is Russia, headed by 
Prime Minister Victor Chernomyrdin, received 10 percent of the vote, and the reformist 
<i>Yabloko</i> Party led by economist Grigory Yavlinsky just over 7 percent. This means that the 
communists, together with their allies, now have about 30 percent of the votes, and the nationalists, 
over 17 percent.
<p>
The other half of the Duma is made up of single-seat constituencies, in which the candidate with the 
majority of votes in the district takes the parliamentary post. In these single-mandate districts, the 
voters elected 77 independent (unaffiliated) candidates, 58 communists, 20 deputies from the 
Agrarian Party (which is closely tied to the communists), 14 from <i>Yabloko</i>, and 10 from 
Our Home is Russia. Former Russian Prime Minister Yegor Gaidar's reformist Democratic Choice 
of Russia and the communist-nationalist Power to the People party, led by former USSR Prime 
Minister Nikolay Ryzhkov, won 9 seats each. Zhirinovsky's LDPR took only one seat. A few seats 
in the single-mandate districts were gained by members of smaller parties which did not clear the 
five percent barrier. 
<p>
Out of the total of 450 Duma seats, the communists lead with 150 seats, while LDPR, Our Home is 
Russia, and <i>Yabloko</i> all have approximately 50 each. Given these figures, the communists 
most probably will manage to appoint a chairman and take control of several key committees. The 
leadership of the Duma will consist of the chairman and leaders of the factions which will be 
formed. Given its composition, the Duma is likely to prove confrontational toward the executive 
branch.
<p>
<b>Achievement for Russian Democracy.</b> The 1995 democratic process was more 
transparent and fair than in 1993: this Duma was elected for a full four-year term; no parties were 
banned from running, and a total of 42 parties and movements participated in the race. The 1993 
Duma was elected for two years only, and several parties were banned from running after the 
Russian Supreme Soviet was disbanded by Boris Yeltsin.
<p>
The Russian public showed maturity by heeding the call to participate in the voting process. The 
voting rate was a respectable 65 percent, 15 percentage points higher than in 1993. The lowest 
voting rate was among the young, who tended to cast their ballots for democrats, Zhirinovsky, or 
centrists, but not for the communists. Older voters leaned more heavily toward the communists.
<p>
The elections were "clean" by Russian standards. This is the assessment of foreign and Russian 
observers and of the generally free mass media. There were very few reports of minor tampering 
with the process; three candidates, however, were killed or died in suspicious traffic accidents. 
<p>
There were quite a few surprises in the elections. A number of parties had been expected to do 
better. Among these were Gaidar's Democratic Choice of Russia (4.1 percent), Women of Russia 
(4.6 percent), and the Congress of Russian Communities led by the charismatic General Alexander 
Lebed (4.3 percent). 
<p>
The poor performance of Prime Minister Chernomyrdin's Our Home is Russia suggests that the 
voters do not trust the government's execution of reforms, and they are tired of the ubiquitous crime 
and corruption. Our Home is Russia won the most votes in Moscow (20 percent), where the 
country's capital is most heavily concentrated, and where the reforms already have produced wealth 
and opportunity. (Almost all of Moscow's single-mandate districts returned democratic candidates.) 
Voters in the provinces, where the reforms have not yet generated jobs and have weakened the 
social safety net, gave the communists and nationalists their heaviest gains.
<p>
<b>The Presidency: Yeltsin Still in the Running.</b> Many Russians believe that the Duma 
elections were but a dress rehearsal for the real political fight that will take place in the presidential 
elections next summer. The Duma elections highlighted Communist Party chief Zyuganov and his 
ability to command the still-formidable Party machine. They also showcased Zhirinovsky's shrewd 
political instincts, setting him up as the other presidential front-runner in June. On the other hand, 
Alexander Lebed, whose ads featured the General shooting an arsenal of infantry weapons, has 
shown that he is a better soldier than a politician. 
<p>
According to public opinion polls, both Chernomyrdin and President Boris Yeltsin are not favored 
to do well if they run for president. Both men are in their sixties in a country where the average 
male life expectancy is only 57. Yeltsin's ill health remains a central theme in Russian politics. 
Nevertheless, well-informed sources in Moscow predict that he will still run in June, even though 
he trails Zyuganov, Zhirinovsky, Lebed, and Yavlinsky in the presidential election ratings.
<p>
Yegor Gaidar's poor showing eliminated him as the presidential hopeful of the Russian center-right. 
Grigory Yavlinsky, who consistently has distanced himself from the Yeltsin administration and 
won high personal approval rating among the voters, remains the only democratic presidential 
hopeful. However, he will need to work hard to win the first round of presidential elections by 
becoming a consensus candidate of the reformers -- not a very likely development. 
<p>
<b>Conclusion.</b> The fight for Russia's democratic future is far from over. The democrats and 
reformers are split and hardly capable of resisting the dual nationalist and communist threat. While 
the elections showed that Russians can behave like good democrats, they showed also that voters 
do not necessarily elect good democrats. The reformers have to increase their popular appeal, and 
do it very fast. If these had been presidential elections, Gennady Zyuganov would now be the leader 
of Russia and working to turn back the clock, with disastrous consequences for his own country and 
her neighbors near and far. Come June, this may be a very real scenario if democrats do not unite.

<title>Keeping Faith with the Troops: Why Clinton Should Sign the DoD Bill -- Heritage</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><center>
<h3>KEEPING FAITH WITH THE TROOPS:
WHY CLINTON SHOULD SIGN THE DOD BILL</h3>

By <a href="/heritage/staff/spring.htm">Baker Spring</a><br>
Senior Policy Analyst<br>
<a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Executive Memorandum No. 442<br>
December 22, 1995<br>
<hr width=50%></center><p>

On December 19, the Senate approved the Department of Defense authorization bill, sending it to 
President Bill Clinton for his signature. The bill authorizes national security programs for both the 
Department of Defense and the Department of Energy for fiscal year 1996. 
<p>
President Clinton, however, has threatened to veto the defense bill. The President objects to the 
bill's provisions banning abortions at military hospitals, discharging military personnel with the 
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and earmarking funds for shipbuilding and other programs. 
But his biggest problem appears to be the bill's demand that the nation begin building defenses 
against ballistic missiles. Clinton is prepared to sacrifice the entire DOD bill -- one that raises pay 
for U.S. troops, including those being deployed to Bosnia -- because he cannot tolerate a bill that 
demands protection for the American people against missile attack.
<p>
The President needs to take a step back from his thoughtless threat to veto the DOD bill. Too much 
is at stake to play politics with the nation's security and the lives and well-being of U.S. troops 
overseas. He should sign the DOD bill because it:
<p>
<b>Supports the troops in Bosnia.</b> President Clinton has argued tirelessly that the nation 
needs to support U.S. troops in Bosnia. He is right. But how can he demand that others support the 
troops while he vetoes the very bill that authorizes funds for the troops?  The Department of 
Defense authorization bill establishes the legal foundation for all the programs necessary to conduct 
Operation Joint Endeavor in Bosnia. These include programs for military pay, operations, and 
procurement, as well as many intelligence programs. While many of these programs already are 
funded through the Department of Defense appropriations bill, which was approved earlier, their 
proper management still requires authorization.
<p>
<b>Improves the quality of life for military personnel.</b> The Defense authorization bill 
provides a 2.4 percent cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) for military pay and a 5.2 percent increase 
in funding for housing allowances. A presidential veto will block the full implementation of these 
adjustments in pay and benefits. The White House statement on the authorization bill indicates that 
the President supports these adjustments, but his threat of a veto implies otherwise. Why would a 
President who vetoes an entire federal budget bill because it does not provide increases in benefits 
to Medicare beneficiaries at the rate he desires not give the same consideration to military personnel 
by signing the Department of Defense authorization bill?  Military personnel -- particularly troops 
risking their lives in Bosnia -- deserve at least the same level of presidential support as Medicare 
beneficiaries.
<p>
<b>Funds the Bottom-Up Review force.</b> In 1993, President Clinton adopted a new defense 
policy and force structure following the Pentagon's Bottom-Up Review (BUR). The Clinton 
Administration's defense budget, however, does not provide enough funding to support the force 
structure recommended in the BUR. The White House states that because the Defense authorization 
bill provides almost $7 billion more in funding for defense than the President requested, he is 
opposed to it. But all Congress has done is attempt to fund the Clinton Administration's own 
defense program. A presidential veto would mean that, in effect, the Clinton Administration is 
disowning its long-range defense program.
<p>
<b>Modernizes the force.</b> President Clinton has stated on a number of occasions that he 
wants to maintain the technological superiority enjoyed by the U.S. military at the time he entered 
office. But the defense procurement account, which is the primary account for providing modern 
weapons to the military, has fallen by more than two thirds since 1985. Whereas procurement 
funding consumed almost 34 percent of the Pentagon's budget in fiscal 1985, by fiscal 1995 it had 
fallen to 17 percent. Most of the congressional add-ons go to the procurement account. Congress 
believes that cutting procurement too fast will erode the nation's superiority in military technology. 
A presidential veto would mean that the President has decided to fritter away this technological 
edge.
<P>
<b>Defends America.</b> The most outrageous complaint leveled by the White House at the 
Department of Defense authorization bill is the objection against the bill's provision to deploy a 
national missile defense system. President Clinton has ordered 20,000 troops to Bosnia because it 
supposedly serves the national interest. At the same time, the Clinton Administration has stated that 
a national missile defense system will not serve the national interest. The President apparently sees 
a national interest in sending U.S. troops to a conduct a dubious mission in remote Bosnia but 
cannot see one in defending the American people here at home against missile attack. This defies 
logic and common sense. It also is morally irresponsible. Why should the lives and security of 
Bosnians be more precious that those of Americans?
<p>
The White House states further that a decision to deploy a missile defense system will jeopardize 
the reduction of nuclear forces in Russia. Its argument: Deploying defenses supposedly will cause 
the Russian Duma to deny ratification of the 1993 Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty II (START II ). 
START II would reduce U.S. and Russian strategic nuclear arsenals each to 3,500 warheads. The 
U.S. Senate is likely to approve ratification of the treaty in the coming days or weeks.
<p>
The likelihood of approval of START II by the Russian Duma is indeed remote. But this dismal 
outlook for START II has little to do with a decision by the U.S. Congress to deploy missile 
defenses and everything to do with a view popular in the Duma, especially in the aftermath of 
recent elections under the sway of Communists and nationalists, that the Russian nuclear force is a 
useful tool for coercing other nations, including the U.S. By what twisted logic can someone blame 
the U.S. Congress for the demise of START II in the Russian Duma?  Anyone familiar with 
Russian politics knows that the Communists, nationalists, and military-industrial complex oppose 
START II because they want to keep Russia's strategic arsenal strong, not because they feel 
threatened by America's desire to defend itself against Russian missiles.
<p>
In national security policy, a President must mean what he says. Bill Clinton claims to support U.S. 
troops in Bosnia, but his threat to veto the Defense authorization bill belies his professed regard for 
their well-being and their purpose. He says he supports increases in military pay and benefits, but a 
veto of the DOD bill would deny the troops these increases. The White House pretends to have a 
long-range defense plan -- its much-ballyhooed Bottom-Up Review -- but a defense veto would 
make it all but impossible to fund the President's own program. Clinton insists that he wants to 
preserve America's lead in military technology, but his draconian cuts in military procurement 
would devastate the military's ability to stay on the cutting edge of technology. Finally, the 
President has declared his intention to protect the vital national interests of the U.S., but he would 
veto a bill that attempts to protect the American people against the growing possibility of missile 
attack.
<p>
The President's actions speak louder than words. His promises have proven to be empty. It is time 
for Bill Clinton to make good on his promises, and his words, by signing the Department of 
Defense authorization bill.

<title>Updated Estimates of the Costs to States of Not Reforming Medicaid -- Heritage</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg">
<center>
<h3>UPDATED ESTIMATES OF THE COSTS TO THE STATES OF NOT REFORMING MEDICAID AND THE ADDITIONAL COSTS OF ADOPTING PER CAPITA CAPS</h3>

By <a href="/heritage/staff/beach.htm">William W. Beach</a><br> 
Visiting Fellow in Tax Analysis<br>
<a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
F.Y.I. No. 81<br>
December 18, 1995<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>

The Congressional Budget Office revised its seven-year projections of federal Medicaid outlays on December 12, 1995. CBO made these revisions in order to reflect how the effect of lower forecasted inflation will reduce the federal government's Medicaid obligations. These lower inflation numbers also reduce the additional revenues the states must find over the next seven years (1996 through 2002) in order to meet their Medicaid obligations. The accompanying <a href="fyi81.gif">table</a> shows The Heritage Foundation's revised estimates of these additional state Medicaid obligations.<sup>1</sup><p>
1) If no changes are made to current law, the states and the District of Columbia probably will need to raise taxes or cut other spending by $146 billion over seven years in order to meet their mandated obligations. This estimate is $27.8 billion less than the earlier Heritage estimate of $174.2 billion.
<p>
2) If the Congress and the Administration adopt the "per capita cap" proposal advanced by a group of moderate Democrats, the preliminary Heritage analysis indicates that states may need to raise an additional $47.4 billion in new revenues or spending cuts on top of the $146 billion increase. 
<p>
3) The total cost to the states of the current law plus "reforms" made on a per capita cap basis is likely to be $193.8 billion.
<p>
The projections of additional state obligations under current law were prepared jointly by Heritage and Wharton Econometric Forecasting Associates, a nationally known economic consulting firm that maintains detailed models for each state. In these state-by-state Medicaid models, total Medicaid program spending is a function of that state's historical Medicaid expenditures and expected demographic and economic change. The baseline models were then adjusted to reflect CBO's forecasts of federal Medicaid outlays. Heritage's estimates of additional per capita cap costs are preliminary results of adaptations made to the baseline state models.

<hr><br>
<center><h3><a name="introduction">INTRODUCTION</a></h3></center>
	The Senate soon will vote on legislation authorizing $673 million in aid to Russia and the Newly Independent States (NIS) in FY 1996 and another $619 million in FY 1997.<p>

	In making this vote, the Senate will face some difficult choices. Foreign aid is more unpopular than ever, and aid to Russia, Ukraine, and other post-Soviet states is coming under heavy scrutiny. Moreover, U.S.-Russian cooperation is ebbing. Moscow's refusal to stop the sale of nuclear reactors to Iran has made it difficult to justify aid to Russia. So, too, has Russia's heavy-handed intervention in Chechnya.<p>

	Given these circumstances, Russian aid should be re-examined and applied to areas that not only make a difference, but also fit into an overall strategic plan. Properly applied, the transfer of market and democratic "know-how" can promote U.S. interests in the Newly Independent States of the former Soviet Union, increasing Russia's chances for a smooth transition to democracy and a free market. Therefore, Congress should continue aid to support the growth of democratic capitalism in Russia. This aid should be used to help democratic reformers, who face growing challenges from extremists. The most important programs in achieving this goal are those that develop market institutions, foster economic reform and privatization, and enhance the rule of law and democratic politics. <p>

	In addition, U.S. assistance in dismantling the former Soviet nuclear arsenal (the Nunn-Lugar program) should continue. Americans see reducing the Russian strategic threat as a worthwhile investment in U.S. security. However, this program should not be a sacred cow. The U.S. General Accounting Office and independent writers have reported serious flaws in this program, such as the use of U.S. taxpayers' funds for Russia's nuclear modernization and defense conversion. These flaws must be remedied. Congress should refocus the Nunn-Lugar program on its original purpose -- dismantling the Russian nuclear, chemical, and biological arsenal.<p>

	While fostering democratic capitalism in Russia serves U.S. national interests, many of the aid programs administered by the U.S. Agency for International Development (AID) do not. They often are poorly conceived and executed. For the last thirty years, AID and its traditional contractors have not worked in Eastern and Central Europe. Instead, they have operated in the Third World. As a result, AID officials and contractors lack the area and linguistic expertise needed to support the great post-communist transformation in Europe and the NIS. AID needs to upgrade its regional skills in the NIS, focus more of its efforts on developing democratic capitalism, and ensure that more aid funds go to Russian reformers, and not to American bureaucrats and experts.<p>

	As the Senate considers aid to Russia and the NIS, it should add conditions to this aid and refocus the program to make it more effective and relevant to the particular needs of its recipients. Specifically, the Senate should:<p>
<ul>
<li>Demand that the Administration suspend negotiations to reschedule the Russian and Soviet debt to Western creditors if the proposed sale of nuclear reactors to Iran is completed. The reactor sale is on hold pending negotiations between Vice President Al Gore and Russian Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin. By amending the foreign aid authorization bill, the Senate could block the Clinton Administration's agreement to reschedule Russia's debt if the sale to Iran goes through.<p>

<li>Condition U.S. support for IMF credits to the Russian government on a cease-fire in Chechnya. If Russia wants to be treated as a civilized member of the Western alliance, it must end the war in Chechnya. By amending the foreign aid authorization bill, the Senate could condition IMF or World Bank appropriations on the Russian government's compliance with a cease-fire and negotiations to settle the conflict in Chechnya.<p>

<li>Create an independent board to manage aid to Russia and the NIS. This board could set clear goals for U.S. aid to Russia and uphold democratic development as one of its top priorities. The Senate could help create this board by amending the foreign aid authorization bill.<p>

<li>Reprogram $225 million to develop democracy in Russia and the NIS by abolishing the Commodities Import Program (CIP) and the Russian Officer Resettlement Program. The $90 million CIP is a giveaway for U.S. businesses selling oil and gas technology to Russian industry. It should be eliminated and the funds used to further democracy in Russia, as should the $135 million earmarked for housing displaced Russian military officers. <p>

<li>Make democratic development a top priority. By amending the authorization bill, the Senate could demand that the Russian aid program focus exclusively on the development of democracy, the rule of law, and free markets. Many of AID's programs are unfocused, ineffective, and all too often intended to advance pet liberal causes, not democratic capitalism.<p>

<li>Target grants directly to democratic institutions in Russia and the NIS. Russians receive very little American help in fighting against human rights violations, media censorship, or racism, Most of the funds go to Americans purporting to help Russians, but Russian democrats can do far more with this money than American  "experts."<p>
</ul>


<a name="seige"><h3><center>RUSSIAN DEMOCRATIC CAPITALISM UNDER SIEGE</h3></a></center>

	Russian democracy and free markets are in deep crisis. Ten years after the beginning of Mikhail Gorbachev's perestroika, members of the former Communist Party elite still control the levers of power in Moscow as well as in the provinces. They are also in charge of Russia's vast properties and natural resources. Chaotic privatization has given many former Communist Party officials personal ownership of factories and other assets over which they used to exercise only administrative control. <p>

	The influence of old Soviet bureaucracy extends to foreign trade, the privatization process, and the issuing of business licenses. Russians often say that government bureaucrats, not entrepreneurs, are the richest people in the land. This elite may have given up its Marxist slogans, but it remains deeply committed to state intervention, government regulation, and the unbridled exercise of power. More often than not, Russian nationalism is touted in place of Marxist internationalism as a cover for the same old thing --   personal greed. <p>

	Ordinary Russians are deeply and understandably disenchanted with the direction reforms have taken. The majority of the population has lost interest in the political process, as evidenced by the low turnout of less than 25 percent in the most recent local and regional elections.<p>

	Support for political extremists on both the left and right is growing. Moreover, an increasing number of voters have cast their ballots for Russian Communist Party (RCP) candidates in recent elections. Running on an anti-government, anti-establishment, and anti-corruption platform, the communists are a favorite for the December 1995 elections to the Duma, the lower house of Parliament.<p>

	The Military Wild Card. The Russian armed forces also are disenchanted with the reform process. They oppose a Western-style democracy for Russia and yearn for a ruler with a "strong hand."  Military troops voted heavily for ultra-nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky in December 1993. The armed forces today are polarized between the majority of the officer corps, who believe that the military is grossly mismanaged, and a small group of generals around Defense Minister Pavel Grachev who use their positions for personal enrichment. The Russian Army feels defeated and nostalgic for the Soviet period, when it enjoyed high status and large budgets. <p>

	This situation has been made worse by the war in Chechnya, in which tens of thousands of Russian soldiers have participated in killing citizens of their own country. In the 1980s, veterans of the Afghan war contributed to the swelling ranks of Russian organized crime. They also flooded the extremist nationalist movements. This could well be repeated after Chechnya, further destabilizing Russia's feeble democracy.<p>

	Authoritarian Renaissance. Democracy is under siege as well. The Yeltsin administration has done little to promote the rule of law in Russia. It rammed through the 1993 Constitution, establishing an "imperial" presidency with little but an advisory role for Parliament. Such democratic reformers as former Acting Prime Minister Yegor Gaidar, Finance Minister Boris Fedorov, Vice Prime Minister Gennadii Burbulis, Human Rights Commissioner Sergei Kovalev, Ethnic Policy Advisor Galina Starovoitova, and many others have been pushed out of the government. The most influential group in the Kremlin today includes Yeltsin's Chief of Bodyguards, General Alexander Korzhakov, and First Deputy Prime Minister Oleg Soskovets, who is in charge of the military-industrial complex. Even Yeltsin's Chief of Staff, Sergei Filatov, has complained that presidential aides are forced to communicate by writing notes to each other because their phones and rooms are wiretapped.<p>

	The political role and power of Russia's historically strong spy agencies are growing. In September 1994, the Foreign Intelligence Service, headed by KGB veteran General Evgenii Primakov, published its own policy statement advocating strengthened Russian domination of the whole area of the former Soviet Union, the so-called near abroad. According to Primakov's agency, Russia must re-consolidate all the Newly Independent States under its tutelage regardless of the West's opposition.<p>

	On April 6, 1995, President Yeltsin signed the State Duma law reorganizing the secret police, then called the Federal Counterintelligence Service and known by its Russian acronym, FSK (Federalnaya Sluzhba Kontrrazvedki). This agency, the successor to the Second Chief Directorate of the KGB, is now called the Federal Security Service (Federalnaya Sluzhba Bezopasnosti, or FSB). It has been granted wide powers to conduct investigations and perform surveillance in total secrecy. The scope of its activities was broadened to cover a wide range of internal security threats ranging from organized crime to political extremism to corruption.<p>

	Threats to Free Media. The Yeltsin administration is tightening its control over the electronic media, especially the national television stations. The provincial media also are under heavy pressure from the local chiefs of administration, who have been pressured by Yeltsin to "toe the line."  In late 1993, former Pravda journalist Boris Mironov was appointed chairman of the State Committee on Press. Before he was fired in the fall of 1994, Mironov funneled huge subsidies to hard-line ultra-nationalist newspapers. "If to be a Russian nationalist means to be a fascist, then I am a fascist," he said.<p>

	Vlad Listyev, Director General of the largest Russian TV network and a popular talk show host, was gunned down in the entrance to his apartment building on March 1, 1995. On October 17, 1994, investigative reporter Dmitrii Kholodov of Moskovskii Komsomoletz was murdered by an exploding briefcase. Kholodov was investigating corruption in the military at the time. Others have been slain while investigating organized crime. Journalists in the regions have been tortured and killed. The print media are coming under increasing pressure, as the Moscow government owns printing presses and manipulates the prices of newsprint as well as subsidies to newspapers. <p>

	The Russian government continues to play a dubious role in the media scene. It refuses to privatize television stations and printing plants. The official newspaper Rossiyskaya Gazeta publishes anonymous attacks on Yeltsin's opponents, such as media tycoon Vladimir Gusinsky, who has been accused of launching a "putsch" against Yeltsin. Formerly allied with democratic presidential candidate Grigory Yavlinsky and Moscow mayor Yurii Luzhkov, Gusinsky is a political foe of a powerful group in Yeltsin's entourage. The State Duma thus far has failed to eliminate the right of the government to establish media outlets, while it has expanded the list of circumstances under which the government is empowered to shut them down.<p>

	Criminalization of Politics. Rising crime also is endangering democracy in Russia. The recent gangland-style murder of three Duma deputies may have been the work of professional hired killers. So far, no arrests have been made. Moreover, a senior Russian Interior Ministry expert warns against the growing influence of Russian mafiosi "among law enforcement organs and other organs of power."Whole areas of Russia are becoming the domain of organized crime. But the Yeltsin administration is notoriously ineffective in fighting crime and corruption. Despite draconian decrees, known criminal figures remain unpunished and free to penetrate the Russian body politic. At the same time, the hard-liners are exploiting the public's fear of lawlessness to advance their own political goals.<p>

	Organized crime is reaching the highest echelons of power. In the summer of 1994, a Moscow mafia don, Otari Kvantrishvili, was killed by a sniper's bullet. Kvantrishvili headed a powerful political party, Sportsmen of Russia, which was better organized and financed than some legitimate parties represented in the Duma. A prominent criminal, Vladimir Podatev from Khabarovsk, nicknamed "the Poodle," is launching a national political career by becoming a member of the Presidential Public Chamber Human Rights Commission. Podatev is also the leader of a local political movement called Unity, a first step toward attaining office in a national election.<p>

	The Fascist Threat. Extremist Russian nationalism, often identified as neo-Nazism or fascism, is another threat to Russian democracy. The nationalists comprise a broad spectrum, from Vladimir Zhirinovsky's Liberal Democratic Party, which is well-represented in the Duma, to the National Republican Party of Nicholas Lysenko, who was elected to the Duma by a St. Petersburg district. Zhirinovsky's delegates comprise 22 percent of the State Duma. Altogether, the nationalists are expected to get over 30 percent of the vote in the December 1995 elections.<p>

	Nationalists also find political support from Gennadii Ziuganov's communists and Vladimir Barkashov's Russian National Unity movement. The nationalists are united in their hatred of the United States and the West. Some are anti-Semitic, while others passionately hate dark-skinned "Caucasians" -- Azeris, Armenians, Georgians, and Central Asians.<p>

	Russian fascists are involved in extensive paramilitary training programs, conducted with the full knowledge and complacent inaction of the authorities. One of their most important leaders, judo black belt Vladimir Barkashov, claims to have 10,000 well-trained fighters under his command. The Russian security services put this number at 2,000. Other organizations, such as Zhirinovsky's Falcons, the Werewolf Legion, the National Republicans, and Pamyat, have from several dozen to several hundred stormtroopers each.<p>

	Unfortunately, some officials in Russia's law enforcement agencies, including KGB spin-offs, the police, and even the prosecutor's office, often sympathize with and support political extremists. Defectors from Barkashov's organization warn that a deliberate attempt by the neo-Nazis to penetrate the military and security services is under way.<p>

	Russian law enforcement and security services are incompetent in fighting ultra-nationalists as they are in combating organized crime. For example, the police failed to keep Alexei Vedenkin, a prominent Russian fascist, in pre-trial detention after he pledged on national television to kill Duma Defense Committee Chairman Sergei Yushenkov and Yeltsin Human Rights Commissioner Sergei A. Kovalev. After two weeks in jail, he was released by a Moscow judge on a technicality. Meanwhile, Vedenkin's Russian National Movement has bought up a large packet of shares in the Siren Three consortium, which will control plane ticket reservations all over Russia and the former Soviet Union.<p>


<a name="nis"><h3><center>WHY AID RUSSIA AND THE NIS?</h3>
</a></center>
	Despite the rocky road to reform, Russia has not reverted to its old-style totalitarian ways. Nor is it an ultra-nationalist dictatorship. Despite the chaos of its transition, there are reasons for hope. Privatization has allowed many Russians to acquire or start small businesses. Others have become owners of Soviet-era factories. More Russians are employed today in the private sector than at any time since 1917. The reforms in Ukraine are about to take hold. The nascent capital markets and commodity exchanges are breeding rough-and-tumble capitalists -- the kind that build personal fortunes. The entrepreneurial class is more involved in politics than ever. Pressure to formalize the legal infrastructure needed to conduct business is growing.<p>

	Political pluralism also is growing. There are at least ten large political parties or movements in Russia. In addition, dozens of political parties will compete in the December 1995 elections. The independent media are providing blunt and courageous coverage of Chechnya, despite government attempts to manipulate them. While some Russians yearn for a "strong hand," 70 percent want democratic elections and a free press. Moreover, support for reforms is highest where it matters most -- among urban educated citizens under the age of 35.<p>

	Nor has Russia embarked upon a Bolshevik-style retaking of the former Russian empire as it did under Lenin and Stalin. The Russian military is bogged down in Chechnya and Central Asia. Despite calls from nationalists to rebuild the USSR, ineptitude and corruption in the army and the lack of popular will to pay the price do not bode well for Russian revanchists. After Chechnya, the Russian leadership probably will think twice before ordering tanks into any other rebellious area. Prime Minister Chernomyrdin's repeated attempts to distance himself from the fiasco in the Caucasus, and the Duma's     relentless attacks on President Yeltsin over Chechnya, indicate that Russia's elites are  seeking new ways to settle political crises.<p>

	Almost eighty years ago the West abandoned Russia to the Bolsheviks. Today, it is in America's interest to encourage Russia to follow a new direction and make its domestic and international behavior more benign. At the same time, the U.S. should support the independence and viability of the other post-Soviet states as a balance against a possible Russian resurgence. Reformers in Moscow, Kiev, and other parts of the NIS have asked repeatedly not only for technical assistance to build democratic and market institutions, but also for support of non-governmental alternatives to state services and functions. Properly implemented, U.S. assistance should be fulfilling these needs. <p>

	The crisis of Russian democracy is deep, but there is hope. U.S. assistance to democrats in Russia and parts of the NIS possibly could help end this crisis. Without U.S. aid, however, it will only get worse.<p>


<a name="bird"><h3><center>AID'S INEFFECTIVE PROGRAMS:<br> TOO MUCH BIG BIRD, TOO LITTLE DEMOCRACY</h3>
</a></center>
	Saying that aid can make a difference in Russia is one thing. Saying that current aid programs are doing the job is another. Many current U.S. aid programs to Russia and the NIS are not doing the job. They are often ineffective and should be reorganized. As the Senate Foreign Relations Committee has noted: <p>

	[M]uch of AID's technical assistance effort in the New Independent States and Central and Eastern Europe has produced little positive result. Closed procurement practices and AID's own lack of experience in the region has too often led to the awarding of contracts to organizations who themselves have little regional or area competence. In many instances, AID has relied on its network of contractors which have experience in the poorest developing nations. The result has often been wasteful expenditures on contractor field office infrastructure, poor recruitment of participants and expensive, and misdirected short-term training in the United States which has had negative impact on NIS professionals participating in the program.<p>

	Certainly the problem has not been lack of money. Congress has appropriated almost $3.7 billion in aid to Russia since the assistance program began in 1992. Out of these funds, AID obligated $2.5 billion, but only $1.2 billion has been spent. In addition, only $126 million was obligated and $49 million spent on "democratic pluralism initiatives" in the whole of the NIS (see Appendix). Funds for building democracy in the NIS comprised only about 5 percent of AID's total budget; by contrast, management costs make up about 5 percent to 10 percent. Clearly, promoting democracy is AID's budgetary stepchild.<p>

	While some AID programs are successful, many are expensive, lack a coherent overall strategy, and are ill-conceived and poorly executed. For example, not a single U.S. law school or law office received AID funds to execute an AID-sponsored program in the NIS. Yet establishing the rule of law is one of the most important prerequisites of democracy. AID's rule of law program has been severely criticized by legal professionals both in Russia and the U.S. They argue that too few lawyers, lawmakers, judges, and prosecutors have been involved to make a significant impact. The program does not sponsor the long-term education of Russian lawyers in U.S. law schools. Nor has AID succeeded in placing a significant number of American legal advisors in Russian ministries, the Duma, or the Supreme and Constitutional Courts. American jurists have had precious little impact on Russian legislation and regulations.<p>

	Instead of providing adequate support for rule of law programs, what has AID been doing?  Funding Big Bird in Russia. Despite the fact that Russia already produces superb children's films and television programs, AID has granted $2 million to the Children's Television Workshop, a money-making venture affiliated with the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, to produce a Russian version of the American TV program Sesame Street. Why does a group like CTW, which is worth millions, need taxpayer money to set up shop in Russia?  And what does giving exposure to the Russian-speaking equivalent of Big Bird and Oscar the Grouch have to do with developing democracy and the rule of law? <p>


<a name="capitalism"><h3><center>SUPPORTING DEMOCRATIC CAPITALISM IN RUSSIA</h3></a></center>

	Properly focused and administered, aid to Russia and the NIS serves American interests. AID could help prevent Russia from becoming a crime-ridden "mafiacracy," a source of nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons proliferation, and a destabilizing factor in the global financial and commodities markets. Many Russian democrats wish for the same things. <p>

	In order to assist the transformation to democratic capitalism in Russia, Ukraine, and other former Soviet republics, the Senate should:<p>
<ul>
<li>Demand that the Administration suspend negotiations to reschedule the Russian and Soviet debt to Western creditors if the proposed sale of nuclear reactors to Iran is completed. The nuclear sale was the topic of discussions between Presidents Clinton and Yeltsin at their May summit in Moscow. The two agreed to refer the matter to the Gore-Chernomyrdin commission for further negotiation. During those negotiations, Vice President Gore should make it clear that the U.S. and Russia cannot have a normal and friendly relationship if the sale goes through. <p>
</ul>
	In the meantime, Russia wants a sweeping rescheduling of half its $130 billion debt to the West by the end of this year. At the same time, Yeltsin asked the G-7 leaders at the Halifax summit in June to accept Russia into the Paris Club as a creditor to Third World countries for their Soviet-era debts. This is an opportunity for the U.S. Senate to demand Russia's cancellation of the Iranian nuclear deal. By amending the foreign aid authorization bill, the Senate could demand that Russia's debt not be rescheduled if the deal goes through. The U.S. could relax access to its nuclear and commercial satellite launch markets for Russian companies as compensation for canceling the Iranian transaction. <p>
<ul>
<li>Condition U.S. support for IMF credits to the Russian government on cease-fire in Chechnya. The U.S. cannot and should not challenge the territorial integrity of the Russian Federation. Like any other state, Russia has the right to ensure its sovereignty. However, this right does not justify the extreme means employed against the people of Chechnya. Other measures short of war should have been taken. For example, a Federal Treaty model, which is working in the case of Moscow's relations with Tatarstan, was not seriously tried in Chechnya.<p>
</ul>
	Last spring, the U.S. supported $6.6 billion in International Monetary Fund credits to Russia. In view of Moscow's intransigence in Chechnya, the Congress should condition any future U.S. support for IMF financial assistance on a cease-fire and negotiations to settle the conflict. The U.S. should demand that all hostilities be stopped, especially those affecting innocent civilians, and that negotiations be successfully concluded, either bilaterally or through the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. Until such time, the Senate should consider amending the foreign aid authorization bill to demand that the U.S. suspend its financial assistance to Russia through such multilateral organizations as the IMF, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and the World Bank. This position would strengthen the hand of Russians who are calling for an end to the hostilities in Chechnya and for a negotiated solution.<p>
<ul>
<li>Create an independent board to manage aid to Russia and the NIS. AID has poorly managed U.S. aid programs for the NIS. An independent board, nominated jointly by Congress and the President, should take over the management of these programs and refocus them on building democratic capitalism in the NIS. (A modified board for all assistance projects was suggested by Senator Jesse Helms (R-NC), but was voted down in committee.) This board could include representatives from the State and Commerce Departments as well as area experts and representatives of the U.S. corporations involved in the NIS.<p></ul>

	There is precedent for creating such a board. The presidentially appointed Board of International Broadcasting (BIB) for forty years successfully administered Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty. Members of this nonpartisan board included such prominent Americans as Malcolm Forbes, Jr., James Buckley, Frank Shakespeare, and Lane Kirkland.<p>
<ul>
<li>Reprogram $225 million to develop democracy in Russia and the NIS by abolishing the Commodities Import Program (CIP) and the Russian Officer Resettlement Program. Under the CIP, $90 million worth of U.S.-made oil and gas equipment is to be given to Russia's most profitable industry, the hydrocarbon energy sector. The program should be abolished. The CIP is supposed to improve the Russian balance of payments and to assist in repaying Russia's debt to Western creditors by allowing Russia, with U.S. support, to drill for and sell more oil in the world market. AID bureaucrats hope that more productive American equipment will boost the Russian state-run energy sector. However, all the CIP would do is prop up the inefficient state-owned Russian energy industry. Experience in Russia shows that Western equipment alone is not a panacea. Capital investment, such as CIP-funded equipment, will not alleviate the problems of systemic mismanagement that plague the Russian oil and gas industry. Only privatization and massive Western investment will resolve the problem once and for all. The funds saved from abolishing CIP should be reprogrammed into democracy-building programs.<p></ul>

	So, too, should funds from the program to build housing for Russian military officers. Under orders from President Yeltsin, the Russian army participated in the slaughter of civilians in Chechnya. The funding for Russian officer resettlement was cut by the House Foreign Operations Subcommittee this spring. The Senate restored this funding in conference, but reduced it from the $155 million requested by the Clinton Administration to $135 million. This money would be spent better on democracy-building programs. <p>
<ul>
<li>Make democratic development a top priority. Thus far, AID's Democratic Initiatives Program is unfocused and suffers from hidden agendas. For example, AID will spend $500,000 on a program administered by Winrock International to enhance the "development and operation of a united group of women's NGOs in Russia, Ukraine and the U.S. to facilitate interaction, cooperation and collaboration in the building of a democratic society in the former Soviet Union."  Russia needs to build democratic institutions and the rule of law. It does not need American liberals telling Russians how to organize feminist groups.<p></ul>

	Far more important would be programs that train Russians to run election campaigns and organize grass-roots groups and referenda. This aid should be given to such democratic parties as Russia's Choice, Yabloko, and the Economic Freedom Party. Public organizations involved in significant reform of legislative and judicial bodies or in public education, such as the Foundation for Parliamentary Development and the newly established Anti-Fascist Foundation, also deserve support.<p>

	U.S.-funded programs need to employ qualified Russian reformers, who understand their politics and culture far better than AID contractors with little experience in Russia. Most AID democracy development programs have been awarded to traditional contractors who know more about AID's lengthy and complex contracting process than they do about Russia, Ukraine, and other NIS countries. Russians and Americans living in Moscow complain that these contractors spend large amounts of AID money to "educate" themselves about the problems. Why hand out perks to friends of AID bureaucrats when Russian democrats could do the job for less money?<p>

	To focus aid programs on building democracy in the NIS, Congress should establish priorities for democratic assistance. Funds should go to Russian and American organizations that:<p>
<ul>
<li>Train Russians and other NIS citizens to run and manage elections and electoral campaigns;<p>

<li>Foster the use of public opinion research;<p>

<li>Help organize democratic grass-roots organizations;<p>

<li>Educate Russians in fundraising techniques;<p>

<li>Develop political parties;<p>

<li>Develop Western-style academic programs in law, business, and market economics;<p>

<li>Use the existing legal system to prosecute neo-Nazis for violations of laws;<p>

<li>Post Western legal advisors in the legislatures, government ministries, regional administrations, the court system, and the Attorney General's office;<p>

<li>Help develop administrative law that allows citizens to challenge central and local governments in the courts;<p>

<li>Work to develop constitutional law;<p>

<li>Draft democratic legislation;<p>

<li> Assist in law enforcement, such as setting up neighborhood watches, anti-crime hotlines, and witness relocation programs; and <p>

<li>Train legislators, judges, and lawyers in the rule of law.<p>

<li>Target grants directly to democratic institutions in Russia. By amending the foreign aid authorization bill, the Senate could direct more funds into democracy-building programs administered by the Eurasia Foundation and National Endowment for Democracy. The Eurasia Foundation and NED directly fund Russian grass-roots organizations, like the Memorial Society, which is fighting against human rights violations in Chechnya, and the Glasnost Foundation, which promotes the reform of Russia's secret services. These are examples of organizations that deserve Western support. Private American institutions such as The Heritage Foundation, the Krieble Institute, and the Soros Foundation have accumulated experience in working with Russian institutions and could help identify appropriate recipients and personnel for targeted U.S. assistance.<p></ul>


<h3><a name="conclusion"><center>CONCLUSION</a></h3></center>

	Russian democracy is in a danger zone. While U.S. aid alone cannot save democracy in Russia, it certainly can improve its chance of surviving. Clearly, America has an interest in a democratic Russia. Assisting Russia's transition to democracy is as important as were the de-Nazification of Germany and the reforming of Japan after World War II. But the Clinton Administration has failed to rise to the challenge. Time is running out. U.S. aid programs need to be refocused not on the traditional development goals of the foreign aid bureaucracy, but on building democracy and free markets.<p>

AID'S DEMOCRACY PROGRAMS IN THE NIS

	The AID-funded Democratic Pluralism Initiatives Project includes the following programs:  Political Development, Rule of Law, Public Administration/Local Government, and Civil Society and Media. <p>

	The strategic aim of these programs is to accelerate NIS transition to democracy and a market economy. Their task is to strengthen civil society and its institutions, train market specialists and civic leaders, and encourage the transition to a more benign political culture. <p>

	Following is a brief summary of the major AID initiatives in the NIS. <p>

	Political Development Program. A large part of the AID funding in this program goes to the two U.S. party institutes. Since 1992 the International Republican Institute and the National Democratic Institute have received over $10 million each. These institutes fund seminars and education for political party activists, conferences, and exchanges. The International Foundation for Electoral Systems (IFES) has received over $6 million. It is involved in training for and supervision of electoral processes. The AFL-CIO's Free Trade Union Institute has received $3.5 million. Other organizations, from the New York-based Freedom House to Indiana University, have received grants that as a rule are less than $1 million.<p>

	The Rule of Law. These programs are executed by three contractors. The largest contract, worth over $18 million, is in the hands of ARD/Checchi and Company, a traditional AID contractor. Other awards amounting to $5.6 million have gone to the American Bar Association's Central and East European Law Initiative. The Central Asian component of the Rule of Law program, worth $5.5 million, was awarded to yet another traditional AID contractor, Chemonics. These contractors provide a variety of services, from commenting on legislative drafts to jury trial training and the education of judges and prosecutors.<p>

	Public Administration and Local Government. This program is administered by the Research Triangle Institute ($19.5 million), World Learning ($2.2 million), and several smaller contractors. The program focuses on bringing Russian and NIS local officials and professionals to the U.S. to learn the techniques of city management.<p>

	Civil Society and Media. This program funds such media projects as Internews, a Moscow-based independent TV news production operation.<p>

<p>
<h3>ABOUT ISSUES `96</h3>
</center><P>
<P><I>Issues `96</I> is intended as a handbook for conservative candidates 
of all parties seeking national office.
<P>
<P><I>Issues `96</I> is broken down into sections, one dealing with 
domestic issues likely to be part of the debate, and the other dealing 
with foreign policy and defense issues. Each section begins with a 
general introduction.
<P>
<P>Each chapter follows a general structure (with some variation 
in the foreign policy section). The chapter first summarizes the 
principal issues considered likely to be raised during the election. 
The main body of the chapter then provides candidate-friendly 
statistics and other information to help frame the debate. Following 
this is a summary of the record of the 104th Congress and the 
Clinton Administration on the issue, and a set of policy 
recommendations for 1997. Finally, chapters include a question-and-answer 
section dealing with questions likely to be raised during the debate. 
The information in each chapter is fully footnoted for reference, and 
a list of experts and relevant Heritage publications is included.
<P>
<P>The material in each chapter is as up-to-date as possible. 
<I>Issues `96</I> went into final production in mid-February; whenever 
possible, policy developments since that time have been noted. Updates 
will be issued if there are developments that affect key parts of a 
chapter. These updates can be obtained from The Heritage 
Foundation Government Relations Department or through the 
Heritage Internet home page.
<P>
<P><I>Issues `96</I>, chapter updates, and all other Heritage 
Foundation studies are available on the Internet through the Town Hall

<CENTER><H2>THE CHOICE IN 1996</H2>
<CITE>By <a href="/heritage/staff/butler.htm">Stuart Butler</a> </CITE></CENTER>
<P>
</P>
<P>When Bill Clinton was elected in 1992, he promised America  a different way
of doing business in Washington. He promised  an end to gridlock, saying that
now there would be a President  willing to work closely with Congress to deal
with the problems that  afflict the nation. He promised fiscal integrity in
Washington and  a reduction in taxes on overburdened working families. He 
promised to reinvent the federal government. And he promised to &quot;end 
welfare as we know it.&quot;
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>He has done none of these things. Worse still, when a  Congress was elected
in 1994 prepared to send Clinton the  legislation needed to do the things he had
promised, he did not cooperate  with Capitol Hill to fashion a reasonable
compromise. Instead,  he worked actively against passage of the legislation and
then  vetoed most of the key bills he was sent. The result: the very gridlock 
he promised to end. The main reason for this impasse is that  while Congress
generally has been prepared to face up to the tough  decisions that must be made
to balance the budget, reform  entitlements, and restructure failing programs,
Bill Clinton has failed  to confront the constituencies that oppose change.
Moreover, he  has failed to exercise leadership by using his presidency to 
force Americans to recognize that hard decisions have to be made.  As veteran
journalist Robert Samuelson put it early in 1996:
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 2 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>     President Clinton no longer has a coherent agenda, if he 
ever did. Mainly, he favors everything that might make people  feel good and
opposes anything that might make them feel  bad. He (reluctantly) supports a
balanced budget while  denouncing congressional cuts in popular programs like
Medicare,  Medicaid and food stamps. Clinton exploits these issues  without
illuminating the practical choices government  faces. <TT><B><A
HREF="ftntintr.htm#1">1</A></B></TT>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P>Much like the citizens of many other Western  democracies, Americans have a
habit of trying to avoid major decisions  about the scope and finances of their
government until they cannot  escape such choices. The actions required then
typically are far  more extreme than would have been needed had prudent steps
had  been taken earlier. America today faces a number of issues on  which
well-conceived and decisive action now will avoid  panic-driven and drastic
action some years in the future. Correcting the  structural financial imbalance
in the Medicare program now, for  instance, can avoid collapse early in the next
decade. Action now,  in other words, will forestall the severe cutbacks or huge
tax  increases that will be needed to provide health coverage for  today's baby
boomers when they retire. Similarly, unless Congress and  the states tackle the
spiraling growth in illegitimacy within the  context of true welfare reform,
America is headed for a social  catastrophe. And taking steps now to reform
America's inefficient and  costly tax system will give the American economy the
incentive it  needs to boost entrepreneurship, productivity, and wages so that 
Americans are not scrambling in the next century to catch up with  other
nations. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In 1995, Congress was prepared to tackle these and similar  issues of
enormous consequence to the future of the country. But  time 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 3 -->  and again, the new leadership was
thwarted, and  fundamental choices over policy were grossly caricatured by
opponents as  being &quot;for&quot; or &quot;against&quot; children, or the
elderly, or even  allowing visits to the Grand Canyon. The 1996 election is
likely to be  the only opportunity for some years to force a real national 
discussion over the historic challenges facing the nation, and so to resolve 
the impasse in Washington. Conservative candidates must seize  the opportunity
to debate the real choices for dealing with these  challenges.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>There are several particularly important domestic issues for  conservatives
to frame in the 1996 election. Among them:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><UL>
<li>     <B>Washington must balance its budget through real reductions
 in spending and reforms in the way government functions.
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Politicians in Washington promise to balance the budget  with about the same
eagerness as they pause to shake hands or kiss  babies. But only rarely are they
willing to take the serious  action needed to eliminate red ink. Congresses in
the past invariably  have passed budgets that use creative accounting to reach
balance  well into the future, but then have failed to make the changes in 
programs needed to achieve balance. On many such occasions,  Congresses have
combined phony spending controls with real  increases in taxes. But rather than
reach balance, the new tax  revenue merely reduced the political enthusiasm in
Washington  for making tough decisions on spending. This is why huge tax 
increases enacted under George Bush and Bill Clinton have  done virtually
nothing to bring the deficit under control.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Congress elected in 1994 sought to break this pattern by  proposing a budget that would reach
balance within seven years  while repealing about one-third of the Bush-Clinton
tax increases.  Unlike most Washington budgets, this one focused much more on 
real changes in programs, much less on gimmicks. Thus, the  budget legislation
passed by Congress in 1995 included structural  changes in Medicare, Medicaid,
and welfare, as well as the termination  of programs.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>President Clinton vetoed that legislation. Before and after that  budget
reached his desk, Clinton spent month after month  finding ways to avoid
offering a budget that would achieve the fiscal  responsibility he promised
during his election campaign.  Clinton's first set of budgets simply did not
even balance, and put off  policy decisions to achieve even modest spending
controls until into  the next century. As 1995 ended, the President seemed
content to  have no budget rather upset any constituency.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In the 1996 election, conservatives must make the case that  the budget must
be balanced and that it can be balanced only by  reducing the growth in
spending, not by raising taxes.  Conservatives also must make the argument that
the way to reduce the growth  of spending is not to squeeze good and bad
programs alike, but  by such actions as making tough changes in entitlements and
 terminating obsolete and inefficient programs and departments,  shifting
functions to the private sector that should not be in the public  sector.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><li>     <B>There must be structural changes in Medicare if the
program is  to exist for the next generation of retirees.
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>One of the most noticeable, and disturbing, trends in  federal 
spending in recent decades has
been the shift to entitlement  spending. According to the 1994 report of the
Bipartisan Commission  on Entitlement and Tax Reform, entitlement spending has 
consumed an increasing share of total federal spending, rising from 22.7 
percent of all spending in FY 1963 to over 47 percent in FY  1993. This means
that almost half of all federal spending is on  &quot;autopilot,&quot; driven by
statutory rights to certain services rather than  by budgets voted on each year.
Worse still, the largest  entitlements, including Medicare and Social Security,
are hopelessly out of  balance over the long haul. In particular, spending on
Medicare  is rising at such a clip that the program simply will have no money 
to pay any hospital benefits within six years. Already it is so out  of balance
that it is adding tens of billions of dollars each year to  the general budget
deficit, and this drain on the budget is projected  to rise sharply.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Congress elected in 1994 was the first since the major  entitlements
were created to address the runaway growth of  entitlements and to restructure
the programs to achieve better value for  money. The Balanced Budget Act of 1995
contained historic reforms  of several entitlements. It ended the entitlement to
welfare  and shifted the design and operation of welfare to the states. It 
ended the entitlement to Medicaid, again moving control of the  program to the
states. And it restructured the Medicare program, curbing  its rate of growth
and increasing competition and consumer choice  to improve efficiency and
achieve savings.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Clinton vetoed that legislation. According to the White House,  no decisive
action was necessary, and taking serious action  would hurt people. On Medicare,
the White House response was  merely to predict that Medicare growth would slow
down and to  offer tighter price controls on doctors and hospitals -- and to  denounce Congress's efforts as draconian and
anti-elderly.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In the election, conservative candidates need to point out that  most of
today's working-age voters will find literally nothing  in Medicare's hospital
trust fund with which to pay their  medical bills when they retire. So there is
a clear choice open to voters,  and candidates must press the public to make it:
Either voters can  send the message to Washington that they want to avoid doing 
anything, and let benefits be cut deeply and taxes raised sharply  sometime in
the future, or they can tell Washington they want  prudent steps taken now to
restore the finances of the system.  Candidates also must persuade voters to
face the fact that other  middle-class entitlements cannot be allowed to grow
unchecked if the  programs are to pay promised benefits to America's children
when  they reach retirement.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><li>     <B>There must be an end to welfare as we know it and a
national  strategy to reduce illegitimacy.
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>America has spent over $5 trillion in today's dollars fighting the War on Poverty -- more than on defeating Germany and Japan  in World War II. But as every
taxpayer and welfare mother  knows, the War on Poverty has been a ghastly
failure. Not only has  the poverty rate, for many years, shown no sign of
falling  significantly, but -- even more ominous -- the rate of illegitimacy  has
risen remorselessly. In the black community, two out of  every three children
today are born out of wedlock, and for the  general population one-third of
babies are born to mothers with no  husband. Studies show clearly that being
brought up in a  female-headed household is potentially very damaging to a
child.  Even 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 7 -->  liberals no longer dispute the
findings. Such things as high  levels of teenage crime, poor school performance,
and low future  earnings can be traced to the lack of a father in the home.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The new Congress agreed with President Clinton that welfare  as we know it
had to be ended and that urgent action was needed  to curb the dramatic rise in
illegitimacy. So Congress passed  legislation that would have begun the
transformation of welfare,  ending the entitlement nature of many federal
benefits, allowing the  states to make major changes in the design of programs,
and laying  down modest goals on work and illegitimacy for the states to 
achieve. But rather than sign the legislation, Clinton first criticized and 
then denounced it. His own proposal: limited authority to states,  a larger
welfare bureaucracy to &quot;help&quot; people to leave welfare  rather than
strong incentives to do so, and no real action to back up  the talk about
stemming the tide of illegitimacy. Virtually any effort  to discourage
illegitimate births was attacked by Clinton as  tantamount to child abuse.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The utter failure of the liberal welfare state, including the  explosion of
illegitimacy, is shredding America's social fabric. In  the 1996 election,
conservative candidates must urge Americans  to make a clear choice. They can
accept the arguments of those  who say that the only problem with the welfare
state today is that we  do not spend enough on it. According to this line of
argument,  what Congress should do is commit huge amounts of additional 
resources to child care, training programs, and other services to  enable
welfare mothers to become employable. This argument  is advanced most
vociferously by those who would be paid to  deliver the services.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The other option, conservatives should point out, is to move in  the
direction that Congress charted but Clinton vetoed. This  means facing up to the
obvious fact that spending more money on  welfare harms children rather than
helping them and destroys  families rather than strengthening them. The
conservative option is to  concentrate on reducing the rate of illegitimacy  the
root cause  of America's social problems  by discouraging  out-of-wedlock births
and reducing the burdens on two-parent families. In  addition, the conservative
option would give wide authority to states  to redesign programs while insisting
on clear national goals to  reduce illegitimacy and require work, and would
implement real  evaluations of state efforts. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> Further, conservatives must make the case that if poor  Americans are to be
held responsible for their actions, as other Americans  are held accountable,
they also must be given the power to take  responsibility. That means giving
poor Americans the same right  to choose the school that is right for their
child, through vouchers,  as the President of the United States enjoys. And it
means  enabling these Americans, through housing vouchers and the right to 
manage or own their own homes, to escape the crushing and  dangerous environment
of many public housing projects.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><li>     <B>It's time to reduce the tax burden on families with
children and  to introduce a flat tax.
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Americans have grown increasingly frustrated with the tax  code. Quite
correctly, they see it as complex and unfair, full of  loopholes for those with
the means or sophistication to exploit them. That  is why a simple, flat tax is
so attractive to so many voters. But  besides its mind-numbing complexity,
today's tax code has two  other 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 9 -->  severe deficiencies. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>One is that over the years the burden has shifted decisively  to families
with children. Because of the erosion, through  inflation, of exemptions and the
rise in Social Security tax rates,  families with children have faced an
increasing share of taxes when  compared with other groups. This has accentuated
the perverse  incentives of the welfare system and made it harder for 
middle-class families with children to make ends meet.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The other deficiency is the treatment of savings and  investment. The tax
code almost seems designed to discourage investment  and risk-taking by
subjecting saved income to multiple taxation.  The result: Saving has been
discouraged, and those who have  saved find the nest egg they accumulated for
themselves and their  children eaten away by the IRS.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Congress elected in 1994 tried to take the first steps to  correct these
problems. Concentrating on the most immediate problem -- the bias against
families with children  Congress enacted  legislation that would have given a
$500 credit per child to families  with children. This across-the-board credit
recognized that the  purpose of the original exemption for children was to
relieve all families  of taxation on income used to raise children. Congress
also  included in the legislation a reduction in the capital gains tax and the 
reduction of taxes on certain new forms of savings. Unfortunately,  despite
pledging a middle-class tax cut in 1992 and raising  taxes since then, President
Clinton vetoed the legislation, invoking  traditional class warfare arguments.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Conservatives need to use the 1996 election to frame the issue  of 
taxation. They need to argue that
the time for tinkering with  the tax code is over: What is needed is a new tax
system that is  simple and flat, taxes earnings only once, and redresses the
unfair tax  burden on families with children. Such a flat tax not only would 
bring back fairness and help ordinary working families, but it would  end the
tax penalties currently ranged against those Americans  who invest in the future
of their own children and that of the nation.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><li>     <B>The American economy is the world's most powerful engine 
of jobs and wealth creation. Washington should stop slowing  down that engine.
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>While it is natural for people to be concerned about their  economic future,
conservative candidates must not allow these concerns  to be channeled into bad
policies based on a phony reading of  history. This means that candidates must
remind voters of the  real nature and strength of the U.S. economy. And they
must  remind voters, too, that government can do little to improve on the 
workings of the free enterprise system, but much to damage it.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Many politicians play to fears of economic insecurity and  suggest that
ordinary working Americans are somehow the victims of  Wall Street greed or
underpriced foreign competition. Some of  these politicians go on to argue,
surprisingly, that Americans should  turn to the federal government to assure
their security and  economic well-being. Yet the facts refute the premise behind
this line of  argument, and hard-learned experience indicates that a more 
active federal government is no answer to insecurity. In particular, 
conservatives need to remind Americans that constant change is  the key to
America's traditional economic strength. That is  why America has created 46
million jobs since 1970, while Europe  has 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 11 -->  languished. And conservatives
must remind Americans that  the tough competition of international trade
sharpens efficiency  and brings prosperity to all Americans, while defeatist 
protectionism leads to long-run stagnation.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Nevertheless, the U.S. economy still has performed less well  than it could
for many years, and so has rewarded American  workers less well than it could.
There are three main reasons for this.  The first is that government has
increased the cost of hiring  Americans, through regulation and taxation, and
has taken more and more  out of each paycheck. This has meant fewer jobs than
otherwise  would have been created, especially for lower-skilled Americans. 
Over the last 20 years, for instance, regulation alone has probably  cost more
than three million jobs. The solution is deregulation and  reduced taxes on
labor  less government.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The second reason is that the shortcomings of the public  school system have
caused many Americans to lack the basic skills  they need to be productive, and
thus command good wages. This  government failure in basic education is not
corrected by  maintaining a public school monopoly, or by creating government
training  programs to try to correct the deficiencies of government schools. It 
is addressed by giving parents the power to demand better value  for money,
establishing real standards to enable parents to  evaluate schools, and ending
the public school monopoly.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The third reason is that the tax code's bias against saving and  investment
has slowed down the introduction of the new tools  and equipment in the economy
that workers need to be more  productive and earn higher wages. The solution to
this problem is to  reduce taxes on capital.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 12 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>This Congress has attempted to reduce these government  sources of long-term
drag on the U.S. economy. It has sought to  reduce capital gains taxes and taxes
on working Americans. It has tried  to eliminate regulations whose meager
benefits do not justify  the heavy cost in jobs. And it has encouraged states to
take the lead,  as they should, in overhauling the education system. 
Unfortunately, President Clinton has obstructed or vetoed all of these  efforts.
Meanwhile, he has fostered the enticing but false notion that  government can
provide an economic security blanket for all  Americans. To his credit, however,
Clinton has worked with the  new congressional leadership to resist
protectionism and reduce  worldwide barriers to trade.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Conservatives need to draw sharp lines in the debate over  the economy
during the election cycle. They must point out that  there are those who would
maintain  even increase  the current  burden on taxation and regulation on the
economy, and then seek  to expand government programs and protections to &quot;correct&quot;
the  apparent shortcomings of the economy. But this is the road to  stagnation,
not jobs and wealth. They must argue instead that the  only way to create jobs,
prosperity, and long-term security is to end  tax and regulatory policies that
hamper job creation and wage growth.
</UL>
<P>
</P>
<P>Other issues also must be raised in the 1996 election.  Americans need to be
presented with the clear choices that exist on such  issues as health care, the
environment, crime, education, and  congressional reform. In all these policy
areas, critical choices have  to be made  indeed, should have been made many
years ago.  Since the last election, the country has had a Congress willing to 
confront the choices and to take action, and a White House trying  to 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 13 -->  persuade the nation to cling to
the cozy illusion that no  hard choices need to be made. It is up to
conservatives during this  election season to make sure that Americans
understand this, and  that they are presented with the clear decisions that no
longer can  be avoided.

<P><B><A NAME="THE">The Issues</A></B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The goal of balancing the federal budget is no longer in question  in
Washington. Both Congress and (much more reluctantly)  President Clinton have
presented plans to balance the budget by FY  2002 that are certified by the
Congressional Budget Office. As with  any major corporation facing Chapter 11
bankruptcy, however,  balancing the books on paper is not the same as taking the
tough  actions needed to restore a failing institution to fiscal health. Even if
 Congress and the President reach a balanced budget agreement  in 1996, which is
by no means certain, the federal budget still  will fund hundreds of programs
that are obsolete, inefficient, or ripe  for privatization, or which should be
turned back to state and  local governments. Thus, the central budget issue for
the 1996  election should be how to restructure the government to meet the 
nation's needs in the 21st century. Such a debate will lay the  groundwork for
swift action by the 105th Congress in 1997 to downsize  and restructure the
federal government. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>If Congress and the President are serious about restructuring  the federal
government, they must challenge the substance of  every government program  top
to bottom  using three principles  to guide their work: 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 2 --> 
</P> 
<P>
</P>
<P><B>1. Federalism:</B> This means determining which activities are  the
responsibility of the federal government and which are best  done by state and
local governments.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>2. Privatization: </B>This means finding ways to transfer many 
activities now run  inefficiently or inappropriately  by government  to the more
effective and efficient private sector.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>3. Termination:</B> This means asking of every government  program:
Should the government be engaged in this activity at all?  Is  this program
outmoded, obsolete, inefficient, or broken beyond repair?   If the answer to any
of these questions is yes, then Washington  has an obligation to the taxpayers
to terminate the program.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Tinkering with the process of government will not cut  enough spending to
balance the budget; nor will it deliver the major  restructuring the government
needs. Making obsolete programs  process paperwork more efficiently is a waste
of taxpayers'  money. This is the major failing of Vice President Al Gore's
National  Performance Review, or &quot;Reinventing Government&quot; initiative. 
Taxpayers sent a clear message to Washington in 1994 that they do  not want
useless and obsolete programs to waste their money  more efficiently. They want
the budget to be balanced in a timely  fashion, and they want the result of this
effort to be a smaller,  less costly government.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Unfortunately, the Clinton Administration managed to cast  the 1995 budget
debate more as a struggle over the process of how  to balance the federal budget
on paper, without making any hard  decisions, than as a serious attempt to
define what the  government should look like once the budget is put in balance,
and what  was 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 3 -->  needed to reach that result. The
Balanced Budget Act of  1995, which passed Congress only to be vetoed by
President Clinton,  did contain many substantive policy changes to slow federal 
spending growth and turn some federal programs back to the states. But  in an
effort to force the President to compromise, even this did  too little to alter
the basic structure of government.
</P> 
<P>
</P>
<P>Lawmakers thus face many important challenges in the 1996  election period. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>First,</B> they must make the case for continuing to cut spending  
especially discretionary spending if a budget deal  significantly reforms
entitlement programs  to keep the budget on target  for balance in FY 2002; 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Second,</B> they must engage in a serious debate about what the  federal
government should look like once the budget is in balance  and how it should be
restructured to meet the needs of the next  generation of Americans; 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Third,</B> they must change the underlying structure of  entitlement
programs to prevent these programs from consuming ever  more tax dollars and
ever greater shares of the federal budget; and
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Fourth,</B> they must reform the budget process itself to reign  in
spending and bring accountability to how tax dollars are  spent. The current
budget process is a disaster and badly needs  reform.<B> </B>The President is
often a mere bystander, unable to exercise  much control of the nation's purse
strings except through the veto  once Congress has passed a budget. On the other
hand, spending  authority within Congress is highly diffuse across many
committees.  As 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 4 -->  a result, most Members of Congress
are on one or more  committees with the authority to spend money, but no one
Member is  responsible for how the money is spent. In order to rein in the 
government spending machine, conservatives must make the case  for reforming the
budget process.
</P> 
<P>
</P>
<P><B><A NAME="FACTS">THE FACTS</A></B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Balancing the federal budget is not a panacea for what ails the  federal
government or the national economy. It is simply one step  in returning fiscal
health to a decrepit institution and one element  in boosting economic growth.
To transform the federal  government from a relic of the past into a modern
institution, much more  needs to be done to slow the growth of federal spending,
especially  the uncontrollable portions of the budget known as entitlements,  or
mandatory spending. Also, the budget must be stripped of  programs that have
become outmoded, obsolete, broken beyond  repair, candidates for privatization,
or transfer to state or local  authority. And the process of crafting the budget
itself, which  now takes over a year from the time the White House begins its
work  to the time Congress puts the finishing touches on it, must be fixed  or
the first two priorities cannot be accomplished.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Moreover, balancing the budget and cutting taxes, as the  Balanced Budget
Act of 1995 (BBA) proposed to do, are not  competing ends. Cutting taxes is
central to boosting long-term  economic growth as spending is curbed to bring
the budget into balance.  To be sure, balancing the budget without tax cuts, as
some in  Congress have proposed, will produce higher economic growth  over the
long term than not balancing the budget would. But more  robust economic growth
is generated by a balanced budget plan  that 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 5 -->  includes tax cuts. Key to this
superior growth potential are tax  cuts to stimulate new investment and tax cuts
for families.
</P> 
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Spending Is the Problem</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Clinton Administration proudly claims that the 1993  Omnibus Budget
Reconciliation Act (OBRA 1993), which instituted  the largest tax increase in
U.S. history, produced three years of  continuous decline in the federal deficit
for the first time since  the 1950s. While the causal relationship between the
Clinton tax  increase and slightly falling deficits is questionable, one fact is
 certain: Tax increases do not lead to long-term deficit reduction.  As the
budget deals of 1982, 1984, 1987, and 1990 showed  clearly, tax increases lead
to higher federal spending, slower than  expected economic growth, and, not
surprisingly, higher deficits.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Recent Congressional Budget Office (CBO) figures show  that while the
deficit did decline from $255 billion in FY 1993 to  $161 billion in FY 1995, it
is now estimated that it will soar to  nearly $300 billion in ten years, or 83
percent higher than today.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Deficits are a symptom of a disease, and the disease is  spending. Thus, the
1995 budget debate was unlike every other effort  to eliminate the federal
deficit because it focused solely on  how much to slow the growth of spending.
There was no discussion  at all, even from liberals, of the &quot;need&quot; for
additional tax revenues  to close the deficit.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Recent CBO spending projections reveal how daunting the task  of controlling
spending really is. From FY 1995 to FY 2002, if  no changes are made in current
law, federal spending will balloon  by 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 6 -->  $582 billion, a 38 percent rise.
On average, CBO projects that  total federal spending will grow by 4.8 percent
per year through  2002. While discretionary, or appropriated, programs are
projected  to grow by some 14 percent over the next seven years, and net 
interest payments on the national debt by 16 percent, the reason for  the
explosion in federal spending is entitlement, or mandatory,  spending.
</P> 
<P>
</P>
<P><B>The Need to Control Entitlements</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>While the short-term projections of entitlement growth should  demand
lawmakers' attention, the long-term growth  projections should demand every
taxpayer's attention. If left  uncontrolled, entitlements will consume a greater
share of budgetary  resources, leaving less money for defense, education,
housing, national  parks, and other areas. But these areas also will continue to
consume  a larger share of the nation's resources. The result will be  stifled
economic growth, higher taxes on tomorrow's workers, and  reduced living
standards for every American.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>However, the impact of growing entitlements extends well  beyond the federal
budget. Unrestricted entitlements distort  individual behavior in many ways  for
example, by discouraging  self-help or even encouraging some beneficiaries to
choose leisure  over work. And growing entitlements distort political behavior
as  more and more Americans become members of an &quot;entitled class.&quot;  
Until recently, politicians have been more than willing to accept  deficit
spending to avoid making politically painful choices on  tax increases or
benefit cuts.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>What are entitlements?</B> According to the Congressional  Research 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 7 -->  Service (CRS), &quot;entitlements
are created by legislation that  requires the payment of benefits to any person
or unit of  government that meets the eligibility requirements established by
such  law.&quot; <TT><B><A HREF="ftnt1.htm#1">1</A></B></TT>
 Entitlements are part of a larger category of the budget called  mandatory
spending. Mandatory spending generally is any  spending that is not controlled
through the appropriations process,  including interest payments on the national
debt and deposit insurance. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>How many entitlement programs are there?</B> While there  are &quot;about
400 entitlement and mandatory spending accounts,&quot; it  is difficult to
answer this question because there is &quot;no clear  definition of what
constitutes a `program'.&quot;<TT><B><A HREF="ftnt1.htm#2">2</A></B></TT>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><CITE>-</CITE></B>     According to the CRS, &quot;the 19
programs with estimated FY  1993 outlays of $2 billion or more account for 97
percent of  entitlement spending. The large social welfare entitlement programs 
dominate mandatory spending  18 of the 19 largest programs are in  the social
welfare budget functions.&quot;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><CITE>-</CITE></B>     According to the 1994 report of the
Bipartisan Commission  on Entitlement and Tax Reform, headed by Senators Robert 
Kerry (D-NE) and John Danforth (R-MO, now retired), since the  early 1960s,
entitlement spending has consumed an increasing share  of total federal
spending, rising from 22.7 percent of all spending  in FY 1963 to over 47
percent in FY 1993. 
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><CITE>-</CITE></B>     In the short term, CBO projects
that if nothing is done to slow  the growth of entitlement programs, they will
grow in aggregate  by $465 billion over the next seven years, a 63 percent 
increase. Worse yet, CBO expects entitlements to consume 57 cents of  every
dollar spent by the federal government in 2002  over 8  cents 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 8 -->  more than is spent today.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE> 
<P>
</P>
<P>The long-term forecasts reported by the Kerry-Danforth  Commission are even
more troubling. These projections suggest that  entitlements will become a
liability that cannot be sustained by  the federal government, by the economy,
or by taxpayers.

<P><B>*     Entitlement programs defy good budgeting practices.</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The principles of sound budgeting and fiscal responsibility  require that
spending decisions be based on available resources. The  way current entitlement
programs are designed, with their  open-ended claim on the economy's resources,
violates this principle.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Sound budget measures would require that the eligibility criteria  of these
programs be driven by priorities and limits set by  Congress in the budget. But
today, the federal budget is being driven by  the eligibility criteria of
federal entitlements. The entitlement tail  wags the budget dog. The automatic
growth of these programs  forces higher taxes on American workers.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Deficit reduction should not be the primary goal of  entitlement reform. It
should be the result. These programs should be  reformed because there needs to
be a real decision about their scale,  their objectives, and how best to achieve
their goals. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Simple &quot;fixes&quot; are not the way to reform entitlements.  Sweeping
cuts without reforms, for instance, are akin to using wage  and price controls
to curb inflation. As history shows, price  controls and spending caps produce
the budgetary effects of clamping a  lid on a boiling pot. Nor is means-testing
itself a sound way to  curb the growth of mandatory programs, especially if tax
increases  are 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 10 -->  used as the primary tool for &quot;taking
benefits&quot; away from  upper-income recipients. Means-testing does nothing to
change the  fundamental problems with the program. The result is a broken 
program with fewer beneficiaries. 
</P> 
<P>
</P>
<P>Current entitlement programs also should be authorized  and funded on at
least a biannual basis. If necessary, a  commission should be created to balance
program eligibility and available  budgetary resources. Congress would vote on
such  recommendations at the beginning of every two-year cycle. Further, the 
government should have a mechanism for monitoring who is receiving  federal
assistance from all sources. For able-bodied individuals,  there should be a
lifetime limit on government assistance.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The principle of federalism suggests that programs should  be funded and
managed by the most effective level of  government. Many federal entitlement
programs, such as Medicaid and  welfare, have become expensive mandates to state
and local  governments. The long-term result of such mandates is an irrational
balance  of funding for programs that distort state government  decision-making.
Moreover, since states depend on federal dollars, they  have less incentive to
manage programs in the most efficient and  cost-effective manner.

<P>Entitlement programs undermine individual behavior in  various ways. While
the disastrous incentive effects of welfare on the  be
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 11 -->  havior of the poor are well
known, entitlement programs also  encourage the middle class to change their
behavior in ways that  are neither fiscally healthy nor socially desirable. The
fastest  growing portion of the Medicaid program, for example, is made up of 
the long-term costs of nursing care for the elderly &quot;poor.&quot;   However,
many middle-class seniors are simply divesting themselves of  their assets and
technically impoverishing themselves to become  eligible for Medicaid's generous
nursing home payments. Such  a scam may work to the benefit of a senior's
children   absolving children of the cost of caring for their parents  but
society  is much worse off as a result.

</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The federal government has become a monument to the needs  and priorities of
the 19th century, the Great Depression, World War  II, and the Great Society. No
amount of &quot;reinventing,&quot; as Vice  Presi
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 13 -->  dent Al Gore's National
Performance Review proposes, can  turn institutions created to address problems
the nation faced 30, 50,  or even 100 years ago into agencies capable of meeting
the needs  of Americans in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Most taxpayers would be stunned to learn how old many  federal programs and
agencies really are. Large segments of the  federal bureaucracy were created
decades ago for purposes long since  forgotten. It is time, for instance, to
strip out of the budget such  pre-World War II programs as the Rural
Electrification  Administration, the National Helium Reserves, Impact Aid, and
the  Agricultural Extension Service.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Many relatively new programs also have seen their missions  made obsolete by
technological and social changes. The Corporation  for Public Broadcasting,
international broadcasting programs such  as the Voice of America, Low-Income
Home Energy Assistance,  and the Department of Energy, for example, all are
outmoded or  irrelevant because of technological and market changes.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Because outmoded, obsolete, or inefficient programs almost  never die,
bureaus, agencies, and programs that duplicate each  other's functions have
sprung up all over the government. The  National Performance Review identified a
staggering degree of  duplication throughout the federal bureaucracy. For

<P><B>Why Tax Cuts Are Needed While Balancing the Budget</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Washington insiders, especially those within the White House  and 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 17 -->  some in Congress, argued
throughout 1995 that cutting taxes  was inconsistent with balancing the budget.
They claimed, for  instance, that tax cuts were not justified because Washington
could not  afford them while so much spending was being cut to balance  the
budget. Once the budget was in balance, they reasoned,  Americans could expect a
tax cut. This peculiar logic often gave taxpayers  the false impression that if
the tax cut package were dropped  from Congress's budget plan, Washington could
balance the  budget even sooner, say in five or six years rather than seven.
</P> 
<P>
</P>
<P>Such arguments are misleading at best and disingenuous at  worst. The
reasons:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>First,</B> the $245 billion tax cut package contained in the BBA  is
small; it amounts only to returning to taxpayers 2 cents of  every dollar that
would otherwise be collected by the federal  government over the next seven
years. This is hardly &quot;unaffordable,&quot;  considering that federal tax
collections are projected to total nearly  $11.5 trillion over the next seven
years. Moreover, the tax cut  package amounts to returning only one-third of the
tax increase  imposed during the Bush and Clinton presidencies.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Second,</B> if every dollar of tax cuts was eliminated from  Congress's
balanced budget plan, the budget would not balance any  sooner. Eliminating the
tax cut package, or reducing its size, would  only leave more money in the hands
of politicians and bureaucrats  to spend on programs taxpayers cannot afford and
do not even want.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>But one of the most important reasons for cutting taxes while  moving the
budget toward balance is that tax cuts significantly  increase potential
economic growth and allow millions of families and  in
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 18 -->  vestors to keep more of the money
they earn.
</P> 
<P>
</P>
<P>For example, last year economists at The Heritage  Foundation used one of
the principal econometric models of the U.S.  economy to project the economic
effects of the tax cut elements of the  congressional Balanced Budget Act. This
model (created by  Lawrence Meyer and Associates) is used by the Office of
Management  and Budget, the Congressional Budget Office, and the Federal 
Reserve Board. The analysis showed that:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><CITE>-</CITE></B>     The Balanced Budget Act with tax
cuts would have added  $112 billion more to gross domestic product (GDP) over
seven  years than the same plan without tax cuts.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><CITE>-</CITE></B>     The reduction in taxes on capital
(including capital gains tax  relief) accounts for $66 billion of this
additional GDP and leads to  a stronger economy in the long run.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P>Why is there such a large increase in economic activity when  tax cuts are
included in a balanced budget?  Initially, balancing  the budget requires the
government to reduce its role in the  economy. In the short term, this can slow
the economy, but returning  money to the private sector by means of the
$500-per-child tax credit  will help to offset these negative effects.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Moreover, tax cuts to spur investments (particularly cuts in  the capital
gains tax rate) increase economic growth in the long  run. Cutting taxes on
investments has two beneficial effects. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>First,</B> reducing the tax on capital gains lowers the cost of  moving
an investment from an average company to one that is  exception
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 19 -->  ally productive and well run.
This lowering of &quot;switching&quot;  costs means that investors will play a
larger role in promoting well  run, productive companies. Thus, the economy as a
whole is likely  to be more efficient. 
</P> 
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Second,</B> lower taxes on capital cause the cost of capital to  fall.
Lenders, for example, do not require quite as much interest  on their capital
loans in order to recoup the taxes they paid when  they made the capital
available to a borrower. Lower capital costs  usually mean more investment by
businesses in labor-saving  equipment, which commonly results in increased labor
 productivity. This increased productivity translates into higher wages  and,
through the wonders of the division of labor, more jobs.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>The Need for Budget Process Reform</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>While there are many reasons why federal spending is out of  control, and
why the political process seems helpless to stop it,  the process of making a
budget is a significant factor. The  modern explosion in federal spending began
shortly after the 1974  Budget Act was passed in the &quot;wake of the Watergate
scandal, when  regard for the institution of the presidency had reached its 
lowest ebb.&quot; <TT><B><A HREF="ftnt1.htm#18">18</A></B></TT>
 The 1974 Act stripped the President of his authority  to impound funds  that
is, to refuse to spend excessive  program funding appropriated by Congress  and
directed greater  spending authority to Congress.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>However, spending authority within Congress is highly  diffuse: Many
committees have the power to spend taxpayers' money,  but no one committee or
member is accountable for how it is  spent. Thus, the budget process is biased
toward increasing  spending, 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 20 -->  rather than toward setting
priorities. The key to bringing  accountability to the budget process is
therefore to shift greater  authority back to the President through such
measures as the line-item  veto and the Balanced Budget Amendment and to tighten
the rules  under which Congress goes about crafting the budget and  spending
money.
</P> 
<P>
</P>
<P>Contrary to popular belief, the federal budget is not a single  document.
Even the President's proposed budget, transmitted to  Congress each year,
usually incorporates four or five separate  volumes totaling thousands of pages.
The House and Senate must digest  the proposal and then generate their own
documents  at least  15 separate pieces of legislation  that outline their
proposal.  This ponderous process repeats itself each year.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The annual workload for Congress and the President includes  the initial
proposals from each side (the President's budget  submission and the
Congressional Budget Resolution), the 13  appropriations bills, and, when
necessary, a reconciliation bill to deal  with changes in tax and entitlement
policy. Often, &quot;emergency&quot;  or &quot;supplemental&quot; appropriations
bills are added mid-year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The 13 (or more) appropriations bills cover only 37 percent of  federal
spending. Remaining &quot;mandatory&quot; or entitlement spending  is addressed,
if at all, in a single reconciliation bill. This messy  process must be married
with &quot;authorizing&quot; legislation that may  determine how a program
spends money over two years, five years,  or indefinitely. The numerous steps in
the budget process make  it difficult to cut spending. Real spending cuts can be
derailed at  any of several steps.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 21 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>When considering the federal budget process, it is often best  to examine it
thematically. The key steps in the current process are:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Vision:</B> formulating a framework for the budget through 
the President's submitted budget and the congressional budget  resolution;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Authorization:</B> approving program details and maximum 
spending levels;
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Appropriation:</B> approving specific amounts of
discretionary  spending; and
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Reconciliation:</B> changing permanent tax and entitlement
law  to meet the requirements of the budget resolution.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Congress vs. President</B> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Unfortunately, Congress and the President act independently in  the most
important step in the whole process: establishing their  own vision and
framework for the budget details. The President  submits his budget proposal to
Congress at the start of each year to  establish his vision. Following the
President's submission in early  February, Congress outlines its vision by March
of each year  through what is known as the budget resolution. This sets 
Congress's spending priorities. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>At this stage in the process, neither branch's proposal needs  be approved
by the other branch. In most recent years, as was the  case in 1995, the visions
of the President and Congress differed  significantly. Under the existing
process, however, negotiations  between 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 22 -->  the two branches do not occur
until the end of the process   typically just before (or even after) the new
budget year begins   when a serious impasse often occurs. This happened late in 
1995 for the FY 1996 budget. 
</P> 
<P>
</P>
<P>The budget resolution is not signed by the President, so does  not have the
force of law. Congress then proceeds with the  authorization and appropriations
process. It is not until a reconciliation  bill is adopted by the House and
Senate, usually in the fall, that  the two branches even begin<U> </U>to
discuss their policy differences.  This often leads to a &quot;train wreck,&quot;
as was the case in 1995, in  which parts of the government shut down or operate
under stopgap  funding while Congress and the President try to work out their 
differences.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Authorizers vs. Appropriators </B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>It would be incorrect to assume that the only disputes in the  budget
process are those between the executive and legislative  branches. In fact, a
significant logjam can occur because of policy  differences among the budget
committee, authorizing committees,  and appropriations committees. The budget
committee drafts a  blueprint based on certain policy assumptions. Authorizing 
committees then are required to craft legislation setting out the 
responsibilities and maximum funding levels for a program with that  framework.
It is then the responsibility of the appropriating committees to  decide how
much to spend.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>This three-tiered process means that the people who decide  how much to
spend cannot decide how that money should be  spent. Similarly, the politicians
who set the policies for the program  have 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 23 -->  no meaningful control over its
funding. With policy decisions  divorced from spending decisions in Congress,
the likelihood  of ever-higher spending is increased. 
</P> 
<P>
</P>
<P>For example, the effort to eliminate the Commerce Department  in 1995
required action by 11 committees and 9 subcommittees,  including the House and
Senate Appropriations Committees,  the House and Senate Commerce Committees, and
the House  Government Reform and Oversight and Senate Governmental  Affairs
Committees. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>With a strong consensus among all these parties needed to  end government
programs, there is a clear bias against cutting  spending.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Entitlements vs. Nobody</B> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>While discretionary spending programs are subject to  multiple hurdles each
year, entitlements  which are mandatory  spending programs  operate on complete
auto-pilot. If Congress and  the President never passed another budget bill,
entitlement spending   which includes Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and 
welfare  would continue unchecked. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Two-thirds of the federal budget is consumed by mandatory  spending that
need not be approved annually by Congress or the  President. Leaving
entitlements without annual approval has  contributed to the dramatic increase
in mandatory spending as a  percentage of the federal budget. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The portion of the budget consumed by mandatory spending  has 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 24 -->  doubled since 1968. Mandatory
federal spending also represents  a significant force in the American economy.
More than one-tenth  of the nation's economy (10.7 percent of gross domestic
product)  is consumed by mandatory programs.
</P> 
<P>
</P>
<P>Entitlements can be addressed in the budget process, but  when they are, it
is done in a single bill called a reconciliation  bill, which often incorporates
permanent changes in tax law,  pitting entitlement reforms against tax policy.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Despite the major fiscal impact of entitlement spending, there is  no
established process for Congress and the President to review  these expenditures
regularly. The Congress spends more than half  the year focusing on how to spend
one-third of the federal  budget, with far less attention paid to the other
two-thirds.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Previous Reforms.</B> Budget crises in 1986, 1988, and 1990  were met by
specific spending agreements coupled with budget  process reforms. Because
reforms left the flawed budget process  largely intact, however, the agreements
held only for a couple of years,  to be followed by new crises when economic or
political  conditions changed.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The most significant of these reforms, the  Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act,
required automatic, across-the-board spending  cuts (called a sequester) if
Congress failed to meet the deficit  targets prescribed in law. Gramm-Rudman was
successful in  reducing small differences between projected and prescribed
deficit  targets, but it broke down when the deficit became so large in 1990 
that Members of Congress refused to allow an automatic spending  cut to take
effect.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 25 --> 
</P> 
<P>
</P>
<P>The 1990 budget deal scrapped Gramm-Rudman and  instituted statutory caps on
discretionary spending. But these have been  adjusted numerous times, so they
have served as little more  than &quot;speed limits&quot; on the spending
expressway, since they were set  far above anticipated spending growth rates.
Moreover, since  they focused only on discretionary spending totals, ignoring 
fast-growing entitlement spending, these caps have had limited effect  in
bringing down the deficit.

certified   at least on paper  that this new proposal would balance the  budget
by 2002. Closer review of this plan shows that, as with the  four previous
plans, the White House was not serious about either  balancing the budget or
providing meaningful tax relief. It  seemed interested only in finding ways to
spend more taxpayer  dollars while appearing to agree that the budget should be
balanced.

<P><B> Clinton Budget #1: 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 26 --> 
</B>
</P> 
<P>
</P>
<P>In February 1995, the Clinton Administration responded to  the 1994 election
results by presenting a status-quo FY 1996 budget  to the new Congress. This
budget deviated little from &quot;baseline&quot;  forecasts which projected $200
billion deficits through the end of  the decade. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>According to CBO, the President's February budget would  increase the
deficit from an estimated $177 billion in 1995 to  $276 billion in 2000.
Spending would grow an average of 5 percent  per year, some $422 billion in all
in just five years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The February Clinton budget was not all bad, however. It did  propose a few
modest privatization initiatives, such as selling  the Power Marketing
Administrations, portions of the Strategic  Petroleum Reserves, the Naval
Petroleum Reserves, and portions of  the National Weather Service. It also
proposed terminating a  few small programs and consolidating some 270 programs
into 27  new programs. Best of all, the budget proposed a &quot;Middle Class
Bill  of Rights&quot; which included a modest $300-per-child tax credit  for
families with children below age 13 who earn less than  $60,000 per year. But
the Administration did little to fight for any of  these proposals.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>On May 19, the Senate defeated Clinton's budget plan by a vote  of 99 to 0.

<P><B>Clinton Budget #2:</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>On June 13, 1995, after months of criticizing congressional  bal
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 27 -->  anced budget efforts while
offering no plan of his own,  Clinton presented a second budget plan which he
claimed balanced  the budget in ten years, by FY 2005. 
</P> 
<P>
</P>
<P>This Clinton plan, barely 30 pages in length, fared no better  than his
first effort under CBO scrutiny. According to CBO, in  addition to not balancing
the budget, this plan would produce $200  billion deficits for at least the next
ten years.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The second budget plan also included the modest tax cut for  families with
children in addition to tax deductions for higher  education and expanded
Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs).
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Due to revised economic forecasts, the Administration later  said that this
plan would balance the budget in nine years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>However, the CBO maintained that it would never balance  the budget. Indeed,
CBO found less than $400 billion in  legitimate deficit reduction in this
Clinton offer  $350 billion short of  the total seven-year deficit reduction in
the Balanced Budget Act.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Clinton Budget #3:</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>On December 7, the day Clinton vetoed the Balanced Budget  Act of 1995, he
presented yet a third budget plan. The  Administration claimed that this plan
also would balance the budget in seven  years but was more in line with the
President's priorities than the one  he had vetoed.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Once again, CBO found that the Administration's numbers  failed 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 28 -->  to reach a balanced budget by
2002. While this budget plan  proposed larger savings from discretionary
spending programs  and welfare reform compared to the June budget, it also 
proposed smaller savings in Medicare and Medicaid. In total, Clinton's  third
budget produced only $385 billion in credible deficit  reduction over seven
years  $365 billion short of the savings achieved  by the BBA he had vetoed.
Moreover, according to the CBO,  instead of balancing the budget in FY 2002 as
advertised, it would leave  a deficit of $115 billion in that year.
</P> 
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Clinton Budget #4:</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>On December 15, after two weeks of negotiations with  congressional leaders,
Clinton presented a fourth budget plan. But  this plan was mostly an iteration
of Budget Plan #3 and contained  no new policy recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The CBO scored this plan as $69 billion out of balance in  FY 2002. The
Administration tried to make up its shortcomings  in reducing the deficit by
challenging CBO technical and  economic estimates. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Administration had been arguing for weeks that CBO's  economic
assumptions were too conservative and thus required  excessively deep spending
cuts to balance the budget. In making  this argument, the Administration wanted
to have it both ways.  While claiming that it wanted to balance the budget, it
actually wanted  to spend more money as the budget was moving toward balance.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>On December 18, the House defeated this plan by a vote of 412  to 0.

<P><B>Clinton Budget #5:</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>On January 6, 1996, Clinton presented a fifth budget plan.  This plan,
largely adapted from a proposal by Senate Democrats,  was certified by CBO to
balance the budget in seven years, at least  on paper. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>It is likely that Clinton never would have submitted this plan had  it not
been for the conditions Congress included in the  continuing resolution passed
on January 5, 1996. These conditions  stipulated, in effect, that a bill to
provide operating funds for  unappropriated federal programs through January 26
would not be sent to  the President until he submitted a seven-year balanced
budget  plan scored by the CBO. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Though it mathematically balances the budget in seven years,  the fifth
Clinton budget falls far short of being a credible plan.  The reasons:

<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>In the fifth Clinton budget, most of the heavy lifting of
deficit  reduction is required in the two years following the end of  Clinton's
possible second term as President. Indeed, 62 percent of the  plan's $583
billion in deficit reduction falls in FY 2001 and FY 2002.  For example, the
plan called for $102 billion in Medicare savings  over seven years, but 63
percent of these savings are to come in the  last two years. Similarly, the plan
called for $37 billion in  discretionary spending cuts beyond the savings needed
to achieve a  &quot;hard freeze&quot; in these programs, yet 95 percent of these
additional  savings fall in the last two years of the plan.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 30 -->

<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>While the fifth Clinton budget plan called for $87 billion in 
gross tax cuts ($17 billion in net tax cuts) over seven years, these  cuts are
sunsetted in FY 2001  one year before the budget is  balanced. This means taxes
would have to be raised. Mathematically, such  a ploy &quot;boosts&quot; tax
revenues by at least $15 billion in FY 2002  and thus requires fewer spending
cuts to achieve a balanced  budget. The overall size of the tax cut proposal is
reduced by the  plan's call for $60 billion in new revenue from closing &quot;corporate
 loopholes.&quot;  Some 43 percent of the revenues generated from these  tax
hikes would be received in FY 2002.

<P><B>Clinton Budget #6:</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The sixth Clinton budget was submitted on January 9. This  sixth budget plan
in a year moved only slightly beyond the  previous plans, modestly increasing
the proposed savings from  Medicare, Medicaid, and welfare reform while slightly
boosting the size  of the tax cuts. Overall, this Clinton plan would produce
nearly  $160 billion less in budget savings than the last congressional offer 
and nearly $70 billion less in deficit reduction. Moreover, the  White House
still avoided the fundamental reforms in Medicare,  Medicaid, and welfare needed
to achieve budget savings and  restructure the programs.

<P><B> Clinton Budget #7</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The seventh Clinton plan was submitted to Congress on  January 18. This
budget plan was essentially identical to the January 9  plan except that it
substantially increased the amount of new revenues  it 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 31 -->  would generate from closing &quot;corporate
tax loopholes&quot; and  other such devices. Because of these new revenues, the
net size of  the tax cut would be reduced to a mere $36 billion over seven
years.

<P>
</P>
<P><B>Clinton Budget #8: The FY 1997 Budget</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Like the seven budget plans that preceded it during the past  year, the FY
1997 Clinton budget, presented to Congress February  5, would force hard-working
Americans to pay higher taxes in  exchange for more spending on programs which
have become  old and obsolete, or which are ripe for termination, privatization,
 or transfer to state control. Moreover, each plan ignores the  fundamental
problems facing the government's major entitlement  and welfare programs.
Clinton has shirked his responsibility to  address, for instance, a Medicare
program facing insolvency, a  Medicaid program that is bankrupting state
budgets, and a welfare  system that perpetuates a culture of poverty.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Repeated gimmicks and ploys such as these cast suspicions on  the Clinton
Administration's sincerity in negotiating a balanced  budget plan with Congress.
At every turn, Clinton fought attempts  to cut spending or even reduce the
growth rate of spending.  Clinton challenged CBO's conservative economic
assumptions  because they required greater savings to balance the budget. In 
other words, he wanted more money for favored programs while  claiming to
support balancing the budget. Clinton repeatedly called  on Congress to reduce
the size of the BBA's tax cut package, not  because eliminating the tax cuts
would balance the budget any  faster (say in five years rather than seven), but
because smaller tax  cuts would allow more money for government spending. The
record  is 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 32 -->  clear: Bill Clinton prefers
keeping money in the hands of  Washington bureaucrats to keeping it in the
pockets of American  taxpayers.
</P> 
<P>
</P>
<P><B>The Negotiations Stalemate</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>By mid-January, the negotiations between Congress and the  White House had
reached a stalemate. Yet the job for both parties  of reaching a balanced budget
in seven years had been aided  considerably by CBO's December revised economic
forecast,  which showed that $135 billion less in spending cuts would be needed 
to balance the budget by 2002. Congressional leaders quickly  offered to reduce
their proposed savings from programs such as  Medicare and Medicaid in an
attempt to move toward common ground  with the President. In this offer,
congressional negotiators also  reduced the proposed size of the tax cut package
to $177 billion net  from $218 billion net. But this counter-offer made little
sense;  millions of families could be denied needed tax relief as billions of 
dollars more is spent on government programs they do not want.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>For all intents and purposes, congressional negotiators broke  off talks
with the White House after sensing that Clinton was not  serious  and, perhaps
never had been  about reaching an accord  to balance the budget.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>THE 104TH CONGRESS</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In 1995, the new Congress swiftly fulfilled the centerpiece of  the Contract
with America by drafting and then passing a  comprehensive plan to balance the
budget in seven years while providing  tax 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 33 -->  cuts to help families and spur
economic growth. The  Balanced Budget Act of 1995 was vetoed by President
Clinton, but it  nevertheless marked a dramatic reversal of Washington's &quot;business
 as usual&quot; attempts to deal with budget deficits. Though  Clinton signed
the largest tax increase in U.S. history just two years  ago, tax increases were
never suggested as a necessary element of  deficit reduction  even by the most
liberal members of Congress.  The dominant issues during the 1995 budget debate
were how to  curb the rampant growth of federal spending and how much tax 
relief should be given to hard-working American families. 
</P> 
<P>
</P>
<P>As the year progressed, however, the new Congress's vision  of downsizing
the federal government and returning power and  resources to taxpayers and the
states was overshadowed by the  central issue of balancing the budget within
seven years. Thus,  many of the bolder reforms and initiatives contained in the
early  budget blueprints were watered down or abandoned in the battle with  the
Clinton White House. As the debate wore on into 1996,  voters' 1994 election
mandate to rein in the federal government took  a back seat to the &quot;green
eyeshade&quot; math involved in reaching a  balanced budget agreement.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>The House Budget</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>On May 18, 1995, the House of Representatives, spurred by  73 freshman
Members, by a vote of 238 to 193 passed its  sweeping budget blueprint  formally
known as the budget resolution   to balance the budget in seven years while
providing over $350  billion in tax cuts to help families with children, to help
seniors,  and to spur economic growth. The blueprint called for $1.13 trillion 
in total spending cuts over seven years and, after netting out the  tax 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 34 -->  cuts, over $970 billion in
deficit reduction over the same period. 
</P> 
<P>
</P>
<P>Many of the bolder proposals contained in the House budget  resolution were
generated by freshmen Members. Indeed, with the  encouragement of the House
leadership, a cadre of freshmen  developed serious plans to close four Cabinet
agencies: the  Departments of Commerce, Energy, Education, and Housing and Urban
 Development. The abolition of three of these agencies (Commerce,  Energy, and
Education) was incorporated into the final plan.

<P>
</P>
<P>Though ambitious by Washington standards, the Senate  plan (which passed on
May 25 by a vote of 57 to 42) fell short of  advancing the bold proposals
contained in the House blueprint.  For example, the Senate plan proposed closing
only the Department  of Commerce even though Majority Leader Robert Dole (R-KS) 
became an active supporter of the House freshman effort to  close four Cabinet
agencies. In fact, some Senators wanted to go  beyond 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 36 -->  the House effort and developed
proposals to close two  additional agencies: the Departments of Transportation
and Labor.
</P> 
<P>
</P>
<P>The most disappointing aspect of the Senate plan was the  absence of
specific tax cuts. The Senate plan allowed for unspecified  tax cuts for
families and economic growth only if CBO certified  that the plan would balance
the budget in seven years. Once this  certification had been made, tax cuts
could be financed with the  $170 billion economic windfall, or &quot;Fiscal
Dividend,&quot; the CBO  estimated would accrue to the government from lower
interest  rates and the increased tax revenues generated by higher  economic
growth.

<P><B>Completing the Balanced Budget Plan</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The task of producing the final balanced budget plan  proceeded along two
fronts: the appropriations process (funding  particular agencies and programs)
and the authorization process  (changing such things as tax laws and
entitlements to conform to  spending goals). Specifically, the appropriations
committees in the  House and Senate are responsible for drafting the 13
appropriations  bills that fund the day-to-day operations of the government. The
 authorizing committees, including the House Ways and Means  Committee and
Senate Finance Committee, are charged with  making changes in permanent law
affecting entitlement programs and  tax policy. By law, Congress must complete
all of its work on the  bud
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 38 -->  get by September 31, before the
fiscal year begins on October 1. 
</P> 
<P>
</P>
<P>Congress faced many serious questions as it undertook this  enormous task.
Would the budget, for instance, be completed on time?   If appropriations bills
are not completed by the end of  September, government programs must shut down
due to a lack of funds.  This scenario later became known as the first &quot;train
wreck.&quot;  Also,  Congress needed to pass the reconciliation bill, which
makes  the changes in permanent law, by mid-November when the  government was
expected to exhaust its legal authority to borrow  money. If the permanent debt
ceiling was not increased in time, the  Treasury faced the possibility of
defaulting on its loan payments  and not having the funds available to pay
Social Security benefits.  This became known as the second &quot;train wreck.&quot;
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>However, conservatives  including most House freshmen   had other concerns
as well. For instance, would the  appropriations committees follow through on
the bolder proposals in the  House budget resolution to overhaul and terminate
some programs,  privatize others, and send many back to the states?  Also, many 
worried about the commitment of the Ways and Means and Finance  Committees to
tax cuts. Though the budget resolution  recommended $245 billion in tax cuts to
help families and promote  economic growth, Ways and Means and Finance are not
obligated to  follow its recommendations. The question became, would the &quot;tax
 writers&quot; become the &quot;tax cutters&quot;?

<P>
</P>
<P><B>The Appropriations Bills: &quot;The 10% Revolution&quot; </B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The balanced budget outline passed by Congress in May 1995  required that
annually appropriated spending be reduced by $24  bil
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 39 -->  lion, or nearly 10 percent. But,
with only a few notable  exceptions, rather than meet these spending goals by
overhauling  domestic programs, terminating obsolete agencies, privatizing 
commercial functions, and transferring non-federal functions to the states,  the
104th Congress chose a &quot;salami-cut&quot; approach to  restructuring
government. In other words, Congress shaved relatively  equal amounts from all
programs in order to achieve the savings  required by the balanced budget
outline, which means that most of the  appropriations bills continue the status
quo, albeit at reduced  spending levels.
</P> 
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Example:</B> </P>
<P></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>The appropriations bill for the Departments of  Commerce,
Justice, and State would have spent $27.3 billion in  fiscal year 1996, an
increase of 2 percent over the previous year.  President Clinton vetoed this
bill on December 19, 1995. Little  progress was made in eliminating the
Department of Commerce.  Moreover, the Economic Development Administration, a
perennial source  of funding for purely local projects, was granted $349
million.  The Small Business Administration, which as early as 1963 was 
described by <I>Life</I> magazine as a &quot;device for soaking up money  and
getting rid of it,&quot; <B><TT><A HREF="ftnt1.htm#19">19</A></TT></B>
was appropriated $590 million. But the bill  did take some positive steps. For
example, the Advanced  Technology Program  corporate welfare and industrial
planning at its  most blatant  would have been eliminated. The bill also would 
have converted the cops-on-the beat program into a block grant to  localities to
allow flexibility in fighting crime.

<BLOCKQUOTE><P>The appropriations bill for the Department of  Energy and
various water development projects spends $19.7 billion  in fiscal year 1996, a

of Engineers, a favorite  source 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 40 -->  of funding for local pork-barrel
projects, received a mild cut of  5.6 percent. This still left plenty of money
to fund such efforts as  the $304,000 investigation of the Upper Trinity River
basin in  Texas; the $4.4 million beach erosion project in Sarasota County, 
Florida; and the $100,000 beach erosion project in  Surfside-Sunset-Newport
Beach, California. Only 18 percent was cut from the  Department of Energy's
Energy Supply, Research and Development  program. Since 1977, the federal
government has spent over $70  billion in today's dollars on this program and
has little or nothing  to show for it.

And the $934 million  Cooperative State Research Service is cut by only 3
percent. This  mild reduction left room for such spending as $220,000 for 
lowbush blueberry research in Maine, $1.2 million for potato research,  and
$395,000 for rice modeling in Arizona.

<P>The record of the Reagan Administration's proposals to  terminate programs
shows that simply reducing the budgets of such  wasteful programs as these 
instead of terminating them outright   leaves the door open for future
Congresses to boost their funding and  thus return the government to the path of
increasing deficits and  burdensome taxes. This happens because a bureaucracy is
left in  place to work with interest groups toward the re-instatement of 
funding. According to the Congressional Research Service, 94  programs were
recommended for termination during the two  Reagan terms.<TT><B><A

<P><B>The Balanced Budget Act of 1995</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Contrary to liberal rhetoric, the Balanced Budget Act of 1995,  as passed by
Congress on November 17 and vetoed by  President Clinton on December 6, did not
slash spending to the bone. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Had the Balanced Budget Act (BBA) been signed into law,  federal spending
would have slowed from an average projected rate of  4.8 percent per year
through 2002 to an average of 2.76 percent  per year  roughly the average rate
of inflation. However, over  the 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 43 -->  next seven years, total federal
spending would have grown by  21 percent, or $318 billion, from $1.518 trillion
in FY 1995 to  $1.836 trillion in FY 2002  the year the budget is to be in
balance.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Driving this spending growth, even under a balanced  budget scheme, is
the rapid growth of entitlement programs. 
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Under the BBA, overall mandatory spending was allowed to  grow by $341
billion over the next seven years, a 46 percent  increase. On average, mandatory
spending would grow by 5.6 percent  per year. Contrary to White House charges of
Congress's &quot;deep  cuts&quot; in entitlement programs, the share of the
budget devoted to  this uncontrollable spending would grow from 48 percent of
all  federal spending in FY 1995 to 58 percent in FY 2002, even if the  BBA
effected needed reforms in Medicare, Medicaid, and welfare  programs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The only category of federal spending that would have  declined under the
BBA is discretionary, or annually appropriated,  spending. The BBA would have
reduced aggregate spending for  these programs from $546 billion in FY 1995 to
$515 billion in  FY 2002, or 5.6 percent. However, these modest cuts are &quot;scored&quot;
 by CBO as totaling $408 billion in savings over seven years. How  can this be? 
Nearly 55 percent of these savings, or $258 billion,  comes from &quot;freezing&quot;
aggregate discretionary spending at 1995  levels for seven years. Because CBO
assumes spending to grow,  spending the same amount as the previous year &quot;saves&quot;
money. The  remaining $151 billion in savings represent real cuts in  spending,
meaning that less money will be spent in future years than today.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The BBA contained $245 billion in gross tax cuts, or $218  billion 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 44 -->  in net cuts after deducting the
$27 billion in revenues  generated from closing special tax breaks for certain
corporations and  industries. Though often criticized by the media and the 
Washington elite, the tax cut plan actually is rather modest. Overall, it 
promises to return to taxpayers roughly 2 percent of the $11.5 trillion in  tax
revenues the government expects to collect over the next  seven years. 
</P> 
<P>
</P>
<P>As Table 5 shows, the tax cut plan is targeted largely to  families, though
the pro-growth tax cuts would have a substantial impact  on spurring new
investments and jobs. Highlights of the tax cut  plan include:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Tax Cuts for Families.</B> A full 65 percent of the overall
tax  cut package was targeted to families, especially families with  children.
The &quot;crown jewel&quot; of the congressional plan was the  $500-per-child
tax credit benefiting 28 million families raising 51  million children. Also
included was a gradual increase in the standard  deduction for couples filing
jointly as a modest way of alleviating  the marriage penalty. The plan also
contained a substantial  $5,000 adoption credit and a $1,000 deduction for
families who care  for elderly family members.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Tax Cuts for Jobs and Economic Growth.</B> The remaining 35
 percent of the tax cut package was targeted to spurring jobs and  economic
growth. The centerpiece of the pro-growth tax cuts  was capital gains tax
reform. The effective capital gains rate for  individuals would be cut in half 
19.8 percent would be the top rate   and the corporate rate would be set at 28
percent. The plan  would have promoted savings by creating a new &quot;American
Dream  IRA,&quot; or back-loaded Individual Retirement Account. Taxpayers  could

<!-- Generation of PM publication page 45 -->  contribute to these accounts
using post-tax dollars, but  withdrawals would be tax-free. The plan also
included reforms in the  Alternative Minimum Tax (ATM) and taxes on estates and
gifts.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE> 
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Tax Cuts to Promote Health Care Independence.</B> The tax
cut  plan included two small but important tax provisions to help  seniors with
health care costs. The first provision would have given  more favorable tax
treatment to long-term care insurance, in the  same way other health care
insurance is treated. The plan also  would have allowed tax-free treatment for
terminally ill individuals  who cash out their life insurance plans.

<P><B>LESSONS LEARNED FROM THE GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWNS</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>There was a great deal of speculation during the summer of  1995 about
whether there would be a &quot;train wreck,&quot; or general  shutdown of the
government, in the fall. &quot;Train wreck&quot; is really a  generic term since
there are two basic ways in which government  spending could come to a halt in
any given year:
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 47 --> 
</P> 
<P>
</P>
<P><B>1. Government programs lack the authority to spend, or
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>2. The Treasury lacks the authority to borrow money to  finance
government spending.
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Each scenario has interesting yet important nuances. By law,  the
appropriations bills must be passed by Congress and signed by  the President by
October 1 of each year. If a bill is not approved  by that date, programs within
its jurisdiction must cease  operations. Entitlement programs such as farm
programs, Social Security,  and Medicare, however, continue at current levels
because their  spending levels do not require annual appropriations.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>What happens if appropriations bills are not approved?
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>SCENARIO #1: </B>Congress passes a continuing resolution. 
What has happened most often in previous budget stalemates is  that Congress
passes a continuing resolution (CR) to fund  appropriated government programs at
the previous year's spending levels until  a compromise between Congress and the
White House is reached.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>SCENARIO #2:</B> Essential programs continue through 
executive powers. The now-famous Civiletti interpretation of the  &quot;Anti-Deficiency
Act,&quot; named after former Attorney General  Benjamin Civiletti, outlined to
Jimmy Carter in 1981 how the President  can continue &quot;essential
expenditures in cases of imminent  emergency, to protect lives or property.&quot;<TT><B><A
HREF="ftnt1.htm#21">21</A></B></TT>  This authority by most 
accounts includes &quot;essential workers&quot; performing such functions as 
White House and congressional duties; Defense, Coast Guard, and  FBI/police
functions; meat and poultry inspection; and Air  Traffic Control. Since this
power rests with the President, it is difficult  for 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 48 -->  the White House to argue that
Congress is responsible when  meat inspections, for example, are halted.

</P>
<P><B>The Shutdowns of 1995</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>There were two general shutdowns of the federal government  during the
budget debate of 1995-1996. The first showdown  between Congress and President
Clinton occurred when Congress failed  to approve all 13 appropriations bills by
the October 1 deadline.  An immediate shutdown was averted, however, when
Congress  passed on September 29, and Clinton signed a day later, a short-term 
continuing resolution bill to fund government programs through  November 15. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>When talks between Congress and the White House broke  down before the
November 15 deadline, Congress passed another  short-term spending bill which
the President vetoed on November  13. This veto brought on the first general
shutdown, which lasted  six days. Nearly 800,000 people  about one-third of all
federal  workers  were furloughed. Essential workers remained on the job,  but
without pay (though congressional leaders assured  furloughed workers that they
all would receive back pay). Also on the job,  but with pay, were workers in
agencies whose funding bills had  been passed and signed by Clinton. These
included some  Pentagon workers and employees within the Departments of 
Agriculture, Transportation, and Energy.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The second  a partial shutdown and the longest federal  shutdown in history 
lasted from December 16, 1995, until January 6,  1996. This time, rather than
send the President a new continuing  resolution, congressional leaders decided
to send him the actual  appro
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 49 -->  priations bills for the remaining
unfunded portions of the  government. <TT><B><A
HREF="ftnt1.htm#22">22</A></B></TT>  The shutdown occurred
because Clinton vetoed the  bills funding the departments of the Interior,
Veterans Affairs,  Housing and Urban Development, Commerce, State, and Justice. 
Approximately 280,000 federal workers were sent home during this  second
shutdown.
</P> 
<P>
</P>
<P><B>The Shutdown's Limited Impact</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Most media attention during the shutdowns was focused on  federal workers
who were left temporarily without a  paycheck, <TT><B><A
HREF="ftnt1.htm#23">23</A></B></TT> companies closing because
of a lack of government contracts, and  &quot;innocent&quot; travelers shut out
of national parks and museums.  However, lost in the media coverage was the
silver lining: a glimpse into  an America with a limited federal government.
Lawmakers and  citizens alike should look carefully at the lessons to be learned
 from such a large-scale federal government closure.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Lesson:</B> As the Chief Executive, it was Clinton who 
determined which agencies and government employees were deemed  essential,
meaning those most directly involved in protecting the lives  and property of
American citizens. The President's choices, then,  are telling because they
indicate exactly where the true priorities  of the federal government lie. These
choices are also ironic in light  of Clinton's claim that he vetoed the Balanced
Budget Act of  1995 because it was too harsh on education, the environment, and 
housing. During the second shutdown, the Administration decided  large portions
of these same programs were &quot;non-essential.&quot;

<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Lesson:</B> Most taxpayers are unaware that many federal 
functions halted during the shutdowns were quickly assumed by the  private
sector or state governments. The competence shown by these  private and public

an excellent indication of why  they should be privatized or transferred to
local government control.

<P><B>The Debt Crisis Showdown</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The second showdown occurred over the issue of increasing  the $4.9 trillion
legal debt ceiling (last increased in 1993), which  was to be done by November
15. On November 9, Congress passed  a short-term increase in the debt ceiling,
but with certain  conditions such as terminating the Department of Commerce and
a  prohibition against divesting retirement funds to cover government  debt.
Clinton vetoed this bill on November 13, throwing into  question the ability of
the Treasury to make interest payments on  government debt and, possibly,
December Social Security checks.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Generally speaking, if the debt ceiling is not statutorially  increased, the
Treasury runs out of authority to borrow money  to fund spending not covered by
tax revenues. In other words,  the government is forced to operate more or less
on a cash basis.  Treasury then must fund programs out of tax and fee revenues
or  employ a variety of techniques to stretch its borrowing ability. It  has
managed as long as 30 days on a cash basis, Congress in  most years passes
temporary debt increases (six during the 1990  budget deal alone) to get
Treasury through the negotiations.

<P>
</P>
<P>Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin avoided the possibility of  default during
the November 1995 crisis by disinvesting the Civil  Service Retirement and
Disability Trust Fund. He justified this action  by cleverly interpreting a
section of the Civil Service  Retirement Trust Fund Act<TT><B><A
HREF="ftnt1.htm#31">31</A></B></TT> to allow the U.S.
Treasury to take  Treasury bonds out of that trust fund. Moving Treasury bonds
out of  the Civil Service trust fund reduced the debt to below the legal  limit,
thus enabling the Treasury to sell additional bonds to the public.  If Rubin
chose to tap the entire $375 billion in this trust fund,  it would be adequate
to sustain this financing trick until May 1997.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Many Members of Congress have challenged the  Treasury 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 54 -->  Secretary's interpretation of the
law and are looking at ways  to close the loophole, which they say undermines
Congress's  power to set a federal debt limit. Moreover, many fear that Rubin 
could fund the government indefinitely by raiding other trust funds.  The
federal government maintains a number of special trust funds  to hold and invest
certain kinds of special payments, such as  Social Security, motor fuel tax
receipts, and airline ticket taxes, as well  as the Civil Service funds.
</P> 
<P>
</P>
<P>The U.S. government bonds, in which money paid to these  trust funds is
invested, have always been counted as part of the  national debt that Congress
could control by setting a statutory limit.  But the legal interpretation
advanced by the Treasury Secretary is  that the government owes this money to
itself, and the &quot;investment&quot;  of the trust fund balances in Treasury
bonds is not real. It is only  a convenient fiction used by the Treasury to
compute periodic  interest payments to the trust funds, so the Secretary is free
to  disinvest from the trust funds and sell new bonds to the public.

<P>THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The White House worked actively to kill the Balanced  Budget Amendment by
convincing Senators who previously had voted  in favor of it to reverse their
positions at the last minute. During  his February 25, 1995, radio address,
Clinton claimed the  amendment is an &quot;extreme fiscal policy&quot; that &quot;in
its most exaggerated  form, [is] what helped to turn the economic slow-down of
the 1920s  into the great depression of the 1930s.&quot;
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 55 --> 
</P> 
<P>
</P>
<P>The Administration however, did support the work begun by  the 104th
Congress on giving a line-item veto to the President. In  his March 25, 1995,
radio address, President Clinton stated,  &quot;[The line-item veto] will bring
more discipline to our spending  process by enabling presidents to veto
particular projects which are  unjustified, but which today can be hidden in
comprehensive bills  the president has to sign.&quot;
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>But the White House also has perfected the art of misleading  the public
with baseline budgeting. The most egregious example  is Medicare. Throughout the
past year, Clinton falsely charged  that Congress was insisting on
unconscionable cuts in Medicare.  The truth is that Medicare spending would
escalate dramatically  under the BBA, just not as fast as expected under the
artificial  CBO &quot;baseline.&quot;  Clinton also conveniently forgets to
mention that  his own plan would reduce Medicare spending below the  projected
baseline, though not as much as Congress's plan would.  According to CBO
estimates, cumulative Medicare spending over the  next seven years will total
$1.824 trillion.<TT><B><A HREF="ftnt1.htm#32">32</A></B></TT>
 Clinton proposes  spending a total of $1.733 trillion over the next seven years
on  Medicare, $91 billion less than projected. Congress, by contrast, proposes 
to spend $1.685 trillion during the same period, roughly $140  billion less than
projected but just $49 billion less than Clinton.  Thus, there is a difference
of less than 3 percent between how  much Clinton wants to spend on Medicare and
Congress's proposal.  This is hardly draconian.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>104TH CONGRESS</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The new Congress came in with an ambitious budget  reform agenda that
included passing constitutional amendments to  balance

President with a line-item veto. In  addition, the new Congress promised to
bring honesty to the  budget process by eliminating typical congressional tricks
such  as &quot;baseline budgeting,&quot; in which increases in spending are 
called &quot;cuts&quot; because they fall below the spending levels projected by
 the Congressional Budget Office.

<P>Although often stymied by the White House and old guard  lawmakers, the new
Congress had a good year trying to bring  needed reform to the budget process.
The Balanced Budget Amendment  to the Constitution received overwhelming support
in the House,  only to lose by one vote in the Senate. Congress also advanced 
legislation to provided the President with a line-item veto and  enacted rule
changes to remove some of the trickery from the budget  process.

</P>
<P>Some of the more important budget process issues addressed  by the 104th
Congress include:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>The Balanced Budget Amendment.</B> In 1995, both the House  and the
Senate considered constitutional amendments that would  provide for a balanced
budget by the year 2002. While the  House overwhelmingly achieved the two-thirds
majority needed to  send the proposal to the states for ratification, the Senate
fell one  vote short of the 67 votes needed when liberal Senators who 
previously had supported the Balanced Budget Amendment reversed  their position
under heavy lobbying from the Clinton Administration.

<P>
</P>
<P>Fiscal conservatives in the House and Senate attempted to  include a tax
limitation provision in the Balanced Budget Amendment  requiring a supermajority
(three-fifths) vote in both houses to  increase taxes. Unfortunately, that
effort fell short in both  chambers. Such a safeguard is justified because, as
shown in Chart 1 in  this section, the deficits of the last 25 years have been
caused  by spending increases rather than by taxes that are too low. Without  a
tax limitation provision, a balanced budget requirement could  be used as a
justification for tax increases.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>The Line-Item Veto. </B>The Line-Item Veto Act (H.R. 2, part of  the
Contract With America) was approved by the House and  Senate, but the two
versions differed widely. The House version, known  as enhanced rescission,
would allow the President to single out  specific items in spending bills for
reconsideration by Congress.  The Senate version would split appropriations
measures into  multiple bills for separate action by the President. After a
lengthy  conference, House and Senate negotiators agreed on a plan that  follows
the House's enhanced rescission approach.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Used conscientiously, a line-item veto could cut wasteful  spending without
jeopardizing necessary programs. State experience  shows, however, that the
line-item veto alone is not likely to result in  huge budget reductions,
although states have found it to be a fairly  effective curb on spending growth
over time. Moreover, it serves  as a check on the usual tendency of legislators
to lard  appropriations bills with pork-barrel spending designed to garner
additional  votes  both for the majority party in Congress and the individual 
Mem
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 58 -->  ber back home. The President of
the United States would join  the chief executives of 43 states in being able to
use this weapon to  cut spending if the line-item veto is approved.
</P> 
<P>
</P>
<P><B>The Byrd Rule.</B> Section 313 of the Budget Act is the  so-called Byrd
Rule, which prevents &quot;extraneous&quot; provisions from  being included in
the reconciliation bill. The rule was proposed by  Senator Robert Byrd (D-WV) a
decade ago to prevent adoption of  a particular provision with which he was
unhappy. Unfortunately,  it has resulted in a long-standing problem in the
Senate. A  provision deemed out of order under the Byrd Rule must face a 
three-fifths vote (60 votes) to survive intact. In 1995, more than 45 
provisions were ruled extraneous and summarily removed from bills.  Among the
lost items were:

</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Tax Limitations.</B> The House did adopt a supermajority  provision
regarding tax increases as a House rule. Since this House  rule would not have
the same standing as a constitutional  amendment, it would not apply to the
Senate and could easily be changed if  a new Congress decided it no longer
wanted to live under it.  However, House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-GA) has
promised a  vote around April 15, 1996, on a constitutional amendment that 
would prevent big-spending Members of Congress from using the  drive 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 59 -->  toward a balanced budget as an
excuse to raise taxes on  hard-working Americans. It is significant that the
vote on the  House rule change received significant support from both sides of 
the political aisle. The vote was 279-152, or 65 percent in favor   just short
of the two-thirds needed for a constitutional amendment   with 52 Democrats
voting for the rule.
</P> 
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Scoring Rules.</B> One of the most significant disputes in the 
confrontation between the President and Congress over the Balanced  Budget Act
of 1995 was the question of &quot;scoring.&quot;  The President  argued for the
use of Office of Management and Budget  (OMB) spending and revenue estimates to
judge whether the budget  deal met the requirement of balance by 2002, while the
Congress  stood by the more conservative predictions of the Congressional 
Budget Office (CBO). Using the President's OMB numbers would  have permitted
hundreds of billions in additional spending over  seven years. If Congress and
the President are serious about achieving  a balanced budget, it makes sense to
use the numbers that  produce the most spending cuts; this leaves the greatest
likelihood that  the budget will be in balance when the plan predicts.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Lock Box.</B> Another concept which could help reduce spending,  the &quot;lock
box,&quot; was approved in preliminary form by the House  in 1995. Currently, if
the House or Senate adopts a specific  spending cut, the savings can be diverted
to spending increases on other  programs. This becomes particularly troublesome
in conference  committees where back-room deals are cut. The lock box bill 
establishes congressional and Treasury procedures to ensure that  votes in
Congress to cut specific spending programs translate into  overall deficit
reduction. Under this plan, internal congressional  spending caps applying to
the 13 appropriations bills would be  lowered 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 60 -->  whenever the House and Senate
vote to cut a particular  program. The savings would be totaled by the Treasury
Department,  which then would reduce overall spending caps for both Congress and
 the executive branch. Even if fully implemented, however, this  plan, like the
line-item veto, is unlikely to produce major spending  cuts, though it would
discourage hypocrisy.
</P> 
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Truth in Budgeting.</B> The Contract With America contained a  provision
that required House committees to compare new  spending recommendations to how
much was spent on a program in the  previous year. Under the old system,
tax-and-spend liberals had  the upper hand because spending increases were
judged not  against actual spending for the previous year, but against 
projected<U> </U>spending for the next year. With these rules, even a spending 
increase could be called a cut, as happened frequently during the  Medicare
reform debate in 1995. The House rules change applies only  to House committee
reports, however, and not to all government  budget documents.

<P><B>WHAT TO DO IN 1997</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>1995 was the year Congress faced up to the task of making  tough decisions
on the budget, while the Administration chose instead  to avoid them  and even
maintained that no hard decisions  needed to be made. Conservative candidates
thus must explain to  Americans that Congress sought to institute needed
reforms, only to  be thwarted by the Clinton Administration. And with or 
without White House support, conservatives must commit themselves  to finishing
the job. If Congress and Clinton fail this year to agree  on a seven-year plan
to balance the budget with substantial tax  cuts for families and economic
growth, the first task in 1997 must be  to 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 61 -->  deliver a new plan to the
President as soon as possible.  Equally important, however, conservative
candidates must commit  themselves once more to overhauling and downsizing the
federal  government.

Government</I> is a &quot;how-to&quot; guide to overhauling the  federal
government in a way that protects Social Security and  national defense, yet
produces the spending cuts needed to balance the  budget and pay for tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The vision outlined in the Heritage plan is one of a  government focused
solely on functions that are national in scope. The  routine functions of
government, such as cutting checks at the Social  Security Administration, or
those departments concerned with  nar
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 63 -->  rower functions, such as
operating National Parks, would be  reduced to sub-Cabinet level or independent
status. Activities  more appropriately delivered by the states would be
transferred to  local control, and services better provided by the private
sector  would be fully privatized. Functions which have become outmoded, 
inefficient, or broken beyond repair would simply be terminated.

<P>But the Heritage budget plan is not simply an exercise in  streamlining the

<P><B>Federalism, Privatization, Termination</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In 1997, the conservative agenda for restructuring the federal  government
for the 21st century should be based on three sound  principles:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>1. Federalism:</B> Transferring non-federal functions to state and 
local governments;
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>2. Privatization:</B> Transferring non-governmental functions to  the
more effective and efficient private sector; and
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>3. Termination:</B> Eliminating programs which have become  outmoded,
obsolete, inefficient, or broken beyond repair.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Principle #1: Federalism</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In 1997, Congress should enact a budget that makes it clear  that 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 66 -->  the first responsibility of the
federal government is an  adequate national defense. Congress then should
examine every other  program to determine whether it is truly national in scope
and can  be carried out on a national scale only by the federal  government.
Funding for all agencies and programs that fail to meet this  test, such as many
education, welfare, health, transportation, and  other programs, should be
transferred to the states or returned to  the people as federal tax reductions.
</P> 
<P>
</P>
<P>For example, the Heritage plan called on Congress to take the  following
actions, among others:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Close down</B> the Department of Education, moving most of

<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Principle #2: Privatization </B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In 1997, conservatives should articulate clearly the distinction  between
those activities that are the exclusive responsibility of  the public, or
government, sector and those that should be the  responsibility of the private
sector. In addition, they should describe  areas in which, while there is a
public purpose, the activity still  should be carried out by private
institutions, either directly or under  contract to government.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The new Congress should commit to an intensive privatization,  or
denationalization, effort to reassign essentially private functions  to the
private sector. Such an initiative is long overdue in this  coun
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 68 -->  try. Governments throughout the
world, from Russia to  Mexico and from Japan to Great Britain, have been
redefining the role  of government in a private economy. These governments are 
denationalizing state-owned enterprises, cutting subsidies to  inefficient
industries, removing barriers to private investment, and  restoring property
rights. Yet the U.S. government continues to control  hundreds of private
activities and functions such as public utility  management, railroad services,
small business loans, printing and  publishing, agriculture subsidization, and
oil extraction and storage. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In some cases, privatization provides the only hope for many  inefficient
and unreformed programs starved for capital due to  federal budget constraints.
In the private sector, investment flows to  enterprises that can produce
valuable goods and services. Other  countries have used private capital to
finance major  infrastructure projects with a public purpose. The $9 billion
tunnel between  England and France, for instance, was financed almost entirely 
with private capital. By contrast, infrastructure financed and  maintained with
public money tends to be chronically undercapitalized,  as budget pressures
cause public investment to be deferred in favor  of current public consumption.
Privatizing commercial functions  can yield considerable short-term revenues
while greatly  improving the efficiency of services.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In the private sector, selling unproductive or underperforming  enterprises
is a common practice. Scott Paper CEO Al Dunlap,  who orchestrated the largest
corporate restructuring in history, says  that &quot;Inside every corporation is
the biggest bank one is ever going  to find  its own assets. Before you go
looking for outside  funding look first at what you don't need.&quot;<TT><B><A

before the process itself stymies the major  restructuring the government needs
to move into the next century.  Conservatives should focus on restoring the
balance of spending power  between Congress and the President by passing such
measures as  the Balanced Budget Amendment and the line-item veto.  Congress
also needs to clean its own house. Conservatives should  centralize spending
authority within a few accountable committees and  enact other rule changes to
safeguard taxpayer dollars.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Specifically, the 105th Congress should:

<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Send a balanced budget/tax limitation amendment to the 
states.</B> Congress should promptly consider a constitutional  amendment that
provides for a balanced budget by the year 2002 with a  requirement for a
supermajority (three-fifths) vote to raise  taxes. Unless these requirements are
specified in the Constitution,  the nation is doomed to an endless string of
broken promises and  accounting gimmicks that permit politicians to say &quot;just
wait  five more years&quot;  over and over again.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Pass a Balanced Budget Enforcement Act. </B>Congress should  enact and
the President should approve a new budget process  designed to implement the
requirement for a balanced federal budget.  The package under discussion by the
House's Cox-Largent task force  is an excellent starting point. Among the
important features of  that proposal is a budget resolution, signed by the
President, that  sets out overall spending, revenue, and deficit figures for the
year.  This resolution would have to be adopted before any other spending  or
budget legislation.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 74 --> 
</P></BLOCKQUOTE> 
<P>
</P>
<P>Other essential features of budget process reform include  elimination of
the current services baseline, an annual review of  entitlements, a mechanism to
review regulatory costs, and a sequester  or other device to ensure that
spending and deficits stay within  established limits.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Each of the following reforms could be adopted either as part  of such a
reform package or separately.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Abolish the appropriations committees.</B> The 105th 
Congress should find the political courage to reorganize the  committee
structure to rationalize spending powers and build in  accountability. The
current three-layered congressional budgeting system  is both complex and
diffuse. Many committees of Congress have  the authority to spend tax dollars,
but no one is accountable if  such spending results in higher deficits. Studies
show that when  spending authority is limited to a few committees, Members are 
more accountable for their decisions, which result in minimal  deficit spending
and occasional budget surpluses. For example,  the Hoover Institution's John
Cogan found that congressional  spending decreased sharply in the 1920s after
spending power was  centralized.<TT><B><A
HREF="ftnt1.htm#34">34</A></B></TT>  Combining authorizing
and appropriations  functions would eliminate one of the three layers in the
budget process  and strengthen the Budget Committee's ability to limit spending 
by permitting it, rather than the spending-oriented  appropriations committees,
to guide budget decisions.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P>Uniting policymaking and spending decisions in the same  committees would
eliminate a severe bias in the appropriations  process. The fact that the House
and Senate Appropriations  Committees exist solely to spend tax dollars provides
a perverse  disincentive 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 75 -->  against cutting spending. Every
dollar cut from the budget  represents a corresponding cut in the power of the
appropriators,  particularly the so-called Cardinals (subcommittee chairmen).
</P> 
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Establish a lock box.</B> The 105th Congress should adopt
rules  to ensure that when Members vote for spending cuts, the savings  are not
secretly recycled into new spending. This reform would  make it much more
difficult for appropriations committees to  insert pork-barrel or controversial
spending in conference reports.  In addition, the direct tie to deficit
reduction might encourage  members to offer and support more amendments for
specific  spending cuts.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Revise the Byrd Rule.</B> The Byrd rule should be modified to  permit
reasonable spending policy decisions to be included in the  reconciliation bill.
While the limited debate time in the Senate for  consideration of reconciliation
bills does help prevent legislation  from becoming a Christmas tree bearing all
sorts of extraneous  provisions, the current structure of the rule prevents
Congress and  the President from adopting important reforms that directly affect
 how the taxpayers' money is spent.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Introduce truth in budgeting. </B>The practice of baseline  budgeting
should be eliminated, and all government budget  documents should indicate the
change in actual spending from one fiscal  year to the next. As discussed in the
chapter on government reform,  the House and Senate also should adopt rules
requiring witnesses  to disclose any federal funding they receive.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Conduct an entitlement review. </B>Congress and the President  should be
required to reexamine entitlement spending at the same  time 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 76 -->  they consider the appropriations
bills. It is fiscally irresponsible  to spend months feuding over one-third of
the federal budget  while scarcely noticing the major drain on federal
resources:  entitlement programs that consume most of the annual budget. The 
regular review should include a careful study by the appropriate  committees of
the programs within their jurisdiction and should result  in roll-call votes in
the House and Senate that, at the very least,  force Congress and the President
to acknowledge the current and  future levels of these programs. Annual budget
resolutions should  establish spending ceilings for all mandatory spending
programs,  except for interest on the national debt, as is now done for 
discretionary (appropriated) spending. Committees with responsibility for 
mandatory programs would be required to revise these programs  to limit spending
accordingly. The nation no longer can afford  to confer benefits on classes of
people with no regard for the cost  to the American taxpayers.
</P> 
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Introduce biennial budgeting.</B> If the congressional budget  process
were expanded from an annual to a biennial process, much  time would be freed to
permit a more careful analysis of policy  revisions. A two-year budget would
permit Congress and the  President to spend much more time debating the
fundamental role of  government and how to revise and improve existing federal 
programs. While biennial budgeting may be a useful reform, however, it  must not
be adopted without the other urgent reforms noted in this  section. Two-year
budgeting on its own would merely create a  higher-stakes &quot;train wreck&quot;
and cause more harm than good. 
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P> 
<P><B><A NAME="Q&A">Q&amp;A</A></B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Why not balance the budget in nine or ten years rather  than 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 77 -->  seven?</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> There are two main reasons why balancing the budget  sooner
rather than later is necessary. First, taking nine or ten years to  balance the
budget would mean larger deficits in each year. The  cumulative effect of these
larger annual deficits is a larger  national debt and larger annual interest
payments on the national debt.  For example, a ten-year &quot;glidepath&quot;
balanced budget would add  $467 billion more to the national debt than the
congressional  Balanced Budget Act of 1995 over the next ten years, resulting in
 additional annual interest payments of $19 billion in today's dollars.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Second, increasing the time frame for balancing the budget  increases the
likelihood that future Congresses will not  follow through on the necessary
spending reductions and program  reforms. Five Congresses and at least two
Administrations would  be responsible for fulfilling a ten-year balanced budget
plan. It is  impractical to assume that these future lawmakers will restrict 
themselves to decisions made ten years ago. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Why cut taxes at a time when we're trying to balance the  budget?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Tax cuts are essential in any balanced budget for two  reasons.
First, tax cuts should be thought of as the ultimate form of  devolution.
Reducing the spending patterns of the federal government  is not enough. We need
to return power to the most basic levels,  the primary one being the individual
household. Parents who are  able to keep more of the money they earn will make
better choices  for their children's education than the federal government.
Senior  citizens who are able to realize more of their retirement savings  will

<!-- Generation of PM publication page 78 -->  be better able to choose a health
plan for themselves than  Uncle Sam. All of these choices are possible only if
people can  keep more of their hard earned money.
</P> 
<P>
</P>
<P>Second, tax cuts are needed in a balanced budget to ensure  a strong
economy. Initially, balancing the budget requires that  government reduce its
role in the economy. In the short term, this  can slow the economy, but
returning money to the private sector  by means of the $500-per-child tax credit
will help to offset  these negative effects. Also, tax cuts to spur investments 
(particularly cuts in the capital gains tax rate) will increase economic growth 
in the long run. This higher economic growth means more  jobs, higher incomes,
and lower prices.
</P> 
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Why did Congress insist on giving a huge tax break to the rich?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Despite the liberal rhetoric, the tax cut package passed by 
Congress as part of the Balanced Budget Act of 1995 would have  benefited all
Americans, including the working poor and the  middle class. Sixty-five percent
of the entire package would flow to  families. The $500-per-child tax credit
would benefit 28 million  families raising 51 million children, 89 percent of
whom earn  below $75,000. Moreover, the congressional family tax cut  package
would have eliminated the entire income tax burden of 3.5  million families
raising 8.7 million children.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Even the capital gains tax cut would benefit all Americans.  Fifty-two
percent of the capital gains tax cut would go to  households with an annual
income of less than $100,000. The capital gains  tax cut also would spur the
economy and promote increased  economic 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 79 -->  efficiency, which leads to more
and better paying jobs  among other benefits.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In light of these facts, it is also ironic that many Democrats,  including
members of the Clinton Administration, would cast  the congressional plan as a
tax break for the rich. It is even  more ironic since the President's original
tax reduction plan would  have denied tax relief to more than five million
families earning  less than $30,000 when compared to the Republican  plan.<TT><B><A
HREF="ftnt1.htm#35">35</A>
</B></TT></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Why is a spending increase labeled a spending cut?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Each year the Congressional Budget Office issues a  &quot;baseline&quot;
projection of federal government spending. This is an estimate  of the amount of
money that will be spent on each program funded  by the federal government, from
Medicare to AmeriCorps. Put  simply, baseline budgeting is a way to forecast
future levels of  spending, tax revenues, and deficits. Any proposed or enacted 
changes in federal spending and tax policies thus are measured  against these
projected benchmarks to produce estimated cuts or increases.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>For example, last year the Congressional Budget Office  estimated that
between 1996 and 2002 the federal government would  have spent $12.8 trillion.
In contrast, the Balanced Budget Act  called for $11.8 trillion over the same
period. Even though spending  under the balanced budget plan would have
increased each and  every year, because it would have increased more slowly than
 projected, it is considered a cut.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. What economic benefits can I expect to see from a  balanced budget
with tax cuts?
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 80 --> 
</B></P> 
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> The immediate benefit for many Americans is tax  relief, whether
it is the $500-per-child tax credit or a lower capital  gains tax rate. In the
longer run, every aspect of economic activity  will benefit from a balanced
federal budget with tax cuts.
</P> 
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Isn't blaming the process just a way of shirking real 
responsibility?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> No. Members of Congress certainly must remain  responsible for
their votes and their legislative records, but the current  rules actually
conspire to raise spending and taxes. The roadblocks  to reducing government and
putting more money in the  taxpayers' pockets are immense. By reforming the
budget process, the  accountability of Congress and the President  will<U> </U>increase,
not decrease, because the hurdles to cutting taxes and spending will  have been
removed. The only factor will be the actions of Members,  not arcane rules
created by the defenders of big government.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Won't the line-item veto give too much power to the President?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> No. A narrowly crafted line-item veto that permits the  President
to send individual spending items back to the Congress for  reconsideration
increases accountability and decreases the  likelihood that pork-barrel projects
will be squirreled away in the  appropriations bills. While this reform alone
will not reduce federal  spending levels significantly, it will provide a
beneficial check on  the current spending tendencies of congressional
appropriators.
</P>
<P>
</P> 
<P><B>Q. Why must a tax limitation provision be included in the  Balanced
Budget Amendment?
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 81 --> 
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Without a requirement for a supermajority vote to  increase
taxes, the chances are good that Congress will resort to tax  increases
(probably disguised as something like &quot;revenue  enhancements&quot;) that
increase the financial burden on hard-working  Americans. The American people
will make sacrifices as the size of  government is reduced and should not be
insulted by being told  they must pay higher taxes because the politicians in 
Washington couldn't find the courage to make the tough decisions on  spending
cuts.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. How can the American people be confident that Congress  and the
President won't resort to phony numbers and accounting  gimmicks to balance the
budget?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> The Balanced Budget Amendment would represent  significant
progress toward effectively reducing the size of government  and returning money
to the taxpayers' pockets. Anyone concerned  that politicians might try to
circumvent a constitutional balanced  budget requirement should be even more
concerned about what  Congress has done in the absence of a balanced budget
mandate.  Effective enforcement provisions and political vigilance by  votes
would be necessary. The 31 states which have balanced  budget requirements have
been able to meet them regularly, even  when difficult decisions were required.
Congress can, and should, do  the same.

<B><A NAME="ISSUES">THE ISSUES</A>
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Government regulations affect all Americans: from the food  they eat, to the
medications they take, to how they use their  private property, to how they run
their businesses. Excessive  government regulation today is vast in scope and
staggering in its impact,  both on individuals and on the U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Government regulation has shown itself to be both  far-reaching and
counterproductive in its impact on American business. It  increases the cost of
doing business and hiring workers, which  results in fewer jobs and lower
salaries and makes U.S.  companies less competitive in world markets.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The burden is bad enough, but much regulation also is poorly  designed and
thus unnecessarily costly. Federal regulatory  agencies do not have a system for
making rational, well-informed  decisions on how to allocate limited resources
most efficiently to  maximize health, safety, and environmental  protection.
<TT><B><A HREF="ftnt3.htm#1">1</A></B></TT>  Today,
Americans spend approximately $170 billion a year just complying with  rules
designed to protect the environment. The total cost to the  economy of all
regulation is estimated to be between $600 billion and  $700 billion annually.
This represents a hidden tax of more than  $6,000 per year per family. The
regulatory process must be reformed  so 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 2 -->  that government resources at all
levels can be allocated more  rationally and business can devote its resources
to becoming more  innovative and productive.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Although the direct costs of regulation typically are imposed  on businesses
and governments, ultimately they are passed on  to American consumers in the
form of higher prices, reduced  quality or availability of products and
services, or higher taxes. In  addition, regulation can increase the cost of
employing workers  and thus act as a tax on job creation and employment. For 
example, American businesses must carry the costs of federal labor laws  that
constrain the freedom of companies to hire and fire workers and  to engage in
negotiations with employees and labor unions.  Similarly, employers often are
required to provide such benefits  as health insurance, unemployment insurance,
workers'  compensation, retirement benefits, paid family leave, or child care  
the costs of which are passed on to consumers through higher prices  or to
workers through slowdowns in the creation of new jobs or  reductions in wages.
<TT><B><A HREF="ftnt3.htm#2">2</A></B></TT>  Federal
mandates on state and local  governments also may force the diversion of
resources from other  government priorities such as education, police, and fire
services.  To continue providing these services, state and local government  may
be compelled to raise taxes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The vast majority of Americans agree that some government  regulation is
desirable and necessary. Most highway regulations,  for example, save lives and
improve the flow of traffic at  minimal cost. Such regulations obviously provide
a huge net benefit to  everyone, but regulations also can be both
counterproductive  and harmful to society. The problem is that regulation today
is  far more costly and less effective than it should be.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 3 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Conservative candidates and legislators should focus on  bringing common
sense to the regulatory process in 1997 by enacting  reforms that incorporate
five key principles:<TT><B><A HREF="ftnt3.htm#3">3</A></B></TT>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>1. Cost-Benefit analysis.</B> Federal agencies should be required  to
consider the benefits and costs of a range of regulatory  alternatives and
choose the options that maximize net benefits to society.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>2. Sound science.</B> Agencies should seek the most advanced  scientific
knowledge available.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>3. Risk assessment and risk management.</B> Agencies must  develop more
scientifically objective methods to determine the nature  and extent of a &quot;hazard.&quot;
 The process for assessing risk should be  distinct from the process for
determining what risks are significant  or unacceptable and how they should be
managed.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>4. Risk-based priorities and public education.</B> Agencies  should
prioritize their regulatory actions based on a consideration of  risks, how
those risks compare to risks familiar to the public, and  the costs of reducing
them. Agencies also must educate the  public about their risk-setting
priorities.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>5. Market incentives and performance standards.</B> To the  extent

<P>Estimating the precise cost of federal regulation is extremely  difficult.
Unlike federal spending, regulatory costs are not  accounted for in the budget
process; and while agencies are supposed to  calculate the costs and benefits of
proposed  regulations, <TT><B><A HREF="ftnt3.htm#5">5</A></B></TT>
their calculations vary in quality and often grossly underestimate the true 
cost or substantially overestimate the benefits of  regulation. <TT><B><A

called for the application of cost-benefit  analysis to new rules and
regulations. The idea was to force  Congress and regulatory agencies to assess
the costs and benefits of  regulations before they are enacted. Critics argue
that too often the  costs and benefits of a regulation are hard to identify and
quantify,  and that it is difficult to place a dollar value on a human life that
 may be saved by a regulation.

on regulatory  reform: 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 5 -->  &quot;One reason why the cost
estimates appear so outrageous is  that the risks the regulations are trying to

<!-- Generation of PM publication page 17 -->  nesses and state and local
governments to comply with  unnecessary and costly mandates. A business forced
to spend $10  million to comply with a particular regulation has less money to
pass on  to workers in the form of higher wages or new jobs. Similarly,  state
and local governments must forego other types of services  (education, police,
or fire) or raise taxes every time they are required  to implement a new federal
mandate.

<P>THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><CITE>-</CITE></B>     While President Clinton is critical
of the federal  government's overregulation, his actions do not match his
rhetoric. In fact,  even as Clinton calls for change, his Administration appears
even  more aggressive than its predecessors in wielding its regulatory power.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><CITE>-</CITE></B>     For example, on October 4, 1993, President
Clinton issued  Executive Order 12866, &quot;Regulatory Planning and Review,&quot;
replacing  a Reagan Administration order requiring executive branch  agencies to
submit proposed regulations with a cost in excess of $100  million to OMB for
review and approval. In the new executive  order, the Clinton Administration
reaffirmed its commitment to 1)  using the best scientific and economic data; 2)
using analysis to  inform decision-making; 3) considering flexible,
cost-effective  performance standards; and 4) allowing early public
participation in  an open and accountable regulatory process. However, there is 
little evidence that the order has had any significant impact or that  the White
House is encouraging agencies to comply. An April  1995 study by the Institute
for Regulatory Policy examined all EPA  proposed and final rules published in
the<I> Federal  Register</I> during the 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 18 -->  second six months after the
Clinton executive order took  effect. Based on an analysis of 222 substantive
rulemakings, the  study found only six for which the demonstrated benefits
justified  the costs involved. In addition, only 14 examined regulatory 
alternatives, and only eight of these specified that the most  cost-effective
rule had been adopted. <TT><B><A HREF="ftnt3.htm#45">45</A></B></TT>

</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P>On February 21, 1995, President Clinton directed federal  agencies to
conduct a page-by-page review of existing regulations to  determine which should
be eliminated and which should be  streamlined, updated, overhauled, or
otherwise improved. By June 1,  the Administration claimed the agencies had
identified over  16,000 pages in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) that they
 would be eliminating. In addition, they supposedly are &quot;reinventing&quot; 
over 31,000 additional pages. The challenge now is for the public  to figure out
what this all really means. While the number  sounds impressive, when put in the
proper context it is considerably  less impressive. Today's CFR is more than
131,000 pages, more  than twice as large as it was twenty years ago. Eliminating
 16,000 pages is only about 12 percent of this total, and that is  assuming that
no new regulations are added in the interim, which is not  the case. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>On November 28, 1995, the Administration published its  1,700-page
semiannual agenda of federal regulations, which  presents very brief
descriptions of all planned regulatory actions.  The Administration's lack of
seriousness in achieving real  reductions in burden is evident. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>While EPA claims to be streamlining various permitting,  review, and
reporting requirements for a number of programs, the  Clinton 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 19 -->  Administration is simultaneously
pushing forward with  burdensome regulatory initiatives, such as expanding the
universe  of sources that must be reported as part of the Toxic Release 
Inventory. <TT><B><A HREF="ftnt3.htm#46">46</A></B></TT> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> The Administration has reviewed the Community  Reinvestment Act (CRA) in an
attempt to &quot;strengthen and streamline&quot; the  rules. However, this
streamlining process resulted in more than  140 pages of new CRA rules and
regulations. As Congressman  Bill McCollum (R-FL) notes, &quot;Only in
Washington can streamlining  be defined as going from a rules that takes up 14
pages in the  Federal Register to one that takes up 145 pages.&quot;
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In addition, a number of agencies admit that they have not  reviewed their
rules for twenty to forty years. Some of the  pages being eliminated are for
rules for which the underlying statute  has long since been repealed, treaties
that no longer exist, etc.  This alone could easily achieve a 10 percent
reduction in the CFR  without accomplishing any real changes in the way in which
the  federal government goes about regulating the public.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Clearly, the Clinton Administration effort is windowdressing  and does
little to curb the rising costs and inefficiencies of  regulation. The
Administration is not being completely honest with  the American public when it
claims to be reinventing regulation  but goes about implementing new, burdensome
regulations about  as fast as it can take old ones off the books.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Clinton Administration also has done little to change the  way in which
federal agencies regulate the public. In fact, it has  worked tirelessly to
block the enactment of comprehensive reform  legisla
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 20 -->  tion that would codify many of
the principles found in  the President's executive order; the Administration
continues to  take the position that fundamental reform can and should be 
achieved through administrative change, not through statute.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>THE 103RD CONGRESS</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>During the 103rd Congress, Members became more serious  about easing the
burden of federal red tape. Even though the  Democratic leadership and the White
House ultimately killed the main  reform efforts of 1994, four reform measures
either passed one house  of Congress or received serious consideration by
congressional  committees; until 1994, none of these measures was even given a 
hearing by the committee of jurisdiction. The proposals were  intended to reduce
the paperwork and regulatory burdens on  businesses, evaluate the economic and
employment impact of regulation,  and curb unfunded federal mandates. While
federal regulations  would continue to impose costs, the legislative proposals
were  intended to force Congress and the executive branch to consider more 
thoroughly the economic impact of proposed legislation and  regulation.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In 1994, unlike past years, a strong grass-roots coalition  helped rally
bipartisan support for these bills and convinced  reluctant committee chairmen
that they could no longer block the  legislation. The business community became
a key part of this  coalition by actively supporting measures aimed at
controlling the  regulatory burden. Adding extra impetus to this effort was a 
powerful coalition of state and local officials who organized themselves  into a
potent political force to fight onerous federal regulations  and Washington
mandates that fail to provide the funding to  imple
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 21 -->  ment them. In the end, however,
the efforts of these groups  were not enough to keep the congressional Democrats
and the  White House from blocking passage of any legislation.

<P>
</P>
<P><B>THE 104TH CONGRESS</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Regulatory reform became a real political possibility with  the 104th
Congress. As part of the Contract With America, the  Republican majority made
one of its promises the passage of a number  of reforms designed to enhance
private property rights (see  Chapter 4) and economic liberty and make
government more  accountable for the burdens it imposes on individuals and
businesses.  During the first 100 days, Congress enacted and President Clinton 
signed into law two of its reform priorities:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995.</B> The federal  government
increasingly has been involved in activities considered to  be state and local
in nature. In response to the increasingly  hostile reaction of states and
localities to unchecked and costly  federal mandates, Congress enacted the
Unfunded Mandates Reform  Act of 1995 (Public Law 100-4), in March 1995. The Act
represents  &quot;a bipartisan agreement that something is wrong with American 
federalism as it has evolved in recent  years.&quot; <TT><B><A
HREF="ftnt3.htm#47">47</A></B></TT>  The Act establishes a
$50 million threshold on the costs Congress and regulatory  agencies can impose
on state and local governments. A &quot;mandate&quot;  includes any requirement
that a state take an action, under the  threat of penalties or loss of
assistance, that would increase state and  local costs beyond existing levels.
New and reauthorized  legislation would have to specify how programs would be
funded. The  law also requires the Congressional Budget Office to issue an 
analysis of each piece of legislation containing a federal mandate.  The 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 22 -->  analysis must describe the
mandate, specify its expected cost  to state and local governments, and state
whether it is to be partly  or entirely funded.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In January 1996, the Advisory Council on Intergovernment  Relations (ACIR),
which is tasked under the Act to &quot;investigate  and review the role of
federal mandates in intergovernmental  relations,&quot; issued a preliminary
report with recommendations to  Congress for addressing existing federal
mandates on state and  local governments. State and localities identified more
than 200  separate mandates affecting them which involve more than 170  federal
laws. Among ACIR recommendations: revise the Safe  Drinking Water Act, the Clean
Air Act, and the Endangered Species Act  to promote greater flexibility and
increased consultation betwen  the federal government and states and localities,
and modify  the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Clean Water Act to 
reduce budgetary and administrative constraints. <TT><B><A

</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995.</B> Intent on lessening  the burden
imposed by the federal government on individuals  and businesses, the 104th
Congress voted overwhelmingly to pass  the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, and
President Clinton signed  it into law on May 22, 1995. The Office of Information
and  Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) in the White House Office of  Management and
Budget (OMB) is responsible for implementing the Act's  objectives. In March
1995, the Office of Management and  Budget estimated that Americans spend more
than 6.4 billion hours  during fiscal year 1994 filling out forms, answering
survey questions,  and compiling records for the federal government.<TT><B><A
HREF="ftnt3.htm#49">49</A></B></TT>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The law, which came into effect in October 1995, sets a  govern
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 23 -->  ment-wide paperwork reduction
goal of 10 percent in each of  the first two years after its enactment and 5
percent from fiscal  1998 through 2001. It also reauthorizes for six years the
Office of  Information and Regulatory Affairs, which remains responsible for 
carrying out the law. The Act's most controversial provision  would overturn a
1990 Supreme Court decision holding that OMB's  authority under the Paperwork
Reduction Act of 1980 did not  extend to regulations forcing businesses to
provide information to  third parties, including employees and the public. The 
reauthorization provides that all third-party paperwork requirements will be 
approved by OMB, and this is expected to increase OMB's review  of paperwork by
50 percent.

<P><B>Corrections Day.</B> A regular Corrections Day has been  established for
passing corrective and non-controversial legislation with  bipartisan
supermajorities (three-fifths). Through this process,  Congress is able to
revise regulations that have become outdated or  obsolete, correct agency
errors, or simply eliminate regulations that do  not make any sense. In the
House, the Speaker's Correction Day  Advisory Group, chaired by Representative
Barbara Vucanovich  (R-NV), reviews and recommends legislative proposals for 
consideration under the Corrections Calendar. Bills on the calendar can  be
considered at the discretion of the Speaker of the House on  the second and
fourth Tuesday of each month. The following are  two examples of bills passed by
one or both houses of Congress:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>The Federal Reports Elimination and Sunset Act (S.790)</B>
to  abolish or reduce the statutory requirement for a list of over 200 
congressionally mandated reports, and to require the President to  submit his

<!-- Generation of PM publication page 24 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>The Edible Oil Regulatory Reform Act (H.R. 436)</B> to require  the
government to differentiate between petroleum oils and animal  and vegetable
fats, oils, and greases. The Oil Pollution Act of  1990 places prohibitive
financial requirements on oils and does not  distinguish between non-toxic,
biodegradable animal and  vegetable oils, which are less of an environmental
hazard, and  petroleum products. The Department of Transportation was going to 
implement the Act through regulations that would have required  24 hours of
hazardous material classroom and field training for  workers who responded to
butter or salad oil spill emergencies.

<P><B>Congressional Accountability and Regulatory Relief for  Small Business.
</B>In response to the recommendations of the White  House Conference on Small
Business, Senator Christopher Bond  (R-MO), chairman of the Senate Small
Business Committee,  sponsored S. 942, the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement
 Fairness Act of 1996. This bill passed the Senate with a vote of 100 to 0  on
March 19, 1996. The bill authorizes judicial enforcement of  the Regulatory
Flexibility Act of 1980, allows small business to  recoup expenses and legal
fees incurred when agencies make  excessive demands for penalties that cannot be
sustained in court  and provides for an independent ombudsman to receive 
confidential complaints from small businesses about their dealings with  federal
regulators. In addition, the bill was amended by Senator  Nickles (R-OK) and
Senator Reid (D-NV) to allow Congress 60 days  to review agency regulations.
This amendment effectively  incorporated a previously approved Senate bill (S.
219) that provided  for such congressional review. The House already had passed
a  similar small business legislation (S. 926) in March 1995. The  House and
Senate finalized the bill and attached it to legislation to  raise 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 25 -->  the debt ceiling. The President
signed the bill on March 29, 1996.

<P><B>Industry Deregulation</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The 104th Congress succeeded in passing the  Communications Act of 1995,
signed into law by President Clinton on February  8, 1996, which is the most
important industry-wide deregulatory  initiative undertaken by Congress in over
a decade. The Act  removes unnecessary layers of federal rules governing
telephone, cable  and broadcasting competition. Specifically, the Act

<P>Although the legislation is an important step, more extensive  initiatives
are still needed to eliminate subsidies and regulations,  end the socialization

</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Unfortunately, other important legislative regulatory reform  efforts have
been stalled by the Democratic congressional leadership  and 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 26 -->  the White House.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Four other important reform proposals also were considered by  the 104th
Congress:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>1. A Moratorium on Regulation.</B> After the November 1994  election,
Republican Members of Congress asked President Clinton  to freeze new federal
rulemaking during the first 100 days of the  new Congress. When President
Clinton refused, the House of  Representatives passed H.R. 450, the Regulatory
Transition Act of  1995, which would freeze regulatory activity retroactively
from  November 20, 1994, until 1996 or the passage of regulatory reform 
legislation. The purpose of the bill was to provide for a &quot;time-out&quot; 
period, during which Congress and the Administration could  debate and study the
large number of regulations currently being  developed and evaluate proposed
efforts to reform the way in  which regulatory decisions are made and
implemented. Although  the Senate bill started out the same way, a substitute
bill requiring  that all federal rules lie before Congress for 45 days to be
reviewed  and &quot;vetoed&quot; before becoming final ultimately was passed. 
Because the two versions turned out to be significantly different, the 
House-Senate conference on the bills stalled.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>2. Comprehensive Regulatory Reform.</B> Just two months into  the first
session of the 104th Congress, the House passed H.R. 1022  on February 28, 1995.
Although the Contract With America was  a Republican election platform, H.R.
1022 was passed with a  substantial bipartisan majority. The purpose of the bill
is to impose  a requirement  on existing statutes and new regulations  that  the
risks, costs, and benefits be considered before implementation  of new rules.
Where the estimated economic impact is $25 million  or 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 27 -->  more agencies would be required
to conduct risk assessment,  as necessary, before regulations take effect. In
addition, they  would be required to evaluate the costs and benefits associated
with  the set of regula-tory alternatives, including no government action;  to
show that the benefits outweigh the costs and that the net  benefits to society
would be greater under the proposed rule than  under alternatives; and to assess
the effect on businesses with fewer  than 100 employees and the effect on
employment. A federal  agency's compliance with the requirements of H.R. 1022
would be  judicially reviewable under the statute granting the agency the 
authority to act and, where applicable, under the Administrative  Procedures
Act.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Unfortunately, comprehensive regulatory reform proposals in  the Senate were
killed by the Democrats and the White House.  Two bills in the Senate were the
focus of the debate. The  Comprehensive Regulatory Reform Act of 1995, S. 343,
sponsored by  Senator Robert Dole (R-KS), started out prescribing the risk and 
cost-benefit studies in a manner similar to that found in H.R. 1022. The  bill
also would allow citizens to petition agencies to apply  cost-benefit analysis
to regulations already on the books. The Regulatory  Reform Act of 1995, S. 291,
sponsored by Senator William Roth  (R-DE), was less prescriptive, giving federal
agencies more latitude  to make regulatory decisions. The standard for weighing
the  costs and benefits of regulation also was less stringent than in the 
original S. 343. Eventually, the Senate's efforts focused on S. 343,  and the
Democrats and the Clinton Administration were successful  in negotiating changes
with Senate Republicans that severely  weakened the bill relative to similar
provisions found in H.R.  1022. Despite the concessions to Democrats, supporters
of the bill  were unable to garner the necessary 60 votes to impose cloture on 
de
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 28 -->  bate, and the bill stalled in the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>3. &quot;Sunset&quot; and Review.</B> Many believe the regulatory 
system would be more reasonable if the law required that agencies  review and
revise their rules periodically and if those regulations not  re-evaluated
within the prescribed time could no longer be  enforced. Senator Dole's
comprehensive regulatory reform bill  contained &quot;sunset&quot; and review
provisions. In March 1996, the House  attempted to incorporate a bill sponsored
by Representative  David McIntosh (R-IN) that would require agency review of 
regulations into a package of reforms that included small business relief  and
congressional accountability. Strong opposition to this type of  review, from
the White House, House Democrats, and public  interest groups, brought the
renewed House effort to move even a  modest regulatory bill in 1996 to a
standstill. The Senate then moved  forward with a bill that included
congressional accountability  and small business relief. This was conferenced
with an earlier  House-passed bill that did not include administrative review
and was  sent to the President and signed on March 29, 1996.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>WHAT TO DO IN 1997</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Congress must pursue regulatory reform efforts that not  only streamline the
way in which the federal government issues  rules, but also improve the
underlying scientific data, information,  and analysis used to make decisions
about how or whether to  regulate. A major reason regulation imposes such
tremendous costs is  that Congress and the executive branch often regulate
without  adequately weighing the burdens placed on employers and the  increased
cost to the economy in terms of jobs and  competitiveness. The following reforms
can build upon existing regulatory  review 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 29 -->  mechanisms to force the
government to prioritize regulations,  assess their costs and benefits, and
adopt the least burdensome  approaches.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Strengthen White House oversight of executive branch agencies.
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Executive branch agencies are required to submit proposed  regulations to
the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs  (OIRA) within the Office of
Management and Budget. OIRA was  created by the 1980 Paperwork Reduction Act to
reduce federal  paperwork burdens, and President Reagan added to OIRA's 
responsibilities by issuing an executive order requiring executive branch 
agencies to submit proposed regulations to it for review. But if the  White
House does not make deregulation a priority, OIRA allows  agencies a long leash.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Legislation should be adopted to establish OIRA's statutory  authority and
responsibility to review regulation. Because  OIRA's regulatory review function
currently is derived solely from  executive order, a new Administration that
disagrees with this  function could withdraw it simply by revoking the
applicable  order. OIRA's authority also should be expanded beyond the  existing
executive orders to cover rulemaking by independent  agencies such as the
Federal Communications Commission and  Securities and Exchange Commission.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Establish in statute a set of principles to guide  regulatory
decisionmaking.
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The regulatory process needs to be reformed so that scarce  economic
resources can be allocated more efficiently to achieve  the 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 30 -->  most good. The concept of smarter
regulation is an important  one to understand in the regulatory reform 
debate.50  The following principles are key elements of this concept:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Cost-benefit analysis.</B> Federal agencies should be
required  to evaluate the costs and benefits of all new regulations. Critics 
will argue that costs and benefits can be difficult to identify or hard  to
quantify, and this may be true. Nevertheless, it is very useful  to begin to get
agencies to think more systematically about the  economic impact of new
regulations by requiring an accounting  and weighing of costs and benefits, to
the extent possible, in  making their decisions.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Sound science.</B> Federal agencies should be required to use the  most
advanced and precise scientific methods to calculate the risk  estimates that
form the basis for agency decisions, and  regulations should be updated to
reflect changes in that scientific  knowledge. Unfortunately, agencies use
extremely conservative or  worst-case assumptions to make up for the lack of
data and high degree  of scientific uncertainty that characterize the current
risk  assessment process.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Risk assessment and risk management.</B> Risk assessment  methods need
to be improved (for example, by using sound science),  and agencies need to
establish a clear distinction between  assessing risks and deciding how to
manage them. Federal agencies  should work closely with the scientific community
to improve risk  assessment guidelines. Today, agencies too often allow policy 
decisions about how to manage risk to influence the determination of  risk. Only
when a risk is identified should a policy decision about  how to handle it be
made.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 31 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Risk-based priorities and public education.</B> Government has a 
responsibility to inform the public of risks and to minimize the  distortion and
exaggeration of those risks. By using risk  comparisons, federal agencies can
help the public understand the familiar  risks they face every day, such as
being struck by lighting, and  how these compare with unfamiliar risks, such as
exposure to a  particular chemical in the community.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Market incentives and performance standards.</B> Whenever  regulation is
necessary, it should be accomplished to the extent  possible by setting a goal
and allowing the market to decide how it  will achieve that goal. For example,
instead of requiring businesses  to use specific technology to reduce pollution,
a regulation  should mandate the amount of pollution reduction and allow
businesses  to decide how they will achieve that reduction. Each business  then
has the freedom and the incentive to adopt the least costly  means of achieving
the goal for itself, minimizing the total cost  burden that compliance imposes
on the economy. In contrast,  command-and-control regulations provide no
incentive for the regulated  entity to exceed a regulatory goal.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Establish a regulatory budget.
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The President and Congress should establish a federal  regulatory budget
that places a ceiling on the total estimated cost that can  be imposed on the
economy each year by all federal regulations.  If the budget total was reached
by existing regulations, an  agency wishing to add a regulation with further
costs would have to  repeal or modify an existing regulation imposing the same
or greater  cost. A regulatory budget would place a politically accountable
limit  on 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 32 -->  the total burden that could be
imposed on the economy by  federal regulation. It also would give agencies a
strong incentive to  review existing regulations to discover which could be
safely  eliminated or modified to reduce costs. Overall, government would be 
forced to prioritize its regulations and abolish the least beneficial. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Require federal agencies to review existing regulations to  ensure that
they meet sound regulatory principles. 
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>If Congress codifies a set of principles for smarter regulation,  it also
should require that federal regulators go back and review  all existing
regulations to make sure they also meet those principles.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Deregulate specific industries.
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Although reform of the regulatory decisionmaking process is  necessary,
policymakers also should continue to push for  deregulation of specific
industries. In the late 1970s and early 1980s,  Congress deregulated several
industries, including the airline, railway,  and interstate trucking industries
and natural gas. The 104th  Congress succeeded in making 1996 the year we see
significant  deregulation of the telecommunications industry. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Congress should continue the success of the 104th  Congress and take
action to deregulate the following industries:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Banking.</B> Congress should continue to deregulate the
banking  industry. Three specific areas of banking regulation need to be 
addressed. First, structural restrictions such as the Glass-Steagall  Act of
1933 retard bank stability and expansion and limit the  credit opportunities
banks can offer to businesses. Second, the  current 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 33 -->  federal deposit insurance system
is a government-operated  safety net that distorts the banking industry at a
great cost to the  taxpayer. Finally, direct banking regulations such as the
Community  Reinvestment Act (CRA) cost consumers and businesses millions  of
dollars each year without correcting the perceived problems  which they are
meant to cure. Banking deregulation will mean that  consumers benefit from being
able to make more profitable  investments, and businesses benefit from the more
efficient flow of  capital through the financial sector.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Utilities.</B> Policymakers should completely overhaul  regulation
within utilities markets. All consumers should have the right  to purchase
electric services in competitive markets, but  customer choice in electricity
requires the deregulation of the existing  monopoly-controlled industry. The
Federal Power Act and the  Public Utility Holding Company Act are the major
federal statutes  that require the regulation of existing electric utility
monopolies.  Competition, not regulation, is the best way to spur innovation and
 the development of new technologies and services. Opening up  the utilities

(Section 27 of the Merchant Marine Act of 1920), which  increases the
transportation costs of many U.S. businesses by requiring  that when their
merchandise is transported entirely or partly by  water between United States
points  either directly or via a  foreign point  it must travel in US. - built,
U.S.-flagged,  U.S.-manned, and U.S.-owned vessels. That monopoly raises costs.
No  other U.S. industry has such a costly lock on the economy. In  addition,

provisions that expose ships,  shipyards, terminals, and other companies in the

</P>
<P><B>Q. Isn't regulatory &quot;reform&quot; just another way of saying &quot;let's
 roll back twenty years of health, safety and environmental protection?&quot;
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> No. Regulatory reform is an attempt to bring common sense  to the
way federal agencies make decisions about whether and how  to regulate.
Effective regulatory reform means smarter  regulation. One of the consequences
of making smarter decisions is that  we may decide a regulation is not needed,
and this means  reducing regulation. Republicans, like Democrats, want clean
air, clean  water, and safe food and consumer products. Unfortunately,  however,
federal regulators have not done a very good job of allocating  our scarce
economic resources efficiently to achieve these goals.  By making sure that
regulators sensibly and consistently  evaluate risks, compare them to the types
of risk faced by people every  day (such as driving a car or getting hit by
lightning), and consider  the costs and benefits of their actions, we can do an
even better  job protecting the environment and public health and safety  while
spending less.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 35 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. What role should the federal government play in regulation?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A. </B>Most Americans want society to regulate who can be a  doctor or
who can fly an airplane, or to decide what pharmaceuticals  are safe enough to
be placed on open shelves. But most also  would agree that there are good and
bad regulations, some that  make sense and others that are silly and
incomprehensible, and that  the benefits of some are simply not worth the cost,
while others  provide no benefit at all. The federal government should be 
required to consider certain questions about regulations to make sure  they
achieve their intended purposes. These questions include  whether the benefits
outweigh the costs, whether the level of risk  justifies the cost, whether the
regulatory solution being chosen  minimizes the disruption of the free market,
and whether the regulation  is understandable and easy to implement.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. How do you decide when the benefits of a regulation  outweigh its
costs?  For example, how can you decide how much one life  is worth?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Many ordinary daily activities pose a greater threat to  human
life than the hazards that are regulated. Such risks as driving  without a
seatbelt, which individuals can control, generally pose a  far greater risk than
certain pesticides. Yet the public focuses on  the risk from pesticide. A
10-minute bicycle ride poses the same  risk of death  one-in-a-million  as the
lifetime cancer risk  from wood-preserving chemicals. But only the latter is
regulated.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Because society has limited resources, it makes sense to  apply them where
the risks are greatest. Environmental regulation  alone 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 36 -->  now costs America approximately
$170 billion annually.  That means lost jobs, which can pose a far greater risk
to the health  of an individual than many of the problems currently targeted  by
regulations intended to protect health. Thus, it is not a case of  putting an
acceptable &quot;price&quot; on a life, but of determining how  much risk is
avoided by one expenditure as opposed to another. Is  health improved more by
forcing firms to spend money on certain  costly pollution controls, for
instance, or by leaving them free to  spend the same money creating jobs and
improving living standards,  or even hiring more police?  A better appreciation
of risk and cost  has led both Democrats and Republicans to support prioritizing
 risks so that the nation's limited resources are used to deal with  the
greatest threats to human health.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. What can be done to relieve the tax, paperwork, and other  regulatory
burdens on small businesses?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> The message from small business owners is loud and clear:  The
federal government gets in the way of their ability to survive  and thrive.
Following through on tax and regulatory reform will  give small businesses the
relief they need to create jobs and expand  the tax base. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Today's tax system is a disgrace (see Chapter 2). Billions of  hours are
spent each year to comply with an increasingly  incomprehensible maze of tax
forms, regulations, and documents. In  addition, the current system of
deductions and loopholes is too easily  manipulated by special interests for
their own advantage.  Although the 1995 tax legislation makes a small step
toward easing  these problems, the need for fundamental reform is compelling. A 
flat tax would resolve many of the tax problems we face today. It  rep
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 37 -->  resents a straightforward, fair
system that can be implemented  by two simple postcards, one for individuals and
one for businesses.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Similarly, small businesses today face increasing federal  regulatory
burdens. Too often, command-and-control,  one-size-fits-all federal regulations
put small businesses at a disadvantage.  The cost of compliance falls
disproportionately on small  businesses. The 104th Congress took action to
correct these problems by  passing a small business regulatory reform bill in
March 1996.  This legislation takes step to make sure the economic impact of 
regulation on small businesses is taken into consideration. This  includes
evaluating the economic impact of regulations on small  businesses as well as
ensuring that small business interests are  adequately represented in the
development of regulations. Small  businesses, like any other businesses, also
should have the right to  challenge federal regulations in court, and courts
must have the ability  both to block the implementation of harmful and costly
regulations  and to require agencies to reconsider them.

<P>Americans want a clean, healthy environment. They also want  a strong
economy. But environmental protection is enormously  expensive, costs jobs, and
stifles economic opportunity. On the  other hand, before government stepped in,
robust economic activity  such as manufacturing led to a deteriorating and
unhealthy  environment. The challenge is how to achieve both a strong economy 
and a healthy environment. After all, what Americans actually want  is a high
overall quality of life.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Three decades ago, as people perceived that their quality of  life was
beginning to deteriorate, they began to support  aggressive policies to reduce
pollution. These policies frequently failed to  live up to their sponsors'
claims; they also became increasingly  and unnecessarily expensive. But the
environment did improve,  especially in the early years. Now, however, Americans
are  becoming aware that many of these policies are unreasonable and that,  even
when they work, they result only in small improvements at a  heavy cost in jobs
and freedom. Americans also are beginning to  recognize that there often is no
sound scientific basis for assertions  of environmental harm or risk to the
public. The pendulum  finally has begun to swing the other way. 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 2 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Conservatives, like Americans generally, have no wish to return  to the days
of black smoke billowing out of smokestacks. But they  do believe common sense
can be brought to bear in dealing with  the environment: that it is possible to
protect the environment  without sacrificing the freedoms for which America
stands.  Conservative candidates and legislators therefore should stress the 
following themes:
</P>

conserving  or efficiently using  natural resources is not in dispute.  The

on sound science, not &quot;tabloid science.&quot;
</P>
<P>

<P><B>Priority setting.</B> Candidates must explain that not all problems  are
of the same importance or urgency, and that regulating all  risks 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 3 -->  equally means fewer lives are

</P>
<P>While pollution levels have fallen dramatically since 1970,  most reductions
were achieved early and at relatively low cost.  From 1970 to 1990, total
emission levels fell 33.8 percent. Over  the same period, lead levels in the air
fell 96.5 percent, and  carbon monoxide levels in the air fell 40.7 percent. But
reductions  have slowed dramatically.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>As recently as 1985, the annual cost of environmental  protection was $82
billion. Since then, it has more than doubled to $171  billion, while
environmental gains have slowed to a trickle. The  estimated $171 billion spent
in 1995 represents about 3 percent  of America's gross domestic product (GDP).
Put another way,  these poorly crafted environmental regulations cost each 
American household almost $1,800 per year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The pattern is consistent: What economists call the marginal  rate of return
on investment falls dramatically as government runs  out of easy fixes and then
attempts to eke out minuscule  improvements in the environment at skyrocketing
extra cost. The resulting  drain on the economy is both enormous and
unnecessary.

</P>
<P>Regulatory abuses like these usually are a direct result of the  way
government bureaucracies attack environmental problems.  Typically, these
agencies regulate without regard to the cost  imposed on individuals and
businesses. Yet it makes no sense to issue  a regulation for which the burden
far outweighs any benefit  that might be conferred. In fact, it often is unclear
whether there will  be any benefit at all because the science on which many 
regulations are based is so poor.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Also, instead of setting realistic performance standards and  giving
businesses the freedom to develop innovative ways of  meeting them, agencies
typically rely on inflexible  command-and-control regulations that, for example,
specify what technologies  companies must use. Since businesses differ in their
operating  structures, this one-size-fits-all approach rarely leads to
cost-effective  solutions compared to more flexible and dependable performance 
standards. Moreover, by eliminating the incentive for companies  to seek out
these cost-effective solutions, it stifles innovative  technologies or
techniques that reduce costs. In the end, of course,  the consumer is the one
who pays.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Perhaps the most troublesome aspect of current  environmental policy is the
fact that bureaucrats and liberal lawmakers  generally consider regulation the
only option. Creative solutions shown to  be less expensive, more effective, and
more respectful of human  liberty are rejected out of hand. Instead of setting
up a system of  incentives to lure businesses into operating with environmental 
impact in mind, the system relies on punishment regardless  of whether this
accomplishes the desired goal or creates  unintended consequences. 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 6 -->

<P>
</P>
<P><B>Rejecting Property Rights</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Regulations have become increasingly unfair. The  Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA), Department of the Interior (DOI),  Army Corps of Engineers, and
other federal agencies operate on  the premise that property should be used to
satisfy government's  needs and objectives without regard to who owns the
property or the  financial burden imposed on them. It is this mentality that 
leads government reflexively to reject the creative solutions advanced  by
free-market advocates, including incentive-based approaches  to protecting
endangered species. By ignoring property rights,  establishment
environmentalists, bureaucrats, and liberal legislators  also ignore the
benefits to be derived from free trade and free markets.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The most unfair and burdensome hardship inflicted by  government &quot;regulatory
takings&quot; is that property owners are not  compensated for their losses. For
instance, if an elderly husband and wife  spend a large portion of their
retirement savings to buy land on which  to build their dream home and that land
subsequently is designated  a wetland, they lose the value of their property as
well as their  savings. They are stuck with property they cannot use and the 
government does nothing to reimburse them for their loss.  Unfortunately, tales
of financial hardship caused by government designation  of land as wetland or
endangered-species habitat have become  common. For instance:

<P>Hundreds of such stories have surfaced over the past few  years, and many
analysts suspect that far more are never made  public. According to Bob Adams,
Project Director for Environmental  and Regulatory Affairs at the National

<P>Ironically, federal agencies and the Clinton Administration  argue that it
would cost too much money to compensate  landowners. 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 8 -->  Leon Panetta, then Director of the
Office of Management  and Budget, told the House Committee on Public Works  and
Transportation's Subcommittee on Water Resources and the  Environment on May 26,
1994, that paying compensation for  wetlands regulation would be &quot;an
unnecessary and unwise use of  taxpayer dollars&quot; and a drain on the federal
budget.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Property owners counter that regulatory takings are a drain on  the family
budget. Nancie Marzulla, President of Defenders of  Property Rights, points out
that &quot;what people don't realize is that  these landowners typically are not
wealthy and powerful  corporations, but normal Americans  schoolteachers and
elderly couples   whose lives are destroyed by stretched interpretations of a 
single environmental law.&quot; <TT><B><A HREF="ftnt4.htm#8">8</A></B></TT>
 Moreover, the federal government  already owns about one out of every three
acres in the country (with  even more owned by state and local governments).
<A HREF="ftnt4.htm#9">9</A>  If the federal  government can
afford to maintain one-third of the nation's land,  it should be able to pay
landowners for regulatory confiscation  of their property. If not, maybe it
should consider selling the  least ecologically sensitive land from its vast
holdings to pay for  the land it wants.

<P><B>Lost Opportunities, Lost Lives</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Ask the average American how much a human life is worth,  and the answer
likely will be that &quot;no amount is too much.&quot;  This  is how Congress
and federal agencies justify imposing  sometimes staggering costs on businesses
to reduce the risks of death by  infinitesimal amounts. What policymakers fail
to understand is  that wasting resources in this way means not being able to use
them  in other ways that might well produce better results and save  even 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 9 -->  more lives. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>If lawmakers ever did consider which environmental policies  actually save
the most lives, they would scrap many existing  rules, freeing up resources to
be used in other ways. This  commonsense approach would lead to regulation that
is very different, in  its scope and fundamental assumptions, from that which 
burdens America today. In fact, as the following charts illustrate, if  the
private resources used to comply with federal mandates were to  be left with the
industries or individuals concerned, or used in  other ways in the local
economy, in many cases Americans would  benefit more, and far more lives would
be saved.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Ill-conceived environmental regulations designed to  &quot;protect&quot;
people may even cause deaths. The best example is the set of  Corporate Average
Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards, intended to  conserve energy and encourage lower
oil prices. The only way  auto makers can meet the CAFE standards is by building
lighter  cars. Unfortunately for drivers and passengers, however, lighter cars 
are less able to withstand the impact of crashes. The result: more  highway
deaths. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Robert Crandall of the Brookings Institution and John Graham  of the Harvard
Center for Risk Analysis have found that 2,500  highway deaths should be
expected as a result of CAFE's impact  on the weight of cars made in the 1989
model year  alone. <TT><B><A HREF="ftnt4.htm#10">10</A></B></TT>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Some environmental regulations may cause deaths indirectly.  Statistical
analyses have shown that for every $7.5 million in costs  the government imposes
on the economy, lower overall living  standards cause one additional statistical
 death. <TT><B><A HREF="ftnt4.htm#11">11</A></B></TT>  When
this formula 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 10 -->  is used to compare the number of
lives &quot;saved&quot; by a  particular environmental regulation with the
number lost through lower  living standards, it becomes obvious that many
regulations  actually increase the death toll. For example:

<P>When asked by the media, pollsters, or politicians, Americans  routinely
answer that they want a clean and healthy environment.  Indeed, the majority of
Americans consider themselves  &quot;environmentalists.&quot;  This does not
translate, however, into automatic  acceptance of the environmental lobby's
agenda. Conservative  candidates need to make this clear to discourage voters
from  supporting policies they do not believe in simply because they are 
portrayed as &quot;pro-environment.&quot;

</P>
<P>The dichotomy in public opinion shows up in polling data.  When respondents
are asked general or theoretical questions that  involve little personal
sacrifice, or that do not identify those  burdened, government intervention
fares well. In one poll, for instance,  60 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 11 -->  percent of respondents agreed
that we must protect the  environment even if it costs jobs in the  community.
<TT><B><A HREF="ftnt4.htm#13">13</A></B></TT>  In another,
72 percent of respondents said they would pay somewhat higher taxes  if the
money was used to protect the environment and prevent  water and air pollution.

</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>On the other hand, when respondents are asked questions that  are more
specific, that involve greater sacrifice, or that identify  the people losing
jobs, government intervention is less popular.  When respondents are asked to
pay much higher taxes to protect the  environment, support drops by almost half.
By the same token,  only one-third would be willing to accept cuts in their
standard of  living. <TT><B><A HREF="ftnt4.htm#15">15</A></B></TT>

<P>More Americans than not believe that environmental  organizations are too
extreme  a perception that is partially responsible for  recent significant
declines in membership among these groups.  Perhaps the most consistent finding
is that Americans think EPA  is doing a poor job: More than two-thirds think the

<P>Perhaps the most refreshing change in attitudes in recent years  is the
recognition that the country can have economic growth  and environmental
protection simultaneously. Vice President Al  Gore has made the point that
economic growth and environmental  protection are not incompatible. This is
true, but only if  America's environmental laws are structured correctly to
encourage  responsible behavior as part of the business decision-making 
process. Gore advocates stringent command-and-control regulations  that 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 12 -->  are inconsistent with growth and
lead to little real gains in  environmental protection. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> Whenever this question comes up, Americans must be told  that the way to
promote both environmental protection and  economic growth is to allow them to
work hand in hand. The  government must stop regarding them as mutually
exclusive and stop  pitting economic freedom against the environment. Laws must
be  based on, and work with, a free market. Only then can Americans  maximize
their economic and environmental quality of life.

</P>
<P>Given Americans' ambivalence on the question of  environmental protection,
it is all the more important for conservatives to  approach the issue in a
commonsense way. People must  understand that environmental protection need not
come at the expense  of jobs, but will cost jobs if the socialist model of
centralized  control for protecting the environment is not set aside. It doesn't
 work. Rather, the country should adopt a reasonable, commonsense  approach to
environmental protection that is based on:

<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>First,</B> leftists and the public at large understand that

<P>&quot;Freedom with responsibility for one's actions&quot; should be the 
conservative message. Responsibility restrains wasteful  behavior. Ironically,
the old environmentalist slogan &quot;Make the  polluter pay&quot; is consistent
with this message. But when they say this,  conservatives and liberals mean
different things. As Al Cobb,  then Director of Environment and Energy at the
National Policy  Forum, 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 14 -->  has said, &quot;What the
environmental lobby means by that phrase  is that corporate polluters should be
punished severely for any  pollution whatsoever. What conservatives mean,
however, is that  polluters should bear the full cost of environmental
degradation,  but no more.&quot; <TT><B><A

market  reflects the conservation ethic better than any command-and-control 
regulation from Washington. A free market can occur, however,  only when private
citizens engage in trade, and people can trade  only what they own: some form of
property. Thus, property is the  cornerstone of a free market. If property
rights are insecure or  publicly owned, a market cannot function effectively.
Some  critics misleadingly call this &quot;market failure,&quot; but it is
really a failure  to use markets and their main engine: property rights. As a 
result, both environmental protection and personal liberty suffer. A  resource
that is not owned will deteriorate or be depleted  because neither protection of
nor damage to that resource is part of  the individual's usual decision-making
process. Others, however,  are still forced to bear the consequences.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Conservative candidates should concentrate on explaining the  innovative
ways in which property rights can be used to protect  the environment. The most

to enlist self-interest in  the service of environmental protection.

and Central African  elephant herd populations dropped from more than 1 million
to less  than half that. Yet, in Zimbabwe, elephant herds have increased 
dramatically. The difference is that hunting in Zimbabwe is  permitted as a
property right. Small villages that own the land on which  elephants live and
graze charge safari operators to conduct  hunts. Since the villages profit
directly, they have an incentive to  promote herd growth to increase their
income. In surrounding  African countries, government bureaucrats seem unable to
curb  incessant poaching; in Zimbabwe, however, villagers are constantly on  the

conserves his fish stock, allowing them to reproduce, and  prevents pollution
from entering his stretch of the river. If a  municipality pollutes the water

by chlorofluourocarbons (CFCs), a  refrigerant. After widespread media coverage

<P>Instead of merely responding to tabloid claims or politically  motivated
studies by federal agencies and environmental  organizations trying to justify
their budgets, regulations should be based on  credible scientific findings open
to public scrutiny. For instance,  agencies should use consistent methodologies
to determine risks.  Currently, they use different methods. Thus, for example,
risk  assessments by different agencies may turn up different answers as  to
whether a chemical at a particular dose level causes cancer.  Theoretically,
exposure to some level of a chemical could be found  to be both deadly and
perfectly safe. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Government assessments also should reveal the assumptions  and uncertainties
in their analyses. Typically, because of missing  data, most studies use certain
assumptions to estimate these  uncertainties. These assumptions, sometimes
unreasonably gloomy,  usually determine the conclusion reached. For instance,
sometimes an  estimate of the likely risk from some chemical is multiplied 
thousands, or even millions, of times just to be &quot;conservative.&quot;  Yet 
the analyses used to justify these enormously expensive  regulations often are
obscure as to their assumptions. Moreover, the  reports 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 19 -->  rarely reveal the level of
uncertainty involved in arriving at  their conclusions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Whenever regulations that address risks are considered,  each agency should
be required to conduct risk assessments  if only  to aid in intelligent
decision-making  that are consistent, that  are transparent to public scrutiny,
and that fully detail their  assumptions and levels of uncertainty. Moreover,
each study should  be reviewed before a regulation is pub-lished to ensure that 
scientific guidelines are strictly followed. If federal agencies cannot  meet
even this very limited standard, it is unconscionable for them  to impose costly
standards on others.

<P><B><CITE>-</CITE>     The Need To Set Priorities.</B> The economy has a
limited capacity  to absorb environmental regulations. Simply put, the country 
cannot afford to eliminate every risk. Thus, there is a trade-off:  Attempting
to regulate one risk out of existence may mean that  another risk (or other
risks) will have to be tolerated. In most cases,  the cure is worse than the
disease. Misguided and excessive  regulation can cost lives, so it is critical
that regulators recognize the costs  of their actions. Spending enormous amounts

cannot  be used in other productive ways  public or private  that might  be of
greater benefit to the nation.

Regulating these  less serious risks costs the economy enormous sums while

<P>This is why it is essential that policymakers develop a priority  list of
environmental problems, based on the extent of the possible  risk each appears
to pose and the cost of reducing that risk to  acceptable levels. With such a

dollar spent.  Americans finally will get the maximum environmental &quot;bang

a rare metal on my property, its value goes up.  But if a rare bird occupies the
land, its value disappears. We've got  to turn it around to make the landowner
want to have the bird on  his property.&quot; <TT><B><A
HREF="ftnt4.htm#37">37</A></B></TT>  Hamilton's words
illustrate why environmental  laws that do not take individual rights into
account are  counterproductive. A serious problem has developed, known as &quot;shoot,
 shovel, and shut up.&quot; <TT><B><A HREF="ftnt4.htm#38">38</A></B></TT>
 Landowners that find, say, a listed plant on  their property sometimes pull the
plant rather than lose their life  savings. Even when landowners take no hostile
move against  species, few have any incentive to provide what endangered species
 need 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 26 -->  most: habitat. As Larry McKinney,
Director of Resource  Protection for the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department,
says, &quot;While  I have no hard evidence to prove it, I am convinced that more
 habitat for the black-capped vireo, and especially the  gold-cheeked warbler,
has been lost in those areas of Texas since the listing  of these birds than
would have been lost without the ESA at  all.&quot; <TT><B><A
HREF="ftnt4.htm#39">39</A></B></TT>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In contrast to the harmful effects from confiscatory  regulations,
encouraging the willing cooperation of landowners has led to  some striking
successes.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>&quot;Perhaps the most notable success story was the recovery of  the wood
duck which was rapidly headed for extinction early in  the century due to a loss
of nesting habitat and over-hunting.  Friends of the wood duck, in the best
tradition of voluntary association  and private conservation, spent the rest of
the century asking  the nation's private landowners to allow them to erect
artificial  nest boxes for the birds,&quot; says R.J. Smith, Senior 
Environmental Scholar at the Competitive Enterprise Institute. &quot;Most 
landowners were more than willing to help. There was no downside. If  the ducks
utilized the nest boxes, the landowners would not be  prevented from using their
lands. If we had had an ESA in 1920,  the wood duck would likely be extinct
today  instead of the  second most common duck in the eastern flyway. Similar
efforts  have worked for... bluebirds, screech owls, barn owl kestrels  (sparrow
hawks), purple martins, and even prothonotary warblers [as  well as] wild
turkeys, ruffed grouse, prairie chickens, and many  species of quail.&quot;
<TT><B><A HREF="ftnt4.htm#40">40</A></B></TT>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Numerous controversies surround ESA, such as whether it is  appropriate or
worthwhile to protect endangered sub-species that  are 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 27 -->  almost identical genetically to
other non-endangered  sub-species. But these are side issues. As currently
enforced, ESA forces  landowners  without compensation  to surrender many of 
their property rights if listed species are found. If the incentive  problem
that pits landowners against species instead of aligning their  interests was
eliminated, the threat to species would likely become  a thing of the past. But
this would occur only if the fear of  punishment for having habitat was replaced
with the promise of  reward for providing habitat. Issues such as which species
need the  most protection could be debated dispassionately with a view to 
getting the maximum return for public funds spent to preserve these  species.
Since federal wildlife managers would be forced to  implement the most efficient
and beneficial uses of those funds,  species most needing protection would be
the most likely to benefit.

<P>
</P>
<P><B>Wetlands</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Wetlands, traditionally known as swamps or bogs, have been  disappearing at
a rapid rate during this century, primarily  because they are unique ecosystems.
They are valued by many  Americans for the very practical reason that they can
act as a buffer  against flooding and can purify streams and rivers. Others
despise  wetlands as &quot;mosquito-infested swamps,&quot; and they typically 
are breeding grounds for disease-carrying mosquitoes. While  most Americans
historically have fallen into the latter group,  increased public recognition of
the positive qualities of some wetlands  in recent decades has led to demands
for preservation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Unfortunately, the confusing and onerous nature of wetland  policy has made
wetland protection a politically contentious issue.  In practice, the Clean
Water Act has been used as the legislative  ve
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 28 -->  hicle to restrict any disturbance
of wetlands even though  wetlands are not mentioned in the legislation. The EPA
and Army Corps  of Engineers rely on Section 404 of the Clean Water Act to 
regulate landowners that wish to disturb wetland on their  property. <TT><B><A
HREF="ftnt4.htm#41">41</A></B></TT>  There are four principal
problems with current wetland policies:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>First,</B> the statutory authority itself is questionable.
Indeed, for  isolated wetland, known as &quot;non-adjacent&quot; wetland,
federal  authority seems clearly lacking. Obviously, federal agencies should not
 pursue policies that neither the Constitution nor any statute  allows them to
pursue.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Second,</B> the definition of what constitutes a wetland is 
unnecessarily broad. According to the 1987 Delineation Manual now in  force, a
wetland is any land that meets each of the following criteria:  It must be
inundated or saturated to 12 inches deep for at least 7  consecutive days and 5
percent of the growing season, and more  than 50 percent of the dominant plant
species found are found  in marshes and swamps regardless of whether they are
found  elsewhere as well. This language is so unnecessarily inclusive  that land
which is bone dry for almost the entire year can be deemed  a wetland.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Third,</B> the nation already has achieved the Bush-Clinton  wetland
goal of &quot;no net loss&quot; in a given year. In recent years, the nation 
has been increasing its wetland stock. In 1994, the likely net gain  was more
than 100,000 acres; the expected loss rate was 102,000  acres, while the
expected &quot;creation&quot; rate due to federal programs  was 195,000 acres.
Additionally, wetland restoration is taking place  on public land and through
strictly private initiatives. In 1994,  for example, Ducks Unlimited alone
restored or enhanced  51,260 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 29 -->  acres.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Fourth,</B> the financial resources of many Americans are being 
destroyed as owners are forced to surrender, without  compensation, their right
to use their property. Because many affected  individuals make their living or
pay their mortgages from income  derived from the land, their savings can be
wiped out.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P>In short, this legislation has led to often absurd results. Based  on
questionable legal authority, federal agencies can force  landowners to
sacrifice their life's savings to protect land with little  ecological value
against the now-obsolete threat of net loss of wetlands.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Pesticides and the Delaney Clause </B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>One of the onerous aspects of pesticide regulation is Section  409 of the
Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, known as  the Delaney Clause, enacted in
1958 to ban any additive in  pro-cessed food that has been shown to cause cancer
in humans or  laboratory animals. The Delaney Clause seemed reasonable at the
time  because scientists could test for traces of chemicals only in  quantities
of about one in a million. Today, however, with improvements  in technology,
they can test for many of these chemicals in  quantities of less than one in a
quadrillion (a billion million). Some  chemicals can be detected almost down to
the level of a molecule. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>This means that extremely small trace quantities that were  undetectable 37
years ago  and thus allowable  now form the  basis for a court order requiring
EPA to eliminate dozens of  pesticides. Many of these same pesticides are
completely safe up to  certain levels, according to EPA's own findings, but the
law requires  that 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 30 -->  they be banned. Under Section 408
of the same Act, which  relates to raw foods, EPA has issued regulations setting
the tolerance  level deemed safe for consumption. Thus, under Section 409   the
Delaney Clause  EPA will ban pesticide residues in  processed foods that it
allows and proclaims safe in raw foods. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Even EPA Administrator Carol Browner has called for a change  in the law: &quot;We
have gotten to a point where we have to say  we know a lot more about these
chemicals than we did 35 years  ago when the law was passed.&quot;  <TT><B><A
HREF="ftnt4.htm#42">42</A></B></TT>  Unfortunately, the 
environmental lobby applied severe pressure on the Clinton Administration,  and
Browner backpedaled from her position. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The issue is not simply cutting costs. Pesticides are responsible  for an
explosion of food production in this country and around  the world while the
land use has remained relatively constant. As  the <a href="envir_4.gif">chart</a> below shows, if
pesticides were eliminated, the amount  of land used for agriculture to produce
the same amount of  food would triple. Moreover, pesticides are directly related
to  lower world food prices. This increases food consumption, including  the
consumption of fruits and vegetables, which in turn lowers  cancer rates. In the
words of Bruce Ames, Professor of Biochemistry  and Molecular Biology at the
University of California at Berkeley  and perhaps the world's foremost expert on
cancer risk, the best  known way to prevent cancer is to &quot;eat your 
veggies.&quot; <TT><B><A HREF="ftnt4.htm#43">43</A></B></TT>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Moreover, the fact that some chemical pesticides test positive  for cancer
when huge doses are fed to test animals is not  necessarily cause for alarm.
After all, says Ames, of the 22 chemicals found  in coffee that have been tested
in animal cancer tests, &quot;17 are  carcinogens. There are 10 milligrams of
known carcinogens in a  cup 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 31 -->  of coffee and that's more
carcinogens than you're likely to  get from pesticide residues in a year....
We're eating natural  pesticides, which are chemicals that plants use to try to
kill off insects that  try to eat them. And we eat roughly 1,500 milligrams of
them per  day. We eat 0.09 milligrams of synthetic pesticide residues. So  we're
talking about incredibly tiny amounts of synthetic pesticides,  and yet the same
percentage [roughly half] of natural chemicals  come out positive&quot; when
tested for cancer. <TT><B><A HREF="ftnt4.htm#44">44</A></B></TT>

<P><B>Superfund </B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation,  and Liability Act
(CERCLA), the program for cleaning up  hazardous waste sites, is up for
reauthorization. Superfund, as CERCLA  is known, not only is one of the most
complex laws now in force,  but also is widely regarded as the most wasteful and
ineffective.  Even the Clinton Administration admits the program does not  work.
Despite expenditures of between $20 billion and $30  billion, Superfund has
cleaned up only a small fraction of the  nation's worst hazardous waste sites.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Superfund was enacted after widespread press attention to the  exposure of
residents to high levels of dangerous chemicals at  Love Canal near Niagara
Falls, New York. <TT><B><A HREF="ftnt4.htm#45">45</A></B></TT>
 Unfortunately, the  law was hurried through Congress in the final days of the
Carter  Administration, so many provisions are ill-considered. Much of  the
money has been spent not on cleanup, but on legal fees and  other &quot;transaction
costs,&quot; and while program costs have  ballooned, cleanups have proceeded
slowly. Only 291, or 24 percent, of  the 1,238 &quot;worst&quot; hazardous waste
sites  sites placed on the  National Priorities List (NPL)  have been cleaned
up. To clean up the  re
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 32 -->  maining sites now on the NPL will
cost an estimated $40  billion. <TT><B><A
HREF="ftnt4.htm#46">46</A></B></TT>  If the cost of cleaning
up federal facilities is added to the  equation, the total could exceed $750
billion, or $7,800 per U.S.  household. <TT><B><A
HREF="ftnt4.htm#47">47</A></B></TT>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>There are four basic flaws in the Superfund program:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>1. The law as written is designed to reduce the level of 
chemicals in the ground, not to reduce risks to people.</B> Yet fully one-third 
of the sites pose only hypothetical future risks based primarily on  the
assumption that residential housing will be built, thus  exposing future
residents to these chemicals. It is utterly unrealistic to  assume any
residential housing will be built on any  untreated Superfund site; no developer
would attempt it, or get permits if  he did.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>2. The program's unreasonable standards require that  hazardous waste
sites be cleaned up to a pristine level no matter what  the location, resulting
in a poor return on the investment.</B> For  instance, polluted soil at
industrial park sites must be cleaned up to a  level that makes it essentially
clean enough to eat.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>3. Hazardous wastes by their very nature are local problems,  but
listings, cleanup decisions, and program authority are run by a  federal
bureaucracy.</B> If there is any federal environmental law  for which a
legitimate case can be made for devolving authority  back to the states, it is
CERCLA.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>4. The law's retroactive, strict joint and several liability  scheme
results in endless legal battles as potentially responsible  parties (PRPs)
fight EPA, then each other, and then their insurers to  shoul
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 33 -->  der the costs of cleanup.</B> It
is little wonder that the program is  derisively called the &quot;Super
scholarship fund for lawyers' children.&quot;   The liability scheme is designed
to find someone with &quot;deep  pockets&quot; to pay the cost of cleanup
regardless of how much  or  how little  that individual may have contributed to
the waste  problem. This forces individuals and small businesses to pay 
enormous sums for what most people would consider innocent acts, some  of them
committed generations ago.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P>All of these characteristics drive up costs while blunting  the program's
effectiveness. Moreover, all have led to numerous  horror stories of people
caught in the Superfund liability web.  For instance:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><CITE>-</CITE></B>     Russ Zimmer was named a PRP for a
Superfund site at a car  battery cracking plant in Torrington, Wyoming. His
contribution  to the problem?  He sold a bag of dog food in 1977 and a bag of 
seed in 1984, and took a third-party check as payment for the  items. Since the
checks had been issued by the now-bankrupt  company that had owned the battery
cracking plant, Zimmer was sued as  a PRP by another company caught in the
Superfund liability  scheme. Zimmer decided, on advice of counsel, that he
should settle  to avoid even more in legal costs. He agreed to pay $3,500  even
though he had nothing to do with the matter.  <TT><B><A
HREF="ftnt4.htm#48">48</A></B></TT>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><CITE>-</CITE></B>     The entire town of Triumph, Idaho, located just
a few miles  away from the famous ski resort town of Sun Valley, has suffered 
terribly under EPA's administration of the Superfund law. The  town, which had a
silver mine until 1957, has plenty of lead in  the ground. So the EPA put the
mine on the Superfund list, with  the highest &quot;worst&quot; Superfund score
ever  almost half again as  high 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 34 -->  as the nuclear production site at
Hanford, Washington. As a  result, banks red-lined the town, and homeowners
cannot sell their  homes because banks refuse to lend on them. EPA officials
summoned  an emergency meeting at which they told the 50 families their 
children might have extremely high levels of lead in their blood.  EPA conducted
tests for lead contamination but refused to disclose  the results, so the town
did its own tests. It turns out that lead  poisoning was not a problem because
the well water in Triumph was  not contaminated. In fact, lead levels in
Triumph's water are below  the national average, well within safety limits. Now
the  townspeople are unified against the federal government's treatment of 
their community. In March 1995, a resident, Donna Rose, testified to  a House
Commerce subcommittee that EPA &quot;terrified us. They  committed atrocious
acts on our community.&quot; <TT><B><A HREF="ftnt4.htm#49">49</A></B></TT>
 Unfortunately for  Triumph, however, the suffering caused under Superfund 
continues. Rose, who like many of her townsfolk believes Triumph was  chosen for
designation as the worst of the worst sites because  EPA needed a trophy as
Superfund came under attack, testified  that &quot;We can't sell our houses.
We're trapped there forever until this  is resolved.&quot; <TT><B><A

</P>
<P><B>CAFE Standards </B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards  were enacted in
response to the oil crisis in 1973 and were designed  to stabilize oil prices at
lower levels. Today, support for the  program comes primarily from the
environmental lobby, which sees  the standards as a way to preserve fuel, and
perhaps to drive up  the cost of autos. The program currently requires that cars
 average 27.5 mpg (miles per gallon) and that light trucks average  20.7 mpg.
Now the Clinton Administration is considering tightening  the 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 35 -->  standards. The problem is that
this law costs both lives and jobs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The most serious problem with CAFE standards, to put it  bluntly, is that
they kill people. According to economists Robert  Crandall of the Brookings
Institution and John Graham of the  Harvard School of Public Health, 1989 model
cars are about 500  pounds lighter than they would have been without the 27.5
mpg  economy standard. <TT><B><A HREF="ftnt4.htm#51">51</A></B></TT>
 They estimate that this weight reduction is  responsible for 2,500 additional
deaths and 25,000 additional serious  injuries per model fleet year. This is too
high a price to pay for any  government program. Raising the standard would only
increase  the death toll. Raising standards to 40 mpg, for example, would 
likely mean another 4,800 to 8,600 deaths per  year. <TT><B><A
HREF="ftnt4.htm#52">52</A></B></TT>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The other problem with CAFE, especially with raising the  standard, is that
it makes little economic sense. A study by  Charles Rivers Associates has found
that increasing standards would  raise the average price of cars by $1,500 and
the average price of  trucks by $2,100. <TT><B><A
HREF="ftnt4.htm#53">53</A></B></TT>  This would lead
consumers to retain their older  autos longer, thus minimizing the very
decreases in fuel  consumption regulators hope to see and increasing pollution
by an estimated  4 percent by the year 2010 (assuming a 30 percent increase in 
the mileage standard). <TT><B><A HREF="ftnt4.htm#54">54</A></B></TT>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Finally, raising CAFE standards would be devastating to  average families.
The reason the traditional full-size family station  wagon no longer is made is
that car manufacturers found it difficult  to meet the 27.5 mpg standard with
these gas-guzzlers in their  fleets. Thus, the market for even less
fuel-efficient minivans  exploded, since they only had to meet the light truck
standard of less than  21 mpg. If standards for light trucks were raised, then 
manufacturers 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 36 -->  would be forced to raise prices
dramatically to cut sales of  the minivan so their fleet average could remain in
compliance.  Thus, most families no longer could afford the only vehicle
designed  for families.

<P>Slowly, methodically, and steadily, the Clinton Administration  has been
pushing a consistently liberal environmental agenda.  The most prominent aspect
of this agenda is its high-flown  rhetoric, especially since the advent of the
104th Congress. While much  of this rhetoric has little to do with reality, the
attack has been  quite effective against a Congress that seems to lack  the
Administration's unified sense of purpose. Vice President Al  Gore, EPA

<P>The Superfund reform advocated by the Administration in  1994 and 1995, for
example, partially addressed some of the most  egregious aspects of this law,
but created perhaps as many problems  as it solved. Thus, the Administration was
able to claim that it  wanted to eliminate some of the worst aspects of the law,
such as joint  and several liability, while attempting to substitute provisions 
that were not much better, such as the allocation scheme it  devised. Meanwhile,
it insisted on seemingly innocuous provisions  that would have created an
environmental welfare program by  diverting up to 4 percent of Superfund's money
to environmental  activists. <TT><B><A HREF="ftnt4.htm#56">56</A></B></TT>

raised so that cars would average 45 mpg (and light trucks  34 mpg) by the year
2007 and 75 mpg and 56 mpg by the year  2025. These recommendations, if
implemented, would have  increased the death toll on the road by many thousands
every year, since  cars meeting these standards necessarily would have to be
lighter to  be more fuel efficient, and thus would be less crashworthy. 
Fortunately, the committee was unable to issue a consensus report  because the

pass any new ones (with the  exception of the California Desert Protection Act).
 Environmental lobbyists worked successfully to block any reauthorization  that
included one or more of three reforms: compensating  property owners for losses
caused by environmental rulings, giving  states relief from unfunded federal
environmental mandates, or  requiring that risk assessments be conducted before
expensive  regulations designed to alleviate some hypothetical risk are put into
place.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Environmentalists so feared passage of these reforms (which  they called the
&quot;unholy trinity&quot;) that they decided it was better to  have no
environmental legislation adopted at all. But conservatives  kept offering the
amendments, which also were supported by  many 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 41 -->  moderates, so the Democratic
leadership refused to let the  reauthorization bills come up for a vote  even a
bill that would  have raised EPA to Cabinet level as the Department of the 
Environment.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Unfortunately, the 104th Congress accomplished little more in  the
environmental area during its first session, although it did pass  the Unfunded
Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (UMRA), one part of  the &quot;unholy trinity.&quot;
 While this Act covers regulation generally,  the most burdensome mandates on
local governments typically  have been environmental regulations. For instance,
prior to the  Unfunded Mandates Reform Act, regulators continued to issue  new
prescriptive regulations under the Safe Drinking Water Act  that imposed
enormous costs on local communities by requiring  what some local officials
called gold-plated solutions. After passage  of UMRA, the Senate voted
unanimously for a bill that would  allow smaller communities to develop and use
less costly  alternative standards on condition that they protect the public 
health. <TT><B><A HREF="ftnt4.htm#60">60</A></B></TT>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>While property-rights and risk-assessment bills have been  debated
thoroughly by both chambers and passed by the House, the  Senate has yet to vote
on them, and President Clinton has threatened  to veto them if they reach his
desk. <TT><B><A HREF="ftnt4.htm#61">61</A></B></TT> 
Congress also has failed  to reauthorize the major environmental laws. The
reason: Few  reforms of the current laws could avoid a veto by the President, 
and the leadership does not have the votes to override a veto.  Moreover, as of
publication, Members so far have failed to embrace  an environmental vision of
their own.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>As of publication, EPA appropriations for FY 1996 have not  become law.
Congress passed the EPA appropriations bill as part  of 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 42 -->  the Veterans Affairs, Housing and
Urban Development, and  Independent Agencies appropriations bill on December 14,
1995,  but President Clinton vetoed the bill four days later. His main 
objection was that EPA's funding level of $5.7 billion was too low,  especially
in the enforcement area. While EPA's funding under  the bill would have been
reduced by 21 percent as a necessary  incident to balancing the budget, it is
unlikely this would interfere  seriously with EPA's mandate. Although no new
major environmental  laws have passed  and only one has been amended since  1989
<TT><B><A HREF="ftnt4.htm#62">62</A></B></TT>  the level of
funding that Clinton vetoed as too deep a cut is almost  10 percent higher than
when President Bush took  office. <TT><B><A
HREF="ftnt4.htm#63">63</A></B></TT>  In reality, EPA's growth
has far outstripped growth of both the economy  and the federal government; the
funding of $5.7 billion merely  reflects an attempt to rectify this imbalance.

<P><B>WHAT TO DO IN 1997</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Emphasize research on climate change rather than costly, 
questionable controls. </B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>If the science of climate change were more precise than it is,  and the
evidence more consistent with the dire predictions of  some proponents of the
global-warming theory, it could make sense  for the United States and other
countries to take urgent,  expensive action to deal with the potential threat.
But the science is far  from certain. Rather than rush to &quot;do something&quot;
at huge cost, the  wiser and more mature course would be to try to find out more
 precisely what actually is happening to the Earth's atmosphere. Yet 
environmentalists are trying to redirect funding from research on  climate
change to research on its effects  on the assumption that  global warming
definitely will happen. As noted by Jeffrey Salmon,  Ex
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 43 -->  ecutive Director of the George C.
Marshall Institute, which  focuses on science issues, &quot;obviously, the
environmental lobby has  not been happy with the data that science has been
coming up with  the last few years.&quot; <TT><B><A
HREF="ftnt4.htm#65">65</A></B></TT> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Congress should resist attempts to redirect climate change  research. While
cutting unnecessary duplication of research  may allow for some budget savings,
the basic research should  continue as insurance against unwise actions in the
future.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Change the Endangered Species Act to give landowners the  incentive to
conserve species.
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>ESA should be reformed to eliminate the adversarial  relationship between
landowners and species fostered by the current Act.  If landowners, who are
closest to the species needing protection,  had an incentive to provide habitat
or encourage reproduction on  their property, there is little doubt these
species would flourish. Just  as the country pays auto makers to produce Jeeps
for the Army,  it should pay landowners to produce members of endangered 
species that need protection. Not only would this reform allow the Act  to work
for the first time, but Americans also would not be forced  to surrender their
freedoms.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Reform America's wetlands &quot;legislation.&quot;
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>It is time to decide whether wetlands should be protected for  their own
sake. If the answer is &quot;No,&quot; the Clean Water Act  reauthorization
should specify that protection is limited to water pollution.  If the answer is
&quot;Yes,&quot; a Wetlands Protection Act should be passed.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 44 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Require the government to pay fair market value if it  confiscates
property through regulation.
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The executive branch should be required to define different  categories of
wetlands according to ecological structure and  value. Additionally, it should
establish differing levels of protection.  This categorization should include
the economic value of the land as  a component of the decision-making process so
that decisions  to regulate take into account the relative cost of protecting
each  parcel. By including this factor, the money spent on acquiring  wetlands
would be stretched to obtain the maximum protection  for every dollar spent.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Repeal the Delaney Clause.
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Spending billions of dollars to ban useful, safe pesticides to  avoid
negligible risks is simply bad public policy. The Delaney Clause  is obsolete
and should be discarded.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Reform Superfund.
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Superfund is broken. If it is to be repaired, it must be  completely
overhauled. Federal agencies, state governments,  municipalities, and the
private sector must be relieved of the ill-conceived,  unnecessary, and
expensive burdens of this program. Specifically,  the reformed CERCLA should at
least:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><CITE>-</CITE>     Turn</B> authority for current NPL sites over to the
states  with  the necessary funding. To qualify for funds, states should be 
required to meet two conditions:
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 45 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>      <B>1.</B> That they prioritize sites and expenditures based on real 
risks, and
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>      <B>2.</B> That they eliminate joint and several liability and end 
retroactive liability for wastes disposed of before 1987 for sites  cleaned with
federal funds.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><CITE>-</CITE>     Allow</B> states to use funds for any of their most
serious  hazardous waste sites, not just NPL sites transferred from the federal 
government. These conditions would have to apply, or states would  be tempted
simply to spend the money on sites for which they  were responsible rather than
on those that are most dangerous.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><CITE>-</CITE>     Create</B> a revolving loan fund for cleaning up old
industrial sites.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><CITE>-</CITE>     Allow</B> EPA to retain its emergency cleanup 
capacity. <TT><B><A HREF="ftnt4.htm#66">66</A></B></TT>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>If substantive reforms of this nature are not enacted,  Superfund will
continue to be an ineffective and expensive drain on  the American economy. But
if proper reforms are instituted,  Congress can achieve its original goal of
protecting Americans from  hazardous wastes at reasonable cost.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Save lives by ending the CAFE program.
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Not only should CAFE standards not be raised further, but the  program
should be eliminated. It costs lives and jobs and  provides only questionable
benefits. Reducing oil consumption may  help lower oil prices and reduce
pollution, but it also costs 2,500  lives. The trade-off simply is not worth it.

</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><A NAME="Q&A">Q &amp; A</A></B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Doesn't regulatory reform mean rolling back regulations  that protect
our environment?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> No. Regulatory reform means introducing common sense  into the
equation when decisions are made about whether, for  instance, a chemical should
be banned or regulated. At its most basic,  regulatory reform means making sure
the government knows what it  is doing before it does it by requiring agencies
to analyze  realistically the risks and compare the costs and benefits of their
actions.  It means making sure the process is open to scrutiny by making  it &quot;transparent&quot;
so that shoddy procedures or wildly unrealistic  assumptions used in risk
analysis, and thus in making decisions,  do not go unchallenged. Also, by
requiring these agencies to  estimate the likely risks  not just the most
extreme conceivable risks   the country can have a better idea of what it is
buying with its  scarce economic resources. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Currently, federal agencies typically use only worst-case  assumptions
multiplied by other worst-case assumptions. The likely  risk of chemicals, for
example, is multiplied millions of times.  Thus, the risk is artificially
inflated to seem unacceptable. By that  mathematical logic, leaving your house
in the suburbs to pick up a  carton of milk from a convenience store would be
deemed an  unjustifiable risk because of your chance of dying from a falling 
airplane. Without accurate risk assessments, federal agencies such as  EPA
promulgate costly regulations which yield few or no benefits,  and many of which
probably would not be seen as desirable if  the agency were adequately
self-informed about the likely risks  and benefits of its actions.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 47 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Why should the federal government compensate property  owners for the
loss of property rights? 
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> There are plenty of good reasons. For one, the Fifth  Amendment
states, &quot;nor shall private property be taken for public  use, without just
compensation.&quot;  Unfortunately, the Supreme  Court has interpreted this to
apply primarily only when the  government physically takes your land.
Bureaucrats exploit this legal fine  print by allowing people to retain title to
their property  and pay  taxes on it  even as they take away the owner's right
to decide how  his property should be used. Nor are property owners reimbursed 
for their losses. This is both unfair and economically devastating.  For
instance, if an elderly husband and wife spend a large portion  of their
retirement savings to buy property on which to build  their dream home and that
property then is designated a &quot;wetland,&quot;  the value of their property 
and their savings  is destroyed.  Unfortunately, tales of financial hardship
caused by government  designation of land as wetland or endangered-species
habitat have  become common. This is unconscionable. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>If the public benefits, then the public  not some hapless  landowner  should
pay to provide that benefit. Thus, if the  government takes away your right to
determine for yourself how to  use your $100,000 property, it should compensate
you for the loss  in value it created by taking away that right. The fundamental
 question is whether they took away your right to use your  property; how much
they should pay is merely a function of how much  that right was worth.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Conservatives often fight regulations that encourage  energy 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 48 -->  conservation. Why? 
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Conservatives are not against conserving energy when it  makes
sense to do so, but responsible adults who must weigh the pros  and cons of
their actions  and who must pay for the energy  are  the best judges of when it
makes sense to conserve or expend  energy in their daily lives. The fact is that
federally mandated energy  conservation is costly in terms of money, human
suffering, and  increased deaths, and sometimes is even counterproductive. For 
instance, Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards  are now supported
primarily by the Clinton Administration and  environmentalists as a way to
preserve fuel. The most serious  problem with CAFE standards is that the weight
reductions necessary  to meet them make cars less safe because lighter cars are
less  crashworthy. In fact, about 2,500 additional deaths and 25,000  additional
serious injuries occur per model year. Although raising  the standard would
raise the death toll even more, that is exactly  what Clinton wants to do. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Energy conservation mandates also cause other unintended  consequences.
Increasing CAFE standards would raise the average  price of cars by as much as
$1,500. And with higher priced autos,  many people would keep their autos on the
road longer, thus  minimizing the very decreases in fuel consumption regulators
are hoping  to achieve. On top of that, older autos kept on the road longer 
would mean increased pollution, not lower pollution. Saving some  oil hardly
justifies the death and suffering imposed by  ill-considered command-and-control
federal regulations such as CAFE.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Isn't cutting EPA's funding just a backdoor attempt by  conservatives
to gut the enforcement of environmental laws they  don't 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 49 -->  like? 
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B> A.</B> No. The simple truth is that our country cannot afford  ever
more expensive government if we are to eliminate the budget  deficit that
threatens the economic future of our children.  Balancing the budget requires
tough choices, and all federal agencies   even the IRS  will be forced to
streamline their operations.  EPA should not be an exception. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The administration of environmental laws will not be affected  adversely by
the budget. EPA still will have a bigger budget than  it had when President Bush
took office, so charges of gutting  EPA's ability to enforce the law are
specious. The fact is that EPA,  instead of concentrating on how we can protect
our  environment under the law, has pushed for ever more paperwork and  control
over the private sector. It uses these new costly programs to  justify its
requests for ever greater funding. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>What these cuts do is require EPA, just like any business  in America, to
evaluate its procedures to cut the fat from its  programs while simultaneously
improving the environment. For  instance, EPA currently does an expensive but
very poor job of  sporadically monitoring factory air and water emissions. It
should allow  companies to hire independent certified contractors to certify
that  they have met certain compliance requirements, much as  accountants
certify tax law compliance. With EPA maintaining a  spot-checking function,
independent contractors would be motivated to  provide honest reports, and &quot;cheating&quot;
and pollution would likely be  reduced considerably. The government also would
save  enormous sums.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 50 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Conservatives talk about reducing costs and saving jobs,  but what
about saving lives by controlling toxic chemicals? 
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> How many dollars or jobs is a child's life worth?  Who can  put a
price tag on human life?  These are impossible questions,  but they are not
really the issue. The issue is how to structure our  laws so that we get the
highest quality of life, which includes a long  and healthy life, but at
reasonable cost. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Reducing costs and saving jobs actually saves far more lives  than many
federal &quot;risk reduction&quot; regulations. Money wasted on  ineffective
programs is not available for more beneficial  purposes, including saving more
lives. Recent studies have made this  point crystal clear. Scholars have
recently discovered that, for every  year of life extended, the average cost for
federal toxin regulations   the kind for which EPA is renowned  is $2.8 million;
by  contrast, the average cost for medical treatments is $19,000, and the 
average cost for injury reduction efforts is $48,000. Thus, the average  toxin
control program costs roughly 58 times more for every year of  life extended
than the average injury prevention program and  146 times more than the average
medical program. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The question thus is not whether $2.8 million is too little or  too great.
The question is whether we want to save the most lives  possible with our
economic resources or squander those scarce  resources in an attempt to
eliminate what are often hypothetical  risks while ignoring that real people
still will die from some other  cause. If lawmakers seriously considered which
environmental  policies actually save the most lives, they would scrap many
costly  rules and use the freed-up resources in other ways that save more 
lives. This commonsense approach would lead to levels and types  of 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 51 -->  regulation that are radically
different from those that  burden America today. In many cases, if the private
resources used  to comply with federal mandates simply were left in the 
industries concerned, or used in other ways in the local economy,  Americans
would benefit far more  and far more lives could be saved.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Experts and governments from all over the world have  concluded in
the last year or so   that industrial activity adds to  global warming. When
will conservatives take their heads out of the  sand and admit it?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Actually, scientists and experts all over the world have  been
coming to a very different conclusion. Fears of global  warming have been
reduced as knowledge has increased, and the dire  predictions of global warming
are beginning to resemble the dire  predictions of the coming Ice Age  also
supposedly man-caused   that was supposed to turn the planet into a frozen
wasteland.  President Bush jump-started serious scientific research on  climate
change a few years ago, increasing the annual budget 25  percent annually. The
results of these billions of dollars are that we  have consistently  vastly 
overstated the risk. Now that we are  armed with much more information, it is
clear the models predicting  global warming were fatally flawed and biased to
show  warming when in reality the planet is cooling. The truth is that despite 
the hysterical language often associated with this issue, we know  the planet
has not warmed at all since we started keeping highly  accurate satellite data
in the late 1970s. Yet environmentalists  now claim even the blizzard of '96 is
an example of global  warming. While it might be nice to dismiss the climate
change theory  altogether since environmentalists are so inconsistent about 
whether the temperature will soar or plummet  although it will be  man's 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 52 -->  fault either way  this would be
unwise. The wise thing to  do would be to continue funding so that we know what
is really  happening. What gives the environmentalists away is that many  of
them are now calling for elimination of research on whether  and how climate
change is occurring in favor of research on what  effects global warming will
have, based on the assumption it  will happen.

<P>American labor law is largely a product of the conditions and  perspectives
of the 1930s. It needs to be reformed. Today's  economy, labor market, and
labor-management relations are very  different from the time when most of
America's major labor laws  were passed. Instead of modernizing labor law in
recent years,  however, the federal government has continued to place more 
regulations, mandates, and taxes on employers and workers. The result:  fewer
job opportunities and slower real wage growth.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Over the past 25 years, the United States has moved from a  manufacturing to
a global service economy, competition has  increased, and more American women
are working than ever before.  Workers are demanding more flexible hours,
working conditions,  compensation packages, and workplace involvement than
current laws  and regulations allow. Employers are straining under 
unnecessarily burdensome regulations, mandates, lawsuits, and taxes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> Reform of America's labor laws is long overdue. The  primary objectives of
this reform should be to:

<P>In 1992 the main issue was the economy. Specifically, it was  the jobless
recovery that resulted from President Bush's tax and  regulatory increases.
Although job security continues to concern  many workers, since the end of the
recession the resilient  American economy has created over 8 million jobs and
the major labor  issues have shifted to wage growth and income inequality. The 
idea that workers are falling down the economic ladder and no  longer can afford
to raise families has become conventional wisdom.  The debate also has developed
a disturbing class warfare tone  that clouds the issue and unnecessarily
polarizes Americans.

solution is not higher  taxes, more mandates, or job-killing increases in the
minimum  wage. Instead, what is needed are lower taxes for families and  reforms
that will increase worker productivity and job opportunities  for Americans
through such things as improving basic education  and encouraging more

current workplace policies and regulations are well  intentioned, their benefits

additional workers.

<P><B>Rising Living Standards Despite Higher Taxes</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>A decline in average real cash wages since 1973 falsely suggests  a decrease
in the American standard of living. Some politicians  are using this narrow
definition of economic well-being to promote  the failed redistribution and
regulatory policies of big  government. Most workers are better off today
because their real  compensation and real per capita income continue to
increase. Real  compensation is a more accurate measure of the &quot;pay&quot;
American  workers receive because it includes benefits, such as health care and 
pension payments, as well as cash. The reason for this is that  workers are
taking home more of their pay in the form of tax-free  benefits than ever
before. Employee benefits accounted for 41.3 percent  of payroll costs in 1993,
up from almost 18.7 percent in 1951  and 36.6 percent in 1979.<A
HREF="ftnt5.htm#16">16</A>  Stagnating cash wages are a
concern,  but government should be focusing on policies that increase 
productivity and economic growth to raise take-home pay instead of  imposing
mandates, taxes, and regulations that limit employment  opportunities and wages.

</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>-     After growing from 1948 to 1973, the average real hourly 
wage (that is, adjusted for inflation) has declined 10.1  percent.<A
HREF="ftnt5.htm#17">17</A>  This decline, however, has not
occurred in all industries. Real  average hourly earnings in the service,
finance, insurance, and real  estate industries have increased 1.6 percent and
6.7 percent since 1973.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 11 -->

<P>
</P>
<P>-     From 1978 to 1994, average annual pay adjusted for inflation 
increased 1.0 percent.<A HREF="ftnt5.htm#18">18</A>  This
long-run increase, however, hides  significant growth differences in the
intervening years and  between states. For example, average annual pay decreased
3.0  percent from 1978 to 1980, then increased 5.9 percent from 1980 to  1988,
and then declined 1.7 percent from 1988 to  1994.<A
HREF="ftnt5.htm#19">19</A>  Further, since 1988 average
annual pay has increased in 13 states and the  District of Columbia and declined
in 37 states.
</P>
<P>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>As noted, hourly wages do not account for the increasing  frequency with
which employees receive their &quot;pay&quot; in the form  of untaxed fringe
benefits. Further, hourly wage data are limited  in the types of employees they
cover (68 percent of all  payroll jobs).<A HREF="ftnt5.htm#20">20</A>
 Compensation  or wages plus benefits  is a more  complete measure of the pay
American workers receive. Real  compensation, by any measure, continues to
increase. 
</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><P>-     From 1950 to 1973, real hourly compensation increased an 
average of 3.2 percent per year.<A HREF="ftnt5.htm#21">21</A>
 Since 1973, real hourly  compensation has increased an average of 0.4 percent
per year. The  problem is not that the average wage has declined, but that total
&quot;pay&quot;  has grown more slowly since 1973. This can be attributed to the
 slowdown in the growth of productivity, resulting in part from  the growth of
government regulations, mandates, and higher taxes   all of which reduce the net
value of a worker's output, leading to  a slowdown of wages.

reveal that most workers' incomes increase over time. The  comparison of average

<P><B>The Folly of Increasing the Minimum Wage</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>President Bill Clinton urged Congress in 1995 to pass  legislation to raise
the hourly minimum wage from $4.25 to $5.15 over  two years. Although the
President and other proponents of an  increase argue that a higher minimum wage
is needed to achieve &quot;a  minimum decent living wage&quot; for working
Americans, a  minimum wage hike in fact will destroy entry-level job 
opportunities<A HREF="ftnt5.htm#35">35</A> for the very
unskilled Americans proponents claim to be helping.  Further, it will do nothing
to increase the income of nonworking  families, while raising prices for both
the poor and non-poor. Instead  of considering a minimum wage hike, Congress
should focus on  tax and regulatory reforms to increase take-home pay and reduce
 the cost of creating jobs. Doing that will promote economic  growth with low
inflation, and increase employment opportunities  and wages for all Americans.<A

<BLOCKQUOTE><P>-     Raising the minimum wage generally does not help 
low-income households.<A HREF="ftnt5.htm#37">37</A>  The

<P>-     Employers' response to an increase in the minimum wage  will harm
workers.<A HREF="ftnt5.htm#39">39</A>  Forced to pay higher
wages when  productivity has not increased, employers tend to reduce the rate of
new  hiring and postpone the replacement of employees who quit. They  will tend
to reduce hours (particularly for unskilled workers) or  replace lower-skilled
workers with higher-skilled workers as  low-skilled workers quit. They also may
consider reducing or eliminating  pay raises and bonuses for their other
employees.

<P>
</P>
<P>Increasing the minimum wage to $5.15 would result in a loss  of around
400,000 entry-level jobs.<A HREF="ftnt5.htm#40">40</A> 
Depending on the  overall economy, total employment may increase, but there will
be  fewer unskilled job opportunities available for Americans than there

declined by 45 percent.<A HREF="ftnt5.htm#42">42</A>  This is

Although well intentioned, even  unpaid leave can hurt workers in ways that are

debarment from bidding on future  contracts. The $100,000 annual threshold<A
HREF="ftnt5.htm#50">50</A> effectively extends  coverage to
contractors receiving 90 percent of federal contracts  and will raise the cost
of federal contracts as these employers  are forced to take into account the
potential cost of settling labor  disputes. The Employment Policy Foundation
estimates the  annual economic cost of implementing the order at between $520 
million and $2 billion.<A HREF="ftnt5.htm#51">51</A> 
Further, the order increases the likelihood  of strike activity at federal
contractors, hurting both union  workers and employers through lost wages and
output, and may  discourage unionized employers from even bidding on federal
contracts.  By increasing the incentive for businesses to set up nonunion 
subsidiaries and encouraging the use of nonunion subcontractors, it  ultimately
hurts union workers' income and job opportunities.

<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Job Training.</B> Both the Senate and the House passed
legislation  to consolidate over 70 of the 163 federal job training programs 
into state block grants and reduce overall spending by almost 20  percent. The
legislation gave states the flexibility to design  unified employment,
education, and economic development programs  that meet the needs of their
workers. It also significantly improved  federal and state performance
accountability. The Senate and  House versions of the legislation are

million workers. The bills  would allow workers and employers to reach voluntary
agreements  concerning flexible work schedules and pay. For example, a  mother
would be able to work 45 hours one week in exchange for  working 35 hours the
next week so that she could have time to take  her child to the doctor.
Currently, the FLSA bars employers from  providing this flexibility, even to
salaried workers, by requiring  the payment of overtime and prohibiting the
shifting of hours  from one week to the next.<A

<P><B>Workplace Health and Safety.</B> A number of bills were  introduced in
the House and Senate to reform workplace safety and  health programs. The
leading House bill is H.R. 1834, introduced  by Representative Cass Ballenger
(R-NC). In the Senate, the  leading bill is S. 526, introduced by Senator Judd
Gregg (R-NH). Of  these two bills, H.R. 1834 represents the more comprehensive 
OSHA reform. It would focus more of OSHA's resources on  compliance assistance
instead of enforcement, give employers a  reasonable time to fix hazards before
a penalty is issued, and restore  common sense and sound science to the way OSHA
writes its standards.  It also is the only bill that consolidates administrative
overhead  and ends duplicative costs by merging OSHA and MSHA. S. 526 
essentially proposes to codify many of OSHA's reinvention  initiatives.
Although, the Senate Labor Committee has reported out  S. 526, the House has not

<P><B>Davis-Bacon.</B> Both the Senate and the House have introduced  bills to
repeal the Davis Bacon Act. Davis-Bacon was enacted  during the Depression
explicitly to prevent low-skilled nonunion  workers  chiefly blacks and
Hispanics  from competing for  federally funded construction jobs. Unfortunately
for these workers, it  has succeeded. This Depression-era law promotes racial 
discrimination in the construction industry, needlessly costs taxpayers billions
 of dollars each year, stifles productivity, and subsidizes special  interests.
Moreover, states are beginning to investigate reports  of fraudulently submitted
data that inflate U.S. DoL prevailing  wage determinations.<A
HREF="ftnt5.htm#60">60</A>  The Senate Labor Committee

<P><B>Collective Bargaining.</B> Both the Senate and the House also  have
introduced bills to reform the National Labor Relations Act.  The House-passed
Teamwork for Employees and  Management (TEAM) Act would enable businesses to
establish  employer-employee involvement committees as a way to give workers a 
voice in business operations to help improve productivity, safety,  and customer
service. Currently, the only discussions of  workplace issues between employers
and workers that are clearly legal  are those that occur during traditional
collective bargaining;  businesses that establish employee-employer committees
risk  litigation and significant legal costs. The Senate is expected to vote on 
its version of the TEAM Act in 1996.

<P>The National Right-to-Work Act (S. 581 and H.R. 1279) seeks  to preserve and

this bill are planned for  1996, and the bill faces strong opposition from
organized labor.

<P><B>ERISA.</B> The Employee Retirement and Income Security  Act (ERISA) was
enacted in 1974 to protect the assets in  employee pension and welfare plans<A
HREF="ftnt5.htm#61">61</A> that provide workers with 
retirement benefits promised by their employers. Reform legislation in  the
104th Congress has focused on the regulation of health  insurance benefits. In
the House, Representative Harris Fawell (R-IL)  introduced a bill (H.R. 995)
which would provide for health  insurance portability between jobs, increased
participation, and other  consumer protections for workers. In the Senate, Nancy
 Kassebaum (R-KS) has introduced S. 1028, which incorporates sections  of H.R.
995 dealing with increasing access to health care  benefits, providing for
greater portability of health insurance between  jobs, 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 30 -->  increasing the security of health
care benefits for workers,  and increasing the purchasing power of individuals
and small  employers. S. 1028 was approved by the Senate Labor Committee in 
October 1995. It is highly likely that health insurance reform will  be enacted
in 1996.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>A few bills reforming ERISA's pension provisions also were  introduced in
Congress. The most comprehensive (H.R. 2037 and  S. 1006), introduced by
Representative Rob Portman (R-OH)  and Senator David Pryor (D-AR), would
simplify pension  provision and distribution rules and improve access to pension
plans  for small employers. It is highly likely this pension law reform will  be
enacted by the 104th Congress in 1996.

<P><B>Labor Department Reforms.</B> Congress also used the budget  process
last year as a vehicle for reform. The House voted to reduce  FY 1996 DoL
discretionary spending by 13.8 percent and  instituted several important
reforms. Among these, the House budget  prohibits the issuance of two
unnecessarily burdensome OSHA  regulations on ergonomics and fall protection,
and bars DoL from  promoting &quot;economically targeted investments&quot; by
private  pension plans.  Both the Senate and House most likely will pass a 
continuing resolution that will fund DoL for the remainder of FY  1996 with a 15
percent spending cut from FY 1995.

<P>The Davis-Bacon Act was enacted during the Depression  explicitly to prevent
low-skilled nonunion workers  chiefly blacks  and Hispanics  from competing for
federally funded  construction jobs.<A HREF="ftnt5.htm#68">68</A>
 This Depression-era law contributes to racial  discrimination in the
construction industry, needlessly costs taxpayers  billions of dollars a year,
stifles productivity, and subsidizes  special interests. Moreover, states are
beginning to investigate reports  of fraudulently submitted data that inflate
U.S. DoL prevailing  wage determinations and drive up the cost of federally
funded  construction projects.<A HREF="ftnt5.htm#69">69</A> 
If Davis-Bacon were not already law, it  would 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 34 -->  never be passed today. Proponents
would be denounced as  supporting discrimination; it would be pointed out that
the  bill's worker protection provisions are unnecessary because they exist  in
other statutes; and lawmakers would object to the heavy,  unnecessary budget
costs imposed by the legislation.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Service Contract Act (SCA) artificially inflates the cost  of federal
service contracts by as much as $500 million per year  and, like Davis-Bacon,
creates an unfair barrier for many unskilled  entry-level workers, who tend to
be poor and minorities. DoL  has long been criticized for the way it operates
under this law.  Despite two amendments,<A HREF="ftnt5.htm#70">70</A>
the SCA continues to suffer from  statutory ambiguity, administrative problems,
arbitrary requirements,  and capricious enforcement.<A
HREF="ftnt5.htm#71">71</A>  The General Accounting Office 
has recommended repealing the SCA because of DoL's &quot;inability  to
administer the act efficiently and effectively&quot; and because &quot;it  is
impractical, in our opinion, to make `prevailing wage'  determinations under the
act in a consistently equitable  manner.&quot;<A
HREF="ftnt5.htm#72">72</A>  Outdated by extension of the Fair
Labor Standards Act to service  workers, the SCA has become an unnecessary and
costly bureaucratic  burden that should be repealed.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Reform the Fair Labor Standards Act to allow employers to  offer
flexible schedule and compensation options.
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) was enacted to protect  unskilled,
low-pay workers. But in today's economy, where  both parents are likely to be
working, its rigid and inflexible  provisions hurt more than they help. The FLSA
deprives workers of the  right to order their daily lives, both on and off the
job, to meet the  responsibilities of work and home. For example, a worker  who

<!-- Generation of PM publication page 35 -->  wants to work 35 hours one week
in exchange for working  45 hours the following week to attend a child's
parent-teacher  conference must forgo five hours of pay or else have an employer
 willing to pay overtime for working more than 40 hours the second  week.
Congress should extend the same freedom to private workers  that federal
employees have  flextime  and allow employers to  offer flexible schedule and
compensation options to their  workers.<A HREF="ftnt5.htm#73">73
</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Repeal the Norris-LaGuardia Act to remove union special  privileges.
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Norris-LaGuardia Act (NLA), passed in 1932, exempts  unions from the
Sherman Antitrust Act, makes union-free  employment contracts unenforceable in
federal courts, and prohibits  federal judges from issuing injunctions to
interrupt violent strikes.  The NLA is special privilege legislation for
organized labor and  should be repealed.<A HREF="ftnt5.htm#74">74</A>
 If there are to be antitrust laws, they ought to  apply equally to all
combinations in restraint of trade, whether by  employers or by workers. The
right of workers and employers to  enter voluntarily into union-free contracts
should not be abridged,  and workers and employers should be able to petition
the courts to  stop union-related violence. While there is room in a free
society  for voluntary unionism, there is no room for the special  privileges
granted unions under the NLA.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Reform the National Labor Relations Act to remove restrictions  on the
ability of employers to create employee involvement  structures and to protect
the free choice of individual workers to form  and join unions, or to refrain
from such activities.
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Employer-employee involvement (EI) committees are a way  to 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 36 -->  give workers a voice in business
operations to help improve  productivity, safety, and customer service. Under
current law,  however, the only discussions of workplace issues that are clearly
 legal between employers and employees are those that occur in  traditional
collective bargaining arrangements. In practice,  employers can listen to their
nonunion employees but cannot respond to  their views without risking litigation
and significant legal costs.  The Commission on the Future of Worker-Management 
Relations<A HREF="ftnt5.htm#75">75</A> has recommended &quot;removing
the legal  uncertainties&quot;<A HREF="ftnt5.htm#76">76</A>
on the EI committees that take a broader, more systemic approach to 
participation that the evidence suggests has the greatest long-term  positive
effects on economic performance. Congress should reform  the National Labor
Relations Act (NLRA) to exempt EI  committees formed to address issues of
quality, productivity, safety, and  customer service.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Section 7 of the NLRA limits the right of workers to refrain  from union
activities if there is a collective bargaining agreement  that requires union
membership as a condition of employment.  Forcing a worker to join or pay dues
to an unwanted union amounts to  deprivation of the First Amendment guarantee of
freedom of  association. According to the NLRA, a worker has full freedom of 
rights except when compulsory unionism enters the picture. The  exception clause
in Section 7 should be repealed.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Ban the diversion of union dues for political or ideological  purposes
to which employees object.
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1988 that unions, as  exclusive bargaining
agents, may not use proceeds from dues to pursue  political or ideological goals
over the objections of affected  employ
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 37 -->  ees. The proceeds from those
employees, said the Court, are to  be used strictly for collective bargaining
and contract  administration, including grievance adjustment.<A
HREF="ftnt5.htm#77">77
</A></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Dues are mandatory even for employees who are not members  of the union but
who may be required, under the NLRA principle  of exclusive representation, to
support it. Federal legislation  is needed to require the written authorization
of workers for  unions to use dues or dues equivalents for political purposes.
Such  legislation should place the burden on unions to prove that no funds  are
being diverted without written consent.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Take action to boost productivity, thereby increasing  compensation.
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Contrary to the practitioners of class warfare, employers do not   indeed,
cannot  unfairly keep down the wages of their  lower-skilled and entry-level
employees. Employers, as well as  employees, operate within a competitive labor
market in which wage  rates broadly reflect the productivity of workers  
<I>less </I>the costs of government-imposed mandates and taxes associated with
employing  a worker. The more productive a worker is, the more that  worker will
be paid. Congress should focus on policies that will  increase wages and job
opportunities for Americans by improving  labor productivity and reducing the
cost of employing workers.  Specifically, Congress should:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Balance the budget.</B> This will increase total domestic
saving,  lower interest rates, and increase investment. The growth in capital 
per worker is closely associated over time with the growth in  labor
productivity.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 38 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Cut the capital gains tax.</B> This will increase investment in the 
U.S. and provide an incentive for both American and foreign firms  to put their
capital to work here with American workers. A  capital gains tax cut also will
make more venture capital available  for emerging technologies and for research
and development that  will improve future productivity.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Increase the skills of the workforce.</B> What is needed is  fundamental
change aimed at improving basic education through  school choice, strengthening
core curricula, and enabling local  educators to improve discipline and set high
expectations. Congress  also should consider tax-deferred or tax-free education
savings  accounts similar to individual retirement accounts, or enabling  states
and individuals to use lump sum unemployment insurance  benefits for education
and training.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Enact significant regulatory reform.</B> The explosion of new 
regulations since 1988 has raised the cost of labor and capital,  created
barriers to the formation of new companies and jobs, and  raised the cost of
employing Americans. This higher cost of  employment in turn means that in a
competitive economy, the return to labor  in the form of wages is reduced. The
regulatory burden needs to  be rolled back, not only to allow wages to rise, but
also to  decrease the cost of hiring workers.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The White House also should take action. Specifically, the  President
should:
</P>
<P><B>Rescind the striker replacement executive order. 
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Executive Order 12954, signed by President Clinton in  March 1995, was an
attempt to bypass Congress and establish new  labor 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 39 -->  policy by executive fiat: a gift
to a constituency that could not  get its way through the legislative process.
The order will drive up  the cost of federal contracts and hurt workers. The
$100,000  annual threshold effectively extends coverage to contractors receiving
 90 percent of federal contracts and will raise the cost of federal  contracts
as employers take into account the potential cost of  settling labor disputes.
The economic cost of implementing the order  will be between $520 million and $2
billion.<A HREF="ftnt5.htm#78">78</A>  Further, the order 
will increase the likelihood of strike activity that hurts both  union workers
and employers through lost wages and output, and  may even discourage unionized
employers from bidding on federal  contracts in the future. It also will
increase the incentive for  businesses to set up nonunion subsidiaries and
encourage the use of  nonunion subcontractors  both of which ultimately hurt
union workers.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Although the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of  Columbia unanimously
set aside President Clinton's striker replacement  executive order,<A
HREF="ftnt5.htm#79">79</A> the President has instructed the
Justice  Department to take all appropriate steps to have the decision
overturned.  The President should not waste Justice Department resources on 
this appeal and should rescind E.O. 12954.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><B><A NAME="Q&A">Q &amp; A</A></B></B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. What should the government do to create and keep jobs in  this
country?  What do you say to the millions of Americans  looking for work?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B>  Outdated labor laws, mandates, and heavy taxes lock  workers out
of jobs the private sector otherwise would create.  Congress needs to balance
the budget, cut taxes, and eliminate  unnecessarily 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 40 -->  burdensome regulations. This will
improve economic growth,  create more job opportunities, and increase the
take-home pay  of American workers. Government mandates and wasteful rules  are
strangling job creation, making employers think twice before  hiring additional
workers. Americans want jobs, and employers  want to hire them. Red tape and
taxes get in the way.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Compared with the 1980s, the burden of higher taxes and  more regulations
has limited job growth significantly. Since the  1990 and 1993 tax increases,
manufacturing jobs have declined by  6.0 percent. We need to reduce government
spending, cut taxes  for American families, and reduce the capital gains tax to 
increase investment, productivity, wages, and jobs.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. How can you support cutting taxes and regulations on big  business
when wages are falling, corporate profits are up, and  executive pay is
excessive?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A. </B>The problem is not that profits are too high; profits are  needed
to invest in new ventures which create jobs and raise  productivity  and wages.
The problem is that taxes, mandates, and  regulations are keeping workers' pay
too low. Cutting individual taxes  will increase the take-home pay of working
Americans. If you look  at your paycheck, you'll see that the real culprit is
the  government, not your employer. Cutting taxes boosts take-home pay  without
cutting job opportunities. For instance, Congress's  $500-per-child tax credit
would put $22 billion per year back into family  budgets so that working parents
can provide for their children in a way  no government program can. The other
key to higher wages is  productivity. Lowering the capital gains tax will
increase  investment, improve productivity, and increase wages. Balancing the 
budget 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 41 -->  and cutting taxes will help poor
and middle-class Americans  more than any other factor.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. The minimum wage is too low. You can't make ends meet  unless you
work two jobs; what's the harm in raising the  minimum wage?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B>  It's a job killer and will hurt the very people it is suppose 
to help. The reason: Telling an employer that he or she must  pay higher wages
to low-skilled, entry-level workers simply means  the employer will hire fewer
such workers. Minimum wage laws  presume that politicians are morally justified
in destroying  some people's jobs and their opportunity to begin living the 
American dream in order to inflate other people's wages. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Isn't allowing companies to use replacement workers  during strikes
just a ploy to break unions?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> It is striker replacement law that ultimately hurts union 
workers and drives up the cost of federal contracts. Outlawing  replacement
workers will simply increase the incentive for businesses to set  up nonunion
companies and encourage the use of nonunion  subcontractors.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Most conservatives said that NAFTA would be a good thing  for U.S.
workers. What do you say now to those Americans who  have lost their jobs to
cheap Mexican labor?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Policies that cause the economy to change and grow  always mean
some jobs are lost while many new ones are created.  Some jobs indeed have been
lost because of NAFTA, but many  more 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 42 -->  have been created. NAFTA is good
for American workers  because free trade creates jobs, increases wealth, and
offers  consumers more and better goods at lower prices. It is protectionism
that  ultimately destroys jobs, reduces wealth, and limits consumer  choice.
Free trade may lead to the demise of some businesses and jobs,  but so does
local competition. What is most important is that free  trade fosters higher
productivity, and higher productivity  generates higher wages, more wealth, and
more jobs.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Doesn't curbing OSHA mean more worker injuries and deaths?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Everyone wants better workplace safety and health. The issue  is
how you get there. A new approach is required to improve the  incentives for
workplace health and safety. The role of the  federal government needs to be
changed from that of heavy-handed  regulator to that of cooperative partner.
Today's army of OSHA  inspectors focuses on fines and penalties. That does not
mean  work. Instead, the government should work cooperatively with  businesses
and employees to improve workplace safety. OSHA's  own Maine 200 program has
proven that emphasizing compliance  assistance over enforcement can improve
workplace safety  and health dramatically. If we take this course, Americans
will  get more workplace health and safety for their tax dollars.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Doesn't somebody who has worked all his life and is  suddenly laid
off deserve help with some job training?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Yes. The problem is that today's federal job training  programs
are ineffective. The 104th Congress is working on legislation  that consolidates
over 70 of the 163 federal job training programs  scattered across 15 agencies
into state block  grants.<A HREF="ftnt5.htm#80">80</A>  This
will help, 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 43 -->  because states will have the
flexibility to design unified  employment, education, and economic development
programs that  meet the job training needs of their workers.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Why do conservatives want to close down the Department  of Labor? 
Who will protect workers' interests in Washington?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> American labor law is largely a product of the conditions  and
perspectives of the 1930s and needs to be reformed.  Today's economy, labor
market conditions, and labor-management  relations differ significantly from
those that existed when most  of America's major labor laws were passed. Workers
are  demanding more flexible hours, pay, and working conditions than current 
laws and regulations allow. Employers are straining under  unnecessarily
burdensome regulations, mandates, lawsuits, and taxes.  American labor laws
should be reformed to empower workers to  protect themselves. The problem is
that the whole philosophy and  organization of the Department of Labor is
steeped in the 1930s and  resists modernization.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Conservatives are not calling for the elimination of  everything DoL does.
Instead, they are calling for functions to be carried  out elsewhere. Some of
DoL's key national functions, like  workplace health and safety, would remain at
the federal level. Other  functions that are not national in scope should be
turned over to  the states, or in some cases to the private sector where they
can be  run more effectively. Obsolete, ineffective, and wasteful 
bureaucracies, however, should be closed.

<P><B><A NAME="ISSUES">THE ISSUES</A></B>

</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Americans are increasingly anxious about the breakdown of the basic social
institutions of society.  Nowhere is this more visible than in the breakdown and
disappearance of neighborhoods. Many once-friendly  and peaceful neighborhoods
are now threatening and dangerous. Particularly alarming is the breakdown  of
marriage and the family. Marriage and the stable two-parent family form the
centerbeam of society,  but soaring rates of divorce and out-of-wedlock births
are destroying this crucial institution and weakening  the development of the
next generation. This means more welfare dependence, more crime, more health 
and behavioral problems, lower educational achievement, and the prospect of
daunting obstacles in later life  for millions of young Americans. Some 92
percent of children on welfare today are from broken  families. <TT><B><A
HREF="ftnt6.htm">1</A></B></TT>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>To a significant extent, government programs and policies have contributed
to this collapse. The  incentives within welfare programs over the last 30 years
have discouraged two-parent families among the poor.  These programs also have
discouraged work and responsible behavior.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Families also have come under assault from the tax system. Today the federal
income tax takes  one-fourth of the income of the average married family with
children  and state and local taxes increase the  total government take to 38
percent. <TT><B><A HREF="ftnt6.htm">2</A></B></TT>  This
compares with just two percent in federal taxes paid by a  similar family just
after World War II. The rise in taxation is due in large part to the erosion,
through inflation, of  the personal exemption and the sharp rise in payroll
taxes.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The next generation is already under assault from the present government's
spending habits. The  national debt is a $70,000 mortgage on the back of every
child under 18. Instead of allowing Americans to pass  a patrimony of wealth on
to their children, entitlement programs are eating their future earnings.
Children  have become not dependents, but providers.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The collapse  almost extinction  of two-parent families in many
neighborhoods has contributed heavily  to the collapse of those neighborhoods.
The absence of fathers means there is no adult male financial  support, guiding
hand, or protection for children. The result: gangs of young men driven by a
destructive credo  in place of paternal guidance, young girls vulnerable to
abuse, children having children, and mindless,  violent crime.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In addition, institutions in poor neighborhoods that once provided help and
guidance to those lacking it  at home have been crowded out by the burgeoning
welfare state. Caring and knowing local people have  been replaced by armies of
professional social workers and bureaucrats who emphasize rights and rules,  not
freedom and responsibility. Effective faith-based solutions to educational and
social deficiencies are  barred from receiving government funds to carry out
their work  and if they are able to receive support, it is  often only by giving
up their religious message.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Candidates need to explain these elements in the decline of American
society, declines already well  ad
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 2 -->  vanced in the inner cities and
growing in our suburbs, and they must warn electors that it will take  many
years to rebuild the social fabric because so much long-term damage has been
done. The key to  rebuilding society is rebuilding the family and unshackling
the institutions that complement the family. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><A NAME="FACTS">THE FACTS</A></B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Rebuilding society by rebuilding the family, however, requires reversing the
harmful effects of decades  of government social engineering. Among them: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><B><CITE>-</CITE></B>     The increase in illegitimacy.
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Historically, illegitimate births hovered at low rates. In recent decades,
however, this pattern has  changed radically. According to the most recent
statistics released by the Center for Health Statistics at the  U.S. Department
of Health and Human Services, illegitimacy continues to rise rapidly and
marriage continues  to decline across the United States. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Recently released HHS data show that out-of-wedlock births represented 31.0
percent of all births  in 1993, up from 30.1 percent just a year earlier. For
certain groups and parts of the country, the rates  are alarmingly high  as high
as 82 percent in one state. For all groups in all parts of the country, the
trend is  the same: steadily upwards at similar rates of increase. 
</P>
<P>

<P>Among whites in 1993, 23.6 percent of births were out of wedlock, up from 11
percent in 1980.  Among blacks, 68.7 percent of births were out of wedlock in
1993, up from 58 percent in 1980.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The most useful tool in measuring the decline in marriage and the growth in
illegitimacy is the illegitimacy  rate (more formally called the illegitimacy
ratio). The illegitimacy rate or ratio measures the number of  out-of-wedlock
births in a given year as a percent of all births in that year. Thus, if there
were 100 births, and 30  of those births were out of wedlock, the illegitimacy
rate or ratio would be 30 percent. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The illegitimacy rate is important because it measures the extent to which
illegitimacy is displacing  marriage in our society. Moreover, it is widely
recognized that illegitimacy is a profound underlying factor  contributing to
most other social problems. The illegitimacy rate is the best possible tool for
indicating the  potential magnitude of a wide array of future social problems.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>As <a href="soc_1.gif">Chart 1</a> shows, the illegitimacy rate in the U.S. has increased rapidly
over the last 30 years.

<P>
</P>
<P>The continuing rise in the illegitimacy rate is propelled by three factors:

<P>In terms of family breakdown and the threat to children not growing up in a

marriage contribute to the severing of society's  former linking of children,
marriage, and sexual intercourse. There is only one large sample survey,
reported in  1989 by the Alan Guttmacher Institute, which gives a snapshot of
the rates of abortion within and outside  of marriage. <TT><B><A

<P>If this ratio is applied (as the best approximation we have from research)
to the incidence of abortion  since 1973, then the following picture emerges:
The vast proportion of abortions occur among those  committed neither to the
child nor to a spouse  in other words, among the unattached. The best way to 
reduce abortion is to reduce sexual intercourse outside of marriage. This means
a cultural change that  depends primarily on the effectiveness of the family,
the church, and schools at their tasks; such a change is  not possible through
government action alone.

</P>
<P>The five stages in the development of most serious criminals most frequently
have their beginnings in  the abandonment of the child by the father. Add abuse
and neglect in early childhood, and the child is on  his way to a serious life
of crime.
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Stage One: Parental neglect and abandonment in early home
life</B> are characterized by different  combinations of the following:
fatherlessness, absence of a mother's love, parental fighting and domestic
violence, lack  of parental supervision and discipline, rejection of the child,
parental abuse and neglect, or criminal parents.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Stage Two: The embryonic gang</B> emerges as young, unsocialized,
aggressive children, rejected by their  more normal peers, seek and find other
alienated children, fail at school, lose interest in education, and begin  to
run wild.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Stage Three: The embryonic gang of grade school changes into a gang</B>
of tough, exploitative teenagers  who gradually become more and more expert in
crime.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Stage Four: Violence emerges as a way of life</B> within the gang as the
more expert learn to do their  crime without getting caught.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Stage Five: A new baby is born</B> to the now-criminal young father, who
stays with the child's mother for  a while before abandoning her and her child.
The mother comes from a background similar to the  young criminal father's.

<P>
</P>
<P>The more single-parent families we put in place, the more likely it is that
increasing numbers of children  will experience this pathway to crime. Overall,
a 10 percent increase in illegitimacy leads to a 17  percent increase in serious
violent crime (see <a href="soc_8.gif">Chart 8</a>). With the continued rise in illegitimacy, we will
see more  and more violent criminals coming onto our streets as they reach their
mid-teenage years. And with the  appearance of these criminals, we will lose
more and more of our everyday freedoms, and will be forced to  pay other huge
social and economic costs.

300,000 addicts. The numbers are very clear:  twenty times more triers, twenty

adults. If they believe that the risk goes up in using drugs, their usage goes

<P><B>How the Tax System Hurts Families</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In addition to the cultural onslaught on family life, the tax burden on
families with children has raised the  cost of having children and forced many
couples to endure a trade-off between time at home and time spent  at work
earning money to support the family. More and more couples function like a tag
team, with one  at home with the children while the other works, or work
concurrent shifts while the children are at school or  in day care.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Over the last few decades, the tax system has removed much of the help it
once gave to parents  raising young children. Rather than defend the family and
encourage marriage, the tax code now does almost  the opposite.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In 1950, the median-income family of four paid 2 percent of its gross annual
earnings to the federal  government in income and payroll taxes. Today, it pays
24 percent. In addition, state and local taxes on  average take another 14
percent from the family's gross  income. <TT><B><A
HREF="ftnt6.htm#48">48</A></B></TT>  The main reasons this
burden has risen  so sharply, other than the general increase in taxes, are that
the personal exemption has been eroded  by inflation and payroll taxes have
risen.

<P>Families with children are overtaxed. In 1948, the average American family
with children paid only  3 percent of its income to Uncle Sam. Today, the same
family pays 24.5 percent. The average family  now loses $10,060 of income due to
the 45-year increase in federal taxes as a share of family  income.<TT><B><A
HREF="ftnt6.htm#49">49</A></B></TT> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The tax code is riddled with other anti-family, or anti-marriage, or
anti-mother-at-home inequities.  For example, there is a child care allowance
for parents who work but not for those who stay at home with  their children. If
two fathers both earn $20,000, for example, and the mother in one family goes
out to work,  that family not only has her extra income, but also can deduct up
to $1,600 for child care expenses. But if  the mother in the other family
sacrifices the extra income to stay home to look after her children, that 
family receives no tax break. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> Moreover, the spouse who stays at home to look after the children is
penalized by the tax code in  her savings for old age. While a working mother is
allowed to invest $2,000 a year in a tax-deferred IRA,  a stay-at-home mother is
allowed to invest only $250 per year.

<P><B>The 1995 Congressional Tax Credit Proposal of $500 per Child </B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>During the budget process of 1995, Congress passed a tax credit of $500 per
child to help alleviate  the financial stress on families with children.
President Clinton, by contrast, offered a $300 tax credit that  is phased in at
higher income levels, phased out at lower income levels, and does not apply to
children  over the age of 12.

Families with two children earning up to $24,000 per year would see their entire

three children earning up to $26,000 also would have  their income tax bill
eliminated.

<P><B>Cutting taxes for all families regardless of income is fair.</B>
Congress's plan will cut the income tax burden of  a family of four earning
$30,000 per year by 51 percent and the income tax burden of a family  earning
$40,000 per year by 30 percent. Meanwhile, a family of four earning $75,000
would see its tax  burden reduced by 12 percent, and a family earning $100,000
per year would receive a tax cut of just 7.4 percent.

</P>
<P><B>Giving a family of four a $500-per-child tax credit is equivalent to

$10,060 per year of its income due to the 45-year increase  in federal taxes as
a share of family income. This tax loss exceeds the annual mortgage payment on

<P><B>The Effect of Debt on America's Children</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The welfare state, with its ever-expanding appetite for taxes and
expenditures, has misdirected and  wasted a huge portion of the money in the
nation's economy. The deficit has soared as a direct result of this  unbridled
appetite, jeopardizing not only present income, but also the future incomes of
many generations.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>At present, America has 70,020,000 children under 18 and a deficit burden of
$4.887 trillion, or  $70,000 per child under 18. <TT><B><A
HREF="ftnt6.htm#50">50</A></B></TT>  This means that even if
Congress balanced all future budgets and kept up with  the 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 11 -->  interest payments, every child
under 18 still faces a future mortgage of $70,000. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> To appreciate the effect this has on the economy, consider the opposite:
Rather than a mortgage  of $70,000 on each child, assume an investment of
$70,000 in each child at birth. This investment would  yield huge benefits.
Indeed, $70,000 invested at birth would grow to over $11,000,000 (in future

<P>The national debt, however, will have the opposite effects on our children:

<P>In solid families with good traditions, parents strive to add to the
patrimony (inheritance) they leave  their children, expecting them to do
likewise for the grandchildren. Parents who not only would leave nothing,  but

profligate spending incur  appropriate scorn and are seen as economic pariahs.
The welfare state is doing this to our children.

<P>A Further Result of Federal Taxes: Family Time Famine. Getting adequate

<P><B>Themes for Reform</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>America's often disparaged, traditional two-parent family is the principal
social institution by which the  work ethic, self-discipline, intellectual
motivation, and moral character are passed on to the next generation.  The
traditional family is the foundation of American society, and when it is
weakened, the nation is weakened.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>For decades, the government has pursued policies which help assure the
collapse of the family. To  change course, fundamental changes are required in a
wide range of policies. These changes embody five themes.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>THEME 1: Reducing the government financial burden on working families. 
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>The traditional family is the original department of health,
education, and welfare, but government  for decades has engaged in punitive
policies which discourage marriage and make it difficult for the  traditional
family to carry out its functions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In 1950, the median family of four paid just 3 percent of its income to the
federal government in  taxes. Today, that figure has risen to 24 percent; when
state and local taxes are thrown in, the typical family of  four now pays 38
percent of its income in taxes to the government.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The extraordinary cost of financing the Great Society and the War on Poverty
has been borne in  large measure by the middle class, especially by parents with
children. In response to this crushing tax  burden, many in the middle class
have delayed marriage and, when they have married, have put off having  children
and reduced the number of children they raise.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Ironically, even as its punitive tax policy discourages child rearing by
traditional middle-class families,  the government continues to subsidize child
rearing by never-married women who generally are ill-prepared  to act as
parents. The results of this disastrous policy are only too apparent. Current
government policy,  which places punitive and crippling financial burdens on
traditional two-parent families while subsidizing  illegitimacy, is a recipe for
eventual social collapse. 
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>THEME 2: Reforming welfare to control costs and require work to improve
the lot of the &quot;welfare family.&quot;  
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>Today's welfare system crushes low-income families by placing
anti-family requirements on mothers as  the price of receiving welfare, as well
as by discouraging employment. The steps needed to change this  destructive
incentive system are outlined in the accompanying chapter on welfare reform.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>THEME 3: Reducing illegitimacy. 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 13 --> 
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>Societies through the ages have recognized that it takes the
efforts of at least two persons, a father and  a mother, to provide the economic
and psychological support needed to raise children. Women who  have children out
of wedlock invariably impose a heavy financial burden on the society around
them. A  father's absence also threatens the psychological well-being of his
children. Thus, societies historically have gone  to great lengths to encourage
marriage and, conversely, to discourage illegitimacy. In the recent past,  the
United States has experimented with reversing this common wisdom by aggressively
subsidizing  single parenthood and penalizing marriage. The results of this
experiment have been disastrous.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>For the well-being of American children and the safety of society, a moral
sense of responsible  parenthood must be restored, based on the commonsense
principle that it is immoral to have children unless one is  fully prepared to
raise those children. To be fully prepared to raise children means three simple
things. First,  the mother and father must be married and committed to a life
together. Second, they must be mature  and psychologically ready for the
difficult task of raising the young. Third, they should be economically 
productive and self-sufficient, able to sustain a family without large amounts
of ongoing financial support from  the larger community.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>THEME 4: Reforming divorce law and strengthening marriage. 
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>Over the past 40 years, government policy has made divorce
easily available, and welfare has  subsidized family breakup. The principal
victims have been children. These trends should be reversed.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>While divorce and marriage law should remain under the control of state
legislatures, it is clear that levels  of divorce and marital instability have
direct repercussions on the federal welfare system and on the  overall
well-being of America's children. Thus, the federal government should use the &quot;bully
pulpit&quot; to urge  reforms at the state level.
</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>THEME 5: Revitalizing civil society. <TT><B><A
HREF="ftnt6.htm#58">58</A></B></TT></B> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>While reforms in taxes, divorce law, and welfare are necessary
steps in dealing with the problems of  family disintegration and the underclass,
they are not sufficient in themselves. Welfare programs in particular,  by
subsidizing self-destructive behavior, have played a huge role in promoting
underclass problems. But  welfare is not the sole cause of these burgeoning
problems: Changing cultural values and norms concerning  sexual behavior,
marriage, work, respect for others, and self-control have played a heavy  role.
<TT><B><A HREF="ftnt6.htm#59">59</A></B></TT>  Members of
Congress and others seeking a comprehensive solution must look beyond reforming
welfare programs  and into the broader culture. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Government leaders seeking to reestablish sound norms and virtuous behavior
within vulnerable  groups would do well to look to the past. Few people realize
that 19th century America fought several wars  on poverty which, in contrast to
the 20th century version, were quite successful. These historic  anti-poverty
efforts were headed by non-governmental institutions, primarily churches, which
saw poverty as  emanating from behavior and individual  character. <TT><B><A
HREF="ftnt6.htm#60">60</A></B></TT>  They took as their
central task the molding of character and  self-discipline within vulnerable
low-income communities. For example:
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><P>-     The Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA)
was established to combat urban crime. Seeing  its mission as molding the moral
character of the young, the YMCA successfully undertook a struggle to  win the
hearts and minds of inner-city youth, leading to a major drop in juvenile crime.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 14 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>-     Catholic parochial education is a dramatic instance of long-lasting
private voluntary endeavor. In  founding Georgetown University in 1792, Bishop
John Carroll argued for the necessity of a &quot;pious and  Catholic education
for the young.&quot;  Carroll hoped that Georgetown's graduates would supply a
pool of teachers  for the Catholic schools of local parishes. Today those
schools provide superior education, open to children  of all faiths, and of
tremendous importance to poor inner-city parents seeking an alternative to
public  education.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>-     The Young Women's Christian Association (YWCA) gave a chaperoned place
to live to young  women migrating to the cities from rural areas. The stability
immediately available to them permitted them  gradually to find the community
life in which they felt comfortable, and safe fellowship after leaving their
families  and original communities.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>-     The Red Cross is a massive private-sector organization which runs the
world's largest blood collection  and distribution system as just one of its
projects.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>-     The temperance movement of the mid-1800s, a response to the growing
alcohol addiction of the  time, resulted in massive reductions in alcohol
consumption and a change of attitude toward the abuse of alcohol. 
</P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P>Dealing with social problems by placing greater reliance on non-governmental
social institutions is  therefore nothing new. It is a return to the fundamental
political philosophy upon which the American Republic  was established. The
Founders, because they understood the dangers inherent in looking to government
as  a cure for social ills, relied instead on civil institutions such as the
family and church.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>This wisdom is reflected in the writings of one of the most astute observers
of American politics and  society, Alexis de Tocqueville. De Tocqueville
emphasized the crucial role in American society of such  &quot;private
associations&quot; as religious institutions, private philanthropies, clubs,
fellowships, voluntary civic  associations, and private moral and educational
institutions. According to de Tocqueville, these private associations  or civil
institutions were more important than America's political and economic
institutions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>One of the functions of private civil associations was to affirm, renew, and
sustain social virtues. It was  their task to inculcate into Americans the basic
virtues and norms which make civilized life possible.  Without these
value-affirming and renewing institutions, Americans would soon lose their
capacity to maintain  healthy families, to work honestly and diligently, to
educate and govern themselves, and even to live next to  one another without
murder and mayhem. In other words, civil institutions provided the moral
foundation  which made the political and economic superstructure possible, and
their ability to shape individual character  and to inculcate individuals with
the virtues and norms necessary for social life was essential to the 
continuance of society. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Over the last hundred years, however, government has usurped much of the
role of civil associations.  One social function after another  education,
charity, and, increasingly, child-rearing  has passed from  civil institutions
into the hands of government bureaucrats. By arrogating to itself more and more
of those  functions, and by monopolizing an ever-larger share of the financial
resources needed for operation of  civil institutions, government decisively
undermines private civil associations. By diminishing and  shouldering aside
value-affirming institutions, government wages war on society's natural immune
system. The  growing underclass and the collapse of the family are only two of
the many problems which stem from this assault.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 15 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>The Crucial Role of Religion.</B> In grappling with the burgeoning
problems of family disintegration, crime,  and dependence, Americans must
utilize all the vital resources within society. History, common sense,  and
research all show that there is one neglected institution ideally suited to lead
this struggle of moral renewal  in low-income communities and across the nation:
the church. Efforts to tackle underclass problems in the  19th century succeeded
largely because they were spearheaded by value-laden religious institutions. By 
contrast, efforts to fight urban poverty in the 20th century frequently have
failed because of their reliance on  value-free government programs.

<BLOCKQUOTE><P>Moral poverty is the poverty of being without loving, capable,
responsible adults who teach you right  from wrong. It is the poverty of being

wrong. It is the  poverty of growing up in the virtual absence of people who
teach morality by their own everyday example  and who insist that you follow
suit.... In the extreme, moral poverty is the poverty of growing up surrounded 
by deviant, delinquent, and criminal adults in abusive, violence-ridden,
fatherless, Godless, and jobless  settings. In sum, whatever their material
circumstances, kids of whatever their race, creed, or color are most likely  to

And on abstinence, he has said that &quot;we need  to send a strong signal that
it is essential for young people to delay sexual activity, as well as having 
children, until they are ready to accept the responsibilities and consequences
of these actions. It is critical that we  help all youth understand the rewards

<P>During his presidential campaign, candidate Bill Clinton promised a tax
credit of $800 per  child. <TT><B><A HREF="ftnt6.htm#74">74</A></B></TT>
 But in 1993, he gave families the biggest tax hike in history, which also means
he has taken more money  and parental time away from the family than anyone in
U.S. history.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>When Congress included a $500-per-child tax credit in the Budget
Reconciliation Act of 1996,  President Clinton opposed it as giving money to the
rich even though almost 90 percent of the monies went to  middle-class and
poorer families. However, as Table 2 shows, the relief to the poor was higher at
every stage in  the congressional plan than in the Clinton proposal.
</P>
<P><B>THE 104TH CONGRESS</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>On Illegitimacy:</B> In the welfare reform package which passed the
House and Senate and which was part  of the budget reconciliation package sent
to the President in November 1993, Congress moved to reduce  the welfare rewards
and reinforcements for increased numbers of children out of wedlock. Congress 
forbade states to spend federal monies for increased welfare payments for new
children born out of wedlock  while the mother was on welfare. (States could
spend their own money for these increased payments.)  The President vetoed the
bill.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 17 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>On Abortion:</B> Congress outlawed the use of partial birth abortions, a
procedure involving cranial collapse  of the seven to nine month old fetus
followed by dismemberment and suction removal. The President  has promised to
veto it.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Fatherlessness:</B> Congress toughened the child support provisions in
the welfare bill which was part of  the reconciliation package vetoed by the
President in November 1995.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Pro-family tax changes:</B> Historically mothers who stay at home to
care for young children have been  penalized in the regulations covering
individual retirement accounts (IRAs). Congress, in the budget  reconciliation
bill, removed the discrimination against these mothers. President Clinton vetoed
the bill.

</P>
<P><B>WHAT TO DO IN 1997</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The key to arresting America's moral decay is to restore the historic
balance between the state and  civil society  to revitalize those private
institutions which are society's natural immune system.  Destructive policy
influences must be reversed, and the beneficial effects of non-governmental
institutions must  be allowed once again to play their full role in rebuilding
civil society.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>These themes translate into the following policy prescriptions:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Cut taxes on middle-class families with children at both the federal and
state levels. 
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>Healthy families are the foundation of a successful society,
and government must seek to strengthen  marriage as the crucial institution
within which future generations of Americans will be raised. The most obvious 
step is to reduce sharply the crippling tax burden it now places on young
working and middle-class parents  with children.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The $500-per-child tax credit passed by the present Congress but vetoed by
President Clinton is only a  first step in this regard. This tax credit should
be enacted now and followed by larger tax cuts for families  with children in
the near future.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Create a pro-marriage tax credit at the federal and state levels. 
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>The current welfare system heavily penalizes marriage between a
mother and a working man. This  marriage penalty should be reduced through
creation of a tax credit for lower-income parents who are married  and working
rather than living on welfare. The pro-marriage tax credit should be available
to  low-income married couples who are living together and supporting dependent
children; the family should have  the equivalent of at least one adult working
full time. The credit should be refundable and should have a  maximum value of
$1,000.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Avoid false solutions.
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>One simplistic solution to the anti-marriage and anti-work
effects of welfare would be to allow a  welfare mother to retain all or most of
her benefits after she has taken a job or married a fully employed male.  But
this approach would be unfair to working single mothers and to low-income,
working married couples  who never went on welfare in the first place. Moreover,
it would give low- and moderate-income parents a  huge 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 18 -->  incentive to enroll in welfare,
at least briefly, to become eligible for the long-term continuing benefits. Such
 a system would degenerate inevitably into one in which the majority of low- and
moderate-income single-  and two-parent families received substantial welfare
payments, raising the overall cost of welfare by hundreds  of billions of
dollars per year. Realistic reformers must seek to alter welfare incentives in a
more  practical manner.

 more information on how to say &quot;no&quot; to a boyfriend's requests for sex

<P>Congress should pass a $5,000 tax credit for couples who adopt a child,
fundable (that is, those who  do not pay $5,000 in federal taxes still should
receive $5,000 support) so that poorer families will be  encouraged to adopt and
not be left out of the pool of adopting parents.

<P>
</P>
<P>While the numbers of children born out of wedlock have been increasing
massively, the practice of  adoption has been decreasing.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 19 -->

among adopted children.  Adopted children do as well as or better than their
non-adopted  counterparts. <TT><B><A HREF="ftnt6.htm#82">82</A></B></TT>

</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Adopted adolescents generally are less depressed than children of single
parents and less involved in  alcohol abuse, vandalism, group fighting, police
trouble, weapon use, and  theft; <TT><B><A
HREF="ftnt6.htm#84">84</A></B></TT> they score higher on
self-esteem, confidence in their own judgment, self-directness, positive view of

 Adopted children do well at school. In 1988, only 7 percent of children adopted

 By contrast, 33 percent of children whose mothers had never married repeated a

<P>
</P>
<P>Significantly, teenage mothers who choose adoption also do better then
unmarried teen mothers who  choose to become single parents. Unmarried teen
mothers who choose adoption have higher educational  aspirations and are more
likely to finish school than mothers who keep their children; are less likely to
live in  poverty and receive public assistance; are more likely to marry
eventually; are more likely to be employed  12 months after the birth and less

depression or other negative psychological consequences than mothers who rear
children as single  parents. <TT><B><A HREF="ftnt6.htm#89">89</A></B></TT>
 Thus, all goals of liberal government programs such as job training,

</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P>Several barriers make it very difficult for many families to adopt children.
These barriers include  anti-adoption bias in pregnancy counseling, with most
counselors not even raising the option of adoption;  misuse of the family
preservation principle in social work, which prolongs the danger to severely
abused  children instead of rescuing them and placing them for adoption sooner;
overload and confusion of social  service roles, with the work of preserving
families sometimes in seeming conflict with that of rescuing children  in danger
(most social service agencies do not resolve this dilemma and leave the burden
to the child);  unsatisfactory protections of confidentiality, which inhibit the
adoption option; unknown, uninvolved, or  unmarried fathers who increasingly, at
local court levels are permitted to block adoption processes; and the race of 
the child and the adoptive parents, with many social workers against transracial
adoptions even if parents of  the same race as the child are not readily
available to adopt (which puts the burden on the child rather than  on the
community).
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Enforce statutory rape laws at the state level.
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Male accountability is needed. In many inner-city communities, when 16- or
17-year-old girls  become pregnant, the father is often four or five years older
than the girl. Such cases often involve statutory rape,  a 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 20 -->  serious criminal offense.
Congress should hold hearings to emphasize the role of statutory rape in 
contributing to pregnancy among young girls, and the states should act
vigorously and visibly to enforce their  statutory rape laws in such cases as a
way to deter such predatory male behavior in the future.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>End &quot;no-fault&quot; divorce at the state level and require waiting
periods, mediation, and counseling.
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In most states today, it is easier to terminate a marriage contract than a
contract to purchase a new  washing machine. Marriage is America's most
important social institution; steps must be taken to restore its  sanctity and
the seriousness of marital commitment. State governments immediately should
eliminate no-fault  divorce for couples with children. In the future, the major
share of the costs of divorce, as well as the future costs  of raising the
children, should be borne by the parent who is at fault (or by the party who
initiated the divorce  if no fault is found). Couples seeking a divorce who have
children should be required to undertake  counseling, and states should
establish a six-month waiting period for completion of any divorce action.
During  divorce proceedings, children should be represented by a separate
attorney tasked with representing their  interests (which often may be for the
parents to remain together).
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Encourage pre-marriage counseling.
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Marriage is a legal and social institution designed to enforce the binding
commitments of a man and  a woman to one another, and to provide the best
environment for the raising of children within society.  Society has an interest
and obligation (to children not yet born) to seek to ensure that marriages which
are  formed will have a good chance of not only enduring, but flourishing.
States should insist that individuals  receive some form of pre-marital
counseling as a condition of receiving a marriage license.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Part of counseling should be an evaluation to inform prospective spouses of
the probability that their  marriage will end in divorce. Modern evaluation
devices such as the PREPARE (Premarital Personal  and Relationship Evaluation)
questionnaire can predict with an accuracy of over 80 percent whether a 
marriage will end in divorce. PREPARE already is offered by thousands of
churches across the nation. It is in the  best interest of all concerned
(especially the children yet unborn) that the fiancees be informed of their 
prospects for marital success before they have embarked on what should be a
lifelong  commitment. <TT><B><A HREF="ftnt6.htm#90">90</A></B></TT></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Fight moral decay through school choice at the federal and state levels.
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The plight of the underclass is rooted in behavior; behavior in turn is
molded by the cultural values  and norms of low-income communities and the
larger society. For the problems of the underclass to be  solved, there must be
a dramatic change in behavior, which in turn will require an enormous shift in
underlying  norms and values. Policymakers must seek to reanimate within
low-income communities the ethical  principles which are the foundation of a
successful society. To combat the growing problem of the underclass,  Americans
need a multi-dimensional policy which harnesses all the vital forces in our
society. But in the war  against poverty and violence, the most effective social
weapon  the church  lies dormant.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The key to harnessing the church's untapped social strength is another
crucial public policy issue:  school choice. Poor parents should be given
vouchers equivalent to the sum which is spent educating their  children in the
public schools. These parents would be free to use the voucher to place their
children into a school  of their own choice, including private religious
schools. If voucher plans were put in place in large cities,  dozens of
high-quality private religious schools would spring up immediately in each city,
operating as adjuncts  of urban churches. Many low-income parents, struggling to
save their sons and daughters from the social  tide 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 21 -->  of violence, drugs, and sexual
promiscuity, would be overjoyed to place their children under the firm  moral
tutelage of such church-related schools, each one of which would function as a
focal point of moral  renewal emanating into the surrounding community. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Unlike Bill Clinton, Al Gore, and Jesse Jackson (and many Members of 
Congress), <TT><B><A HREF="ftnt6.htm#91">91</A></B></TT>
who are wealthy enough to send their children to private schools, poor parents
are left with the inert monopoly of the  public schools, institutions which no
longer can adequately teach simple reading, let alone serve as the focal  point
for moral transformation within underclass communities. In grappling with the
problems of dependence  and the underclass, education voucher programs for
low-income parents are an indispensable complement  to welfare reform.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Liberals will argue that providing parents with vouchers which can be used
in religious schools violates  the First Amendment prohibition on establishment
of religion. This is untrue. The Supreme Court has  clearly ruled, in <I>Mueller
v. Allen</I> and <I>Witters v. Washington State Department of Services for the 
Blind</I>, that vouchers or tax credits can be spent for religious education
without creating constitutional problems. Just  as a widow can place her Social
Security check in the collection plate of a church or synagogue, or a  veteran
can use funds from the GI Bill to go to seminary without violating the
constitutional provisions against  state-established religion, a poor parent may
use education vouchers to place a child in a religious school. As  long as the
parent, not the government, decides where the voucher funds will be spent, the
government  has neither advanced nor hindered a particular religion, and there
is no violation of the religious  establishment clause of the First Amendment.
<TT><B><A HREF="ftnt6.htm#92">92</A></B></TT>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The church is thus America's strongest weapon in the war against family
disintegration, crime, drugs,  and despair in low-income communities. Churches
can succeed in tackling these problems where  government has failed. Instead of
relegating the churches to the social periphery, policymakers must unleash their
 energy, permitting them to play a much greater role in molding the character of
youth and adults.  Specifically, Congress should redirect a substantial portion
of federal aid to primary and secondary education into  model voucher programs
for poor parents in inner cities.

<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. What right does government have to tell people what their moral
values should be? 
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Government is not the fundamental moral teacher; that is the duty
of the church or synagogue and  the family itself, the first and most intimate
source of moral instruction. But government does have a  profound responsibility
to inform American taxpayers about the costs and consequences of personal 
behaviors, including violations of the marriage contract, child abuse, or the
dramatic growth in out-of-wedlock  birth, precisely because of their profoundly
negative social impact on the character and quality of American  life:
increasing numbers of psychologically damaged children, rising crime and
juvenile delinquency,  substance abuse and welfare dependency. Americans are
free to live by any moral code they wish, or none at all.  But they should not
expect taxpayers to pick up the tab, without imposing any conditions, for what 
traditionally has been understood to be immoral behavior. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. What right does government have to tell people what form of family
they are to have?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> From time immemorial, government in every civilized society has
recognized marriage and the family  as the basic and most venerable institutions
of the social order. Indeed, government has always had a  direct 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 22 -->  interest in both the
establishment and maintenance of the traditional marriage contract and the
family,  the mutual obligations of a husband and wife and of parents to their
children. To that end, an entire body  of domestic law has been established,
governing everything from the state's issuance of marriage licenses to  the
preservation of family property and inheritance and the protection of children.

</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Of course, Americans are free to experiment and to have any &quot;alternative
family arrangements&quot; they  wish. But the empirical evidence is overwhelming
that the intact, two-parent family is superior to any other  arrangement.
Children thrive and do better in stable married families than anywhere else.
Their health,  their learning, their income, their mental and emotional
well-being, and their avoidance of drugs, crime,  welfare dependency, and
illegitimacy are much lower than those of children in single-parent families.
America  is stronger because of married families and weaker when families are
broken or unformed. As a matter  of public policy, therefore, it is perfectly
reasonable to promote and preserve the traditional family. As a  matter of
public policy, it is perfectly unreasonable to do anything else.

</P>
<P><B>Q. What has been the record of federal drug treatment (as opposed to
enforcement) programs?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Poor. Federal drug treatment spending almost tripled between 1988
and 1994, but the number  of persons treated actually declined from 1.5 million
in 1989 to 1.4 million in  1994. <TT><B><A
HREF="ftnt6.htm#93">93</A></B></TT>  Most addicts have been
through treatment more than once. As summed up by John Walters, deputy director
of the White  House Office of National Drug Control Policy during the Bush
Administration, &quot;The harsh fact is that drug  addicts like taking drugs,
even though most of them also dislike some aspects and consequences of their
drug  use. They sometimes admit themselves to treatment programs, not to stop
using their drugs, but to regain  greater control over their drug use; but the
overwhelming majority of addicts entering treatment with the goal  of ending
their drug use are coerced to do so by the courts, family members, or employers.
That is why  the liberals who discuss treatment as if it were the opposite of
enforcement show a profound ignorance of  the reality of drug treatment.&quot;
<TT><B><A HREF="ftnt6.htm#94">94</A></B></TT>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. How would conservatives fashion a policy on drug treatment?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Congress should combine federal anti-drug support to states and
localities (estimated at $3.5 billion  in FY 1994) into anti-drug block grants
for states and local communities. In this way, states and local  communities can
use these funds for anti-drug treatment and rehabilitation programs that work
best. At the  same time, it is essential that Congress establish performance
standards so that organizations receiving  funds demonstrate that they are
effective in treating addicts. Interestingly, some of the best drug and  alcohol
treatment and rehabilitation programs in the nation are those that are connected
with religious or  faith-based institutions. They are successful precisely
because they are able to effect a deep internal or spiritual  commitment on the
part of addicts to resist the use of illegal drugs or the abuse of alcohol.

<P><B><A NAME="ISSUES">THE ISSUES</A>
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Since World War II, Presidents and Members of Congress  have promised
American taxpayers that they would reform, in a  serious way, America's failed
welfare system. The reality, however, is  that the system keeps growing, new
programs are introduced  when earlier reforms do not work, and the level of
spending on  federal and state welfare programs continues to increase. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>There is a growing consensus that the current welfare system is  a disaster,
not only for taxpayers who are required to pay ever  larger amounts of money to
maintain and expand the system, but also  for the poor who supposedly are being
helped by it. While liberals  and conservatives agree that the current welfare
system is badly  broken, only conservatives have been prepared to take the steps
 to achieve structural reform  in 1995, liberals actually fought  to block
reform. In the election of 1996, conservative  candidates need to articulate the
clear choice. In particular, they must  remind voters that:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>President Clinton promised serious welfare reform, but when  Congress
sent him legislation that would have accomplished this,  he vetoed it.</B>
Welfare reform remains a major domestic issue for  the President and Congress.
While the President promised in 1992  &quot;to 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 2 -->  end welfare as we know it,&quot;
the Clinton Administration's bill  did nothing of the sort. It did not stop
exploding welfare costs. It  did not establish meaningful work requirements. And
it did not  address the persistent problem of additional out-of-wedlock  births
among women who are getting welfare benefits. While  the President's bill
proposed a two-year time limit on welfare, a  reading of the fine print revealed
that it merely placed a few  welfare recipients in government &quot;make work&quot;
jobs while allowing  them to remain on welfare. Moreover, the work requirements
were  truly weak. The bill required only 7 percent of the welfare population  to
enroll in the work program by 1999, and would have  required those enrolled to
work for only 15 hours per week. Worse,  instead of controlling spending, the
Clinton plan would have continued  the automatic and rapid growth of welfare
spending.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>On the other hand, Congress passed a serious welfare reform  bill that
establishes serious work requirements, addresses the  problem of illegitimacy,
and slows the growth in federal welfare  spending. The President vetoed this
bill. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Current welfare costs are rising, and without some fiscal  discipline
imposed by Congress, taxpayers will be saddled with  enormous future tax
burdens.</B>  There are 77 overlapping welfare programs  to assist Americans
officially designated as poor. Total  welfare spending in the United States
exceeds $324 billion, or over  $3,400 for each taxpaying household in the United
States. Of this  spending, 72 percent is federal and 28 percent is state. About
90  percent of all state welfare spending is on federally designed welfare 
programs.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Liberals in Congress strongly support federal welfare  programs, 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 3 -->  defend the current rate of
spending for these programs, and  oppose even modest reductions in the rate of
growth of welfare  spending. At current rates, the United States will be
spending $500 billion  on welfare by 1999, or a full 6 percent of the gross
national  product (GNP). Under current federal spending scenarios, this would 
mean $2 on welfare for every $1 we now spend on national defense. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Most important, serious welfare reform must address the illegitimacy
crisis.</B> In 1959, 28 percent of poor families with  children were headed by
women. By 1991, 61 percent of poor families  with children were headed by single
women. The illegitimate birth  rate among white high school dropouts is now a
stunning 48 percent. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Aside from its relationship to federal welfare policy,  America's overall
rate of illegitimacy is a social catastrophe. The social  science literature on
the subject is unambiguous and  indisputable: Children born out of wedlock do
not have the same chances in  life as do children born into intact two-parent
families. Children  born out of wedlock have lower levels of educational 
achievement, lower economic achievement, increased psychological and  behavioral
problems, and a greater propensity to substance abuse,  juvenile delinquency,
and crime. For the President and Congress,  the key relationship between the
growing problem of illegitimacy  and welfare policy is this: Should illegitimacy
be the basis of a  government entitlement to benefits?  Americans either are or
are not  going to subsidize illegitimacy. There are no compromises on  this
point. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Needed: A Serious Policy for Welfare  Reform.</B> In overhauling this
failed system, policymakers should be guided by the  following four themes: 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 4 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>1)  Reduce illegitimacy.</B> First, and most important,
welfare  reform must seek to reduce the illegitimate birth rate and promote the 
formation of stable two-parent families. Any &quot;reform&quot; that does  not
dramatically reduce the illegitimate birth rate will not save  money and will
fail to help America's children. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>2)  Demand reciprocity and work.</B> Reform must convert  welfare from a
one-way handout into a system of mutual responsibility  in which welfare
recipients are given aid but also are expected  to contribute something to
society for the assistance given. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>3)  Get costs under control.</B> Reform must control soaring  welfare
costs, which are slowly bankrupting the nation.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>4)  Promote moral renewal.</B> Halting the growth of the  underclass
ultimately will require not only welfare reform, but also moral  and cultural
renewal. The government can assist in the process  of moral rebuilding by
allowing private social institutions, such  as churches and other community
institutions, to play a far  greater role in educating and shaping the moral
code of young  people. Among other steps needed to do this, parents must be
given  far greater choice in how their children are educated, including  the
right to use government vouchers to send their children to  religious schools.

<P><B><A NAME="FACTS">THE FACTS</A> </B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Social collapse over the last 30 years has coincided with growth  in the
welfare state. The U.S. welfare system may be defined as  the total set of
government programs, federal and state, explicitly  de
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 5 -->  signed to assist poor and
low-income Americans. Current  welfare assistance has three ostensible
objectives: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>1) Sustaining</B> living standards through cash and non-cash transfers, 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>2) Promoting</B> self-sufficiency, and
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>3) Aiding </B>economically distressed communities.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Most welfare programs are individually means-tested.  Means-tested programs
restrict eligibility for benefits to persons with  non-welfare income below a
certain level. Individuals with  non-welfare income above a specified cutoff
level cannot receive aid. Thus,  for example, food stamps and Aid to Families
with Dependent  Children (AFDC) are means-tested, and thus constitute welfare, 
but Social Security benefits are not. Some 94 percent of total  welfare spending
takes the form of means-tested aid given directly to  individuals. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Other welfare programs are community-targeted or  categorical.
Community-targeted programs provide assistance to  communities which contain a
high percentage of poor and low-income  persons or are economically distressed.
Some 5.2 percent of welfare  spending is directed through programs of this kind.
Pure categorical  programs provide aid to specific disadvantaged or generally 
needy groups, such as migrant farm workers, homeless persons, or  abandoned
children, without a formal means test. Only 1.2 percent  of total welfare
spending is dedicated to simple categorical programs.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>The Size of the Welfare System
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 6 --> 
</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The federal government currently runs 77 major interrelated  and overlapping
welfare programs. Many states also operate their  own independent programs. This
federal and state welfare system  now includes cash aid, food, medical aid,
housing aid, energy aid,  jobs and training, targeted and means-tested
education, social  service, and urban and community development programs. A list
of the  80 major federal and state welfare programs covered in this study  is
provided in the Heritage Foundation  monograph<I> America's Failed $5.4
Trillion War on  Poverty</I>.<A HREF="ftnt7.htm#1">1</A>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>-     In 1993, 48 percent of total welfare spending was devoted
to  medical programs. Cash programs took 22.1 percent. Food,  housing, and
energy programs comprised 18.8 percent of the total,  while education aid, job
training, social services, and urban and  community aid accounted for 11.1
percent.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>-     Total federal and state spending on welfare programs was  $324.3
billion in FY 1993. Of that total, $234.3 billion (72 percent)  came from
federal funding and $90 billion (28 percent) came from  state or local funds. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>-     Welfare spending is so large it is difficult to comprehend. One  way
to make it more tangible is to recognize that, on average, the  cost of the
welfare system amounted to $3,357 in taxes from  each household that paid
federal income tax in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>-     Federal and state welfare spending is now the third largest  category
of total government spending, ranking below the first  (combined Social Security
and Medicare) and second (total  government spending on general education) but
above the fourth (national  defense).

<P><B>How the Welfare State Has Grown</B><A
HREF="ftnt7.htm#2">2</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>For the first 150 years of U.S. history, the government played  little role
in welfare.<A HREF="ftnt7.htm#3">3</A>  Charity or welfare
was conducted largely by  private religious organizations. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>As late as 1929, before the onset of the Great Depression,  federal, state,
and local welfare expenditures were only $90 million.  Adjusted into 1993
dollars, this would be $813 million.  Public-sector welfare spending in 1929
amounted to $6.68 per person in  1993 dollars. (Unless noted otherwise, all
spending figures in this  section have been adjusted for inflation into constant
1993 dollars.)
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Charts 1 and 2 show the growth in welfare since 1929. The  Great Depression,
which threw nearly a quarter of the labor force out  of work, led to a dramatic
change in government welfare  spending. Expenditures for work relief welfare
programs such as the  Civilian Conservation Corps, Works Progress
Administration, and  Civil Works Administration grew rapidly. By 1939, welfare
spending  hit a peak of $46.6 billion  compared with less than $1 billion  in
1929 (expressed in 1993 dollars). 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In inflation-adjusted terms, welfare spending would not return  to the 1939
peak until the onset of the War on Poverty a  quarter-century later. The major
Great Depression anti-poverty programs  were terminated at the beginning of
World War II. In the post-war  period, welfare spending remained low relative to
the 1930s. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In 1950, total welfare spending by federal, state, and local  governments
was $18.8 billion (in 1993 dollars), less than the cost of  the food stamp
program alone in 1993. During the 1950s and  early 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 8 -->  1960s, welfare spending grew
slowly, reaching $34.9 billion  in 1964 at the onset of the War on Poverty. In
1964, welfare  absorbed 1.2 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) as compared
with  1.1 percent in 1950.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>The Explosion in Spending.</B> In his 1964 State of the Union  address,
President Lyndon Johnson announced the &quot;War on Poverty.&quot;   New
legislation and spending initiatives began to take effect  by 1965. Between 1965
and 1970, over two dozen separate  federal welfare programs were created.
Eligibility for older  programs, such as Aid to Families with Dependent Children
and food  stamps, was expanded. In three years (1965-1968), welfare spending  in
constant dollars more than doubled, rising from $38.3 billion  to $80.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In the first decade of the War on Poverty, there was  explosive growth in
all categories of welfare spending. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Between 1965 and 1975, measured in constant dollars, cash  aid nearly
tripled, social service spending tripled, medical aid  almost quintupled, food
aid did quintuple, housing spending  increased sevenfold, and job training funds
increased fifteenfold. By  1975, total welfare spending had reached $119.4
billion (in  constant 1993 dollars), almost a fivefold increase compared with
1965  levels after adjusting for inflation. While total welfare spending 
absorbed 1.3 percent of GDP in 1965, just ten years later, some  3.8 percent of
the economy was devoted to welfare.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Since 1975 welfare spending has continued to grow rapidly,  although not at
the record pace of the 1965-1975 decade. 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 9 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>-     In constant dollars, federal, state, and local welfare
spending  rose from $158 billion in 1975 to $324 billion in 1993. After 
adjusting for inflation, welfare spending has risen in every year but two  from
1965 to the present.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>-     Welfare spending is now 8.4 times greater than in 1965 when  the War
on Poverty began.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>-     Cash, food, housing, and energy aid are six times greater  today than
when the War on Poverty began. 
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P>Charts <a href="welf_1.gif">1</a> and <a href="welf_2.gif">2</a> also belie the political myth that President  Reagan slashed
welfare spending. As the charts clearly show,  welfare spending grew during
Reagan's presidency. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>-      Total welfare spending was $199 billion in 1980 when 
Ronald Reagan was elected President. By 1988, his last year in  office, welfare
spending reached $230 billion. Cash, food, housing,  and energy spending rose
from $89 billion to $102 billion over  the same period (all figures in constant
1993 dollars). Ronald  Reagan did not reduce welfare spending; he merely slowed
its  explosive growth rate.
</P>
<P>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Claims that Reagan cut welfare spending utilize the simple trick  of
selecting one or two programs in the list of 80 welfare  programs and
deliberately not counting the rest. By selecting one or two  programs that have
been reduced while ignoring the rapid growth  in the other 78, it is possible to
&quot;prove&quot; in every single year that  welfare has been &quot;slashed&quot;
when in fact aggregate spending  continues to increase.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 10 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>While Reagan slowed the growth of welfare spending, it  exploded during the
Bush presidency at rates that rivaled those of the  late 1960s. In constant 1993
dollars, total welfare spending rose  from $224 billion in 1988, when Bush was
elected, to $324 billion  in 1993, when Clinton assumed the presidency: a $100
billion  increase in five years.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Spending Per Low-Income Person. </B>A second way of  examining the
growth of welfare spending is to compare spending  increases with the growth of
the U.S. population. Chart 3 shows total  welfare spending divided by the number
of persons in the lowest  income quarter of the population. This calculation
provides a  reasonably accurate picture of the level of welfare resources 
available relative to the pool of potential  recipients.<A
HREF="ftnt7.htm#4">4</A>  Chart 3 reveals a now-familiar
pattern. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>-     Welfare spending per low-income person was nearly zero in
 1929 but shot up during the Great Depression, reaching a peak of  $1,419 per
low-income person (in 1993 dollars). After World War  II, spending fell to low
levels and remained relatively constant  until the start of the War on Poverty
in 1965. Between 1965 and  1975, spending exploded, growing from $789 per person
to $2,938  (both figures in 1993 dollars). Spending grew moderately during  the
Carter years, leveling off during the Reagan presidency and  then exploding
again during the Bush era. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>-     By 1993, total welfare spending per low-income person  reached $5,023.
In constant dollars, this was three times higher than  the peak level in the
Great Depression.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P><a href="welf_4.gif">Chart 4</a> shows the same trends in per capita spending but  limits 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 11 -->  welfare spending figures to cash,
food, housing, and energy  aid. As in the <a href="welf_3.gif">previous chart</a>, welfare spending (in
this case cash,  food, housing, and energy) is divided by the number of persons
in  the lowest income quarter of the population. The chart clearly  rebuts the
claim that the growth in welfare spending has been limited  to medical programs.
The pattern is identical to that of the  previous charts. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>-     In constant dollars, welfare spending for the limited
basic  programs peaked during the Great Depression, remained  relatively low and
constant during the 1950s and 1960s, exploded upward  at the onset of the War on
Poverty, and remained in a nearly  vertical climb until the mid-1970s. Spending
leveled off during the  Reagan years and spiked sharply upward again in the late
1980s and  early 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>-     In constant dollars, cash, food, housing, and energy aid per  person
is nearly five times higher today than at the beginning of the  War on Poverty.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Welfare Spending as a Share of GDP. </B>Another way to assess  the
growth in welfare spending is to measure the share of the  total economy which
is absorbed by welfare. Chart 5 shows total  federal, state, and local welfare
spending as a percentage of gross  domestic product. The data match the patterns
shown in Charts  1 through 4.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>-     During the Great Depression, welfare spending rose to
around  4 percent of GDP, peaking at 4.8 percent in 1939. The growth  of
spending as a share of GDP was driven both by increases in  real spending and by
shrinkage in the size of the economy due to  the 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 12 -->  Depression. It is also important
to note that most welfare  spending during the Depression was for work relief
programs, such as  the Civilian Conservation Corps, which bear little
resemblance  to most of today's welfare programs.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>-     After World War II, welfare spending fell to 0.5 percent of GDP.  It
rose to slightly over 1 percent in 1950 and remained at that  level through the
early 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>-     With the onset of the War on Poverty, a massive share of  the economy
was rapidly diverted to welfare programs.  Welfare spending rose to over 4
percent by the mid-1970s. During  the Reagan years, a slowdown in the growth of
spending, coupled  with a growing economy, led to slight declines in welfare as
a share  of GDP. By 1988, welfare spending was 3.75 percent of GDP.  The Bush
era quickly reversed this trend; by 1993, welfare  constituted 5.08 percent of
GDP, a new record level exceeding the  previous peak set during the Great
Depression.

<P>
</P>
<P><B>Comparing Welfare with Other Government Programs. 
</B>A final way to assess the growth in welfare spending is to compare it  to
the increase in spending on other government functions (Chart 6). 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>-     Since the onset of the War on Poverty, means-tested 
welfare spending by federal, state, and local governments has grown  more
rapidly than spending on all other major government functions.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>-     In 1965, the U.S. spent 17 cents on welfare for each dollar  spent on
national defense. By 1993, this had risen to $1.11 on  welfare for each dollar
spent on defense.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 13 -->

<P>-     In 1965, the U.S. spent 29 cents on welfare for every dollar  spent on

<P>As <a href="welf_8.gif">Chart 8</a> also shows, the $5.4 trillion cost of the War on  Poverty nearly
equals the entire cost of the private-sector industrial  and business
infrastructure of the U.S.<A HREF="ftnt7.htm#8">8</A>  For
$5.4 trillion one can  purchase every factory, all the manufacturing equipment,
and  every office building in the U.S. With the leftover funds, one could  go on

<P>
</P>
<P>It is interesting to note the total cost of the many peripheral  programs
which often are ignored in calculating the cost of welfare  or the War on
Poverty. For example, the $172 billion spent on  urban and community development
is nearly enough to buy the  entire plant and equipment of every auto
manufacturer, every airline,  and every trucking company in the U.S. The $445
billion price tag  for job training and social services for low-income Americans
 would purchase all the steel plants, all the factories producing new 
industrial equipment, all the electronics manufacturing plants, and  all the
furniture plants in the U.S., as well as the whole U.S.  commer
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 15 -->  cial maritime fleet. With the
$440 billion which the  government has spent in housing and energy aid, one
could purchase the  entire U.S. construction industry, all the hotels in the

<P><B>Impact of the Welfare State on Families and Individuals
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Two Kinds of Poverty.</B> The growth of the welfare state has had  a
huge impact on U.S. society. In order to unravel its  effects, policymakers must
begin by understanding two separate  concepts: &quot;material poverty&quot; and &quot;behavioral
poverty.&quot; 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Material Poverty.</B> Material poverty means, in the simplest  sense,
having a family income below the official poverty income  threshold, which was
$14,763 for a family of four in 1993. To the  man on the street, to say someone
is poor implies that he is  malnourished, poorly clothed, and living in filthy,
dilapidated, and  overcrowded housing. In reality, there is little material
poverty in  the U.S. as the public generally understands the  term.<A
HREF="ftnt7.htm#10">10</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In 1990, after adjusting for inflation, per capita expenditures of  the
lowest income one-fifth of the U.S. population exceeded the  per capita income
of the median American household in  1960.<A
HREF="ftnt7.htm#11">11</A>  There is little or no
poverty-induced malnutrition in the U.S.  Persons defined as poor by the U.S.
government have almost the  same average consumption of protein, vitamins, and
other nutrients  as persons in the upper middle class.<A
HREF="ftnt7.htm#12">12</A> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Children living in poverty today, far from being  malnourished, actually
grow up to be one inch taller and ten pounds heavier  than the average child of
the same age in the general population in  the 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 16 -->  late 1950s.<A
HREF="ftnt7.htm#13">13</A>  The principal nutrition-related
problem facing  poor persons in the U.S. today is obesity, not hunger; the poor
have  a higher rate of obesity than do members of other  socioeconomic groups in
the U.S.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Similarly, poor Americans have more housing space and are  less likely to be
overcrowded than is the average citizen in  Western Europe.<A
HREF="ftnt7.htm#14">14</A>  Nearly all of America's poor live
in decent housing  that is reasonably well-maintained. In fact, nearly 40
percent of  the households defined as poor by the U.S. government actually  own
their own homes.<A HREF="ftnt7.htm#15">15</A> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Behavioral Poverty.</B> Behavioral poverty, by contrast, refers to  a
breakdown in the values and conduct which lead to the  formation of healthy
families, stable personalities, and self-sufficiency.  Behavioral poverty
incorporates a cluster of severe social  pathologies, including eroded work
ethic and dependency, lack of  educational aspiration and achievement, inability
or unwillingness  to control one's children, increased single parenthood and 
illegitimacy, criminal activity, and drug and alcohol abuse. While  material
poverty may be rare in the United States, behavioral poverty  is abundant and
growing at an alarming pace.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The core dilemma of the welfare state is that prolific spending  intended to
alleviate material poverty has led to a dramatic  increase in behavioral
poverty. In welfare, as in other government  policies, you get what you pay for.
The current welfare system heavily  subsidizes illegitimacy, divorce, and
non-work. The past 25  years have seen dramatic increases in all three
behaviors. The War  on Poverty may have raised the material standard of living
of a  few Americans, but it has done so at the cost of creating whole  com
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 17 -->  munities where traditional
two-parent families have  vanished, work is rare or nonexistent, and multiple
generations have  grown up dependent on government transfers. The disintegration
of  the family encouraged by the current welfare system has led in turn  to
other severe social problems, particularly a dramatic increase  in crime.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The anti-marriage and anti-work effects of welfare are simple  and profound.
The current welfare system may be conceptualized  best as a system that offers
each single mother with two children  a &quot;paycheck&quot; of combined
benefits worth an average of  between $8,500 and $15,000, depending on the 
state.<A HREF="ftnt7.htm#16">16</A>  The mother has a
contract with the government. She will continue to receive  her &quot;paycheck&quot;
as long as she fulfills two conditions:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Condition #1: She must not work.</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Condition #2: She must not marry an employed  male.</B><A
HREF="ftnt7.htm#17">17
</A></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Thus, the current welfare system provides heavy incentives  for individuals
to work less or leave the labor force entirely and  rely on the taxpayers for
support. Even worse, welfare has made  marriage economically irrational for most
low-income parents; it  has converted the low-income working husband from a 
necessary breadwinner into a net financial  handicap.<A
HREF="ftnt7.htm#18">18</A>  It has transformed marriage from
a legal institution designed to protect and  nurture children into an
institution that financially penalizes nearly  all low-income parents who enter
into it.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Welfare also engenders long-term inter-generational  dependence. Of the over
4.5 million families currently receiving  assistance 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 18 -->  through Aid to Families with
Dependent Children (AFDC),  well over half will remain dependent for over ten
years, many for  15 years or longer.<A HREF="ftnt7.htm#19">19</A>
 Moreover, dependence passes between  generations; children raised in families
that receive welfare assistance  are three times more likely to be on welfare
than other children  when they become adults.<A
HREF="ftnt7.htm#20">20</A> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>This inter-generational dependency is a clear indication that  the welfare
system is failing in its goal to lift the poor from poverty  to self-sufficiency
and is trapping many families in a repeating  cycle of debilitating and
self-destructive behavior. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Welfare's Effect on Work</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The growth of the welfare state has coincided with a decline  in labor force
attachment. In 1960, among the lowest income  quintile of the population, nearly
two-thirds of households were headed  by persons who worked.<A
HREF="ftnt7.htm#21">21</A>  By 1991, this figure had fallen
to  around one-third, and only 11 percent were headed by persons  who worked
full-time throughout the year.<A HREF="ftnt7.htm#22">22</A> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Part of this decline in employment can be attributed to the  increasing
number of retired elderly households in this income group,  but an equally
important factor is the decline in labor force  participation among non-elderly
heads of households.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>For a growing number of poor Americans, the existence of  generous welfare
programs makes not working a reasonable  alternative to long-term employment.
During the late 1960s and early  1970s, social scientists at the Office of
Economic Opportunity  (OEO) conducted a series of controlled experiments to
examine the  effect 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 19 -->  of welfare benefits on work
effort. The longest running and  most comprehensive of these experiments was
conducted between  1971 and 1978 in Seattle and Denver and became known as the 
Seattle/Denver Income Maintenance Experiment, or  &quot;SIME/DIME.&quot;<A
HREF="ftnt7.htm#23">23</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Advocates of expanding welfare had hoped that SIME/DIME  and similar
experiments conducted in other cities would prove  that generous welfare
benefits did not adversely affect work  effort. Instead, the SIME/DIME
experiment found that each $1.00 of  extra welfare given to low-income persons
reduced labor and  earnings by an average of $0.80.<A
HREF="ftnt7.htm#24">24</A>  The significant anti-work effects
 of welfare benefits were shown in all social groups, including  married women,
single mothers, and husbands. They were  particularly pronounced among young
unmarried males; the number of  hours worked per week declined 43 percent for
those who remained  unmarried throughout the experiment and 33 percent for those
 who married.<A HREF="ftnt7.htm#25">25</A>  The results of
the SIME/DIME study apply directly  to existing welfare programs: Nearly all
have strong anti-work  effects like those studied in this experiment.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Recent research by Dr. June O'Neill of New York's Baruch  College, now
Director of the Congressional Budget Office,  confirms that higher welfare
benefits increase the number of  individuals who leave the labor force and
enroll in welfare. A 50 percent  increase in monthly AFDC and food stamp benefit
levels was  found to lead to a 75 percent increase both in the number of women 
enrolling in AFDC and in the number of years spent on  AFDC.<A
HREF="ftnt7.htm#26">26</A>  In other words, increases in
benefit value cause a dramatic  expansion in welfare caseloads.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>An extremely important research discovery by O'Neill is that  high 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 20 -->  AFDC benefits reduce the
employment of young adult men  even though few, if any, of these men benefit
directly from AFDC  payments. High AFDC benefits were found to reduce the 
employment of young adult men in a community by some 50 percent.  High benefit
levels apparently affect the work behavior of young men  in two ways. First,
they reduce the probability of marriage  and thereby reduce the necessity for a
young man to work to support  a family. Second, it is likely that many young
single men who  are boyfriends to single mothers on AFDC indirectly share in 
the mothers' welfare benefits; higher benefits thereby reduce  their need for
work.<A HREF="ftnt7.htm#27">27</A> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Effects of Welfare on Family Structure</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The onset of the War on Poverty coincided with the  disintegration of the
low-income family  the black family in particular. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>At the outset of World War II, the black illegitimate birth rate  was
slightly less than 19 percent. Between 1955 and 1965, it  rose slowly from 22
percent in 1955 to 28 percent in 1965.  Beginning in the late 1960s, however,
the rate of black illegitimate births  skyrocketed  reaching 49 percent in 1975
and 69 percent in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>If current trends continue, the black illegitimate birth rate  will reach 75
percent within ten years.<A HREF="ftnt7.htm#28">28</A> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Rapid increases in illegitimacy also are occurring among  low-income whites;
the illegitimate birth rate among white high  school dropouts is 48 percent.
Overall, 30 percent of American  children are born to single mothers.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 21 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Across the nation, the welfare system has all but destroyed  family
structure in low-income communities. Welfare establishes  strong financial
disincentives which effectively block the formation  of intact two-parent
families. Suppose, for example, that a young  man has fathered a child out of
wedlock with his girlfriend. If  this young father abandons his responsibilities
to the mother and  child, government will step in and support the mother and
child  with welfare. If the mother has a second child out of wedlock, as  is
common, average combined benefits will reach around  $13,000 per year.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>If, on the other hand, the young man does what society believes  is morally
correct (marries the mother and takes a job to support  his family), government
policy takes the opposite course.  Welfare benefits are almost completely
eliminated, and if the young  father makes more than a modest salary, the
federal government  begins taking away his income through taxes. The federal
Welfare  Reform Act of 1988 permits the young father to marry the  mother and
join the family to receive welfare, but only as long as he  does not work. Once
he takes a full-time job to support his family,  welfare benefits are eliminated
and the father's earnings are subject  to taxation.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Largely because of welfare, illegitimacy and single  parenthood have become
the conventional &quot;lifestyle option&quot; for raising  children in many
low-income communities. As <I>Washington  Post</I> reporter Leon Dash has shown
in his  book<I> When Children Want Children,</I> most unwed teen mothers
conceive and deliver  their babies deliberately rather than  accidentally.<A
HREF="ftnt7.htm#29">29</A>  While young women do not
necessarily bear unwanted children in order to  reap windfall profits from
welfare, they are very much aware of the  role 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 22 -->  welfare will play in supporting
them once a child is born. Thus,  the availability of welfare plays an important
role in influencing  a woman's decision to have a child out of wedlock. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Scientific research confirms that welfare benefits to single  mothers
contribute directly to the rise in illegitimate births. Recent  research by Dr.
C.R. Winegarden of the University of Toledo found  that half of the increases in
black illegitimacy in recent decades  could be attributed to the effects of
welfare.<A HREF="ftnt7.htm#30">30</A>  Research by  Mikhail
Bernstam of the Hoover Institution at Stanford University  shows that
childbearing by young unmarried women may increase by  6 percent in response to
a 10 percent increase in monthly  welfare benefits; among blacks, the increase
may be as high as 10  percent.<A HREF="ftnt7.htm#31">31</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Another study of black Americans by Dr. Mark Fossett and Dr.  Jill Kiecolt
finds that higher welfare benefits lead to lower rates  of marriage and greater
numbers of children living in  single-parent homes: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In general, in the Fossett study, an increase of roughly $100 in  the
average monthly AFDC benefit per recipient child was found  to lead to a drop of
more than 15 percent in births within  wedlock among black women ages 20 to 24.<A
HREF="ftnt7.htm#32">32</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Research by Shelley Lundberg and Robert D. Plotnick of the  University of
Washington shows that an increase of roughly $200  per month in welfare benefits
per family causes the teenage  illegitimate birth rate in a state to increase by
150  percent.<A HREF="ftnt7.htm#33">33</A> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Dr. June O'Neill's research has found that, holding constant  a 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 23 -->  wide range of other variables
such as income, parental  education, and urban and neighborhood setting, a 50
percent increase in  the monthly value of AFDC and food stamp benefits leads to
a 43  percent increase in out-of-wedlock births.<A
HREF="ftnt7.htm#34">34</A> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Research by Dr. Martha Ozawa of Washington University in  St. Louis shows
somewhat lower but still strong effects: An  increase in AFDC benefit levels of
$100 per child per month leads  to roughly a 30 percent increase in
out-of-wedlock births to  women age 19 and under.<A
HREF="ftnt7.htm#35">35</A> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Similarly, high benefits discourage single mothers from  remarrying.
Research by Dr. Robert Hutchens of Cornell University  shows that a 10 percent
increase in AFDC benefits in a state will cause  a decrease in the marriage rate
of all single mothers in the state by  8 percent.<A

</P>
<P><B>THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION 
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>President Clinton, at the outset of his presidency, promised &quot;to  end
welfare as we know it.&quot;  Unfortunately, the Administration's  actions and
proposals on welfare contradict the President's  public statements. As recently
as April 1995, President Clinton  stated: &quot;[I]n 1992 I was elected to end
welfare as we know it. That  was part of my New Covenant of opportunity and
responsibility....  And I introduced the most sweeping welfare reform the
country  had ever seen.&quot;<A HREF="ftnt7.htm#37">37</A> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Elsewhere, the President has said that &quot;You could not design  a 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 24 -->  program that would be too tough
on work for  me.&quot;<A HREF="ftnt7.htm#38">38</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>But the welfare reform bill the President submitted to  Congress had the
following characteristics:
<ul>
<P><li>Virtually no welfare recipient was required to work.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><li>There were no time limits on welfare.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><li>Only 7 percent of the AFDC caseload was required to work  even by 1999.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><li>Even the small number of recipients required to work were  required to do so
only for a few hours per week.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><li>WORK (the name of the new work program) participants were  to be paid an
effective wage rate of $16.00 per hour.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><li>The bill limited useful work and the filling of government  job openings
with former welfare recipients.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><li>The minimum work requirements were wrongly targeted at  the mothers of
preschool children rather than the mothers of  children at school. (This
provision expanded the welfare system to  provide child care to these mothers of
young children.)
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><li>The administrative cost alone for running each WORK person  was $4,000.<A
HREF="ftnt7.htm#39">39</A>
</ul>
<P>
</P>
<P>The President's plan, called the Work and Responsibility Act  of 1994,
turned out to be more public relations than reform; if  enacted, like so many
other welfare reform measures of the past,  it 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 25 -->  would do nothing but forestall
serious systemic change  of America's welfare system. When the rhetoric is
removed,  the Clinton Administration plan represents little more than a 
continuing rapid expansion of the current destructive  system.<A
HREF="ftnt7.htm#40">40</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>THE 104TH CONGRESS</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The 104th Congress passed a significant reform of  America's failed welfare
system based on three themes:
</P>
<P>
<ul>
<P><li><b>Reducing</b> the growth of illegitimacy;
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><li><b>Reducing</b> dependence by requiring welfare recipients to work; and
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><li><b>Limiting</b> the elements of reform in the legislation.
</ul>
<P>
</P>
<P>Among the many elements of reform in the measure, seven  are crucial:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>1) The bill ends the automatic entitlement nature of AFDC  spending, with
states that increase their welfare caseloads no longer  rewarded by an automatic
increase in federal funding. This  change imposes a fundamental fiscal
discipline at the state level that  is essential to real reform. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>2) The bill establishes a family cap. Mothers already enrolled  in AFDC will
not receive an automatic increase in federal benefits  if they give birth to an
additional child while on welfare.  (However, states will be permitted to enact
legislation to &quot;opt out&quot; of this  requirement.)
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 26 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>3) The bill provides a funding mechanism to reward states  which reduce
out-of-wedlock births without increasing abortions.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>4) The bill provides $75 million per year for a new block grant  for
abstinence education.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>5) For the first time in the history of AFDC, the bill  establishes serious
work requirements for welfare recipients. Up to 40  percent of the AFDC caseload
will be required to work or become  self-sufficient by the year 2002. Unlike all
previous work  requirements in the AFDC program, those in this legislation are
real.  Recipients who do not obtain private-sector jobs will be required to 
perform community service in exchange for benefits according to a  &quot;pay
after performance&quot; rule. Recipients will not receive benefits  until the
required work has been performed satisfactorily. If they fail  to perform the
required hours of work, benefits will be reduced  pro-rata.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>6) The bill properly recognizes that the goal of workfare is to  reduce
welfare dependence and welfare caseloads, not to  maximize the number of welfare
recipients in make-work public service  jobs. It recognizes that the best road
to self-sufficiency is to reduce  the number of persons who become dependent on
welfare in the  first place. Unlike President Clinton's plan, which rewards
states  for expanding welfare addiction, Congress for the first time focuses  on
rewarding states that reduce the number of individuals who  get hooked on
welfare.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>7) The bill establishes a firm time limit for receipt of  federal AFDC
funds; an individual may receive federal AFDC aid for  not more than five years.
States may exempt 15 percent of the  AFDC 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 27 -->  caseload from this limit.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The President vetoed this welfare reform legislation.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Tax Relief for Families. </B>In tandem with comprehensive  welfare
reform, Members of Congress have recognized the need to  reward work, especially
among lower and middle-income  families<B>. </B>
</P>
<P>Congress thus enacted a $500-per-child tax credit in its  balanced budget
package. For the average family with two children, that is  a significant break,
as <a href="welf_t1.gif">Table 1</a> shows.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>President Clinton vetoed this legislation.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Changes in the Earned Income Tax Credit. 
</B>The 104th Congress affirmed the continuing expansion of the EITC enacted in 
previous years, passing a budget which would have raised the basic  EITC rate
for a working family with two children from 36 percent  of earnings in 1995 to
40 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Congress correctly rescinded Clinton's 1993 expansion of  EITC coverage to
individuals who were not parents. Single persons  who work full-time at the
minimum wage automatically have  incomes above the poverty level; expanding the
EITC to include single  persons therefore was both expensive and inappropriate.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Congress did change the EITC formula for parents with  children so that the
value of the credit would phase down more quickly  as family earnings rose above
$18,000 per year. However, parents  in this income range also would be eligible
for the new  $500-per-child tax credit. Overall, under the congressional plan,
95  percent of parents with children would see their incomes rise.

<P><B>WHAT TO DO IN 1997</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Rebuilding the Good Society.</B> The reform of America's  welfare system
should be animated by a broader social vision.  Candidates running for the
presidency and the Congress should be clear,  in this area, about what kind of
society they wish to see for  current and future generations of Americans. This
vision of the better  life should not be confined simply to the need to reform
public  assistance to low-income Americans. It extends to the broader  society.
The chief object of conservative social policy should be  nothing less than the
restoration and support of the traditional  two-parent family. The traditional
family is the foundation of American  society: the principal social institution
by which the work ethic,  self-discipline, intellectual motivation, and moral
character are  passed on to the next generation. When the family is weakened,
the  nation is weakened. (For a discussion of how to make specific changes  to
improve America's social order, see Chapter 6, &quot;Social  Breakdown.&quot;)
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>For decades the federal government has pursued policies  which promote the
collapse of the family. Vast changes are required in  a wide range of social and
welfare policies. These changes  should include reducing the government's
financial burden on  middle-class families with children; reforming welfare to
control costs  and require work; promoting policies to reduce illegitimacy  and
thereby improve the quality of life for America's children;  reforming divorce
law and strengthening marriage; and revitalizing  the institutions of civil
society.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 29 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The traditional family is the original department of health,  education, and
welfare. But for several decades the government has  pursued policies which
discourage marriage and make it difficult  for the traditional family to carry
out its functions. In 1950, the  median family of four paid just 3 percent of
its income to the  federal government in taxes. Today that figure has risen to
24  percent; when state and local taxes are thrown in, the total is even 
higher: 38 percent.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Reforming Welfare to Require Work and Control Costs.</B> A  considerable
portion of those taxes supports a welfare system which,  with its huge costs and
harmful consequences, requires immediate  and drastic reform. Since most of the
funding for the current system  is provided at the federal level, it follows
that the basic structure  of reform should occur at the national level. Reform
should  promote individual responsibility by converting welfare from a  one-way
handout into a system in which recipients are expected to  contribute something
for temporary aid received. In addition, it must  be undergirded by firm
budgetary controls on the growth of  future spending. Welfare bureaucracies are
prolific in inventing new  programs which allegedly promote self-sufficiency but
 accomplish nothing or actually draw more people into dependence.  Without
definite limits on the amount of money flowing into this  system, such
counterproductive &quot;reforms&quot; are difficult to block.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The extraordinary cost of financing the Great Society and the  War on
Poverty has been borne largely by the middle class,  especially parents with
children. In response to this crushing tax  burden, many in the middle class
have delayed marriage and, when  they have married, have put off having
children, reducing the  number 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 30 -->  of those they do raise.
Ironically, even as it discourages child  rearing by traditional middle-class
families, government  aggressively subsidizes child rearing by never-married
women who  generally are ill-prepared to act as parents. The results of this 
disastrous policy are all too apparent. Any government policy which  places
punitive and crippling financial burdens on traditional  two-parent families
while subsidizing illegitimacy is a recipe for eventual  social collapse. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Specific policies needed include the following: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Cut taxes on middle-class families with children.
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The government must realize that healthy families are the  foundation of a
successful society; it must seek to strengthen marriage  as the crucial
institution in which future generations of  Americans will be raised. The most
obvious step it can take in this regard is  to reduce dramatically the current
crippling tax burden it places  on young working and middle-class parents with
children.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The $500-per-child tax credit passed by the present Congress  and vetoed by
President Clinton is only a first step. This tax  credit should be enacted now
and followed in the near future by  larger tax cuts for families with children.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Cap the growth of welfare spending. 
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>No matter how frequently policymakers supposedly end  welfare, the costs
continue to rise. Welfare absorbed around 1.5 percent  of GNP when Lyndon
Johnson launched the War on Poverty in  1965; it rose to over 5 percent by 1993.
With a $324 billion price  tag, 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 31 -->  welfare spending now amounts to
$8,300 for each poor person  in the U.S. Worse, Congressional Budget Office
figures show  total welfare costs rising to $500 billion, about 6 percent of
GNP,  by 1999. To the Clinton Administration, ending welfare has  meant spending
even more.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The long history of bogus welfare reforms, all of which  promised to save
money but did not, leads to one obvious conclusion:  The only way to limit the
growth of welfare spending is to do just  that: limit the growth of welfare
spending. The entitlement nature  of federal welfare programs which permits
unlimited  automatic spending increases should be repealed, and the future
growth  of federal means-tested welfare spending (excluding medical  programs)
should be limited to 3 percent per  annum.41  Most non-medical means-tested
programs should be folded into a single  welfare block grant to the states, with
funding permitted to increase  at 3 percent each year.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>By slowing the outpouring from the federal welfare spigot,  this spending
cap would gradually reduce the subsidizing of  dysfunctional behavior:
dependency, non-work, and illegitimacy. It  would send a warning signal to state
welfare bureaucracies, most  of which, cushioned by a steady and increasing flow
of federal  funds, have found no reason to grapple with the tough and 
controversial policies needed to reduce illegitimacy and dependency. With a  cap
on future federal funds, state governments for the first time  would be forced
to adopt innovative and aggressive policies to reduce  the welfare rolls.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Establish serious workfare. 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 32 --> 
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Although liberals often talk about requiring welfare recipients  to work,
existing welfare law makes it extremely difficult for  states to require this.
Similarly, the welfare &quot;reforms&quot; proposed by  President Clinton would
have made it impossible for states to  operate efficient work programs.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Congress should establish serious work requirements for  able-bodied
recipients in federal welfare programs. The key to  successful workfare is the
number of welfare recipients who are required  to participate. Real reform would
require all fathers in the  AFDC-UP program to perform 40 hours of community
service work  per week. It also would require able-bodied single persons in the 
food stamp program to work. Finally, half of all single mothers  on AFDC should
be required to perform community service for  benefits by 1999.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Under a serious workfare program, recipients would be required  to look for
private-sector jobs. If a recipient cannot find a  private-sector job, he or she
should be required to perform  community service in exchange for welfare
benefits according to a &quot;pay  for performance&quot; rule. Under a &quot;pay
for performance&quot; system,  the recipient would not receive benefits until
the required work  had been performed satisfactorily; if the recipient failed to
perform  the required hours of work, welfare benefits would be reduced 
pro-rata.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The goal of serious workfare is to reduce welfare dependence  and caseloads,
not to maximize the number of recipients in  make-work public service jobs. A
properly designed system must be based  on an understanding that the most
important effect of any work  requirement is to separate recipients who truly
need assistance  be
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 33 -->  cause they cannot find employment
from those who do not but  are willing to take a free handout if it is offered.
Thus, a properly  designed workfare program has its greatest impact by 
dramatically shrinking the number of individuals who apply for welfare in  the
first place. Serious workfare recognizes that the best road to  self-sufficiency
is to reduce the number of persons who become  dependent and &quot;get hooked&quot;
on welfare initially.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Establish sensible workfare priorities. 
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Workfare programs should be efficient and low cost.  Workfare should be
established first for those who have the least  justification for being out of
the labor force: able-bodied, non-elderly  single persons on welfare, followed
by fathers in two-parent families  on welfare and absent fathers who fail to pay
child  support.<A HREF="ftnt7.htm#42">42</A>  After workfare
has been put in operation for the preceding groups,  single mothers on AFDC who
do not have pre-school children should  be required to work.<A
HREF="ftnt7.htm#43">43</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>High day care expenses mean that putting a single mother with  a young child
to work in a community service program  costs roughly two to three times as much
as requiring a mother with  an older child to work. Because work programs
inevitably  operate within fixed budgets, an emphasis on workfare participation 
by mothers with younger children leads to a sharp reduction in  the total number
of persons who will be required to work. One  little-understood aspect of the
debate is that liberals often attempt  to focus workfare programs on mothers
with very young  children precisely because they understand this quickly soaks
up  available funds and thereby limits the number of recipients required to 
participate. Liberal welfare advocates also try to undermine the  gen
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 34 -->  eral concept of workfare by
claiming that all workfare  programs cost more than they save; they promote the
least  cost-effective programs (that is, those with a heavy emphasis on mothers 
with young children) precisely for this purpose.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Around half of AFDC single mothers have no pre-school  children under age
five. Workfare should be imposed on single  mothers with children under age five
only after most mothers with  older children have been required to work.
However, if an  AFDC mother gave birth to another child after her enrollment in 
AFDC, that should not exempt her from work requirements even if  the child is
under age five. This rule is needed to prevent  mothers from having additional
children to escape the work requirement.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Recognize the limits of job training. 
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>A perennial panacea in the welfare debate is that education and  job
training will enable single mothers to obtain good jobs and  become
self-sufficient. Unfortunately, despite over three decades of  experience,
government-run training programs have failed to raise  the wage rates of welfare
recipients by more than a tiny amount.  For example, the U.S. Department of
Labor in 1993 completed a  controlled scientific evaluation of its massive Job
Training  Partnership Act (JTPA) program. This evaluation showed that the 
average hourly wage of female trainees was raised by 3.4 percent;  the hourly
wages of males were not increased at  all.<A
HREF="ftnt7.htm#44">44</A> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The failure of government training programs is especially  salient given the
very low cognitive ability levels of many welfare  mothers. A recent study by
Child Trends, Inc., finds that mothers in  the Aid to Families with Dependent
Children program have  signifi
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 35 -->  cantly lower math and verbal
abilities than other women of  the same ethnic group who are not enrolled in
welfare  programs. When all U.S. women are ranked according to basic math and 
verbal skills, over half of welfare mothers are found to have  cognitive skill
levels placing them in the bottom 20 percent of the  overall population. The
study states: &quot;The average aptitude or  achievement scores of welfare
mothers are significantly below the  mean of even the lowest of the occupational
 classes.&quot;<A HREF="ftnt7.htm#45">45</A>  Government can do
little if anything to alter these cognitive skill levels. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The very low cognitive abilities of welfare mothers, coupled  with the
impotence of government educational and training  programs and the cost of child
care, underscore the futility of  reform schemes aimed narrowly at making unwed
mothers employed  and self-sufficient. What is needed is more fundamental change
 aimed at reducing illegitimacy and restoring marriage. To repeat the  basic
historical lesson: Raising children is a difficult and  expensive task which
generally requires the efforts of the mother and  father bound by the commitment
of marriage. It is very difficult for  a single parent to find the time and
emotional resources needed  to raise a child while also working to support the
family. The  importance of marriage and the contribution of both parents is 
intensified in the case of parents with low personal skills and  earning
capacity. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The well-being of American children requires policy changes  that not only
will reduce illegitimacy and promote marriage, but  also will encourage
potential parents to defer child-bearing until  both the mother and the father
have acquired the education, job  skills, and personal maturity needed to
support a family and nurture  their children properly. Above all, it is
imperative to eliminate the  wide 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 36 -->  array of programs which subsidize
and encourage young,  poorly educated girls to have children out of wedlock.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Replace food stamps with commodities. 
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>A major historic expansion of the welfare state occurred when  the food
stamp program replaced older aid programs which  distributed food commodities
directly to the poor. The current food  stamp program gives individuals food
coupons which they can use  to purchase food in stores. Unlike food commodities,
food  coupons can be sold on the black market and converted into cash. 
Replacing the older food commodities programs with food coupons was  a serious
mistake that further encouraged rapid increases in  welfare dependence and
illegitimacy. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Congress should reverse this mistake. Families on AFDC and  other persons
receiving food stamps (excluding the elderly and  disabled) should be given a
carefully selected basket of food commodities  in lieu of food stamp coupons.
Each basket should be carefully  balanced to provide the proper levels of
proteins, calories,  vitamins, and minerals for the family or individual
receiving aid. This  policy can ensure that no family receiving aid will be
malnourished  or hungry. It also can be operated at a lower cost than the 
current program. Moreover, this policy would eliminate food stamp  fraud by
restricting the beneficiary's ability to sell food stamps on  the black market;
there would be little or no black market for the  donated commodities. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>More important, replacing food stamps with commodities  would reduce
dependence and out-of-wedlock births by reducing  the overall attractiveness of
welfare. Assuming that substituting  food 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 37 -->  commodities for food stamps would
reduce the consumer  &quot;utility&quot; of food benefits by a third and the &quot;utility&quot;
of the overall  AFDC/food stamp benefit package by 15 percent, it also could 
reduce illegitimate births by more than 5 percent and the AFDC  caseload by over
20 percent. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Limit cash benefits to young unmarried mothers. 
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>It has been a tragic mistake for the government to pay money  to 14-year-old
girls on condition that they have children out of  wedlock. The government
should begin to address the  illegitimacy problem by ending its disastrous
policy of giving direct AFDC  and food stamp benefits to unmarried young
mothers. This almost  certainly would lead to a sharp and substantial drop in
illegitimacy.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Today's welfare system mainly involves failed attempts to pick  up the
pieces for an ever-increasing number of individuals who  have violated the above
rules. But from the perspective of society  and the child, to have a baby you
cannot support either financially  or psychologically is profoundly
irresponsible. Government  policy not only must stop subsidizing and promoting
such  irresponsible behavior, but must actively discourage it.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Serious welfare reform must focus on the root behavioral  problems of
illegitimacy and divorce, not merely on the superficial  symptom of welfare
dependence. Despite rhetoric pledging to &quot;end  welfare as we know it,&quot;
President Clinton is unwilling to take the  serious steps needed to deal with
the crisis of illegitimacy. The  Clinton Administration seeks to devise schemes
to help individuals  leave welfare rather than to reduce the self-destructive
behavior that  led to dependence in the first place. This approach is
self-deluding.  No 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 38 -->  array of government programs is
going to make a  20-year-old woman who has had one or two children out of
wedlock  self-sufficient. Nor, despite her best efforts, is that single mother
likely  to be able to provide a truly healthy emotional environment for  her
children as they develop.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>By paying young women to have children out of wedlock,  the present welfare
system encourages them in a course of action  that in the long term proves
self-defeating to the mothers and  harmful to both the children and society.
Placing millions of single  mothers in work and training programs will have
little positive effect  on society as long as the illegitimate birth rate
remains over 30  percent. Congress must go to the heart of the dependency
problem  by seeking to reduce the number of illegitimate births. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>At the same time, government should not abandon all aid to  children born
out of wedlock; federal AFDC and food stamp  funds currently given directly to
unwed mothers under age 21 should  be converted into block grants to the states.
State governments  could use the funds to develop innovative policies for
assisting  teenagers who continue to have children out of wedlock. Such policies
 could include providing in-kind benefits, promoting adoption and  orphanages,
or supporting the mothers in tightly supervised  group homes; but federal funds
should no longer be used to provide  direct cash welfare benefits to teen
mothers. The limitation on  benefits should apply to all children born to unwed
mothers age  21 and under one year or more after the date of enactment. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Do not provide increased AFDC and food stamp benefits to  mothers who
bear additional children while already enrolled in  the AFDC program. 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 39 --></B> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Under the current welfare system, if a mother enrolled in  AFDC bears
additional children, she receives an automatic increase  in AFDC and food stamp
benefits. No other family in America  receives an automatic increase in its
income by having more  children. There is no reason to provide expanded welfare
benefits  to single mothers who have additional illegitimate children  while
already dependent on welfare. A limitation of this sort already  has been put
into effect in the state of New Jersey by Democratic  Assemblyman Wayne Bryant.
Evidence from controlled  scientific experiments designed to determine its
effects show a 10  percent decrease in illegitimate births to mothers on AFDC as
a result  of the family cap.<A HREF="ftnt7.htm#46">46
</A></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Require the establishment of paternity for children  receiving AFDC. 
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Current law requires that an AFDC mother make a &quot;good  faith&quot;
effort to identify the father of her child in order to receive  AFDC. This law
is ignored. The government should require, for  children born prospectively,
that the mother identify the father in order  to receive any federally funded
welfare aid.<A HREF="ftnt7.htm#47">47</A>  Exceptions to this
 rule in a few hardship cases could be made, but they should not  exceed 10
percent. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Modern DNA testing permits determination of a child's real  father with
absolute confidence. Once the mother has identified the  father and paternity
has been established, the father can be required  to pay child support to offset
welfare costs. If the father claims  he cannot pay any child support because he
cannot find a job,  the government may require that he perform community service
 to 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 40 -->  fulfill his obligation.
Experiments with this approach in  Wisconsin have led to surprising increases in
the ability of absent fathers  to locate private-sector employment and pay child
support.  Moreover, the definite expectation among young men that they will  be
identified and required to pay child support for their children  may put an end
to the ethos in some communities where young  men assert their masculinity by
fathering children they have no  intention of supporting.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Encourage state-based &quot;faith and families&quot; programs. 
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The &quot;faith and families&quot; program created by Mississippi  Governor
Kirk Fordice is one of the most innovative and interesting  welfare reforms in
the U.S. today. This program seeks to link single  mothers on AFDC with church
congregations throughout the state,  placing at least one welfare family under
the tutelage of each  church. The congregation effectively becomes the case
worker for the  welfare mother, providing mentoring, moral authority, life
skills  training, and contact with employment opportunities. The  recipient
continues to receive her welfare check from the government  bureaucracy, but
most other aspects of managing the case are  under church control. The program
also is voluntary in that any  recipient can choose to have her case handled by
welfare bureaucrats  rather than a church. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Striking a theme which would have been common in earlier  generations but
has been painfully absent in American discourse  for over half a century,
Governor Fordice has declared that &quot;God,  not government, will be the
savior of welfare recipients.&quot;  This  new policy should be copied in other
states.

<P><B>Reduce government welfare by increasing private-sector charity. 
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>There is widespread recognition that government welfare  has failed  indeed,
that government is the least effective institution  in aiding the poor. Yet,
each year, hundreds of billions of  dollars taken forcibly from the paychecks of
Americans are spent on  government welfare programs in which the people no
longer have  confidence. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Real welfare reform will require rechanneling a major portion  of current
funding into private secular and religious charities  rather than government
programs. Legislation introduced in 1995  by Representatives Jim Kolbe (R-AZ)

to  demonstrate which was the most effective in aiding the poor. Similar 
legislation

their children?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Nothing punishes single parents and their children more  than the
current welfare system. For millions of children and their  parents, this system
is the proverbial free ticket to a bus going  nowhere. The reason: It is riddled
with perverse incentives that  discourage work and marriage while encouraging
illegitimate  birth and long-term dependency. Precisely because single-parent 
family life is much harder on the children, as well as their mothers and  the
broader society, it is no kindness for government to make  either single
parenthood or long-term dependency easier and more  common. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Given the perverse incentives of the system, millions of  parents and their
children cannot escape to a better life, but will be  locked instead into more
of the same. It is a condition that not only  undermines their upward economic
mobility and eventual  independence, but also robs them of hope for the future
and reinforces  spiritual despair. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> Conservative welfare reform aims to discourage single  mothers from having
more children out of wedlock while helping  them through the transition to a
life in which it is economically  rational to marry or get a job. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Why do conservatives in Congress want to cut welfare?
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 43 --> 
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Conservatives in Congress are not proposing to cut  welfare.
Under the Republican proposals aggregate welfare spending  on non-medical
programs will grow at roughly 4 percent per year.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Liberals in Congress generally oppose serious welfare reform  and, as
evidenced during the debate on school lunch programs, do  not even favor
reducing the rate of welfare spending. Total  welfare spending in the United
States is $324 billion, 72 percent of it  federal and 28 percent of it state
spending. Moreover, nine-tenths  of all state welfare spending amounts to a
state contribution to  federal programs. At the current rate of spending,
assuming nothing  is changed, the United States will be spending $500 billion on
 welfare by the year 1999, or 6 percent of the gross national  product (GNP). To
put this in perspective, at the current rate,  taxpayers will be shelling out $2
in welfare spending for every $1 we  now spend on national defense. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Conservatives in Congress simply want to impose some  discipline on welfare
spending, just as they do in other areas of  federal spending. They are prepared
to let already high levels of  welfare spending grow, but only at some
reasonable rate, not at the  explosive rate at which it has been growing. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. But didn't conservatives in Congress propose to cut  school lunch and
women, infants, and children (WIC) programs last year?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B>Congressional appropriators last year attempted to convert  the
federal school lunch and breakfast programs into a block  grant, which would
grow at 4.5 percent per year. Liberals  complained that the original baseline
for growth in the program was 5.1  per
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 44 -->  cent, and thus that reducing the
growth in spending amounted to  a &quot;cut.&quot;  It is patently dishonest to
call a growth in spending a  cut, but even with this modest change, Congress
still would be  wasting federal funds by providing school lunch subsidies to 
middle-class families and even to the children of millionaires instead of 
targeting them exclusively to poor children. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>As for WIC, it was not cut. It was folded into a block grant with  a few
other programs. The money available for WIC, like the  money available for
school lunches, was to increase. Incredibly, under  the traditional WIC program,
benefits were available to families  earning up to $28,000 per year even though
a family in that  income range pays about $6,000 per year in federal taxes. 
Conservative policy for middle-income families is not to give them welfare 
benefits, but to cut their taxes.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Won't spending reductions in existing federal welfare  programs and
block grants jeopardize poor families? 
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Few, if any, welfare programs have operated as expected,  so poor
families have not benefited as expected. The largest  federal program, Aid to
Families with Dependent Children (AFDC),  was designed in 1935 to support widows
and orphans. Only 1.5  percent of the beneficiaries today are widows and
orphans. Instead,  AFDC has served as the financial mainstay of single
parenthood  among low-income persons. Likewise, there are nine different federal
 jobs and training programs for low-income persons, costing an  estimated $5.3
billion.<A HREF="ftnt7.htm#48">48</A>  After three decades of
federal job  training programs, the wage rates of beneficiaries have hardly been
 affected. A Labor Department study of the impact of the Job  Training
Partnership Act, for example, showed that female  trainees' 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 45 -->  wages increased by a mere 3.4
percent and that male  trainees' wages did not increase at all. Five recent
scientific studies of  federal jobs programs for poor people showed that none of
 them worked. Few federal jobs programs ever lead to real,  permanent jobs in
the private sector. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>By combining dozens of federal welfare programs into  block grants to the
states, eliminating tens of thousands of pages of  federal regulations, and
letting governors and state legislators  take direct responsibility and do what
they think is best for their  communities, welfare reform can serve low-income
people more  efficiently. States and local communities, working with  dedicated
people in private organizations in these communities, are likely  to have the
best ideas about what works in preventing teen  pregnancy or in setting up day
care and jobs programs to help lift poor  people out of poverty and dependency.

</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. If conservatives want to lift low-income families out of  poverty,
how do they propose to help them?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> The best way to keep a mother and her children out of  poverty is
to help make sure they have a working father with a regular  paycheck who comes
home every night. Right now, if a young  man marries the mother of his child and
makes anything over $6.50  per hour, we tax his  income. For persons currently
on welfare,  this does not encourage either marriage or upward economic
mobility. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>But by making serious tax changes, particularly by giving  low-income
families generous tax relief, a conservative social  policy would reward work,
increase disposable family income, and  help keep families together. Under
Representative Dick Armey's  pro
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 46 -->  posal to replace the current tax
code with a flat tax, for  example, any family of four with an income of $33,000
per year or  less would pay no income tax at all.49  Moreover, by eliminating 
outdated penalties on savings and investment, conservative tax  policies would
stimulate more investment and economic growth,  and thus create more real jobs,
open up new opportunities, and  generate higher wages for family breadwinners. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. If conservatives in Congress want to help low-income  working
families, why didn't they support President Clinton's family  tax relief
proposal rather than pass a balanced budget plan that  would gut the popular
Earned Income Tax Credit and raise taxes on  families earning less than $30,000?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Even after changing the Earned Income Tax Credit, the  Balanced
Budget Act of 1995, with its $500-per-child tax  credit, would benefit 5.4
million more low-income working families  with children than the Clinton
Administration tax proposal with  its $300-per-child tax credit. In fact, the
congressional proposal,  vetoed by President Clinton, would allow a low-income
family  to take a $500-per-child tax credit first, and then receive the  full
value of the EITC on top of the child credit. Under the  Clinton plan, a
low-income family would have to deduct EITC  benefits from income tax before
taking the less generous $300-per-child  tax credit. Thus, a family with two
children would have to  earn $24,000 a year before becoming eligible for the
Clinton  credit. Worse, because the Clinton tax credit is available only to 
families with children under the age of 13, families are denied tax relief  for
children precisely when the cost of raising them becomes  even more expensive.
Under the Clinton tax credit plan, 2.8  million children in families earning
less than $30,000 per year would  be 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 47 -->  denied eligibility for tax
relief. Under the congressional plan,  a family would be eligible for a more
generous tax credit at  roughly $17,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. What steps can the government take to reduce illegitimacy?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> First, unlike age, disability, or veterans status,  illegitimacy
should not be the basis of a legal entitlement to a  government check. Unwed
mothers can and should be assisted in other  ways, including the establishment
of group homes for unwed mothers  or maternity homes. Young men and women may be
entitled to  a mistake, but taxpayers cannot afford to subsidize further 
mistakes through automatic increases in benefits to women who continue  to have
additional children while on welfare. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Second, sexual abstinence programs should be incorporated  into welfare
reform measures, particularly at the state level. The  data show that such
programs work,<A HREF="ftnt7.htm#50">50</A> much as the Just
Say No  campaigns against illegal drugs in the 1980s worked. Teenagers are  not
stupid. They can see the difference between a young man's  lifelong commitment
to the mother and their baby and the  momentary enjoyment of sexual pleasure
with life-changing consequences  and without the commitment of marriage. All the
proposals to  make marriage more attractive also help to reduce illegitimacy. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Third, it is time to get serious about cracking down on  statutory rape. In
a significant percentage of illegitimacy cases, the  mother is well below the
age of consent and the father is in his  mid-twenties. It is past time that such
adult males, taking advantage of  teenage girls, face charges of rape.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 48 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Fourth, toughen child support enforcement. Policymakers  should inflict
financial pain on men who sire children and then  abandon the mothers. Men
should be made to take responsibility for  the upbringing of their children.
Tough enforcement of child  support also helps get the message across that the
costs of  illegitimacy must be borne by the father as much as by the child and
mother.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. But don't congressional conservatives want to consign  poor children
to orphanages?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> For neglected, unwanted, or physically or sexually abused 
children, state or local authorities might determine that an  orphanage is not
an unreasonable solution. In some cases, it is the only  viable option. And,
regardless of the negative images conjured up by  liberal opponents, sound
policy should include this possibility.  While Hillary Rodham Clinton ridiculed
the concept as &quot;absurd,&quot;  under persistent questioning from
Representative Bill Archer of  Texas, Chairman of the House Ways and Means
Committee, HHS  Secretary Donna Shalala admitted that even under the Clinton 
Administration welfare plan, orphanages would be an option. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Aren't conservatives expecting too much of private  charities when
the government cuts back on the spending increases in  social services? 
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Not at all. First, under real welfare reform, with new 
incentives to work and get off the welfare rolls, there will be a drop in  the
welfare rolls even as there is a simultaneous increase in total  welfare
spending. In other words, there will be more money,  rather than less, for those
in need. Second, under the congressional  block grant approach, state and local
governments will work  directly 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 49 -->  with local charitable
organizations, not only to provide social  services, but also to help poor
people become self-sufficient.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>After decades of painful experience, Congress and the federal  bureaucracy
must admit that neither they nor the programs they  have designed over the past
half century have been effective in  reducing the welfare rolls, curbing
illegitimacy, or making  low-income Americans economically independent. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Beyond the promise of welfare reform, Congress can assist  private charities
even more directly in helping the poor. Senator  Daniel Coats (R-IN), for
example, has introduced a bill that would allow  a tax credit of as much as
$1,000 for donations to charities that  directly help the needy poor. This will
increase the ability of  charities to help these people.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Won't conservative cuts in social programs increase the  number of
hungry children?  HHS says that over 1 million people will  be thrown into
poverty. 
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> The HHS study is flawed. It assumes that the conservative 
congressional reforms, just like the several previous  and  notoriously
unsuccessful  liberal attempts to &quot;end welfare as we know  it,&quot; will
fail and that welfare rolls will continue to increase at about  3 percent per
annum. But there are dramatic differences, both in  assumptions and in policies,
between liberal and conservative  welfare reforms. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In the past, liberals have attempted to make the welfare  system work. For
the future, conservatives want to make welfare  recipients work. Conservative
policies can assume a decrease in the  wel
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 50 -->  fare rolls precisely because they
introduce serious work  requirements into welfare reform. For example, in
dealing with  married AFDC families, states that have introduced serious work 
requirements for welfare recipients have registered significant drops  in the
welfare rolls ranging from 50 to 90 percent.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In speaking of the HHS study, American Enterprise Institute  Senior Fellow
Ben J. Wattenberg remarked that &quot;The assumptions  of these studies
strangely do not take into account the very purpose  of the bill  to encourage
young people to have children after  marriage, not before, thus sharply
improving children's economic  circumstances. Studies that assume welfare reform
will not work  are the work of those who believe that welfare reform will not 
work. Hence, the studies are useless and  misleading.&quot;<A

<P><B><A NAME="ISSUES">THE ISSUES 
</A></B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>On October 15, 1995, Senator Barbara Mikulski (D-MD),  was mugged outside
her home in Baltimore. Robert Eugene  Perlie, charged with the crime, was on
probation for possession of  cocaine and resisting arrest. He also had been
convicted in the past  for other drug offenses, as well as for theft and
insurance fraud.  Moreover, at the time of the inceident, Perlie was scheduled
for  four separate trials on charges of illegal transportion of a handgun, 
violation of probation, drug possession, and malicious destruction  and theft.<A
HREF="ftnt8.htm#1">1</A> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Mikulski mugging represents in microcosm both the  problem and the
politics of crime in America: A relatively small,  hard-core group of repeat
offenders commit most crimes, especially  violent crimes. Federal lawmakers talk
about &quot;getting tough on crime&quot;  and then pass laws that affect only
the tiny minority of  hard-core criminals that come under federal jurisdiction,
leaving the  vast majority unaffected. Press releases tout federal efforts, 
even though career criminals remain on the streets. The public  becomes more
cynical and more alarmed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Conservative candidates should explain the short-term solution  to America's
crime problem: putting repeat offenders behind  bars 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 2 -->  and keeping them there. This is
not the whole solution, but it is  the essential first step in ridding America
of the menace of  violent crime. And the evidence shows that it works. This
means,  however, that federal lawmakers must stop posturing for the  cameras and
recognize that, because most violent street crime is under  the jurisdiction of
state and local governments, most of the changes  in policy need to be made at
the state and local levels. The  President and Congress should review all
current federal laws,  determine which impinge upon or undermine the authority
of state and  local law enforcement, and repeal them.<A
HREF="ftnt8.htm#2">2</A>  The President and  Congress can and
should provide leadership and policy assistance, but  the real solution to the
problem of street crime lies at the state  and local levels.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In the long term, lawmakers at all levels must recognize that  the real
reason for America's decades-long crime wave is not  poverty, as some have
believed. Nor is it race, as others have intimated. It  is family breakdown.
Nothing could be clearer from the social  research than that fatherless children
 from whatever  socioeconomic or racial background  are the most likely to
commit  violent crimes as teenagers and adults. The rising rate of  illegitimacy
means that teenage crime also will continue to rise. This  point must be driven
home, repeatedly, and long-range economic  and social policies that encourage
the formation of stable,  two-parent families must be developed. At the same
time, Americans  must face the fact that some existing government policies 
encourage illegitimacy and family breakup. To curb crime, these  anti-family
policies must be ended.

</P>
<P>Public awareness and state and local efforts already are  affecting the
crime rate, which is dropping in many states and  localities. According to the
Federal Bureau of Investigation's 
<I>Uniform Crime Reporting</I> figures, there was a 1 percent decrease in  &quot;serious
crime,&quot; a measure of violent crime and property crime, reported  by law
enforcement agencies for the first six months of  1995.3  It is important to
realize that the recent decline is a reduction from  a huge statistical base,
and that much violent crime is not even  reported to law enforcement agencies.
That is why America's  crime rates are still unacceptably high. For example,
according to  the Federal Bureau of Investigation, a crime occurs every 2 
seconds:<A HREF="ftnt8.htm#4">4</A>

</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P>While crime rates have declined somewhat this past year, they  are 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 4 -->  still very high compared with
1960. In 1960, there were 160  violent crimes for every 100,000 Americans; by
1994, there were  715 for every 100,000 Americans, down slightly from 1993. 
Overall, there were 23,310 murders, 102,100 rapes, 618,820 robberies,  and
1,119,950 aggravated assaults in 1994. Since 1990, violent  and property crime
have declined by 2.2 percent and 8.5 percent  respectively, per 100,000
inhabitants. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>While still devastating in its impact on American society, the  recent
downturn is both welcome and, according to John  DiIulio, Professor of Politics
and Public Affairs at Princeton  University, &quot;can be explained in part by
policy-driven law enforcement  efforts that capitalize on community
crime-fighting initiatives and  take the bad guys off the streets.&quot;<A
HREF="ftnt8.htm#5">5</A> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Conservatives therefore should welcome the debate over  crime. Liberals, on
the other hand, continue to look to social programs  to reduce crime even though
these programs have proved  ineffective. The fact is that recent success in
reducing crime is largely  attributable to conservative policies which emphasize
tougher and  more effective law enforcement and incarceration of violent 
criminals. Crime is still a politically powerful issue throughout the  nation,
and in few areas are the political lines clearer. The  American people have had
enough; they are demanding tough,  sweeping changes that will slash the crime
rate. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The effectiveness of good police work and extended  incarceration of
hardened criminals is beyond dispute. Crime rates would  drop even more
dramatically if more state and local officials  initiated tougher and more
effective law enforcement on America's  streets, as Professor DiIulio suggests,
and made violent criminals  serve 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 5 -->  longer prison terms. Examples:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Jacksonville, Florida. State Attorney Harry L. Shorenstein  beefed up his
prosecutorial team in 1992, got tough with dangerous  juvenile offenders, and
started to prosecute them as adults and  send them to prison. The result: By
1994, Shorenstein's program  had sent hundreds of juveniles to jail. With fewer
young criminals  on the streets, arrests of juveniles declined 30 percent, and
the  number of juveniles arrested for weapons offenses fell by 41  percent.<A
HREF="ftnt8.htm#6">6</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Houston, Texas.</B> Police Chief Sam Nuchia started a &quot;citizens
 patrol program&quot; to beef up the city's increased police presence. The 
result: Thousands of citizen patrollers have reported criminal  activities to
the police, arrests have increased, and police response  to emergencies has
improved, increasing the productivity of the  police and the safety of Houston's
citizens.<A HREF="ftnt8.htm#7">7</A> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Oxnard, California.</B> By using sophisticated crime analysis and  an
advanced gang-tracking computer data base, and by using  a telemarketing
computer system to issue crime alerts to residents  in high-crime areas, police
have helped to reduce violent crime by  38 percent, including a 60 percent drop
in the murder rate.  Oxnard has reduced crime to its lowest level since the 
1960s.<A HREF="ftnt8.htm#8">8</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>New York City, New York.</B> Taking over the police department  in
January 1994, Commissioner William J. Bratton declared a  real war on crime,
promising in Churchillian fashion to &quot;fight for  every house in the city;
we will fight for every street; we will fight  for every block. And we will win.&quot;<A
HREF="ftnt7.htm#8">9</A>  Bratton took command of  the city's
demoralized 38,000-member police force, held the 76  precinct police commanders
directly accountable for their  perfor
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 6 -->  mance in decreasing the crime rate
in their precincts,  computerized the precinct data system to track the crime
problem daily, and  dismissed high-level police officials who failed to get in
tune with  his tough new program.<A HREF="ftnt8.htm#10">10</A>
 In 1994, while major felonies  nationwide fell by 2 percent, in New York City
they fell by 12 percent. In  the first nine months of 1995, they fell another 18
 percent.<A HREF="ftnt8.htm#11">11</A>  Over the past two
years, declines in most major felonies, including an  almost 40 percent drop in
murder, have been dramatic.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P>But first-rate police work should be combined with a serious  sentencing
policy for violent criminals. According to  Professor DiIulio, &quot;Not
surprisingly, therefore, studies show that from  1980 to 1992 the 10 states
where incarceration increased the most  saw violent crime decrease by 8 percent.
In the 10 states with the  lowest increases, violent crime soared 51  percent.&quot;<A
HREF="ftnt8.htm#12">12</A>  If more state and local officials
pursued such policies, more of America's streets  and homes would be much safer
places. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Conservative candidates should encourage such efforts at  every opportunity,
and not just because it will do well at the polls.  While recent reductions in
crime rates are encouraging, the  statistical base of violence upon which those
rates are calculated from  year to year is huge. The tidal wave of crime, which
began in the  1960s, continues to roll across America. During the 1960s alone, 
crime rates more than doubled (see Tables <a href="crime_t1.gif">1</a> and <a href="crime_t2.gif">2</a>).
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>America's violent crime rate soared 47 percent from 1975 to  1994, rising
from 487.8 to 716.0 per 100,000  inhabitants.<A
HREF="ftnt8.htm#13">13</A>(see <a href="crime_1.gif">Chart 1</a>)
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>According to the Council on Crime in America, a bipartisan  commission
chaired by former U.S. Attorney General Griffin Bell  and 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 7 -->  Heritage Foundation Distinguished
Fellow William J.  Bennett, over 400,000 Americans have been murdered since 1977
  almost seven times the number of Americans killed in the Vietnam  War.<A

<P>
</P>
<P>Most ominously, if the present disintegration of family and  social life
continues, Americans will see an unprecedented  acceleration of the already
horrendous levels of juvenile criminal  violence. Current data trends clearly
indicate that: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Violent crime among juveniles has soared by about 300  percent since 1965.
From 1981 to 1990, juvenile arrests for murder  increased by 60 percent, while
adult arrests increased by just  5.2 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 8 -->  percent. In 1990, juveniles
committed more than a third of all  murders in the country.<A
HREF="ftnt8.htm#16">16</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The sharp rise in juvenile crime presents a formidable  challenge for future
law enforcement. (see <a href="crime_2.gif">Chart 2</a>). There has been a  staggering increase in
juvenile arrest rates (see <a href="crime_t3.gif">Table 3</a>), as well as  in the number of arrests for
such heinous crimes as murder (see <a href="crime_t4.gif">Table 4</a>). From 1985 to 1993, the number of
juveniles aged 13 and  14 arrested for murder increased 162 percent. The murder
arrest  rate increased 207 percent for 15-year-olds, 197 percent for 
16-year-olds, 146 percent for 17-year-olds and 119 percent for  juveniles aged
18 to 20.<A HREF="ftnt8.htm#17">17</A>  The numbers of
juveniles involved in  aggravated assaults, rapes, and robberies also are rising
dramatically. If  trends continue, according to the Federal Bureau of
Investigation,  arrest rates for violent juvenile crime will double by the year

<P><B>Relationship Between Crime and Family Breakdown</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The insufficiency or absence of government social programs  does not fuel
violent crime. The social science literature is  conclusive on one all-important
point: The real root cause of violent crime  is the breakdown of family and
community, especially in  America's inner cities. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The professional literature shows that the failure of fathers  and mothers
to care for the children they bring into the world is at  the heart of violent
crime. Absent fathers, absent mothers,  parental fighting and domestic violence,
lack of parental supervision  and discipline of children, patterns of parental
abuse, neglect or  rejection of the child, and criminality among the parents
themselves   all are conditions that contribute to the creation of a violent 
crimi
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 9 -->  nal, and all are most present in
the social atmosphere created  by broken families and illegitimacy.<A
HREF="ftnt8.htm#18">18</A> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Race and Crime</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>While serious crime is highest in socially disorganized,  largely urban
neighborhoods, however, its frequency is not a function  of race. The
determining factor is the absence of marriage.  Among broken families, with
their chaotic, &quot;dysfunctional&quot;  relationships, whether white or black,
the crime rate is very high; among  married, two-parent families, whether white
or black, the crime rate  is very low. The capacity and determination to
maintain stable  married relationships, not race, is the pivotal  factor.<A
HREF="ftnt8.htm#19">19</A>  The chaotic, broken community
stems from these chaotic, broken families.  The reason race appears to be an
important factor in crime is the  prevalence of wide differences in marriage
rates among ethnic  groups. A report from the state of Wisconsin further
illustrates this.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Between 1980 and 1993, according to the latest available data,  the number
of black inmates rose from 46.5 percent to 50.8 percent  of the total prison
population, from 140,600 to 445,400. Justice  Department findings show that, at
the end of 1993, blacks were  seven times more likely than whites to have been
incarcerated in a  state or federal prison. An estimated 1,471 blacks per
100,000  black residents and 207 whites per 100,000 white residents were 
incarcerated in the nation's prisons on December 31,  1993.<A
HREF="ftnt8.htm#20">20</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The fact that crime rates are much higher for blacks than  whites has
tempted some to cite race as a factor in overall crime. It  is therefore
important for candidates to explain that the  evidence does not support this
view. When social scientists control for  fam
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 10 -->  ily structure, the rates for
blacks and whites are not  significantly different. Broken families are most
closely correlated with  violent crime, regardless of race. In other words,
family structure,  not race, is the leading indicator of criminal behavior.
There is  a higher rate of crime among blacks only because black  communities
have higher rates of illegitimacy and family breakup.

in 1988 was re-arrested on new felony charges while  out on bail pending trial.
Some 30 percent of felony defendants  with five or more prior convictions and

<P>During the 1960s, crime policies based on liberal theories of  social
injustice sent fewer criminals to prison for shorter terms. The  number of
offenders imprisoned for every 1,000 violent crime  arrests plummeted by almost
50 percent, from 299 in 1960 to 170  in 1970.<A
HREF="ftnt8.htm#31">31</A>  Tougher law-enforcement policies
began to return in  the 1970s, and the crime rate slowed as the rate of
incarceration  increased 38 percent. In the conservative 1980s, far tougher 
policies were adopted. 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 13 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, on December  31, 1994, the
number of sentenced prisoners per 100,000 U.S.  residents was 387  up from 139
in 1980. The rate of  incarceration more than doubled from 1980 to 1990,
increasing by 219  percent. In 1980, there were 329,821 federal and state
prisoners; by  1990, there were 773,919. By 1994, the total number of people 
incarcerated in federal and state penitentiaries since 1980 had  increased 219
percent to 1,053,738 (see <a href="crime_6.gif">Chart 6</a>).<A HREF="ftnt8.htm#32">32</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Conservative candidates should note the correlation: With  more violent

<P><B>The Failure and Abuse of Probation and Parole</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Liberals in Congress and elsewhere often bemoan the fact  that there are
more than 5 million persons in the United States  under &quot;correctional
supervision.&quot;  While it is true that the U.S.  prison population is at an
all-time high, however, most of those  incarcerated are violent criminals or
repeat offenders. Moreover,  while approximately 1 million persons are
imprisoned, an  overwhelming majority of convicts  another 3.5 million, or 72
percent  are  not in prison, but on probation or parole,<A
HREF="ftnt8.htm#33">33</A> and the disparity  between the
rate of imprisonment and the rate of release on probation  or parole has been
growing in recent years. Between 1980 and  1994, while the prison population
increased by 184 percent, the  parole and probation population increased by 204 
percent.<A HREF="ftnt8.htm#34">34</A> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>A large proportion of America's crime problem derives from  the fact that so
many criminals, including violent and repeat  offenders, 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 14 -->  are out on the streets. According
to Professor DiIulio, nearly  one-third of parolees imprisoned for violent
crimes, and nearly  one-fifth of those imprisoned for a crime against property,
are  re-arrested within three years of their release for committing a  violent
crime. Among convicted felons on probation alone, 54 percent  are arrested once,
24 percent are arrested twice, and 22 percent  are arrested three or more times.
<A HREF="ftnt8.htm#35">35</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Data from the bipartisan Council on Crime in America show  that &quot;On any
given day, seven offenders are on the street for  every three who are behind
bars. During 1994 about 4.2 million  cases were handled on probation and 1.1
million were processed on  parole. On any given day, there are about 1.5 times
more  convicted violent offenders out on the streets on probation or parole 
than behind bars.&quot;  <A HREF="ftnt8.htm#36">36</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Members of Congress and federal and state policymakers  should encourage
innovative leaders at the state and local levels,  like Governor George Allen of
Virginia, who are stopping the abuse  of probation and parole and eliminating
these options for violent  offenders. <A HREF="ftnt8.htm#37">37</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>One major flaw in current criminal justice policies is the degree  to which
convicted criminals are sentenced to probation with  no prison time at all, or
to jail terms of one year or less. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Bureau of Justice Statistics reports that, in 1990, state  courts (where
95 percent of crimes are prosecuted) sentenced 29  percent of all criminal
offenders to probation without incarceration.  Another 25 percent were sentenced
to jail terms of one year or  less. Thus, over half (54 percent) of criminals
convicted in state  courts 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 15 -->  received either no incarceration
or sentences of less than one  year in jail.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>For violent offenses, 20 percent of convicted criminals  received probation
with no incarceration, while 21 percent received  jail terms of less than one
year, leaving 41 percent of all  convicted violent offenders in these two
categories. Even for the crime  of murder, 5 percent of convicted criminals
somehow received  only probation, and 4 percent received one year or less in 
jail<A HREF="ftnt8.htm#38">.38</A> For the crime of rape, 14
percent received probation, and 19 percent  were imprisoned for one year or
less, leaving one-third of  convicted rapists with little or no serious
incarceration (see <a href="crime_t5.gif">Table 5</a>).
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>While on probation, hard-core repeat offenders continue to  commit crimes.
The Bureau of Justice Statistics estimates that 43  percent of those on
probation between 1986 and 1989 were arrested  at least once on felony charges
within three years of being placed  on probation. During that same period, 46
percent had been  committed to prison or jail or had disappeared, skipping out
on their  probation.<A HREF="ftnt8.htm#39">39</A>  Of those
receiving probation for murder, 5 percent  were re-arrested for murder, and 16
percent were re-arrested for  some felony within three years.<A
HREF="ftnt8.htm#40">40</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>According to another Bureau of Justice Statistics survey, 35  percent of
state prison inmates in 1991 were convicted of a new  offense committed while
they were on probation or parole.  Probation and parole violators comprised 30
percent of all offenders in  state prisons for a violent crime, 56 percent of
inmates incarcerated  for property offenses, 41 percent of those convicted of
drug  offenses, and 85 percent of those in prison for public-order offenses. 
Collectively, probation and parole violators committed 90,639  violent 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 16 -->  crimes while being supervised
within the community (based  on reported convictions).
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>More than 25 percent of probation and parole violators were  in prison for a
violent crime. Fifty-five percent of probationers  and parolees reported that,
in the month before their current  offense, they were using drugs. An estimated
41 percent were using  drugs daily. Of probation and parolee violators
imprisoned for a  new offense, 21 percent reported using a firearm while under 
supervision. Of those possessing a firearm in the month prior to  arrest, almost
75 percent were armed when they committed their  current offense. Between 1975
and 1991, the number of parolee and  release violators entering state prisons
increased from 18,000  to 142,000  twice the rate of growth among offenders
newly  committed from the courts.<A HREF="ftnt8.htm#41">41</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>How Light Prison Sentences and Parole Lead to Crime</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Another problem is that criminals generally serve only a  fraction of their
sentences, even as sentences themselves are often  too short. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Because of parole and early release programs, sentences  handed down by
state courts do not indicate time actually served. <a href="crime_t5.gif">Table  5</a> shows the estimated
average time that will be served under  sentences imposed in state courts in
1990, given past trends. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Data collected from the states by the Bureau of Justice  Statistics indicate
that for violent crimes, the average time served is  three years and seven
months (43 months) or 48 percent of the  original sentence (89 months). For
murder, the average is only five  years 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 17 -->  and 11 months (71 months) or 48
percent of the original  sentence (149 months); for robbery, three years and
eight months  (44 months) or 46 percent of the original sentence (95 months);
and  for rape, five years and five months (65 months) or 56 percent of  the
original sentence (117 months).<A HREF="ftnt8.htm#42">42</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>These short prison terms for violent repeat offenders do more  than trigger
a sense of injustice among victims. They also mean  more crime. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In 1985, the Bureau of Justice Statistics found that  approximately 28
percent of all male convicts, and 46 percent of recidivist  convicts, still
would have been in prison for their first crimes at  the time of their admission
to prison for a second crime if, instead  of being paroled, they had been given
sentences in the  maximum range for their original convictions. These
percentages would  be substantially higher for those who committed another crime
 within their original sentence than they would be for those  apprehended,
prosecuted, convicted, and imprisoned during that  time.<A
HREF="ftnt8.htm#43">43</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In another study released in 1987, the BJS estimated that 69  percent of
parolees 17 to 22 years old were re-arrested within  six years of their release
and that about 29 percent of new  arrest charges occurred before these parolees'
original sentences  would have ended.<A HREF="ftnt8.htm#44">44</A>

</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>According to the bipartisan Council on Crime in America,  &quot;In 1991, 45
percent of state prisoners were persons, who, at the  very time they committed
their latest crimes, were on probabtion  or parole. While free in the community,
they committed at  least 218,000 violent crimes, including 13,200 murders
and11,600  rapes 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 18 -->  (over half of the rapes against
children).&quot;<A HREF="ftnt7.htm#45">45</A>

<P>
</P>
<P><B>Federal Courts Still Gutting Truth in Sentencing Laws</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Recognizing the tendency of early-release prisoners to  commit crimes, more
and more states are adopting &quot;truth in  sentencing&quot; laws to keep
criminals incarcerated for as much of the full  sentence as possible. Under the
most common formulation, a  criminal convicted of a violent crime is required to
serve at least 85  percent of the full sentence. This is perhaps the most
effective  judicial remedy for violent crime devised so far, because it
eliminates  probation and parole for violent criminals. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Unfortunately, liberal jurists, apparently more concerned with  protecting
the rights of prisoners than with protecting the rights  of law-abiding citizens
victimized by violent crime, are trying to  gut these laws. This is particularly
true of federal judges who, to  relieve prison overcrowding, often order that
even violent  criminals be released back to the streets. Few states and
localities can  avoid this federal intervention: Some 39 states and 300 of the 
nation's largest jails operate under some form of federal court  direction.<A
HREF="ftnt8.htm#46">46</A>  The 1994 crime bill inadequately
addressed the issue, and  the problem remains. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Ostensibly to eliminate &quot;overcrowding,&quot; tens of thousands of 
prisoners have been released onto the streets. But &quot;overcrowding&quot;  has
never been defined, so each judge is free to determine it on a  subjective
basis. Far from the popular image of groups of  prisoners crammed into single
cells, it has come to mean, as arbitrarily  defined by several judges, simply
more than one prisoner to a  cell. Some federal judges even refuse to allow
convicted felons to  be 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 19 -->  sent to prison, citing &quot;overcrowding,&quot;
and just release them   even violent criminals and repeat offenders. These
released felons  have been responsible for tens of thousands of additional
violent  crimes. For example:

</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>As Heritage Foundation Distinguished Fellow William Bennett  has argued, in
the field of public policy there is no more  important personnel decision than
the hiring of a police  officer.<A HREF="ftnt8.htm#49">49</A>
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 20 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The dramatic performance of the New York City Police  Department in
combating violent crime and the innovative  community policing methods employed
in Houston, Texas, provide  ample models for effective police management.
Unfortunately,  however, a few men and women who should represent the best in
their  communities sometimes turn out to be the worst, as revealed in  press
accounts from around the nation detailing alleged police  brutality, corruption,
and incompetence. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>If the recruiting and staffing of state and local police forces is  done to
select the best in terms of professional competence,  personal courage, and
moral character, the value to society is beyond  calculation. When Americans are
threatened by violent criminals,  they want the very bravest and the very best
to rescue them and  their loved ones. They want police officers capable of
excellent  judgment, as well as physical courage, who can make  split-second,
life-and-death decisions without violating the parameters set  forth by the U.S.
Constitution. Moreover, they want police officers  and detectives who are
shrewd, intellectually capable of cracking  the most difficult cases, and able
to work with the prosecution team  to advance the best case against criminal
defendants in court. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The most egregious failures in police effectiveness invariably  have been
failures of personnel management: the deliberate  imposition of lower
intellectual and physical standards in recruitment  and hiring, reduced
background screening, the substitution of  &quot;politically correct&quot;
racial or ethnic or gender &quot;diversity&quot; for strict  standards of
competence or merit, poor supervision of officers in  the field, and a lack of
attention to moral character in the selection  of police. For example:

residents, generated a disproportionate amount of  police wrongdoing. A shocking
10 percent pleaded guilty to murder  and drug trafficking charges. Many of these
recruits were &quot;utterly  unsuited&quot; to police work, and poor training, &quot;inadequate
 supervision,&quot; and ineffective internal controls enabled them to  behave
with a &quot;contempt for the law.&quot;<A HREF="ftnt8.htm#50">50</A>

<P><B>*     Washington, D.C.</B> Standards for recruiting and hiring police in
 the nation's capital have been notoriously lax. In 1982, 40 percent  of
applicants failed the admissions test. Then the tests were  &quot;dumbed down,&quot;
as were the intellectual and physical standards for  graduation from the police
academy. In 1987 and 1988, the  graduation rate was close to 100 percent. Facing
a horrendous wave of  violent crime, the city in 1989 and 1990 resorted to rapid
hiring,  with weak or even non-existent background checks. The results  should
not have been surprising: In the first ten months of 1992, 32  police officers
were indicted on criminal charges which included  murder, theft, assault with a
deadly weapon, sodomy, and kidnapping,  and another 20 were under investigation
by the U.S. Attorney's  Office for similar crimes.<A

<P>Americans need, want, and expect the best in their police  officers. While
no state or local jurisdiction should impose racial or  gender quotas on the

found in every sector of the  community, among every race and ethnic group.
There is nothing worse than  a bad cop and nothing better than a good one. Good
police  officers are those with outstanding character, firmly anchored in the

<P><B>The Huge Cost of Crime</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Crime imposes high costs on individuals and families.  Victims suffer direct
economic damage in loss of funds and property.  They also experience pain,
suffering, cruelty, temporary or  permanent physical impairments and even loss
of life. Potential victims  suffer fear, inconvenience, and loss of freedom and
pay an economic  cost for extra locks, bars, guns, and other equipment in trying
to  avoid crime.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Crime also imposes huge costs on neighborhoods and  communities.
Neighborhood businesses lose sales when customers  fear crime while shopping.
Neighborhood workers lose jobs when  businesses and investors are scared away by
fear of crime.  Children lose the opportunity to learn when their schools are
dominated  by gangs and drug dealers who make it impossible to maintain  a
learning environment. Governments lose tax revenue when  sales, businesses,
jobs, and property values decline in crime-ridden areas.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Several studies have attempted to quantify these costs:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, crime victims  in 1992 lost
$17.6 billion in direct costs. These direct costs  include items such as losses
from cash, property theft or damage,  direct medical costs, or lost income from
loss of time at work. It does  not include indirect costs, including the costs
of long-term health  problems, higher insurance premiums resulting from changed 
health status, or the pain and suffering, the non-economic damage,  that
afflicts victims of violent crime, which would make the  economic costs of crime
signifcantly higher.

<P>One consequence of the disproportionate incidence of  crime against black
Americans is that black and other minority  neighborhoods face greater losses in
economic opportunity and growth  as small entrepreneurs are crippled and jobs
are destroyed. With  their schools so often undermined by crime, black and other
 minority children are often denied the basic educational opportunities  enjoyed
by white children in equivalent neighborhoods. Crime  and its associated costs
constitute a high extra tax on businesses  and households in low-income minority
communities. As discussed  in 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 28 -->  Chapter 6, poverty is not the
root cause of crime in these  neighborhoods; crime is a root cause of poverty.
Until crime is  drastically reduced in America's inner cities and low-income and
 minority communities, social programs or other efforts to revive their 
economic fortunes cannot succeed.

<P>
</P>
<P><B>THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>While state and local officials have primary responsibility  for combatting
crime, there has been a noticeable weakening of  federal enforcement in areas
directly under federal jurisdiction.  Federal narcotics prosecutions dropped 25
percent from  1993-1994, for example, and prosecutions for firearms violations
dropped  20.5 percent. Since the enactment of President Clinton's Violent  Crime
Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 (the 1994 crime  bill), the Clinton
Administration has initiated no significant  legislative efforts on the problem
of violent crime. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The $30 billion omnibus crime bill is itself a huge expansion  of federal
authority into functions traditionally performed by  state and local officials.
Key provisions include $8.8 billion worth  of funding for the hiring of police;
$9.7 billion for prisons and  other correctional initiatives; $6.9 billion for
crime &quot;prevention&quot;  activities, largely social programs; and $4.8
billion for several  other measures, including a 10-year ban on the sale,
manufacture,  and importation of 19 types of assault weapons, the creation of 
state registries for violent sex offenders, and the expansion of the  death
penalty to dozens of new federal crimes. Of course, 98 percent  of violent
crimes fall under state and local, not federal,  jurisdiction 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 29 -->  and are subject to state and
local, rather than federal, policy  initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Funding for Local Police. </B>The Clinton Administration is  promising
to put 100,000 police officers on the streets of America's  cities. The reality
is that the 1994 crime bill funds only $8.8  billion for police over six years,
far less than the full amount required  to put such a number on the streets on a
permanent basis. But  more important than the number of police is their
function, their  specific tasks, and where, precisely, they are assigned. To
fund police  to fight crime would seem to be simple: Send the money directly  to
state or local government according to a straightforward  formula that reflects
population, crime rates, or a combination of both.  That has not happened.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Based on the level of violent crime, it is clear from <a href="crime_7.gif">Chart  7</a> <A HREF="ftnt8.htm#66">66</A> that high-crime cities were
underfunded and low-crime cities  were overfunded. Worse, police funding has
become yet another  extension of the Clinton Administration's politically
correct  &quot;diversity&quot; agenda, a classic liberal program of social
engineering in  which local police departments are required to establish racial
or  gender-based quotas under the guise of crime-fighting in order to get 
federal funding. Under the Clinton Administration formula, local  police
departments must submit analyses of &quot;underutilization&quot;  of women and
minorities in accordance with &quot;community labor  statistics&quot; (broken
down by race, sex, gender, and job category);  outline &quot;affirmative action&quot;
plans that include &quot;goals&quot; and  specific steps to achieve &quot;goals&quot;
for correcting the &quot;underutilization&quot;  of women; and transmit
quarterly reports, plus a copy, to  official Washington on their progress in
implementing these federally  approved plans. So onerous is compliance (within
30 days) of  these

unrelated to reducing violent crime  that Oklahoma City Chief of Police Sam

turned down the program,  largely because they could not afford the 25 percent
financial match  requirement for participation in the program. Moreover,
according  to an analysis by the General Accounting Office, 7000 local 
jurisdictions did not even apply for the Clinton Administration's  grant money
overwhelmingly because of the cost of participation,  but cited other factors as

<P>In 1983, the Justice Department estimated that up to 55,000  serious

<P>Congressional action on habeas corpus is long overdue. Under  an 1867

the death penalty until every  conceivable legal loophole has been exhausted.
Petitions in many  state courts are similarly abused.

</P>
<P><B>WHAT TO DO IN 1997</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Congress should:
</P>
<P><B>-     Restrict the ability of the federal judiciary to impose prison 
caps.</B> Under Section 3626 of the 1994 federal crime bill, Congress  attempted
to bar federal judges from imposing prison caps   restrictions on the number of
prisoners that can be incarcerated at a  particular prison which result in many
violent criminals being  released long before their terms have been served. With
the  legal assistance of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU),  liberal
lawyers and federal judges quickly found ways to evade this  provision.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Therefore, the first major initiative of the new Congress should  be to
define clearly the scope of federal judicial authority over  state and local
prisons and &quot;abide by federal laws governing the  limited role of the
federal courts in conditions of  confinement.&quot;<A
HREF="ftnt8.htm#71">71</A>  New Members of Congress should
reassert their clear and  indisputable constitutional authority under Article
III, Section 2, and define  for the federal courts the &quot;exceptions&quot;
and &quot;regulations&quot; that  should 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 35 -->  apply to federal judicial action
over state prisons.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Reduce federal intrusion into state crime-fighting activities  and
help the states fight crime by letting them keep more of their  own money.</B>
Congress should affirm the division of authority  between the federal government
and the states in combating violent  crime. Federal officials have enough to do
in fighting the illegal  narcotics traffic and enforcing federal laws against
powerful  organized crime syndicates without trying to get involved in fighting 
street crime. Therefore, Congress should undertake a systematic  review of every
federal law dealing with violent crime, determine  which provisions interfere
with or undermine legitimate state and  local law enforcement authority, and
then repeal them. Congress  also should review Department of Justice advocacy
before the  Supreme Court to determine whether the department is adequately 
supporting state and local law enforcement officials in criminal cases,  and
should examine the impact of the Supreme Court's Miranda  rules governing
confessions to make sure that these restrictions do  not unreasonably limit the
ability of police officers to question  criminal suspects.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In the meantime, if Congress wants to assist state and local  law
enforcement authorities, it should rebate up to two percent of  the federal
personal income tax taken from the residents of any  state on the condition that
the state raise an equivalent amount to  combat violent crime within its
territory. Representative  James Sensenbrenner (R-WI) in 1994 offered a similar
proposal  under which these rebates would have amounted to $55 billion in 
constant dollars over a five-year period, a reliable stream of  funding for
anti-crime initiatives.

<P><B>-     Hold hearings on the real root causes of crime.</B> Given the 
disconnect between official Washington's thinking, embodied in the  social
spending in the Omnibus Crime Bill of 1994, and reality,  Congress should
conduct a series of hearings on the real root causes   the long term causes  of
crime, particularly on the importance  of family structure, including marriage
and religious practice, in  preventing violent crime. The professional
literature, the most  recent scholarship, and particularly the experience of
private  organizations involved in crime prevention, all are wide and deep on 
this point.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Conduct a serious review of all national social programs.</B> 
Congress should review all national social programs, particularly  those which
are supposed to help prevent or reduce crime, with the  director of each program
required to present both the evaluation  data on the program's effectiveness and
national trend data on the  problem.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Repeal federal restrictions on prison labor.</B> All federal
statutes  restricting prison work should be repealed. These include  the
Hawes-Cooper Act of 1929, which authorizes states to ban  commerce in
prison-made goods within their borders; the  Sumners-Ashurst Act of 1940, which
prohibits transportation of  prison-made goods within a state for private use;
and the  Walsh-Healey Act of 1936, which prohibits prison work on government 
contracts exceeding $10,000.<A HREF="ftnt8.htm#72">72</A>

</P>
<P>In 1995, Senator Richard C. Shelby (R-AL) introduced a bill  (S. 930) to
accelerate the reform of prison operations. The bill  requires inmates in
federal prisons, and in the prisons of states  receiving federal money under the
1994 crime bill to help them  build 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 37 -->  new facilities, to work 48 hours
and study 16 hours per week.  The legislation also repeals the social work
requirements of the  1994 bill; significantly reduces prisoners' &quot;free time&quot;
to enjoy a host  of amenities; and requires that the food prisoners receive is
not  superior in quality or quantity to the food made available to  enlisted
personnel in the United States Army.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Debate on the relative effectiveness of rehabilitation and  punishment has
swung back and forth in the penology literature for  over a century. The appeal
of the Shelby proposal is that it  combines rehabilitation, education, work, and
punishment in one  package. Nor is it really all that stringent; all it requires
is that a  prisoner's life be similar to that of a hardworking young taxpayer
who  holds a job and goes to college at night.

<P>Amid the social collapse of so many urban neighborhoods,  there are stunning
examples of successful efforts to turn around the  lives of young people
previously immersed in crime. These efforts  invariably possess two features: a
strong system of rules within  an organization that is characterized by the love
and firm  guidance most often seen in a supportive family and a strong spiritual
 dimension, most commonly a profound religious commitment  to living a good
life. Examples abound.

<P>One thing is common to all these efforts: giving people a place  to belong.

<P><B>-     Heed the recommendations of law enforcement organizations  on the
fitness of judicial nominees.</B> The American Bar  Association has become
highly politicized in recent years. Its leaders have  resorted to inflammatory
political rhetoric in attacking the  leadership of Congress, and its liberal
ideological bias has long since  compromised its integrity as an independent
reviewer of the  professional qualifications and fitness of candidates for
judicial office.  The President should dispense with the ABA's advice and seek
an  alternative source for measuring the professional fitness of  judicial
candidates. At the very least, he should give equal consideration  to the views
of constitutional experts selected by law  enforcement associations,
particularly with regard to the sensitivity of  judicial nominees to public
safety.

</P>
<P><B>-     Order the Justice Department to issue an annual  state-by-state
report card on key indices of crime prevention and reduction.</B>  The key to
reducing crime is for state and local officials to  identify repeat offenders
and keep them in prison for long terms so  they cannot continue to prey upon the
public. In 1992, former  Attorney General William Barr produced a thorough
report detailing  the changes that need to be made to accomplish this  goal.<A
HREF="ftnt8.htm#73">73</A>
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 40 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Most of these changes need to be made at the state level, where  98 percent
of all crimes are prosecuted. The Attorney General  could issue an annual report
card based on reductions in violent  crime and the adoption of specific
crime-fighting remedies. Rankings  on crime reduction could be based on current
FBI and Bureau of  Justice Statistics data. Rankings on crime-fighting could be
based  on a state's adoption of specific remedies. Therefore, the  states
should:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Sharply restrict pre-trial release for dangerous defendants.</B> 
States should enact legislation and, if necessary, amend their  constitutions to
allow for detention without bail pending trial for  defendants who pose a proven
threat to victims, witnesses, or the  community at large. Legislation to grant
judges this power in  federal courts was adopted in 1984. Under this law, a
judge who finds  that release will endanger the safety of any other person or
the  community, and that no combination of conditions on a release can 
reasonably assure such safety, may deny bail and order the  defendant detained
until trial. Any defendant convicted within the past  five years of a violent
crime committed on pre-trial release is  automatically presumed to be a danger
to the community. An  additional sentence of two to 10 years also applies to any
felony  committed while on pre-trial release.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>This law has worked well at the federal level and provides a  model that
should be adopted by every state to prevent repeat  offenders from committing
crimes pending trial, which remains a  significant problem.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Sharply limit probation.</B> Probation should be prohibited for 
the 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 41 -->  following serious offenses:
murder, rape, armed robbery,  felonies involving the intentional or knowing
infliction of serious  physical injury, or a second conviction for any felony.
Probation  leaves these classes of criminals free to threaten law-abiding 
citizens. Limiting it is a commonsense way to keep serious repeat  offenders off
the streets.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Adopt strict state sentencing guidelines.</B> A comprehensive  and
complex set of guidelines developed by the U.S. Sentencing  Commission has been
adopted to govern sentencing for federal  crimes. These guidelines specify a
narrow range of sentences for  each crime which vary according to the
seriousness of the crime,  the prior record of the defendant, whether a weapon
was used,  how much bodily injury or financial loss was caused, and other 
factors. Federal judges must impose sentences within this narrow  range, except
in cases where the judge believes special  circumstances warrant a departure.
The prosecution or defense may appeal a  sentence departing from the guidelines,
and such departure will not  be upheld without a strong and valid justification.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>If states adopted such sentencing guidelines, liberal or  lenient judges
would be hard pressed to evade them. This is one of  the most important reforms
state officials could adopt to get  repeat offenders off the streets.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Abolish parole for violent offenders.</B> Under federal 
sentencing guidelines, parole has been all but abolished. Early release is 
allowed only for &quot;good time credits,&quot; which may reduce the  imposed
sentence by no more than 15 percent. If states adopted  this standard, it could
be a powerful weapon in the fight to keep  violent repeat offenders in prison.
Virginia Governor George Allen  made 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 42 -->  this reform a central theme in
his criminal justice reform program. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Acquire adequate prison space.</B> No reform aimed at 
incarcerating repeat and violent criminals can succeed without sufficient 
prison space. In most jurisdictions, including the federal system,  this means
constructing or otherwise acquiring additional capacity.  As former Attorney
General Barr has said, &quot;The choice is clear:  More prison space or more
crime.&quot;<A HREF="ftnt8.htm#74">74</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Lawmakers can justify this expenditure by noting that the cost  of acquiring
additional prison space is offset not only by the  far larger savings to society
from reducing crime, but also by the  incalculable benefits derived from
protecting the lives and  property of American citizens. Costs also can be
reduced significantly  by contracting out the construction and operation of
prisons to  private firms which have a proved they can build and operate 
additional prison space at substantially less cost than government 
bureaucracies. With private owners and operators, government also need  not
provide full financing of construction costs up front  a  severe constraint in
most states. Financing could be obtained by  the owner in private capital
markets and recouped over time  through fees paid by the government for use of a
facility. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Private firms have proved they can construct and bring into  operation new
facilities much more quickly than the  government, thereby reducing capital
costs. Competitive market incentives  produce more cost-effective construction,
management, and  operation design on the part of private firms. Private
construction of  prisons is much more common than private operation, but there
still  are dozens of successful prisons operated privately with higher  quality
and at much lower cost.<A HREF="ftnt8.htm#75">75</A>
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 43 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Require prisoners to work.</B> State legislation should be enacted
 to require inmates to work full-time while in prison. Any net  earnings should
go first to the victim as restitution, after which at least  half should go to
the prison to finance incarceration costs. In  addition to generating funds for
these purposes, required work would  teach discipline, mold positive social
attitudes, and develop work  skills that enable the prisoner to obtain gainful
employment after  release. A 1991 federal study found that convicts who worked
in  prison were less likely to commit crimes after release and much  more likely
to be gainfully employed.<A HREF="ftnt8.htm#76">76</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Requiring prisoners to work also can reduce operating costs  by using at
least part of the resulting products and services to  offset prison budgets (see
below). Texas A&amp;M economics  professor Morgan Reynolds points out that in
the past, many prisons  were self-financing thanks to required work by  inmates.<A
HREF="ftnt8.htm#77">77</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Require prisoners to study.</B> Training, education, and 
counseling sessions should be offered to prisoners in the evenings and  on
weekends  the same time non-criminal working adults  outside prison must attend
classes. Requiring such extra effort to  obtain the benefits of higher
achievement would teach better social  attitudes and build self-respect.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     End furloughs and other temporary release programs.</B>Violent  or
repeat offenders should not be released from prison on  unsupervised furloughs,
work/education release, or other temporary  or conditional release programs.
Nearly 60 percent of prisoner  escapes in 1990 occurred during furlough or
work/education  releases,<A HREF="ftnt8.htm#78">78</A> and
many crimes are committed by prisoners during  such 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 44 -->  furloughs or releases.<A
HREF="ftnt8.htm#79">79</A>  Violent or repeat offenders also
should  not be released pending appeal of a conviction, as this merely  allows
them the further opportunity to flee and commit additional crimes.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Impose the death penalty for heinous crimes.</B> The death 
penalty should be imposed for several particularly serious offenses:  murder of
law enforcement officers, murder committed during  commission of a serious
felony, murder committed in prison, or  other murders in which the jury finds
aggravating factors that  outweigh any mitigating factors and result in a crime
sufficiently heinous  to justify death as the penalty. In fact, the death
penalty is used  sparingly in the United States. According to the Bureau of
Justice  Statistics, of the 4984 prisoners sentenced to death during the  period
1973 to 1993, 226, or 4.5 percent, were  executed.<A
HREF="ftnt8.htm#80">80</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The death penalty deters potential murderers, permanently  prevents repeat
offenders, and exacts appropriate justice for the  most heinous crimes.<A
HREF="ftnt8.htm#81">81</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Guarantee victims' rights.</B> State legislation should be enacted
 to establish clearly the following rights of victims: the right to  be present
and to be heard at all critical stages of judicial  proceedings parallel to the
rights of defendants, including bail and other  hearings, plea negotiations,
sentencing, and any other public  proceedings; the right to present a &quot;victim's
impact statement&quot; at the  time of sentencing, with surviving family members
exercising the  deceased victim's rights; the right to full restitution out of
any  assets or earnings of the defendant, including the full rights of 
collection as enjoyed by any other creditor, with exemption from discharge  if
the criminal files for bankruptcy; the right to be fully informed  of all
proceedings against the defendant, as well as the  defendant's 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 45 -->  incarceration; and the right to
mandate HIV testing of  defendants in sexual offense cases before trial, and
periodic tests to catch  a latent HIV infection. In addition, every prosecutor's
office  should have a victim-witness coordinator to inform victims of their 
rights and help them exercise those rights.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Each state also should establish in its criminal statutes a clear  right of
self-defense that allows the victim of a crime to use  deadly force to protect
himself from bodily harm and to protect his  home or business. The same right of
self-defense &quot;without  retreat&quot; should apply elsewhere when the victim
is not at fault in  causing an altercation. Innocent victims should not be
subject to legal  second-guessing of the snap  and usually frightened  
judgments they make under extreme distress in exercising their right to 
self-defense, though use of excessive force must remain illegal.  The law also
should exempt from civil liability any action  committed in self-defense that is
not a violation of criminal law, as well  as any other injury suffered by a
criminal while committing  a crime.<A HREF="ftnt8.htm#82">82</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Reform the juvenile justice system.</B> While overall crime rates 
have declined, the major criminal threat to civil society is the rapid  increase
in juvenile crime. Yet juvenile criminals generally are  exempt from the
criminal justice system until they reach age 18;  instead, they are often
covered by juvenile delinquency systems  that impose little if any real
punishment, typically granting  probation for crime after crime or holding
offenders for relatively short  periods in ineffective juvenile detention
centers. Gaining control of  the crime problem therefore requires thorough
reform of the  juvenile justice system.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 46 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>First,</B> states should enact legislation that allows adult charges 
for juveniles 14 or older who commit murder, rape, kidnapping,  armed robbery,
or assault with a firearm, or who intentionally inflict  serious physical
injury. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Second,</B> all offenders who remain in juvenile delinquency  systems
should be required to pay restitution to their victims. For  every serious
offense, the juvenile also should be sentenced to  extended, mandatory
participation in a highly structured community  service or public works program
after school and on weekends. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Third,</B> an extended sentence to an institutional boot camp  should be
required for repeat offenders, juvenile offenders who fail  to comply with
sentenced participation in community service or  public works programs, and
juveniles under the age of 14 who  commit violent crimes. Such boot camps should
be operated with  military-style regimentation and discipline, providing
education and  requiring work on a highly structured schedule. Young offenders 
generally come from single-parent families, with many of their  neighbors and
even parents involved in drugs, alcohol abuse,  prostitution, or other crimes.
Their moral development can be  achieved only by removing them from this
environment and keeping  them in one that requires moral responsibility for
several years.  Sentences to such boot camps until adulthood at 18 should be 
common for those whose crimes qualify them for such sentences. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Fourth,</B> records of juvenile convictions for crimes of  violence
should be carefully maintained and made available at  sentencing for any future
crimes of violence committed in juvenile years  or adulthood. Studies show that
juvenile crime records are one of  the strongest predictors of repeat adult
crime. Considering these  ear
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 47 -->  lier convictions will lead to
stronger sentences for repeat  offenders at an earlier age, thereby further
reducing  crime.<A HREF="ftnt8.htm#83">83</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Clean up the police departments and make greater use of  community
policing.</B> Most police officers are solid members of their  communities, but
the failure of the criminal justice system to  incarcerate repeat and violent
offenders demoralizes even the best of  them. Beyond this political failure, too
many cities have made  matters worse by deliberately lowering service standards
and  imposing racial and gender quotas on a job that should be filled only on 
the basis of individual merit. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The absence of effective screening for criminal misconduct,  poor starting
salaries, poor supervision by commanders in the  field, atrocious personnel
management, failure to recruit personnel  of outstanding character as well as
ability  all these factors  have combined to encourage patterns of brutality,
corruption, and  demoralization in too many police departments in American 
cities. Charges and revelations of corruption, brutality, and  tampering with
evidence in Philadelphia, New Orleans, and Los  Angeles have undermined public
confidence in the police. There is no  substitute for character and moral
integrity in a police officer: A  bad person cannot be a good cop. From the
standpoint of  personnel management, recruiting, and hiring, the acquisition of
good  police officers should be the first order of business. And while  officers
should be recruited from every sector of the community, only  the best should be
hired  and only on merit. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>State and local officials also should return to an older tradition  of
policing. The police in most communities operate by patrolling  in 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 48 -->  police cars, waiting for calls
for help and then responding  as quickly as possible. An alternative strategy
now developing  is known as community policing. Under this approach, officers 
are assigned to small neighborhoods and are responsible for  getting out of
their cars and spending most of their time walking the  beat. By visiting local
businesses, talking to residents, attending  community meetings, and learning
first-hand what is going on  and what the citizens are concerned about, they
gain a far more  detailed understanding of the people and their neighborhoods. 
Police-citizen community activities include organizing citizen  crime-watch
patrols, canvassing local businesses and private  security guards to glean
information, and instructing all citizens on  what they must look for to assist
the police and avoid becoming  victims of crime.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The community policing strategy has proven quite successful  in deterring
crime, apprehending criminals, and removing fear  from communities.84  State and
local governments should use this  approach more widely, substantially
increasing police personnel  and assigning them to high-crime areas where they
can provide  a strong police presence on the streets.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><A NAME="Q&A">Q&amp;A</A></B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Why are conservatives more interested in sending more  young men to
prison than in keeping them out?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> The first task of government is to protect its citizens.  That
means putting more violent criminals in prison and keeping  them there.
Rehabilitation programs have not delivered on their  promise to reduce violent
crime, and citizens should not be asked to  put 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 49 -->  their hopes in rehabilitation for
these kinds of criminals.  Innocent citizens are not protected by such hopes.
This is not to say  that long-term prevention strategies should be abandoned. To
the  contrary, conservatives affirm prevention strategies, including  many now
operating in the private sector, that work and are  solidly grounded in the
institutions that can best prevent crime: the  family, the church, and the
school. In the meantime, a sound  conservative social policy would aim to
strengthen these institutions. This is  the best way to keep young men out of
prison. <A HREF="ftnt8.htm#85">85</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Isn't crime going down?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Yes; overall, violent crime is going down slightly. That is  the
good news. Nevertheless, it is still 350 percent higher than just  30 years ago.
Further bad news is that teenage violent crime is  going up and shows every sign
of continuing to rise for the next 16  years at least unless there is a major
cultural change in the United  States. This is so because the rise in violent
crime is directly related to  the breakdown in family and community, and
Americans have yet  to see an increasing number of out-of-wedlock children grow 
up without parental supervision, love, or discipline. If  Americans somehow
could turn the deteriorating family structure  around, strengthening the
nation's families and recording no more  out-of-wedlock births from today
onwards, we still would have to  wait for this psychologically damaged and
potentially violent group  of young offenders to work their way through the
system. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. What is wrong with imposing uniform federal sentences?   Shouldn't a
crime receive the same penalty in any part of the US.?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> We have state and local judges and juries to evaluate the  cir
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 50 -->  cumstances and the level of guilt
in each case. Judges ought  to have descretion to impose different sentences;
but, at the  same time, criminals should be required to serve at least 85
percent  of these sentences. Truth in sentencing is just that: If you do  the
crime, you do the time. Everybody is clear: the judge, the  jailer, the
criminal, and  last but not least  the citizen. But that is  a policy decision
best left to the states. Local communities can  best assess the effectiveness of
their local judges.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Why do conservatives in Congress oppose federal assistance  to police
in the President's crime bill?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Conservatives in Congress don't oppose federal assistance  to
local law enforcement. Under the proposal enacted by the  House of
Representatives, Congress can continue to do the very best  that the Clinton
Administration program can do, but can do it  even better. With the
congressional block grant approach, passed by  the House of Representatives and
threatened with a veto by  President Clinton, local police can get even more
money, may be able to  hire even more personnel, and they will have even more
flexibility  to use these funds in a fashion that best suits local needs.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Moreover, the Clinton Administration funding for police is at  the
discretion of the President. There is solid evidence that  Administration
funding does not go to localities hit hardest by  violent crime. For example,
Portland, Oregon, which accounts for 56  percent of all violent crime committed
in the state of Oregon, got  less than one percent of the funding awarded to 
Oregon.<A HREF="ftnt8.htm#86">86</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Isn't America's prison population exploding because law  enforcement
is cracking down on minor drug offenses?  
</B><!-- Generation of PM publication page 51 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> No. As the bipartisan Council on Crime in America  reports, since
1974, over 90 percent of all inmates in state prisons  have been either violent
offenders or repeat felons. Between 1980  and 1993, the number of persons
imprisoned for violent crimes  grew by 221,000, or 1.3 times the growth of those
imprisoned as  &quot;drug offenders.&quot;  Furthermore, 80 percent of federal
and state drug  offenders are drug traffickers with a history of repeat
offenses.

<P><B><A NAME="ISSUES">THE ISSUES
</A></B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>American education continues to be in crisis. Government  spending on
education has skyrocketed even as school performance  and student achievement
have remained static, leaving young  Americans ill-equipped to function in
today's increasingly  competitive world.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The liberal solution, as always, is more money, more  bureaucracy, more
regulation, more federal intrusion. Candidates need to  emphasize that America's
education crisis cannot be solved by  central government decree. Schools will
not be improved by letting  Washington run them. The crisis can be solved only
by taking  power away from centralized bureaucracies and empowering  parents,
teachers, principals, and local school boards to take charge  and make things
better for their own communities. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The most important education goal of the 1990s is to put  parents and
teachers in charge of education  at the local level. In  the nation's large
cities in particular, public schools have  become faceless monopolies,
insensitive or indifferent to parental  and teacher concerns about quality,
standards, and discipline.  Public schools must be made fully accountable to the
parents and  children they are meant to serve. That means parents  especially 
low-in
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 2 -->  come parents  must be given the
power to transfer their  children to, and the public funds to educate their
children, in other public  or private schools.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>High academic standards lie at the heart of effective  education. But
standards must reflect America's tradition of local  control: They should be
locally adopted and adapted to local needs  and capacities. While education is a
national issue, it is a local  responsibility. Federal &quot;remedies&quot; are
barriers to needed innovation  and reform, not the solution. Indeed, the
original genius of the  federal system was that the states were &quot;laboratories
of democracy.&quot;   Each state, and each local school district, can learn from
the others.  The federal push to establish fashionable outcomes-based 
education, and the reaction it has precipitated, should remind us that the 
federal role should be minimal and non-interventionist.  Decisions need to be
made in local schools and the communities they serve.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Moreover, since the time of the ancient Greeks, schools have had  a central
mission which embodies but goes beyond academics:  character formation. Students
should become better people by virtue  of attending school; habits of hard work,
honesty, self-respect,  and respect for others are essential to democratic
capitalism,  and schools should support their development as ardently as they 
support mastery of mathematics and English. The public school  in America once
proudly carried out that function  now  many schools undermine it. There is, as
well, a pressing practical  issue: Schools must be safe and secure learning
environments for  students, teachers, and other members of the education 
community. The lesson should be clear: Learning is important, self-discipline 
is important, and standards of behavior will be enforced, just as  academic
standards will.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 3 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Adopting institutional reforms centered around school choice  for parents,
autonomy for teachers and principals, and genuine  teacher professionalism can
change the system's fundamental  incentives. Today's government- and
union-controlled monopoly can be  replaced with a diverse and flexible system
controlled by  parents. The result will be freedom of choice for parents,
teachers, and  students, greatly improved school performance and student 
achievement, and a vastly improved working environment for teachers  and
principals.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><A NAME="FACTS">THE FACTS</A></B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>America's public schools once provided citizens with a  common culture and a
sound basic education. In recent decades,  however, the public school system has
failed utterly to provide  Americans with these essentials.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>SAT scores have dropped nearly 60 points in the past three  decades  even
though the test has been &quot;dumbed down.&quot;  The  same answers in 1992 as
in 1960 score between 18 and 30 points  higher than three decades ago. Thus, the
real loss is somewhere  between 98 and 110 points.<A
HREF="ftnt9.htm#1">1</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In a classic example of denial, the Educational Testing Service  has
responded to this crisis by &quot;re-centering&quot; SAT scoring for  1995 and
beyond. To disguise the poor performances of American  students, all SAT scores
are now reported on a higher scale. The  test also has been renamed. No longer
the Scholastic Aptitude Test,  it is now the Scholastic Assessment Test: same
acronym, less utility.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 4 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>But trying to make the picture look better by altering SAT  scores fools
nobody. The school system is failing. In 1969, Congress  created the National
Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP)  to survey student achievement
nationwide on a regular basis.  Over the years, these assessments have found
that:

<P>
</P>
<P>The latest results show that there has been little if any  improvement. The
1994 NAEP history assessment showed that more  than half of American high school
seniors lack a basic knowledge  of 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 5 -->  U.S. history. The test, composed
of multiple choice and  essay questions, was given in early 1994 to a national
sample of  22,500 fourth, eighth, and 12th graders in both public and private 
schools. The results:

<P>
</P>
<P>The information gets worse. A 1995 NAEP study revealed that  the best
writing students produce as part of their classroom work is  not very good.
Writing samples collected from a nationally  representative sample of more than
3,000 4th and 8th graders showed that:

<BLOCKQUOTE><P>-     Only 1 percent of 4th graders and 12 percent of 8th

<P><B>States vary widely.</B> In its <I>Report Card on American  Education

50 states and the District of Columbia, the  American Legislative Exchange
Council (ALEC) found that:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>*</B>     Nationwide, student performance did not improve 
significantly from 1992-1993 to 1993-1994. SAT scores remained  unchanged, 35

1.3 percent from 1980.  ACT<A HREF="ftnt9.htm#8">8</A> and

Utah, Wisconsin, and  Wyoming (see Table 5).

<P>
</P>
<P><B>Spending at Record Levels</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>While education performance has been mediocre at best,  education spending
is now at an all-time high. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>For the 1994-1995 school year, total education spending in  the United
States was estimated to be $508.3 billion, up 178  percent from the 1980-1981
school year (see <a href="educ_t1.gif">Table 1</a>).This amounted  to about 7.5 percent of GDP for
1994-1995, almost double the  spending on national defense.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 7 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Total spending on public elementary and secondary schools for  the 1994-1995
school year was $283.9 billion, an increase of 173  percent from 1980-1981 in
nominal terms. From 1972 to 1992,  public school spending rose 490 percent in
nominal terms (see <a href="educ_t2.gif">Table 2</a>).
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Overall, the federal government spent $35.2 billion in  constant 1994
dollars on education in 1994-1995, up from $29.7 billion  in 1980 (see <a href="educ_t3.gif">Table 3</a>).
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Spending per pupil in the public schools has soared: $6,857  in 1994-1995,
up 150 percent from 1980-1981 in nominal terms  and 44 percent in 1994 dollars.
Since 1970, per-pupil spending  has risen 554 percent in nominal terms and 73
percent in  constant 1994 dollars (see Table TK).
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>ALEC's report card clearly supports conservative arguments  that student
performance measures, compared with per-pupil  expenditures, average teacher
salaries, and other education spending  variables, indicate no direct or
systematic relationship between  spending and student performance. 
</P>
<P>None of the ten top-performing states in terms of student  achievement
ranked among the top ten in per-pupil education spending  in 1993-1994; most
spent less than the national average per pupil.  In addition, none of these
states ranked among the top ten in  average teacher salaries last year (eight
actually paid less than the  national average); nine held per-pupil spending
increases below the  national average during the last 11 years; and seven did so
during  the preceding 21 years as well.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>As <a href="educ_t5.gif">Table 5</a> shows, Iowa scored first in SAT scores and tied  for 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 8 -->  first on the NAEP test, yet its
spending per pupil was below  the national average; Utah spent the least per
pupil, yet scored  second on the SAT and eighth on the NAEP test; and North 
Dakota ranked 36th in spending but tied for first on the NAEP test  and scored
fourth on the SAT. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>By contrast, New Jersey spent the highest amount per pupil  and scored 37th
on the SAT and 14th on the 1992 NAEP test; the  District of Columbia ranked
second in spending per pupil and  scored 49th on the SAT and 42nd out of 42
states on the NAEP test;  and ninth-ranked Rhode Island scored 43rd on the SAT
and 23rd  on the NAEP test.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>*</B>     According to ALEC, report card, New Jersey spent
more per  student ($9,429) than any other state in the nation during the 
1993-1994 school year. New Jersey also held the same per-pupil  spending rank in
1992-1993 and still increased per-pupil spending  significantly more than the
national average. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     Teacher salaries also increased nationwide last year, rising a
 modest 0.1 percent after inflation. Connecticut paid the highest  average
teacher salaries last year ($49,500); South Dakota, the  lowest ($25,199).
</P>
<P>

 increased substantially. Using Census Bureau population  projections, and

<P><B>*</B>     Total education spending will rise more than 47 percent 
(almost $125 billion in constant 1994 dollars), and per-pupil spending  will
increase almost 32 percent to $7,942. As a result, the  per-capita 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 9 -->  education tax burden will rise by
one-third, and the typical  family of four will face an average annual education
tax increase  of $1,340.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P>That there is no correlation between spending and performance  has been
demonstrated by a wide variety of studies, perhaps most  notably in the
exhaustive study of the performance of  America's schools for their landmark
1990 book, 
<I>Politics, Markets and America's Schools,</I> conducted by Brookings
Institution  Senior Fellows John Chubb and Terry Moe. The evidence showed 
clearly that increased spending and resources do not translate into  better
school or student performance. The relationship between  resources and
performance has been studied extensively by social  scientists, who agree that
financial resources are of less consequence  that other variables. Most
important is &quot;school climate,&quot; the extent  to which a school offers a
safe and disciplined learning  environment with staff and students motivated by
a shared commitment to  academic excellence. The performance problems of the
public  schools cannot be corrected solely by digging deeper into the  public
purse.<A HREF="ftnt9.htm#9">9</A>  Many studies make this
point.

statistically significant relationship between student  achievement and any of
the school characteristics that are often  thought important: teacher-pupil
ratios, teacher education,  teacher salaries, and per pupil expenditures. This
should come as  no great surprise. Over the last two decades, as school 
performance has deteriorated and stagnated, per-pupil spending  in schools has
increased nearly 100 percent after inflation,  class sizes have shrunk more than
20 percent, and most  teachers have acquired master's degrees.<A

<P>International Comparisons
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>On the home front, there is some modest good news. Black  test scores have
made small gains, and women's have as well.  More students are taking more
demanding courses. The number of  them taking advanced placement courses and
tests continues to rise,  as does the number of higher scores. But these are
just a few  bright spots in a gloomy picture. The bottom line for conservative 
candidates is that all American children could be doing  significantly better,
as indeed all must if we are to have confidence in the  future. Academic
performance in America is not world-class,  and offers no promise of becoming
world-class by the year 2000  except in a few isolated schools and districts.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The reasons for this huge discrepancy between America's  schools and our
international competitors are not hard to fathom.  American public schools are
not designed to succeed. Pony Express  institu
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 11 -->  tions in the electronic age, they
are hopelessly out of date.  The issue is not money (see <a href="educ_2.gif"
>chart</a>), but standards,
organization,  and accountability. Too little is expected of American students;
as  a consequence, they give too little. There are few rewards for  success and
fewer penalties for failure. A system designed and  run without incentives and
rewards ineluctably panders to the  lowest common denominator, as American
education has done.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Where Teachers Send Their Children to School</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Public school teachers are sending their own children to  private schools
rather than allow them to become lost in a public  school system in disarray.
This was reported in a May 1995 study by The Heritage Foundation's Denis Doyle,
prepared under the  auspices of the Indiana-based Hudson Institute and published
and  distributed by the Washington-based Center for Education  Reform.<A
HREF="ftnt9.htm#13">13</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>This study, drawn from the 5 percent household sample of  the 1990 Census,
shows that, taken together, public and private  school teachers nationwide are
only slightly more likely than the  general public to choose private schools
(17.1 percent to 13.1 percent).  In America's most troubled cities, however, the
results are quite  different:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In troubled cities, public school teachers are two to three  times more
likely than the general public to use private schools. For  example, in
Washington, D.C., 25.7 percent of public school  teachers who make less than
$35,000 send their children to private  school. This is more than double the
national average; among  public school teachers nationwide, 11.9 percent enroll
some or all of  their children in private school. The trend continues in cities
like  Boston 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 12 -->  (24.4 percent), New York (21.4
percent), Miami (35.4  percent), and Los Angeles (18.9 percent). 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In other words, &quot;in our nation's cities, where the schools are 
arguably the worst, a large number of teachers abandon the  institutions in
which they work and enroll their offspring in private schools.&quot;   This
includes teachers of all races.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Black public school teachers use private schools more than  white public
school teachers (12.9 percent to 11.9 percent), and  Hispanic public school
teachers use private schools more than  non-Hispanic public school teachers
(16.5 percent to 11.9 percent).  Meanwhile, white parents are somewhat more
likely than nonwhite parents  to send their children to a private school. In the
United States as  a whole, 13.1 percent of all parents, 14.2 percent of white 
parents, 8.1 percent of black parents, and 10.8 percent of parents of  other
races send their children to private schools. Some 13.4 percent  of Hispanic
parents send their children to private school, compared  to 10.1 percent of all
non-Hispanic parents.
</P>
<P>

<P>Overall, then, black public school teachers are almost as likely  as the
public at large to use private schools (12.9 percent to 13.1  percent). This
means that &quot;black teachers who can afford a  choice exercise it: they are
50 percent more likely than black parents  in general to enroll their children
in private school. This might  explain the high support for publicly funded
school choice  programs among minorities  they are often in the worst school
districts  and are more inclined to put their children in private schools when 
they can afford it.&quot;  Across the United States, &quot;teachers  public  and
private, white and black, Hispanic and non-Hispanic, low  income, middle income,
and high income  know how to address  the 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 13 -->  nation's education crisis: they
vote with their feet and their  pocket books. They choose private schools for
their children when  they think it serves their interests best.&quot;

<P><B>How Teacher Unions Obstruct Reform </B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The American Federation of Teachers (AFT) and the larger  National Education
Association (NEA) have become the  bane<U> </U>of school reformers. They are
big and well funded, and they have  a major presence in Washington and most
state capitals.  Teachers are, in fact, the most heavily unionized segment of
the  American work force, and the NEA is particularly opposed to serious 
education reform. But teachers are not necessarily synonymous  with their
unions. They vote for Republicans as well as Democrats  and are concerned with
many of the same issues that concern  reformers. The tide could begin to turn. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>One sign that teachers recognize the need for reform, as  noted above and in
the following table, is the extent to which they  enroll their own children in
private schools.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Another encouraging sign is the willingness of AFT  President Albert Shanker
to champion high academic standards and  school discipline.<A
HREF="ftnt9.htm#14">14</A>  At the same time, however,
Shanker's opposition  to innovations such as school choice remains implacable.
The  education establishment fears that public schools as we know them  will
disappear, but this is all the more reason to adopt a more  innovative approach
to public education. This fear of change is  narrow and self-serving. Preferring
the known to the unknown, the  education establishment reveals its limited
vision and how little it  actually cares about the welfare of children.

<P><B>The Federal Takeover</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The attempted federal takeover of American education,  launched with fanfare
and good will during the Great Society 30 years  ago, has been revealed for what
it is: a prolonged and serious  mistake. It is now abundantly clear that
Washington both  over-promised and overreached. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Programs intended to improve the education of the poor and  dispossessed
have borne bitter fruit, emerging by and large as  self-serving employment
programs for educators. Student test  scores have remained largely static, and
the promise of public  education as a way out of the mire of social pathology
has not  materialized. Instead, inner-city public schools themselves have become
 trapped in the pathology of the inner city. Almost without exception,  the only
schools which have escaped, and whose students have  done well, are private
denominational schools.
</P>

languages  so  crucial to a future of sophisticated technology and international
 competition. America's children are not learning enough, they  are not learning

<P>Too many of America's public school teachers must perform  under combat

often receive little  support from local boards of education or school
administrators.  Yet, despite the barrage of disrespectful behavior on the part

<P>If local and state officials really wish to improve the education  of our

</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Why Vouchers Are Needed</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The main difficulty in addressing the sorry state of  America's schools lies
in the fact that those in charge have a vested interest  in resisting change.
The efforts of those most concerned about  falling test scores  usually parents,
but many teachers as well   usually meet with a discouraging combination of
bureaucratic lethargy  and outright resistance. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>For this reason, the first order of business for reformers must be  to 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 19 -->  wrest enough control from the
bureaucracy to effect  serious change. Several promising policy solutions have
been put  forward to accomplish this. One of the best is the concept of school 
choice, which would end the &quot;one size fits all&quot; approach to the public
 education system by opening up options for students to attend  higher-quality
private schools. The best way to make private  schools more accessible to the
parents of children currently enrolled  in public schools is also the simplest:
through government vouchers.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>School choice vouchers are transfer payments from the  government to
families of school-age children which permit these  children to attend the
school of their choice, whether public or  private, secular or religious. The
practice is widely followed in the  developed democracies and is spreading
rapidly in the former Iron  Curtain countries. America is, in fact, the only
developed nation  that denies its children this form of assistance to help them
attend  non-public and denominational schools. It may well be that the  last
truly deprived minority in the United States is made up of  poor children whose
families prefer a religious education but  cannot afford to pay for it out of
pocket.<A HREF="ftnt9.htm#28">28</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Numerous opinion polls show broad public support for  school choice,
especially among inner-city minorities and the poor,  who suffer the worst
schools under the current system with no  feasible alternatives. School choice
offers conservative candidates a  powerful opportunity to attract strong support
from this traditionally  liberal constituency.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The opposition, by contrast, comes from the education and  union
bureaucracies  the only people who gain from the current  monopoly. School
choice is a threat to them because it would  give 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 20 -->  parents and teachers the power
and control enjoyed for decades  by a professional managerial elite increasingly
out of touch with  the communities they are supposed to be serving.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>The Role of Charter Schools</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Two other promising innovations are the charter school and a  related idea,
private contracting for school services. Charter  schools are public
institutions in terms of mission and funding, but are  run autonomously by the
signatories of a charter. They can be run  by an association of parents,
teachers, business leaders, or any  combination of these. While the charter
school movement is both  new and small, varying significantly from state to
state, the idea  is promising. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The basic concept of charter schools is simple: &quot;Allow a group  of
teachers or other would be educators to apply for permission  to open a school.
Give them dollar for dollar what a public  school gets for each student but
without any strings attached. Free  them from the regulations that cripple
learning and stifle innovation  at so many public schools.&quot;<A
HREF="ftnt9.htm#29">29</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In the four years since the first charter schools opened their  doors in
Minnesota, 18 other states have passed charter laws in  various forms, and 234
of these schools are up and running around  the country.<A

<P><B>Private school eligibility:</B> Yes, if  the school is nonsectarian, but

<P><B>Hiring:</B> Schools are not required to hire  certified teachers.

</P>
<P><B>MINNESOTA:</B> The state that pioneered the charter concept  revised its
law to strengthen it in 1993 and 1995. </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Cap:</B> Increased  to 40 schools in 1995 after being set
originally at eight and later at  12 schools. </P>
<P><B>Schools open:</B> 17. </P>
<P><B>Approval:</B> Only licensed teachers  can operate a school. Charters
must first be approved by a local  school board, community college, state
university, or technical  college, with the state board of education granting
final approval. Such  an approval process is more limiting than Arizona's, but
in 1993,  lawmakers amended the original law so that charter applicants 
rejected by the local school board can appeal to the state board  if two members
of the local board voted to approve the  charter.</P>
<P><B>State/local control:</B> Schools are exempt from state laws and local 
district policies except those regarding health, safety, civil rights, and 
children with disabilities or special needs. They also have  complete control of
the money they receive from the state.</P>

<P><B>Private school eligibility:</B> No.</P>

</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P>The most thoroughly developed example is Yvonne Chan's  Next Century
Learning Center in Los Angeles, and the most  promising state legislation for
Charter Schools is Arizona's which is  wide-ranging and flexible. In most
jurisdictions, however,  charter schools are poorly developed and kept on a
short leash. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The education establishment  notably the National  Education Association and
various school board associations at the state  and national levels  give lip
service to charter schools but offer  no real support. The reason: Charter
schools are a very real threat  to the status quo. Once in place, they could
revolutionize  American education. They combine the best aspects of a
functioning  public school system  public support, public access and
accountability   with much of the flexibility of private schools. They are an 
important and useful first step to freeing teachers and parents.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Contract Management.</B> Still in its infancy as a way of  operating
schools or school districts, contract management of various  aspects 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 23 -->  of education is a
long-established practice. School cafeterias,  busing, business services,
textbook acquisition, purchase of  supplies and materials, janitorial services,
and the like have been  turned over to private contractors and run efficiently
in many districts  for many years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>What remains is to begin trying the concept in curriculum  areas such as
reading, math, and foreign languages, as well as in  running whole schools or
school districts. There is no conceptual barrier  to contract management; it is
used in almost all other areas of  government services, from national park
concessions to military  training.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The idea behind contract management is simple: Pay an  independent
contractor to perform an assigned task and devise  measures that will determine
whether that task has been performed  successfully. Interestingly, one of the
most difficult tasks school  districts face in contract management is &quot;specifying&quot;
the terms of the  contract; since many schools do not have a clear sense of 
mission, they find it very difficult to specify what they want to  accomplish in
the language of a contract. The exercise, however, is useful,  and education
establishment opposition to such a straightforward  idea is both
anti-intellectual and inflammatory. The issue is subject  to analysis and
validation, and should be welcomed as another way  to improve education
performance.

also can play a critical role in  helping schools set priorities, identify
measurement tools,  improve communication with and between schools and the
larger  community, and help develop performance measures that will  rationalize
pay for teachers and administrators. Perhaps most important of  all, business
leaders can help school boards behave in a more  businesslike fashion. In
particular, business can help school boards  end &quot;micro-management&quot;
and support candidates for school  boards who are both responsible and
effective.

<P><B>State Reforms in 1995</B>

<P>The 1995 legislative session once again brought school choice  to the
forefront of the education debate at the state level. State  legislatures
debated numerous voucher and charter school bills over  the 1995 session, and
several states have passed or improved  their charter school laws. In two
states, Ohio and Wisconsin,  first-in-the-nation school choice programs were put
into  place.<A HREF="ftnt9.htm#33">33</A>  Several other
states debated the issues and some proposals cleared the  relevant committees.

<P><B>Charter Schools.</B> Both chambers of the Florida legislature  passed

Connecticut  is considering many education reforms, including both a  voucher
proposal and charter schools.

</P>
<P><B>Voucher Update.</B> According to Marquette University's Blum  Center for
Parental Freedom in Education, choice and voucher  initiatives were pursued in
the following states during 1995.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>*    Ohio.</B> Governor George Voinovich in June signed
into law a  two-year budget package creating a $5.25 million pilot voucher 
program in Cleveland, to become effective in September 1996.  With his
signature, Governor Voinovich enabled Ohio to become  the first state in the
nation to complete the enactment of school  choice that includes religious
schools. The proposal included in the  budget package was approved by the
House-Senate Conference  Committee on June 23, 1995, and will allow parents of
2,000  Cleveland students to redeem vouchers at private or religious schools. 
With this new legislation, Cleveland becomes only the second city in  the
country (the first being Milwaukee) to allow private school choice.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Wisconsin.</B> In June, Wisconsin's legislature passed genuine 
school choice legislation, which, along with the rest of Governor  Tommy
Thompson's budget proposal, was signed into law on July  25, 1995. The
legislation called for the expansion of the  Milwaukee Parental Choice Program
to include religiously based  schools (MPCP currently allows students to attend
non-sectarian  private schools in Milwaukee).
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Governor Thompson's earliest version of the choice proposal  had set the
voucher amount at $3,300 per pupil and raised the  number of eligible students
to 3,500 in the fall of 1996 and 5,500 in  the next year, after which the
enrollment limitation would have  been eliminated. Before the package was
approved by the Joint  Finance 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 28 -->  Committee, Representative Annette
&quot;Polly&quot; Williams, the  original sponsor of MPCP, called for a larger
expansion proposal  which increased enrollment to 7,000 in the fall of 1996,
after which  it would be limited to 15,000. This expanded proposal was  approved
by the Senate on June 29 after having been approved by the  State Assembly on
June 21.

include religious schools. This action  left more than 2,300 children stranded
after having already signed  up for classes in the religious schools of their
parents'choice. In  an astonishing display of community support, private funds
have  been raised to offset the loss of public funding. Oral arguments  have
been set for February 27, 1996, and a final decision is not  expected from the
Wisconsin Supreme Court until spring. According to  the Landmark Legal
Foundation of Kansas City, Missouri, &quot;the  Milwaukee school-choice
litigation will ultimately result in a  major U.S. Supreme Court decision
allowing school-choice  programs that include religious programs.&quot;

the proposal would likely  offer vouchers worth approximately $500 to $3,000, to
be given on  a sliding scale according to income. A family of four  earning

</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION</B>
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 30 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>President Clinton promised to do something to help improve  the education of
America's children. While his rhetoric has been  appealing, however, he has
failed to keep his promise. Instead  of &quot;revolutionizing, revitalizing and
reforming&quot; America's  schools, he actually has slowed the process of
change. While creating  new government bureaucracies, increasing federal
regulations,  and boosting the rate of spending at the federal level, the 
Administration also has resisted real efforts to reform America's  education
system. The President has chosen to ignore academic &quot;outputs&quot;   real
results  and has focused instead on spending more  taxpayer dollars on &quot;inputs.&quot;
 The Administration also has seriously  undermined the relationship of students
and their families to the  education process.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>The Federal Takeover of School Districts (Goals 2000).</B> The  Goals
2000 legislation, enacted in 1994 as President Clinton's most  important
education program, has been a failure. Instead of  &quot;revolutionizing,
revitalizing and reforming&quot; America's schools as  President Clinton
promised, Goals 2000 has proved a barrier  to change.<A
HREF="ftnt9.htm#34">34</A>  It has created new government
bureaucracy and  boosted federal spending. Worse still, it threatens to
undermine progress  to improve American education performance by encouraging 
schools to ignore real results and focus instead on obtaining federal  dollars
by showing Washington that more money is being spent on  &quot;inputs.&quot; 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Continued taxpayer funding for Goals 2000 will only  strengthen the federal
government's power to control local reform efforts  and hamper grassroots
reform. It is time for Congress to terminate  the program and divert the money
to real reform.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 31 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Goals 2000 has failed America's schools in two important ways:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Building Bureaucracies.</B> Under Goals 2000, three new  government
bureaucracies would have been created: the National  Education Goals Panel, the
National Education Standards and  Improvement Council (NESIC), and the National
Skills Board. While  NESIC will not be empaneled, the philosophy behind these 
bureaucracies continues the command-and-control approach that keeps control  of
schools in the hands of education bureaucrats rather than  parents, teachers,
and students.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Federalizing Education.</B> While Goals 2000 pays lip service to  local
control, it came dangerously close to mandating a  watered-down national
curriculum designed in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The federal government's preliminary foray into identifying  national
history standards  a well-meaning attempt by  then-National Endowment for the
Humanities Chairman Lynne Cheney  to make educators teach real history again 
backfired last year  when the committee assigned to formulate them unveiled
standards  that were rife with political correctness. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The incident reveals one of the inherent dangers in the Goals  2000
approach. Had its members been appointed, NESIC would  have become a de facto
national school board whose 19 members  could have imposed a standard curriculum
of politically correct  revisionism on the entire nation. This central authority
would have  approved or disapproved all state-developed plans to meet goals  set
by the Education Goals Panel, another bureaucracy created  under Goals 2000.
Such attempts to federalize state and local  education discourage real
innovation and inhibit the most important  school 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 32 -->  reform initiative of the decade,
the movement toward  privatization and school choice.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The states, meanwhile, on their own initiative already have  begun to reject
federal interference in schooling. In particular,  outcomes based education, a
favorite idea of the education  establishment, has offended and alienated
thoughtful teachers and parents  across the country and has mobilized opposition
to the federal role.  Four states  Montana, New Hampshire, Virginia, and Alabama
  have turned down or returned Goals 2000 funding, refusing to  permit more
federal intrusion.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Another Middle-Class Subsidy:</B> AmeriCorps. Hailed by the 
Administration as an innovative effort to expand education  opportunity through
volunteerism, AmeriCorps, President Clinton's  national service program, has
evolved into a big-government  pork barrel. Although supporters maintain
AmeriCorps  &quot;encourages Americans to do volunteer work, helps people go to
college  and disperses decision-making power from Washington to  the states,&quot;<A
HREF="ftnt9.htm#35">35</A> the rhetoric contrasts sharply
with reality. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The AmeriCorps program does little to help American  families pay for
college, destroys the spirit of volunteerism, removes  participants from local
communities where they are needed most  and uses them to enlarge the federal
bureaucracy, and  improperly funds partisan political activities. Most
important,  AmeriCorps costs the taxpayers too much.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>An August 1995 General Accounting Office report found  that AmeriCorps costs
$26,654 per participant to run, or more than  40 percent more than the
Administration's most recent  estimates. 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 33 -->  Some 93 percent of the funding
for the program comes out of  taxpayers' pockets.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In 1993-1994, AmeriCorps employed about 20,000  &quot;volunteers&quot;
described as &quot;working all over America, helping people   person to person.&quot;<A
HREF="ftnt9.htm#36">36</A>  In reality, a significant number
of these highly  paid &quot;volunteers&quot; are working in federal or state
bureaucracies,  government-funded programs, or political action organizations.
Of  the 20,000 &quot;volunteers&quot; currently participating in the program, 
2,053 are working in federal bureaucracies on programs funded by  the federal
government. <a href="educ_t8.gif">Table 8</a> presents a breakdown of  AmeriCorps participation within the
federal government.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Student Loans.</B> While the Clinton Administration has portrayed  its
direct lending program for college students as essential to the  education
future of young Americans, the evidence suggests  otherwise. The program appears
to be bad for taxpayers, bad for  students, and bad for schools. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The vast bulk of capital for student loans today is provided  through
private institutions. But under the direct lending plan, the  federal government
borrows the money needed to provide capital for  the loans. This would require
the federal government to borrow  an additional $20 billion-$25 billion each
year. According to  Representative Ernest Istook (R-OK), a complete shift to
direct  loans could add as much as $348 billion to the national debt by the 
year 2014. The U.S. Department of Education is expanding to  handle the new
program, hiring 600 new employees to administer it  and anticipating need for
another 20,000 contract employees by  the time the program is fully operational.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 34 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>There are other worries about the direct lending program.  Currently, some
75 percent of all available college financial aid  comes from the federal
government. If the government takes  complete control of the loan program,
colleges and universities in effect  will become dependent on a single lender to
support their students.  The Education Department's power to control loan
revenue, along  with its expanded regulatory authority and enforcement power, 
will give the government vast influence over post-secondary  education. Such
financial power could enable the federal government to  influence or force
curriculum changes, or to mandate such things  as politically correct &quot;diversity
standards.&quot;
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>There is little support for a government takeover of the  guaranteed lending
program. The solution is not to nationalize  the multibillion-dollar student
loan program. That would mean  new costs and bureaucracy. Moreover, Americans
believe strongly  that student loans should continue to be provided through
private  financial institutions, not the federal government.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>THE 104TH CONGRESS</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The actions taken so far by the 104th Congress have  produced mixed results.
For the first time in 40 years, there was hope  for serious change in America's
education system. The Contract  With America, however, included little
discussion of education  reform or of countering President Clinton's hindering
of legislative  actions. After the first legislative year of the Republican 
majority, despite attempts to introduce far reaching reforms, liberal 
strangleholds and repeated filibusters have caused the 104th Congress  to fall
far short of implementing any serious reform. At the  same 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 35 -->  time, however, conservative
actions within Congress have  helped make education one of the key issues in
1996.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Reforming schools in the Nation's  Capital.</B> At the request of House
Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-GA), the Task Force on  D.C. Schools and Representative
Steve Gunderson (R-WI) developed  a plan that would have laid the foundation for
serious reform in  the District of Columbia public school system. Fundamental to
 these reforms was a scholarship proposal that would have put the  federal
government on record as supporting the concept of choice.  The proposal was
added as an amendment to the D.C. FY 1996  appropriations bill in the House.
Unfortunately, due to intense  objections by Democrats and liberal Republicans
in the  House-Senate Conference Committee, the entire set of education reforms 
remains in limbo as both sides refuse to budge.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Gunderson amendment authorized the establishment of  independent public
charter schools which would have used  existing D.C. public and private schools
as well as new schools  created with the help of the universities within the
District. It also  would have authorized many federal institutions within D.C., 
including the National Science Foundation, NASA, the Library of  Congress, and
the Smithsonian Institution, to help establish public  charter schools.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Gunderson legislation would have given scholarships of up  to $3,000 for
students whose family incomes were at or below  the poverty level and up to
$1,500 for students whose family  incomes were not more than 185 percent above
the poverty level.  These scholarships would have allowed low-income D.C.
families to  escape the failing D.C. public schools by giving them the 
resources 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 36 -->  needed to send their children to
any private, independent,  religious or non-religious school located in the
District of Columbia or  the surrounding counties of Northern Virginia and
Maryland.  They would have covered the cost of fees and other expenses for 
tutoring and instructional services after school hours and the costs  of
transportation for a student enrolled in a District of Columbia  public school,
public charter school, or private school participating  in the tuition
scholarship program. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Also included in the legislation was language to expand local  literacy
programs for the District from two programs to 20 in  the third year of the
initiative. These programs are instrumental  in helping to build reading skills
for children and their parents.  The legislation also would have helped
establish a panel to develop  a high expectations, academically challenging
curriculum and  assessment system for the D.C. school system.
</P>
<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Title I.</B> For more than 30 years, since 1965, Washington
has  spent over $90.5 billion on the Title I program, which still cannot  show
any long-term academic gains for children, even after being  &quot;reformed&quot;
five times. The House offered to cut funding for this  remedial education
program by $1.1 billion, from its current level  of $6.6 billion to $5.554
billion. The President is seeking $7  billion. Funding for the program is tied
to the Departments of  Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education
appropriations  bill, which passed the House but had not been brought to the
floor  of the Senate for a vote by the end of the 1995 session because  of
opposition by Senate Democrats.

<P><B>Head Start.</B> While it is clear from several studies that any  success
for disadvantaged preschoolers gained through the early stages  of 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 37 -->  Head Start is eroded by the time
the children reach the  primary grades, over the past 30 years Washington has
spent over  $31.2 billion on the program. Unfortunately, Congress has decided 
to continue its funding. The House passed a $3.39 billion grant  for preschool
health and education for FY 1996, which returns  Head Start funding to slightly
more than was allocated in 1994.  Again, the Senate has yet to take up the
appropriations for the  program. President Clinton is seeking an increase in
program funding  in order to extend services to 50,000 or more children by the 
year 2002.

program's funds are spread too thin, with some districts  getting only a few
hundred dollars. This program has shown no  effectiveness in reducing drug usage
in high schools, and there have  been no specific performance-based evaluations
of it since its  inception. Furthermore, a program evaluation report has shown
that  training sessions are &quot;more likely to focus on providing information

school autonomy must go hand in hand with parental choice.  This will give
schools the ability to change. School autonomy  means that the principal,

parents as representatives, would  be free to run their school as they choose:
to select their own  curriculum, textbooks, staff, and teachers (which means
that teacher  certification requirements must be relaxed or abolished 
outright). Regulation of private schools also must be relaxed to the  absolute
minimum. In this way, parental choice can create an effective  market that
controls and regulates schools in accordance with the  preferences of parents
rather than according to the whims of a  bureaucratic elite.

</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P>Created by Congress at the request of President Jimmy Carter  in 1979, not
yet two decades old, the U.S. Department of  Education is doing precisely what
its severest critics envisioned:  usurping local and state control by slowly and
steadily introducing  federal controls. Although it accounts for about six
percent of total  public funding of education, its influence is out of all
proportion to  its financial role. Indeed, the Department of Education inserts 
itself into almost all aspects of the day-to-day workings of the  nation's
15,025 school districts. Bureaucratic, heavy-handed and  intrusive, it is a
metaphor for many of Washington's most wasteful  and meddlesome domestic
programs.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Yet the most alarming aspect of the growing federal control  of education is
not administrative interference, but its adverse  impact on academic
performance, equally the product of sins of  omission and commission. The
increasing power of special interests,  the burgeoning size of school districts,
the refusal of the  public schools to submit to any market discipline, weakening
 community bonds, a pervasive anti-intellectualism in schools of  education,
general permissiveness, family dissolution  all have played  a role. At no time
in American history has academic  performance been more important. Yet as the
federal role increases,  education performance declines. The new federal role in
education  obviously was not intended to impair academic performance, but, 
steadily and almost without interruption, student academic  performance
nevertheless has fallen, and the Department of Education has  done nothing to
stop the downward spiral. While cause and effect  may be elusive, and the
department's supporters assert a variety  of causes to explain the decline in
student performance,  these changes occurred during, and as a part of, the
federal  ascendancy in American education.

implement a comprehensive set of reforms for the D.C.  public schools, in effect
resurrecting the amendment offered by  Representative Gunderson during the 1995
session. The reform act should:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Authorize the establishment of independent public charter 
schools,</B> using existing D.C. public and private schools as well as  new
schools created with the help of universities in the District. It  also should
authorize many federal institutions within D.C.,  including the National Science
Foundation and Smithsonian Institution,  to help establish public charter
schools.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Establish charter schools which would help restructure the  existing
public school system,</B> allowing innovative school principals  and teachers to
work with parents and academic institutions to  overhaul the system.
Lower-income parents would have the right  to choose an effective private school
if they are not satisfied  with their child's public school. This would hold the
public schools  to account.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Provide scholarships of up to $3,000 for students</B> whose  family
income is at or below the poverty level and up to $1,500 for  students whose
family income is not more than 185 percent above  the poverty level. These
scholarships would allow low-income  D.C. families to send their children to any
private, independent,  religious or non-religious school located in the District
of  Columbia and the surrounding counties of Northern Virginia and  Maryland.
They would cover the cost of fees and other expenses for  tutoring and
instructional services after school hours and the costs of  trans
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 45 -->  portation for a student enrolled
in a District of Columbia  public school, public charter school, or private
school participating in  the tuition scholarship program. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Establish a special panel to develop tests to monitor the  progress</B>
of the District's schools so that parents have real information  with which to
evaluate D.C.'s schools. This &quot;World Class  Schools Panel&quot; would be
responsible for developing a core curriculum  for kindergarten through 12th
grade. In addition, it would  encourage more private-sector involvement in the
District's schools.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>It is essential that this education proposal not tell D.C.  residents what
schools they must have. Rather, it must create the  conditions and incentives
for change. It would still be up to parents,  teachers, principals, and District
institutions to take advantage of this  opportunity.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>For Congress to bring about real reform for America's schools,  it must
first set a precedent by reforming the schools in its  backyard. Congress could
achieve this by attaching these reforms as  an amendment to the District's 1997
appropriations bill. This  would force the President and liberal Democrats in
Congress to hold  up the District's funding as the price for continuing to
oppose  real reform for the children who most need it.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Enact a Low-Income School Choice Demonstration.
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Representatives Frank Riggs (R-CA) and Dave Weldon (R-FL)  co-sponsored
voucher legislation in 1995 (H.R. 1640) similar to  a bipartisan bill (S. 618)
introduced by Senators Dan Coates  (R-IN) and Joseph Lieberman (R-CT). This
legislation, not yet  enacted, 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 46 -->  would allow any K-12 child
eligible to participate in the free  or reduced-price National School Lunch
Program to receive  vouchers to attend the public or private school of the
family's choice.  The bill would authorize grants for 10 to 20 low-income 
communities to establish voucher-based school choice programs at a cost of  $30
million over three years.

<P><B><A NAME="Q&A">Q &amp; A</A></B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Doesn't education choice mean the brightest and most  affluent
students will escape, leaving the poorest and most difficult to  educate trapped
in bad public schools?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> The exodus of the brightest and richest students happens  under
the current system because only they have the ability to  choose. Comprehensive
school choice gives poor inner-city children  the same freedom to choose their
schools that wealthier children  already enjoy.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>School choice improves all schools and benefits all children,  not just
those who change schools. The reason?  Competition forces  all schools to strive
to perform better in order to survive. This  has been the experience in East
Harlem, for instance, where  school choice proved especially beneficial to poor
minority  inner-city students.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Don't we need the public schools to teach all students a  common set
of basic values, beliefs, and democratic principles?   Doesn't choice leads to
diverse, fragmented philosophies  and views?
</B><!-- Generation of PM publication page 47 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> The public schools are not teaching a common set of  values,
beliefs, and principles. Many are teaching moral relativism  and
multiculturalism. Under comprehensive school choice,  schools must reflect the
values, beliefs, and principles common to  parents in order to attract students
and funds. The parents of each  child, not government bureaucrats and
politicians, should have the  final say over what that child is taught.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Won't school choice encourage extremists or fanatics to set  up
bizarre &quot;cult&quot; schools and possibly even lead to such abuses as  the
indoctrination of students in Satan worship or racial supremacy?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Under a program of school choice, schools would have to  meet
minimum certification requirements, just as private schools  do today. Such
requirements effectively preclude extremist or  cult schools.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. With vouchers, wouldn't private schools receive  government money,
and so private schools would face heavy regulatory  control?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> No private school is required to participate in any school 
choice program. Private schools which receive no state funds today  would be
free to forego state funds under choice programs, leaving  them no worse off
than they are now. One of the fundamental  principles of comprehensive school
choice is autonomy, with each  school free to operate as it chooses. Choice
means reducing the  regulation of public schools to the minimum level now
applied to  private schools, not increasing regulation of private schools.

</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Americans are keenly aware of what is right with America's  health care
system. They are overwhelmingly impressed with the  quality of medical services
they get from doctors and hospitals and  other health care providers; they
appreciate the fruits of modern  medical science and technology that are
available to them; they are  often satisfied with their own insurance plans, and
with the level of  benefits and services available to them through these plans.
At  the same time, however, Americans are concerned about the  current and
future costs of health care, the gaps in insurance coverage  that still
characterize the system, and the fact that too many  Americans are uninsured.
Moreover, they want the frustrating paperwork  and administrative costs of the
system reduced, both in the public  and private sectors, and the laws governing
medical malpractice  improved. And while they want to see certain aspects of the
 health care system reformed, Americans want reform that preserves  personal
choice and the quality of medical services. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>During the past year, Congress has made the country aware of  the growing
financial pressures and instability of the  government's two huge health care
programs, Medicare and Medicaid. Failure  to modernize these programs means
having to drain an ever  larger portion of funds from existing government
programs,  contributing 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 2 -->  to higher deficits and taxes, and
compromising the level and  quality of care available for the next generation of
beneficiaries. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> Given the magnitude of these issues and concerns, the health  care debate
during the next election should revolve around three  central goals:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>1)  The crises in Medicare and Medicaid must be resolved.</B>  Medicare
is facing bankruptcy. Absent structural reform, the program  is projected to be
insolvent by 2002. This financial crisis is  hitting Medicare just before the 77
million baby boomers, the  largest bulge in America's population pipeline, begin
to retire in  2010. The program needs to be reformed so that it can pay benefits
to  the next generation of retirees.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Congress enacted sweeping Medicare reform in 1995 as part of  its Balanced
Budget Act. But President Clinton blocked this  reform by vetoing the
legislation and argues  wrongly  that no  tough decisions are needed to preserve
the program.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Likewise, Medicaid, which serves the poor and the indigent and  is financed
jointly by the federal and state governments, is  experiencing explosive rates
of growth. Since 1990, Medicaid has been  the fastest growing segment of the
federal budget, with costs  increasing at annual rates as high as 31 percent. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Medicaid is out of control because the federal government  curbs state
initiative through expensive mandates, preventing the  states from integrating
health care into other services. Medicaid must  be moved to the states.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 3 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>2)  Americans must be freed from the fear that they will  become
uninsured.</B> The main political pressure for changing the health  care system
comes not from those who are uninsured, but from  those who fear they will lose
their health benefits in the future.  Candidates need to recognize that most
insured working  Americans know someone who has lost his or her insurance and
has  faced financial hardship or disaster as a result. They do not want to  join
them. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Candidates need to explain that this anxiety flows directly  from today's
employer-based health system. Americans can get tax  relief for health insurance
only on one condition: that they get  it through their employer. It is not
surprising, then, that this tax  bias in favor of health insurance through the
place of work has  created an employer-based health insurance market to the
practical  exclusion of often better alternatives. The employer-only system 
means that if workers lose or change their jobs, they also lose their  health
insurance. This anxiety about losing health benefits gives rise  to the twin
problems of a lack of &quot;portability&quot; and &quot;job lock.&quot;   The
portability problem is caused by the inability of Americans  to transfer their
health insurance from job to job. The related  phenomenon of job lock occurs
when an employee or family  member does not move to a more attractive job for
fear of losing  health benefits.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>This tax penalty against paying for health care directly or  obtaining
insurance from any source other than an employer must  be ended. Americans
should no longer be penalized for wanting  the security of owning and
controlling their own health care.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>3)  Health care costs for working people must be brought  down 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 4 -->  without sacrificing choice.</B>
While corporate premiums have  dipped during the past two years, health care
costs are still too high.  As employers try to control costs, they often simply
make  workers and their families pay a progressively larger share of the  health
insurance premiums, or else enroll them in managed care  plans which are far
more restrictive than traditional indemnity plans. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Candidates need to explain to the public that the way to  bring down health
costs is not to provide less, but to improve the  efficiency of the health care
system by stimulating much greater  consumer choice and competition. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><A NAME="FACTS">THE FACTS</A></B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The movement to reform the health care system gains much of  its momentum
from the spiraling cost of medical care in America. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>National health expenditures reached 13.9 percent of gross  domestic product
($884.2 billion) in 1993 and reached  approximately 15.6 percent ($1.1 trillion)
in  1995.<A HREF="ftnt10.htm#1">1</A>  This compares with
$251.1 billion in 1980, when national health expenditures were just  under 10
percent of GDP.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>While few Americans even know how much the country as  a whole spends on
health care, they do worry about the rising cost  to them personally, as
individuals or as business owners.  Typically, people mistakenly blame rising
costs on drug manufacturers,  insurance companies, physicians, and hospitals.
But the rapid growth  in medical expenditures actually is attributable to the
rising  demand for medical services and new technologies and, more 
significantly, to the peculiar way in which the tax system treats health 
insurance, 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 5 -->  which leads to an artificial
employer-based system for most  working Americans.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The major factor in determining access to health insurance  coverage is
employment. 
</P>
<P>Overwhelmingly, working Americans receive their health  benefits through
their employer. The reason: For most working  Americans to obtain any tax relief
for health care costs, they must ask  their employer to earmark part of their
worker's compensation to  pay for a health insurance policy that the employer 
not the worker   then owns. This tax break ties health insurance to the place of
 employment. As the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) explains:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>     Tying health insurance to employment causes further 
inefficiencies. Workers who are sick or who have a sick  family member can get
trapped in their jobs because most new  insurance policies will not cover the &quot;preexisting
condition.&quot;   Finally, because insurance is tied to one's job, it is 
inherently insecure. Employees can lose their insurance if they lose  their jobs
or if their employer stops carrying  insurance.<A
HREF="ftnt10.htm#2">2</A>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P>The tax benefit for having employment-based coverage (and  thus the penalty
for not obtaining a plan in this way) is huge. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>*</B>     In 1996, the federal treasury will lose
approximately $93 billion  in foregone revenues, given the tax-exempt status of
employer  contributions for medical insurance premiums and medical care. 
Households with income of $50,000 or more will share  approximately $53 billion
in tax relief on health care, compared to  households earning $20,000 or less,
which will receive only $5.4 billion in  tax relief.<A
HREF="ftnt10.htm#3">3</A> 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 6 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     Lower-income employees normally receive no tax relief for  any
out-of-pocket expenses (such as deductibles and copayments);  nor, except in
very unusual circumstances, would they receive tax  relief or subsidy for a
health insurance policy obtained from any  other source.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Only health insurance is tied to the place of employment in  this way. Other
major forms of insurance, such as  automobile, homeowner's, mortgage, and life,
are not normally tied to  an individual's place of employment. This constricts
the market  and eliminates a worker's personal ownership of an insurance plan. 
It also has other serious side effects.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     The current tax treatment of employment-based health  insurance
fuels higher health care costs.</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>According to the CBO:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>Employment based health insurance is valued by  businesses
through tax subsidies. Yet those subsidies exacerbate the  high cost of health
care as well as some of the problems of the  uninsured people. Because the
amount of the subsidy  increases with the size of the health insurance premium,
the subsidy  not only encourages employers to provide insurance but also 
encourages them to provide the most expensive health  insurance policies.
Employees who have a choice among health  insurance options are more likely to
choose more expensive  plans because they have to pay only part of the
additional  costs.<A HREF="ftnt10.htm#4">4</A>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Lower-income individuals and families are helped least by  the 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 7 -->  current system of tax relief for
employment-based health  insurance.</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The CBO points out that individuals and families at the upper  end of the
income scale receive far greater tax relief under the  current tax treatment of
employment-based health insurance. Those  who need the most assistance 
middle-income and lower-income  earners  benefit the least. In some cases,
lower-income wage  earners realize no benefit at all. The CBO states that:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>[F]amilies with higher incomes receive larger tax  subsidies
because they are in higher income tax brackets. Thus,  the reduction in taxable
income that the exclusion produces  is worth more to them on average than it is
to families in  lower tax brackets. Because the income tax is progressive, 
people with relatively high incomes (and higher tax rates), who  may need the
least assistance in getting health insurance,  benefit the most from the tax
exclusion.<A HREF="ftnt10.htm#5">5</A>
</P>
<P>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P>In 1996, households with incomes of $50,000 or over will  receive
approximately $53 billion in tax relief on health care, while  households
earning $20,000 or less will receive only $5.4  billion.<A
HREF="ftnt10.htm#6">6</A>  In short, this means that the
value of the tax exclusion is  heavily skewed towards upper-income groups at the
expense of  middle-income and lower-income groups. Lawmakers must explain to 
the American people why they favor perpetuating a government  policy which gives
little or no help to those lower-paid working  Americans who find it hardest to
afford medical care.

<P>A major misperception that conservative candidates must  explain to the
American public is that employment-based health  insurance is not a &quot;free
benefit.&quot;  Employers give employees nothing;  health benefits, like wages,
are part of an employee's total  compensation. Under normal market conditions,
there is invariably a  trade-off between wages and benefits; for every increase
in  employer-based health benefits, there is a corresponding decrease in wages 
and other compensation. As the CBO explains:

<!-- Generation of PM publication page 9 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The federal tax treatment of health insurance is exclusive.  Americans can
get tax relief for health insurance on only one  condition: that they get it
through their employer. If they have a large  benefits program, the tax breaks
are generous, and they get a large  amount of tax-free income; if the employer
offers a less generous  benefits package, they get a less generous tax break.
Employees who  purchase health insurance on their own receive negligible tax
relief  in comparison to employment-based packages. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The only other significant health tax break for employees  under current law
is that individuals who itemize deductions may  deduct what they have paid
during the taxable year (if not reimbursed  by insurance) for medical care
(including medical insurance) to  the extent that the total of such expenses
exceeds 7.5 percent of  their adjusted gross income (AGI). 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Employees and their families without adequate  employer-provided insurance
must go without insurance altogether or purchase  individual policies outside of
employer-based insurance. But  these individual policies are marketed on an
individual basis and  thus are considerably more expensive. Worse, a worker and
his  family will have to pay for these policies with after-tax dollars,  making
their purchase substantially more expensive than a similar  package of benefits
offered through an employer tax-free. For most  middle-class Americans, health
insurance outside of the  employer-based system is not a financially realistic
option.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Given the federally created constraints on the health  insurance market,
which basically limit Americans to one type of  insurance option (employer-based
insurance), it is not hard to see why  employees often are unable or unwilling
to move or change jobs,  even 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 10 -->  when career opportunities promise
better lives for them and  their families. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>It also is not surprising that uninsurance in the United States  is largely
a function of employment status. According to the  Employee Benefit Research
Institute (EBRI), a prominent  Washington think tank specializing in job-based
benefits, some 55.5 percent  of uninsured Americans are uninsured because of
loss of jobs  or change of jobs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Uninsurance also is highly correlated with employment in  small businesses,
or businesses with smaller profit margins. Under  the federal tax code, workers
in small business are not on a level  playing field with workers in large
corporations. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Employment-based coverage, like public programs, has  fostered the
rise in third-party payments.</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Between 1970 and 1980, the amount of insurance premiums  paid by American
employers for their employee group insurance  policies increased by more than
352 percent. During the  mid-1980s, premium increases were between 6 and 8
percent annually;  by 1990, they once again were in double digits. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In 1992, group health insurance plans amounted to  approximately 81 percent
of all insurance costs paid by employers in private  industry; group life
accounted for 2.5 percent; and worker's  compensation insurance accounted for
almost 16  percent.<A HREF="ftnt10.htm#9">9</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The growth of Medicare and Medicaid has contributed to the  trend toward
third-party payments. By 1992, private insurance and  gov
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 11 -->  ernment programs together
accounted for coverage provided  to 217 million Americans.<A

<P>
</P>
<P>Unlike automobile insurance, which provides for accidents  and other
unexpected events, medical insurance typically pays for  routine medical
services such as dental examinations. To  understand why third-party medical
insurance for routine services helps  drive up costs, consider what would happen
if automobile  insurance worked this way: It would cover not only damages due to
 accident or theft, but also all regular repairs, regular oil changes, and 
other routine expenses  perhaps even a weekly fuel fill-up. Now  suppose that
the insurance policy was paid for by the driver's  employer. The driver would
have little incentive either to question  a mechanic who said a certain repair
was needed or to quibble  about the price. The result would be predictable: a
rapid rise in  automobile repair and servicing costs.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>HOW EMPLOYERS HAVE RESPONDED TO COST INCREASES WITH MANAGED CARE</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Despite the increased utilization of third-party payments, the  rate of
increase in health care costs has slowed in recent years.  Between 1992 and
1993, medical care prices, as measured by  the Consumer Price Index for Medical
Care (CPI-MC), rose by  just 5.9 percent.<A
HREF="ftnt10.htm#12">12</A> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>One factor contributing to the recent reduction in growth has  been the
increased enrollment of workers by their employers in  man
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 12 -->  aged care organizations. In the
private sector, at least, these  arrangements are less expensive than
fee-for-service or  traditional indemnity insurance plans. Managed care
organizations are  networks of doctors and hospitals in which the patient faces 
varying levels of limitation in the choice and availability of services.  They
include:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs).</B> HMOs generally  provide a
defined set of health services to an enrolled  population within a specified
geographic location. Providers usually are  reimbursed on a capitated basis,
which is pre-determined by the  HMO. By December 1994, there were 574 HMOs with
a total  enrollment of 51.1 million persons, or about 19.5 percent of the U.S. 
population.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Preferred Provider Organizations (PPOs).</B> Developed in the  1980s,
the PPO tries to achieve the same type of cost savings as HMOs  by directing
patients to certain providers that have agreed to  cost-effective methods of
care delivery as prescribed by the PPO.  However, the PPO also gives patients
some degree of flexibility  and freedom by allowing them to select providers of
their choice at  a nominal fee. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Point-of-Service (POS) Plans.</B> POS plans combine the features  of
HMOs and PPOs. They utilize a network of selected,  contracted participating
providers, and if an employee goes to a plan  provider, there are minimal or no
out-of-pocket expenses. Enrollees also  can go to a provider not in the plan,
but will be charged  significantly higher copayments or deductibles.

<P><B>Who Are the Uninsured?
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 13 --> 
</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>It is routine to read that as many as 41 million people, or about  18
percent of the population, are uninsured. This estimate is  correct, but it also
hides more than it reveals. Americans need to be  reminded that 82 percent of
the nonelderly and 99 percent of  the elderly (aged 65 and over), or 215.7
million individuals, were  covered by private or public health insurance in 
1993.<A HREF="ftnt10.htm#13">13</A>  Why the seeming
contradiction?  Because millions of the uninsured  lack coverage for only a
short time, typically between jobs (a  problem that nevertheless must be
addressed). Furthermore, most have  access to health services if they choose to
use them.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Most commentators tend to view the uninsured as a large,  undifferentiated
mass. A closer look, however, reveals that they fall  into three broad
categories: the &quot;temporarily&quot; uninsured, who are  without insurance
only briefly or intermittently; the &quot;voluntarily&quot;  uninsured, who
choose not to pay for medical coverage, although it  is accessible to them and
affordable; and the &quot;chronically&quot;  uninsured, who want to be covered
but cannot obtain affordable  coverage. The last category is the most troubling,
since 50.7 percent  of the uninsured in 1993 were in families with income under 
$20,000 annually.<A HREF="ftnt10.htm#14">14</A>  It is this
relatively small segment of the  population that liberals often talk about but
have failed to help for the past  40 years. They represent a serious problem
that conservatives  must address.

</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Some of those seeking to address the weakness of the U.S.  health care
system look to Canada's single-payer,  government-controlled system. Although
Canada spends less on health care as a  percentage of gross national product (10
percent in 1995) than does  the United States (15.6 percent in 1995), its
per-capita health care  expenses are still the second-highest in the world,
outranked only  by those in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Moreover, it is important to understand how Canada's  lower spending affects
care.
</P>
<P><B><CITE>-</CITE></B>     Canada spends much less of its GDP on medical
research and  development, generally importing new technologies from the  United
States. The elderly, who tend to use health care services at a  higher rate, are

percent vs. 11 percent).

waiting lists  for many surgical procedures are perennial features of the

ranks first among the world's nations  on most measures of technological quality

<P>In addition to having to wait long periods for health care  services,

middle-class incomes,  the central and provincial governments are racing to

<P>Established as part of President Lyndon Johnson's Great  Society program in
1965, Medicaid and Medicare were created as  open-ended entitlements.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Medicaid</B> was established as a joint federal-state matching  program.
It is an open-ended entitlement that pays for medically  necessary health care
services provided to specific groups of  low-income individuals. Individuals
eligible for Medicaid now  include the aged, disabled, pregnant women with
children, and the blind.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Spending on Medicaid is out of control:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><CITE>*</CITE></B>     In FY 1995, Medicaid cost taxpayers $156.5
billion. Of  this amount, the federal government was responsible for 
approximately $89.2 billion.<A HREF="ftnt10.htm#21">21</A> 
This represents an 11,050 percent increase  over the program's initial cost to
the federal government of $800  million in FY 1966. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Remarkably, Medicaid was not intended to provide health  insurance to all
poor Americans. Originally, individuals became  eligible because of their &quot;categorical&quot;
relationship to two federal cash  assistance programs: Aid to Families with
Dependent  Children (AFDC) and Supplemental Security Income (SSI). However, 
congressional mandates since the late 1980s have resulted in  huge 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 18 -->  expansions in Medicaid
eligibility provisions. Now the  eligibility of individuals in additional
selected low-income groups is  based solely on the relationship of their incomes
to the federal  poverty level. In recent years, a progressively higher
proportion of  Medicaid spending is for nursing homes of formerly middle-class 
aged who have spent their resources and have become eligible for  Medicaid
custodial care. Each state is responsible for defining its  own package of
covered medical services, but some benefits are  mandated by Congress. These

<P>Many Americans still mistakenly believe that government  controls on the
price of pharmaceuticals, health insurance, and hospital  and physicians' fees
can reduce the cost of health care without  reducing either quality or
availability. Since the beginning,  Congress has been trying to keep down the
costs of Medicare and  Medicaid largely by reducing reimbursements as a way to
control the cost  of medical procedures. Since 1966, Congress has imposed 75 
different restrictions on doctors alone. In 1983 and 1989, respectively,  it
introduced the Prospective Payment System (PPS) of fixed  payments for

<P><B>A Model for Health Care Reform: The Consumer Choice  That Members of
Congress Already Have
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 26 --> 
</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Members of Congress and 9 million other federal workers and  retirees, as
well as their dependents, enjoy a very different system  of health care.
Candidates might want to suggest that  Congress should let Americans in on the
same kind of system it now  enjoys: a system based explicitly on the free-market
principles of  consumer choice and competition. This system, known as the 
Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP), enables almost  400 private
insurance carriers nationwide to compete for the  personal business of Members
of Congress and their staffs along with  almost 9 million federal employees,
retirees, and dependents. Once  a year, these special consumers can make their
personal choices. It  is virtually the only system in the country where
individuals  and families can pick and choose the kinds of benefits and 
insurance plans they want at prices they wish to pay. In any area of the 
country, federal workers and retirees can choose from among a  dozen to two
dozen plans. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Each year, the government contributes a set dollar amount to  each
individual or family for the purchase of a private insurance plan  of their
choice. If they choose a more expensive plan, with a  richer set of benefits,
they pay more directly for those benefits. If  they pick a less expensive plan,
with a less generous set of  benefits, they are able to pocket the savings from
making such a choice.  All of the plans have catastrophic coverage and, health
insurance  experts with the National Association of Retired Federal  Employees
(NARFE) rate all of the plans offered as &quot;good.&quot; 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Historically, the federal government's managerial role in  the FEHBP has
been passive. The Office of Personnel  Management (OPM), the federal agency
which administers the FEHBP, has  focused on negotiating with private insurance
carriers, setting  the 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 27 -->  basic ground rules for
competition among private insurers,  and making sure that private insurance
companies meet fiscal  solvency, consumer protection, and basic benefit
requirements  outlined in statute. While the FEHBP is imperfect, it has  many
strengths, particularly its level of consumer choice and  competition, the
bounteous benefits of a genuine market largely  unavailable to workers and their
families in employer-based  insurance. Compared with Medicare, the levels of
bureaucracy and  regulation are very low. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><CITE>-</CITE>     Wide Choice.</B> Unlike most employees or Medicare 
beneficiaries who are locked into an inflexible standardized benefits  package
pre-determined for them by an employer or the government,  Members of Congress
can choose from a broad range of health  insurance options. Not only are they
allowed to choose from a  wide variety of private plans, with a variety of
prices and benefits,  but they also pocket the savings that result from their
own choices.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Excellent Cost Control.</B> While Americans typically are  being
herded into health care plans at their employers' discretion in  order to cut
down on corporate costs, Members of Congress and all  federal employees in 1996
will enjoy a solid range of benefits  and plans at insignificant premium
increases. Furthermore, many  federal employees will see no premium increases
whatsoever. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>According to the government, federal workers in 1996 &quot;will find  a
total average premium increase of only four tenths of one  percent, compared to
an average private sector premium increase of  more than six percent over a
comparable  period.&quot;<A HREF="ftnt10.htm#40">40</A>  For
1995, premiums actually declined on average by 3.3 percent.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 28 -->

<P>
</P>
<P><B>Helpful Information for Making Choices.</B> The federal  government also
assists Members of Congress and federal workers and  retirees with unbiased
information on various health plans. But this  most often is not the chief
source of information on plan options.  A whole private-sector information
explosion has accompanied  the FEHBP. Members of Congress and federal workers
and  retirees can get helpful tips and advice from private-sector 
organizations, unions, and employee associations on the best plans available  to
workers, retirees, and their families in terms of value, quality,  and price.
For congressional and federal retirees, the National  Association of Retired
Federal Employees, which represents over  500,000 active and retired personnel,
suggests the best plans for those  needing specialized medical services.<I>

</P>
<P><B><CITE>-</CITE>     Portability.</B> Within the federal workforce, there
are many  different functions and many different jobs. Federal workers can move 
from one job to another, or from one federal agency or department  to another,
and keep their health insurance plans. While  federal workers have a chance to
change insurance plans once a year,  most are satisfied with the quality and
service that their plans  provide them. If they belong to a union or an employee
organization,  they may wish  as approximately one-third of them now do  to 
retain their union-sponsored or employee organization-sponsored  health
insurance plan. Moreover, federal workers, unlike an  increasingly large number
of workers in the private sector, can take their  health insurance plan with
them when they retire, even if they retire  early at age 55. Because they have
this level of portability in their  insurance, they do not suffer the same kinds
of anxieties that  commonly plague workers and their families in the private
sector.

</P>
<P><B>The FEHBP as a Model for Health Care Reform</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Medicare.</B> The basic market principles of consumer choice  and
competition that underlie the FEHBP are at the heart of  congressional efforts
to reform Medicare. Many of the key features  that federal workers and retirees
now find so attractive in the  FEHBP are incorporated in the congressional
reform plan. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>First, like retired Members of Congress and federal workers,  Medicare
beneficiaries would be given a choice. They could keep  traditional Medicare, if
they wish, or they could choose from a  full range of qualified private health
care plans, including an  alternative fee-for-service plan; a managed care plan,
such as an HMO  or Preferred Provider Option; a &quot;provider service network&quot;
plan  (a plan run directly by physicians or hospitals); plans sponsored  by
private organizations or employers; or a special medical  savings account option
coupled with catastrophic health insurance  coverage. Like plans that compete
today for the dollars of retired  Members of Congress and federal workers, these
plans would have  to meet similar consumer protection, fiscal solvency, and core
 benefit requirements. In fact, the addition of the medical savings  account
option, which would allow Medicare beneficiaries to deposit  a significant
portion of the government contribution to a  tax-free account to pay routine
medical expenses, is a distinct  improvement over the current FEHBP, which does
not yet have a medical  savings account option. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Second, like retired Members of Congress and federal  workers, senior
citizens could get better value for their money in a  competitive health
insurance market. Medicare currently spends  about 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 30 -->  $4,800 per year for each
beneficiary. Under the congressional  reform plan, it would increase to $7,100
by the year 2002. Just  as federal workers and retirees get a specific
government  contribution for the purchase of private insurance in the FEHBP,
Medicare  beneficiaries would get a specific government contribution. With  this
contribution, not only could they choose the plan or option  best suited to
their personal needs, but they also could pocket the  savings of their personal
choices, getting cash rebates from the use  of medical savings accounts and
other private plans. In other  words, the congressional Medicare reform
proposal, by enabling  Medicare beneficiaries to pick and choose their plans and
options just  as federal workers and retirees do, introduces economic  dynamics
that are similar to those which drive the popular FEHBP. For  the past several
years especially, these dynamics have served to  improve the quality of health
care services and to hold premium  costs down below those of both the private
sector and the Medicare  program. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Reforming the Private Insurance Market</B>. The success of  the FEHBP is
not due to some mysterious managerial expertise  concentrated among bureaucrats
at the Office of Personnel  Management. It is due largely to the fact that
market forces do most of  the &quot;heavy lifting&quot; in this unusual, but
popular, system. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The 35-year experience of the FEHBP shows that individual  consumers,
properly armed with information, can make rational  health care insurance
choices. That experience also shows that  intense and direct competition among
insurance companies for  consumers' dollars can help control costs, just as
costs are controlled in  other sectors of the economy. On this basis, Members of
Congress  could construct a consumer choice health care system for every  Ameri
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 31 -->  can that resembles, in its broad
outlines, the kind of  consumer choice and competition that is now enjoyed
almost exclusively  by Members of Congress and federal workers and retirees. But
to  do this, Congress will have to take very specific steps:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><CITE>-</CITE>     First, Congress should establish neutrality in the
federal tax  code.</B> This could be done in one of two ways. The best way,
within  the context of reform, would be by enacting a flat tax. This means  that
there would be no tax advantage for insurance or for health  care services,
whether purchased through one's place of employment  or some other way. And
there would be no tax on the earnings of  savings accounts for health care. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> Alternatively, every American family could get tax relief, in  the form of
a tax credit or a voucher, for the purchase of health  insurance or health care
services, regardless of the breadwinner's  place or status of employment. This
tax relief would be given to  individuals and families to use in a fashion that
best meets their  personal needs and circumstances: to offset the purchase of 
health insurance, out-of-pocket medical expenses, or the deposit of  funds in a
medical savings account, a tax-free account like an  individual retirement
account (IRA) in which funds roll over year after  year and from which
individuals or families could pay routine  medical expenses. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><CITE>-</CITE>     Second, if households are to receive special tax
relief in the  form of credits or vouchers, the head of every household should
have  to purchase at least a basic package of catastrophic health  insurance.</B>
As with the FEHBP, Congress could set basic ground rules  for health insurance
or certify similar ground rules developed by  the states, including the
guaranteed renewability of health  insurance 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 32 -->  policies; a limitation on
exclusions for pre-existing medical  conditions; and limited underwriting of
health insurance that  is grounded in age, sex, and geography and provides for 
premium discounts for individuals or families who enroll in  preventive health
care or health promotion programs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>These tax and insurance changes would have a dramatic effect  by changing
today's health insurance market into a consumer  choice system. Like the FEHBP,
the private health insurance  market would benefit from intense competition
among private  insurance carriers, leading to an explosion of group insurance
options  outside of the place of employment and enabling trade associations, 
professional organizations, unions, employee organizations,  churches, and
religious institutions to sponsor their own health  insurance options for
workers and their families. Like the FEHBP, such  a market would put a premium
on the demand for information  on quality, price, and benefit. Outcomes research
would be in  demand for doctors and hospitals and medical groups. Consumer 
organizations and affinity groups, like the American Association of  Retired
Persons (AARP), would monitor performance and evaluate  different health plan
options and their doctors and hospitals.

<P>
</P>
<P>THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Clinton Administration will long be remembered for its  attempt and
subsequent failure to federalize the American  health care system in 1994.
Criticizing the current system as wasteful  and bureaucratic, the Administration
initially enjoyed the support  of Americans in principle when it promised
security, simplicity,  sav
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 33 -->  ings, choice, quality, and
personal responsibility. Moreover,  the President argued that sound reform
should be based on the  market principles of consumer choice and competition.
But the  record showed that President Clinton's costly, 1,342-page Health 
Security Act, an enormously complex and bureaucratic measure, was  anything but
an improvement over the current system. On the  contrary, and despite the
repeated denials of Administration  officials to this day, the Clinton
Administration's huge and complex  health reform legislation attempted to bring
one-seventh of the  U.S. economy under government control.<A
HREF="ftnt10.htm#41">41</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>On the subject of Medicare, President Clinton has refused to  consider any
major reform since the 1994 election. Rather than  overhaul the program so that
it can provide benefits to the next  generation, the Clinton Administration
Medicare reform plan  would achieve modest budget savings largely through even
tighter  controls on doctors and hospitals.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>According to Guy King, a spokesman for the prestigious  American Academy of
Actuaries and former Actuary of the Health Care  Financing Administration
(HCFA), &quot;It is similar to the quick  fixes enacted in the past that have
allowed the Medicare program to  fall into its current financial state. This
proposal also includes  accounting tricks to achieve short term fiscal soundness
in the  hospital insurance program. In the long run, these tricks may undermine 
the economic discipline of the trust fund.&quot;<A

<P><B>THE 104th CONGRESS</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>During the first session of the 104th Congress, federal  lawmakers took
important steps to improve the functioning of the  American 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 34 -->  health care system. Of the
several legislative proposals  introduced to reform the current health system,
the most important was one  to reform the financially troubled Medicare program.
Virtually all  of the others were narrow adjustments in existing law or 
incremental reform proposals. Some of the key changes, including  Medicare
reform, were incorporated into the Balanced Budget Act of  1995, which was
vetoed by President Clinton on December 6, 1995.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Reforming Medicare. </B>In the fall of 1995, Congress passed  sweeping
Medicare reform which would have given the elderly  real choices in their health
care delivery for the first time while  taking important steps to stave off
bankruptcy and help restore  financial solvency to the program. While these
reforms are both  important and necessary, however, taxpayers should realize
that, despite  the level of bitter controversy surrounding them, they still fall
far  short of a permanent fix for the financially troubled Medicare  system.
They are serious structural changes, but still merely defer the  financial
collapse of the Hospital Insurance (HI) Trust Fund  until 2010. Baby boomers
make up a huge bloc of future retirees, but  no one age 49 and under is
guaranteed, under any of the  proposals offered for congressional consideration
in 1995, that the  current Medicare program will be available upon retirement. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Some of the key elements embodied in the vetoed  congressional Medicare
reforms include:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>1)  An option to pick private plans.</B> The legislation
offers  beneficiaries the option of enrolling in a private health plan as an 
alternative to traditional Medicare. These private plans are referred to  as &quot;MedicarePlus&quot;
plans. MedicarePlus plans include 1) a  coordinated care plan (HMO, PPO);  2) a
combination of a high-deductible plan and contributions to  a high-deductible
Medicare medical savings account; 3) plans  offered by a Provider-Sponsored
Organization (PSO); 4) a  union, Taft-Hartley, or qualified association plan;
and 5) a  fee-for-service plan that reimburses providers on the basis of a
privately  determined fee schedule. Groups such as the American Association  of
Retired Persons (AARP), United Auto Workers (UAW),  and churches could sponsor
health plans under the MedicarePlus  program. By introducing a much greater
degree of consumer  choice within a competitive market, the reform could be
expected to  reduce the rate of increase in Medicare spending. Traditional 
Medicare would remain available as an option.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>2)  A defined contribution.</B> One of the key elements in the 
congressional reform proposal is to turn Medicare benefits into a  defined
contribution from the government towards the purchase of  a MedicarePlus plan,
as opposed to today's open-ended  entitlement to specific services.
Congressional budget projections indicate  that the amount available for
retirees would rise from $4,800 to  $7,100 per capita from 1995 to 2002.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Under the reform, the federal government would make  monthly premium
payments to the MedicarePlus plan chosen by the  beneficiary. To ensure
stability in payments to MedicarePlus plans,  the government's contribution
levels would be adjusted to  recognize legitimate variations in the costs of
doing business in  different geographic areas. If beneficiaries wished a more
generous  plan, they would have to pay the difference. But if they chose a  more
economical plan that cost less than the defined contribution,  they would be
allowed to receive 75 percent of the difference, with  the remaining 25 percent
being deposited in the HI trust fund. If  an 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 36 -->  enrollee elected a medical
savings account (MSA) option, the  entire rebate would be deposited into that
individual's MSA.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>3)  A new Medicare trust fund.</B> Liberals in Congress claimed  that
projected savings from the reform would be used to pay for  tax cuts. This is
incorrect. The Medicare reform created a &quot;lock  box&quot; mechanism to
place all savings from the Part B program into  a new Medicare Preservation
Trust Fund and specifically  prohibit any transfers to pay for future tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>4)  Creation of Provider-Sponsored Organizations and other  group plans.</B>
To make Medicare more competitive, the  congressional reform created a new
option for the elderly to purchase their  health insurance  Provider-Sponsored
Organizations (PSOs). These  are managed care plans created primarily by
physicians and  hospitals. In addition to expanding the range of choices and
creating  more competition within the MedicarePlus program, it is widely 
believed that providers (physicians and hospitals) in smaller  communities would
be better able to find efficiencies in providing  access to health care than
some of the more traditional insurers.  Certain rules applied to the PSOs are
not applicable to other  private plans.<A HREF="ftnt10.htm#43">43</A>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Reforming Medicaid. </B>According to the Congressional  Budget Office,
the federal government alone spent $89.2 billion in  FY 1995 on Medicaid.
Medicaid costs have been exploding.  Like Medicare, Medicaid is plagued with
internal inefficiencies, as  well as rising costs. And as with Medicare, failure
to address  these problems translates into direct and painful tax increases  on
America's working families. Since 1990, Medicaid has been  the fastest growing
program within the federal budget.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 37 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Governors have testified before Congress about the  increasing strain that
exploding Medicaid costs impose on their  respective budgets, often restricting
investment in such other crucial  human service programs as child welfare,
education, public safety,  and judicial services. Responding to this financial
crisis,  Congress passed a block grant reform proposal which would enable states
 to provide medical assistance to low-income individuals and  families with a
much greater degree of flexibility. Allowing the states  to determine who is
eligible under their new programs would  eliminate the bureaucratic morass that
has resulted in mandatory  coverage for individuals whose needs are no greater,
and often are  less, than those of others for whom coverage is  prohibited.<A
HREF="ftnt10.htm#44">44</A> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>President Clinton vetoed this measure. The main difference  between the
vetoed block grant proposal and the current program  is that states would have
been given much wider latitude in  determining which segment of the population
is eligible for the new  program. States were permitted to cover any individuals
up to  250 percent of the federal poverty level. In 1995, this would  have meant
up to $31,475 for a family of three. Under the  congressional reform measure,
the states would be required to cover two  groups of qualifying individuals:
pregnant women and children aged  12 and younger living in families with income
below the federal  poverty level, and disabled individuals (as determined by the
state).
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>States also would have been required to meet minimum  spending obligations
for each of three specific groups of beneficiaries:  1) families with income
below 185 percent of poverty with a  pregnant woman or child; 2) elderly
individuals; and 3) disabled  individuals. For each group, the minimum
percentage each state  would 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 38 -->  be obligated to spend is 85
percent of the amount the states  were required to spend on mandatory services
(including nursing  facility services) under current Medicaid law during FY
1995. The 85  percent requirement also would apply to payments for Medicare 
premium assistance for low-income elderly persons.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Special Needs of Children.</B> The legislation recognized the  unique
needs of children with special health care problems. Children  with serious
chronic conditions or disabilities such as cerebral  palsy, cystic fibrosis,
cancer, or heart conditions represent  approximately two percent of all children
in America. Despite their  relatively small numbers, however, the intensity of
care provided to  this population is high and requires particular attention.
Therefore,  the congressional Medicaid reform required states to outline  their
plans for providing care to children in their jurisdictions with  special health
care needs.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Under the congressional reform proposal, states were required  to include
descriptions of their objectives, goals, and methods  employed to achieve such
results. With regard to objectives  and goals, the states were to be allowed to
take into consideration  their financial resources, economic conditions,
adequacy of  existing infrastructure, and  most important  their own particular 
priorities. Current legal protections designed to protect the spouses  and adult
children of nursing home residents against  impoverishment were maintained in
the legislation.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Nursing Care Standards</B>. While the elderly constitute less  than 25
percent of the Medicaid population, the mounting costs  associated with
long-term nursing care account for approximately  70 percent of the program's
costs. The bill retained the quality  assur
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 39 -->  ance standards for nursing homes
that were passed in the  Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987 (OBRA 1987).
OBRA  1987 reformed the Medicaid requirements for nursing homes  participating
in the program. The Medicaid reform in the Balanced  Budget Act of 1995 retained
these quality assurance provisions,  which include the following:

<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Restoring Tax Deduction for Self-Employed Buying Health 
Insurance.</B> Congress passed legislation that would permanently  increase and
extend the tax deduction for health insurance costs of  self-
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 40 -->  employed individuals from 25
percent to 30 percent. The bill  was signed into law by President Clinton.<A
HREF="ftnt10.htm#46">46</A>  The Balanced Budget  Act of
1995, vetoed by the President, also included an  amendment which would gradually
increase the 30 percent deduction to  50 percent between 1996 and 2002. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Medical Savings Accounts.</B> The Balanced Budget Act included  a
provision to allow Americans to establish medical savings  accounts (MSAs). This
revolutionary change in health care  financing promises to have a significant
impact on the functioning of  the health insurance market. Contributions of up
to $2,000 for  individuals and $4,000 for families, including employer 
contributions, would be 100 percent deductible from adjusted gross income. 
Interest earned on the income is subject to taxation.  Withdrawals made for
non-medical expenditures would be included in  the individual's gross income and
subject to a 10 percent tax  before age 59 and a half. After that, withdrawals
could be made for  any purpose without the 10 percent tax. For a health plan to
be  classified as a catastrophic coverage plan, the minimum  deductible would
have to be $1,500 for individuals and $3,000 for families. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Improving Portability of Coverage.</B> Representative Bill  Thomas
(R-CA) introduced a bill (H.R. 1610) to end the problem of  &quot;job lock&quot;
that has been created under employment-based health  insurance systems. The
legislation would allow individuals  moving from one job to another to remain
continuously covered even  if they suffered from pre-existing medical
conditions. With the  use of pre-existing condition exclusions by insurers thus
limited,  individuals moving from one employer group health plan to  another
would not normally be subject to such exclusions. At the end  of the first
session, this bill was pending in the full Committee  on 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 41 -->  Ways and Means.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>A similar bill (S.1028) was introduced in the Senate by  Senator Nancy
Kassebaum (R-KS). Like the Thomas bill, S. 1028  would limit exclusions for
pre-existing conditions. By prohibiting  health plans from limiting or denying
coverage for more than 12  months for a medical condition that was diagnosed or
treated during  the previous six months, it is intended to alleviate some of the
 burdens facing workers trapped in an employment-based health  system. The bill
also would modify the Consolidated Omnibus  Reconciliation Act of 1986 (COBRA).
Under current law, COBRA states  that workers in a firm with over 20 employees
can remain insured  between jobs by continuing their enrollment in the company's
 plan, paying the premiums themselves, for 18 months after they  leave the
company. Coverage for spouses and dependent children  remains in effect for a
total of 36 months in cases of death or  divorce. S.1028 extends the length of
coverage under  COBRA. While this is viewed by some as a consumer protection
measure,  it has potentially harmful effects because it would increase the 
costs of health insurance to employers who ultimately pass on any  additional
costs to active employees. In general, healthy  ex-employees decline COBRA
coverage while high risk ex-employees  accept and pay directly for coverage.
However, the employer is  required to pay the actual claims costs for former
workers who elect  COBRA coverage.

<P>
</P>
<P><B>Increased Incentives for Long-Term Care Insurance.</B> Included  in the
Balanced Budget Act of 1995 was a provision which  would encourage individuals
to purchase private long-term care  insurance. By allowing tax-free withdrawals
from an individual  retirement account (IRA) and other pension plans to purchase
 private 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 42 -->  long-term care insurance, it
would help alleviate the financial  pressures of the Medicaid program, which
spent $14.5 billion in  FY 1990 for nursing home care alone.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Increased Delivery Options for Seniors  Medicare Select.</B>  Last
summer, Congress also enacted legislation to amend the  Social Security Act to
permit so-called Medicare Select policies to  be offered in all states. The
measure was signed into law by  President Clinton. The new law would: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><CITE>-</CITE></B>     Provide a three-year extension of
the Medicare Select  program. Under Medicare Select, beneficiaries have the
option to  purchase their Medigap (Medicare supplemental) policies through 
managed care networks. Studies have shown that Medicare Select  products have
saved beneficiaries between 10 percent and 37 percent  in premiums over the
traditional fee-for-service Medicare  supplemental programs. This has translated
into savings of up to  $300 per year for many seniors.<A
HREF="ftnt10.htm#47">47</A>  Especially for those on fixed

required to  conduct a study that compares health care costs, quality of care,

program automatically would become  permanent.

<P><B>WHAT TO DO IN 1997</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Fix Medicare and Medicaid.</B> The Medicare program is 
facing bankruptcy. It must be fixed, or the current and future  generations of
taxpayers will be burdened with unprecedented increases  in levels of taxation
required to sustain it. Likewise, exploding  Medicaid costs also must be brought
under control.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Congress passed legislation in 1995 to address these problems,  but the bill
was vetoed by President Clinton. The reforms would  have helped restore the
finances of Medicare while giving new  choices and security to the elderly. In
1997, these reforms should be  enacted into law. Clinton also vetoed structural
reform of  Medicaid  a reform which would have integrated Medicaid into the rest
 of the welfare system and given states the flexibility to find ways  of keeping
down costs by improving efficiency. This  legislation needs to be enacted in
1997.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Adopt the flat tax.</B> For reasons of general tax reform, many  Members
of Congress want to overhaul the entire federal income  tax code, simplify it,
and replace it with a flat tax (either as a flat  income tax or as a sales tax).
The flat tax proposal is perhaps  the best way to bring neutrality to the tax
code and eliminate the  inequities and inefficiencies of the current tax
treatment of health  insurance. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Under a flat tax, there would be no special tax exclusion on  the monetary
value of health care benefits provided through the  place of work. All health
benefits, like wages and other  compensation, would be counted as taxable income
and would be taxable at a  flat rate. Because there would be no built-in bias
toward  employment-
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 44 -->  based health insurance and no
discrimination against  non-employment-based health insurance, whether group or
individual,  Americans would have a powerful incentive to seek the best value 
for their money, weighing the quality and service of a benefits  package against
the price. Certainly, employers may still wish to  offer insurance or get good
group rates for their insurance; but  an employer's preferred option no longer
would have an exclusive  tax advantage, and thus would be in competition with
packages  sponsored by other organizations, including unions, trade 
associations, or other entities offering different packages. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>A second advantage of the flat tax approach is that it  eliminates the
current tax advantage of third-party payment. Today, there  is no tax advantage
to paying for medical services directly. From  a tax position, it is best if
payment for health care services can  be accomplished through a third-party
payer. If Americans were  no longer penalized for paying directly, doctors and
hospitals  would receive cash payments more often from patients themselves. 
Moreover, cost control would be more effective; a dollar paid for  services
directly would have to be less expensive than a dollar paid  to a doctor through
the administrative apparatus of a third-party  payment system. And when
insurance companies weighed such  features as co-payment and deductibles, these
features would be  offered to consumers without the bias of the tax code
affecting  how they are determined.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Under a flat tax option, help for lower-income people  those  who are
ineligible for Medicaid or assistance for the unemployed   can be simplified and
secured through the adoption of a  straight voucher system. 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 45 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Short of a flat tax, establish an individual tax credit for health  care
spending and MSAs.</B> If it should decide to forego reforming  the tax code by
establishing a flat tax, Congress could achieve  neutrality in the treatment of
health care by establishing an individual  tax credit to replace the current tax
exclusion for  employment-based health insurance. The amount of the tax credit
can be varied  by income level and family status to control the cost of the 
subsidy and target the benefits.<A HREF="ftnt10.htm#48">48</A>
 A refundable tax credit for health  insurance, medical services, and
contributions to a medical savings  account would enable lower-income Americans
to buy into  the health insurance market on the same terms as all other 
Americans.<A HREF="ftnt10.htm#49">49</A>  By providing a
larger subsidy for low-income families,  a credit would encourage more people to
secure health  insurance, reduce adverse selection, and discourage free  riders.<A
HREF="ftnt10.htm#50">50</A> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>A tax credit approach also has the benefit of advancing solid  welfare
reform by encouraging work and targeting the benefits of  the credit to the
segment of the population that otherwise would  remain uninsured without
Medicaid, a key element of the  welfare system. While the goal of medical
coverage for all who want  to purchase it is realized more efficiently through
tax credits, such  a system also increases the numbers in the labor force. The 
CBO confirms this: &quot;[T]he credit would also reduce the current 
disincentive for welfare recipients to enter the work force. At  present,
welfare recipients can lose most of their benefits when they go  to work.... [A]
tax credit would reduce this  penalty.&quot;<A
HREF="ftnt10.htm#51">51</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Comprehensive legislation establishing an individual tax  credit, The
Consumer Choice Health Security Act (H.R. 3698,  S.1743), was introduced in 1994
in the House by Representative  Cliff Stearns (R-FL) and in the Senate by
Senator Don Nickles (R-OK).
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 46 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Under this approach, Americans would be able to choose a  package of health
benefits according to their needs and those of  the family. Whichever plan is
chosen by the head of household,  the family would receive tax relief, in the
form of an individual  tax credit, for the purchase of the health plan. Most of
the cost of  the tax credits would be offset by the fact that they replace the 
current tax exclusion of health benefits. Additional savings in  Medicare and
Medicaid reforms, outlined in the Nickles-Stearns bill,  would offset the
remaining costs of the new tax credit program.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Thus, the tax credit would replace the current tax exclusion  for
company-sponsored health plans. This means that instead of  having a tax break
for the plan picked by his employer, a  worker would be able to claim a sliding
scale credit, based on income  or health care needs, for the plan of his
choosing, as well as for  out-of-pocket expenses and contributions to a medical
savings  account.<A HREF="ftnt10.htm#52">52</A>  The tax
credits would be refundable, meaning that if  the credit actually exceeded the
family's federal tax liability, the  government would pay the difference.
Middle-income families  would benefit significantly from a tax credit approach.
A tax credit  patterned after the Nickles-Stearns legislation would mean a net 
tax cut for every income group, including the working poor. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>If a head of household was satisfied with the plan already  offered by an
employer, the family could continue to be enrolled in it. If  a worker preferred
a plan offered through a different  organization, such as a union, church, or
professional association, the  employer would be required to &quot;cash out&quot;
the actuarial value of the  worker's current benefits and give the money to the
employee to use  for another health plan. Under the legislation, employers would
 have 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 47 -->  to offer employees the right to
convert their current health  plans into individual policies, which employees
then would own.  Employers also would be required to add the value of their 
current coverage to the worker's wages, with each worker then able to  use the
money either to pay for the company-sponsored plan or to  buy coverage from an
alternative source. To make the system  simpler for employees, and to ensure
timely premium payments,  employers would be responsible for directing premium
payments (just  as they currently do for the company plan) to the health plans 
designated by their employees. Employers also would adjust  tax withholdings to
reflect the credit available to employees. If  a worker became unemployed, the
family would receive a  refundable tax credit (voucher) to offset the cost of
the designated  plan. Workers and their families would have health care
security,  since they would be able to own their health coverage and take it 
with them if they changed jobs, even during a spell of unemployment. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Reform the insurance system.</B> Tax reform does not eliminate  the
necessity of making certain changes in the rules governing  the health insurance
market. Companies should not exclude a  person from coverage because of
pre-existing illness or drop a person  because he gets sick; thus, there should
be both limitations on  such exclusions and guaranteed renewability of
insurance.  Moreover, underwriting procedures, and hence premiums, should
reflect  age, gender, and geographic location. Insurance companies,  however,
also should be able to offer premium discounts to individuals  who enroll in
programs to promote healthy lifestyles, or for  checkups and other steps taken
to detect or prevent illness. Ideally,  these reforms of the health insurance
market should be effected at  the state level.

<P><B>Short-Term Reforms</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Short of comprehensive health care reform based on overhaul  of the tax
system and free-market reforms, Congress can  pursue short-term, or incremental,
reforms. The central problem with  the incremental approach is that if it is not
done carefully and  deliberately, reform measures can lead in any conceivable
direction.  Liberals in Congress who have sponsored the Clinton plan or 
legislation establishing a Canadian-style system have a very clear goal:  a
government-run, highly regulated national health care system.  Unless
conservatives have an equally clear sense of where they  are going, they may end
up supporting short-term measures that  actually move the country closer to the
liberals' ideological  goal. Therefore, conservatives ought to evaluate any
proposal by  asking whether it promotes a genuine free market in health care; 
promotes real consumer choice and genuine competition; empowers  patients to
make the key decisions concerning their choice of  physician, insurance plan,
and benefit options; gives employees and  their families direct control over
their own health care dollars;  gives workers and their families the right to
own their own health  insurance plan and enables them to take it with them
wherever they  go; and reduces the bureaucratic overregulation and paperwork 
requirements characteristic of the current health care  system.<A
HREF="ftnt10.htm#53">53</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>There are several reforms that would move toward a health  care system that
is more secure and controlled by families rather  than employers, insurance
companies, or the government: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Permit self-employed individuals 100 percent tax
deductibility  for health insurance.</B> The self-employed currently are allowed
to  deduct up to 30 percent of health insurance costs. While the  Bal
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 49 -->  anced Budget Act of 1995 would
increase this to 50 percent  over the next 7 years, true tax fairness would
place individually  purchased plans and employment-based health insurance on the
 same level. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Require employers to disclose to workers the true cost of  employee
health benefits.</B> A huge obstacle to serious health care  reform is that too
many Americans think that their employer is  paying for their health care.
While, under an employer-based  system, the employer becomes the means for
transmission of  premium payment and takes a tax deduction for doing so, the
truth is  that households bear 100 percent of health care costs. This simple 
reform would give workers a clearer understanding of just  how much of their
compensation goes to cover health care costs.  It could be accomplished by
requiring a periodic statement on  the employee's pay stub specifying both the
amount the employer  has paid in health care benefits and the corresponding
amount  by which his cash wages and other compensation have been reduced. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Allow employers and employees to contribute to flexible  spending
accounts that can be rolled over from year to year.</B> Many  firms allow
employees to contribute pre-tax income to a flexible  spending account, which
can be used to pay for out-of-pocket  medical expenses. Unspent end-of-the-year
balances, however, cannot  be rolled over; they revert to the employer. The new
Congress  should change the law and permit these nontaxable accounts to be 
rolled over tax free from year to year. If an employee leaves a firm, he  or she
should be able to retain the tax-free account for medical  costs in the form of
a medical savings or health security account.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Promote medical malpractice reform.</B> Medical malpractice  costs 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 50 -->  have contributed to increased
medical costs. In conjunction  with medical malpractice litigation, the current
legal system allows  unlimited compensation for non-economic damages. 
Non-economic damages do not include compensation for medical costs, 
rehabilitative costs, foregone wages, or other out-of-pocket expenses.  The fear
of frivolous malpractice suits has driven approximately  75 percent of all
doctors to perform unnecessary tests because of  the threat of liability.<A
HREF="ftnt10.htm#54">54</A>  The House passed legislation to
limit  non-economic damages associated with medical malpractice, but  the
measure died in the Senate under intense pressure from trial  lawyers' groups
and the threat of a filibuster spearheaded by  Senate liberals. Medical
malpractice and tort reform should be  addressed in 1997, but preferably at the
state level. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Adopt antitrust reform.</B> &quot;Safe harbors&quot; from federal
anti-trust  laws should be created for certain groups of doctors, hospitals, 
and other medical providers; for medical self-regulatory entities that  do not
operate for financial gain; for certain joint ventures  involving high
technology and costly equipment and services; for  certain hospital mergers; and
for health care joint ventures that would  increase access to health care and
enhance health care quality.  Current antitrust laws prohibit such arrangements,
and thus  frustrate efficiencies in the system which would reduce health care 
costs and benefit consumers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Similar reforms were passed by the 104th Congress as part of  the Balanced
Budget Act of 1995. These reforms are needed to  allow the creation of
Provider-Sponsored Organizations (PSOs) as  another health plan option for
elderly and disabled beneficiaries,  thus adding to the available choices in the
private sector for senior  citizens. Rural areas especially would benefit from
the creation  of 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 51 -->  PSOs.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>As a condition of any insurance reform at the federal level,  eliminate
state-mandated benefits.</B> The health insurance industry is  one of the most
highly regulated sectors of the American  economy. But regulation of health
insurance usually is within the  jurisdiction of the state, not the federal
government. A key component of  state regulation is the imposition of mandated
benefits on  insurance firms licensed at the state level. These mandates are the
product  of intense special-interest lobbying at the state level, where  medical
specialists and practitioners have succeeded in imposing  coverage requirements.
Over the years, the number and scope of these  benefits have grown
substantially, adding to the cost of  insurance plans sold to employers and
employees. Nationwide, there are  over 1,000 such state mandates, ranging from
in vitro fertilization  to chiropractic care and psychological counseling.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Congress should refrain from regulating health insurance at  the federal
level. But in reforming the federal tax code to establish  an individual tax
credit or voucher system, Congress could  specify that the only legal
requirement for securing a tax credit is that  any plan receiving the proceeds
of such a credit must include  catastrophic coverage. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>If Congress should find it necessary to intervene in the  regulation of
insurance, this reform could be accomplished through  federal preemption,
requiring only catastrophic coverage for health  insurance. Such a measure would
substantially reduce the cost of  insurance for small business at the state and
local levels. It also  would allow for more pooling of insurance and ensure
consumer  protection against underinsurance, which is the true meaning of a loss
 or 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 52 -->  absence of catastrophic coverage.

</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Even if the comprehensive congressional reform measure had  not been vetoed,
however, significant problems would remain in  traditional Medicare and would
need to be addressed. Among them:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Taxpayer burdens for Part B are still too high.</B> The  Medicare
supplemental medical insurance (SMI) program, also known  as Part B, is
voluntary. All persons 65 or over may enroll by paying  a monthly premium 
currently $42.50 per month. This amount  is approximately 25 percent of the
program's costs today. Most  of the debate on Medicare has focused on the
impending  bankruptcy of the trust fund in Part A of the program, the part that 
reimburses hospitals. But in terms of the growing fiscal pressure on  working
families to sustain Medicare, a more serious problem is Part  B, which has been
growing at 12.5 percent a year. Under the  traditional arrangement that the
taxpayer pick up 75 percent or more  of program costs  the position supported by
the Clinton  Administration and liberals in Congress  the CBO projects that the 
taxpayer burden to finance Medicare Part B over five years will be  $589.7
billion over the next seven years (1996-2002). This amount  easily surpasses the
Clinton tax increase of $262 billion between  1994 and 1998, the largest tax
increase in American history. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The reforms passed by the House and Senate in 1995 and  vetoed by President
Clinton would have frozen the Part B  beneficiary contribution at the current
rate of 31.5 percent at least  through 2002. This is an improvement, but it
still would not fully  address the crushing future tax burden facing America's
working  families. Under every scenario, that burden will increase sharply, 
especially when the nation's 77 million baby boomers begin to retire.   
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>When Medicare was enacted in 1965, the original contract  with America's
taxpayers was that they would pay for 50 percent of  the program's cost. That
contract between Congress and the  taxpayers was broken by Congress, leaving the
taxpayers to pay an  increasingly disproportionate share of the cost. Congress
should  restore the Part B premium to 50 percent of program costs for  average
Americans, as originally intended. More affluent  Americans should receive no
subsidy.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Congress should allow patients to contract privately with  doctors,
hospitals, and other medical providers.</B> Private contracting  arrangements
help both the beneficiary and the taxpayer. Under  such an arrangement, no
Medicare reimbursement claims would be  filed because none would be sought
either by the provider or by the  patient. This would occur at no cost to
insurance companies or  federal taxpayers. Second, beneficiaries would be free
to receive  their health care from any provider they chose without government 
intervention. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Many elderly and disabled persons, for a variety of personal  reasons, have
expressed to their physicians a desire to keep the  federal government
completely out of the picture. However,  Section 1848(g)(4)(A)(i) of the Social
Security Act requires health  care providers to &quot;[c]omplete and submit a
claim for such services on  a standard claim form specified by the Secretary to
the carrier  on behalf of a beneficiary.&quot;<A
HREF="ftnt10.htm#55">55</A>  Surprisingly, the Department of 
Health and Human Services, which is responsible for enforcing this  statute, has
failed to put forth a clear policy against private  contracting. In <I>Stewart
v. Sullivan</I><U>,</U> 816 F. Supp. 281 (1992), federal  judge Nicholas
Politan ruled that the Secretary of Health and  Human 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 54 -->  Services had not articulated a
clear policy against private  contracting; thus, given the discrepancy between
statutory law and  existing case law, physicians remain uncertain as to which
law prevails  and fearful of possible reprisals from bureaucrats at HCFA who 
periodically threaten sanctions.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Congress should end this confusion, stop HCFA's  bureaucratic threats, and
protect the right of private contract and the integrity  of the doctor-patient
relationship.

<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> True portability comes only from owning your own  insurance
policy, much as you own your own life, auto, or homeowner's  insurance policy.
Under employer-based insurance, the  employer, not the employee, owns the
policy. Therefore, when a  worker changes his job or loses his job, he can't
take the policy with  him. Insurance regulation, while mitigating the
circumstances of  job changes or transfers, cannot establish personal ownership
of  health insurance policies. That is why insurance reforms can only 
approximate portability, a pale imitation of the real thing. Only  reforming the
tax code can change this arrangement, giving the  individual direct tax relief
for the purchase of insurance and  enabling the consumer to purchase his own
policy and keep it, regardless  of where he works.

<P>The health care system cannot be reformed unless you reform  the market for
health insurance, and the market for health  insurance cannot be reformed unless
you reform the tax treatment of  health insurance. The federal tax code
profoundly shapes and drives  the current system, distorts the health care
market, and frustrates  the market forces of consumer choice and competition.
The states  can change insurance regulation; they can change the rules 
governing the licensing of doctors and hospitals or other medical  providers;
but they cannot change the federal tax code, and thus alter the  basic dynamics
of the health care system. Unfortunately, too  many state health care reform
measures make matters worse by  adding even more mandates and imposing price
controls on doctors  and hospitals, further frustrating the market forces of
consumer  choice and competition.

<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> In spite of the partisan rhetoric, both the White House and 
Congress know that it is not mathematically possible to balance  the federal
budget without also slowing the growth in Medicare  spending. But even if the
federal budget were balanced, the current  level of Medicare spending  now
almost 11 percent per year   cannot be sustained. It inevitably will impose huge
tax increases on  working Americans or drain federal funding from other vital 
government programs. Writing in the prestigious 
<I>New England Journal of 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 56 -->  Medicine</I> in 1992, President
Clinton himself said that the  current and projected level of Medicare spending
was &quot;unacceptable.&quot;   Curiously, the congressional proposal to reduce
Medicare  spending to roughly twice the rate of inflation is similar to the 
proposal advanced by the President in 1993, when neither the federal  budget nor
the solvency of the Medicare trust fund was a pressing  issue for the White
House and the President was proposing to  use the savings from Medicare to
finance the Administration's  health care plan. A noteworthy difference is that
all of the Medicare  savings under the congressional plan would be plowed back 
into Medicare itself. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Why, then, was there such a huge gap between the $128  billion the
White House plan proposed to save in Medicare and the  $270 billion proposed by
Congress? 
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> There wasn't. The President's plan used its own rosy OMB 
assumptions of baseline expenditures (that is, under current  law). Because OMB
assumed a slower growth in Medicare spending,  the President had to cut less to
reach virtually the same actual  spending levels. Congress used the bipartisan
Congressional  Budget Office baseline, and so needed to save $270 billion over 
seven years. If one uses different baselines, one gets different  results. When
one uses the same baseline, the difference between  the White House and
congressional figures shrinks dramatically.  Using the CBO baseline, the White
House savings of $128  billion balloon into $192 billion, a difference with
Congress of $78  billion over seven years, or a little more that $11 billion a
year.  Taking premium charges into account, a Heritage Foundation analysis  of
the two proposals indicates that the real gap between the  White House and
Congress would be only $20.7 billion in spending  over 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 57 -->  seven years, or about one percent
of current Medicare  outlays.<A HREF="ftnt10.htm#56">56</A> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The appearance of a large gap thus is based on the use of  different
baselines in the same media reports on the competing plans. It's  as if the
White House says the temperature today is 0 degrees  Celsius but Congress says
it is 32 degrees Fahrenheit, and so seems to  create an unbridgeable 32 degree
difference. Mixing OMB and  CBO baselines is tantamount to mixing Celsius and
Fahrenheit  measures of temperature, and is equally misleading. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Why do conservatives want to push the elderly all into  managed care?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> There is no plan to do so. The congressional Medicare  reform
plan does make managed care an option, but it also enables  the elderly to
choose other options, including fee-for-service plans  or medical savings
accounts, as well as traditional Medicare. In  any case, the Congressional
Budget Office, in examining the  likelihood of enrollment changes, estimated
that about 24 percent of  Medicare beneficiaries would belong to HMOs in 2002,
an increase  of about 10 percent.<A HREF="ftnt10.htm#57">57</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Why raise Medicare premiums to pay for a tax cut for  wealthy
Americans?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> The Supplemental Medical Insurance (SMI) premiums paid  by
beneficiaries do not finance the tax relief provisions in the  Balanced Budget
Act of 1995. The Balanced Budget Act sought  to maintain the calendar year 1995
ratio of SMI premium  collections to program costs at 31.5 percent. Since
enrollment in the SMI  program is voluntary, an increase in premiums is not a
tax increase  on 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 58 -->  those who choose to take
advantage of a taxpayer subsidy.  The premium  $42.50 per month as of January 1,
1996  is  equivalent to just 25 percent of the actual cost of the Part B
program.  The remaining 75 percent is paid for by taxpayers out of the  general
revenue fund. When Congress established Medicare Part B  in 1966, it created a
taxpayer subsidy for the premiums paid by  the nation's elderly, setting it at
50 percent of the program's cost.  As you can see, Congress created a subsidy
for the nation's  elderly, but at a significantly lower rate than is currently
the case. It  is ironic that most of the uninsured workers in America are forced
 to subsidize health care for the elderly through the mandatory  Medicare
payroll tax.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Haven't we heard before that the Medicare system is bankrupt?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Yes, you have. The Medicare Board of Trustees have  been warning
Congress for years that the Hospital Insurance (HI, or  Part A) Trust Fund will
be exhausted by the year 2002. During both  the Reagan and Bush Administrations,
Congress was told  repeatedly that corrective action was necessary to avoid huge
tax increases  on working families or a reduction in benefits of similar 
proportions. Congress chose to ignore these warnings. For example, 
Representative Sam Gibbons (D-FL), former Chairman of the House  Ways and Means
Committee, which has jurisdiction over Medicare,  says the insolvency issue is
greatly exaggerated: &quot;I've read these  trustees' reports for years. They're
all pessimistic. I don't panic  over the insolvency question.&quot;<A
HREF="ftnt10.htm#58">58</A>  Even President Clinton 
acknowledged the impending crisis in an address to a joint session of  Congress,
seeking to maintain the 1995 calendar year ratio of premium  collections to
program outlays with a 27 percent  ceiling.<A
HREF="ftnt10.htm#59">59</A>  While the 27 percent ceiling
perpetuates a generous taxpayer subsidy to  the 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 59 -->  elderly, it is a modest
improvement over current law.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Why do Republicans want to force senior citizens into  Health
Maintenance Organizations (HMOs)?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Republicans do not want to force senior citizens into  HMOs. The
Medicare reform proposal contained within the Balanced  Budget Act of 1995
assumes that the elderly should be allowed to  enroll in a plan with health
services and benefits that they  choose, not just one with options prescribed by
bureaucrats or politicians. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> Similar to the Federal Employees Health Benefits  Program (FEHBP), which
covers approximately 1.6 million retired  federal workers, including former
Members of Congress, the  congressional proposal expands the opportunities for
individual  choice. Enrollees would be able to choose either traditional
Medicare or  a private plan in the MedicarePlus program. For an enrollee  who
chose to enroll in MedicarePlus, the choices available would  include a private
fee-for-service plan, a union plan, a  Taft-Hartley plan, a managed care option
(HMO, PPO, etc.), a  high-deductible policy combined with a medical savings
account (MSA), or a  plan offered through a church or an association such as the
 American Association of Retired Persons (AARP).
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Aren't I entitled to every penny that I paid into Medicare?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Absolutely. Many elderly Americans wrongly assume they  are
getting back what they paid into the system. However, many  seniors are getting
back much more than they contributed,  assuming they contributed at all. The
Medicare health benefit package  offered in future years will be worth more than
the current  program, 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 60 -->  which is much more valuable than
the one offered in past  years.<A HREF="ftnt10.htm#60">60</A>
 Since Medicare benefits are open-ended by design, their value  has risen
consistently over time. The average benefit (Parts A and  B) per enrollee was
worth approximately $4,800 in 1995.  According to the Health Care Financing
Administration (HCFA), which  oversees and administers Medicare, spending is
expected to  continue rising at such a rapid pace that the total expected value
of  Medicare benefits for a couple retiring at age 65 in 1995 is  over $185,000.<A
HREF="ftnt10.htm#61">61</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Furthermore, an overwhelming majority of the workforce  supporting the
current system is scheduled to retire beginning in  2010. The approximate ratio
of workers to people 65 or over is 4:7;  by the year 2030, only two workers will
be supporting each  beneficiary. Given the trust funds' inadequate reserves and
weak  financing structure, unless reforms are instituted, workers will  face
higher taxes to finance the subsidy enjoyed by current  beneficiaries.

<a name="ISSUES">

<P><b>THE ISSUES</b>
<P>
<P>Immigration has re-emerged as one of the nation's more 
controversial political issues. In 1994, California's Proposition 187, 
designed to deny welfare benefits to illegal immigrants, received 
a resounding 59 percent of the vote, and a special Commission 
on Immigration Reform issued a report supporting a national 
computerized registration system for all workers to help enforce 
laws against the employment of illegal aliens. Legislation to 
strengthen law enforcement against illegal immigration and restrict the 
quota of legal immigrants is being considered in Congress. 
Candidates for public office in 1996 are very likely to be asked to take a 
position on immigration issues.
<P>
<P>One reason for this concern is the widespread impression that 
immigrants who come to America to take advantage of welfare 
contribute to the urban crime rate. Immigration has been 
increasing, and many people worry that recent immigrants are changing 
the face of America ethnically, culturally, and politically. 
Immigration from European countries is much smaller than in earlier 
years, while Hispanic and Asian immigration is much greater.
<P>
<P>Not only is the number of new immigrants under current law at 
an all-time high, but the concentration of these new Americans in 
five 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 2 -->

states -- California, Florida, Illinois, Texas, and New York --  
significantly magnifies their impact on local government 
services, including schools, emergency medical care, and welfare.
<P>
<P>The changing skills of immigrants also raise concerns. The 
proportion of highly skilled immigrants has declined in the past decade 
as the proportion of immigrants sponsored by close family 
members has increased. Refugees from political repression or ethnic 
persecution often arrive in this country without skills or other 
 resources and automatically are placed on welfare.
<P>
<P>Illegal immigration is a particularly sensitive issue for 
many Americans, one that prompts them to worry about the price 
society pays for an &quot;open door&quot; policy. Illegal immigration involves 
not only people who sneak across the U.S. border, but also those 
who come as tourists or students and decide to stay. In 1986, legal 
sanctions were imposed on employers who hire unlawful 
immigrants, but they have been difficult to enforce because identification 
documents are easily forged. Legislation pending in Congress 
would create a national identification card for every 
American,<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#1">1</a> but this worries many who feel that a national identification card would 
be a dangerous intrusion by government.
<P>
<P>Opinions about the merits of America's current immigration 
policy are sharply divided. Those who believe immigrants should be 
welcomed argue that the cultural and economic contributions of 
immigrants are part of America's historical tradition and that the 
economic benefits from more workers and people who start 
businesses and pay taxes far exceed any social 
costs.<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#2">2</a>  Those who think the demographic change is too great, on the other hand, note that 
current levels of immigration will cause Americans from the 
Euro
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 3 -->

pean ethnic groups that dominated this country for most of its 
history to become a minority of the population the middle of the 
21st century.<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#3">3</a>
<P>
<P>But this is not just a political numbers game. It is an intensely 
personal issue for millions of Americans whose close family ties 
or business interests are regulated by the immigration law. 
Reuniting families is a primary goal of U.S. immigration law, and 
businesses in the rapidly growing high technology sectors of the 
U.S. economy, as well as American corporations with a 
multinational workforce, want the freedom to bring foreign-born employees 
and their families into the United States without excessive red tape.
<P>
<P>Most current immigration to the United States cannot be 
justified as bringing some general economic benefit to other Americans, 
but neither can it be attacked as an economic drain. Though 
national statistics do not clearly show any particular economic costs or 
benefits to the country as a whole,<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#4">4</a> the family members and 
employers who sponsor immigrants believe very strongly in the 
economic contributions of the individuals they 
know.<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#5">5</a>
<P>
<P>The abstract question  whether there is too much 
immigration today  tends to dominate the debate (along with the problem 
of illegal immigration). But the issue is hard to resolve. For 
those people directly affected, the concern is whether the 
government will permit a particular, valuable<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#6">6</a> person to live and work in 
the United States. For other Americans, the issues are less 
clear-cut. Candidates must be prepared to help their constituents 
resolve them.
<a name="FACTS"><P>
<P><B>THE FACTS

<P>
<P>Immigrants and Welfare</B>
<P>
<P>The generous welfare benefits provided by most states and 
the federal government are intended to help individuals and families 
in need. Many people take advantage of the this system to avoid 
assuming their family responsibilities and performing work. It 
certainly seems plausible that people from impoverished 
countries would want to come to the United States because of the 
higher standard of living, as well as to assume that many would come 
to be on welfare, since welfare benefits in the United States 
are higher than the incomes of most people in less developed 
countries. But there is no evidence that large numbers of working 
age immigrants come to America to go on the dole. 
<ul><P>
<li><P>The labor force participation rate among male immigrants is 
77 percent -- slightly higher than among native-born Americans 
(74 percent), according to the 1990 census. The highest labor 
force participation rate, 83 percent, is among Hispanic immigrants. 
<P>
<li>The median age for legal immigrants in 1993 was 28, 
slightly younger than the average American's age of 33. More than 80 
percent of immigrants arrive before age 45, and only about 
5 percent arrive after retirement age to join family 
members.<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#7">7</a>
</ul><P>
<P>Newly arrived immigrants, &quot;legal permanent residents,&quot; 
generally are prevented from receiving welfare. They cannot receive 
most direct aid during their first three years<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#8">8</a> in the country 
because their sponsors' income is counted as their own during this 
period in determining eligibility. They also can be deported as a 
public 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 5 -->

charge if they use public benefits during their first five years in 
the country. Elderly immigrants, however, who typically are 
sponsored by their children, are able to take advantage of the 
Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program after five years. 
Their sponsors' financial responsibility ends, and SSI is an 
entitlement for those with a low income after age 65.
<P>
<P>The Immigration Reform Act of 1986, which established 
procedures to legalize immigrants, barred those taking advantage of 
the amnesty from receiving public benefits for five years. After 
that, they can receive welfare. Undocumented aliens are not eligible 
for most public assistance, except for emergency medical 
treatment under Medicaid and nutrition benefits under the Women, 
Infants, and Children (WIC) program. The states were mandated by 
the 1986 immigration law to establish a computerized system, the 
Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements (SAVE), to screen 
the immigration status of non-citizen applicants for Aid to 
Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) and other federal benefit 
programs.<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#9">9</a>
<P>
<P>A recent study of welfare participation over a whole lifetime 
by immigrant families, based on the years they arrived in the 
United States, shows a trend toward increasing use of welfare among 
immigrants in recent decades.<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#10">10</a>

<P>This trend in lifetime welfare outlays for the foreign born is 
explained by the demographic pattern of recent immigration 
rather than by a growing tendency among immigrants in general, most 
of whom are young men, to go on welfare. More elderly 
immigrants have a higher lifetime dependence on welfare benefits for 
elderly people than the native born because they have fewer resources 
in the form of Social Security, private pensions, and 
accumulated savings. In addition, the number of refugees and political 
asylum seekers coming to the United States has increased since the 
1960s, and this category of immigrants is eligible for welfare 
immediately upon arrival.
<P>
<P>Still, it is important to keep this in proportion:
<P>
<P><B>Elderly Immigrants </B>
<ul><P>
<li><P>Elderly immigrants show up on the welfare rolls in greater 
numbers than younger immigrants, or the native born. But 
immigrants over age 65 who have lived in the U.S. for at least 20 years 
are only slightly more likely to receive welfare than elderly 
natives 

(8.7 percent versus 6.9 percent). 
<P>
<li><P>Most native born recipients receive other retirement income, 
including Social Security, that is not counted as welfare. But 
Supplemental Security Income (SSI) is available when other sources 
of income are small. For most of the elderly immigrants on SSI, 
their monthly check is their only source of 
income.<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#11">11</a> 
<P>
<li><P>In 1982, there were 127,900 non-citizens receiving SSI. In 
1992, this number had increased to 601,000, equal to about 11 percent 
of the total elderly poor. It continues to increase rapidly: By 1994, 
it had climbed to 738,000.<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#12">12</a>  SSI recipients also qualify for 
Medicaid, food stamps, and local welfare services.
<P></ul>
<P>Most non-citizens on SSI have relatives able to support them. 
Support is a condition of sponsorship for immigration, but after 
five years is no longer mandatory. After five years as a legal 
permanent resident, an immigrant can become a naturalized citizen, and 
no restrictions on welfare eligibility apply. Significant changes in 
the federal means-tested welfare standards were included in the 
Balanced Budget Act of 1995.<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#13">13</a>  Welfare benefits for refugees 
and other &quot;qualified aliens&quot; would have ended after five years. 
The income of a sponsor would have been used to calculate 
eligibility for SSI and other means-tested entitlements, without a three- 
or five-year limit. The legislation also would have required all 
non-citizens to reapply for benefits, with the incomes of their 
sponsors to be used in the recalculation of eligibility. But even this 
regulation ends if the elderly immigrant qualifies for citizenship.

<P><B>Immigrants and Crime
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 8 -->

</B>
<P>
<P>Ethnic communities with a high proportion of immigrants 
typically are located in the inner city, where higher crime rates are 
common. The issue: Do immigrants cause crime, or do they simply tend 
to live in high crime-areas?  The notion that higher immigration 
rates and higher crime rates are causally related cannot be dismissed 
out of hand. In every ethnic group, young males commit most of 
the crime, and immigrants are predominantly young males  
particularly illegal immigrants. In the United States, moreover, 
economic opportunity often depends on education and cultural 
advantages that immigrants from poor countries do not possess. 
<P>
<P>Many Americans assume this makes immigrants more inclined 
to commit crimes. But it is wrong to assume that educational 
disadvantages and other factors mean that immigrants are more likely 
to be involved in crime than native born Americans.
<P>
<ul>
<P><li>For the nation as a whole, the number of non-citizens in prison 
is approximately the same proportion as the number from the 
general population.
<P>
<P><li>Of the five states with the largest proportion of alien prisoners 
in 1992  California, New York, Florida, Illinois, and Texas  
only New York had a greater share of non-citizens in its prisons than 
in the general population.

<P>
<P>The federal prison system has a much greater proportion of 
non-citizens (not necessarily immigrants) in custody than the state 
prisons, with approximately 25 percent. One reason for this is 
that federal law enforcement tends to concentrate on different kinds 
of crime, such as drug smuggling, in which foreigners on tourist 
or business visas are caught entering and leaving the United 
States. Federal prison statistics tell us nothing about criminality 
among immigrants. Among the non-citizens in federal prison, 80 
percent were convicted for crimes related to the war on drugs, 
including former Panama dictator Manuel Noriega.<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#14">14</a> 
<P>
<P>The ethnic groups represented among non-citizen prisoners 
also have no significant correlation with the size of those 
immigrant groups in the general population. If immigration in general were 
a source of crime, we would expect to find a higher statistical 
correlation between members of specific ethnic groups in the 
prison population and their share of the general population.
<P>
<P><B>The Burden on State and Local Governments</B>
<P>
<P>Immigration policy, including the control of borders to halt 
illegal immigration, is a responsibility of the federal government. 
But state and local governments have to support public schools, 
hospitals, emergency rescue, police and fire departments, and other 
services for immigrant communities -- including many illegals 
who 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 11 -->

live and hide among the much larger legal foreign born 
population. Thus, if the federal government fails to secure America's 
borders, the states pick up the tab for illegals who receive services. 
The federal government clearly has failed to control the Mexican 
border. Moreover, the President and Congress annually set the 
quota for refugees, who are entitled to federal and local welfare 
benefits. The flood of political asylum seekers and foreign visitors 
who overstay their visa periods and melt into the population as 
illegal immigrants is entirely the result of Washington's failure to 
discharge its responsibility.
<P>
<P>Federal law requires state and local governments to provide 
public schooling<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#15">15</a> and emergency medical care for illegal 
immigrants. States have grown increasingly angry in recent years at what 
they see as an unfair financial burden placed on them by a federal 
government that is unwilling to enforce its immigration 
laws. California's Proposition 187 and other measures to deny state 
and local government services to illegal immigrants are prompted 
by the rising cost of services paid for by state 
taxpayers.<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#16">16</a> 
<P>
<P>The governors of the most heavily affected states have 
demanded federal reimbursement of the estimated costs imposed by 
illegal immigration on their state and local governments. In 
Washington, this argument is made in support of legislation to strengthen 
federal immigration controls, particularly at the Mexican border, 
to stop illegal crossing.
<P>
<P>In the Balanced Budget Act of 1995, Congress for the first 
time voted to eliminate one unfunded mandate (for emergency 
medical care, including childbirth, provided to illegal aliens) by 
authorizing a supplemental allotment of federal money to reimburse 
states. 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 12 -->

The Act also explicitly disqualified payments for 
non-emergency medical care for illegal aliens under the Medicaid program. 
To comply with the rules and obtain federal money, medical 
providers would have had to determine the immigration status of 
patients, which they do not now do.<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#17">17</a>  The legislation was vetoed by 
President Clinton.
<P>
<P><B>What is the cost of illegal immigration?</B> Illegal aliens are 
assumed to be a net cost to states. However, while they are 
among the poorest immigrants and pay fewer taxes than legal 
immigrants or the native born, many are employed and do not receive 
services paid for by taxpayers. Thus, figuring the costs that illegal 
immigrants impose on a community, and comparing this with 
benefits to that community from sales tax payments and other 
financial contributions, is no easy task. Illegal immigrants in general 
have more difficulty getting benefits from the welfare system than 
legal residents, and do not identify themselves as illegal if they do. 
As the RAND Corporation has observed, &quot;Congress, state, and 
local policymakers still have no reliable answers to basic 
questions about the costs and benefits of immigration for state and local 
governments, for the economy as a whole, and for the nature 
and speed of integration of new immigrants into U.S. 
society.&quot;<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#18">18</a>
<P>
<P>A review of the econometric studies of the fiscal burden on 
state and local governments from immigration by the RAND 
Corporation found that &quot;there is general agreement that currently 
illegal immigrants contribute less than those who received amnesty, 
who, in turn, contribute less than legal immigrants, who contribute 
less than the native born. However, this finding merely reflects 
differences in the average incomes of these various groups rather 
than their immigration status per se.&quot;<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#19">19</a>
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 13 -->

<P>
<P>In nine different studies<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#20">20</a> examined by the RAND 
Corporation, the available data about the costs of immigration are 
conflicting and inconclusive. &quot;Existing studies of the costs of immigration 
do not provide a reliable or accurate estimate of the net costs and 
benefits of immigration  even wcosts/benefits are defined 
narrowly. Moreover, without reaching consensus on a host of conceptual 
and accounting issues, we doubt that additional studies will shed 
light on these important policy questions.&quot;<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#21">21</a>  This is because they 
use different definitions for immigrants and public assistance, 
and even count tax revenues differently. Estimates of the per 
capita costs of providing federal, state, and local services to 
immigrants ranged from a low of $2,638 to a high of $4,476. The per 
capita revenue estimates varied from $1,051 to $3,644. When the 
costs and benefits were compared in each study, the conclusions were 
as widely apart as a surplus of $1,400 per immigrant to a net cost 
of $1,600.<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#22">22</a>
<P>
<P>RAND's analysis of the six state and local government studies 
of the cost of immigrants found that the methods used to 
calculate costs and benefits tended to include a full list of outlays for 
public services but only a partial list of revenues, including transfer 
payments from higher levels of government. The flawed 
accounting methods showed that neither immigrants nor the native born 
pay their way at the state and local levels. Where estimates were 
made separately for immigrants and the native born, the studies 
found that the &quot;deficit&quot; for immigrants is larger. What the studies 
actually seem to find is only the higher average income, and 
higher taxes paid, by the native born.<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#23">23</a>
<P>
<P>States and local communities with large immigrant 
populations 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 14 -->

probably have a disproportionate concentration among them 
of illegal aliens, who tend to be poorest. Mandates for social 
services and welfare, and lax enforcement by social workers of 
rules against aiding illegal aliens, probably impose a financial burden 
on those state and local governments. Because the federal 
government has failed to prevent the illegal immigration, the argument that 
the federal taxpayer should pay any imposed costs is sensible. But 
the size and nature of the costs of illegal immigration have not 
been clearly established. Moreover, the task of identifying the 
immigration status of almost all poor people in America's ethnic 
communities is one that state and local governments may not want to 
undertake.
<P>
<P><B>Are There Too Many Immigrants?</B>
<P>
<P>Many Americans are concerned that the higher rate of 
immigration to the United States in recent years may be too great for the 
cultural assimilation of so many people. Immigration has been 
increasing, and many commentators are concerned that this is 
changing the culture of America. 
<P>
<P>The assimilation of the foreign born could be a problem if 
their numbers were too great. The question is: Are they too great?
<ul><P>
<li><P>In 1993, more than 904,000 legal immigrants and as many 
as 300,000 illegal immigrants settled permanently in the 
United States. The decade 1981-1990 saw 7.4 million legal 
immigrants, which was almost double the 4.5 million who arrived in 
1971-1980. The decade of greatest immigration to the United States 
was 1901-1910, with 8.8 million new arrivals.

<P>
<li>In every decade between the Civil War and the Depression, 
e than 13 percent of the U.S. population; 
today, they are approximately 8 percent. 
</ul>
<P>The principal concern about legal immigration is that the rate 
is increasing every decade, and the current immigration rate plus 
the birth rate among the groups that are arriving in this country 
is higher than the birth rate for other Americans. 
<P>
<P>During the 1980s, immigration contributed 37.1 percent of 
the growth in the U.S. population. In the 1970s, it contributed 
32.6 percent.<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#24">24</a>  In 1990, immigrant women aged 35 to 44 had 
given birth to an average of 2.2 children, compared with 1.9 
children among native born women in that age group. The fertility 
concern is amplified by the fact that a greater percentage of 
immigrants than of native-born Americans are of reproductive 
age.<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#25">25</a>
<P>
<P>Although the proportion of immigrants in American society 
today is relatively low, and the numbers that come to the United 
States every year are well within historical levels, the demographic 
trend today will produce higher and higher proportions of immigrants 
in the general population. 
<P>
<P>By the year 2050, the proportion of immigrants in the 
general population will rise to approximately the same level as in the 
six decades following the Civil War (over 13 percent). But 
because the population of the United States has increased, and will 
continue to grow, the number of immigrants living in the 
United States by the middle of the next century will be about six 
times greater than in the earlier period.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 16 -->

<P>
<P>Another important demographic trend that concerns opponents 
of more immigration is the very significant increase in 
immigration from Asia and Latin America.
<P><ul>
<li><P>In 1981-1990, 37.3 percent of immigrants were from Asia, 
22.6 percent were from Mexico, and 18 percent were from other 
Latin American countries. The great wave of immigration to the 
United States after the Civil War was mostly from Europe and 
essentially Caucasian. But a large proportion of the late 19th century 
immigrants were from the very poor regions of southern and 
eastern Europe and were very different culturally from those who 
originally settled the United States.
<P>
<li>The demographic projection of population growth represented 
by immigrants and the children of immigrants shows that by 
the middle of the next century, Asian or Hispanic immigrants and 
their immediate children will account for roughly a quarter of 
the American population.<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#26">26</a>  The population as a whole will 
change from today's proportions of 3 percent Asian, 9 percent 
Hispanic, 11 percent non-Hispanic black, and 77 percent non-Hispanic 
white to approximately 9 percent Asian, 13 percent non-Hispanic 
black, 19 percent Hispanic, and 59 percent non-Hispanic 
white.<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#27">27</a>  These estimates do not account for changes that would result from 
intermarriage among members of these groups.
<P></ul>
<P>The concern that opponents of current immigration policy 
feel about too many immigrants in the next century is exacerbated 
by the tendency of immigrants to move into their own ethnically 
homogeneous communities. More than 90 percent of 
immigrants move into cities and live in highly visible ethnic enclaves. 
The increased visibility of Hispanic and Asian communities 
reinforces 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 17 -->

the issue, just as the ghettos of Irish and Jewish immigrants in 
the last century and black Americans from the rural South after 
World War I aroused concern. The immigrant population is much 
more concentrated in Southern California, Texas, New York, and 
Miami than in the rest of the country. 
<P>
<P> Just 12 metropolitan areas received 55 percent of new 
immigrants in 1993. One in every three new immigrants now settles in 
California. Of these, 3 in 5 choose to live in the Los Angeles 
metropolitan area. Los Angeles is now 40 percent foreign 
born.<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#28">28</a>
<P>
<P>The question is whether the current U.S. trend is 
toward balkanization or a melting pot. Do large concentrations of 
immigrants living in their own communities, near others with 
similar backgrounds and cultural practices, resist Americanization 
and sustain a separate loyalty to a minority group?  It is easier for 
large ethnic community to use a non-English language outside the 
home, and public schools can be forced to offer bilingual education. 
Assimilation into a more uniform American culture would seem 
less likely to occur, but the evidence actually indicates that urban 
concentrations of immigrants, particularly from countries from 
which large numbers have come, are more likely to become 
naturalized citizens.<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#29">29</a>
<P>
<P>For example, in the mid-18th century, Benjamin Franklin 
complained: &quot;Why should Pennsylvania, founded by the English, 
become a colony of <I>aliens</I>, who will shortly be so numerous as 
to Germanize us instead of Anglifying them, and will never adopt 
our Language or Customs any more than they can acquire our 
complexion.&quot;<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#30">30</a>  But he was wrong. In New York and Chicago for 
example, the concentrations of Yiddish-speaking immigrants so 
char
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 18 -->

acteristic in the earlier period have disappeared.
<P>
<P>Opponents of current U.S. immigration policy maintain that 
assimilation of so many from the last great wave of 
immigration, which ended in the 1920s, was possible because (1) almost all 
immigrants came from Europe, and many from 
English-speaking countries; (2) the influx was stopped for a period of time to 
permit the assimilation of the immigrant minorities into the 
dominant American culture; and (3) the birth rate among the native 
born population was significantly higher than it is today. Only 27.8 
percent of the growth in the U.S. population came from 
immigration during the 1901-1910 peak period, compared with 37.1 percent 
in the 1980s.<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#31">31</a>
<P><ul>
<li><P>But the current rate of assimilation is very rapid. Research on 
immigrants to Southern California that looks at the age cohorts 
of recent immigrants has found very rapid increases in English 
language proficiency, naturalization rates, occupational mobility, 
self-employment, and income, in addition to significantly reduced 
poverty rates.<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#32">32</a>
<P>
<li>In Southern California, &quot;all immigrant children showed a 
tremendous rate of increase in English ability, though the trend was 
especially marked among Latinos.&quot;<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#33">33</a>
<P>
<li>By looking at age cohorts of Latino immigrants who arrived 
in California in the 1970s, demographers can see that poverty 
actually declined from 25.7 percent to 15.7 percent as the 
15-to-25-year-old arrivals matured and became 
assimilated.<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#34">34</a>
</ul><P>
<P><b>Should population patterns be changed?</b> Author Peter Brimelow, 
in 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 19 -->

his recent book<I> Alien Nation</I>, points out that the 1965 
immigration law, which opened the doors to higher rates of immigration 
from Asia and Latin America, was passed by Congress with the 
understanding that it would <I>not</I> change America's historical 
population patterns.<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#35">35</a>  Since the law has caused such a demographic 
change, however, particularly as the 1986 amnesty for illegal aliens 
has further shifted the family reunification preferences in favor of 
very recent immigrants from Asia and Latin America, he argues that 
the pattern of immigration must be corrected.
<P>
<P>This raises both political and non-political questions about 
what immigration policy the United States should adopt. From a 
political standpoint: 
<ul><P>
<li>The American people as a whole do not get to choose the 
nation's future demographic profile. But on their behalf, Congress does 
set immigration quotas, and these can be written to discriminate 
either for or against people. 
<P>
<li>The federal government has a constitutional responsibility to 
control the national borders, and the requirement that foreigners 
entering the country must have a visa and submit to customs 
inspection is important in maintaining that control. 
<P>
<li>The federal government sets requirements on individuals 
wishing to live permanently in the United States: extensive 
documentation of good character, sponsorship for immigration, and financial 
responsibility. Additional requirements involving financial 
responsibility, English language proficiency, or ethnicity could be 
added by Congress. 

<P>
<li>Both the size of immigration quotas and the categories of 
people who qualify were set in the 1990 Immigration Act and may 
be amended in 1996. But determining whether to increase or 
decrease immigration quotas will have a very small effect on the 
long-term demographic profile of the country.
</ul>
<P>The non-political considerations of immigration policy affect 
the nation's demographic patterns. Within the quota system, 
individual families and employers control the decisions over who 
can immigrate to America by virtue of their power to sponsor 
those individuals. Particular families or employers generally choose 
to sponsor immigrants for very personal or economic reasons, 
and there often is a long waiting period before an immigration visa 
is granted. The question is whether this choice should remain 
essentially personal or should be regarded as a significant public 
interest that requires more political control.
<P>
<P><B>The Immigration Law</B>
<P>
<P>The Immigration and Nationality Act establishes the rules 
and quotas for immigration to the United States.<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#36">36</a>  The visas issued 
to immigrants allow them to become permanent residents. The 
law provides that after five years, and after fulfilling a requirement 
to show some knowledge of American history, permanent 
residents may become naturalized citizens of the United States. Prior 
to 1965, specific quotas favoring predominantly European 
countries were enforced. In 1965, Congress repealed this system of 
quotas and established a worldwide quota for immigration, with a 
limit per country. This major change in U.S. immigration law put 
the priority on family unification  individual Americans 
sponsoring relatives to come here.<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#37">37</a>  The law fundamentally changed the

phasis from specific nationalities and opened the process 
much more widely to immigrants from Asia. Spouses and most 
children of American citizens are exempt from the quota system, 
while other relatives are given priority over foreigners with no 
American relatives.
<P>
<P>The quota system, with its &quot;preference categories,&quot; is an 
extremely complex area of immigration law. Combined with the limits 
on immigration from individual countries, the preference system 
requires some immigrants to wait many years after applying for 
U.S. permission before receiving it. Immigrants from other 
countries, however, are not subjected to such prolonged delays. The 
quota preference system also includes categories for occupations 
and skills, but these have much smaller quotas and are ranked lower 
in the preference categories.
<P>
<P>The quota system and its preferences were revised by the 
1990 immigration law, but the family unification priority was 
not changed. Current law provides for up to 675,000 immigrants 
annually. Of these, 480,000 (71 percent) are sponsored by relatives 
in the United States, and another 140,000 (21 percent) are 
&quot;economic&quot; immigrants whose acceptance is determined on the 
basis of skills, education, or willingness to invest and create jobs. A 
special preference category was created for &quot;diversity&quot; 
immigration, allowing 55,000, or 8 percent of the total, from countries 
where immigration was lowest in prior years. This provision is 
intended to ease immigration from Ireland and other European countries.
<P>
<P><b>Refugees.</b> The Refugee Act of 1980<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#38">38</a> provides general 
authority for the admission of refugees, who were removed as a 
category under the quota preference system. The number that will come 
to 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 22 -->

the United States annually is determined by the President in 
consultation with Congress, and there are procedures for 
admitting larger numbers in emergency situations, such as the Haitian 
and Cuban boatlifts. In 1993, 119,482 refugees were admitted.
<P>
<P>Political asylum is granted on a case-by-case basis to aliens 
who meet the definition of refugee but already are in the United 
States or at the border. The requirement for case-by-case 
determinations is a significant administrative burden for the Immigration 
and Naturalization Service (INS). In 1993, there were 150,386 
applications for asylum, and the backlog of cases had reached 
333,000. While waiting for the INS to schedule a hearing for political 
asylum, these individuals generally are allowed free movement 
within the country, and a large number disappear and become 
illegal aliens.
<P>
<P><b>Illegal Immigrants.</b> The Immigration Reform and Control Act 
of 1986 (IRCA)<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#39">39</a> was enacted to control illegal immigration. 
The intent of the law was to focus on the motives of illegal 
immigrants, who come to the United States and get jobs that offer better 
wages and working conditions than they can find in their native 
lands. The principal change in the law prohibiting employment of 
illegal immigrants, however, was to make the employer guilty of 
breaking the immigration law as well. To cut off the job 
opportunities being sought by illegal immigrants, employers were made 
responsible for enforcement. All job applicants must prove their 
citizenship or legal residence to their potential employers by 
completing an INS form (I-9) before they can begin work. The employer 
must verify this information and keep the documents with other 
personnel records. IRCA imposed both civil fines as high as $10,000 
on employers who hire illegal aliens and criminal penalties for a 
re

peated pattern of violations.
<P>
<P>Because it was known that millions of illegal aliens already 
were living and working in this country, the Congress established 
procedures by which they could apply for legal resident status. By 
1988, more than 3 million people had applied for &quot;legalization&quot; 
under the 1986 law. These legalized immigrants in turn have provided 
a newly enlarged pool of families that are seeking to sponsor 
other relatives for immigration.
<P>
<P><b>Citizenship.</b> A legal permanent resident in the United States 
may apply for citizenship after five years. The Immigration and 
Nationality Act sets out a number of specific requirements for 
becoming a naturalized citizen: a test of the applicant's knowledge of 
U.S. history and the Constitution, proficiency in the English 
language, and an oath renouncing all allegiance to foreign governments 
and swearing loyalty to the United States and a willingness to 
defend it. Congress also could enact additional financial 
responsibility requirements.
<P>
<P><B>The Problem of Illegal Immigration</B>
<P>
<P>There were an estimated 3.2 million illegal aliens in the 
United States as of October 1992, according to the 
INS.<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#40">40</a>  The number of illegal residents is estimated to be growing by 300,000 per year.

<P>
<ul>
<li>Fifty-five percent of the illegal immigrants in the United States 

are estimated to be Mexican. Another 22 percent come from 
Central America. 
<P>
<li>Although Mexicans comprise about 90 percent of those 
apprehended at the southern U.S. border, one survey found they 
were joined by representatives of 70 other 
nationalities.<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#41">41</a>
</ul><P>In addition to crossing the border illegally, many violators of 
the law just stay in the United States after their non-immigrant 
visas expire. 
<P><UL>
<p><li>In 1993, there were 21 million visas issued to 
non-immigrants, including 17 million tourists and almost 3 million business 
visitors; 165,000 temporary foreign workers and 257,000 foreign 
students also were admitted. In addition, foreign journalists, 
foreign government officials, and the families of persons working for 
international organizations come to the United States freely. 
<P>
<li>During the 1986 fiscal year, the INS apprehended 1.8 million 
illegal entrants. Of these, 243,000 had overstayed their 
visas.<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#42">42</a> 
</UL><P>
<P>These statistics do not provide a good picture of the extent of 
the problem, however, because most illegal immigrants who enter 
the United States with a valid tourist or student visa are not 
identified unless stopped by the police for some reason.
<P>
<P>Illegal immigration is a serious problem that law enforcement 
has not been able to control. The shortage of border patrol officers 
and adequate physical barriers along the U.S.-Mexico border has 
been widely cited as a large factor in the problem, and improved 
enforcement at key locations in California, Texas, Arizona, and 
New Mexico certainly should be undertaken to curb illegal 
crossings. But the larger problem would not be solved by those 
measures alone, because illegal entry is only one source of illegal 
immigration. The problem of individuals misusing tourist visas also 
must be addressed. 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 25 -->

<P>
<P><B>Identification Cards</B>
<P>
<P>Employer sanctions under IRCA have failed to reduce illegal 
immigration and may have increased racial or ethnic 
discrimination in the workplace.<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#43">43</a>  Employers who suspect a job applicant 
may not possess legitimate credentials for legal residence or 
citizenship face a difficult problem. In an effort to solve this problem, 
legislation now before Congress would set up a pilot program 
covering approximately 47 million workers, or almost 40 percent of 
the workforce, to test a computerized national worker 
identification system.<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#44">44</a>  In theory, if an employer needed to verify the right of 
a job applicant to work, he could make a telephone call and obtain 
a verification number, just as businesses now do to verify 
credit cards and checks. This would be the employer's defense 
against any subsequent discovery that the new employee was in fact 
an illegal alien.
<P>
<P>Unfortunately, this idea is both impractical and potentially 
dangerous. It would solve a problem caused by less than 1.5 percent 
of the population that is here illegally by dramatically increasing 
government regulation of every American's life. Even the pilot 
program would require over 100 million names and numbers, 
since non-working spouses and children potentially are part of the 
labor force. What ought to be a private contractual arrangement 
between employers and job applicants would become an illegal 
relationship unless the employer first obtained government authorization. 
The danger that such a system would create an underground 
economy with crime and tax evasion is overwhelming. If the 
authorization were denied, for whatever reason  computer data errors, 
bureaucratic mistakes, or even sabotage by a criminal computer hacker 
 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 26 -->

the job applicant would be forcibly unemployed. As the 
logical implications of this system of legal sanctions against 
employers become clearer and more threatening to the civil rights of 
ordinary people, public opposition is likely to increase.
<P>
<P>Most advocates of a computer registry admit that it would 
work only with a secure national identification card. Without such 
positive identification, an employer would have no way to 
determine whether the Social Security number being used actually 
belonged to the job applicant. Senator Alan Simpson (R-WY), sponsor 
of the immigration reform legislation pending in the Senate, has 
described the two functions the worker identification system 
would have: &quot;It must verify that a name corresponds to someone who 
is authorized to work. And then verifying the identity, that the 
person claiming the name and the number is not an impostor. The use of 
a biometric identifier, such as a fingerprint, is needed if this 
function is to perform reliably.&quot;<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#45">45</a>
<P>
<P>Before a national computer system to identify every 
American could be installed, there would have to be significant 
improvement in the data stored in the federal government's computers. 
With approximately 6.5 million Americans changing jobs every year, 
an error rate of just one percent would cause 650,000 innocent 
victims to be denied a job until bureaucrats in Washington could 
be persuaded to correct their mistakes. The Social Security 
Administration has estimated that a national computer registry would 
cost between $3 billion and $6 billion  about 10 to 20 times more 
than its advocates have claimed.<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#46">46</a>
<P>
<P>The proposal for a national computerized worker registration 
system does not address the basic problem of illegal alien 
employ
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 27 -->

ment. Since employers are required to verify the right of job 
applicants to work in the United States today, violations of the law 
may occur because some employers simply ignore it. Advocates of 
the plan are enthusiastic about increasing the number of work site 
inspections for labor law and OSHA violations, along with 
the worker verification. The proposed computer system is an 
expensive, new invasion of every American worker's privacy and 
a threat to law-abiding employers who would have to deal with 
federal inspectors. Employers who violate the law today could 
continue to do so simply by going further underground and 
evading the new computer system.
<P>
<P>Employer sanctions is a misguided concept. The assumption is 
that because an illegal immigrant has broken the law, any 
employer who provides a job is a criminal accomplice. But employers 
are more likely to be the victims of document fraud. A solution to 
the criminal problem of illegal immigration ought to involve less 
government regulation of business, not more. Criminal 
penalties should focus on deterring illegal immigration by punishing 
the criminal, not the rest of the nation.
<a name="RECORD"><P>
<P><B>THE RECORD</B>
<P>
<P>THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION
<P>
<P>The Clinton Administration has emphasized toughening the 
sanctions on employers who hire illegal aliens and increasing the 
number of inspections by the U.S. Department of 
Labor.<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#47">47</a>  In addition, INS funding and personnel increased significantly in FY 1995 
and FY 1996: Increases of 26 percent in budget (to $2.6 billion) 
and 3,200 new full-time employees (to approximately 25,000) 
are 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 28 -->

scheduled. This will include an increase of 1,000 Border 
Patrol agents &quot;on the front lines.&quot;  The budget for FY 1995 was 
increased by 25 percent over the prior year, mostly to finance 
improvements in the agency's computer technology. The INS will spend 
more this year on detention and removal of deportable aliens, 
including people who have been denied political asylum. A detention 
facility operated jointly with the U.S. Marshal Service is being built 
in Batavia, N.Y., and a &quot;triple fencing pilot project&quot; is being 
placed on the border south of San Diego.<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#48">48</a>
<P>
<P>The U.S. Commission on Immigration Reform<A HREF="ftnt11.htm#49">49</a> released its 
interim report to Congress, which addressed illegal immigration, 
in 1994, and a report on legal immigration in 1995. A final 
report covering issues related to immigration will appear in 1997. In 
general, the Commission has supported increased personnel 
and spending to enforce immigration laws at U.S. land borders 
and ports of entry.
<P>
<P>The Commission recommended &quot;development and 
implementation of a simpler, more fraud-resistant system for verifying work 
authorization.&quot;  It endorsed &quot;a computerized registry using data 
provided by the Social Security Administration (SSA) and the INS.&quot; 
 It also called for federal regulation of birth certificates and 
other documents issued by states that establish nationality, as well 
as increased penalties for fraud.
<P>
<P>The Commission supported &quot;in principle&quot; the authorization of 
impact aid to offset the fiscal burdens of unlawful immigration, but 
it wanted further investigation to determine the real costs 
imposed on state and local governments by being required to educate 
illegal immigrant children and provide emergency medical assistance.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 29 -->

<P>
<P>The Commission's report on legal immigration generally 
supported changing the family visa priorities and eliminating them 
for adult children and siblings of American citizens. It proposed 
a change in the classifications of labor skills, the elimination of 
Department of Labor certifications, and the establishment of a 
&quot;labor market test&quot; for workers with college degrees. Employers 
would pay a fee to bring in skilled workers, and the money would be 
used for private-sector education and training of American workers.
<P>
<P><B>THE 104TH CONGRESS</B>
<P>
<P>During the 104th Congress, legislation to crack down on 
illegal immigration and further restrict legal immigration moved 
through committees in both the Senate and House of Representatives. 
At the end of the first session, nothing had been sent to the 
White House. The bills include:
<ul><P>
<li><b>S. 269</b>, the Immigrant Control and Financial Responsibility Act 
of 1995, sponsored by Senator Alan Simpson (R-WY).
<P>
<li><b>S. 1394</b>, the Immigration Reform Act of 1995, sponsored by 
Senator Simpson.
<P>
<li><b>S. 1535</b>, the Illegal Immigration Control and Enforcement 
Act, sponsored by Senator Spencer Abraham (R-MI).
<P>
<li><b>H.R. 2202</b>, the Immigration in the National Interest Act, 
sponsored by Representative Lamar Smith (R-TX).
<P>
<li><b>H.R. 2898</b>, the One Strike and You're Out Illegal 
Immigration 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 30 -->

Act, sponsored by Representative Randy Tate (R-WA).
</ul><P>
<P>Although illegal immigration and the legal immigration quota 
system are distinct issues, they have been combined. There is 
widespread agreement on many of the reforms proposed to control 
illegal immigration, but strong differences about the proposals to 
reduce legal immigration quotas.
<P>
<P>Both the House and Senate bills increase border enforcement 
patrols and authorize expedited hearings for deportation and 
tougher penalties for document fraud. The legislation begins 
implementation of the national computer identification system to enforce 
employer sanctions. Enforcement powers and penalties are 
increased for smuggling of aliens, as are punishment for repeated 
offenses, detention of illegal immigrants pending removal, and 
criminal penalties for failure to depart.
<P>
<P>Both the House and Senate bills contain new restrictions on 
the receipt of public benefits by illegal immigrants and impose 
new requirements for income support on the sponsors of legal 
immigrants. Sponsors will have to demonstrate greater financial 
ability in order to assure that immigrants are less likely to end up on 
welfare. Both the House and Senate bills reduce the number of 
legal immigrants and eliminate whole categories, such as adult 
children, brothers, and sisters. Immigration of parents of U.S. citizens 
would be restricted, and increased financial support requirements 
would be imposed.
<P>
<P>Legislation also has been introduced to make English the 
official language of the federal government. Proficiency in 
understanding simple English is already a requirement for naturalization as a 
U.S. 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 31 -->

citizen, except for elderly, long-time residents. There is a 
growing concern that the United States in danger of becoming a 
multilingual society, with all the social tensions and political problems 
that have occurred in some other officially multilingual nations. 
Bills include:
<P><ul>
<li><b>S. 356</b>, the Language of Government Act, sponsored by 
Senator Richard Shelby (R-AL).
<P>
<li><b>H.R. 739</b>, sponsored by Representative Toby Roth (R-WI), 
and H.R. 1005, sponsored by Representative Peter King 
(R-NY), which provide for English to be the official language of the 
U.S. government and require the INS to apply more strictly the 
English proficiency requirement for naturalization. These bills also 
repeal the Bilingual Education Act. No hearings have been held in 
the House of Representatives.
<P>
</ul>
<P><B>WHAT TO DO IN 1997</B>
<ul>
<P><li><b>Separate the specific issue of illegal immigration control from 
the more general issue of immigration quota reform.</b> 
<P>
<P>The legislation pending in Congress should be divided into 
separate bills dealing with each side of the question separately.
<P>
<li><b>Strengthen enforcement measures at the Mexican border and 
other entry points.</b>
<P>
More personnel, physical barriers, and detention facilities 
are needed, as is added enforcement authority to deter the 
smuggling and document fraud involved in illegal immigration. The 
INS 

should increase the scrutiny of applicants for political asylum 
and decide their cases more rapidly. Political asylees should be 
denied work permits until determined to be eligible for legal 
permanent residence. The political debate about immigration policy in 
the United States is inflamed primarily because of the highly 
publicized, inadequate enforcement along the Mexican border. But 
increased border enforcement may only shift the problem to 
other ports of entry. The equally serious problem of illegal 
immigration by aliens who arrive legally as tourists or on business and 
then decide to stay also has to be met with severe penalties. Other 
ports of entry also are heavily burdened by the abuse of political 
asylum by immigrants who have been advised on how to exploit it.
<P>
<li><B>Make illegal immigration a felony. </B>
<P>
<P>There should be brief but mandatory incarceration for the first 
offense after a deportation order has been granted. In addition, 
anyone convicted of illegal immigration should be denied all 
future admission to the United States after deportation, even as a 
tourist or on business. Illegal immigration to the United States is 
attempted because violators see the costs as low and the rewards 
as very attractive.
<P>
<li><B>Repeal employer sanctions. </B>
<P>
<P>Employers should not have to verify the citizenship or 
immigration status of a prospective employee. Instead, criminal 
penalties and deportation, along with an absolute prohibition against 
ever returning to the United States, should be imposed on those 
who break the U.S. immigration laws. The expensive and 
unworkable computer verification system that eventually would require 
all 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 33 -->

Americans to carry a national identification card and 
surrender personal privacy should not be started. The enforcement of 
laws against illegal immigration should focus on the law breakers, 
not on the entire American population and millions of innocent 
employers.
<P>
<P>The legitimate concern expressed by many business leaders 
that restrictions on legal immigration will seriously impair their 
ability to hire the people they want and maintain a worldwide labor 
force should be addressed with a uniform system of financial 
reassurance, which also could be used by immigrants who might come 
to the United States to establish new businesses or who seek 
employment without first obtaining a U.S. sponsor. The United 
States does not benefit from numerical quotas for the admission of 
immigrants who would come with the financial assets or skills that 
help guarantee their positive contributions to the national economy, 
to the tax base, and to the middle and upper strata of American 
society. 
<P>
<li><B>Place tough and real financial requirements on 
immigrants and their sponsors to reduce immigrant &quot;gaming&quot; of 
welfare, including a financial bond as security.</B>
<P>
<P>Sponsors of immigrants should be required to demonstrate 
sufficient financial ability to prevent any risk of welfare dependency 
by those who come to the United States. Sponsors' income or 
financial support should be deemed to apply to immigrants' 
income status for the entire term of their legal permanent residence in 
the United States. Posting a bond or purchasing other kinds of 
financial assurance to demonstrate that immigrants will not 
become dependent on welfare, particularly SSI and Medicaid, should 
be 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 34 -->

made a formal part of the visa approval process. Applicants 
for naturalized citizenship should be required to demonstrate by 
the same means that they will not become dependent on welfare, 
particularly SSI and Medicaid, in future years.
<P>
<P>The Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program is 
expanding rapidly, and elderly immigrants are a growing proportion of 
the total welfare burden. U.S. immigration policy always has 
included the provision that no one, including the immigrant parents of 
U.S. citizens should be allowed to become a public charge. The 
obligation of a sponsor to guarantee that an immigrant does not become 
a burden to other American taxpayers should be enforced for as 
long as the immigrant is not an American citizen. The opportunity 
to become an American citizen is a privilege extended to the 
legal permanent resident, but it requires the applicant to undertake 
a significant number of duties and obligations. One of these 
obligations should be to prove financial responsibility. A bond or 
insurance policy or other financial indemnity could eliminate the 
attraction of welfare programs to those who might think about 
immigrating to exploit them; it also could recover part of the costs of 
publicly provided welfare and medical benefits if genuine 
misfortune should befall the new citizen or his family.
<P>
<P>Within the framework set by Congress, the Immigration and 
Naturalization Service should be authorized to issue immigration 
visas to any person who meets stringent criteria of good character and 
is able to post a substantial bond or provide other financial 
assurance, subject to forfeiture if any welfare dependency should 
occur. Such a bond or other financial assurance could be remitted if 
the immigrant chose to depart permanently from the United States.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 35 -->

<P>
<li><B>Require proficiency in the English language for all 
immigrants and naturalized citizens. </B>
<P>
<P>The standard for naturalized citizens should be raised to fluency 
in English. Immigrants who are not initially proficient in the 
language should be required to practice and study English, and 
their progress should be tested periodically.
<P>
<P>The concept of American nationality is inextricably linked 
with English as the national language. Every other nation in the world 
is identified with its language, and immigration, to say nothing 
of citizenship, often is simply prohibited to outsiders. 
Americans founded a unique republican form of government in the 18th 
century, based on ideal principles of human rights and limited 
government, and invited immigrants to come and join the new civil 
society. But in 200 years, America has become more than simply 
a republic. It has become a people, and English is its language. 
This in no way precludes the right of Americans to converse in 
another language; nor should it discourage the media from providing 
services in another language. But in the courts, the public 
schools, and the political system, the language should be English. 
Becoming proficient in the language of America is a price that any 
immigrant should want to pay.
</ul><P><a name="Q&A">
<P><B>Q&amp;A</B>
<P>
<P><b>Q. What is the difference between legal and illegal 
immigration, and how big a problem is the whole immigration issue?
<P>
<P>A.</b> Legal immigration is a big part of the American tradition, 
and even though there is almost as much legal immigration now 
as 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 36 -->

there was around the turn of the century, it is only a problem if 
you think there are too many new, legal immigrants. Most legal 
immigrants are family members of American families who want 
to sponsor them and bring them here. Family re-unification is a 
good thing. 
<P>
<P>Illegal immigration is a crime, and we must increase the 
penalties for committing this crime. No other remedy will work.
<P>
<P>People who come into the United States across the Mexican 
or Canadian border, or who come here as students or tourists and 
stay after their visas expire, are criminals. They should be 
tracked down, arrested, and put in jail for at least a year -- then 
deported. They should be forbidden ever to come back to the United 
States, even as tourists or businessmen. 
<P>
<P><b>Q. With generous welfare benefits in this country and 
poverty throughout the rest of the world, don't immigrants come 
to America primarily to go on the dole?
<P>
<P>A.</b> No. Statistics show that working-age immigrants actually 
use welfare benefits and food stamps less than native born 
Americans of working age. The real problem is the immigrant parents of 
U.S. citizens, who get Supplemental Security Income (SSI) if they 
are poor. The laws need to be changed so that if they are sponsored 
to come here by their children, who are U.S. citizens, their 
children will be financially responsible. We have to change the SSI law, 
not the immigration law, to do that.
<P>
<P><b>Q. If legal immigrants to the United States are prevented from 
getting welfare, will they not just take jobs away from native 
born 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 37 -->

Americans?
<P>
<P>A.</b> The only immigrant welfare problem is caused by 
elderly people who, after their children bring them to America, then go 
on Supplemental Security Income (SSI) if they are poor. Their 
children should support them, but they are not going to take any 
jobs away from anyone, because they are already retired.
<P>
<P>Working-age immigrants on average are harder working than 
native born Americans and tend to have a higher labor force 
participation rate than native born Americans.
<P>
<P>Immigrants don't take jobs away from American workers.  In 
addition to the dramatic increase in immigration we have seen in 
the past ten years, we have seen a tremendous increase in new 
jobs and a falling rate of unemployment.
<P>
<P>Everybody who gets a job or keeps a job does so as an 
individual, not as a member of some group. Employers hire individuals 
who can do the work. If an immigrant gets a job, it is because the 
employer has specific job needs that the immigrant is qualified to fill.
<P>
<P><b>Q. Would more Border Patrol officers and security fences 
across the Mexican border solve the problem of illegal immigration?
<P>
<P>A.</b> More Border Patrol officers and security fences are needed, 
and Congress is providing more money to do those things. But 
more than half of the illegal immigration problem comes from 
students and tourist visitors to the United States who simply decide to 
stay after their visas expire, and from people who falsely claim 
political asylum. Border patrols and fences won't keep them out.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 38 -->

<P>
<P>The only way to stop illegal immigration is to impose stiffer 
criminal penalties on those who break our immigration laws. We 
need to put them in jail for at least a year after we catch them, and 
deport them after that. And we need to make sure they will 
never again even be able to visit the United States as a tourist or a 
businessman. The word will get out to those violators, and they 
will stop treating the violation of U.S. immigration laws like a game.
<P>
<P><b>Q. Would a national identification card, reinforced with a 
government computer system to verify identification, solve the 
problem of illegal immigration?
<P>
<P>A.</b> A national identification card, with a Big Brother 
computer system in Washington, D.C., would not stop illegal immigrants 
or even stop some employers from hiring them. What it would do 
is deprive all other Americans of some degree of privacy and create 
a monster information database that eventually could be used to 
violate our liberties.
<P>
<P>The law today makes it a crime for employers to hire illegal 
immigrants, but employers are victims, not criminals. We 
shouldn't create a system that punishes the victims and every other 
innocent American worker. Advocates of the giant computer system 
really are trying to increase government regulations on employers 
and create a justification for an army of Labor Department 
inspectors to invade every workplace in America.
<P>
<P><b>Q. How much should the federal government pay to states that 
are forced to carry the costs of illegal immigration?
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 39 -->

<P>
<P>A.</b> The federal government should be prepared to pay the 
entire costs of illegal immigration. Enforcing the immigration laws is 
a federal responsibility. If the federal government cannot do its 
job, it should pay the costs. The Balanced Budget Act Congress 
passed last year set up a way to pay the states for emergency 
medical treatment for illegal aliens.
<P>
<P>At the same time, the states should have to demonstrate the 
actual costs of illegal immigration. There have been a number of 
so-called studies of the costs of immigration, but none of them 
really proves that there is a significant cost or measures how great it 
may be. We need to get the real data and figure out how much the 
costs are; then the federal government should pay for the problem.
<P>
<P>But the most important things the federal government can do 
to stop illegal immigration are to hire more Border Patrol officers 
and stiffen the criminal penalties for breaking our immigration laws.
<P>
<P><b>Q. Should English be established officially as America's 
language and immigrants be required to read, write, and speak English?
<P>
<P>A.</b> Yes. Proficiency in the English language should be required 
of all immigrants and naturalized citizens. The standard for 
naturalized citizens should be raised to fluency in English. 
Immigrants not initially proficient in the language should be required to 
practice and study English, and their progress should be tested 
periodically.
<P>
<P>English as the national language is central to the concept 
of American nationality. Every other nation in the world is 
closely identified with its language. English is America's language.

</P>
<P>The 104th Congress has taken dramatic first steps to reform  itself. But
although the new majority  particularly the newly  elected freshmen  has made
great strides in achieving the  meaningful reform that the voters demanded
through the 1994  congressional election, much remains to be done. Congress now
must  complete the task of reforming its own operations and extend the process 
of reform to the executive branch.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Among its reform accomplishments, the 104th Congress:

</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P>Congress and the President must work together to complete  these reforms
both to demonstrate their commitment to the  American people and to make
government more accountable to the  voters and less focused on protecting
special interests and the careers  of politicians.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><A NAME="FACTS">THE FACTS</A></B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The 104th Congress made great strides in the effort to clean  up Washington,
enacting substantial reforms in its own processes  that changed the &quot;business-as-usual&quot;
mentality which frustrated  re
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 4 -->  sponsible government before the
1994 elections. But full  reform obviously takes time. The fact is that the new
Congress inherited  a federal government beset with fundamental problems in all 
three branches  executive, legislative, and judicial.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>To complete the reforms begun in 1995, therefore, Congress  and the
President must confront a series of problems, some old and some new.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*      The Supreme Court ruled state-imposed term limits 
unconstitutional.</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In a 5-4 decision on May 22, 1995,<A HREF="ftnt12.htm#2">2</A>
the U.S. Supreme Court  held that states may not impose term limits on their own
Members  of Congress. At the same time, the Court indicated that Congress 
itself may not  by statute  impose term limits. The impact of  this decision was
to invalidate 23 existing term limits laws and  give greater force to the idea
of a constitutional amendment. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The best way to ensure that members of the House and Senate  stay in touch
with their constituents and truly represent their views is  to prevent
politicians from spending their entire careers in  Washington. If they knew that
Congress could not be a career,  legislators would be less interested in the
trappings of office and less  inclined to feather their own nests, mislead the
voters, legislate  irresponsibly, and abuse their offices as part of their
reelection efforts.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>There are at least four key arguments for a constitutional  amendment to
limit congressional terms:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>1. Term limits are popular.</B> Support for limiting 
congressional 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 5 -->  terms reaches as high as 80
percent in some polls. The Gallup  poll shows that a 49 percent plurality of
Americans favored term  limits for Congress in 1964, with support swelling to 64
percent in  1990 and 73 percent in 1994.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>2. Term limits receive substantial support at the polls.</B> In 
addition to the fact that term limits were one of the most popular  components
of the Contract With America, voters have supported  them overwhelmingly when
faced with ballot initiatives. In the 22  states with term limits by referendum,
the average level of support in  the voting booth on election day was 66
percent.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>3. Term limits are a fundamentally democratic concept.</B> Since  as far
back as Aristotle, the concept of limiting the tenure of  politicians has been a
topic of public debate. One of America's  own Founding Fathers, James Madison,
argued 200 years ago that  term limits would reduce the influence of special
interests.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>4. Term limits ensure healthy change.</B> Increasing the turnover  in
Congress gives more citizens the opportunity to serve their  government and
their fellow Americans. The introduction of fresh  insights into the political
process increases the chances that  dramatic improvements in the role of
government can be effected.

<P><B>23 STATES HAVE IMPOSED TERM LIMITS ON THEIR STATE LEGISLATORS</B>

Arkansas, Maine, Nevada, Utah, California,  Massachusetts, North Dakota,
Washington, Colorado, Michigan,  Ohio, Wyoming, Florida, Missouri, and Oklahoma.
 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Audits have uncovered significant past abuses.</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>On January 4, 1995, the House of Representatives voted 430-1 
for an internal audit by an outside accounting firm, Price  Waterhouse. It was a
matter of bipartisan conventional wisdom that the  management of the House had
been permeated with &quot;abuses and  management inefficiencies,&quot; in the
words of former House  Majority Leader Richard A. Gephardt (D-MO) in 1992.
Although a  few House accounts had been audited by the General Accounting 
Office, it is likely that many had never been reviewed by an  independent
examiner. Since one such audit uncovered the House  Bank scandal, a full
accounting was long overdue. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The accounting practices of the 103rd Congress revealed by  the Price
Waterhouse audit demonstrate that the House's financial  and operational
controls were worse than even the harshest critics  had imagined. The 14
material weaknesses uncovered would be  troubling in a medium-sized business;
their presence in the  13,000-employee House of Representatives is a national
disgrace.  Most disturbing are the conclusions that the House was:
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>-     Wasting</B> millions of dollars on inefficient
purchasing practices  and superfluous staff; 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Failing</B> to prevent employee fraud through multiple 
reimbursements for the same purchase; 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Allowing</B> the use of official resources for campaign purposes;
and 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Keeping</B> such careless records that the magnitude of the loss
to  the 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 7 -->  public probably will never be
known.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The good news is that the new Congress, under the leadership  of Speaker
Newt Gingrich (R-GA), House Oversight  Committee Chairman Bill Thomas (R-CA),
Representative Jim Nussle  (R-IA), its administrative officers, and the
management team they  brought in, has taken aggressive action to correct the
deficiencies  identified by the audit. Many of the 226 recommendations the
auditors  made already have been implemented, and the remainder are  being
implemented.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Members of Congress still benefit from a system of perks  and
privileges.</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Excessive pay, perks, and expenses focused citizen anger on  Congress and
helped trigger the 1994 electoral revolution. The  new Republican majorities in
the House and Senate moved quickly  to cut staff and expenses and to eliminate
many of Congress's  exemptions from the law. Further steps are necessary,
however,  to reduce perks, reform pensions, and further trim staff. 
Congressional committees currently are considering some of these  reforms, while
others will likely be debated in the course of the  appropriations process. But
problems remain, such as automatic pay  raises, excessive pensions, and high
expense accounts.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>These perks continue to insulate Congress from American  citizens, to
frustrate political fairness, and to promote legislative  careerism and
bureaucracy. Reforms in these areas will mean a more  efficient, representative,
and politically competitive Congress. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>-     Automatic Pay Hikes.</B>  These pay hikes are
scheduled each  year 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 8 -->  with no vote required, further
boosting lawmakers' salaries,  which already exceed $11,000 a month ($133,600
per year).  Because Members' salaries are funded by a permanent, indefinite 
appropriation rather than through the annual appropriations bill, they  are
nearly invulnerable to legislative change when the rest  of Congress's budget is
under discussion. Congress should  make Members' salaries a legislative
appropriations line item and  eliminate the automatic salary cost-of-living
adjustments (COLAs)  that, unless Congress acts, give each Member an automatic
pay  hike. Such an automatic pay raise violates the spirit of the 27th 
Amendment to the Constitution, which states that Members must stand  for
reelection before any pay raise they vote on takes effect.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Excessive Pensions.</B> Congressional pensions far exceed most 
private-sector plans. Congress's pension system is up to twice as  generous as
those of most Fortune 500 corporations. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Not only do these generous pensions burden the taxpayers,  but they also
promote political careerism by providing incentives  for lawmakers to extend
their tenure. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Over 250 Members of the 103rd Congress will become  &quot;pension
millionaires,&quot; receiving pension income after their retirement  in excess
of $1 million. For instance, former Speaker of the  House Tom Foley (D-WA) is
eligible for nearly $124,000 per year in  addition to the pay he will receive
from his job at a  lobbying/law firm. The former Speaker could take in over $3
million in  pension checks over the course of his expected lifetime. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>COLAs are applied to congressional pensions as well as  congressional
salaries. Only one in ten private-sector pensions is  adjusted 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 9 -->  for inflation, and many of those
compensate for as little as a  third of the inflation rate. This feature makes
former Members of  Congress among the wealthiest of retired Americans.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Members' office expense accounts are too high.</B> The 1996 
appropriation combined the three House Members' personal  allowance accounts
(staff salaries, office expenses, and official mail) into  one appropriation, a
positive step to increase flexibility and ease  administrative burdens. However,
the combined account was  increased by over 2 percent, to over $360 million, due
to increases  in staff salaries and mail funding. A House committee has 
approved an additional 2 percent increase for the coming year, to an  average of
$887,337 for each House member. Although increases in  postal rates and
population may justify some adjustment of mail  allowances, it is difficult to
make similar arguments for an increase  in the aggregate staff salary
appropriation.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>During the debate at the beginning of the 104th Congress over  the proposed
elimination of House Legislative Service  Organizations, advocates of abolition
intimated that a substantial portion of the  $5 million spent each year on LSOs
would be saved. In fact,  these funds were not cut, and even steeper staff cuts
are justified. 
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Incumbents retain a significant electoral advantage.</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Campaign finance law and congressional perquisites provide  huge electoral
advantages for incumbents, leading to House  reelection rates of well over 90
percent  even the dramatic 1994  elections produced a reelection rate of 90.2
percent. This remarkable  level of job security is the result of several
built-in advantages that  stack the election deck. There are several reasons why
incumbents  enjoy 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 10 -->  such success.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>-     Challengers have difficulty raising funds.</B> After
passage of  the 1974 law that first regulated contributions to congressional 
campaigns, incumbents' financial advantage over challengers  grew fivefold by
1992, approaching an advantage of four to one.  In 1994, this had fallen
somewhat, to just over two to one. Much  of this is due to political action
committee (PAC) donations   special-interest gifts five times larger than
individuals are allowed  to contribute   that flow to incumbents by a
disproportionate  margin of nine to one.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Members use constituent services to build a voter base.</B> The 
greatest tax-funded advantage enjoyed by incumbents is the  routine operation of
congressional offices. Members of Congress  use about half their staffs for
constituent service or casework,  helping voters who have problems with the
government. The irony is  that these problems flow in large part from the very
laws and  government programs Congress makes possible. Says former  Minnesota
Representative Vin Weber, &quot;we create the government that  screws you, and
then you're supposed to thank us for protecting you  from it.&quot;  Studies
show that constituent service adds 5 percent to 10  percent to a typical
Member's vote total.<A HREF="ftnt12.htm#3">3</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Members have free mailing privileges  though now in  smaller
amounts.</B> In March 1994, the House Oversight Committee  approved a one-third
cut in Members' franking allowances from  their 1994 authorizations. This will
save over $20 million in  postage-related spending yearly, bringing down the
average annual  spending ceiling per congressional office from $163,000 to 
$108,000. This is a healthy step on the road to eliminating abuses that  per
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 11 -->  petuate congressional careerism.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Many campaign finance &quot;reform&quot; schemes are overregulatory.</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Many of the reform plans to diminish the influence of money  in politics
create a regulatory system that actually protects  incumbents and punishes
challengers. The key elements of many  regulatory campaign finance reform plans
include spending limits,  advertising subsidies, and public financing. These
provisions  are likely to make elections even less competitive and less 
issue-oriented.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>There are four key problems involved in limiting  congressional campaign
spending:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>1. Spending limits uniformly punish challengers.</B>
Studies  have demonstrated that challengers need to spend significant amounts 
of money to unseat sitting Members of Congress. In 1994, the  average challenger
who unseated an incumbent spent well  over $700,000.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>2. Spending limits ignore the advantages of incumbency.</B> In  addition
to contending with incumbents' natural advantage in  name identification and
media access, challengers must compete  with the enormous array of
taxpayer-funded resources that  incumbents have at their disposal.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>3. Spending limits violate the First Amendment.</B> Mandatory  limits
are clearly unconstitutional. To get around this problem, most  proposals call
the limits voluntary, but they place those who do  not accept the caps at such a
great disadvantage that the limits  argu
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 12 -->  ably are made compulsory.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>4. Spending limits encourage evasion, hiding, and cheating.</B> 
Citizens will always find ways to express their views. The  principal effect of
government regulation of political speech is to push  citizens away from
straightforward activities (such as direct  donations) into more circuitous
methods. Previous attempts at  regulating away political influence have led to
the development of  PACs, bundling, soft money, and independent expenditure 
campaigns.<A HREF="ftnt12.htm#4">4</A>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Why Public Financing Is No Answer.</B> Another way to limit  the
influence of money on politics is through public subsidizing  of campaigns.
Already, presidential campaigns receive a limited  public subsidy that has
become increasingly unpopular with  the American taxpayers (as demonstrated by
the declining number  of taxpayers who elect to participate on their tax forms).
The  four most critical problems with public financing are:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>1. The money is already committed.</B> Public financing of 
congressional candidates would require additional funds from the  federal budget
 an effort which the commitment to a balanced budget  by 2002 makes all the more
difficult.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>2. Public financing is expensive.</B> Taxpayer grants for  congressional
candidates could well total in the hundreds of millions of  dollars. The
possibility of nearly 1,000 subsidized candidates every  two years vividly
demonstrates the tremendous cost of  government involvement.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>3. The people oppose public financing.</B> Taxpayers have  abandoned the
presidential campaign fund checkoff, with participation  falling 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 13 -->  from 29 percent in 1980 to 17
percent in 1991. To find  sufficient funds for the 1996 presidential elections,
Congress was forced  to raise the value of the individual checkoff from $1 to $3
per year.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>4. Subsidizing political extremists is unattractive to most  Americans.</B>
Experience with the presidential fund shows that fringe  candidates are
attracted by government subsidies. Third-party  radical Lenora Fulani received
nearly $1 million in federal  matching funds in the 1988 presidential campaign
and over $2 million  in 1992.<A HREF="ftnt12.htm#5">5</A> 
Because there cannot be an ideological litmus test for  public financing, tax
dollars inevitably would go to dozens of  extremist candidates ranging from
Fulani to Lyndon La Rouche to  David Duke.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Why Broadcast Subsidies Also Are No Answer.</B> Postal and  broadcast
subsidies are nothing more than public funding in disguise.  By compelling
broadcasters or the postal service to provide no-cost  or low-cost political
communication services to candidates, the  government essentially is taxing
these entities and transferring  those funds to the candidates. All of the
problems that exist with  public subsidies necessarily carry over to this
heavy-handed,  big-government &quot;reform&quot; scheme.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Taxpayer-subsidized lobbying helps drive up the cost of 
government.</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The federal government currently subsidizes lobbying by  tax-exempt
organizations by supplying grants and contracts to  advocacy groups. Each year,
America's taxpayers provide these  organizations with billions of dollars which
they then use to advance  their own political agendas.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 14 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Federal funding of private advocacy is not limited by  ideology.
Organizations to the left and right of the political center use  taxpayers'
funds to promote their ideas and positions. Almost  every interest in America 
from agriculture to zoology  has one  or more organizations tainted by
government funding. The  American Association of Retired Persons, for example,
received over  $73 million in a one-year period, while the American Bar 
Association received over $2 million.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Over the past 40 years, Congress has created a vast patronage  network of
organizations that enjoy preferred tax status, receive  federal funds, and
engage in legislative or political advocacy.  The days of big-city political
machines disbursing patronage may  be coming to an end, but the disbursement of
financial dividends  to political friends remains a prominent feature of the
federal budget.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>As James Bennett and Thomas DiLorenzo wrote in their  1985 book <I>Destroying
Democracy</I>: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>      A large number of individuals with strong views can 
express their preferences by contributing funds to a group that  promotes that
issue. With tax-funded politics, however, a  small number of zealots with access
to the public purse can  obtain resources to advance its views even though few
individuals  in society share the group's philosophy. Whenever  government funds
any political advocacy group, it effectively  penalizes those groups that
advocate opposing public policies and  provides a distinct advantage to the
group or groups it favors  in the clash of ideas.<A

<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In 1995, Congress began to address the significant problem of  welfare for
lobbyists. In the House, Representatives Ernest Istook  (R-OK), David McIntosh
(R-IN), and Robert Ehrlich (R-MD)  proposed an amendment to an appropriations
bill that would limit  the amount of money federal grantees could spend on
political  advocacy to not more than 5 percent of their non-grant  revenue.<A
HREF="ftnt12.htm#7">7</A>  Even though this formula permitted
charities to spend generous  amounts of money on lobbying, it was bitterly
opposed. The  amendment died in conference.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>The Huge Growth in Committees and Staff
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Until action was taken in the 104th Congress, the explosion  in committees
and staff led to the growth of a powerful staff  bureaucracy and made it easier
for interest groups to influence  legislation.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>-     House committee staff had grown almost twelvefold since 
World War II. In the last two decades alone, committee staffs in  the House of
Representatives had grown by 158 percent. Congress  was the most heavily staffed
legislature in the world by a factor of  five, with nearly 40,000 employees.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>-     The number of committees and subcommittees totaled under  200 in 1947,
exploded in the post-Watergate era, and did not fall  significantly under 300
until the early 1990s. The new Congress  cut this number to 198.

</P>
<P><B>THE 104TH CONGRESS
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The 104th Congress acted swiftly to change its rules and  practices. The
1994 elections changed the partisan control of Congress  and delivered a clear
reform mandate. The Contract With  America promised numerous changes in House
rules, and the new  leadership of the House of Representatives took this mandate
and  ran with it. On January 4, 1995, the opening day of the 104th  Congress,
the House voted to end procedures that had become  increasingly arbitrary and
secretive. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The new House rules package largely achieved the goals of  the institution's
critics. The rules were designed to:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Improve deliberation</B> by banning proxy (absentee) voting in 
committees, ensuring minority rights in the amendment process,  and requiring
fuller reporting on spending bills.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Streamline the legislative process</B> by cutting the number of 
committees and subcommittees, abolishing joint referrals of  legislation, and
slashing committee staff.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Promote accountability</B> by requiring that committee meetings 
be open to the public and to the broadcast media, requiring roll  call votes on
major legislation, prohibiting alterations in debate  transcripts, and
conducting a comprehensive audit of House finances.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Increase responsiveness</B> by imposing term limits on the 
Speaker and committee chairmen and providing for consideration of a  measure to
apply federal laws to Congress as the first legislative  vote 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 17 -->  in the 104th Congress.

<P><B>1)  Staff Cuts and Committee Reforms.</B> The new rules  package
eliminated three House committees  Post Office and Civil  Service, District of
Columbia, and Merchant Marine and Fisheries   and 25 subcommittees. The
committee reform provision also  will shrink House committee staff by one-third.

</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B> 2)  Truth in Budgeting.</B> Appropriations committees are now  required
to compare new spending recommendations to the  current spending level. Under
the old system, tax-and-spend liberals  had the upper hand because spending
increases were judged not  against what was actually spent last year, but
against projected  spending for next year. With these rules, even a spending
increase could  be called a &quot;cut.&quot;
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>3)  Term Limits for Committee Chairmen and the Speaker.</B>  House
committee chairmen will be prohibited from serving more  than three consecutive
Congresses (six years). Limiting the tenure  of committee chairmen begins to
address some of the concerns  of advocates of full-scale legislative term
limits. A central problem  of previous Congresses had been that committee
chairmen, who  set the agenda, had spent decades in office. In the 103rd
Congress,  for example, the chairmen of two of the House's three most  powerful
committees (Ways and Means and Energy and Commerce)  had held these positions
for over a decade; the chairman of the  third (Appropriations) had just vacated
his position after holding it  since the 1970s.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 18 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In addition, the Speaker will be prohibited from serving more  than four
Congresses (eight years), bringing the top constitutional  officer of the
legislative branch in line with the President, his  executive branch
counterpart.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>4)  Elimination of Proxy Voting.</B> Elimination of the practice  of
allowing absent members of a committee to loan their votes  to other members was
critical to ensuring fairness and  improving committee deliberation. Although
House rules strictly  prohibited one Member from casting votes for another on
the House  floor (indeed, ethics reprimands have been triggered by this rule's 
violation), proxy voting was the norm in most committees in the  103rd Congress.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Historically, proxy voting allowed the majority party leadership  to extend
its control over committee outcomes by scheduling  multiple, contemporaneous
committee and subcommittee  meetings. Proxy voting also promoted committee
absenteeism by  ensuring that legislators who skipped meetings would retain
their ability  to cast votes in absentia, in addition to allowing legislators to
 abandon their deliberative responsibilities by voting for or against 
legislation without hearing any discussion or argument on its  merits.
Abolishing proxy voting will reduce the power of committee  chairmen and force
Members to show up and actually participate in  the work of their committees if
they want their votes to count.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>5)  Open Meetings.</B> The 1995 rules changes also ensure public  access
to committee meetings. In previous Congresses,  committees frequently closed
their doors to the press and public, a step  the panels could take for nearly
any reason. In fact, the two  House 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 19 -->  committees that most often
operated in secret   Appropriations and Ways and Means  were the ones making 
controversial choices about federal taxation and spending. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Further, broadcast media are permitted to cover any open  hearing or meeting
(previously, media coverage was subject to a vote  of approval). The new rules
also require that committees publish  recorded committee votes in their reports
(most voting records  previously were available only at committee offices) and
that  hearing transcripts not be altered other than for minor  grammatical
changes.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>6)  Tax Hikes More Difficult.</B> The new rules require a  three-fifths
vote of the House to pass any income tax rate increase and  prohibit retroactive
taxation of income. The 60 percent rule has been  particularly controversial,
with some Washington  commentators claiming the new rule is anti-democratic or
even  unconstitutional. Behind the heated rhetoric inside the Beltway is the
conviction  that new tax increases are needed.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The supermajority requirement is similar to restrictions  voters have
imposed on numerous state legislatures. Among the  most beneficial aspects of
the 60 percent tax rule is that any future  Congress desiring to raise taxes
would have to alter or waive the  rule, thereby signaling a potential tax boost.
The provision also  balances the burden of a 1990 budget law which effectively
requires a  60 percent vote in the Senate to cut taxes (unless the reductions 
are offset by increases in other taxes or cuts in entitlement spending).
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>7)  Authorization of House Audit.</B> Another 1995 rules change 
authorized a comprehensive audit of House records, assets, and  fa
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 20 -->  cilities by an independent
accounting firm. Some House  accounts previously had been audited sporadically
by the General  Accounting Office, an internal congressional agency. Despite the
fact  that one such audit uncovered the House Bank scandal, most  House accounts
were not examined regularly, and some may never  have been reviewed by an
independent examiner. This audit was  the first complete accounting of the
House's financial status  ever made available to the public.<A
HREF="ftnt12.htm#8">8</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>8)  Applying Federal Laws to Congress.</B> The last of the  Contract
reforms was the Congressional Accountability Act (CAA).  This measure has both
substantive and symbolic importance. It  underscores the principle that no
American should be immune from  the law or receive special treatment in its
application. The bill  also should encourage legislators to review the burdens
that  federal laws place upon American citizens and ensure that the  benefits
they bring exceed their attendant costs.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Term Limits </B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The new Congress also held the first-ever votes on term  limits. Although
the House fell short of the necessary two-thirds  majority by 63 votes (227
ayes, 204 nays), the vote marked a  significant improvement over previous
Congresses that refused even to  debate the issue. Seven months after the House
vote, the Senate took up  a nonbinding resolution supporting term limits. The
resolution  failed to win majority support (45 ayes, 49 nays). Still, by putting
 members of the House and Senate on record as publicly supporting  or opposing
term limits, supporters now have a standard  against which they can measure
future Congresses. In addition, the  voters will know  unequivocally  where
their representatives stand  on 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 21 -->  this important issue. A Senate
vote on a constitutional  amendment is planned for early 1996, though supporters
concede they are  certain to fail. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Budget Cuts </B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The new Congress voted to slash its own budget. The FY  1996 legislative
branch appropriations bill provided systemic  congressional reforms as important
as any yet enacted, including  spending cuts, staff cuts, privatization, and
abolition of unnecessary  offices and functions. The FY 1996 congressional
budget would  reduce spending in real dollars  not phony &quot;baseline&quot;
cuts  by  $242 million, or 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Congress succeeded in setting an example for the rest of the  government by
slashing its staff and eliminating unneeded  agencies, including the $21 million
Office of Technology  Assessment, which had provided redundant services to the
national  legislature. The reforms push the General Accounting Office to
privatize  its administrative functions, such as printing, mail handling, and 
library services. The GAO also will receive funds to contract  out some of its
auditing work so that it can benefit from the  lower costs available in the
private sector. The result is a real cut of  more than one-fourth in the GAO's
budget.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Despite Congress's effort to lead by example by cutting its  own budget
first, President Clinton vetoed the legislative branch  appropriations bill the
first time it reached his desk. He stated that  he liked the bill but did not
want to let Congress receive its  funding early in the budget process. In other
words, the President  decided that scoring political points was more important
than  achieving 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 22 -->  real spending cuts.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Lobbying Reform and Gift Ban</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In 1995, the House and Senate both enacted rules restricting  the types and
amounts of gifts lawmakers may receive. The  Senate passed a complex rule that
allowed single gifts up to $50, with  a $100 annual limit. Any item less than
$10 fell outside the  Senate's rules. The House chose to adopt a more sweeping
proposal  offered by Speaker Newt Gingrich to prohibit all gifts. Both the 
Senate rule and the House ban include exceptions for  commemorative items and
expenses related to official activities.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Lobbying disclosure legislation was approved by both the  House and Senate
in late 1995. While this legislation would adopt  new reporting requirements and
close loopholes in the original  1946 Lobby Reform Act, it carefully avoids many
potential pitfalls.  It successfully protects legitimate grassroots organizing,
as well  as part-time and small lobbying operations.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>A glaring omission from the so-called reform bill was any  meaningful effort
to address taxpayer-subsidized lobbying.  Opponents of this reform argued for
months that welfare for lobbyists  should be addressed in the lobby reform
debate, then turned around  and argued against any House amendments to this
important  legislation. The result is a flawed lobby reform bill.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Clinton Administration has a very poor record on  political reform
issues. The President has supported an overregulatory  cam
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 23 -->  paign finance &quot;reform&quot;
scheme that would impose spending  limits and public financing. He promoted
lobbying reform but  adamantly opposed provisions that would have restricted the
abuse of  taxpayer grants through government-subsidized lobbying.  Moreover, he
has not supported the most important reform needed to shake  up the current
political process: term limits.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Clinton Administration has promoted the concept of  &quot;reinventing
government,&quot; but a close examination of the fine print  of the
Administration's plan shows that it makes federal  management even worse.
Clinton proposals weaken merit standards in  hiring, promotion, and pay and
strengthen the role of federal unions  in setting salary levels of work
assignments in federal agencies,  thus directly undermining management
authority. The result: a  federal bureaucracy even less accountable to the
public.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>WHAT TO DO IN 1997</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The 104th Congress achieved dramatic reforms in the structure  and operation
of Congress, but many other reforms are needed.  Among them, the new Congress
should:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Pass a constitutional amendment for term limits.</B> Although  the
104th Congress put all its members on record for or against  term limits, the
failure to enact the reform means that Members of  Congress still can remain in
office as long as they want. The  Supreme Court's ruling against state-based
term limits leaves Congress  no choice but to enact a constitutional amendment
to end  congressional careerism.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Slash congressional perks and privileges. </B>Congress should  end

<!-- Generation of PM publication page 24 -->  wasteful, inefficient spending
and perquisites that separate  lawmakers from their constituents. The reforms in
the Contract  With America were good first steps, but Congress should continue 
to reform its own pay, pensions, perks, and staff. Specifically,  it should:

</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Citizen Congress Act, introduced in the House by  Representatives Mark
Sanford (R-SC) and Wayne Allard (R-CO) and in  the Senate by Bill Frist (R-TN),
is a sensible effort to address  these perks and privileges, including the items
listed above. The  bill (H.R. 2610/S. 1405) also would eliminate mass mailings
paid  for by the taxpayers  a tremendous incumbent advantage. These  re
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 25 -->  forms are needed to bring
Congress more in contact with the  challenges faced by average citizens and to
help restore  Americans' trust in government.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Action on the political reform that the American public has  demanded is
beginning to materialize, as shown by the 23 states  that passed term limits
legislation and by the provisions of the  Contract With America providing for
congressional committee and  staff reductions. To make challengers more
competitive and ensure  that incumbents are not abusing taxpayers' funds in
their  re-election campaigns, Congress should:

<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>-     Curtail franked mass mailings</B> from House Members

savings  to create a central constituent service office to handle routine 
requests. 
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P>Eliminating these advantages, in addition to saving  taxpayers money, would
represent true campaign finance reform by  diminishing the overwhelming
advantages incumbents enjoy in  elections. Reformers who seek genuinely
competitive elections and  a 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 26 -->  more efficient, representative,
and deliberative Congress  should place cuts in congressional pay, perks,
pensions, and staff at  the top of their agenda.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*      Enact campaign finance reform.</B> While the most important 
steps toward improving the American electoral system are term  limits and
reducing the incumbency advantage, other improvements  can be made in campaign
financing.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Wamp Congress Act of 1995 (H.R. 2148), named for  sponsor Zach Wamp
(R-TN), provides productive and realistic reforms  that reduce special-interest
and incumbent advantages with a  minimum of new regulation. The legislation
would:

</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

less than the level required to offset inflation since  1974. His proposal

<P><B>*     Apply the Freedom of Information Act to Congress.</B> The  major
flaw in the Congressional Accountability Act was its exclusion  of the Freedom
of Information Act (FOIA) from the list of  covered laws. The FOIA does not
apply to the private sector because it  is intended to give the public access to
government information.  Excluding the Act makes it appear that Congress thinks
it has  something to hide and runs counter to the openness in government 
principles embodied in most other House reforms.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     End welfare for lobbyists.</B> Although Congress has begun to 
address the issue of taxpayer-subsidized political advocacy, much  remains to be
done. In the 105th Congress, investigative hearings  must continue to examine
existing abuses, and further remedies must  be considered. The information
gained from these hearings and  from further investigation into the activities
of federal grantees must  be used to develop a meaningful reform proposal that,
as nearly  as possible, eliminates this outrageous abuse of taxpayers' funds.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>At its root, the issue of welfare for lobbyists is one of fairness  and
fiscal responsibility. True reform can be achieved only if it  includes the
following principles:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>-     Full Disclosure.</B> Strong reporting requirements
are necessary  to shed light on the extent of this problem. Widespread abuse is 
already apparent  even from the limited and often confusing  data currently
gathered by the government. Federal grantees must  be tracked carefully and
should be required to indicate how  much money they dedicate to advocacy.
Furthermore, whatever  informa
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 28 -->  tion the government collects
should be readily available to  the public for inspection. To the greatest
extent feasible, this  should include availability via the Internet at no cost
to users. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Truth in Testimony.</B> Witnesses testifying before Congress 
should be required to divulge whether they receive federal funds and,  if so,
for what purposes and in what amounts.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     No Federal Funding for Advocacy.</B> No advocacy organization 
that receives federal funds should be permitted to engage in  anything but
incidental lobbying except on issues related directly to its  tax status.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     No Bureaucratic Shell Games.</B> No organization that receives 
federal funds should be permitted to provide financial assistance  to any
affiliated organization that engages in lobbying activity.  All sub-grantees
should be treated as if they received the funds  directly from the federal
government. Organizations should not  be able to create sham &quot;foundations&quot;
that launder taxpayer funding  to support lobbying.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Tough Penalties.</B> The consequences for violating the
prohibition  on federally subsidized lobbying must be firm enough to  discourage
organizations from violating the standards. Under no  circumstances should any
organization that willingly and knowingly  violates this prohibition receive
additional federal funding.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Civil Service Reform. </B>The new Congress and the new  President must
cooperate in tackling the toughest management chore in  the country: running the
federal bureaucracy. To do this, they  must examine every agency and bureau of
the government to:

altogether.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P>While reforming federal hiring, pay, and benefit policies, both  the
President and Congress must be sure to enforce the merit  principles of the
civil service system and maintain a bright line  between career and non-career
jobs. The usurpation of policy  functions by career staff undermines the
accountability of political  appointees to the President and the taxpayer, while
political abuse  of career staff undermines the integrity and professionalism of
 the civil service. Under no circumstance should Congress  undermine the
President's authority to appoint his own people to positions  of responsibility
and thus carry out his agenda and fulfill his  promises to the taxpayers. Good
government is accountable government. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In the meantime, the President and Congress should advance  serious reform
of the federal civil service system:

</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>*     Establish serious pay-for-performance standards for

throughout the federal workforce.

<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Modernize federal benefits.</B> The federal government should 
adopt a defined contribution for federal retirement and expand  investment

</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Consolidate federal management and personnel agencies.</B>  The
President and Congress should consolidate the Office of  Management and Budget
(OMB), the Office of Personnel  management (OPM), and the General Services
Administration (GSA) into a  new Office of Management. At the same time, federal
employee  appeals and grievances, now scattered among EEOC, the  Federal Labor
Relations Board (FLRB), and the Merit Systems  Protection Board (MSPB), should
be consolidated into one agency.

</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Aren't the Republicans hypocritical to attack  congressional
careerism in 1994, then fail to pass term limits in 1995?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> The 104th Congress made great progress on term limits just  by
bringing the measure up for a vote in the House and Senate.  Although both
houses failed to come up with the two-thirds  majority needed to move the
amendment forward, they have provided  term limit supporters with a solid
benchmark to use in pressing ahead  in the 105th Congress.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>It will likely take at least one more election before Congress  has enough
conservative members dedicated to the cause of term  limits to muster the
supermajority needed to press ahead with a  con
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 31 -->  stitutional amendment.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Isn't Congress really just trying to &quot;muzzle&quot; opponents
with  its effort to end welfare for lobbyists?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> No. The attempts to end taxpayer-subsidized lobbying all  seek to
end 40 years of corrupt political patronage. The proposals  considered by the
104th Congress applied to groups all across  the ideological spectrum. Despite
cries that the reform  efforts amounted to nothing more than &quot;defunding the
left,&quot; the  Simpson-Istook compromise language that reached the floor of
the  House and Senate would affect corporations that receive grants  (primarily
for research and development) just as much as nonprofits.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Welfare for lobbyists is a fundamental question of fiscal  responsibility.
With the drive to achieve a balanced budget in 2002, it  is utterly
irresponsible for the government to be feeding hungry  lobbyists instead of
hungry children.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Why are some of the most vocal supporters of term limits  career
politicians?  Why don't they apply term limits to themselves?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Some Members, particularly those elected since 1990,  have agreed
to self-imposed term limits. This marks significant  progress toward a true &quot;citizen
Congress.&quot;  However, many Members  are reluctant to agree voluntarily to
term limits. If reformers  unilaterally &quot;disarm themselves&quot; by leaving
Congress now, the  career politicians left behind will enjoy an even tighter
control of  Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. How can the influence of big money contributions be reduced?
</B><!-- Generation of PM publication page 32 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> The best way to reduce the impact of special interests on 
elections is to reduce the role of Washington. This can be  accomplished in
several ways. First, reducing the size of  government would reduce the number of
programs subject to  special-interest lobbying and would lower the taxes from
which corporations  routinely seek exceptions. Similarly, imposition of a flat
tax  would eliminate the bidding for tax code loopholes that currently  drives
much Washington lobbying.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The second step is to reduce Washington's role in the  political process.
Ending taxpayer-subsidized lobbying and forcing  special interests to raise
their money directly from supporters will place  all groups on a level playing
field. At the same time, the federal  government should remain out of the
business of overregulating  elections. In fact, current regulatory schemes are
part of the problem.  It is important to recall that the 1970s campaign finance
reform  effort produced PACs, now the target of reform themselves.  Elections
should not be government-funded, the media should not  be forced to carry
no-cost or low-cost political advertising, and  the government should not impose
spending limits. Moreover,  individual and PAC contribution levels should be
equalized to  ensure that special interests do not enjoy an advantage over 
individual voters.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Of course, the ultimate solution to the influence of money in  politics is
to adopt term limits. Limiting the tenure of Members  of Congress forces them to
focus more on policies than politics.  With the understanding that they will not
be part of a &quot;career  Congress,&quot; Members will not be as dependent on
special interests to remain  in office.

</P>
<P>Race and all of the complex and emotional issues that flow from  it have
been America's unique dilemma since before the founding  of the Republic. After
centuries of overt discrimination against  black Americans, the Supreme Court,
in a series of seminal  decisions beginning with <I>Brown v. Board of 
Education</I> in 1954, initiated the long process of dismantling the
institutional sources of racial  discrimination in American society in areas
such as education,  housing, and voting. Congress, too, attempted to remove
these  barriers in historic legislation such as the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and
 the Voting Rights Act of 1965.

<P>
</P>
<P><B>The Rise of Affirmative Action. </B>Over the last three  decades,
however, federal judges and agency bureaucrats have  embarked upon a sustained
crusade to twist and distort the original intent  of these laws so that race,
ethnicity, and sex became the proxy  for special, rather than equal, treatment
under the law. Race  consciousness quickly overtook color blindness as the
guiding  principle for the application of civil rights laws that Congress 
explicitly intended to be neutral on these grounds. Today, liberals  justify
race and sex preferences  which have proliferated under the  guise of
affirmative action  as an appropriate and long-overdue  response to centuries of
discrimination against racial minorities  and 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 2 -->  women.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>As a result, federal agencies now administer literally hundreds  of programs
that favor individuals, businesses, and other  institutions on the basis of the
race, ethnicity, or sex of those who benefit  from these programs. These
preferences can be found in federal  statutes, regulations, and executive
orders. Some are specific to a  particular law or agency; others are
government-wide in their application.  A thorough review of these preferences,
moreover, reveals that  they come in all shapes and sizes  5 percent, 6.9
percent, 8 percent,  10 percent, even as high as 25 percent. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In addition to these federally sponsored preferences, judicial  and agency
interpretations of federal civil rights laws have  required state and local
governments, colleges and universities, and  private-sector employers to adopt
race and sex-based preferences in  areas such as hiring, promotions, college
admissions, and the  distribution of other privileges and benefits in our
society. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Conservative candidates for federal office who believe in the  principle of
equal treatment under the law should emphasize the  following:

<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>The federal government should never favor one group of 
Americans over another on the basis of race, ethnicity, or sex.</B> Race  or

<P>
</P>
<P><B>Congress should clarify what constitutes discrimination.</B> A  pattern
of historical discrimination against a particular group does not  necessarily
mean an individual is subject to discrimination.  Discrimi
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 3 -->  nation, moreover, simply cannot be
inferred from statistical  disparities between whites and minorities (or between
men  and women) in employment, housing, or student bodies.

</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Many liberal economists and policymakers argue that virtually  all income
differences between racial groups, and between men  and women, are attributable
to discrimination. What exactly do  we know about income differences between
whites and blacks?   What are these differences?  More important, do these
differences  serve as irrefutable proof of discrimination?
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Representative Sheila Jackson Lee (D-TX) offers a statistical  perspective
common among liberals when she relies upon  statistical differences to argue
that &quot;minorities and women do not have  equal opportunity.&quot;  According
to Lee, &quot;As long as women make up  only 8 percent of engineers, 31 percent
of scientists, and 16 percent  of physicists, we have much work ahead of  us.&quot;<A
HREF="ftnt13.htm#2">2</A>

<P>
</P>
<P>Boston University economics professor Glenn C. Loury,  however, disagrees.
Testifying before the same House subcommittee,  Professor Loury observed that:

<BLOCKQUOTE><P>     [T]here is no scientific basis for concluding that
existing  economic differences between groups are caused by, or  reflect the
extent of, discrimination. Groups differ in ways  which affect their aggregate
income, but which are often not  taken 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 4 -->  into account when the groups are
compared. On my review  of the evidence, discrimination is not a major factor in
 explaining racial economic differences, and federal affirmative  action
policies over the past two decades have contributed  only marginally to the
diminution of these  differences.<A HREF="ftnt13.htm#3">3</A>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P>The best way to ascertain whether any real differences exist  between groups
is to compare apples to apples by controlling  for such important factors as
age, education, and family  structure. When such comparisons are made, most, if
not all, aggregate  income differences between whites and blacks disappear. In
fact,  an honest application of the liberal assumption that  discrimination
lurks behind statistical differences leads to the conclusion that  not only is
statistical proof of discrimination extremely hard to  find, but some categories
of minorities  such as black,  college-educated females  are doing so well that
they qualify as the  &quot;innocent persons&quot; who must bear the burden of
race or  sex-conscious remedies.

black males overall,  this difference disappears when we compare blacks to
similarly  situated whites:

<BLOCKQUOTE><P>      Overall, black men earned 82.9 percent of the white 
wage. Adjusting for black-white differences in geographic  region, 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 5 -->  schooling and age raises the ratio
to 87.7 percent; adding  differences in [standardized] test scores to this list
of  characteristics raises the ratio to 95.5 percent, and adding differences  in
years of work experience raises the ratio to 99.1  percent.<A

<P>
</P>
<P><B>Neither are black and white women.</B> Among women with  comparable
educational credentials, there is little or no difference  between whites and
blacks. The U.S. Commission on Civil  Rights found that, among women with
college degrees, black women  actually earn more than their white counterparts.<A
HREF="ftnt13.htm#5">5</A>

<P>
</P>
<P>Citing a recent Census Bureau study, Boston University's  Glenn Loury noted
that: &quot;In 1993 there were about 400,000 college  educated black men and
women working full time as executives,  administrators or managers.... [T]he
women enjoyed median  earnings 10 percent<I> higher</I> than comparable white 
women.&quot;<A HREF="ftnt13.htm#6">6</A>  Loury emphasizes
that sizable aggregate income differences do exist  between black and white
women and attributes this to the fact  that black women are far more likely to
head single-parent  households than are whites; in 1994, roughly one-half of
black families  were headed by women compared to 13 percent of white  families.<A

<P><B>Family Structure Explains Many Differences</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Thomas Sowell, Senior Fellow at Stanford University's  Hoover Institution,
has found that, when education and family structure  are held constant, income
differences between whites and blacks  have been negligible for almost three
decades:

<BLOCKQUOTE><P>     As far back as 1969, black males who came from  homes 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 6 -->  where there were newspapers,
magazines and library  cards had the same incomes as whites from similar homes
and  with the same number of years of schooling. In the 1970s,  black
husband-and-wife families outside the South earned as  much as white
husband-and-wife families outside the South.  By 1981, for the country as a
whole, black  husband-and-wife families where both were college educated and
both  working earned slightly more than white families of the same  description.<A

<P>To Sowell and many other experts, white-black income  differences can be
traced to differences in family structure that became  apparent in 1960 and have
been accelerating ever since:

<BLOCKQUOTE><P>      In every decennial census from 1920 through 1960, 
inclusive, at least 60 percent of all black males from age 15 on  up were
currently married. Moreover, the difference  between black and white males in
this respect was never as great as  5 percentage points during this entire era.
Yet, by 1980,  less than half of all black males in these age brackets were 
currently married  and the gap between black and white  males was 17 percentage
points. By 1992, that gap had widened  to 21 percentage points.<A

</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Original Intent of the 1964 Civil Rights Act.</B> Senator Hubert  H.
Humphrey (D-MN), floor manager for the 1964 Act, when  addressing one skeptical
colleague made what is perhaps the  most famous offer ever made on the Senate
floor: &quot;If the Senator  can find in title VII... any language which
provides that an  employer 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 7 -->  will have to hire on the basis of
percentage or quota related  to color... I will start eating the pages one after
another, because it  is not in there.&quot;<A
HREF="ftnt13.htm#10">10</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Humphrey also assured the Senate that &quot;nothing in the bill  would
permit any official or court to require any employer or labor  union to give
preferential treatment to any minority group.&quot;  
<A HREF="ftnt13.htm#11">11</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Senator Harrison Williams (D-NJ) also understood the 1964  Civil Rights Act
to be color-blind in its application. During floor  debate, he said: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>      [T]o hire a Negro solely because he is a Negro is racial 
discrimination, just as much as a `white only'  employment policy. Both forms of
discrimination are prohibited by  Title VII of this bill. The language of that
title simply states  that race is not a qualification for employment....Some 
people charge that [the Civil Rights Act of 1964] favors the Negro,  at the
expense of the white majority. But how can the  language of equality favor one
race over another?  Equality can  have only one meaning....Those who say that
equality means  favoritism do violence to common sense.
<A HREF="ftnt13.htm#12">12</A>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P>Representative John Lindsay (R-NY), a member of the House  Judiciary
Committee, similarly assured members that the  legislation did not favor one
group over another: &quot;[The bill] does  not...force acceptance of people in
schools, jobs, housing, or public  accommodations because they are Negro. It
does not impose quotas  or any special privileges of seniority or acceptance.
There is  nothing whatever in this bill about racial  balance.&quot;<A

<!-- Generation of PM publication page 8 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Civil Rights Act of 1964 covers over 94 million employees  in both the
public and private sectors. As controversial as the  Dole-Canady legislation may
be to liberals, it would reach only  federal workers, who comprise but 3.1
percent of the nation's work  force. Those who work for state and local
governments,  private-sector firms that receive federal contracts, and other
private sector  firms would continue to be subject to federal civil rights laws
that  require employers to favor some individuals over others on  racial,
ethnic, or gender grounds. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Casting a Wider Net?</B> One common perception about  affirmative action
is that it began as a benign effort to combat  discrimination by requiring
employers to cast a wider net so that members of  historically neglected groups
could compete on an equal footing  for jobs and promotions. Only later, this
theory holds, did it  evolve into the current system of quotas and preferences.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>While this may be true in some instances, President  Lyndon Johnson laid the
foundations for today's complex web of  race-conscious programs and set-asides
as early as June 1965. &quot;[I]t  is not enough,&quot; Johnson said, &quot;to
open the gates of opportunity.&quot;   Rather, &quot;All our citizens must have
the ability to walk  through those gates.&quot;  Johnson continued: &quot;This
is the next and the  more profound stage of the battle for civil rights. We seek
not just  freedom but opportunity. We seek not just legal equity but human 
ability, not just equality as a right and a theory but equality as a  fact and
equality as a result.&quot;  <A HREF="ftnt13.htm#14">14</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Similarly, while most commentators recall the famous  declaration by Martin
Luther King, Jr., that he dreamed of the day when  a 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 9 -->  citizen's race would not matter
and persons would be judged  &quot;not by the color of their skin but by the
content of their  character,&quot; they forget his comment two years later when
he defended  &quot;preferential treatment&quot; for minority groups in a
magazine interview: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Playboy:</B> Do you feel it's fair to request a
multibillion-dollar  program of preferential treatment for the Negro, or for any
other  minority group?

<P><B>Dr. King:</B> I do indeed.<A HREF="ftnt13.htm#15">15</A>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P>Today, it is common for proponents to justify affirmative action  as a group
remedy that rewards even individuals who have not  suffered from discrimination.
One of many examples of this  approach comes from Walter Dellinger, currently
Assistant Attorney  General in the U.S. Department of Justice, who defines 
affirmative action as &quot;a group-based remedy: where a group has been 
subject to discrimination, individual members of the group can  benefit from the
remedy, even if they have not proved that they have  been discriminated against
personally.&quot;<A HREF="ftnt13.htm#16">16</A> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Proponents of affirmative action typically deny that these  policies amount
to quotas or that they constitute any form of reverse  discrimination. Numerical
goals and timetables, they argue, are  not quotas. President Clinton's Assistant
Attorney General for  Civil Rights, Deval L. Patrick, believes that affirmative
action  policies come in three flavors:<A HREF="ftnt13.htm#17">17</A>

<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Casting a wider net:</B> At one end of the spectrum are
efforts  to reach out to &quot;traditionally excluded individuals&quot; and to  &quot;recruit
talent broadly in all American communities.&quot; 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 10 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Quotas:</B> At the other end of the spectrum are quotas, which  Patrick
defines as &quot;hard and fast numbers of places in school or the  workplace
specifically reserved for members of certain groups,  regardless of
qualifications.&quot;  No one supports quotas, argues  Patrick, who adds that
federal law makes these measures patently illegal.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Affirmative consideration:</B> Here lies the middle ground
of  affirmative action, where race, ethnicity, or sex is but one of many 
factors considered in evaluating qualified candidates. &quot;This form of 
consideration,&quot; Patrick explains, &quot;does not guarantee success based 
on race, ethnicity or gender. Rather it emphasizes a full range  of
qualifications and is characterized by flexibility.&quot; 
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Is discrimination an inevitable part of affirmative action  programs? 
</B>Since the inception of affirmative action, the  Supreme Court has concluded
on several occasions that these programs  actually require discrimination
against innocent parties. For  example, former Justice Harry Blackmun admitted
in 
<I>Bakke v. State of California</I> that &quot;I suspect that it would be
impossible to arrange  an affirmative action program in a racially neutral way
and have it  be successful.... In order to get beyond racism, we must first take
 account of race. There is no other way. And in order to treat  some persons
equally, we must treat them  differently.&quot;<A
HREF="ftnt13.htm#18">18</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Eight years later, the Court acknowledged that &quot;as part of  this
Nation's dedication to eradicating racial discrimination,  innocent persons may
be called upon to bear some of the burden of the  remedy.&quot;<A
HREF="ftnt13.htm#19">19</A>  Finally, in his autobiography,
Justice William O.  Douglas quoted his colleague, Justice Thurgood Marshall, as 
specifically acknowledging the discriminatory nature of race-conscious  affir
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 11 -->  mative action policies: &quot;You
guys have been practicing  discrimination for years. Now it's our  turn.&quot;<A

</P>
<P><B>The Supreme Court's Tighter Standard for Federal  Affirmative Action
Programs </B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>On June 12, 1995, the Supreme Court imposed a crucial and,  many would
argue, debilitating requirement on government  programs that bestow preferences
on the basis of race. The case  was <I>Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pena</I>.<A
HREF="ftnt13.htm#21">21</A> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The U.S. Department of Transportation awarded the prime  contract for a
highway construction project in Colorado to  Mountain Gravel &amp; Construction
Company. Under the terms of the  contract, Mountain Gravel would receive a
bonus, up to 2 percent of  the total contract, if it hired subcontractors
certified as small  businesses controlled by &quot;socially and economically 
disadvantaged individuals.&quot;<A HREF="ftnt13.htm#22">22</A>
 Although Adarand submitted the low bid for  the guardrail portion of the
contract, Mountain Gravel accepted  a higher bid from the Gonzales Construction
Company. Why?   Under federal law, Gonzales' designation as a &quot;socially and
 economically disadvantaged&quot; business entitled Mountain Gravel to  a
$30,000 bonus from the Department of  Transportation.<A
HREF="ftnt13.htm#23">23</A>  The Court held that &quot;[A]ll
racial classifications, imposed by  whatever federal, state, or local
governmental actor, must be analyzed by  a reviewing court under strict
scrutiny. In other words, such  classifications are constitutional only if they
are narrowly tailored  measures that further compelling governmental interests.&quot;

</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The <I>Adarand </I>decision has prompted the Clinton Administration  to
mount an aggressive defense of existing affirmative action  pro
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 12 -->  grams that favor one race or
ethnic group over  others.<A HREF="ftnt13.htm#24">24</A> 
Because <I>Adarand</I><U> </U>will cast a long shadow over congressional and 
executive branch activity on civil rights issues in 1996 and beyond, it is 
important to examine it in some detail.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Writing for the majority, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor  observed that
race-based distinctions in federal law are always highly  suspect, both when
they seek to harm groups that historically  have been discriminated against and
when they seek to bestow  advantages on them. O'Connor concluded that &quot;any
person, of  whatever race, has the right to demand that any governmental actor 
subject to the Constitution justify any racial classification subjecting  that
person to unequal treatment under the strictest judicial  scrutiny.&quot;<A

<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Is there a &quot;debtor&quot; or &quot;creditor&quot; race?  
</B>Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas wrote concurring opinions in
which  they took strong exception to any statutory or regulatory  classification
based, in whole or in part, on race. Justice Scalia wrote: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>      In my view, government can never have a &quot;compelling 
interest&quot; in discriminating on the basis of race in order to  &quot;make up&quot;
for past racial discrimination in the opposite  direction. Individuals who have
been wronged by unlawful racial  discrimination should be made whole; but under
our  Constitution there can be no such thing as either a creditor or  debtor
race.... To pursue the concept of racial entitlement  even  for the most
admirable and benign of purposes  is to  reinforce and preserve for future
mischief the way of thinking that  produced race slavery, race privilege and
race hatred. In the  eyes of the government, we are just one race here. It is 
American.<a href="ftnt13.htm#26">26</a> 
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Leaving the door open to future  mischief.</B> While the strict scrutiny
standard undoubtedly will force federal, state, and  local policymakers to
eliminate racial preferences from  government programs, Justices Scalia and
Thomas raise a legitimate point.  The very notion of strict scrutiny
contemplates that in some  situations, laws that favor one race over another
will pass constitutional  muster. In fact, Justice O'Connor left the door open
for legislatures  to enact laws containing more subtle forms of racial
preferences  by observing that &quot;The unhappy persistence of both the
practice  and the lingering effects of racial discrimination against  minority
groups in this country is an unfortunate reality, and government  is not
disqualified from acting in response to  it.&quot;<A
HREF="ftnt13.htm#27">27</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Looking for ways to preserve the literally hundreds of federal  laws and
regulations that contain racial preferences, President  Clinton and his
appointees have seized upon O'Connor's comment to  argue that strict scrutiny is
not really all that  strict.<A HREF="ftnt13.htm#28">28</A> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Will Strict Scrutiny Spell the End of Race and Sex-Based  Preferences?</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Former Justice Thurgood Marshall once described the strict  scrutiny
standard in constitutional cases as &quot;strict in theory, but fatal  in fact.&quot;<A
HREF="ftnt13.htm#29">29</A>  More recently, Justice Clarence
Thomas concluded  that, aside from two anomalous cases during World War II, 
application of this standard to racial classifications &quot;has proven 
automatically fatal.&quot;<A HREF="ftnt13.htm#30">30</A> 
While legal scholars may dispute the effect of strict  scrutiny on federal
affirmative action programs, no one doubts  that <I>Adarand </I>makes it
extraordinarily difficult for these programs  to 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 14 -->  survive in the future. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>To Justice O'Connor, the purpose of strict scrutiny is to  &quot;`smoke out'
illegitimate uses of race by assuring that the legislative  body is pursuing a
goal important enough to warrant use of a highly  suspect tool. The test also
ensures that the means chosen `fit'  this compelling goal so closely that there
is little or no possibility  that the motive for the classification was
illegitimate racial prejudice  or stereotype.&quot;<A
HREF="ftnt13.htm#31">31</A> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>What, then, does strict scrutiny mean for racial preferences in  federal
law?<A HREF="ftnt13.htm#32">32</A>  Yale Law School professor
Paul Gewirtz believes  that most, if not all, racial preferences will fall afoul
of this  standard. He argues that:

<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Race-based affirmative action is constitutional only where
it  addresses the effects of discrimination in the most  circumscribed sense.</B>
Despite the best efforts of President Clinton and his  appointees to rally
around the mantra of diversity, a majority of  justices now reject both
diversity and inclusion as independent goals  for affirmative action.<A
HREF="ftnt13.htm#33">33</A>  In doing so, the Court has put
the  Congress on notice that literally hundreds of federal programs and 
regulations are unconstitutional. Justice O'Connor has said that  diversity &quot;is
clearly not a compelling interest,&quot; rests on &quot;illegitimate 
stereotypes,&quot; and is &quot;too amorphous, too insubstantial, and too 
unrelated to any legitimate basis for employing racial  classifications.&quot;<A
HREF="ftnt13.htm#34">34</A> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Affirmative action may be used only where Congress can  show that actual
discrimination has occurred.</B> This requires hard  evidence that
discrimination exists in the local market and  sector where affirmative action
is used. Courts are increasingly  reluctant 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 15 -->  to accept inferences that
statistical disparities among racial  groups are caused by local discrimination
rather than by other  factors. Thus, an affirmative action program that gives
preferences to  minority-owned engineering firms in awarding contracts would  be
more likely to pass constitutional muster if officials could  demonstrate that
the basis of the alleged statistical underrepresentation  is the relevant pool
of qualified applicants  the number of  minority-owned engineering firms
financially capable of bidding for  these contracts in the geographic area in
question  rather than the  overall percentage of minorities in the area. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Racial preferences must be narrowly tailored to remedy  identifiable
discrimination.</B> Race-based methods may be used only  (a) after race-neutral
means are considered; (b) to the extent  shown necessary to remedy the scope of
the identified discrimination;  (c) where the individual seeking a racial
preference has suffered  from the effects of the past discrimination; and (d) if
undue burdens  on nonbeneficiaries   such as layoffs  are avoided. As 
University of Michigan professor Carl Cohen explains, &quot;[I]t is the injury 
for which remedy is given, not the skin color or  sex.&quot;<A
HREF="ftnt13.htm#35">35</A> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Lower courts have interpreted the strict scrutiny standard  narrowly. As
Gewirtz notes, &quot;most of the [state and local]  programs litigated to
judgment have been held unconstitutional.&quot;  Those  that have survived,
moreover, either have not been challenged or  were settled out of court.<A

<P><B>The Clinton Administration's Strategy to Preserve Preferences </B>

<P>
</P>
<P>On June 28, 1995, Walter Dellinger, Assistant Attorney General  in the
Office of Legal Counsel in the Justice Department, sent &quot;a  gen
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 16 -->  eral overview&quot; to all
general counsel in federal agencies  on <I>Adarand </I>and &quot;the new
standard for assessing the  constitutionality of federal affirmative action
programs.&quot;  Dellinger advised  that <I>Adarand </I>allows some
race-conscious affirmative action  programs to survive in certain circumstances.
But what are those  circumstances?  Dellinger's legal strategy to undermine 
<I>Adarand </I>includes the following key points:

<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Constitutional considerations may compel the courts to
defer  to Congress more generally on affirmative action issues.</B>  Dellinger
drives an enormous loophole through<I>  Adarand</I> when he argues that
Congress may be able to justify remedial racial and ethnic  classifications
simply by including &quot;national findings of  discrimination&quot; in the
prologue to legislation. Congress, he argues, enjoys  express constitutional
power to remedy discrimination against  minorities and therefore has more
latitude to engage in race-based  affirmative action than do state and local
governments. But he cautions  that Congress may not use evidence of &quot;generalized,
historical  societal discrimination&quot; to justify racial preferences. Rather,
it &quot;must  have some particularized evidence about the existence and effects
 of discrimination in the sectors and industries for which it  prescribes racial
or ethnic  classifications.&quot;<A HREF="ftnt13.htm#37">37</A>

</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Governments can enact affirmative action programs even with  no evidence
of actual discrimination, provided that this  information eventually becomes
available.</B> Dellinger argues that lower  courts have concluded that
governments may use &quot;post-enactment&quot;  evidence to justify affirmative
action programs. To create a record  of discrimination prior to legislative
action, he recommends the  use of controversial and discredited &quot;disparity
studies:&quot;  &quot;Where  the record is sparse, Congress or the relevant
agency may have to  de
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 17 -->  velop it. That endeavor may
involve the commissioning of  disparity studies of the type that state and local
governments around  the country undertook... to demonstrate that remedial racial
and  ethnic classifications in public contracting are  warranted.&quot;<A

diversity and inclusion&quot; may be constitutional.</B> Contrary  to Justice

past discrimination,<A HREF="ftnt13.htm#39">39</A> Dellinger
insists  that diversity remains an acceptable goal of affirmative  action<A
HREF="ftnt13.htm#40">40</A> and offers several examples of
situations in which  diversity-inspired racial preferences would satisfy the
compelling interest test,  including college admissions, the hiring of
university faculty,  the ownership of broadcast licenses, law enforcement, and

<P><B>Federal Programs That Contain Race or Sex-Based  Preferences</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In February 1995, the Congressional Research Service (CRS)  responded to a
request from Senate Majority Leader Robert Dole  (R-KS) for a comprehensive list
of &quot;every federal statute,  regulation, program, and executive order that
grants a preference to  individuals on the basis of race, sex, national origin,
or ethnic  background.&quot;  Preferences, Senator Dole instructed, &quot;include,
but  are not limited to, timetables, goals, set-asides, and quotas.&quot;

<P>
</P>
<P> The CRS study<A HREF="ftnt13.htm#41">41</A> lists over
160 federal laws, regulations, and  executive orders that contain these
preferences, identifying race  and sex-based preferences that range from 5 to 25
percent. These  pref

levels as 5  percent, 6.9 percent, 8 percent, 10 percent, 12 percent, 15
percent, and  25 percent.

<P><B>Ignoring the Law in Pursuit of Racial and Sex-Based  Preferences - The
Equal Employment Opportunity Commission 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 22 --> 
</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Created by Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, the Equal  Employment
Opportunity Commission (EEOC) enforces the  federal prohibition against
employment discrimination, as well as  prohibitions against discrimination
contained in the Americans with  Disabilities Act, Age Discrimination Act, Equal
Pay Act, and  other civil rights laws. The commission investigates allegations
of  discrimination by individuals, unions, associations, and others and,  if the
claims are not settled out of court, brings civil suit  seeking damages against
responsible parties. Unfortunately, the EEOC  has abused this authority by
assuming that any statistical disparity  between the races in employment results
from discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Does Federal Law Require the EEOC to Use Quotas? The  answer clearly is &quot;No.&quot;
 During floor debate on the Civil Rights Act  of 1964, some Members of the House
questioned whether the  bill's employment provisions would force private-sector
employers  to adopt quotas. Judiciary Committee Chairman Emmanuel  Celler (D-NY)
assured them that &quot;The charge... that the Equal  Employment Opportunity
Commission to be established by Title VII  of the bill would have the power
to... order the hiring and  promotion only of employees of certain races or
religious groups... is  patently false.&quot;  Celler also denied emphatically
that the EEOC would  have the authority to remedy racial or religious imbalances
by  requiring &quot;the hiring of certain people without regard to their 
qualifications simply because they are of a given race or religion.&quot;

In fact, the very  opposite is true. Title VII prohibits discrimination. In
effect, it  says that race, religion, and national origin are not to be used  as
the basis for hiring and firing. Title VII is designed to  encourage hiring on
the basis of ability and qualifications, not  race or religion.<A

employees. EEOC  attorneys demanded that the firm advertise to find blacks who 
might have applied for work there but never did so, and then pay  these
individuals a total of $123,000 in &quot;back pay.&quot;  After  considerable

<P>The EEOC applied a &quot;disparate impact&quot; theory to infer

market (36 percent), even though the firm hired  a higher percentage of black
(16.4 percent) than white (6.1  percent) applicants. A federal appeals court
rejected the EEOC's  claims, concluding that potential black employees faced
high  commuting costs due to the firm's location in a Hispanic and Asian part 
of Chicago and that the company's lack of an English fluency  requirement meant
it naturally would receive a  disproportionate number of applications from
non-English-speaking  applicants. These factors, the court reasoned, were too

<P><B>How Colleges and Universities Employ Racial Preferences </B>

<P>
</P>
<P>The University of Maryland administered a scholarship  program reserved
exclusively for black students that, according to  the Fourth Circuit Court of
Appeals, did not meet the Supreme  Court's strict scrutiny standard for racial
classifications. The Clinton  Administration filed a brief on behalf of the
preference  program. Court documents indicate that between 1990 and 1992, the 
university awarded scholarships to 76 minority students, 42 of whom  had the
financial resources to pay their own way through college.  In fact, the
scholarships exceeded the actual financial need of all  but eight students.<A
HREF="ftnt13.htm#71">71</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In spite of this decision, Judith A. Winston, general counsel at  the
Department of Education, warned all colleges and universities  in September 1995
not to revise &quot;race-targeted aid  programs.&quot;<A
HREF="ftnt13.htm#72">72</A>  She advised that the Clinton
Administration believes that  &quot;race-based student aid is legal... as a
remedy for past discrimination or as  a tool to achieve a diverse student body.&quot;
 It is not surprising,  therefore, to see that race-exclusive policies continue
unchecked at  our major universities.

<P><B>Harvard University's Department of Government,</B> for  example, divides
its applications for its graduate program into two  categories, one for &quot;underrepresented
minorities&quot; and the other for  everyone else. It awards full financial aid
packages to all minorities  regardless of their financial position.
Non-minorities, on the  other hand, must make a specific showing of need. &quot;If
you're a  black, Puerto Rican, Mexican-American, or Native American applicant 
to 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 30 -->  Harvard's graduate program in
government,&quot; Elena Neuman  notes, &quot;your application can be reviewed in
a separate and unequal  process of evaluation, one that excludes all whites. And

<P>Harvard also maintains a separate fund within its Graduate  School of Arts
and Sciences to support minority scholars. Minority  students, even affluent
ones, automatically receive full tuition and  a stipend to cover three years of
expenses; low-income white  students, on the other hand, receive a maximum
stipend of two  years. As summed up by Harvard professor Harvey Mansfield,  &quot;Blacks
are compared with other blacks and not really with whites;  and there are
separate funds as well, the purpose of which is to  keep the professors on the
admissions committee from actually  feeling that they're rejecting someone
better qualified when they  choose on the basis of affirmative action. But, of
course, they are.&quot;

<P>Many corporations, hoping to immunize themselves from  expensive

<P>Two experts who have reviewed the U.S. military's  experience with
affirmative action believe that it could serve as a model  for such programs in
the private sector and other government  agencies. According to former White

</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>     One of the keys to the military's recent 
success...in...dealing with race relations...has been its insistence on each 
recruit's meeting the same employment standards. Virtually every  recruit is
required to have a high school diploma. This policy  is the result of decades of
data demonstrating that high  school achievement as represented by a diploma is
more  predictive than aptitude tests of adaptability to military life and 
likelihood of serving out an entire tour of duty.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>     With the same employment standards required of each  recruit, it should
come as no surprise that the military can  make integration work...Indeed,
notwithstanding the relatively  high minority drop-out rate, the percentage of
blacks in the  military, virtually all of whom have diplomas, is nearly twice 
the national percentage. <A HREF="ftnt13.htm#85">85</A>

As Moskos explains it, the system works  as follows:

<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>     The goal for the number of minorities promoted to the 
next highest rank is based not on the overall number of  minorities in the Army,
but on the number of minorities in the pool  of those qualified for promotion.
The military has no hint of  two promotion lists, whites being compared only
with  whites, blacks only with blacks. From enlistment on up, all  candidates
are held to the same standard.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>     The number of blacks who are promoted from captain to  major, a virtual
prerequisite for an officer seeking an Army  career, is usually below the
goal....The most plausible  explanation is that a disproportionate number of
black officers  lack the writing and communication skills for promotion to 
staff jobs. In all other ranks, including colonel through  general officers,
promotions show little racial differences.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>     Strict maintenance of common standards for  promotion... means that
those who attain senior positions are fully  qualified. Also important, those
blacks who are promoted have  a self-confidence that makes them the strongest
defenders  of standards for their own black subordinates.<A

students  improve an astounding 140 points, bringing them into the same range 
as typical white students.&quot;  Unlike California's Bridge Program,  these
programs are not targeted exclusively at minority soldiers.  Their
beneficiaries, however, are disproportionately  African-American. The bottom
line?  According to Moskos, &quot;no identifiable groups  of

precludes private-sector employers from adopting  the military's version of
affirmative action.  In<I> Griggs</I>, the Court determined that diplomas could

punishing  employers for rewarding academic achievement. More important,  the

workplace rewards for academic  achievement have been abandoned.<A

insofar as they can be interpreted to  put any inhibition on any employer's

 This could be accomplished easily by amending the  rules to provide that &quot;No
funds shall be made available to the EEOC  to implement the Uniform Guidelines

performance from those they know to have been preferred in the process  of
selection. Moreover, affirmative action sometimes leaves  its beneficiaries
uncertain about the basis of their own  accomplishments. Blacks promoted to

</P>
<P>At the beginning of 1995, the issue of racial preferences  attracted

<P>Although racial preferences reach into virtually every aspect  of American
society, legislation currently being considered in  Congress leaves most federal
preference discrimination  untouched. Though the debate no doubt will be
extremely controversial,  success even in this limited area would be unusually

activism of liberal Supreme Courts, which established the current regime  of
legal race privileges. It is proper, therefore, for Congress to  reassert its
constitutional role and restore the timeless principle  of equal treatment under
the law for all Americans by ridding  the public sector of such veiled
restitution and social experimentation.

<P><B>The Dole-Canady Legislation</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In 1996, Congress will consider the Equal Opportunity Act  of 1995,
introduced by Senator Robert Dole (R-KS) and  Representative Charles Canady
(R-FL). This legislation would implement  the <I>Adarand</I> decision by
eliminating race and sex consciousness  from all federal programs and
activities. Professor Carl Cohen of  the University of Michigan has summed up
the philosophical  premise of this legislation:

<BLOCKQUOTE><P>     [M]oral entitlements are not held by groups. Whites as  a
group do not have rights; blacks as a group do not  have rights; rights are
possessed by persons, individual human  persons. And when persons are entitled
to be made whole  for some injury earlier done to them, the duty is owed not  to
members of their race or sex or nationality, not to their  group, but to them as
individuals. The effort to defend preference  as group compensation fails

</P>
<P>What would the Dole-Canady legislation do?  The  Dole-Canady Equal
Opportunity Act of 1995 <A HREF="ftnt13.htm#116">116</A>
seeks to accomplish two  broad goals: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>*     Equal Treatment:</B> &quot;The purpose of this Act is
to ensure that  all Americans are treated equally by the Federal government in 
Federal employment, Federal contracting and subcontracting, and 
Federally-conducted programs.&quot;<A HREF="ftnt13.htm#117">117</A>

</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Equal Opportunity:</B> &quot;The Act endorses those Federal 
`affirmative action' programs that are designed to recruit broadly and widen 
the opportunities for competition without guaranteeing the results  of the
competition.&quot;  At the same time, the bill would eliminate  those federal
activities that create quotas, set-asides, timetables,  goals, 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 47 -->  and other preferences on the
basis of race, color, national origin,  or sex. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The legislation reflects the view that the federal government  must put its
own house in order with respect to racial and gender  preferences. Specifically,
the bill:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Bans race or sex-based preferences in federal programs.</B> The 
federal government, its officers, and its employees would have to  end all
intentional discrimination based &quot;in whole or in part on  race, color,
national origin, or sex&quot; with respect to contracts,  subcontracts, and
employment. In addition, no federal entity would  be allowed to &quot;grant a
preference&quot; to any individual or group on  the basis of race, sex, or
ethnicity. As defined broadly in the  Act, granting a preference includes &quot;any
preferential treatment and  includes but is not limited to any use of a quota,
set-aside,  goal, timetable, or other numerical objective.&quot; 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Prohibits the federal government from encouraging federal 
contractors and subcontractors to adopt race or sex-based preferences.</B>   The
Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs  (OFCCP) would no longer be
allowed to pressure firms that receive  federal contracts or subcontracts to
adopt racial or gender quotas.  Located in the Department of Labor, OFCCP
receives an annual  appropriation of $60 million to monitor the hiring practices
of federal  contractors with respect to race, ethnicity, and sex. Its
jurisdiction  extends to more than $161 billion in annual federal contracting 
activity.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Protects outreach, recruiting, and marketing efforts designed  to
bring more qualified minorities and women to the attention of  em
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 48 -->  ployers, colleges, and
universities.</B> Federal programs that are  targeted on minorities but do not &quot;guarantee
the results of the  competition&quot; would continue in place. One example is a
small program  in the U.S. Department of Agriculture<A
HREF="ftnt13.htm#118">118</A> which provides support  for
campus recruitment and retention programs and agricultural  career awareness
initiatives in order to increase the participation of  minorities in agriculture
without subjecting participating schools  to any numerical goals or timetables.

</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Exempts Historically Black Colleges and Universities  (HCBUs) and
Indian tribes.</B> The federal government sets aside literally  hundreds of
millions of dollars annually for HCBUs and Indian  tribes. While conservatives
ought to question the rationale for these  programs,<A

them alone. 
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P>In short, the Equal Opportunity Act of 1995 would put an  immediate end to
an enormously complex web of race and sex-based  preferences in federal law,
including:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>-     As many as 100 programs in dozens of federal agencies and
 departments that grant preferences to individuals, nonprofit  organizations,
and colleges and universities on the basis of race,  ethnicity, or sex.
Together, these programs receive over $10 billion annually.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>-     Dozens of agency-specific regulations that reach every program  in an
agency's jurisdiction, even where the authorizing law makes  no mention of race
or sex preferences. In addition,  Dole-Canady would put an end to the common
practice of conditioning  federal employee evaluations and bonuses on whether
employers have  met their affirmative action goals. 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 49 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>-     Several government-wide preferences that affect over $161  billion in
federal contracting activity annually, and others that  condition the awarding
of federal licenses and charters  for example,  to banks and broadcasting
facilities  on the recipient's agreeing  to bestow preferences on favored
groups.

</P>
<P><B>WHAT TO DO IN 1997</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Candidates who want to advance a policy of equal treatment  under the law
for all employees, students, and recipients of federal  grants and contracts
would do well to embrace the following  policy changes:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>*     Enact the Dole-Canady Equal Opportunity Act of 1995 
(H.R. 2128/S. 1085).</B> Enactment of this legislation represents the  first
step toward a true policy of equal treatment under the law.  It would end the
federal government's practice of favoring  women and minorities in the
allocation of over $160 billion of federal  contracts; establish race-neutral
and sex-neutral principles in the  hiring, promotion, and evaluation of all
federal employees; end  the imposition of federal racial quotas on
private-sector firms that  do business with the government; and end
discriminatory practices  in the operation of hundreds of federal programs that
award over  $10 billion annually. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Restore the original intent of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.</B> 
The guiding principle behind the Dole-Canady bill  equal  treatment under the
law  must be extended to employees of state and  local governments, colleges and
universities, and all private-sector  employers. To accomplish this, Congress
must restore the  original intent of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 by adding
language that  ech
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 50 -->  oes former Justice Thurgood
Marshall's statement that the  1964 Act &quot;prohibits all racial
discrimination in employment,  without exception for any group of particular
employees.&quot;  Congress  must explicitly forbid courts and administrative
agencies from  construing Title VII of the 1964 Act as authorizing, permitting,
or  encouraging the use of quotas or preferences involving race, color, 
religion, sex, or national origin. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Eliminate race-conscious admissions policies at colleges and 
universities.</B> There is no justification for the proliferation of 
race-exclusive scholarships, special financial assistance programs,  and relaxed
admissions standards for minority students now found  routinely in our colleges
and universities. Congress should  abolish these practices outright. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*    Repeal the EEOC's <I>Uniform Guidelines on Employee  Selection
Procedures</I>.</B> Congress should use its power of the purse to end  the Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission's practice of  using the<I> Uniform
Guidelines</I> to prohibit employers from requiring  employees to meet minimal
educational requirements, such as  possession of a high school diploma.

<P><B>Q &amp; A</B>

<P><B>Q. Would enactment of the Dole-Canady legislation result in  race and
gender neutrality for all Americans? 
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> No. Because the Dole-Canady bill only reaches federal  employees
and federal programs, it would not affect affirmative  action practices that,
thanks to overzealous judges and agency  bureaucrats who have misconstrued the
original intent of the 1964  Civil 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 51 -->  Rights Act, have become the norm
in the private sector, in  state and local government, and at colleges and
universities. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Why do you want to eliminate protections for people who  are
discriminated against?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> In fact, the original Civil Rights legislation in 1964, which  is
still on the books, protects everyone of all races and creeds  from
discrimination. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 still provides  this protection on
an individual basis. It is the courts, through  undue judicial activism, which
have miscontrued the legal application  of these laws to allow racial
preferences for certain favored races  at the expense of others. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>As Justice Scalia stated in his <I>Adarand</I> opinion, there can be  no &quot;debtor
race.&quot;  In order for civil rights to be something other than  a tool for
veiled restitution and retribution, the legal protection  from discrimination
must only attach to individuals on a case by  case basis. Any other application
must result in an unfair system of  racial preferences and government-sponsored
discrimination.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. How can conservatives call for a color blind society when 
discrimination exists?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> It is first important to realize that the federal government is 
limited in its ability to address such social maladies as racial 
discrimination. The best it can do is to end those government  programs that
promote discrimination. Affirmative action programs not  only promote
discrimination; discrimination is the fundamental  principle behind of these
programs.

<P><B><A NAME="ISSUES">THE ISSUES</A></B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>With frustrated Americans focusing their anger increasingly  on Washington
and gridlock, many political candidates in 1994  successfully ran against
Washington, appealing to voters to &quot;throw  the bums out&quot; and replace
them with individuals who are more  honest and more devoted to the public
welfare.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>One result has been that ideas such as devolution and  federalism, ignored
for decades, are back in the forefront of public  debate. Because Washington is
seen as cumbersome, rigid, and  distant from the people, this Congress has
attempted to give the states  and local governments more autonomy and
responsibility in areas  such as welfare. The assumption is that this will
result in greater  experimentation, increased efficiency, and government that
once again  is closer to the people.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Contract With America emphasized the need for  devolution and a shift of
selected responsibilities from Washington to  state and local governments.
However, although devolution in its  many forms may produce benefits in selected
programs, by itself it  will not address the root cause of the many problems
plaguing  American society. The reason: The source of the problem is not an 
inefficient distribution of functions between the different layers of  gov
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 2 -->  ernment, to be corrected by
reshuffling. Nor is it bad people  holding public office, or even poorly
designed programs. The  fundamental problem is systemic: The Constitutional
system  established by the Framers has been largely dismantled, releasing 
government, especially the national government, from virtually all  restraint.
Unconstrained government inevitably has swept aside civil  society, replacing it
with political decisionmaking and  bureaucratic administration unaccountable to
the public. Together, these  have created the conditions within which the
economic and social  problems now burdening society have arisen and flourished. 
Encroachment by Washington also has blocked state and local  governments, as
well as civil society, from initiating innovative responses  to those problems.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>This has resulted in four dilemmas, all of which require action:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>First,</B> the central purpose of the Constitution  limiting the  power
of government  has been forgotten, and many of the  mechanisms for enforcing
those limits have been dismantled.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Second,</B> the states  the key element in the American  constitutional
system  have been stripped of the ability to carry out  their constitutional
responsibility of checking and balancing the  national government, and this has
allowed Washington to assume an  unlimited and unchallengeable role in the
economy, in society, and  in the lives of individuals.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Third,</B> the resulting centralization of power in Washington and  the
unchecked expansion of its reach have undermined the  institutions of civil
society and thereby severely weakened the ability of  the people to exercise
self-government. Washington has replaced  civil 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 3 -->  society with bureaucratic
rulemaking and administration  from above, and<B> </B>has<B> </B>made
decisionmaking in all areas of public  and private life more responsive to
political factors  and<B> </B>ideologies than to empirical results and the
preferences of the citizenry. In  addition, centralization has insulated
decisionmaking from  participation by the very people most directly affected by
government  programs.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Fourth,</B> the federal judiciary has permitted, even mandated,  an
open-ended expansion of power by the national government,  arrogating to itself
the role of legislature of last resort and imposing  a liberal agenda explicitly
and repeatedly rejected by the electorate.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><A NAME="FACTS">THE FACTS</A></B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The national government's rise to dominance has taken  many years. Some
steps, such as the popular election of Senators,  occurred for entirely
democratic reasons and with full public  support; others, such as the weakening
of the criminal justice system,  were accomplished by sleight of hand and
against solid public  opposition. Taken together, they constitute a virtual
rewriting of the  Constitution, the impact of which has yet to be fully
appreciated.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>What the Framers Intended</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>A fundamental assumption of the Framers of the Constitution  was that the
American people were and would continue to be  largely self-governing, running
their own affairs by means of the  network of social relationships and voluntary
organizations  collectively known as civil society, such as families,
communities,  and churches. Government, especially local government  controlled

<!-- Generation of PM publication page 4 -->  directly by the community, was
seen as a necessary ally of  civil society. But it was restricted to those
limited functions which  civil society could not easily perform for itself, such
as defense,  the police, and the coining of money. The purpose of government 
was to secure an environment within which free people would  control their own
affairs: in other words, an environment that makes  possible the individual &quot;pursuit
of happiness.&quot;
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>In writing the Constitution, the Framers had two objectives:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>1)  To correct the failings of the Articles of Confederation,  due
largely to the states' domination of a weak national  government.</B> Thus, a
new national government was created with sufficient  powers to carry out a
limited number of crucial functions, such as  the regulation of international
and interstate commerce, and to  prevent the states from interfering in these
areas.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>2)  To limit the power of the new national government.</B>  Having
fought a revolution against what they defined as tyranny   the unchecked
exercise of power, regardless of motive  their  second, and far more important,
objective was to prevent its  reemergence from their own handiwork. They
therefore spent the bulk of  their deliberations on devising ways to limit the
power of the  national government.
</P>
<P>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Trusting neither the written word of the Constitution nor  self-restraint on
the part of officeholders to enforce the necessary  limits, the Framers devised
a complex system of checks and balances  in which various political actors were
placed deliberately in  permanent opposition to one another. This tension was
intended to  ensure that the energies and ambitions of the respective  groups 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 5 -->  would be directed against one
another, thereby protecting  civil society from unwanted interference. The best
known of these  safeguards  the division of the national government into three 
competing branches: executive, legislative, and judicial  has  proven both
effective and durable despite two centuries of change.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>The Central Role of Federalism</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Even more essential to the intent of the Constitution were the  several
checks and balances between the national government and  the states, and the
division of power between them, a wholly new  system which came to be called
federalism. Despite the crucial  role assigned to it, however, federalism
remains widely misunderstood.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Federalism is commonly defined as the division of powers  among the federal,
state, and local governments according to which  performs them best. For
example, the national government has  general responsibility for defense; the
states, for most prisons  and roads; and local governments, for schools. Certain
powers, such  as taxation and the regulation of commerce, are shared. Advocates 
of federalism often assert that this division of powers is more  efficient than
centralizing all functions in Washington, and that  innovative approaches to
problems are more likely to emerge from  the experiments of 50 state governments
than from a monolithic  national bureaucracy. In addition, proponents generally 
emphasize the need to keep government as close to the people as possible  by
keeping its functions at the lowest possible level.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>However, all of these arguments in favor of federalism are  subsidiary to
its central purpose: limiting the power of government at  all levels. The
national and state governments were intended to  con
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 6 -->  strain one another, not to work
hand-in-glove or parcel out  functions to that level of government which will
perform them  best. Thus, the new government was given the power to prevent  the
states from abusing their authority through such actions as  erecting trade
barriers against one another, and national legislation  was given preeminence
over state and local law in those limited  areas reserved to the national
government. In turn, the states were  expected to constrain Washington, as they
were regarded as the  only effective means of doing so.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>So crucial was the role of the states in limiting the  national government's
power that the Framers provided them with  several safeguards, including:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>*     A direct role</B> in the making of all laws and the
appointment of  all federal officials, including federal judges, through a
Senate  composed of members appointed by the states;
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     The ability to block</B> all constitutional amendments proposed 
by Congress and to bypass an out-of-touch national government  altogether by
means of a constitutional convention; and
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     A written guarantee</B> against Washington's assumption of 
additional powers in the form of the blunt and sweeping language  of the Tenth
Amendment, which reserved all powers not delegated  to the national government
by the Constitution either to the states  or to the people.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>How the Safeguards Were Dismantled</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>This carefully constructed system remained largely intact for  over 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 7 -->  100 years; but beginning in the
early part of this century, the  ability of the states to perform their
constitutional role of limiting  the national government has been progressively
reduced to the  point that it has been virtually eliminated.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The process was a lengthy and complex one, but its principal  landmarks
were:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>*     The ratification in 1913 of the 16th and 17th
Amendments,</B>  which removed key restraints on the national government by
giving  it unlimited taxing authority and by mandating that Senators were  to be
elected by popular vote rather than selected by state  legislatures. As a
result, Washington secured the resources necessary  for an open-ended expansion
of its functions even as the states  were removed from the making of national
policy and eliminated as  the principal bulwark against expansion by the
national government.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     The national emergencies of the Depression, World War II,  and the
Cold War,</B> which legitimized political forces arguing  for greater power at
the national level to deal with domestic and  international problems. The powers
and functions assumed by  Washington in times of emergency have remained long
after their  original justification has passed. In fact, many of the emergency 
powers of the 1930s were vastly expanded in the 1960s and 1970s in  such
programs as the Great Society and the War on Poverty, each  of which further
increased Washington's power by giving it an  activist leading role in areas of
the economy and society never  before assumed by any level of government.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Beginning in 1937, the Supreme Court's abandonment of its 
traditional role of enforcing limits</B> laid out in the Constitution through  a
series of decisions that have removed virtually all  constitutional 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 8 -->  restraints on the national
government. The power of the  national government to regulate interstate
commerce, for example, has  been interpreted as being virtually unlimited,
extending to virtually  every area of the economy and society; the Tenth
Amendment,  in effect, has been gutted.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Beginning in the 1950s, in pursuit of what its advocates  have
called a &quot;judicial revolution,&quot;</B> the Supreme Court's radical 
alteration of established interpretations of rights guaranteed by  the
Constitution, with some vastly expanded, others restricted,  and still others
simply invented. This judicial activism has  transformed the Court into an
unelected &quot;super legislature,&quot; effectively  unbound by any restraints.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Judicial Activism</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Judicial activism now extends to all areas of public and private  life
because the Supreme Court and the federal judiciary have  succeeded in granting
themselves virtually unlimited power.  Federal, state, and local laws, duly
enacted by elected officials, have  been struck down; state and local government
functions such as  schools and prisons have been taken over by the federal
courts and  subjected to their increasingly minute direction; and state

<P>Calculating the economic costs stemming from the demise of  federalism and
the expansion of the national government is  difficult, if only because of the
enormity of the task. These costs  include reduced economic growth for the
nation as a whole through  heavy taxation, burdensome regulation of businesses,
and the  skewed investment of resources.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>*</B>     As programs have expanded to cover all areas of
national life,  the federal budget has grown commensurately, both in terms of 
taxpayer dollars and as a percentage of the national economy.  In 1934, the
national government accounted for 10 percent of  gross domestic product (GDP).
In 1948, it was still only 12 percent.  By 1960, however, it had ballooned to 18
percent, and by 1994, to  22 percent.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     The tax burden also has necessarily expanded. In 1914, the 
first year of the federal income tax, Americans making from $4,000  to $20,000
were taxed 1 percent of their incomes. The rate  gradually increased to 7
percent for Americans making over $500,000.  Because those making over $4,000 in
1914 accounted for less than  1 percent of the population, the average family
paid no income  tax. Even by 1950, following the expansion of the national 
government during and after the New Deal, the average American family  with two
children paid only 3 percent of its income to the federal  government. In 1994,
federal taxes accounted for 24 percent of a  typical family's income.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     Though taxation has increased dramatically since World War 
II, 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 12 -->  spending has grown even faster. A
1991 study prepared for  the Joint Economic Committee found that for every $1
increase  in taxes since the end of World War II, expenditures have  grown
$1.59. The national debt now stands at $4.9 trillion,  representing more than
$18,500 for every man, woman, and child in the  country  an obligation that will
be paid by every individual and  family through higher taxes and lower living
standards.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     Roughly one-third of the average family's income tax today  is
used merely to pay interest on the national debt, a significant  reduction in
standard of living for which that family receives no  benefits. Much of this
debt and tax burden is used to subsidize  special interests with political clout
in Washington, from millionaire  peanut farmers to the affluent elderly.
</P>
<P>

<P><B>*</B>     By contrast, 49 of the 50 states are required to balance their
 budgets every year, making the perennial accumulation of debt  difficult if not
impossible. Although all opinion polls show that there  is overwhelming public
support for a balanced budget amendment  to the Constitution, every attempt to
have Congress pass the  measure has failed. Powerful special interests lobby
behind closed  doors against any proposal which would force Washington to cut 
spending, and the government continues to borrow money and  obligate future

the states billions each year. The cost of incarcerating prisoners is 
especially burdensome. For the seven states most affected by  illegal
immigration (Arizona, California, Florida, Illinois, New  Jersey, New York, and

<P><B>II. The High Cost to Democracy</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>More difficult to calculate, but nevertheless far-reaching, are  the high
costs to democracy that stem from the demise of  federalism. An oft-repeated
description of the American system of  government is that it is a &quot;government
of laws, not of men,&quot; meaning that  the rules which govern society are
openly formulated, apply equally  to all, and are reliably stable over time.
Laws are made by  citizens and their elected representatives; they are not
supposed to be  subject to the whims of individuals.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>However, this characterization is no longer accurate. Even as  federal power
over the economy, society, and all facets of  public policy has grown, the
concentration of decisionmaking in  Washington has radically reduced the ability
of the public to affect  it. Whereas the American people once were described
routinely  as 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 18 -->  self-governing and self-reliant,
it is now virtually impossible  for individuals or communities to influence the
decisions which  directly affect them. Distant rule-making bureaucracies are 
immune from local pressure; Congress is overrun with powerful and  well-heeled
interest groups; and enormous coalitions of citizens  are required to get even
rudimentary attention from Washington.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>As local and state governments have been reduced increasingly  to the role
of implementing federal decisions, elections for them  have lost most of their
importance. Regardless of who holds office,  and regardless of the electorate's
intentions when electing these  officials, Washington need pay attention to none
of them as it  imposes programs on state and local governments. Governor Ben 
Nelson (D-NE) has said that he often feels he is merely an  administrator for
the federal government, and Governor Michael Leavitt  (R-UT) has noted that his
constituents, when referring to government,  now think almost exclusively in
terms of Washington, not state or  local government. National elections, in
turn, are not about  individual issues, but about large combinations of them,
with the  individual voter unable to register his preferences. And each voter's 
choice must compete with those of 100 million others. With their  votes meaning
so little in terms of how decisions are made, it is not  surprising that the
percentage of the electorate which goes to the  polls has declined steadily over
decades.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>As the power of citizens has declined, however, that of  certain individuals
has grown. Committee chairmen in the House and  Senate, unelected staff, obscure
bureaucrats, and federal judges  wield vast powers which are often exercised out
of the public's  eye. Hundreds of bills with thousands of prescriptions,
allotments,  and prohibitions are passed each year, often with Members of  Con
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 19 -->  gress having only the haziest of
ideas about their content. An  endless stream of special interests brings
enormous financial and  organizational capacities to bear on Congress and the
executive  branch  often to secure enactment of agendas these interests know 
the public would not support if given the opportunity to decide  for themselves.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>The Untethered Judiciary</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Even if elected officials could be made more responsive to  the public's
preferences, however, they would remain subject to  the unelected judges of the
federal courts. The Supreme Court and  the federal judiciary as a whole have
arrogated to themselves a  dominant role in every public and private institution
in society.  Federal judges have taken charge of wide areas of state and local 
jurisdiction and imposed on them their own dictates, from which there  is little
appeal. Individual judges overturn and rewrite laws,  suspend whole sections of
state constitutions, impose detailed  mandates, order actions by officials at
all levels, and even mandate the  imposition of taxes on populations which
refuse to vote for them.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>No area of American life can escape detailed examination and  reconstruction
by the Supreme Court. Members of the Court  are bound by little but their own
self-restraint. Cynics often say  that the Constitution is whatever the Supreme
Court says it is. In  fact, no less an authority than Chief Justice Charles
Evans  Hughes stated in a 1907 speech: &quot;We are under a Constitution, but 
the Constitution is what the judges say it is.&quot;  But the reality is  even
worse: It is whatever any five of the Court's nine justices say it  is. A 5 to 4
decision one day can be abruptly reversed the next;  what was once legal may
become illegal, and vice versa;  wrenching 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 20 -->  changes can be produced by the
replacement of a single  individual on the Court, or even by a change of opinion
by any one of  the justices, regardless of the language of the Constitution or
the  preferences of the public.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Long-established rights may be cast aside, while newly  mined ones are put
in their place. No law, constitutional provision,  popular referendum, community
standard, or tradition, regardless of  its support among the people or their
elected officials, has any  meaning or standing other than that which the
federal courts choose  to give it. All may be set aside, and the public has no
recourse. It  is for this reason that the once-routine confirmations of  Supreme
Court justices have become brutal political contests.

<P><B>III. The High Costs to Civil Society</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Of all the costs produced by the demise of federalism, the  greatest have
been those associated with the breakdown of civil society:  the individuals,
families, communities, and voluntary  organizations and institutions which
together enable individuals to control  the environment in which they, their
families, and their  communities live and operate.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>For the Framers, the purpose of government was to establish  and secure the
general environment within which civil society  could operate essentially
unmolested. Within this environment, the  array of social institutions would
regulate the public aspects of the  community and intrude in the lives of
individuals and families as  little as possible. Government, especially local
government  controlled by the adult citizenry, was essential to maintaining this
order,  but only if its power was limited to narrow purposes. It was well 
understood that the more distant the government, the less control  the 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 23 -->  citizens would have over its
actions, and thus the more damage  it could do.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Once the national government had freed itself from its  constitutional
restraints, however, its rapid expansion inevitably  undermined civil society,
because the purpose of expanded  government is to substitute itself for civil
society. The national government,  in centralizing power, inevitably has taken
control away from  citizens and communities and replaced it with  political
decisionmaking and bureaucratic administration. It also has  forcibly replaced
civil society's home-grown workings with its  own political and bureaucratic
vision of how society should be  structured and run, and with devastating costs.
Unconstrained  government and civil society cannot coexist; their respective 
resources are too unequal to permit competition. When government  expands,
society must retreat.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The result has been a broad decline in civilized life, especially  in the
nation's cities where government activism has been  greatest. Among the results:
vastly increased crime and violence, a  breakdown of public order, a decline in
community life, erosion of  the family, the rise of illegitimacy, and the
pervasive mediocrity  of public education, among other ills.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Social scientists profess bafflement at the emergence and  continuation of
these developments. Among the most common  explanations: America is an
inherently violent society, there has been  a &quot;war on the poor&quot;
stemming from hard-hearted budget cutters,  or endemic racism prevents progress.
The true source, however,  can be located directly in the engineered demise of
civil society and  its replacement by the federal government. Individuals,
families,  and 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 24 -->  communities have been stripped of
the ability to control  either their environment or the behavior of individuals
within it.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>The Rise in Crime</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The rate of violent crime in the U.S. has risen dramatically   over 400
percent since the late 1950s. Some of this is attributable to  the increase in
the population aged 15-30, the age group  responsible for the vast majority of
felonies. But if demographics were the  sole factor, the rate should have
plummeted in the 1980s along  with this segment's share of the population. It
did not, and other  countries with similar demographics did not experience the
same rise  in crime. Liberals claim the reason is widespread availability of 
guns in the United States, but gun ownership has been common in  the United
States since the country's inception. Moreover, other  societies, such as
peaceable Switzerland, that actually require all  able-bodied men to maintain
guns in their homes experience no  upsurge in drive-by shootings. Why, then, the
vast and rapid increase in  the rate of violent crime in the U.S. and its
continuance at such  high levels?
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>There are two reasons. One is the breakdown in family structure  in America 
itself exacerbated by federal policies (see Chapter  6). The other is the
Supreme Court's radical reconstruction of  the criminal justice system in the
U.S., an all-embracing  exercise weighted consistently toward restricting the
policing power  of communities. Beginning in the 1960s, federal courts began 
viewing law enforcement, rather than criminals, as the principal  threat to
public safety and set out to restrict the power of police to  arrest criminals,
the ability of the judicial system to convict them,  and the right of society to
put and keep them behind bars. The  courts 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 25 -->  vastly expanded, and even
invented, rights for criminals which,  if not actually written in the
Constitution, were held by the courts  to be &quot;inspired&quot; by its &quot;penumbras.&quot;
 However lofty this  solicitude for the rights of criminals may be, its
real-world impact has  been to create an America much more dangerous and violent
for  law-abiding citizens.<A HREF="ftnt14.htm#12">12</A>

<P>To curb alleged coercion of defendants, the Supreme Court  has virtually
eliminated the ability of state and federal prosecutors  to use confessions by
the accused as evidence. In the mid-1960s,  with the Court's imposition of
arbitrarily detailed procedures for  arrest and investigation, the rate of
solved crimes plummeted  virtually overnight from the level of 70 percent in the
1950s to 40  percent, and hundreds of thousands of felons were never prosecuted 
even though ample evidence was available. In addition, severe  restrictions have
been placed on the collection of evidence; trials  increasingly focus not on the
defendant's innocence or guilt, but  on whether the police have adhered
sufficiently to procedural  minutiae.

entire prison systems have been  taken over by the federal courts. Ostensibly to
eliminate  &quot;overcrowding,&quot; tens of thousands of prisoners have been
released onto  the streets. But &quot;overcrowding&quot; has never been
consistently  defined, so each judge is free to define it for himself on an
entirely  subjective basis. To several judges, therefore, it means not groups 
of prisoners crammed into single cells, but simply more than  one prisoner to a
cell, however large. Some federal judges even  refuse to allow convicted felons
to be sent to prison in the first place  because of &quot;overcrowding&quot; and
simply release them, even those  convicted of violent crimes and repeat
offenders. These released  felons have been responsible for tens of thousands of
additional  violent crimes.

<P>The federal courts have demonstrated an amazing solicitude  for the small
minority of felons who actually reach prison, being  especially attentive to
suits claiming violations of the  Eighth Amendment's prohibition of &quot;cruel
and unusual punishment.&quot;   To help prisoners develop and file these claims,
the federal  courts have ruled that prisoners must be provided with 
state-of-the-art law libraries in their prisons, and even with law clerks. 
Arizona Attorney General Grant Woods has said that the law libraries  in state
prisons are equipped with better services and resources  than those in his own
office.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>As a result, the number of suits by prisoners claiming violations  of
constitutional rights has exploded in recent decades.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In 1966, prisoners brought 218 suits in federal court for  alleged
constitutional violations in state and federal prisons. In 1993,  prisoners
filed over 53,000 suits, primarily against state prisons,  representing 25
percent of all cases handled in federal courts and  7,000 more suits than the
federal government itself filed against  criminals. Most of this litigation is
frivolous  inmates have sued,  for example, because they were given creamy
instead of chunky  peanut butter, were denied breast implants at public expense,
or  did not like the color of their cells  and ultimately are dismissed  by the
courts. But the cost to the taxpayers is still heavy, as the  state must treat
each case seriously lest it be lost by default.  Generally, 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 29 -->  prisoners pay no fees, claiming
indigent status.

<P>Keith Poladian, an inmate in New York's Auburn state  prison, brought suit

<P>It is little wonder that most criminals show a psychology of  denial for
their criminal actions. Nevada Deputy Attorney General  Anne Cathcart says
criminals &quot;come into prison denying any  wrongdoing, and they are
constantly presented with further reasons  to blame others. Unlimited access to
federal courts gives them  an added tool to vent their anger and rebel against
the system.&quot;   But that is only one element. The total effect of the
federal courts  on the criminal justice system has been staggering. Thanks to a 
succession of messages to the potential felon  you won't be  arrested, you won't
be convicted, your sentence will be cut short,  prison isn't really so bad, and
your rights in prison are superior to  those of the administration, for example 
deterrence has been all  but destroyed. Even violent felons remain on the
streets, free to  commit crimes. Far from having a mysterious source, the 
enormous upsurge in crime was all but inevitable.

<P>The streets of the nation's cities have become a permanent  home for tens of

this alleged lack of shelter is due not to the  hard-heartedness of budget
cutters, but to the fact that up to  three-
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 31 -->  fourths of America's homeless are
mentally ill or  drug-dependent and unable to care for themselves. The advent of
drugs in  the 1950s and 1960s led to the widespread closing of institutions 
that cared for the mentally ill on the assumption that drug therapy  had
eliminated most of the need for institutionalization. At the  same time, in
addition to destroying viable communities, federal  urban renewal projects
eliminated much of the housing space available  to the very poor. Much of this
lost housing has been replaced by  shelters and other facilities, but many of
these people refuse to live  in shelters, citing endemic violence, drug use, and
corruption,  and many more individuals are clearly incapable of making  rational
choices for themselves. Community efforts to bring the  homeless into shelters
have been blocked by the federal courts because  of alleged violations of civil
rights; freedom of assembly is  claimed by those permanently squatting in public

<P><B>THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Clinton Administration has a mixed record, at best, in the  area of
reducing the power of the federal government and  devolving power back to the
states. Clinton has assisted states in  accelerating the waiver process whereby
state welfare and health care  agencies can receive exemptions from a host of
federal requirements as  they attempt novel approaches to welfare and health
care reforms.  Unfortunately, most governors are still frustrated at the slow 
granting of waivers by the Administration and many believe the entire  process
is flawed in that they are seeking exemptions from  federal 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 32 -->  laws they believe to be an
encroachment on state prerogatives.  For instance, the Clinton Administration's
proposal in 1994 to  revamp the nation's health care system envisioned a
diminishing role  for the states, which would merely administer a national
system  created and directed from Washington. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In areas such as environmental protection and federal  land-use policy, the
Clinton Administration has continued to support  a growing federal role and has
resisted attempts by the states to  devolve powers back to them. For instance,
this is most  evident among Western states, where Interior Secretary Bruce
Babbitt  has been promoting an overarching policy of environmental  protection
that dramatically increases the power of the federal government  in land-use
policy in federal, state-owned, and private lands. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>To the extent the Administration has even focused on federalism  it has
missed the true meaning of the word. For instance, Vice  President Al Gore's
calls for a &quot;New Federalism&quot;are embodied in  his efforts to streamline
and reinvent the federal government  through its National Performance Review.
Regardless of the merits of  the National Performance Review  which attempts to
make the  federal government more efficient through downsizing and 
restructuring  it has had little if anything to do with reestablishing a 
balance between the state and federal governments.

<P>
</P>
<P>The 104th Congress has taken important first steps in the areas  of
devolution, federalism, and the restoration of constitutional  government. Under
the Contract With America, it passed  legislation that turns over most
responsibility for welfare to the states  and 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 33 -->  allows them more flexibility and
authority in the administration  of welfare programs. Even more important, it
has put the country  on course for a balanced budget in seven years. While not
strictly  an issue of federalism, bringing spending under control is a 
prerequisite both for reimposing limits on government's ambitions and  for
rebuilding civil society. The federal government also has agreed  to reimburse
the states for part of the education, health care,  and other costs associated
with the incarceration of illegal aliens.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In addition, a number of pending bills and resolutions are  designed to make
the federal government more responsive to its  constitutional limits. These
include requiring Congress to cite its  constitutional authority for each piece
of legislation, restricting the  ability of the federal judiciary to take over
state administrative  functions, and eliminating agencies of the federal
government which  exercise &quot;powers not delegated to the United States by
the  Constitution,&quot; among other proposals.

<P><B>WHAT TO DO IN 1997</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Correcting the many problems confronting American society  will involve more
than isolated reforms; a lasting solution will  require dealing with their root
causes, especially the federal  government's crushing impact on civil society.
This means more than  merely resurrecting the past. Too much has changed to
permit a  simple repeal of the many constitutional innovations of the preceding 
decades, and powerful and well-entrenched groups with  economic, political, and
ideological interests at stake are certain to resist  any change which
diminishes the power of Washington to reward  them from the public treasury and
impose their agendas on the rest  of 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 34 -->  the country. Instead, new
approaches must be developed that  draw on the lessons learned in this century
about Washington's ability  to free itself, Houdini-like, from almost any
constraint.
</P>
<P><B><CITE>-</CITE>     Devolve power to the states by returning taxes, not
just programs.
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Contract With America has taken the essential first step  in reversing
the trend toward centralization of power in  Washington by curtailing some
entitlements and allowing states greater  discretion over welfare and other
programs, but several additional  measures are needed to ensure its success.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Under current plans, the principal funding for programs  devolved to the
states will continue to be through block grants from  Washington. Although the
states gain flexibility, this formula  undermines accountability because the
federal government collects  the money but state and local governments spend it.
As a result,  the public is less able to connect the collection of taxes with
the  provision of services, and neither level of government has  sufficient
incentive to ensure that the money is spent wisely and frugally.  A far better
approach would be for Washington to bow out of  the picture entirely and return
the money to the people in the form of  a tax cut. The states could collect the
taxes themselves   and thereby assure a direct connection between taxes and
services   or allow individuals to retain the money for their own use. If this 
is not done, the likely consequence is that rising budgetary  pressures will
lead Washington simply to maintain current federal  requirements on the states
to deliver services while cutting back on  the federal grants to fund them.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The principal argument for continuing a federal role in these  programs is
that it assures equality of treatment for recipients,  regard
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 35 -->  less of whether they live in
high-income or low-income  states. This argument is based on a misunderstanding
of the actual  impact of federal spending. Federal funding for individual
programs  often does vary widely from state to state, but those variations 
largely disappear when a broader range of programs is considered.  For example,
if responsibility for the more than 70 programs that  comprise federal welfare
spending was turned over to the states  along with a broad reduction in the
federal income tax, only a few  states would be adversely affected, and none by
more than 5 percent  of current revenue. And this does not take into account
money  that states could save by providing services more efficiently.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>It is also important for candidates to stress that devolution is  not
necessarily federalism. While state-friendly legislation passed  by Congress is
a marked improvement over past practice, the  current debate and decisionmaking
on devolution have been  conducted almost entirely from Washington's point of
view. The programs  to be transferred will continue to be subject to conditions
imposed  by the federal government, which can change them unilaterally at  its
discretion to suit its own needs. And Washington will retain  the ability to
reverse or modify its grant at any time. Devolution  is evidence not that
Washington has been restrained, but merely  that it has changed its mind.

<P>
</P>
<P><B><CITE>-</CITE>     Hold a constitutional convention on federalism.
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Calling a convention to propose amendments to the Constitution  is the route
most favored by those who seek a quick and  comprehensive solution to the
problem of Washington's overreaching.  Two-thirds of the state legislatures may
call a constitutional  convention by petitioning Congress to do so, a provision
the Framers  included 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 36 -->  both to deny Congress a monopoly
on proposing amendments  and to prevent it from insulating itself from the
public will.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In the two centuries since the Constitution's adoption, there  have been
several efforts to call a convention. The most notable  attempts in recent
decades include an effort in the 1960s to  overturn the Supreme Court's revision
of state constitutions regarding  the structure of state legislatures and
several efforts concerning a  balanced budget amendment, the most successful of
which reached  32 states by 1983.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The principal reason these and other efforts have not succeeded  is fear
that a &quot;runaway&quot; convention might lead to an extensive  rewriting of
the Constitution. But opponents generally do not  take into account the fact
that any amendment proposed by a  convention is exactly that: merely a proposal.
To become part of the  Constitution, it must be ratified by the same
three-fourths of the  state legislatures required for the approval of any
amendment put  forth by Congress.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Opponents also ignore the fact that, in effect, two permanent 
constitutional conventions already exist: Congress, which can  propose an
amendment on any subject at any time, and the Supreme  Court. Although the Court
technically has no role in the amending  process, its rulings repeatedly have
had the same effect, adding  and deleting sections as the justices see fit.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Opposing a convention called by the states merely ensures  that Congress and
the Supreme Court  and thus Washington   retain their monopoly on changing the
Constitution while denying  the states and citizens any real opportunity to
participate. This  position 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 37 -->  is understandable in those who
wish to keep power centralized  in Washington but somewhat perplexing when held
by  conservatives and others who profess a desire to restrict the federal 
government. Given the opposition, however, calls for a constitutional 
convention are not likely to be successful without considerable  public
education.

</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Efforts to revive the Tenth Amendment occupy a special place  in the
movement to restore federalism. The Tenth Amendment is  the &quot;federalism
amendment,&quot; a written contractual guarantee  against the expansion of
federal power. It has not performed as  intended because the political and other
mechanisms designed to make  it effective have been removed and because the
Supreme Court  has been allowed to render it null and void.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Indications that the Supreme Court may revive the Amendment,  at least in a
limited fashion, are easily exaggerated. In a  recent case,<A
HREF="ftnt14.htm#22">22</A> the Supreme Court made headlines
by ruling that the  states cannot always be used as simple administrative arms
of the  federal government. This was the first time in six decades that the 
Tenth Amendment had been used to restrict federal power, but even  this
vestigial application was decided by a very narrow majority (5  to 4) and can be
reversed at any time.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>A grass-roots movement to revive the Tenth Amendment has  been gathering
strength. Several state legislatures have passed  resolutions stating their view
that the Amendment remains fully in  effect, with several going further to
demand that the federal  govern
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 38 -->  ment abide by its provisions.
However, this has occurred in  a largely uncoordinated and low-key manner, and
little  political pressure has been brought to bear on Washington.

<P>Though Congress has been an egregious violator of federalism,  it also has
the power to reverse its own excesses and curb those  of the executive and
judicial branches as well. The most  prominent effort in this regard is the
Contract With America's commitment  to returning to the states many functions
now performed by the  federal government, such as the primary responsibility for
 welfare. Efforts in other, more specific areas need to be made as well.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Unwilling to part with its own money, Congress often has  resorted to
requiring state and local governments to pay for programs  that Washington
enacts and for which it takes the credit. Faced with  a growing revolt in the
states because of the unsustainable  burden these mandates impose on state
budgets, Congress in 1994  passed the Unfunded Mandates Act, advertised as
largely solving  the problem. However, the scope of the Act is very limited, 
covering only new mandates while leaving the truly burdensome  existing ones in
place. More important, the legislation puts no real  restraints on Congress at
all, as it requires Congress merely to  label an unfunded mandate as such before
enactment.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>As pressures on the federal budget increase, Congress may  be tempted to use
unfunded mandates to transfer responsibilities  for certain programs to the
states while keeping all or most of  the funding in Washington to balance the
federal books. States  and local communities need to close this gaping loophole

<!-- Generation of PM publication page 41 -->  its monopoly on proposing
amendments to the Constitution.  However, amending Article V to allow the states
to propose  amendments without calling a convention, but subject to a 
congressional veto on such amendments, could overcome this obstacle.  Amendments
approved by Congress would be reintroduced in the  states for the three-fourths
approval needed to adopt an amendment  to the Constitution.

</P>
<P>The principal factor in the demise of federalism and the growth  of
government in Washington is the undermining of the states'  ability to act as a
counterweight to the national government. The  states have been reduced to
subservience for so long that most have  lost the incentive to challenge
Washington and concentrate instead  on lobbying for better treatment.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The principal problem confronting the states is fragmentation: 
Individually, states cannot have much influence in Washington;  only by
combining their efforts can they bring to bear the political  pressure needed to
deal with Washington as equals.  Unfortunately, however, the existing
organizations that serve state officials,  such as the National Governors'
Association (NGA), have not  succeeded in promoting an independent and effective
voice.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>A number of efforts in this area have been made in recent  years, the most
notable being the Conference of the States. Initiated  by Governors Mike Leavitt
(R-UT) and Ben Nelson (D-NE) in  1994 and joined by the NGA and other
organizations, along with  scores of state officials, the COS was designed to
create a process  by which the states could meet, discuss their common problems 
and 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 42 -->  recommended solutions, and bring
their collective influence  to bear on Washington.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>For many reasons, the COS was not able to achieve the goals  it laid out for
itself, but some similar effort would prove to be  invaluable to the states in
their dealings with Washington.  Among the possible steps:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>*     Suits against the federal government.</B> Several
states have  initiated or are contemplating suits against the federal government
 for abuse of its authority, especially on Tenth Amendment  grounds. Arizona
leads this effort; the legislature voted in 1994 to  establish a Constitutional
Defense Council and appropriated $1 million  for this purpose.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Mandates recall.</B> Beginning with Alabama in 1992, a number  of
state legislatures have established annual meetings between  themselves and
members of their congressional delegations to  review the latter's votes on
unfunded federal mandates. Although  the states cannot compel attendance or
attentiveness, there is a  certain political cost for those who simply ignore
such requests, and  the meetings do provide a way for both sides to air their 
respective concerns.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P>Far more should be done to reconnect the state legislatures to  the making
of national policy. It once was common for state  legislatures to instruct their
representatives in Washington on how to  vote on particular issues, even if the
latter chose to ignore them.  On issues which affect a state, its legislature
certainly has at least  as much claim to represent the interests of the people
as does  any federal representative, and it should not hesitate to make its 
views 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 43 -->  known.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Term limits.</B> An additional area for emphasis is imposing  term
limits on federal officials, the theory being that a guaranteed  turnover will
reduce the opportunities for elected officials to  insulate themselves from the
voters and guarantee a continuing infusion  of individuals who are closer to the
people. Term limits by  themselves, however, will neither constrain Washington's
power  nor erect a permanent barrier to activism, even on the part of 
short-termers. More important, the Supreme Court has ruled that  the people have
no right to impose term limits on federal officials,  and proponents are now
seeking other ways  including a  constitutional amendment  to advance this
objective.(See table below)

<P>
</P>
<P><B><A NAME="Q&A">Q&amp;A</A>
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 48 --> 
</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q.What is the difference between devolution and federalism  and can they
contradict one another?  
</B></P>
<P><B>A.</B> Devolution legislation in Congress has dealt primarily  with
granting greater flexibility and decision-making authority to  state and local
governments in specific programs such as welfare.  Federalism, in contrast, is
concerned with the structure of  government as a whole and deals with the proper
balance that should exist  between the state governments and the national
government as  outlined in the U.S. Constitution. Current efforts to devolve 
selected powers from Washington to the states, however beneficial,  will have
only a small impact on the balance of power between  the federal and state
governments; Washington's primacy will  remain largely unaltered. For example,
the debate and  decision-making regarding devolution have been almost entirely
the product of  the Congress; state and local officials have played only 
secondary roles. As a result, the design and extent of the affected  programs
reflect Washington's preferences far more than those of the  states, and even
the devolved responsibilities remain subject to  unilateral revision by the
federal government. Devolution concerns the  reapportioning between the federal
and state governments of the  responsibility for current programs; federalism
addresses the  means by which Washington and the states can be made to limit 
each other's power.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Are there issues too important to entrust to state governments?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> The domination of the national government by the states  under
the Articles of Confederation produced such chaos that the  Framers of the
Constitution sought to permanently redress the  balance. As a result, the
Constitution lists several powers reserved to  the national government and makes
its laws superior to those of  the 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 49 -->  states in these areas. That grant
of power, however, is strictly  limited. The Constitution specifies procedures
for amending the  document to alter that list should a sufficient majority of
the  country desire it, but it does not sanction federal action simply because 
it may be efficient or expedient. Under the system established by  the Founders,
state governments and the national government were  to have distinct and limited
powers in order to serve as a check  on one another.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The presumption throughout much of this century, however,  has been that the
national government is progressive and the  states regressive, and therefore
that progress requires a centralization  of power in Washington. Once achieved,
however, the result has  been not only to shift most decision-making to the
federal  government, but to make possible the vast expansion of government 
throughout every area of society, with decidedly negative results.  Whatever the
past failings of the states, they pale in comparison with  those of the federal
government. Federalism is not based on the  assumption that one level of
government is necessarily better than  another; instead, it holds that limited,
constitutional government  is the goal and that the different levels are needed
to restrain  one another.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Q. If states assume more power under a reinvigorated  federalism, how will
civil rights be protected?
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>A. A reinvigorated federalism would not reduce the power of  the federal
government to protect the civil rights guaranteed by  the Constitution. The Bill
of Rights, and especially the Fourteenth  and Fifteenth Amendments, provide the
federal government with  sufficient powers to enforce the civil rights of all
Americans. In  the 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 50 -->  past, the political will to
exercise these powers was often  lacking, a failing which has been more than
made up for over the past  four decades. Nevertheless, advocates of an activist
federal  judiciary often cite the need for an unelected protector of civil
rights  to guard minorities against the inevitable abuses of the  majority.
However, the contempt for the citizenry this attitude is based on  is wholly
contradictory to the theory of the American  government &quot;which rests on the
consent of the governed.&quot;  The  assumption must be that the majority wants
the rights of minorities (of  which everyone is a member of at least one) to be
fully guaranteed,  and for this reason has brought into being a Constitution
which has  that objective as one its principal goals. To assume that the purpose
 of government is to override and suppress the desires of a  thuggish and
intolerant majority is to believe that self-government is  an impossibility.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Q. Isn't the U.S. economy becoming so sophisticated that a  national
economic and regulatory regime is needed to maintain  competition in the global
economy? 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>A. Taken to its logical conclusion, this approach would argue  for the
superiority of international regulation over national  regulation. However, one
of the most important phenomena of the last  quarter of the 20th century is the
widespread realization that the costs  of governmental control over the economy
greatly exceed its  benefits. Communist economies have collapsed; socialist and 
heavily regulated economies have stagnated; and free-market  economies
increasingly have demonstrated the benefits of reducing the role  of the state
through such measures as privatization and the  lowering of trade barriers.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 51 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>To this has been added the new pressures and opportunities of  the emerging
global economy, which is rapidly undermining the  idea of separate national
economies. This new economy places an  emphasis on flexibility and the ability
to adapt quickly to  changing economic and commercial realities. Slumbering
central  governments are proving to be grossly inadequate to such a challenge. 
A renewal of federalism would not replace Washington's  regulation with that of
the states as much as it would allow the latter to  experiment with policies
that are more conducive to  economic growth. Every state would have an interest
in promoting its  own economic growth, and competition between them would 
ensure that only the most beneficial policies survived. The federal  government
would continue to exercise its crucial function of  preventing the states from
erecting their own barriers against one another.  The overall limitations on
government at all levels that this  system would encourage would ensure a more
positive environment  for economic growth.

<B>THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Clinton Administration came into office with a widely  recognized lack
of experience in defense and foreign policy. But  the new President did not take
the necessary steps to correct this  deficiency. The new Commander in Chief,
already suspect in the  national security community for his history of draft
avoidance  during the Vietnam War, made decisions which reinforced his image as 
a President out of touch with the military services and inattentive  to foreign
policy and national security issues. His flip-flops on  Haiti, Cuba, China, and
Bosnia weakened American credibility  abroad and created doubts around the world
about U.S. leadership.  Moreover, the Clinton Administration has presided over a period of neglect  and decline of
U.S. military strength. The Administration's series  of missteps amounts to
little more than on-the-job-training.  Despite over three years in office, the
job as leader and chief architect  of America's foreign and defense policies
still appears to be too  big for Bill Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Instead of developing a clear and coherent foreign and  defense policy
grounded in American principles and national interest,  the Clinton
Administration allowed politics and indifference to  foreign policy issues to
create muddle and confusion in America's  foreign 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 2 -->  policy. Until the beginning of the
104th Congress and the  Contract With America, Congress regrettably did little
to correct the  unwise course being followed by the Administration. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The President and his advisors, indelibly influenced by their  opposition to
the Vietnam War, came into office confused about  the principles that legitimize
the exercise of American power. It  soon became apparent that the Clinton team
believed unilateral  U.S. action was improper, and that U.S. power must be  &quot;legitimized&quot;
by operating through some international or multilateral agency  like the United
Nations. The resulting policy of  &quot;assertive multilateralism&quot;
subordinated clear national interests to the  U.N. and other supranational
entities. Extending his liberal  worldview to international politics, President
Clinton in Somalia, Haiti,  and Bosnia looked upon foreign policy as social
work. Clinton's  vague global utopianism led him to commit the U.S. to dubious 
enterprises, with American soldiers needlessly killed and scarce  defense
dollars wasted. The Administration claims to have learned  that &quot;assertive
multilateralism&quot; in the U.N. does not work, but  the President exercised
the same unwise judgment from his early  years in office by unnecessarily and
unwisely sending U.S. troops  to Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Dubious Foreign Policy Successes</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Many of these enterprises have been hailed as foreign policy  successes by
the Clinton Administration. The President has  claimed that his greatest
successes are in North Korea, Haiti, and  Bosnia. But these claims are
overblown. For example, the  Administration has:
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 3 --> 
</P> 
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Made extraordinary concessions to a most dangerous 
potential enemy, North Korea.</B> Rewarding North Korea's blatant and 
persistent refusal to live up to its obligations as a signatory to  the Nuclear
Non-Proliferation Treaty, the U.S. agreed to provide  $5 billion in fuel oil and
to help finance and build two new light  water reactors for Pyongyang. These
terms were spelled out in  the Nuclear Framework Agreement the Clinton
Administration  negotiated with North Korea. The Administration brags that this 
agreement gives the U.N.'s International Atomic Energy  Agency (IAEA) the right
to inspect certain nuclear facilities inside  North Korea. But the IAEA already
had the right to carry out  inspections. Moreover, the Nuclear Framework
Agreement provides no  guarantee that the North has stopped trying to build
nuclear weapons  at hidden sites, or that the North will continue to cooperate
with  the IAEA once Pyongyang has extracted financial and diplomatic 
concessions from the West.<br>
<b>The Bottom Line:</b> North Korea has  been paid to do what
it already was obligated to do under the  Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, and
the U.S. is still not certain  that North Korea has stopped its nuclear weapons
program.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Embarked on a costly venture of dubious value in Haiti.  President
Clinton hails his Haiti venture as a great foreign policy success.</B>  To be
sure, the U.S., the world's remaining military superpower,  did subdue the
Hemisphere's poorest and most backward country.  But for what purpose?  To
restore to office an avowed Marxist  demagogue known for his hostility to the
U.S. While the Haiti  mission did not turn into a Somalia-like disaster with the
loss of  American lives, it has cost upwards of $2 billion and placed enormous 
strain on U.S. forces at a time when they were engaged in many other  so-called
peace operations. Moreover, under the watchful eyes  of U.S. occupation forces,
former President Jean-Bertrand  Aristide 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 4 -->  hijacked democracy in Haiti,
placing his hand-picked and  easily controlled successor in power via the
elections of December,  1995, and allowing political murders of his opponents to
occur  unpunished. <br>
<b>The Bottom Line:</b> The U.S. operation in Haiti was  unnecessary
and wasteful, serving no vital U.S. interest, and it did  not achieve its stated
purpose  the creation of democracy in Haiti.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Boxed America into an unwise and unnecessary U.N. troop  commitment to
Bosnia.</B> By failing to lift the arms embargo on the  embattled Bosnians so
they could defend themselves, it was left up  to the Croatians to push back the
Bosnian Serbs, who had  dominated the military balance of power inside Bosnia.
Once this shift in  the balance of power occurred, the stage was set for the
peace  agreement which was negotiated November 30, 1995, in Dayton,  Ohio.
Although U.S. pressure and NATO airstrikes played a role  in bringing about the
Dayton agreement, the real key was the  military defeats which the Bosnians and
Croatians imposed on the  Bosnian Serbs last year. But because the Bosnian
Muslims do not fully  trust the Croatians  indeed a few years ago they were at
war with  each other  the Dayton peace agreement is not only very fragile,  it
requires the presence of 20,000 U.S. troops and other  NATO forces to enforce
it. Thus, by failing to lift the arms embargo  on Bosnia, President Clinton
practically guaranteed that U.S.  troops would have to go to Bosnia to enforce
the peace, something  which he had repeatedly in the past promised he would not
do.
<br>
<b>The  Bottom Line:</b> The U.S. troop deployment was unneccessary and  unwise, and
peace is by no means assured in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Claimed credit for the two Israeli-Palestinian peace accords  signed at
the White House in September 1993 and September 1995.</B>  But the two
agreements came about through bilateral negotiations  be
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 5 -->  tween Israel and the Palestine
Liberation Organization,  initially conducted without the Administration's
knowledge. <br>
<b>The  Bottom Line:</b> President Clinton enjoyed two photo opportunities,
but  the diplomatic breakthroughs that produced the agreements  came about
mainly through bilateral talks between Israelis and  Palestinians, not through
American diplomatic efforts.
</P> 
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Claims to have advanced the peace process between the  Irish Catholic
minority in Northern Ireland and the Irish Protestant  majority, backed by the
British government.</B> But the  Administration's controversial embrace of Gerry
Adams, leader of Sinn Fein,  the political wing of the Irish Republican Army
(IRA), is a risky  diplomatic gambit that has backfired. Despite the fact that
the  IRA has killed almost 2,000 people in terrorist attacks over the last  25
years, the Administration has rewarded it with a &quot;carrot and  carrot&quot;
policy. Clinton overruled the advice of his own State  Department, Defense
Department, and Justice Department to  allow Adams to obtain a visa to visit the
U.S. in February 1994.  In March 1995, the Administration allowed Adams to
travel to  the U.S. on a fund-raising trip, open an office in Washington, and 
visit the White House on Saint Patrick's Day. Although the IRA  agreed to a
cease-fire in its terrorist war, it did not agree to disarm,  and maintains a
huge arsenal, including more than a ton of  Semtex plastic explosive, much of it
provided by Libyan  dictator Muammar Qadhafi. Of course, the IRA broke its
cease-fire,  renewing its terrorist campaign, making a mockery of Clinton's 
efforts to bring peace to Nothern Ireland. <br>
<b>The Bottom Line:</b>  Clinton's opportunistic embrace of Gerry Adams, motivated at least in  part by domestic
politics, has undermined U.S. counterterrorism  policy; strained relations with
Britain, a staunch ally; and raised the  IRA's expectations that Washington will
press London to make  conces
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 6 -->  sions without IRA concessions,
thereby undermining the  chances of a genuine peace.
</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>NAFTA and GATT: Successes Unfulfilled</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>One genuine success for which the Clinton Administration fails  to claim
much credit is the approval of the North American  Free Trade Agreement and the
Uruguay Round of talks in the  General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, or GATT.
The Clinton  Administration is to be commended for completing these agreements, 
but the initiative and much of the work behind them occurred in  the Reagan and
Bush Administrations. Moreover, by dropping the  ball on expanding NAFTA to
include Chile, the Clinton  Administration has practically taken the U.S. out of
the game of expanding  free trade in the Western Hemisphere. As a result, the
President  has ceded the initiative to Brazil and others who may want to  create
trade blocs closed to the U.S. but possibly more open to U.S.  competitors in
Europe and Japan.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Clinton's Failures</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>While the President's foreign policy &quot;successes&quot; have proven to 
be doubtful, his many foreign policy failures are obvious and  admitted even by
his supporters. For example, the President has: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Dragged his feet on protecting the U.S. homeland and troops
 and interests abroad from the growing danger of ballistic missiles. </B> He cut
the budget for missile defense by over 50 percent from  levels projected by the
Bush Administration and has attempted  illegally to broaden the restrictions of
the 1972 Anti-Ballistic  Missile (ABM) Treaty, which imposes severe restrictions
on strategic  de
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 7 -->  fenses, to cover tactical and
theater defenses as well. <br>
<b>The  Bottom Line:</b> Americans will be left vulnerable to
nuclear attack,  even though the Clinton Administration itself has admitted that
the  proliferation of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles is the most 
serious threat to national security.
</P> 
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Wasted American lives and treasure on dubious peacekeeping  operations.</B>
Clinton allowed a limited, humanitarian mission to  Somalia to escalate into an
uncertain and dangerous  &quot;nation-building&quot; mission, which included
hunting Somali warlords and  disarming militant factions  in effect making the
U.S. a combatant in  a bloody civil war. Putting U.S. troops under a confused
U.N.  command structure, the Clinton Administration failed to provide  adequate
weapons and equipment to U.S. forces engaged in a  combat operation. The result
was an intense street battle in Mogadishu  in October 1993 which left 18 young
American Rangers dead,  75 other soldiers wounded and led to America's
humiliating  retreat from Somalia. <br>
<b>The Bottom Line:</b> American lives were lost 
unnecessarily, and U.S. national prestige and credibility suffered  needlessly.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Frittered away American military strength and credibility in a  series
of &quot;peace operations&quot; with little or no benefit to the  nation's
security, consuming billions of defense budget dollars intended  for training,
operations, and maintenance of U.S. forces and  equipment.</B> These missions
included an unwise expansion of the  peace mission in Somalia, which led to the
mission's failure, and  the dispatch of troops to peacekeeping missions in
Haiti,  Macedonia, and Bosnia. At the same time, by cutting the defense budget, 
the President has neglected the core duty of the armed forces: to  fight and win
wars in defense of U.S. strategic interests and  existing 
 military alliance commitments. 
<br>
<b>The Bottom Line:</b> Under  Clinton, American fighting troops are weaker and less able
to deal  with larger military contingencies, such as in Korea or the Persian
Gulf.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Built America's military strategy on a potentially fatal illusion.  In
1993 President Clinton's Pentagon released a study of  America's long-range
military requirements.</B> Called the &quot;Bottom-Up  Review,&quot; this study
concluded that the U.S. should have the  means and forces to fight two nearly
simultaneous medium-sized  conflicts. Yet Clinton proceeded to cut the very
forces needed to  sustain this capability. The President refused to fund
adequately  and field the force which his own planners said the country  needed.
<br>
<b>The Bottom Line:</b> Because the U.S. will not be able to protect  all its interests
around the world, its alliances may weaken, its  credibility and influence may
wane, and Americans could be forced  to follow the lead of others rather than to
lead themselves.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Weakened the armed forces with social experimentation and  &quot;political
correctness.&quot;</B>  The President has imposed his radical  vision on the
military services by pushing women into combat  positions before their
effectiveness has been tested, or their impact on  combat effectiveness honestly
evaluated. He has advocated the  admission of acknowledged homosexuals into the
ranks, contrary to  the judgment of the nation's top military leaders. The
result has been  a corrosion of the mutual trust between leaders and those they 
lead that is essential to unit cohesion and combat  effectiveness.<br>
<b>The Bottom Line:</b> Clinton has weakened the morale of  America's fighting forces.
</P>
<P>
</P> 
<P><B>Followed a &quot;Russia-only&quot; policy that has not bolstered 
democracy in Russia, but it has blocked development of strong relations  with 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 9 -->  former Soviet states like Ukraine.</B>
President Clinton has  staked U.S. policy on the fate of one man, President
Boris Yeltsin.  The ostensible reason for this policy is to bolster democracy in
 Russia, but it clearly has not worked. Yeltsin has kicked democrats  like
former Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev and former  Deputy Prime Minister Anatoly
Chubais out of his cabinet, replacing  them with old Soviet hardliners like
Yevgeny Primakov, the new  Foreign Minister. But still the U.S. offers Yeltsin
good will and  cooperation. Clinton has largely turned a blind eye to Russia's 
hard-line policy toward its former &quot;republics&quot; and provinces  the 
so-called &quot;Near Abroad&quot;  and he has failed to condemn Russian 
aggression in trouble spots like Chechnya, Moldova, and Georgia. 
<br>
<b>The  Bottom Line:</b> Clinton's policy of accommodation has not  worked. Russia continues to
drift away from democracy and toward a  more hard line foreign policy, while the
U.S. continues to offer  friendship and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Put at risk key alliance relationships with Japan and the  Republic of
Korea. The Administration's effort last year to manage  trade with Japan was
acrimonious and counterproductive from the  start.</B> The U.S. reached auto
trade agreements with Japan in  November 1994 and March 1995, but these achieved
little and strained  U.S.-Japan relations. After initially denying that its
confrontational  policies were damaging the U.S.-Japan alliance, the 
Administration, under the Pentagon's leadership, belatedly tried to limit the 
damage and reaffirm the alliance. The main purpose of the April  1996
U.S.-Japanese summit is to repair the damage caused by the  previous year's
trade battles. At the same time, Clinton's efforts  to strike a nuclear bargain
with North Korea marginalized the  influence and role of a reliable U.S. ally,
South Korea. Recent  opinion polls by the United States Information Agency show
South  Korean 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 10 -->  support for a U.S. military
presence at 72 percent, down 10  percent from 1994. Overall opinion of the U.S.
not only is down 20  percent, but also  and for the first time in 12 years  is
more  unfavorable (53 percent) than favorable (43 percent).<br><b>The Bottom  Line:</b> America's alliances with South Korea and Japan, key links in  the security chain
of Asia, have been weakened. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Damaged U.S. credibility in dealing with the People's Republic  of
China. After campaigning in 1992 to link China's Most  Favored Nation (MFN)
trading status to its human rights record,  President Clinton reversed himself
in 1994 and delinked MFN from  human rights.</B> <TT><B><A
HREF="ftntfor.htm#1">1</A></B></TT>  This was the correct
decision. As the Administration  belatedly recognized, the best way to encourage
China to  observe international norms of conduct is to promote policies which 
enhance economic interaction and, in turn, economic freedom  and reform. These
are the seeds from which democracy can  grow. However, the Administration's
flip-flops created the impression  of ineptness and weakness. <br>
<b>The Bottom Line:</b>
While the  Administration ultimately did the right thing, its ill-conceived
linkage  policy cost the U.S. credibility both in Beijing and across Asia.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Allowed Beijing to set America's agenda with the Republic  of China on
Taiwan.</B> In response to nearly unanimous  congressional resolutions, the
Administration relented and allowed  Taiwanese President Lee Teng-hui to make a
&quot;private&quot; visit to his alma  mater, Cornell University, in June 1995.
Previously, in the face  of Beijing's protests, the Administration had resisted
the visit  of President Lee, claiming that it would violate its  &quot;One-China&quot;
policy. Clinton reversed himself only when he was pressured to  do so. The
mistake was the initial refusal to allow President Lee  to visit the U.S. 
<br>
<b>The Bottom Line:</b> Beijing should not be allowed  to 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 11 -->  dictate the terms of America's &quot;unofficial&quot;
commercial and  cultural relations with Taiwan, and its interest in Taiwan's
security,  as established by the Taiwan Relations Act of 1979.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Abandoned three decades of principled U.S. policy towards  Cuba.</B>
President Clinton secretly negotiated with Fidel Castro's  communist regime in
August 1994 to reach an agreement whereby all  Cuban boat people intercepted at
sea by U.S. ships would be  repatriated forcibly to Cuba. Hitherto Cuban
refugees were permitted  to enter the U.S. without restriction.
<br>
<b>The Bottom Line:</b> Clinton changed the longstanding U.S. policy of isolating communist  Cuba to a
new conciliatory stance, without winning any democratic  or free-market
concessions from Castro. Clinton was  eventually forced to abandon this
conciliatory policy, and to strengthen  the embargo against Cuba, but only after
he was forced to do so in  the aftermath of the Cuban downing of two U.S.
civilian aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Failed to take seriously the global challenge of radical or 
revolutionary Islam.</B> Nor has the President pursued realistic steps to  deal
with the Islamist threat to friendly regimes or secular Muslim  powers in the
Middle East, North Africa, and Central Asia. Instead,  he has sought to
establish diplomatic contacts with radical  Islamic movements such as Algeria's
Islamic Salvation Front, thereby  undermining secular regimes battling Islamic
radicals. As a  result, the U.S. is not properly anticipating the potential
realignment  of global power in regions critical to U.S. interests. <br>
<b>The Bottom Line:</b> Radical regimes could threaten not only U.S. access to oil, but  also
American lives and interests through terrorism.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P>The mistakes, misjudgments, and missed opportunities that  have
characterized the Clinton Administration's approach to foreign  and 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 12 -->  defense policy over the past four
years are serious. They  have weakened U.S. influence and credibility abroad
and, unless  rectified, could lead inevitably to America's decline as a great 
power capable of defending its values and interests. For America, it  is either
lead or be led. The first road leads to freedom, security,  and greatness, the
second to weakness and submission. For its  own well-being, and for that of the
entire globe, America's  leadership needs to be restored.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>THE 104TH CONGRESS</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The weak record of the Clinton Administration in foreign and  defense policy
was singled out for criticism in the GOP's  Contract With America. Alarmed over
Clinton's defense budget cuts  and failure to move rapidly toward a national
missile defense  system, Republicans marching under the banner of the Contract 
promised to restore America's military strength. Once elected in  November 1994,
they got to work on trying to fulfill their promise. On  February 7, 1995, the
House of Representatives passed the National  Security Revitalization Act (H.R.
7), which sought to establish  a commission to eliminate the funding shortfall
in defense, set a  new policy for the development and deployment of missile 
defenses, expand NATO membership, and limit the authority of the  President to
subordinate U.S. troops to United Nations command.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Senate did not take up H.R. 7. However, parts of H.R. 7  found their way
into different pieces of legislation in the Senate, such  as in the defense
authorization bill and foreign relations  authorization bill. While not all of
the original Contract items were included  in final legislation reconciling
differences between the House  and Senate  for example, Congress dropped the
House's demand  to 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 13 -->  create a commission to examine
U.S. national security strategy   conservative supporters of the Contract
delivered on the  majority of their promises to the American people. 
</P> 
<P>
</P>
<P>The Congress undertook a number of other foreign and  defense policy
initiatives in 1995 that complemented and supplemented  the legislation inspired
by the Contract With America. For  example, the new majority in Congress
endeavored to:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Restore America's military strength. Congress approved a 
defense spending bill that added $7 billion to the defense budget  request
submitted by President Clinton.</B> This money was needed not  only to keep
America's armed forces trained and combat ready, but  also to maintain a force
with modern high-technology weapons in  the 21st century. Primarily because he
counted on congressional  support for his Bosnia mission, President Clinton
bowed to  congressional demands and signed the defense appropriations bill for 
fiscal 1996, which provided the additional $7 billion above his  original
request. But in an unprecedented act the President vetoed  the accompanying
fiscal year 1996 defense authorization bill  which would have: 1) provided more
funds to maintain the  technological superiority of U.S. forces, 2) authorized a
pay raise and  housing allowance increase for military personnel (including
those  deployed to Bosnia), and 3) mandated the defense of the U.S.  homeland
against ballistic missiles. However, in early 1996 the  President signed a
different version of the defense authorization bill  that weakened missile
defense.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Move the United States closer to a national missile defense  system.</B>
The defense authorization bill approved by Congress but  vetoed by the President
sought to establish a clear timetable for  de
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 14 -->  velopment and deployment of both
national and theater  missile defenses. Further, it sought to bar the
application of  Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty restrictions to theater
defense  systems. However, the President refused to sign the defense bill,
giving  as his primary reason the strong missile defense provisions it 
contained. Of course, the President eventually got his way,  forcing Congress to
accept a weakening of missile defense in the  final 1996 defense authorization
bill. Once again the President has  succeeded in blocking this country's ability
to defend its citizens  from nuclear attack and Congress was not able to muster
enough  votes to override his veto. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Cut foreign aid.</B> While the new Republican majority promised 
extensive cuts in foreign aid, little has transpired by way of  revamping
America's wasteful foreign aid programs. Federal spending  on foreign aid will
likely be only $2 billion less in FY 1996 than  it was in FY 1995. However,
under the umbrella of a balanced  budget by the year 2002, further cuts are
likely. While current  cuts amount to nearly 30 percent for all programs except
aid to  Israel and Egypt, much still needs to be done. One step in the right 
direction is a new law, that the U.S. government report on the  progress being
made by foreign aid recipients developing free markets,  the main engine of
economic development. This effort was inspired  by The Heritage Foundation's
<I>Index of Economic  Freedom</I>, a global comparison of economic freedom in
142 countries.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>End the Castro dictatorship in Cuba.</B> Congress passed and  the
President signed the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity  Act just a few
days after the February 24, 1996, downing by Cuba  of two U.S. registered
civilian aircraft in international waters.  This legislation, which tightens the
U.S. trade embargo on Cuba  and 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 15 -->  allows American citizens to seek
compensation for property  stolen by Castro, is another step toward hastening
the end of  Castro's dictatorship.
</P> 
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Reorganize the State Department.</B> Congress proposed to cut  waste in
the State Department and foreign operations accounts by  consolidating several
independent foreign policy agencies into  the State Department. This effort, led
by Senate Foreign  Relations Committee Chairman Jesse Helms (R-NC), had the
support of  Secretary of State Warren Christopher until bureaucratic  interests
within the Administration persuaded him to oppose it. Key  legislation to move
the Arms Control and Disarmament  Agency (ACDA), United States Information
Agency (USIA), Agency  for International Development (AID), and two other
foreign  policy agencies into the State Department was approved by a 
House-Senate conference committee in March 1996. The President  has vowed to
veto this legislation if approved by Congress.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Express reservations on sending U.S. troops to Bosnia.</B> In  December
1995, the House and Senate passed resolutions to support  the U.S. troops being
deployed on the peacekeeping mission  to Bosnia. These resolutions, however, did
not endorse  the President's decision to deploy them, and raised questions about
 the wisdom of American involvement in a mission lacking clear  goals. The House
went so far as to vote to cut off funds for the  Bosnia mission.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Maintain America's trading relations with China by  approving
most-favored-nation trade status for China.</B> In July 1995, the  Congress
sustained most-favored-nation trading status for China.  This decision reflects
the belief held by a majority in the Congress  that 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 16 -->  increasing economic interaction
is the best way to promote  economic reform and advance political liberalization
and  human rights.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Protect the U.S. relationship with Taiwan.</B> In the face of 
Administration resistance to granting Taiwan's President Lee Teng-hui  a visa to
visit his alma mater Cornell University, the Congress  voted with near unanimity
in May 1995 to support his visit. As a  result, the President reversed course
and granted the visa. Also, both  the House and Senate, have included provisions
in the 1996 State  Department authorization bill that would give precedence to
the  1979 Taiwan Relations Act over U.S.-China  government-to-government
communiqu&eacute;s when considering future weapons exports to  Taiwan. U.S.
China policy too often is framed by communiqu&eacute;s  that have no force of
law, international or domestic. The Taiwan  Relations Act, however, is the law
of the land. The President  has vowed to veto the bill if approved by Congress.

</P>
<P><B>M</B>ost Americans believe that America, for all its flaws, is a 
peaceable, generous, and benevolent nation that has been a force  for good in
the world. Today, the industrialized democracies, led  by the United States,
face rising new challenges to their security,  interests, and prosperity. The
fall of the Soviet Union and  Warsaw Pact has meant not the end of threats to
U.S. and allied  security, but the unleashing of forces contained by 45 years of
the  Cold War. U.S. leadership is still vital if America and other free  nations
are to deal effectively with these forces. To provide this  leadership, the
United States needs to remain engaged in world  affairs, working to create
conditions that serve the interests of the U.S.  and its allies and trying to
shape the kind of world in which  democratic institutions, free trade, and the
unimpeded flow of ideas can  flourish.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>America cannot be -- nor should it try to be -- the world's  policeman. But
neither can the nation retreat into neo-isolationism.  This is an era
characterized by the global spread of ballistic  missiles; nuclear, chemical,
and biological weapons; and other  high-tech weaponry among potential
adversaries. And while the threat  of thermonuclear war has subsided, at least
from the former  Soviet Union, threats from nuclear proliferation, terrorism,
and tribal  and ethnic conflict have not. Even in this new &quot;Age of Chaos,&quot;
 however, the world remains linked by innumerable strands of  trade, 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 2 -->  commerce, and telecommunications;
and these essential links  must operate despite conflict, confrontation, and
dislocation. A  &quot;Fortress America&quot; strategy in this kind of world is
not workable.  The U.S. could not put its head in the sand for long even if it
wanted  to. The North Koreas, Iraqs, and Irans, not to mention the  positive
demands of trade and commerce, would not allow it.  America needs access to the
world's markets and resources and must  maintain the ability to move goods
freely and safely.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Consequently, acting in concert with friends and allies when  possible but
unilaterally when necessary, the United States should  use all the components of
national power and influence -- diplomacy, trade, communications, and (as a last resort) armed force -- to shape a world friendly to America's interests and
values. In  short, the U.S. needs to make the world safe for America. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>SELECTIVE ENGAGEMENT</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The U.S. has global interests and must be a world leader in  ways that suit
its interests, values, and capabilities. Because it is a  trading nation
dedicated to the free exchange of ideas and  goods, America has commercial and
political interests in almost all  corners of the world. Therefore, the U.S.
must be engaged -- through diplomacy, trade, and other means -- in practically all
regions  of the world.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>However, the U.S. does not have security interests  everywhere. Some of the
world's regions are more important than others.  Since the U.S. cannot be the
world's policeman -- it has neither  the means nor the will to impose a security
order on the world -- it  will have to choose carefully in deciding when, and
under what  cir
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 3 -->  cumstances, to engage its military
forces and prestige. It will  have to choose strategies, alliances, and military
capabilities that  are best suited to its unique position as the world's only
global  military power. It will have to choose when its use of military force 
is decisive and unique.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>To exploit this unique and unenviable position, the U.S.  should adopt a
military strategy of selective engagement  whereby America, lacking a single
global threat, engages its military  power primarily to maintain a balance of
power in regions that are  most vital to her interests. The U.S. must always be
prepared to  protect its borders and regions close to home; for this reason,
security  matters in the Western Hemisphere will always be vitally  important.
But as a global power, the U.S. also must be prepared to  intervene militarily
to maintain a positive balance of power in other key  regions of the world. Now
that the Soviet Union has dissolved,  no single power can challenge the U.S.
globally, but smaller  powers in Europe, Asia, and the Persian Gulf can threaten
U.S.  security interests in these vitally important regions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>America's &quot;global&quot; strategy is both global and regional. The 
primary aims of U.S. military strategy should be: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>1)</B>  <B>To defend the American people and territory
from attack. </B> Thus, America's top priorities should be not only to deploy a 
ballistic missile defense for the U.S. homeland, but also to take a lead  role
in countering nuclear proliferation and other global threats to  security. <B>
</B>The greatest threat to the peace and stability in the world  today is the
acquisition by rogue regimes or hostile forces of  weapons of mass destruction
(nuclear, biological, and chemical).  The proliferation of weapons of mass
destruction, along with the  ballis
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 4 -->  tic missiles to deliver them, will
result inevitably in greater  confrontation and conflict unless the free
nations, led by the  United States, take steps to keep dangerous weapons out of
the hands  of potential enemies. America has the resources to counter the 
proliferation of advanced weaponry, including the ability to build  an effective
defense against ballistic missiles, thereby rendering  them less useful.
Harnessing these resources and demonstrating the  leadership necessary to use
them should be a top priority for U.S.  foreign and defense policy.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>2)  To maintain a balance of power in Europe, Asia, and the
 Persian Gulf.</B> It is still a vital interest of the U.S. to prevent the 
domination of Europe, Asia, or the Persian Gulf by a hostile power  or bloc of
hostile powers. NATO and other military alliances  remain the best ways to
prevent such domination. These alliances are  insurance policies against the
instability and chaos that  brought America into two world wars in this century.
Without an  American military presence in Europe, Asia, and the Persian Gulf,
chaos  and conflict will fill the vacuum if security arrangements among  the
free nations of the world erode. The U.S. must cultivate good  relations with
allies in Europe, Asia, the Middle East, and  Latin America, and where possible
bring emerging democracies  into security partnerships. Top priorities include
bringing new  democracies in Central Europe into NATO and strengthening 
alliances and friendships in Asia.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P>Therein lies not only the basis of American leadership in the world -- not as the world's policeman, but as the only power capable  of
preventing major regional or even global wars -- but also a  new division of labor
with allies. America's allies should take the  lead in settling purely regional
conflicts, such as the civil war  in 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 5 -->  Bosnia-Herzogovina, while the U.S.
focuses primarily on the  core military mission of collective defense. The U.S.
should not try  to put out every brushfire that breaks out in Europe or Asia, 
but should husband its resources to deal with larger threats that  endanger the
overall security of these regions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>This strategy of selective engagement is very different from  the one
pursued by the Clinton Administration. The President calls  his strategy &quot;engagement
and enlargement.&quot;  No one is sure  exactly what these terms mean, but his
strategy entails a heavy focus  on peacekeeping, multilateralism, appeasement of
large powers  like Russia and China, and a general neglect of military 
capabilities, military alliances, and the core military missions of those 
alliances.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The strategy of selective engagement is practically the opposite  of
Clinton's approach. Peacekeeping would be downplayed (and  U.S. troop
participation in such operations avoided); multilateralism  de-emphasized except
through military alliances; policies  toward large powers like Russia and China
toughened; military  capabilities maintained at higher levels; and military
alliances focused  on core missions of collective defense, not peacekeeping or 
crisis management. Leadership would be demonstrated not by  engaging in global
social work, as the President has done, but by  emphasizing America's unique and
decisive contributions to world  peace and stability as a global power.


<P>
</P>
<P><B>ECONOMIC PROSPERITY FOR AMERICANS</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>There is more to maintaining America's leadership role in  the
world than military strategy. There also are the key issues of  trade 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 6 -->  and economics. To be sure,
America's standard of living  depends on its role as a global power; the wealth
of America as a nation  is inconceivable without the security provided by
America's  armed forces and alliances. But it is also true that America's 
wealth would be inconceivable were it not for its access to overseas  markets
and the relative stability of the world's financial markets.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>For this reason, the U.S. has a vital interest in free trade and  open
overseas markets. As a maritime nation dependent on  foreign trade, the U.S.
depends on access to world markets, raw  materials, and energy resources for its
prosperity and security.  Protecting these interests depends on the free and
safe transit of the air,  space, and the world's sea lanes and maritime choke
points.  Historically, the U.S. has been compelled to intervene with armed force
to  protect these freedoms, and it must remain prepared to do so  when
necessary. But persuasion is always preferable. Therefore, the  U.S. should
conduct an enlightened diplomacy to remove artificial  barriers to the free flow
of goods, services, and ideas,  especially among the industrialized democracies.

<P>
</P>
<P><B>PROMOTING FREEDOM ABROAD</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Americans care deeply about the morality of their foreign 
policy. They wish to see a reflection of themselves as a people in the  foreign
policies which their government pursues. For this reason,  they wish to support
freedom and democracy abroad, not only for  the practical benefits of spreading
peace and stability, but  because doing so is a reflection of their own values
in the world. It also is  a source of inspiration which sustains their
commitments  beyond what is required by self-interest.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 7 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>However, most Americans do not wish to see their country  embark on some
overseas crusade for democracy. They understand  the limits imposed by reality.
It makes little sense to imply, as  the Clinton Administration did in Haiti,
that creating democracy is  a general and unlimited goal of U.S. military
policy. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Nevertheless, it is both a practical and moral benefit for the U.S.  to help
free institutions take root abroad, particularly in  regions where old
totalitarian or authoritarian empires have collapsed.  Free nations grounded in
democratic institutions generally do not  start wars. The freer and more
democratic the world becomes, the  more peaceful, and therefore the more
congenial to U.S. values and  interests, it will be. The best tools with which
to help emerging  democracies are foreign aid and public and private diplomacy, 
not direct military intervention, which should be undertaken  only when vital
interests are threatened.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>CONCLUSION</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>These principles can and should guide policymakers, not only 
in the next Administration or next session of Congress, but in  successive
Administrations and Congresses for decades to come. In  short, they should be
viewed as the basic principles of foreign and  defense policy for America in the
21st century. They are, in  essence, the foundations of a post-Cold War national
strategy for the  United States.

<P>U.S. defense policy is undergoing its most sweeping  reappraisal since World
War II. The defense budget has dropped every  year for ten years, and from the
end of FY 1988 through FY 1995,  the Pentagon has eliminated well over one
million military  personnel. Nevertheless, despite the shrinking of America's
military might,  it is not yet clear how weak America can afford to become, or 
indeed what the major mission of the U.S. armed forces will be in the  21st
century.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The most dangerous threat to America today is the proliferation  of
long-range nuclear missiles that could reach American soil  from Iran, Iraq,
North Korea, or some other hostile nation.  Intelligence officials state that at
least 20 countries already have or may  be developing both weapons of mass
destruction (including  nuclear weapons) and ballistic missile delivery 
systems.<A HREF="ftnt16.htm#1">1</A>  While no Third World
countries yet have ballistic missiles with sufficient range  to reach the United
States, it is a virtual certainty that some will  have them by the next decade.
Yet America has no defense against  these weapons. Strategic anti-missile
defenses are more important  than ever and could be deployed by the early part
of the coming  century. To do otherwise -- to leave America undefended against such a clear physical threat -- would be a dereliction of duty with  tragic
potential consequences.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 2 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Other possible near-term threats to U.S. vital national interests  are the
potential re-establishment of an expansionist dictatorship  in Russia, military
expansionism by Iran or Iraq, attacks by  North Korea against South Korea, or
militarily threatening moves  by China against Taiwan. A defense posture capable
of  countering these threats can be maintained at far less cost than the Cold 
War demanded. However, the Clinton Administration is not  maintaining these
necessary defenses. Instead, it has presided over a  period of decline and
confusion in America's military capabilities.

<P>
</P>
<P>There are many national security issues and questions  dividing liberals
from conservatives, but not all are familiar. What, for  example, is the right
amount to spend on defense now that the  Soviet threat has ended?  There is no
consensus on the Left or the  Right; much of the old Left-Right division on
defense strategy and  spending ended with the fall of the Soviet Union. Many 
conservatives want to focus entirely on domestic problems and cut all  federal
spending, including defense. Many liberals (including the  Clinton
Administration), while not supporting higher defense  spending, want to use
American military forces in humanitarian,  peacekeeping, and non-traditional
missions which put enormous pressure  on the shrinking defense budget.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>There are many other issues and questions facing the  candidates this year:
What is the proper use of American military force in  the 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 3 -->  post-Cold War world, and what kind
of forces are needed?   Should the U.S. military be converted to a kind of
global  peacekeeping constabulary?  Or should the armed services continue to
focus  on their traditional role of deterring threats to America's vital 
interests, the central element of which is preparing to fight and  win wars?  If
the U.S. military is to maintain its focus on this  traditional warfighting
role, what level of personnel is needed, and  how should the armed forces be
organized, trained, and equipped  for the future?
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The post-Cold War world can be characterized as an &quot;Age  of Chaos.&quot;
 While the Soviet Union has fallen and no longer  threatens the free world with
nuclear annihilation, new conflicts have  been spawned  ethnic, tribal, and
religious  between emerging  nations and at the sub-national level. Some of
these conflicts  may threaten U.S. interests; most will not. But they certainly 
disturb peace and order in the world. Under what circumstances should  the U.S.
intervene?  What are sound and politically supportable  criteria for the use of
American military force abroad?  These are  two key questions facing the U.S.
today.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The U.S. armed forces are not merely subordinate to civilian  leadership,
starting with the Commander in Chief, but highly  responsive, precisely because
of their command hierarchy. How  should the military respond to the social and
political agenda of the  President and his Administration?  Should the
Administration use  this highly responsive institution to foster revolutionary
social  change or as a laboratory for social experimentation?  What is the 
impact on combat readiness when radical social changes are forced on  the armed
forces?
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 4 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Perhaps the most contentious unresolved defense issue is  this: Should the
American homeland be defended against the  growing threat of long-range
ballistic missiles and the proliferation   especially among potentially hostile
nations  of weapons of mass  destruction?  Five years after the Gulf War, in

 attack, the U.S. still has no better defense against regional or  theater
missile threats than the <U>Patriot</U> missile, which was designed  primarily
not as a missile defense, but as an anti-aircraft missile.  The question is:
Should the U.S. move aggressively to deploy  more effective theater missile
defenses for U.S. forces and allies abroad?   Or should America continue to rely
on arms control treaties  like the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty to protect
its security?

<P>The Clinton Administration has all but abandoned strategic  ballistic
missile defense (BMD). What is left of the nation's BMD  program is both
misdirected and underfunded. The  Administration's current plan directs the bulk
of funds toward defenses  against short-range ballistic missiles, ignoring the
need to defend  U.S. territory against long-range ballistic missiles. It reduces
the  budget for missile defense by almost $23 billion  more than 50 percent  
from FY 1995 through FY 1999. Even the plan's  high-priority &quot;theater&quot;
defenses against short-range missiles are cut by $4.5  bil
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 7 -->  lion over the same period.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Clinton Administration is providing neither the resources  nor the
proper direction in maintaining strong conventional  forces. Instead of
identifying specific national interests and the threats  to them, the
Administration has formulated a vague strategy of  &quot;engagement and
enlargement&quot; that confuses the purposes of  national security policy. In
its national security planning, the  Administration has placed far too much
emphasis on tangential issues  like domestic economic policy, environmental
policy, and foreign  economic development.<A
HREF="ftnt16.htm#4">4</A>  The result has been a national
security  planning process out of control  one disconnected not only from  the
Administration's decision-making process, but also from the  hard realities of
the threats America faces.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The current National Security Strategy developed by the  Clinton
Administration fails to make clear where and under what  circumstances U.S.
forces may be asked to fight. While the Clinton  Administration has established
some guidelines for military  intervention, for example, it ignored many of them
in its decision to  send troops to Bosnia. In Bosnia, the Administration made
the  mistake of creating a vital American interest where there otherwise  would
not be one. By promising U.S. troops in a yet-to-be-defined  mission and putting
American credibility on the line during the  Dayton peace talks, the Clinton
Administration presented  Congress with the choice of supporting the
Administration or damaging  U.S. credibility by breaking its word. The risks of
the Bosnian  intervention clearly are out of proportion to the costs, and the
exit  strategy is essentially an exit date of a year or less after the 
intervention began. Most controversial of all, however, was President  Clinton's
decision to deploy American forces without congressional  ap
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 8 -->  proval or public support. Public
opinion supporting the  intervention crested at 40 percent in December 1995,
when the House  of Representatives passed a resolution condemning the Bosnia 
mission. At the same time, the Senate expressed only lukewarm  support  support
directed at American forces, but not the  Clinton policies.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Another example of poor defense leadership by the  Administration was its
1993 &quot;Bottom-Up Review&quot; of U.S. military forces.  The purpose of the
BUR was to devise a new military force to  implement U.S. strategy in the
post-Cold War era. In meeting this  goal, however, the BUR failed. The Clinton
Administration promised  to maintain sufficient military forces to fight and win
two  medium regional conflicts, but the forces provided for by the 
Administration strategy are clearly inadequate for a two-war scenario. 
President Clinton's proposed defense budgets for the period  covering FY 1996 to
FY 2000 are not enough to pay for the BUR  force, according to numerous defense
analyses, including those of  The Heritage Foundation and the General Accounting
 Office.<A HREF="ftnt16.htm#5">5</A>  The Pentagon will be
around $110 billion short over five years if  it pursues the current Clinton
Administration defense spending plan. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> Deploying the forces proposed for a single major conflict from  the other
services would leave virtually nothing in reserve if a  second major conflict
began. Of the total active force of 11 aircraft  carrier battle groups proposed
for the Navy, for example, the Clinton  Administration would assign four to five
carriers to each of the  two major regional conflicts, leaving perilously little
room for error.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Even worse, because &quot;peace operations&quot; will draw from the  &quot;same
collection of general purpose forces&quot; already obligated for  major 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 9 -->  regional contingencies, the
Administration intends to support  them by committing up to two Army divisions,
one Marine brigade,  two aircraft carrier battle groups, and two Air Force wings
from  an already overcommitted force.<A HREF="ftnt16.htm#6">6</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The bottom line: At the same time the Clinton Administration  has been
cutting the size and readiness of U.S. forces, it has been  increasing the
commitments they are supposed to cover. In  other words, the President is
developing a military &quot;strategy&quot;  whose reach exceeds its grasp and
which inevitably will leave some  vital U.S. interests undefended.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Because of Clinton's mismanagement of U.S. defense policy,  the U.S. could
not repeat the<B> </B>sweeping victory of the Persian Gulf  War today<B>.</B>
The Persian Gulf War epitomizes U.S. military  prowess. The forces that won
Desert Storm were largely the product of  the Reagan Administration's military
buildup during the early  1980s. But the Clinton Administration is sacrificing
the combat  readiness of the force of tomorrow to preserve operational readiness
 today. Had Ronald Reagan and Congress done this in the 1980s,  George Bush
could not have won such a decisive and relatively  low-casualty victory in the
Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>President Clinton and Congress owe the same careful  stewardship to the next
President. Not only has Clinton reduced the  armed forces to the point where
they lack the means to fight and win  a Gulf War (while maintaining a minimum of
other defense  commitments), but his budget cuts have severely affected the 
combat readiness of this reduced force. For instance, some Marine  divisions are
operating at 80-90 percent of their assigned  combat strength, Army combat
battalions assigned to be the first forces  in 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 10 -->  the Persian Gulf have been forced
to cancel annual gunnery  training, and Navy fighter squadrons have been forced
to  cannibalize some units in order to keep others  flying.<A
HREF="ftnt16.htm#7">7</A>  These types of readiness crises
threaten to make the U.S. military a hollow  fighting force.

</P>
<P><B>WHAT TO DO IN 1997</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>To avoid further critical weakening of America's combat  capability, there
are several actions that the next Administration and  Congress must take.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Devise a coherent national military strategy.</B> In addition to 
providing adequate resources, Congress and the next Administration  need to
devise a new military strategy for the U.S.; for all intents  and purposes,
America now has none. U.S. defense policy should  be built on four fundamental
strategies:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Strategy #1:</B> Selective Engagement. The United States
has  global interests. In fact, it has economic and political interests in 
practically all regions of the world. But it does not have security  interests
in all parts of the world. When it comes to employing  U.S. military power,
America has to make choices. It should choose  to engage its armed forces
primarily in ways that affect the  global balance of power. The main purpose of
American military  power should be to establish a balance of power favorable to 
American and Western interests in key regions of the world  Europe,  Asia, and
the Persian Gulf. According to this strategy, the U.S.  would bear the principal
responsibility for the collective defense of  these regions, while U.S. allies
in the regions affected would  become responsible primarily for collective
security, peacekeeping,  and 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 11 -->  settling lesser conflicts that
are essentially regional in nature.  It must be emphasized that selective
engagement is a military  strategy, not a national strategy encompassing all
aspects  (economic, political, and diplomatic) of U.S. policy. Moreover,
selective  engagement implies that America needs a military force capable  of
handling core missions in different regions of the world.  These forces should
not be customized for specific regions when  undertaking peacekeeping and other
missions short of war.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Strategy #2:</B> Dissuasion. The U.S. armed forces should be  strong
enough to dissuade other nations from attempting to threaten  the U.S., its
interests, and its allies. By forcing them to recognize  the futility of
aggression, such power even may discourage  potential enemy nations from
substantially arming themselves. To have  the desired deterrent effect, this
power must be global in reach  and capable, when necessary, of achieving
decisive military  victory over most potential enemies.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Strategy #3:</B> Strategic Defense. With many potentially  unstable
regimes acquiring both nuclear weapons and long-range  ballistic missile
delivery systems, anti-ballistic missile defenses are  absolutely essential to
defense of the U.S. homeland.  Threatening nuclear retaliation to deter an
attack using these weapons may  fail with any one of these regimes. The ability
to knock out single  or multiple missile launches could save tens of millions of
 American lives and spare the country unimaginable devastation.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Strategy #4:</B> Force Projection. With many potential trouble  spots
around the globe, U.S. forces need to be redesigned so they can  be deployed
quickly around the globe. With U.S. bases  overseas shrinking in number, America
increasingly will have to be able  to 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 12 -->  project force overseas from its
own territory. Thus, the U.S.  needs a strong navy, flexible expeditionary
forces, and an army  capable of decisively defeating a large and modern force on
the battlefield.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P>In addition to reflecting these four fundamental strategies, a  sound and
credible U.S. defense policy must:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Acknowledge that the Clinton Administration's Bottom-Up  Review
force is not adequate to fight and win two medium-size  regional conflicts
simultaneously,</B> but should be postured to  fight and win simultaneously one
major regional conflict and  one smaller contingency. If the Administration's
objective is to  win two major regional conflicts simultaneously, it must
provide  a larger force  and the budget and other resources to sustain  that
force.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Budget approximately $285 billion per year</B> (with annual 
adjustments as needed for inflation) for defense from FY 1997  through FY 2001.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Devote adequate funds to research and development</B> so  that
tomorrow's force will have the advanced weaponry needed to  win with as few
casualties as possible. The research and  development account should be
increased to $38 billion (1995 dollars) by  the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Increase military pay to keep pace with inflation.</B> This will 
ensure that high-quality personnel continue to serve in the  all-volunteer
military.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Maintain spending for operations, maintenance, and training</B> 
at 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 13 -->  1995 levels, adjusted for
inflation. This funding is essential to  keep the U.S. armed forces fully
trained and combat ready.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Restore adequate funds to crippled ballistic missile defense 
programs.</B> In FY 1997 the Pentagon should spend about $1.2  billion more on
missile defenses than the $3 billion the Clinton  Administration is likely to
request. Thus, the total, which includes funds  for the Ballistic Missile
Defense Organization (BMDO) and a  few select programs under the Air Force
budget, should be about  $4.3 billion to $4.5 billion in FY 1997.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Develop a cheaper but more effective approach to missile  defense.</B>
Sea-based and space-based systems, rather than relatively  ineffective and
costly ground-based ones, would fill the bill. The  best architecture would be
one based on accelerating the Navy's  &quot;Upper Tier&quot; missile defense
system and then moving to deploy  a combination of space-based interceptors and
space-based  lasers early in the next decade.<A
HREF="ftnt16.htm#8">8</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Keep an eye on the future.</B> The computer chip and 
microelectronics revolutions are bringing about a corresponding revolution  in
military affairs. As its forces shrink, the U.S. must maintain  the most
technologically advanced military in the world, paying  close attention to new
operational concepts made possible by new  technologies  in particular,
information warfare capabilities,  improvements in surveillance and
precision-strike weapons, and  advanced &quot;situational awareness&quot; of
battlefield commanders.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><A NAME="Q&A">Q &amp; A</A></B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Don't we spend enough on defense?  The Cold War is  over; 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 14 -->  why can't we get by with
dramatically smaller military forces?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> American forces already are smaller than during the Cold  War,
and they continue to shrink in size. The Pentagon has cut  more than one million
personnel during the drawdown after the end  of the Cold War. But though the
Cold War threat has ended,  the world is entering an era of new threats and
conflicts, some  of which are very dangerous. America's security and prosperity 
still depend upon a military large enough and capable enough to  defend vital
U.S. interests around the globe. For that force to remain  sufficiently combat
ready and technologically advanced to deter or  defeat future threats, the
nation must invest in adequate resources.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Critics of missile defense say that no rogue state can threaten  us
with missiles today. Why do you insist on hyping the threat  from ballistic
missiles?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Ballistic missile technology is now 50 years old and is  no
longer high technology. More countries are acquiring ballistic  missiles and
missile technology and using these destructive  weapons once they obtain them.
Ballistic missiles have been used in the  war in Afghanistan, the Iran-Iraq War,
the civil war in Yemen, and  the Persian Gulf War. In the Gulf War, more
Americans (28)  died from missile attack than from any other enemy action when 
an Iraqi Scud fell on a U.S. barracks in Dharan. Inevitably,  these rogue states
will acquire missiles with greater ranges and  increased accuracy. Fielding
comprehensive defenses against the  emerging missile threat will take some 10
years; if the U.S. waits until  rogue states actually deploy missiles with
ranges sufficient to reach  U.S. territory, it will be too late. Finally, U.S.
territory is at risk  today because of intercontinental ballistic missiles
(ICBMs) and  subma
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 15 -->  rine-launched ballistic missiles
(SLBMs) deployed by China  and Russia. At a minimum, the U.S. should deploy
defenses to  address the possibility of unauthorized or accidental missile
launches  by these two countries. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Some critics say there is no readiness crisis in the military.  Is
there a crisis in readiness or not? 
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Former Assistant Secretary of Defense Lawrence J. Korb,  a
scholar at the Brookings Institution, argues that there is no  readiness crisis.<A
HREF="ftnt16.htm#9">9</A>  However, two separate reports
based on the  evidence from field units themselves paint a dramatically
different  picture. Senator John McCain's <I>Going Hollow: The Warnings of the 
Chiefs of Staff</I> and Representative Floyd Spence's 
<I>Military Readiness: The View from the Field</I> document how funding
shortfalls  have forced understrength first-line combat units to cancel
training,  curtail missions, and cease flying in preparation for eventual 
military missions. At the same time, Clinton has sent the military on 
humanitarian missions to Bosnia, Somalia, Haiti, Rwanda, and  elsewhere at the
expense of combat readiness.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. What should be done about the inability of the Bottom-Up  Review
Force to fight and win two simultaneous major conflicts?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Create a &quot;one-and-a-half-war&quot; fighting force. The size
of  the U.S. forces needed depends on the magnitude of the  commitments made to
meet possible threats. It is unlikely that the U.S. will  face more than one
large-scale regional conflict similar to the  Persian Gulf War at any one time
over the next five years.  Conceivably, however, the nation may have to deal
with one small-scale  regional conflict roughly the size of the 1989 Panama
operation  con
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 16 -->  currently with a large-scale
conflict. The U.S. should maintain  a one-and-a-half-war force capable of
engaging in such  conflicts simultaneously.<A
HREF="ftnt16.htm#10">10</A>  While this strategy accepts a
higher level of  risk than the Clinton Administration's &quot;two war&quot;
strategy,  the Administration's defense budget puts the nation in a  position
where it will have barely enough forces to fight one major  regional conflict by
itself. The important thing is to stop the  demobilization process now. If the
nation later finds it necessary, it should  re-examine the two-war strategy and
increase the defense budget  accordingly.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. How many and what kinds of conventional forces and  equipment does
the nation need?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> The U.S. needs a Navy of about 400 ships, with 12 active 
aircraft carriers. The Marine Corps should retain three Marine  Expeditionary
Forces (MEFs), which would require 177,000  active-duty Marines; the Marine
Corps Reserve should number 42,000.  The Navy and Marine Corps Reserve,
therefore, should be reduced  by a smaller proportion than the other services.
Also needed are  fast sealift ships and new heavy airlifters, like the C-17, to
replace  the nation's rapidly aging airlift fleet and maintain the ability to 
get heavy forces into a theater of conflict in a hurry. Finally,  adequate
pre-positioned stocks of heavy equipment, either ashore near  likely trouble
spots or on maritime pre-positioned ships, are essential  to sustain a conflict
for more than a few weeks.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Won't building strategic defenses kill arms control?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> The U.S. should carry out the strategic nuclear weapons 
reductions agreed upon with Moscow. This would lessen the  Russian 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 17 -->  nuclear threat while leaving the
U.S. with the forces it needs  both to protect itself should a political
reversal take place in  Moscow and to deter such lesser nuclear powers as China.
At the  same time, however, a policy of nuclear deterrence will be inadequate 
in a world where many nations possess both weapons of mass  destruction and
long-range delivery systems. With many  potentially unstable, even irrational,
regimes capable of delivering  nuclear weapons, strategic anti-missile defenses
are more essential  than ever. The Cold War policy of deliberate vulnerability
to  missile attack is unthinkable in this new international climate.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Building missile defenses will not kill arms control.  Ronald Reagan signed
numerous arms reduction deals with the  Soviets while pursuing the Strategic
Defense Initiative (SDI). It would  be no different in the future. The Russians'
bluster against U.S.  strategic defense comes simply from their desire to keep
America  vulnerable to their strategic missiles, in which they have made such  a
huge investment, and which constitute their one surviving  qualification as a
global power. The U.S. should offer to discuss a  transition from an
offense-only posture to missile defenses by  both sides, but Russia should not
be permitted a veto over the  deployment of U.S. missile defenses.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. What should be done about the ABM Treaty?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> The U.S. should terminate the 1972 Anti-Ballistic  Missile (ABM)
Treaty. The treaty effectively bars the deployment of  effective,
non-threatening defenses. A new multilateral  agreement with all relevant
parties to provide for the mutual deployment  of such defenses should be
pursued.<A HREF="ftnt16.htm#11">11</A>
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 18 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Should the U.S. military be reorganized to deal mainly  with
peacekeeping operations and not large wars, which are things  of the past?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> The U.S. military exists for one principal reason: to fight  and
win America's wars. Under no circumstances can it fail in  that most profound
task. Given the many American security  commitments around the globe, the U.S.
military must train  continuously and arduously towards this goal. During the
Cold War, the  U.S. military concentrated almost exclusively on decisive 
battlefield engagements against the forces of the Soviet Union and the  Warsaw
Pact. It was this training and focus that gave America the  military prowess to
defeat Iraq so completely in the Persian Gulf  War. Such a commitment to winning
in combat must not be  squandered through continuous commitment to peacekeeping
operations or  a restructuring of vital combat units for such missions. The 
deployments to Somalia, Haiti, and Bosnia already have greatly  reduced the
combat capabilities of the military. Any further dilution of  this fundamental
mission stands to put the U.S. military in a  position similar to the one it
faced in Korea in 1950. At that time,  American occupation forces were untrained
for combat and nearly  wiped out by the North Korean invasion. America cannot
afford to  lose on the battlefield, and history conclusively proves that 
concentrating on military missions other than war increases the possibility  of
such a disaster. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B> Q. When should the U.S. support or participate in U.N.  peacekeeping
operations?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Only when it serves U.S. national interests. There are  many
humanitarian crises in the world, but neither the U.S. nor the  U.N. 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 19 -->  has the resources to deal with
every one. When America does  participate, U.S. troops must remain under U.S. or
allied, rather  than U.N., command. A peacekeeping mission must have clear 
command and control arrangements, adequate force, appropriate  criteria for
success, a definite endpoint, and a plan for  disengagement once success is
achieved. As a rule, U.S. military forces  should engage in allied combat
operations when their employment is  decisive, unique, and make the difference
between success and failure.

<P>The U.S. military exists for one principal reason: to fight and  win the
nation's wars. But an effective military force depends on  more than weapons,
equipment, and adequate defense budgets.  Such intangible human factors as
leadership, esprit de corps,  morale, mutual trust, and unit cohesion are as
vital to an effective  combat force as the material factors. These intangible
elements make  up the &quot;warrior ethos&quot; that is needed if U.S. armed
forces are to  win America's wars.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>This ethos is under siege. The Clinton Administration has tried  to put
homosexuals in the military and women in combat  positions. This agenda of
political correctness will undermine the  combat effectiveness of U.S. forces if
allowed to continue unchecked. It  is eroding morale and corroding the mutual
trust that must exist in  an effective fighting organization.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The goal of this agenda is to re-create the military services in  a 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 20 -->  fashionable, liberal image.
Liberal social activists who exercise  an inordinate influence on the Clinton
Administration view the  military as a federally sponsored vehicle for social 
experimentation. Because they see it as the last bastion of &quot;male
domination,&quot;  liberals want to de-masculinize the military regardless of
the effect  on its capacity to do its only job, which is to fight and win 
America's wars. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Because the military is a command hierarchy, liberal social  activists
believe they can impose their agenda from the top down.  Most service members
oppose social engineering of this kind  because they know it saps the fighting
power of the services, and thus  exposes them to greater danger. But they are
intimidated from  speaking out, and often find their careers in jeopardy if they
do not  embrace the &quot;diversity&quot; agenda imposed on them from above.

</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>*</B>     Former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs General Colin
Powell,  all serving Chiefs of Staff, and most former members of the  Joint
Chiefs have stated unequivocally that acknowledged  homosexuals in the
military's ranks are harmful to the good order and  discipline of the services.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>      Women currently make up approximately 12 percent of the  U.S.
armed forces, more than any other nation's military. While  women do not serve
in so-called direct combat positions in the  infantry, armored, or field
artillery units, many are being assigned to  combat support units, combatant
ships, and pilot billets which put  them in harm's way. These assignments
inevitably would put women  in combat during a war.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 21 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     During the Persian Gulf War, American women soldiers  were
taken prisoner for the first time in U.S. history. These women  were sexually
abused by Iraqi captors. The possibility that women  prisoners will be raped and
tortured, or that large numbers of  women will be killed and wounded in action,
could have a  dramatically negative effect on American public opinion and on the
 nation's ability to prosecute a war. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     No other nation places women in combat posts, not even 
Israel, despite a common misconception to the contrary and even  though Israel
has a manpower shortage. Israel used women in combat  for a short time during
its war of independence and made it  policy never to do so again except in the
most dire national  emergencies. In the Israel Defense Force, women do receive
basic combat  training and may be attached to combat units in support roles, but
 they do not take part in combat operations. (Recently, the Israeli  Supreme
Court directed the Israeli armed forces to permit a  woman to train as a combat
pilot; she has since dropped out of flight  training.) Other nations, such as
Denmark, allow women to serve  in combat units but also note that they are not
likely to see combat.  In any event, Denmark concedes that its policy was
undertaken  to satisfy contemporary social mores and could hurt unit  cohesion
and combat readiness. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     Introducing women into all combat specialties means creating 
two different standards in order to account for the physiological  differences
between women and men. A combat unit's effectiveness  is predicated on unit
cohesion, which is based in turn on the bonds  of trust among soldiers in a
unit. Training to two different  standards is the surest way to wreck unit
morale, raising problems of  favorit
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 22 -->  ism and of training that does not
meet the standard required by  the mission.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Putting women in combat units degrades combat readiness.  For instance,
pregnant women are not able to deploy on military  missions with their units,
causing further problems of morale,  unit cohesion, and readiness. The aircraft
carrier USS Eisenhower  is the first U.S. naval ship to try to integrate men and
women. In  the first six months of a recent deployment, 14 women on  the
Eisenhower became pregnant while on cruise, and were freed  from their duties.
The message sent to sailors is that there are  different standards for men and
women, standards that are based not on  the capability of the individual to help
the team win in combat, but  on one's sex.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><A NAME="RECORD2">THE RECORD</A></B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>President Clinton has instituted policies that would put women  in combat
and homosexuals in the military. Because the  President comes from an
aggressively anti-military background, these  decisions as Commander in Chief
have been resisted by the  American military establishment.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>For example, on April 28, 1993, the Clinton Administration  announced that
the Department of Defense would open certain  combat aviation positions to
women. This change in policy affected  all three services and made women
available for duty in all  aviation units, including air cavalry units in the
Army. Women  currently are barred only from direct participation in infantry,
armor,  and some artillery units.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 23 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Moreover, early in his Administration, the President revoked  the
long-standing military ban on homosexuals, establishing instead  a fuzzy &quot;don't
ask, don't tell&quot; policy that simply prohibits open  displays of
homosexuality. This policy is a poor compromise  between the President and the
Joint Chiefs of Staff, who were  concerned about the adverse impact of lifting
the ban. It makes it  technically legal for homosexuals to serve in the armed
forces, but also  allows them to be discharged for openly displaying homosexual 
behavior. As might be expected from such an ambiguous compromise,  the policy
has been challenged in several court cases but with  unclear results, being
upheld in some decisions and struck down in  others. Congress has hidden behind
the compromise language, refusing  to hold hearings or conduct proper oversight
of Defense  Department regulations implementing the law prohibiting open 
homosexuals from serving, as passed in the FY 1995 Defense authorization bill. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> President Clinton also objected to provisions in the 1996  Defense
authorization bill that allow the military to  discharge servicemembers
diagnosed with HIV, the virus that causes  AIDS. This ban was imposed because
HIV-positive  servicemembers could infect other members in combat operations.
This is in  keeping with existing military policy that prevents the deployment 
of servicemembers with other contagious or debilitating  diseases. President
Clinton maintains that this discriminates against  HIV-positive personnel; the
Department of Defense maintains that  because HIV-positive servicemembers cannot
serve on  deployments, they should not continue to serve while others must
deploy in  their place. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>WHAT TO DO IN 1997
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 24 --> 
</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>To ensure that the U.S. military continues to do its job of  fighting and
winning America's wars, the Administration and  Congress should:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Return to the Chiefs of Staff the power to determine social 
policies based on the requirement to fight and win in combat.</B> The  service
Chiefs are charged by law to provide the best military advice to  the President
and Secretary of Defense, and the best command  guidance to their respective
services. They have a heavy  responsibility and must be allowed to put the
nation's defense needs and  the combat capabilities of the services ahead of the
political  pressures or passing social agendas of the moment.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Eliminate the Defense Advisory Committee on Women in the  Service.</B>
This committee was set up after the Korean War to advise  the Chiefs of Staff on
women's issues in the service. Over the  years, however, it has become a vehicle
for promoting the  legislative agendas of militant homosexual lobbies, feminist 
organizations, and other liberal pressure groups. In addition, similar 
organizations in the services should be focused on the challenge of  maintaining
equality and professionalism in the military while promoting  the warrior ethos
and military ethic among all members of the  service. They should not advance
the radical agendas of groups who  view the military as &quot;just another job&quot;
and believe it needs to be  restructured so its values and ethics are in line
with those of  contemporary society.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Ensure that the military oversight committees of Congress  protect
the careers of loyal service officers who properly advise  against the social
engineering agenda.</B> For instance, congressional  oversight  which includes
final approval of military promotion lists   
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 25 -->  must ensure that exemplary
officers like Commander  Robert Stumpf, U.S. Navy, are not ridden out of the
service as the  result of a political correctness witch hunt. Commander Stumpf,
a  Naval aviator and former commander of the Navy's precision  combat flying
team, was denied promotion because he attended the  notorious Tailhook
convention in 1991. Even though a Navy  investigation completely exonerated him
of any connection with the  events of Tailhook, Commander Stumpf was denied
promotion by a  Senate Armed Services Committee policy that the Navy notify  the
committee of all officers who attended the Tailhook  convention. Such egregious
bows to political correctness are nonsensical,  unjust, and damaging to morale.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Abandon the confusing &quot;don't ask, don't tell&quot; policy 
regarding homosexuals in the military.</B> This policy is a clear example of  a
President who wants to have his cake and eat it too. As a result,  the policy is
under legal challenge in two different courts and  most likely will need to be
settled by the Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><A NAME="Q&A2">Q &amp; A</A></B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Why should the services ban women from combat and  homosexuals from
military service?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Advocates of women in combat and homosexuals in the  military
view military service as similar to any other job and  assume that gender or
sexual orientation are insignificant in the  military environment. They are
wrong. Combat is a team endeavor and  the most demanding environment 
physically, mentally, and  morally  that one can endure. It is not a &quot;job&quot;
but a life-and-death  under
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 26 -->  taking. The primary criterion for
inclusion must be the ability  of the individual to enhance  not to detract from
 the  effectiveness of the unit. A military organization functions best when 
differences among individuals in a unit are minimized. That is why  soldiers are
required to look, act, dress, and train alike. It makes  no sense to break down
all of these differences only to inject  the greatest difference of all 
individual sexual identity  into a unit.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Professional military judgment and experience indicate that  mixing known
homosexuals with heterosexuals undermines  cohesion and combat effectiveness.
Common sense suggests that men  and women distract each other even when trying
not to do so. In  combat, such distractions can be the difference between life
and  death. The purpose of the military is to build the most effective  fighting
force to defeat an enemy as quickly, and with as few  American casualties, as
possible. Differences in sexual identity will  weaken discipline and
effectiveness, thus making it more difficult to  prevail in combat.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Access to the military has never been based on what is &quot;fair.&quot;  
Military service is a privilege and sometimes a duty, but never  a right.
Because victories in combat are achieved by cohesive  units, the armed forces
routinely sacrifice individual interests to  ensure unit cohesion. Military
service is legally restricted or denied  to patriotic Americans who are too
tall, too short, too fat,  color-blind, flat-footed, or mentally or physically
handicapped. This is no  reflection on the inherent worth of these individuals;
they simply  do not meet the military's needs.<A
HREF="ftnt16.htm#12">12</A>  For the same reason,  women
should be barred from combat and known homosexuals should  be excluded entirely
from military service.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 27 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Before the military was desegregated in 1948, many of  the same
arguments used today to oppose gays in the military  were used to oppose blacks
in the service. Can't America's GIs learn  to live and work with homosexuals in
the same way they learned  to live and work with black Americans?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> As General Powell  himself a black man  has explained,  being
black is a benign condition, a matter of birth. On the  other hand, homosexual
activity is not. It is a gross fallacy to equate  the two. Moreover, black
Americans have proven themselves on  the field of battle and in every other
military function. They  have made remarkable contributions to the military and
to the  nation's security, and are recognized universally among the best 
soldiers, sailors, Marines, and airmen in the world. On the other hand,  the
open acceptance of homosexuality in the ranks almost  always causes problems of
morale and discipline.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. If a woman can perform the same job as a man, why  can't women hold
combat jobs?  To limit women to support roles  also limits their career
opportunities for advancement in the military.
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> The fundamental purpose of military service is to  defend
America, not to advance careers. There can be only one  standard for a warrior,
and that is determined by what it takes to fight  and win in combat. The great
majority of women in the military,  and even some men, cannot meet the physical
standards required  for service in combat units. Having different standards for
men  and women would ruin morale and unit cohesion. Putting women  in combat
also would raise a host of thorny questions, among  them: How will the
inevitable formation of male-female special  relationships affect discipline and
unit cohesion, which are essential  to 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 28 -->  success in combat?  How can a
woman's privacy be respected  adequately in combat conditions?  What would be
the effect  on troops and the impact on public support for a combat mission if 
a number of females were taken prisoner and abused by their  captors or
exploited for psychological warfare or propaganda advantage?   How would
official and legal efforts to prevent sexual  harassment of women prevent the
rise of double standards and the  inevitable breakdown of morale and unit
cohesion?

<P><B>A</B>merica is a global power with vital interests in key regions of 
the world, specifically in Europe, Asia, Latin America, and the  Middle East.
America fought two world wars in this century to  preserve freedom and stability
in Europe and the Asia-Pacific region,  and then endured the long twilight
struggle of the Cold War,  including shooting wars in Korea and Vietnam, to
protect Europe and  Asia from communist domination. In effect, the U.S. is both
a  European and Pacific power. It has maintained a military presence in  Europe
and Asia since the end of the Second World War to protect  vital links of trade,
communication, and cultural exchange. And  even though the Cold War is over,
U.S. security interests still  require America's military, political, and
economic involvement in  European and Asian affairs.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Persian Gulf War dramatized the vital interests of  America and the
world's industrialized democracies in the Middle  East. U.S. air and naval
forces patrol the Eastern Mediterranean  and keep watch on the potential threat
from Iraq and Iran to the  Persian Gulf, still the source of much of the free
world's energy  supplies. In fact, the U.S. depends more on crude oil from the
Gulf  today than it did when Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>To make the world safe for America, the U.S. needs to keep  the 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 2 -->  vital regions of Europe, Asia, and
the Persian Gulf free of  hostile domination. This strategy requires a mixture
of diplomacy  and military deterrence. The U.S. must maintain its military 
alliances in these regions and adapt them to new conditions. At the  same time,
new types of relationships with friends and allies, based  on trade and
commercial ties, must be advanced to supplement  (and possibly, in some cases,
replace) old ones based on military  alliances.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>To protect America's interests in various regions of the world,  the U.S.
needs some forces deployed overseas, the capability to  respond rapidly and
effectively to regional crises, and the ability  to support U.S. forces that
have been deployed overseas from  the continental United States. Effective
regional security  strategies, coupled with the means and the will to carry them
out, not  only will allow the U.S. to prevail in the event of a conflict, but 
also may deter aggression in the first place.

<a href="bosnia.gif">Map 1</a>: The NATO Mission in Bosnia: Operation Joint Endeavor
<p>
<B><A NAME="ISSUES">THE ISSUES
</A></B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>During the Cold War, the U.S. was primarily responsible for  guaranteeing
that Western Europe would not be dominated by a  hostile power. With the demise
of the Soviet Union, many  Americans wonder what role America should play in
Europe and exactly  how the American role in the Atlantic alliance should be
defined. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Some Americans believe that the U.S. should simply pull its  military forces
out of Europe. Others warn against such an action.  Historically, when it has
taken no notice of European affairs, the  U.S. 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 3 -->  has been called upon to intervene
in conflicts that threaten the  global balance of power and the safety of
America as well. This  was the case in the First and Second World Wars and
during the  Cold War. Proponents of U.S. military involvement in Europe argue 
that America had to help defend Europe in order to defend the  security and
liberty of the American people. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The issue today is how to structure America's participation in  European
security. Should the U.S. be primarily a peacemaker in  settling civil wars like
the one in Bosnia?  Or should it confine  itself to the core mission of
collective defense, defending Europe  from major power threats regardless of the
source or sources of  those threats? 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>These questions are at the heart of the debate over NATO's  future. NATO has
been undergoing an identity crisis since the  Soviet Union collapsed. At issue
is whether the U.S. and its allies, in  order to make NATO more relevant, should
task the alliance  with out-of-area missions, including peacekeeping, peace 
enforcement, and other security activities NATO was never intended to  perform.
But this search for a new role could turn NATO into an  organization like the
United Nations, which, because of its many  different members and missions, is
not suited to organizing and  directing significant military operations. In the
end, some fear NATO  could become no more effective than the U.N. is now.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>For some in America, the question is not how the U.S. role  in NATO should
be defined, but whether the U.S. should be  in NATO at all. Others argue that
America's 100,000 troops in  Europe act as a stabilizing force that enhances
European  security; they believe that the American military presence in Europe
is  an 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 4 -->  insurance policy against the
threat of war between any of  Europe's major powers. The cost of maintaining
these troops is a matter  for legitimate debate, but given the costs of a
European  conflagration, it is well worth paying. Those Americans who advocate 
pulling U.S. military forces out of Europe or reducing the U.S. presence  to a
skeleton force are saying, in essence, that the U.S. has no  vital national
interests in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Another contentious NATO issue involves the peacekeeping  operation in
Bosnia-Herzegovina. The U.S. is heavily involved in  the NATO Peace
Implementation Force in Bosnia, and while  the Clinton Administration has
promised to end the mission after  a one-year deployment, many questions arise:
If the promised  peace does not take hold, and especially if Americans are drawn
 into combat with one or more Bosnian factions, will the U.S. be able  to
withdraw on schedule?  
</P>
<P>Will the U.S. be able withdraw in the midst of renewed  fighting and
possible American casualties without the appearance of  an ignominious retreat,
and without harming U.S. credibility  and prestige?  What happens if peace has
not taken hold at the end  of one year?  Will the U.S. pull out anyway, bringing
the  European peacekeepers out with it? 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>NATO expansion is another significant issue in the debate  over Europe and
the U.S. role in Europe. NATO expansion would  extend NATO's zone of peace,
democracy, stability, and freedom  to its new members. Many security experts
believe that the  Clinton Administration has dragged its feet on NATO
enlargement out  of fear of offending Russia. They maintain that Russia has an 
implicit veto over extending NATO membership to new democracies  in Central
Europe. However, critics of expansion maintain that  en
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 5 -->  larging NATO will only encourage
an adversarial response  from Russia and may precipitate a return to Cold
War-style  relations. These critics also insist that expanding NATO will dilute
the  alliance, enlarging its commitments while weakening its basic  structure.

<P><B>*</B>     The economic prosperity of the United States is closely tied 
to trade with Europe. Europe is America's second largest  customer, taking 31
percent of American exports and providing 29 percent  of imports. Fifty percent
of direct American investment abroad is  in Europe and over 60 percent of direct
foreign investment in  the U.S. comes from Europe. Over three million Americans
are  employed in the U.S. by European-owned firms, and another 1.5  million
American workers are supported directly by U.S. exports  to Europe.

<P><B>*</B>     The United States maintains approximately 100,000 troops in 
Europe, and most of the troops involved in the Bosnia peace  implementation plan
were taken from U.S. forces based in  Europe. These forces are a key element in
America's national strategy  for two reasons:

regions</B> in which the U.S. might be called to fight.  Approximately half of
the U.S. combat units deployed during  Operation

Europe.

<P><B>*</B>     NATO still consists of the 16 nations that belonged to the 
alliance at the end of the Cold War. France recently decided to rejoin  the
integrated NATO military structure, at least partially, after  leaving it in
1966. Spain, the NATO Secretary-General's home country,  is not integrated fully
into NATO's military structure. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     Besides NATO's 16 full members, there are 27 states enrolled 
in the Clinton Administration's Partnership for Peace program, a  U.S.
initiative that enables non-NATO nations to associate with  and apply for
membership in NATO. Almost every country of  Eastern Europe and the former
Soviet Union is a member of the  Partnership for Peace, designed as an
intermediate step to membership  in NATO. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     A European collective security organization often touted by 
the Russians as a possible substitute for NATO is the Organization  for Security
and Cooperation in Europe. Despite having over 50  members, however, OSCE is
little more than a &quot;talking shop&quot; for  general issues of European
security.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     The Clinton Administration estimates that the Bosnia Peace 
Implementation Force will cost the U.S. between $2 billion and $3  billion per
year, but this does not include costs for the  reconstruction of civilian
infrastructure in Bosnia. Many experts believe that  the actual cost will be
closer to twice that predicted by the  Administration.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     European integration under the auspices of the European  Union
(EU) is proceeding more slowly than expected, and there is  no 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 7 -->  certainty of a federal Europe, a
European army, or even a  unified currency in the immediate future. Last year
the EU expanded  to include Sweden, Finland, and Austria. Further expansion, 
especially in Eastern Europe, is not expected anytime soon,  although most
former Warsaw Pact countries are eager to join the EU.

<P><B><A NAME="RECORD">THE RECORD</A></B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Clinton Administration has dragged its feet on NATO  enlargement and
missed an important window of opportunity for  offering membership to Poland,
the Czech Republic, Hungary,  and Slovakia, the most likely candidates for NATO
membership.  Instead of expanding Europe's zone of peace, security, and  freedom
to Central Europe, President Clinton has taken counsel of his  fears and handed
the Russians an implicit veto over when, where,  and how NATO should expand.
What has the U.S. received in return?   A meaningless Russian troop
participation in the Bosnian  peacekeeping operation  something of only marginal
interest to  the U.S. Every day NATO delays enlargement, opposition from  the
Russians grows. Former communists have regained power in  Central and Eastern
Europe and may soon do the same in Russia.  Unless the U.S. Administration acts
soon, the opportunity to  enlarge NATO may disappear.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The GOP's Contract With America called for NATO expansion  in the form of
near-term membership for Poland, Hungary, the  Czech Republic, and Slovakia.
Both the House and Senate versions of  the foreign operations bill contained
language supporting this  expansion but neither specifically nor legally
mandating a concrete  time frame for expansion.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 8 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Even as the Clinton Administration has delayed NATO  expansion, it has
committed U.S. power and prestige to a questionable  peacekeeping operation in
Bosnia. President Clinton has deployed  over 35,000 U.S. troops to support the
Peace Implementation  Force (IFOR). These troops are stationed in Croatia,
Hungary, Italy,  and afloat in the Adriatic Sea, and include 20,000 U.S. combat 
troops in northeastern Bosnia. His reason: to keep faith with U.S.  allies and
preserve NATO. But failure in Bosnia could wreck the  very cohesion that the
President hopes to preserve. If IFOR  fails, NATO could fail with it.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Administration does not have an exit strategy for U.S.  forces in
Bosnia, the President invented one by promising that U.S.  forces will return
home in &quot;about a year.&quot;  Such an ambiguous and  poorly defined
commitment endangers the U.S. soldiers involved,  opens the door for &quot;mission
creep,&quot; and raises the possibility of a  long and open-ended commitment to
a mission that may never succeed.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The President assumes unrealistically that within a year the  new state of
Bosnia-Herzegovina will have resettled all  refugees, settled all territorial
disputes, conducted free and democratic  elections, and formed a new
constitutional central government  based on an elaborate power-sharing
agreement. Most experts agree  that these issues will take much longer to settle
and that U.S.  troops either will leave too soon to make a lasting contribution
or,  even worse, will be drawn into new roles and mandates that prolong  an
already ill-advised U.S. commitment.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>One of the most troubling issues is what to do with indicted  war criminals.
If NATO tries to arrest them, the aggrieved faction  may pull out of the
agreement. But if these war criminals are ignored  or 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 9 -->  released, the other side may take
matters into its own hands  and resume the fighting.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>From the beginning, Congress was reluctant to support  the Bosnian mission.
On December 13, 1995, the Senate voted  69-30 in favor of the Dole-McCain
resolution, which supports the  men and women in uniform but &quot;does not
endorse the President's  decision [or] the agreement reached in Dayton.&quot; 
The House was  more critical and voted 287-141 to condemn the mission while 
expressing support for the troops being deployed.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>WHAT TO DO IN 1997</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>To protect U.S. interests in Europe, the Administration and  Congress
should:
</P>
<P><B>*     Declare that America's vital national interest in Europe lies in 
preventing the domination of the continent by a hostile power or  bloc of
powers.</B> This is a clear and focused national interest. A  major power threat
to Europe would present a political and  economic threat to the peace, security,
and prosperity of the United  States itself, and America must be prepared to
defend this interest  with military action. This is done most effectively
through NATO. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Clearly define the role the U.S. will play in European security 
affairs and NATO.</B> First, an American military role must be  focused on the
core mission of NATO: collective defense. America  can support peacekeeping or
other out-of-area operations, but  the American contribution to NATO operations
should be  focused primarily on this core mission. Second, American military 
involvement should make a unique and decisive contribution to  any NATO
operation. American power will be squandered if it is  used 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 10 -->  only to address peripheral and
marginal security issues that  the European allies are reluctant to undertake
themselves. This  will promote a clear and sensible division of labor with
America's  European allies and show the American people that the Europeans  are
&quot;pulling their weight&quot; as well.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Encourage the Europeans to take the lead in addressing  marginal
and peripheral security problems while guaranteeing an active  U.S. support role
in these endeavors.</B> In the past, an  American-led NATO effort was the only
option available for dealing with  a range of security issues in Europe. The
U.S. must promote a  more flexible range of responses to the many different
types of  security problems in and around Europe. When the U.S. role is 
re-focused on collective defense, the European powers can work  through other
structures (such as the Western European Union or OSCE)  to manage more marginal
security problems. This also will  prevent NATO from trying to become all things
to all people,  thereby minimizing the risk that the alliance could become an 
unwieldy and emasculated collective security organization instead of a  focused
and robust instrument of collective defense.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Offer immediate NATO membership to Poland, Hungary,  the Czech
Republic, and Slovakia and drop the implicit guarantee  of membership for other
countries in the Partnership for Peace.</B>  The addition of these countries to
Europe will expand NATO's zone  of peace and freedom and contribute to the core
mission of  collective defense against a major power threat to Europe. These 
countries are best suited for NATO membership. They have  demonstrated their
commitment to democracy, and their membership makes  strategic and geopolitical
sense for NATO. While other countries  can maintain a relationship with the PFP
or develop new ties with  the 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 11 -->  Western European Union, these
four Central European  countries should be the only new members admitted to NATO
itself.  Any more countries would be practically impossible for NATO to  defend
and assimilate.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Lower expectations for &quot;success&quot; in the Bosnia peace 
implementation mission.</B> This can be done by limiting the U.S. military role 
to purely military functions and to operations that are both  clearly definable
and achievable. Above all, the U.S. must avoid  &quot;mission creep,&quot; or
escalation of the mission, in which IFOR might be  given long-term
nation-building or war crimes tasks. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Encourage the European Union to maintain free trading  relations
with the U.S. and avoid instituting protectionist trade  measures.</B> The U.S.
should offer a Transatlantic Free Trade Area to  interested European countries,
including those in Central and Eastern  Europe. This should be initiated through
a &quot;framework agreement&quot;  to ensure that the EU and the U.S. stay on
track to create a  world-wide free trade regime in line with the WTO and GATT 
agreements. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><A NAME="Q&A">Q &amp; A</A></B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. The Cold War is over, and Europe is now full of many  prosperous
democratic states. Can't they bear the burden of their own  security?  Why do we
need to keep hundreds of thousands of  American troops over there?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> To defend our own freedom and security. A secure Europe is  a
vital U.S. interest. American freedom could not long endure if  all of Europe
with its resources and power were turned against  us. 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 12 -->  Besides, the continued peace and
stability of Europe gives  considerable economic benefit to the United States.
Europe takes  almost one-third of U.S. exports and supplies 30 percent of
American  imports. Almost half of U.S. direct investment abroad is in Europe. 
In addition, millions of Americans are employed in the U.S. by  European-owned
firms, and millions more are supported by U.S.  exports to Europe.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Won't NATO expansion alienate Russia and risk creating a  new Cold
War with a new Iron Curtain in Europe?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> NATO membership brings security and stability. Therefore,  by
extending membership to Poland, the Czech Republic,  Slovakia, and Hungary, NATO
can help stabilize an area of Europe that  has rarely been either stable or
prosperous. NATO can work with  Moscow throughout this process to explain that
limited enlargement  is no threat to Russia. This should be done while the U.S.
has  relatively good relations with a friendly Russian administration.  The
return to power of a more nationalist Russian administration  is possible down
the road and would make NATO expansion  considerably more difficult. In any
event, however, Russian opposition  to NATO expansion is motivated mainly by
internal political  debates and economic instability, not by any real fear of
the West.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Won't expanding NATO just draw a line between East  and West, fueling
a new Cold War?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> This is a line that inevitably must be drawn somewhere, 
sometime, unless you assume Russia will become a NATO member   something that is
both inadvisable and highly unlikely. Those  who complain about drawing lines
between East and West are  really 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 13 -->  saying that they do not want the
free and democratic systems  of Western Europe moved east. NATO need not expand
to all  countries in Central and Eastern Europe, but it should incorporate 
those Central European states that strategically make sense to  NATO and which
politically, economically, and culturally already are  part of Western Europe.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Why should U.S. soldiers fight and die in a place like Bosnia?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> U.S. soldiers should not fight and die in Bosnia, at least  under
current circumstances. American troops should be committed  to hostilities only
where their sacrifice is needed to protect  America's vital national interests.
That interest in Europe is to prevent  the continent from being dominated by a
hostile power or bloc of  powers. This is the core mission of NATO. American
combat  troops should not be deployed in the middle of peripheral civil wars  in
order to enforce a tenuous and cosmetic peace. The contribution  of American
combat forces to NATO must be unique and decisive,  as well as oriented toward
NATO's core mission of collective  defense.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. What are U.S. interests in the Balkans?  What should we  do there now
that we are involved in the peacekeeping operation?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> The U.S. has a vital national interest in ensuring that Europe 
is not threatened by a major hostile power. To guarantee that  this vital
interest is protected, the U.S. should be willing to use  American combat
forces. The ethnic conflict in Bosnia does not  threaten the peace and stability
of Europe in this way. However, the  U.S. can assist the lead efforts of its
European allies in containing  and helping to resolve this conflict. The U.S.
can provide  logistical, 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 14 -->  intelligence, and air support for
European peacekeeping  operations, but American troops need not be involved
where  European troops can do the job. However, now that U.S. troops are there 
as part of IFOR, the U.S. should ensure that their mission is limited  to purely
military operations. Military objectives should be  clearly defined, and upon
achieving them, U.S. military forces  should leave. U.S. forces should not be
involved in rebuilding  Bosnia's political, economic, or social institutions.
This would be the  first step on the road to &quot;mission creep&quot; and would
ensure that  U.S. forces are drawn into the conflict with no clear exit in
sight.

<a href="korea.gif">Map 3</a>: The Korean Peninsula: 37,000 American Troops Deterring North Korea's Million-Man Army
<p>
<P><A NAME="ISSUESA"><B>THE ISSUES
</B></A></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>America's interests in Asia have remained consistent for two  centuries.
These interests are freedom of navigation, commercial  access to markets, and
preventing the domination of the region by  a hostile power or coalition of such
powers. The question  looming before America today is whether the United States
will retain  the leadership role in Asia required to defend these interests. 
After over three years of indecisive and faulty leadership from  the Clinton
Administration, the U.S. leadership role is in doubt.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Nowhere is this more evident than in the President's policies  toward the
People's Republic of China (PRC). The Clinton  Administration has failed to
follow a consistent and coherent strategy  in dealing with China. As a result,
the U.S. has lost much of its  credibility in the region. For example, the
President, like many  liberals, tried to link trade with China to Beijing's
performance on  human rights issues. Conservatives, on the other hand, believing
that  the 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 15 -->  best way to encourage democracy
and promote human rights  is through open trade, opposed early attempts by
Clinton to  deny China most-favored-nation trading status. Ultimately, the 
President had to reverse course, implicitly admitting the bankruptcy of  his
policies, but his inconstancy weakened his hand in dealing  with the Chinese and
undermined U.S. credibility in the region.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Another important issue is how to deal with the PRC's attempts  to
intimidate the Republic of China on Taiwan (ROC). Bill  Clinton has demonstrated
an inclination to succumb to bullying  from Beijing. In early 1995, he sided at
first with the mainland  Chinese against granting a visa to permit Taiwan's
President, Lee  Teng-hui, to make an unofficial visit to the United States. He 
reversed course abruptly, granting the visa in May 1995, but only after 
pressure from Congress. Subsequently, the President was  painfully slow to
recognize the seriousness of Beijing's threats of  military force against the
ROC, including the testing of  nuclear-capable missiles in the vicinity of
Taiwan. Even when the  Administration abandoned its policy of ineffectual
diplomacy in March, after  three test missiles landed near two Taiwanese ports,
the Clinton  team shrank from labeling the Chinese actions for what they are  
political terrorism. Finally, mainly because of opposition  from Beijing,
Clinton has failed to provide adequate support  for Taiwan's entry into
international economic organizations like  the World Trade Organization, the
World Bank, and the  International Monetary Fund. Taiwan deserves membership in
these  organizations because of its growing status as an economic  powerhouse
and emerging democracy in Asia.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Opponents of the President's China policies argue that  Beijing should not
be allowed to dictate the terms of America's  unofficial 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 16 -->  relations with Taiwan  terms
established by the 1979  Taiwan Relations Act (TRA), which stipulates that
although the U.S.  does not have official relations with the ROC, it does stand
ready  to help Taiwan defend itself. Critics of the President insist that 
Taiwan should have the weapons necessary to defend its security  and that, if
necessary, the U.S. should provide the ROC with  these weapons. In particular,
it should be working with Taiwan to  build a defense against the PRC's ballistic
missiles, which threaten  Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>On the Korean peninsula, the issue is how to restore trust and  confidence
to the U.S.-South Korea alliance. In pursuing its  nuclear bargain with North
Korea, called the Agreed Framework,  the Clinton Administration marginalized the
role of its ally South  Korea. Negotiating directly with North Korea, the U.S. 
got Pyongyang to freeze its nuclear weapons program in return  for help in
converting its nuclear reactors to peaceful purposes.  The North has used the
agreement to open a direct channel to the  U.S. while continuing to vilify and
shun South Korea.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Opponents of Clinton's policies contend that this approach  has damaged
relations with an important ally, South Korea. They  also insist that progress
in the North-South dialogue should be linked  to implementation of the Framework
Agreement. America has a  vital interest in deterring a North Korean attack on
the South  an  interest that has not been given adequate attention by the
Clinton  Administration. North Korea's million-man army stands only a  few miles
away from the South Korean capital of Seoul and the  37,000 U.S. troops near the
North-South border. Reducing this  conventional military threat from the North
should be equally as  important as eliminating Pyongyang's nuclear weapons
potential.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 17 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>On Japan, the issue dividing Clinton and his opponents is how  best to
sustain and strengthen the U.S.-Japan alliance while  advancing deregulation and
the further opening of Japan's markets.  Critics argue that Bill Clinton made
two fundamental mistakes in  his policy toward Japan: He put economics and trade
at the center  of the U.S.-Japan relationship, and he attempted to use a highly 
confrontational managed-trade strategy to force internal change  in Japan.
Neither policy worked. Clinton's November 1994 and  June 1995 trade deals with
Japan did little to open Japan's market  to U.S. goods; instead they damaged
U.S.-Japan military alliance.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The U.S.-Japan security alliance remains the key to peace  and prosperity in
Asia. Relations with Japan must be managed  with this fact in mind. This is a
realization Bill Clinton came to  only belatedly. In 1995, the Pentagon, under
the leadership of  Assistant Secretary Joseph Nye, undertook a major initiative
aimed  at strengthening the alliance; at the same time, the Clinton trade  team
backed off from its confrontational approach. Managed trade is  not the answer
to the trade deficit with Japan; it only reinforces  the clout of bureaucratic
elements hostile to free trade. A far  better approach, Clinton's critics
maintain, is for the U.S. to  support forces inside Japan advocating
deregulation and the further  opening of Japan's market. These are America's
allies inside Japan.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>On trade in Asia, the issue is whether the U.S. will or will not  take the
lead in opening up Asian markets to U.S. goods and  services. Bill Clinton
claims to support trade liberalization in Asia, but  he leaves the heavy lifting
to others. In 1994, the President agreed  to work with leaders of the
Asia-Pacific Economic  Cooperation (APEC) forum to create an Asia-Pacific
free-trade area by the  year 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 18 -->  2020. But at an APEC meeting in
Tokyo last year, he not  only failed to show up; he also left the U.S.
delegation without  authority to make substantial commitments on his behalf.
Critics  believe the President's commitment to APEC and free trade in Asia  is
lukewarm and largely rhetorical. To advance free trade and  American prosperity,
they believe, the President should ask Congress  for &quot;fast-track&quot;
authority to negotiate free-trade agreements in  Asia and elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The major issue in Southeast Asia is how to respond to rising  instability
in Cambodia, where Bill Clinton has failed to use the  leverage provided by U.S.
economic assistance to advance  American interests. Indifferent to Washington's
diplomatic protests, the  government of Cambodia has proceeded to ban political 
opposition parties, attack press freedoms, and even assassinate  journalists.
Critics of the President argue that the U.S. should not tolerate  such assaults
on the democratically elected government in  Cambodia and that future U.S.
economic assistance must depend  on Cambodia's respect for democratic freedoms
and human rights.

</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>*</B>     Asia is the home of the world's most dynamic and
most  rapidly growing economies. America's two-way trade across the Pacific  is
now approximately one-third larger than America's trade with  Europe.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     Exports to Asia in 1994 totaled more than $153 billion, with 
the nations of the region purchasing $45 billion more from  American companies
than the 15 nations of the European Union and  $30 billion more than Europe as a
whole. In 1994, more than 3  million 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 19 -->  Americans owed their jobs to U.S.
exports to Asia, and of these  3 million jobs, more than 428,000 were created in
1994 alone.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     The most immediate threat to U.S. security interests comes 
from North Korea's enduring hostility toward South Korea, a U.S.  ally. During
the 1970s and 1980s, North Korea pursued a nuclear  weapons development program,
now frozen under the 1994  Framework Agreement between the U.S. and North Korea.
North  Korea's graphite-moderated reactors have produced between 7 and 22 
kilograms of plutonium, enough for from 2 to 6 nuclear devices.  In addition,
North Korea has an active missile development  program; its Soviet-made <I>SCUD
</I>ballistic missiles are capable of  reaching Seoul, the capital of the
Republic of Korea, and even  threatening U.S. forces stationed in Japan. And its
million-man  conventional army remains deployed within 26 miles of Seoul. South 
Korean active-duty forces number approximately 650,000; U.S. forces  in the
Republic of Korea number approximately 37,000, forward  deployed mostly along
the 38th parallel.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>      A second major threat to U.S. security interests arises  from
China's aggressive behavior. In February 1995, the Chinese  navy occupied
Mischief Reef, an atoll in the South China Sea  well within the Philippines'
Exclusive Economic Zone, which is  internationally recognized by the Law of the
Sea Convention.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     Against the Republic of China on Taiwan, Beijing has conducted
 a campaign of military intimidation in response to the visit to  the United
States of Taiwanese President Lee Teng-hui. This  campaign was highlighted by
Beijing's testing of nuclear-capable  intermediate range ballistic missiles 100
miles north of Taiwan.  Six test firings of these missiles took place on July
21-26 1995.  On 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 20 -->  March 8, 1995, China fired three
test M-9 missiles into two  zones astride Taiwan's largest ports and near
international sea and  air lanes. The M-9 missile can carry conventional,
chemical,  or nuclear warheads.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     In l978, the U.S. diplomatically recognized the People's 
Republic of China as the sole government of China. However, the U.S.  has
maintained unofficial relations with the Republic of China on  Taiwan under the
Taiwan Relations Act (TRA) of 1979. The TRA  has allowed the U.S. to maintain
commercial, educational,  cultural, and defense  but not diplomatic  relations
with Taiwan.  The U.S. acknowledges that Beijing claims a &quot;One-China 
policy,&quot; which the PRC interprets as including sovereignty over  Taiwan,
but the U.S. does not officially recognize the legitimacy of  this claim.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     The Republic of China on Taiwan held its first democratic 
presidential elections on March 23, 1996. President Lee Teng-hui  was elected in
an overwhelming victory, despite weeks of  Chinese threats and saber-rattling.
This was the first democratic election  of a leader in Chinese history.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     The Republic of China on Taiwan, like the PRC, has made clear 
its interest in joining the World Trade Organization (WTO).  This body was set
up in 1995 under the auspices of the General  Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, or
GATT. Thus far, however,  neither the ROC nor the PRC has met the requirements
for WTO  membership.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     Japan is America's largest overseas market, importing more 
goods and services from the U.S. than the United Kingdom and  Germany 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 21 -->  combined. Japan imported some $70
billion in goods and  services from the U.S. in 1994, supporting 1.4 million
American jobs.  Over 60 percent of U.S. exports to Japan is made up of 
manufactured goods, which support 840,000 American jobs. Japan is  America's
largest overseas market for agricultural products.
</P>
<P>

<P><B><A NAME="RECORDA">THE RECORD</A></B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Clinton Administration's record in Asia is one of  confusion and failed
leadership. In a startling admission, Clinton's own  Assistant Secretary for
East Asian and Pacific Affairs, Winston  Lord, in 1994 said that the
Administration's Asia policies have  produced an &quot;emerging malaise&quot; 
an environment in which &quot;Asian  and others view us as placating domestic
special interest groups  and 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 22 -->  criticize us for tactics that
destabilize relationships which are  central to the region's peace and 
prosperity.&quot;<A HREF="ftnt17.htm#1">1</A>  Unfortunately,
the mid-course corrections which Lord called for have not been  made. As a
result, the danger of lost influence has only increased.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Risking Alliances with Japan and the Republic of Korea.  The Clinton
Administration's Japan policy, focused initially on  efforts to manage trade,
has been acrimonious and counterproductive.  In 1993-1995 talks with the
Japanese, the Clinton trade team  demanded that the Japanese government accept
numerical targets  or indicators to ensure that the U.S. trade deficit with
Japan would  be reduced. While taking constructive steps toward deregulation, 
the Japanese government successfully resisted the U.S. demand  for enforceable
targets. After denying that its confrontational  trade policies were harming the
U.S.-Japan alliance, the  Administration, led by the Pentagon, in 1995 belatedly
engaged in a damage  limitation effort to reaffirm the alliance. Known as the
Nye  Initiative, after then-Assistant Secretary of Defense Joseph Nye, this 
undertaking publicly highlighted the importance of the security  relationship
with Japan. But U.S. relations with Japan received  another blow in late 1995
when, citing domestic priorities during the  November budget negotiations with
Congress, the President  canceled a scheduled trip to Tokyo which was supposed
to be the  centerpiece of this campaign to reaffirm the U.S.-Japan  alliance.
Clinton's Asian advisors had warned that shunning the  Japanese would amount to
&quot;a body-blow&quot; to the alliance. To patch up  relations, Clinton
scheduled a summit with the Japanese in April 1996.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Another key relationship in Asia has been weakened by  the President's
policies toward the Republic of Korea. A  democracy and free-market economy,
South Korea is a military ally of  the 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 23 -->  United States. This alliance is
aimed at Communist North  Korea, which remains focused on uniting the Korean
peninsula under  its leadership. In addition to the threat of its million-man
army,  North Korea has long been suspected of pursuing a nuclear weapons 
development program. The Clinton Administration struck a  diplomatic bargain
with North Korea in October 1994 to freeze  its nuclear program in exchange for
internationally financed and  constructed light water reactors. Thus was born
the U.S.-North  Korean Agreed Framework, which permits North Korea to put off
for  at least five years international inspections of its nuclear  facilities.
These inspections are required by the Non-Proliferation Treaty  of 1968, to
which North Korea is a signatory. So far, North Korea  has honored its
commitments in the Framework Agreement and  maintained the freeze on its
reactors, but it remains to be seen  whether it will do so in the future. And
the fact remains that North  Korea was able to extract concessions from the U.S.
in exchange for  doing what it already was obligated to do under international
law.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Perhaps the biggest casualty of the Framework Agreement  has been the trust
and confidence of America's South Korean allies.  In reaching its nuclear
bargain with North Korea, the Clinton  Administration marginalized the input and
role of South Korea in the  negotiations. Indicative of the Clinton
Administration's  diplomacy toward the Korean peninsula, recent opinion polls by
the  United States Information Agency show South Korean support  for America's
military presence in the ROK at 72 percent, down  10 percent from 1994. In
addition, overall opinion of the U.S. is  down and, for the first time in 12
years, more unfavorable (53  percent) than favorable (43 percent).
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>As the record shows, America's Asian alliances, which are key  to 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 24 -->  protecting commerce and U.S.
security interests, have been  weakened by feckless and myopic Administration
leadership. No  one can say whether such damage is permanent, but four more
years  of these policies could set the stage for a general retreat of U.S. 
influence and power from Asia.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Clinton's Misguided China Policy. </B>After campaigning in 1992  to link
most-favored-nation (MFN) trading status for China to  its human rights record,
President Clinton reversed himself in  1994 and, two months after the Chinese
leadership had publicly  humiliated the Secretary of State during his March
visit to  Beijing, dropped its human rights demands and supported MFN for 
China. This was the correct decision, but the Administration's  ill-conceived
linkage strategy forced it into a series of policy retreats  and flip-flops
which have undermined U.S. credibility throughout  the region.<A
HREF="ftnt17.htm#2">2</A>  More and more, America's word in
Asia has come  to matter less and less.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Perhaps the best example was the Administration's mishandling  of ROC
President Lee Teng-hui's visit to the United States in  June 1995. At first, the
Clinton Administration caved in to  Beijing's protests and resisted granting a
visa so that Taiwan's President  Lee could pay an unofficial visit to his alma
mater, Cornell  University. Agreeing with Beijing, the Administration argued
that granting  a visa would violate its &quot;One-China&quot; policy. However,
in  response to nearly unanimous congressional condemnation of its  decision,
the Administration relented and permitted President Lee to make  a private visit
to Cornell last June. While the decision to let  President Lee visit the U.S.
was the right one, it should have been  made at the beginning. The ROC should
have been spared this  painful ordeal that angered all involved and undermined
U.S. credibility.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 25 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In yet another misstep, the Clinton Administration in  February 1995
mishandled the Chinese navy's occupation of Mischief  Reef in the South China
Sea. Mischief Reef is a small atoll well  within the Philippines' 200-mile
Exclusive Economic Zone, but it is in  an area also claimed by China, Taiwan,
and Vietnam. It took  the Clinton Administration three months to respond to this
breach  of international law, and even then it could muster only a mild 
diplomatic protest. In addition to the Mischief Reef episode, China  decided to
express disapproval of U.S. support for President  Lee's visit by conducting
large-scale military maneuvers, including  the firing of nuclear-capable
missiles, in the vicinity of Taiwan.  Only after the Chinese launched these
missiles near two Taiwanese  ports on March 8, 1995, did the Clinton
Administration belatedly  take action, dispatching two aircraft carriers to the
area. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> The President's ineffectual and delayed reactions have  cost America much
in lost prestige and credibility in Asia. The  ROC feels more threatened, the
PRC more emboldened, and the  entire region of Asia more uncertain, not only
about China's  intentions, but also about America's credibility and staying
power.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Half-Hearted Support for Asia-Pacific Free Trade. The  Clinton
Administration's record on advancing U.S. trade interests in  Asia is mixed. In
1994, the President joined other leaders of the  Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) forum in declaring his  support for the idea of a free-trade
and investment area in the  Asia-Pacific region by the year 2020. This is a
worthy goal, but then  the President failed to attend the 1995 APEC meeting in
Tokyo,  which focused on developing a blueprint for implementing the 1994 
declaration. In addition, the U.S. delegation came without the  fast-
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 26 -->  track negotiating authority
needed for the U.S. to move  ahead more quickly with a free-trade agenda, and
U.S. Trade  Representative Mickey Kantor threw roadblocks in the way of gaining 
fast-track authority from Congress. Kantor, for example, refused  to compromise
when Congress opposed environmental and labor  provisions that the President
wanted included in trade treaties.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Failure to Defend the U.S. Investment in Cambodian  Democracy. The U.S. is
in danger of losing its $500 million investment in  the United Nations
peacekeeping operation in Cambodia. In  May 1993, the Cambodian people voted
freely for a government to  be led by non-communist political parties. However,
the  communist Cambodian People's Party (CCP), installed by Vietnam in  1979,
bullied its way into a coalition with the non-communists.  While claiming
Cambodia as one of its supposed diplomatic success  stories, the Clinton
Administration has failed to censure the  government of Cambodia as it has
proceeded to attack press  freedoms, assassinate journalists, and ban opposition
political parties.

<P><B>WHAT TO DO IN 1997</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>To protect U.S. interests in Asia, the U.S. should:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Maintain strong alliances with Japan, the Republic of Korea, 
Australia, the Philippines, and Thailand.</B> For the greater part of the  past
five decades, economic growth and prosperity across the  Pacific have been based
on the security provided by the United  States. Even today, the Cold War's
bilateral alliance structure remains  the firm foundation of regional stability
and security.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Better define U.S. interests and priorities with respect to 
China.</B> 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 27 -->  These are: 1) a peaceful
resolution of issues outstanding  between Beijing and the Republic of China on
Taiwan; 2) non-use of  force by China in the South China Sea; 3) stopping the
proliferation  of missiles and missile technology into the Persian Gulf and 
South Asia; and 4) respect for human rights by China. America  should assume
neither China's friendship nor its hostility. By  sustaining Asian alliances,
clearly defining interests and priorities  toward China, and measuring China's
actions against them, America  can judge the nature of Beijing's intentions and
adopt appropriate  policies. Once these policies are adopted, Washington needs
to stick  to them and not, as the Clinton Administration has done,  abandon them
under pressure from Beijing.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*      Insist that China uphold international standards and &quot;rules
of  the road.&quot;</B>  China's willingness to observe international &quot;rules
of  the road&quot; with respect to non-proliferation, the protection of 
intellectual property, and human rights should be used as a benchmark  to
measure China's conduct as a responsible international  power. China should be
told that the degree to which it will be  respected and integrated into the
international economic and political  community depends on how well it abides by
international rules  and standards.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Support the Republic of China's entry into the World Trade 
Organization.</B> Should the Republic of China meet the criteria for  admission
to the WTO, it should permitted to join. Taiwan's joining  the WTO should not be
held hostage to Beijing's insistence that  the People's Republic of China be
admitted first. This would be  unfair to Taiwan, which is not only one of the
world's most  vibrant economies, but also a democracy.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 28 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Closely monitor implementation of the U.S.-North Korea  Agreed
Framework.</B> North Korea must not be allowed to avoid  compliance with the
terms and conditions of the Framework agreement.  In particular, it must
continue the freeze on its nuclear  program. Should the North restart its
plutonium-producing reactors or fail  to allow inspections of the facilities
agreed to under the terms of  the Framework, the U.S. should build an
international coalition to  support sanctions against Pyongyang.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Expand opportunities for greater American trade with Asia.</B> 
The United States should explore with Australia, New Zealand,  Chile, and
Singapore the possibility of their accession to the  North American Free Trade
Agreement (NAFTA). Similarly,  America should offer to negotiate a merger
between NAFTA and other  existing free-trade agreements, including the
Australia-New  Zealand Closer Economic Relations Agreement (CER) and the  ASEAN
Free Trade Area (AFTA).
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Explore with allies and friends in Asia the construction of an 
integrated anti-missile defense system. North Korea's missile  program threatens
South Korea and Japan, while China's tactical and  strategic missile arsenal is
a threat to the security of the entire  Asia-Pacific region. The U.S. should
equip its own ground and  naval forces with missile defense systems and then
offer to sell  those systems to key allies and friends. Missile defense should
be a  key mission for U.S. forces in Asia in the next decade.
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Restructure America's approach to U.S.-Japan trade issues.</B> 
The Clinton Administration's approach to trade with Japan is based  on using
external pressure to force internal change. This  approach was confrontational
from the outset, and it has not worked.  More
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 29 -->  over, it has damaged the U.S.
military alliance with Japan. A  more effective approach would be to recognize
that change in Japan  is internally driven, and align U.S. trade and economic 
objectives with reformers inside Japan who advocate deregulation and a  further
opening of Japanese markets. For example, the U.S.  should propose a
deregulation summit to Japan, aimed at producing  commitments to an action plan.

<P><B><A NAME="Q&AA">Q &amp; A</A></B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Why does the United States still need to maintain a large  military
presence in Asia?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> The end of the Cold War has not ended threats to peace in  Asia.
North Korea's large conventional military force and its  nuclear program pose a
direct threat to South Korea and Japan, both  of which are U.S. allies. China's
rapid military buildup and its  willingness to use force to pursue territorial
claims in the South  China Sea and against Taiwan also are cause for concern. 
America's military presence in Asia has been reduced significantly  since 1990,
but it remains large enough at its current 100,000-man  level to deter possible
threats. American forces in Japan and South  Korea receive significant financial
support from their host  countries. By helping to preserve peace, the U.S. is
helping Asians  and Americans alike to become more prosperous.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Why does the United States need to press for freer trade  in Asia?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> By pressing to reduce trade barriers, both within Asia and 
between the United States and Asia, Americans will benefit from  the 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 30 -->  jobs created by economic growth.
More U.S. exports mean  more American jobs. In 1994, U.S. exports to Asia grew
at a rate of  16 percent, totaling over $153 billion. In that same year, more
than  3 million Americans owed their jobs to U.S. exports to Asia.  Of these 3
million jobs, more than 428,000 were created in  1994 alone. In addition,
greater prosperity in Asia reinforces  regional stability and strengthens the
democratic political evolution  underway in countries like Taiwan, South Korea,
and the  Philippines. Democracy and stability reduce the risk of armed conflict 
between states.

<P>

<P><A NAME="ISSUESR"><b>THE ISSUES</b>
</A></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The future of U.S.-Russian relations is uncertain. Much  depends on the
outcome of the presidential elections in Russia,  currently scheduled for the
summer of 1996. Among candidates for  the Duma (the lower house of the Russian
parliament) in the  December 1995 elections, communists, nationalists, and their
allies  captured over 50 percent of the popular vote. President Boris  Yeltsin,
who declared his candidacy for the presidency in February 1996,  is trailing the
pack of presidential candidates. The most popular  candidate is Gennady
Zyuganov, leader of the unreformed  Communist Party. Another dangerous contender
is Vladimir Zhirinovsky,  an anti-American ultra-nationalist. Victory for either
Zyuganov  or Zhirinovsky would seriously endanger Russia's young  democracy and
market reforms. A communist or extreme nationalist at  the helm could well put
the world's second-largest nuclear power on  a collision course with the United
States in Central Europe or  the 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 31 -->  Middle East.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>President Yeltsin's own prospects look grim. His health is  failing, and
Russia's internal economic and political crisis continues  unabated. The war in
the breakaway republic of Chechnya  and Russia's economic difficulties have
eroded the popularity  of Yeltsin's administration to the point where polls show
 approval ratings at around 10 percent to 15 percent. Moscow is awash  in rumors
of coups and falsified presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>No one knows who will rule in Moscow by the end of 1996,  but the period of
romantic partnership with the U.S. and the West  is over. Russia is striking out
on its own, taking a path that  already has led to confrontation with the West.
In fact, Russia is in  the midst of a political turbulence fraught with dangers
for the  West, and the chances are good that the next American President  will
have to deal with a new and very different set of players in  Moscow.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>A major point of disagreement between President Clinton and  his U.S.
critics concerns the U.S. support for President Yeltsin.  Critics charge that
the Clinton Administration's continued  unquestioning support for Boris Yeltsin
makes less and less sense. According  to critics, Yeltsin today is presiding
over the return of the  hard-line Soviet nomenklatura to top positions of power.
He has lost  the support of the Russian reformers and is pursuing an 
increasingly confrontational foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Anti-Western sentiments are growing in Russia. Moscow is  attempting to
re-establish its influence in neighboring regions  that once were part of the
Soviet Union. The Kremlin is  employing 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 32 -->  economic, diplomatic, and
military means to achieve a sphere  of economic and military influence in what
Moscow calls its  &quot;near abroad&quot;  the Baltic States, Ukraine, and the
non-Russian states  in Central Asia and the Caucasus that used to be part of the
 Soviet Union but became independent when it collapsed.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>President Clinton's critics believe that preventing the  emergence of a
Russian empire in the lands of the former Soviet Union  should be a top Western
priority, both to help assure the development  and survival of Russian democracy
and to safeguard vital Western  interests. Moreover, an anti-Western policy
could lead Russia  to forge alliances with anti-Western forces in Iran, Iraq,
China,  and Libya. Yet, critics allege, the Clinton Administration has given 
the Russians a free ride in the &quot;near abroad.&quot; 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Critics of the Clinton Administration also claim that the U.S.  has turned a
blind eye to the atrocities in Chechnya. The President  and his aides have bent
over backwards not to offend President  Yeltsin as he has crushed the rebellion,
which so far has resulted in  over 30,000 deaths and more than 300,000 refugees.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>A critical concern is the sale of Russian nuclear reactors to  Iran. The
Islamic regime in Tehran has launched a bid to  acquire nuclear weapons. It is
buying two Russian-made nuclear  reactors capable of producing plutonium that
can be enriched to  become weapons-grade raw material for atomic bombs. The
Russian  Ministry of Foreign Affairs itself does not support this sale, 
believing it could endanger both Russian and Western security.  Nevertheless,
the sale goes on, primarily because of pressure from the  powerful Russian
Ministry of Atomic Industry (MinAtom) headed  by 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 33 -->  Victor Mikhailov.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Another important issue is aid to Russia and the NIS  countries. Aid to
Russia has attracted bipartisan support, but this may  be weakening as Russia
becomes more anti-Western and  expansionist. The Bush and Clinton
Administrations have provided over  $4 billion in aid to Russia since 1992.
Combined aid monies  and loans to the former Soviet Union and Russia for 
1985-1995 amounted to over $100 billion. The results of these aid  programs have
been mixed; critics argue that U.S. aid programs often  disregard Russia's real
needs and are ineffective.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Also dividing President Clinton and his critics is NATO  expansion. The 1994
Contract With America stipulated that NATO  enlargement (to include Poland,
Hungary, and the Czech  Republic) should be a top national priority. However,
the Clinton  Administration has put NATO expansion on the back burner, both to 
secure Moscow's cooperation in peacekeeping in Bosnia and to  appease Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Critics charge also that the President is appeasing Yeltsin on  missile
defense and the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, which bans  the deployment of a
missile defense system from the U.S. The  Clinton Administration opposes
ballistic missile defense (BMD) and  wants to expand the scope of the ABM Treaty
to limit even shorter  range (tactical) missiles  something which it was not
originally  intended to do.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Another point of contention concerns conventional arms  control. The
Conventional Forces in Europe (CFE) treaty places limits  on the numbers of
conventional weapons (such as tanks and  cannon) 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 34 -->  in Europe and Russia. It was
signed with the now-defunct  U.S.S.R. in 1990 after more than two decades of
negotiations. Critics  became worried when Clinton agreed to a unilateral
revision of  the treaty that permitted the Russians to exceed agreed limits on 
conventional weapons in Russia's northern and southern states.  Beefing up the
numbers of tanks and cannon on the borders of  Russia's neighbors, be it the
Baltic States or nations in the Caucasus,  raises questions about Moscow's
long-term intentions. Moreover,  critics point out that Russia is already far
behind on meeting the  weapons system destruction targets stipulated by the CFE
agreement.

<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>*</B>     On August 17, 1991, hard-line elements of the
Communist  Party of the Soviet Union, the Russian army, and the KGB attempted  a
coup against Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev. The coup  was defeated by the
Russian people and Boris Yeltsin, who at the  time was President of the Russian
Federation, then a republic of  the Soviet Union. The coup leaders were put on
trial and jailed  but were released in 1993.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>      The Soviet Union dissolved on December 25, 1991.  Russia,
Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and other former Soviet republics  became independent.
These are often referred to as the Newly  Independent States (NIS).
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>      On September 21, 1993, Boris Yeltsin disbanded the 
Soviet-era Russian parliament. The recalcitrant Supreme Soviet of Russia  had
become the site of intense opposition to Yeltsin and his  market reforms. After
a week-long standoff, Yeltsin ordered the  Russian military to fire on the
parliament building, called the  &quot;White 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 35 -->  House.&quot;  At least 130 people
were killed. The new  parliament, named the State Duma, was elected on December
12, 1993.

attacks  in four months, his behavior is sometimes erratic, and  intelligence
services report that he has a serious drinking problem.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     Presidential elections are scheduled for June 1996. Hard-line 
nationalist and communist forces are on the rise, and the  democratic reformers
are retreating. The main contenders are President  Boris Yeltsin; Gennady
Zyuganov (leader of the communist party);  ultra-nationalist leader Vladimir
Zhirinovsky; economist  Grigory Yavlinsky (a moderate reformer); and retired
General  Alexander Lebed (an authoritarian and charismatic nationalist).
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     Since 1992, Russia has received over $4 billion in direct U.S.
 aid, over $20 billion in total Western aid, and over $50 billion in  loans from
the G-7 countries and multilateral financial  organizations such as the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the  World Bank. Including its holdover
Soviet debts, Russia owes  approximately $130 billion.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>      Russia started a war in the breakaway republic of Chechnya 
in December 1994. So far, over 30,000 people have been killed  and over 300,000
others have become refugees. The war has cost  Russia over $6 billion. Yeltsin
was concerned about the  possible breakup of Russia, as well as the possible
loss of access to  the valuable oil in the Caucasus region.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     Russia joined the Partnership for Peace (PFP), an intermediate
 step for countries wishing to join NATO, in the spring of 1995.  How
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 36 -->  ever, today there is little
likelihood that Russian will join  NATO any time soon. Russia's reaction to the
prospect of NATO's  eastward expansion has been shrill and hostile. Most Russian
 politicians, erroneously claiming that NATO has aggressive  designs against
Russia, are using the NATO expansion issue to build  up nationalism and
anti-Western sentiments at home. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     Russia agreed to cooperate with NATO in a peacekeeping 
mission in Bosnia. In exchange, the Clinton Administration  allegedly promised
not to expand NATO any time soon, acquiesced to  an increase in the number of
conventional weapons in place  on Russia's northern and southern flanks in
violation of the  CFE treaty, and agreed to Russian freedom of action in the
former  Soviet area. Russia has over 2,000 peacekeepers in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     Russia's unilateral violation of the CFE treaty, signed in 
1990, threatens other former Soviet states, such as Ukraine, the  Baltic
countries, Azerbaijan, Armenia, and Georgia. The Russian  military wants to keep
many more tanks, cannon, and other heavy  systems than was originally agreed.
This buildup also jeopardizes the  oil resources of the Caspian Sea and the
independence of  Georgia, Armenia, and Azerbaijan. Moscow claims that it needs 
more heavy weapons to protect its borders, despite the fact that none  of her
neighbors is capable of waging war on Russia.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     Russia has signed agreements to supply at least two nuclear 
power reactors to the militant Islamic regime in Iran, which is  implementing a
nuclear weapons program.

</P>
<P><B>THE RECORD</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>President Clinton has made relations with Boris Yeltsin too  personal. As
Yeltsin's popularity plummeted, Clinton fed the  flames 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 38 -->  of Russian resentment toward the
U.S. with his unequivocal  support of the Russian president, especially after
the dramatic  shooting at the parliament building in October 1993 and the 
beginning of the Chechen war. As a result, the U.S. is now perceived  by many in
the Russian political elite as partisan and uncritically  supportive of
Yeltsin's faltering policies. The Clinton policy has  endangered the ability of
the U.S. to maintain a relationship  with segments of Russian society that
oppose President Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Clinton Administration paid lip service to the idea of  enlarging NATO
to include Poland, Hungary, and the Czech  Republic. However, it has done very
little to make this happen. Critics  accuse the Administration of promising not
to expand NATO  in 1996 in exchange for Russia's cooperation on peacekeeping  in
Bosnia. Republican Members of Congress, who included  NATO expansion in their
Contract With America, generally are more  supportive of a rapid expansion of
NATO than the Clinton  Administration.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Clinton Administration also has been too slow to  recognize the
importance of countries other than Russia. For example,  without Ukraine, the
Russian empire cannot be recreated and will  have only limited access to the
heart of Europe. Azerbaijan  controls vital oil and gas reserves, while Georgia
is situated in a  strategically crucial location in the Caucasus. Nevertheless,
the  Clinton Administration has neglected these countries, promoting a  &quot;Russia-first&quot;
policy and recognizing Moscow's domination of  the &quot;near abroad.&quot;
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Clinton Administration also has failed to prevent the sale  of nuclear
reactors to Iran, despite America's share in the  massive 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 39 -->  financial aid provided to Moscow
by the International  Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and other multilateral
financial  institutions. The reactors are a vital component of the Iranian bid
to  acquire &quot;Islamic&quot; nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>U.S. assistance to the reform efforts in Russia and other  former Soviet
states has been poorly executed. Much of the $4.1 billion  in U.S. assistance
allocated to date has been wasted. The Bush  and Clinton Administrations erred
in choosing the U.S. Agency  for International Development as the main
implementing agency  for assistance. AID has its expertise in the developing
world, not  in post-communist transitional economies. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Russia and other New Independent States (NIS) have become  leading exporters
of crime, together with Colombia, Southeast  Asia, Afghanistan, Iran, and
others. Law and order in Russia have  collapsed, organized crime is merging with
legal government  structures, and it is difficult to say where the mafiosi end
and the  government begins. Many Russian and Eurasian criminal  organizations
operate internationally, including in the United States  and Western Europe.
Russian organized criminals and corrupt  officials have access to weapons and
technology of mass destruction,  including uranium, chemical and biological
weapons, and the  raw materials and components for their manufacture, as well as
 scientists with specific weapons-related expertise. Despite all of  this
evidence, the Clinton Administration has continued to hail the  success of
economic reforms in Russia, failing to raise the crime  and corruption issue in
bilateral talks with the Yeltsin administration.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Clinton Administration championed the START II  nuclear arms reduction
treaty with Russia. The main obstacles to  START 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 40 -->  II ratification are not in
Washington (the U.S. Senate ratified  the treaty on January 26, 1996) but in
Moscow, where a majority  of deputies in the newly elected Duma probably will
refuse to  ratify it. Objections have been raised based on America's presumed 
intention to build a missile defense, but the real reason for the  Russian
intransigence lies elsewhere: The Russian military  establishment wants to keep
large, land-based multiple-warhead  missiles, such as the SS-18, SS-19, and
especially the mobile SS-24.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The weakest part of Clinton's arms control record concerns  the ABM Treaty.
Russia today claims to be the heir to the  now-defunct Soviet Union, and is
demanding that the U.S. abide by  the 1972 ABM treaty. The Administration not
only wants to abide  by the treaty, it wants to expand its scope. U.S.
negotiators  reportedly have accepted a Russian demand to limit the performance
of  the most promising U.S. short-range missile defenses. And  President Clinton
vetoed the FY 1996 defense authorization bill because  of its missile defense
provisions.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Clinton Administration's record in conventional arms  control with the
Russians has not been much better. The  Conventional Forces in Europe (CFE)
treaty places limits on the numbers of  conventional weapons, such as tanks and
cannon, permitted in the  European theaters of operation. It was signed with the
U.S.S.R.  in 1990, and the U.S. agreed in 1995 to allow Russia to exceed  the
limits imposed by the CFE on weapons stationed on its  northern and southern
flanks. Russia's neighbors in the Baltic region or  the Caucasus are now more
insecure as the number of weapons  and tanks on the Russian border continue to
grow. This is  especially worrisome because of all the rhetoric in Moscow about 
restoring the Soviet Union. Moreover, Russia is far behind in meeting  the 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 41 -->  weapons system destruction
targets stipulated by the CFE.

<P><B>WHAT TO DO IN 1997</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>To promote democracy and U.S. interests in Russia, the  U.S. should:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><CITE>-</CITE>     Develop a Russian policy based on support for ideas
and  interests, not individual politicians.</B>  The U.S. should support
democracy  and free markets in Russia, as well as political forces advocating 
these ideas, not controversial individual politicians like Boris  Yeltsin.
Yeltsin is the elected president of Russia and was a key figure  in bringing
about the collapse of Soviet communism. Today,  however, today some of his
policies and his personal style are  extremely controversial, and his popularity
is plummeting.  Moreover, there are other reform-oriented politicians in Russia 
with whom a dialogue should be maintained. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><CITE>-</CITE>     Advocate broad-based cooperation with Russia and
other  NIS members to ensure their integration into global markets and  the
democratic community of nations.</B> The U.S. should continue  selective and
targeted technical assistance programs and provide  support to pro-democracy
forces and nascent market institutions in  the NIS. The U.S. must design and
implement trade, investment,  and assistance programs for Russia and the NIS
that reduce  inflation, lower market barriers, and stimulate growth. Thriving
Russian  and Eurasian markets would create jobs and export opportunities  for
American businesses. U.S. assistance programs should be  taken away from AID and
given to an independent board  of policymakers, area specialists, and business
representatives.  Such a board can be appointed jointly by the President and
Congress.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 42 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><CITE>-</CITE>     Condemn Russia's interference in the affairs of its
neighbors.  The survival, sovereignty, and territorial integrity of all NIS 
countries are important to future peace and prosperity in Eurasia.</B> The  U.S.
should support the independence of Ukraine, Azerbaijan,  Georgia, and the
Central Asian states, many of which are being drawn  unwillingly back into the
Russian orbit. Washington should  intensify its ties with Ukraine, the Baltic
States, and countries in  the Caucasus and Central Asia. The West should assist
them in  developing foreign and domestic policy decisionmaking bodies  and
mechanisms, training their bureaucracies, and increasing  security cooperation.
Technical assistance in privatization of industry  and agriculture also should
be provided.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><CITE>-</CITE>     Condemn Russia's brutality in Chechnya.</B> The U.S.
should  make clear to Moscow that the use of force against other states or 
areas of the former Soviet Union could trigger U.S. retaliation  against Russian
economic and political interests. While the U.S.  should support the territorial
integrity of the Russian Federation, the  West should oppose the brutal methods
of the Russian military in  handling internal dissent, such as those used in
Chechnya. The  Clinton Administration should stop issuing declarations of
support  for Russia's actions in Chechnya and instead support OSCE efforts  to
resolve the Chechen crisis peacefully. The OSCE should  undertake a high-profile
mission to Chechnya and Russia. If Russia is to  integrate into the world
community, it must abide by its rules of  conduct, including international law
and custom. Washington  should clarify to Russia that aggressive military action
against her  neighbors could result in international isolation and possible 
economic sanctions. 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 43 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><CITE>-</CITE>     Not allow Moscow to veto the opening of NATO to new 
members.</B> The U.S. should maintain a constant dialogue with Russia  on NATO
expansion, pointing out possibilities for  Russian-NATO cooperation and
stressing that NATO is not a threat to  Russian security. While NATO enlargement
will occur, Russian  participation in the Partnership for Peace program should
be expanded  simultaneously as appropriate to assuage Russian concerns. But 
under no circumstances should Moscow be allowed to prevent  sovereign countries
in East and Central Europe from joining the  NATO alliance.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><CITE>-</CITE>     Oppose Russia's policies of nuclear proliferation.</B>
The U.S.  should take every step to prevent Iran, Iraq, and other rogue states 
from gaining nuclear and chemical weapons capabilities. For  example, voluntary
export controls similar to those developed by the  Coordination Committee on
Multilateral Export Controls  (COCOM) regime during the Cold War could be
imposed on technology  sales to these countries. Pressure should be applied
against the arming  of rogue states, up to and including the imposition of
selective  economic sanctions. At the same time, Russia should be  encouraged to
pursue other less threatening commercial ventures, such as  commercial space
launches. These could bring about a voluntary  cancellation of the reactor deal.
The U.S. also should cooperate  with pro-Western circles in Turkey and
Azerbaijan to promote  democracy and oppose radical Islam in Eurasia. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Assist Russia and other NIS countries in fighting organized  crime
and corruption. The U.S. could do this by helping the  Russians devise
comprehensive criminal and criminal procedure  codes.</B> Some of the leftover
Soviet laws in Russia make it difficult to  fight organized crime; for example,
there is no adequate law against  a 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 44 -->  conspiracy to commit a crime. In
addition, U.S. law  enforcement agencies should cooperate with trustworthy and
reliable law  enforcement personnel in the East. In particular, they can assist 
in developing a witness relocation program. They should strive  to track and
penetrate Russian and NIS criminal rings dealing  in weapons of mass destruction
and narcotics. Finally, American  law enforcement agencies should monitor
East-West financial  transactions more closely. Deposits that originate in the
NIS should  be carefully screened and the legitimacy of earnings established.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><CITE>-</CITE>     Reject Russian demands for broadening the ABM
Treaty.</B> The  U.S. needs to be defended against missile launches by rogue
states  and terrorists and against accidental launches. The Clinton 
Administration and the Russians are attempting to extend the life of the  ABM
Treaty by designating Russia and other states as successors to  the Soviet Union
under the treaty and broadening its scope to  cover theater missile defense
systems. Ballistic missile defense is a  vital goal for the U.S. These moves by
Clinton and the Russians  therefore should be resisted firmly. The ABM Treaty
needs to be  eliminated, not extended or broadened.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><A NAME="Q&AR">Q &amp; A</A></B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Why should we provide aid to Russia?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> The window of opportunity for the West in Russia may be  closing.
While there is still time, we should provide aid that  strengthens free markets
and free minds. Communism worked to  destroy both of these for 70 years. Many
Russians still want to learn  about democracy and capitalism, and we should
provide them with  a fighting chance before it is too late. However, we must
ensure  that 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 45 -->  the aid is used wisely. Aid to
Russia needs to be customized  for Russian conditions. If a hard-line government
were to take over  in Russia, making U.S. aid meaningless or worse, we probably 
would have to cut off all aid.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. What do we do if hard-liners take Yeltsin's place?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> We should act now to strengthen relations with all countries  in
the region, which will be threatened even more than the West  if hard-liners
come to power in Moscow. We should expand  NATO to include Poland, the Czech
Republic, Hungary, and  perhaps Slovakia, and should prevent any U.S. or
international  assistance to Moscow if an aggressive, anti-American, or
anti-Western  government emerges. Even under these severe circumstances, 
however, the U.S. should maintain a dialogue with Moscow,  clarifying what price
Russia may pay if &quot;red lines&quot; are crossed. Eventually,  if the need
arises, we may need to plan for military  contingencies and even to contain
Russia if it becomes aggressive. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Doesn't NATO expansion endanger Russia?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P></P>
<P><B>A.</B> No. NATO enlargement is aimed at creating a zone of  stability
and security in Eastern and Central Europe. Opening NATO  to new members 
something which has happened repeatedly in  the past  will hasten the
integration of the Czech Republic,  Poland, Hungary, and other new members into
the West. NATO is a  defensive alliance, and its posture in Central Europe
should remain  defensive.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 46 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Why shouldn't we be more cooperative with Russia?  After  all, the
Cold War is over. Russia is a democracy and a great  power. Why shouldn't we
allow Moscow a greater role in policing  unstable regions, such as the Caucasus
or Central Asia?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> We can cooperate with reformers in Russia who are  interested in
building a market economy and democracy. It will take  time, however, to assess
whether democracy has taken root in  Russia. Russia will always have a
considerable role in the region  because of its sheer size and economic,
political, and cultural weight,  but there are forces in Russia that dream of
re-establishing the  Soviet Union or the Russian Empire. These anti-Western and 
anti-American forces desire to expand Russia's power and influence to  compete
with the West, not cooperate with it. We should  oppose Russia's heavy-handed
interference in the affairs of its  neighbors and attempts to violate their
sovereignty and territorial integrity. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. In view of Chechnya, what should the U.S. do to prevent  Russia from
invading its neighbors?  
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> We should enhance our relations with Ukraine, the  Baltic States,
and countries in the Caucasus and Central Asia. There  are as many people in
these countries as there are in Russia.  We should draw &quot;lines in the sand&quot;
and stick to them. For example,  we should warn Moscow that we will block all
IMF and World  Bank assistance if an NIS country is invaded, and that the U.S.
will  lead the international diplomatic campaign to restore the  independence of
a violated country. If Russia crosses these lines, we should  consider imposing
both restrictions on exchanges and economic  and 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 47 -->  trade sanctions against Russia.
We also should demand from  Moscow that the war in Chechnya stop. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Are democracy and reform the causes of crime in Russia?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> There is widespread crime and corruption in Russia, and  some
Russians mistakenly think that the cause of crime is  free-market capitalism.
Crime is rampant, of course, but because there is  no rule of law in Russia.
Moreover, real democracy barely exists,  and the country still has a long way to
go before a free-market  system is fully established. Free markets mean the rule
of law, not the  rule of crime.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Is Russian organized crime a threat to U.S. and Western  security?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Yes, because Russian criminals are very sophisticated, 
well-educated, and well-connected worldwide. They often boast  advanced college
degrees, as well as KGB and special forces  training. There is great potential
danger in the merger of former  communist, KGB, and criminal elements in Russia
and the NIS,  and the threat from the possible access of organized criminals to 
weapons of mass destruction is particularly acute.

<P><B><A NAME="ISSUESP">THE ISSUES</A></B>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Persian Gulf is the strategic storehouse of roughly 55  percent of the
world's oil reserves. The U.S. cannot allow hostile  powers such as Iran or Iraq
to gain hegemony over Persian Gulf oil  supplies. This would allow them to gain
an economic stranglehold  on oil-importing states and could fuel a military
buildup that  includes weapons of mass destruction. The issue is how best to
contain  Iran and Iraq. Congressional Republicans, led by Senator  Alfonse
D'Amato (R-NY) and Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich  (R-GA), have pushed for a
hard-line policy of aggressive  containment of Iran and the stiffening of
economic sanctions against it, but  the Administration has dragged its feet. On
Iraq, the  Administration came to office prepared to improve relations with
Baghdad if  Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein behaved himself, but Saddam's 
repeated provocations have convinced the Administration that the U.S.  must
contain Iraq vigilantly and firmly. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Arab-Israeli conflict, one of the many cleavages that  threaten the
stability of the region, has been muted substantially but  still poses a threat
to the security of Israel and moderate  pro-Western Arab regimes. A renewal of
this conflict also could help fan  the flames of Islamic radicalism and lead to
an upsurge in  international terrorism. The issue is how to help advance 
Arab-Israeli peace negotiations. The Clinton Administration has pushed for  a
peace treaty between Israel and Syria. It has offered to  deploy American
peacekeeping forces on the Golan Heights, following  an Israeli military
withdrawal from that strategic border area,  to monitor compliance with a
possible Syrian-Israeli peace treaty.  A growing chorus of conservatives
questions the wisdom of an  open-ended U.S. peacekeeping commitment on the Golan
Heights  which could divert U.S. military forces from other missions, erode 
military readiness, and serve as a lightning rod for terrorist attacks  by 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 49 -->  Middle Eastern terrorist groups
opposed to peace.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>A third issue is how to help contain the rising tide of Islamic  radicalism
that threatens to sweep away the Algerian military  regime and undermine
pro-Western regimes in Egypt, Jordan,  Morocco, Pakistan, Tunisia, and Turkey.
Islamic radicals also threaten  U.S. interests by promoting international
terrorism and opposing  the Arab-Israeli peace process. The Clinton
Administration has  established diplomatic contacts with Islamic radicals and
has called  for a political dialogue between them and the states they seek to 
overthrow. Many conservatives oppose such contact because it  undermines secular
Middle Eastern regimes that the radicals seek  to overthrow, makes it easier for
Islamic radicals to seize power,  and would not change their anti-Western
policies if they did come  to power. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><A NAME="FACTSP">THE FACTS</A></B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein remains a dangerous, albeit 
weakened, threat to regional stability. The Iraqi army remains the  strongest
regional military force in the Persian Gulf region, and  Iraq continues its
efforts to build weapons of mass destruction, such  as chemical, biological, and
nuclear weapons. Saddam Hussein  will remain a threat to Western interests in
the Persian Gulf as long  as he remains in power.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     Iran looms large as the principal long-term threat to U.S. 
interests in the Persian Gulf. It has launched a massive military buildup  and
continues to support terrorism against its neighbors and  Western countries,
including the U.S. It also has sought to intimidate  the Arab emirates across
the Persian Gulf by rattling its saber. In  1992 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 50 -->  Iran seized three disputed
islands at the mouth of the Persian  Gulf and fortified them with 8,000 troops,
chemical weapons,  anti-aircraft missiles, and anti-ship missiles.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     Iran, like Iraq, has launched a clandestine program to build 
nuclear weapons under cover of its civilian nuclear power program.  Russia,
China, and Pakistan have provided technology, equipment,  or training that could
help advance Iran's nuclear weapons  program. Western companies, including many
from Germany, have  sold Iran dual-use (civilian/military) technologies that
could aid  its nuclear weapons program. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>    The Arab-Israeli peace negotiations achieved the October  1994
Jordan-Israeli peace treaty, but Syrian-Israeli negotiations  have been
deadlocked by Syrian intransigence. The  Palestinian-Israeli negotiations have
lurched along through two interim  self-rule agreements that have led to an
unstable, uneasy peace  continually undermined by persistent terrorism from
Palestinian Islamic  radicals. The most difficult issues  borders, Palestinian 
statehood, security arrangements, Jerusalem, the Israeli settlements, 
Palestinian refugees, and water resources  have been relegated to  the final
status talks, set to begin in May 1996.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     Islamic radicals form a tiny majority of the world's more than
 900 million Muslims. They pose a threat primarily to secular  regimes in the
Muslim world, which they have not had a great deal of  success in overthrowing.
But when they seize control of a state,  as they did in Iran in 1979 or Sudan in
1989, their power to  threaten U.S. interests greatly increases.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     The U.S. has suffered repeated terrorist attacks from Islamic 
radi
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 51 -->  cals, including the 1979-1981
hostage crisis, the 1983 bombing  of the Marine Barracks in Beirut, the 1983
bombing of the U.S.  embassy in Lebanon, the kidnappings of 15 Americans in 
Lebanon between 1985 and 1991, the 1993 World Trade Center bombing  in New York
City, and numerous other incidents.

<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     Algerian Islamic militants have waged a bloody civil war that

</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><A NAME="RECORDP">THE RECORD</A></B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Clinton Administration has done a mediocre job of  consolidating the
benefits of the Bush Administration's Desert Storm  victory and protecting
Western interests in the Persian Gulf against  Iranian and Iraqi aggression. It
has done marginally better at assisting  in Arab-Israeli peace negotiations but
also has offered to  commit American peacekeeping forces to a risky open-ended 
deployment on the Golan Heights if Israel signs a peace treaty with Syria.  The
Administration has fared worst of all in its policy toward  Islamic radicals.
For example, the Clinton Administration's May  1993 &quot;Dual Containment&quot;
policy, which calls for the simultaneous  containment and isolation of Iraq and
Iran, takes a passive approach  to containing these two countries unless prodded
by Iraqi  provocations or concerned members of the U.S. Congress. Another 
example: Clinton in June 1993 ordered an attack by  Tomahawk cruise missiles
against the Baghdad headquarters of Iraq's  secret police in retaliation for the
failed April 1993 Iraqi-sponsored  assassination attempt against former
President George Bush in  Kuwait. But this was a mere slap on the wrist in view
of the  grave nature of the terrorist attack against a former American head  of

<!-- Generation of PM publication page 52 -->  state.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Clinton Administration has dragged its feet on  increasing pressure on
Iran to halt its support of terrorism. Clinton on  April 30, 1995, announced the
signing of an executive order banning  all U.S. trade with Iran, but he did so
in part to prevent the U.S.  Congress from going farther and placing an import
ban on any  foreign company that continued to trade to Iran. The Administration 
feared this would create tensions with U.S. allies in Europe and Japan. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Congress has tried to strengthen America's policy toward  Iran. Led by
Senator D'Amato, the Senate passed a bill on December  21 that would punish
foreign companies that invest in Iran's oil  industry. The House is likely to
pass this measure. House  Speaker Gingrich also forced the Administration to
toughen its policy  on Iran by insisting that the intelligence authorization
bill include  $18 million to support covert actions against the Iranian 
government by Iranian opposition groups. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>If the Clinton Administration's policies toward Iraq and Iran  have been
unsuccessful, its role in the Arab-Israeli peace  negotiations has been
overrated. President Clinton hosted  Israeli-Palestinian signing ceremonies at
the White House in September 1993  and September 1995, but the interim
Palestinian self-rule  agreements signed at those two ceremonies came about
through bilateral  Israeli-Palestinian negotiations, not through U.S. diplomatic
 efforts. In October 1993, the Administration pledged to provide $500  million
in foreign aid to the Palestinians over five years. In 1994  Congress passed the
Middle East Peace Facilitation Act requiring  the State Department to certify
each year that the Palestine  Liberation Organization had complied with its
commitments under the  treaty 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 53 -->  before this aid could be
disbursed. Representative  Benjamin Gilman (R-NY), Chairman of the House
International  Relations Committee, has denounced the State Department

<P>Yielding to pressure from Congress, the President signed into  law a bill
requiring that the U.S. move its embassy in Israel from  Tel Aviv to Jerusalem,
Israel's capital, by May 31, 1999. The  legislation contains a provision that
permits the President to delay  the embassy move if he considers it harmful to
U.S. national  security interests. The Clinton Administration had opposed the
bill,  arguing that it would upset the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations, which 
include conflicting claims to Jerusalem, but the embassy would  be located in
Western Jerusalem, which is not claimed by the PLO.

<P>To facilitate the negotiation of a Syrian-Israeli peace treaty,  the Clinton
Administration has offered to dispatch a U.S.  peacekeeping force to the Golan
Heights, strategic territory along the  Syrian-Israeli border which Israel
captured in the 1967 Six Day War  and which Syria demands be returned to its

<P>The Clinton Administration has been much more active than  previous
administrations in establishing diplomatic contacts with  Islamic radicals, such
as the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) in  Algeria. This is dangerous because it
undermines confidence in  secular governments battling Islamic movements,
thereby helping  these movements come to power. The Clinton Administration has 
called for a political dialogue between the FIS and the Algerian  military
regime. It believes that the FIS can halt terrorism and enter  a power-sharing
arrangement with secular Algerian parties,  despite the fact that the FIS is
unable to control the more radical  Armed 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 54 -->  Islamic Group which perpetrates
much of the terrorism in  the country and increasingly is eclipsing the FIS.

</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>To protect U.S. interests in the Middle East and Persian Gulf, 
the U.S. should:
</P>
<P><B>*     Maintain a strong military presence in the Persian Gulf to  deter
Iran and Iraq from aggression and safeguard the free flow of  oil from the gulf
region.</B> Both countries have staged military  maneuvers in recent years to
intimidate their smaller neighbors. The  U.S. needs to maintain strong air and
naval forces in the region, as  well as pre-positioned military supplies that
can be deployed rapidly  by air transport to equip ground troops in a crisis.
Kuwait and  Qatar have agreed to provide facilities for pre-positioned military 
equipment, but the Saudi government has refused American requests  for a similar
arrangement in Saudi Arabia because it fears that  Islamic militants will
denounce such an arrangement as an American  base. Given such local political
sensitivities, the U.S. must seek to  limit the number of military personnel
stationed on the ground in  Saudi Arabia while depending on naval and air units
deployed in the  region to deter aggression from Iraq and Iran and relying on
rapid  air and sea transport to bring ground troops to the region in a crisis. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Maintain U.N.-sponsored economic sanctions on Iraq as long  as
Saddam Hussein remains in power, if necessary by vetoing  any move in the
Security Council to lift the sanctions.
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Tighten economic sanctions against Iran and press the  European
allies and Japan to stop lending money to Iran or renegotiating  its foreign
debt.</B> Iran is having increasing difficulty in financing  its 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 55 -->  roughly $30 billion foreign debt.
The stagnant Iranian  economy has been plagued by government mismanagement and
by  continued low prices for oil, its principal export. The U.S. ban on  trade
with Iran has cut into Iran's export earnings but has had  limited impact
because Japan and Western European states continue  their policy of &quot;constructive
engagement&quot; with Iran, which amounts  to business as usual. Washington
should press its allies to join  the embargo on trade with Iran and halt their
efforts to help Iran  reschedule its debt until the regime ends its support of
terrorism  and Islamic revolution. Washington should make a point of 
publicizing Iranian involvement in terrorism and subversion to  embarrass
Western leaders that turn a blind eye to Iranian aggression. If  the allies
continue to neglect the Iranian threat, the U.S. should  impose trade sanctions
on Western companies that continue to do  business with Iran. Banning such
companies from selling their goods in  the United States would force them to
choose between the  American market and the smaller Iranian market.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Pressure Russia, China, and Pakistan to halt their support of 
Iran's nuclear power program, which is being used as cover for  Iran's
clandestine nuclear weapons program.</B> These countries have  signed agreements
to provide nuclear technology, equipment, or  training to Iran. The U.S. should
increase pressure on all three countries  to break off their nuclear cooperation
with Tehran or risk U.S.  economic sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Take a cautious, go-slow approach to the Arab-Israeli peace 
negotiations.</B> Washington should demand that the PLO comply with  its past
commitments, especially to fight terrorism and revoke  provisions in the
Palestinian Covenant, the PLO's charter, that call  for the destruction of
Israel. The U.S. should not pressure Israel  to 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 56 -->  make any concessions in the final
status talks, which begin in  May 1996, but should allow the two sides to work
out their  differences on their own.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Withdraw the offer to deploy U.S. peacekeeping forces on  the
Golan Heights. If peacekeeping forces are needed to monitor  a Syrian-Israeli
peace treaty, they can be drawn from other  nations, as is the present United
Nations peacekeeping force on the  Golan Heights.</B> American forces should not
be used because they will  be a lightning rod for terrorist attacks by groups
based in  nearby Lebanon, such as the militant pro-Iranian Hezbollah. If the 
forces deployed are too small, they will not significantly reduce the  military
risks that Israel would run in returning the heights to Syria;  if they are
large enough to deter Syrian aggression, they will  divert other U.S. military
units from more important missions and  erode U.S. military readiness by
interfering with combat training  schedules. For a Golan peacekeeping force to
be credible would  require the commitment of a heavy brigade of roughly 5,000
troops.  To maintain a long-term deployment would require the  commitment of
three brigades: one for deployment, one for retraining for  combat missions
after deployment, and one for training and  preparing to deploy. This represents
roughly 10 percent of the U.S.  Army's active duty combat strength, a
prohibitively high burden for  an open-ended peacekeeping commitment.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Break off diplomatic contacts with the FIS and other radical 
Islamic groups.</B> Such contacts undermine the embattled secular  regimes
challenged by these radical groups. The U.S. also  should halt efforts to
pressure the embattled Algerian military regime  into a suicidal power-sharing
arrangement with Islamic radicals.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 57 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Encourage free-market economic reforms, including the  development
of a European Union - North African free trade area, to  fuel economic growth in
North Africa and the Middle East.</B>  Economic reforms will create jobs for the
unemployed youth who serve  as the vanguard of Islamic revolutionary movements.
The U.S.  also should encourage the development of secular political parties 
that can give voice to political opposition and preclude Islamic  radicals from
monopolizing the opposition to established regimes.
</P>
<P>In addition, Congress should: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Strengthen congressional oversight over the $100 million in 
annual U.S. aid to the Palestinians.</B> Congress should judge for  itself
whether the PLO has lived up to its peace commitments,  including its pledge to
end terrorism. Congress should withhold all U.S.  aid if the PLO fails to
comply.

<P><B>Q. Why should the U.S. seek to maintain U.N. economic  sanctions on Iraq
when the Iraqi people, not the regime, appear to be  doing all the suffering?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> The U.N. specifically exempted food and medicine from  its
embargo and gave Iraq the opportunity to export $1.6 billion  worth of oil to
pay for its imports if it did so under U.N.  supervision. Saddam Hussein
rejected this as an infringement of Iraqi  sovereignty and prefers to use the
suffering of his own people to  manipulate international public opinion. The
U.S. cannot afford to  lift the sanctions because Saddam has not complied with
U.N.  resolutions requiring that he provide a full accounting of his  military
buildup, recognize of the border with Kuwait, return Kuwaiti  hos
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 58 -->  tages and assets, and halt
terrorism against his own people.  Moreover, Saddam remains a threat to the
region. If Iraq is allowed  to resume its oil exports, both Saddam's hold on
power and his  ability to threaten his neighbors will be strengthened.

<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. What should be the U.S. role in the Arab-Israeli peace  negotiations?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Paradoxically, the U.S. should minimize its role as much  as
possible to encourage the Israelis and Arabs to negotiate with  each other, not
with Washington. Some of the biggest breakthroughs  in the peace negotiations,
such as Egyptian President Anwar  Sadat's 1977 visit to Jerusalem and the 1993
Oslo Accords, came  about without any direct U.S. involvement. Washington should
let  the two sides work out their problems by themselves to the  greatest extent
possible, suggesting ways to break diplomatic  impasses only when both sides
request that it do so. A lasting  Arab-Israeli peace must be negotiated
painstakingly by the parties to the  conflict and should not be imposed by
outside powers. Secretary  of State Warren Christopher, who has traveled to the
Middle East  17 times, should adjust his priorities and spend more time 
addressing more important issues, such as U.S. policy toward Russia  and China,
which he has visited less frequently.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Why should the U.S. reject a peacekeeping presence on  the Golan
Heights when it has maintained a similar  peacekeeping force in the Sinai
peninsula since 1982 to monitor compliance  with the Egyptian-Israeli peace
treaty?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> U.S. forces would face a very different political, military,  and

<!-- Generation of PM publication page 59 -->  terrorist threat environment in
the Golan Heights.  Peacekeepers would be deployed close to large armored
forces, in a  constricted area, and in positions that would become important
military  objectives if fighting erupts. Moreover, Golan peacekeepers could  be
subject to terrorist attacks from nearby Lebanon or from  terrorists hiding
among Syrian civilians. Finally, unlike Sadat's  Egypt, Hafez al-Assad's Syria
is one of the world's leading exporters  of terrorism. Syria supported
Hezbollah's terrorist attacks  against American peacekeeping forces in Lebanon
in 1983-1984 and  may be tempted to do so again in the Golan Heights to drive 
peacekeepers away. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. By firmly opposing Islamic radicalism, can the U.S. be  accused of
being anti-Muslim?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Not at all. Muslims are the chief victims of Islamic  radicals,
who are totalitarian ideologues willing to use violence,  terrorism, and
intimidation to impose their narrow religious and  political views on their
countrymen. The U.S. has cooperated closely  with fundamentalist states such as
Saudi Arabia and President Zia  al-Haq's Pakistan. The U.S. is opposed to
terrorism and the export  of violent revolution, not to the religious beliefs of
any group.

<P><B><A NAME="ISSUESL">THE ISSUES
</A></B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>America has two vital national interests in Latin America:  countering such
ongoing threats to U.S. national security as illegal  drug trafficking and Fidel
Castro's Cuba and encouraging the  development of prosperous and stable
capitalist democracies  throughout 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 60 -->  the Western Hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Latin America's economies are among the fastest growing in  the world, and
the United States has been one of the principal  beneficiaries of this growth.
U.S. exports to Latin America more  than doubled between 1988 and 1994, rising
to $94 billion, and  now support over 2 million American jobs. Moreover,
democratic  reforms are advancing at a quicker pace in Latin America than 
anywhere else in the world. Today, Cuba is the only  undemocratic country in the
Western Hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Trade expansion drives U.S. relations with Latin America,  and NAFTA (the
North American Free Trade Agreement) will be  the main instrument for achieving
America's principal foreign  policy goals for the region. These goals consist of
expanding U.S.  exports and investment as quickly as possible and assuring
long-term  economic and political stability on America's southern flank, 
particularly in Mexico and the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In 1989, the Bush Administration unveiled the Enterprise of  the Americas
Initiative, a bold proposal to create a single  free-trade area encompassing the
entire Western Hemisphere. The  following year, in 1990, the U.S. and Mexico
agreed to negotiate  NAFTA, the first comprehensive free-trade agreement ever
signed by  the U.S. with any Latin American country. NAFTA was signed  into law
by President Clinton on December 8, 1993. One year later,  at the Summit of the
Americas in Miami, President Clinton and  33 other hemispheric heads of state
agreed unanimously to create  a Free Trade Area of the Americas by 2005.
President Clinton  also pledged at the summit to expand NAFTA to Chile in 1996,
but  that presidential promise has not yet been fulfilled.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 61 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The most immediate threat to stability and security on  America's southern
flank is the crisis in Mexico. The peso's collapse on  December 19, 1994,
plunged Mexico into the worst economic  and political crisis it has suffered in
more than a century. The  peso crisis also weakened support for NAFTA in the
U.S. and may  have derailed further U.S.-led trade expansion in the Western 
Hemisphere for a period of two or three years. The Clinton  Administration is
aiding Mexico with a $50 billion emergency bailout  package, and the government
of President Ernesto Zedillo has  stepped up the pace of economic and political
reform, but the turmoil  will not subside quickly. It remains to be seen whether
the  Clinton Administration's bailout and the Zedillo government's  emergency
economic reforms will be enough to end the current crisis; if  not, Mexico will
be forced to implement even tougher reforms in  1996 and 1997. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Other threats to stability and security in Latin America  include
corruption, the widespread absence of the rule of law,  inadequate protection of
property rights, drug trafficking, organized  crime, and guerrilla activities in
several countries. These are  structural problems for which there are no easy or
quick solutions.  However, without sustained economic development, prospects for
 confronting these threats successfully are poor. The expansion of  NAFTA to
include Chile and other Latin American countries is the  vehicle proposed by the
U.S., and embraced by the emerging  capitalist democracies of Latin America, to
achieve sustained economic  development and create a 21st century hemispheric
partnership  based on free trade and democracy. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>One of the most important Latin American issues is whether  to 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 62 -->  include Chile in NAFTA. Some
American protectionists  oppose NAFTA's expansion, arguing that NAFTA caused the
 Mexican crisis and that free trade is bad for the United States. Others 
believe that expanding NAFTA is the only way to expand the  economies of the
U.S. and Latin America. Thus, they advocate  extending fast-track negotiating
authority to the President. Fast-track  negotiating authority authorizes the
President to conduct trade  negotiations with a view to achieving specific goals
established  by Congress. Agreements negotiated under fast-track are submitted 
to Congress for an up-or-down vote, but Congress may not amend  or otherwise
alter the proposed agreement submitted for its approval. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Another issue is whether the U.S. should be bailing out  Mexico's economy.
In 1995, the Clinton Administration bailed out  Mexico with a rescue package
totaling nearly $50 billion. About half  of this amount has been borrowed by the
Mexican government so  far, yet the economic crisis has not ended. Critics of
the  Administration argue that it is both unwise and wasteful to  subsidize
Mexico's economic inefficiencies.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>A third important Latin American issue is whether the U.S.  should impose
sanctions on Colombia for not doing enough to curb  the drug cartels operating
in that country. President Ernesto  Samper financed his 1994 election campaign
with more than $6 million  in political contributions from the Cali cartel. In
1995, the  Clinton Administration renewed Colombia's annual certification with 
a &quot;national interest waiver,&quot; which is analogous to flunking a  final
exam but receiving a passing grade anyway. The Republican  majority in Congress
criticized Colombia's national interest  certification in 1995 and urged Clinton
instead to decertify Colombia  and impose trade sanctions. The Administration in
March 1996  decerti
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 63 -->  fied Colombia as a sign of U.S.
opposition to the penetration  of Colombia's presidency, Congress, and court
system by  corrupt drug traffickers.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><A NAME="FACTSL">THE FACTS</A></B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     U.S. exports to Latin America and the Caribbean have more 
than doubled in just six years, rising from $46.4 billion in 1988 to  over $98
billion in 1994. These exports support nearly 2 million  American jobs. Total
U.S. exports to Latin America represent 19  percent of all U.S. exports, making
Latin America the fourth-largest  U.S. export market. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     Since 1990, U.S. exports to all countries in the Western 
Hemisphere, including Canada, have increased over 50 percent,  from $137 billion
to nearly $207 billion. In all, these exports  support over 4.1 million American
jobs. Total U.S. exports to all  countries in the Western Hemisphere in 1994
represented over 40 percent  of America's exports worldwide. The Western
Hemisphere  is America's second-largest export market, after Asia.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     Negotiations for NAFTA were substantially concluded in 1992 
by the Bush Administration. The final agreement was approved  in 1993 by the
U.S. Congress, but only after the Clinton  Administration forced Mexico and
Canada to accept unnecessary side  agreements on labor and the environment.
NAFTA is to be  implemented over a period of 15 years, with full implementation
scheduled  for 2009. Chile is next in line for membership.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     Trade growth during NAFTA's first two years surpassed even 
the most optimistic forecasts. In 1994, two-way trade between the  U.S. 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 64 -->  and Mexico increased over 22
percent, to more than $100  billion. The U.S. reported a trade deficit of nearly
$16 billion with  Mexico during 1995, mainly because Mexican exports had
increased  by more than one-third since 1994. However, despite the peso  crisis,
U.S. exports to Mexico in 1995 fell by less than 9 percent from  the year
before, and were still higher than in 1993.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     The South American Common Market (Mercosur), which is led  by
Brazil and also includes Argentina, Paraguay, and Uruguay, is  rapidly
developing a free-trade area in South America while  seeking closer trade
relations with the European Union and several of  the APEC countries, including
Japan. If NAFTA is not  expanded quickly to include Chile, and subsequently
Argentina, the  U.S. may be sidelined from South American trade liberalization 
centered on Mercosur at the expense of American exports, jobs,  and U.S.
leadership in that region of the Americas.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     Drug cartels in Colombia and Mexico have become a  significant
threat to U.S. economic and security interests. Colombian  drug traffickers
financed the election of President Ernesto Samper  in 1994 and have penetrated
Columbia's Congress, courts, and  law enforcement institutions. Moreover, over
80 percent of the  cocaine imported illegally into the U.S. is transported
through Mexico  by powerful drug cartels in league with corrupt politicians, law
 enforcement, and military personnel. Belatedly, the Clinton  Administration
appears to have acknowledged that drug traffickers are  a national security
threat to America by appointing former  Army General Barry McCaffrey as the new
head of the White  House Office of National Drug Control Policy.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><A NAME="RECORDL">THE RECORD</A>
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 65 --> 
</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The high watermarks of the Clinton Administration's  foreign policy toward
Latin America were the approval of NAFTA  in 1993 and the Summit of the Americas
in 1994. It was at this  conference that the President pledged to expand NAFTA
to  include Chile in 1996 and promised to create a Free Trade Area of  the
Americas by 2005. Both achievements were eclipsed by the  collapse of the
Mexican peso in 1995, and the crisis in Mexico  has derailed further U.S.-led
trade expansion in Latin America for  one or two years at least. The Clinton
Administration is  pretending otherwise, but without NAFTA's expansion to Chile,
the  President has nothing to offer Latin America, and the U.S. is  temporarily
sidelined from the process of hemispheric trade liberalization.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In other words, with NAFTA's expansion pushed off  the Administration's
agenda, at least for now, President Clinton  has little to show for his efforts
in Latin America except a string  of foreign policy blunders. These include:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>*     The U.S. military occupation of Haiti.</B> President
Clinton  ordered the invasion of Haiti to establish a lasting democracy in that 
country. In truth, however, the Clinton Administration restored  Haitian
President Jean-Bertrand Aristide to power and then  provided Aristide with over
$2 billion in military security and financial  aid as he consolidated his
one-man rule. New Haitian President  Rene Preval is Aristide's closest friend,
chosen by Aristide to  succeed him in power. Moreover, political violence has
continued in  Haiti since the start of the U.S. military occupation. Since
Aristide  was restored to power, more than 20 leaders of the political 
opposition have been murdered. Now that the U.S. has left Haiti, there  are
fears of renewed political violence.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 66 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     The Mexican peso crisis.</B> The Clinton Administration had  more
than a year's advance warning, during 1993 and 1994, of  Mexico's impending
financial collapse but did nothing to prevent it.  When the crisis hit,
President Clinton rushed to the  Mexican government's rescue with a $50 billion
bailout package that  assured Americans holding Mexican government bonds of full
 repayment at the expense of American taxpayers. However,  the Mexican economy
suffered a brutal contraction that will be felt  for many years by the Mexican
people, and the expansion of  NAFTA to Chile and other Latin American countries
was derailed.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Dealing secretly with Castro.</B> The White House secretly 
negotiated an agreement with Castro that requires U.S. Navy and Coast  Guard
ships to intercept Cuban refugees fleeing the island and  return them forcibly
to Cuba. However, Clinton obtained no economic  or political concessions from
Castro, except a promise not to  permit any new mass departures of Cubans
seeking freedom.

<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>*     Renew fast-track negotiating authority.</B> Without
fast-track,  the Administration cannot negotiate new trade agreements with 
Chile or any other countries. Fast-track is an essential tool for  American
trade negotiators.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Allow no more bailouts for Mexico or any other country.</B> 
Clinton's bailout of Mexico is a case of throwing good money after bad.  The
crisis in Mexico is not over. As soon as 1997, another peso  crisis 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 67 -->  could force the Zedillo
government to request more financial  aid from the U.S., and possibly also to
call for a new round of  debt negotiations to prevent a default. The U.S. should
refuse all  future Mexican requests for emergency financial bailouts and should 
urge Mexico instead to resolve its economic difficulties with  market-oriented
solutions.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Expand NAFTA to include Chile.</B> Including Chile in  NAFTA would
send the rest of Latin America and the Caribbean a  strong message that U.S.
commitment to creating a Free Trade Area  of the Americas (FTAA) remains firm.
It also would  enhance America's leadership in the Western Hemisphere while 
expanding export and investment opportunities for U.S. companies in  South
America, creating a South American gateway to Asian markets  for U.S. producers,
and strengthening the relative bargaining power  of U.S. trade negotiators in
future talks between NAFTA and  the South American Common Market (Mercosur)
headed by  Brazil and Argentina.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Give Caribbean and Central American countries  NAFTA-level trade
parity.</B> Raising the countries of the Caribbean Basin  Initiative to NAFTA
parity with Mexico would not cost the U.S.  anything. To the contrary, it would
increase market access for U.S.  companies and investors in the Caribbean and
Central America  and would compel countries in the region to accept NAFTA 
standards in other areas beneficial to American commercial interests.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*      Negotiate a framework free-trade agreement between NAFTA  and
Mercosur, the South American Common Market.</B>  A  free-trade agreement between
NAFTA and Mercosur is an essential step  in creating a Free Trade Area of the
Americas. At present, Brazil  is 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 68 -->  pursuing a policy of
consolidating Mercosur first in order to  create a South American Free Trade
Area (SAFTA), centered on  Brazil, that would exclude NAFTA initially. This
would have  adverse long-term consequences for U.S. exports and investments in 
South America. The U.S. should try to counter this Brazilian strategy  by
expanding NAFTA to include Chile, and subsequently  Argentina, in order to push
Mercosur toward a convergence with NAFTA.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Suspend all U.S. government aid to Haiti.</B> The Clinton 
Administration has withdrawn the American military presence from Haiti,  but it
plans to continue funding the Aristide-sponsored government  of President Rene
Preval with hundreds of millions of dollars in  financial aid disbursed through
the U.S. Agency for  International Development (USAID) and multilateral
institutions like the  IMF, World Bank, and Inter-American Development Bank. 
However, lasting democracy has not been established, and American  taxpayers
should not be dunned for the cost of maintaining the illusion  of democracy in
the least democratic country in the Americas  (after communist Cuba).
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Continue pressure against Fidel Castro's dictatorship in Cuba.</B>
 The Clinton Administration has agreed to return to Cuba all  refugees
intercepted at sea, but Castro has made no economic or  political concessions.
Castro wants the U.S. trade embargo lifted, but  he refuses to relax his
totalitarian enslavement of the Cuban  people. Until Castro agrees to make real
free-market and democratic  concessions aimed at freeing the Cuban people, the
U.S. should  continue to turn the economic screws against Castro, as it did 
recently by approving the Helms-Burton Bill that tightens sanctions  against
Cuba.

</P>
<P><B>A.</B> NAFTA did not cause the Mexican peso crisis. The peso  collapsed
because the Mexican economy is not free and  because Mexico is not a
full-fledged democracy. NAFTA prevented  the Mexican crisis from becoming much
worse, because it  provided Mexico with a strong institutional anchor that
encouraged the  government to stay on course with the economic and political 
reforms that, over the next decade, will foster the consolidation of a  true
capitalist democracy in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Is NAFTA responsible for growing illegal immigration  and drug
trafficking from Mexico?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Mexicans emigrate to the U.S., legally and illegally,  because
they are fleeing poverty and repression. Mexicans have been  migrating to
America for over 100 years and will continue to do so  as long as they are
denied opportunities for economic advancement  in their own country. NAFTA
compels the Mexican government  to open up the Mexican economy; over the next
10-15 years,  therefore, more economic freedom in Mexico will be reflected in 
reduced immigration to the U.S. Similarly, NAFTA is not  responsible for drug
trafficking in North America. The real cause is  the lack of economic and
political freedom in Mexico, combined  with incoherent U.S. anti-drug policies.

</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Wouldn't America be better off without NAFTA?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B>Without NAFTA, relations between the U.S. and Mexico  would 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 70 -->  deteriorate. NAFTA is the first
successful effort, in nearly  200 years of frequently difficult U.S.-Mexico
relations, to build a  lasting partnership based on economic prosperity and
democratic  stability. Abolishing NAFTA would not end common security  concerns
related to economic relations, immigration, and drug  trafficking. However, with
NAFTA in place, the U.S. has an  effective foreign policy instrument with which
to create a durable  cross-border relationship for the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Was the military occupation of Haiti a mistake?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B>Yes. President Clinton's commitment of U.S. troops to  Haiti was
driven by domestic policy concerns. Haiti has no  democratic tradition, and
history teaches that democracy cannot be  imposed forcibly by external power.
The creation of a true democracy  in Haiti is important to all democracies in
the Americas, but the  drive to become a democracy must come from within.

<P><B><A NAME="ISSUES">THE ISSUES</A></B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Throughout most of its history, America sought to avoid  entanglement in the
affairs of other countries, focusing instead on  peaceful avenues of trade.
America has grown into an industrial giant  partly because of international
trade, which now accounts for some  23 percent of the national wealth. With
increased reliance on  global markets, the U.S. is trying to expand its exports
by involving  itself in agreements such as the North American Free Trade 
Agreement (NAFTA).
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>While America has been largely a free-trade nation, the  principles of free
trade today are under siege. On the one side of the  argument are those who
advocate free trade because it creates  jobs, promotes economic growth, and
maximizes efficiency and  individual wealth. On the other are those who argue
that free  trade forces American manufacturing overseas, and leads to lost 
jobs, declining wealth, and increased national suffering.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>To its proponents, free trade is a matter of principle.  Individuals should
enjoy the right to buy lawful products, wherever  made, without governmental
interference. Free traders believe that  governments should not dictate to
individuals what clothes they  will wear, what food they will eat, and which
cars they will drive  to 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 2 -->  benefit domestic producers.
Tariffs, import quotas,  discriminatory regulations, and other forms of
protectionism are unwarranted  infringements of individual freedom.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Proponents also believe that free trade promotes economic  growth and
creates jobs for Americans. Virtually all economists argue  that free trade
increases competition, spurs innovation, lowers  prices, accelerates economic
growth, and on balance creates more  jobs than are lost to foreign competition.

</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Opponents of free trade advocate closed borders and argue  that cutting off
or restricting trade with other nations is in  America's interest. While they
admit that tariffs and import quotas raise  consumer prices, they believe such
measures also safeguard jobs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Perhaps no other recent public figure has advocated trade  protectionism
more vigorously than Patrick Buchanan, who says  he would impose stiff tariffs
on imports and withdraw America  from almost all of its international
agreements, including the  North American Free Trade Area with Mexico and Canada
and  the World Trade Organization (WTO), a global trade organization.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The outcome of this debate is vitally important to America's  future. The
choice before the U.S. is whether to continue or  abandon its standard of living
and its position as the world's  leading economy. A false move on the trade
front could have  disastrous consequences for the U.S. economy. It should be
recalled that  the protectionism of the 1930s was a major factor in bringing 
about the Great Depression. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The challenge for America is whether it will embrace free trade  as 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 3 -->  a key to its continuing
prosperity. Linked to this challenge are  such issues as expanding NAFTA to
include Chile and other  countries, expanding free trade in Asia through the
Asia Pacific  Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum, expanding trade across the 
Atlantic with Europe, and dealing with the entry of the People's  Republic of
China (PRC) and Republic of China on Taiwan (ROC) into  the World Trade
Organization. Generally, free traders have been  disappointed in President
Clinton's handling of all these trade  issues. They accuse him of dragging his
feet on expanding NAFTA  to include Chile and of trying to force &quot;managed&quot;
trade deals  with the Japanese over auto parts.

<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>*</B>     America is the largest exporter of goods and
services in the  world. It exports over $700 billion in goods and services each
year,  and over 14 million Americans are employed producing these exports.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     One out of every five American workers owes his or her job  to
international trade.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     America's trade deficit is minuscule when compared to the size
 of the U.S. economy. The U.S. trade deficit in goods and services is  a mere
1.5 percent of America's overall economy (gross  national product). America's
annual budget deficit  2.5 percent of GNP   is almost twice the size of its
trade deficit.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     The U.S. trades with Asia more than any other region in the 
world. U.S. two-way merchandise trade with Asia in 1994 was  $424.9 billion, or
36.1 percent of total U.S. two-way merchandise  trade worldwide. Merchandise
exports to Asia support 3.1  million 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 4 -->  American jobs<B>.</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     <B></B>The U.S. exports over $120 billion in goods to Europe,
not  including the newly independent states of the former Soviet  Union. These
exports support over 2 million U.S. jobs. Removing  barriers to U.S. exports to
Europe means creating more American jobs in  a number of different sectors,
including agricultural goods,  automobiles, electric power and natural gas
equipment, information  technology products, medical devices, pharmaceuticals,
and  telecommunications equipment.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     Japan is America's second-largest foreign market, importing 
more goods and services from America than any other country  except Canada. In
1994, Japan imported some $70 billion worth of  goods and services from the
U.S., supporting some 1.4 million  American jobs.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     Japan is a big customer for the U.S. manufacturing  industry.<B>
</B>Over 60 percent of U.S. exports to Japan are manufactured goods,  and
Japan's purchases of these goods support over 840,000  American manufacturing
jobs.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     The U.S. exports nearly $98 billion in goods to Latin  America
each year. These merchandise exports represent 19 percent of  all U.S.
merchandise exports and support 1.96 million U.S. jobs.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     Since NAFTA went into effect on January 1, 1994, U.S. 
merchandise exports to Mexico and Canada have soared. During  NAFTA's first year
in 1994, U.S. merchandise exports to Canada,  America's largest trading partner,
grew by more than 13 percent to $114  billion. Likewise, U.S. merchandise
exports to Mexico grew over  22 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 5 -->  percent to $51 billion.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><A NAME="RECORD">THE RECORD</A></B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Since the Reagan and Bush Administrations, the expansion of  free trade has
been the cornerstone of U.S. policy toward  Latin America and the Caribbean. The
Enterprise for the Americas  Initiative launched by former President George Bush
in 1989 laid  out the goal of creating an American-led free-trade area 
encompassing the entire Western Hemisphere, from Alaska in North America  to
Tierra del Fuego in South America. The first step in creating  a Free Trade Area
of the Americas (FTAA) was taken by the  Bush Administration in 1990 with the
announcement that the U.S.  would negotiate a free-trade agreement with Mexico.
The North  American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) was approved by the  U.S.
Congress in 1993 and implemented as of January 1, 1994.  Subsequently, at the
Summit of the Americas held in Miami,  Florida, from December 9-11, 1994,
President Clinton and all of the  democratically elected leaders of Latin
America, the Caribbean,  and Canada pledged unanimously to create an FTAA by the
year  2005; President Clinton also pledged that Chile would become  NAFTA's
fourth member by 1996, thus confirming to the region's  leaders that the U.S.
was firmly committed to hemispheric trade  expansion.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In April 1994, the United States signed the Uruguay Round  trade agreement,
which went into force on January 1, 1995. The  Reagan Administration initiated
these trade negotiations in 1986 as part  of an ongoing series of talks under
the General Agreement on  Tariffs and Trade (GATT). This was the seventh &quot;round&quot;
of GATT  trade talks that started in 1947. Prior to World War II, many 
countries 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 6 -->  established barriers to
international trade which contributed to  the Great Depression in the U.S. and
Europe. Following the war,  many of these barriers remained in place. The first
GATT round  was held in Geneva, Switzerland, in 1947 and resulted in some 
45,000 separate agreements that reduced tariffs on manufactured  goods and some
agricultural goods. Since GATT's inception, world  trade has expanded from less
than $100 billion in the late 1940s to  over $3 trillion today. Among other
things, the Uruguay Round  agreement creates a new body called the World Trade 
Organization (WTO). This organization is a forum in which countries can  seek
peaceful solutions to trade disputes without resorting to trade  protectionism.
Thus, instead of occasional international trade  negotiations like the seven
rounds GATT talks, the WTO allows for  ongoing negotiations.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The forum for Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)  is America's
institutional link to fast-growing Asian  economies. Formed in 1989, APEC
encompasses Australia, Brunei,  Canada, Chile, China, Hong Kong, Indonesia,
Japan, Malaysia,  Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, 
Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, and the United States. The  leaders of
APEC's member economies, including President Bill  Clinton, in 1994 set as their
goal achieving &quot;free trade and investment  in the Asia Pacific&quot; region
by 2010 for developed members and  by 2020 for developing members.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>However, while paying lip service to free trade, the Clinton  Administration
has pursued a policy that isolates America from  the international economy and
thus threatens Americans whose  jobs depend on international trade. For example,
NAFTA's  expansion to include Chile has stalled because the Administration and 
Con
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 7 -->  gress cannot agree on the language
of a new fast-track  negotiating authority. The Administration insists on
language that would  allow trade sanctions to be imposed against countries that
violate  labor and environmental rules contained in the side agreements  to
NAFTA. Republican leaders in Congress reject this demand,  arguing that
extraneous issues unrelated to trade should not be  confused with trade. Without
a new fast-track negotiating  authority, NAFTA cannot be expanded to Chile, and
it is unlikely that  free-trade agreements could be negotiated with any other
country.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>President Clinton snubbed other government heads and  reduced American
prestige in the region when he skipped the  November 19, 1995, Leaders' Meeting
in Osaka, Japan. The leaders will  meet in November 1996 in Subic Bay,
Philippines, and again in  November 1997 in Canada to review the each member's
progress  toward achieving APEC's free trade goal.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>President Clinton has vacillated between free trade and  managed trade in
Asia. On one hand, he agreed to create a vast APEC  free-trade area, including
China and Japan, and help China join  the World Trade Organization (WTO). On the
other, he has  tightened import quotas on Chinese apparel and textiles and has
tried  unsuccessfully to force Japan to consent to new managed trade  agreements
on autos and semiconductors. Additionally, since  Clinton became President, the
U.S. has threatened to impose trade  sanctions on such imported products as
steel, textiles, cellular  telephones, consumer electronics products, and a host
of other  manufactured goods.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>WHAT TO DO IN 1997
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 8 --> 
</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The path of trade protectionism paved by the Clinton  Administration should
be reversed. America needs to be put back on the  road to free trade. In 1997,
the U.S. should:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>-     Establish free-trade areas between the United States
and its  trading partners.</B> NAFTA should be expanded to incorporate Chile 
and other Latin American countries, and Caribbean nations should  receive
trading parity with NAFTA members. The U.S. should  cooperate with other APEC
members and take more concrete steps  at the next two Leaders' Meetings to
achieve a free-trade area in  the Asia-Pacific. The U.S. also should encourage
other Latin  American economies to join Chile and Mexico in APEC in 1997. 
Finally, the U.S. should offer a Transatlantic Free Trade Area to  interested
European countries, including the recently freed nations in  Eastern and Central
Europe.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Propose a free-trade area &quot;framework agreement&quot; with 
European countries interested in a free-trade area with the U.S.</B> A 
framework agreement precedes a free-trade agreement, allowing both sides  to
propose which items and topics they wish to pursue as part of  the formal
negotiating process. It is a necessary first step toward  formal negotiations to
create a free-trade agreement with  European countries.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>A free trade area with Europe would make it easier for U.S.  companies to
sell their goods there.<B> </B>Most European countries still  have their own
peculiarities regarding product standards, testing,  labeling, and
certification. These differences often increase the cost  of U.S. products as
companies must alter their products to meet  these differing requirements. A
free-trade area with Europe would  allow the U.S. and Europe to seek common
product standards,  testing, 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 9 -->  labeling, and certification
requirements, thereby reducing the  costs of doing business.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>A free-trade area with Europe also would increase America's  access to
Europe's agricultural market. Even though the U.S.  and Europe reached an
agreement in 1994 to reduce some  agricultural subsidies as part of the General
Agreement on Tariffs and  Trade (GATT), Europe still maintains a host of
subsidies, trade  quotas, and import bans that restrict or prevent U.S.
agricultural exports  to Europe. Likewise, the U.S. still maintains agricultural
 subsidies, import quotas, and other restrictions that restrict agricultural 
imports from Europe. A free-trade agreement would allow U.S.  and European
negotiators to reduce barriers and promote  agricultural exports on both sides,
benefiting all parites.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-    Support the accession of both the People's Republic of China  and
the Republic of China on Taiwan to the World Trade  Organization on a
commercially viable basis.</B> In 1986, Beijing applied to  resume China's seat
in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade,  the predecessor of the WTO,
which the Republic of China on  Taiwan had abandoned in 1950. In 1990, Taiwan
also applied to join  the GATT. Following Hong Kong's example, Taiwan elected to
 apply as the autonomous customs territory of &quot;Chinese Taipei,&quot; 
rather than as a sovereign country. This move was intended to  finesse Beijing's
sensitivities over questions of sovereignty. Beijing  insists that Taiwan not
join the WTO before the PRC, but has offered  as its first act as a WTO member
to sponsor Taiwan. Joining  the WTO is an economic, not political, act.
Therefore, Beijing  should not be allowed to block Taiwan's entry; each
application should  be considered on its own merits. Although negotiations with 
Taiwan have progressed further, neither China nor Taiwan has offered  suf
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 10 -->  ficient concessions to warrant
WTO membership.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Demand an end to China's practice of forcing foreign firms  to
transfer technology as a condition of investing.</B> The leverage  that China
can exert with its huge market makes it difficult even  for large industrial
firms to resist this form of  government-sponsored theft. The U.S. must also
insist that all existing bilateral  trade agreements, especially the 1995
Intellectual Property  Rights Memorandum of Understanding, be fully enforced
before  approving China's accession to the WTO. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Repeal the outdated Jackson-Vanik Amendment to the Trade  Act of
1975.</B> The Jackson-Vanik Trade Act was designed to  encourage the Soviet
Union and its Eastern European satellites to lift  restrictions on Jewish
emigration to Israel and the U.S. It  withdraws America's most-favored-nation
trading status from any  country that restricts immigration. Threatening to deny
MFN status  to China because of human rights abuses has become an annual  ritual
in Congress. But maintaining MFN with China is clearly  in America's economic
interest. At stake are billions of dollars  in trade. It also encourages the
liberalization of China's political  system. Trade forces China to open up to
the outside world and  therefore serves the long-run cause of human rights.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Approve fast track for Chile before the 1996 elections.</B> Chile 
has enjoyed the fastest economic growth and the greatest  economic stability of
any country in Latin America since the mid-1980s. It  is in the forefront of
economic and democratic reform in the  Americas, having successfully achieved
the transition from military  dictatorship to civilian democracy. Chile is a
member of the APEC;  it is a strong candidate to join Mercosur (the South
American  Com
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 11 -->  mon Market comprised of
Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay)  when Mercosur's members can reduce their
tariffs to match Chile's;  and it has a working bilateral trade agreement with
Mexico.  However, Chile cannot join NAFTA before 1997 if Congress does not 
approve fast-track negotiating authority. Under fast track,  trade agreements
negotiated by the Administration are submitted  to Congress for a straight
up-or-down vote; however, Congress  may not change or amend any portion of the
proposed agreement  before voting. Chile is the benchmark against which the rest
of the  region will measure America's hemispheric vision and leadership.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Submit more accurate trade reports.</B> The United States Trade 
Representative (USTR) produces an annual report on foreign  trade barriers. This
report is important because it identifies the  barriers that U.S. exporters face
when selling their products  overseas. However, it tells only one side of the
story. America maintains  a host of import restrictions such as trade quotas,
high tariffs,  and import bans that are not described in the report. They should
 be. By including such information, the U.S. government would  be presenting a
more open picture of the status of free trade and  of where reforms are still
needed, including within the U.S.  Moreover, such USTR reports should
incorporate a scorecard of  the current cost to the economy of each of these
U.S. restrictions  on trade.

<P><B><A NAME="Q&A">Q&amp;A</A></B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. How can you support free trade when our huge trade deficit  is
destroying jobs?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> America's trade deficit is only 1.5 percent of the size of  the 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 12 -->  overall U.S. economy. The U.S.
budget deficit is 2.5 percent  of America's GNP. Thus, while much is made of
America's  trade deficit, it is nearly half the size of the U.S. budget deficit.
The  budget deficit hinders America's economy far more than does  the trade
deficit. Free trade creates jobs: One of every five U.S. jobs  is the result of
U.S. trade. Besides, free trade provides  Americans with greater consumer
choice, adds to the national wealth, and  is responsible for the fact that
American businesses are the  largest exporters in the world.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Free trade is fine, but shouldn't America require a level  playing
field with its trading partners?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> No. Countries that maintain trade barriers harm their  own
economies for more than they harm America's. Rather  than threaten to close
America's markets to foreign countries if they  do not remove barriers to U.S.
exports, America should seek to  use free-trade areas and the newly created
international dispute  settlement forum, the World Trade Organization, to
encourage  open markets. Under the WTO, the U.S. would be able to seek the 
opening of foreign markets through negotiations rather than threats  and
destructive retaliation. Even if the U.S. could not achieve  open markets abroad
through such means, it would be better  for America and its consumers to
dismantle U.S. trade  protectionism unilaterally than to impose higher barriers
to foreign imports.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Shouldn't America tell countries like Japan that if they do  not open
up, we will close our borders to them?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> No. That would be self-defeating. Japan is America's  largest
overseas market. It imports more goods and services from the  U.S. 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 13 -->  than the United Kingdom and
Germany combined and  is America's largest overseas market for agricultural
goods. Also,  the average Japanese person buys more goods and services from  the
U.S. than the average U.S. citizen buys from Japan. Why  does America have a
trade deficit with Japan?  There are many  factors, including the stubbornness
of American companies in refusing  to design products for the Japanese market.
But the main reason  is that there are twice as many Americans as there are 
Japanese. Even the Clinton Administration agrees that if Japan removed  all
supposed trade barriers to U.S. imports, the deficit would  shrink only
marginally.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Did NAFTA cause the Mexican crisis?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> NAFTA did not cause the Mexican crisis. The peso  collapsed on
December 19, 1994, because the Mexican economy is not  sufficiently free, and
because Mexico's political system is  undemocratic. Moreover, former Mexican
President Carlos Salinas  de Gortari refused to make needed monetary and
exchange  policy adjustments in advance of Mexico's 1994 presidential 
elections. When investors lost confidence in Mexico, they fled to safer 
markets. Mexico was unable to retain the confidence of investors  because it
lacked strong economic and democratic  institutions. Thanks to NAFTA, however,
President Ernesto Zedillo is  implementing economic and political reforms that
should create the  institutions Mexico lacked in 1994.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. What is fast track, and why is it important?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Fast-track negotiating authority consists of special  legislative
rules adopted by Congress. These authorize the President to  nego
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 14 -->  tiate trade agreements and submit
them to Congress for an  up-or-down vote without the addition of any amendments
by  Congress. Fast track accelerates the process of negotiating free trade 
agreements with other countries, while providing them the  assurance that
agreements they reach with the U.S. government will not  be changed subsequently
by Congress.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Why is it important that fast track be approved before the  1996
elections?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> On four separate occasions since 1990, the U.S. has  pledged
officially that Chile would become the fourth member of  NAFTA. If Chile is not
admitted to NAFTA until 1997, America will  lose the opportunity to take the
lead in negotiating free-trade  agreements with other major economies in South
America,  including Argentina and Brazil. By 1997, Chile's interest in joining 
NAFTA may weaken, and America's chances of consolidating U.S.  leadership in
South America may be diminished. Chile cannot  join NAFTA until Congress has
granted fast-track negotiating  authority to the President. This authority is
needed to expedite negotiations.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Since NAFTA has not worked, why would a free-trade  area with Europe
work.
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> NAFTA has worked. Exports to Mexico increased by 20  percent
during the NAFTA's first year in 1994. Due to the  Mexican peso crisis, U.S.
exports to Mexico dropped slightly during  1995, but they were still higher than
the total for 1993, before  NAFTA was implemented. Moreover, the &quot;giant
sucking sound&quot;  predicted by Ross Perot never did occur. In fact, some
companies  that moved to Mexico prior to the NAFTA now are moving back to  the 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 15 -->  U.S. Why?  Because even though
Mexican workers may get  paid less, some companies are finding it harder to get
their products  out of Mexico because its roads, ports, and transportation
networks  are costly and inefficient.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. What happens if some members of the European Union want  a free-trade
area with the U.S. but others do not?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> The U.S. should extend an offer for a free-trade area directly 
to the European Union. At the same time, it should extend an offer  to
non-European Union members in Central and Eastern Europe,  and even to the newly
independent states of the former Soviet  Union. If the EU drags its feet in
negotiating with the U.S.,  America should pursue a free-trade area with such
non-EU members as  the Czech Republic and Estonia, two of Europe's most rapidly 
growing market economies.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. What U.S. industries could be expected to benefit from  freer trade
with Europe?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> A host of industries would benefit from freer trade with  Europe.
These would include those involved in agriculture,  telecommunications, and the
manufacturing of automobiles, medical  equipment, and pharmaceuticals.

</center><p>

<P>Beyond the traditional tools of statecraft  war and diplomacy   America has
many lesser tools at its disposal in formulating  and executing foreign policy.
Like all good tools, however, they  are means to an end and should be used only
under the right  circumstances and with proper care. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>One of these tools is the United Nations. The U.S. should treat  the U.N.
not as some superior body to which it must apply for  approval, but as an
institution which can be useful in cultivating  international support for U.S.
policy. Another tool is foreign aid.  Aid can be an effective adjunct to U.S.
foreign policy, but only if  it works and serves American interests, neither of
which it has  done very well. Two other tools, both of which are indispensable 
for national security, are intelligence gathering and covert  operations. Even
though the Cold War is over, the chaotic and  threatening condition of today's
world requires a robust and effective  intelligence capability. Finally, there
is the important work of  public diplomacy, as represented by the United States 
Information Agency (USIA), the Voice of America (VOA), and other  official
media. Telling the American story to people overseas helps  build international
support for democracy and freedom, as well as  for specific U.S. policies.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 2 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>America must be engaged in world affairs. The U.S. cannot  protect its vital
interests unless it seeks to influence world opinion  and events in such
international bodies as the United Nations. But  this does not mean compromising
American principles, sovereignty,  or freedom of action. Whether in the U.N. or
any other  multilateral organization, the U.S. government should strive to
protect  American interests and represent American values. America must  pursue
its own agenda, not that of international bureaucrats often  hostile to U.S
interests. Only by doing so can the United States  remain strong enough to
contribute effectively to international peace  and stability.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>How to develop this American agenda in international  diplomacy is an issue
which separates conservatives from liberals.  Liberals tend to distrust American
power and seek to constrain it by tying  it to the U.N. Conservatives, knowing
that this power historically  has been used for good, want to liberate it from
these constraints.  Liberals want to put American forces under U.N. military 
command, and to have America adopt the U.N. bureaucracy's generally  socialist
agenda as its own; some have gone so far as to propose  that the U.N. be given
taxing powers over U.S. citizens. By  contrast, conservatives want America to
retain sovereign control over  its own military forces when they are involved in
U.N.  peacekeeping operations. Above all, conservatives want to prevent the U.S.
 from becoming a mere servant of the U.N.'s agenda, as the Clinton 
Administration has allowed to happen in Somalia and elsewhere;  they are willing
to work through the U.N. when it suits American  interests, but not when these
interests are not served.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Another issue is whether, and to what extent, to support  U.S. policy abroad
through public diplomacy. Most people believe  that 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 3 -->  the U.S. needs some form of public
diplomacy to explain  American policy and values to people in foreign lands. It
is well  known that Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty and the Voice of  America
played important roles in bringing down the Iron Curtain.  What role should they
play in today's international diplomacy?   And once this role has been
established, what is the best way to  convey this message, through existing
official media structures and  outlets or through new ones?

<P>

<P>Even its strongest advocates recognize that the U.N. is  bloated, wasteful,
poorly managed, and disorganized. Only  fundamental reform can reinvigorate the
U.N. and restore its lost  credibility. The Clinton Administration itself
recognizes that unless the  U.N. is reformed, it will drift into irrelevance and
lose public support. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The U.N. claims that the U.S. is some $1.3 billion behind in  its financial
contributions. Washington says the figure should  be somewhat less. With
approximately half of its 185 member  states delinquent in their dues, the U.N.
is in serious financial crisis.  The Clinton Administration wants to pay, but
Congress wants to  withhold payment until the U.N. gets its budget under control
and  ends corruption and poor management practices. The Clinton  Administration
may propose a deal with Congress to repay America's  back fees over several
years in return for promised U.N. reforms.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Over the past few years, the U.N. has proven that it cannot  manage 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 4 -->  large, complex, and ambitious &quot;peace
operations&quot;  competently. This was seen most clearly in the debacles in
Somalia and  the former Yugoslavia. Not only have these operations been 
spectacular failures; they have been costly in terms of lives, material 
resources, and money. The U.S. spent almost $3 billion (in  direct and indirect
costs) in 1995 to support these failed U.N. operations. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Another contentious issue involves the specialized agencies.  Conservatives
believe that agencies such as the United Nations  Development Program (UNDP) and
United Nations Industrial  Development Organization (UNIDO) do not merit
American financial  support or membership. Not only are they poorly managed and 
wasteful, but their mandates are counterproductive.
</P>

<P><B><A NAME="FACTS">THE FACTS</A></B>

<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>*</B>     There is broad consensus that the U.N. needs
reforming.  Secretary of State Warren Christopher, in a September 1995 address
to  the U.N. General Assembly, proposed a &quot;concrete agenda&quot; for  U.N.
reform. This agenda involves ending programs that have  achieved their purpose,
consolidating overlapping programs,  downsizing regional economic commissions,
and imposing a moratorium  on big conferences.<A
HREF="ftnt19.htm#1">1</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     Funding for the U.N. system falls into two categories:
assessed  and voluntary contributions. An assessed contribution is the price  of
membership in the U.N. and its specialized agencies.  Countries make voluntary
contributions to specialized agencies they  also wish to support. For 1996, the
Clinton Administration  requested some $1.07 billion for U.S. assessed and
voluntary contributions  to the U.N. and its specialized agencies and
commissions.  Actual 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 5 -->  U.S. spending for these
organizations totaled $1 billion in  1994. By contrast, more than 90 other
countries together account for  less than 1 percent of the U.N. budget, paying
only .01 percent each.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     Cases of fraud and abuse erupt with disturbing regularity. In 
1995, for example, $10 million was embezzled from the United  Nations Children's
Fund (UNICEF) in Kenya. Various agencies of  the U.N. spent approximately $1
million a day at the height of the  Somalia peacekeeping operation in 1993. This
included renting  hundreds of apartments equipped with air conditioning. In 
December 1995, the U.N. scrapped a never-used $1 million turnstile  security
system at its New York headquarters. The reason: The  turnstile clocks would
have tracked the arrival and departure times of  U.N. employees. In 1995, the
U.N. spent some $500,000 for a  two-week conference on the Sustainable
Development of Small Island  Developing States, including $15,000 to fly
representatives from  the Western Sahara to Barbados.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     The U.N. has grown into a massive bureaucracy of over 70 
agencies and programs, including the United Nations Research  Institute for
Social Development (UNRISD) and the International  Labor Organization (ILO),
with overlapping mandates. The U.N.  system has over 50,000 employees. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     The United States plays a key role in supporting U.N. 
peacekeeping. Until last year, the U.S. paid nearly one-third of the  annual
$3.5 billion peacekeeping bill (now unilaterally reduced to 25  percent). The
U.S. assigns thousands of American soldiers to  U.N. missions and provides
billions of dollars worth of  transportation, equipment, and other support
services to the U.N. at no charge.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 6 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     Until recently, traditional U.N. peacekeeping operations 
entailed small observation or peacekeeping missions deployed to  monitor an
already existing peace settlement. These operations  were simple, inexpensive,
unambitious, and usually staffed by  countries like Canada, Sweden, Norway, or
Austria. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     With the end of Cold War tensions among members of the 
Security Council, there was an explosion in peacekeeping  operations from 1989
to 1993, with the Security Council authorizing  more missions than it had in the
previous 40 years. In 1990, the  U.N. controlled approximately 10,000 &quot;blue
helmets&quot; in eight  operations at a cost of less than $700 million per year.
By the end  of 1993, there were over 90,000 &quot;blue helmets&quot; in 18
different  operations costing over $3.5 billion per year.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     The U.N. has conducted 21 observation missions and six 
traditional peacekeeping missions since 1948. These missions have  a mixed
record in limiting armed conflict and promoting  conflict resolution. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     The U.N. has expanded the definition of peacekeeping 
significantly since 1990. Now peacekeeping is called &quot;second  generation
peacekeeping&quot; or &quot;peace-enforcement.&quot;  In these  operations,
peacekeepers have been sent to volatile and dangerous areas  (such as Somalia
and Bosnia) before a conclusive peace was  achieved. These missions have been
large (employing up to 40,000  troops); complex (involving armored combat
formations with combat  air and naval support); dangerous (resulting in hundreds
of  U.N. troops killed in Somalia and Bosnia); ambitious (attempting  to impose
peace through force of arms); and expensive (costing  the U.N. almost $5 million
per day in Bosnia). All have been failures. 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 7 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     As of August 1995, the U.S. had over 3,200 American troops 
deployed in support of U.N. peacekeeping operations. These  operations include
Macedonia, Western Sahara, Kuwait, and Haiti.  The U.S. also provided the great
bulk of NATO air forces to enforce  a U.N.-sponsored &quot;no-fly zone&quot;
over Bosnia-Herzegovina  from 1993 to 1995.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     Peacekeeping operations harm U.S. combat readiness. Time 
spent on peacekeeping missions is time not spent learning or  rehearsing
critical warfighting skills. A recent General Accounting  Office report noted
the deleterious effects of peacekeeping on  readiness,<A
HREF="ftnt19.htm">2</A> documenting how it can take 12 to 18
months for a unit to return  to the minimum proficiency standards required by
U.S. doctrine.  This means, for instance, that the U.S. Army in Europe, which
has  deployed most of its units to Bosnia for peace implementation  duty, will
be out of the warfighting business for two to three years.
</P>
<P>

<P><B><A NAME="RECORD">THE RECORD</A></B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Clinton Administration began with a great deal of  enthusiasm for the
United Nations. President Clinton and his team  believed that with the end of
the Cold War, the U.N. could be  reinvigorated and begin to live up to the lofty
language of its Charter,  which assumes a central role for the organization in
preserving peace  and international security. The Clinton plan was for America
to  provide considerable support for U.N. peacekeeping and other  activities,
including foreign aid.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Clinton Administration initially embraced an  interventionist U.N. Under
the doctrine of &quot;assertive multilateralism,&quot; the  U.S. would advance
its security goals by working &quot;assertively&quot; with  the U.N. rather than
unilaterally or with allies. Central to this  approach was heavy American
support of U.N. peacekeeping. U.N.  Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali went
so far as to advocate  a 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 9 -->  standing U.N. army under his
control. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>President Clinton was forced to retreat from this doctrine after  the
failure of the U.N. operation in Somalia, where the U.N.  undertook an ambitious
nation-building mandate for which it was  unprepared. In support of this
mission, President Clinton deployed U.S.  Army Rangers who were assigned to
capture a Somali warlord for  the U.N. In October 1993, American soldiers were
drawn into a  street battle in Mogadishu during which 18 Americans were killed 
and 75 wounded. In May 1994, Clinton backtracked and issued  Presidential
Decision Directive 25 (PDD 25), placing restrictions  on U.S. participation in
U.N. peacekeeping. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The highlight of the Clinton Administration's U.N. reform  effort has been
to establish an Inspector General's office in New  York. For years, Congress has
been pushing this idea. Unfortunately,  this office has only limited scope and
has been characterized as a  &quot;disappointment&quot; by Representative Lee
Hamilton (D-IN) and  Senator Nancy Kassebaum (R-KS), two Members of Congress who
 have long championed the U.N. Driven by budget constraints,  the Clinton
Administration in December 1995 announced the  long-overdue U.S. withdrawal from
the United Nations Industrial  Development Organization (UNIDO).
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The 104th Congress tried to restrict some of the more  egregious Clinton
policies toward the U.N. The House and Senate  passed separate bills in 1995
that would cut U.S. financial contributions  to U.N. peacekeeping and limit U.S.
forces deployed in U.N.  peacekeeping operations. Both bills embody provisions
of the  Contract With America. During negotiations with the Clinton 
Administration, language in the defense authorization bill that placed  limits 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 10 -->  on U.S. participation in U.N.
peacekeeping was dropped.  President Clinton claimed that these limits were a
challenge to his  authority as commander in chief and threatened to veto the
bill if it  contained any such language. Congress backed down and passed  a
defense bill without these restrictions in January 1996. The  President
subsequently signed the defense bill.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>On another front, Representative Joe Scarborough (R-FL) in  October 1995
introduced the United Nations Withdrawal Act. This  legislation would require
the U.S. to withdraw from the U.N. by  the year 2000, retaining its membership
only in the U.N.'s  independent and specialized agencies. Representative
Scarborough's  bill was referred to the International Relations Committee, where
 it remains under consideration. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Clinton Administration boasts frequently of its participation  in
U.N.-sponsored international conferences. Vice President Al  Gore went to the
Cairo Conference on Population and Development  in 1994 and accompanied Hillary
Clinton to the Copenhagen  Social Summit in 1995, and Mrs. Clinton and Health
and Human  Services Secretary Donna Shalala attended the 1995 Fourth Women's 
Conference in Beijing. These conferences have come under  heavy criticism, both
for their anti-Western agendas and for their  wastefulness.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In early 1996, Secretary General Boutros-Ghali floated the idea  of imposing
a U.N. tax on member nations. Republican  Senators Robert Dole (KS) and Jesse
Helms (NC) responded in January  by introducing legislation to bar U.S. payments
to the U.N. if it  tries to implement such a tax. The Clinton Administration
opposes  a U.N. tax.

<P><B>WHAT TO DO IN 1997</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>To promote U.S. interests in the U.N. without sacrificing 
American sovereignty or effectiveness, and to ensure that America  does not get
dragged into unworkable peacekeeping operations, the  U.S. should: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Limit its total non-peacekeeping contribution to no more  than
$500 million per year.</B> In 1995, America's assessed and  voluntary
contributions to the U.N. and its specialized agencies and  commissions totaled
some $1 billion. Approximately $260 million of  this amount went to the U.N.
administrative budget.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Stop paying assessed contributions to U.N. specialized  agencies.</B>
The few specialized agencies worthy of support, such as the  Universal Postal
Union and the World Meteorological  Organization, should be funded on a
case-by-case and voluntary basis from  the $500 million given to the U.N. This
dramatically reduced level  of spending will allow the U.S. to establish a
fundamentally  different relationship with a considerably scaled-back U.N.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Never place U.S. troops under U.N. command.</B> The U.S.  may
choose to support some traditional peacekeeping operations,  such as the one in
Cyprus. However, U.S. forces should not be  placed under U.N. command. The U.S.
can provide support for U.N.  missions without operating in the U.N. chain of
command. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Never give the Security Council veto power over American  foreign
policy.</B> It may be diplomatically useful to gain U.N.  Security Council
support for U.S. military actions, as President Bush did  in 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 12 -->  the Persian Gulf War when his
Administration won a  Security Council resolution supporting the expulsion of
Iraq from  Kuwait. However, this support should never be considered essential. 
The U.S. should never allow Security Council politics to keep it  from defending
vital American interests.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Eliminate funding for the United Nations Development  Program
(UNDP).</B> One of the bewildering array of specialized agencies  in the U.N.
system, UNDP is charged with &quot;contribut[ing] to a  sustainable expansion of
the world economy.&quot;  Essentially, it is a  foreign aid agency. Not only are
its programs unfocused and  duplicative, but foreign aid has proven
counterproductive in country  after country. Eliminating funding for this
specialized agency will  save the U.S. approximately $120 million a year.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     End funding for all U.N. international conferences.</B> These 
conferences, which cost millions of dollars, are long on rhetoric  and short on
achievement. The 1995 Social Summit, for example,  focused on &quot;Creating
Jobs&quot; and &quot;Building Solidarity,&quot; two  objectives well beyond the
capabilities of a one-time gathering of  national and international bureaucrats.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*      Reject any proposal to vest the U.N. with taxing authority.</B> 
Senators Dole and Helms have introduced legislation that would  have the U.S.
stop paying its dues if the U.N. tries to impose a tax.  The Clinton
Administration also has voiced its opposition to the idea  of such a tax. The
U.S. should continue to send a strong message  that this trial balloon, floated
by Secretary General Boutros-Ghali  in January 1996 and bound to resurface
within the U.N., is  unacceptable.

the U.N.? 
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> No. Opposition to a poorly managed and corrupt  international
bureaucracy in New York is not support for isolationism.  Conservatives support
NATO and other alliances, as well as limited  participation in the U.N. This is
not isolationist; it is international  engagement in support of American, not
U.N., interests.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Why are you so opposed to the U.N.?  What right do we have  to impose
our will without first consulting with the  international community through the
U.N.? 
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> When deciding American foreign policy, the President  should
consult with his advisors and the Congress, not the U.N. We  don't need the
permission of the U.N. to protect American freedom  and interests. The U.N. is
plagued with corruption, and many of  its activities, including its foreign aid
programs, perpetuate  dependency throughout the developing world. Moreover, the
U.N.  is merely a collection of often opposing national interests. It is 
ridiculous to suggest that the 180-plus governments in the U.N.   many of which
are dictatorships  represent the democratic will  of the world community.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. The U.N. is responsible for international peace and  security. How
can the U.S. promote international peace and security if it  is not involved in
U.N. peacekeeping? 
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Despite its lofty objectives, the U.N. contributes only  margin
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 14 -->  ally to international peace and
security. Since its creation in  1945, it has been a bit player on the world
stage. The U.S. remains  the world's principal force for international peace and
security  by maintaining forces in Europe and the Pacific region and by 
participating in alliance structures like NATO. It is highly misleading  to
measure a nation's contribution to the world's security by  gauging its
participation in marginal undertakings like U.N.  peacekeeping. America and its
Western allies ended the Cold War by being  militarily strong, not by
participating in &quot;peace&quot; missions  sponsored by the U.N. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. An American soldier, Specialist Michael New, was  court-martialed in
January 1996 for refusing to wear U.N. insignia  and serve under U.N. command.
He maintains this violates his oath  to support and defend the Constitution of
the United States. Do  you support him?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> As a soldier, Specialist New is obligated by his oath to obey 
the lawful orders of his chain of command. However unwise as a  matter of
policy, New's orders were not illegal. Therefore, he  should face the
consequences of his disobedience. However,  Specialist New should not have been
placed in a position where he  was forced to choose between his duty and his
conscience.  American soldiers should not be placed in the U.N. chain of
command.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Secretary General Boutros-Ghali has floated the idea of  establishing
a U.N. tax on international commercial airline flights,  currency exchanges, and
other international transactions. What do  you think about this?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> It is ridiculous. The power to tax is a sovereign power of  gov
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 15 -->  ernment, which is accountable to
the people in a free society.  The U.N. is accountable to no one but member
governments and  bureaucrats. The U.N. has no sovereignty over its member
states;  nor should it ever have such power. The U.N. is the creation and  the
servant of its member states. In any case, its problems stem  not from a lack of
money, but from having too much money. It is  very disturbing that Secretary
General Boutros-Ghali and others  within the U.N. are trying to make this power
grab.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. In the first session of the 104th Congress, legislation was

take the U.S. out of the U.N.?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> The Security Council can serve some useful purposes. At  times,
for example, it can be a forum for discussion of important  international
issues. However, the U.S. should never feel constrained  by Security Council
resolutions, and U.S. participation in the U.  N. should be scaled back. A major
cut in U.S. funding would go  a long way toward achieving this goal.

<P>Effective intelligence is as necessary today as during the  Cold War.
Despite the end of the Cold War, the world remains a  very dangerous and
increasingly unpredictable place. Threats  to America's interests are real and
growing. They can arise in  regions vital to the U.S. with little or no warning.
America needs a  robust 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 16 -->  intelligence gathering capacity
both to enable its leaders to  understand these threats and to give them as much
warning of  approaching danger as possible. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>However, the U.S. intelligence community today faces  serious problems and
challenges. The morale of the Central  Intelligence Agency has been severely
damaged by the Aldrich Ames spy  case. Moreover, the CIA has failed to predict
crucially important  developments, most notably the collapse of the Soviet Union
 and Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait. The intelligence  community, like the
Defense Department, has been forced to  finance much of the so-called peace
dividend through drastic reductions  in budgets and personnel. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Many issues must be resolved if the U.S. is to maintain robust  and highly
capable intelligence assets able to meet the complex  challenges of the
post-Cold War era and the 21st century. Among  the questions facing policymakers
today:

<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>*</B>     The U.S. intelligence community consists of the
Central  Intelligence Agency; the Defense Intelligence Agency; the  intelligence
units of the armed services; the National Security Agency,  which monitors and
analyzes worldwide radio-telephone and other  electronic transmissions; and the
National Reconnaissance  Office, which gathers and processes satellite imagery.
The CIA is  forbidden by law to conduct intelligence activities inside the U.S.;
 domestic intelligence and internal security are the responsibility  of the
Federal Bureau of Investigation. Overall coordination and  direction of foreign
intelligence is provided by the Director of  Central Intelligence (DCI),
although military intelligence operates  with a high degree of autonomy within
this structure. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     The DCI is appointed by the President and confirmed by the 
Senate, which means the CIA is subject to a certain degree of  political
pressure from the White House. Ideally, however, the DCI is  objective and &quot;non-political,&quot;
since intelligence findings tailored  to fit political objectives can be
useless, if not actually dangerous  and misleading.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     Most U.S. intelligence on foreign activities is derived from 
monitoring electronic emissions (radio and telephone traffic) and  from 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 18 -->  satellites orbiting high above
the Earth. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     Information gained from satellites is vital, especially in 
wartime. Satellites allow the U.S. to detect and track missile launches;  to
track the movements of foreign ground, air, and naval forces;  and to monitor
compliance with arms control treaties. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     Although America's intelligence collection from satellites 
and signals intercepts is highly effective, the U.S. intelligence  community
relies heavily on high technology and neglects  intelligence from human sources
(HUMINT). There is no substitute for  the information provided by trained or
knowledgeable human  observers. People can enter underground or covered
facilities which  satellite sensors cannot observe. Only people can penetrate 
terrorist cells or drug networks, and only human agents can provide  some
assessment of an adversary's intentions.

<P><B>*</B>     Much of the U.S. intelligence budget is classified; the 
amount spent on &quot;black&quot; (clandestine) programs is not available.

</P>
<P>The Clinton Administration has failed to resolve these  fundamental issues,
or even to undertake any serious reappraisal  of America's intelligence needs.
Nor has Clinton been able to  improve CIA morale in the wake of the Aldrich Ames
disaster.  Instead, the Administration has presided over a reduction of 
intelligence agency budgets and personnel without any clear rationale  or
understanding of the changing role of intelligence in the  post-Cold 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 19 -->  War world. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The intelligence community is being downsized at a rate of  3-5 percent per
year, with some vital components losing as much as  80 percent of their
personnel. Moreover, the Administration has  failed to recognize that the
national intelligence mission has not  diminished substantially with the end of
the Cold War; it has  become broader and more complex. While reducing its
resources, the  Administration continues to impose on the intelligence community
 a growing range of tasks, such as supporting arms control and  other
international agreements being pursued by the White House  and monitoring
developments in trouble spots like Somalia,  Rwanda, Haiti, and the Balkans
where the Administration has  committed U.S. forces to peacekeeping and
humanitarian missions.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>By demanding more of the intelligence community while  cutting its
resources, the Clinton Administration is in danger of  stretching America's
intelligence capabilities to the breaking point.  The President is jeopardizing
the intelligence community's ability  to provide strategic warning in the event
of conflict and to  furnish vital analysis to the national command authority in
time of crisis.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Another problem is that the Administration has politicized the  CIA by &quot;cooking&quot;
intelligence findings to support preconceived  positions. Perhaps the most

Administration and Congress should:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><CITE>-</CITE>     Stabilize the budget, personnel, and

the  Administration to conduct a thorough assessment of the types of

then to  base budget and manpower decisions on that assessment. So far,  this
has not been done.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><CITE>-</CITE>     Shore up the human side of espionage. </B> Because
America's  high technology is superior, the intelligence community has 
developed a strong technocratic bias. It often neglects the human side of 
intelligence gathering. Technical intelligence is valuable, but it has  its
limits. Only people can get inside an underground weapons  storage facility or,
more important, get inside the thinking of a  potential aggressor or penetrate a
terrorist cell. Improving human  intelligence will require institutional change
that assures career  advancement for officers who are aggressive in recruiting
and  &quot;running&quot; informants and operatives and that allows agency
officers to  use commonsense criteria in recruiting foreign operatives and 
informants. Common sense suggests that foreign informants  sometimes will be
unsavory characters. As long as these informants do  not harm Americans, the
U.S. should not assume responsibility for  all their actions merely because they
are informants or working  on contract.

<P>
</P>
<P><B><CITE>-</CITE>     Generate more innovation and creativity in the

 science. The problem with U.S. intelligence is not lack of data,  but lack of
imagination and creativity in concluding what the data  are 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 21 -->  saying, in discerning the
patterns and trends suggested by the  data. The CIA needs to reward agents in
the field for innovative  collection methods. It also needs to reward analysts
for foresight,  insight, and good judgment in drawing proper conclusions from
the  information collected. The DCI must not merely manage the  Agency but lead
it. That means ending the mindset of risk-averse,  bureaucratic caution that
dominates the CIA. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Strengthen the CIA's counter-intelligence  capabilities</B>. There must
be no more Ames-like penetrations of the CIA. This will  require an internal or
institutional change in thinking which  accepts the possibility that U.S.
intelligence agencies are targets for  foreign penetration and that,
regrettably, some Americans like  Ames can be recruited to betray their country.
Better congressional  oversight which demands accountability by CIA managers,
and  support by the DCI and the Agency for a vigorous  counter-intelligence
effort inside the Agency, are also necessary for improving 
counter-intelligence.

<P><B>Q. Why do we need spies now that the Cold War is over?
</B><!-- Generation of PM publication page 22 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> America and its allies still face a variety of threats and  new
challenges to vital interests even though the Cold War is over.  The radical
downsizing of U.S. military forces makes it more  crucial than ever that America
have the best possible intelligence, both  to provide early warning of crisis to
the commander in chief and  to provide policy options for dealing with the
complex new  challenges of the post-Cold War world.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. With the end of the Soviet military threat, wouldn't U.S. 
intelligence assets be put to better use gathering information  on America's
competition in technology and trade?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> The U.S. government needs to stay out of corporate  espionage.
Some argue that the U.S., while no longer engaged in a  military confrontation
with the Soviet Union, should see itself as  engaged in an economic war with
rest of the world. Such claims are  alarmist at least, and deceptive at best. If
American corporations want  to engage in the normal and legal gathering of
business  information, that is their choice. But diverting U.S. government 
intelligence agencies to spy for U.S. business risks discrediting  the
government's legitimate function. Recent allegations that the  CIA spied for the
United State Trade Representative's office  during automotive negotiations with
Japan are a case in point. Instead  of spying for American corporations, which
are private entities  not deserving of official support, intelligence agencies
should  be monitoring the sales of Russian nuclear weapons and the  movements of
Iranian submarines operating in the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Why does the CIA use criminals and murderers as agents  in Latin
America and other Third World countries, even  including some allegedly guilty
of killing American citizens?
</B><!-- Generation of PM publication page 23 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Informants are not the same as field officers, or what  are
loosely termed &quot;agents.&quot;  No one would hold a New York  policeman
responsible for the actions of a drug dealer turned  informant, especially if
the offending actions have nothing to do with the  undercover operation. The
same is true regarding CIA  informants. However, under no circumstances should
the CIA protect an  informant or contract employee who harms a fellow American. 
When such cases come to light, the Agency should terminate the  relationship at
once and report the criminal to the proper authorities,  even if it means losing
a valuable source of information.

<P>America's foreign aid program is coming under increasing  scrutiny, not only
by the American public, but also in Congress.  Although the $12 billion a year
spent on foreign aid represents a  relatively small part of the federal budget,
more and more  skeptics argue that this program is a waste of taxpayers' money.
There  is little evidence to support the contentions of proponents that  foreign
aid is vital to America's national interest. There is even  less evidence that
this money actually helps alleviate poverty in  less-developed countries.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Why, then, has foreign aid proved to be one of the hardest  programs to cut
or eliminate?  The main reason is the way the  program is structured. The
foreign aid program has three major  elements. 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 24 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>First</B> is military and security assistance to promote
America's  national security abroad. Consisting of such undertakings as 
anti-narcotics efforts, joint military training exercises between U.S.  and
foreign forces, and grants to foreign countries to purchase  U.S. military
equipment, this program accounts for about 25 percent  of the overall foreign
aid budget. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Second</B> is humanitarian and disaster relief assistance to aid 
victims of natural disaster and prevent mass starvation. This program  accounts
for some 15 percent of the foreign aid budget.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Third</B> is economic and development assistance to promote  economic
growth in less developed countries. This program  consumes about 60 percent of
the foreign aid budget. 
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P>The debate over foreign aid often has centered on funding  levels for these
three major components. During the Cold War, the  U.S. funneled significant
amounts of military and security aid, as  well as economic and development
assistance, to its allies in the  fight against communism. Now that the Soviet
Union has  collapsed, however, critics of the program wonder why America needs 
to spend $12 billion a year around the globe. The Clinton  Administration argues
that the program is still needed to support  America's interests abroad.
Skeptics, many of whom questioned the merits  of the economic aid program even
during the Cold War, argue that  it makes even less sense today.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Many proposals have surfaced, from abolishing the Agency  for International
Development (AID), the agency in charge of  distributing America's foreign aid
dollars, to moving remaining  funding 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 25 -->  and programs into existing
departments like State and  Defense. Another &quot;reform&quot; proposal would
increase the budget to face  the new challenges of the post-Cold War era and
re-focus the  program on what is called &quot;sustainable economic development&quot;
of  poorer countries. This is the argument made by the Clinton  Administration.

foreign aid.  However, this amount does not include such other commitments as

<P>There is bipartisan consensus that foreign aid needs to be  reformed. The
Clinton Administration's own study on  reinventing government argues that AID
does not have a single, clearly  defined and articulated strategic mission.
Shortly after this study  was issued, Secretary of State Warren Christopher
announced his  proposal for an enhanced Department of International Relations 
in which AID and other agencies would be abolished and their  functions assumed
by the State Department.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The State Department authorization bill would have moved  USIA, the Arms
Control and Disarmament Agency (ACDA), and  AID into the State Department. The
bill was derailed by  opposition from the Clinton Administration and Senate
Democrats, led  by Senator John Kerry (D-MA). The House of Representatives 
approved these consolidations in June 1995, and Senator Kerry  and Senate
Foreign Relations Committee chairman Jesse Helms  (R-
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 27 -->  NC) agreed to a plan to cut the
operating expenses of these  agencies. Consolidation proponents believe that
these cuts will  force the Clinton Administration to move these three agencies
into  the State Department. A House-Senate conference report awaits  approval by
the Senate and the President, who has threatened to  veto the bill.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The 1996 appropriations bill for foreign aid has been passed  by both houses
of Congress and signed by the President. This  measure cuts foreign aid spending
from $14.3 billion in FY 1995 to  $12.1 billion in FY 1996. The 1996
appropriations bill also includes  language requiring AID to submit to Congress
a detailed report  outlining the relative levels of economic freedom of foreign
aid  recipients. This report will make it more difficult for AID to  continue to
give money to countries with economically unfree or  repressed economies.

<P><B>WHAT TO DO IN 1997</B>

<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>*     Phase out corporate welfare.</B> America's corporate
welfare  system, which includes the Export-Import Bank and the Overseas  Private
Investment Corporation, diverts money from the pockets of  the American taxpayer
to preferred big businesses. Coddling of  private business by the U.S.
government with tax dollars is not  needed. America already is the largest
exporter in the world, and most  of its exporting companies are doing very well
indeed without  corporate welfare. These funds would be spent far better if left
in  the 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 28 -->  wallets of the American taxpayer.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Abolish the Agency for International Development, along  with most
of its functions, and move any remaining functions to  the State Department.</B>
AID is the main reason America continues  to waste so much money on foreign aid.
If Congress cannot pass  authorizing legislation that eliminates AID, it should
refuse to  appropriate any money for the agency's operating expenses until  such
legislation is signed into law. Moreover, international  development assistance
does not work. Countries receiving economic aid  for over 35 years are no better
off today than they were before.  Thus, not only should AID be abolished, but so
should the entire  development assistance program.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Require the President to certify to Congress that any security 
and military aid sent abroad is necessary to support U.S. national  security
interests.</B> The foreign aid account is more than just  development
assistance; it also includes funds for military and  security assistance. It is
widely claimed that this money directly  supports the national interest abroad
by enhancing U.S. influence in  international affairs. However, many of
America's foreign aid  recipients routinely vote against the U.S. in the United
Nations; the  voting records of the U.N. show that three out of every four
recipients  of U.S. foreign aid vote against America more than half the time. 
<B> </B>If Congress is asked to appropriate foreign aid for the purpose  of
promoting the national interest, it should get more than a  promise from the
White House that it will get the job done.  Congress should require the
President to certify that U.S. foreign aid  supports American interests abroad.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Phase out funding for the World Bank, the International  Monetary 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 29 -->  Fund, and the other multilateral
development banks.</B> These  multilateral development banks (MDBs) have been no
more  successful at promoting economic growth in less developed countries  than
has AID. In fact, a strong case can be made that they have had  less success
than AID. Since the 1950s, the World Bank and the  IMF have disbursed over $350
billion to less developed countries.  Most of these countries are no better off
today than they were  before receiving their money. In fact, many are worse off.
The  U.S. should phase out financial support to these institutions.

<P><A NAME="Q&AF"><B>Q &amp; A</B>
</A></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. How can you call for cutting aid to the poor at a time  when more
people are living in poverty around the globe than ever  before?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Because most economic aid perpetuates poverty. The only  way poor
countries can break out of the poverty trap is to stop  depending on foreign
aid. In this day and age, poverty is not the  natural condition of mankind; it
is a condition imposed by corrupt  governments which repress their economies.
Foreign aid does not  help countries develop. Most long-term recipients are no
better off  today then they were 30 years ago. If poor countries do not  adopt
economically free policies, they will remain poor, no matter  how much money we
throw at them.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. You say foreign aid does not work. How come the  Marshall Plan, the
largest foreign aid program, is considered successful?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> The Marshall Plan was not development aid. It was a plan  to
rebuild already developed countries. But underdeveloped  countries 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 30 -->  are not rebuilding an established
infrastructure; they are trying  to acquire one. They also do not have the
established  free-market economic foundations that post-war Europe had. Thus, 
while money spent in post-war Europe helped rebuild roads and  bridges, foreign
aid in the less developed world has done little good  because no amount of
foreign aid could provide the degree of  modernization and industrialization
which existed in Europe  before World War II.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. The Agency for International Development has been  extremely
successful in improving child mortality rates, providing  vaccinations, and
helping to feed those in immediate need of food.  How can you support cutting
funding for programs which help to  keep people alive?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Because Americans, as private citizens, are doing a better  job
than government in helping people. Americans spend some  $12 billion a year on
private overseas charities. AID spends less  than $100 million on disaster
relief and related programs. If  America has helped children and the poor in
less developed countries, it  is mainly because of the work of these private
charities.  Private charities are far more effective than AID, which is a 
bureaucracy that spends some 70 cents of every foreign aid dollar  within
America's borders. It is far better to give to private charities  than to waste
taxpayer dollars on American professors who, on  AID contracts, do nothing more
than write studies of foreign aid.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Isn't foreign aid necessary at least for countries trying to  develop
free markets?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> No, but it can be useful if properly conceived, managed,  and 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 31 -->  targeted. Private foreign
investors spend some $18 billion a  year investing abroad. Those private
investments are much larger  than the $12 billion government dispenses each year
in foreign aid.  Foreign investment, not foreign aid, is necessary for  economic
growth. To attract foreign investment, governments must cut  taxes, privatize
business, eliminate regulations, and institute other  similar reforms. In most
cases, foreign governments do not need aid  to implement these reforms (the
obvious exceptions being  former Eastern Bloc nations, which can use it
constructively for  education and training to encourage the creation of market
institutions). 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> <B>Q.Won't cutting foreign aid result in more Somalias and Haitis?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> No. Both Haiti and Somalia are long-term recipients of  foreign
aid. Somalia has been hooked on U.S. foreign aid for 40  years, receiving over
$750 million since 1955. Yet Somalia is  poorer today than it was in 1965. Haiti
has received almost $1 billion  in foreign aid over 51 years, and it also is
poorer today than it was  in 1965. If economic aid is so necessary to create
economic  development in poor countries, why has it not worked in these two 
countries?
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Doesn't the U.S. foreign aid program at least help  American
businesses?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Yes, it helps some businesses, contractors, and consultants.  But
this should not be the purpose of foreign aid. Choosing  winners and losers in
the market is not the proper business of  government. Rewarding special
interests with federal dollars will not help  poor countries abroad.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 32 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. You may call it corporate welfare, but shouldn't Washington  be doing
all it can to help American businesses export?  After  all, exports mean jobs
for Americans. 
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> The U.S. is the largest exporter in the world and would  remain
so without government subsidies, which help only a few  of America's businesses.
Many now-subsidized trade deals would  be made without this government
financing. Yes, some  businesses seem to &quot;win&quot; from government
subsidies, but the losers are  the American taxpayers who pay for these
programs. This  money should be left in the hands of the people who earned it
rather  than given to those who happen to have powerful friends in  Washington.

<P>Public diplomacy is the means by which the U.S.  government communicates
directly to the peoples of foreign countries.  Essentially, it involves the
information and cultural activities of  the United States government. Public
diplomacy enables the U.S.  government to present its perspective to people in
other countries  and to provide accurate information about the U.S. to those who
 otherwise would never receive it, preferably in a manner other  cultures will
find credible. These efforts take place outside of the  standard channels of
diplomacy  specifically, outside the State  Department, which conducts formal
diplomatic relations with other  nations. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In this age of information, mass communication is rapid,  virtually 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 33 -->  global, and accessible with
unprecedented ease to a larger  number of people than ever before. Information
can affect mass  sentiment and public opinion in foreign nations, and therefore
the policy  decisions of foreign governments. In certain situations, ideas  and
imagery can have greater impact than bombs and bullets.  Thus, public diplomacy,
particularly the direct dissemination of  policy decisions and the rationale for
making them, remains an  important tool of foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>A prime example of the impact of public diplomacy is the fall  of the Soviet
Union. The Soviets could not compete in the  modern world without opening up
their captive empire to new forms  of information and communication technology.
Once that  happened, they no longer could isolate their people from Western
ideals  of democracy, free markets, and individual liberty. It was the 
communication and popularization of these ideals which eroded  the legitimacy of
Communism and, as much as Western  military strength, eventually brought the
Soviet structure crashing down.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Some liberals criticize public diplomacy as a form of  propaganda. They see
it as a camouflage for activities that are improper for  the U.S. government.
This position flows from the Left's  reflexive &quot;blame America&quot;
attitude. Those who hold this view  evidently believe that America's
institutions are deeply flawed, and  that America's founding principles are
irrelevant to nations  struggling to find their way in the chaotic post-Cold War
era.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Some conservatives are critical of public diplomacy as well.  They believe
that America should concentrate on solving internal  domestic problems like
out-of-control deficits and excessive  federal spending. These skeptics believe
that reaching foreign publics  with 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 34 -->  American ideals should be
subordinated to other, more  pressing needs.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>While most Members of Congress support official U.S.  broadcasting, there is
no consensus in Congress or in the Administration  on how much the U.S. should
spend on public diplomacy. Nor is  there unanimity on how the official
components of public  diplomacy, such as the United States Information Agency,
should be  organized.

communist Cuba. VOA broadcasts  world news as well as statements of official
U.S. government  policy. RFE/RL reports on events and activities inside the
former  communist countries, thus serving as a surrogate news service for  local

independent, non-local government source of news and  information.

<P>Public diplomacy agencies and media have undergone  significant
reorganization since the Cold War ended. The Board for  International
Broadcasting was abolished at the end of 1995 by  presidential decision, and
funding for Radio Free Europe/Radio  Liberty, formerly handled by the Board,
will be disseminated  directly through the United States Information Agency
(USIA), an  independent executive branch agency. This emphasizes USIA's role  as
America's primary arm of public diplomacy. However, even  while public diplomacy
is being consolidated under USIA, its budget  has been severely curtailed. The
USIA budget in FY 1993 was  $965 million. The budget for FY 1995 was $520
million.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Neither Congress nor the Administration has provided  adequate support for
U.S. international broadcasting. For example,  the Voice of America (VOA), the
U.S. government's primary  broadcasting medium, has been severely slashed by
congressional  &quot;deficit hawks,&quot; resulting in the loss of 400 uniquely
skilled  professionals and the ability to broadcast in 20 foreign languages.
These  cuts in FY 1996 come on top of others mandated in the FY 1994 
International Broadcasting Act, which cut 900 staff employees at  Radio Free
Europe/Radio Liberty and 350 at the VOA.

listeners is falling sharply. Therefore, there must be a stronger  investment in
AM/FM radio and television broadcasting, but  short-wave investments may be
reduced to more appropriate levels.  At the same time, the U.S. government must
maintain a &quot;surge  capacity&quot; to reach foreign audiences directly. It

</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Much of the American popular entertainment that reaches  the
world  rock music and Hollywood films, for example     conveys a jaundiced view
of America, giving some countries one more  excuse to condemn the United States.
And CNN, while virtually  a global network, does not reach an audience nearly as
wide,  diverse, or strategically targeted as the audience for U.S.  government
broadcasting. Nor can CNN speak on behalf of the U.S.  government. We cannot
rely on Ted Turner to give our official  spokesmen the opportunity to tell
America's story, directly and  unfiltered, in a future world crisis. The United
States, as the  world's only remaining superpower, must retain this &quot;surge
capacity.&quot;   Pop culture and Hollywood shouldn't be the only broadcasters 
of American values abroad. America still needs an official voice  to explain its

</P>
<P><B>M</B>ost opinion polls show that Americans are not very interested  in
foreign policy issues. Indeed, a CNN/<I>USA  Today</I>/Gallup poll early in
1996 found that only 14 percent of Americans regard  foreign policy as a top
priority in forming their vote. Nonetheless,  the American people still demand
that America have a strong  foreign policy that fulfills certain expectations.
These expectations  include maintaining America's leadership in the world,
upholding the  respect of other countries for America, and protecting  America's
interests and the country's future. Therefore, even though  Americans may
express little overt interest in specific foreign  issues, they have a latent
expectation that Presidents fulfill certain  expectations. Disappointing these
expectations can prove to be  politically fatal for a President.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The American people are not isolationist; rather they are  largely
indifferent to foreign policy issues, focusing instead on more  immediate
domestic concerns. Isolationism implies America  must intentionally work alone
without allies, without concerning  itself with foreign matters at all.
Isolationism also implies trade  protectionism. Opinion polls show that
Americans are not  isolationist. They still want a strong America, although one
that relates  foreign policy problems to domestic concerns. Americans are 
worried about too much intervention abroad, but they understand the  need 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 2 -->  for the U.S. to remain engaged in
global affairs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Since the end of the Gulf War, there has not been a  compelling issue to
ignite the latent interest of Americans in foreign policy.  If there were a
crisis with a clear impact on American security  and vital interests overseas,
foreign policy would return to the top  of political priorities in the polls.

<P>Now I would like you to think about how much the U.S.  should spend on
defenses as compared to its potential enemies.  For discussion's sake, let's
include as potential enemies Russia,  China, North Korea, Iraq, Iran, and Libya.
Here are some possible  levels that have bee suggested for U.S. spending. Please
tell me  which one makes the most sense to you. 1. The U.S. spend a bit  more
than its most powerful enemy. 2. The U.S. should spend about  as much as all of
its potential enemies combined. 3. The U.S.  should spend about twice as much as
all its potential enemies  combined. (Poll by <I>Americans on Defense Spending

<P>
</P>
<P>U.S. DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE Operation Joint Endeavor Fact Sheet December 7,
1995
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 12 -->  
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>This fact sheet provides information on the role and mission of  the
Implementation Force (IFOR) in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Why The U.S. Must Play A Role In IFOR</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The United States has vital political, economic and security  interests in
Europe. The war in Bosnia threatens these interests.  We now have the first real
opportunity to end this war. To seize  this opportunity requires a commitment of
U.S. troops as part of  a NATO peace implementation force (IFOR). The risks to 
the United States of allowing the war to continue are greater than  the risks of
enforcing the peace.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>What U.S. Forces Will Do At First</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>It will take approximately eight weeks for the entire U.S. force  of
approximately 20,000 soldiers to arrive in the northeastern  portion of Bosnia,
with a division headquarters in Tuzla. Most of  the troops will come from the
1st Armored Division in Germany.  They will travel to Bosnia mainly by road and
rail using routes that  are currently in use and clear of mines. A Nordic
brigade and a  reinforced Turkish battalion will also be located in the U.S. 
sector which will be under the control of the U.S. Army Major  General William
Nash, the commander of the 1st Armored Division.  Eventually a Russian brigade
will also be located in the U.S. sector.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>When this main body of U.S. forces arrives, they will:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>-     Protect the force
</P>
<P>-      Execute transfer of the U.S. sector from the United Nations  Protec
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 13 -->  tion Force (UNPROFOR)
</P>
<P>-     Establish Joint Military Commissions
</P>
<P>-     Establish a logistic network
</P>
<P>-     Expand the Tuzla airfield
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>What IFOR Will Do</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>There are two complementary aspects of the overall peace  implementation
mission  civil and military. The civil aspect  includes rebuilding the Bosnian
infrastructure, economic  development, elections, and refugee resettling  not an
IFOR mission.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The military aspect  the mission of IFOR  is to create a  stable environment
for the civil aspects to proceed. IFOR, including  U.S. forces, will:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>-     Protect the force by ensuring self-defense and freedom of
 movement for IFOR
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>-     Enforce required withdrawal of forces to respective territories
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>-     Establish a man a zone of separation
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>-     Enforce the cessation of hostilities
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>-      Provide a secure environment which permits conduct of  civil peace
implementation functions.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>NATO and U.S. forces will enforce a peace, not fight a war.  Robust NATO
rules of engagement reflect the philosophy of  sending in a heavy force,
authorized to use deadly force for self  defense, force protection, and to
enforce compliance with the peace plan.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 14 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In contrast to the U.N. mission, there is no dual key in  NATO's rules of
engagement. Field commanders will have authority to  defend troops under their
command and to ensure compliance  with the military aspects of the peace plan.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>IFORs first task will be to oversee the withdrawal of  Federation and
Bosnian Serb forces behind the agreed cease-fire line  within thirty days. Once
this is done, IFOR will monitor and patrol a  four-kilometer (2.5 mile) wide
Zone of Separation along the  internal boundaries between Federation and Bosnian
Serb territory.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>What Parties Must Do</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Beginning when the peace agreement is signed in Paris on  December 14, the
parties to the agreement  the Bosnian Federation  and the Bosnian Serbs  have
specific time frames by which they  must meet specific obligations, as follows:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>-     DAY 1 Begin withdrawing forces, removing mines from Zones
 of Separation, making boundaries
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>-     DAY 3 Air defense radar shut down

</P>
<P>-     DAY 30 Foreign troops (mercenaries, etc.) out of Bosnia.  Military
forces complete withdrawal behind cease fire lines
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>-     DAY 45 Complete withdrawal behind inter-entity boundary lines
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>-     DAY 120 Complete withdrawal of all heavy weapons and  forces to
cantonment/barracks areas
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 15 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>-     DAY 180 Complete negotiations of arms limits
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>What IFOR Will Not Do</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>*</B>     IFOR will not patrol Bosnia's external borders.
According to  the peace settlement, supervision of Bosnia's external borders
will  be done by other organizations, most likely the International  Commission
on the Former Yugoslavia (ICFY), which currently  performs this function.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     IFOR will not act as a police force. That function will be the
 responsibility of the civilian side of the peace implementation  operation.
IFOR personnel will have the authority to detain any  persons who interfere with
the IFOR mission or those individuals who  may be indicted for war crimes, but
they will not try to track  them down.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>      IFOR will not be involved in reconstruction, humanitarian 
relief, political reform, or human rights efforts. Other civilian  agencies and
organizations will be responsible for those tasks. IFOR  also will not be
involved in arming and training Bosnian  Federation forces, if that becomes
necessary to achieve equilibrium  with Bosnian Serb forces.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>When IFOR Will Leave</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>IFOR will deploy long enough to give the civil aspects an  opportunity to
take hold and start making an impact on the lives of  the people of Bosnia. With
high confidence, we believe the  military mission can be completed in
approximately twelve months  from 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 16 -->  the start of deployment. (If
there were to be a complete  breakdown of the settlement, the President does
have the authority to  withdraw U.S. forces from Bosnia.)
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The civil aspects will continue for many years. However, at  the time of
IFOR's withdrawal, conditions in Bosnia will be  substantially different and
more stable than they are today. The forces  will have been separated, the
territories will have been transferred,  and the cycle of violence will have
been broken. We expect the  newly-elected government to take root and economic
reconstruction to  be under way.

<h3>UNITED NATIONS DAY:  NO CAUSE FOR CELEBRATION</h3>
By Brett Schaefer<br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
October 24, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	
	On Oct. 24, we all were expected to bear witness to the great achievements of the United Nations. The organization and its supporters scrambled to hide its misdeeds and dust off its few accomplishments. But they failed to conceal the truth. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The United Nations, despite the claims of reform by Secretary General Boutros-Boutros Ghali and the Clinton administration, remains rife with abuse, waste, fraud and ineffectiveness. Topping the list is wasteful spending on both materials and personnel. In a 1995 article, <i>Money</i> magazine revealed that U.N. employees commonly earn more than twice the pay of comparable positions in New York-based private-sector jobs. In addition to their salaries, the roughly 10,000 U.N. bureaucrats in New York receive an array of special perks including rent allowances and education grants for their children. To top it off, it's all tax free. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	These lucrative positions are, for the most part, not even being filled with competent individuals. Vested interests regard U.N. jobs as opportunities for nepotism and high pay for little work. U.N. employees are not held to any realistic standards of employee evaluation. The U.N. bureaucracy is populated by individuals who fail to meet the basic requirements of an effective civil service. The evaluation system is so abysmal that the U.N. leadership has tried to reform it at least five times. Yet the current system, under which 90 percent of U.N. employees received "excellent" ratings in the recent past, continues with only cosmetic changes.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Of course, such employees aren't anxious to have their work habits exposed. In 1995 the United Nations bought a $1 million turnstile security system for its New York headquarters, but never used it. The reason: The turnstile clocks would have recorded the arrival and departure times of U.N. employees. Heaven forbid: They would have had to work an entire day.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Unfortunately, the full range of problems remains hidden because, until 1995, the world body refused to establish an inspector general's office to root out waste, corruption and inefficiency. When it finally did appoint an inspector general, it did so reluctantly, under threat from the U.S. Congress to withhold funding. Moreover, U.N. officials weakened the office by having the inspector general serve under the authority of the secretary general and by failing to grant the office an independent budget.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	This incredible commitment to waste and inefficiency has spurred the United States -- which provides 25 percent of U.N. funding -- to periodically withhold some of its dues. This has resulted in arrears of approximately $1.2 billion. Congress has refused to pay these arrears until the United Nations pledges to undertake reform.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The United States has chosen the proper course. The world body is in a perpetual state of financial crisis and is cash strapped. Withholding funding is the most effective way to get the U.N. bureaucracy's attention and encourage reform. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The first step toward reform must be an independent audit. The problems can't be fixed until we know in detail what they are. This can best be accomplished by an independent inspector general with a competent staff and budget immune to U.N. pressure. The U.N. system has resisted past reform efforts and will not refrain from using budget blackmail to manipulate the inspector general's office. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	It is also imperative that the inspector general have complete access to all U.N. and related agency records. A primary goal of this audit should be  not only to identify corruption, waste, fraud and abuse, but also to identify which of the United Nation's 70-plus programs are worth continuing, which should be eliminated, and which should be transferred to other organizations that can perform them better.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Only when such an audit is completed and management and organizational reforms have been implemented should U.S. back dues be paid. For the United States to pay in full before reform is implemented would be like giving a child his allowance before he completes his chores. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Only after an independent audit has been performed and U.N. operations reformed  can Americans sincerely say "Happy United Nations Day."

<h3>DRUNK ON POWER</h3>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/thierer.htm">Adam D. Thierer</a><br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
September 12, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	With the fall elections just weeks away, there's one issue far more important to many Americans than presidential debates, congressional mudslinging or the latest Gallup poll. It's beer.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Specifically, the beer tax. This may come as a shock, but every time one of America's 75 million beer drinkers picks up a six-pack of his favorite brew, 43 percent of the cost comes directly from taxes, according to a study by the economic consulting firm DRI/McGraw-Hill. To put this in perspective, a $5 six-pack actually costs only $2.85 -- until you factor in the tax.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The proper response of the American people to this punitive level of taxation should be clear: revolt. At least that's what another group of Americans did when the federal government levied an excessive tax on their liquor. It was the Summer of 1794. To protest an excise tax placed on their whiskey three years earlier, angry citizens in the Northeastern states rose up against their federal overlords, tarring and feathering government officials and burning down their homes. Before you try this at home, a word of caution: The feds had a pretty strong opinion about the "Whiskey Rebellion" protesters. They shot them.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Alas, it's not likely that we'll see today's overtaxed beer drinkers take to the streets. The reason: Beer drinkers have at best a dim understanding that they're even being taxed. The sales and excise taxes that apply to beer are largely "hidden." Consumers see only the final sales price of beer that rings up on the cash register, never realizing that their $15 case costs only $8.50 before taxes. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	But just because beer taxes are hidden doesn't mean their effect isn't real, both on beer drinkers' wallets and on the economy. Consider: Since 1990, when beer taxes were boosted as part of a larger tax package, the beer industry has lost 60,000 jobs, according to The Beer Institute. When American brewers pay seven times more in taxes than they earn in profits, it's difficult to retain their workers. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	To add insult to injury, the other taxes that were part of the 1990 package -- notably on yachts, private planes, jewelry and furs -- have all been repealed. This is great for people with disposable incomes of around, say, a million dollars, but it does nothing for the little guy who pays the beer tax (nearly two-thirds of all the beer sold in America each year is bought by households earning less than $45,000). 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Fortunately, relief may be at hand. Rep. Phil English, R-Pa., has introduced legislation that would cut the beer tax in half -- back to its pre-1990 level. "Because they are concealed," English says, "these taxes engender little opposition from the taxpayers. But they contribute tangibly to the cost of living for hard-working Americans." No kidding. If you buy just one $5 six-pack a week, by the end of the year you've forked over $112 in taxes to the government. That's more than a full day's work for the average wage earner.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Of course, English's proposal is sure to meet with opposition from those who think cutting the beer tax will lead to increased alcohol consumption. These folks -- let's call them liberals -- view the tax code as a powerful tool for bending human behavior to fit their preferences. And at the moment, beer drinking is one activity definitely frowned upon by the wine-and-cheese crowd.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The ironies are delicious. Not only do liberals, the traditional advocates of "progressive" taxation, wind up supporting a tax that falls disproportionately on lower- and middle-income Americans, but these self-styled champions of "the worker" also ignore the fact that the beer tax hurts an industry that employs 2.6 million people -- everything from assembly-line workers in bottling plants to delivery-truck drivers.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Let's face it, the beer tax is a raw deal. But don't expect change anytime soon. Maybe it's their nature, but too many lawmakers are addicted to controlling people's lives through levies like the beer tax. In short, they're drunk on power.

<h3>WHAT WOULD GEORGE WASHINGTON SAY?</h3>
By Matthew Spalding<br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
September 12, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	Imagine picking up your morning newspaper and reading the headline: "President To Resign; Issues Solemn Warnings To Nation." 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	This startling news greeted readers of Philadelphia's largest newspaper on the morning of Sept. 19, 1796, when George Washington unexpectedly announced his retirement from the presidency of the United States. The nation would have been happy to see him continue.  
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	But our first president wanted to set an example for his successors, and as he left public life he offered the nation a document that is one of the greatest in American history. On its 200th anniversary, Washington's Farewell Address -- although remembered primarily for its advice on foreign affairs -- gives us much insight into how he might view America in the 1990s. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	In it, Washington warned us of the dangers of Big Government. He told us to watch out for the tendency of government to encroach on individual freedoms and consolidate its power. What American can say this warning has not been justified by subsequent events? "A just estimate of that love of power, and proneness to abuse it, which predominates in the human heart is sufficient to satisfy us of the truth of this position," Washington said. We could add: Any doubt that might be left can be put to rest by assessing the size and reach of the U.S. government in 1996. 	
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	Our only defense against an over-reaching, tyrannical government, Washington insisted, is the Constitution's strict limits on government power. Washington said that unless these limits were carefully adhered to -- that is, unless the federal government exercised only those functions specifically delegated to it by the Constitution and by the authority of the people, and no more -- the nation would become vulnerable to "cunning, ambitious and unprincipled men."  
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	Could Americans' distrust of their elected representatives, their sense that government has overextended its proper authority, and that average citizens no longer have enough say in matters that affect them, be the result of disregarding Washington's warning? 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	Washington warned of "the baneful effects of the Spirit of Party" and the notorious problem of faction. By this he didn't mean what me mean by "parties," but instead what we call "special-interest groups" pushing their own single-issue agendas at the expense of wider, more serious concerns having to do with the common good. He called partisan spirit "a fire not to be quenched; it demands a uniform vigilance to prevent its bursting into a flame, lest instead of warming it should consume."  
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	How many times in recent decades have Americans watched in despair as partisanship overshadowed principle in the nation's capital; as one special interest in Congress prevented another from passing a good law? Washington believed fundamental change in a free government comes about not through clever strategies, "hot button" issues or attack ads but by honest deliberation, patient persuasion, and a willingness to put principle above self-interest.  
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	In his Farewell Address, Washington also told Americans that while their Constitution creates a framework for good government, it could only work if the people govern themselves rightly. In the absence of governmental restraints, the people would have to restrain their own passions and prejudices. Washington meant to encourage religion and morality as "indispensable supports" for political prosperity. He cautioned Americans never to expect virtue from their elected representatives if they were not moral, virtuous people themselves.   
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	Two centuries later social scientists are just discovering what Washington always knew: that religious belief and moral education are the surest social inoculation against crime, drug abuse,  illegitimacy and practically every other social ill one can name. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	By ignoring much of Washington's advice, America has moved far down the path he said had "hitherto marked the Destiny of Nations." Today our government is virtually unlimited and out of control; politics is dominated by base factionalism and personal invective; our culture is adrift from the breakup of community and the family; we increasingly question our national purpose and role in the world.  
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	Amidst these seemingly intractable problems, Americans would do well to look to the father of their country -- and the Farewell Address -- for guidance. His "counsels of an old and affectionate friend," as he called them, are as true in 1996 as they were in 1796.

<h3>DON'T BRAKE FOR BIG GOVERNMENT</h3>
By Tyce Palmaffy<br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
August 29, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;


	Americans have always looked on the Labor Day weekend as one last fling with summer. For most drivers, that once meant a lot of high-anxiety mileage, as they worried about keeping up with traffic while avoiding ticket-happy state troopers.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	But no longer. Last year Congress repealed  the National Maximum Speed Limit of 55 mph (65 mph on rural interstates and freeways designed for high speeds).  Now states can set their own speed limits based on local driving conditions. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	For more than 20 years, the Democratic leadership in Congress blocked all efforts to overturn this anachronism. In 1995, though, the tide changed. With their robust commitment to limited government, conservative House and Senate freshmen strongly pushed for a repeal -- and were finally successful when President Clinton reluctantly signed their bold legislation.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Since the repeal, more than 20 states have raised their limits, including seven within a week of the repeal's effective date. Four of those states -- Oklahoma, Wyoming, Nevada and Arizona -- posted a top speed of 75 mph, while Montana eliminated its daytime speed limit for passenger vehicles, reverting to its pre-1974 law requiring drivers to maintain a "reasonable and prudent speed."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The results? Highway patrolmen and state traffic engineers in Montana and in every other state I spoke with -- 11 in all -- report that average speeds have only increased one to two mph. Fatalities have actually decreased in some states. So much for safety advocates' apocalyptic predictions. 	Patrolmen and traffic engineers -- whose reputations depend on drivers' safety --resoundingly supported the repeal because it permits states to set more reasonable speed limits. According to engineers, the proper method of determining limits is to measure the speed of traffic under ideal conditions. The posted speed limit should be the speed that 85 percent of traffic is traveling. In effect, drivers set the speed limit.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	On many highways, the federally mandated 55 and 65 mph speed limits were unreasonably low -- often five or 10, and sometimes 15 mph below this driver-imposed maximum. The feds, of course, set the low limits in the name of safety. Yet, when people drive at the 85th percentile speed, they "are least likely to be in motor vehicle crashes," according to engineer Tom Hicks of the Maryland State Highway Administration. "It's the people who drive much slower or faster who are most at risk."	Unreasonably low speed limits exacerbate the risk posed by these slower and faster drivers. Alan Soltani, the chief traffic engineer at the Oklahoma Department of Transportation, says when the driver-set maximum was 75 and the speed limit was set at 55, "drivers weren't comfortable -- some drove 55, some 65, some 75. There was so much variance that accidents increased." When the limit is raised to its proper level, the evidence shows, these dangerous variances in speed start to disappear. 	
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Efforts to enforce unreasonably low speed limits also undermine police effectiveness. In 1978, Congress started requiring the states to certify drivers' compliance with the 55 mph limit or face cuts in their federal highway funds. So highway patrolmen were told to enforce a law that the majority of motorists were breaking -- a law that threatened rather than improved safety. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Indeed, in a 1984 study of the effects of the 55 mph speed limit, the National Research Council found that 29 percent of highway patrol hours were devoted to rural interstates, where only 9 percent of traffic fatalities occurred. This means more dangerous roads -- such as undivided country highways, high-speed two-lane roads and highways running through congested commercial areas -- received less attention. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	By requiring states to prove they were enforcing the 55 mph speed limit, the federal legislation effectively reduced patrol presence on non-interstates while increasing the traffic on these roadways. This substantially endangered safety.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	"People move off and onto interstates depending on the speed," says Bill Jackman, a representative of the American Automobile Association. "If the speed limit is only 55 or 65, they will move onto a country road that will get them there just as fast. The problem there is that the fatality rate is three times higher when you get off the interstates. Interstates are the safest highways we have." With repeal of the federal limit, states can post more realistic limits that will attract drivers to the safer interstates.	The repeal of the national speed limit may even signal new attitudes in Washington. Restoring the states' authority on this issue means trusting them to form safe and responsible policies. And if we can trust the states in this area, why not others?

<h3>LABOR PAINS</h3>

	This Labor Day the country will kick back, fire up the barbecue, and take a moment to celebrate the accomplishments of America's working men and women. But will those workers themselves have anything to celebrate?

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The answer is, sadly, not much. Despite a seemingly rosy employment picture -- more than 11 million new jobs since 1991 and an unemployment rate down to 5.4 percent -- the real outlook for U.S. workers remains rather grim. Scratch below the surface of these numbers, and the much-discussed economic anxiety felt by America's workers becomes perfectly understandable.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	For starters, job layoffs are continuing at a blistering pace. In the first six months of 1996, 271,000 Americans lost their jobs, the second-highest number this decade. Layoffs were 28 percent higher than during the first six months of 1995, and 6 percent higher than in 1993, the largest "downsizing" year of the decade.  So far this year, thousands of jobs have vanished in important industries such as telecommunications (43,000), computers (22,000), and automobiles (18,000). 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	What's more, even those workers able to find new jobs are taking it on the chin: Weekly earnings in their new positions are averaging 8.2 percent less than in their old jobs. For workers aged 45 to 55 -- those with home mortgages and kids in college to support -- the pay cuts are averaging an even higher 14 percent. And to add insult to injury, nearly one of every five displaced workers lands in a new job that doesn't even offer health-insurance coverage.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	But even these folks are better off than the large number of workers who can't find new jobs at all. The fact is, the long-term unemployment rate -- which measures the number of jobless Americans out of work for six months or more -- remains at a stubbornly high 18.5 percent. Compare this with the average of 10.3 percent during the three previous U.S. economic expansions.  Even out-of-work white-collar managers and other professionals have been having a rough time; nearly one in five is still unemployed after six months of searching.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	What about those workers lucky enough to hold onto their jobs? Here, too, the news is less than upbeat. Adjusted for inflation, full-time workers' paychecks haven't increased for five years. For men, real weekly earnings have actually dropped by 5.1 percent, and for black and Hispanic men the drop has been even worse, 5.4 percent and 8.2 percent respectively.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The decline in weekly earnings can be partly explained by the disappearance of high-paying manufacturing jobs. Since March of 1995, the economy has shed more than 280,000 such jobs. In fact, fewer manufacturing jobs exist today than when the economic recovery began five years ago. In addition, the number of Americans working in high-skilled technician and related jobs has dropped by 478,000 since 1992, the number working in administrative support and clerical positions has fallen by 298,000, and the number working in precision production, craft and repair occupations has declined by 13,000 (and remains 519,000 below the peak of 14 million reached in March of 1990). 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	What all this adds up to, predictably, is anxiety on the part of the American worker. Nearly 50 percent of Americans believe jobs are not very plentiful, according to the Conference Board's most recent survey of consumer confidence, and 46 percent believe the economy is getting worse, according to a recent CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Let's face it: For many American workers President Clinton's declaration that the economy is "the healthiest it has been in 30 years" rings hollow. They seem to understand instinctively what many economists have been saying -- that the Clinton economy's growth rate of slightly more than 2 percent a year is not sufficient to produce a large number of good, stable, high-paying jobs.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The fact is, the economy can grow much faster than it has these past four years. We experienced growth rates of 3.5 percent for most of the 1980s, and the economy produced 19 million new jobs. But that was during a period of lower taxation and fewer regulations on business.  In the current era of high taxes and heavy regulation, 2 percent growth and sluggish job creation may be the best we can hope for.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	And that's nothing to celebrate.

<title> Women Don't Need Affirmative Action - Heritage Commentary</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg">
<center>

<h3> Women Don't Need Affirmative Action </h3>

By Sally C. Pipes and Michael Lynch<br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
July 25, 1996
<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;


	A well-financed, pro-affirmative action propaganda campaign is underway to defeat the California Civil Rights Initiative (CCRI), an amendment to California's constitution that would prohibit the state from granting preference -- or discriminating -- on the basis of race, ethnicity, religion or sex. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Much of this pro-affirmative action, anti-CCRI campaign is focused on women.  The obvious reason: Women are a bigger voting bloc than minorities, the usual target of such campaigns. If most women can be convinced that race- and sex-based preferences are fair, that could decide the battle. And this is a battle whose outcome could easily affect the lives of both men and women across the nation.   
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	That's why it is important to understand why women should reject race- and sex-based "affirmative action." There are at least four reasons.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	First, like men, women believe in equality before the law. They believe racial, ethnic and gender preferences violate the proposition that all men and women are created equal. Women know their advances in the workplace and voting booth have come not by departing from this creed, but by upholding it -- by showing that America wasn't living up to its own principles of equality. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Second, women are mothers, wives, daughters and sisters. No one is better placed than a woman to see the double-edged nature of racial and gender preferences. It is clear to a mother that an institutional preference for her daughter is institutional discrimination against her son. Susan Constantine, a mother of three boys, made precisely this point in a letter to the San Francisco Chronicle. "I find affirmative action and the like racist and sexist ... Just as I am opposed to racism and sexism, I am opposed to this form of unequal opportunity toward our sons."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Third, women themselves often are treated unfairly under affirmative action plans. Consider the case of Lydia Cheryl McDonald. A Los Angeles resident, McDonald grew up in a broken home and lived on welfare after her father abandoned her family. Yet she accumulated a grade-point average in high school of 4.5 -- on a four point scale -- due to credit for advanced placement classes. In addition to working 15 hours a week, McDonald wracked up an impressive list of achievements and awards, including high honors on California's prestigious Golden State Exam for geometry. She is exactly the kind of candidate the University of California at Berkeley claims to be looking for: high-achieving, well rounded, but poor.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In March 1996, McDonald received a rejection letter informing her that "we sought an academically strong freshman class which includes students from a wide range of cultural, ethnic, geographic, racial and socio-economic backgrounds." In other words, "diversity" was more important than excellence. Had it not been for the intervention of a lawyer so outraged by McDonald's case that he offered his services pro bono and threatened the University with a lawsuit, Lydia would not be looking forward to spring admission.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Finally, women know that their most significant advances in the workplace have not resulted from affirmative action, but from equality of opportunity and hard work.  A modern political mantra has it that white women have been the greatest beneficiaries of quota-based affirmative action. But academic analysis finds little conclusive evidence that women, on the whole, have benefited from such preferences.  
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Women have made progress in all segments of the work force in the last 30 years. As Anita K. Blair, executive vice president of the Independent Women's Forum recently pointed out, the most important reason is that women went to college. In 1960, only 19 percent of bachelor's degrees went to women. By 1995, women claimed 55 percent of B.A.s. During the same period, women increased their share of lucrative professional degrees -- M.B.A.s, M.D.s and J.D.s -- by more than 500 percent. The increase in college enrollment is a result not of affirmative action, but of changing personal choices.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Today, half of all professionals are female, and women hold nearly half of all managerial and executive positions. Women are starting their own businesses in droves. In 1995, according to the National Foundation for Women Business Owners, women owned nearly 8 million businesses with more than $2.25 trillion in sales.  
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Those fighting the California Civil Rights Initiative are saying, in essence, that  women need the government's help in order to compete. But the facts do not support this view. Women should not fall for the sophistry and hypocrisy of organized interests who actually benefit from the perpetual racial and sexual strife caused by affirmative action. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	After all, a society where equal rights are protected by the full force of the law is as beneficial to women as it is to men. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	Parades, fireworks, barbecues -- it's that time of year when Americans celebrate their bold, 220 year-old experiment in democracy and political freedom. When it comes to religious freedom, however, many people will not be in a celebratory mood.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Consider: An Illinois school district recently banned any reference to God in student presentations at a commencement program. A California high school prevented students from distributing invitations to a Bible study group. A school principal in Virginia barred a student from reading her Bible on a school bus.
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
While some Americans accept such bans as enforcement of the principle of separation of church and state, others are up in arms over what they consider outright religious persecution. Due to efforts by religious conservatives, Congress may soon unveil an amendment to the U.S. Constitution to prevent educators from muzzling permissible forms of religious speech. 
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
But Charles Haynes, an authority on religion and education issues -- and a religious conservative -- isn't sanguine about adding a postscript to the First Amendment. Although he laments a widespread failure to take religion seriously in the classroom, Haynes says a constitutional amendment isn't needed to protect religious expression. Despite some mistaken judicial rulings, he says, court interpretations of the First Amendment still permit private religious speech by students as well as classroom instruction about religion. "Let's try the Amendment we have before we add another one," he says. "We still really haven't tried to make the First Amendment work." 
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Making it "work" means educating parents and teachers about the forms of religious expression still permissible under state and federal court rulings. Haynes, a scholar at Vanderbilt University, and Oliver Thomas, an expert on church-state law who has taught at Georgetown University Law Center, work district by district, getting educators and community leaders of different faiths to agree on three basic rules: (1) Schools must protect the religious freedoms of students of all faiths, or of no faith; (2) parents have primary responsibility for the education of their children; and (3) public debates must always be conducted with respect.
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
School districts around the nation are signing up. Called the "Three Rs Project" (for Rights, Responsibilities and Respect), the program has been introduced in all of California's 58 counties. It has been endorsed by groups as diverse as the Anti-Defamation League, the American Civil Liberties Union, the Christian Educators Association International, and the California Teachers Association. And a growing number of states -- including Georgia, Pennsylvania, New Mexico, New York, Texas and Utah -- are moving ahead with the initiative.
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Of course, if the program can work in California, it can work anywhere. The student bodies in some California districts speak 90 different languages -- and almost as many ways to talk about faith in the classroom.
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Haynes and Thomas have met with school officials and community leaders throughout the state. Their <I>modus operandi</I>: Encourage local school boards to approve the Three Rs Project, organize teams of parents and educators to attend seminars on the First Amendment, send teachers to curriculum workshops, and build community support. If  this sounds like an old-fashioned civics lesson, it is -- and it seems to be working.
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In the Snowline School District in Southern California a few years ago, the stage was set for a church-state debacle: A teacher prevented a third-grade student from writing a report on Jonah and the whale; officials hesitated when a school board member donated books espousing creationism to the school library; a parent objected when a high-school student group wanted to start every meeting with prayer.
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
But the community, trained in the Three Rs program, was ready. The district peacefully reached agreements on each flash point: The Jonah report was approved, books on creationism now sit on library shelves, and the student group agreed to begin meetings with a moment of silence, not prayer. 
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
"It's very clear that the student expression of religious values is almost never inhibited by the First Amendment," says Jan Vondra, assistant superintendent of curricula and education services at Snowline. Rather, it is the government's -- and hence, the public schools' -- religious speech that is restricted. "As long as their expressions are not disruptive, student freedoms are very, very broad," Vondra says.
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Now there's a lesson in liberty: that neither pluralism nor separation of church and state need hush freedom of speech -- even religious speech -- in our public schools. <p>

<h3> THE RECOVERY OF AMERICAN CITIZENSHIP </h3>

<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	When America's founding fathers talked about "citizenship," they meant people -- not political elites -- taking responsibility for themselves, their families, their communities. This Fourth of July, Americans should think about joining a movement that would restore the founders' vision of how Americans solve their problems.  
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
I'm talking about the "citizenship" movement, which aims to rein in Washington so the energy and effectiveness of state and local government and private alternatives to government can be explored to the fullest. One of America's core objectives during the next 20 years should be to recover this tradition of American citizenship. We must restore the link between freedom and personal responsibility, the two great themes of modern conservatism, and an increasingly attractive idea to liberals beginning to see the futility of government solutions. Our hope is that we can overcome much of the divisiveness and incivility that has characterized political discourse over the past several decades.
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Americans come from all races, all nationalities, all religions. We are united in citizenship not by common ancestry but by a common commitment to the principles of the United States: the rule of law, the decentralized government promised by our Constitution, the rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Americans are united, too, by the common duties of citizenship: the obligation to protect our country from foreign enemies, to take care of our own families, to participate actively in civic life, to assist our neighbors and communities when they are needy, and, in turn, not to take advantage of others' generosity when we can take care of ourselves.
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This distinctively American tradition of citizenship was best described by the Frenchman Alexis de Tocqueville in "Democracy in America," his classic book of 1832. Tocqueville described America as the most democratic, most egalitarian, most religious, most prosperous, most charitable country on earth -- with limited national government and active citizen involvement in local government. It was an America of strong families and entrepreneurial business leadership, an America where voluntary associations of citizens were more important -- and more powerful -- than politicians in addressing the problems of their own communities. 
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This is not to say Tocqueville's America wasn't marred by some terrible evils -- most notably the scourge of slavery. But there also were many things of which Thomas Jefferson and James Madison could be proud. It was a republic of self-governing citizens, which is what the founding fathers envisioned when they declared independence from England and wrote our Constitution.
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
To revive the founders' dream, it is essential to reduce the size and scope of the national government. But just as liberals must learn to accept this fact, conservatives must understand that merely tearing down the Washington establishment will not be sufficient. It is also essential to strengthen the families, voluntary associations, churches and other religious organizations, local governments and other institutions of civil society that will remedy the ills left untreated by failed federal-government programs.
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Revivals of private initiative have happened before. The second half of the 19th  and the early 20th century saw the creation of the Red Cross, the Boy Scouts, YMCAs and YWCAs, and countless other voluntary organizations that strengthened character and addressed the failings of their communities. A similar wave of social entrepreneurship will sweep America in the next generation. 	
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The recovery of American citizenship is the most important unifying principle for Americans in the post-Cold War era. It appeals to libertarians with their emphasis on a free society of voluntary, non-governmental institutions. It appeals to those with religious values who emphasize faith and family and responsibility for the needy. It appeals to growth-and-opportunity conservatives who emphasize economic freedom. With its attention to the common obligations of citizenship, this idea appeals to nationalists who want to restore a strong sense of American cultural identity. And it appeals to liberals and their love for community activism.
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
"Without local institutions," wrote Tocqueville 160 years ago, "a nation may give itself a free government, but it does not have the spirit of liberty." It is time for all Americans to help rebuild the local institutions that will bring back our spirit of liberty.<p>

<title>Really Stand for Children: Fix Welfare -- Heritage</title>

<h3>
REALLY STAND FOR CHILDREN: FIX WELFARE</h3>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/rector.htm">Robert Rector</a><br>
Senior Analyst for Welfare and Family Issues <br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
June 6, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>

<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Recently, the nation's capitol was the  scene of  the "Stand for Children" rally organized by the liberal Children's Defense Fund. The rally's proclaimed goal was to call attention to the plight of the nation's children; its unstated goal was to defend the continuing growth of the welfare system and to criticize those in Congress who have sought reform. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	While the rally was correct to call attention to the plight of many of  America's children, the irony is that children are suffering because of the governmental policies supported by the rally's organizers. Children are suffering because the liberal welfare state has carpet-bombed the moral foundations of  the inner city, toppling marriage, gutting the work ethic, and leaving a rubble of social pathology in its wake.  
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The failure of the War on Poverty stems from its flawed premise: a core belief  that "material poverty" is critically harmful to children. According to this view, welfare, by reducing material poverty, can  increase children's well-being and lifetime attainment.  Similarly, since poverty "causes" such problems as crime, school failure, low cognitive ability, illegitimacy, an eroded work ethic, and drug use -- greater welfare spending can readily reduce poverty and most social problems at the same time. From this simplistic logic has sprung a relentless 30-year effort to raise welfare benefits, expand welfare eligibility, create new welfare programs, and increase welfare spending. The "Stand for Children" rally repeated this tired theme.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	But history refutes this naive belief in welfare. In 1950, nearly a third of the U.S. population was poor (twice the current rate). In the 1920s, roughly half of the population was poor by today's standard. If it were true that "material poverty" causes social problems, we should have had far more social problems in those earlier periods than we do today. On the contrary: Crime, family breakup and most other social problems were nowhere near the levels they are today.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	History and common sense both show that values and abilities within families -- not family income -- are what determine children's achievement. Successful families tend to have sound values concerning self-control, deferred gratification, work, education and marriage, which they pass on to their children. Attempting to raise family income artificially through welfare does little to benefit a child, but does a lot to destroy the very values that are key to a child's success.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The point many liberals refuse to recognize is that welfare has behavioral side effects. It engenders dependence and illegitimacy, both highly injurious to children's development. For example, among the nearly 5 million families currently receiving AFDC benefits, the total time spent on welfare will average nearly 13 years. A 1994 report by June O'Neill, currently Congressional Budget Office director, shows that increasing the length of time a child spends on welfare may reduce the child's IQ by as much as 20 percent. O'Neill makes clear that welfare dependence, rather than poverty, is what truly hurts children. <p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
          	By paying women more money when they have children out of wedlock, welfare also plays a powerful role in promoting illegitimacy, a fact acknowledged by President Clinton but ignored by the "Stand for Children" organizers. Being born outside of marriage and raised in a single-parent home triples the level of behavioral and emotional problems among children; nearly triples the level of teen sexual activity; doubles the probability a young woman will have children out of wedlock; and doubles the probability a boy will engage in criminal activity and wind up in jail. 	
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	We can't help America's children by continuing past mistaken policies. The current welfare system must be replaced; the automatic and rapid growth of welfare spending must be curtailed. In the future, welfare no longer should be a one-way hand out; adult recipients should be required to work for the benefits they receive. And steps must be taken to reduce future illegitimacy, beginning with restricting cash welfare to unmarried teen moms. 
 <p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	We must begin to focus on institutions with a record of success, not failure.  Religious institutions have been dramatically successful in reducing teen sexual activity, crime, drug use, and other problems among young people. One way to give the poor access to this fountain of hope would be to give poor parents education vouchers they could  freely use to send their children to private schools, including religious schools. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	But Americans should remember that well-meaning, big-government liberals who call welfare reformers "anti-child" are the unwitting advocates of precisely what is hurting America's children: welfare.<p>

<title>Jerry-Rigged Foreign Policy -- Heritage</title>

<h3>
JERRY-RIGGED FOREIGN POLICY</h3>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/holmes.htm">Kim Holmes</a><br>
Vice President and Director of Foreign Policy and Defense Studies <br>

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
.

	The Clinton administration is about to make the same mistake in Bosnia it made in Somalia, where 18 U.S. Marines died unnecessarily. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The White House recently announced it would expand the role of the U.S.-led peacekeeping force in Bosnia to include scouring the countryside for war criminals. This is something the administration specifically promised not to do, a role that was purposefully left out of the Dayton Peace Accords because of its divisiveness and its potential for indefinitely expanding the Bosnia mission and producing casualties.   
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Why is the administration taking this step? It wants to apprehend Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and his military chief Ratko Mladic, both still exercising control over Serb-held territory. And no wonder: If these two are not apprehended, it will be difficult for the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe to sanction elections scheduled for September, as called for in the peace accords. 	
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Without elections, no stable government will be established in Bosnia. With no government, withdrawing U.S. troops, as President Clinton promised, may not happen. In other words, the house of cards the president set up in Bosnia could come crashing down. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Of course, if by November election time it doesn't look like U.S. troops will come home soon, the president's Bosnia policy will be revealed for what it is: a jerry-rigged, politically tuned deal that puts U.S. forces at the mercy of events that can spin out of control at any time. To avoid this perception, the White House apparently is willing to risk substantial U.S. casualties -- both Karadzic and Mladic travel with 50 to 60 heavily armed escorts. But if Americans die, a la Somalia, the backlash could be even worse. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The whole mess is typical of the foreign policy ineptitude shown by this administration from the beginning. The Clinton team, influenced by its opposition to the Vietnam War, came into office confused about which situations warrant U.S. military intervention, and which do not. It became clear that the president believed  multinational peacekeeping was the wave of the future for U.S. foreign policy. The administration appeared more comfortable with the idea of "foreign policy as social work." This global utopianism led the president to commit America to dubious peacekeeping efforts in Somalia, Haiti and Bosnia, with sometimes tragic, never satisfactory results. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Few Americans realize how many gross errors and misjudgments have been made in foreign policy. Consider:<ul>
	<li>The White House has wasted precious years during which America could have erected global anti-missile defenses. For less than $3 billion it could have upgraded the Navy's Aegis fleet air-defense system as many experts have proposed, spending another $5 billion later on space-based sensors. Instead, the administration has done nothing in the face of CIA estimates that at least 20 countries already have or may be developing weapons of mass destruction and the ballistic missile systems to deliver them.	
	<p><li>The Clinton Pentagon determined that America needed to be able to fight two regional conflicts "nearly simultaneously." Yet the president has neglected to provide the funding needed to sustain this capability. 
	<p><li>The administration has zig-zagged on China policy, at times threatening, at other times appeasing, sending confused signals throughout Asia that have undermined U.S. credibility in the region and heightened tensions between China and Taiwan. 
	<p><li>The administration secretly tried to make a deal with Fidel Castro whereby Cuban boat people would be sent back forcibly to Cuba instead of being allowed into the United States. This betrayal of the Cuban people -- overturning 30 years of principled U.S. policy -- was only abandoned after Cuba shot down two U.S. civilian aircraft.   
	<p><li>The White House has organized a multi-billion-dollar deal that will give North Korea two nuclear reactors -- and still we don't know for sure whether Pyongyang has discontinued its budding nuclear-weapons program. 
	<p><li>In Haiti, America spent $2 billion to put in office an avowed Marxist  known for his hostility to the United States, all in the name of "restoring democracy." Whatever it is, the regime now in place is no democracy. 
<p>	<li>Finally, with no U.S. interests at stake, the White House sent U.S. forces to Bosnia, when it could have simply lifted the arms embargo on the Bosnian Muslims and allowed them to defend themselves. Now, worried that failure in Bosnia could threaten its standing in the polls, the White House is playing with the possibility of expanding and lengthening the mission, thus unnecessarily placing U.S. forces in even greater danger.</ul><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	This is no way to conduct foreign policy.<p>

HOW TO AVOID THE NEXT BUDGET CRISIS</h3>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/mason.htm">David Mason</a><br>
Vice President for Government Relations<br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
May 23, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	For months now, Congress has been in retreat after being blamed for two partial government shutdowns, the result of its battle with President Clinton over the fiscal 1996 federal budget. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	Lawmakers are now scurrying to accommodate the president's spending priorities to avoid an election-year bruising over the 1997 budget, even as they try to preserve enough of their own agenda to save face. But no matter how hard they try, they are going to find themselves in yet another battle royal.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Why?  Is America doomed to suffer government shutdowns year after year, depending only on how vociferously Congress and the White House disagree on budget priorities, tax and spending policy?
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Not at all. As it turns out, there is a perfectly good reason why Congress and the president seem perpetually at loggerheads over the budget: Because the law is written in a way that makes this inevitable.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Under the 1974 Budget Act, a Watergate-era attempt by Congress to limit the power of the executive branch, the president is excluded from the budget process until it's almost over -- a recipe for the kind of 11th-hour budget showdowns that grabbed the headlines for so many months.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Here's how it works. Each January the president sends a budget to Capitol Hill, which Congress promptly ignores. In the spring, Congress adopts its own budget resolution based on its own priorities. During the summer, Congress crafts the 13 detailed spending bills needed to meet the budget targets outlined in the resolution, as well as a reconciliation bill making changes in tax and entitlement policy. Finally, in the fall, usually just before the Oct. 1 start of the new fiscal year, Congress sends the budget bills to the president, who now has only one way to try to restore his spending priorities: veto the bills and force an end-of-the-year budget fight. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The result: With insufficient time to negotiate the details, the government shuts down over a dispute about whether or not Medicare premiums should rise by $6 a month.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	To make matters worse, the Budget Act also forces spending to go up even if Congress doesn't want it to. When members of Congress sit down to figure out how much to spend on a program in the coming fiscal year, the Budget Act mandates that they take last year's spending level and automatically add in the cost of population growth, anticipated inflation and other factors. This becomes the new "baseline" for spending, which means that even if Congress does not vote to increase the budget for a program, spending increases will happen anyway.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Any member of Congress who proposes to increase spending on a program by less than the baseline projection is accused of "cutting" the program. That's how Congress' plan to boost spending on Medicare by $100 billion over seven years became a "cut."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	A reform plan proposed by Rep. Christopher Cox, R-Calif., would fix the problems created by the Budget Act of 1974. For starters, the budget resolution adopted by Congress in the spring would be a legally binding law, signed by the president, and would set a limit on how much the government can spend in the coming fiscal year. In addition, the resolution would have to pass by an early date, April 15, in Cox's plan.  
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	As a result, Congress and the president would know more than five months before the start of the new fiscal year exactly how much money they have to work with.  This would give the two sides a strong incentive to get the big, controversial budget issues (like tax cuts and entitlement reform) out of the way first, greatly lessening the chance of a last-minute deadlock forcing a government shutdown.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The Cox plan also would purge the budget process of the pro-spending bias created by "baseline budgeting." Year-to-year spending totals would be compared in real dollars, not in the inflated dollars of the baseline. No longer would advocates of higher spending be able to call a spending increase a "cut." Spending hikes would be out in the open, rather than buried in the dark recesses of the budget process.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The United States has experienced numerous budget crises over the past decade -- in 1986, 1988, 1990, and again in 1995-96. Add to this the bias toward higher spending written into the Budget Act and it's clear the time has come for reform.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Why wait for the next budget crisis to expose (yet again) the flaws in the current system? If Congress wants to end the saga of government shutdowns and impose some real spending control, it should fix the system now.

Mason studies the problems that critics say have left Congress unresponsive to the taxpayers and beholden to special interests.  Under his direction, Heritage published The Ruling Class: Inside the Imperial Congress (1993), an assessment of pervasive institutional problems and solutions. He also directed Heritage's liaison program with the executive branch, and identified and recommended conservative candidates for key public policy positions. A former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense  and  eight-year  veteran  of  Capitol  Hill,  Mason  previously served as Staff Director to then-House Minority Whip Rep. Trent Lott, R-Miss.

<title>The March For Big Government -- Heritage</title>

<h3>
THE MARCH FOR BIG GOVERNMENT</h3>
By Kenneth Weinstein<br>
Director of the Government Reform Project<br>
 <a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
May 23, 1996<br>
<hr width="50%"></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	On June 1, 1996, national attention will focus on the "Stand for Children" march on the Mall in Washington, D.C.  The theme of this march, ostensibly, is something that all Americans can support: "a day ... to celebrate children and those who struggle every day to raise them." 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	Organizers of the "Stand for Children" claim between 200,000 and 1 million people will gather at the Lincoln Memorial "in a non-partisan call to action."  Unfortunately, the principal "action" likely to be called for is an increase in federal spending. The reason: More than 100 of the sponsoring organizations are direct federal grant recipients receiving more than $392 million annually. The actual figure is assuredly higher, since that total excludes grants to many affiliate organization as well as all funds received from state or local governments. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	A slick public relations campaign has generated dozens of news stories hailing the Stand's call "to affirm our responsibility as families, individuals, communities, and as a national community for improving the quality of life of children."  But an examination of organizations endorsing the event makes it clear that the Stand for Children is not a non-partisan, pro-children march. It is a stand for government dependency and ought to be dubbed "The March For Big Government."  Consider:
<ul>
	<li>The event is being convened by the Children's Defense Fund (CDF) -- an organization once chaired by Hillary Rodham Clinton. The president of the CDF, Marian Wright Edelman, is a chief opponent of  the 104th Congress' efforts to reform welfare.  In 1973, Edelman admitted that because she no longer could stir up interest in government programs by speaking of "poor people," she would emphasize children.  "Children," after all, "might be a very effective way to broaden the base of change."
<p>	<li>Lobbyists appear to be a major constituency of the Stand for Children. Lobbying groups that push for greater spending on federal programs already costing more than $7 billion annually have endorsed the march. Among these are the National and Community Service Coalition (chief lobbyist for President Clinton's $400 million national service boondoggle, AmeriCorps), the National Head Start Center (lobbyist for the $2.2 billion Head Start program), and the National Association of WIC Directors (The Special Supplement Food Program for Women, Infants, and Children, a $3.6 billion federal program in fiscal year 1995). Families USA, a key lobbying organization for Bill Clinton's failed big-government health-care plan, is also a march endorser.
<p>	<li>At least 20 national organizations representing government employees, such as the U.S. Conference of City Human Services Officials and the National Association of School Psychologists, also will be participating in the march.
<p>	<li>The AFL-CIO, which is spending $35 million in mandatory union dues to defeat conservative members of Congress this year, is actively promoting the march. Thirty-three of its affiliated unions are serving as national endorsing organizations for the Stand for Children. At this past February's meeting of the AFL-CIO Executive Committee, when union leaders decided to launch their efforts to "take back the Congress" (take it back for whom?), two guests were invited to speak: one was Marian Wright Edelman, who spoke about the Stand for Children rally. Obviously, she got what she was after.
<p>	<li>At least 50 liberal organizations with no special focus on children, including the Americans for Democratic Action, the Gay and Lesbian Victory Fund, Greenpeace, the National Rainbow Coalition, and Zero Population Growth, are co-sponsors of the march.
 <p>	<li>As if to remove all doubt about the government-oriented nature of this event, one federal agency has even gotten into the act directly.  The Agriculture Department's $932 million Cooperative State Research, Education and Extension Service has signed on as a national endorser of the Stand For Children under the guise of its outreach program, Families 4H and Nutrition. Also, the Freddie Mac Foundation, an arm of the federally chartered Freddie Mac Corp., has signed on to the march.
</ul>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	In short, the Stand For Children is yet another a venue for groups that live off the taxpayer to lobby for more money. It is common practice for such organizations to use sympathetic symbols -- yes, even children -- as a "cloaking device" for efforts to expand big government and the welfare state. The fact that few Americans can believe anyone would be so cynical only makes the "cloaking" that much easier. In this case, they want to present their rally as a spontaneous, non-partisan, grassroots expression of altruism towards America's youth. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Unfortunately, nothing could be further from the truth.

<title>How Much Is $1.6 Trillion - Heritage Commentary</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><center><h3>HOW MUCH IS $1.6 TRILLION?</h3>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/mason.htm">David Mason</a><br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
April 25, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	With six kids and a single income, I am probably more aware than most where my paycheck goes. One thing I know for sure is that too much goes to government.
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The federal government this year -- despite the much-ballyhooed "cuts" the Washington establishment has been bemoaning -- will spend some $1.6 trillion. The House of Representatives will begin debating spending targets for fiscal year 1997 during the first week of May. Make no mistake: Overall spending will go up, not down.  
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Even though I have worked in the nation's capital for more than a dozen years, eight of them on Capitol Hill, two at the Pentagon, and six at The Heritage Foundation, where we routinely analyze programs costing tens of billions of dollars, I don't have the faintest idea how much $1.6 trillion really is. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	For most of us, even a million is incomprehensible. Have you ever tried to count to a million? Think about it: If you counted non-stop without eating or sleeping it would take approximately 23 days to count to a million. To count to a billion literally would take a lifetime: 95 years. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Counting to a trillion, assuming we get started right away and don't waste any time, would take about 2,000 centuries -- 200,000 years.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Most of us can at least imagine counting for 23 days. A period of 2,000 centuries, on the other hand, is beyond human understanding. As is a trillion dollars.
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Of course, government doesn't just count money, it spends it -- and it does so at a phenomenal rate: $4.5 billion a day. Enough to support my family and quite a few others for a very long time.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	A lot of the money government spends is borrowed, more than half-a-million dollars per minute, $32 million an hour, or $768 million a day. This borrowed money gets added to the national debt.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Despite two very costly world wars, it took from the beginning of the American Republic until 1982 -- more than 200 years -- to amass the first $1 trillion in debt. By February 1996, however, the debt exceeded $5 trillion. On April 19, when I last checked, the "national debt clock" on the Internet stood at $5,147,684,202,607.46. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	That's five trillion, 147 billion, 684 million, 202 thousand, 607 dollars and 46 cents: More than $19,450 for every man, woman and child in the United States, a whopping $155,000 for the Mason family -- enough to purchase a new house and pay a year's worth of college tuition, with money left over.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The story doesn't end here, however. Unless something drastic happens, government spending and borrowing will get worse. Under the current budget, annual government spending will increase to $2 trillion by the year 2002 -- just six years down the road. The debt also will increase: by approximately $150 billion per year.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Moreover, this spending spree is now largely on autopilot. The cost of mandatory "entitlement" programs like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, already the largest portion of the budget, will increase 63 percent by the year 2002, while interest payments on the national debt will increase 16 percent. The remainder of the budget, meanwhile --  for national defense, law enforcement, environmental cleanup, maintenance of U.S. ports and parks and everything else -- will grow a relatively modest 14 percent.
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Unchecked, this crowding-out effect would reach its destructive conclusion in 2010 -- the year my seven-year-old reaches the age of 21 -- when entitlement spending and interest on the national debt will consume 100 percent of the federal budget.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The next time somebody says government spending needs to be brought under control you'll know why. If you forget, just start counting. I'm sure you'll remember long before you reach 5 trillion, 147 billion.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
