<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
The Heart: The Engine of Life is easy to use. All the instructions you will need to run the
program are in this Introduction. The rest of this Program Guide has hints to help
you better appreciate the program plus background information on healthy heart
function and heart disease.
<p>
The Heart: The Engine of Life is broken into 12 Units. You might find it helpful to read the
description of each Unit in this Program Guide before starting that Unit on the
computer. The Units are easier to understand if you look at them in
order.
<p>
<h3>INSTALLING AND STARTING THE PROGRAM</h3>
<p>
The Heart: The Engine of Life is distributed in one large "zip"
file, which means that all the information is compressed and collected 
into a single file for downloading.  The file name is THEHEART.ZIP and
it includes three versions of the program for three possible screen
resolutions.  To run it, you will also need an animation 'engine'
called P11RUN.EXE.  P11RUN.EXE is available worldwide in a file
called P11STUFF.ZIP.
<p>
THE HEART: THE ENGINE OF LIFE must be installed on your hard drive or 
on a floppy disk before it can be used.  Use PKUNZIP to decompress the 
program.  When you use PKUNZIP, you MUST use the parameters \ and -d 
because doing so will place the program in the \P11 directory, and in 
the subdirectory \P11\HEART.  
<p>
There are over 200 individual files comprising animations, text,
computer instructions, and sound effects in three screen modes. 
Therefore, we have organized everything under the \P11 directory and
have been doing so since 1984.  It may be placed on any drive but
must be in the \P11 directory.  Using PKUNZIP with the \ and -d
options will ensure the proper installation of THE HEART: THE ENGINE
OF LIFE on your system.
<p>
The format for PKUNZIP is:
<code> PKUNZIP.EXE  THEHEART.ZIP  d:/  -d</code>
<p>
where d: can be any drive (A: through Z:) or not be included.  The /
(foward slash) and -d (dash d) must be included to cause PKUNZIP to
create the directory structure.  This would unzip the complete
program.  
<p>
P11STUFF.ZIP is unzipped the same way and will place P11RUN.EXE in
the \P11 directory when it is finished.  TO unzip P11STUFF, use this:
<p>
<code> PKUNZIP.EXE  P11STUFF.ZIP  d:/  -d</code>
<p>
After installing The Heart: The Engine of Life it will be placed in 
a directory called \P11 on your hard drive. Go to the \P11 path.  
The DOS command to do that is:
<p>
<code>CD \P11)</code>
<p>
and type 
<p>
<code>RUN HEART</code>
<p>
This will run the RUN.BAT batch file from the \P11 directory, which
will actually start the program by running another batch file,
HEART.BAT, from the \P11\HEART directory.  HEART.BAT in turn runs
P11RUN.EXE, which is a universal animation engine.  For more
information about the animation engine that runs The Heart: The
Engine of Life, please visit our web site:
<p>
<code>http://www.animatedsoftware.com</code>
<p>
The program will automatically choose the highest of three screen
resolutions that it can run on your computer.  If you feel it has
chosen poorly, follow the instructions that appear on the <i>very
first screen</i> when you execute the RUN.BAT batch file.
<p>
When running the program you can exit at any time by
first pressing the <b>ESCAPE</b> key and then answering <b>Y</b> ( or
<b>y</b>) to the screen prompt that will appear.  <b>alt-q</b> (hold
the ALT key down and then while holding it down, pressing the Q key) will
also exit the program immediately.
<p>
There are three versions of The Heart: The Engine of Life.
The highest resolution version is 1024 by 768 dots and 256
colors, called SVGA mode 261.  The middle version is MCGA, which is
320 by 200 dots and 256 colors.  The low resolution version should run
on original 8088 IBM computers, and is 320 by 200 dots and 4 colors. 
Other than the loss of some color detail and/or some resolution
detail, the three versions are virtually identical.
<p>
After installation you can delete the \P11\HEART\CGAHEART path to
delete the CGA version or delete the \P11\HEART\MCGAHART path to delete the
VGA version, or delete the \P11\HEART\SVGAHART path to delete the
SVGA version, once you know which one your computer can use. 
However, we suggest you not do this, since sometimes adding new
hardware or software upgrades can cause the program not to run, at
least temporarily until you fully install something new.  Therefore,
we suggest you keep all three versions available so that the program
will probably always be there in one form or another when you want to
use it or show it to somebody.  Of course, you could always reinstall
it if you need to.
<p>
We urge you to make personal backup copies of the original ZIP file or
disks immediately. For your convenience they are not "copyprotected". 
<p>
<h4>
THE KEYBOARD
</h4>
<p>
The location and functions of the keys used in The Heart: The Engine of Life are shown in
Figure 1. When the program asks you to answer a question by pressing a number,
it is best to use the number keys at the top of the keyboard instead of those on the
numeric key pad, which are reserved for moving the cursor around the screen. (You
may use the numeric key pact by pressing NUMLOCK first, but then you will need
to press NUMLOCK again before using these keys to move your cursor.) The 
mouse can also be used for moving things around in many cases, but not all.
<p>
<IMG ALIGN=ABSBOTTOM SRC="hrtsmkey.gif" ALT="Image of Keyboard">
<p>
<b>Figure 1.</b>  
<i>Keys used in The Heart: The Engine of Life. The configuration of your keyboard may differ.
(The Function Keys are usuall above along the top, for instance.) 
<b>A:</b> Function
keys <b>F1</b>, <b>F2</b>, and <b>F3</b> are used throughout the program but only with onscreen prompts. At the
main menu, <b>F1</b> will give you a summary of operating instructions.
<b>B:</b> <b>F10</b> returns you to the
main menu.
<b>C:</b> <b>ESCAPE</b> (or <b>ALT-Q</b>) are used to exit the program.
<b>D:</b> The number keys
are used to answer questions and
to speed the action In Unit 4, The Broken Heart. <b>E:</b> The space bar, used only with on-screen
prompts. <b>F:</b> The <b>ENTER</b> key, used to confirm answers and advance the screen.
<b>G:</b> The cursor keys, used for a variety of tasks throughout the program.</i>
<p>
<h4>
THE MENU
</h4>
<p>
Figure 2 (below) shows The Heart: The Engine of Life main menu. In order to get into any of the program's
12 Units, you need to be at this menu. Press the number of the Unit you want to
see and then press <b>ENTER</b>. When you have viewed a Unit, the number of that
Unit will be highlighted when you return to the menu. This is to help you
keep track of what you've looked at and doesn't prevent you from getting into a
Unit twice or as many times as you'd like. When you are at the menu, press
<b>F1</b>
to get a summary of the operating instructions contained in this Introduction.
<p>
<h4>
GETTING TO THE MENU
</h4>
<p>
You can get back to the menu at any time from any Unit by pressing
<b>F10</b>. Use
<b>F10</b> when you're in the middle of one Unit and you want to leave it to go to another
Unit. When you want to take a second look at the beginning screens of a Unit which
you've already entered, press <b>F10</b> to get back to the menu and then reselect the
Unit you just left.  Although there are no "page up" or backspace capabilities 
in the program, each unit is relatively short.  
Other keys, such as <b>F1</b> and <b>ENTER</b>, can sometimes be used
to get back to the menu. When this is the case, you'll see instructions displayed on
the screen.
<p>
<h4>
EXITING THE PROGRAM
</h4>
<p>
To exit The Heart: The Engine of Life at any time, press <b>ESCAPE</b>. You will be asked first if
you are certain you want to exit. Press "<b>Y</b>" if you do and "<b>N</b>" 
if you don't want to
exit. If you press <b>ESCAPE</b>, you will be asked to press "<b>C</b>" 
to confirm your decision. "<b>C</b>" returns you to your machine's DOS. 
Alternatively, you can use <b>Alt-Q</b> to exit immediately to DOS.

<h2>THE HEART: THE ENGINE OF LIFE</h2>
<p>
It is easy to forget how miraculous the human heart is. Hidden safely in the middle
of your chest, protected by your breastbone in front and your backbone in the rear,
the fist-sized muscle of your heart performs its constant labor unnoticed except in
moments of exertion or excitement. The more you consider the heart's prodigious
task, the more you will appreciate the wonder that beats within you.
<p>
The Heart: The Engine Of Life will show you the heart from a fresh perspective. 
These notes may help you to better understand some features of each Unit, but you may
enjoy it more if you view it first without reading these notes, and then view it again
after you have read them or while reading them.  We do not suggest you read 
each Unit in this text <i>prior</i> to viewing each unit.
<p>
<h4>GOOD TO KNOW:</h4>
<p>
<ul>
<li>
Our imaginary island, "Humania", has a "Fuel Transport System" which is a 
good approximation of the body's
circulatory system. The arteries are shown in red on the top half of the body
and the veins are shown in blue on the bottom half. Notice when the system
is animated how all the "fuel" in the arteries moves away from the pump
and all the fuel in the veins moves toward it.
<p>
<li>
The red color of blood is due to its oxygen content. Notice in the capillary
net how the blood cells change from red to blue. This is because the blood
gives up some of its oxygen to feed the cells as it passes through the
capillaries. When you look at the veins in the back of your hand or wrist,
you can see that the blood has a bluish tinge because it has already carried
oxygen to your hand. Blood outside the body is always red because it
immediately picks up oxygen from the air.
</ul>

<h2>THE HEART ANATOMY TUTORIAL</h2>
<p>
Although it sustains the immensely complex systems of the body, the heart itself
is a simple organ. It is, in essence, a hollow pear-shaped muscle divided into four
chambers. Each side of the heart has an upper chamber called an <i>atrium</i>, and a
lower chamber called a <i>ventricle</i>.
<p>
Blood flows into each atrium through a number of <i>veins</i>. From there, it 
flows into the ventricles and out of the heart through the <i>arteries</i>. 
There is a <i>value</i> between
each atrium and ventricle and between each ventricle and artery--four valves in all.
These valves only open in one direction to make sure that your blood keeps flowing
in one direction.
<p>
The flow of blood through the heart is covered in Unit 5, <b>The Heartbeat Tutorial</b>.
To prepare for that Unit, you should be able to identify and name:
<ul>
<li>1.) The <b>veins</b> which carry blood into the right or left side of the heart.
<li>2.) The four <b>chambers</b> which contract to keep blood moving through the
heart.
<li>3.) The four <b>valves</b>, which open only one way to keep the blood moving
in the right direction.
<li>4.) The <b>arteries</b>, which carry blood away from the heart.
</ul>
In <b>The Heart Anatomy Tutorial</b>, you learn the names of these important areas
by moving your cursor around a picture of the heart and asking each piece to
identify itself (see the instructions on the screen). Stay in this Unit for as long as
you Like.
<p>
<h4>GOOD TO KNOW:</h4>
<p>
<ul>
<li>
If you get a message saying "POSITION NOT RECOGNIZED. TRY AGAIN,"  
you are in an area that is too close to the border between two
different parts of the heart for the computer to decide which one you want
to identify. Move your cursor to a more distinct part to get a clear
identification.
<p>
<li>
<i>Pulmonary</i> means of or pertaining to the lungs. The pulmonary arteries
carry <i>deoxygenated</i> blood (blood which has little oxygen) to the lungs
where it picks up oxygen and releases carbon dioxide. The pulmonary
veins carry <i>oxygenated</i> blood (blood rich in oxygen) back to the heart so
that it can be pumped to the rest of the body.
<p>
<li>
The heart is the only area of the body where you find veins carrying blood
that is oxygenated and arteries carrying blood that is deoxygenated. Don't
let this confuse you. Just remember that veins carry blood to the heart and
arteries carry blood away from the heart.
<p>
<li>
The <i>mitral valve</i> got its name because it resembles a miter, a hat worn
by bishops. It is also referred to as the <i>bicuspid</i> valve, because it has two
cusps or folds of tissue that open and close. The <i>tricuspid</i> valve has three
cusps. The two valves together are known as the <i>atrioventricular</i> valves
because They lie between the atria and the ventricles.
<p>
<li>
The atria are sometimes referred to as auricles.
</ul>

<h2>THE HEART ANATOMY QUIZ</h2>
<p>
Here is your chance to see how well you've learned basic heart anatomy. The
cursor moves in random order to each area that was identified in <b>The Heart
Anatomy Tutorial</b>. When the cursor stops, three names will be given. You must
select the correct name. At the end of the quiz, you'll be told how well you
performed. If you get more than five questions wrong, you may want to try the quiz
again or return to <b>The Heart Anatomy Tutorial</b> for more study.
<p>
<h4>GOOD TO KNOW:</h4>
<p>
<ul>
<li>
TAKE YOUR TIME! The names of some parts of the heart are very similar
and it's easy to leap at the wrong answer.
<p>
<li>
You must press <b>ENTER</b> to confirm your answer. If you accidentally press
the wrong number, use the backspace key to delete it.
</ul>

<h2>THE BROKEN HEART</h2>
<p>
This Unit tests your knowledge of the heart's anatomy and your skill at solving
puzzles. You meet Harvey Hardluck, an unfortunate man whose heart has broken
into pieces. These pieces correspond to the chambers, valves and blood vessels
used in <b>The Heart Anatomy Quiz</b>. Use your cursor keys to put Harvey's heart
back together. If you succeed, a brighter, happier Harvey will return to thank you.
<p>
<h4>GOOD TO KNOW:</h4>
<p>
<ul>
<li>
BE PRECISE! As in all forms of delicate surgery, close is not good enough.
You must place the piece <i>exactly</i> where it belongs. 
You can use the mouse to move the piece close to the proper location, 
then use the arrow keys on the keyboard to place them <i>exactly</i>.
The outline of the puzzle
and the outlines of the various pieces will help you to maneuver each piece
into its correct position. One clue: The pieces change color as they move
over other pieces. If you see two colors overlapping to create a third color,
then you know the piece isn't in place. If you see black between two pieces
that should fit right together, that's another sign that the piece is still out
of place.  
<p>
<li>
You don't have to select pieces in the order in which they're listed.
However, as in any jigsaw puzzle, it's hard if not impossible to know where
a piece should go if it's not along a border or connected to another piece
already in place. Use logic. Don't start out with a valve--you'll just be
guessing.
<p>
<li>
If you're wrong three straight times in guessing where a piece should be
placed, the program will make you try a new piece. The piece you failed
to place will be unavailable until you have placed another piece in
position.
<p>
<li>
You might want to time yourself and compare your speed with the time your
friends take to get Harvey's heart back together.
<p>
<li>
You can use the NUMBER keys to speed the movement. The cursor will
move up to ten spaces at a time, depending on what number you have
pressed. To use this feature, press a number key to set your speed (<b>1</b>
through <b>10</b>). When you're close to the exact location, press 
the <i>1</i> key and place the piece exactly.
<p>
<li>
If you're having a lot of trouble placing a piece, press 
Function Key 5 (<b>F5</b>) to automatically
put the piece in the correct position.
</ul>

<h2>THE HEARTBEAT TUTORIAL</h2>
<p>
The sequence of events that occurs with each heartbeat is known as the <i>cardiac
cycle</i>. <b>The Heartbeat Tutorial</b> describes the cardiac cycle in detail. At the end
of this Unit, you can use your cursor keys to control the rate of a beating heart.
<p>
<h4>GOOD TO KNOW:</h4>
<p>
<ul>
<li>
Once you have gone through the cardiac cycle once, you can use Function Key 3 (<b>F3</b>)
key to animate the heartbeat. However, once you start the animation
sequence, you can't return to the step by step description of the heartbeat
unless you return to the main menu and select this Unit again.
<p>
<li>
Frequently, pictures showing the flow of blood through the heart show the
heart as though it is empty after each beat and then fills up before beating
again. Actually, the heart is always full. Although the amount of blood in
the heart varies at each stage of the cardiac cycle, <i>there is never empty
space or air</i>. If even a small bubble of air is introduced into the circulatory
system, it can cause severe damage to the body, even death, by causing
blood vessels to burst.
<p>
<li>
Blood going into the lungs through the pulmonary arteries travels through
smaller end smaller blood vessels until it reaches the <i>pulmonary capillaries</i>
(see Figure 4). The pulmonary capillaries cover microscopic air sacs, called
<i>alveoli</i>, at the ends of the bronchiole tubes. The walls of the alveoli and the
capillaries are very thin, thin enough to allow gases to pass through them.
Oxygen in the alveoli passes into the capillaries and is picked up by red
blood cells. The red blood cells in the capillaries release carbon dioxide
which passes into the alveoli and is exhaled. Oxygenated blood then flows
back toward the heart through larger and larger veins until it reaches the
right or left branches of the pulmonary arteries and the left atrium.
<p>
<li>
The valves of the heart are entirely passive. They open and close only in
response to the pressure of blood pushing up against them. There are
muscles attached to the atrioventricular valves called <i>papillary muscles</i>, but
these do not push the valves shut. Rather, they keep the valves from being
pushed back into the atria during ventricular contraction.
<p>
<li>
Your <i>heart rate</i>, the speed at which your heart beats, depends on a variety
of factors including age, sex, physical and mental activity, and health.
During exercise, when the body's demand for oxygen rises sharply, your
heart may beat at a rate as high as 180 to 200 beats per minute. When
you are frightened or excited, your body releases a hormone called
<i>adrenaline</i> which causes your heart to beat faster and harder to prepare you
for strenuous activity--the "fight or flight" response. Your <i>resting heart
rate</i> is tire rate at which your heart beats when you're physically and
mentally relaxed. Normal resting heart rates are very high in infants,
ranging from 100 to 160 beats per minute. Normal resting rates decline
steadily with age, reaching a low range of from 60 to 100 beats per minute
by the age of 20. Trained athletes may have resting rates as low as 40
because their hearts are strong and pump so much blood with each beat that
they don't need to beat as often.
<p>
<li>
The portion of the cardiac cycle during which your heart muscle is
contracting is called <i>systole</i>. The portion of the cycle when it is relaxed and
filling with blood is called <i>diastole</i>.
</ul>
<p>
<IMG ALIGN=ABSBOTTOM SRC="hrtsmlng.gif" ALT="Alveoli">
<p>
<b>Figure 4</b>. <i>Respiration. Blood flowing from the heart to the lungs  (A) eventually reaches the capillaries
that cover the aveoli, or air sacs, of the lungs (B). Red blood calls traveling through these
capillaries (C) pick up oxygen from the alveoli and release carbon dioxide, which is then
exhaled.</i>

<a name="unit_spark"></a>
<h2>THE HEART'S SELF-GENERATING SPARK</h2>
<p>
Take your hand and start opening and closing it. Keep on doing this again and
again as though you were trying to crack a walnut. How long do you think you could
keep it up before your hand was too tired to work? Five minutes? Ten? Fifteen
at most? Consider, then, that your heart is working even harder than your hand
and will continue to work at this pace for as long as you live. Why is it that the heart
can exert such strenuous effort without resting for even a few seconds? The answer
lies in the special nature of cardiac muscle.
<p>
There are three types of muscle in the human body. <i>Smooth muscle</i> is found in
the linings of the digestive tract and blood vessels. The smooth muscles are
controlled by parts of your nervous system which you cannot consciously control.
<i>Skeletal muscle</i>, such as the muscle found in your arms and legs, can in most cases
be voluntarily controlled. Skeletal muscle is more able to perform fast and
strenuous work than smooth muscle. The third type of muscle is <i>cardiac muscle</i>,
the muscle which forms your heart. Cardiac muscle is similar in structure and power
to skeletal muscle, but like smooth muscle, it cannot be consciously controlled.
<p>
Unlike smooth muscle, cardiac muscle can contract without any signal from the
nervous system. Although the brain sends the heart messages to speed up or slow
down, the heart will continue to beat if all connections to the nervous system are
cut, provided it has a sufficient supply of oxygen and nutrients.
<p>
How does the heart beat all by itself? The answer lies within the smallest building
blocks of the human body--individual atoms. In an atom, the number of negative
particles (electrons) is equal to the number of positive particles (protons). When all
the particles are in place, the negative charge and the positive charge cancel out
each other and the atom as a whole has no charge. However, when an electron
is pulled away from the atom, the atom has more protons than electrons and a net
positive charge. Atoms which have an electrical charge are called <i>ions</i>.
<p>
Heart muscle cells contain positive ions of potassium, sodium and calcium. The
<i>membrane</i>, or wall, of each heart muscle cell has a natural tendency to "pump"
sodium and calcium ions out of the cell and pump potassium ions in. It pumps
sodium and calcium ions out at faster rate than it can pump potassium ions in.
Eventually, there are a lot more ions outside the cell than there are inside. Although
the cell has a positive charge, <i>it has a negative charge relative to its outside
surroundings</i>. The cell is <i>polarized</i>.
<p>
When the relatively positive charge outside the cell becomes too large, the flow of
ions suddenly reverses. Potassium ions rush out of the cell as sodium and
calcium ions rush in. The relatively positive charge is now <i>inside</i> the cell and the
cell is said to be <i>depolarized</i>. An imbalance exists once again, and that imbalance
is corrected when the cell resumes its tendency to pump potassium ions in and
sodium and calcium ions out. The cell is soon <i>repolarized</i>, and will stay that way
until the positive charge outside the cell again reaches a threshold and the flow once
again reverses. Every time this reversal of flow occurs, it generates a spark of
electricity which races through the heart. <i>It Is this electrical spark that causes
heart cells to contract and the heart to beat.</i>
<p>
<b>The Heart's Self-Generating Spark</b> is a graphic representation of minuscule
events which power the engine of Life.
<p>
<h4>GOOD TO KNOW:</h4>
<p>
<ul>
<li>
Depolarization corresponds roughly with systole and repolarization occurs
towards the end of systole and the beginning of diastole.
<p>
<li>
There is never actually a moment in the cardiac cycle when all the potassium
in the heart is within the muscle cells and all the sodium and calcium is
outside the cell (or vice versa).
<p>
<li>
A single heart cell, placed in a laboratory dish with oxygen and nutrition to
sustain it, will beat.
</ul>

<a name="unit_conducting"></a>
<h2>THE CONDUCTING SYSTEM</h2>
<p>
All the muscle cells in the heart have the ability to depolarize and start a wave of
contraction spreading out in all directions. However, if all the cells in the heart were
to "beat" at their own rate, the heart as a whole would quiver in a disorganized and
useless manner. To beat effectively, the heart needs order and rhythm, and both
these qualities are provided by the <i>conducting system</i>.
<p>
The conducting system consists of a network of specialized heart muscle cells that
function in a way similar to nerve cells. The function of the conducting system is
to 1) generate the electrical impulse which starts the cardiac cycle and 2) see that
the impulse spreads in an organized and rapid manner throughout the heart.
<p>
<b>The Conducting System</b> details the anatomy and function of the heart's
electrical network. You will need to be very familiar with this Unit if you wish to
attempt Unit 9--<b>Putting It All Together</b>.
<p>
<h4>GOOD TO KNOW:</h4>
<p>
<ul>
<li>
The <i>atrioventricular bundle</i> (AV bundle) is also known as the bundle of His
in honor of the man who discovered it.
<p>
<li>
The impulse generated by the conducting system reaches every muscle cell
in the heart and not just the cells of the conducting system itself. The
conducting system guides the spread of the impulse through the heart so
that every cell in the heart receives its signal to contract at just the right
instant.
<p>
<li>
The spread of the cardiac impulse through the heart shown in the program
corresponds closely to the actual path and timing of the impulse generated
by your heart, except it has been slowed down. In your heart, the impulse
generated by the <i>SA node</i> reaches the right edge of the left atrium in .03
seconds. It reaches the <i>AV node</i> in .04 seconds and the far edge of the left
atrium in .09 seconds. The impulse is delayed for more than .10 seconds
in the AV node, reaching the AV bundle .16 seconds after leaving the SA
node. From that point on, progress is extremely rapid. One-hundreth of
a second hater, the impulse reaches the <i>apex</i> of the ventricle and 
two-hundreths of a second later, It has spread up to the tops of the ventricles.
The impulse finally reaches the outer edge of the ventricular muscle mass
.22 seconds after it was generated.
<p>
<li>
The SA node is called the <i>pacemaker</i> because it depolarizes at a faster rate
than any other group of cells in the heart and imposes that faster rate on
the heart as a whole. If for any reason the SA node stops beating, the AV
node, which has the next fastest rate of depolarization, would become the
heart's pacemaker. If the AV node failed, the AV bundle would take over.
If it failed, the <i>Purkinje fibers</i> would start the heartbeat and if 
they failed as well,
a group of cells somewhere else in the heart would start pulsing. However,
the further away the heart gets from its normal pattern and rate of beating,
the less blood it pumps and receives, until eventually, it can no longer
sustain Life.
<p>
<li>
Disturbances in the heart's normal rhythm, known as <i>arrhythmias</i>, are one
of the most common forms of heart disease. Arrhythmias can be minor and
unimportant or severe and life threatening. There are many different kinds
of arrhythmias, including:
<ul>
<li><b>Tachycardia</b>, an abnormally fast heartbeat.
<li><b>Bradycardia</b>, an abnormally slow heart beat.
<li><b>Heart block</b>, which occurs when the electrical impulse has difficulty
passing through the AV node.
<li><b>Atrial flutter</b>, in which the atria contracts at rates of up to 180 beats
a minute.
<li><b>Ventricular fibrillation</b>, in which the ventricles contract in an irregular
and ineffective way, a condition which quickly leads to death unless
corrected.
</ul>
<li>
People who have serious arrhythmias can sometimes have an artificial
pacemaker implanted in their chests or abdomens. This battery powered
device delivers a rythmic electrical impulse to the heart on either a constant
basis or only when the heart's natural pacemaker temporarily fails to sustain
a normal beat.

<h2>THE EKG</h2>
<p>
The <i>electrocardiograph</i> (EKG) is a machine that measures and records the
electrical activity of the heart. It is one of the most important tools doctors have
for diagnosing the health of the heart.
<p>
When an EKG is recorded, <i>leads</i> (electrodes--devices which can detect electricity)
are placed on the chest, the right and left wrists and the left ankle. The leads are
connected to the electrocardiograph which measures the positive and negative
currents detected by each lead and records the results as tracings on graph paper.
As many as twelve different leads may be used to gain different perspectives on how
the heart is functioning. An abnormality in the heart muscle or conducting system
may appear on the tracing of one lead yet not be detected by other leads. The
interpretation of EKG's is a skill which requires long study to learn.
<p>
<b>The EKG</b> describes the basic structure of an electrocardiogram and how each wave
in an EKG relates to events in the cardiac cycle. You must be familiar with the
information in this Unit if you wish to attempt the extra-credit exercise in Unit 9.
<p>
<h4>GOOD TO KNOW:</h4>
<p>
<ul>
<li>
The EKG pattern shown in this Unit is just one of the twelve different
patterns that can be obtained by using different leads. It is the pattern most
commonly used to demonstrate the principles of electrocardiography.
<p>
<li>
The first accurate electrocardiograph was designed by the Dutch physician
Willem Einthoven at the turn of the 20th Century. It used magnifying cameras
to record vibrations in a quartz filament which was attached to electrodes
strapped to a patient. Einthoven's EKG machine filled two rooms and needed
five people to operate it--a far cry from today's 30 lb. briefcase-sized
models. Still, this first EKG was so significant an achievement that it earned
Einthoven the Nobel prize in 1924.
<p>
<li>
The <i>QRS wave</i> is also know as the QRS complex. It is actually comprised
of three separate waves, the Q wave, the R wave and the S wave.
<li>
On some EKG's, a <i>U wave</i> can be seen. The U wave is small (it reflects a
small amount of electrical current) and occurs after the T wave and before
the P wave. It is caused by the repolarization of the papillary muscles which
are less conductive than normal heart muscle.

<h2>PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER</h2>
<p>
All your knowledge of the heart is tested in this Unit. You are asked to
integrate information about the heartbeat, the conducting system and the EKG
into a complete understanding of the cardiac cycle. <b>Putting It All Together</b>
is not a test or quiz but an exercise designed to improve your understanding of
the cardiac cycle. In the previous Units, you looked at the heart from one or
two different perspectives. In this Unit, you look at the heart from three
perspectives, comparing each to each.
<p>
<ul>This is how <b>Putting It All Together</b> works:
<li>1. Look at the pictures as they come onto the screen. The conducting
system is shown first, followed by the EKG and the beating heart. Each
picture will run through the cardiac cycle once before stopping. <i>Two
will stop at the same point in the cycle and one will stop at a
different point</i>.
<li>2.  Press the number of the picture that is at a stage in the cardiac cycle
which is <i>different from the stage of the other two</i>. (You don't need
to confirm your answer by pressing <b>ENTER</b>.)
<li>3. When you have selected the correct picture, it will start to move. When
it has moved to the same stage in the cardiac cycle as the other two
pictures, press the <b>SPACE BAR</b> to stop it. If you stop it at the wrong
stage, just press the <b>SPACE BAR</b> again and it will start moving. You
may stop and start the picture in this way as many times as you like.
<li>4. When you have stopped at the correct spot, press <b>ENTER</b> to confirm
your answer. If your answer is correct, press the <b>SPACE BAR</b> to move
on to the next question. If your answer is incorrect, press the <b>SPACE
BAR</b> to try again or press the "<b>?</b>" key to learn the correct answer.
</ul>
<p>
<h4>GOOD TO KNOW:</h4>
<p>
<ul>
<li>
There is a moment between the end of repolarization and the
firing of the SA node when the conducting system graphic is blank.
<li>
When you are trying to stop a picture at the correct stage in the cardiac
cycle, be as precise as you can be. You don't have to be exact and stop
the picture on one particular dot. There are a series of correct
positions for each question.

<h2>THE HEART ATTACK</h2>
<p>
The heart is the hardest working part of your body. Because it does more work than
any other muscle, it needs more oxygen and nutrients. Approximately five percent
of the blood the heart pumps is used to nourish the heart itself.
<p>
The heart supplies itself with blood through the coronary arteries. Two main
arteries, the right and left coronary arteries, branch off from the aorta just above
the aortic valve. These divide into smaller and smaller arteries that circle and
penetrate the heart, eventually reaching every one of the heart's muscle cells.
Because they are the heart's lifeline, the coronary arteries are also the body's
lifeline. When they become damaged, serious illness or death may result.
<p>
The most common disease to effect the coronary arteries is <i>atherosclerosis</i>,
commonly known as hardening of the arteries. Atherosclerosis occurs when the
inner wall of an artery becomes damaged, and fats such as cholesterol get inside
the artery walls. As the fat accumulates and hardens, there is less room for blood
to flow through the artery. <b>The Heart Attack</b> shows what can happen when the
coronary arteries become so damaged that the heart muscle can no longer receive
a sufficient supply of blood.
<p>
<h4>GOOD TO KNOW:</h4>
<p>
<ul>
<li>
Atherosclerosis can affect any area in the body. When it strikes the heart,
it is called <i>coronary artery disease</i>. When it strikes the blood vessels which
serve the brain, it may result in a <i>stroke</i>, a loss of brain function due to a
cutoff in the brain's oxygen supply. Strokes may be mild, severe or fatal.
The aftereffects of a stroke depend on which area of the brain suffers the
loss of oxygen and for how long. Symptoms include paralysis, loss or
slurring of speech, partial or complete loss of sight, and memory loss.
Factors which influence the development of atherosclerosis and coronary
artery disease are discussed in <b>The Heart Risk Factor Lab</b>.
<p>
<li>
People at risk for heart attacks frequently experience chest pain known as
<i>angina pectoris</i> ("pain in the chest"). Angina attacks occur when a portion
of the heart muscle is not receiving enough oxygen. The typical attack lasts
from one to ten minutes and is usually brought on by exercise, emotional
stress, overeating, or any activity which causes the heart's demand for
oxygen to increase beyond the ability of the narrowed coronary arteries to
deliver it. The angina pain subsides with rest. The crucial distinction
between an angina attack and a heart
attack is that in a heart attack, the reduction in blood flow is so acute or
prolonged that heart muscle cells die.
<p>
<li>
The capacity of the coronary arteries to carry blood must be reduced to 30
to 40 percent of normal before angina symptoms appear.
<p>
<li>
Even if as much as 25 percent of the left ventricle's muscle dies in a heart
attack, the heart may still be able to recover.
<p>
<li>
The severity of a heart attack depends on the size of the <i>infarction</i> (dead
tissue) and its location. Death may result from a variety of causes. If the
conducting system is damaged, the heart may go into ventricular fibrillation,
a disorganized quivering of the heart muscle which leaves the heart unable
to pump enough blood to sustain life. If too much muscle is destroyed, the
heart may still beat but without sufficient force to meet the body's needs.
This condition is know as heart failure. If part of the heart is severely
damaged, this part may rupture and allow blood to flow out into the chest
cavity, a disaster which leads quickly to death. Approximately 15 to 25
percent of heart attacks are fatal. In over half of fatal heart attacks, the
victim does not reach a hospital in time to receive life-saving emergency
treatment.
<p>
<li>
After a nonfatal heart attack, the dead tissue turns into <i>scar tissue</i>, dense,
hard connective tissue that no longer beats or conducts electricity. If the
scar tissue is small enough and not located along the conducting system, the
heart may recover to normal or near normal strength. If the scar tissue is
large or located in an important area, it will reduce the effectiveness of the
heartbeat and may disrupt the heart's natural rhythm.

<a name="unit_bypass"></a>
<h2>THE BYPASS OPERATION</h2>
<p>
When x-rays of the coronary arteries show that these arteries are seriously blocked,
doctors may recommend a <i>coronary bypass operation</i>. In a bypass operation,
doctors 1) take a vein from the leg, 2) connect one end of this vein to the aorta, and
3) connect the other end of the vein to a spot beyond the blockage in the coronary
artery. The "new" vein bypasses the blockage and allows blood to reach the muscle
beyond it.
<p>
The operation was made possible by the development of the heart-lung machine.
The machine oxygenates the blood and keeps it moving during surgery so that the
heart can be momentarily stopped to allow surgeons to work on it. Heart bypass
surgery is only recommended when severe pain due to angina does not respond
well to medication or when a person has a very high risk of a heart attack due to
severely obstructed coronary arteries.
<p>
<h4>GOOD TO KNOW:</h4>
<p>
<ul>
<li>
Approximately 50,000 coronary bypass operations are performed each
year in the U.S.. Most of the patients receiving the operation require more
than one bypass graft. Eighty to 90 percent of the patients receiving this
operation have some or all of their angina pain relieved. The operation,
however, is not a cure for coronary artery disease. It will not stop other
arteries in the heart, or even the new arteries grafted onto the heart, from
developing new blockages.
<p>
<li>
Physicians are constantly searching for ways of treating coronary artery
disease that are less "invasive" than bypass surgery--techniques that don't
involve opening the patient's chest and operating directly on the heart. A
number of other procedures look promising. In one procedure called
<i>coronary angioplasty</i>, a deflated balloon is snaked into the coronary
arteries until it reaches an area where <i>plaque</i> (built-up fat) is blocking the
flow of blood. The balloon is then inflated and the plaque is flattened against
the wall of the artery, leaving more room for blood to pass. Doctors also
expect to soon be using lasers to destroy plaque. Experiments in animals
show that laser beams can be fired through a catheter inserted into the
coronary arteries to safely blast plaque away a little at a time.

<h2>THE HEART RISK FACTOR LAB</h2>
<p>
During the Korean War, doctors were surprised to find that the hearts of many
young men killed in battle had already begun to develop coronary artery disease.
Their discovery helps to illustrate that <i>you're never too young to start thinking
about the health of your heart and to start developing habits that will reduce
your risk of developing heart disease</i>. The health of your heart is a lifetime
responsibility. The best way to start accepting that responsibility is by becoming
more familiar with the factors that increase your risk of developing coronary artery
disease. That is the purpose of <b>The Heart Risk Factor Lab</b>.
<p>
<b>HEREDITY</b>. Heredity is an important factor in determining your likelihood of
developing coronary artery disease. Although nothing can be done about heredity,
it is very important to appreciate the risks of hereditary factors. If you know you're
at increased risk because heart disease runs in your family, you have all the more
reason to take steps to reduce other preventable risk factors.
<p>
<b>SMOKING</b>. Smoking is the largest preventable cause of death in America. Each
year, roughly 350,000 Americans die because they were smokers.  <i>The majority
of these deaths, two-thirds, are not due to cancer, but to heart disease.</i> If you
smoke, you have approximately five times as great a risk of dying of coronary heart
disease than if you don't smoke.
<p>
Smoking damages the heart in a number of ways. It makes a person far more likely
to develop coronary artery disease. It stimulates the development of blood clots
which can block narrowed or even healthy arteries, leading to strokes and heart
attacks. Cigarette smoke contains carbon monoxide which competes with oxygen
and reduces the amount of oxygen your blood can carry. This forces your heart
to work harder to pump more blood. Smoking may also cause blood vessels to go
into spasms, clamping shut and cutting off blood flow to the heart and other
essential organs.
<p>
<b>CHOLESTEROL</b>. The danger of cholesterol was first considered after World War
II. Doctors noticed that the rate of heart attacks decreased dramatically in areas
suffering shortages of food high in cholesterol--meat, eggs and cheese. After the
war, the number of heart attacks increased to prewar levels. A suspicion arose that
heart attacks may be caused in part by a diet high in fats. Studies since the war have
shown that people with high cholesterol levels definitely have more heart attacks
than people with low or normal levels.
<p>
Cholesterol causes heart attacks by accumulating in the walls of the coronary
arteries. Not everyone who eats foods rich In cholesterol develops high cholesterol
levels--more than 220 milligrams per deciliter (1/10 liter). Some people don't hold
on to cholesterol, no matter how much they eat, while others can get high
cholesterol levels from eating only moderate amounts of this fat. The good news
is that high cholesterol levels can be controlled by diet. A diet low in cholesterol
results in lower levels of cholesterol in the blood and decreases the risk of coronary
artery disease.
<p>
<b>WEIGHT</b>. Statistics show that people who are significantly overweight (more than
20 percent) have an increased risk of developing coronary artery disease. Excess
weight puts excess strain on the heart. It has been estimated that for each additional
pound a person gains, the body must build 200 more miles of blood vessels to
nourish the additional tissue. The extra weight also increases the risk of developing
high blood pressure which is another risk factor (see below).
<p>
<b>PERSONALITY</b>. Many doctors now believe that personality traits can influence
the likelihood of developing coronary artery disease. Researchers have noticed that
a certain type of individual, called a <i>Type A</i> person, is more likely to develop
coronary artery disease than another type of individual, called a <i>Type B</i> person.
<p>
Type A people constantly feel under pressure. They are always in a rush, always
thinking about what they have to do next, always pushing themselves. They find
it difficult to relax either physically or mentally. Type B people have a more relaxed
attitude and take life in stride. They are not apt to rush, or rather, to feel rushed
and they are generally satisfied with life. The principle difference between Type
A and Type B people has nothing to do with accomplishments or productivity. It
has to do with attitude, how they feel about life and how they approach it.
<p>
<b>BLOOD PRESSURE</b>. Blood pressure is the amount of force your blood exerts
against the walls of your arteries. It is usually expressed by two numbers e.g. 120/80, 
or 120 over 80--where the first number is a measurement of the pressure in
your arteries during systole and the second number is the pressure in your arteries
awing diastole. The systolic pressure is always higher than the diastolic pressure
because after each heartbeat, there is more blood in your arteries and therefore
more pressure.
<p>
High blood pressure, also called <i>hypertension</i>, occurs when pressure in the arteries
rises above normal levels. In general, anyone with blood pressure higher than 140/90 
is considered to have hypertension. Doctors aren't sure what causes high blood
pressure, but they do know that people who have it also have an increased risk of
developing heart disease and having strokes. Some studies show that people with
high blood pressure have two or more times the risk of having a heart attack. The
reason for this increased risk is not yet known, although some doctors believe that
the increased pressure damages the arterial walls and leads to atherosclerosis. High
blood pressure can be controlled in most patients by reducing salt intake, losing
weight if necessary, and taking medications.
<p>
<h4>GOOD TO KNOW:</h4>
<p>
<ul>
<li>
Answer all questions as honestly as possible. Don't be tempted to give the
"right" response. The only right response is an accurate response.
<p>
<li>
When you press the <b>UP ARROW</b> key to record your height, you will see
a yellow line along the height markings. Hold the arrow down to
make the line move faster. Each press of the arrow moves the height up
by one-fifth of an inch, so you can be very precise. If you overshoot your
correct height, use the <b>DOWN ARROW</b> key to adjust your answer before
pressing <b>ENTER</b>. Likewise, when recording your weight, you'll see a
yellow line appear along the weight markings when you press the <b>RIGHT
ARROW</b>. Hold it down to make it go faster and use the <b>LEFT ARROW</b> to
make any corrections. Each press of these arrows changes the weight by
one pound.
<p>
<li>
There is some debate as to whether or not a person can be considered
overweight without being fat. Many athletes, for example, may be 30 to
40 percent over the desirable weight for their height yet have a lower
percent of body fat than many who aren't overweight.

<h1> How to unzip and install programs written with P11 </h1>
<hr>
<a href="/pics/icons/ascologo.gif"><IMG ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=10 WIDTH=32 HEIGHT=14 SRC="/pics/icons/ascolog1.gif" ALT=""></a>
<p>
All software written using <b>RUSSELL'S "P11" ANIMATION MACHINE</b> can be easily unzipped with PKUNZIP from PKWARE.  Use the -d and \ parameters, like this:
<br>
<CODE>PKUNZIP.EXE P11STUFF.ZIP \ -D</CODE>
<br>
<p>
The <b>-d</b> tells PKUNZIP to <b>recreate the directory structure</b> which
existed when the program was originally zipped here at our
world famous Research & Development laboratories.  This will create a directory
tree starting at the root level with \P11 and followed by several
additional directories, such as \P11\SYSTEM\ICONS, \P11\FONTS, etc..
<p>
<b>The backslash</b> tells PKUNZIP to recreate the original directory
structure (see above) at the <b>root level</b>.  You could create it
elsewhere but you would have to later use the DOS SUBST command to
make DOS tell P11 it "thinks" the files are within the \P11
structure, even though they aren't.  Got that?  Didn't think so. 
What it all means, is that the directory \P11 should exist when you're done, or you'll have to get complicated.
<p>
You can do this on any hard drive, so the form of unzip command can
also be:
<br>
<CODE>PKUNZIP.EXE P11STUFF.ZIP D:\ -D</CODE>
<br>
This example would put the files in the \P11 directory on the D: drive.
<p>
Once you have unzipped a program, then go to the drive you placed the
files on (usually c: or d:) and use the DOS command CD (Change
Directory) to go to the \P11 directory, like this: 
<br>
<code>CD \P11</code>
<br>
From the \P11 directory you should find a file called RUN.BAT.  Type:
<br>
<code>RUN</code>
<br>
to run the batch file that runs nearly all the programs. 
Occasionally, a program will not be in the batch file list.  In those
cases, you can find the directory for the program you installed
within the \P11 directory by typing:
<br>
<code>DIR \P11\????????</code>
<br>
and press <code>ENTER</code> at the DOS prompt.  There should be a batch file in the directory.  Run that batch file.
<p>
Note:  You can also simply decompress most P11 applications from THE ANIMATED
SOFTWARE COMPANY into any directory, and the batch file that starts
the program will look for P11RUN.EXE in the \P11 directory and in the current directory.
However, if you use the parameters given above to recreate our
directory structure, you will be able to use the RUN.BAT master batch
file most of the time.

<h2>ALL ABOUT PUMPS</h2>
<h2>The Heart: The Engine of Life</h2>
<h3>...and other programs from:</h3>
<h1>THE ANIMATED SOFTWARE COMPANY</h1>
<hr>
<h3>Part 1: About the CD-ROM ALL ABOUT PUMPS</h3>
Normally the CD-ROM uses NO hard disk space and has NO installation 
procedure.  It will run IMMEDIATELY by simply typing GO from the 
DOS prompt.  
<h3>Part 2: About installing our downloadable software</h3>
Our products, other than those on CD-ROM, are shipped in compressed
(also called zipped) format.  Please see our guide to unzipping for
information on how to decompress or unzip our software.  Once 
installed, the programs normally should simply be able to run from 
the DOS prompt.
<hr>
<h3>Part 3: When it doesn't work after installing our Software</h3>
The next section is an overview for those times when it 
doesn't work that way.  Most problems can be easily identified and 
just as easily solved.  If you have any problems using our software, 
the first thing to do is:
<h2>DON'T PANIC!</h2>
<p>
There are millions of unique systems and some hardware/software 
configurations don't always run right the first time.  Service is our 
#1 priority and we want to help you.  There are <b>5</b> ways to get
support:
<h3>Best way:</h3>
Our web site is the <i>best</i> method of support. At the web site
are all the latest answers to all questions. Our Internet web address 
(URL) is: http://www.animatedsoftware.com
<h3>Second way:</h3>
On the disk, we place many of the  support documents as they exist at 
the time the disk is pressed.  The first electronic document to look 
at on the disk is the README file in the root directory of every disk 
we ship.  
<h3>Third way:</h3>
We also have a support area and download library on CompuServe.  To reach 
us on CompuServe, use the keyword GO ANISOFT.  You can 
leave us a message on the bulletin board or you can email us directly at: 
71333,721@compuserve.com
<h3>If all else fails try this way:</h3>
You can also call write, fax, or call us at the address given below. 
When contacting us please include your name, an email address, and a 
phone number, and all the relevant information such as what program 
you were trying to run, what exactly happened, and what hardware you 
have. We will try to get you going.
<h1>TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE</h1>
This brief guide is to familiarize you with the most likely problems 
so you can get more detailed help from our other sources.  
<ul><b>Topics covered:</b>
<li><b>EXITING "P11" PROGRAMS</b>
<li><b>VIDEO PROBLEMS</b>
<li><b>HIGH MEMORY PROBLEMS--EMM and XMS</b>
<li><b>BASE MEMORY PROBLEMS</b>
<li><b>AUDIO PROBLEMS</b>
<li><b>OTHER PROBLEMS</b>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3>EXITING "P11" PROGRAMS</h3>
Use <code><ALT>-Q</code> to exit at any time.  Press one of the
<code><ALT></code> keys down and 
while holding it down press Q to exit the program and return to DOS.
<h3>VIDEO PROBLEMS</h3>
<p>
ALL ABOUT PUMPS requires high-resolution video.  Your computer's 
video card must have at least 1 megabyte of VIDEO RAM to run 
ALL ABOUT PUMPS.  The card must also support the industry standard 
known as VESA, version 1.2.  Most video cards now support the VESA 
video standard in hardware, and most others support it in software. 
<p>
The monitor must also support high-resolution.  Some laptops can 
support the high-resolution mode on the video card, but not on the 
built-in screen.  Sometimes the program cannot detect this situation 
and you may only see only the upper left portion of the screen.  Plug 
in a high resolution monitor to solve this problem.
<p>
THE HEART: THE ENGINE OF LIFE  runs in three screen resolutions so 
video problems are less likely to occur.  It will select the highest
resolution it can, of the three.  The three are 4-color CGA,
256-color MCGA, and 256-color SVGA.  CGA and MCGA are 320 by 200
dots across and down the screen.  SVGA is 1024 by 768 dots.
<h3>HIGH MEMORY PROBLEMS</h3>
<p>
ALL ABOUT PUMPS needs at least 2.8 megabytes of high memory.  There are 
two types of high memory and either type can be used.  One is called 
EXPANDED MEMORY and the other is called EXTENDED MEMORY.  These are 
usually abbreviated as EMM and XMS. 
<p>
THE HEART: THE ENGINE OF LIFE needs 1.0 megabytes of high memory for 
the medium and high-resolution modes but none for the low resolution mode.   
<p>
Users of Windows may need to create a Windows startup file to tell 
Windows to give our program the necessary amounts of high memory. 
By default Windows 3.1 gives a program only 1024K of high memory.  
<p>
<b>NOTE #1:</b>  Expanded Memory (EMM) was originally designed by 
Lotus, Intel, and Microsoft, in a standard commonly known as 
"LIM 3.2", to be <b>much faster</b> than Extended Memory (XMS), 
because it was <b>paged memory</b> instead of <b>swapped memory</b>.  
<p>
What this means is that with EMM, just by changing <b>address pointers</b> we 
can refer to different 16K 'pages'.  XMS, on the other 
hand, physically transfers (swaps) the chunks of memory from one place 
to another because you can't access it directly in high memory.  And
you can't do it yourself, you have to tell the driver software to do
it, which may or may not be well-written.  Either way, this limitation 
changes something that can be done in 20 steps 
or so, (changing the address pointers), into something that takes at 
least 16,384 steps per 16K chunk, with no guarantee that those 16,384
steps are efficiently written!  
<p>
With animations having individual frame sizes of 300K or more, and
usually dozens of frames at the very least,
this seemingly subtle difference can significantly impact maximum frame 
rate.  Maximum frame rate is in fact usually the limiting factor when
deciding how big and how smooth we can make each animation.  Were
this not true many of our animations would be bigger, smoother, and more 
beautiful.  
<p>
As originally designed by Lotus, Intel, and Microsoft, EMM could be 
as much as 1,000+ times faster than XMS!  Even poorly written code
should be able to achieve 10+ or 100+ times better performance with EMM
over XMS!  But unfortunately, we have not noticed a significant 
difference on Windows 95 machines.  Apparently Microsoft has 
implemented only true XMS in Windows 95.  Expanded Memory (EMM),
their own specification (with Lotus and Intel) is <b>emulated in
software</b> instead of being <b>implemented in hardware</b>.   To 
put icing on the cake, this probably means EMM is actually a little 
slower than XMS instead of faster like it should be!  
<p>
If a future version of Windows supports real EMM as designed by 
Microsoft, Intel, and Lotus, it should be substantially faster 
than either XMS or emulated EMM.  This does not mean that all our 
cvurrent animations will run faster, but it would mean that 
future animations could be larger and smoother.  
Current animations could still be placed on the screen faster,
which would tend to make them smoother.  I hope Microsoft fixes this
some day and properly re-creates LIM 3.2 Expanded Memory!  Of course,
I may discover I'm wrong about what's going on, as I have no way of
knowing what Microsoft actually has done, but something appears
amiss.
<p>
<b>NOTE #2:</b>  As if that wasn't bad enough, Microsoft Windows 95 may 
not give the program enough actual "real" XMS or EMM memory and might 
try to swap <b>disk memory</b> instead!  (I guess that would make
it's implementation of EMM be an emulation of an emulation.) 
If you have less than 16 megabytes of high memory RAM on your machine
Windows 95 may swap the 2.8 megabytes or so that we need.  Why does
it do this?  I don't know, ask "Bill".  
<p>
This can significantly slow the animations or make them jerky (and your 
hard drive light will flash).  Our software contains some of the smoothest 
animations you will ever see on a computer so be sure to adjust Windows 
properly if necessary.
<h3>BASE MEMORY PROBLEMS</h3>
BASE RAM is very fast memory but there is only 640K of it available  It 
is also known as Conventional Memory.  Our programs have been configured 
to use as little base memory as possible.  If you are unable to even start 
the program at all this may be the problem.  Most or our P11 programs
need over 450K and some need as much as 512K of "free" conventional 
memory.  The Editor version of P11 (used to create your own animation
applications) needs about 70 to 100K more than the runtime version 
(the runtime version is used by all <i>applications</i> such as ALL
ABOUT PUMPS, THE ENGINE OF LIFE, and so on).  
<p>
To find out how much free conventional memory you have available, type <b>mem</b>
at the DOS prompt. (See our <a href="/faqs/learndos.htm">DOS guide</a> 
for more information.)
<h3>AUDIO PROBLEMS</h3>
ALL ABOUT PUMPS does not use audio.  THE HEART: THE ENGINE OF LIFE has 
a small amount of audio.  The digitized sounds require a Sound-Blaster 
or compatible and a BLASTER= statement in the computer's environmental 
configuration area.  Windows appears to place these statements in the
environment string as it should, however, there also appears to be a
slight delay of audio which was supposed to be synchronized to
animations on the screen, on some machines running Windows 95.  The
delay appears to be about one fifth of a second (1/5) or less.  We are
investigating why this is so but have not been able to determine if
it is a correctable problem or not.  Our guess is that Windows is
either intercepting the signal for some reason or other and/or swapping
it to disk, or it has a different priority for activities than DOS
did.  We don't know, but be aware that if audio tracks appear to clip
a little off at the end and/or start a little behind the visual
image, and you are running from a Windows 95 machine, it may not be
correctable on current architecture.

<title> How to Run P11 Applications from Windows 3.1</title>
</header>
<body>
<hr>
<h1> How to run programs written with P11 in Windows 3.1 </h1>
<hr>
<a href="/pics/icons/ascologo.gif"><IMG ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=10 WIDTH=32 HEIGHT=14 SRC="/pics/icons/ascolog1.gif" ALT=""></a>
<p>
To Run ALL ABOUT PUMPS and other P11 applications from WINDOWS 3.1,
you need to write a PIF file.  This is because although Microsoft
claims to fully support DOS applications, in truth they only give DOS
a small part of a machine and DOS has to explicitly ask for the rest. 
I don't consider that full support, do you?
<p>
(For WIN 95 users, you will need to create a <b>shortcut</b> instead. See <a href="/faqs/win95pif.htm"><b>Win95 shortcut files</b></a>.) 
<p>
<b>WINDOWS 3.1 STEPS TO WRITE A PIF FILE FOR "P11"</b>
<br>
This explanation assumes you have already downloaded and unzipped the P11 application of your choice.  Also, it assumes you have some familiarity with WINDOWS.  Lastly, we cannot assume any responsibility for WINDOWS problems.  Please call Microsoft FIRST if you need to learn how to start DOS applications from WINDOWS.
<p>
This application shows writing a PIF for ALL ABOUT PUMPS.  PIFs for other "P11" applications can be written essentially the same way, but with different memory requests.
<p>
<br>
Use the PIF EDITOR supplied with WINDOWS 3.1 to create a new PIF.
Following through the list of options, here are suggested entries:
<br>
<b>Program Filename:</b> PUMPS.BAT (the main batch file)
<br>
<b>Window Title:</b>  ALL ABOUT PUMPS TUTORIAL (anything you like)
<br>
<b>Optional Parameters:</b> (none)
<br>
<b>Start-up Directory:</b> C:\P11\PUMPS  (all P11 programs are in the \p11 directory)
<br>
<p>
<br>
<b>Video Memory:</b> High Graphics (I'm not sure this matters)
<br>
<b>Memory Requirements:</b> 507Kb Required, 507 Needed
<br>
<b>EMS Memory:</b>  0,0 (you can use this or XMS.  In this example we use XMS)
<br>
<b>XMS Memory:</b> 2700 Required, 4800 Limit (for ALL ABOUT PUMPS, all images are shown with 2700 but 4800 gives some images more frames)
<br>
<b>Display Usage:</b> Full Screen
<br>
<b>Execution:</b> Exclusive
<br>
<b>Close Window On Exit</b> should be checked.
<br>
<p>
<br>
<b>Advanced Options:</b>
<br>
<b>Multitasking Options:</b>
<br>
<b>Background Priority:</b>  1   <b> Foreground Priority:</b>   10000
<br>
<b>Detect Idle Time:</b>  Do not check this box.
<br>
<b>Memory Options:</b>  Nothing checked.
<br>
<b>Display Options:</b>
<br>
<b>Monitor Ports:</b>  Check <b>Emulate Text Mode</b> and <b>Retain Video Memory</b> only.
<br>
<b>Other Options:</b>  None checked.
<br>
<p>
<br>
<b>Save the PIF file</b> and make a note of where you put it, then run it.  Your P11 application should now run fine in Windows 3.1
<br>
<b>Notes on using Windows 3.1:</b>  We suggest you do not use ctrl-alt-del to stop a P11 application which is running in Windows 3.1.  Doing so will probably cause the hardware timer speed-up routine to be left active, so your Windows 3.1 clock will run fast, which will cause the mouse to appear not to accept double-clicks.  (In reality, you just can't click fast enough.)  
<p>
If you do find yourself in this situation ("Accelerated Winclock Syndrome") you can exit Windows 3.1 to DOS through keystrokes (ALT-TAB to find the Program Manager Window, then ALT-F4 to Quit WIndows) and then restart Windows 3.1 and you should be okay.
<p>
To exit P11 properly, use the <b>ESCAPE</b> key followed by "y" or, in all newer programs, ALT-Q (quit) will exit immediately to DOS.
<br>
<br>
<b>Please contact us if you have any problems running any P11 application from within Windows or WIN 95.  But please contact Microsoft if you need to learn more about Windows. Thank you.</b>

<title> VESA video errors, Univesa, and P11 Error Code #7721 </title>
</header>
<body>
<h2>Using VESA video graphics with products from</h2>
<a href="/ascodesc/ascodesc.htm">
<IMG ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=10 WIDTH=198 HEIGHT=86 SRC="/pics/icons/ascologo.gif" ALT=""></a>
<h2>The Animated Software Company</h2>
<p>
All high resolution SVGA video mode software written using <b>RUSSELL'S "P11" ANIMATION MACHINE</b>
requires a VESA video driver.  Most modern computers (since about
1995) have VESA drivers in hardware on the video card, but older ones
and some new ones do not.  This FAQ page describes what you can do to
solve most VESA problems.
<p>
If you try to run ALL ABOUT PUMPS or any of our other SVGA demos and
programs and you get <b>Error Code #7721</b>, it usually means that you don't
have a VESA video driver.  In some cases error codes #7000 up to #7099
may also be removed by installing a VESA video driver.
<br>
<ul><b>There are basically four solutions which are described below:</b>
<li>
<b>First:</b>  Use the original video card manufacturers' VESA software.  It
probably came on an accompanying disk  when you bought the card.
<li>
<b>Second:</b>  Contact the VESA organization's own web site for more information. The web address is given below. 
<li>	 
<b>Third:</b>  Buy a new SVGA video card!  Preferably one that supports VESA in hardware.
<li>
<b>Fourth:</b>  Use the software driver we supply, called UNIVESA, or one like it.
</ul>
<b>Next I'll describe each of these solutions.</b>
<hr>
<h3>Use the original video card manufacturers' VESA software</h3>
The best place to get a video driver from the manufacturer of the video card is on the
original diskette that probably came with your video card when you
bought it.  Nearly all video card manufacturers include a VESA video driver, and
have done so for several years.  The video driver may or may not be
better than UNIVESA, but it should definitely work with your card! 
Although UNIVESA is a very good program, it is possible it won't work with your
card.  The original manufacturer's driver certainly will work,
though.
<p>
If they did not supply a driver on diskette with the card, they may
have a BBS or support area on AOL or Compuserve, or on the Internet,
where you can download their software.
<hr>
<h3>Contacting VESA (Video Electronics Standards Assocation)</h3>
VESA maintains a complete web site at:<br>
<a href="http://www.vesa.org/">http://www.vesa.org/</a><br>
There, you will will be able to find plenty of information to get VESA 
up and running on your PC.  VESA is a non-profit organization
headquartered in San Jose, California.  (Note: Our company is not 
associated with the VESA organization other than that we try to 
support the video standards they set.)
<hr>
<h3>Buy a new SVGA video card!</h3>
Virtually all video cards now are SVGA, with VESA in the hardware, and 
with at least one megabyte video RAM.  
If your video card does not have 1 megabyte of video RAM,
you will not be able to run our SVGA programs.  New video cards
continue to come down in price.
<hr>
<h3>Use the software driver called UNIVESA</h3>
The final way to solve the problem would be to use a generic, publicly
available VESA video driver.  We found one called UNIVESA and have
been quite satisfied with it.
<p>
On most products we ship, and in our online software download area, we include a copy of UNIVESA, which is a copyrighted, freely
distributed software program that emulates VESA.  This driver, and
how to install it, is described below.
<p>
<a href="/ftp/p11_ftps.htm"><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM HSPACE=10 WIDTH=128 HEIGHT=64 SRC="/pics/icons/ftp_dl4.gif" ALT="FTP Downloadable Software!">Download this program now!</a> 
<p>
UNIVESA is a TSR (Terminate, Stay Resident) program.  This means that to
remove it after you have installed it, you need to reboot the
computer.  UNIVESA only takes a couple of thousand bytes (K) so it's usually not
necessary to remove it at all, and it checks to see if it is already
installed before it installs itself and won't reinstall.
<p>
So, that's the downside of UNIVESA--you can't uninstall it except by
rebooting.  Usually, it's not any problem.  The advantage is that is
has been reported to be one of the fastest drivers around, better
indeed that most manufacturer's own drivers!  And it seems to be well
written, though since it's not something we wrote, we can't promise
anything.  Please use it at your own risk. 
<p>
To install UNIVESA, first you need to find it, and then unzip it.  It is
located on the original installation disks on most of our software
products, and in the download areas of our support forums on AOL,
Compuserve, and on the Internet.  On our CD-ROMs it is located in the
directory UNIVESA.  The file is called UVESA32.ZIP.  (There may be a
UVESA34.ZIP available somewhere, but we haven't found it and are
unsure.  We supply UVESA32.ZIP at this time.)
<p>
To unzip UNIVESA, use PKUNZIP or some other unzipping tool.  Three
files will be created, UNIVESA.EXE, UNIVESA.DOC, and COPYRIGH.
<p>
Here is the command you can use to unzip UVESA32.ZIP:
<br>
<CODE>PKUNZIP.EXE UVESA32.ZIP C:\P11</CODE>
<br>
This example would put it on the C: drive in a directory called P11. 
You can place it in any directory.
<p>
Next, you will need to read the documentation and copyright notice for 
UNIVESA since these are important to its proper use.
<p>
To add UNIVESA to our programs so that it is loaded (if not already
loaded) when you run our programs, you need to add a command to one
of our batch files.  I will use ALL ABOUT PUMPS as an example of how
to do that.
<p>
You can add the following command:
<br>
<CODE>C:\P11\UNIVESA.EXE</CODE>
<br>
to any P11 batch file by simply editing the batch file.  If the file
is on a CD-ROM, however it cannot be saved to disk since they are
"Read Only".  In that case, simply create a two-line "batch file". 
The first line runs UNIVESA and the second line calls the batch file
on the CD-ROM.  For example, for the ALL ABOUT PUMPS CD on the D:
drive, the batch file might have these two commands:
<br>
<CODE>C:\P11\UNIVESA.EXE</CODE>
<br>
<CODE>D:\P11\RUN.BAT %1</CODE>
<br>
<p>
Notice the <b>%1</b> parameter in the second command.  This is used
to pass the option you choose to the RUN.BAT batch file.  For
example, if the two-line batch file you create is called TUTORIAL.BAT 
and is in the C:\P11 directory, then if you type
<br>
<CODE>C:\P11\TUTORIAL PUMPS</CODE>
<br>
it would pass the parameter PUMPS in variable %1 to the RUN.BAT batch
file on the CD-ROM.  Not all our batch files need parameters, and
actually some can accept more than one.  Just to be on the safe side,
you could also code the second line as:
<br>
<CODE>D:\P11\RUN.BAT %1 %2 %3</CODE>
<br>
<p>
You can create the batch file or edit one of ours with the DOS 
program EDIT or some other ASCII text editor (EDIT is the Microsoft 
text editor that replaced the EDLIN program that used to be supplied with DOS.)
<br>
<CODE>EDIT RUN.BAT</CODE>
<br>
Then insert a new line with the command.  Be sure to have it load
BEFORE the P11 application is run!  It can be the first command in
the batch file if you like.

<b>
A friend asked me the other day:
</b>
<p>
<i>
Russell, will you teach me DOS?  
</i>
<hr>
This is 1996 as I write this, and not everyone knows DOS anymore.  
But DOS is easy to learn and it is a great way to get
things done in life!  WINDOWS is much slower for all kinds of file
handling tasks especially. Of course, our own P11 program and all its
applications run in DOS so we want people to be at least a little
comfortable with it.  Hence this document.
<p>
DOS is considered the bad guy, especially by people at Microsoft, who
'dis' it more than anybody, and so people are afraid of DOS.  
Some people think WINDOWS is better than DOS simply because it <i>isn't</i> DOS.  
<p>
But the beauty of DOS from a user's standpoint is that it is fast and
easy to work with.  The beauty from a developer's standpoint is that
it allows me to easily control the entire PC hardware and virtually all
of its timing capabilities.  
<p>
<hr>
To use DOS properly, you <b>have to have a few tools</b> to go with it. 
DOS as installed by Microsoft is virtually crippled and very
difficult to use.
<p>
Several companies supply the necessary tools.  Some of them are free.
The tools I use are not the only choices, but they are the ones listed 
below the list of commands, and they are each desribed below the
list of command descriptions.
<p>
The thing about DOS is how quickly you can get things done.  Fewer
keystrokes.  It's textual, and it's <i>fast</i>.  But to be really
fast and easy, it needs some help.  For some reason Microsoft won't
add a previous-commands buffer to DOS!  (They store only the last
command.)  And their official policy on
<b>ced</b>, the one I use, is that it doesn't work with WINDOWS.  I
use it anyway, because it's so useful.  I need it.  
I don't know of a better command
line retrieval system the <b>ced</b>.  CED is a good program. 
Microsoft should make WINDOWS work with it, or they should fix
DOS to emulate its capabilities.
<p>
<hr>
<p>
There are not many commands you need to learn in DOS to use it
effectively, but you do need to learn one
command--<b>help</b>.  You need to be aware of a dozen or so
commands, but you only need to remember one of them--<b>help</b>.
<p>
These are the commands that you'll need to work with to be able to effectively use DOS:

<h3>DOS COMMAND DESCRIPTIONS</h3>
<h4>The first command you need to learn to use DOS is simply:</h4>
<p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="help_command">help</a></h3>
<code>
help
</code>
<p>
This command gives you a key to virtually everything you need to use DOS
effectively.  Can't remember the format for the FORMAT command?  Not
a problem!  Type HELP FORMAT and press the ENTER key, and you've got
everything you need to use FORMAT!  This is true for virtually every
DOS command so if you remember HELP <i>commandname</i> you won't have
any problems.
<p>
Another way to get help is to use <b>/?</b> (slash, question mark)
after any command.  This is faster and sometimes a more uesful form
of help, but it is generally <i>only</i> a listing of options.  HELP
is usually a more verbose help facility than /? is.
<p>
<a href="#dos_command_list">Back to command list.</a>
<p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="copy_command">copy</a></h3>
<code>
copy
</code>
<p>
Once you know where to get help, the rest is easy.  The whole purpose
of DOS is to let you get around the directory tree easily.  You use
DOS to start applications (like P11) and to copy files, delete files,
build places to put files, and compare files, and so on.  Files,
Files, Files.  That's what DOS is really for.  
<p>
The #1 tool for file handling is the COPY command.  Specify the
"from" file first, then the "to" file.  COPY only copies from within one
directory at a time, but the "to" directory can be different.  For
copying entire diretory structures, use XCOPY instead.
<p>
What makes COPY so powerful is that you can use "wildcards" like
<b>*</b> and <b>?</b> within the filename.  
<p>
<a href="#dos_command_list">Back to command list.</a>
<p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="xcopy_command">xcopy </a></h3>
<code>
xcopy 
</code>
<p>
Like COPY, XCOPY can use wildcards to copy a file or group of files
to another directory.  But XCOPY is more powerful because it has the
ability to copy an entire directory structure in one command.  Use
the <b>/s</b> option to accomplish this.  Use HELP XCOPY to learn more, of
course!
<p>
<a href="#dos_command_list">Back to command list.</a>
<p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="cd_command">cd (Change Directory)</a></h3>
<code>
cd
</code>
<p>
CD is the cold, hard way of doing
things, but sometimes it's the right way.  What makes it cold and
hard is that in comparison to Norton's Change Directory (normally
abbreviated NCD, but I abbreviated it to C on my system), the DOS
CD command requires you to type the complete directory entry,
all the way back to the root level!  This is absurd.  NCD, on the
other hand, lets you type in anything that's close, and it will
search your entire directory structure and plop you down right where
you want to be.  For example, to go to the \p11\pumps\svgapump
directory, I can just type in: <b>c svgap</b> and immediately NCD will
take me there.  With CD, I would have to type <b>cd
\p11\pumps\svgapump</b> to accomplish the same thing.  Saving
keystrokes is the name of the game.  (That's why later in this
tutorial, you'll learn to write batch files.)
<p>
<a href="#dos_command_list">Back to command list.</a>
<p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="md_command">md (Make Directory)</a></h3>
<code>
md
</code>
<p>
MD will make a new directory.  You can specify the entire
directory structure or just the new part, if you are already in the
parent of the new part.  Got that?  I didn't think so.  Let's say you
have a directory called <b>\animals</b>.  Let's say you are in that
directory, having typed <b>cd\animals</b> at some point.  To create
the directory \dogs as a subdirectory of \animals, you can type in
<b>md dogs</b> when you are in the \animals directory.  Or, you can
type in the full <b>md \animals\dogs</b> from any directory. 
However, you can't make two directory structures at once.  \animals
must exist before you can use MD to create \dogs. 
<p>
CD and MD (and RD) are often used in conjunction with each other.  If
you use MD to make a new directory, to then go into that new
directory, all you should have to do is just back up the command stack
one command and change the M in MD to a C.  (That's why you need a
command stack manipulator like CED.  In plain DOS, Function Key 3
will give you the last command, but <i>only</i> the last command.  CED will
go back dozens of commands.)
<p>
It's very important to understand a principal brought up in the last
paragraph--that you never retype anything you don't have to.  Don't
be fooled into thinking it's easier to retype than to find the old
command in the command stack and change a letter.  First of all, it
isn't.  And second of all, when you get to the DELETE (DEL) command,
you really need to not retype things!  (read on...)
<p>
<a href="#dos_command_list">Back to command list.</a>
<p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="rd_command">rd (Remove Directory)</a></h3>
<code>
rd
</code>
<p>
When you empty a directory and wish to
remove it entirely, you can use RD.  RD will not delete the entries
(files) in a directory.  They must already be deleted (the directory must be
empty) for RD to work.  However, these two steps can be simplified by
doing them in order.  Use the DEL command
(described below) and then bring the command line back (using your 
<i>command stack manipulator</i>).  Change DEL to RD and a space character.  
That way, you can be sure that you
will remove the exact directory you just emptied, because you don't
retype the directory name.  Actually, it's normally a
three-step process, since you would normally start with DIR <i>filename</i>, 
then change DIR to DEL <i>filename</i>, and <i>then</i> change DEL to RD
and a space.  
<p>
For example, to remove the contents from the directory BARNEY and
then remove BARNEY, use the following three commands.  Bring them
back each time with your <i>command stack manipulator</i>, and just 
change DIR to DEL and then DEL to RD and a space:
<p>
<code>
dir barney
<br>
del barney
<br>
rd  barney
</code>
<p>
You could, in theory, also use
the command DELTREE to remove both the contents <i>and</i> the
directory.  You could, but you should refrain from doing that,
because DELTREE is a <b>dangerous</b> command and should be
used slowly, carefully, and <i>sparingly</i>.  It should be a special
occasion to use DELTREE, but RD is an everyday thing.
<p>
<a href="#dos_command_list">Back to command list.</a>
<p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="dir_command">dir (Directory)</a></h3>
<code>
dir
</code>
<p>
DIR is the DOS way of getting a listing of a directory.  Incredibly
weak, it nevertheless has the advantage of being exactly like DEL in
the way it handles wildcards and directories.  Therefore, you can
type in DIR *.txt, and it will list all the files that end
with an extention of .txt, and after you see that that's what you
want, you can change the DIR to DEL after retrieving the command
back, and you know that you'll delete only what you want.  And save
keystrokes too!
<p>
<a href="#dos_command_list">Back to command list.</a>
<p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="ren_command">REN (Rename)</a></h3>
<code>
ren (oldname) (newname)
</code>
<p>
REN is short for the RENAME command.  You can rename any file or
files to any valid, unused name(s).  Wildcards work fine.  
You could rename a file by first copying it and
then deleting the original, but this means you would use the more
dangerous DEL command.  Never use DEL if you don't have to!  REN
gives you a way not to use DEL.  As an added benefit, REN is faster
than COPY/DEL, especially if it's a big file or group of files.
<p>
<a href="#dos_command_list">Back to command list.</a>
<p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="del_command">del (Delete)</a></h3>
<code>
del
</code>
<p>
DEL is the electronic equivalent of
a paper shredder.  The only way to recover files you have
accidentally DEL'ed to death is with some complicated software
program that MIGHT or MIGHT NOT work, but then again it might give
you new gibberish.  And if you DEL'ed star-dot-star (*.*) you can
pretty much forget most UNDELETE software programs from succeeding. 
Think of DEL as short for DISASTER IF I DIDN'T MEAN THIS.
<p>
That being said, of course, DEL is the standard way of deleting
things.  But because it's so final, you should almost always use DIR
before you use DEL.  Here's the plan:  first, use DIR to view the
filenames you wish to delete.  Next, use your command-line buffer to
get the same command back, and type DEL over DIR.  That way, you will
be absolutely sure that you will only DEL the things you just looked
at with DIR.  It's faster too, usually, than retyping the thing you
want to delete.  But even if it weren't, this is the best way to
delete things.
<p>
By the way, whenever you type in DEL *.*, you should always take your
hands away from the keyboard and review what you are doing.  Are you
on the right drive and in the right directory?  Do you really want to
do this?  Same is true for any DEL command with wildcards, at least
pause for a second or two, especially since the file recovery
programs I mentioned work much more reliably if you just need to
recover a single file, but if you need to recover multiple files,
they are much less successful.
<p>
<a href="#dos_command_list">Back to command list.</a>
<p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="deltree_command">deltree</a></h3>
<code>
deltree
</code>
<p>
<h4>CAUTION!!!</h4>
DELTREE is brutal and can really mess you up.  Its power is of
course, its virtue.  With DELTREE you essentially combine the <b>DEL *.*</b> command
with the <b>RD</b> command, but it's even better because you can delete
all the subdirectories as well, all in one swoop.  Definitely this is
a good command to know and respect.  ALWAYS pause before hitting the
<b>ENTER</b> key with this command!  I <i>literally</i> take my hands away
from the keyboard and read the line before I press ENTER when I use this 
command!
<p>
<a href="#dos_command_list">Back to command list.</a>
<p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="fc_command">fc (File Compare)</a></h3>
<code>
fc (filecomp)
</code>
<p>
FC is short for FILECOMP, or FILE COMPARE.  You should always use this command to compare files 
that are really important to you when you create a new copy.  
If you duplicate software, use FC to be sure that the "masters"
for the manufacturer or distributor are the same as your own
masters.  FC takes too long, and systems are too reliable, to use it
all the time, for everything.  Besides, when copying files on your 
hard disk this command is not usually needed because a similar command 
takes its place: In your AUTOEXEC.BAT file the command VERIFY=ON.  
VERIFY will normally cause DOS to read back every 
file it writes, every time it writes it.  At least, that's what it's
designed to do, but whether VERIFY always does that, with every file,
on every drive, well--I'm skeptical.  So I use FC when it really
matters.
<p>
<a href="#dos_command_list">Back to command list.</a>
<p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="diskcopy_command">diskcopy</a></h3>
<code>
diskcopy
</code>
<p>
DISKCOPY lets you make exact copies of master diskettes.  This is
good for backup and small distribution purposes.  If you use DISKCOPY
to copy a diskette to another diskette using the same physical disk drive, 
then DOS will copy a piece at a time, and will prompt you to swap them back 
and forth until it's done.  Somehow,
Microsoft hasn't thought of using swap space on the hard drive so you
would only have to swap the physical media once.  Maybe some day it
will occur to them.  There are shareware and other tools to do
multi-disk copies, which do use "image files" on disk, for larger
runs.  Beyond a few hundred copies, consider a CD master or outside
disk duplicator service.
<p>
<a href="#dos_command_list">Back to command list.</a>
<p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="diskcomp_command">diskcomp</a></h3>
<code>
diskcomp
</code>
<p>
When you make a "MASTER BACKUP" disk of something <i>really</i> important, you
should use DISKCOMP to be sure it is the same as the "ORIGINAL MASTER"
diskette.
<p>
<a href="#dos_command_list">Back to command list.</a>
<p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="edit_command">edit</a></h3>
<code>
edit
</code>
<p>
EDIT is a fairly lousy editor, and my actual ASCII text editor of
choice is an early version
of BRIEF which I use for almost everything.  It's fast.  
BRIEF is text-based and the only real problem is, everyone agrees I
could use a spell-checker if it had one but hey--it's fast.  
And it's great for
writing batch files, something you'll be introduced to later in this
document.  
<p>
But for those without an ASCII text editor of choice, we
all have EDIT available to us from Microsoft.  It beats the pants off
of the old EDLIN, but if you remember EDLIN, you probably wouldn't
need to be reading this.  
<p>
EDIT is for writing batch files, and for editing batch files.  That's
about all it's good for, but you'll probably find youself using it
often enough that you should get comfortable with it.  Know how to
delete a line, how to move around the document, how to insert and
change characters, and how to copy a section.  Just know how to get
help in EDIT and then remember to use it when you need it. 
(<b>F1</b> is the help key in EDIT, by the way.)

<hr>
<h3><a name="mem_command">mem (Memory)</a></h3>
<code>
mem
</code>
<p>
A lot of problems with running programs in DOS has to do with memory,
same as in Windows and just about everything else, I guess.  Many
programs (including ours) tell you what amount of Conventional memory
and what amount of Expanded and/or Extended memory they need.
<p>
Knowing these values, you can use MEM to see if you indeed have
enough memory available to run your application.  
<p>
Use <b>MEM /c|more</b> to get more information, and have it scroll a
page at a time.  (See <b>memmaker</b>, below, to learn what to do if MEM
turns up showing too little memory available.)
<p>
<a href="#part_two_cmdlst">Back to command list.</a>
<p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="memmaker_command">memmaker</a></h3>
<code>
memmaker
</code>
<p>
When MEM, above, reports that you don't have enough Conventional
Memory, Expanded Memory, or Extended Memory, you can use MEMMAKER to
(hopefully) free some memory up.
<p>
MEMMAKER is a Microsoft program that trys to place programs which are
in Conventional memory somewhere else--who cares where, right? 
Usually it's in a place called HIGH MEMORY, or UPPER MEMORY.  DOS can
actually directly access one megabyte plus 64K of memory, but
unfortunately useless screen modes take about 30% of that area. 
MEMMAKER can make more Conventional memory available by filling in
some nooks and crannies in the total addressable 1 meg+64K area.

<hr>
<h3><a name="format_command">format</a></h3>
<code>
format
</code>
<p>
<h4>CAUTION!!!</h4>
FORMAT should be used for diskettes only.  You virtually never want to FORMAT your hard
drive.  If you did, you'd probably start with a low-level format "just
to be on the safe side" anyway.  FORMAT is for diskettes only!  So,
NORTON came up with a nice program called SF (SAFE FORMAT) which will
replace FORMAT and which will not allow you to accidentally format your
hard drive.  I use SF instead of FORMAT, but if you use format, you
can still get the safety aspects of SF by renaming FORMAT.COM and
then creating a batch file called FORMAT.BAT and placing it in the
C:\DOS directory.  The batch file uses the batch file command IF to only allow 
you to use A: or B: or a: or b:.  All other "options" are invalid.

<h3><a name="prompt_command">prompt</a></h3>
<code>
prompt
</code>
<p>
PROMPT is a little thing, but you need it.  The "infamous DOS prompt" can be
greatly improved.  I use:
<br>
<code>
PROMPT $t $d$h$h$h $p$g
</code>
<br>
This goes in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file and will, as shown, cause DOS to
display a prompt consisting of the day of the week, the date, the
time to the second, the drive and current directory, and a
greater-than sign.  I like it that way.  Knowledge is power, you
know.
<p>

<p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="redirection">redirection (&gt; and &lt;)</a></h3>
<code>
redirection (&gt; and &lt;)
</code>
<p>
Redirection (&gt; and &lt;, greater-than and less-than signs) allows you to 
send (&gt;) output of other commands somewhere else, or receive (&lt;)
input from somewhere else.  Output is often sent to a file instead of
to the screen with this option.  For example to send the output of a 
DIR command to a file called mydir.txt, use this:
<br>
<code>
dir &gt; mydir.txt
</code>
<br>
This would take the output of the DIR command and place it in a file
called mydir.txt instead of displaying it on the screen.  Use two
greater-than signs (&gt;&gt;) to append to an existing file.  You can
also send output directly to the printer using the special
destination name <b>prn</b>  (or prn:).
<p>
To receive input from a file rather than from the keyboard, use &lt;
and then the name of the file which has the input lines that you want
to use.

<hr>
<h3><a name="piping">pipes (|, a vertical line)</a></h3>
<code>
|
</code>
<p>
Piping takes the complete output of one command and sends it to the
next command (after the vertical bar).
Pipes are useful for many things, but probably the most common use of
pipes are with the <b>more</b> command to cause the
output of other DOS commands to be displayed on the screen one 
screen at a time.  For example:
<br>
<code>
mem /c|more
</code>
<br>

<H3>VITAL THIRD-PARTY DOS TOOLS</H3>
<p>
<a name="vital_ced"><b>ced</b></a> or some other DOS command stack
manipulator. CED is the one I use, but another commonly used command 
stacker is called DOSKEY, for both MS-DOS and PC-DOS.  The purpose of
a command stack manipulator is to let you get at previous DOS
commands you typed without having to retype them.  Again, plain DOS
only lets you get at the very last one, which is sort of like having
Alzheimer's disease.
<p>
<a href="#thirdpartytools_list">Back to third-party tools list</a>.
<p>
<a name="vital_hdir"><b>hdir</b></a> or some other 'advanced' directory file viewer
<p>
DIR is too simple, and has no color.  HDIR provides a much easier way
to display a list of files in a directory and the list is much easier
to read than a DIR output.  There are many other
similar tools.  If you use HDIR, use CED's cedparms to rename HDIR as H, 
and put HDIR in a root directory or better yet, on a virtual drive
for fast access.  
<p>
<a href="#thirdpartytools_list">Back to third-party tools list</a>.
<p>
<a name="vital_norton"><b>Norton</b></a> or some other Change Directory tool
<p>
Norton's NCD is good, but again, use CED to change the name to C
instead of NCD, and put it on a virtual drive on your system.
<p>
<a href="#thirdpartytools_list">Back to third-party tools list</a>.
<p>
<a name="vital_filefind"><b>File Find</b></a> tool
<p>
Norton's FF (FileFind) is good, so if you have Norton Utilities, you
might as well use FF.  But there are a number of shareware tools that
are just as good or better.  You need to be able to find any file
you know the name of (or part of the name) anywhere on a disk, or
even across multiple disks. You should also be able to find files
with similar names so you can delete old duplicates and
old work-in-progress files.  
<p>
<a href="#thirdpartytools_list">Back to third-party tools list</a>.
<p>
<a name="vital_batchfiles"><b>Batch Files</b></a> are such simple timesavers that you'll want to be able to write and edit them
yourself.
<p>
To learn to write batch files, you can download any of our demos, all
of which have simple batch files to start them, and
copy the code for them.  It's pretty easy.  Use EDIT to create batch
files you need to accomplish things you do more than once or twice,
or to develop series of commands you want to execute repeatedly.  
<p>
Batch files don't have to be big--I have plenty of one-line batch
files which I give short names to and which might only execute one thing. 
Batch files can call other batch files or jump to other batch files,
which increases their usefulness substantially.
<p>
Batch files are time savers and they help you to do things quickly
and efficiently and the same way every time.
<p>
In order to save keystrokes, I often rename the few programs I use
regularly, like BRIEF.EXE,
which is renamed b.exe and placed on my virtual drive for virtually
instant access.

<title> Unzipping "P11" applications when you use America Online</title>
</header>

<hr>
<h3> How to unzip and install "P11" programs when using AOL </h3>
<h2>This information is only useful for people who find our software
on a forum on AOL and are using AOL for downloading. </h2>
<hr>
<a href="/ascodesc/ascodesc.htm"><IMG ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=5 WIDTH=32 HEIGHT=14 SRC="/pics/icons/ascologo.gif" ALT=""></a>
<p>
<hr>
A new user on AOL sent us the following question, which we have
answered in great detail...  (or, everything you ever wanted to know
about downloading P11 programs while using AOL.)  
<p>
<i>Help! My first time in downloading and I want to make sure I am doing IT
right. I want to download How animation works and The Demo of the heart.
Please send the proper tools I need; they talk about p11stuff?</i>
<p>
The way downloading usually works is that you download "files" which have
been compressed (also called zipped.  They are shrunk or made smaller).  The
main reason files are compressed is so that they download more quickly.
That's the only reason, but it's an important one!  However, another reason
one might compress something is that the file actually consists of many files
which are brought together and shrunk down as small a possible (compressed)
into one file.
<p>
Almost all of ours, for example, are like that.  The demo of the heart is ten
or twelve separate files which are decompressed (or unzipped) onto your hard
drive and then they can be run.  The How to Make Animation program is also
several files all zipped together.
<p>
So that's what you are downloading. 
<p>
Our company actually offers something like 600 or 1000 separate files for
you, for free, through America Online.   These are zipped up into 30 or so
files for download, such as the two you've selected.  We are BIG supporters
of AOL and like to offer lots of really useful demos.  In fact, we are
actually the oldest company with continuous online support in the graphics
forum. 
<p>
Anyway, all these educational animations all need the same animation engine
to run--that's what the P11 thing is.  Officially called RUSSELL's "P11"
ANIMATION MACHINE, there is an editor version and a runtime version.  The
editor version is used to create educational software.  The runtime version
is used to run things.  So the demos we offer, including the two you've
selected, need the runtime version, which is in a file called P11STUFF.ZIP.
It is available from our Internet web site or might also be found on AOL
somewhere.
<p>
Because we offer so many files, and because thousands of people download more
than one demo (as you did) we feel it is useful to organize everything after
it's downloaded, on your hard drive.  So, everything from our company is
designed to be placed in one directory (and many subdirectories) on your hard
drive.  That directory is \P11 and it can be on any drive. 
<p>
The \P11 directory is automatically created whenever you unzip any of our
files using PKUNZIP with the \ and -d options, like this for example:
<p><code><b>
PKUNZIP.EXE  P11STUFF.ZIP  C:\  -D
<p></b></code>
This would unzip the file P11STUFF (which contains P11RUN.EXE) to the \P11
directory on the c: drive.
<p>
Lastly, when AOL downloads things it can automatically decompress them.
You can turn this "feature" off using PREFERENCES in AOL, and we
recommend you do that for our products. The reason:
Unfortunately AOL won't recreate the directory structure <i>at the root
level</i> so the \P11 directory might exist (depending on what version of AOL you are
using) but it will be in, for example, the \aol25\download\amazing directory. 
AOL creates a directory in \aol25\download with the name of the file, in this case
<b>amazing.zip</b>, and then creates the subdirectory structure under it.
<p>
This won't run our programs properly, but it's fairly easy to fix so it will.  You
can do one of two things.  First, simple manually unzip the files again using
PKUNZIP and the options given above.  Then delete the \<i>filename</i>\P11 directory tree
under \aol25\download\.   
<p>
The other way is to use the <b>DOS</b> command XCOPY, like this:
<p><code><b>
xcopy \aol25\download\p11stuff\p11\*.*  c:\p11\*.* /s
<p></b></code>
This will copy everything created automatically be AOL if you have it set to
automatically decompress everything it finds in the \aol25\download directory
when you sign off.  If you let it decompress our files, it creates (at least,
version WAOL 2.5 does this) the \p11 directory and the subdirectories, but it
does this underneath the \aol25\download\<i>filename</i>\ directory!  This is quite
useless since we can't put everything under the \p11 directory this
way--instead, there is a \p11 directory created for each file you download.
Hence, the need to use the DOS XCOPY command or to reunzip the files.
<p>
I know this is a long answer, but I think it's pretty complete.  If you still
have trouble, please email me again and I'll try to help.  May I also suggest
you try our file FIVEHORS.ZIP?  This is an interesting animation of five
horses in different gaits, and it contains everything needed to run in one
file, making it a little easier to download and try.  In fact, to test that I
had all my facts right for this email I downloaded it (and all the files you
downloaded as well) and ran it just a paragraph or two ago!
<p>
<hr>
<p>
We thought this was everything you needed to know.  It wasn't.  The user responded with this:
<p>
<i>
I am on the newest AOL version. In order for me to download any of your
animation files I need to download (hitting the download Button) p11stuff.zip
first, Correct? Then go ahead and download How animation works? Where do I go
after to retrieve this information so I can use this, or even transfer it
onto my disk? 
<p>
I did appreciate your last reply and was very helpful. Being new at this I
want to make sure I do this right. I am doing a class presentation on
computer animation but more importantly learning for myself on the creation
of animation.
</i>
<p>
(Our response follows...)
<br>
<p>
You need P11STUFF.ZIP for most, but not all, or our animations and you need
it specifically for the two you downloaded (AMAZING.ZIP and P11-EDUC.ZIP, if
I remember correctly).  There are some--for example FIVEHORS.ZIP and
GENI.ZIP--where P11RUN.EXE is included.  For those, you don't need to
download P11RUN.EXE (which is in P11STUFF.ZIP, as mentioned in my previous
letter.)
<p>
Note that even if you've downloaded one of the self-contained ones like
FIVEHORS.ZIP you should still go ahead and download P11STUFF.ZIP because it
contains a batch file (soon to be simply another P11 demo, by the way) which
runs ALL our files.  It's called RUN.BAT, by the way.  Each application has a
specific batch file for its own operation, too.  RUN.BAT simply calls
those batch files--it never executes P11RUN.EXE itself.    
<p>
Sooner or later (soon I hope!) we will move to a master P11 screen that
introduces all the demos (perhaps even decompresses them for you too), at
which point RUN.BAT <i>will</i> simply execute P11RUN.EXE.  This is something that
has been suggested to me repeatedly over the years but I just didn't get
around too.  Now, with everything usually starting in Windows, (and having
been downloaded) it really makes sence to simplify this whole process that
way--or some way!
<p>
So, to answer your first question, yes.  You do need to click on DOWNLOAD NOW
button or the DOWNLOAD LATER button to download a file.  Next will display a
window suggesting you place the file in the \AOL25\DOWNLOAD directory.  You
can change it to a different directory but each time you download something,
it asks again if you want it here.  So, most people, I'm sure, put it here
(in the \aol25\download directory).
<p>
The download process transfers the compressed files to your disk.  The next
step is to decompress them (also to your disk).  This can be done
automatically with AOL's software, and that is not a bad way to do it.  If
you choose to let AOL downcompress it, then you need to use XCOPY afterwards
to copy the entire subdirectory structure, starting at the \P11 level and as
described in my previous coorespondance, to the \P11 directory at the root
level.  See my previous email for the exact syntax of the necessary DOS XCOPY
command.
<p>
Where do you execute XCOPY?  (or PKUNZIP, the alternative method to use if
you don't let AOL decompress the files, as also described yesterday)
<p>
You execute these commands, XCOPY or PKUNZIP, from the DOS command line while
in the \aol25\download directory.   
<p>
Use the DOS command cd (Change Directory) to go to the \aol25\download
directory, like this:
<p>
<code>
cd\aol25\download
</code>
<p>
that will put you in the \aol25\download directory, which is where all the
files you ever download go in AOL, unless you override that feature.
Frankly, I wish AOL decompression software would simply give you the option
to recreate the directory structure in the files you download and decompresss
AT THE ROOT LEVEL, but they don't, so you need to either use XCOPY and move
the thing, or don't let AOL decompress it and use PKUNZIP with \ and -d
options.
<p>
I hope this answers you additional questions but please don't hesitate to ask
more.  It's been kind of fun to analyze the whole procedure so carefully for
you.  There are certainly a lot of steps involved, and so many of them a
"pro" takes for granted, like being able to find the download button!  You
may be interested to know that I've taken our first correspondance and
placed it at my web site (I didn't use your name, only your question(s) and
my answer(s)) and I'll do the same with this one, so that perhaps others will
be able to get through this part more easily next time.  
<p>
So ask away!  I will get you watching animated horses and hearts, and
learning how to animate on your own soon!  I won't give up if you won't.
<p>
<hr>
Note:  You can also simply decompress most P11 applications from THE ANIMATED
SOFTWARE COMPANY into any directory, and the batch file that starts
the program will look for P11RUN.EXE in the \P11 directory and in the current directory.
However, if you use the parameters given above to recreate our
directory structure, you will be able to use the RUN.BAT master batch
file most of the time.

<hr>
<DL><DT><DD>
<H3>Spacecraft Power for Cassini</H3>
<i>February 1996
<P>Cassini's electrical power source - Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generators 
(RTGs) - have provided electrical power for some of the U.S. space program's 
greatest successes, including the Apollo lunar landings and the Viking Landers 
that searched for life on Mars. RTGs made possible NASA's celebrated 
Voyager explorations of Jupiter, 
Saturn, Uranus and Neptune, as well as the Pioneer missions to Jupiter and 
Saturn. RTG power sources are enabling the Galileo mission to Jupiter and the 
international Ulysses mission studying the Sun's polar regions.</i>
</DL>
While they may have had some successes, they have also had some
dismal failures, including Apollo 13.  Although not mentioned in
the recent Hollywood movie, there was plutonium onboard the lunar
lander, plutonium which was supposed to be left on the moon but instead 
was brought back to Earth in a fireball somewhere near New Zealand.  We
currently buy our Plutonium 238 for our RTGs from Russia which means
its use involves unlicensed and unregulated (by U.S. agencies)
nuclear sources and transport halfway around the world prior to use. 
Dismal as our nuclear safety record has been, Russia's is far worse.
<p>
And as for using it on our Ulysses mission to the Sun --  doesn't it
seem strange that NASA could not even find a solar alternative for
that?
<p>
The fact that RTGs provided the power for past missions does not mean
it was the only solution that NASA could have used, and even if it
were, it no longer is.  Solar power works.  
<DL><DT><DD>
<i>Extensive studies conducted by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) have 
shown that NASA's Cassini mission, given its science objectives, available 
launch systems, travel time to its destination and Saturn's extreme distance 
from the Sun, requires RTGs.</i>
</DL>
Freedom of Information Act documents obtained by Karl Grossman show
that even NASA knows it has viable solar alternatives.  That makes
this statement a lie, and even if it were true, technology is improving 
as such a rate that it is <b>inconceivable</b> that a solar-powered 
solution would not be available within the next few years -- if only 
NASA would look for it.
<DL><DT><DD>
<H3>What Are RTGs?</H3>
<i>"RTGs are lightweight, compact spacecraft power systems that are extraordinarily 
reliable. RTGs are not nuclear reactors and have no moving parts. They use 
neither fission nor fusion processes to produce energy. Instead, they provide 
power through the natural radioactive decay of plutonium (mostly Pu-238, a 
non-weaponsgrade isotope). The heat generated by this natural process is 
changed into electricity by solid-state thermoelectric converters. RTGs enable 
spacecraft to operate at significant distances from the Sun or in other areas 
where solar power systems would be infeasible. They remain unmatched for power 
output, reliability and durability by any other power source for missions to 
the outer solar system."</i>
</DL>
<p>
This paragraph contains several falsehoods.  First of all, there is no 
"natural" radioactive decay of plutonium.  The term in inappropriate.  
Plutonium does not exist in nature!  Every ounce of plutonium, the most 
dangerous substance known to man, was created by man.  Hard to believe, 
isn't it?  So while other radioactive substances have a "natural"
decay rate, plutonium's radioactive properties should not be thus described.
It's a little thing, to be sure.  Pure semantics.  But why do the
semantics always seem to fall "their" way?  
<p>
Second, it is simply not true that solar energy would not work. 
Additionally, new developments in computer and
machine and micromachine technology are reducing the required power 
consumption of <b>virtually every component</b> on board Cassini.  In fact,
considering how long Cassini has been in development, it is probable
that more modern off-the-shelf components would use much less power than
the RTG's are designed to deliver!  
<p>
<DL><DT><DD>
<H3>Safety Design</H3>
<i>The United States has an outstanding record of safety in using RTGs on 23 
missions over the past three decades. While RTGs have never caused a spacecraft 
failure on any of these missions, they have been on-board three missions which 
experienced malfunctions for other reasons. In all cases, the RTGs performed as 
designed.</i>
</DL>
The fact that they performed as designed is irrelevant.  The fact
is that in just 23 missions, 3 were failures.  (Or, as NASA puts it,
"experienced malfunctions", but don't forget what an explosion 
like the Challenger is to NASA: a "malfunction.")  That's a lousy
percentage.  Why put humanity at such risk for those lousy odds?
<p>
Also, even if every previous mission had been a success, that would
prove nothing (but NASA would make big of it, you could be sure.) 
For even I do not argue that the odds are against the worst-case
scenario.  But look, if you do something that has a 1 in a million
chance of killing a million people, those are simply bad odds.  No
two ways around that fact!  NASA argues that various Cassini failure modes
have such long odds, but they are just speculating.  The fact is, in
23 missions, 3 "malfunctions".  <b>So what</b> if the RTG's weren't to
blame?  They were there, and they didn't have to be.  It's like the
guy that brings a weapon to a crime scene.  Even if he doesn't
use it, bringing the weapon makes it much more of a crime.  A bar
fight, and a bar fight where weapons are drawn, are very different criminal
cases.  NASA should put its weapons away.  There's no fight going on.
<P>
<DL><DT><DD>
<i>More than 30 years have been invested in the engineering, safety analysis and 
testing of RTGs. Safety features are incorporated into the RTG's design, and 
extensive testing has demonstrated that they can withstand physical conditions 
more severe than those expected from most accidents.
<p>
First, the fuel is in the heat-resistant, ceramic form of plutonium dioxide, 
which reduces its chance of vaporizing in fire or reentry environments. This 
ceramic-form fuel is also highly insoluble, has a low chemical reactivity, and 
primarily fractures into large, non-respirable particles and chunks. These 
characteristics help to mitigate the potential health effects from accidents 
involving the release of this fuel.</i>
</dl>
From most accidents.  Not all accidents.  Just most of them.  What
does that mean--51 out of 100 accidents?  That's most. NASA, can you
possibly be any less clear on what you really think the odds are? 
There is no way NASA has engineered a solution to the problems of
a shallow accidental reentry or that of a random collision with space
debris.  Neither of these are "remote possibilities".  The future space
station is expected to be hit by a major piece of space debris -- one
too big to build in protection against -- once every 50 years.  That's 
not remote.  That's a dangerous mission.  But Cassini is endangering us
all, not just the highly paid and highly trained adventurers and
risk-takers we all admire called astronauts.
<DL><DT><DD>
<i>Second, the fuel is divided among 18 small, independent modular units, each 
with its own heat shield and impact shell. This design reduces the chances of 
fuel release in an accident because all modules would not be equally impacted 
in an accident.</i>
</dl>
When you are dealing with a substance so
deadly that less than 1/70 of the Cassini load is enough to kill
everyone on Earth "if properly distributed" and high-altitude
incineration is just the ticket to proper distribution, dividing it into
18 smaller groups is hardly comforting!  Dividing 72.3 pounds 
of plutonium into 18 "small" units means four pounds of plutonium in
each one, and that's not small and that's no safety feature at all--each 
module can kill everybody at least four times over!  Not one of these 
"modules" should be risked in upper-atmosphere incineration!

<i>Third, multiple layers of protective materials, including iridium capsules and 
high-strength graphite blocks, are used to protect the fuel and prevent its 
accidental release. Iridium is a metal that has a very high melting point and 
is strong, corrosion resistant and chemically compatible with plutonium 
dioxide. These characteristics make iridium useful for protecting and 
containing each fuel pellet. Graphite is used because it is lightweight and 
highly heat-resistant.</i>
</dl>
43,000 miles an hour is how fast Cassini will be traveling on the
flyby --  the fastest large object man has ever propelled anywhere.  At
that speed, passing too close to Earth during the flyby could result
in friction temperatures which would demolish the spacecraft and quite 
possibly damage the plutonium cargo.  Collision at that speed with any of 
the <b>millions of pieces of space debris</b> which man has already placed 
in orbit can pulverize the RTGs protective covering.  NASA <b>knows
this</b> and  they aren't mentioning it.  They have decided that any 
hazard they cannot fix is irrelevant.  To NASA, "unlikely" and 
"impossible" are the same thing.  They aren't.  Cassini is a game of
chance in which the winners are the nuclear space industry and the
losers are you and I and every other living thing on Earth.
<DL><DT><DD>
<i>Potential RTG accidents are sometimes mistakenly equated with accidents at 
nuclear power plants. It is completely inaccurate to associate an RTG accident 
with Chernobyl or any other past radiation accident involving fission. RTGs do 
not use either a fusion or fission process and could never explode like a 
nuclear bomb under any accident scenario. Neither could an accident involving 
an RTG create the acute radiation sickness similar to that associated with 
nuclear explosions.</i>
</dl>
It is presumably true that RTG's cannot explode.  But they absolutely
<b>can</b> burn up on reentry.  The plutonium will then disperse
throughout Earth's atmosphere.  If it does this, cancers and 
other sicknesses will occur throughout the
world.  Acute Radiation Sickness would <b>not</b> occur.  <b>So what?</b>
No one is mistaking anything here, except NASA.  Plutonium spread in fine
particles throughout the upper atmosphere not only CAN happen, it HAS
happened.  And if we don't stop the madness, it WILL happen again,
and again, and again.  Not just Cassini, but <b>every</b> nuclear mission is
a crapshoot.  
<p>
Additionally, it is hardly comforting that NASA has endeavored 
so hard to ensure that the plutonium pods will be intact upon impact.  
If these intact pods are found by terrorist groups they could be used 
for a number of hostage and ransom purposes, even if you could not make 
a nuclear weapon with them.  If found by children or other living things, 
they could certainly be mishandled.  Even if they do survive the burning 
reentry, final impact could still break them into thousands of irretrievable 
pieces even if they are not "vaporized".  Any confined area would surely be
devastated by the needless introduction of 72.3 pounds of plutonium
chunks -- cities, lakes, rivers, reservoirs, stadiums, schools...
<P>
<DL><DT><DD>
<i>
NASA places the highest priority on assuring the safe use of plutonium in space.  
Thorough and detailed safety analyses are conducted prior to launching NASA 
spacecraft with RTGs, and many prudent steps are taken to reduce the risks 
involved in NASA missions using RTGs. In addition to NASA's internal safety 
requirements and reviews, missions that carry nuclear material also undergo an 
extensive safety review involving detailed verification testing and analysis. 
Further, an independent safety evaluation of the Cassini mission will be
performed as part of the nuclear launch safety approval process by an 
Interagency Nuclear Safety Review Panel (INSRP), which is supported by experts 
from government, industry and academia.</i>
</dl>
NASA uses the nuclear option in the first place.  <b>That's</b> the mistake.  
Any other plan for safety is going to fall short of the goal of
flying the safest possible missions.  True safety is achievable.  
Plutonium does not belong in space.  The so-called
experts are people from the nuclear government, the nuclear industry,
and the engineering academia who want to see their little science
experiments fly.  I believe most physicians who have studied the
issue are required by their own Hippocratic Oath ("First,
do no harm") to oppose risking the spread of plutonium throughout the 
environment when there is no significant benefit to mankind.  
<p>
<DL><DT><DD>
<H3>Non-Nuclear Alternatives to RTGs</H3>
<i>JPL studies have concluded that neither fuel cells nor spacecraft batteries 
demonstrate the operational life needed for planetary missions, whose duration 
can exceed 10 years from launch. In addition, the large mass of batteries that 
would be needed to power a mission such as Cassini greatly exceeds current 
launch vehicle lift capabilities.</i>
</DL>
As mentioned previously, power requirements of computer and
mechanical devices are dropping rapidly due to improvements in
ceramics, chip design, and wiring techniques (many of these
improvements, of course, are coming right out of NASA!)  If we could
wait a mere decade and do this safely, why not?  Why not put the scientists
to work on low-energy, high-efficiency devices that would ease power
consumption requirements not just for NASA, but for everyone else? 
NASA can do this.  They know they can do this and we want them to do
this.  Part of NASA's original and ongoing purpose has <b>always</b>
supposedly been to create technology we can use on Earth.  
Plutonium-powered RTGs have no use on Earth, and will never be used 
on Earth.  If NASA would help develop solar technology, on the other
hand, that would have great usefulness here.
<P>
<DL><DT><DD>
<i>JPL's rigorous analysis has also taken into account the advances in solar power 
technologies that have occurred over the last decade. The conclusion reached by 
the researchers at JPL is that solar technology is still not capable of 
providing sufficient and reliable electrical power for the Cassini mission. The 
mass of solar arrays required would make the spacecraft too heavy for available 
launch vehicles. Even if a sufficiently powerful launch vehicle were available 
for an all-solar Cassini, other limitations exist with current and near-term 
solar technologies, including:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>The behavior of solar cells at vast distances from the Sun is not 
well understood and would add significant risk to the success of a 
solar-powered mission to Saturn. Saturn is located approximately 1.42 billion 
kilometers (882 million miles) from the Sun, nearly twice as far from the Sun 
as Jupiter, the next closest planet.
<LI>The size of solar arrays that would be needed, about one-quarter 
the area of a football field, would not only be difficult to deploy reliably, 
but would significantly increase the orbiter's moments of inertia, making turns 
and other timely maneuvers extraordinarily difficult to perform This would 
severely inhibit Cassini's ability to achieve its science objectives.
<LI>The large arrays would seriously interfere with the fields of view 
of many of the science experiments and navigation sensors, further limiting 
the Cassini mission's ability to achieve the science objectives.
<LI>Large arrays could generate serious electromagnetic and 
electrostatic interference, which would adversely impact the operation of the 
science experiments and the spacecraft's communications equipment and computers.</i>
</OL>
</dl>
So these are things you <b>work on</b>, NASA -- not things you give
up on! All of these problems are solvable in due time --  not one is
an insurmountable wall.  There is no need to risk the use of
plutonium for these excuses.  If you folks over at NASA are so
inventive and such geniuses, why did you give up so easily?  Even
the Ulysses mission to the Sun wasn't solar powered--are we supposed
to believe you are even trying?  If the behavior of solar cells at
vast distances from the sun is not well understood, then
<b>that's</b> what your next mission should study!  Low power consumption
devices and low light solar cells are needed by everyone -- NASA
could be the heroic knight in shining armor coming to save us through
technology -- but they aren't even trying.  Instead they are trying
to get away with stuff they know is dangerous.  We give them billions
of dollars and this is their response -- secrecy, obfuscation, lies.

balanced view, to link to our site as we have linked to theirs!!</b>

<H3>Cassini's Earth Swingby</H3>
<i>By aiming a spacecraft so that it passes very close to a planet or moon, it 
is possible to boost the spacecraft on to still more distant destinations with 
greater velocity. Called the &quot;slingshot effect&quot; or, more properly, a 
gravity-assist swingby,
this maneuver has become an established method of launching massive, 
instrument-laden spacecraft to the outer planets. Cassini plans to make use 
of this technique when it swings by Venus twice, then the Earth and Jupiter to 
reach its ultimate destinaton of Saturn.
<p>
The Earth swingby does not represent a substantial risk to Earth's 
population because the probability of a reentry during the maneuver is 
extremely low, less than one in one million. NASA's robotic planetary 
spacecraft have performed numerous similar maneuvers with extraordinary 
precision. The redundant design of Cassini's systems and navigational 
capability allows control of the swingby altitude at Earth to within an 
accuracy of 3 to 5 kilometers (2 to 3 miles) at an altitude of approximately 
500 kilometers (310 miles).
<P>
In addition, NASA has taken specific actions to design the spacecraft and 
mission in such a way as to ensure the probability of Earth impact is less than 
one in one million. For example, until 10 days before the Earth swingby, the 
spacecraft is on a trajectory that, without any further maneuvers, would miss 
the Earth by thousands of kilometers. The biased trajectory also strictly 
limits the possibility that random external events (such as a micrometeoroid 
puncture of a spacecraft propellant tank) might lead to Earth impact.</i>
</dl>
Aiming off to the side until ten days before the Earth swingby sounds
like a safety procedure, and to some extent it is, but the fact is
that doing it this way can actually <i>increase</i> the danger to
mankind.  How?  Simply this:  To make the swingby work, they will
HAVE TO perform a manuever which forces Cassini towards Earth.  If
they fire the rocket for even a second or two longer than they
should, the Cassini probe will be forced towards an upper Earth
atmosphere incineration.  Understeer can be just as deadly as
oversteer.  This is not a safe manuever at all but is presented as
such to give us the impression that they have done all they can. 
They haven't.
<p>
Also, it should not go unmentioned that ten days out, when they start
to manuever towards Earth, they will be approximately 10 million
miles from Earth.  At that distance the target area is something in
the neighborhood of about 1/10,000 (one ten thousandth) of a 
percent of one degree away from Earth itself, whose entire 
cross-section takes up less than 1/5th of one degree on
Cassini's horizon.  Talk about putting it in the barrel.  This is a
knothole at a million paces.
<p>
Lastly, to call this "an established method of launching massive, 
instrument-laden spacecraft to the outer planets" is begging
complacency from familiarity.  We've done it a few times in the
past, it's true.  And it's worked those few times.  That hardly is an
"established method."   The shuttle was an "established method of
launch" prior to the Challenger disaster which NASA claimed would have
a 1 in 100,000 failure rate.  Now NASA says about 1 in 73 shuttle
missions will fail on average.  If you are boldly going where no man
has gone before, NASA, you aren't "established" in anything.  
<DL><DT><DD>
<H3>Radiation Hazards of Plutonium-238</H3>
<i>Isotopes of plutonium such as Pu-238 characteristically give off short-range 
alpha particles, helium nuclei that usually travel no more than about three 
inches in air. While the fuel is contained within its iridium capsule, the 
alpha radiation does not present a hazard, and the external dose resulting 
from the low levels of gamma and neutron radiation associated with the 
plutonium dioxide RTG fuel generally would not represent a significant health 
hazard, either. External alpha radiation would be stopped by clothing, an outer 
layer of unbroken skin, or even a sheet of paper. The point at which Pu-238 can 
become a health hazard is when it is deposited into the body.
<P>
If an individual were to inhale plutonium dioxide particles of a 
sufficiently small size to be deposited and retained in proximity to living 
lung tissues, the alpha radiation could alter or kill nearby living cells. 
Over years or decades, the altered cells could become cancerous and form 
tumors in the lung. Additionally, some of this material could be dissolved in 
body fluids and transferred by the blood to be deposited in other organs, 
generally the liver and skeleton, with similar potential consequences. The 
ceramic form of plutonium used in RTGs, however, is not likely to shatter into 
fine particles that could be readily inhaled. Other exposure pathways, such as 
ingestion, contribute far less to health effects.
<P>
The ceramic form of plutonium dioxide fuel also has low solubility in water, 
so its migration in ground water and potential for uptake by plants is limited. 
The actual proportion of plutonium released from an RTG that could enter the 
food chain, if any, is small.</i>
</DL>
What's wrong here?  This: upper-atmosphere incineration is a
perfectly plausible possibility.  It is only by denying that possibility 
that they can claim any reduced risk from capsule containment, 
external doses, or nuclear safety through clothing and unbroken skin. 
Inhalation is the danger here, NASA, inhalation from incinerated RTG's.  
Furthermore even if it lands largely intact, we all have broken skin on 
occasion and do not all wear full-body clothes all the time.  Someone 
should tell NASA this. 
<DL><DT><DD>
<i>A common misconception is that a small amount of plutonium, such as one 
pound, if evenly distributed over the entire world, could induce lung cancer 
in every person on Earth. While plutonium can alter or kill living cells if 
deposited directly onto sensitive human tissue, the important point is that it 
must be in a form that enables environmental transport and intake by humans. 
Research has demonstrated that the mechanisms of plutonium dispersion into and 
transport through the environment, and hence in to humans, are extremely 
inefficient.</i>
</DL>
<P>
This is flat-out wrong.  First of all, grammatically, they say in the
first sentence that this is "a common misconception."  What they go
on to say is that it is not a misconception at all but rather, they
claim they will not disperse the plutonium that way -- "the important
point is that is must be in a form that enables environmental
transport and intake by humans."  So what they actually argue in the 
paragraph just cited is that they will not disperse the plutonium in 
a manner which will allow intake by humans --NOT that there are any
misconceptions about the hazards of plutonium!
These are two very different points!
<p>
In fact, NASA can do <b>nothing</b> to ensure prevention of
distribution of the plutonium in just about the most efficient means 
possible short of clinical inhalation or injection -- which of course,
the government actual did in the 40's and 50's.  NASA has not, can
not, and will not be able to guarantee that the RTG's will not
incinerate in a shallow descent to Earth, will not be hit by one of
the millions of pieces of space debris that they have already placed
in Near Earth Orbit on previous missions, and will not be blown to
smithereens in a launch explosion.  Yes, they have strived to reduce
the risks on all of these things.  But the one thing they could have
done to <b>eliminate the risks</b> they have not done -- which is, of
course, to <b>not use plutonium</b> in the first place.  Why accept a
level of risk at all when the plutonium is absolutely <i>not</i> 
"mission critical"?  
<p>
<h2>Plutonium has no place in space.</h2>
And no place on Earth, either.  Stop manufacturing this junk.

All stories we write and place at this web site are true in all their

this site, it will be clearly marked as such.  However, to maintain the
privacy of individuals involved, cities, places, times, etc. are not
given in most instances, and we ask you <i>not</i> to invade people's 
privacy in these matters by trying to ascertain the details
of these stories.  For example, our 
<a href="/misc/stories/jobs/jobworld.htm">REAL WORLD</a> series on work 
are 'just' stories, and probably could be fiction and be just as 
interesting (if you find them interesting at all).  Trust me
or don't, as you see fit, but don't bother to find out.  It's
invasive and ill-mannered and a waste of time.  The stories are true.

Serious comedy or none at all.  Almost.  For the worst of it,
probably you should check out the 
<a href="/misc/quote_me.htm">quotes page.</a>  Someday I might
upload audio files of some 'environmental' comedy routines I wrote
some decades ago, which were played on the Dr. Demento Show and other
stations around the world in the late seventies and early eighties.
But that's ancient history...

<h3><a name="site_metrics">The Metric System</a></h3>
The metric system is accomodated whenever possible, but in general it
is assumed that our foreign visitors will forgive our usage of the 
'English' measuring system.  Some day perhaps I will be convinced
that everything should be 'decimated' (that word is being used in a 
jocular fashion here) but for now, I still believe
that 12 inches to a foot, three feet to the yard, and 5280 feet to
the mile makes a lot of sense.  Call it one of my many shortcomings. 
<p>
There are about 2 1/2 centimeters to the inch, a meter is just over a
yard, and a kilometer is about 6/10's of a mile.  An ounce is about 
28 grams, a kilogram is about 2.2 pounds, and a liter is about a quart.  
That's close enough.  These are things I believe every American schoolchild 
is at least vaguely aware of. I have used rulers 
with both scales on them since I was knee-high to a grasshopper and 
I find it is usually easier to identify a measurement on the 'English' scale.  
Maybe non-U.S. rulers should carry both scales, like ours usually do.

<h3><a name="site_outside_links">Outside Links</a></h3>
Although we generally do not link to a site that promotes <i>any</i> abusive 
behavior, criminal activities, lies, or anything immoral, illegal or
fattening, it is possible that some sites we link to do have some
amount of such things, or themselves "link through" to something offensive. 
We would not expect a large site to be in perfect synchronization with 
our own morals (or yours) and we feel it is reasonable to forgive a 
certain level of impropriety or transgression, as we would hope 
you (and other sites that link to us) would forgive the same things in us. 
Be excessive only in tolerance.
<p>
However, we do recommend that you yourself choose the applicability of each
outside link for it's educational value for your students.  We
cannot be responsible for what appears at web sites we link to, let alone
what appears at web sites they themselves might link to.  It's a
<i>web</i> and you just have to be careful.

<p>
<i>Russell Hoffman ("Host")</i>, <i>High Tech Today</i>
<br>
<b>Eddie Paul ("EP"), Inventor, ex-stuntman.</b>
<hr>
<p>
<i>Host:  Good morning.  This is High Tech Today with your host Russell Hoffman... 
My guest today is Eddie Paul of EP Industries in El Segundo,
California.  I wish I could simply say that Eddie Paul is a this, or
a that.  He's an inventor.  He's also a stunt developer for the
movies.  He's done stunts for dozens of movies, everything from ET to
Soylent Green.  He's done commercials for Coors and Budwieser and
Mitsubishi.  He's done TV shows for Jacques Cousteau--he invented a
shark as a matter of fact, and we'll talk about that later.  Sharks
of course have been around for hundreds of millions of years but it
took Eddie Paul to simplify it and mechanize it.  Welcome to the show!
</i>
<p>
<b>EP</b>:  Thank you!
<p>
<i>Host:  We're going to talk about a new invention that you've got,
a Cylindrical Energy Module, which is a pump.  And it's not often, I
think, that people invent something new in the field of pumps,
because pumps have been around for thousands of years.  So, why don't
we start by discussing that, and then we'll go into some of the
exciting things you've done in past with your stunt work, and talk
about whatever else comes to our mind.
</i>
<p>
<b>EP</b>:  OK, Great...Yeah, I did this pump--what I did is, like
you mentioned, I've been in the movie business for quite a while,
quite a few different things:  Hang gliding movies, built cars,
directed, stunt coordinated--anyway, my wife told me to settle down
one day, to pick one thing and stick with it.  
<p>
Since most of the movie business was inventing, like when we do
special effects we had to invent a way to make a car flip over and
land without hurting anyone.  So, I took one of my ideas, and said
"Well, I'm just going to take this and I'm going to follow through"
and it happened to be the pumps, because I realized that pumps hadn't changed
in about a hundred years.
<p>
So I looked at the basic design, threw out everything that I had
learned, started all over again and said "This is how I would build a
pump to move a liquid, or a gas or whatever", and designed from the
ground up.  And I've had pretty good success with it.  We've got a
pump right now that produces about ten times the volume of a
compatible-weight pump.  We call it the C.E.M., Cylindrical Energy
Module and we've got quite a bit of excitement out of it.  We've
produced our first ten prototypes, and we had the fire department
stop by the other day from the town we live in, El Segundo.  When
they came by they said they could only spend about five minutes
looking at the pump because they were busy. 
<p>
They were there two and a half hours and we had to finally ask them
to leave because we wanted to close down the shop!  That's kind of
been the excitement level of everyone who see's it.
<p>
<i>Host:  Now, the Cylindrical Energy Module, from what I understand,
your decision was to design a pump, and THEN you came up with the Cylindrical Energy
Module.  It's the most beautiful pump--I mean, it's so simple, I've
seen it folks and it's just gorgeous.  But what you're saying, really
is that for you, the art of inventing follows in the direction that
you're interested in going in--it's not so much, an idea comes to you
and then you develop it, it's more like, you decide where you want to
have an idea.
</i>
<p>
<b>EP</b>:  Right, it's like...  I see people who could sit at a
piano and play something.  If I had to play something if my life was
at stake I'd be dead now!  
<p>
But I can take any kind of problem--for some
reason I look at something and say "Well, here's an easier way to do
it."  And it's sometimes hard to keep my mouth shut!  You
know--people show me things, and say "look at this!  Isn't this
neat?"  And I want to say something (laughs)--because sometimes it
isn't!  Sometimes it could be simpler.  And what I've done, is
focus on making things as absolutely simple as possible, because most
people complicate things.
<p>
I've noticed that if you put 15 engineers on any kind of project, it's going to have at least 15
parts.  It has to, because everybody has to have a job to do, so they
have to create something!
<p>
My job is:  We keep everything simple.  Like when we design something
with our company, usually I tackle it alone, and I make it an
absolute--build with as absolutely few parts as possible.  I'll let
one part do many things if possible.  Like in our pump, we actually
have an engine version of it that we're playing with--a gasoline
engine.  And the body, the inner body, becomes the flywheel.  We have
no crankshaft.  We have a camshaft, we have no crankshaft, we have no
connecting rods, we have no piston rings.  We've thrown out almost
every part of an engine!  We don't have any valves--we use ports.  We
use one glow plug for six cylinders on each end, so we have two
glow plugs for twelve cylinders instead of putting in twelve
glow plugs.  So, we've got it down to it's simplest form and what
I'm trying to do now is even reduce that to fewer parts.
<p>
So on our pump--one of the things you haven't seen yet--is we have a
pump that we believe we can eliminate about four parts on it and
we're just now filing for patents on it.
<p>
<i>Host:  Eliminate four parts out of a seven part pump?
</i>
<p>
<b>EP</b>:  Yeah!  Well, our pump does 24 pump cycles per revolution
of the drive shaft and has seven moving parts.  So when we first
started talking to pump companies that got us through a lot of doors. 
Everybody thought our math was off.  Just by the design, we
have a double-headed piston.  So it pumps at each end--it's
basically a rod, and then it does two pump cycles per revolution. 
So it lines up with six cylinders and you can get 24 pump cycles per
revolution.  So that's how we wind up getting the big volumes.
<p>
<p>
<i>Host: ...Let's talk a little bit about the process of inventing. 
How long ago did you come up with this particular idea, and how long
did it take to get the patent?
</i>
<p>
<b>EP</b>:  The pump I came up with--that's hard to say
because a lot of times I'm working on--like right now, I probably
have a hundred different inventions I'm working on at once.  
<p>
I gather in my mind, or I'll make notes, and jot down some ideas, and
if I hit any kind of stumbling block I just kind of set it aside and
don't push it, and I go on to something else.  And most of the time,
I get an idea on one invention while I'm working on another one.  So,
I guess the development pretty much came instantaneous once I really
sat down and put all my thoughts together, I had it within about a
week.  But it's a problem that I'd thought about since I was a kid,
as far as gasoline engines, I was trying to design a lighter weight
gasoline engine.  
<p>
And the actual process didn't take that long--I think it was two to
three years to get the patent.  We've put most of our time and money
into protecting the patent.  We have patent insurance now.  We
patented it as well as we could.  We've put a corporation together,
with corporate attorneys, and patent attorneys for our company and we
have a communications director.  We've put a sales staff together. 
<p>
Just recently we purchased a machine shop to build the prototypes.
<p>
<i>Host:  My guest today is Eddie Paul from EP Industries.  He's an
inventor, and used to be a stunt coordinator and stuntman for all
kinds of Hollywood productions, TV, movies, commercials, MTV Videos. 
I noticed you taught "Twisted Sister" band members how to ride
Harleys!...
<p>
The pump itself--it's very hard to describe it over the radio.  But
basically, it's a circular--it has a rotor and a stator.  And within
the rotor there are pistons that go back and forth and pump on both
sides of the piston, so they have a cam that follows a sinusoidal
camshaft around [the stator]...
<p>
[break...]
<p>
My guest today is Eddie Paul from EP Industries, and Eddie, one of
the inventions and shows that you did, for the Discovery Channel, you
did a shark suit, and for Jacques Cousteau you did a shark.
</i>
<p>
<b>EP</b>:  Um Hmm.
<p>
<i>Host: So tell us about these things.
</i>
<p>
<b>EP</b>:  Okay.  We did the shark first.  That was a few years ago. 
I worked for Jean Michele Cousteau for about four or five years designing
equipment for them.  We did their underwater lighting, using 110
volts and 220 volts AC underwater lighting.  So we put a system
together for them.  And we were in, I believe, Valdez, at the oil
slick doing a show on that, and we were all sitting around dinner,
and Jean Michele was asking everybody questions, and he asked me, "What's one project you've wanted to do? 
If you had you're choice what would you do?"
<p>
I said "I've always wanted to build a mechanical shark.  They
look neat.  I'd like to duplicate the swimming action of a shark."
<p>
Didn't think much more about it.  About a year later I got a phone
call--I was working on another project for a film and I got a call
from Jean Michele--actually it was his assistant--saying Jean Michele
wants you to start building a shark.  And when we were in Alaska we
were talking about a five foot--actually it was smaller, it was a
two and a half foot Blue Shark.  So as soon as he said he wanted me
to build a shark I assumed it was that one since they were also
filming Blue Sharks in the Pacific out here.  So I started, I think,
that night, started building a shark and the next day I had one built
as a mockup.  It was a two and a half foot Blue Shark.  He came over,
looked at it, and said "Oh, that's very nice. But, could you make one
bigger?  We wanted a ten foot Great White Shark!"  So we had to scrap
it and start over again, and I guess it took us about two weeks, and
at the end of the two weeks we had a skeleton for a shark that was
made of Lexan, we made the skin out of a material called Skin-Flex,
that we use in the studios for skin.  We painted--airbrushed it all
up so that it looked like a Great White Shark.  It even had the
teeth--were all serrated and everything, and the jaws would open and
close.  We put it in a box and shipped it to Australia.  And then I
had to fly down to operate it.
<p>
We got to Dangerous Reef, which is just out of Adelaide, Australia,
and went out with Rodney Fox on his boat, went out to where the Great
White Sharks live, put it in the water and tested it.  And it worked
pretty good.  We swam with the sharks for three days.  Actually I
used tail propulsion, figuring it was the simplest way to make it
swim, was do what the sharks do.  So we had the tail move back and
forth, and I powered off a SCUBA tank.  So I would run compressed air
to the shark through an umbilical, a small quarter inch line.  It
would move the tail back and forth on command as I moved a little
toggle control.  And, if I wanted to go straight I would just move the
tail back and forth rhythmically.  If I wanted to turn left I would
hold the tail to the left one beat longer to the left than to the
right.  If I wanted to go right I would do the same thing.  And as it
would hold the tail for a second it would act as a rudder and it
would start turning left or right.
<p>
To go up or down, we had an inner tube inside of the shark that I'd
pump air into from another valve, and then let air out so it would
tilt up or down.  Anyway, it was a success.  We swam with the sharks
for three days.  They seemed to accept it.  And then on the third
day, he wanted to get a spectacular shot and asked if I could make it
act injured.  So, we put a lead weight to one side and then I made it
swim erratically, and within FIVE seconds it was attacked and torn to
shreds by another shark.  We've got it all on film, and I guess the
show was exactly what they wanted!  So it was kind of a fun project.
<p>
<i>Host:  That's incredible.  Now, is that the model I saw when I was
at your shop?  Is that the small one?
</i>
<p>
<b>EP</b>:   Yeah, that's the one that we decided not to use.
<p>
<p>
<i>Host:  Folks, I've got to tell you:  This shark that he built is
the image of simplicity.  It's just a bunch of Lexan ribs or plates,
and the articulation is done through two wires that come from the
head all the way to the tail and they pull on the tail, and the thing
just flexes back and forth.  It's unbelievable simple, and I guess
that's a hallmark of your work.  It's almost hard to be proud of the
things you do because they're so simple you'd think anybody could of
thought of them and actually, that's what makes them so beautiful.
<p>
My guest today is Eddie Paul from EP Industries and he's talking
about his many and varied activities in his life.  Among the
experiences that you've had--we've got listed here: SCUBA diving,
piloting most aircraft, hang gliding, bulldozers, tanks, trucks,
motorcycles, rappelling, climbing, firearms, fist fights,
knives...what's the most dangerous thing that happened, in what would
be an otherwise dull career? (ho ho!)
</i>
<p>
<b>EP</b>:  The most dangerous thing I've ever done?  Probably dating, before I got married!
<p>
<i>Host: (Laughs.)
</i>
<p>
<b>EP</b>: No, the rest of it, it isn't that dangerous, the stuff we
do for the studios.  Most of the time you rehearse it so much and you
do safety precautions.  I mean, any one of those things, I can
describe in detail.  They're pretty darn safe.  I got my worst
injury I guess on a movie called MASK, and I was doing one of the
simplest stunts.  Most people didn't even know the movie MASK was a
stunt movie!  But, it had a little bit of stunts in it.  That was
the one with Cher and Sam Elliot and we were doing a real simple
fight scene.
<p>
<i>Host:  This is not THE MASK, with Jim Carrey, but prior to that, a
movie just called MASK.
</i>
<p>
<b>EP</b>: This is an older one.  I had what I called a minor fall,
and tore my shoulder out and was in surgery for about six months out
of it.  But on other things, you know--we've done some hellacious car
crashes and walked away without a scratch.  But I think it's mostly
because you do a lot more planning on the dangerous ones because you
know they're dangerous.  It's the simple little things you get hurt
on, like stepping off a curb or getting out of your car.  I don't
really consider any of it dangerous.  I guess the thing with the shark
was a little dangerous, because we didn't know what the Great Whites
would do.
<p>
The shark suit you mentioned earlier, that was a little dangerous,
because we didn't have time to prepare.  That was a documentary we
did for Discovery Channel, where I had the idea that you can
built a plastic shark suit to hold off shark bites, and we had to test
it.  We only had one day to build the suit and had to test it the
next day.  And didn't get to test it without--we actually had to go
in the water and test it so, we put the shark suit on and went down
and got chewed on by, I think it was fourteen sharks.
<p>
And when you have that many sharks, it's pretty much--you're out of
control because, even if they don't bite through the suit, they have
so much power that they can just drag you off and take you somewhere. 
You'd run out of air and drown.  And at one point I had--I made a
mistake, we had one shark come up and I was trying to scare him off
so I punched at him, and because of the suit my arm was moving so
slow through the water that I managed to swing at his mouth--he
opened his mouth, [and] I shoved my arm down his throat.  He clamped down
on my shoulder and took off with me.  And while he was swimming
through the water with me I'm getting chomped on by other sharks. 
That was a little scary, because we were also near what they call a
dropoff where the water drops to about three thousand feet, and I
didn't know if he was going to go up over the hill and down to the
bottom, in which case I would have been a sardine!
<p>
So, those are the kinds of things that get a little scary but
fortunately it worked out alright.  I got loose.
<p>
<i>Host: All in a day's work for Eddie Paul, of EP Industries. Let's
got back to the Cylindrical Energy Module, one of my favorite things. 
When you first started building this, you sent out descriptions of it
to various pump manufacturers?  That's right?
</i>
<p>
<b>EP</b>: The press releases?
<p>
<p>
<i>Host:  Yeah, press releases and so forth.  And some of them wrote
back and told you it was impossible, right?
</i>
<p>
<b>EP</b>:  Oh yeah, we got--in fact, we got a letter the other day
from someone telling us (laughs) it's impossible!
<p>
<i>Host:  The other day?  Even though I've seen it running, but...
</i>
<p>
<b>EP</b>:  Oh yeah.  Yeah, we had one big company, I don't want to mention
their name...
<p>
<i>Host:  No.
</i>
<p>
<b>EP</b>:  They sent me about a three page letter.  Their top
engineer looked at it, gave me five reasons why it wouldn't work, and
insisted that I don't go any further, because I'd just be wasting any
money I had left.  It was kind of funny because we had a turnaround
and that company just purchased a pump from us for testing, and they
brought the engineer, had him apologize to us personally, which is
not a big deal, he was just doing what he'd been taught.
<p>
<i>Host:  This has got to be the dream of every inventor:  To have
the chief engineer of someone who turned you down come back and
apologize!
</i>
<p>
<b>EP</b>:  It was nice!  I actually felt bad for him, because,
again, he was just doing what he'd been taught.  They aren't taught to look at new
technologies.  
<p>
In the pump industry, we've found, it's like, they haven't had a new
invention in a hundred years so they're not prepared to see anything
new.  So I guess, they get hit with so many bogus ideas... 
<p>
<i>Host:  Okay.  You're listening to High Tech Today...
<p>
[break]...
<p>
My guest today is Eddie Paul of EP Industries.  Eddie Paul is an
inventor, a stunt coordinator--at least used to be a stuntman--a
retired stuntman, which I guess is a wonderful thing to be!
</i>
<p>
<b>EP</b>:  Uh Hh.
<p>
<i>Host:  It gives you a lot of memories.  Let's talk a little more
about the Cylindrical Energy Module, or CEM Pump, the Super Cem and so
forth, and let's talk about some of the applications that you've been
envisioning for this pump.  Do you want to tell us about, well, let's
look at fire fighting.  Why is this pump useful there?
</i>
<p>
<b>EP</b>:  Okay, we have a gentleman down in Maryland, who just
ordered 200 of these for fire fighting and what they're looking at is,
I guess for putting them in ponds and lakes and swimming pools.  That
it's so lightweight you can put it in a pool and fight fires with
pool water.  They're doing them for, I believe what they call
Standing Pipes, installing them in there.  He said "all kinds of
applications" but I believe it's going to be a portable unit.  The
one we have now, we just built ten prototypes.  They weigh 55 pounds
each, which replaces sump pumps that weight about 2,000 pounds.  And
our next goal is to try to get the 55 pounds down to about 10 pounds,
so we're experimenting with new plastics, so we should have a pump
that you can lift up with one hand, carry it anywhere and use it.
<p>
<i>Host:  Okay.  In automotive uses--the pump as an engine.
</i>
<p>
<b>EP</b>:  As an engine, we've built one for a company call Applied
Laser Systems in Medford, Oregon.  A small one that on computer puts
out about 28 horsepower and weighed about eight pounds.  The reason I
say "on computer" was, we only ran for short durations, and the
company that was funding it went out of business because of some
other investments they had, so we stopped the project.  The engine's
something we do on the side, because it's going to take millions of
dollars to develop.  But we've actually--that first one, we had developed
in six weeks, we actually had one running.  From concept to
completion.  So, we have a lot of hope for the engine, but what we're
trying to do is pursue pumps first, then go into compressors, then
gasoline engines.  And when we do get into the engines, what we're aiming
for is we're going to have an air cooled, lubrication free gasoline
engine that has two glow plugs for twelve cylinders and we should get
about three horsepower per pound.
<p>
<p>
<i>Host:  Now, also for use in Oil Wells.  This same pump is
particularly applicable because it can be dropped down the oil well.
</i>
<p>
<b>EP</b>: Uh Hh.  Since it's double ended, one end can be a pump or
compressor, the other end can be an engine.  Or, one end can be a
hydraulically driven motor, the other end could be a compressor or
pump.  It's got so many variations, plus, I think, one of the first
prototypes we did was actually four pumps in one.  You could pump
four different color fluids in and pump four different color fluids
out without mixing them.  We have other variations we can pull off. 
That was with the four cylinder pump.  Now, like I say most of them
are six cylinders. 
<p>
The applications--we have everything from--I don't know if I can say
this on the radio, but we got a call for a pen*ile implant all the way
up to a hundred and fifty thousand horsepower for producing electric
power for China.
<p>
<i>Host:  Well, this is the Nineties.  You can certainly say that.  
</i>
<p>
<b>EP</b>: Okay, good.
<p>
<p>
<i>Host:  Energy for China is perfectly alright in the nineties!
</i>
<p>
<b>EP</b>: We ran an article--a press release.  You mentioned the
press release earlier, I believe.  [Our] communications director
told us when you send out press releases, normally you get, out of
fifty press releases you might get one or two published.  Out of 120,
we had 115 of them published, which really surprised us.  Out of one
of those press releases, I believe it was Design News, we've gotten
8,000 responses.  So, it's pretty much a full-time job just keeping
up with the responses.  Trying to keep people happy and keep them at
bay until we're finished.
<p>
<p>
<i>Host:  Okay, we're almost out of time...  Eddie Paul has been my
guest on High Tech Today... If you want to see an animation of this
pump, get on America Online, or CompuServe [or our FTP site] and find 
out how to get hold of an animation of this pump we've been talking
about...Bye Bye!

<b>March 22nd, 1996</b>
<p>
<i>Russell Hoffman ("Host")</i>, <i>High Tech Today</i>
<br>
<b> Ed Taylor ("ET"), Author</b>
<hr>
<p>
<i>Host:  And you're listening to High Tech Today with your host,
Russell Hoffman.  My guest today is an author of several books on
using the Internet and marketing on the Internet.  The first one,
published last year with Vince Gelormine, was called How To Use The
Internet for an Almost Unfair Business Advantage, which is a great
title.  It's a wonderful book.  He has a new book out.  It's called
How To Give Good Internet.  I'm not so sure that's as wonderful a
title! (Both laugh.)  
<p>
But anyway, I had the privilege of meeting Ed
at a G.E.N.I. meeting, Global Energy Network International, where he
came and advised that non-profit organization on how to use the Web
to increase their presence worldwide--to increase the number of
people that know about them and also, how to raise money for the
nonprofit organization.  So Ed, first of all, let me welcome you to
the show.
</i>
<p>
<b>ET</b>:  Thank you Russell.  And let me address the title of this
book real quickly.  How to Give Good Internet, I thought was a catchy
title and I want to quickly add after that, that it's a special
report on exactly how to make money online, and no por.nographic
reference at all.  In fact I don't deal with any por.nographic
clients at all.  But I thought it was kind of a catchy name for a
special report and this new book is over a hundred pages of exactly how
people can use the Internet today to make money and to raise revenue
for non profits, etcetera.
<p>
<p>
<i>Host:  I think one of the things that I began to realize from
meeting you and reading your book and listening to you talk, is that
the methods that were popular, I guess on TV and radio and so
forth--there are definitely some differences in how to market on the
Internet.
</i>
<p>
<b>ET</b>:  Oh, it's incredible.  In fact, I hear all the time,
stories about these failures online.  People say "We went online, and
we really expected to make a lot of money, and we're glad we're
online, and we feel we should be there 'cause it's the right thing
to do, and..."  You know, there's a "Keeping up with the Jones's"
kind of mentality.  But there's a lot of businesses that are
disappointed with the results that they're getting online.  And I'll
tell you, the reason is, they're implementing a strategy that
doesn't make sense in that environment!  And for many, many
companies, they just don't recognize what you need to do, to be
successful online, and whatever 'successful' may mean, whether that's
increasing sales, or decreasing costs through a customer service
program or what have you, they are not implementing a strategy that's
been proven.
<p>
One of the first things that I did when I decided to go into the business
of training on Internet successes, I went out and studied successful
sites online.  In other words, I found sites that were producing
revenue, people that were making sales via the Internet and via
electronic marketing, and found out, what do these sites have in
common?
<p>
And, in time, a strategy essentially developed.  It became very very clear
that the successful sites were doing certain things that most of the
rest of the sights were not.  And that's exactly how we've developed
our books, and how we went about training people on how to be
successful online.  By modeling those that have gone before us.  And
we get a little bit creative from time to time, but with the thought
that we have a model in place, and then we will try to do something
to expand our results but if it doesn't work, at least we do have a
model in place that's creating revenue.
<p>
<i>Host:  Well, certainly the Internet is so big and so new, that
among the people that have succeeded, chances are that in many cases,
it's just chance.  Nobody has statistics, really, to back up--at
least long term statistics to back up what they're doing right.  So,
you've gone through and just kind of looked at people, and said, well
"This guy--This is working.  What is it that they're doing--"
</i>
<p>
<b>ET</b>:  ---right--
<p>
<i>Host:  --"that somebody else is also doing, that's working."
</i>
<p>
<b>ET</b>:  Well, what I did exactly was I went out and posted to a
number of different electronic news groups, and said "Do any of you
guys have Web sites, and if you do, are any of you making
any money? (laughs)  And I got a varied bunch of replies, as you can
imagine!  But every once in a while I'd get somebody that would come
back and say "Yeah, I'm making money.  It's pretty exciting." 
<p>
And I would go, and I would either personally interview the person,
I'd certainly go look at their web site.  Like, Pierette Van Cleve,
who is an example that I use often, the very first month that she put
her web site online, she did $35,000 in sales.  Now these are
brand-new sales.  These are sales that are altogether separate and
aside from any revenue she would have made, had she not developed
that web site.  And she did that her first month, and every month
since then now for fourteen months, she's never fallen below $35,000
in sales.  Now, that's an interesting success story.  And Pierette is
an incredibly brilliant woman, who implemented a strategy.  She's
been studying [the] Internet, and the use of the Internet, and who is
online, for a number of years before she launched her web site, and
she's just an absolute example of how to do things right, online.
<p>
And her web site, for people that might want to visit that, it's
called the <a href="http://www.artcellarex.com">Art Cellar Exchange</a>.  And if they want to
go check that out you'll see a sight that's producing revenue to this
day.  And of course, there are many many others.  
I have dozens of clients now, that are generating anywhere from several hundred to
several thousand dollars a month regularly online.  
But Pierette is just such a wonderful example of how to do that in a massive way. 
And she's an art broker.  She actually brokers art.  And another
interesting statistic or interesting fact that she likes to bring up,
is the number of high-profile people that visit her site. 
Essentially celebrities.  That would not probably go into a retail
outlet, that access her site online.  It's absolutely incredible. 
So--
<p>
<i>Host:  Yeah, certainly celebrities are, I mean, they might go into
a Greenwich or a La Jolla or something like that or a Midtown Manhattan
but you're not going to find them [just] anywhere in the world, not
too often, and yet on the World Wide Web, why, everybody is everywhere!
</i>
<p>
<b>ET</b>:  In the comfort of their own home, shop for whatever
they'd like to shop for, absolutely.
<p>
<i>Host:  Let's talk a little bit about some of the actual 'startling
facts' that you reveal.  I mean, I'm not going to ask you to reveal
them all, and besides we only have about twenty minutes!  But one
that was interesting to me, and maybe you can share this one with the
users, is the average World Wide Web user only scrolls down twenty
percent of the pages they go to!  And you say "Learn what you can do
to get a browser hooked!"  What are some examples of what you could
do there?
</i>
<p>
<b>ET</b>:  Well, there are--I'll give you some examples of what to
do, and certainly what <i>not</i> to do.  And, for the people that
have spent much time on the Internet you find, especially on the
World Wide Web, you find very very quickly, how heart wrenching it is
when things go slow!  If they have large graphics, or if you go to a
site and nothing happens, you sit there looking at a blank
screen--you just don't stay long.  I mean, none of us want to sit
there and wait and wait and wait for something to materialize on the
computer screen in front of us.  
<p>
So what I always suggest is that the
people, when they design the web site, design it so your text comes up
first.  And, if you have graphics or you have any large groups of
scanned in images of any kind, logos, whatever, let that come up, and
that's okay, as long as it's reasonably quick, I recommend that it
should all appear within twenty seconds, but certainly, get your text
part up first.  Give somebody something to read while the rest of the
stuff is materializing.  And ideally, hit him with something good.  A
strong hook.  Whatever the reason that you have a Web site--I hope
you have a good reason, and if you do, hook 'em!  Give them a good
headline.  There's nothing more important in any kind of marketing
than having a good headline.  And if you can get that to materialize,
and then some good bullet points or some good information underneath
that, people will wait, and become impressed as your page does
materialize.
<p>
<i>Host:  ...[break]...  back to our guest, Ed Taylor, author of How
to Give Good Internet, and other special reports, and we were talking
on the break about online ethics, and there's, somewhere, there's a
fine line between shameless promotion, and promotion.   And how do
you know where that line is?
</i>
<p>
<b>ET</b>:  Well,  I'll tell you, Russell.  What's happening is, and
I highly recommend this to anybody who's going to start marketing
online, and that is:  Get online, and join some news groups, and pay
attention to what's going on.  Don't go out, and blatantly start
trying to promote everything that you're doing everywhere
that you go.  What will happen is, you will get 'flamed'.  That's not
the way the Internet works.  And people need to realize that, that a
part is a subtlety to all this, and part of the beauty of it, at
the same time, is that this is really micro-marketing.  It's not mass
marketing, it's not network marketing.
<p>
In mass marketing, for example on television, you can create a catchy
ad, and if the guy's sitting on the sofa and doesn't get up and run
to the restroom or run to the kitchen during break, you might hook
him, and he might pay enough attention to your commercial to actually
buy the product.  I personally don't feel that most commercials evoke
that response, but that, that's a personal philosophy.
<p>
But on the Internet you certainly don't have the luxury of throwing
your message at an audience that isn't interested.  What you are
trying to do, is evoke these people to come to your site.  And what I
mean by that, is typically when you're online marketing, you'll
market to different news groups and user forums, etcetera, and those
news groups and user forums are developed as a way to share
information with, amongst people with like interests.
<p>
And even though one of my interests may be aviation, flying small
aircraft, what I could do on the bottom of each of my postings that I
might make to that group, I might put something on there that says
"Please check out my web site" or "Come to my web site at www.so and
so" or "For more information about..."
<p>
And that's a very passive, and a very acceptable way to make people
aware of the fact that you have a web site.  Now again, once you get
them to the web site, the web site better be very sales and marketing
oriented, and do all the right things that'll evoke the response that
you want.  But when you're out trying to get people to go to your
site, you want to be very subtle and you want to also make sure that
you're adding value to the people in the news groups that you're a
part of.  It's a society, a community, and those people that are
perceived to be the used car salesmen are not going to do well
online, and that's been very very evident.  They have a very active
self-policing online, and the people that have been flamed (laughs)
certainly are aware of the consequences of that!  I mean, this is not
a one-way medium. This is a two-way street.  So, yeah, I definitely
feel that the people that are doing well online recognize that you
have to play by the rules, and the rules are fairly clearly defined,
I feel.
<p>
<i>Host:  Before anybody gets too scared, you also go into advice on
what to do if you do get flamed.
</i>
<p>
<b>ET</b>:  Oh, sure, and that may happen.  I've been flamed, in a
very small way--I've never been flamed with thousands and thousands
of postings, like some of the horror stories!-- But I've had a few
people, that have taken offense at some of the posts that I've made,
and I've received fifteen or twenty, or even thirty comments back,
that say "hey, that was a pretty self-serving type of post" and
sometimes I would respond to those, and sometimes I wouldn't, again it
depends on the flavor of the person that sent the message.  But in
most cases if you are cautious in how you deliver your message, and
you do it in such a way that is not offensive and not too
blatant--people are going to love it--I mean, let's face it:  When we
get online, we're on line for the purpose of getting information. 
And if we're doing that--I mean, we don't want to be sold, that's not
the reason we're online, but we do want information.  And if we want
information, maybe pertaining to a particular product, we want that
information available to us.  We want to certainly know that it's
out there.  And again, it's certainly a very acceptable way to
promote your product.
<p>
A number of clients of mine are selling how to information.  A lot of
books, and tapes, and those kinds of things.  And, they are selling
anywhere from several hundred dollars to--I have one client who's
doing eight or nine thousand a month in sales, so, it really works. 
And when I say $9,000 a month in sales, this is a woman out of
Dallas, Texas, who is selling a total package of a bunch of different
weight loss products, all for in the 149 dollar range, so you can see
that she's creating a lot of sales per month, to do that kind of
volume.  It does work.  It's a very very effective marketing medium, and
very very cost effective at the same time.
<p>
<i>Host:  ...[break]... My guest today is Ed Taylor, he's the author
of How to Give Good Internet: A Special Report on Exactly How to Make
Money Online.  And he's been full of good tips.  
<p>
Let me ask you a little bit about bookmarking a web site.  How to get
customers, how to get people to want to come back to your web site. 
What are some of the tricks that you can use to make people realize
that this is not something that they should just see, and then leave. 
That they're going to want to see it again and again and again.
</i>
<p>
<b>ET</b>:  Well, Russell, part of developing a good web site is
creating a site that does offer change.  It provides new information
from time to time.  One of my clients is an attorney, and he has a
"case of the week."  He provides information to entrepreneurs, on how
to avoid such things as sexual discrimination suits, and independent
contractor disputes, and those kinds of things.
<p>
And one of the ideas we came up with is just to have a case of the week,
that he can briefly summarize, but the entrepreneurs would want to go
back and find out something about that particular case, and how to
protect themselves from that type of litigation.
<p>
But equally important as that, is, asking the people to do it.  What
I have found is, even if you have a great site, if you don't remind
people when they're at the site, to bookmark it, they'll tend to
forget.  So, you need to post something, sometimes even in a blinking
text, that says "Please, be sure to bookmark this site.  Check
regularly for changing information."  But if you'll just put that
subtle command or that direction in there, you'll find you're
bookmarks and your repeats will go way way up.
<p>
We have some software available now, that actually tracks not only
how people enter a web site, but what they do when they're in the web
site, where they go, how long they spend in each page, etcetera, and
then we can track the amount of times they come back.  And then, doing
that and then implementing that kind of software, we can track a lot
of the effectiveness of some of these marketing ideas.  And it's
working real, real well.  So I'll give that as a little freebie for
all the listeners, that they'll definitely want to do:  Instruct
people to bookmark your web site. 
<p>
Another great idea, is if you're asking people to call you for whatever
reason, if you're trying to generate a phone call, you might put your
phone number in the title line of the web page.  So then every time
they look at every page, they'll have your phone number right in
there.  Very very subtle, but it's available.  Again, lots of times
you'll see web sites developed, and page after page after page will
go by and you won't even know how to get a hold of the people if you
become convinced that you should.  So, you want to make sure to make it easy
for people to respond when they're ready to respond.
<p>
<i>Host:  I think what you're also pointing out there is that
consistency from page to page is probably a good idea.  If they have
to look throughout the page to find the same piece of information
that they expect to be somewhere on the page, that's not as good as
if they know that for example the email address is always going to be
at the bottom, that's a pretty standard thing.
</i>
<p>
<b>ET</b>:  Right.  And the development, the design of a page or of
a web site is crucial, and again, I recommend to anybody, before you
develop your own site, really look around, and find out both what you
like and also, what works.  There's just nothing more important there.  
You don't want a model of failure.  Jim Rolm, a speaker who's also a
friend of mine, he said one of the things that he would love to do,
is find out what failures do, and be sure not to do that!   I think
that's as good of advice as, find out what successful people do and be
sure to do that! (Laughs.)
<p>
<i>Host:  Well, I've been in the educational software business for
many years and people ask me, what--how do you market educational
software, and I say "Study very carefully everything I've done, and
don't do any of it!"
</i>
<p>
<b>ET</b>:  (Laughs)  Yeah, there you go!
<p>
<i>Host:  Hopefully things will be different on the web.  Now, um, most
of the people listening, probably 99% of the ones listening, don't
have a web site yet.  99.9% of them don't have one yet, but by the
end of this year, by golly, a good percentage of them will!  And you
do give some advice on what to ask a web service provider.  I found
this particularly funny.  You suggest that there are forty two 
questions that one should ask.  Now, I contend that if you ask a web
service provider forty two questions and they answer them all, you
should stick with them regardless of what the answers are because
they're obviously very concerned with giving good service--and that's
probably the #1 thing that you want from a web service provider.  I
know when I have problems, it's nice to be able to get a voice.  A
real person.  
</i>
<p>
<b>ET</b>:  Right.    
<p>
<i>Host:  But what are some of the more important things for people
who are just starting out and who are looking for a service, what
should they be looking for?
</i>
<p>
<b>ET</b>:  A good question is when was the last time that your web
server went off line?  How reliable is the Internet connection?  Are
you connected with a T1 or a T3?  Again, the bigger the pipe, if you
have a T3 access, probably everything will go faster.  If their
computer is down frequently, that's not a good sign.  Do you provide
online ordering capabilities?  I mean, can people order online?  Do
you have Netscape encryption available if you want it?
<p>
There are many, many questions.  I do have, in fact, if people would
like, I'm happy to provide that list for people, for free, if 
they wanted to call, I can give them those questions, just as a
bonus, for listening to the program today, I can give them an 800
number for that if that would make sense.
<p>
<i>Host:  Okay, yeah. We're right near the end of the show, so let's go ahead and
start giving out those numbers.
</i>
<p>
<b>ET</b>:  Okay, well (800) 760-1995, and they can certainly order
the Special Report, which is $79.00, and I'm happy to throw in, as a
bonus, to anybody that would like it, the 42 questions to ask while
selecting a web server or an Internet access provider.  
And I also want to say real quick, Russell, that the first six or seven months
that I was involved with this, I did not have a web site of my own
up, and I generated thousands of dollars in consulting, off of--via my
online marketing, just via newsgroups.  So if people are considering
getting online or doing online marketing, don't wait until you're web
site is up!  I mean, get involved with newsgroups and the other
vehicles right away!  Because you can generate a substantial amount
of revenue with that as well.
<p>
<i>Host:  And you can also, if you have America Online, or
CompuServe, you can set up a web site for free!
</i>
<p>
<b>ET</b>:  Oh exactly, and I highly recommend using BOTH of those
services.  Even as a moonlighter, people interested in moonlighting,
there's just so many ways that you can make extra money doing things

<h1> Highlights of Interview with Clifford Stoll </h1>

<I>The following are some highlights from a radio show broadcast on radio station WALE. The views expressed are solely those of Russell D. Hoffman and his guest and do not necessarily reflect anyone else's point of view.</I><p>
<hr>
<b>May 24th, 1995</b>
<p>
<i>Russell Hoffman ("Host")</i>, <i>High Tech Today</i>
<br>
<b>Clifford Stoll ("CS"), Author, The Cuckoo's Egg, Silicon Snake Oil.</b>
<hr>
<p>
<i>Host:  ...Ponder this, that I've wondered about for a long time,
if you will:  It's the problem of not doing original research.  If a
thousand people convey a piece of information, or a collection of
information from one to another, at a 99.9% [error-free] rate, which sounds
like a pretty good, error-free rate, but if a thousand people
transmit that information--what have you got at the end?  And I think
this is something that, in a way, you're addressing because you don't
know the sources of the information you get on the Internet a lot of
times.
</i>
<p>
<b>CS</b>:  People think that because there [are] documents
available online, that almost automatically all they have to do is
copy from an online document and paste it into something else.  To get
the inside scoop, that all they have to do is peruse a fact that's
been posted to the Internet, or to the Usenet, and they'll--right off,
see the facts of the situation.  
<p>
It seems to me, however, that most of what we call knowledge is not
<i>information</i>--the kind of thing you can get from an encyclopedia or
you get from an online service--most of what knowledge is is
experience and judgment, and having done something before or having
an interest in something.  What the information highway promises
is a lot of knowledge.  We'll be smart if we use it.  In fact, it
delivers mostly just data.  And data is just bits and bytes; and words
and paragraphs, without context or content.  
<p>
Knowledge and information are a long way from "data".  Unfortunately, people think:
"Oh, all I have to do is get online.  All I have to do is get a
modem, and somehow, I'll be endowed with the <i>good stuff</i> and I'll be
smart or I'll be better able to handle my job."  Well, it seems to me
that this is a falsehood implied in the information highway. 
<p>
But the reality is: there is <i>much less</i> online than we
really--than, than is being advertised.
<p>
<i>Host:  Less is more, people are drowning in a sea of knowledge?
</i>
<p>
<b>CS</b>:  Oh yeah.  I mean, how many people go around every day,
cup in hand, saying "I need more information!  I gotta have
<i>more</i> information!  I don't have enough information!"?  Nope,
most people walk around saying "You know, I've got plenty.  If
anything I've got <i>more</i> than enough information.  What I need is
--perhaps--better quality information; a filter to block out most of the
stuff" or, "less information and better tools to handle it with" or, "I
need, or I want, richer experiences."
<p>
It seems to me that the information highway is delivering the very
thing that people are <b>not</b> demanding, namely lots more, faster data. 
It--It's strange.  Much of what comes across the Internet is a solution,
a terrifically good solution, desperately in search of a problem."

<h1> Interview with LT JG Kimber Bannan </h1>

An interview by<a href="/index.html"> Russell D. Hoffman</a> on his radio show <B>HIGH TECH TODAY</B>. <p>
<HR>
<I>The following full transcript is from a radio show broadcast on radio station WALE. The views expressed are solely those of Russell D. Hoffman and his guest and do not necessarily reflect anyone else's point of view.</I><p>
<hr>
<b>March 29th, 1996</b>
<p>
<i>Russell Hoffman ("Host")</i>, <i>High Tech Today</i>
<br>
<b> LT JG Kimber Bannan("KB"), United States Coast Guard Pacific Strike Team</b>
<hr>
<p>
<i>Host:  ...And you're listening to High Tech Today with your host,
Russell Hoffman, and my guest today is involved with the 'HAZMAT'
operations in America.  She's a member of the US Coast Guard
Pacific Strike Team.  Her name is LT JG Bannan, and she's going to
be talking about what the--how the government responds to potential
disasters around the country, I guess.  First of all, I'd like to welcome
you to the show.
</i>
<p>
<b>KB</b>:  Thank you Russell.
<p>
<i>Host:  We were talking before the show about how many strike teams
the Coast Guard has, so why don't we go over that, and then we'll
talk more specifically about what exactly you do.  What kind of calls
you get.
</i>
<p>
<b>KB</b>:  Sure.  The Coast Guard has been mandated by the federal
government to have three strike teams and one coordination center as
part of a national strike force.  Each strike team is located in
different areas.  The Pacific strike team is just north of San
Francisco at Hamilton Air Force Base.  There is a Gulf strike team in
Mobile, Alabama and an Atlantic strike team in Fort Dix, New Jersey.
<p>
The coordination center is located in North Carolina at Elizabeth
City, and they kind of help coordinate between the three teams,
because often times, we work with the other teams.
<p>
We cover, at our team, the fourteen western states and the Pacific
Trust territories, so we can find ourselves from Guam to Alaska, and
inland to Denver and Arizona, so we have a pretty wide area that we
cover.
<p>
<i>Host:  Now, what sort of emergencies--what are some of the more
typical emergencies that you go out on?
</i>
<p>
<b>KB</b>:  Well, recently I just returned from Idaho, and we had a
large job in the Pacific Northwest, in the Portland area, because of
the recent flooding.  And the floods had released a lot of
miscellaneous drums, and tanks and containers, and so we were brought
out by the Coast Guard and the EPA to help collect the drums
before the waters receded and they ended up in somebody's back yard,
which of course they could do a lot more damage there.
<p>
In addition to that kind of humanitarian efforts, we do things
like typhoon Omar in the Pacific Northwest, and Pacific Islands, the major oil
spills, our team was of course up on the one you hear about most, the
Exxon Valdez.  Pipeline ruptures.  Container ships, which is a big can
of worms to a lot of people, because you'll have a container ship
with lots of different products on it, and if there's a problem
with the ship itself, out at sea, they don't want to bring it into
port, so we'll go out and assess the situation, as far as the
hazardous materials go.  Fish processing vessels, who have suffered
fires, and their ammonia refrigeration system has been impinged, so
there's big ammonia releases.
<p>
The captain of the port obviously doesn't want a vessel like that to
come in, so we'll go out to sea and try to correct the problem before
the vessel comes in for repairs.
<p>
<i>Host:  So, normally you would use helicopters to get around?
</i>
<p>
<b>KB</b>:  Often.  If we're going to a different part--in order to
get to the part of the country where we're going to we generally will
fly commercial air.  If we have a lot of equipment to bring, then we
will fly a Coast Guard C-130 aircraft, to a military airport or a
commercial airport.  To get things out to remote areas, for short
distances we'll use different helicopters.  Either we've used the
Coast Guard helicopters to do a lot of work out at sea with other
ships, but we've also used the Air National Guard, and the Army, and
other sources, commercial sources for helicopters for doing
overflights of spills, and that's always real handy to have a
resource like that available.
<p>
<i>Host:  So, basically a lot of different organizations are willing
to contribute equipment to you when you need it?
</i>
<p>
<b>KB</b>:  Yes.  Often times, we'll have a Responsible Party, and
they will have certain resources that they can provide for the
cleanup.  In addition, if you also have a multi-agency task force--for 
lack of a better word--we use the same kind of Incident Command
System that the National Forest Fire Fighters would use.  It's set up
so that you can have several different agencies in command, but they
still speak with one voice, so that the organization of the response
usually goes a lot smoother than without that! (Laughs.)
<p>
<i>Host:  In terms of oil spills, which I think, that's mainly what
most people think of, when they think of HazMat having to go out and
do something in an emergency.  Is that something you would normally
bring a lot of equipment to?  How do you usually handle something
like that?
</i>
<p>
<b>KB</b>:  Well, the Coast Guard tries not to interfere with
enterprise.  If a contractor has the ability and the means to get
equipment that is adequate to the site, to use, we certainly try not
to take away from the industry being able to do its own job.
<p>
We do have some very specialized equipment that's not available
anywhere else.  We have what's called the OWOCRS, which is the Open
Water Oil Retainment and Recovery System, and the Coast Guard is the
only organization in the world--the United States Coast Guard--that
has such a system.
<p>
It's a very large barrier--it's, um, a 612 foot long boom, and in the
very center of it it's got several skimmers that, as the boom moves
through the water, being towed by two different vessels, it collects
oil off the top of the water from the apex, from the pocket, and
then brings it to a barge, or some kind of transportable storage
device, so that you can collect the oil, and get it out of the water
at the same time.
<p>
We have several different kinds of <a href="/pumpglos/pumpglos.htm">pumps</a>, for offloading ships that
are in trouble.  At the Marsh J. Berman spill in San Juan a few years
back, we basically were able to pump off the majority of the cargo
prior to the sinking of the barge, so that a lot of the oil didn't go
to the bottom with the barge.  
<p>
That's a capability--where you can get there generally quicker, and move 
up resources and personnel there, and get to the job a lot quicker 
than a majority of other industries out there.
<p>
<i>Host:  So if you get there soon enough you can pump the stuff off,
but if you have to use the skimmer, I think--I've always wondered: 
Is that oil reusable at that point or do they somehow throw it away?
</i>
<p>
<b>KB</b>:  Often times, oil that's been in the water is not, because
a lot of the machines that are used to collect it out of the water
emulsify the oil.  In other words it puts--mixes--a lot of water into
the oil.  
<p>
Also, if it's been out there for a long time, the
weather--weathering process--of the oil tends to render it pretty
unusable.  Sometimes they can run it through centrifuges and filter
presses and get out water and debris, and burn it--reuse it.  
<p>
Not generally for as high of a BTU--a use level that they would have been
able to, but--it's pretty rare, if you've got a bunch of oil in the
water, that you're going to reuse it.  So it generally has to be
disposed of.  
<P>
On smaller quantities they can reinject in into a
production well, or they can recede it back into a
pipeline and mix it with what's there, therefore the solution--the
dilution of it kind of helps it.  
<p>
So, often once it's been in the
water, and it's weathered, they won't reuse it.  They will--it will
have to be disposed of.  It's waste oil.
<p>
<i>Host:  But generally, diffusion is not the best solution to
pollution!
</i>
<p>
<b>KB</b>:  No, no! (Laughs)  In fact in the United States we're very
reluctant to use any kind of dispersant application.  It requires the
Regional Response Team's approval.  The Regional Response Team is
made up of several different organizations--the Coast Guard, the EPA,
NOAA, the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration,
several other organizations that get involved, generally the
state--and in order to disperse an oil spill, it takes a lot of work,
and if you don't do it in the first few hours of the spill it's really
not very effective, because the dispersant relies on good quality oil,
and once the oil's been out there for very long it's not really
dispersable as it would be if you can get it right away.
<p>
<i>Host:  Uh Hh.  Okay, you're listening to High Tech Today with your
host, Russ Hoffman, and my guest, LT JG Bannan of the US Coast
Guard Pacific Strike Team...[break]...
<p>
...and we're back with High Tech Today, and my guest, Kimber Bannan,
from the US Coast Guard Pacific Strike Team.  She goes out and takes care of
oil spills, fires with hazardous waste, floods--you name it, she's
going to be there.  And why not talk a little bit about what kind of
equipment you use.  What are some of the more exciting developments
that have come along since you got into the business, and so forth?
</i>
<p>
<b>KB</b>:  Okay, Russell.  I've been on the strike team now for
three years, and I've seen technology go quite a distance since I've
been here.  We're, recently, getting ready to take delivery of some
very large Mobile Incident Command Posts.  And basically, a lot of
times what we end up filling the role is, command and control at a
larger incident.  And this allows us to have basic office space
anywhere.  
<p>
It's two large tractor-trailer type trailers that connect together,
and they're full of computers and communications equipment, repeaters
to get over mountainsides with radios, UHF, VHF radios--they're
really great, and you walk in and it looks like you're on a space
station or something, because they're full of different kinds of
electronics packages, they have meeting rooms, and it's something
that is really, very valuable at a site.  
<p>
We have some smaller ones that aren't as high tech, or aren't as
nice, but this one's going to be very good.  It's also being made by
already-existing materials and equipment that's in Government
Surplus, so we're getting a much better product at a quarter of the
cost it would of had, to make them new, so that's kind of refreshing
to see.
<p>
<i>Host:  Um Hm!
</i>
<p>
<b>KB</b>:  In addition, some of the equipment that we work with, we
have a lot of multi-gas sensors.  Oftentimes you're going into an
environment that you're not really sure what's there.  So we have a
lot of different sensors that can give us realtime readings on things
like:  hydrogen sulfide readings, if there's any chlorine gas, as well
as oxygen, and explosive levels of atmospheres.  We won't go into an
area, that has an explosive atmosphere.  There's not a
suit in the world that's going to keep you from blowing up! (Laughs) 
<p>
We do have suits that will help protect us from any kind of
vapor hazard, if we're going into a--we had a chlorine spill in
[Alaska] that we wore "level A" personal protective clothing, which
is fully encapsulated suit.  If you've ever seen the movie OUTBREAK--
<p>
<i>Host:  You bet!
</i>
<p>
<b>KB</b>:  --Those "biosuits" they wore. We'll wear those, and work
with heavy tools, and drums, and you have a Self-Contained Breathing
Apparatus in there--it's really kind of neat!  The suits are made
out of Teflon, so they're pretty impervious to just about anything,
except of course a fire or explosion, which, personally, I don't want
to be in there anyway!  (laughs) 
<p>
<i>Host:  Okay!
</i>
<p>
<b>KB</b>:  So, we have a lot of capabilities like that, that we can,
kind of, go into an unknown atmosphere, and have to deal with that.
<p>
We've also go some radioactive detectors that will detect alpha,
beta, and gamma radiation.  We have a site, in the midwest, that's a,
was a radioactive, um, kind of a broker.  He would bring in
radioactive waste and broker it out, and take care of it, and that
site's been going on for several months now.  We're there monitoring
contractor efforts for the EPA, and kind of being their liaison,
between the contractor and themselves, and that's working out quite
nice.
<p>
Some of the newest equipment we've gotten has been, we have a
stainless steel chemical load, that has stainless steel piping, and a
stainless steel pump, called a CCM 150, that will pump 150 GPM's, and
it can be used in a multitude of different chemicals.  It was
recently--that pumping load was recently used on the [case] in
Savannah, Georgia where several large chemical tanks exploded and
they had to be pumped off.
<p>
Two hundred fifty local residents were evacuated from the immediate
area.  The job was of course in a very warm season in Savannah,
Georgia, it was hot, we had people working in those fully
encapsulated suits, pumping liquid out of these tanks that were still
smoldering, and--it's that kind of thing that really makes you
thankful that you're getting up every day and you're really doing
something that's making a difference, but it also gives you some
nightmares occasionally too!
<p>
<i>Host:  Yeah, the phrase "It's a tough job but somebody's got to do
it" finally means something, here!
</i>
<p>
<b>KB</b>:  Right!
<p>
<i>Host:  What's it like when, I guess, that bell goes off or the
light starts blinking.  What sort of thoughts go through your mind
as you get ready to roll?
</i>
<p>
<b>KB</b>:  Sometimes we have a little bit of a firehouse mentality,
where bells and whistles go off, and everybody's running out, and
everybody's trying to get something done, and sometimes I joke about
it, and think, maybe we should be playing circus music as this is all
going on.
<p>
But I have literally come to work on a Friday morning and not gone
home for four weeks!  It becomes--you become real good friends with
your neighbors--you know, please check my mail... you keep a bag
packed at work all the time, with everything you could need to be in
Alaska or Guam.  I have three different bags, one for summer, one for
winter, and one I take no matter what.  
<p>
So, it's--you're always on the edge, I mean, we're always waiting for
"the big one".  And, nobody can really ever define the big one, but
everybody's always ready for it--hence the Coast Guard motto, Semper
Paratus, Always Ready.  That's really what we try to embrace, and try
to do.  A lot like a small boat station that does search and rescue. 
When that call comes in, you've got to be ready to go.
<p>
So, normally, if we get a phone call from, Anchorage.  From the
marine safety office at Anchorage, and they need us up there.  We'll
send two people on commercial air <i>right away</i>.  They will be
out the door within fifteen minutes and headed to the airport to go. 
<p>
Then, in another couple of hours we'll have a load up to Sacramento
to fly, on a Coast Guard C-130, up to Anchorage.  And generally, we
can get equipment within twelve hours, to just about any place, with
the exception of some of the outlying islands in the Pacific. So, we
try get things out there pretty quick.  Which is a benefit. 
<p>
Logistics when you get there is sometimes hard.  Finding a tractor
trailer that will pull your load, and taking care
of the personnel that you have, is rough.  Oftentimes, you get there
and for the first three or four days, you're working eighteen hour
days, generally seven days a week, and...I did a pipeline rupture, in
the San Jacinto River in Houston, about a year and half ago, where we
were working 18 hour days for the first week and a half, and then it
cut back.  So, it's kind of intense work.
<p>
<i>Host:  It certainly sounds it.  You're listening to High Tech
Today...[break]...
<p>
...We're talking about emergency responses to deadly and dangerous
situations, and situations that can lead to a lot of pollution.  Why
not tell us a little bit about how big the force is, and what your
offices are like, and your home base.
</i>
<p>
<b>KB</b>:  Sure.  Each team has approximately 36 to 40 people.  Our
team out here in California has 40 people total.  We're located at a
now-closed Air Force base, and our buildings take up two airplane
hangers, and there's a small administrative space in between the two
large airplane hangers.  In fact, the movie THE RIGHT STUFF, part of
it was filmed in our hangers, so that gives you an idea of the
immense space that we fill up with our gear.
<p>
There's forty people.  Most, the majority of them are enlisted members in
the Coast Guard.  Bos'n mates, machinery technicians, electricians,
there's administrative type rates, marine science technicians--I know
I'll forget somebody and they'll be angry with me!  But, we have a
wide variety of people here.  There is--we do a lot of liaison or
marketing, our planning officer has been here for three years now and
he is really--his big initiative is a lot of training.  
<p>
When a member reports aboard the strike team, we send them immediately
to forty-hour HazMat school, which is an OSHA requirement to work on
any kind of SuperFund or hazardous materials site.  So, they go away for
a week, and then we send them to Oil Spill Control School.  And, we're
currently using Texas A&M Oil Spill Control School, but there's a
bunch of other ones out there.  So they'll go for forty hours of oil
spill training as well.
<p>
And that's basically the minimum, before we'll let them go out and,
you know, conquer the world with their new-found skills.  In
addition, we do a lot of administrative type training--command and
control.  Advanced Marine Fire Fighting, we've sent several people to
that.  There's a great school that deals with train wrecks.  It's
Tank Car School, and they go and they learn about large train wrecks
and how to deal with the railroad person and the different railroad
companies, and how to handle two miles of train, that's compressed
into a hundred feet.  How to attack that kind of situation. 
<p>
There's treatment technology courses, where you go and you learn all
different kinds of ways to remediate soils and water treatment.  You
can come here and get an awful lot of training.  Some of the guys
have been through truck driver training, gotten their commercial
truck drivers license. EMT school.  It really helps somebody to get
set up, to do a lot of things they wouldn't be able to do otherwise,
in the Coast Guard.  So, it's kind of a desirable place to be, from
that aspect.
<p>
<i>Host:  It sound incredibly exciting.  What got you into the
business.  What made you decide that you wanted to do this?
</i>
<p>
<b>KB</b>:  Well, I got out of college, I went to Officer Candidate
School, I did not go to the Academy.  I got out of college and I
worked for a number of different things, and thought I needed a
little bit more direction (laughs). 
<p>
So I joined the Coast Guard, and I went to school for seventeen weeks
in Yorktown, Virginia, to Officer Candidate School, and, I wanted to
do something that I felt would give me the opportunity to travel,
give me the opportunity to learn something new, and where I could
serve the Coast Guard the best.  My degree's in Marine Biology, but
we have people here who have Forestry degrees, who don't have degrees
at all, degrees in [other] sciences.  Once I found out about the
strike team, found out what kind of opportunities it allowed me, and
I just kind of got it in my mind that that's where I was going to go. 
<p>
And it's really paid out, I've been all over the world.  Last winter
I went to Okinawa for two weeks, and provided training to the Air
Force in hazardous materials work.  I went to South Korea and provided
the same training to the Air Force there.  I've been to Sai Pan and
Alaska, it's a wonderful opportunity to travel, too.  Some of the
thrill-seeking extreme sports type rush, to be able to do it.  
<p>
A lot of people who get into the Coast Guard and do this kind of
thing are fire fighters.  They've been on firefighting teams or they
have been at search and rescue teams where the alarm goes off at
three o'clock in the morning and they run out, and it's very much a
thrill-seeking kind of a job, but it's also something you have to be
very careful and cautious with at the same time.  So it's very
exciting, but you don't want to rush into it.
<p>
<i>Host:  So...if you wanted to get into the business, and you were
in High School, say, right now, what kinds of courses, what kind of
direction would you want to go in?  What would you recommend, who
would you hope to see in the upcoming classes in the next few years?
</i>
<p>
<b>KB</b>:  I'd like to see somebody who is very physically fit!  We
work out a minimum of three times a week here for two
hours each time.  Oftentimes, rather than taking a lunch break we'll
go and jog as a team, or get involved in a lot of extracurricular
type sports activities, we'll play softball on the weekends.  You
have to be in good shape.  And that's not to say you have to be a
power lifter or a marathon runner, but it's very very <i>very</i> important
to the job that you're in good shape.  That you're financially
secure, especially if you have a family, or want to start a family. 
Because you could leave like I said, and leave your spouse at home
with the rest of your problems, if you're not careful.
<p>
You have to be able to speak to the public. They're going to
want--you're going to get a camera and a microphone stuck into you,
and have to talk to them.
<p>
<i>Host:  Okay!  And speaking of cameras and microphones, we're out
of time.  It certainly has been very interesting to hear about what
you do.  Thank you for coming on the show.
</i>
<p>
<b>KB</b>:  Thank you very much.
<p>
<i>Host:  My guest today has been Kimber Bannan, LT JG And she's
with the US Coast Guard Pacific Strike Team, and I guess when she
retires, she's going to do something simple and easy--like race car
driving!
</i>
<p>
<b>KB</b>:  (Laughs)  There you go!
<p>
<i>Host:  Thanks very much. You've been listening to High Tech
Today...Bye Bye!

<p>
<i>Russell Hoffman ("Host")</i>, <i>High Tech Today</i>
<br>
<b> Carolyn Spivak ("CS"), Chip Designer</b>
<hr>
<p>
<i>Host:  ...My guest today is Carolyn Spivak.  She's a chip
designer for a major company, and we're going to be talking about
what a chip designer does, and, maybe, what you would want to learn
if you want to get into the field of chip design and how the field has
changed.  Carolyn, welcome to the show!
</i>
<p>
<b>CS</b>:  Thanks a lot, Russell.
<p>
<i>Host:  And you've been in the chip design industry for quite a
while now, right?
</i>
<p>
<b>CS</b>:  That's right, more than fifteen years.
<p>
<i>Host:  More than 15 years.  You were telling me before we went on
the air, that in 'the biz' people track how long you've been in the
industry by how close the tolerances are.  Why not start by telling
us a little bit about that aspect of it, because I think everybody
understands that chips are basically electronic circuits placed on
silicon.  So why not tell us a little bit about what you do, and what the
tolerances were when YOU got into the industry.
</i>
<p>
<b>CS</b>:  Ah, I'd be giving away my age if I did that!
<p>
<i>Host:  (Laughs) Only to those in the know!
</i>
<p>
<b>CS</b>:  (Laughs) Right.  I guess people have the general idea
that as chip technologies get more advanced, the width of lines that
you can make on chips that you use to build up the transistors and
the circuits, get--the widths of those lines get smaller and
smaller.  And, we usually talk about them in terms of design rules.
<p>
When I started doing chip design, I was working in five micron design
rule technology, which, let me say, is very very small, but right
now, we've gone an order of magnitude smaller than that, so there's
really just a <i>huge</i> increase in the amount of stuff that you can pack
onto these circuits, over that time span.
<p>
<i>Host:  And you can actually put the, I guess, probably [something
like] the square of the tolerance, in terms of the number of elements 
on a chip?
</i>
<p>
<b>CS</b>:  Right, it gets interesting as you go down, because what
determines what you can pack in is sort of a--it's a reasonably
complex function of the different kinds of things that you're putting
on a device.  You may put down conductors which are basically just
metal wires close to each other.  Those have one kind of tolerance. 
You also want to put transistors down.  And there are rules about
design--how close you can design two transistors next to each other.
<p>
And so it's not always real straight forward.  But
basically, any time you can make finer design rules, the amount of
circuitry, the amount of functionality that you can pack onto a piece
of silicon the same size, really goes up dramatically.
<p>
<i>Host:  In the industry that you're in specifically, why not tell us a
little bit about--you're doing Gate Arrays, I think you had said?
</i>
<p>
<b>CS</b>:  Right.  The group that I'm with does, actually sort of a
sub-branch of a sub-branch of chip design.  Probably the chips that
most people hear about are standard product chips like
microprocessors and memories and a lot of the stuff that goes into
PC's and so forth.  And, as you can imagine they sell, you know,
companies who make those sell very large quantities of those,
and they sell them to different users who use them in different kinds
of ways.  In other words, the same microprocessor or the same memory
can go into different kinds of PC's or different kinds of hardware
systems.
<p>
There's another whole area of chip design, which is called a kind of
an ugly name, but it's called application-specific chip design, and
there basically the idea is that you're designing a chip for a
specific application.  In other words somebody might have, oh, I
don't know, any piece of hardware that you might think of.  A modem
or something, where they want to put--they want you to make a chip
just for them, that they can put into that modem and that will do the
job they need, but somebody else with a different kind of modem
design might use a different kind of chip.
<p>
The kind of chip design that I'm involved in is sort of right in the
middle, in that the chips we make can be programmed by the people who
use them, to do different things.  Now, in a way, microprocessors do
that.  Software's really a way to program microprocessors to do
different kinds of things.  But, the devices that we make, which are
called Field Programmable Gate Arrays, basically allow users a
greater level of control over what's going on on the silicon, than
programming microprocessors with software does.
<p>
<i>Host:  More control?  How is that?
</i>
<p>
<b>CS</b>:  Sure.  Because in the kind of chips that we make--in a
microprocessor, the conductors are all laid down, the transistors are
all laid down, and when you write software that gets compiled into
code, you're controlling in a sense, what comes out of the device,
but the paths that your signals take through the device, if you want
think of it that way, can only go really in certain ways.  The ways
that the architect of the microprocessor designed it.  Whereas, with
the chips that we design, if you're the person who's using them, you
can actually sit down on your workstation and kind of draw almost,
what you want the interconnections on the device to look like, and
how you want each little piece of logic on the chip to behave. 
That's really all under your control.  And you then send the device
the information that it needs to, really, program itself that way.
<p>
So it's a real different mind set than a microprocessor.  A
microprocessor--you write software, the architecture's already very
strictly defined, and somebody's built up a compiler that lets you
compile into that.   But if your application is for something that
microprocessors aren't so good at doing--and there are lots of those
things--you're kind of out of luck.  And, before Field Programmable
Gate Arrays came along, your only choice at that point was to do
traditional kinds of application specific chip design, and the
problem with that is that it takes a really long time from the time
that you tell you chip vendor exactly what you want, to the time that
you get your chips back.  That's a really long development process. 
And by putting the programming power into the hands of the end user,
what Field Programmable Gate Arrays have really done is to--to really
shorten up the design cycles for some of those things.
<p>
<i>Host:  Are there also, perhaps, speed advantages, um, to something
that's designed with a field programmable gate array versus a CPU? 
Lower chip count, which would make it cheaper, perhaps it would run
faster also, as well as being easier to develop?
</i>
<p>
<b>CS</b>:  It really depends on the application.  Certainly--it
wouldn't be fair not to mention that what you pay for the kind of
flexibility that a field programmable gate array gives you is speed as compared to an
application specific circuit.  But that doesn't mean that--you may
not be able to achieve much higher speed than you would have with a
microprocessor.  It really depends on what your application is.
<p>
<i>Host:  ...[break]... My guest is Carolyn Spivak, a chip designer,
who designs field programmable gate arrays, and we're talking about
the technology of chip design, which is so important to every high
tech device ever manufactured, and we're finding what this level of
production is like.  So Carolyn, why not tell us a little bit about
what an average day is like for you.  What does the process of chip
design entail?
</i>
<p>
<b>CS</b>:  All right.  Well, there's really a whole spectrum of
things that come into it, and it runs all the way from trying to
figure out what customers want to see in new devices, and of course
we have marketing folks who help us out with that, all the way
through to the extreme other end of the cycle which is, keeping an
eye on what's going on in our factory, and making sure that
production of our devices is going smoothly, and everything is
running the way it should in the factory, because there's a
real--you know, even though we're called chip designers, our point is
to make chips that our company can sell and that will work for our
customers.
<p>
And so, even though we're called chip designers, a big piece of the
design job is making sure that what we've designed is manufacturable! 
And I'd say, from the ten thousand foot viewpoint, really all our
design activities after we figure out what we think customers want,
are aimed at making sure that we can deliver devices that meet those
needs.  In other words, that we'll be able to make them in the
factory.  And the kinds of things that go on in the chip design,
first a very high level view of what a customer wants.  And then,
maybe either a high level capture of that kind of functionality, or a
logic design capture, kind of at a block level.  There are fairly
standard blocks that logic designers use.  And for us, the circuits
that we make are very very dense.  Probably among the densest in the
industry.  And so a lot of effort goes into working with layout
engineers to make sure that things are packed as tightly as they can
be in the layout--but not too tightly!  Because, again, any
manufacturing process has a certain tolerance, and you can't go
beyond that tolerance and expect to reliably make a product.
<p>
<i>Host:  Well, talking about reliability, have there been large
changes--or small changes, or any changes in the reliability of chips
since you've entered the industry, and how do you measure
reliability?  I mean, it seems to me as a user of computers all the
time, they basically work.  When one finally--if a card breaks in a
computer you throw the card out and get a new card.  How do you, at
your level, and that would be I think where the rubber meets the
road, or where the silicon meets the sand--in terms of reliability,
how do you program, or how do you design for, how do you measure,
whether or not you've achieved a certain level of reliability?
</i>
<p>
<b>CS</b>:  It's--It's a good question.  There are a lot of very
formal ways to do it, because reliability is of course one of the
things that equipment manufacturers worry about the most. 
<p>
I guess the first thing I ought to say is that as chip technologies
have allowed putting more functionality onto a single piece of
silicon, reliability has increased hugely, because--the insides of
chips are really, really reliable.  What's unreliable is solder
connections.  So, as the amount of function that you've been able to
put on a chip increases you have fewer and fewer solder connections
in your system because more and more of that goes inside the device. 
And that's exactly why, you know, that there have been these kinds of
advances.  At the chip level we do standard, fairly boring things
like heating devices up and letting them run for long periods of
time, under very hot conditions, and making sure that they last a
long time under those kinds of conditions.
<p>
The kind of reliability I was talking about is actually not for the
end user, although that's real important, but for being able to make
sure that the part--that the natural variations in production
processes, don't cause any problems in the part.  In other words,
it's sort of this idea that you want your design to be real robust,
so that when you put it in production--any production process has
variation in it, and you need to make sure that your design takes
that into account.
<p>
That kind of reliability is important not just from a cost point of
view, but also it's important because customers depend on shipments,
and if a semiconductor vendor has yield problems, what happens is
that a customer doesn't get their part, so that's a real important
part of the process for us.
<p>
<i>Host:   ...[break]... Why not tell us a little bit about what kind
of a mind set it takes to get into this industry, and what are some
good courses that someone might take, or what sort of interests
people might have to begin with, that would be natural--lead them
into something like chip design?
</i>
<p>
<b>CS</b>:  Well there's a--like we were talking about during the
break, there's really a bunch of different kinds of skill sets that
people have in the industry.  The classic chip designer is probably
someone with an electrical engineering background.  Most of the
people that come into the field have either bachelor's or master's
degrees in electrical engineering.  And that involves a lot of math
courses.  For people who are young, I'd say the most critical thing
is to take all the math courses you can, in junior high and in high
school.  I'm laughing a little because that's really hackney, but
it's real important for people, because if you don't take those early
math courses, you shut yourself off from a lot of engineering
careers, not just electrical engineering.  
<p>
So, there's sort of the classic electrical engineering path.  But
there are also a lot of people who specialize in other areas.  One of
them is layout.  Where I work, we have people who are specialists in
layout, and who might enjoy drafting kinds of things, or a lot of
them come from a semi-graphics background.  And then, some of the
people who are design engineers--I'm hopeless at trying to arrange
things dimensionally--that's just not a talent I have, so I really
depend on people who have those kinds of skills, to do that piece of
it.
<p>
There are also people who come in through programming kinds of
backgrounds.  And I'd say the general mind set--you have to enjoy
debugging things.  You have to--you have to really enjoy going in,
and making things work, and finding out what's really wrong.  The
kind of people that we look for when we hire are ones who have real
good problem solving skills, and a deep technical background--in some
area.  In a lot of cases now, there are pretty good college programs
that include VLSI design.
<p>
<i>Host:  The equipment that you're working on is pretty expensive. 
You mentioned that there are really good college courses, but I would
think that it must be quite a shock when you get out of college and
get into the real world, because of the cost of the--chip fabricating
takes a billion dollar company to do that.
</i>
<p>
<b>CS</b>:  Right.  Well, a lot of the schools have arrangements,
there's actually a consortium, where students can make up their
design using inexpensive or shareware kinds of CAD tools, and then
send it off to [the consortium] and actually get parts fabricated.  So,
for some of the--actually a lot of the electrical engineering schools
can actually send designs in and it's--of course it's good for
students to be able to actually get stuff made.  It's also hard to
make a real chip in a semester, I guess! (Laughs)  
<p>
But, even for students that don't have the opportunity to do that kind of thing,
there's an awful lot of CAD programs floating around, and as PC's
have gotten more and more powerful, you used to only be able to do
CAD for integrated circuits on really expensive workstations.  But
now there's a lot of pretty good CAD programs that run on PC's and so
that's certainly helped out in the academic environment a lot.
<p>
<i>Host:  Okay, and the last question:  Where do you see this
technology going, in the near term, say five years, and in the long
term, say, twenty years?   And if you want to tell me where you think
it's going to be in 200 years, we're all ears!
</i>
<p>
<b>CS</b>:  (Laughs)  Well, in five years, I think it's basically going to
be more of the same.  In other words, the amount--things will
continue, electronics will continue to get cheaper, we'll continue to
be able to put more and more stuff onto less and less silicon, and
that will translate for consumers into being able to buy less and
less expensive versions of fancy electronic equipment.
<p>
<i>Host:  Which will be more powerful and more reliable.
</i>
<p>
<b>CS</b>:  Which will be more powerful and more reliable.  So that's
kind of an easy one.  The further viewpoint, there's a--there are
always people who say, oh, in that kind of time frame, "all the
technology will be optical" or in that kind of time frame, we'll get
a dramatically different integrated circuit technology.  And that's
quite possible.  You read some of these things about optical
switching, optical computers and so forth, and we may, in that kind
of time frame, we may be dealing with fairly different kinds of
technology.  But at the same time, you know, there have been a lot of
technologies which are already kind of "just down the road" and I
think that particularly the manufacturing experience we have in the
current silicon technology is going to keep a lot of what consumers
see in that technology, even in a fairly long term kind of view.
<p>
<i>Host:  Okay, well, I'd like to thank you very much for being on
the show today.  My guest has been Carolyn Spivak.  She's a chip
designer who designs field programmable gate arrays.  And this has
been a very interesting talk.  It's interesting to hear what the
lowest level of all the high tech devices, how they're built and
what's going on.  This has been High Tech Today with your host,
Russell Hoffman...Thanks for listening.  Bye Bye!

<h1> Full text of Interview with Dr. Timothy Leary </h1>
<hr>
An interview by<a href="/index.html"> Russell D. Hoffman</a> on his radio show <B>HIGH TECH TODAY</B>. <p>
<HR>
<I>The following interview occurred on a live broadcast on radio station WALE. The views expressed are solely those of Russell D. Hoffman and his guest and do not necessarily reflect anyone else's point of view.</I><p>
Due to a variety of minor difficulties I was only able to introduce
Dr. Leary and ask one question.  Prior to his appearance on the show
I read from his book Chaos and Cyberculture.  This interview picks up
where he comes on the show.  Unfortunately once he got there, we lost
him again after the first break!  
<p>
I talked to Dr. Leary after the show, and we had hoped to re-interview
him, but on May 31st, 1996 he died at the age of 75, of prostate cancer.  
<p>
<b>Plans call for a small portion of Dr. Leary's and Star Trek creator 
Gene Roddenberry's ashes to be encapsulated in a lipstick-sized
container and piggybacked on the final stage of a
launch vehicle in the fall of 1996.  Although I have protested the
intentional and unintentional creation of <a href="/spacedeb/spacedeb.htm">space debris</a>
many times, I want to point out that these ashes will be going on a
<i>brief, temporary journey</i> to the lower reaches of space, and will then fall
back to earth and be burned up in the atmosphere on reentry.  I do
not see this as a problem and it is a fitting tribute to these
gentlemen.  For more information, please visit <a href="http://www.celestis.com">Celestis Inc.</a>, of Houston, Texas.

<hr>
<b>September 8th, 1995</b>
<p>
<i>Russell Hoffman ("Host")</i>, <i>High Tech Today</i>
<br>
<b>Dr. Timothy Leary ("TL"), guest.</b>
<hr>
<p>
<i>Host:  ... And, I've just been informed Dr. Leary has
arrived, and so I will welcome him to the show.  Dr. Leary is a
philosopher, psychologist, technologist and futurist, to name but a
few of his many areas of interest and influence.
<p>
A former Harvard University professor, by the end of the late sixties
Dr. Leary was without doubt, one of the most important cultural icons
of the day.  His efforts to expand individual conciousness and
freedom of thought are a legacy unmatched.  One of the first people
to study the positive effects of altering reality, these days Dr.
Leary spends a lot of his time in the cyber world of virtual reality,
using the Internet and discussing information dissemination via
computers.
<p>
He recently completed a new book called Chaos and CyberCulture, which
we were just reading from.  And, Dr. Leary, I'd like to welcome you
to High Tech Today!
</i>
<p>
<b>TL</b>:  Well, I'm always happy to be in touch with Providence. 
Providence is one of my favorite cities.  I grew up in Massachusettes
and we--I always felt Providence was a way to escape from Massachusettes
where I'm still a futive but, I'm glad to be talking to Providence.
<p>
<i>Host:  And, you're listening to High Tech Today--
</i>
<p>
<b>TL</b>:  Could you talk a little louder, you're not coming through
very clear.
<p>
<i>Host:  Your listening to High Tech Today, and my Guest is Dr.
Timothy Leary.  Dr. Leary, we've been reading from your new book,
Chaos and CyberCulture, which is a wonderful book, I've been enjoying
thumbing through it and--
</i>
<p>
<b>TL</b>:  Did I write that stuff you were just reading?
<p>
<i>Host:  That's what I was reading, yeah!
</i>
<p>
<b>TL</b>:  <i>My god</i>, I thought that was great!  (Laughs) I was hoping
it was somebody else that wrote it!
<p>
<i>Host:  Well, I'm sorry!  But it is great!
</i>
<p>
<b>TL</b>:  (Both laugh)
<p>
<i>Host:  I wanted to ask you a couple of questions about the
dissemination of information.  I think that that's really something
that only the philosophers right now can possibly give us a clue as
to what's going to happen in the next ten years or a hundred years. 
How are we going to for example, avoid the waste of time from
broadcast junk email and unsolicited faxes, and intrusive phone
calls.  How are we going to stop, when a thousand people have a
thousand cameras aimed at a thousand intersections in a thousand
nameless cities, how are we going to find something interesting?
</i>
<p>
<b>TL</b>:  Well, at the beginning of any new information culture--a
new media comes along and it just moves human intelligence up so we
can deal with our realities.  Like the book.  Before the book, most
people couldn't even write and suddenly, it went out of control. Is
it really going to be?  There are more and more books, there are
libraries, books books books, popular books.  How can we deal with
the fact that in our little city we have, like ten million books?
<p>
<i>(Sarcastically)</i> It's a problem.
<p>
You know--indexing, and you have to work around in
the files a little bit but, I mean, you know--everyone knows how to operate a
library. Boom Boom Boom Boom, you've got three books you want.
<p>
Yeah--I'm <i>delighted</i> that there's this chaotic jumble and
over-over-overload of information because-<i>we can handle it!</i> 
We've got to jack up, and speed up our own accelerators and
brain--brain accelerators to do it.
<p>
I know you can do it in Providence.  Of course, 'aid' is a very
important thing.
<p>
<i>Host:  Okay.  We're going to have to take a break.  It's our last
break before the end of the show.  We'll be right back.
</i>
<p>
<b>TL</b>:  Call me back because I'm going to change lines, okay?
<p>
<hr>
Unfortunately that turned out to be the end of the interview.  
There were about eight minutes left of the show and I read selected 
excerpts from his book again.  
<p>
Immediately after the show I called Dr. Leary, to apologize for loosing him
during the show, of course.  I mentioned that I found the comments in
Chaos and Cyberculture about getting "letters to the editor"
published very interesting, because like him I have made a study of
the successes and failures of various strategies of getting letters
published.  He had found that using a pen name worked remarkably
well, but using "Timothy Leary" didn't do so good, especially on
mundane matters where he wishes to be just a average citizen speaking
his piece.
<p>
I told him I personally had a very high publication rate,
which is probably over 80%, I think, if you don't count those which I write
knowing <b>full well</b> the editor won't publish it.   That's close
to 200 letters to various magazines published over a twenty year's span. 
His response is one I'll certainly treasure: "Wow! You're my hero!"

<hr>
<b>June 28th, 1995</b>
<p>
<i>Russell Hoffman ("Host"),  High Tech Today</i>
<br>
<b>Bob Engman ("BE"), President, Opto 22.</b>
<hr>
<p>
<i>Host: ...My guest today is Bob Engman.  He's the President of Opto 22, Inc., in Temecula, California. 
Opto 22 manufactures switching devices and control equipment for
factory automation, and they use PC's, and so they are able to
transfer information from the factory floor into the front office,
and he's also--they recently moved their company, uh, I guess about
60 miles, 75 miles, and they have over 200 employees and 
didn't loose a single employee in the move.  They're obviously doing
something right.  We're going to talk about that later in the show,
but right now, I'd like to welcome you to the show, Bob.
</i>
<p>
<b>BE</b>:  Hi Russ!
<p>
<i>Host: Let's talk a little bit about what sort of products your company manufactures.
</i>
<p>
<b>BE</b>: Well, our product line has evolved over the years, we
started the company in 1974 so it's just about 22 years old.  We
started making optically isolated solid state relays for control.  In
1978 we introduced a group of I/O modules, plug-in I/O modules, into
a printed circuit board that plugs into a microcomputer, and that
became a very popular product throughout the world, sort of an
industry standard now.  
<p>
That was towards the beginning of our foray
into industrial control with a computer.  Since that time the product
line has evolved so that we are now very much heavily involved with
both hardware and software to do industrial control, and process
control, using the PC as the base.  
<p>
We make about 600 different
hardware items, and what we have now is what we call a Mystic
Controller, and that Mystic Controller contains all of the hardware
necessary to communicate with the outside world, turn motors and
valves, sense outside parameters like pressures and temperatures, and
respond to programs written on a PC, with a very simple control
language, a very elegant control language.  It's a graphic control
language where all one has to do is write a flowchart of the process
or control that needs to be done, and then this program can be
downloaded to the Mystic Controller.  The Mystic Controller then can
perform all kinds of control out on the factory.
<p>
These controllers can be spread out around the factory and
communicate with one another and also to a host computer.  So, we've
been pursuing this idea of industrial control with a PC for the past,
oh, I would guess since the early 80's and its just been an
evolutionary process. 
<p>
I think we've probably got at least seven years of development work
in the software--Cerano.  So that's kind of a brief, in a nutshell,
what we do here.
<p>
<i>Host:  Cerano is the graphic control language that runs on the host.
</i>
<p>
<b>BE</b>:  It's a graphic control language.  On top of Cerano we
also have what we call a man-machine interface that allows you to
portray what's going on, all the parameters in a process.
<p>
<i>Host: What are some typical industrial processes that are
particularly applicable to your kind of automation devices?
</i>
<p>
<b>BE</b>:  Well, let's say, semiconductor manufacturing.  Process
control in a semiconductor plant.
<p>
<i>Host:  So, that's a real big-ticket item.
</i>
<p>
<b>BE</b>:  Yeah, that's a big-ticket item.  One of the very
interesting recent applications has been the manufacturing--there's a
big machine by Connors Peripherals which makes their disk drives--
<p>
<i>Host: Yes?
</i>
<p>
<b>BE</b>:  And, the entire process, from beginning to end, is
controlled by a Mystic Controller.  It's used in the food industry,
for example maybe you want to make Skippy Peanut Butter.  Material
handling.  Anything that really requires industrial--some kind of
control.  The pharmaceutical industry would use these ... Automotive
industry.  There's a new high-tech paint lab a General Motors, which
is totally controlled by a Mystic Controller.  Bausch and Lombe is
recently working on a new process that uses the Mystic Controller.
<p>
<i>Host: A lot of the automotive industry is highly robotic...
</i>
<p>
<b>BE</b>:  Right.  You could use a Mystic Controller.  One
possibility would be to use a Mystic Controller to interface and
control the robot.  So, you could write your program on a PC, tell
the robot what to do.  The Mystic Controller then operates the robot. 
That's one possibility.
<p>
As a matter of fact recently there is a factory in Japan that is
using Mystic Controllers to manufacture sake! (Laughs.)	It's sort of
a generic, universal type controller.
<p>
<i>Host: Well, the Mystic Controllers won't take a 'nip [of sake] every now and then?
</i>
<p>
<b>BE</b>:  (Laughs.)  Maybe so!
<p>
<i>Host: ...Just saying that something controls a robot...  That's
really a very simplified way of expressing something that's really
very complicated.   And, what I'm wondering, but we're going to have
to take a break, and when we get back maybe you'll go into a little
bit of detail about what that process might be like, of actually
writing a control program for these things, but right now, we're
taking a break on WALE, renegade radio.
</i>
<p>
<i>Host: ...We were talking before the break about manufacturing:
Using your Mystic Controllers for robotic applications, and I'm just
curious:  What sort of steps does one have to go through to control a
robot using your equipment?
</i>
<p>
<b>BE</b>: Well, the first thing you need to do is define the
sequence of events that the robot has to perform.  And that's a
fairly simply task.  You have a list of things:  "This arm has to
move this direction so far, maybe a hand closes--"  there's a whole
sequence of events that has to happen.  Now these events are
obviously--the movement of the robot--are controlled by little
motors, and hydraulic valves, and so forth.  And, there have to be
units that can operate these real-world devices, like motors and
solenoids and valves.  Our I/O modules perform that function.  They
are optically isolated from the real world and they communicate with
the computer.
<p>
What you do then, is define your sequence of events, and on a PC,
with a mouse, you draw a flowchart.  The flowchart then defines what
you want that robot to do.  You can fill in the flowchart with simple
English commands, like "Turn motor three on.  Turn valve four off."
<p>
What you can do then, is you have to ability to use that PC, talking
to a Mystic Controller, and the Mystic Controller talking directly to
the robot.  Or, there is also a computer on the Mystic Controller. 
That program, that you've written on a PC, can be downloaded to a
Mystic Controller, and that Mystic Controller then will perform all
those sequence of events that controls that robot, and will respond
to local events.  It can measure such things--also we have a series
of analog to digital modules that can measure pressures and
temperatures and convert that to digital computer language for
feedback to tell the computer what's going on.  So it's a very
organized, simple English procedure for controlling a complex process
or machine.  Now, there's an awful lot of software and hardware
development that makes it appear quite easy to the user.  And that's
been our thrust over the years.  
<p>
It's almost a necessity in today's world where things are getting so
complicated, to put the complication into the devices that people use
so that the difficulty becomes transparent to them.  And that's been
our whole thrust with the development of this Mystic Controller.
<p>
The reason we call it a Mystic Controller is, a number of years ago--one of the
most difficult things in designing a new product is determining what
the name should be, and our graphics arts people came one day and
said, "Well, we're optimistic about this new controller."  So we
decided to call it the Mystic Controller, and we're very optimistic
about it today.
<p>
<i>Host:  You mentioned the other day that you're working very
closely with Microsoft.
</i>
<p>
<b>BE</b>:  Yes, we are.
<p>
<i>Host:  A couple of questions on that.  Knowing them, you've signed
some non-disclosure agreements, but with what you can tell us:  How
did you approach them, and what are you doing with them?
</i>
<p>
<b>BE</b>:  We're doing development for new products.  Microsoft has
a whole series of back-office products.  And what the concept is, is
that they can...provide a backbone for a factory, whereby all kinds of
software packages can be utilized to bring information up to the
front office.
<p>
Excel, and all those various kinds of software packages, front office
packages that you can buy off the shelf--they'll plug right into the
backbone.  Opto 22 is working with Microsoft to be able to
communicate with that backbone so that all kinds of information from
the factory floor can be fed into a Mystic Controller--who is also by
the way doing the control--process information, any kind of
production control information--will go into the Mystic Controller. 
The Mystic Controller will then talk to the Microsoft back office
software suite, and then that information is available to the front
office to do what they want with it. 
<p>
We are currently porting the Cerano control language to Windows 95
and C, so we will be able to offer the Cerano control language
running on Windows 95, and we expect to announce that August 24th,
the same time that Microsoft ships their Windows 95.
<p>
<i>Host:  Were you, uh, oh never mind, I don't want to ask whether or
not you also had delayed it a year!  Forget I asked--
</i>
<p>
<b>BE</b>:  We've been working rather feverishly for the past six months!
<p>
<i>Host: ...Let's turn now to what the company is like.  Why not tell
us a little bit about how it's grown, and then, how you keep
people--how you get people, too.
</i>
<p>
<b>BE</b>:  Oh, okay, well you know, I think that's probably one of
the most significant features of a company.  
<p>
We started the company in 1974 to actually manufacture optically
isolated solid state relays, which I had previously sort of pioneered
the development of at another company.  I started my first company in
1960, starting in my garage with another fellow from--an engineer
that I knew back in Westinghouse.  I started working for Westinghouse
as a young engineer in 1954.  We came to California in the heyday of
the defense industry, the wild and woolly business days, and were not
very well satisfied working for a large company, so we started our
own company in my garage, and in 1967 we sold it to another company,
a larger company and it was kind of an unhappy experience because I
was back in bureaucracy again.  So in 1974 we parted company--I
worked there for about six years honoring an employment contract.
<p>
And so started--I had a better idea for how to make a solid state
relay so we introduced solid state relays and they were used in the
early days by the computer people--disk drives.  Thousands and
thousands of those [were] used.  So we sold them to Sperry Univac, and
Burroughs, and various people.  
<p>
And the idea was that we were going to make the most reliable product
possible.  As a matter of fact it's turned out that way:  We 100%
test everything we manufacture, to ensure reliability.  But, I was
never happy in large corporations with their bureaucracies, and uh, the
stifling atmosphere with respect to how people were treated.
<p>
I didn't believe that companies could be run by numbers, and I think
there's a lot of examples of that--
<p>
<i>Host:  Okay.  You're probably right but speaking of numbers,
unfortunately we have to take our second break, so why don't we do that,
and we'll get back to the exciting part of what happened at
Opto 22...(break)...if you've been listening to the rest of this show
you're probably on the edge of your seat right now, wondering:  "How
does a high-tech company keep good employees?"  So let's get back to
Bob and find out what he's been doing.
</i>
<p>
<b>BE</b>:  Well, what I've been doing, Russ, is pretty simple.  I
call it Management By Common Sense.  Over the 40 years I've been in
business I've seen all kinds of management fads.  And I decided that,
you know, an organization that put emphasis on giving people freedom
and trust, was an organization that could really work.  And that's
what we've done here at Opto 22.  
<p>
We just really don't have any bureaucracy.  We really don't--I've never
drawn an organization chart at Opto 22.  Obviously, we have a sales
department, we have a manufacturing department, a marketing department
and an engineering department.  But we've never really hardened those
lines.  They're sort of amorphous, so that we've created an
atmosphere here where it's a whole--it's teamwork.  And you know, we
share tasks here.  And people are given the freedom to do their work.
<p>
As a matter of fact, I'll give you an example.  We have here, about
175 people in manufacturing.  We have <i>one</i> person that runs
that shop.  
<p>
The other thing we've done over the years is we've had profit sharing
for our employees, oh, for the past fifteen years.  We pay that
profit sharing every three months--quarterly--and it's <i>never</i>
been less than 15% of a person's annual wage.  We also pay all of
their medical benefits, and we have a company-paid pension fund.
<p>
So we've had, you know, and the hourly wage in our shop now, I think is
about--the average is I think pretty close to ten dollars an hour.
<p>
So, it's kind of simple I think.  So much of management is <i>keeping
people from doing their work!</i>  We decide, every three or four
months what we need to do from an engineering standpoint.  We have a
little meeting, decide what the priorities are going to be, and then
we go to work.  We don't waste much time, and we don't over-staff.  
<p>
We always feel it's very important for everybody to feel that they're
making a contribution.  So we've made sure over the years that
everybody has plenty of work to do, and then they feel real good
about themselves, and then when they get that profit sharing check,
they feel like they've made a contribution.  And, we have such
continuity among people here that, it's surprising, how they will
correct each other's errors and so forth as they occur because they're all...working together.
<p>
<i>Host:  You mentioned trust and responsibility and giving people
the freedom to do what they're trying to do--that sounds a lot like 
a very famous place, the Skunk Works and Kelly Johnson, the way he
ran his shop.  So, uh, congratulations--it sounds like you're doing a
great job!
<p>
We only have a little time left.  Do you want to tell people how to
get in touch with you?  I don't know that too many people are going
to be coming from Rhode Island to California to look for a job, but I
was thinking more of the sales office or something like that. 
Someone might want a highly reliable solid state controller of some
sort.
</i>
<p>
<b>BE</b>:  (Laughs.) They might.  Recently, we're beginning to set up
sales offices around the country.  We're going to set one up in
Boston, there's a local office being set up now in Chicago...
<p>
<i>Host:  We're getting near the end here...in about thirty seconds,
what do you think is going to happen in the next ten years in your
industry?
</i>
<p>
<b>BE</b>: What's going to happen in the next ten years?  A
tremendous expansion of productivity.  It's just amazing how the
microcomputer and the PC is invading every aspect of industrial
control.  And you know, the United States is the world leader.  You
know, our software--there's nobody that does it like Americans.  And
it's being used all over the world.  It's going to be a very
interesting time for American Industry.  Productivity's going to
continue to increase.  More and more computers are going to be used
for communication and bringing the information that an organization
needs to be effective. 
<p>
The computer's now performing all of the information handling that layer
and layer of middle management used to do.  The computer does all
that much better and much quicker.  Real-time information.  And that's
the big thrust in the next few years, is real-time information from
the factory floor on up into the front office.
<p>
<i>Host: Middle management never did anything productive anyway!
</i>
<p>
<b>BE</b>:  (Laughs.)  They got in the way!
<p>
<i>Host:  They taught everyone else how to get around problems!
</i>
<p>
<b>BE</b>:  (Laughs.) Right!
<p>
<i>Host: Namely themselves.  Okay.  My guest has been Bob Engman. 
He's the President of Opto 22 in Temecula, California.  Makers of
factory automation and process control equipment that uses PC's and
connects directly to the front office.  I think it's fascinating
stuff, it's been wonderful having you on the show.  Thank you very
much--
</i>
<p>
<b>BE</b>:  Thank you!
<p>
<i>Host:  And thanks everybody for listening... This has been High Tech Today with your host, Russell Hoffman. Bye Bye.

<p>
Russell Hoffman, Host, <i>High Tech Today</i>
<p>
Hello, Ladies and Gentlemen and WELCOME to HIGH TECH TODAY.  I'm your host, Russell Hoffman and today our topic is Computer Technology in the Classroom. 
<p>
We're going to talk about what needs to be done to make schools better able to train our young people to meet the technological challenges that will face them tomorrow.
<p>
Let's face it:  Schools are failing to teach our students not just the skills of technology, but the joys, and the hows and the whys of technology.  What kind of computer technology do we need to be placing in classrooms?  Why will it make a difference?
<p>
I think there is a significant misconception about what computer technology is and what it can do for the students.  People equate it with the next step beyond TV's or Video or Film Strips.  But computers are more than that.  Those devices are all one-way.  Computers communicate and that's a big difference.
<p>
Let me use an example.  About 60 years ago one of the greatest inventions known to man became popular--the television set.  TV is a great communication device.  There are thousands of educational broadcasts of one sort or another each week.  Yet, it has not been found to be a substitute for the classroom.  Will computers be any different?  YES!
<p>
The TV is a one-way device.  When used in a classroom the children simply sit and watch at the pace the program was created.  They learn only what the authors wanted to teach them.  Computers do not work that way--they can be made to, and many software developers make that mistake--but that's not what the advantage is.  
<p>
Computers, especially those hooked up to the Internet with a fast communication device, are self-paced, self-structured, self-timed educational devices.  It's much more like having your own personal teacher than like watching TV. 
<p>
Getting back to this example, some of the richest schools in the country have, for many years, put small TV studios in the schools for the kids to learn Television Production.  This is good whenever it can be done, but I think many people see the placing of computer technology as equivalent. It isn't.  For with a TV studio in the school, the children primarily learn TV production.  But with a computer network in the school, they can learn anything.
<p>
Would anyone argue today that printed textbooks are an unnecessary technology?  Of course not!  Would anyone argue that students could learn just as well if they were forbidden to take notes because they had no pens, pencils, and paper?  Of course not!  Now, today, the computer is the textbook, the pen, and the paper.  Not the weak, mangy computers they generally put into schools today, but powerful ones with fiber optic Internet communications capabilities and high-resolution text and graphics.  
<p>
I have been backing the installation of high-speed fiber-optic communications into homes, schools and businesses for nearly twenty years.  Until we do that, computers in the schools will not be able to accomplish a tenth of what they should be worth.
<p>
But what if they could?  Bill Gates has been busy buying artwork around the world, and just recently purchased (with friends) the entire Bettman Archives.  These historic pictures and photos are soon going to be distributed electronically, and if the schools have the high-resolution display systems, they will be able to benefit from accessing these images.  
<p>
Of course, Mr. Gates & Company can pocket a few more billion because he had the money and the insight to buy these collections, but it will still be beneficial to tomorrow's students.
<p>
It has long been the dream that the vast texts of the Library of Congress would be available electronically and by golly, this is happening and will happen more and more.  No school library need be thought of as small if it has access to the net.  Millions of lines of print from hundreds of newspapers are added daily as are many historic documents.  But access is the key here--free, or nearly free, unhindered access.  One computer in a corner of a school library won't cut it for this reality to work.
<p>
Dozens of computers.  The student of tomorrow should not be surprised to find that the school of tomorrow averages more than one computer per student--so pervasive should these things be!
<p>
Yeah, talk about MONEY.  The killer of so many good ideas, the destroyer of nations.  Where will the money come from?  I ask you this:  where will the money come from if we don't do it?  Who will be educated enough in the schools of tomorrow to solve the complex problems of tomorrow if we don't do something about it today?  Our nation, our great nation, is NOT ranked #1 in education--far from it.  How can this be?  It can be only because we choose not to be.  
<p>
For if you look around, you know that we ARE still #1 in so many things--in software, in aerospace, in communications technology, and on and on.  Can we afford to drop the ball for the nation's youth?  Can we solve the budget deficit problem by creating a literacy problem instead?  Can we solve it by cutting student loans and thus, student learning?  Can On-The-Job-Training really solve all our problems?  I don't think so.  
<p>
Students of tomorrow are going to need far too much basic training before "OJT" can be effective.  When Johnny Can't Read, he sure ain't gonna learn to program!
<p>
So are computers a panacea, offering a false hope of solving all the nation's educational problems but in reality being a money pit where schools waste valuable and precious financial resources with little to show in return?  They can be, they have often been in the past, and undoubtedly they will be in the future.  But they DON'T have to be.  No less than a national effort to change the way things work is required.  
<p>
With national purchasing policies in place pretty predictable price plunges are possible.   Schools must insist on good prices for high quality equipment.  The equipment must be powerful enough to run today's best applications quickly and tomorrow's applications as well.  
<p>
And software developers must begin to create products that last.  Don't be fooled by the term "Edutainment."  The two ideas are contrary.  One learns by doing, by being involved, by having an action result in a reaction.  MTV, and TV in general, may spoil many things but children are born with a quest for knowledge.  Through careful application of brain-numbing hoopla this quest is often killed before the child reaches second grade.  
<p>
Is it MTV's fault?  Yes, partially.  It is also parent's fault who plop their kid in front of a TV just to get some peace and quite for themselves for a while.  TV is a lousy baby-sitter.  And it's also parent's fault for losing interest themselves.  How many parents read to themselves, let alone to their kids these days?  How many take an interest in the environment, in local politics, and in technology in general? (Hopefully all my listeners do, but who else?)
<p>
Like parent, like child.  The sins of the parent are always vested on the child when the parent does the vesting.  So look at yourselves--do you provide a good environment for your child to learn in?  
<p>
I'm not a teacher, and I'm not advocating replacing teachers with computers or robots.  But good students usually find out that even good teachers don't know all that much about a subject and bad teachers know even less.  And that's OKAY.  After all, who can know everything about everything and if knowledge is limited in many areas, as it must be for all of us, then some students will quest for knowledge in directions the teacher has not been exposed to.  
<p>
This doesn't mean the teacher can't teach, because it is true now and will be more true later that teaching is largely a matter of steering, not rowing.  The students row--they research their reports, dissect their frogs (virtually, I hope) and write their reports.  In fact, those reports, if well written, teach the teacher.  The presentation of those reports in class, to the other students, is one of the most important functions of the classroom.  
<p>
Yet many times, only the student who did the report and the teacher ever see the result, and only they can benefit.  Here is a place computers could help, for each student could be required to read every other student's report for class, with no copying or other expensive hassles and waste.  
<p>
Each student could suggest two or three questions from their own research for the teacher to use on a test later, the test being a combination of all the student's questions about all their reports.  Sure this could be accomplished without computers, but it's easier and cheaper with them, providing the class has a good local area network.
<p>
Right now, there are several projects to place entire electronic human cadavers online for students to study.  The human body is the most fascinating thing in the universe and an endless source of study, of wonder, of amazement and of awe.  But how many classrooms today can download the images (there are 10's of thousands) and then display them?  Only a small percentage, unfortunately, and generally only the classrooms in well-to-do neighborhoods.  
<p>
This is perhaps the biggest scandal of all.  The poor students who most desperately need technology in the classroom--because they sure don't have it at home--are the last to get it!  It's a crime, it's a national shame, and it's a dangerous policy.  For the student without proper tools is just like the craftsman without proper tools--they are nothing.  They produce nothing, they are worth nothing.  
<p>
How can we as a nation be so stupid as to deny our youth the tools they need to survive in the world of tomorrow?  Isn't it bad enough that we polluted their land, used up their natural resources, and left them with a staggering debt for products they never used?  Must we also leave them ignorant as well?  Or is that part of the plan--that they won't know what evil we've done to them when they can't even read the daily paper? 
<p>
A hundred years ago slave owners were forbidden by law in some states to teach a slave to read.  Now we forbid it by design--is there that much difference between our methods of keeping the poor person poor and those of yesteryear?  And who are we hurting the most if not all of tomorrow's generation:  For the uneducated, unproductive, unskilled, hopeless and homeless person of tomorrow will prey on the educated, productive, skilled person who has what the poor person wants.  So no one wins.  
<p>
There are some very direct inverse correlation's between the educational level of a society and the crime rate.  The more the population is educated the less they turn to crime.  So it helps everyone to see that tomorrow's youth are educated well and properly.  Many nations offer free guaranteed education through college.  Why don't we do that?  Why do so many students graduate from High School unable to read at a third grade level?  It's not their fault!!   
<p>
A basic tenant of education, I think, is that when the process fails, it is the fault of the teacher, or the school, or the system, but it is NOT the fault of the student.  When you explain something to someone, anything, to anyone, it is up to you to explain it so that they understand.  If you do not use words they comprehend, then you, not they, have failed.  Their only obligation is to inform you when they do not understand what you are saying.  Then you must find other words. 
<p>
So our nations failure to educate our youth is not the fault of the youth--it is the fault of society.  It is the fault of the schools.  We need to do something and we need to do it fast.
<p>
I think computers are the only hope that we have for really turning this situation around, but it must be done correctly.  Computer theft in schools is increasing--this must be addressed.  But computers must be part of the solution.  No child can be considered educated today unless they have a basic knowledge of how computers work.  It is as important as learning their ABC's and 123's.  The emphasis should be on high-quality software and interconnectivity.   
<p>
Students should be able to explore their world through the fiber-optic cable that runs out of their desks and all over the planet from there.  Access must be fast, reliable, and there must be lots and lots of stuff for them to find as they explore.  There is. 
<p>
We've had on this show, many guests with Internet web sites, we've had fiber optic companies, we've had modern school librarians.  Next week we'll have someone from the MIT Media Lab, and we will continue to explore these issues in future shows.  Let's work together to make tomorrow be the future we all can envision and not the future we all, at this point, might expect and are rightfully afraid of.  There are so many tasks that clearly need to be accomplished.  
<p>
Colonization of the moon and other planets.  Clean-up of toxic waste sites.  Reduction in the levels of violence on TV, in the movies, and most of all on the streets.  Juries that can understand scientific evidence presented to them.  Voters who vote for their planet and not for their wallet.  
<p>
Together we can change the world--together we WILL change the world--but into what?  It's our choice and if you think your vote doesn't count, think again.  Your vote, and your voice, control the politicians and the bureaucrats, the money makers and the money lenders, your voice writes the laws and tells the lawman what to do.  So don't just sit there, communicate!  Ask Washington for answers!  Make them set a policy we can live with!  
<p>
Join us again next week on High Tech Today when we'll retract half the statements we made on this week's show, and add yet another layer of asphalt to the information superhighway!  I'm your host, Russell Hoffman and this has been HIGH TECH TODAY.  THANKS FOR LISTENING.

<I>The following full transcript is from a radio show broadcast on radio station WALE. The views expressed are solely those of Russell D. Hoffman and his guest and do not necessarily reflect anyone else's point of view.</I><p>
<hr>
<b>May 17th, 1995</b>
<p>
<i>Russell Hoffman ("Host")</i>, <i>High Tech Today</i>
<br>
<b>Victor Rozek ("VR"), General Manager, Native Forest Council</b>
<hr>
<p>
<i>Host:  And my guest today is Victor Rozek.  Victor is the General
Manager of the Native Forest Council in Eugene, Oregon, and he's
going to be talking about ecological concerns, and what high
technology has to do with ecological concerns.  Good morning Victor.
</i>
<p>
<b>VR</b>:  Good morning Russ, how are you?
<p>
<i>Host:  I'm fine thanks.  Why don't you start by telling us a
little bit about the Native Forest Council, and what you do there.
</i>
<p>
<b>VR</b>:  Alright.  The Native Forest Council was actually founded back
in 1988 and it was founded out of the concern of several people that
were previously members of the Sierra Club.  It was found that the
Sierra Club just wasn't doing enough to protect the ancient forests
here in the Northwest.
<p>
Originally our position was that we wanted to save all the old
growth, because only about 10% of it is left in the Northwest and
Nationally, only about 5% of the original old growth is left.  And
most of that--about 95, 99% is on Public Land.  So our position was:
No more old growth cutting. 
<p>
But as we evolved, and we saw the incredible damage that has been
done to our public lands, we really evolved into a position of Zero
Cut.  No logging at all on public lands, no grazing and no mining,
and we're calling for massive amounts of restoration.
<p>
<i>Host:  What relationship does technology have to the environment,
and how are you using technology to accomplish the goals of the NFC?
</i>
<p>
<b>VR</b>:  I think it has three--it relates in three ways.  There's a
positive side obviously to technology.  Technology has helped us to
know and understand the world like we've never understood it before.
<p>
I think there was certainly a watershed point were we first took
those pictures of earth from outer space.  And we realized that the
earth was just a very fragile ball that was hanging in a very hostile
darkness.  And we understood for the first time how connected
everything on the planet was.  And in knowing the earth, we also
[are] allowed to exploit it like we've never been able to exploit it
before, through the use of technology.  Technology has really sped up
our ability to destroy the planetary life support systems.  
<p>
The problem with technology basically is that it allows us to do
things but it doesn't tell us whether those things are the right
things to do.  So that, you know, a hundred years ago men would log
for example with axes and horse, and it would take them entire days
to cut down several trees and drag them out of the forest.  Now, you
can do it with chain saws and mechanized machinery of all sorts and
level a football field sized plot of earth in no time at all!
<p>
The way we use technology at the Native Forest Council--of course,
is, we're computerized like everyone else these days, and we have
databases, and we're in communication with other environmental
groups, and we have membership--we track membership on the computer
and so forth.  So, like any other organization we moved into the
twentieth century.
<p>
But, in working with the technology, especially the digital
revolution, cyberspace and all of that, what I've come to understand
is in some respects, that technology keeps us separate from the
world.  It's a very artificial place, and the more time we spend
there, I think the further and further we get from the planet.
<p>
<i>Host:  Um, How do you mean that?  I don't quite follow that. 
Certainly technology is not necessarily a virtual reality, so how
would you mean that it takes us away from the earth?
</i>
<p>
<b>VR</b>:  Well, for some people, it <i>is</i> a virtual reality, and the
problem with cyberspace and virtual reality and all of that is as
one fellow said, "Old men don't play checkers there."  It's basically
a very lonely and isolated place--you know, kids don't swim there. 
You can't play Frisbee there.  And what it does is it encourages
people <i>not</i> to work on human relationships.  You don't see
anyone's pain there.  You share no one's joy there.  Virtual
communities get all of our attention but our actual communities are
disintegrating around us.  So what happens is, in some instances,
relationships I think, become distant.  They become safe.  They
become risk-free.  We've developed an intimacy, you know in terms of
email and that sort of thing, without any responsibility.  We can
turn it off at the end of the day.
<p>
And it's interesting.  There was a bit of research that was done
recently that showed that just a single evening that was spent with
friends can measurable enhance the immune system for two days. 
That's a pretty extraordinary--That's a pretty extraordinary system.  So
my fear is that we're beginning increasingly to isolate ourselves.
<p>
<i>Host:  Lost in a sterile environment sort of thing?
</i>
<p>
<b>VR</b>:  In a very sterile--in a very unreal environment-- I mean,
there's no 'there' there.  In fact it is simply an electronic environment, and
because of that, that distancing from each other, and distancing from
the earth, we start to view the planet as sort of a puppet of
technology, right?  We dam all the rivers, we strip mine the oceans. 
Half of the world's primary forests are gone.  And I think a lot of
that stems out of that distancing.
<p>
It's very much like the technology of war.  They found that the
further distance you are from the actual killing, the easier it is to
accomplish the killing, so that a fellow dropping a bomb out of an
airplane has a lot easier time of it than somebody trying to kill
somebody hand-to-hand.  It's the same thing with the planet.  The
further removed we are, the further we encase ourselves in concrete
and glass and electronics, the more likely we are to spoil that which
supports our very life, and not even be aware of it.
<p>
<i>Host:  My guest is Victor Rozek of the Native Forest Council. 
He's the General Manager there.  You're listening to High Tech today
with your host, Russ Hoffman and Victor, you have many years--almost
two decades of experience working for IBM, so when you talk about
technology, you're not talking about it from the point of view of a
Luddite who is afraid of the machines in any way.
</i>
<p>
<b>VR</b>:  No, No.  And obviously there are so many, many good things
about technology and technology is here to stay, so I'm not
suggesting that we abandon it and return to the cave, but we are,
first and foremost biological creatures, and we're the products of
<i>billions</i> of years of very slow and very methodical evolution.  
<p>
We are in fact part of the earth.  It's interesting, the preceding
show talked about water, and in fact 70% of your surface is ocean
water, and 70% of our bodies is basically ocean water--it's salt
water, and the rest is simply made up of minerals, and chemicals that
exist here on the planet so we are actually biological, and a
part--very much a part of the planet.  But we set ourselves apart,
and I think technology is one of those barriers.  So it's a matter of
choosing to use technology wisely, I guess.
<p>
<i>Host:  ...[break]...  Victor, you're going to tell us a story now?
</i>
<p>
<b>VR</b>:  Yes.  You know, children are such wonderful teachers, and I
recall something that happened about two years ago that I'd like to
share with you.  I was driving down the Mohawk Valley where I live,
just east of Eugene with some friends of mine, and among those was a
little girl who at the time was seven years of age.  And we were kind
of dialing you know, through the different AM radio stations, and
caught a little bit of Rush Limbaugh, talking about the forest issue,
and he was, you know, ranting on and on about how logging is
absolutely essential, and that there are no problems, and there is
plenty of forests, and jobs are more important that owls, and all of
that.
<p>
And the little girl listened carefully and she kind of looked around
at the valley, which when I got here about eight years ago was pretty
pristine, and now was that the hillsides were all covered with
massive clearcut.  Which, for audience members who aren't aware is
basically a logging method by which every single living thing is
stripped from a twenty, forty, eighty acre parcel, and then the
marketable timber is carted away and the rest is simply burned.
<p>
So, these hills were horribly scared.  She looked at the hills, and
she kind of looked at the radio, and she turned to me and said "I
don't think that man gets out much!"  
<p>
<i>Host:  (Laughs)
</i>
<p>
<b>VR</b>:  And I guess that's the point I guess that I'm trying to make. 
That, you know, if you do live in a New York studio, and you go from
the studio to an air conditioned limousine, and from a limousine to a
penthouse, and from a penthouse to a restaurant, you've lost a very
primary connection.  When we open a tap and we get water, there's no
sense of where that water comes from, and what it is that keeps that
water pure.  When you buy food in the supermarket there's no sense
that it grows out of the earth, and there's no understanding of what
it takes the earth--what it takes for the earth to keep replenishing itself so that we can
have food without adding massive amounts of poisonous chemicals.
<p>
<i>Host:  Well, when I flew over Oregon for the first time last year,
I was really amazed at the 'patchwork quilt', the way the forest
looked from the clearcutting.  I guess what, they take about forty
acres and remove it, and then take another forty acres?
</i>
<p>
<b>VR</b>:  That's on public land.  But on private lands, there's a 48
square mile area of devastation...that Weyerhaeuser has stripped, I
mean, it is absolutely appalling what we're doing.  And technology, I
think, moves much quicker than our wisdom does, as a species.  So we
do things because we can, not because they're right.
<p>
There's a wonderful story about Jimmy Carter, just after Mt. St.
Helens blew up here, in the Northwest, Jimmy Carter toured the
devastation.  As he was being helicoptered to the site of the
explosion, he looked down and he said "My Gosh, I have never seen
anything like this.  This is just unbelievable--beyond
comprehension."  And what his guides had to tell him was that they
were <i>not</i> at the site of the explosion yet.  What he was seeing
was the results of logging!  Clearcut logging!
<p>
<i>Host:  (Laughs)
</i>
<p>
<b>VR</b>:  So, technology to me, also has become, I think, a massive
distraction.  And I think we're good at that.  Especially now that
we've combined television, and computers, and telephones all into
single devices and so forth.  You know--every silence is filled,
every surface hollers at us.  There's an unreality.  We are watching
actors that imitate life, and we talk about life, and we're not
living it.  
<p>
<i>Host:  What about those of us that do both?  Is that a
problem--you said you don't want to go back to the caves.  Where do
we stop?  What's the right direction to move in?
</i>
<p>
<b>VR</b>:  Well, I think it's a matter of choice, and it's a matter of
awareness.  I think the real revolution is not so much the
technological revolution but the revolution in human awareness.
<p>
<i>Host:  The knowledge revolution?
</i>
<p>
<b>VR</b>:  Not so much knowledge, knowledge for knowledge sake, but
awareness--consciousness.  My belief is that that's where the real
progress is.  That out of consciousness comes a lot of different
decisions--which knowledge to use, which knowledge not to use, and so
forth, and that's where the struggle, I think, is in humanity.  
<p>
One of the real tricky things about technology is that it really
doesn't allow very much for diversity.  If everybody has to be hooked
up, and modemed, and linked with everybody else--what about the
rights of indigenous people, who do not use technology, who for a
millennia have lived a certain lifestyle that's very compatible with
the planet.  What about the rights of those people, to exist?  And
what we're finding is that technology is encroaching on the worlds
those people have built, their homes, their forests, are being just
absolutely slaughtered at unprecedented rates, and these people have
nowhere to go.  And they may not be ready yet, for technology, but
there's no respect for that.  It's very homogenous, and that troubles
me.  
<p>
So I think it's a matter of making wise choices, and keeping
technology as a tool, and not using it as a substitute for
connectiveness to other beings and to the planet.
<p>
<i>Host:  The digital revolution is inevitable though, right?
</i>
<p>
<b>VR</b>:  Well, it's certainly marketed as inevitable, is it not?
<p>
<i>Host:  Yeah--
</i>
<p>
<b>VR</b>:  --I think it's something that is inevitable.  Obviously, human
imagination, we can't somehow slow--slow that process down.  Human
beings will evolve, and develop new technologies, and it may not be
desirable necessarily, to slow it down.
<p>
The question is not whether it's inevitable, but whether it's a
virtue, and whether the way we apply it is virtuous, and that's a
day-to-day decision, in some respects, so, yeah:  We can
track the movement of whales by satellite now, but if we choose to
use that as a method to hunt them down to extinction, is that a wise
use of that particular technology?  Those are the kinds of questions
we have to ask.
<p>
<i>Host:  I think that that sort of thing is happening a lot, where
we are using technology to define a very exact limit to how much
damage we can do, when in truth doing damage just isn't really a good idea.
</i>
<p>
<b>VR</b>:  Indeed.  And that's the awareness revolution that I'm talking
about, I think that that's what people are grappling with.
<p>
The real tricky part is that the system--the social structures--are
going to evolve a lot more slowly than our awareness is--than our
understanding is.  So, the structures are really set up and to a
great extent, for example:  Corporate structures are set up to work
off of quarterly profitability, and they embrace a paradigm that says
that it's possible to infinitely grow, and that there are basically
infinite resources available to corporations, and that simply isn't
true, and we have yet to change that structure.  We still embrace
that structure, and yet we know that in fact it cannot work
forever.  The only thing that grows indefinitely is cancer, right?
<p>
<i>Host:  Well, I think that corporations have an Ace in the Hole,
that they can pull out any time they want.  Dow Chemical just pulled
it out, uh, yesterday I guess.  When things go really wrong, they
just hit the panic button--Chapter 11, and it's not their problem
anymore!
</i>
<p>
<b>VR</b>:  (Laughs)  That's true.  Corporations interestingly have far
more rights than human beings do, and that's problematic here, and if
you look at some of the legislation that is passing congress, bills like
GATT and NAFTA.  Now, I looked at those and they're basically
resource-grabbing pieces of legislation.  They basically delineate
two entities on the planet--there are corporations, and there are
resources.  And they've kind of codifying the corporate 'right' to grab
the entire planet's resources!   These poor countries that have
borrowed massive amounts of money from the World Bank and so forth,
can't pay back those loans, have nothing but their naturally resources
now with which to barter, they are absolutely getting raked.  And
certainly we know that a country that exports its natural resources
has <i>never</i> profited from that.
<p>
<i>Host:  It has nothing left.
</i>
<p>
<b>VR</b>:  So not only their economic base, but the resource as well.
<p>
<i>Host:  ...[break]...We only have a couple of minutes left, so why
not tell us a little bit about what the Native Forest Council is
doing right now.
</i>
<p>
<b>VR</b>:  We're still involved in litigation.  We're appealing what is
known as Option Nine, which is the Clinton Forest Grant, and some
timber sales that have resulted from that, and in fact we go to court
on Monday to appeal those timber sales.  It's very problematic at
this point because the congress has passed--both houses have passed
versions of a salvage 'rider' which would mandate unconscionably high
cut levels around the country.  This has been opposed by the Forest
Service, the Bureau of Land Management, Scientists, Fire Fighters,
just about everybody, but nonetheless the timber industry has
basically 'purchased' the legislation.  If the President signs it, it
will circumvent all of the environmental laws and prevent any legal
challenge.  So, it's a pretty nasty piece of legislation and we're
working very hard to knock that down.
<p>
<i>Host:  They're also circumventing the Endangered Species Act at
the time, so I guess you have you're work cut out for you!
</i>
<p>
<b>VR</b>:  Yeah.  It circumvents all environmental laws and basically
says: "Regardless of what the requirements are legally, that this new
bill meets those requirements, so, yeah, we do, and we expect another
big fight over E.S.A. in congress, Slate Gordon has introduced a bill
that would basically gut it.
<p>
<i>Host:  What did you think of [Al Gore's] book Earth in the
Balance?
</i>
<p>
<b>VR</b>:  Al Gore?  I'd like to find out who's keeping him captive, and
I'd love to free him up!  (Both laugh.)  I think that book says a lot
of the right things, and it's amazing what happens to people once
they get in office.  They just seem to disappear and they simply
don't stand up for what they believe.  I think that's a lot of the
problem with the Clinton administration, is that it doesn't stand for
anything, at least not for very long.
<p>
<i>Host:  Well, I'll never get corrupted, I couldn't even get elected
head of my basketball team in High School...
<p>
...Is there anything else you'd like to add--we've got about one
minute left?...
</i>
<p>
<b>VR</b>:  Well, let me close with this I guess.  What profit in a man to
gain bandwidth, but lose his soul?  So, food for thought.
<p>
<i>Host:  Okay.
</i>
<p>
<b>VR</b>:  Thank you for having me on, Russell.
<p>
<i>Host:  My guest has been Victor Rozek, the General Manager of the
Native Forest Council in Eugene, Oregon...

<p>
<i>Russell Hoffman ("Host"), High Tech Today</i>
<br>
<b> H. Alan Wood ("HW"), Bioengineer</b>
<hr>
<p>
<i>Host:  ...And you're listening to High Tech Today with your host,
Russell Hoffman.  If you've been listening to the show you know that
we've had a number of environmentalists on the show of one sort or
another, and of course on this radio show we believe that technology
is one of the solutions to environmental problems.
<p>
One of the big problems in agriculture is the use of chemical fertilizers
and chemical pesticides.  This was first realized probably about forty
years ago in a book called Silent Spring by Rachel Carson.  
<p>
There are not too many good solutions to the problem, because
chemical fertilizers and chemical pesticides increase crop yield, and
people are starving because there's not enough food, all around the
world.  So, it's really a tradeoff between "Do we help the environment of
tommorrow or do we help citizens of today--people of today?"  
<p>
One potential silver bullet is something called bioengineered
pesticides.  And these are--Gee, rather than explain what they are
I'm going to introduce my guest.  He's H. Alan Wood of the 
Boise-Thompson Institute for Plant Research at Cornell University. 
He is also the head of a company called Agrivirion, and he's going
to be talking to us about bioengineered pesticides--the good, the
bad, and the ugly.  And, I'd like to welcome you to the show.
</i>
<p>
<b>HW</b>:  Thank you.
<p>
<i>Host:  Tell us a little bit, first of all, what kind of technology
are we talking about, for the complete lay person, where are we?
</i>
<p>
<b>HW</b>:  Well, biological control is really, is an area where we're trying to
use organisms which Mother Nature uses in kind of, maintaining plant
pests in kind of ecologically acceptable levels.
<p>
In nature, these plant pests don't get out of control under natural
conditions, but what's happened is this world has shrunk and all--we
have a lot of plant pests moving into new environments just through
the normal commerce, and also in agriculture, we've created a very
unnatural situation, so the natural balance is no longer the
[determinant] force.  And what we're trying to do, is try to use some
of these agents as alternatives to chemical pesticides, to put things
back in check in a more natural way.
<p>
<i>Host:  Your company is involved in several different technologies
that are related to this.  Why not tell us a little about--you
mentioned two strategies, or two technologies in particular?
</i>
<p>
<b>HW</b>:  Allright.  The main problem with Mother
Nature's--with what Mother Nature provides to us, is that these biological
control agents--for instance I'm working on controlling insect pests. 
They don't work very fast.  They're very slow.  And so, you can get a
lot of damage continuing to occur with the use of these alternatives
to chemicals. And they're also very costly.  And, what Agrivarion is
involved in is finding ways in which we can produce these biological
control agents very cheaply.  Costs that are equivalent to chemical
pesticides.  And at the same time, allow for the genetic improvement
of these biopesticides so that they can be much more effective.
<p>
The problem with releasing a genetically engineered organism to the
environment, as we see it, is you don't know what the ecological consequences
are going to be.  You know that these genetically improved organisms
are very safe to humans.  They're not going to cause any problems
whatsoever.  But we're concerned about ecological problems.  So we've
developed technology that you can--for instance, you can produce a
genetically improved virus, deliver it to the field, it will kill all
the insects--and then it will disappear.  There's no environmental
persistence to it, so therefore there couldn't be any ecological
problems associated with it.
<p>
<i>Host:  What sort of mechanisms cause it to disappear?  I mean, is
that a chemical breakdown, or do they get eaten [by insects] and then
that destroys it?
</i>
<p>
<b>HW</b>:  What we've done is we've looked very carefully at how the
virus replicates.  And we looked and we saw that it had an Achilles
heal.  And that if you removed one of the genes, that was required
for the persistence of the virus in the environment, that we could
eliminate the persistence very easily.  In fact we've done field
testing with this, we've done three field releases just to test this
strategy.  We haven't even inserted any new genes, only deleted the
one gene that's the Achilles heal.  And what we found is that we
can't find the virus anymore.  It's totally disappeared.
<p>
<i>Host:  This technology--how long have people actually been
developing products that may someday be put in the field?
</i>
<p>
<b>HW</b>:  Well, genetic engineering of plants and organisms to be
put into the field really started over twenty years ago.  It's only
recently that these products are now getting to the point where we
can start to use them in agriculture.  It's taken a long time to
develop them because there are a lot of intricacies.  We have to--we
have to learn a lot about them, how they work in nature in order to
be able to effectively use them as alternatives to chemicals.
<p>
<i>Host:  I guess last year there was a tomato that was released that
was bioengineered?
</i>
<p>
<b>HW</b>:  Ah, yes--the FlavorSaver tomato.
<p>
<i>Host:  Yeah, that's the one.
</i>
<p>
<b>HW</b>:  What they simply did there is they slowed the--there's a
gene that produces a protein that allows the tomato to ripen on the
vine.  What they did is they decreased the amount of that protein
that's being produced that controls ripening.  So you can have a very
hard red tomato on the vine, as opposed to a soft one.  And then
they can ship it.  And so it's very tasty--like a vine ripened
tomato.
<p>
<i>Host:  Yeah, the only good tomatoes you can get other than
something like that are the ones where you go to the farm basically,
and pick them out.  Because store-bought tomatoes are picked green,
and then they're chemically treated--
</i>
<p>
<b>HW</b>:  That's right
<p>
<i>Host:  --to turn colors.  So, that's the kind of breakthrough that
we're looking for, almost sort of like Birdseye's frozen peas fifty
or 80 years ago.  A way to get fresher food to the populace, which
actually may have health benefits.
</i>
<p>
<b>HW</b>:  Exactly.  One of the things your listeners might be
interested in in terms of actually seeing Mother Nature's biological
controls in action, is with the Gypsy moths in the Northeastern United
States.
<p>
<i>Host:  It's a devastating problem--...  
</i>
<p>
<b>HW</b>:  ...A devastating problem, and if you ever look on a
hillside and have seen trees that are completely stripped of all
their leaves, if you went in very closely and looked at those trees,
what you'd find is instead of--replacing those leaves, are now dead
gypsy moth larvae.  When all the leaves have disappeared, a virus
epidemic takes place, and eliminates all the insects, and that's why
the next year, the trees are perfectly healthy and fine.
<p>
<i>Host:  In that particular instance, it's why trying to fight it is
really kind of a losing battle.  Eventually it's going to fight
itself, but you have to let it get to that stage.
</i>
<p>
<b>HW</b>:  That's right, that's Mother Nature's way of dealing with
it.  The problem is, in agriculture, you can't allow the crop to
be destroyed!  You need--and in biological control, what you do is you try to create
that virus epizootic--virus epidemic--before all the damage is done. 
And that's the trick.
<p>
<i>Host:  And as you mentioned earlier we've really messed with
Mother Nature rather substantially, and in many cases it's not
taking--things aren't taking effect the way Nature intended them to
do so, it may seem like an end-run around the problem, but that's
another reason why bioengineered pesticides might be a benefit to the
public.  You're listening to High Tech Today with your host, Russell
Hoffman.  My guest today is H. Alan Wood of the 
Boise-Thompson Institute for Plant Research at Cornell
University...
<p>
...[break]...
<p>
...We're talking about bioengineered pesticides.  Gene splicing. 
Tell us a little bit about how one goes about doing genetic research
and actually accomplishing some of these splicing techniques.  I
mean--you don't do it with a razor!
</i>
<p>
<b>HW</b>:  No, it's done with, actually, at one time, twenty five
years ago, a very sophisticated technology but now, technology that
high school students can use, for moving genes around.  All you need
is uh, about $20,000 worth of equipment, and it's very simple, to
take--to identify genes in different organisms, and to cut them out using
very specific types of enzymes, and then insert them into new
organisms.
<p>
<i>Host:  So the entry-level for this type of research is actually
quite low?
</i>
<p>
<b>HW</b>:  Yes it is.  Today it is.  You can buy kits, and
instruction manuals.  
<p>
<i>Host:  Isn't that going to make it more difficult for the EPA to
regulate it?  If thousands of companies can do it easily, we might
have a problem there?
</i>
<p>
<b>HW</b>:  Well, within the laboratories there are a whole host of
regulations, in the U.S., that have been overseeing this technology. 
Ever since it was first invented.  And it's worked very successfully,
in all instances.  And once you move out of the laboratory, into the
environment, then there is a multitude of requirements and oversights
that take place, most of which I consider really acceptable, and
totally appropriate.
<p>
<i>Host:  Tell us a little bit also about using this type of research
to make medications, or new medicine.
</i>
<p>
<b>HW</b>:  Well, yeah.  One of the really interesting things is that we're
able to--when we genetically engineer viruses to improve their
pesticidal properties, we're simply inserting the new gene in, that
has a particular type of activity.  For biopesticides, you can insert
things like a hormone that the insect is only supposed to produce at a
particular time, and by inserting it into the virus and the virus
inhances this hormone, the insect gets all upset and out of whack. 
<p>
But you can also insert genes that code for pharmaceutically
important products, such as Interferon, for instance.  And then when
the virus replicates, it makes a huge amount of Interferon also, and
there's a lot of commercial interest in it.  In fact, the first AIDS
vaccine that was used for human testing, was produced using an insect
virus.
<p>
<i>Host:  So, that's another way that bioengineering might actually
be saving lives.  
<p>
Now, the risk that's involved.  Tell us a little bit about what
different areas there is risk, and what are things that are being
done to minimize that risk.  Even the 'worst case' scenarios.  What
are those?
</i>
<p>
<b>HW</b>:  Worst case scenarios.  Well, the area that I'm most
familiar with in terms of genetic engineering and release have to do
with these insect-specific viruses.  They only replicate in
invertebrates--in [something] without a backbone.  And usually only in two
or three organisms will one of these viruses replicate.
<p>
There's been a lot of testing done on the human issue, in terms of
any health problems.  There is none.  It's absolute.
<p>
The problem is, is that we're introducing new organisms to the
environment, and what are the potential ecological consequences of that? 
That's the main issue that we see.  And we really don't know enough
about the ecological interactions of these viruses, and the
environment, to be able to make absolute decisions about their
safety.
<p>
And that's one of the reasons why we developed a technique whereby
the virus won't persist in the environment.  And if it's not--if it's
only there for a very limited period of time, then its potential
interactions with other organisms in the environment are practically nil.
<p>
<i>Host:  Where do you see this technology going in the future?
</i>
<p>
<b>HW</b>:  Well, it's going to grow enormously.  First of all,
because of all the environmental health issues associated with it,
making it so attractive to farmers.  Once we've improved their
pesticidal activity and we've reduced their cost, it will be able to
compete with chemicals very effectively.
<p>
<i>Host:  And you're listening to High Tech today...
<p>
...[break]...
<p>
...My guest, H. Alan Wood of the Boise-Thompson Institute for Plant Research at Cornell University
and a researcher in bioengineered pesticides. Why not tell us a little bit about how big this field is now,
how fast it's growing, and when you got into it.
</i>
<p>
<b>HW</b>:  When I got into it twenty years ago, quite honestly I thought that
the use of insect viruses as pesticides was really not going to
happen.  But over the years, and particularly due to that fact that we've now
genetically improved them, it's obvious that it is a very quickly 
growing field.  Worldwide, there are hundreds of researchers in
academia and in industry that are involved in developing these new
genetically engineered products.
<p>
<i>Host:  And the products--there are some on the market now?  How
common are they becoming?  What percentage of farmers, for example,
are using them now?
</i>
<p>
<b>HW</b>:  Well, the genetically engineered biopesticides that are
being used today are ones which are genetically engineered into
plants.  For instance, Cotton, which is--and Potatoes, which recently
have been released, contain a...toxin, a bacterial toxin, that
controls insect pests.
<p>
Microbes, such as the viruses that I work with--none of them are
commercially available--that are prominent viruses.  These are all in
the developmental stage, and it will probably be five or six years
before we see any of them on the market.
<p>
<i>Host:  So we're still looking at a very new technology.  Is it a
good investment area--now, of course, you've got your own company, so
maybe that's not a fair question but--are a lot of investors--let's
put it this way:  Are a lot investors going in that direction?  Is it
still getting a lot of 'seed' money, if I can use the term?
</i>
<p>
<b>HW</b>:  I think there's a moderate amount.  I think right now some of the
large chemical companies are starting to put a large amount of money
into it.  And if some of the new products can 'walk' out of the
laboratory into the field for testing I think there will be a lot
more investment interest.
<p>
Remember, the ag/virotech area is not one--it's one that promised an
awful lot in the beginning and it's only, you know, twenty years
ago--it's only very recently that it's starting to pay off.
<p>
<i>Host:  So it hasn't really been that good an investment, for a lot
of people, up to this point, but we're perhaps turning a corner? 
People are getting more and more fed up with chemical--the
problems with chemical pesticides, insecticides, and fertilizers.
</i>
<p>
<b>HW</b>:  Oh, definitely.  Yes.  Another aspect is that a lot of
the pesticides that were used several years ago, are no longer
available to many of the farmers.  Back in 1989 there were
45,000 active products that were registered as pesticides. 
Since then over 32,000 of them have been dropped!
<p>
And the registrations that have been dropped for pesticide usage 
in...crops, that's all the crops, things that you
find in the supermarkets.  Those farmers are now looking for new
alternatives.  They need to find a way to control the pests in the
crops.  And biological control is a quick, and soon becoming a very
cheap and effective, way of solving the problem.
<p>
<i>Host:  You've mentioned a couple of times that these--the ones
that are designed to be released are absolutely not dangerous to human
beings.  That's very different from chemicals.  The farmer is
actually at greatest risk from the use of the chemicals.  Greater
risk than the people that are eating his fruits--he's, you
know, pouring tons and tons of this stuff out every season, and it's
very dangerous.  The things that you're talking about, now they're
not necessarily going to be like that.  You can hold them, because
they don't attack man.  They attack the insects.
</i>
<p>
<b>HW</b>:  They only attack insects.  In fact, these viruses--the
non engineered forms of these viruses, we consume every day in our fresh
vegetables.  They're out there, Mother Nature is, you know, using
them.  In fact, it's estimated that in a typical serving of cole
slaw, that you consume lets see, a million of these insect viruses.
<p>
<i>Host:  Insects actually have traditionally used a wide variety of
chemical means to attack other insects, and crops and so forth. 
In fact they're probably nature's first Chemists.
</i>
<p>
<b>HW</b>:  We're exposed to these all the time.  And the farmer really
loves these, because he doesn't have to take all of the safety
precautions--that also cost a great deal of money to [achieve the safety
level] that's required for many of these chemicals.  It's cheaper and
it's easier for him.
<p>
<i>Host:  Okay.  We're just about running out of time, so why not
tell us a little bit about your actual corporation.  What type of
people out there would be interested in contacting your
corporation?
</i>
<p>
<b>HW</b>:  Well, people who are interested in new emerging
technologies with respect to agriculture.
<p>
<i>Host:  Would these be large or small farmers?
</i>
<p>
<b>HW</b>:  No, we're not--we're really dealing with the larger
production type of thing.  Agrivarion is not involved in marketing as
such.  We're working with larger companies, large enough to do this,
because agriculture just doesn't work that well at all--you have to go out
and do your own marketing.
<p>
<i>Host:  You're basically a research institute?
</i>
<p>
<b>HW</b>:  Basically a research and development company.  And, we're
not only interested in the agricultural applications, but also in the
very cheap production of many pharmaceutical type products.  And in many
instances that's a much more profitable area to be working in.
<p>
<i>Host:  My guest today has been H. Alan Wood of the 
Boise-Thompson Institute for Plant Research at Cornell University and
also the head of Agrivarion, which is headquartered in New York
City...I'd like to thank you very much for being on the show today.
</i>
<p>
<b>HW</b>:  It's been a pleasure, Russell.
<p>
<i>Host:  Okay, and we've certainly been very interested in learning
about this area of High Technology...Thanks everybody for
listening...Bye Bye!

<h1> 1995-The Year In Review </h1>
<hr>
<p>
1995 had many interesting things happen in the world of High Tech. 
<p>
On December 29th, 1995 Russell Hoffman, Host of High Tech Today, and Michael Bannan, the show's producer, discussed the things they felt were especially significant.  
<p>
We don't have the text of the show online, but here's the list:
<p>
<b>Important events for 1995 in the world of Technology.</b>
<br>
<i>Most involve computers but we've thrown in a few others, just for fun.</i>
<hr>
<DL>
  <DT> <b>THE WEB</b>
       <DD> Well, of course it's number one.  The web exploded in 1995 and this will always be remembered as the year that happened.  Ads on T.V. routinely give WEB addresses.
  <DT> <b>NETSCAPE</b>
       <DD> See THE WEB, above, of course, but basically any time a company goes public and reaches around a billion dollars in a week and <i>then</i> reaches <b>six</b> billion dollars a few months later, it's bound to be a big event.  Not that it's ever happened before.
  <DT> <b>WIN 95</b>
       <DD> The big thing about Windows 95 was that, if anything, it didn't seem like such a big deal after all, no matter <i>who</i> sang about it.
  <DT> <b>FREE SPEECH ON THE WEB</b>
       <DD>Most of the talk about free speech on the web centered on porn, but due in part to the tragic Oklahoma bombing, other questions about the limits of free speech are being asked as well.  
  <DT> <b>COMPUSERVE BANS 200 INTERNET GROUPS</b>
       <DD>At the time this is being written CompuServe had just agreed to ban, at the request of the German government, access to some 200 Internet discussion groups.  It is amazing that U.S. citizens paying for and using a U.S. company's product in the U.S. are forced to abide by some other country's ideas of free speech.  How can <i>that</i> be right?  (Note: On February 14th,1 996 they announced a discontinuation of the suspension.)
  <DT> <b>FRENCH NUCLEAR TESTS</b>
       <DD>The French exploded a number of nuclear weapons in the Pacific ocean, over a large number of protests and possibly a few dead bodies.  Why?  Because, they said, they needed to calibrate their simulation software so that they won't have to explode more bombs!!
  <DT> <b>AOL BECOMES #1 ACCESS PROVIDER</b>
       <DD>AOL does a lot of things right, and it seems to be paying off.  In 1995, first they became the largest Access Provider.  Then, they became larger than the next two (CompuServe and Prodigy) <i>combined</i>.  But they still have a long way to go:  Currently they have about 4 million users.  Expect to see close to 10 million by the end of 1996!
  <DT> <b>PENTIUM'S NOW STANDARD</b>
       <DD>Nearly every year something new comes along, but they seldom kill the last level of technology as well as Pentium's killed 486's.  And I say good riddance!
  <DT> <b>TELEPHONE COMPANIES BECAME ANSWERING MACHINES TOO</b>
       <DD>This is part of a trend, and that's why it's important.  The telephone companies want more parts of your business, and if they're going to get it, they have to provide new services.  This is one of the most important.  They better do it <i>reliably!</i>
  <DT> <b>SATELLITE HOME TV</b>
       <DD>It's bloody expensive, but it's there.  120 channels, even more.  You end up averaging 50 channels per hour and almost never see an entire show.
  <DT> <b>CALIFORNIA COUGH'S AT ELECTRIC CARS</b>
       <DD>California was going to force car makers to have a significant percentage of electric vehicles on the road soon, but basically caved in completely for now.
  <DT> <b>TOY STORY</b>
       <DD>First completely computer animated cartoon.  From Pixar, from Disney, with Tom Hanks.  It's cute.  Not bad for a first try!
  <DT> <b>SPACE PROBE LEAVES SOLAR SYSTEM</b>
       <DD>One of our space probes left the solar system and continued to send back signals as it began to travel <i>to the Universe, and Beyond!</i>
  <DT> <b>BILL GATES' NEW HOME NOT FINISHED</b>
       <DD>I guess all the software programmers were pulled off to get WINDOWS 95 out the door before it had to be renamed.
  <DT> <b>PHRASE "SURFING THE NET" ADOPTED</b>
       <DD>Came from last year's popular phrase Channel Surfing, of course.
  <DT> <b>GOVERNMENT BACKS OUT OF BACKING THE INTERNET</b>
       <DD>Just like that, out they went.  Net had to become basically self-sufficient in 1995.  Didn't seem to be a problem, though.
  <DT> <b>MICROSOFT "EMBRACES" THE WEB</b>
       <DD>Yeah!  But wait.  What do they mean they are going to support the standards by adding their own?
  <DT> <b>JAVA</b>
       <DD>JAVA didn't really happen in 1995, but we all heard about it and expect it to do wonders for the WEB.
  <DT> <b>IBM BOUGHT LOTUS</b>
       <DD>And it cost them billions, but they didn't buy it for Lotus-123.  Nope, they bought them for they're email products.
  <DT> <b>MULTIMEDIA MARKET WAS SOFT</b>
       <DD>Edutainment proved not to be that entertaining, or not that educating, or something.  Many small companies got bought by bigger ones or folded altogether.  Tough year for Mediocre Multimedia Mogels.
  <DT> <b>14.4 AND 4X STANDARD</b>
       <DD>That's 14.4 modems and 4X CD-ROM's, of course.  Next year will be 28.8 and 6X or maybe if we're really lucky, ISDN cabling and 8X CD-ROM drives.
  <DT> <b>FIBER OPTIC AND ISDN GREW AGAIN</b>
       <DD>One or both of these technologies will reach critical mass soon and really will take off.  Personally, I hope it's fiber, but ISDN companies set up some important standards in 1995.
  <DT> <b>NIELSON RATED THE INTERNET</b>
       <DD>That means it's big.  And they found that it is indeed big, with several million financial transactions occuring and 10's of millions of users.
  <DT> <b>WIRED GOT TIRED</b>
       <DD>It was a cool magazine at the start of the year, but by the end nobody really cared anymore.  Too hyped, I guess.  But then, they predicted this would happen, and that's always cool.
  <DT> <b>DILBERT REACHED 1000 NEWSPAPERS</b>
       <DD>Scott Adam's, who draws Dilbert, is every nerd's hero.  He's obviously been in the trenches a long time and now he laughs at it, and makes us laugh at it too.  Hoo-Ray for Dilbert and Dogbert!
  <DT> <b>250,000 PEOPLE BUILT HOME PAGES</b>
       <DD>I was one of them.  Hope you were too!
  <DT> <b>CONGRESS TRIED TO STOP FUNDING PUBLIC TELEVISION</b>
       <DD>That went over like a lead balloon.
  <DT> <b>NET HOT SPOTS MEASURED IN MILLIONS OF "HITS"</b>
       <DD>Big numbers for the most popular Web sites.  People went there, and advertisers noticed.
  <DT> <b>MSN WENT ONLINE</b>
       <DD>Microsoft Network, but who knows where it will end up. 
  <DT> <b>TALEGENT & COLIDA CANCELLED</b>
       <DD>IBM and APPLE went up a mountain together but came down on opposite sides of a hill.
  <DT> <b>DVD'S READY FOR PRIME TIME</b>
       <DD>Digital Video Disks are just CD-ROM's that hold a lot of data, enough for a full-length movie.  At last!
  <DT> <b>MICROSOFT FAILS TO BUY INTUIT</b>
       <DD>Microsoft didn't really try <i>that</i> hard.
  <DT> <b>JUSTICE DEPARTMENT FAILS TO COOK MICROSOFT'S GOOSE</b>
       <DD>Janet Reno didn't really try <i>that</i> hard.
  <DT> <b>U. OF CALIFORNIA ACCEPTS ADMISSION APPLICATIONS THROUGH NET</b>
       <DD>Soon everyone will be doing it.
  <DT> <b>JURY FAILED TO FOLLOW COMPLEX SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE</b>
       <DD>The gap between the educated and the uneducated grew, too.  Coincidence?
  <DT> <b>ELECTRONIC TOLL ROAD OPENS IN CALIFORNIA</b>
       <DD>Yecch!  Hey anybody ever hear the phrase "This land is your land, this land is my land"?
  <DT> <b>GOVERNMENT DOES NEXT TO NOTHING</b>
       <DD>Does not install massive quantities of computers in schools, distribute them to handicapped people, give poor people Internet access at libraries.  But they talked a lot about it, again.  
  <DT> <b>ANOTHER SILLY VR MOVIE</b>
       <DD>Look people, let's just get this straight:VR people aren't going to come out of the machine and you aren't going into it.  Another silly movie descended from TRON.  And falling fast.  Johnny Pneumatic.
  <DT> <b>BUT "THE NET" WAS GOOD</b>
       <DD>Even if it wasn't it didn't matter because Sandra Bullock was in it.  
</DL>
<p>
<hr>
Well, that's our list for 1995.  Overall, thanks to the Internet, we found 1995 to be the <b> most exciting year so far </b> in the computer/technology world.  Hope this list brings back fond memories!
<p>

<h1> 1986-A Look to the Future </h1>
<hr>
<p>
<i>I was sorting through some old papers and found this article I wrote
for a local (at the time) computer club newsletter called Connecticut
Computer Society (CCS) News. 
It was printed in the April, 1986 issue and contains some ideas about
what the future would hold.  Now, 10 years later, I am putting the
article on the Web for historical and/or hysterical purposes...
<p>
Sure, I don't agree with all of it anymore, some of it seems
downright silly--but I think you'll agree that it helps put 
things in perspective to review something like this "after the fact".

<hr>
<p>
<H3>Future Access</H3>
<H4>By Russell D. Hoffman</H4>
<H5>First printed in CCS NEWS, April, 1986</H5>
<p>
A lot of industry talk about downturns and upturns and so on in the
computer field leads me to want to state my opinion.  The whole world
of computerization possible in the home has not even begun to occur. 
The machines that are being sold now will be replaced by machines two
orders of magnitude different in the next 3-6 years--one order lower
in price, one up in power.  This will be repeated several times
before the end of the century.  The average home will have DOZENS of
computers, many of which will of course be dedicated to single
tasks--controlling climate (including solar equipment), answering the
phone (intelligently), and so on.
<p>
Likewise, the T.V. will get much smarter and be able, for instance,
to broadcast not two but as many stations as you like in as many
"windows" as you like in as many sizes as you like--on multiple
screens thoughout the house.  Simple technology, really.  The decisive
factor is manufacturing costs and producer-willingness to spend "R. & D."
(Research and Development) money on complex operating systems (and
the ever-present debacle--how do we interface this power with the
user?).  A major change will occur as super-fast, low-power
comsumption, computers-on-chips allow lower development costs and push
ever-important "chip count" down.  (Higher chip counts generally
mean higher manufacturing costs, more power usage, lower
reliability, and so on.)
<p>
One possible way to interface common household devices would be with
a computer/keyboard/display unit which uses an infared connection
like the PC jr.'s, but the whole unit might be about the size of the
Junior's keyboard, with a flip-up electroluminescent display.  One
might "activate" the device to be "reprogrammed" by touching a switch
on the device and then use the keyboard and associated programs to
control it.
<p>
Some day, a fiber optic cable will wind its way into everybody's
homes and shortly thereafter a new information revolution will occur.
(At least I hope so.)  We will no longer need to restrict ourselves
to the tiny amount of variety that three major networks and cable
provide (remember, I said T.V.s would get smarter, not television
programs!) because inexpensive audio/video can enter the home (let's
say you want to watch a class going on at M.I.T., or the U.S.
Congress in action...).  We will demand access to more (and more
timely) information from our news and reference sources, and
(hopefully) greater accessibility to public officials, corporations,
and the information sources.
<p>
Of course, the whole Key is an understanding by Corporate America of
the importance of intelligent machines.  An oven should be built not
only to last but to be aware of things like its own energy usage.  A
radio should know the name of its owner and favorite radio stations.
(I often go to Boston or New York, and would like to be able to reset
all the buttons to all the stations I found on previous trips to those
cities).  In fact I should be able to carry my little keyboard around
and program any car radio and the rest of the car too, at the same
instant to my liking.  It should know what stations are available
from public databases maintained by the F.C.C. and broadcast on
"sidebands."  And of course, my car should know where I am at all
times and what current road-construction, traffic, and accidents
might be in the area to affect my journey.  A "black box" should be
recording my driving in case of an accident just like an airplane
pilot's.  Driving is very dangerous and I, for one, feel that many
incompetents do virtually as much damage as the "voluntarily
incompetent" (drunks).  In any case, black boxes would settle many
issues as to who was at fault, which all careful drivers should
applaud.
<p>
The public library will eventually disappear unless public reading
rooms are desired and unless historical documents rate heavy
importance.  All information will be accessed though the computer and
if you have trouble finding what you want, distant people connected
by electronic means will take the place of the librarian.  
<p>
If people have been dreaming about these things for years, where is
all this stuff?
<p>
I think we are still a long way from most of it, because the hardware
to do a really good job is just now becoming available at reasonable
prices.  Multi-channel T.V.'s are just coming out and are expensive. 
Figuring out just how to present intelligent machines to the public
which often doesn't even perceive a need for them is a very tricky
business and hardly one with many known successes.  And if the public
thinks two-channel T.V. is a leap and a bound more amazing than
one-channel T.V., why sell them any more?  We are not a country of
high-tech gadgeteers despite what we may think ourselves to be.  We
are often satisfied with the very scum of the technological world.
<p>
But then, when I.B.M. first started making computers, they had no
idea that they could sell so many of them.  Economics forced computers
into the business world but that won't happen in the home market. 
The computerized T.V. of tomorrow may be cheaper but that will be due
to mechanized manufacturing that every product will be involved with. 
The chip count will be much lower than in today's T.V.'s but they may
always be a fairly high-ticket item.  All this means that in order
for T.V.'s to get smarter (at almost no cost when the R&D is averaged
out over many units) people have to want it and business has to
percieve that desire and act on it.
<p>
Of course, the big question is:  When will robots come into the home,
do the dishes, turn up the "dumb" thermostat, walk the dog and never
put the dinner to bed and cook the baby?
<p>
We can begin to conceive of robotic applications for the home only
when comsumers are totally comfortable with intelligent mechanical
devices that don't move around.

<p>
<i>Russell Hoffman ("Host")</i>, <i>High Tech Today</i>
<br>
<b> Amy Wohl ("AW"), President of Wohl & Associates and Editor of The Trends Letter</b>
<hr>
<p>
<i>Host:  ...And my guest today is Amy Wohl.  She's the President of
Wohl and Associates, which is a research firm based in--Pennsylvania I
believe?
</i>
<p>
<b>AW</b>:  Yes, that's right.
<p>
<i>Host:  --And the Editor of The Trends Letter, which is a
newsletter about the computer industry.  And today we're going to be
talking about Microsoft, and its effect on the industry, which has
been great, and I'd like to welcome you to the show first of all.
</i>
<p>
<b>AW</b>:  Well, thank's a lot Russ, I'm happy to be here.
<p>
<i>Host:  Thanks for coming on.  Now, Microsoft has done, I guess, in
my opinion, something no other company in history has done, which is,
they've become a multibillion dollar company by selling something
that really nobody needs--namely an operating system--
</i>
<p>
<b>AW</b>:  (Laughs)
<p>
<i>Host:  --which is just a tool, a means to an end.
</i>
<p>
<b>AW</b>:  Yes.
<p>
<i>Host:  They've sold a few other products and now they're out
buying a lot of things, like the Bettmann Archives.  What influences
do you think are perhaps most important for the coming couple of years?  
What are they going to do to us next?
</i>
<p>
<b>AW</b>:  Well, I think that the important thing to remember about
Microsoft, is the reason they've had such amazing durability as a
company, all out of proportion really to their size, and also to the
kinds of products that they've sold at any one moment in time, has
really been that they're very flexible, and they've been very clever
about being able to peer ahead into the marketplace, see what's going
to happen next, and make sure that they're going to have a piece of
that thing that's going to happen next.
<p>
In order to do that, they've had a lot of failures as well as a lot
of successes, but over a long period of time people tend to remember
the things that they did well with, and to really remember very well
the things that just sort of went away.
<p>
It's also important to remember that not all the things you just
mentioned are actually Microsoft, although certainly Microsoft's
money made them possible.  The investment, for instance, in the
Bettmann's Archives, is part of a company that's owned by Bill Gates,
but which is technically not owned by Microsoft at all.
<p>
<i>Host:  Right, Right--thanks for correcting that fact.
</i>
<p>
<b>AW</b>:  Bill has been buying up the digital rights to much of the
artwork and images in the world.  If we're not careful he's soon
going to own every image in every museum (laughs) around the
world--except the French.  The French have been steadfastly refusing
to sell him anything.  And I'm not sure whether I mind that a lot or
whether I don't.  I guess it depends on whether he limits the access
to the digital use of those images, or he charges a lot for them.  I
think I'd mind a lot if he did that.
<p>
<i>Host:  I fear that my complaint will be that he'll only offer low
resolution versions of things, and to get high-resolution versions
you'll have to spend a lot of money.
</i>
<p>
<b>AW</b>:  Yes.
<p>
<i>Host:  And that that's how he'll--that's just my guess as to what
he's going to do.
</i>
<p>
<b>AW</b>:  Yes.  But I suspect that that's only a small corner of
his empire, and that the Big Important Next Thing for them, is
something they've really already started to work on, and that's to
figure out what they're going to do about what really is the biggest
threat to the Microsoft Empire.
<p>
<i>Host:  The Internet.
</i>
<p>
<b>AW</b>:  The Internet.  Yes.  Microsoft's real hold on the
industry is really built around the notion that he who controls the
operating system--not just in the sense of owning them but also in
the sense of getting people to build tons of applications to those
standards--and that's what Microsoft's really been successful
at--really controls the computer industry.
<p>
And that's what Microsoft's been very good at.  But guess what?  When
you get out into the world of the Internet, it isn't clear that
operating systems count for very much.  If you think about what Sun
has proposed for the JAVA development environment, which suggests
that when you download an object from the Internet, it's going to
come with an executable, that places itself on your computer with all
the code for the operating system that happens to be on your
computer, to allow you to do whatever you want to do with that
object, then maybe operating systems don't matter anymore.  And,
that's a really scary thing if you're Microsoft.
<p>
<i>Host:  The thing that's worried--well, me and everyone else, about
that scenario, aside from that all of our applications that we've
been writing will have to be rewritten, is the obvious scare is:
Viruses, and those sorts of things.  Do you think that that's going
to continue to be--that there's going to be a catastrophy that wake's
everybody up and scares everybody?  Or are there going to be
solutions to that?
</i>
<p>
<b>AW</b>:  I guess there's sort of several way's of looking at this. 
First let me put on my consultant's hat, and say, that in my
experience, everybody pays an insufficient amount of attention to the
problem of viruses, just like they pay an insufficient amount
of attention to the problem of backups, until something terrible
happens to them personally, and then they're generally better
behaved about it, at least for a while.  So my guess is that, even
having something terrible happen out on the Internet to other people,
won't necessarily make each individual a well behaved person on the
subject of viruses.  It might on the other hand make some legislature
happen that would make people better protected.  That wouldn't
necessarily be a bad thing.
<p>
I think that what's really going to happen, is that as usual in the
United States, we'll look for engineered solutions, rather than
legislative ones, so our answer to this won't be to necessarily 
pass laws.  It will be for clever software engineers, and maybe even
hardware engineers, to build filters that make it relatively safe for
you to have a computer attached to the Internet.  Because if we can't
do that, then this isn't going to be really useful or fun.  And
because there are pretty decent ways of building virus filters.  The
trick is not to build one in 1995, and then assume that in 1997 or
1998 you still have a virus filter.  You have to keep updating them
because there are always bigger and better viruses coming along, and
you to improve the antibiotics to make sure they're still effective.
<p>
<i>Host:  ...[break]... I'd like to talk about the Microsoft Network,
which so far isn't really amounting to too much of an imposition on
the other networks, but I know that one of the things that they do on
the Microsoft network, or can do, that is not being done on the other
networks, is that they provider of the information, whose products
would then be downloaded by the users, can be paid each time the
product is downloaded.  It might be only a nickle or a dollar or
whatever amount the provider thinks that he can get.  This to me is a
fairly significant change, and as a provider would make me want to go
onto the Microsoft Network.  Of course, you have to have 32-bit
Windows and NT applications to get there--you know, before they'll
let you.  But, do you think that them playing this card might force
the others--AOL and CompuServe and Prodigy--to go in that same
direction, and how would that affect the Internet, where things are
basically free?
</i>
<p>
<b>AW</b>:  First of all, I think that it, certainly, was a clever
idea of Microsoft's, to make a better deal with the providers than
the online services have been offering so far.  And in fact, many of
the newer services that are coming online now, the content service
providers like IBM and AT&T, and others--the new Grotner Advantage
Service for instance--are all offering deals that are <i>much
better</i> for the provider, and much closer to the deal that
Microsoft is offering, where the provider gets to keep <i>most</i> of
the money, and the network provider takes only a very small
percentage rather than the other way around.  And that's because
they're playing catch-up.  These other guys have been in the business
a long time.  If they want good providers they have to convince them
that they'd like to try and play the game.  
<p>
Also, to tell you the truth, most of the good providers weren't real
interested in being on service where they got ten or fifteen percent
of the revenues from what they were doing.  
<p>
The Internet notion of giving things away for free, is only an
interesting idea if in the final analysis, you have a way of making
money out of the relationship you are then establishing, or out of
selling some other product to the customer you get that way.  So, it
seems to me that a lot of what's going on on the Internet today is
interesting social interaction, or marketing or pre-marketing
activity or support activity, but it isn't necessarily profit-making
business.  
<p>
And, I suspect that over some longer period of time, a few years,
we're going to start to sort that out, and was we sort that out, we
will still have lots of things on the Internet--probably the
predominance of things on the Internet will still be free, because it
will pay large companies and even smaller companies, to give away
lots of stuff in order to attract customers to see what's going on. 
but by the way, we will start having lots of things on the Internet
which are <i>not</i> free.  We will use it as a major delivery
vehicle for paid software.  Microsoft itself is already doing that,
through several distribution services.  We will see it as a major
distribution vehicle for electronic information services which are
<i>not</i> free.   Not, you know, a piece of the newspaper as an
adjunct to subscribers who are also buying paper newspapers, but
rather high-priced opinion information services like the one we
publish, being published over the Internet only to subscribers who
have passwords to get them into the service.  And, we'll also see all
kinds of new services that could not exist except in an online,
electronic, immediate access, immediate turnaround environment, come
into being.  Things that just don't have any meaning in a paper world
at all.
<p>
<i>Host:  Responsive systems, would that be--like, Ray Charles
getting information from people so they can sell them other products?
</i>
<p>
<b>AW</b>:  Well, it'll be people collecting immediate responses to
problems, and selling them to the vendor who's had the problem. 
Think about, for instance, if at the time when Intel created the
Pentium mess, it had been possible to go out in an organized way onto
the Internet, and talk to Pentium users and potential Pentium buyers
and find out exactly how they were reacting to that, and give that
information back to Intel.  They would have been able to fine-tune
their actions much better with that information.  And then think
about that multiplied by all the business decisions that companies
are making every day.
<p>
<i>Host:  So what you're talking about in the Intel Example is that
they botched the P.R.
</i>
<p>
<b>AW</b>:  They botched the P.R. very badly because they didn't
understand how angry people were.  And they didn't understand what
the real issues were, which was:  That their action was perceived as
incredible arrogance.  And, if they had been able to get feedback
directly from the customers--and direct feedback is what the Internet
is all about--then, they would never have made that mistake.  They
would have been better informed.
<p>
<i>Host:  Getting back to what Microsoft does for a living, they
recently started to purchase Intuit, then changed their mind, and I
guess their keeping hold of their Money product, if I have the
sequence right.
</i>
<p>
<b>AW</b>:  Yes. It's a really complicated situation.  First they
made this huge bid for Intuit.  They were going to kind of overpay
them for the company to make sure they got it.  And in order to make
sure that the Federal Government would let them do that, or hope that
the Federal Government would let them do that, they were going to
<i>give</i> their Money product to Novell.  They needed to find a
safe home for it.  And they'd never been really successful with it so
they were going to give it to Novell.
<p>
<i>Host:  Probably hoping that it was a box with a snake in it.
</i>
<p>
<b>AW</b>:  Sort of.  And guess what?  Novell was bundling Intuit
with it's products, so they were going to start--stop bundling Intuit
and start bundling Money with their product--it was very complicated! 
And then what happened was, it became unclear whether the Federal
Government was going to let the deal go through, and it became clear
that it was going to take a long time to get sorted out.  And
Microsoft felt that it couldn't deal with the uncertainty going on
for a long time.  And so, they walked away from the deal, is
basically what happened.  They said: "We just, we can't have this hanging over
our head.  There's too many other decisions to make.  Even though we
really want Intuit, we don't want it that badly."  And, Intuit in
some sense may be better off without Microsoft.  They're still a
highly desirable object.  Somebody else might buy them in the future. 
They make lots of money on their own in any case.  And so they went
of into the sunset and Novell's continuing to bundle Intuit in their
packages! (laughs.)
<p>
Microsoft in the meantime took Money back.  Now they have the job of
making Money look like this great product that they never intended to
give away in the first place!  That may turn out to be harder than
they think.  Especially because most of the financial intermediaries
who wanted to do deals with Intuit rather than Money would still
rather do deals with Intuit rather than Money.  And that's because
the big installed base of personal financial software users are still
Intuit users.  And so if you're a bank or a credit card company you'd
really do a deal with Intuit.
<p>
<i>Host:  Plus they 'know' Intuit's really a better
program or why would Microsoft have wanted to buy it in the first
place?
</i>
<p>
<b>AW</b>:  You know something, I don't really think that's the
issue.  I think it is a better program by the way, but, I don't think
that's issue.  I think the real issue is how many customers it has. 
Because the issue here wasn't whether it was a better program.  The
issue was, could Microsoft use Intuit to make itself a power in the
Online Financial Services market.  And it needed the installed base
of Intuit to do that.  Otherwise it was going to have a much longer
harder row to hoe to get to a leadership position in that business,
and that was really what it was trying to do.  So how good the
product was wasn't the issue, it was how big was the installed base.
<p>
<i>Host:  As always.  What are they going to do instead?
</i>
<p>
<b>AW</b>:  What are they going to do with Money?
<p>
<i>Host:  Are they going to do it with Money?
</i>
<p>
<b>AW</b>:  Well, I think they're going to spend a lot of money on
Money.  That's basically what's going to happen now.  Remember
there's this Microsoft Magic, you know.  They can bundle it with
things.  What if they decide to give it away to everyone who's an
Office Suite user?  What if they decide to have a giant giveaway
program like the one that CA had last year, where you can have it for
free?  Well, you know--they gave away over a million copies of their
Simply Money product for free.
<p>
<i>Host:  It's sitting on my shelf unopened as we speak!
</i>
<p>
<b>AW</b>:  Yes!  And it's well deserved, to be unopened (both laugh.)
<p>
<i>Host:  Okay!  You're listening to High Tech Today with my guest
today, Amy Wohl of Wohl and Associates, and we'll be right back after
this short break! ...[break]... We were talking on break about
Invisible Computing.  And, people who have been saying for many
years: "I can't understand computers.  I can't work with them.  I
don't know anything they do"--have actually been using them for quite
a while and are going to use them a lot more in the future.  Let's
talk about that a little bit.
</i>
<p>
<b>AW</b>:  Well, it's really interesting how many computers people
are probably using without even being aware of it at all.  Whenever
someone says to me: "I'll never use a computer"  I always ask them to
take their wallet out, because chances are, unless they're not a
member of modern society, they have some of those pesky ATM cards in
there.  And those ATM cards of course, every time you use them, make
you a computer user, because what you're really doing is entering
into a timeshare network and interfacing actively with the computer
through a sort of mediocre interface, and the nice thing about that
interface of course is that it offers you a reward, assuming you have
money in your account it will let you have some.  
<p>
Maybe we should have computers on your desk that give you a lollipop
or a quarter every time you hit the right key, and you'd get better
interaction with these users who say they don't want to use a
computer.  I don't know.
<p>
<i>Host:  That's what Microsoft Bob did, isn't it?
</i>
<p>
<b>AW</b>:  Well, no, actually, Microsoft Bob offered you these
scurvy little animals that insist on walking off and onto the screen
anytime you wanted to do anything.  I have really strange feelings
about Microsoft Bob.  It's one of these things where Microsoft puts
this highly flawed implementation of a really great idea because they
want to be out really early.  And then, they persistently
trouble-shoot it in full view of the known world.  And guess what: 
Over a period of say, three to five years, they'll figure out how to
do it, and they'll end up having some considerable installed base for
a user-friendly, I hate to say human-centric, animal-centric? 
Something-centric (laughs) interface.  I think they have the right
idea, they just have a terrible implementation of it.  Recently,
we've actually written a long article about that, and if any of your
users want to call me at (610) 667-4842 we'll send them a copy of the
newsletter article about that.
<p>
<i>Host:  Okay, let me give that number again.  (610) 667-4842 if you
want to get a copy of the article that Wohl and Associates, or rather
The Trends Letter--
</i>
<p>
<b>AW</b>:  It's a Trends Letter article about friendly interfaces
and particularly about Bob.  But, I think that, it's not just that we
have people using teller machines, it's that all around you, there
are computers that are much less visible than teller machines.  When
you go into the kitchen to heat a pizza in your microwave oven,
there's at least one micropocessor in that microwave oven.  When you
drive your car to the office in the morning, unless it's a very old
car, it's probably got a half a dozen or more microprocessors in it.
<p>
In fact, when I had a problem with my current car, which is a Swedish
number, the 'care manager' told me with a long, sad look on his face,
that <i>I'd</i> probably be better at fixing it than he was, because
the problem was it had <i>nothing</I> but computers inside it!
<p>
I think that we're really reaching the point where a lot of the
things we use on a daily basis are actually run by computers.  We
just are less and less aware of it, because they're not out there in
front, waving a little flag in front of you, and saying "I'm a
Windows operating system, I'm DOS, load me with your favorite
application!"  They are simply looking to you exactly the way a
microwave or whatever always looked, but guess what?  They're doing
something, better, faster, or in a more automatic way than they used
to.
<p>
<i>Host:  And they're still not communicating with each other...
</i>
<p>
<b>AW</b>:  And they're still not communicating with each other and
that's the next thing that's going to happen.  In the last year a
couple of interesting things have happened.  First we had Novell
announcing an initiative called NEST, which is an initiative to take
the Netware operating system and create a soft of lightweight version
of it that can be imbedded inside of things, for instance office
appliances, all kinds of appliances, like your washing machine and
your hot water heater and your shower--can talk to each other for
instance, and make sure that there's enough hot water for you to take
a shower before the washer goes on in a modern house.  Now that isn't
possible today, but it might be possible in a year or two.
<p>
Just recently, we had another bunch of vendors announce an initiative
to create an operating system called a microkernal--this is IBM
now--coming along, taking OS/2, and creating a version of it called
the microkernal that sits underneath a whole range of other operating
systems, not just OS/2 now, a whole bunch of operating systems
running of a whole lot of hardware platforms.  And a raft of vendors
have lined up to use this, not in their computer systems so much, but
more in the imbedded-processor products they build.  Again, the
things that hide inside of things and which will allow you to build
all kinds of connected systems to do intelligent things invisibly.
<p>
<i>Host:  So people should of course expect to see more and more
computers.  They'll be there, they just won't quite see them.
</i>
<p>
<b>AW</b>:  Right.  On the other hand, you'll be seeing lots more
computing, even if you don't see more computers, and the most visible
thing I think you will see, is the revolution that will occur right
in front of you in your living room as the race to converge the
personal computer and the television set in your living room or your
family room really surges forward in the next year or two.  We expect
to see an absolute fist-fight between the telephone companies, the
cable companies, the personal computer companies, and Hollywood as
they all try to figure out who owns that territory.
<p>
<i>Host:  Okay.  We only have about a minute left, and I really
wanted to ask about Blockbuster Video.  It would seem to me that
they're in a very precarious position.  If we can start
downloading--if we really can download our movies online, are they
going to do what the railroads did, and not realize that they were in
the transportation business, or are they going to figure it out,
close all their stores, and do online services?  You have forty
seconds to answer!
</i>
<p>
<b>AW</b>:  Well, I think that they could easily decide to sell
popcorn in the stores and go into the service business instead of
actually physically distributing tapes, and that would bail them out
handily.  We'll see if they're smart enough to do that.
<p>
<i>Host:  So they might be able to keep their shops open.
</i>
<p>
<b>AW</b>:  Yes.
<p>
<i>Host:  You've been listening to High Tech Today with your host
Russell Hoffman and my guest has been Amy Wohl, the President of Wohl
and Associates and the Editor of The Trends Letter.  She's been in
this industry for, oh, I would say longer than I have!

<p>
<i>Russell Hoffman ("Host")</i>, <i>High Tech Today</i>
<br>
<b>Dr. Robert Farran, Kodak ("RF"), Director of Strategic and Business 
Planning for the Advantix System from Kodak</b>
<hr>
<p>
<i>Host:  ...And you're listening to High Tech Today with your host,
Russell Hoffman.  Today's show is going to be talking about a
technology that in some ways has been around for many 
years--photography, but Kodak has come up with some new cameras and
new film, and they're going to be talking about it.  Now, I have a
quote here:  "Kodak built an industry by making it easy for people to
take and get good pictures."   Well, that comes from Kodak Chairman
and CEO George M. C. Fisher.  And in keeping with that policy, we
have as our guest today Dr. Robert Farran.  He's the Director of 
Strategic and Business Planning for the Advantix System which is a
division of Kodak.  It concerns new camera and new film.  First of
all, Dr. Farran, I'd like to welcome you to the show.
</i>
<p>
<b>RF</b>:  Thank you very much, Russ.  It's a pleasure to be there.
<p>
<i>Host:  And, why not tell us a little bit about the main features
of this new camera, and also--is it out yet or is it something that's
going to be released soon?
</i>
<p>
<b>RF</b>:  Okay, Russ, well, as you're listeners should know, I'm in
Las Vegas at the moment, at the Photo Marketing Association trade
show, and in Las Vegas, Kodak and many other photographic industry
members are announcing their Advanced Photo Systems products.
<p>
Kodak is announcing its Advantix products, and it's a blend of I
would say, very new high technology with our traditional technology
and as our chairman George Fisher has said on some occasions, the
first George Eastman said "You press the button, we do the rest"  and
our chairman George Fisher is very impressed with the new advanced
photo system in that it takes that concept into the 21st
Century, and that's what's going on here in Las Vegas.
<p>
The system, if I give you kind of a brief description first, and then
we can expand from there.  It's a system that blends traditional
silver halide photography with magnetics to provide cameras and
photo finishing systems that deliver three different print formats to
each consumer:  An index print, that contains basically an image on
one print that would be the 25, 15 or 40 images that the consumer
captures on the roll, and returns the negative in a cassette with the
magnetic information and the images [together] so that reordering through the
photo finishers is very easy, and convenient for the consumers,
as well as storing the images and the negatives and finding them
easily later.
<p>
<i>Host:  Now, the new film is actually very different from anything
that's been used for consumers before because it's a hybrid of a
magnetic layer that contains digital information about the film as
well as the regular 35 mm chemical emulsion type of film.
</i>
<p>
<b>RF</b>:  Yes, that's true Russ.  Within the new cassette, it
is a new format.  It's not 135 film in a magazine, as has been
traditionally the favorite format for 50 or so years, but the film
comes in a cassette, it has a magnetic layer on it, and a new film
base that's required for the stiffness and structural strength that's
required for negatives that will be returned in a cassette.  
<p>
The drop-in load feature is probably the most unique feature that the
consumer first comes in contact with.  The Kodak Advantix cameras
have a pop-open chamber.  The consumer drops the cassette into the
chamber, closes the door, and the camera will read information that
is on the cassette, in terms of the film type and the exposure
length.  Then the film is drawn into the camera by the camera
mechanism, and the camera then--particularly our upper-end camera
models that use the magnetic layer--the consumer goes through the
composition of the three different formats, which would be
essentially what we call the standard format or the classic--the 6
inch by 4 inch print that is normally gotten from 35 mm.  There's a
group size that is 4 inches by 7 inches, and then there's the other
selected mode that the consumer can pick, which is the panoramic
image, which would be a 4 inch by 12 inch print, and these are all
individually selectible by the scene, and the information as to the
print format, as I said on our upper-ended camera models would be
written right onto the magnetic layer, and on the lower-end cameras
it's written on by basically an optical encoding system that is later
read by the photofinisher.
<p>
On our upper-ended models, the date and time of image taking
is recorded magnetically on the film.  Some of the very
upper-ended camera models that we and others have, will put down what
we call a roll title on the magnetic layer as well.  So we're
recording digital information as well as optical information on the
film structure.
<p>
<i>Host:  The new film, is it--how does it compare to regular 35mm
film or to your Ektar or some of the other high-end films?
</i>
<p>
<b>RF</b>:  Okay.  Russ, in order to create very small cameras which
is one of the emphasis of the Advanced Photo System, Kodak has
entirely redesigned all their 100 speed, 200 speed, and 400 speed
films.  The cassette takes a smaller dimensional film strip and
negative.  Instead of being 35mm in width, the film is 24mm, although
we actually use about 60% of the same image size in order to create,
with the new emulsions, a very sharp color image that clearly rivals
35mm images even though the negative begins somewhat smaller than the
current 35mm negative.
<p>
<i>Host:  So would this be a low-end professional unit as well?
</i>
<p>
<b>RF</b>:  Well, it certainly could be.  Our professional folks at
Kodak, and professional photographers we have shown the images to are
very impressed with the 16 by 20 [inch] enlargements that we have created,
and I think we've gone up a little beyond the 16 by 20 as well, and
the pictures are outstanding.  For professionals, we expect that they
will see some advantages of the magnetic layer as well, in terms of
encoding certain types of information as to F-stop, light level,
shutter speed and so forth that can be recorded on the magnetic layer
according to the architecture that's involved in the digital file
system.
<p>
<i>Host:  With this new camera--Kodak is actually offering a camera,
and a film, and of course a processing system.
</i>
<p>
<b>RF</b>:  Yes, that's correct.
<p>
<i>Host:  So, you've pretty much tied everything up.  Are other
companies going to be able to release cameras that use the same film?
</i>
<p>
<b>RF</b>:  Yes.  In fact, let me make a point that I think will be
very useful for your listeners and that is, that approximately four
years ago, Kodak brought together Nikon, Canon, Minolta, and Fuji
companies to create the standard that is being announced this month,
[February, 1996] and made available. 
<p>
<i>Host:  ...[break]...We're talking to Robert Farran, of Kodak. 
He's the Director of Strategic and Business Planning for the Advantix
System which is Kodak's new camera, new film, new developing system. 
And you're in Las Vegas now--you told me 40,000 people are there and
the big interest--the big topic--is this camera, this system?
</i>
<p>
<b>RF</b>:  Yes, there's no question about that, Russ.  Historically,
the maximum number of people that have visited this particular trade
show has been about 25 to 30 thousand, and this year there's 40
thousand visitors.  It's trade representives, retail, trade, dealers
from all over the world.  I mean, truly an international set of
visitors as well as very high attendance from the United States.  And
there are probably twenty to thirty companies here that are
demonstrating, showing, and taking orders for products that relate to
the new Advanced Photo System.  There are camera manufacturers with
cameras.  Film manufacturers with film.  Photofinishing equipment
manufacturers with minilab and wholesale lab equipment, and frame and
album manufacturers and providers so that there will be products
available I would say in April [1996] is really the launch time of
all the participants in the new system, and at the end of April there
will be products all over the U.S..
<p>
<i>Host:  So, this is big--this is a big thing.  And I'm wondering,
looking towards the future, in the world of digital transmission of
images, the Internet, and so forth, which we're highly involved with
or talking about on this radio show--how does a actual 'film' camera
fit in?  What's going allow to them to survive into the 20th Century and
beyond considering all the digital options that are available.  I
guess even Kodak makes scanners, if I'm not mistaken?
</i>
<p>
<b>RF</b>:  Well, I think that's a real good question, and I'll give
you what I believe is an answer that will persist for a long
time, and that is:  The easiest and best way to capture a very
high quality image will be on silver halide film.  Today Epson
showed here in Las Vegas there are many products from Kodak and from
other manufacturers that scan and digitize the images from film or
from color print, and then right to either a photo CD or floppy disk,
or some other type of magnetic media for storage of that information
for further use, which can either be loaded into a personal computer,
sent by image transmission to someone else's computer or to a
photofinisher. 
<p>
There will be a number of pathways that will handle the
information that is initially recorded on what we call
conventional films, although I would rather refer to them today as
maybe not so conventional, because the applications of films, color
films on silver halide, are really being very bridged to digital,
either scanning and storage or transmission systems, or to printers. 
I've seen images--I'll give you just one example--the Kodak booth
includes print scanners and film scanners that put the images on
floppy disk, and the floppy disk can be placed into a computer, and
some of the current commercial inkjet color printers can provide a
very good color print.  
<p>
The images can also be merged with text files to create documents
that consumers might use for personal letters, or notes at
Christmas time, or the home office or a small office can use as part
of their communications systems.  Basically documents.  So, the
interfacing of color films and digital systems I think are going to
be a very active industry and meets an awful lot of consumer's needs.
<p>
<i>Host:  Certainly, basically what we're talking about is the
resolution of the image, and the color--bringing the color foward
that one originally sees through the viewfinder--are the advantages
of the silver halide traditional media.  When you go to digital you
usually immediately start by reducing the pixel resolution or the
color depth or something like that.  And so, you're giving us a way
to have good masters.
</i>
<p>
<b>RF</b>:  Well, that's exactly correct.  I think--it's hard to
determine a pixel equivalancy for films--but basically we would make
an estimate that a color negative has on the order of 25 to 30
million equivalent pixels.  And there really isn't any way to get that
anywhere else.  You can do pixel interpolations by some very clever
mechanisms from a low-resolution or a medium-resolution capture, but
I think, we would say, I would say, there's really nothing like film. 
And film is, continues to be very inexpensive, and there will be more
and more interface options for the consumer in interfacing film
systems with digital magnetic optical scanners, whatever.  I think it
will provide some very intriguing pathways for the consumer.
<p>
<i>Host:  Including getting the film back, through the Internet. 
Leaving it off and getting it back thorugh the Internet.
</i>
<p>
<b>RF</b>:  That's exactly right.  I mean, the consumer will be able
to, for example with the Advanced Photo System, to have an Advantix
cassette with the exposed and processed negatives in it, pop it in a
little device, with thier home computer, and send the image to
Grandma.  Send the image to a photofinishing lab and have
enlargements or postcards or whatever made, or make them at home. 
That is one pathway.  They could also have the photofinisher return a
diskette with the prints, and the negatives in the cassette, and go
that route.  So they would not have to have their own device at home
to scan either prints or scan the negative, but they could have it
done for a fairly modest price as a service, and then put that
cassette into a single disk drive and read it into their own memory
on their computer, or transmit it for additional service or send it
to a friend or whatever.  
<p>
So, there's going to be some real intriguing applications here, and I
think one of the things that I've also spoken about on occasion, is
that with the magnetic layer that is across all the film structure,
there's a fair amount of magnetic information that can be stored
there digitally.  We've done some things in the lab, where we've stored
1.44 megs of information along with the pictures on a roll of film,
and you could imagine that you could carry a digital picture along
with the silver halide picture, so that you could actually read off
an image in two different modes.
<p>
<i>Host:  ...[break]... We're talking about the new camera, the
Advantix System.  And, why not tell us a little bit about--this is
something that I think is very interesting--is that Kodak didn't just
change the film.  They're changing cameras, they're changing film,
they're changing processors.  They've had to get together with a lot
of other companies to do this.  It's really a major shift.  That's
the risky way to do things in life!  Why did you do it, and what was
it like, and what steps did you take to achieve a successful
implementation of such a radically new idea?
</i>
<p>
<b>RF</b>:  You're right, it is a risk to make very large changes as
we did, but let me give you a little bit of background, and the
background probably goes back six or seven years when, as we
generally do, we're always looking for ways to respond to the
consumer, and ways to increase the satisfaction of picture taking,
and we've spent a few years trying to find small things that we could
do within the 35mm system, and after a few years of trying to find,
again, things that would be of value to the consumer, and doable.
<p>
We elected to do two very large consumer studies.  Actually three if
you include our looking at 3,000 rolls of film of consumers to look
at what sort of problems did they have?  So we looked at consumer's
film, we talked to about 6,000 consumers person-to-person.  Now,
these were not Kodak engineers talking to consumers, they were
marketing firms, consumer research firms, so that we would not have a
bias built from our point of view.
<p>
And consumers told us a number of things.  They were looking for
better pictures, pictures the way they wanted them, some ability to
customize pictures.  They were looking for better quality.   They
were looking for a way to keep track of their prints and their
negatives, they were looking for a way to basically have some added
confidence in the photographic system.  There were a large number of
prints, there was about 3 to 5% of the negatives, that are processed
and have no images on them at all.  They come from rolls of film that
people either don't feed through the camera properly, cameras that
malfunctioon, consumers will think that a roll has been through the
camera when it's actually has never been placed into the camera, and
so forth.  As we analyzed the data with the consumer research firm,
we broke it down into basically 300 issues that consumers had with
the current 35mm photographic system.
<p>
We then put our engineers together with the consumer research firm,
and basically came to what is really the risky conclusion, as you
indicated before, and that is that there was <i>no way</i> to make
the significant improvements for the consumer that were required
without making dramatic changes to the system.
<p>
Changing the film, the whole format, changing cameras, changing
photofinishing, and we worked that on up for a period of time, and
also recognized that if we were to go and do this alone in the market
place, the consumer would not be as advantaged, nor would the industry
be as advantaged, as if we were able to work with other major players
in the industry, define a standard that could then be universal
through the industry, again for the consumer's benefit, and for the
overall benefit of the industry, rather than having an outlying
standard that would be perhaps not with full participation or support
by everyone.  And also, it's good to get everybody's good ideas!  So
as we worked with Nikon, Canon, Minolta, and Fuji to develop the key
elements of the standard, the research with consumers was key to
that.
<p>
On the way to today, we have actually delt with 22,000 consumers, and
what they tell us is, as soon as--90% of them say, as soon as there
is an opportunity for them to buy a camera, they would buy an
Advanced Photo System camera.  And in fact, the market research says
that 20% of them will actually buy a camera in the first year that
it's available!  And of all the people we spoke to, that's a
<i>huge</i> endorsement for the system's design.  And as you can
imagine, the Kodak designers of the film, and camera, and our
photofinishing solutions that we've designed, piggyback very
dramatically on this research in order to make the system very
satisfactory for the consumer from his or her point of view, but also
make it easy enough for the photofinisher to deliver the three
formats, the index print, the negative return and cartridge.  
Another element that we often overlook because it's somewhat in the
background, is that the magnetic information and the optical
information is used in the photofinishing algorithms to deliver
better pictures from the role of negatives, than the photofinisher
has been able to deliver from 135 before.
<p>
<i>Host:  I'm sorry, Dr. Farran--we're out of time on High Tech
Today... We've used up a half hour, it went by just like that--like a
snap shot.
</i>
<p>
<b>RF</b>:  It certainly did.
<p>
<i>Host:  This has been a Kodak moment!  <!-- I just had to say that! -->
I would like to suggest that everybody visit Kodak's web site at 
<a href="http://www.kodak.com">www.kodak.com</a> to get more
information about that.  I'm sorry we don't have more time to talk,
Dr. Farran, but it's been a pleasure having you on.
</i>
<p>
<b>RF</b>:  Thanks very much Russ, I enjoyed it.
<p>

<h3>NASA is planning to launch in October 1997 from the Kennedy Space Center in
Florida a space probe with 72.3 pounds of deadly plutonium aboard.  
As Dr. Helen Caldicott, founder of Physicians for Social
Responsibility, writes about plutonium in her book <i>Nuclear
Madness</i>: "It is so toxic that less than one-millionth of a gram,
an invisible particle, is a carcinogenic dose.  One pound, if
uniformly distributed, could hypothetically induce lung cancer in
every person on Earth."
<p>
Yet NASA would load 72.3 pounds of plutonium on what it calls its
Cassini mission to explore Saturn.

<h1> Space Debris Home Page</h1>
<b>Presented by<a href="/index.html"> Russell D. Hoffman.</a></B>
<p>
<b>The problem of space debris is a shameful relic of several hundred
explosions and mishaps in outer space.  Getting past it is the deadly 
gamble of every space mission.  There is no defense against it.  And 
man made nearly every bit of it in <i>less than four decades</i>.
<p>
The world needs to preserve the area of outer space known as 
NEAR EARTH ORBIT so that future space missions will be
able to leave the planet!  Already, it's so dangerous up there that
it is unreasonable to launch highly poisonous payloads due to the
risk of collision.  What can be done?  How did it happen?  Read the

<h1>Presentation to Cal-IT</h1>
<h3>London, England</h3>
<h4>October 10th, 1996</h4>
<a href="/lectures/lectures.htm"><IMG ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=20 SRC="/pics/icons/lecturer.gif" ALT=""> Upcoming Lecture Schedule </a>
<hr>
<h3>Note:</h3>
<b>
This presentation was made during a State of California-sponsored
event in which about 50 companies made presentations to a group of
investors, in London, England.  We each were given 15 minutes.  I 
have created this transcript from my original notes so some minor 
modifications from the actual presentation are possible.
</b>  
<p>  
After the speech I spoke to a number of people and was invited to
visit a local supercomputer center to see what software they might
have for me to use in my educational programs.  Also I was invited to 
submit a presentation proposal to a United Nations-sponsored
technology conference to be held in Switzerland in 1997 about
getting high-quality Internet educational material to third-world
countries.  I will know some time early next year if my proposal
will be accepted.  If so, I will then give the details of when and
where the talk will be.
<hr>
<h3>Presentation:  Writing Quality Educational Software</h3>
<p>
First, I would like to thank the State of California's CAL-IT group,
and in particular Jennifer Stanley of that office, and all of you in
the audience, for allowing me the opportunity to speak to you this
morning.
<p>
I heard recently that Tupperware is available in 87 countries.  In
only about six months, since we started tracking it, we have had 
visitors to our web site from more than 75 countries.  That
illustrates the incredible power of the web as a method of
communication.
<p>
We are the oldest company to work with America Online as a Industry
Connection Content Provider Company, and we also have a support area on
CompuServe and of course an extensive Internet web site.
<p>
Now, before I really begin I want to ask you all a question:  How
many of you know what a <i>thrust bearing</i> is?
<p>
Okay, one person out of about 150 people.  Well, what a thrust
bearing is, is, let's say you have a boat, and the propeller spins
and the blades push the water back, lots and lots of water being
pushed back, and the propeller shaft in turn is pushed forward in an
equal and opposite manner. 
Well, how do you get the force pushing the propeller shaft forward
transmitted to the rest of the boat--the infrastructure of the boat?
<p>
You don't want to put all that force into the motor which is trying
to spin the propeller.  What you use is a fascinating device called a
<i>thrust bearing</i>.  And later on in the talk I'll use this as an
example.
<p>
<h4>Right now, there is a catastrophy brewing</h4>
Kids aren't
learning.  Instead they're attacking their teachers and fellow
students with knives and guns and disrupting the class, and ruining
society.  But that's only half the problem.
<p>
Because even if they would sit still and listen, we have nothing to
teach them with!  There are very few good products on the market! 
Look at all the educational software companies that have gone out of
business or downsized.  Look at how <b>few</b> products there really
are on the market.  I'll name them:  Dinosaurs, Encyclopedias, Human
Body Tutorials, and Automotive Tutorials.  
<p>
There are five of each of these on the market, and little else
besides.  We are <b>not</b> fulfilling the promise to education and
to society that high tech companies have made for the last 20 years.  
<p>
I don't do Dinosaurs.
<p>
About two years ago, I was at a conference on educational software
put on by Microsoft up in Redmond, Washington State.  It was the "1st Annual" but there
hasn't been another one (it was designed into an already-existing bigger 
conference instead.)  Bill Gates gave the keynote, and I had the
opportunity to ask him a question.
<p>
I asked him when he thought the hardware and software O/S (operating
system) would "settle down" and stop changing every two or three
years so that we software developers could create "classic" programs:
the modern equivalent of a "GRAY'S ANATOMY".  Programs with at least
a ten year shelf life so that the developers could make money over a
long enough period of time to recoop their investment.  
<p>
He said he didn't think it was going to happen any time soon, what
with voice recognition and whatnot coming out soon.
<p>
I chose ten years when I asked him the question because at the time,
I <i>already had a product</i>--an interactive, animated software
tutorial, on the market for nearly ten years. 
<p>
Despite going from 8088's to Pentiums, from DOS to Windows, from
isolated PC's to the Internet, this product still works.  At this
time (October, 1996) it is a Pick Of The Week by an Internet software
locator service in Australia, and last month CompuServe made it a
pick of the Day and over 600 copies were downloaded in that one day. It was
favorably reviewed in 1996 by Pumps and Systems magazine.  This is a
program that has been virtually unchanged since around 1986, except
for including higher resolution versions which still use basically
the original drawings and animations.
<p>
My next major software educational program was called ALL ABOUT PUMPS
and was released last year.  ALL ABOUT PUMPS animates over 55
different pumps.  It has been very well reviewed in half a dozen
places and Cole-Parmer Instrument Company now carries it.
<p>
You could say that in terms of the amount of artwork (over 3,000
individual frames), it's the 'GRAY'S ANATOMY' of pumps.  
(Note: This is not to diminish or demean the quality of that
incredible tome in any way:  Our tutorial is for beginners 
while GRAY's was written for Doctors, and it is an awesome book.)  
But I will be distributing ALL ABOUT PUMPS, and it will be some sort 
of standard in the industry for decades to come.  
<p>
ALL ABOUT PUMPS is written in the same language that our heart
tutorial is written in:  a high-level language that could be
converted to the Internet--for a few million dollars which I'm hoping
someone will give me.  But regardless, the point is it <b>can</b> be
done.  Software can be written with a life expectancy of
<i>decades</i>, and it <b>must</b> be done if education is to survive
and grow into the next millenium.
<p>
Some professor that spent 50 years teaching some pet subject, who has
retired and wants to write a book--he needs to be convinced instead
to write an Internet application.  But with two years being a long
life in the software industry, why should he?
<p>
And so, all we have, is those four or five main topics I mentioned in
the beginning and little else besides.  But do you think that McGraw
Hill got to be McGraw Hill by selling just four different text books? 
How can we expect schools and
universities to change over to computerized distance-learning when
all they can get is four products to put on their computers?  There
needs to be an <b>investment in niche products</b>, like an animated
tutorial on <i>thrust bearings</i> or like my tutorial on pumps, and
these products need to be able to stay on the market for
<i>decades</i> if they are good enough--so that small companies, and
individual professors, can recover the enormous efforts required to
produce these products.
<p> 
Our pump tutorial, for example took at least 3000 hours to create. 
It has more animations--over 100--than those encyclopedias I
mentioned, yet it's <i>just one word</i> in the dictionary!
<p>
I dared to invest my time and effort, because I knew I could keep the
program on the market for years and years.  Animation is the
<i>best</i> use of a computer.  Our animations are accurate
educational products.  We are looking for sponsors who want to have
their names attached to quality software products with long shelf
lives.  Instead of sponsoring a race car or a T.V. sitcom, why not
sponsor a revolution in education instead?

<h2>How to Organize Your Web Site for Maximum Information Distribution</h2>
The WWW is a vast array of information, but getting at that
information is one of the most difficult aspects of the Web.  This
lecture is designed to help you learn
how to design your own web site to maximize your user's ability to
get at the information you present.  How to organize material so that
the user can find what they need.  Learn numerous tips for making
your web site <i>fast</i>.  
<hr>
<i>
Following is the original outline form for the presentation, with some modifications.  
</i>
<hr>
The WWW is a vast array of information.  We will be discussing the design goals you can consider to maximize your visitor's chances of finding everything they need at your Web site. 
<p>
This will <i>not</i> be a technical seminar.  It will not be about how to hook up a database to a Web site.  Nor will it be about how to build frames.  
<p>
This is going to be general, and philosophical, and hopefully you'll find it far more useful in the long run than technical details that won't be appropriate 5 years hence, perhaps not even five months hence.  
<p>
<ul><b>What this seminar is going to be about:</b>
<li>1) Going over what the goals of a typical Web site might be
<li>2) What kind of information you might want to place there to accomplish those goals   
<li>3) How to present that information to your visitors so that the first item--the overall goals--are achieved. 
</ul>
<ul><b>The ultimate goal of any Web site is at least one of the following:</b>
<li>1) Save your company money
    <ul>
    <li>a) Provide online and faxback services based on Web pages
    <li>b) Provide free marketing material to anyone, anywhere.  This is a <i>remarkable</i> new situation.  But what will get people to visit your site to get this free information?  INFORMATION.
        <ul>
	<li>i) Your competition will get it too--so what?  They get it anyway!  I'm sure that GM has every schematic diagram that FORD ever published and alot they <i>never</i> published as well.
        </ul>
    <li>c) Distribute all software products either as Web pages or as downloadable code
    </ul>
<li>2)  Increase company exposure
    <ul>
    <li>a) Announcements, press releases, etc.
    <li>b) Search engines have to be able to find you.  Learn how to do keywords!  Use registration tools even if you have to pay for them
    <li>c) Don't do anything sleazy.  Email users can just put you in a file of people they don't want to deal with--and computers can have <i>very</i> long memories!
    <li>d) Check often to see how one would find yourself on the Web. Fix as necessary
    </ul>
<li>3)  Increase customer satisfaction:
    <ul>
    <li>a) Provide online help including full schematic diagrams, tutorials, everything.  Toaster manufacturers should place their schematics online.  Sony should put ALL of their VCR directions online so that no matter where in the world you are, you can access the manual through the Internet.  Some day, the device will access the manual automatically that way.
    <li>b) Offer additional tools--both yours and other company's--even the competition!  If you're sure you're the best, then you can go ahead and add links to the other guys saying confidently: "Here's a product that competes with us, here's why we're better.  See for yourself."  The idea is--get information into the hands of your customers.  (But be concise.)
    <li>c) Give information about upgrades/new developments/new products
    <li>d) Give ancillary information
    </ul>
<li>4)  Make money.
    <ul>
    <li>a)  The ideal is of course to simply sell automated Web services directly.  Let's look at that for a moment:
        <ul>
        <li>i)You don't need to deal with customers directly (this is the <i>ideal</i> world we're talking about)
        <li>ii) You don't need to print anything.
        <li>iii) You don't need to ship anything.
        <li>iiii) You don't do anything but develop and electronically distribute something. 
        </ul>
    <li><b>But we can't all live in an ideal world.</b>
    <li>b)  Sell goods and services via the Web.  As yet this isn't working, because of two very good reasons:
        <ul>
		<li>i)   People like to touch things.  Imagine selling lettuce online.
		<li>ii)  People are wary of online transactions, but this will be fixed.
        </ul>
    </ul>
</ul>
<p>
The Web will be the major marketing tool of the world, surpassing everything else combined.  
<p>
Remember this mantra:  <b>"I don't know how people will make money on the Web, but I do know that some day soon people will be making vast quantities of money through the Web.  And when that happens, I know that the ones that WILL make money on the Web will be the one's with CONTENT.  And the one's with content, will be the ones who started developing it NOW."</b>
<p>
Just repeat that as needed whenever you wonder whether it's worth it to make a Web site for your company. 
<ul>
<li>1)      Content almost always means depth.  
<li>2)      You need to get your information up on the Web
<li>3)      The Web can be your #1 tool of business
<li>4)      Start doing that right away
    <ul>
    <li>a) Learn how to get your content to your customers, your future customers, and even your visitors whom you will never make a dime off of, but who you still need to please for the value of your company's good name.
    </ul>
</ul>
<ul>
<b>Information is the key.</b>
<li>1)   Not flash, not gimmicks, not sweepstakes.          
<li>2)   Not even selling things cheaper if people buy them online, which is certainly a reasonable thing to do since those sales don't cost you anything if you develop your Web site right.  
<li>3)   New paradigm in marketing.  
</ul>
<p>
<h3>EXAMPLE:</h3>
<p>
Every time I sell a pump tutorial through the Web (which isn't nearly as often as I'd like, I admit) it is a totally free sale.  If 1,000 or 100,000 files are downloaded from my site each month (actual was 30,669 last month) it doesn't matter to me one cent. If you have six good reasons to develop a Web site anyway, then marketing can be virtually free and certainly free on a per viewer basis. 
<p>
<ul><b>Note:</b>
<li>1)  Nothing works for all situations and all people.  
<li>2)  No support document and no ad material is perfect.  
    <ul>
    <li>a) The perfect sales document for one person may be a total failure for another.  I've had support documents which people have recommended changes to, which I then changed, which people then recommended I changed--to what I had before!  You really can't please everybody with one document.
    </ul>
<li>3)  Address this issue in your Web marketing program.  
    <ul>
    <li>a) You can't just aim for the lowest common denominator, since many people won't fall for that anymore.  
    <li>b) Actually you can, but the Web gives you the ability to go for the niche purchaser as well.  
    </ul>
</ul>
<p>
<h3>EXAMPLE:</h3>
<p>
Food manufacturers should put their ingredients lists not just on the side of the jar, but if they want to sell via the Web, why not put a picture of the product, and a text containing the nutritional information and ingredients?  This information would represent the company's own internal database on the information as well as serve as a marketing tool to finicky eaters like me.  
If you get a request in the mail or fax for the nutritional information, send out a copy of the appropriate Web page--this will get some of the customers to go directly to the Web next time.  And everything on the Web is basically free marketing--since the company often has to keep and present the information in some form or other anyway!
<p>
<ul>
<li>1)  It's all about INFORMATION
    <ul>
    <li>a) Since it's all about information, remember that the 'flash' currently wastes enormous amounts of user time.  
        <ul>
        <li>i) EXAMPLE Microsoft's 2-meg advertisement file demoed at a recent lecture.  Even they admit they can't really use that yet.  But they sure want to!
        <li>ii) Define your images sizes--do whatever it takes so the browser will get the text up first!
        </ul>
    <li>b)  Waiting for a download that turns out to be nothing more than a rotating animated GIF  that say's "NEW" can be pretty frustrating to your users.  So don't do it.
    </ul>
<li>2) The key to the Internet:  SYNERGY
    <ul>
    <li>a) LINK unto others as you would have them link unto you.  Links are the key to all business on the Web.
    <li>b) INTERCONNECT like thoughts throughout your own Web site.  For example if you talk about mechanical things like pitch, diameters and lengths, and you sell widgets in Metric and English measurements, you can link to a chart that converts them.  If they click on the chart you can sell a plastic version of the chart!  Link!
    <li>c) If you sell darts, be sure to comarket with a company that sells dart boards.  
    <li>d) If you sell cars, link to independent as well as dealer service stations.  
    </ul>
<li><b>Why?</b>  
    <ul>
    <li>a) The customer has to view your Web site as being THE SOURCE for honest information.  
    <li>b) You can't be THE SOURCE without providing information about things outside your company.
    </ul>
<li>	3)  Indexes, Tables of Contents, Glossaries, and Keyword Searches
</ul>
<p>
<h3>EXAMPLE #1:</h3>
<p>
Our statistics tutorial will have about 100 chapters from the original dozen in the book written by my father.  It will have a T.O.C. separating the contents into about a dozen groups much like the original book, and it will also have a T.O.C. for the 100 new chapters, it will have an Index, and a Glossary.  It will have problems and each problem will index back to the appropriate chapters, and the chapters will link to the problems.  It will allow a keyword search across the whole tutorial.  
That's five different ways students will get at the information without ever simply running through it from start to finish in an organized fashion, which will actually be the ultimate design goal of the product--to provide a complete education for those that wish to go that route.  And we haven't even mentioned the Meta Tags which will allow people to come in to the tutorial from outside, read only the page they are specifically interested in, and then leave.  
So that's about 1000 links built up within 150 web pages of information.
<p>
<h3>EXAMPLE #2:</h3>
<p>
Brownies--lowfat.  People coming in on lowfat should find your lowfat brownies and other lowfat products you make, and people coming in on brownies should find your highfat ones and your lowfat ones.
<h3>STORY:</h3>
<p>
I once designed an interactive lesson tool for college professors where every one of some 1,000 scanned pages of information could be individually accessed in exactly two mouse clicks.  This is the type of ultimate design goal.  Figure out what information each user is likely to want, and then figure out how to get it to them.
<p>
<ul>
<li>	4)  Complicated tree structures are a pain.  
    <ul>
    <li>I've seen Web sites with less than a couple of dozen pages altogether, but to get at any of the pages with any real information requires going through at least four other pages of relative junk.  This is absurd.  
    <li>In an age when it's been mathematically proven that the probability is that any one of us can contact, through friends and friends of friends alone, any other one of us in an average of less than four contacts, it is absurd that a Web site should require you to go through 4 pages to find any one of all of two dozen pages of information!  
    <li>Key pages, like the T.O.C. or the Index, should be complete and have lots of links.  Not 5 links to 5 subpages each with 3 more links it in, it should have all 15 (5X3) links right on the Index page or the T.O.C..  This is, of course, just an example.
    </ul>
<li>	5)  Save the User's Time.  It's the most valuable thing he owns.
    <ul>
    <li>It takes <b>time</b> to get additional pages, it takes <b>time</b> to click on a little box--it takes <b>time</b> to get information off the Web at all!  
    <li>Your job as a Web designer is to reduce the amount of <b>time</b> it takes for your visitors to find what they need.  Ideally, they should be able to find <i>everything</i> at your web site that is of interest to them, <i>and nothing else</i>.
    <li>Don't expect people to stay for 20 minutes, and click through 6 pages, and look at 10 useless different animated logos, just to find out that the price of your product is way out of their price range, or that your great new energy efficient electric motorcycle starter motor that the first Web page describes as "fits most models" turns out to only work with most models of Indian brand motorcycles.  
    <li>Help people to get the information they need to make an informed decision, and you not only can cover your butt from a legal point of view, you also generate warmth and good will from your visitors and customers.
    <li>Your site can become a major thoroughfare in your field of interest on the Web.
    </ul>
</ul>
<p>
<h3>Random Points:</h3>
<p>
My interview with Phil Zimmermann connects to my Jim Warren interview connects to rest of the Interviews connects to articles connects to heart tutorial connects to P11 connects to FTP--how did we get here from there?  Connections!  If I can find any friend of a friend of a friend is just about anyone at all, surely with a little creative thinking I can connect every web page at my site to every other web page at my site, or to the rest of the universe of web pages, for that matter!
<p>
Steal the job of Web Site Administrator!  Right now, your boss probably hasn't really learned the value of a web site.  So he'll hand you a job that will eventually be a department--or a division.
<p>
So before anyone's looking, take control of it.  Offer to do the work.  Learn HTML and get it going.  Then, five years from now when just about everyone is doing just about everything on the web, you'll already effectively 'own' the web and get the BIG BUCKS!  
<p>
<h3>EXAMPLE:</h3>
<p>
MAGAZINES' web sites might have:
<ul>
<li>Some articles from current issue 
<li>Some past issue's articles 
<li>Some stuff not in the magazine
<li>All archival stuff including indexing capabilities.
<li>Every advertiser that ever ran an ad gets a link if they have one, forever.  THIS CAN COST YOU NOTHING TO SET UP and really looks like a perk--and is a perk!  Your advertisers will love it!
</ul>
<p>		
Make your own web site for you personally!  You'll come to think of it as your exterior persona, your alter-ego, your super-self, but it will really just be your presentation of the important things in your life.  I hope that 50 years from now, some 58 year-olds have scanned in every school award they ever won, documented every exciting thing that's happened, linked to everything they think is interesting.  It would be supremely fascinating to be able to read 5,000,000,000 autobiographies.
<p>		
Learn HTML.  It's not hard.  Copy mine.  I copied someone else's when I started.
<p>		
No man is an island.  This is especially true on the Web.  I believe there is merit to the idea that when newspaper columnists write articles (which will in 10 or 20 or 50 years be solely published on the Web) they should be stored, linked to, etc. at the columnist's own home page, NOT at the newspaper's Web site.   Food for thought.
<p>		
Plan to keep things you put on the web.  Keeping permanent addresses is important if you want outside links to your stuff.
<p>

<hr>
<h3>Notes:</h3>
The lecture didn't go exactly as planned.  Unfortunately by a sad
quirk of fate, someone (not Messr. Gates) from 
Microsoft was scheduled to speak before me (we each were to have 45
minutes).  They started about 8 minutes late, and spoke for <b>over an
hour</b>, so when I got up I was <b>a.)</b> rushed and <b>b.)</b> mad.  It wasn't my
best lecture.  (I <i>was</i> asked if I would be willing to come back
again and talk to some of the Internet SIG's, so I guess it couldn't
have been <i>that</i> bad!)
<p>
<b>
OCIPUG actually managed to squeeze in more time
before the next speaker, shortening the break, and was able to give
me the full 45 minutes.  They were gracious and a great group and I
thank them very much for the opportunity to speak to them.</b>  
<p>
I couldn't help but laugh at Microsoft's silliness. 
The guy started with a quote circa 1995 from Bill Gates about how the Internet
is the most important thing to happen since the introduction of the
IBM-PC in 1981.
<p>
Then he demoed some rushed out Web authoring products from Microwsoft, and
was telling us we were gonna 'love' this feature, and 'love' that
feature, until I for one was about ready to throw up.  For example,
one feature we were all supposed to love was horizontally scrolling
banner text in a web page.  <b>WOW!</b>  And it wasn't even smooth scrolling like
the stuff I've been writing in Multimedia DOS for almost <b>15 years</b>! 
It was jerky and it was just silly.  If you think that's going to make
your web page jump out at people you're right--it'll jump out and
scream "I bought a dumb utility from Mycroesoft and I know
how to use it!"	  What it won't scream is "I'm a quality product
written by someone who cares".  
<p>	        
Another Mighcrosoft claim was that they spend enormous amounts of money
on R&D.  I didn't mention it at the lecture, but I don't think their
numbers were presented fairly.  I think they include working on 
the next version of Windoze as R&D.  (Or in other words, bug-fixing the
current version.)  And anyway, it was presented as a gross dollar
figure, when it should have been presented as a percentage of net
income if it's something they want boast about and act proud about.
<p>	        
Perhaps most significant was that their Web demo used a 370K Powerpoint
thingy (Look--it's less than 400K!) and a 2 Megabyte (!) AVI file
(running, surprise surprise, a Mikrosoft ad).  Naturally, <b>it didn't
actually go out on the Web and get this stuff</b>.  And naturally, it was
running on one of the fastest machines available today--a 133 Mhz
Compaq with 40 megs of RAM and a 1.1 gig H.D..
<p>
So by the time I went on, I could barely contain myself!  The last 15
minutes of the guy's talk, the Chairpeople at OCIPUG were clearly
agitated and furtively looking at their watches.  I was modifying my
speech.  
<p>
Microsopht just really ticked me off...  I guess I'm easily ticked
off by them these days, what with how hard they've made it for honest
hard working DOS educational programmers who helped them build their
empire during the last decade.  I admit it: I'm a bitter old man (40) 
about this.  (See my <a href="/ftp/p11_ftps.htm">FTP page</a> for 
more information on why I'm upset.)  
<p>
When I finally got to speak, first I looked at my watch (which, by an
amazing coincidence, had been given to me at a Microssoft conference a
few years ago, where Billy G. said some pretty silly things himself).
<p>
The guy from Mycrosoft was packing to go, which was also, if you ask
me, pretty rude.  That didn't calm me down.  I'm sure he heard enough
that I won't be invited to tea at his house any time soon, though.
<p>
I started out with "I'm supposed to speak for 45 minutes and end at 
10:35, but that's just 20 minutes from now, so I guess I've been 
stepped on by Microsoft.  Well that's O.K.: I'm used to it."
<p>
Then I mentioned the quote from Mr. Gates that they had started with, 
and said that I had 
a sort of similar quote I was going to start with, which I wrote, but
which really went <b>quite a bit further</b>. It which went something like: 
"The Internet represents the greatest opportunity in the history of
mankind to increase the overall level of intelligence in the Universe."
<p>
Then I said I should start with a Bill Gates quote as well, so here's
mine, which he said sometime around 1983 or 1984: "I don't know why
anyone would ever need more than 640K".  I was loaded for bear.  I
offered them three minutes at the end to rebut anything I said but
they didn't take me up on it (some Microsoft people stayed through,
but the speaker packed up and left.)
<p>
And it didn't get any better the rest of the lecture.  Following are
the notes I wrote preceding the lecture and which I sent to the
Program Chairperson, but the actual lecture was more about my
opinions on encryption, junk email, data streams, background images,
censorship, etc..  And my opinion of Microsoft, which just seems to
keep getting worse.  
<p>
One idea which I sugggested, was that
everyone's home page (which everyone should have) should include
their complete medical history--but in an encrypted form.  And
only two people should be able to see the data (besides you)--your doctor, 
and the Census Bureau.  Yes, the Census Bureau.  Did you know that
by law, the data the Census Bureau collects may be given to <b>NO ONE</b>
except in statistical form?  Not even the IRS can get at it.
<p>
By allowing the Census Bureau to have
access to everyone's medical records, an enormous amount of
information could be gained on which environmental pollutants do the
most damage, and how much damage they do, and so on.  Also, simple, short
questionaires could be tied to the data and the effects of healthy
and not-so-healthy lifestyles could be more easily determined.  All
with complete privacy.  In an ideal world...

<h3>Proposal for presentation to OCIPUG:</h3>
To:  Alan Liebschutz, 
<br>
Program Chairman,
<br>
Orange Coast User Group
<br>
June 14th, 1996
<br>
<p>
Dear Sir:
<p>
Jerry Man has asked me to fax this outline of my talk scheduled for 8/24/96.
<p>
Basically, the talk will focus on the Internet and what it will do to the way America does business, entertains itself, and learns.  I guess about half the time will be spent discussing where it's at now, and half, where it might be going.  Maybe a few minutes on where it came from and why it exploded now instead of five years ago or five years hence.
<p>
In business, the Internet represents a remarkable opportunity for both customer support and sales.  OSHA, for example, has placed millions of pages of information online, including their complete Inspector manuals, so that businesses which need to know what the Inspectors will be looking for can find out exactly.  Here is San Diego there is a firm that will place restaurant's menus online for free.  Shop manuals will more and more go online and this will make support easier and easier for businesses.
<p>
In entertainment, many movies now come out with web sites already set up.  These become instant "fan clubs" as do musician's home pages.  Increasingly, the Internet represents a global communication device and a global community of individuals.
<p>
Only six months ago we could regularly read letters about the Internet being good for nothing more than porn and sales literature.  Yet now, it is THE PLACE to go for real, solid information on a huge number of things.  For example, if I go out of town, the Internet is the best place to look for mountain bike riding areas near where I'm going.  In fact, it's about the only way to get that information, unless I want to stop in a bike shop when I get there.  
<p>
It is really remarkable that this should have happened so quickly and so thoroughly.  It's great!
<p>
As for learning, the Internet already has hundreds of sites built by museums all over the world, which display digitized views of their collections.  Magazines and newspapers are placing not just their entire printed output, but far more on the Internet.  Full text of interviews, background information, audio clips and so on.  Again, this is a wonderful explosion of  information,  and it is unprecedented in history.
<p>
All these things are happening right now, and will continue to happen at an ever-increasing rate.  Currently, the main downside to the Internet is the speed of the connections, which may well get worse.  A second downside is the unreliability of much of today's hardware and software-like 'plug and pray'.  If software companies do not try harder to write reliable software, this beautiful world may come crashing down like a house of cards on fire.  The Internet is still too vulnerable to hackers.
<p>
The future promises to be very exciting.  As more and more businesses place more and more information online, the need to be hooked in will become overwhelming.  We should even expect, and encourage, laws requiring information to be distributed through the net.  For example, all automotive companies should be required to place their entire shop manuals online so you don't need to buy them anymore, and so any backwoods mechanic can get the information they need to properly repair any vehicle.
<p>
Postal junk mail needs to disappear-it's a waste of trees-but it cannot simply be replaced by junk email.  It is mathematically impossible, that's why the online community hates 'spam'.  Because a simple calculation says that if you can send junk email to 500,000 people virtually for free and without repercussion, then everyone who wants to announce anything will do so-and we can expect our private email boxes to fill with thousands of junk email pieces every day.  
This is another area I expect legislation to eventually have to be enacted, much though I hate the idea of legislating the net.
<p>
As for freedom of speech issues, first amendment stuff, the Internet represents, in some way or other, everything that is going on in life.   So any store that is legal on earth should be legal in Virtual-earth.  However, differing standards around the world mean that something that is legal in one place may be totally forbidden-by community standards, not dictators-elsewhere.  Yet, to some extent the Internet must allow the most freedom possible, rather than the least freedom possible.  
<p>
This is because people will not, should not, and never have put up with others imposing their rules.
<p>
Internationally, the Internet is the most dangerous weapon ever devised to destroy dictatorships and fascist regimes.  It is the most democratic, egalitarian tool that humanity has ever come up with, and it will NOT go away.  It will mutate.  It will grow.  Only a massive collective mental illness could possible destroy it completely.  Mankind needs this tool very badly, and it has come along not a moment too soon.
<p>
People who reject the Internet as fluff, people who haven't ever tried it, people who don't 'trust' it--it's like not trusting books (any books), or not believing that libraries had value once, or like thinking tomatoes are poisonous or that astrology works.  
<p>
Sure, there will always be sad cases of misinformed people who think these things, but the vast majority of people will, and a large minority do now, recognize that the Internet is the most wonderful thing that has ever happened to mankind, and that this is the most exciting time to be alive in the history of the world, and that this is also the most exciting time to be involved with information technology.
<p>
Lastly, I will certainly mention that the great flux that is going on means that there are business opportunities that people haven't even dreamed of, and in the next ten years we should expect an average of one new billion-dollar Internet company every year, if not more frequently.
<p>
I look forward to the meeting.  Please let me know if this is along the lines of what you are expecting me to talk about.  Thank you, again, for your invitation.

Okay, have it you're way... Here it is...
</H4>
<p>
Sometimes it happens to me that people ask me how to succeed at
writing educational software for a living.  I tell them I don't
really know, but for starters, they might consider carefully
studying everything I've done, <i>and then be sure not to do any of it!</i>  In
that jockular jugular, if you ever stumble into a chance
to get a job at Microsoft, this is <i>not</i> the best way to open the
door with them!  Learn from my experience: Don't do this...
<p>
<p>
About a month ago, someone from Microsoft called me and asked if I
knew of <i>anyone</i> in the San Diego area who might be able to head
up a company to work with Microsoft (semi-autonomously, I guess) to
establish a local entertainment and information guide.  She said they
plan to do this in several dozen cities with different companies.
<p>
Naturally I told her yes, absolutely, I knew the perfect person for
such a job--Me!
<p>
I explained why I thought I was perfectly qualified and offered to
send in a brief Bio of myself and my company, which I faxed within
the hour.  Next morning I called her and they had just had an
earthquake--in Seattle!  And me, not knowing about it, almost made a
bad joke when she told me she hadn't been able to look at my web site
or anything.  She promised me she'd check it all out soon.
<p>
That was a Friday.  The next Monday,  I faxed the following followup
letter to her.  That was over two weeks ago now, so I guess I didn't
get the job since I haven't heard from her.  Not wanting to waste all
that effort writing this stuff, I'm putting it on the Web for anyone
who's interested.  You be the judge:  Should they have hired this loose cannon?

<p>
FAX TO:   L.... D....,  MICROSOFT CORP.
<br>
VOICE #:(206) 703-....    FAX #:(206) 703-....
<br>
May 6th, 1996
<br>
Dear Ms D....;
<br>
<p>
I have been considering what it would take to establish a useful presence in the manner you described to me over the phone during our initial meeting, and I've had a couple of thoughts about what you might be looking for.  
<p>
First of all, you need a company headed by someone who has a basic knowledge of the Internet from a technical point of view.  They need to be able to design easy-to-use, informative guides and centralized information stations.  
<p>
But beyond some technical knowledge, the person needs access to other, more technical (and maybe more talented) people, since the GM/Publisher couldn't possibly be an expert in everything, and certainly would not be likely to spend a lot of time writing code.
<p>
However, all the technical stuff aside, a more important thing is the quality of the product that goes out to the "customer."  Personally, I believe that is largely a product of timing.   It is a matter of using the tools available to produce good interaction with the user.  For example, we software-side companies have always had to "fight"  the hardware for every byte.  For example, I develop educational animation.  
It is smooth only because of careful use of string move instructions in Assembler language.  I used these cumbersome techniques because I had to, to get smooth animation.  
<p>
I know how to get speed from a machine if I demand it.  This, of course, probably won't do me any good working on the Internet, except for one thing:   I learned about the problems of timing.  Back then, I would preread animations, I would display all the text before any of the pictures, etc.  And of course, many of these things are still vital, because, although the machines became literally 100 times faster than those 8088's, the size of the images got proportionately bigger as well!
<p>
Even today, my educational software programs run fast, smooth, and are remarkably reliable.  That is largely a matter of using the tools properly, and that is no different on the Web.
<p>
I have been a PC software programmer since the original 8088's (I started programming on DOS at version 2.1, for anyone at Microsoft who remembers that far back.)   So I am familiar, though I don't program in, Windows 3.1 and WIN 95, and I probably know DOS from an applications point of view, better than all but a handful of people.  I know, for example, that DOS is capable of multimedia.  <i>(The beauty of DOS is that it can be ignored.--Ed.)</i>
<p>
The point is, starting on those 8088 IBM PC Jr's and 4 Mhz PC's and 8 Mhz XT's, I had to wring the maximum capability out of the environment to present a good product.  Brute force alone won't work, you had to have a certain amount of finesse.  Actually, on the 8088's you had to have a lot of finesse (if such a thing is possible) because all the brute force in the world wouldn't really give you good performance on that slow little CPU. 
<p>
I realize that you do not want to get 20, or 10 or whatever cities all doing the same basic thing-the so-called "Microsoft Local".  Oh sure, that would be great if you could do it-you'd save a ton of money.  But the very idea of doing a local guide and information center at a national level strikes me as downright comical.  
<p>
You want a Microsoft local, tailored to interact with other local groups and to Microsoft's corporate needs.   But you want it locally flavored, and locally designed.  Then in a year or two, you'll be looking at each city and figuring out who's succeeding and try to analyze (a fancy word for guess) why.
<p>
Right now, neither you, nor I, nor anyone else actually knows what will work-even the successes, which there have been on the Internet, may have worked for complex and obscure reasons--in other words, the same idea may not be the best solution everywhere, and it may not even work anywhere else at all! 
<p>
This means you undoubtedly are looking for lots of local initiative, so that you can try lots of different solutions all at once.  And you probably also would like this to happen as quickly as possible.  Time lost is not recoverable, especially when you lose percentages or gain competitors.  In addition, why be second when you can be first?  Here in San Diego, I'm not sure anyone would ever call you first, but I'm sure you can still be best if you try...
<p>
In any event, time really is of the essence.  Various cities will be given a chance to have special promotions due to events that just happen to occur for them.  Atlanta has the, um, what-zit.  San Diego has the Republican convention, with 4,000 delegates and 10,000 press.  Those press can't all interview delegates all the time, can they?  Then the delegates would never get anything done!   (Some say that's pretty inevitable, anyway...)  
I say, let those hapless denizens of the press interview our programmers, our writers, and our staff who are working 24 hours a day (12 hour shifts) to output the necessary changing information-like what hotels still have rooms in a 50 mile radius of the city, and who's serving good food at 3:00 am.
<p>
San Diego's local online service needs to work this angle.  Press about it would be national, which would benefit every other city where you have Microsoft Internet Local Support.  By the way, I told you that we had had the Super Bowl recently, but I'm wrong.  We're scheduled to get it in 1998, so that's the next Really Big Thing that's going to happen in San Diego, and that's a way's off.   We're not New York or Los Angeles.  We don't get Really Big Things all that often.  
So we have to make hay while the sun is shining.  (Actually San Diego gets a lot of sun.)
<p>
In August of this year there's the California Computer Expo (CCE), which I believe is the most attended computer expo for the pubic in California with over 30,000 expected this year.  I've had a booth at all previous shows and will lecture about the web at this one.  Microsoft always has a nice booth there.  (My booth was right next to them two years ago.)  The local Microsoft Internet company should start planning right away-talking to the CCE and to the Microsoft group that plans to be there.  
CCE is good for some local press, but nothing like a national political convention.
<p>
I wanted to be sure to mention some of the things I think are more important than technical wizardry.  First of all, there's editing and writing.  A list of which restaurants serve bok-choy within a 10 block radius of your present location would be nice, but a review of how good the bok-choy there is, would make it ideal.  The Microsoft local company would need to hire reviewers, investigators, and lots and lots of information collectors.  
This would help set you apart from being 'just' a warehouse of information.
<p>
Any idea for an informative guide won't work without the help of local businesses, particularly small businesses.  The small businesses need to be convinced that they want to update their information at the Microsoft Local web site regularly.  They must keep updating the information and be sure it's current.  
<p>
The local Microsoft company should never type or scan in a restaurant's menu, but the restaurateur should be convinced that that is a worthwhile thing for them to do, with prices, and of course with their hours as well.  A nice color picture of the joint and the chief cook and bottle washer.  Can the yellow pages offer that?  Of course not-then we wouldn't call it the yellow pages, would we?
<p>
Some bars-excuse me, nightclubs-will want live video feeds, I guarantee it.  Feeds coming in and feeds going out.  For one thing, the Web is generally free--they pay high rental charges for some things right now.  But a good webmaster can link all kinds of interesting things.  From dance clubs around the country linked with video images, to a good web surfer simply doing his thing in front of a live audience.  Video game halls need these things.  
For example the best people at twenty video game centers around the country are playing each other in some sort of competition, then the running scores will likely be transmitted via the Internet.
<p>
Sports centers would use the Internet for up-to-the-minute scores and live images.   With Microsoft in the backbone, surely something like that can be offered!   These information center types of things will draw in customers to the business.  Local box scores for Little League teams in San Diego.  I think Microsoft needs to make sure things like these are easy for the local Internet companies to offer to the local businesses.  JAVA, SHOCKWAVE, whatever it takes.  Write our own code if we have to, of course...
<p>
Another area that should not be forgotten is the ability of such a service to provide for urgent information.  For example, some of the local hospitals offer information read-back services by phone now ("Press 457 for information on Sleeping Sickness, press 458 for information about Snakebites, Press 459...")  Perhaps they can be convinced (it shouldn't be too difficult) to put that sort of information on the web, conveniently linked to the Microsoft Local information center.  
Stored at the Microsoft Local Internet Center equipment, if that's what fit's into your business plan.
<p>
Users should log into the system (or come in as anonymous, of course) so that they can personalize the displays for their needs.  For example, vegetarians should only have to tell the system once that they don't eat their friends, and from then on from login to login, no matter where they login from, it knows not to suggest a place for eating ribs.  
<p>
At least here in San Diego, if not elsewhere, I think a lot of companies, organizations, recreation centers, whatever, really are learning to use the web for "real work."  Everyone here is investigating it.  Companies recognize that it is a powerful communication media for advertising, and for support.  Savvy media companies know that the web will only grow, and that even at this infant state, it is a very useful tool.  
Convincing them of this, at least convincing San Diego companies, has largely been done already.  
<p>
It's just a matter of helping them figure out what they need to do to fit into a grid of information.  Why should a local movie theater care to be on the Web at all, or care to maintain the information in a timely manner?  
But if they all did it, and the information was aggregated and displayed in a useful manner, and if computer savvy citizens were online basically 24 hours a day (which is certainly the goal in life) then no one would bother calling the theater anymore, or even checking the local paper.  
<p>
But if the information isn't concise, which would require some level of cooperation among all the theaters in this example, then the whole project is, at least in part, a failure.  So we would need to get the information!  If only 40% of the theaters participate, that is not 4/10th's as good as if 100% participate.  It's more like a hundred times worse than if 99% participate, and infinitely worse than if 100% participate.  
There has to be cooperation, because if the user has to click on each theater to figure out who's playing something they want to see, they will go scan the paper.  It's faster.  But if the IP gives them a localized map and lists the theaters nearest them according to start times, they can actually save time and it becomes more convenient.  That requires close to 100% participation.  
At 40%, just about everyone will go scan the page in the local paper instead, which we all know has virtually 100% participation right now.
<p>
You and I can probably think a zillion reasons why the web solution is better, but our reasons may be things the theater owner never thought about.  They look at web support as an extra expense: "I have to do newspapers and a phone message system anyway.  Why should I do the net as well, that's just extra work."
<p>
A couple of good reasons are saving time and money.  By starting with the information in Web-compatible form, the theater owner can output it to a high quality laser printer for creation of the daily advertisements.  The newspaper could download them automatically.  Voice response systems could take the web information and enunciate it over the phone.  
So now, instead of supporting three different media-phones, newsprint, and the web, they really only support one new media-the web-and the others are supported practically automatically. Not bad for a system that is virtually free!  This kind of logic needs to be explained again and again, in a hundred different business scenarios across the country.  
<p>
Perhaps Microsoft should have a newsletter that goes between the local internet companies, that offers suggestions for breaking down those kinds of barriers.
<p>
I have a saying.  It goes like this:  "I don't know how people are going to make money on the web, but I do know this:  Soon, regular people will be able to make money on the web.  And when that happens, the one's who actually will make money on the web will be the ones with content.  And the ones with content will be the ones who recognized early on that they had to start creating the content now."
<p>
In keeping with the idea that you are looking for local talent, I have considered a short list of the first ten or twelve people I would call upon for help if you gave me a chance to head up the team here.  I'm sure they will have a lot of suggestions as well.  
<p>
Thank you, again, for the chance to present myself concerning this project.  Please be sure to check out the articles at my web site about the web.  We both know that right now is the time to act on the web.  My particular sense of urgency is due to the peculiar fact that the Convention is just around the corner in this town, and the California Computer Expo is the same month.  
<p>
Any company would want to jump on these opportunities with both feet because opportunity knocks when <i>it</i> feels like it, not when <i>you</i> feel like it, and you just have to react.   I'm just suggesting you push "San Diego" forward in the pack so whoever gets the job here, gets a chance to capitalize on these important upcoming events.  I hope it's me, of course...
<p>
Please do not hesitate to contact me if there is anything further you would like me to consider about this matter, or about anything else, for that matter!  It has been a pleasure  thinking about the possibilities such an arrangement can offer.

<i> By Russell Hoffman </i>
<p>
The World Wide Web is wonderful.  However, most people can see areas where improvements can be made.  Here are some things I wish for.  
<p>
<a name="web_wish_list">
<ul><b>WEB WISH LIST</b>
</a>
<li> <a href="#better_memory">Better Memory</a>
<li> <a href="#better_storage">Better Storage of Favorite Places</a>
<li> <a href="#better_palettes">Better Palettes </a>

<a name="better_memory">
<h4> Better Remembering </h4>
</a>
<p>
It is unfortunate that browsers don't normally maintain a "played" list from 
session to session.
<p>
<a href="#web_wish_list">Back to list.</a>
<p>
<a name="better_storage">
<h4> Better Storage of Favorite Places </h4>
</a>
<p>
Your "Favorite Places" list should store not just URL's but the entire page
if you like. It could update it but still SAVE THE LINK STATUS'S of
the links on the page.
<p>
<h4> Automatically refresh your Favorite Places links </h4>
Your browser should let you know if a linked page has been updated since
your most recent visit.  It could do this by accessing all it's links occassionally (lets call it
<i>exercising it's links</i>). Probably it should do this an hour or so
after you log off and then every 24 hours or 7 days or whatever, but 
it should do it while you yourself are not online.  (The assumptions 
are that shortly after you've logged off is the least likely time for
you to log on again, and that you have a separate phone line...)
<p>
<a href="#web_wish_list">Back to list.</a>
<p>
<a name="better_palettes">
<h4> Better Palettes </h4>
</a>
<p>
Nothing ruins good art more than bad color representation.  It always amazes
me when I look down the line of T.V.'s at the electronics stores, how
different the colors are from one television set to another.  The problem 
is even worse when using the WEB.  The only reasonable choice is to
<i>standardize</i> immediately on a 256-color palette and begin to expect 
24 bit or 32 or maybe 36-bit color <b>soon</b>.
<p>
Also, with a full standard palette jaggies could be eliminated more easily. 
<p>
<a href="#web_wish_list">Back to list.</a>
<p>
<a name="better_animation">
<h4> Better Animation Capabilities </h4>
</a>
<p>
Timing is everything, but of course the Web has no timing controls at all.
<p>
<a href="#web_wish_list">Back to list.</a>
<p>
<a name="preread_items">
<h4> Preferred Item Preread Capabilities </h4>
</a>
<p>
Timing <i>is</i> everything, and if the Web page author could
specify the next-most-likely page to be used next by most viewers, the
browser could download it while you look at the one it just got! 
This would be nice because the <i>apparent</i> speed of the web would
increase dramatically while increasing raw "net" usage probably less
than 20%.  I bet most webmasters could guess to a high degree of 
accuracy which page will be most likely to be read after some 
particular other page is read.  Besides, the webmaster could even list 
the pages in decreasing order of likeliness, and the browser could load 
more than one at a time, if it has time.  Heck, it could load the first 
part of the six most likely next pages!  We <i>do</i> tend to follow
like sheep, you know...  This would be useful for allowing the web
author to "stream" several HTML files in a line for quicker access to
each one in succession.  
<p>
<a href="#web_wish_list">Back to list.</a>
<p>
<a name="real_bkgrnds">
<h4> Real backgrounds for text </h4>
</a>
<p>
This is asking a lot.  I know, because I had the pleasure of trying
to program it on 8088's and decided that good control of the
background and foreground colors was more important.  Fancy
backgrounds really just get in the way and I, for one, like to turn
them off in my browser when I'm surfing the web.  In fact, I only
leave them on sometimes to see what people are doing with them.  And
what they are doing is, making it very difficult to read the text.
<p>
That's the first problem with backgrounds.  
<p>
The second problem is, of
course, that they don't come on right away.  They don't even come on
first, which seems logical if they are going to exist at all.  Of
course there's a reason they don't come on first:  They
take a long time to download and the user (that's you) wants to start reading the
text right away (of course.)  So that's the second problem.
<p>
And the third problem is that they scroll with the text.  The text
should actually scroll over a <i>stationary</i> background!  Or an
animated one if you like, like credits in a movie!  The junk that
jerks all over the screen we see nowadays is pretty bad.
<p>
Beautiful software is beautiful in the details, and flashing screens
are ugly.  Browsers that redraw the background frequently and without
cause are cause for concern.
<p>
Of course, I know how difficult what I'm asking for is.  
Things like this <i>have to</i> be implemented in
hardware--and they're not!  This is the opinion of someone with
nearly <b>15 years</b> of computer animation experience on IBM-PC's and
compatibles, in Assembler language.  Trust me--this stuff has to be
done at the hardware level.  Basic textual screen control needs to be
implemented at the hardware level!  A web site should generally have
<i>one</i> background that it uses on multiple pages, but if it has
more than one, the browser should store all of them.  And that
background should be a stationary image over which text can be
scrolled at the pixel level totally <i>without flicker</i>.  I wonder
when we'll see this?

<p>
First in a series by Russell D. Hoffman.  Copyright (c) 1996.
<p>
I ramble for about 600 words in the beginning of this article, so if you like, you
can <a href="#philoweb">Cut to the Chase</a>.
<a name="philoweb"></a>
<hr>
<p>
For new programmers starting out in the field, a bank is a great
place to land your first job.  It's the kind of place where you definitely 
learn to <i>test</i>.  If your calculations round incorrectly by a 
tenth of a cent in the wrong direction,
how many millions of dollars will the bank give to it's customers, 
or perhaps worse, steal from them, over the period of time from when 
the mistake is first coded and implemented to
when the mistake is found (hopefully soon, and by the accounting department) 
or the software is replaced by all new code?
<p>
How many times
will they put up with running 30,000 month-end statements with the
date in DD/MM/YY order (in the U.S., it's strictly MM/DD/YY as we all
know)?  I don't know, but I do know this:  At least they'll 
let you get away with it <i>once</i>.  
<p>
I had left work at 3:00 a.m. the day before, but
I guess I should have run <i>one more test</i>...  Then I had an <b>accident</b> on 
the way to work the next morning, about five hours later.  Put a big
dent in my otherwise spotless Datsun 280-Z.  (But that's another
story--and a good one!)<!-- I had to accelerate into a truck to avoid going under it instead. Pretty exciting.  -->
<p>
I get to work, and find out that the stuff I worked so hard to get
out--is currently being shredded and headed for the Dempster
Dumpster.  I also learn that I still have a job.  So, it was a good
day.  Like a pilot's creed "Any landing you walk away from is a good landing"
any day you still have your job at the end of, is probably a good day.
<p>
You also learn to maintain
other people's code when you work at a bank, which is an <i>awful</i> job. 
Almost as bad as working on your own code!  In a multi-billion dollar
bank run by about 9 Systems Analysts and 9 Programmers and two
managers, you do some of just about everything.  I've programmed bank
merger reports, ATM extract files, monthly, debit, IRA, CD, savings,
checking, you-name-it bank statements by the dozen... 
<p>
Most of the folks in the MIS department of the bank were retired military programmers, 
who had used Univacs (90/60 and 90/80 MVS models) and even older stuff 
in the Army or the Marines or something.  You couldn't learn from a
better group of people.  And those old Univacs were good machines. 
Good scrap iron now, of course.
<p>
One day, when I was a rookie programmer, around 1980, I was chided 
by one of my learned teachers of programming who was guiding and 
directing me.  He was a Systems Analyst at the bank where I was a "Junior
Programmer".  
<p>
The day before, the Systems Analyst had asked me how some piece 
of code that I proposed was going to work.  
<p>
I told him what the philosophy of the subroutine was.  The
details of what counters represented what real values, and what error
processing I had devised, and so forth.  He said okay and I went off
and programmed it.  
<p>
The next day, I was at his desk to discuss the next phase of whatever
it was we were working on.  I asked my question, and he just looked at 
me quizzically, raised one eyebrow, and said <b>"Philosophy of a Subroutine?!?"</b>
<p>
<a name="philoweb"></a>
<h3>Here is the philosophy of a web site (Part 1)...</h3>
<p>
A web site can serve many functions, but the <i>primary</i> function of a
web site <i>must</i> be defined.  What do you want to achieve with
the site?  Common functions include sales, support,
advertising, generating interest in a company, a product, or a service,
or simply:  <b>Maintaining a presence so that when your potential
customers search the web, they don't just find your competitors.
They'll find you too.</b>
<p>
This reason should be analyzed, because if many companies get on board
just to keep up with their competitors, it follows like sweat follows
work that the first thing they'll do is look at their competitors 
sites, so they can try to build a better one--but not much better. 
Why waste effort?
<p>
Also, if you want to be found by your customers when they go to the
web, then using proper KEYWORDS is your tool.  It's too big a topic
to include here but a later article will discuss keywords extensively.
<p>
If you are just starting out building your own web site, and you are 
trying to figure out what you need the web for, there's a simple
plan: just try to match your major competitors, and hope they don't
decide to upgrade their sites (and spend a lot of money, causing you
to have to spend a lot of money just to stay competitive.)
<p>
But if you really want to build a site, you need to
decide--philosophically--what you want to achieve from your web site.
<p>
First of all, you want everyone who visits your web site to find
everything there that might be of interest to them, to find little
else besides, and to want to return when they think you might have
posted new stuff that they will enjoy.  Also, you want to try to
know, and even control, where people go when they exit your site 
 so that you can get those sites they go to, to consider linking back to you!
<p>
If you use it for support, the most important consideration is simply
this:  can you provide better support by directing people to your web
site, or can you cut down on your total costs for support by
including support via a web site?  It's a cold hard decision.  But be
careful!  I think most people right now, mid 1996, don't see all the
benefits that web support can be a part of.  For example, your
faxback system can be a subset of your web support system.  Even the 
printed material that you still send out can be copied directly off the
web if you do it right.  That way, you also entice people to come to
your web site just by association, or rather, by design.
<p>
<h3>Your web site can be your #1 support tool</h3>
Consider your web site to be your major support tool.  It should
be used freely by your customers, your staff, and your trainees. 
Knowledge is power, and the more information you provide, the more
powerful your customers and your employees are.
<p>
Giving away information for free on the Internet is not selling knowledge short! 
Generally the accumulator and presentor of that so-called 'free' information
wields a very powerful sword.  
<p>
If your competition presents 'scientifically
proven data' online showing why their product is better than yours, you
better be ready to counter that with some of your own 'scientifically proven
data'.  If they are able to respond to customer inquiries
online in a manner that the customer feels comfortable with, you better
be able to do that too.  
<p>
<h3>Publish technical data on the Web</h3>
I think all automobile
manufacturers should be <i>required by law</i> to place all their
shop manuals online for free access by their customers.  And not just
automobile manufacturers, but also toaster ovens, refrigerators, any
product where you would be expected, or required, to provide
schematics and shop references.  At the very least you should be 
allowed to fulfill any requirement to publish technical data for
your product by publishing it (and leaving it up) on the Web.  
<p>
VCR's shouldn't bother to come with a
manual you can't read anyway!  Put it on the web and make it
readable!  Better yet:  Let you use the web to control the VCR at it's
very own URL address.  Every VCR should have it's own address on the web! 
And every toaster oven too! Using a web
interface that includes upcoming TV shows that you could click on,
the signal would go to the VCR to record those shows.  
<p>
<h3>How subtle should advertising be?  Very!</h3>
Concerning the VCR, as an example, if the VCR manufacturer visualized
the process as a complex synergistic alliance between themselves and
their customers, rather than between themselves and the broadcasters,
they could make VCR's that delete commercials.  So the price of
watching things live would simply be--the commercials.  Some would
pay it, some wouldn't.  But the advertisers would learn to live with
the new rules.  Remember, advertisers exist for the pleasure of their
companies' bottom line.  You have no obligation to buy their product
or even watch their commercial.  The average of 6 or 8 minutes of
commercials in every half hour of TV is absurd, and the only reason
it's so high is because people think they have to put up with it.  It
becomes a vicious circle wherein advertisers know you'll jump around
during thier commercials, so they buy key spots on a multitude of
stations so you'll eventually hear their message, usually dozens of
times.  
<p>
Have you ever had a commercial that irritated you <i>so much</i> that you
just had to turn it off or change the station <i>every time</i> it came on?  
Maybe a whiny voice or a company who gave you really bad service when you bought
their product.  For weeks, sometimes years, you have to keep the 
remote close to you.
<p>
It's like some creep that
keeps knocking on your door or calling you and they won't go away
until you've acknowledged their existence in some way.  Why do people
put up with it?  And who among us needs to be told thirty times in a
week which soda to drink?  Can't I just decide which one I like and
stick to it?  Why should car races, to pick on an easy 
tarket, for instance, ever have to be
interrupted on TV for commercials, when we're watching nothing more
than moving billboards flashing past stationary ones the whole time?  
Every wonder about that? Same with basketball and most other sports. 
<p>
The prime advertising is already on the field in
plain view.  So why the interruptions as well?  Just wondering.  
<p>
<h3>Can Multimedia help?  Yes!</h3>
Another way of looking at it:  If it's really <i>multimedia</i> like
"they" say it is, why can't we have one 'channel' (or whatever you
want to call it) of the MM experience be the commercial, and the rest
be interesting, so that interesting stuff is happening all the time? 
Even if the commercial is 'happening' all the time, well, that can be
perfectly OK if it's subtle enough, like a hook on a hat. 
<p>
Come to think of it, suppose we <i>only</i> allowed subliminal and
descreet advertising on TV, on the Internet, wherever?  Suppose, just for the
sake of arguement (I guess) that we (the viewing public)
<a href="/ascodesc/ascodesc.htm"><IMG HSPACE=0 WIDTH=32 HEIGHT=14 SRC="/pics/icons/ascolog1.gif" ALT=""></a>
<i>only</i> put up with the most subtle forms of advertisement.   Much
more subtle than that imbedded graphic, of course...  What if we
decided that subliminal was what we <i>wanted</i>?  Just asking.
<p>
Certainly various shoe companies don't need to ever take out a
'real' ad!  But they do, and shoes are such big business (at least my
shoes are big) that they can afford to hire the best directors,
and soon we're flooded with shoe ads.  We're convinced that the 
most important decision we'll make all year is whether we want 
air pockets or air pumps in our air shoes.  
<p>
<h3>The world crumbles... Whatever...</h3>
Meanwhile the world crumbles for lack of direction. 
We want to save the environment, but we won't build hydroelectric
dams for fear of the ecological damage it might cause.  So we listen
to the issues on the 6:00 news and it's the same issues over and
over, because it's just the basics.  Man destroys machine.  Man killed by
machine.  Unstoppable weather causes hurricanes in Florida and Texas
needs rain.  But the details are different every time, and there's a
pattern to some things but not to others, and some patterns are false
indicators of nonexistent events (being, in reality, indicators of
undiscovered <i>combinations</i> of events).  So the evening news
provides us with nearly nothing, but we know that we should buy new
shoes.
<p>
<h3>It's your Internet...</h3>
Is this what you want the Internet to become?  Are we really going to
turn over this wonderful distributed software communication machine to 
the big corporations and the silly shoe salesmen?  We laugh at Al Bundy 
and pay rapt attention to Air Jordan.  Why? 
<p>
Now that I'm finished with this article I'm going to go write an ad for 
<b>my</b> products, because <b>my</b> products are worth advertising!

<title> A suggested etiquette for Mountain Bikers </title>
</header>
<body>
<hr>
<h1> Can't we all just get along? </h1>
<hr>
<p>
Trail access is important to everybody!  Mountain Bikers are the new kid 
on the block, and we need to be especially careful about offending 
traditional (i.e. they were there first!) users of wilderness trails.  
<p>
We love to ride, right?  And we hate trail damage.  
Let's not damage relationships, either!  
Face it:  You <i>are</i> dangerous.  You are engaged in a risky
sport where you are silently hurtling a lethal weapon at speeds often
well above a fast run, in places that normally never experience anything
faster than a slow walk.  You have chosen to engage in this risky
behavior.  People have a right to fear you, and they do. 
So show lots of courtesy and consideration and hopefully we <i>can</i> all
just get along. 
In particular, mountain bikers should try to be respectful of:
<DL>
  <DT> <b>Hikers and joggers</b>
       <DD> Face it.  These people were here first and these trails 
wouldn't exist without their support.  Don't pass at excessive speed, 
and don't surprise them.  Be sure to announce your coming with a kind 
greeting or a bell.  I like the old style bells with the American Flag 
on them.  Their ring is a familiar and unmistakable sound, but sometimes 
I like to use a subtle noise like a gear shift or foot scrape. 
<p>
When they look up at you, they've seen you.  Until they look at you, 
they haven't seen you.  Sooner or later, you're going to have to get 
their attention before you can pass faster than a walk.  Always thank 
anyone who yields their right-of-way to you, or holds pets or young 
children as you pass.  
  <DT> <b>Horses</b>
       <DD> Dismount within about 50 feet of a horse, between your bike and 
the horse, downhill from the horse.  Take off your helmet and try to 
look human.  Really!  Talk to the rider, and talk to the horse (ask 
it's name.)  Get out of shadows so the horse can see you.  One rider 
we met asked us if we would feed the horse for 
him, and he gave us some carrots.  He said he was training the horse 
not to be afraid of bikers.  We did.  This is coexistence at it's finest.  
<p>
Most horse people will thank you for dismounting, and they all will
appreciate it.  Some will tell you you can come on.  But some are
riding new horses, or are new riders themselves, and are hanging on
for dear life.  Give 'em a break.  If you possibly can, go
out and ride a horse once in a while!  You'll understand much better.
  <DT> <b>The Environment</b>
       <DD> Seems kind of obvious, but anyway:  Don't leave energy bar 
wrappers (or anything else) on the trail!  The wrappers are usually made 
of just about the least biodegradable stuff on earth and everyone knows 
<i>exactly</i> what kind of trail user dropped them!  Don't leave
bike parts, gel tube tops, patch kits or <i>anything</i> on the trail.  
It's the second easiest way to get banned, after crashing into people.
  <DT> <b>Other Mountain Bikers They Meet</b>
       <DD> Pass with care.  Announce yourself.  The uphill rider, even 
though they are going slower, <i>always</i> has the right of way (though 
they often yield it to a fast downhiller.)  The group with children
has right of way.  Next, the larger group has right of way.  Last, the group
with the most rigid frames has right of way!  (You might have to stop
and count to achieve this level of etiquette!) 
  <DT> <b>Other Mountain Bikers They Ride With</b>
       <DD> Never, ever tailgate.  Don't even <i>think</i> of 
tailgating.  Instead, think of NOT tailgating.  Out on the trail, you 
should stay far enough behind so that if the rider in front crashes
--or merely slows down--
for no apparent reason, you don't then crash into them.  On technical 
sections, stay at least one section back from the rider in front of you.  
It is <i>not</i> a race.  Yell "TRACK, PLEASE!" if you want to pass, or
something.  Tailgating makes the person ahead of you ride faster than
they are comfortable with.  If you <i>ever</i> run into the person in front
of you, not only have you committed a dangerous mistake, but you have
instilled in them a fear of you being behind them which will make
them try to ride faster than they should go.  
<p>
It is your responsibility, when riding behind someone, to make sure they 
feel that they will NEVER have to worry that you will run into them if
they stop, no matter how suddenly and unexpectedly.  Do not pass
unexpectedly, and do not pass on the right.  If you pull alongside,
announce yourself by saying "On your right!" or "On your left!" 
<p>
Mountain biking is an inherently dangerous sport.  We all know that. 
But does that mean you shouldn't try to be as safe as you can?  Of
course not!  Safety is cumulative.  So if you are doing something
inherently dangerous, the least you can do is not add to that danger
yourself by acting irresponsibly!  
<p>
It is your responsibility not to be the cause of an increase in that danger 
for your fellow riders.  Do not go around blind turns with excessive speed. 
As one person put it, "Imagine a horse person with both guns drawn is 
around each corner."   And don't ever, ever tailgate.  Don't even
come close.  If you can ride faster, then go first if you want, or
force yourself to hold back.  Anything else is irresponsible.
<p>
  <DT> <b>Trains and Train Tracks</b>
       <DD> Trains go really, really fast.  And you may not
realize it, but they are
virtually silent, especially if the wind is right and/or there's a bend in
the tracks and/or your hearing isn't that good.  
So don't be a track-ass.  Respect the tracks.  Don't mingle on or near them.
Train engineers don't deserve
to have to worry about careless bikers on their right-of-way. 
They'll probably report you to somebody, as you are undoubtedly 
trespassing, so don't stop 
near tracks if you can help it.  Don't <i>ever</i> sit on the tracks.
<p>
If you must ride alongside a track,
do it quickly and stay as far to the side as you possibly can.  
<p>
When you cross the tracks, stop, look, and listen.  Even though you
are sure there is nothing coming, treat the tracks like there could
be at any time.  Even if you think you have lots of experience, don't
forget that faster and faster trains are appearing all the time. 
Stay off the tracks!  
<p>
If you decide that you absolutely have to cross a railroad bridge, you 
better have a dam.ed good reason!  There is NOT enough room for you  
and a train, let alone your bike and you and a train.  
If you decide that you MUST cross a
railroad bridge, then <b>plan</b> what you are going to do if a train comes. 
That usually means how you are going to throw your bike off and then jump off 
the bridge, or where you are going to wedge yourself into the
structure if the moment comes. And if a train comes, put that plan into 
action <i>immdiately</i>!  You
probably cannot make it to the edge of the bridge, and your chance
of missing the timing is great.  If memory serves me correctly, I've
heard that most people who are killed on railroad bridges 
were in the act of trying to run off the bridge when they were hit.  
<p>
They thought they could
make it.  A better plan is to <i>get out of the way</i> using your
pre-arranged plan.  And don't forget about the suction that the
train's wind creates.  You need to be well away from
the train when it blows by you at 80+ MPH (over 100 km/hr). 
Better yet, find another way around.  This is worth a detour of many
miles.
<p>
Stay off highways too.  Cars and trucks come up awfully fast as well. 
Leave roads to the roadies.
  <DT> <b>Small Children</b>
       <DD> Toddlers do very strange, unexpected things.  They walk in 
front of you, they reach for your spokes, they fall down.  NEVER, EVER 
run into a child.  You really have to slow down near them, so much that 
if the child suddenly turned and ran right in front of your wheel, you 
could stop.  Period.  If you hit a kid, it's your fault.  Period.
  <DT> <b>Large Animals</b>
        <DD> If you think toddlers do strange, unexpected things
(which they do) I suggest you not spend time around mountain lions, 
bobcats, and other large wild animals.

This letter is pretty self-explanatory.  We all know what Rice Krispies are!  I was pretty upset that they would publish a chart like the one described in this letter!

P.O. Box CAMB
Battle Creek MI 49016-1986		          August 5th, 1993
<br>
To whom in may concern;
<br>
I am disgusted with the sleazy chart on the side of your new RICE KRISPIES TREATS sample box (Carton No. K-1395S.)  You imply, by showing only the top 1/3 of the chart, that your cereal contains about 1/3 less grams of sugar than "other" brands.  This implication is made by a careful and planned, I'm sure heavy colorization of the bars in the chart, and small black numerals WHICH START AT SEVEN!!!  
<p>
Come on, be real:  Charts start at ZERO.  There is only a relatively insignificant 5% to 8% difference between your cereal and the two you choose to compare it to.  Added to that, you compare it to two ridiculously sweet cereals.   NOTHING justifies the claim made above the chart, that this difference in sweetness allows us to treat our families every day!  This is dishonest, deceptive advertising and you should be totally ashamed of yourselves.
<p>
Why not do an experiment:  Put someone in a room with a K-1395S box and a bowl of milk and after they have breakfast, ask them how much less grams of sugar they think are in your cereal versus others mentioned on the box.  I bet most people will say "a third less" because that's what the chart shows at a quick glance.  That proves it's dishonest.  Or, did you already DO that experiment and are you HAPPY with the results?  
<p>
Thank you in advance for your attention.  The favor of a reply would be appreciated.  Regular Rice Krispies are one of my absolute favorite cereals.  It saddens me to see such deceptive advertising.
<p>
Sincerely,
<br>

This letter is pretty self-explanatory.  Marketplace Radio is usually an excellent Public-Radio show but as far as I'm concerned, this report should never have been aired.  Much to their credit, Marketplace Radio presented excerpts from this during their "letters" section.

Letters 
<br>
Marketplace Radio				Feb 4th, 1993
<br>
Los Angeles CA 90089
<br>
To The Editor (Producer?):
<br>
Your commentary by Jeff Striker on donation of body parts was 180 degrees away from being DEAD on the mark.  
<p>
Allowing the "default" to be that body parts from recently dead people will be used if possible will decrease the chances of a "body snatchers" scenario he tries to scare us with.  
<p>
By making more body parts available more quickly, the urgent need could be reduced.  The body parts are already in GRAVE demand, so, by the laws of supply and demand, their value would be reduced if they are easier to obtain.  This would also be the civilized thing to do.
<p>
Furthermore, he dismisses the rights of the community and the sick individuals within that community completely for the so-called "rights" of the religious fanatics who don't have the common decency and good sense to want their body parts reused if possible.  Their body parts still wouldn't be used!  Isn't that good enough--do we have to hurt everyone else in order to treat them with kid gloves?
<p>
Besides, this is a relatively small proportion of the population as compared to the potential population that could use the parts--namely all of us.  
<p>
And on top of that, shame on MARKETPLACE for giving this medical insurance man with a partisan interest a soapbox on your show.  People are dying, today, because of people like him.
<p>
Sincerely,
<br>
Russell Hoffman
<br>
P.S.  Love your show 99 times out of 100!

<title>How AT&T could get people to buy Video Phones</title>

<hr>
VideoPhones are the next great thing--and have been for 50 years.  Frame rates have increased, and they now use color.  Resolution needs to be improved too:  The <i>viewer</i> needs to be able to adjust for higher frame rates or higher resolution, on the fly.
<p>
What could AT&T do to get people to buy VideoPhones for homes, schools and businesses?  Here's a suggestion they didn't use--so far.
<hr>
<br>
President,
<br>
AT&T
<br>
May 5th, 1993
<br>
Dear Sir or Madam,
<p>
Recently I was at a large office supply store and they had an AT&T VideoPhone running a video demo.  Of course, a real demo would have been more impressive--for example, what if AT&T had aimed a VideoPhone camera at Times Square, NYC and let people watch live personal "TV"?  If the cost of using a telephone line to sell a VideoPhone is too expensive, well, you've only yourself to blame!
<p>
I have a very serious suggestion on how to get these things into the market at last.  As you know, to some extent the technology has been possible for decades, although your new system gives us color and frame rates that are much better than the grainy blacks & whites which even now are transmittable by "HAM" short-wave radio operators.
<p>
So it's a given, we think:  at last we have a system that will be used.  
<p>
AT&T should supply <i>every </i> <b>911 Emergency Telephone Center</b> with a VideoPhone!
<p>
It would be reassuring to the caller to see someone who can arrange for help.  It would be damning of any criminals that wander into the house!  It would reduce prank and false calls, such as those from little children playing.  And most of all, it would add a huge measure of comfort and safety to ANYONE who owns a VideoPhone!  The direct benefits are obvious.  
<p>
Have you heard the joke about what the best thing to do is in case of fire in a major city?  Call Domino's Pizza--they guarantee they'll arrive in 20 minutes or less!!
<p>
Of course, we all know that Emergency response times are as short as possible and that the responding agency often has to balance a number of factors in deciding how to respond, including severity of the problem, availability of vehicles and personnel, and a number of other factors.  Seeing a growing bedroom fire should be quite convincing.  
<p>
Furthermore, the image could be forwarded to the cab of the responding vehicle so they know just what they are about to face!
<p>
I think, in fact, you could cancel all other advertising campaigns for the VideoPhones (which I see and hear regularly) and with the millions you save, simply place them in 911 offices and send out press releases, and you will see an explosion in the use of these things.  You also will have done a world of good for people. 
<p>
On a related topic of VideoPhones, I would like to know what arrangements are being made for companies like mine (we create and market animated software) to be able to use VideoPhone technology.  
<p>
Are any IBM-compatible computer cards being designed or manufactured that I can simply plug a VCR into, that work with a Sound Blaster or compatible card and a VGA or SVGA monitor?  That way I can avoid the use of the Video Phone itself and use my existing technology (plus this card I speak of) to accomplish not just the same thing, but a more versatile thing?  Are the signal specifications available so that I can develop and market this card myself?
<p>
This is also vital if you really want the VideoPhone technology to take off.  You can't expect to go it alone and have done everything that needs to be done.  AT&T is big, but like any one company, other ideas are "out there" and need to be exploited.  
<p>
Remember what IBM did with the personal computer?  They had a totally open technology and now there are 50,000 companies in the U.S.--including mine--whose existence to totally based on the existence of the IBM standard.  While IBM doesn't own all of the market, one can be sure that that portion they do own is bigger than the whole pie would have been if they had kept to a closed architecture.
<p>
Please tell me how to obtain specifications for the VideoPhone,  including voltage requirements, compression algorithms, start- and stop-bit and parity bit arrangements, and all other related data.
<p>
I look forward to hearing from you and/or your staff.  Thank you, in advance, for your attention.
<p>
Sincerely,
<br>

<title>Why Can't AT&T Print on Both Sides of a page?</title>

<hr>
This letter is from around 1994 and is self-explanatory.  I finally left AT&T for the first
time in years, to a company that does indeed print statements on both
sides of the page.  Haven't seen the fancy graphs yet, anywhere.  I
never heard from J. P. or his staff...

<p>
Dear Sir,
<p>
I think it's high time AT&T put some REAL effort into the whole environmental issue--NOT just using partly recycled paper for their statements.
<p>
I call your attention to the following:  On my bills, there is a statement that AT&T is doing their part for the environment.  But are they?  Here are two suggestions that would together save up to 75% or more in paper waste, and probably start a trend in the industry.
<p>
First, why not print the statements in a much smaller type font?  You could as the customer how small they want it and print accordingly.  I use a computer program here at my office that prints 4 pages on a standard 8.5X11 sheet.  It's great for documents that need to be stored for a long time--like phone bills.
<p>
Second, why in the world can't the statements be printed on BOTH sides of the page?  You can't tell me that printers like that aren't available--in the quantities you guys use, I'm sure EPSON or Hewlett Packard or somebody would be happy to design and build one for you!  THAT would save not only nearly 50% on paper costs, but would cut down on postage, and thus on energy usage by the mail service in delivering the documents.
<p>
Next, I call your attention to the information on the statements themselves.  The level of detail is often not as useful as you might think.  How about printing some small graphs showing peak usage hours, peak areas of the country, etc.?  You could laser-print a outline-map of the USA in an area about 1 inch by 2 inches which would contain more information than I get from several pages of detail listing.  Just put a dot near where each call came from!  
After all, as an executive, I'm USED to looking at "the big picture."
<p>
I hope you find these ideas useful and are able to take advantage of as many of them as possible.  Please be kind enough to circulate these comments among other AT&T top executives for their consideration also.
<p>
Thank you, in advance, for your consideration.
<p>
Sincerely,
<p>

This document is the first of three, concerning a so-called "smoking initiative" presented to the California public by the tobacco lobby. It is part of our <i>EXAMPLES IN THE ART OF COMPLAINING</i> book.  
<p>
I never received any reply to this letter one way or the other.  So I went public...(see letters two and three.)
<p>
I have no idea who the "Donna M." it is addressed to is, they wouldn't supply last names.  Very strange.  Be sure to see parts two and three for a more complete picture.

<p>
Dear Ms Donna M.:
<br>
<p>
I am writing you this letter to inform you that I am unable to endorse or sign your petition.  It is not anything like what I expected when I said on the phone to your caller that I would sign an anti-smoking petition.
<p>
I feel that the regulations as proposed are absurdly weak but worse than that, they preempt local efforts to enact truly effective anti-smoking regulations.  What is the purpose of that?  
<p>
Is it wrong for a city to ban smoking entirely in restaurants, for example--which is the only truly effective way to stop second-hand smoke pollution, and is the only way to allow restaurants that truly want to be non-smoking to compete?
<p>
I respectfully request information about who is funding your organization and when it was formed, etc.  What is the exact name of the group and who are the principals?  Perhaps with this information I will be better able to endorse your plan-but I doubt it.  
<p>
I await your reply.
<p>
Sincerely,
<p>

This document is the second of three, concerning a so-called "smoking initiative" presented to the California public by the tobacco lobby. It is part of our <i>EXAMPLES IN THE ART OF COMPLAINING</i> book.  
<p>
<HR>
<p>

<br>
Tony Miller
<br>
Acting Secretary of State
<br>
State of California
<br>
Sacramento CA
<p>
May 10th, 1994
<p>
Dear Mr. Miller:
<br>
<p>
I read today in the San Diego Union Tribune that your office is investigating the behavior of the group promoting the California Uniform Tobacco Control Act.  I would like to add my voice to those concerned and dismayed by the behavior of this group.
<p>
I received a petition to sign from this group with a cover letter which stated that here is the petition you <i>"promised to sign"</i> (my italics.)  I was immediately bothered by this because I would not have "promised" to sign anything I had not had a chance to read!  Furthermore I was bothered by the feeling that others who get a letter like that might feel obligated to sign, simply because they thought they had promised to sign...
<p>
It started with a phone call asking if I would sign--I believe the exact words were--"an anti-smoking initiative that severely restricts smoking throughout the state."  I told them that not only would I sign such I thing, but that my wife would, too.  I hardly think that constitutes a "promise to sign," but even if it did, I do not think they have any right to describe their initiative as severely restricting or banning anything.  I feel that they misrepresented their initiative on the phone.
<p>
Furthermore, upon receiving the initiative I nearly made the mistake of signing it!  I thought I had read it carefully enough to understand it, and felt it was "a good first step."  Fortunately my wife, who happens to be an Editor of a magazine and is thus, I guess, a better reader than I (and a better reader than most) saw through it and caught the words "preempts local regulations."  I was shocked when I saw what I had nearly done!
<p>
I sent them the enclosed letter but have not heard anything from them in response to my query about who was funding them.  I think they should be required by law to respond to that sort of request, personally.
<p>
And as if all of the above were not enough to dismay me, later on outside of the local (Carlsbad) PRICE CLUB warehouse store, a person was soliciting signatures for this very same initiative--my wife and I both recognized it as being exactly the same petition--and when we asked him about whether it was funded by the tobacco lobby (we didn't know at the time but had begun to suspect that it was) he told us that it was not!  
<p>
He said there was another petition being presented by, I think he said  American Tobacco Company or some such, which was to paraphrase him "sly and dishonest."  He was not able to tell us who was funding his petition.  We now know it is, of course, Philip Morris U.S.A.  and other tobacco companies.  We have not been able to learn anything about this supposed "other petition."
<p>
In conclusion I think that this petition should be rejected and not be allowed on the ballot regardless of how many signatures they gathered because of the manner in which it was presented to the voters on the telephone, the careful wording of the petition which I believe is meant to deceive, and the dishonest comments of the workers in the group--both the telephone solicitor and the person outside Price Club.  
<p>
I also believe that all management-level workers in the group should be barred from presenting similar petitions in the state of California.  
<br>
Sincerely,
<br>
Russell Hoffman

This document is the last of three, concerning a so-called "smoking initiative" presented to the California public by the tobacco lobby. It is part of our <i>EXAMPLES IN THE ART OF COMPLAINING</i> book.  
<p>
The initiative was roundly defeated when the vote came, due in large part, I think, to letters like this that began to appear all around the state in a variety of newspapers.
<p>
If memory serves me correctly, it was the most money (or nearly so) spend on a failed initiative in California history.  We now have a very smoke-free state with no smoking in workplaces, restaurants, stores, and most other public-usage buildings (except bars...)

<p>
To The Editor:
<br>
If Prop 188, the smoking industry's hypocritical attempt to remove local anti-smoking ordinances passes, it will be a sad day for California.
<p>
It will not prove that the people want Philip Morris and the rest of the tobacco industry to decide how we should run our state.  
<p>
Rather, it will prove that Californians have not been paying enough attention to what's happening in and around our government, have not been paying enough attention to their blessed right to enact propositions, and most importantly, it will prove that millions of dollars and a glitzy and dishonest ad campaign can still buy and dupe the voting public.  I was duped when I first heard about it.  
<p>
My biggest fear is that many people will first hear about it while they are in the voting booth.  That could have serious health consequences for the citizens of this state.
<p>
Last spring I received a phone call by someone asking if I would vote for a "tough statewide anti-smoking bill."  Naturally I said that I would.  But what was sent to me to sign was neither tough, nor even anti-smoking.  And the cover letter said that I had "promised to sign" the enclosed petition!
<p>
Like heck I "promised" anything!  I doubt that anyone would have "promised" to sign a petition which they had not yet had a chance to read.  Indeed, upon reading it, at first I thought I would sign it "as a good first step."  But my wife read it and pointed out that it preempts local regulations.  
<p>
I believe that Prop. 188 would never have made it to the ballot box had it not been presented from the start in a crafty and dishonest manner.  I wrote to the address that sent me the petition, (there were no full names anywhere) asking who sponsored them, and asking why in the world an anti-smoking group would want to preempt effective local legislation?  I never received a reply.
<p>
Prop. 188 is a bad idea.  It is presented by dishonest people.  If you are sick of the tobacco industry's lies, vote NO on Prop. 188.
<p>
Sincerely,
<p>
Russell Hoffman

<p>
Advice is a wonderful thing.  You should get as much of it as you can
in life.  But be careful not to apply the advice in the wrong
situation, and be careful to think about whether one person's
situtation is comparable to your own, which might render the advice
ill-advised.
<p>
If you think it's not possible for a 15 year old Connecticut Yankee 
to work in a pub in London, England,
 with no 'green' card, and accidentally start a fight with
a bar patron who the constables comes and kick out, and keep your job,
well, I'm here to tell you it <i>is</i> possible.  I know because I
did it, and I'm sure the statutes of limitations have all run out. 
Nonetheless, I'll keep the names out of the story.
<p>
Since you're probably wondering how it's possible to accidentally
start a bar fight, here's the trick:  Listen to your coworkers.  Do
everything they tell you to do.  I'll explain it all in detail in a
moment.
<p>
<h3>Gotta have that green thing...</h3>
To work in a foreign country, or for foreigners to work here,
something generally called a 'green card' is needed, which you get
(if you're lucky) from a host country.  Otherwise, you have to work
'outside the law' and hold a job illegally.  Or you don't work.
<p>
When I was 14 my mother, my older brother and I all traveled around
Europe one summer.  I turned 15, and my brother went back to America 
and my mom and I
stayed for nearly three more months in a 'flat' in London (A flat is 
what we call an apartment in America.).  I wanted a
job after school so I could earn some money (something I was
cronically short of at the time, and still am today!)
<p>
Upon attempting to get a job, I quickly learned that I needed some
sort of permission from Her Majesty or somebody, or no one could
legally hire me.  Getting into school on the other hand was 
relatively easy and 
I was able to go to a lovely public school (which they call a private
school) in London where the food was excellent (but the students all
hated it).  But when I tried to get a job, I waited five hours in a 
'queue' (we call it a line in the U.S.) to be told I was too young.
<p>
<h3>Opportunity knocks at last...</h3>
I was dejected, but one day when I came home from school my mother
told me to talk to one of our downstairs neighbors, who knew of a job
I might be able to get.  It turned out it was at a local pub as
something called a "potman" which in America, is generally called a busboy. 
All we did was we would walk around and pick up empty bottles, and wipe off
counters and tables if they looked dirty.  We never sold anything or
brought food or drink.  We could send over a waitress or waiter but that would
be it.  Nevertheless we did occasionally get tips.  
<p>
One time a patron bought me a beer.  The proprietor's wife let me
drink it, but gave me a good stiff warning not to have too much, or
have it 
too often.  It wasn't my first beer (I don't remember my first beer,
but I do remember leaving a note on my door when I went to bed after
my first beer, which was a six-pack, asking my family to let me
sleep through my hangover.)
<p>
Most of the other "potmen" were older gentlemen, retirees of some
sort or other.  They were all wonderful, of course, and so were the waiters,
waitresses, barmaids and bartenders, and most of the patrons, and even the 
Gov'nor and his wife were fine folks.  Even the house band was great--I had a great time.  
<p>
<h3>Always listen to your coworkers...</h3>
But one day, the oldest potmen of them all and I were talking.  He
was a great guy, actually my favorite, a shriveled up old guy
probably in his 80's, or at least 70's, with half his jaw missing
(old war injury?).  He had taken me under his wing and taught me how
to do the job.  You'd think it'd be easy, and I guess it is, but
still, the first time you 'solo' you have to know that you need to go
from room to room in a pattern, that you should check this trash can,
and always ask that bartender if he needs anything since when it's
busy he can't go around the corner and get it himself like he
usually does.  Little things, but it adds up.  He must of been doing
it for decades.
<p>
You have to go from room to room, and you should check to see if the
bottles are empty.  If they are, then next time around or the time
after that, you'll pick
them up.  No one likes to sit without a beer in front of them, so by
picking the bottles up, they are 'forced' to order more beer.  Pretty
subtle, eh?  We were actually supposed to consider this--it was the
reason we existed.  That, and to scoop up the empties from the folks
that have no problem ordering more and have a table full of bottles.
<p>
And you thought we were just being nice!  Nobody ever hired anybody
just to be nice to people!
<p>
The barmaids and bartenders would get bottles of beer as tips, and 
they'd often have
an open one so the patrons wouldn't be offended if they acknowledged
the tip by simply moving a beer from the cupboard to a box under the
counter.  At the end of the night, they'd go home with half a case,
sometimes more, even as much as two cases of beer each.
<p>
So one day, the old geezer and I were talking.  (That's what we all 
called him, and he knew it too, and didn't care.  But we didn't do 
it to his face.  It wasn't meant as an insult, it was just the way 
it was.  He was an old geezer.)
<p>
We were talking about some of the patrons that grumble when we pick
up the empties.  Yes, sometimes they would claim there's still beer
in that there bottle.  Yet we had passed it half a dozen times and
there ain't nothing to sip in there.  The old geezer told me that if
the guy gets nasty, he just tells 'em to go to another pub.
<p>
<h3>What happened next?</h3>
Well, it was either later that very night, or else the next night,
when sure enough, some regular gets all testy with me for picking up
his bottles too soon.
<p>
"You're always picking up the bottle before it's empty"  he says.
<p>
"You can just go to another pub."
<p>
<h3>Big Mistake.</h3>
<p>
He asks me what I said.
<p>
Stumbling, I say something about I'm just doing my job and if you
don't like the way I do it there are plenty of other pubs around here
and you can go to any of them.
<p>
So the drunk stands up, and he's probably a foot taller than me and
can't be under 16 or 18 stone, which is 224 pounds minimum to us 
Americans.  The biggest guy in the pub, without question.  He stood
up and I thought he was going to say something.  He didn't.
<p>
I had two or three bottles on my tray at the time he slapped me.  It
was a powerful backhanded slap that hurt like the Dickens.  But what
are you going to do?  (I would have broken the neck off a bottle on a table 
and made him apologize, said a fellow potman, later.)  
<p>
I didn't drop the bottles.  In fact I didn't do anything.  I didn't even stop
looking at him.  I think this surprised him, because we just stood
there for a second before he thought of what he wanted to do next.  
He then backhand-slapped me even harder on the other 
cheek.  I should have known!  Somehow I still didn't drop the bottles, 
but by this time I decided I should at least leave the room, so I did, 
and I went up to the bar in the next room and simply said to the
first coworker I came across: "There's a guy causing trouble in the front room".  
While she went to investigate and to tell the management, someone 
else took one look at me and drew me a half pint of ale.
<p>
<h3>Nobody's perfect.  Some of us aren't even close.</h3>
Okay, Okay, go ahead, tell me I was wrong.  I <i>was</i> wrong!  But
more than that, I was <i>incredibly stupid</i>.  Later that night,
an old couple that were also regulars told me I was wrong.  They
usually sat in a different room but that night, they were right next
to me when the guy whacked me.  They said I stood up to him well,
but that I should never have said anything in the first place.  I
have no doubt they were right about that, of course.
<p>
The constables came, and the Gov'nor's wife told me to stay in the back
room, and she refused to let the constables talk to me, since I was underage
(and didn't have a green card.)   She told them I was all shaken up.
<p>
The patron was told to go to another pub and apparently it took a bit of
convincing but he finally left, and I never saw him again.  
<p>
When I saw my friend the old geezer again I was able to laugh about it. 
"I took your advice and guess what!  It didn't work too good!"  
<p>
I think his response was something like: "What?  Oh, that.  Yeah, I heard 
about it."  Then of course, he explained to me how I should be careful
about getting certain patrons mad.  "I knew he was a rough one,
Russ.  I always was wary of him.  He had that look in his eye."  
<p>
Everyone else, of course, told me to be more careful about 
taking <i>any</i> of the old geezers' advice.  
<p>
<h3> What I learned:</h3>
That night, a warm beer helped, and a few minutes sitting down
got me revived.  It was the talk of the pub for days.  For years my jaw creaked,
reminding me in no uncertain terms that <b>the feelings of the 
customer always comes first</b>.  
<p>
I also learned that if you can survive a blow to one cheek,  
it's not that much harder to survive a blow to the other. 
<p>
I learned that it's never too late to try to de-escalate a fight.  
<p>
I learned to like warm beer.

<h1> Census Taker--1980 Census... </h1>

<p>
If you're not too busy at the turn of the decade, and you're a United States
Citizen, do yourself a favor.  Help take the census.  Oh, the people
you'll meet!  
<p>
<h3></h3>
<p>
There are two forms in the U.S. census.  Most people get the short
form.  Everybody else gets the long form.
<p>
No matter which form you get, a lot of people don't like to return
the forms.  This is really a shame.  The United States Census is an
important marker upon which the spending of billions, if not trillions 
of dollars each year is based.
<p>
This single event is used to determine not just representation in
Congress, which is its most important function, but thousands of
other more mundane things.  Ultimately, it is used to decide how much
money gets dispersed to each community from federal, state, and local
governments.  So it's very important, on a local basis, to get
counted.  If you and your neighbors all try to pretend you don't
exist, by not returning the forms or not answering the questions
correctly, you all loose out in a very real sense.  Dollars and
cents.
<p>
The Federal Government hires tens of thousands of local residents to
comb the entire community and find, ideally, everybody.  Every known 
address is required to be accounted for.  Even every unknown address
is required to be accounted for, but some people feel they don't 
make a solid enough effort at that and there have been lawsuits 
against the census over undocumented residents.  
<p>
Every known address receives either a
short form or a long form, which is decided randomly, or at least
psuedo-randomly by a big computer, presumably in Washington D.C..
<p>
Once the computer has picked which form that household has to fill
out, there's no changing it.  Of course, even the long form doesn't
really take that long to fill out, I think we were expected to be
able to do it in about 12 minutes.  The short form was something like
4 minutes.  
<p>
<h3> But it's too much work... </h3>
<p>
I recall most of the forms we had to try to get filled out were long 
forms.  Twelve minutes every ten years for <i>one</i> member of the 
household was just <i>such</i> an imposition!
<p>
A few months after all the forms were all mailed out, the residences
that had not been accounted for had to be physically canvassed.  That
was our job.  We were paid substantially more for getting a long form
filled out than a short form, but we each got a few square blocks in
one of Connecticut's largest cities and all the forms from that area
were supposed to be accounted for one way or another.
<p>
We had to take an oath.  An oath to faithfully gather the
information, and to never divulge the information we gathered, not
even to another Government agency. (Except by order of a court, I
guess, which as best I can recall learning, has <i>never</i> 
happened in the history of the census.)
<p>
<h3> It always starts this way...</h3>
<p>
It would start with a knock on the door.  "Hi, I'm from the 
Census Bureau.  We haven't recieved a form from this
household.  I need to know the names and ages of everybody who was 
residing at this household on..."  and give the nationwide date, 
May 1st I think it was.
<p>
Thus we would start to state our business,
and ask the person that answers the door if they would take the time
to fill out the form with us right now.  We would get a hard time
sometimes, and of course everybody wanted to switch to the short
form, but hardly anybody flat-out refused.  After all, there was that
softly worded comment about how filling this thing out is required by 
law, and <i>someone else</i> will come back if they refuse to give
<i>me</i> the information.
<p>
"You don't have to fill it out with me, but I can't leave the form. 
If you don't find and return the original form within about ten days, 
someone else will come back to try to have the form filled out with them."
<p>
Who would <i>you</i> rather give the information to?  Some jerk who
obviously just needed a summer job one year, or "them"--the other people
from the government who will come back later? 
<p>
<h3> It was subtle. </h3>
<p>
It was effective.
<p>
And, someone <i>would</i> come back, you knew that.  First, your manager. 
After that, I don't know what would really happen, but someone would
be back after me, that was for sure.
<p>
Some people actually had reasonable reasons not to want to fill out 
the form with you, so you really had no right to be forceful about it
(and you were told not to be).  
<p>
Perhaps you were just too close a neighbor, for instance, and
they felt embarassed about something.  Or perhaps, say, you're a male
census taker and the person just doesn't want to tell you that he 
and his wife both work and their three teenage daughters stay home 
alone.  Wouldn't you hesitate to disclose that to a total stranger?
<p>
But usually, the people don't really mind.  They just didn't get around to
filling out the form, and they're perfectly happy to do it with you. 
<p>
And then, it gets <i>really</i> fun.
<p>
<h3> Did you know?... </h3>
<p>
Did you know that people love to talk about themselves?  Of course
you did!  And it's wonderful, because nothing says you can't be 
friendly and ask them what it's like to do their job.  The best 
response you can give to someone who tells you what they do for 
a living is to put down your #2 pencil and say "That sounds interesting.  
What's it like?"
<p>
You're paid by the form, not the hour.  So 12 minutes can stretch
to an hour if you're both having fun.   "Would you like another cup of
coffee?"  
<p>
When you do the census, you meet a lot of people.  Different people,
different from you.  You go into all kinds of neighborhoods.  All
kinds of people don't return the forms!  And this is good for you.
You learn what you suspected all along:  People are all just people.  
<p>
I know, for example, which race of people living in an inner city in
Connecticut in 1980 (race as defined in the census form, to be exact) 
prefers DURKEE'S LOUISIANA RED HOT SAUCE over TABASCO.  Just about
every kitchen had salt, pepper, formica, and Durkee's Red Hot... 
It made me want to "accidentally" show up at lunchtime or dinnertime!
<p>
The long form requires you to specify job titles and a bunch of other 
stuff which I can't remember (this was 16 years ago).
<p>
I remember job titles was in it, because at one place I visited, I had 
to ask the manager which apartment was which.  When I was leaving, he 
asked me what the resident had said was her occupation.
<p>
I laughed and said it would be a federal offense to tell him.
<p>
"Cause what she really is, is a prostitute"  he tells me.  I
shrug.   "We have to write down what they say" I say, and get in my
car.
<p>
<h3> Dog's are our #1 concern </h3>
<p>
Even in the inner part of one of the country's most dangerous cities,
the most dangerous thing we normally faced was dogs.  I got
nipped by this tiny little rat of a dog.  "Oh, Pooch!  Bad dog! Go inside!"
says the lady.
<p>
"You <i>what</i>?" says my boss when I tell her about it three days later.  
"Why didn't you tell me right away?" I just didn't think that little dog 
had rabies, I guess.  He was just a
mean little punk of a dog that hated everybody that came up the
steps.  One of those yelping little jumpy things with a head the size
of a tangerine.  A tangerine with sharp little teeth that cut right
through trousers.

<h3>Smile and the World Smiles With You... I Think...</h3>
<p>
I used to service vending machines for a small outfit in a big city
in Connecticut.  I was the #1 Vendor Tender at the company.   
What made me #1 was that my counts were accurate, and my machines
produced better income, because I'd vary the mix and try different
things and mainly, pay a little attention.
<p>
It was
the coldest winter Connecticut had experienced in decades, and surely
the coldest I have ever experienced.  Up before 5:00 am, crack the
ice off the windshield of the car, drive to work
before six, load soda and candy into the truck, crack the ice
off the windshield of the truck, and then travel to the
first stop, which I reach by about 7:00 am.  It was a good job, which
I quit only when something substantially better came along,
owning a spice route I think was next.  
<p>
We serviced
all sorts of interesting places.  We serviced machines at the airport,
at gun manufacturers, wire weavers, flea-bag hotels, office
buildings, and just about every local government building you can
imagine, including City Hall, the Welfare Department, the City Jail,
the locker room of the main Police depot, and all kinds of other
wonderful places.
<p>
It was a seedy job.  When my boss was taking me around showing me the
route, he said if anyone ever asks for their money back, just give it
to them cheerfully.  Smile.  If it's the same person every week and it seems 
to be a problem, just keep paying it out because a lot of times, they
actually do use the machine a lot and they do get ripped off just
about every week.
<p>
And smile, smile, smile.  He looked at me and smiled, and said 
to remember to smile, especially if it starts getting hot tempered,
because it's much harder to punch a face that's smiling at you.  I smiled
at him.  I remembered.
<p>
And if anyone wants to take the company's hard-earned coinage, go ahead and let them lug it home. 
Offer them the hand truck if you have to, but <i>don't get hurt</i>. 
<p>
One day, I get back to my truck and I'm loading the hand truck into
the back, and I see that the side door is ajar.  When I go around to
the side, there's a guy in there with the safe open and he's loading
his arms up with coin bags.  I say something disgustedly, like "oh man..."
and turn away and back off, and he gets out with his arms loaded with
bags and starts walking away.  I keep my distance.  
<p>
I didn't want to turn my back on him, but was backed towards a wall, so I 
was put in a somewhat confrontational position.  I start 
suggesting to him that he should just sort of drop the bags and go away. 
Just talking to him, I guess, so he knows I'm not jumpy.  They hate
jumpy customers, it makes them nervous.  Try to keep your criminal calm at all times.
<p>
<h3>I Was Lucky To Escape With My Life!</h3>
<p>
He calmly threatened to put his screwdriver
into my stomach and since this screwdriver had previously been used
as a prybar to open the safe, I knew that a) he was not averse to
missusing tools and b) it was a big screwdriver.  I backed off some
more as he kept walking away.
<p>
Just then a security guard came out of the building, so I started
yelling that this guy had just robbed my truck, and he started giving
chase, but the guy got in a car and it sped off, and the security guard
had to jump aside, but still managed to slam his billyclub into the
hood of the car.  I don't know why he didn't aim for the windshield,
but he didn't.
<p>
I spent the afternoon looking at photos at the police station, but I
couldn't possibly identify him.  Just didn't feel like going back to
work that afternoon, I guess.
<p>
<h3>Mr. Saturday Night--Special...</h3>
<p>
I had been to the police station every week, but always in the
basement servicing the vending machines in the police locker room. 
There's hardly ever anyone there.  For a while there was a poster I
really wanted on the bulletin board.  I wanted to steal it, make a
copy of it, and return it, but then another copy of it showed
up next to the gun counter, and the one on the bulletin board
was half-covered by something else, so finally I just took it.  Call
me a thief if you must.  Call it my bad environment, which I'm about
to describe.
<p>
It's a picture of
a gun about the size of, and designed to be worn in place of, a large
beltbuckle.  Underneath the "actual size" drawing is a statement
saying, in effect, that you better look for things this small anywhere. 
<p>
We had three machines in the locker room.  A cigarette vending
machine (which I never handled) and a soda machine and a candy
machine.
<p>
One day, I go in, and the candy machine is <b>all smashed up</b>.  
Wrecked, bashed, glass broken, money gone, or most of it.  Lot's of
candy gone too.  Out of position.   My poor machine.  What did it do? 
I always give money back whenever anyone asks for it?  
<p>
<h3> You're Not Going To Believe This... </h3>
<p>
Now, I'm in shock.  I stand there and stare at the machine for a
while, then go off and call my boss.  I start out with, You're Not
Gonna Believe This, and tell him what I found.
<p>
<h3> Here's the Part You're Not Going To Believe... </h3>
<p>
He say's yeah, that happens a lot!  You see, he explains, they have
these billyclubs, so when the machine rips them off they beat on it
with the billyclubs.  Especially if they're having a bad day anyway.  
And, they're all kinda high-strung to begin with.
<p>
So I go back into the locker room to straighten things out, but I
can't fix the machine, because I don't happen to have a welding iron for one
thing, so I fill the soda machine, and empty what's left in the candy
machine neatly into a box, which I replenish and leave in the soda
machine so the repair guy can fill the candy machine when he's done
working on it.
<p>
While I'm doing this, one of the cops comes in, and we talk about it
a bit.  I'm thinking, of course, is this the one, or one of the ones
who did this?  I don't say anything like that, of course.  And I
don't tell him how surprised I was.  After all, my boss wasn't
surprised, so why should I be?
<p>
The cop gives me his theory of who done it, that it's those new guys they've
been hiring.  I see, I say, but I didn't see at all.
<p>
Moral:  Just because they're cops, doesn't mean they aren't <i>real</i> human.
<p>
<h3> This will lift you're heart... </h3>
<p>
I left the keyring in the bill changer at a handgun manufacturer one
day.  These guy's guns have been used to kill some of the finest people
that ever lived, some of my heros. Why?  Because they're so well made.  
Assasins the world over prefer them, and so do many law officials. 
<p>
You had to
walk through the entire shop floor several times to service the site. 
This was great fun because of all the delicate heavy machinery
used for making some of the world's finest firearms.  I'd go down different
aisles just to watch different machines. The machinery was always in 
full swing, drilling and shaving and stamping and cutting, and 
most of the machines had a constant flow of oil onto the
part being worked to cool it and carry away debris. 
<p>
<h3>Good people build good weapons</h3>
<p>
When I got to my next stop, which was way across town, I discovered that 
I had left the vending machine key ring somewhere.  I turned around and went back,
retracing my last steps, but when I walked in the back door everybody
seemed to know why I was there, and they directed me to the front
office. None of the money in the bill changer had been stolen.  They said
they had gotten hold of people at my office already, who had offered the 
guy a reward already, which was refused.  I spoke to my boss by
phone, and he told me to be sure to thank the guy personally.
They called him over so I could thank him, which I did.  And he wouldn't 
even accept a sandwich from me.  Finally, we settled on a cup of coffee 
and a handshake, and a smile.  
<p>
<h3>Ersatz Coinage</h3>
<p>
They shave pennies to the size of dimes.  They stamp out copper plate to
the size of quarters.  They drill holes and tie strings to the coins. 
I don't think any of them worked really well, because I never found a 
machine full of slugs and empty of candy.  I don't think the string thing 
ever really worked in modern coin hoppers.  And this was twenty years
ago.  Sooner or later, and it usually couldn't have taken long, the
string breaks. Using slugs is a federal offense.

<h3>I had to do something...</h3>
<p>
I was looking for a job because educational software is a tough way
to make a living, so this is one of the few job stories where it's
just a 9-to-5 job <i>after</i> I got into computers.  This job lasted
nine months, when I left it to move to California.
<p>
<b>Note:</b>
<br>
Since I operate a customer service desk of my own now, I need to mention
that if you ever don't get good service from us, it's not because we
didn't try.  Sometimes, the customer has to have patience, too.  Rome
wasn't built in a nanosecond.  This is a story about where I learned
to do customer service, and I hope you always feel you get good
service from my company, but if you don't, please: let us know what's
wrong. 
<p>
<hr>
<p>
Help Desks.  Customer Service.  Support Center.  Service Department.  
Call it whatever.  What it is is the last line of defense for the company. 
If the customer is unhappy when they leave our department, there
isn't much more the company can do to resolve the problem.  So in a
good company, Customer Service has a lot of priorities.  
<p>
The company I worked for was a good company.  They made a 4GL DBMS
(Fourth Generation Language  DataBase Management System)
which is used in hundreds of Fortune 500's and by many Government
agencies as well, including law enforcement and others.  I believe
it's still on the market, but the division was sold.
<p>
We really were the last line of defense, for both the customer as
well as the company.  Some of our customers used thousands of copies
of the program and had dozens of developers working with it.  They
had their own help desk staffed with knowledgable workers.  And some
of those workers had once worked at our support center.  When those
people couldn't solve the problem, they called us.  Our secretary
would take the call, determine the rough nature of it, and post it on
the cork bulletin board for us to take.  The secretary would tell the
caller approximately how long the return call would take to come, and
ask if that was all right.  If it wasn't, she would do something to
expedite the call, usually by finding an open person.
<p>
And like the Canadian Mounted Police, our creed was to <i>always
solve the problem</i>.  We hated it when we had to hand off a problem
to another service person.  No matter how long it took, no matter how
complex, we each had a personal goal never to pass on a problem to
someone else.  One problem, one support person.  Which is not to say
we couldn't go ask each other anything we wanted, but the service person 
the customer first contacts usually would provide them with the answer.
<p>
It's also not to say we wouldn't "cherry pick" the calls a little as they
came in and take the ones we knew the most about!  I had an
interesting group I would cherry-pick, but more on that later.  But
other than my group, we were discouraged from virtually all cherry 
picking because they wanted us to respond to the oldest calls
first--and NEVER leave a call unanswered for more than a half day
under any circumstances.
<p>
<h3> It's not what you know, it's who you know </h3>
<p>
Even though the customer often knew more about the program than we
did (after all, sometimes they had been programming with it for years) we
could still solve their problems.  Of course, the reason was, we had 
tools that the customer didn't have available
to them.  We could, for one thing, walk down the hall to the
developer's area, find the person who actually coded the thing (or is
responsible for that piece of code) and ask them what's going on. 
Sometimes they would have to go back and look at code, and sometimes,
they would have to fix the code!  
<p>
It was always kind of fun to go
back to the customer and tell them that they had initiated a change
in the code, because if you explain it to them right, they usually
feel vindicated and gratified and like they're part of a team.  
If you explain it wrong, they might
get angry that they had had to be the one to suffer through the
problem.  We never lied to the customer about anything, which I'm 
sure showed.  So if they had found a bug or a documentation error, 
we told them so, and a bug report would be generated and the 
next release of the software would have a fix for the problem.
<p>
Each employee had to start with about 10 days of training in New
York, and one afternoon each week was additional training and product news
summaries.  You learned how databases are organized, how to pick
keys, and how to maintain the system.  You learned to code using the
4GL DBMS the company had developed.  Highly technical stuff.
<p>
Then, one day, you take your first call.  You know you're boss is
listening in.  She told you she would probably listen to the first few
conversations so she could tell you what (if anything) you're doing wrong.
<p>
I don't remember that first call.
<p>
<h3> How to Win Friends and Influence Business </h3>
<p>
As I mentioned, I was a cherry picker, but no one minded.  My boss
didn't mind.  My coworkers loved me for it.
<p>
What happened was, one day we had a meeting about a relationship that
had nearly gone sour.  The customer was very upset for some reason or
other, and had brought one of our service personnel nearly to tears. 
The meeting was about what we should do when the secretary gets a
call from an irate customer, so that the service person has
some warning that there may be a problem.
<p>
It was decided that the secretary would not enter anything in the
database so as not to unfairly (or fairly) taint future contacts
with the person, but they would hand-write on the work sheet for the
event the phrase "IRATE CUSTOMER" so we would know that we should
handle this one quickly and with care.
<p>
The first time she did this, I guess I had already dealt with the
customer some months before and thought that they and I had gotten
along pretty well.  So I took that call.  Then the next time, it just
happened to be the top priority call and I had to take it.  Pretty
soon, I would fish through all the calls and take any IRATE
CUSTOMER calls!  And pretty soon after that, my coworkers realized
what I had been doing, and then the secretary started to simply pass
IRATE CUSTOMER calls on to me without bothering to post them on the 
cork board.
<p>
<h3> It's not that I'm cruel </h3>
<p>
I don't think I'm either a masochist or a sadist.  I just didn't take
it personally.  I wouldn't take their problems home with me, or even 
to lunch.  I didn't mind being yelled at.  When they were done screaming
and tearing their hair out over the phone, I'd simply tell them I'm
sorry that they are upset, and I would like to work with them until
we solve the problem, and I won't work on any other problems until
<i>they</i> are satisfied that the problem is solved.
<p>
<b> This usually calmed them down. </b>
<p>
Then I'd give them the fine print.  It doesn't mean I'll stay late
unless my boss approves the overtime.  It doesn't mean I'll try to
interrupt somebody else's meeting to try to get an answer from them. 
It doesn't mean I'll be able to answer <i>any</i> question right away--I
might have to study to get the answer.  
<p>
It just means it will be my highest priority task until it's
solved--is that sufficient, I'd ask, and I can never recall it not
being sufficient, at least to get the conversation going. 
<p>
I only recall two cases where the problem had to be escalated
to my boss, and one of those ended with the person apologizing (not
that I cared).  That was considered a pretty excellent track
record, and it really took the burden off the other employees.  
<p>
<h3> How to win friends, part 2 </h3>
<p>
Actually this part should go first chronologically.  The day I
started working, I had both elbows and both knees and my forehead
wrapped in bandages.  I had been to an Action Park with a
friend of mine and his girlfriend the day before I was to start work.  
<p>
Neither me nor my friend had ever ridden an Alpine Slide before,
but his girlfriend had and explained to us how to do it.
<p>
The Alpine Slide was a long (maybe a quarter of a mile, in this case) 
open tube you ride a little cart down.  The track is about the width of a
55 gallon drum , cut in half, but made of fiberglass and really
smooth with curved edges.  The curves are each heavily banked and
there's hay bales just in case you do go off.
<p>
The cart just has four little coaster wheels and a brake that pushes
against the slide to stop you.  It's a "dead man's brake" meaning you
have to hold it forward constantly, or it will swing back and stop
you.
<p>
How you do it, it's explained to us, is that first of all, when they
ask if you've ever done it before, you say yeah, sure, so they don't
put you on the beginner's slope, which is real shallow and straight. 
Second, when you sit down and wait for the signal to go, you take
your sweet time about getting into position.  Third, when they tell
you "GO" hold off until they're yelling at you.  Fourth, don't brake
for <i>anything</i>.  Go like blazes till you get to the bottom.
<p>
Well, she must have trained me well, because when I got to the first
big turn, I didn't brake.  Even after I fell off, and got fiberglass
burns on various extremities, I simply got back on and went hell-bent for
leather down to the next curve, which I also fell off and deepened
the old wounds and got several new ones.  My friend was behind me yelling "go
go go!" when I fell off the first time.  But the second time, he
wasn't anywhere to be found.  I coasted gently the rest of the way
down the ride, and when he got there, he was bleeding from his ear
and had deeper burns even than I did!  We decided to call it a day
and went back to the car and patched ourselves up and went home.  
<p>
The girl felt pretty bad too!
<p>
<h3>The Sympathy Vote</h3>
<p>
When you start a new job covered with bandages that need to be
changed every few hours, everybody notices you.  You have a nice
conversation starter, and everyone feels sorry for you.  I recommend
it if you want to make friends with your new coworkers.  However, it's
<b>not</b> a good idea to go in the <i>next</i> Monday with all the same
bandages, and crutches too.  Then they think you're accident-prone.  
<p>
I had gone to a nightclub with a friend, and it had started to rain.
The nightclub was located on a pier.  When I left, I didn't want to 
get the bandages wet, so I tried to run to the car.  You shouldn't
run on wet wood.  I slipped and fell and spent the next few weeks on
crutches with a sprained ankle.  Being accident-prone was a reputation 
I was unable to live down the rest of my days at that job.

<h3> Thousands of records, thousands of patients, one clerk... </h3>
<p>
It was the last job before I became a computer programmer.  I worked
alone on the night shift in the medical records department of one of 
the busiest hospitals in Connecticut, weekends plus one or two weekday 
nights each week, and went to computer school (and slept) weekdays. 
It lasted a few months, till I got my first computer job at a bank.
<p>
Medical records are the life history of the sick, the unfortunate,
the desperate.  They make great reading, if you have the stomach for
it, and the desire.  Of course, being written mostly by doctors,
for the most part they're totally unreadable.
<p>
The night shift basically had just three jobs. Our primary job 
was to pull records when the ER called for them.  And 
Fridays and Saturday nights, that could be just about all you did.
<p>
Then later, if you wanted to you could read what happened when the 
records came back.
<p>
The second job was to refile records that had been returned to the
records room.  This was usually handled by the day shift, so a lot of
nights there weren't any to be filed, or very few, or there was a
note telling us not to do it that night for some reason.
<p>
The third job was to pull records for shipment to a microfiche
company that would photograph them onto microfiche and return the 
'fiche' to us, and destroy the masters.  We had a list of names and
color codes to be pulled, and would pull them and put them aside and 
straighten them out, and put them in boxes.  Straightening meant 
attaching all the EKG strips to the metal tabs, 
putting all the xrays in the front pocket of the 
folder, and similar stuff.  I always worried that the records were
inaccessible for a while, but I was assured that if I had to, I could
call the microfiche company.   (These weren't for deceased people;
<i>those</i> records were pulled during the day and put in a
<i>different</i> box, if I recall correctly.)
<p>
Records were sometimes ordered "stat" which means <i>immediately</i>
which meant they wanted it ahead of anything else, even other records
unless they had also been called for "stat".  Sometimes the messenger
would arrive breathless, sometimes it would be a nurse (that was
always nice!)  I was never asked to take a record up myself.
<p>
Records were color-coded so that if you knew how to spell the
person's name, you could find it by color.  So when you got a call
for a record, you always made sure you had the spelling of the first
few letters of the last name and the first name.  Naturally, some
records were out of place.  Some were way out of place.  
And some were so big and pulled so frequently, that they 
were kept to the side of the shelf they belonged in.
<p>
<h3> Some Day This Stuff Will All Be Computerized... </h3>
<p>
One night, I got a call from a Doctor in Boston who had one of our
patients in front of him, and he told me she was behaving as though
she were having an appendicitis, but the scars on her belly indicated
that she had had operations where they usually take out the appendix
"as long as they're in there anyway."  (C-section, I think.)
<p>
He wanted me to find her record and tell him if she had had an
appendectomy along with a C-section at some time.
<p>
I took his phone number, repeated it, and told him I would call him
back within five minutes and probably a lot sooner.  The phone system
in the U.S. being virtually 100% reliable, that was longer than
either or us wanted to stay on hold.  He had a patient to get back to
and I had a record to find and scan.  I'd call him right back.
<p>
The record was about three inches thick.  I called the Doctor and
told him that, and asked him what he wanted me to do.  Should I call
down a nurse to read it to him?  No, he said, if I have the
time--which I did--would I just look through it and try to find anything 
having to do with an appendectomy or a C-section?
<p>
I started flipping through it and pronouncing phonetically the title
of the procedures, and pretty soon we found the section on the C-section.  
It was a
single-spaced document about a page and half long, which he asked me
to read to him.  Every fifth word was about 8 syllables long, but
after the first few lines it started to roll along, but it kept not
mentioning the appendix.  He was going to cut her open because I
couldn't find a reference to an appendix in a three inch thick record!
<p>
We hung up, and I spent the rest of the night carefully flipping 
through the document
page by page, looking for the half dozen medical terms he had
mentioned.  Then I wrote up the incident for the boss.  The next night, I
happened to see her when I came in, so I asked her if she had heard
anything, but she hadn't.  
<p>
I guess he found an appendix when he opened up 'our' patient.
<p>
<h3> A Common Cold? </h3>
<p>
How sick do you have to be to go to the emergency room of a hospital? 
Not as sick as you might think, if it's after hours.  Coughing fits,
a child's high temperature, a stomach ache.  Don't be so sure you
shouldn't go if you think you or someone you care about is sick.  A
lot of people think hospitals are for life or death emergencies only,
but you have the right to go if you need care <i>now</i>.  Don't worry, if
there's a 'real' emergency they'll let you languish in the hallway
till dawn.  I'm certainly not recommending you go in for a nick when
shaving.  Or anything else you can take care of yourself, or that can
wait.  But if you're worried, you <i>can</i> go.
<p>
One time (years later) I was touring the Everglades in one of those
shallow-bottom boats with the big fans on the back, and a bug flew in 
my eye (they have a lot of flying bugs in the Everglades).  We were
just docking, so I got in the car and left, but the eye swelled shut 
and turned beet red. This was about four hours before I had
a lecture to give.  I stopped and bought a gallon of water and
stood in the parking lot and poured it over my eye, and that helped,
but when I got to the city where I'd be lecturing, the eye was still
pretty messed up so I went to the emergency room of the nearest
hospital.  
<p>
A triage system is one where they take the patients most in need of
emergency service first, regardless of the order you come in.  But
who says who's how hurt?  The receptionist I think, sometimes!
<p>
I waited over two hours.  By then, the eye was actually looking 
pretty good, and it was seeing pretty well as well.  The doctor put some 
drops in it that 
opened up the cornea and turned the white part some other color 
(purple I think).  Then he studied it under a lens and pronounced me fit. 
He didn't know what kind of bug it was and didn't seem to care.  Not
being from the area, I was afraid I might have caught some deadly
parasite for which the only known cure was only found at a hospital.
He said I'd be fine.  As far as I can see, I am.
<p>
Most of us don't want to loose an eye, most of all.  We only get two
and the next step--total blindness.  Most of us, even mountain
bikers, would probably rather loose an arm than an eye, both arms
than both eyes.  So I thought two hours before the first doctor looked at me
was a long time for something called an 'ER'.  Maybe they were busy,
you say.  Yes, the 'meat wagon' <i>had</i> come in with a load while I was
there.  But no: I saw who else was going in and out, who else was waiting in
the waiting room next to me.  They didn't seem that sick!  One even
offered to let me go ahead of them--they weren't loosing an eye! 
I really think the receptionist just didn't like me. I guess next time 
I'll go to some other hospital. 
<p>
<h3> Juggling Responsibilities </h3>
<p>
Sometimes we had literally nothing to do at night in the medical records
office.  So I learned to juggle.  A
few years before someone had mentioned to me that the trick to
juggling three objects is to start with two in one hand and one in
the other, and throw one of the ones in the hand with two objects. 
Then throw the one in the other hand so you can catch the first
object, and that just keeps on happening.  I still juggle now and
then.  It's fun.
<p>
<h3> What room is in the basement of every hospital? </h3>
<p>
We were located in the basement of the hospital.  Another room is
commonly in the basement too.
<p>
To get to where the vending machines were from the medical records
office, you had to pass the morgue. 
One day soon after I started working there, I was walking over to get a 
snack and I saw the sign on the door. It was a simple sign like every 
other sign.  It simply said "morgue".  It was right near an expansion 
joint in the floor of the corridor.  I started
thinking about it, and there just wasn't any other way to get to the
vending machines.  And you just <i>had to</i> walk around and get
something once in a while or you'd go nuts!  No matter what food you
put in your lunch bag, you wanted something else, something only a machine
could deliver.  You weren't allowed to stay at in the food room to
eat, because you worked alone and might be needed, but it was
expected that you would go get something to eat or drink and bring it
back now and then.
<p>
Working nights in the basement I usually never saw anyone except the 
messenger that took the records upstairs.  But one day, 
finally, it happened.  Two attendents were wheeling in someone under a sheet,
someone who had been fairly rotund.  When the rollers hit the
expansion joint, the sheet wiggled.  I continued on to the vending machines,
stared at them for a few moments, and just went back to work.
<p>
<h3> Nosocomial is Not So Comical </h3>
<p>
One day our boss came back from a conference and had a pin that said
NOSOCOMIAL IS NOT SO COMICAL, which she attached to something in her office.  
Nosocomial diseases are diseases spread through hospitals themselves, from
patient to patient.  I had to look it up, of course, but there were
lots of places to do that!
<p>
Hospitals are dangerous places.  People die there.  People go in with
one thing and die of another.  Hospital workers have increased risks 
of just about everything that can be caught.
<p>
<h3> It's All Attitude... </h3>
<p>
They hired another guy, and apparently some of the other people
didn't like him, but I told our boss he was a good worker.  He
explained to me one night, that the hose attached to the faucet in
the janitor's closet was illegal and dangerous.  If water gets left
in the sink, the hose could suck up dirty fluids into the clean water
system if pressure changes occur when the tap is open.  And once in
the system, they can be devastating, and very hard to clean out.
<p>
I told our boss he was a conscientious worker.  She kept him, as far
as I know.
<p>
In January, 1997 I received an email from a high school student
asking for more information about the job of Medical Records Clerk.

By Russell D. Hoffman.  Copyright (c) 1996 by Russell D. Hoffman.
<p>
<hr>
<p>
Almost anyone who's had 40+ jobs can tell you:  Sometimes you get
fired.  One wrong move.  One careless word the week before, and
Monday morning, you're gone.  One worried owner...  
<p>
<h3>I Hope--Or Pray...</h3>
<p>
The first time I was fired was pretty upsetting.  
I was working as a dishwasher in the local shop of a chain of
breakfast restaurants which I hope--or pray will remain nameless in Westport, Connecticut.  
<p>
I was accused of stealing tips.  A few days before, one of the
waitresses had claimed to have lost about $13.00 in tips that she had
left on the counter near my station.  I searched the Dempster
Dumpster for about ten minutes looking for it for her.  I was <i>such</i>
a nice guy!  Turns out though, I doubt she ever lost it...
<p>
A day or so later, I'm out busing tables, and there is a dollar
bill tip on the table, but when I'm finished cleaning off the table, the tip's
gone!  Now normally, of course, the busboy busses the table and leaves the tip 
for the waitress.  (And often, waitresses give a percentage of their
tips to the busboys at the end of the day.  In some restaurants it's
mandatory that they do that, maybe 5% or something.  I think that's
how this place worked it.)
<p>
Evidently I had accidentally picked up the tip along with the dirty 
dishes, and afterwards I poked around the busbucket for it, 
but decided either it was deep in the busbucket somewhere, or (more
likely, I thought) it never existed and I hadn't seen it to begin with. 
I figured I'd do what we always do when this happens--tell the
dishwasher who's emptying the buckets, and return the bill to the
appropriate waitress.  Sometimes they find money we never see. 
People like to hide it, I guess from other customers.  Sometimes
nobody finds it!  Have you ever seen laundered money, laundered by a
commercial dishwasher?  It's very clean!
<p>
I fill the bucket busing other tables, and go back to the dishwasher 
station to leave the bucket and get an empty one, and the owner and a 
manager and a waitress or two
are standing around saying they've been watching me, and they put
that dollar on that table to test me.  I instantly realize, of course, 
that there had indeed been a dollar on that table and I tell them
that, and that I know that dollar is somewhere deep in the bucket,
since that was the first table I had bussed and the bucket was now
full, and since I don't empty the buckets, I obviously wasn't
stealing. (Esp. since the dishwasher was a family friend of the owner...)
They say if it isn't in that bucket I'm fired.  
<p>
<h3>Can I get a Witness?</h3>
<p>
I leave to go bus more tables.  I don't wait around to watch them
find the buck in the bucket.  <!-- (People have asked me why; I don't
know, I guess I had a bad feeling about it.) --> When I get back,
they're all standing around, and the guy says I'm fired, wait 
here while he goes and makes out my severence pay.  
I say why, didn't you find the dollar?  He says they did, but it was
"crumbled up in a corner"  which for some reason, apparently means 
I was stealing it.
<p>
I couldn't understand this.  Hadn't I struggled to help that waitress
find her money last week?  Hadn't I always washed the dishes well,
never been late, always been friendly?  Another guy that worked there 
threatened to quit when he heard, if they wouldn't hire me back. 
He stood up for me.  They told him go ahead and quit.  He did.
<p>
I couldn't understand it, until a few years later when I was
talking about it to my grandfather Nelson Cruikshank.  He asked just one
question.  "Did you ever mention a union while you worked there?"
<p>
Yes, I said.  There were a couple of boys working there who had talked about
that.  It had kind of surprised me because one of them was a
friend of the owner.  I had agreed with them.  The place
treated the dishwashers (getting $1.80 an hour) pretty bad.
<p>
Moral:  Don't <i>ever</i> mention a union in a non-union shop unless you want to
loose your job and have your name slandered.

<h1> The Best Job in the World! </h1>
<h2> Hard to believe, isn't it? </h2>
<h3> Another in a series on work called <a href="/misc/stories/jobs/jobworld.htm">THE REAL WORLD</a></h3>

<p>
<hr>
<p>
<h3> What do YOU want to be when you grow up? </h3>
<p>
When I was a kid, I wanted to be a "dump truck driver" and move heavy
loads of dirt from hither to yon (or back).  I didn't know that the
guy operating the steamshovel got a lot more money--heck, I didn't
even know you could get paid for doing stuff at all!
<p>
The best job I ever had -- and I've had lots -- was a forklift operator in a box factory. 
I needed a job pretty badly.  Working at my uncle's factory, I had
operated several different types of hi-lo's, otherwise known as
forklifts.  
<p>
We had one really neat one at my uncle's factory, which instead of a 
steering wheel had a crank type
of thing you'd turn about 8 times from lock to lock, and you had to
stand on the back platform to operate it.  It was huge and could lift
a ton.  We had a smaller one with three wheels, so I knew how to
manuever the forklift around and operate the forks.
<p>
Box factories are unique because it doesn't really matter
what you do.  It's not like a normal forklift job where you have to
be really careful and delicate.  There are actually contests for forklift
operators, and "the best in the biz" actually travel around to move
really expensive stuff, and get paid <b>really well</b>.
<p>
<h3> I wasn't one of those... </h3>
<p>
I go the job as a fork lift operator in a box factory, partly
because I had a Class 1 (tractor trailer) license in case they needed
anyone else on the road.  I had no road experience, but at least I
had the license.  I didn't drive much for them,
about 300 miles altogether.  
<p>
Moving bundles of cardboard boxes is a great job.  Each bundle is not
less than about a cubic yard, and seldom more than three cubic
yards.  You can pile them, push them, tumble them, drop them...
Whatever you need to do.  They're virtually indestructible.  No
smoking near them, that's the only thing.  Go kill yourself in the
parking lot.  I don't smoke.
<p>
The outer boxes are really just there to hold the
inner boxes.  If a few get their edges torn up or get crushed, it's
no big deal.  The company always runs an overage of 5 to 10 percent,
and that's <i>your overage</i> if you need it.
<p>
I walk into the place to apply for the job, and there are
rows and rows of flat cardboard waiting to be cut, folded, and
glued into cardboard boxes.  You know the ones: They say "Made by So
and So and Crew" and "Test 75 lbs" in a little round stamp somewhere
on the bottom of each one.  Shipping regulations require that stamp.
<p>
The test to get the job was the best part.  Seems the last guy tended
to leave the place a mess, and if his piles fell over, well, he'ed
get to them some day.  So they bring me to the forklift, show me its
particular controls, and tell me to straighten out "that pile over
there".  It took about two hours.
<p>
<h3> Boxes piled as high as a three story building... </h3>
<p>
There were about 40 bundles and they looked like a tornado had tossed
them about.  They were supposed to be four or five bundles tall and 
about a dozen deep, but these were all topsy-turvy.  It's a lot like 
a game of pick-up sticks, because you have to extract each bundle and
place it neatly in a new row, until the entire pile is moved.  And
you can't just pull out the bottom one of course, that would be like
taking the bottom can in a grocery store display--they would all come
tumbling down on top of you.  So sometimes you have to get out of the
machine and climb up, twenty, thirty feet, where your head is in the
rafters, and kick and push and sweat the boxes to a position where
you can get at them with the forks of the forklift.  
<p>
<b>This is fun.</b>
<p>
The only thing wrong with the job is all the dust you have to breath.  
Some of us wore masks, some wore hankerchiefs, most of us were too stupid to
bother.  And no matter what you did, you got this horrible black gunk
all inside your nose and your throat that you kept coughing up and 
spitting out.   (This got a lot worse when the company bought a paper
shredder to cut up the waste cardboard.)
<p>
But aside from that, it was a great job.  You unload trailers, stack
the bundles of flat cardboard, feed the bundles to the various machines 
as they need them and take off the
finished bundles of boxes.  You're number one priority is to keep the
machines running.  They give you a short list of what they'll need
next and you
have to find it and bring it over one or two bundles at a time, and
unload at the other end as the finished bundles of boxes are
produced.  You serve three or four box machines, each operated by
one or a couple of people.  The machines <i>must</i> be kept running!  
<p>
You also take care of any incoming material from the company that makes 
the flat sheets of cardboard.  Sometimes they leave the trailer, other
times you just quickly unload it and place it into storage later. You
also load your own outgoing trailers.  We had two trailers and one
tractor, so you would load one while the other was out making deliveries. 
<p>
Occasionally, you're asked to move something odd, like a new piece of
machinery or something else heavy.  This is about the only time you
had to be delicate.  Which is not to say you didn't have to be
accurate.  You would often have to be accurate. You always carried a
tape measure and you would measure a space, and decide that 1/4 inch on
either side of a ten foot space was enough to squeeze a new bundle in
place.  Sometimes, you would straighten out a bundle by turning the
forklift around and pushing the bundle into a wall with the flat back of the
forklift, so you could then squeeze the bundle into a tight spot. 
<p>
With most forklift jobs, you're
like a bull in a china shop, but at a box factory, it's more like a
bull in a padded cell.  A bull balancing big brown bundles of boxes.
<p>
Fork lifts are cool machines.  They have incredibly accurate
hydraulic controls so that you can move the tips of the forks small
fractions of an inch.  The forks at box factories are filed down so
that they are actually sharp, so you can scoop under the bundle.  
Each bundle is wrapped in two nylon straps, and you have to scoop in
the direction of the straps, or you'll catch one and break it.  Break
two, and the bundle falls apart for sure, break one and it's just a
bit fragile.
<p>
The forks are so sharp, you have to <i>always</i> lower
them to the ground when you leave the machine.  If anyone walks into
them they can be seriously hurt.  (You should do this with any forklift, but
with box factory forks it's vital.)
<p>
Full propane tanks are pretty heavy, about as much as a quarter keg.  
You have to heave a new one up to the truck about 6 or 8 times a week.  
That's about the only maintenance the driver has to do.  Forklifts are extremely 
reliable vehicles.  Turn it on, raise the forks a little, go to where you're
needed, get to work.  
<p>
The forks can be raised and lowered, and the whole fork assembly can
be tilted foward and back about 10 degrees, all with hydraulic
hand controls.
<p>
You don't want to raise the forks too much when
you drive around empty because someone could walk into it, but you don't 
want to have them too low either, because you mustn't catch them on 
anything, like an uneven floor.  That could be disasterous as well, 
since you could flip the forklift and maybe in the process, get caught 
under it.  More likely, it would just stop real suddenly and you'd go
flying foward and hit some immovable part of the machine.  Forklifts
are made with all thick steel plates so they're extremely heavy. 
<p>
Three or four inches off the ground is the normal travel position.
It's a compromise solution.  
<p>
When you're moving a bundle, you don't want the bundle too high off
the ground, because it gets very tipsy the higher it is.  This can be
a problem when you're moving a bundle that's ten feet wide, three
feet high, three feet deep, and stacked two tall, and you have to get it 
over some piles that are themselves ten feet off the ground--you've got
hundreds of pounds teetering on these two arms.  When you see a load
start to fall, as happens sooner or later, you have to immediately
slam the hydraulic control valves all the way to try to lower the load.  
That way, it lands softer, and sometimes you can stop the fall completely.
Usually you'll try to tip the load back as well.
<p>
The arms can be moved apart or closer together.  You want them close
together so you can manuever around the factory floor, but you want
them far apart so the loads balance better.  You usually end up
getting out and moving them back and forth all day.  Some forklifts
have hydraulic systems to spread the forks.  Most don't.  Ours didn't.
<p>
Another thing you have to do in a box factory that other fork lift
operators never do is, you have to scoop up loads by getting a
running start, lowering the forks to where the tips are just touching
the ground, and driving forward as fast as the vehicle will go (which
isn't very fast) so you can get under the load before it (the load) 
gains momentum and slides away.  You pick it up at the same time, 
and lean the fork assembly back towards you to hold onto the load.  
It usually works.  Sometimes you just push it along in front of you.
<p>
One time, I scooped up a load--it moved back a couple of feet, but I
got it--and one of my coworkers came out from behind it, having had
his life pass before his eyes on the way back from the men's room!  
You have to look for that sort of thing of course, 
but somehow I missed him.  Somehow, he missed me, too.  Rules are,
for the forklift operator, don't put someone else in harm's way, of course.  
And for everyone else, stay well away from the forklift and its bundles.  
I had been operating 
in that area but somehow, like a near-miss between airplanes, 
we just didn't get it together. Next day, they had the
mechanic build a little iron wall so that there was a stop that the
bundles would go up against.  Now I just had to be sure not to bang
the forks into the stop.
<p>
The "roach mobile" would come by twice a day, once for breakfast and
once for lunch.  The breakfast guy couldn't count.  He would give people
the wrong change all the time, and I found a ten-spot on the pavement
after he left once.  He served the best muffins, though.  I haven't had 
a good bran muffin since that bakery shut down rather than let the workers 
unionize.  It's been nearly twenty years.
<p>
I used to think about the other jobs at the factory.  Here I was,
playing with big toy blocks all day, and there they were, my friends and
coworkers, hand-feeding the flats onto the box-making machines and adding 
ink, changing dies, filling out forms, all this stuff that's 
<i>real work</i>.  And me having all that fun and getting paid
pretty well, too.

<h1> Review by Russell D. Hoffman of film Fly Away Home</h1>
<br>
<h3>From Sony Pictures Entertainment</h3>
<br>
<h5>Reviewed September 30th, 1996</h5>
<br>
<h4>Review by Russell D. Hoffman with notes about his childhood
experiences regarding imprinting</h4>
<br>
<h5>Copyright (c) 1996 by Russell D. Hoffman.</h5>
<p>
Fly Away Home is about a young girl (played by Anna Paquin) who imprints 
some lost goslings (young Canadian Geese) to her.  
<a href="/family/howardsh/imprint.htm">Imprinting</a> is a behavioral 
process, and usually the first thing 
a gosling sees is it's mother, and that's what they become imprinted
to.  These goslings become imprinted to the young girl.  She raises them, 
and then learns to fly an ultralight airplane so that she can 
fly south with the birds when they get old enough, because otherwise
they won't leave the farmlands.  She flys from Canada to North Carolina, 
USA to teach the birds the route to a winter nesting place.  
<p> 
Her father is fully supportive of the endeavor and she gets a lot of
other help along the way.  It's a story about making dreams come
true, and about stubbornly refusing to quit.  It's a story about bonding, not
just for the goslings but for just about everyone this charming young
actress comes in contact with in the movie.  Not everyone, but just
about everyone.
<p>
The photographs of the birds in flight are stunning.  
The soundtrack is unobtrusive yet moving, and it includes some real 
power hitters in the music business.  
<p>
Although FLY AWAY HOME is clearly for children, it is interesting for
adults as well.  There are even a few jokes just for the adults, but
nothing the children can't hear, they just won't get them.
<p>
Very few scenes are wasted as various aspects of the
story are covered, from the techniques needed to cojole the birds 
into the air, to the politics of land use.  I do wish 
they had explained a little about what it means to 'stall' an
airplane, especially at low altitude.  
<p>
Before I finish reviewing this film, let me give you my background.
<p>
It's not often you get to see a film that is so personal.  I remember
as a youth, going to visit my father's lab.  
It was the 60's and 70's.  My father was at that time
a professor at Penn State University.  (Then at Bryn Mawr College.)  
He did research on Imprinting, using ducklings, which are little
furballs (actually featherballs) very similar to goslings.  He trained 
them to peck a button so they could see an object they had 
been imprinted to shortly after hatching.
He had a big old converted house on campus for a lab, and he had lots of
grad students and walls and walls of equipment.  
<p>
I know now that those were basically hard-wired computers.  They
consisted of rack upon rack of counters, relays, printers, timers,
and other components, all connected together by a huge rat's nest of
wires on the back.  
<p>
<h3>A most amazing sound...</h3>
All the equipment made one of the most beautiful and amazing
noises I've ever heard.  In fact, the only more beautiful sound that
I can think of is one time when I saw--and heard--a busboy try to take
a double-stacked tray full of 'tumblers' down a flight a stairs, and dropped
them all right at the topmost stair.  Such a complex, crystal
noise!  It went on and on as the tumblers tumbled down
the flight of stairs.  He must of broke all 60 or 75 or so of them!
<p>
Clickety-Clickety-Clickety-Clickety does not
<i>begin</i> to describe the noise from my father's lab!  
It was click upon click upon click all
happening all at once and at a million different other times, in a
cacaphony so loud that you could hear it coming down from the third
floor as you approached the building.  Not a roar, as no
individual click was particularly loud,  but a constant yet irregular
background noise that demanded one's attention yet filled the
background perfectly.  When only one duckling was being run, which
sometimes happened, the noise became an occasional and irregular set of
clicks, and you could tell exactly when the duckling was pressing the
button.
<p>
It was a beautiful noise.  It always meant there were ducklings tapping on
buttons in soundproof rooms right next to the racks and rat's nests of
wires.  If you came in and the lab room was silent, you knew the grad
students were almost always busy either fixing something or building a 
new experiment.  In either case, they were busy.  When the noise was 
there, they were usually just monitoring the experiments and you could 
distract them more, which of course is what a ten-year-old wants to do.
<p>
The soundproof rooms were connected to the electronics lab room by thick 
wads of cables, through a small cutout in the walls.  
<p>
Inside the soundproof rooms, mini sound-proofed cages each held usually 
one duckling, though occasionally they experimented with multiple ducklings.
They monitored the ducklings with remote T.V. cameras and some very devoted 
graduate students with lots of coffee.
<p>
There was, on a lower floor, a roomful of ducklings who were not
being experimented on, and of course, it contained a hatchery.  
<p>
Needless to say, visiting my Dad's lab was a highlight of my youth. 
It was a charming place for a ten year old and knowing this whole 
thing was designed, built and run by my Dad made me think he was just 
about the most important person in the world.  He did not harm the 
ducklings in any way that I could see, nor can I think of any
significant way now.  It was just good science.  When the ducklings matured
beyond their usefulness in the experiment they were given to a farm.
Hopefully they had good memories of simply clicking a button every 
time they wanted to see their "mother". 
<p>
<h3>Their mother was a milk bottle</h3>
<p>
Usually the bottle was mounted on an
HO-guage model train engine on a short length of track (about two 
yard's (2 meter's) worth.)  The duckling would press the button, and a light would
illuminate the milk bottle and move it back and forth for a few
seconds.  Sometimes the button would only work intermittently.  Sometimes the
train would run for shorter or longer or intermittant lengths of
times.  Sometimes the bird did not have to press the button to see it, 
the milk bottle would just appear at 'random' times.
<p>
And those birds loved those milk bottles.  They would chase that thing 
back and forth along the screen which separated them from it (for
their safety), they would peep (a known sign of distress in most baby
birds) when 'denied' the chance to view the milk bottle.  Efforts
were made to make the milk bottle look like a duck, but it didn't
seem to matter to the ducklings and it was a lot easier just to use
the milk bottles.
<p>
Exactly how often, and to what degree, the ducklings would 'respond' to the
'stimulus'--well, that's what the science was all about.  
Social bonding and imprinting are powerful phenomena.
(If you are interested in learning more about this
fascinating science, then I suggest you get a copy of my father's
book, cited below.)
<p>
<h3>See The Movie</h3>
<p>
<p>
<b>Fly Away Home</b> is based on real science, and is also based on a
real event, although there were significant changes made for the sake
of the story.  It's not presented as being exactly what happened, but
it does present the science factually.  For this, my father and I are
grateful.  
<p>
<h3>I'm NOT saying I cried at this Movie</h3>
<p>
It's so nice to see a well-written, educational movie which is also
entertaining and memorable.  To have it be about what my dad did
for a large portion of his career got me all choked up. 
<p>
On September 30th, 1996 I predict:  Two+ Oscars!  
<p>
<ul>
<li> Best Screenplay
<li> Best Actress (Again for this talented young girl)
</ul>
<p>
The soundtrack is potential Oscar material as well.
I predicted the Best Screenplay for Independence Day as
well, and "I can't both be right"!  And of course, they (The Academy Awards people) don't ask me.  And they
don't often agree with who I think should get an award (do they agree
with you much?).  But maybe this time, I'll get lucky.  <b>FLY AWAY
HOME</b> is a <i>great</i> film, and should be recognized as such.

<h2> Review by Russell D. Hoffman of Hong Kong Kung Fu action film Rumble in the Bronx starring Jackie Chan</h2>
<br>
Released on Home Video Rental Summer 1996 by <b>New Line Cinema</b>.  91 minutes.
<br>
<h4>Review by Russell D. Hoffman</h4>
<br>
<h5>Copyright (c) 1996 by Russell D. Hoffman.</h5>
<p>
If Jackie Chan hadn't been given a special lifetime achievment Oscar 
recently just for being Jackie Chan, a lot of people would dismiss him 
as 'just another' karate star, whatever that is.  You probably think
either that you like Kung Fu and Karate movies or that you don't.
<p>
But if you think you are the type that
doesn't, I suggest you break with tradition and give <b>Rumble in the
Bronx</b> a try.  Yes, it's violent.  It's bloody.  It's rough.  
And the plot is as full of holes as the bodies.  But it's also 
hilarious, and it's an emotional roller coaster.  It's coherent, it's full
of proper moral solutions to complex situations, and in many way's
it's--unfortunately--very real.  It's fast-paced too.
<p>
It's interesting that so many of our best movie action heros <i>have
to</i> have a sense of humor.  If Schwarzenegger's "I'll be back" or
"Hasta la vista, baby" lines don't elicit laughs, they are in 
<b>big trouble</b>.  But they do, so the movies <i>are</i> funny, and the 
special effects are great, and good triumphs over evil, and we enjoy 
the movies time and again.
<p>
Jackie Chan movies don't have much in the way of special effects. 
A good special effect in one of his films might be rolling a pickup 
truck chock full of plastic balls off a four-story building.  It's a
<i>really</i> good effect, though!  Blows away watching <i>yet
another</i> TV get thrown off the balcony, let me tell you!  It's an
image you'll treasure the rest of your life.  And it didn't require
computer-generated Harriers.
<p>
Jackie Chan movies are <i>funny</i>.  Especially the fights.  The
tricks this man pulls out of nowhere to defend or escape are
<i>bizzare</i>. 
Yet everything works.  He doesn't need trick photography--he uses
real tricks.  The better the camera picks up what he really does, the
more amazed the audience is.  Jackie pulls out all the stops.  
He will climb anywhere, jump anywhere, throw anything, and use anything 
as a shield or a weapon or a tool.  He's the Rube Goldberg of karate.
<p>
And the most amazing thing is, of course, that after some twenty
years in the business, he still <i>does all his own stunts</i>.  So
here's this 'old' man doing backflips, jumping across buildings, and
beating up everyone that tries to harm him or anyone else in his
presence.  He'll out-psych you if that will work.  Then he'll
out-punch you, out-crunch you, and out-munch you to a pulp--but
always just barely.  Unless you've been really bad, he just hurts you
enough to change your behavior pattern to one of non-aggression.  And
in the process, he often gets hurt nearly as much himself!
<p>
If you enjoy acrobatics, you'll enjoy <b>Rumble</b>.  In one scene,
Jackie is cornered by a gang coming at him on one side, two walls, 
and a chain-link fence that is at least 10 or 12 feet high.  
He runs full speed up to the corner where the fence meets one of the walls, 
takes first one step high up on the fence, then one
even higher on the wall, <i>then another step on the fence</i>, one 
more on the wall, and grabs the top of the fence and flings himself over. 
It's a scene you'll want to replay several times.  But you
probably won't, because it's about the 20th incredible stunt you've seen so far
in the movie.  
<p>
Jackie Chan is creative.  He's the Picasso of action flicks.  And
he's humble.  He's the Mother Teresa of Kung Fu superheros.  And
he's the modern era's answer to Buster Keaton and Jerry Lewis.  
<p>
I must say a word about the violence, both as a warning and as social
comment.  Don't bring your kids to Jackie Chan films till they've
seen their first 10,000 homicides on T.V.  (which they will do 
long before they reach puberty in a typical American
household).  Some of the violence is definitely hard to stomach. 
<p>
Jackie is okay, of course, but the villians do some pretty wicked and
wretched things.  After all, they have to be badder than Jackie, and he can
kill, maim, and disable in just about every manner possible.  Most of
the time, Jackie gets hurt as badly as anybody, until he wins over the hearts,
the minds, and/or the muscles of his opponents.  
<p>
Be sure to watch through the credits for the
outtakes and completions of scenes.  Jackie Chan is awesome, 
but when you see these, you'll find out that's he's still 
quite human.  These may be the most gut-wrenching scenes in the whole movie.

<h1> Review by Russell D. Hoffman of science fiction film Independence Day</h1>
<br>
<h5>Reviewed July 5th, 1996 after seeing the movie opening night, on the Big Screen at the SoCal theatre south of 78 at El Camino Real in Carlsbad, CA</h5>
<br>
<h4>Review by Russell D. Hoffman</h4>
<br>
<h5>Copyright (c) 1996 by Russell D. Hoffman.</h5>
<p>
As of July 4th, 1996, I predict:  Five+ Oscars!  <!-- See it before anyone can tell you what happens! (This review does NOT do that!) -->
<p>
Okay, you've clicked here.  It wouldn't be fair not to start by
telling you <i>which</i> five Oscars.
<p>
<ul>
<li> Best Special Effects (that one's a no-brainer)
<li> Best Screenplay  
<li> Best Supporting Actor 
<li> Best Movie
<li> Best Director
</ul>
<p>
Of course, they (The Academy Awards people) don't ask me.  And they
don't often agree with who I think should get an award (do they agree
with you much?).  But maybe this time, I'll get lucky.  <b>ID4</b> is
a <i>great</i> film, and should be recognized as such. It's
unpredictable.  It's subtle.  It's a tour-de-force.  It's
thought-provoking.  It's even funny.
<p>
There are two kinds of people in the world: those who believe in 
aliens and those who don't.  I don't.  I think it's <i>possible</i> that
there is life out there somewhere, I just think it's extremely
unlikely.  But if in fact there is life, I think it's incredibly 
less likely still that it will have evolved into intelligent 
lifeforms (after all, look at the competition!)  And if it does
evolve into intelligent and mobile life, it would then still be extremely
unlikely that it would travel 60 billion light years and end up here. 
Not when Dominos Delivers, like their ad's say!
<p>
And I really doubt the United States has any alien bodies in deep freezes
anywhere.  
<p>
But forget all that.  It doesn't matter.  See this movie.
<p>
To watch a science fiction movie, you usually have to dump
some firm scientific belief which you rely on.  Sometimes it's <i>travel faster than light speed</i>,
or <i>time travel</i>, or <i>transporter rooms</i>, or <i>changing
size significantly</i>, or egads, <i>the force</i>.  (Personally, I believe 
in Duct Tape as the unifying force that holds the universe together. 
But I digress.)
<p>
At least in the case of aliens, I'd never deny that it's
possible.  It just is extremely unlikely. But it's certainly
possible.
<p>
But just in case there <i>are</i> aliens, I've spent <b>my entire life</b> telling
anyone who would listen that we as human beings--and masters of our
planet--should <b>not</b> want to meet aliens!
<p>
The only race of "intelligent" beings we've ever known enslaves every
other creature on it's planet, eats whichever other creatures it wants
to (sometimes live) no matter how intelligent or kind the other creature 
appears to be, it ravages it's planet's resources and poisons it's planet's 
natural, original cleanliness.  
<p>
It fights terrible wars amongst itself and enslaves, tortures, and
executes it's own kind.  
<p>
So if the one 'intelligent' lifeform we've ever known does all these
things, why on earth (or anywhere else) would we want to meet
another?
<p>
When the space probe that recently left the solar system was launched,
it included a
very detailed map to earth's location in the universe, as best we
could describe it in pictures and such.  I have contended since that day
long, long ago, that that was a mistake.  We should have, at the very
least, tried to fool whoever finds the plaque and tell them we were on
Pluto, or maybe even some nearby star.  That way, maybe we'ed get the
jump on them if they come looking.  Seems to me that if we are barely
capable of leaving our own solar system, let alone our galaxy, the last
thing we want is some lifeform that can scoot around the universe at 
will to find us and want our cool wonderful world.
<p>
Of course, no one listened and the probe went off with descriptions of
what our genetic composition was, our exact location, our major math and
language systems, and more.  Smooth move guys.  No wonder someone's
coming from 60 billion lightyears away.  We're in deep, deep trouble
now!
<p>
<b>ID4</b> is about what happens when "they" get here.  It's
well thought out and extremely well done.  This is a movie that, to
me, defines and classifies a genre of film through the end of the
second millennium.  The science fiction film has reached a climax
it will not soon top.  I rate <b>ID4</b> as the #1 film of all time.

This book will be of special interest to persons who have
seen the new movie:  FLY AWAY HOME.  The movie, based on real
events, tells of how a young girl and her father raise a number of
abandoned goslings and then, using an ultralight airplane, lead
them on their initial migration flight south. In telling its
compelling story FLY AWAY HOME demonstrates the powerful and
lasting effects of the social bond generated by the behavioral
process called "<a href="/family/howardsh/imprint.htm">IMPRINTING</a>". 
<p>
Wouldn't it be interesting to
understand how imprinting takes place and to discover the role
that imprinting has been found to play in our own lives?  By
describing the high points of his 15 years of research into
imprinting (the work was continuously supported by THE NATIONAL
INSTITUTE OF HEALTH), Hoffman explains how imprinting works 
and what this means for how we deal with our children and 
with each other. He also provides the reader with a first
hand account of the real experience of doing research.
<p>
      Under normal circumstances the first animate object that a
newly hatched gosling sees is its mother.  Under some
circumstances, however, a bird may encounter a person or some
other animate object. When this happens the bird will, if
conditions are right, become bonded to, or imprinted on, that
person or object. 
<p>
     In Hoffman's research the subjects were newly hatched
ducklings rather than goslings and rather than imprinting his
birds on himself, he imprinted them on a plastic milk bottle
mounted over the engine of a toy electric train. He then taught
his ducklings to peck at a button in order to get to see the
bottle. His book: <b>Amorous Turkeys and Addicted Ducklings</b> provides
an account of what his ducklings did in the various experiments
that Hoffman and his students arranged for them. 
<p>
By describing
the results of these experiments and relating them to the results
of studies in other laboratories, Hoffman makes it clear that the
imprinting process is not only basic to the lives of ducks and
geese, but that it operates in much the same fashion with many
other animals, including humans.

<hr>
The Animated Software Company has <i>repeatedly</i> been told that we 
have the <b>smoothest</b> animation in the industry.  Yet, we believe we've 
only scratched the surface of what could be done! 
<p>
Probably the first time we heard this comment was in about 1982 when 
we designed graphics for small computer firms in Connecticut.  
This was before the IBM-PC had been released, and the programs were 
written in some form of BASIC.  The big breakthrough that allowed 
animation on computer was <b>bitmapped screens</b>, because before that, 
character-based animation was all that was possible, which usually 
looked awful and was cruel to the programmer who worked with it. 
<p>
Our first paid animation job on IBM PC's and compatibles was actually  
for IBM Product Centers, (which no longer exist), along with Bloomingdales' department stores in 
1984.  It was for a Christmas promotion and what I remember most 
about that job was that one of the things I had to do was draw 
woman's pan.ties, for the linger.ie department.  (No, not with a 
live model.) I knew this was the start of something really 
fantastic, and that is <i>the last time I've drawn anything like 
that!</i>  Oh well, it's still been fun! 
<p>
Our second paid DOS project also started in 1984 but has yet to be 
completed.  We were commissioned to produce the first in a line of 
educational tutorials called THE HUMAN BODY SERIES.  We began with THE ENGINE OF LIFE, about the human heart. 
<p>
Now, 10 years after that product was first released, it is still 
available and still highly praised, and upgraded to SVGA screen mode, 
with other improvements along the way.  However, the high degree of 
interactivity which author John Keenan designed and Russell Hoffman 
programmed has kept this product in use in the "highly volatile"  
educational software market for <i>over a decade</i>.  One product!  
<p>
Mr. Hoffman now has numerous animation projects under his belt, including writing laser 
control software.  One application was a concert at 
Art Park near Niagara Falls.  The Art Park concert was conducted by 
the famous Eric Kuentsel and was performed by the Buffalo Philharmonic 
Orchestra.  Our lasers showed galloping horses, R2D2, a flying 
Bald Eagle, and about a dozen other images, most of them animated.  
It was great fun being right on stage (unseen behind a low wall) during the 
performance of the 1812 Overture, with "real" bombs going off on stage all around 
us!  The whole trip was one unforgettable experience after another... 
<p>
But I digress... 
<p>
Animated laser motion requires <i>extremely</i> accurate timing controls as well as interactive controls for the presenter.  
Only minor modifications to the "P11" framework needed to be done, 
which sent the X-Y signal directly to the D-A converters, which then 
sent the analog version of the signal to the stepper motor laser mirror controls.  
(It should be noted that the manufacturer of the laser mirror 
controllers was actually the star performer: it was the accuracy of his mirrors 
that made the animation signals work!)
<p>
Other projects along the way include an animated lesson for a 
non-profit group called Global Energy Network International, a demo 
logo display for INTEL, the ALL ABOUT PUMPS project, all sorts of 
animated animals, and bits and pieces of dozens of other things.  
(Many of these animations can be found in our file download areas.) 
<p>
How is it possible that even in 1995, THE ANIMATED SOFTWARE COMPANY is 
still able to get high praise for the quality of it's animation?  
It's not because we do everything right: we're far too small a company 
to be able to do everything right!  But we do know HOW to do the most 
important things very well.  We aren't always able to accomplish what 
we would like, and we can't adhere to every rule we've listed here, but we get enough done to get by.   
<p>
As a <b>public service</b>, we are presenting these "TRADE SECRETS" to any 
company that might want to listen, in the hopes that they will begin 
to write code that handles animation properly, or when setting 
standards, to require companies who produce products that adhere to 
those standards to follow these guidelines for animation. 
<p>
<hr>
<h4>FIRST RULE IS:  ADMIT IT: ANIMATION IS IMPORTANT</h4>
<p>
Therefore you have to optimize it.  There isn't much in computers 
these days that you really have to optimize, but animation is one 
thing you do.  And realize that animation is just about the best 
thing a computer can do!  Books are still generally easier to read 
than online documents (and many of you will probably print this out 
to read it.)  Newspapers, even with their poor contrast, are still 
common for their overall ease of use.  But these media can't give you 
animation.  Animation is a great instructive device.  Pictures really 
can be worth a thousand words.  Computers do animation, and it's 
really important!  It has to be optimized!   
<p>
Like what can be done to optimize it?  Like this: 
<p>
<b>Don't redraw the background screen as an interim step.</b> When an 
object moves across the screen, you cannot remove the previous 
position by redrawing the entire background area over the previous 
position, unless the amount of movement caused the object to have no 
overlap with it's previous position.  The overlapped part is usually 80% 
or more, so ONLY the nonoverlapped part should have the background redrawn.   
Do programmers really not know this or are they just lazy?   
<p>
<b>Preread your header files.</b>  Nearly every animation file can 
benefit from being placed on the screen quicker.  The same animation, 
running at 30 Frames Per Second, that uses only one hundredth (1/100) 
of a second to place each of the thirty frames of animation on the 
screen, will look better than one that uses two hundredths of a 
second to put each frame on the screen, even though both will run at 
the proscribed 30 FPS.  Mice, joysticks, keyboards and other devices 
will also all work better if the higher display rate can be achieved 
through software efficiencies. 
<p>
<b>Preread each frame, esp. the last-back-to-the-first transition.</b>  
Because the speed that the image is placed on the screen is as
important (more or less) as the frame rate (as just described) you
always need to preread the next frame.   This allows you to more
quickly "flick" the image onto the screen.  In fact, I have made
conscious decisions to trade absolute frame rate for an increase in
the speed that the individual image is placed on the screen.  Must be
important, then, huh?
<p>
<b>Let the user adjust the speed of the animation.</b>  Two ways:  
First, they should be able to slow down and speed up the 
animations so that it runs at a speed that is good for them.  Second, 
they should be able to size the window if necessary to smooth out 
and speed up a slow animation. 
<p>
<p>
<h4>SECOND RULE IS: BE KIND TO IDIOTS</h4>
<p>
Because, you see: We are all idiots.  Some of us are idiots some 
times, and others of us are idiots other times, and some of us are 
idiots more often than others of us are.  But it's a given:  We are 
all idiots sometimes. 
<p>
<b>Don't punish people for using your computer program.</b>  If they don't know the 
rules, explain the rules.  If they don't do the right thing, tell them 
what the correct choices are--don't just tell them they're wrong! 
<p>
<b>Explain errors.</b>  Don't just tell someone they've made an 
error without telling them what the error is, what to do about it, 
and where to go <i>instantly</i> for more help.  Most importantly, if 
they ask for more information, don't just repeat what you've already 
told them.  Don't be like the foreigner who simply talks louder when 
he is not understood.  
<p>
<b>Function Key One should always be the Help key.</b>  Do I have to 
explain this?  
<p>
<b>Programs should state their purpose and exit when asked.</b> If a user starts a program with just a 
question mark for a parameter, or -? or /? or \? or (?) or--you get the idea--then 
the program should just state its purpose (to sysout) and exit back to 
whatever invoked it.  No program should be allowed to execute if it can't 
perform that simple function of answering to a ? without actually "running".  
Virus checkers should test for that behavior as well. 
<p>
<p>
<h4>THIRD RULE IS: INTERACTIVE DOESN'T MEAN FINDING A TINY BUTTON</h4>
<p>
<b>Don't make people search for the next logical step.</b>   
Here's an idea for a user interface of two, three, up to maybe eight 
or ten choices:  draw the choices as sections of a pie and place the 
user's mouse in the center.  Then let them move the mouse as far or as little 
as they want into the various sections of the pie and then click.  
Don't let the mouse go outside the pie until they click, (other keys 
or other mouse buttons can override that) so that they 
don't have to stop moving towards the sector they want.  This would 
be an extremely fast selector device and could become standard.  For 
two choices, a flick to the left and a click or a flick to the right 
and a click would do it, and even the click could be eliminated with a 
small inner "dead zone" circle where they start.   
<p>
But mainly, you have to give them large areas where choices are made, 
so they don't have to focus on the mouse's cursor at all for most 
things. They should know intuitively where the mouse will be relative 
to the major choices--to the left is back, to the right is forward, etc.. 
<p>
Having the use of the mouse is nice, but why limit people to finding 
a couple of tiny buttons on a screen?  Is it some kind of a contest 
to see who is the most dextrous user?  For example why are we forced to focus on 
some stupid little part of an icon (not even a whole icon, sometimes) 
to PG UP and PG DN a screen?  I mean, browers that don't implement 
Page Up and Page Down keys are unbelievable to me--and why don't 
keyboards have standard PIXEL UP and PIXEL DOWN buttons and LINE UP 
and LINE DOWN buttons as well?  Every text file from antiquity has 
needed these display tools, let's get them on the keyboard where they 
belong! 
<p>
<p>
<h4>FOURTH RULE IS: WE NEED MORE INPUT DEVICES</h4>
<p>
<b>Every computer needs an A-D converter somewhere.</b> And you know 
what?  Just about every computer has one, but hardly anybody's using it.  
It's called the Game Port, aka Joystick.  The joystick is a powerful 
pointing device and beats the mouse in a thousand tasks.  
Unfortunately only the game programmers seem to have discovered this 
wonderful device!  Why is it that spreadsheet software doesn't use the 
joystick to enhance the cursor control capabilities?   
<p>
I added what seemed like a simple toy to the "P11" drawing program, that allows the 
mouse and the joystick to cooperate on a cursor.  It in turn allowed 
all kinds of new drawing capabilities (which show up in the ALL ABOUT 
PUMPS tutorial, for example.)  The joystick controls scaling of an 
object's size, and rotation of the object, while the mouse controls 
position and draw mode.  It works really well and is incredibly 
versatile!  Other serious graphics programs should consider using 
these two devices <i>together</i>.  The joystick port--it's not just 
for games anymore! 
<p>
<h4>FIFTH RULE IS: SPEED UP THE HARDWARE AND THE SOFTWARE WILL FOLLOW</h4> 
<p>
<b>Eliminate flicker.</b>  Whoever decided that computer monitors 
should refresh at the 60 and 70 frames per second rate should be 
shot with a slow-moving bullet.  Animation needs a much higher rate, 
partly because of the low resolution of the screens.  What happens is 
the images obtain additional flicker as they move around on the 
screen quickly, due to artifacts that are introduced by the low 
resolution (another scandal) in pixels.  The lower the resolution and 
the faster the objects move the more this problem manifests itself. 
<p>
I won't even bother to spend a lot of time attacking low resolution 
issues.  We do all our work at the 1024 by 768 dots, 256 color level 
and feel strongly that the whole world should move to screen 
resolutions of at least 4096 by 4096 dots, 
and 36 bits of color.  Yes, even for home animations.  12 
levels of the three primary colors and 4096 dots by 4096 dots on the 
screen should allow incredible images that rival visiting a museum. 
<p>
I also want to harangue about the com port!  When are we 
getting fiber optics into the home?  What is your problem, guys?  Are you 
afraid of the brave new world where video stores don't exist, camera 
stores don't exist, film developers don't exist, record stores don't 
exist, libraries don't exist, municipal records desks don't exist,
bookstores don't exist, newsstands don't exist.  You really think
those things, those things, not those concepts, make your <i>quality
of life</i>?  No, it's not those things, it's those concepts, which
will all turn cyber.  Do you think Edison cared about his cylinders,
or his motion picture cameras?  No!  He cared about reproducing sound
and images, by whatever means he could come up with!  We don't need
the physical thing, the record, tape, video, film print, magazine,
book, or whatever.  We need the file, that's all.  Just let us look
at the file.  That's publishing in cyberworld.
<p>
Another problem: Delays between screens.  We should all realize that
the user's time is valuable, and we should waste as little of it as
possible.  For example, on the Internet it takes "forever" to
download HTML files with even small pictures.  Files greater than
about 20K are generally considered worth warning the user about, and
HTML files should load "in not more than 9 to 15 seconds".  And, it
doesn't even matter if that's other pages in my site, or jumping to a
whole new site.  On the other hand, my ALL ABOUT PUMPS tutorial takes
two seconds, three tops, to load the next page (often only one
second), and in three keypresses you can be at any section from the hundreds of
screens in the program.  Compare that to your own experience right
here with The Internet Glossary of Pumps, which doesn't even have
animated images (as of this writing, Feb. 1996.)  I would never have
thought back in 1980 that in 1996 I'd still be preaching about the
delay between screens being a waste of time but I am.  And, I
probably wouldn't have if it weren't for the fact that the browsers
I've seen don't put the TEXT up before the GRAPHICS...  Know what I
mean?  I know, as an HTML author I'm guilty to some extent, but the
truth is, the browser should handle it, and force the text onto the
screen before the graphics so that the user has something to get
started with <i>right away!</i>  (In the ALL ABOUT PUMPS tutorial,
the text loads first, probably 99% of the time.)

<h1> The Use Of Random Numbers in Computer Art</h1>
<hr>
<p>
Below are "samples" of <b>RANDOM COMPUTER ART</b> which I create in
the early 1980's using the computer language called BASIC and a
Panasonic six-pen plotter, and an NEC laptop computer similar to the
famous TRS-100.  My unique procedure was written about in 
<a href="#pickover_link">Clifford Pickover</a>'s 
<i>JOURNAL OF CHAOS AND GRAPHICS</I> some years ago.
<p>
Each drawing is completely unique because the program that creates them 
uses hundreds--sometimes thousands--of random numbers (actually, 
psuedo-random numbers) to decide precisely how big, what color, and 
where shapes will be placed.  Leaves on trees are randomly placed as 
are the branches.  Houses are of random width but a standard height. 
<p> 
The pine trees and most other images are purely mathematical constructs 
and are computer generated.  The round tree images in one type of drawing 
were originally drawn on the computer and then the exact locations and 
other features were randomized.  
<p>
Some of these patterns take minutes to draw while others take over an hour.  
The longest any ever took was over <i>twelve hours</i>, at which point the 
plotter overheated or something and stopped working for a day, and
was never really the same since.
<p> 
There are currently about five basic patterns.  I have given away 
around 20,000 of these drawings and each one is believed to be unique (though good luck proving it!)
This possibly makes me the <b>world's most prolific artist in history!</b>  
Interestingly, when I lay out a hundred or so of these drawings on a
table at a computer show or something, people will often sort through
the WHOLE pile and pick out the ONE that they like the best--but all
of them are eventually picked!  Even with keeping the pile at around
100 pictures all day long, no picture ever stayed on the table all day.
If I lay out 200 drawings instead of 100, people will still sort
through them all--and it takes too long so I limit it to a hundred at
a time!  I really think this says something very interesting about
"art" and the perception of beauty, and the need for diversity.
<p>
This concept can be applied to building rows of real houses as well, 
or to paint schemes for cars, and to thousands of other everyday things.  
Thanks to the computer, we need not live in a dull world where everything 
is the same, dull and lifeless.  Furthermore, we can more easily experiment 
with different designs to find out people's average preference, and the 
degree of variation of preference.  
<p> 
Below the images is a BASIC program which creates the "bouncing line" 
drawing type.  The other programs are essentially the same kind 
of code, but quite a bit fancier. You are encouraged to use the 
concepts suggested in the code to develop your own use of random 
numbers and random images.
<p> 
<hr>
<p>
We have scanned in two sets of four images each available to view.  
Remember, these are NOT being generated right now just for you, but 
with a bit more sophisticated Internet programming skills, they probably 
could be, however for the complex ones it would also probably take too long 
to do it that way!  Also, note that using the Panasonic six-pen plotter 
produced much nicer looking original images.
<p>
These images have been scanned in with an HP ScanJet 4c color scanner
at 75 DPI and 256 colors.  Then the images were brought into Corel
Paintbrush and rescaled to 40% of original size at 60 DPI.  This made
the files each only about 8K in size.  There are four sets of two
images each.  <a href="/random/randoma2.htm">Another set of eight images is available here.</a>

Below is the actual code used to draw a "bouncing line" pattern (the
last of the four patterns show above.)
<p>
Feel free to use the ideas developed in it.  If you use the code
unchanged, please credit Animated Software Company as the author of
the program.
<p>
The program shown below was written back when every 
byte counted for space so please bear with its "ancient" dialect!
Note that some of the LPRINTs are specific for the Panasonic digital 
plotter, but most just write the image and would be essentially the
same in any language.
<p>
First the decision is made which of four positions to draw first, not that 
that makes a whole lot of difference.
Next the border is drawn, in lines 140 to 170.  Then the inner "bouncing line" is drawn.

<hr>
I've always called them <i>Mr.</i> Pelican, because they look so
stately.  They fly so gracefully, and they dive so boldly and
assuredly, and nearly always, it seems, come up gulping back a fish.
<p>
We caught a pelican last fall.  <i>I</i> didn't catch it, my friend caught
it, by accident.  He was casting from a boat in the middle of the 
Oceanside, California harbor, and immediately the bait hit the water, a
pelican was on top of it, trying to eat it.  He had sort of hopped
over from about 30 feet away when my friend cast the line.  We didn't realize they 
would do that.  We were using big slightly defrosted fish for bait,
and I guess it makes sense that they'd see that as free food.
<p>
My friend tried to snatch the line away before the pelican could
swallow it, but he hooked the bird's enormous pouch, so
we reeled him in and unhooked him.  I wanted to cut the line so we
could pass the hook through without more damage, but my friend
thought that time was paramount and it would be faster to just unhook
it.  I was holding the bird's wings so it wouldn't flap around so
much, so it wasn't really my call.  The bird was surprisingly fragile
and light as I held it.  When the hook was out I released the bird
and away he went, seemingly none the worse for it.  I guess fish fins
probably tear those pouches occasionally anyway, so it would be no
worse than that. 
<p>
Pelicans are huge birds.  Their wingspan is often six or seven feet,
and their necks are at least a foot long.  Their copious beaks are
probably a foot long as well, and have a beautiful slope to them. 
They have big webbed feet with four "toes" and each foot is
turned inwards a bit, so they often overlap their own feet,
though this doesn't seem to be a problem for them.
<p>
They fly with their heads tucked back, looking majestic as they cross
thirty or forty feet overhead (or less) from the bay (where they sit 
around on dockposts) over Pacific Coast Highway (PCH) and the beaches 
to the ocean to fish.  They'll glide a few feet off the ocean water,
usually right in front of a wave (where there's a natural updraft),
often below the crest of the wave, so they'll disappear from view. 
Then they'll zoom-climb to perhaps twenty or thirty feet, hammerhead
over (that's the aerobatic technical term for it; they pivot
vertically around one wingtip) and dive into the sea, straightening
their necks in the last moment of the dive.  A second later
they often as not come bobbing up with dinner in their beaks, which
they jostle around a bit (to get it head-first I guess) and then
straighten their necks once more and shake their beaks and swallow.  
Then they gracefully lift off and fly away.
<p>
Sometimes seagulls follow them out to sea, I guess because sometimes they
miss and only stun or wound their prey, or they loose
their meals occasionally and the seagull gets an easy dinner.  The
gulls will land near the pelican and hope something turns up.
<p>
Pelicans travel up and down the coast in great V-formations of
usually at least half a dozen birds, and often as many as two dozen. 
We've seen over forty in one V formation, usually a little lopsided
with more pelicans on one side of the V than the other.  They usually
fly only about 100 to 200 feet off the ground, usually over the shore cliffs.  
Sometimes the formation will break apart, and if you're driving in the same
direction they're going on PCH you can watch them for miles trying to reform.
(At least you could before our mayor started putting in useless new traffic
lights for useless new developments he permitted; I'm specifically
referring to Descanso Blvd. and another new one South of it.)  The flocks--or
should they be called gaggles?--go about 30 
miles on hour, depending on wind conditions I guess.
<p>
They're quiet birds, none of the yacking and quacking you get from
geese flying south for the winter.  
<p>
<IMG ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=10 WIDTH=73 HEIGHT=50 SRC="/pics/pelicans/pelibeak.jpg" ALT=""><br>
I somehow managed not to really notice, when we accidentally 
caught that pelican, but a pelican's beak has a half-inch hook at the end 
of it.  It's
a mean looking hook, built like a nail that's been hammered backwards into
the end of a hammer-sized piece of wood, and bent down.  Downright lethal to small animals
and certainly would hurt anyone that gets whacked with it.  It's about
half an inch long.  And I'm sure <b>Mr. Pelican</b> knows how to use it
to its best effect, too!  
<p>
This weekend was Independence Day weekend.  I guess
normally when a pelican wants to die, he lands on some quiet beach,
but since it was Fourth of July weekend there weren't any quite
stretches of beach in Carlsbad, California at sunset, Friday, July 5th.
<p>
So the pelican just landed right in the middle of everyone.  Sort of
like when a private plane lands on a highway.  We were about 100 feet
away, and wandered over as a crowd gathered around the bird, which
was just standing there, neck retracted, looking around.  People
stayed about 9 or 10 feet away, but two children (3 or 5 year olds) went
nearly twice as close, until their mom called them back.  People left
the front path open (he was facing into the wind), forming a circle 
of about 270 degrees, maybe a dozen people, all looking at him, 
wondering what was wrong.  There were no visible signs of damage or distress. 
Someone said he looked like a very old bird, from the scars on his
beak and the grayness of his feathers.
<p>
<IMG ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=10 WIDTH=223 HEIGHT=221 SRC="/pics/pelicans/pelicmr2.gif" ALT=""><br>
I was in front off to the bird's left, and I came a little closer
than everyone else, about as close as the children had gotten.  I
knelt down and reached out my hand towards the bird, slowly turning
it over so he could see I wasn't packing anything.  I kept out
of striking distance at first, having noticed the hook at the end of
the beak.  This is <i>not</i> a duck.  
<p>
I kept reaching just a little bit closer, but whenever there was any
distraction for the bird (like a dog or a noisy or fast-moving human)
I'd quickly withdraw the 'threat' until the distraction had passed. 
I'd look at the thing causing the disturbance (which actually gave
the bird a chance to try to whack me when I wasn't paying full attention).  
The rest of the time, the bird and I were eye-to-eye about three feet apart.
Pelicans have two eyelids on each eye; an inner one that comes in from the
side, and one that works much like ours.  They blink the inner one by
itself sometimes, and I think the outer one is blinked less often but
only when the inner one blinks as well.  He would usually blink very
slowly, something most humans, I would say, can't do at all without
quivering.  Sometimes he would keep the eye closed for a second or two.
<p>
The bird watched me warily while I watched him intently, since if he
made any aggressive movement, such as raising his neck, 
I would have to back off.  He didn't, but I didn't yet feel
comfortable enough to go so far as to actually touch it.  I got within about 
five inches.  For one thing, there's that hook.  For another,
the week before a guy had walked for no good reason into the bear cage 
at the nearby San Diego Zoo and been mauled.  I could see the
headlines: <b>Fourth of July Reveler Hacked While Trying to Pet a
Pelican</b>.  No thanks.  
<p>
I consider myself something of a 'pro' at petting.  I've petted
dragonflys (they arch their backs), a praying mantis, cicadas, beetles, and
insects so small I had to hold my finger with both hands resting on
the ground to be sure I didn't accidentally squish them.  Lobsters get
all relaxed if you stroke them on the center ridge behind the eyes. 
They stop flailing their claws and droop everything.  (Someone showed
me that.  I guess what happens next comes as more of a surprise that way.) 
I've used sticks and pencils to gently pet animals that are too dangerous, 
or too yecchy, to get close to, like scorpions and spiders.
<p>
I have highly refined cat and dog petting techniques.  With cats, just pet 
them behind and between the ears and they'll usually fall for you.  
Make a clicking noise, kneel, and hold your hand out palm up as you 
approach.  With dogs, start on the head, and rub up and down the
spine.  They'll stick their rear end up.  Scratch right above the
tail at the base of the spine.  They'll go crazy.  Cats and dogs 
pretty much know how to tell you what part to rub, if you try to listen.
<p>
I can't recall ever petting a bird that hadn't had a wing broken at
the pet store or been housebroken in some other way.  Birds generally don't
get close enough to humans that we can pet them if they can help
it--and who can blame them?
<p>
No one else wanted to get close to the bird, or at least, no one dared. 
(Or no one else was stupid enough to.  What's the difference?)  After
a few minutes the bird began to walk--waddle--slowly up the beach
towards the seawall.  When he got there he caused quite a
stir, as people on the balconies of the building filmed it
and pointed at it and so forth.  
<p>
Suddenly the bird stretched out its wings, and started a takeoff run
into the wind.  He flew about 100 yards, and never left ground
effects, not even getting a full wingspan's distance off the ground. 
He had to fly between several groups of people, and it was amazing to
watch him glide and bank to avoid first one group, then another.  He
landed again, and just stood there, again, and I wandered over,
again.
<p>
Again, I got down on my knees and approached him very very slowly. 
At the first place, several times dogs had walked up near the crowd,
but no one would let the dogs near the pelican.
<p>
Here, there were a lot less people, and I had to actively get up and walk around
the bird several times to stand between it and some passing dog. 
Then I'd come back and kneel near it, and reach out towards it in
such a way that it could, if it tried, hack me, if I couldn't retract
my arm first.  I figured I could win if he tried, but that he could
try if he wanted.  Finally, I was just 5 inches from his head, then
at last, I just barely touched the feathers on his head.  He didn't
really like that, he walked forward about three steps, but still made
absolutely no aggressive action towards me.  A two year-old started
hollering "Do it again Daddy!" (which his real daddy, right next to
him, probably didn't like hearing).  I reached out again and touched 
it ever so gently again, and it stepped forward a few steps again, and 
I laid back.  I didn't touch it again after that.
<p>
It just stood there.  There were four of us watching it now, everyone
else had left.  He slowly walked up towards the sea wall and I stayed
within about 5 feet of it the whole time, and no one would come
nearer to it than me, or even come very close. Some wanted to ask me what
was going on, or ask "Is that a pelican?" (no it's a dodo bird).  They 
would do that usually by walking around the bird to come up behind me.
<p>
I reached over a little too close, and he arched up his neck a bit
and began to "assume the position" wherein he could whack the
beak-hook into my flesh, but it wasn't done with any real aggression, it was
just a communication device, telling me--almost asking me--to back off.  
<p>
At one point, the bird took a few definite steps towards me, which was
kind of a special moment.  Turns out, we think, that it had seen a
dog before we did (bird vision is usually a lot better than human
vision) and wanted to hide a little--and knew I'd get between it and
the dog anyway, since I had done that now for at least 5 or 6 dogs,
and even a couple of people.
<p>
Finally, nightfall had set well in, and everyone had apparently
walked their dogs (which is illegal on our beaches, by the way).  I
had to decide what to do, and I decided that it was no longer safe on
the beach for us anymore, and that there would probably be no more dogs, and besides,
the wind was coming off the ocean, so they couldn't smell the bird
who was nestled up near the cement seawall (in a quite defenseless
position, really).  
<p>
We went home for the night, but decided to set the alarm for the next
morning so that we would get there at first light (a little before
dawn) figuring that if he made it through the night, and if he was
still there, he would need to be guarded again from morning
dog-walkers and curious, if accidental, tormentors.
<p>
We set the alarm, and got there before any birds were flying.  He was
quite invisible in the dark, but he was 
still there, still just standing there looking glum.  
We opened a can of sardines that we had brought.  I put them on a
paper plate and pushed the plate towards him, but he wouldn't eat them. 
Then I took the plate, and picked up the sardines and tossed a few at
his feet, but he wouldn't eat them.  I hit him on the beak with one,
but he still wouldn't do anything.  Clearly he was intent on dying.
I ate the rest of the sardines myself and sat down a few feet away
from him and waited.  
<p>
<IMG ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=10 WIDTH=262 HEIGHT=101 SRC="/pics/pelicans/pelicnme.gif" ALT=""><br>
<p>
An inquisitive dog came up behind him at one point, and I hadn't seen
the dog approach.  He got quite close to the bird, and I jumped up and shooed him
away.  The pelican barely reacted to the dog, but as I got rather close 
to the pelican myself, he snapped a little, almost in mock aggression.  He
certainly made no attempt to actually whack me, of course.  I backed
off and sat down again.  He did not wander off.
<p>
He was shaking a little every once in a while, and wobbling a bit 
as he stood in place.  Every so often he would sigh a deep sigh.
<p>
During the next few hours we tried a couple of times pointing 
to pelicans who were out fishing for breakfast and saying 
"Don't you want to join your buddies?" but it became pretty clear he didn't. 
<p>
<IMG ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=10 WIDTH=361 HEIGHT=203 SRC="/pics/pelicans/pelifwal.gif" ALT=""><br>
<p>
In fact, he turned and faced the seawall.  He nearly fell over as he
turned, he was unsteady on his feet, (or maybe just tripped over
them).  He was absolutely incapable of flying. 
<p>
He stayed there for a half hour or so, then he sat down.  He would
get up every so often to go to the bathroom, then even that was too
much and he would just go in place every so often, and try to waddle
forward a bit.
<p>
Finally, he turned to face me, and stretched his wings a couple of
times.  Not fully, just a bit.  We started to think maybe, possibly, 
he was going to take off and sail away. But he just aired himself out a
bit.  
<p>
<IMG ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=10 WIDTH=199 HEIGHT=131 SRC="/pics/pelicans/pelilast.gif" ALT=""><br>
<p>
He didn't really try to retract his wings afterwards, instead leaving them out along 
the sand.  He stayed like that for a minute or two, resting the tip
of his beak on the sand. Then he raised himself up and started to
writhe, like everything was uncomfortable all off a sudden.  Then he
sat down again.  He moved his beak to one side, then the other, 
as though he couldn't get comfortable, then he lifted 
his head up a little, and lay it down slightly twisted on 
the ground.  He shuddered a bit and was still.
<p>
Mr. Pelican was dead.

<h2>Pelican facts:</h2>
<p>
Shortly after this story was written, a huge Pelican die-off occurred
from mid-August to mid-November (1996) about 100 miles east of here, 
on the shores of the Salton Sea.  More pelicans died than ever before 
in known U.S. history.  As reported in the San Diego Union Tribune, 
nearly <B>15%</B> (over 1100 birds) of the endangered <b>brown pelican</b> 
died and about <b>20%</b> (over 8500 birds) of the western United States' 
population of <b>white pelicans</b> died.  
They died of Avian Botulism (harmless to humans).  At the same time
in the same waters, tens of thousands of Tilapia fish were dieing of
bacterial diseases, and the birds may have eaten sick fish.
<p>
Avian Botulism deadens the nervous system, causing the bird to loose 
the ability to balance, walk, fly and keep their head up.  Mr. Pelican 
kept his head up to the very end.  He staggered a little, but not much.  
I don't think he was an early casualty (and 100 miles away from the
scene of the die-off).
<p>
The author has learned that pelicans seldom if ever would eat 
anything the least bit dead, so the refusal of the sardine may
have been just typical pelican behavior.
<p>
Pelicans belong to the genus <i>Pelecanus</i> of the family <i>Pelecanidae</i>. 
Their wingspan can reach 10 feet.  There are six species and several
subspecies of pelican.  The most common in the U.S. is the white 
pelican, which have black wingtips.  Brown pelicans have dark wings 
and undersides, but white heads and necks. 
<p>
Pelicans do not necessarily swallow their catch right away.  They may 
store it in their huge pouch, for eating later or feeding to their young.  
<p>
Pelicans build nests of twigs and branches near the water's edge.
<p>
Pelicans are migratory birds.  
<p>
The shape of the beak of the pelican should be well-known to
mariners and others familiar with a latch known as a "pelican hook".

<h2> Books For Animators and Programmers</h2>
<IMG ALIGN=LEFT WIDTH=32 HEIGHT=32 HSPACE=10 SRC="/pics/icons/books.gif" ALT="">
<hr>
     Suggested Readings for people who like animation and Computer Graphics:
<p>     
     The following books have been particularly helpful to the author,  and he  recommends them to anyone who wants to increase their knowledge of the particular areas covered:
<P>     
     ANIMALS IN MOTION and THE HUMAN FIGURE IN MOTION, Eadweard Muybridge,  Dover Publications, Inc., New York, NY.  The original and still the best.  In the late 1800's Mr. Muybridge took carefully timed photographs of animals and people showing a wide variety of activity.  These two books contain hundreds  of his  sequences, many of which have been used for  the demos that accompany this program, and are the basis for the horse animation on the right-hand edge of this reference.
<P>     
     THE ANIMATORS WORKBOOK, Tony White, Watson-Guptill Publications, New York, NY, 1986.  This book shows important techniques for  drawing animated cartoon figures, for making motion look real, and so on. Not computer-oriented, it is an invaluable aid to any animator.
<P>     
     CHUCK AMUCK, Chuck Jones, Farrar Straus & Giroux, 1989. One of the original directors of Warner Brothers cartoons.  Need I say more?  Great book.
<P>     
     THAT'S NOT ALL, FOLKS!, Mel Blanc, Warner Books, 1988. The late Mel Blanc was the voice for Bugs Bunny, Porky Pig, and other Warner Brothers cartoon characters.  This book offers insight into many aspects of cartoon creation.  If only it came with a sound disk!
<P>     
     APPLIED CONCEPTS IN MICROCOMPUTER GRAPHICS, Bruce A. Artwick, Prentice Hall, Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey.  Mr. Artwick is the original author of FLIGHT SIMULATOR which should be  enough to convince anyone that he knows what he's doing!  A very readable and fact-filled book covering many topics in computer graphics, giving algorithms, considerations, and so forth.
<P>     
     IBM PC & XT ASSEMBLY LANGUAGE / A GUIDE FOR PROGRAMMERS, Leo  J. Scanlon,  Brady Communications Company, Inc. New York, NY, 1985.  Of all the books on Assembler programming techniques  that the author read to learn how to control the PC, this one was by far the best. 
<P>     
     PC INTERN, Michael Tischer, Abacus. Grand Rapids, MI., 1992.  Over 1000 pages that really contain over 1000+ pages of technical information.  A truly wonderful book, 
<P>     
     MORPHING MAGIC, Scott Anderson, Sams  Publishing, Carmel, IN, 1993.  Great discussion of the history of animation.
<P>  
     INVISIONING INFORMATION, Edward R. Tufte, Graphics Press, Cheshire, CT,  1990.  This and the companion book (below) are priceless treasures of knowledge and should be on everyones bookshelf, even if they just look at charts in the newspaper!
<P>
     THE VISUAL DISPLAY OF QUANTITATIVE INFORMATION, Edward R. Tufte, Graphics Press, Cheshire, CT,  1983.  This and the companion book (above) are indespensible.
<P>
     THE ART OF THE ENGINEER, Ken Baynes and Francis Pugh, The Overlook Press, Woodstock, NY, 1981.  Huge history of colorful and/or intricate engineering drawings.  Beautiful, informative, fascinating.
<P>
     THE SCIENTIFIC IMAGE: FROM CAVE TO COMPUTER, By Harry Robin, Harry N. Abrams, Inc., New York, NY, 1992.  Mostly historic examples of scientific information display.
<hr>     
     Other useful and recommended books, in no particular order:
<P>     
     PROGRAMMER'S GUIDE TO PC & PS/2 VIDEO SYSTEMS, Richard Wilton, Microsoft Press, 1987.
<P>     
     PROGRAMMER'S GUIDE TO THE EGA AND VGA CARDS, Richard F. Ferraro, Addison-Wesley Publishing Company, Inc., 1988.
<P>     
     PROGRAMMER'S GUIDE TO THE EGA/VGA, George Sutty and Steve Blair, Brady Books, 1988.
<P>     
     ADVANCED MS-DOS, Ray Duncan, Microsoft Press, 1986.

     Equipment Used to Create Russell's "P11" Animation	Machine:
<P>     
     The following products are used to create and maintain the program and it's  documentation, or just to keep things running smoothly  at  P11  ENTERPRISES.    All  have  worked reliably, efficiently  and effectively  and are recommended. Most  of  these  names  are  trademarked  by  the  companies mentioned:
<P>     
     Source code is written entirely in Assembler for speed and compactness and to keep the author busy.  It is compiled and linked together using MICROSOFT's MACRO ASSEMBLER (MASM) version 6.
<P>     
     Our current development operating system is MS-DOS version 6.22.
<P>     
     Source code is edited using BRIEF version 2, from SOLUTION SYSTEMS, South Weymouth, MA.  I think it's called BRIEF because it wipes the pants off of everything else.
<P>     
     Special thanks to HEWLETT-PACKARD for making good equipment and for aiding this developer.
<P>     
     Press releases, brochures and newsletters are created with GEOWORKS ENSEMBLE from GEOWORKS, Berkeley, CA.
<P>     
     On our Pentium we have an Iomega Bernoulli removable hard drive providing us with reliable backup service.
<P>     
     We use an NEC MultiSync 4FG monitor on our 80586, a Sceptre SVGA monitor on  our 80486, a TATUNG VGA monitor on our 80386, and a TANDY ECGA monitor on our XT.
<P>     
     We keep our hard disk clean and happy and convert bitmapped fonts to bitplane fonts with THE NORTON UTILITIES ADVANCED EDITON  version 4.5  from PETER  NORTON  COMPUTING, INC., Santa Monica, CA.
<P>     
     On our 80386 we keep RAM use by other programs to a minimum with QUARTERDECK EXPANDED MEMORY MANAGER 386 from QUARTERDECK OFFICE SYSTEMS, Santa Monica, CA.
<P>     
     A GLARE/GUARD PROFESSIONAL, with VLF/ELF radiation protection, from OPTICAL COATING LABORATORY, INC. Santa Rosa, CA protects our eyes from eyestrain and possible more serious radiation  hazards  which  may  be  lurking  in  our monitors.  Highly recommended if you don't have a protection built into the monitor (newer ones often do.)
<P>     
     We use a BUFFALO MEMORY MANAGER board for EMM on our XT system.  It also has a TECMAR 16-color ECGA graphics board and a TANDY color monitor.
<P>     
     On our CGA machine we use and like FLICKERFREE, a screen enhancement program (for text mode) from GIBSON RESEARCH CORP., Laguna Hills, California.
<P>     
     We  use a SUMMAGRAPHICS 1201-A DIGITIZER, from SUMMAGRAPHICS, Seymour, CT for most graphics tasks.
<P>     
     On Hercules systems we use SOFTGRAF from THE AUTOSCRIBE CORPORATION, Rockville, MD to run in CGA-emulation mode.
<P>     
     Most of our mise are Microsoft units.
<P>     
     Our joystick is by CH PRODUCTS, San Marcos, CA.
<P>     
     We compress our disk files with a registered copy of PKZIP from PKWARE.

<title> Statistical facts and factoids for June, 1996, Animated Software Co. Web Site</title>
</header>
<body>
<hr>
<h1> Site Access statistics and inferences for Animated Software Company</h1>
<hr>
<a href="/pics/icons/ascologo.gif"><IMG ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=10 WIDTH=32 HEIGHT=14 SRC="/pics/icons/ascolog1.gif" ALT=""></a>
<p>
<b>Statistics for June, 1996:</b>
<p>
These figures are based on a summation of the raw data supplied by
our Internet Service Provider (ISP). 
<p>
No attempt has been made (that we know of) to verify the accuracy of
these data.  Quite the contrary in fact: they actually conflict with (and are
generally greater than) some of the other
raw data we receive (specifically, with the weekly reports from the same ISP, as
well as with the independent access counter on our 
<a href="/index.html#homepage_cntr">home page</a>.
However, we've been getting statistical reports from
our ISP since March, 1996 when we moved to a Sun server, 
and we have certainly noticed a steady rise that
seems to coincide in some small highly chaotic way with our own web
site promotional efforts.  (We are <i>trying</i> to get you to tell
others to visit, you know!)
<p>
We feel justified in presenting these numbers as what we believe to
be reasonably accurate -- or at least not above the true figures -- 
because it seems to me
that the conflicting reports from our ISP are much more likely to be due 
to actual visits failing to be properly recorded rather than to
making up visits that don't exist.  
<p>
Since both the weekly and the
monthly reports miss some (different) visits, occasionally the
accumulated figures for weekly
reports for individual HTML files will have more than the monthly
reports for the same period shows, but usually they have somewhat less.  
<p>
The ISP is working on the problem and suggests that my assessment is
correct--take the higher number, Russ, you knucklehead!
<p>
As for the outside counter mismatch, that thing is busy a lot and
doesn't count, especially when it's Friday and Saturday evenings 
in the United States.
<p>
Of the total number of accesses, 22,710 were for html files, the rest
were for GIFS and a couple of JPGS.  Because three of the GIF files
appear as icons for every page, users only download these three
images <i>once</i> per visit to our web site, no matter how long they
stay.  (Future visits don't necessarily cause these to be downloaded
again, but usually they do.  Browsers are generally pretty stupid.)
The three top icons had:  4668 hits (Table of Contents GIF), 4584 hits
(mailbox logo) and 4449 hits (Animated Software Company tiny logo).
<p>
As any Internet user no doubt is aware of, 
a lot of times graphics don't always all get
downloaded.  That explains the descrepencies among these numbers
which should all be exactly equal in a perfect Internet world.
Sometimes none of them are downloaded, for example when people turn
off graphics (which is fine at our site, but virtually (I love that
word) ruins some other sites).  Bottom line is these images can be
used to guess at the actually number of different visitors (and
multiple visits at different times for the same visitor).
<p>
I figure about 5000 visitors last month.  The Table of Contents
image shows 4668 right off, so if about 6% didn't get that graphic
(for one reason or another), we had 5000 visitors (including me, but
I'm probably less than 100 of those.)
<p>
If you divide the total html files downloaded (22,710) by the
estimated visitor count (5000), you get about 4.5 html files 
downloaded per visitor.  I'm sure many of you stay longer and I thank
you for your interest in our web site.  The Glossaries probably have
a lot more staying power than most other parts of the site (both
glossary base pages are in the top ten of downloaded html pages, see below.)
<p>
Last month (June, 1996) 54,814 files were downloaded from this site.  
<ul><b> Of these: </b>
<li>
34 <i>Code 302</i> Redirected Requests 
<li>
571 <i>Code 404</i> Not Found Requests 
<li>
8135 local server accesses (most of these are me, I guess)
<li>
6679 unresolved accesses (whatever that means).  
<li>
38 countries accessed the site in June, 1996.
</ul>
<p>
<ul>
<b>The top ten country accesses outside the United States came from:</b>
<li>1482 Canada
<li>661 Australia
<li>634 United Kingdom
<li>594 Sweden
<li>576 <a href="/misc/theworld/vonwerra.htm">Germany</a>
<li>435 Denmark
<li>414 France
<li>388 Japan
<li>309 Italy
<li>228 <a href="/pumpglos/dutchpum.htm">Netherlands</a>
<li>New Zealand is pushing at the top ten with 212!  
</ul>
<p>
The total foreign accesses is approximately 8,400 (or maybe exactly)
of which the top ten are 5,721 or about 68% of the total foreign
accesses.  Foreign accesses are about 15% of <i>all</i> accesses.  THANKS EVERYONE!  
<p>
The top ten visited html pages accounted for 7,171 html hits, or
a little less than 1 out of every 3 visits to html pages.  There were 
approximately 200 different html pages at the web site in June, 1996.
<p>
<ul><b> The top ten visited html pages were: </b>
<li><a href="/hightech/philspgp.htm">1487</a> Phil Zimmermann Interview
<li><a href="/index.htm">1356</a> My Home Page 
<li><a href="/contents.htm">1134</a> Table of Contents

<li><a href="/mailprom.htm">309</a> Our Email Promise to you
</ul>
<p>
Statistics reports began in late March, 1996.  The previous month's totals were:  May: 35,254 'hits'  April: 13,295 'hits'

<h1> Pictures from the Sequoias </h1>
Sequoias are related to 
<a href="/misc/stories/redwoods/redwoods.htm">California Redwoods</a>
but are generally a litte shorter and a little wider at the base.  
These pictures were taken by Russell D. Hoffman in 1996 in Kings Canyon 
National Park and Sequoia National Forest, California.  Camera: Mamiya 
m645J with a Mamiya-Sekor 80mm 1:2.8 lens or a Mamiya-Sekor 150mm 
1:3.5 telephoto lens.

<h3>A PLUTONIUM-POWERED RUSSIAN SPACE PROBE FALLS TO EARTH</h3>
<h5>by Russell D. Hoffman  Copyright (c) 1996</h5>
<h4>On Sunday, November 17th, 1996 a Russian space probe
headed for Mars instead fell back to Earth after its fourth-stage booster rocket
failed on takoff a few days earlier.  It contained about 7 ounces (200
grams) of Plutonium (or perhaps 9 ounces and 270 grams, depending on 
the report) and apparently 'landed' in an unknown place
somewhere in the South Pacific Ocean.  (Or on land.)
</h4>
<p>
Most of the immediate news reports seemed to suggest that a catastrophe had 
been <i>avoided</i>, on the grounds that the Russian probe was not
expected to have broken up.  The plutonium powerplant on the probe is
designed to 'probably' survive an uncontrolled, tumbling reentry
followed by colliding with water at hundreds or even thousands of 
miles per hour, (hard as cement at those speeds) and sink to
the seabed at an unknown depth in an unknown place.  I have even
heard the phrase "fell harmlessly to earth" used.
<p>
<h3>It is absolutely erroneous to say that this is harmless.</h3>
<p>
If indeed the plutonium fell to earth intact, it is probably true that it 
would be 'relatively' harmless.  Plutonium is not nearly as dangerous when 
in solid blocks. You can even hold it.  (Though I wouldn't want to go to
bed with it each night.)  It is when it is dispersed, and <i>especially</i> 
when it is pulverized into the atmosphere that it is dangerous. If
the plutonium pack stayed intact, the worst danger might well have
been from it falling on a fisherman (or a fish).  But if it got 
pulverized-and we don't know if it did or didn't--but if it did get
pulverized, look out!
<p>
It is criminal to be using plutonium in outer
space.  Because of the dangers cited in other articles at this web
site (see links below) there is simply no reasonable guarantee that
plutonium-packed probes will be perfectly placed in their planned
projectories.  There is too much debris up there already for any
reasonable guarantee.   Recently (November 17th, 1996) an
American space worker quoted on CNN pointed out that the United 
States tracks some 8,000 pieces of space debris 
<i>greater in size than 4 inches (about 10
cm.).</i>  Why is this so bad?  Can't we just avoid the stuff, since
we're tracking so much of it?  No.
<p>
<h3>We can't steer around it all.</h3>
<p>
First of all, we cannot track those thousands of pieces very
well.  And even if we could, I am not aware of how much of that
information is shared even today with Russia and other space
agencies.  And even if the information is freely shared, we might then 
ask how much of it was actually used by the Russians to 'snake' their 
way up into outer space?  It is an incredibly complex and costly analysis
requiring many CPU cycles of a supercomputer.  Or you can just chance it.
<p>
Second, a piece far smaller than the ones we can track, even a piece 
the size of a BB, can do horrendous damage to anything it collides 
with, because of the incredible speeds at which things travel through 
space.  Collision with a piece of existing 
space debris may be why the fourth stage failed in the
first place.  And if such a piece collided with the probe at any time
in its orbit, it could smash the plutonium's casing like it was made
of butter, and vaporize some or all of the plutonium.  
<h3>Worst Case Scenario.</h3>
If this happens relatively near to earth, as it may have, the microscopic 
pieces would fall to the atmosphere and this is the absolute most dangerous
state of the absolute most dangerous matter.  It has been estimated
that merely one pound of plutonium, if scattered about in microscopic
quantities, could cause lung cancer in <i>every living human being 
on the planet.</i>  And this probe had nearly half a pound--about seven
ounces! 
<p>
It is the very fact that most of the time plutonium is NOT
broken up and scattered widely that allows people to think this stuff 
can be handled at all--few deny its extreme deadliness even if they
argue the concept of no minimum lethal dose.  And just what is the 
'best' method of distribution of plutonium, if you want to kill 
people all over the earth in one of the most horrible ways imaginable?  
It is to spread it in microscopic pieces throughout the atmosphere.
<p>
<h3>You may already be a loser.</h3>  
<p>
This may have actually happened November 17th, 1996.  It is <b>not known</b> 
what happened.  It <b>may not even be possible</b> to discover for sure 
what really did happen, because if the powerpack broke up we probably could 
NEVER recover all the little pellets (each about the size of a pencil eraser 
tip) that were in it even if we could find the general area where
the pieces fell--if they fell.  Each pellet we fail to find may be 
one that was knocked loose and pulverized in the upper atmosphere.  
I am not aware of any efforts to salvage the pieces so that we could
know, one way or the other, what happened.
<p>
If the worst happened, the only way we might be able to tell that it
had happened is that
over the next twenty years, lung cancer cases will increase.  If the
damage was 'minimal' then lung cancers might increase by only a small
fraction of a percent.  Millions of people, but only a small fraction
of a percent.  In other words, if only a few grams of the
200 total grams of material were to have burned up and spread through 
the upper atmosphere, it might take it years to fall to earth (breathing 
level) where it can lodge in living thing's lungs.  Then it takes as much as 
20 years or more to turn into cancer.  And if this only happens to a
fraction of a percent of people, it might be very difficult to
identify the cause, or even notice that it is happening.  Yet,
tens of thousands, or even millions of people can die and still no 
one can prove what is
happening!  And of course, the fools that launched the probe will
have long retired and misplaced their old scientific notes.
<p>
There is no known cure for most cancers.  Sometimes, you can remove the
cancerous organ.  However most organs, you need.  Sometimes you can 
kill the bad cells with chemotherapy or some other horrific treatment, at 
great risk to the rest of the body. Sometimes you can transplant a
'new' organ if you can find a suitable donor, with great stress to 
the body and grave risk of rejection.
<p>
Plutonium causes mutations in the nucleus of living cells.  Sometimes 
these mutations are harmless.  Sometimes they simply kill the cell which
usually isn't too bad, if not too many cells get killed.  But sometimes the
cell mutates into something that reproduces itself quickly.  Mutated cells 
multiply and take over nearby cells or break off and travel through the
bloodstream and lodge elsewhere in the body, or stay in the blood and 
destroy the blood itself.  If a reproductive cell is mutated, genetic 
mutations are possible as well, and offspring suffer the consequences.
<p>
<h3>Mutation is a chancy business.</h3>
<p>
Mutation is not necessarily a bad thing, but it <i>usually</i> is a bad thing. 
In fact, the vast majority of times, it's a bad thing.  The human
being is an awesomely sophisticated entity.  It is one of the longest
living animals, certainly the most intelligent.  It thinks it's the most
compassionate.  It controls its environment.
<p>
It is not likely that a mutation will occur that will render
plutonium poisoning harmless to some future generation of humans and
other living things.  Resistance to random mutations does not 'evolve' 
as can resistance to disease.  It probably wouldn't even be good if
we as a species somehow evolved to be more resistant to mutation in
general.  Wouldn't such resistance also make us more vulnerable to 
the rapidly changing environment around us?   We <i>need</i> to
be able to evolve, but an accelerated rate of random mutation 
causes cancer and genetic mutations, and is not a good thing.
<p>
<h3>Plutonium does not belong in spacecraft.</h3>  If we cannot 
find an alternative powerplant for long missions, then that simply means we
are not ready to do those long missions.  New, far cleaner power sources
are being developed.  Better launch techniques have been
studied and can also be developed so that we can launch heavier payloads. 
Unmanned missions should be launched by rail gun or similar high-G
ballistic technology.
<p>
In ten years the power consumption of the computers used in the space
probes will probably be one tenth (1/10th) the power consumption of
today's devices, for the same amount of computing power.  Motors too 
are getting lighter and stronger because of newer ceramics, new 
bearings, etc.  Would a ten or even a twenty year wait really matter that
much if we could improve the technology substantially?  There are plenty 
of places mankind has been unable to explore
because it's too dangerous.  For instance we haven't visited a far more
interesting place--below the mantle of the earth!  Why
not?  It's too dangerous!  Why don't we visit the sun?  Too dangerous! 
Plutonium is too dangerous to use!  So we either find another way, or
we don't do it!
<p>
The ONLY reason the plutonium was on board the spacecraft, by the
way, was to power the electronics and electromechanical devices.  That's 
it!  A battery!  For this we risk literally millions, or even tens of 
millions of lives?
<p>
<h3>Getting there is only half the battle.</h3>
<p>
There is one more issue.  What if the probe's retro engines failed to
ignite and the probe smashed into Mars at 70,000 miles an
hour?  The plutonium would probably be smashed to smithereens and
scattered for miles around or burn up in Mars' atmosphere.  What 
a wonderful way to introduce 
ourselves to another planet!  Plutonium-238, which the rocket used, 
has a half-life of 87.8 years. Any species of intelligent life that 
received one of our strange plutonium packages would probably consider 
it an act of ecological warfare.  
<p>
Or perhaps, after successfully studying the place, we will abandon
our probe and Mars for 1000 years or so, having found nothing very useful, 
or having lost the ability to go for some reason.  Some later civilization
might revisit the desolate planet, perhaps this time in need of a new 
permanent place to live, having finally poisoned the home garden.  
They will still find remnants of these plutonium "dead zones" placed 
there by some by-then-unknown previous visitor.  "There must have been 
a terrible accident" they will say.  "No wonder the place is deserted" 
they will say.  "Who would have done this?" they will ask.  "My gosh, it
was us!" they will realize.
<p>
America has launched nearly two dozen plutonium-packed missions,
including, on December 4th, 1996, its own Mars mission called Pathfinder
which included about 1/2 ounce of plutonium (probably purchased from
Russia).  This is absurd.  I am not aware of how many have been lost 
but any of them can be, and there is absolutely no defense against space 
debris. Late in 1997 NASA is planning a <b>major</b> plutonium launch.  It's
called Cassini and will include (if we let it happen) over 72
<i>pounds</i> of plutonium!  Let's stop this madness before the disaster 
we are flirting with occurs--or occurs again, if that's the case.

<h2>No Plutonium in Space!</h2>  
<hr>
We, the undersigned, call upon NASA and our elected officials to
suspend plans to launch the Cassini space probe to Saturn as long as
any plutonium is scheduled to be on board.  Presently, the project
calls for 72.3 pounds of plutonium 238 to generate on-board
electricity.  The risk of an accident at launch or during its
"slingshot fly-by" above the Earth is not worth the gamble.  We urge
the use of alternative on-board power sources such as solar energy
and long-life fuel cells for all future space missions.

<h3>A Solution to Global Problems</h3>
<hr>
<h3> What the Experts are Saying </h3> 
<p>
"A global energy network makes enormous sense if we are to meet global energy needs with a minimal impact on the world's environment"
Al Gore, as Senator, Tennessee
<p>
"Electrical interconnections between regions -- even between continents -- can and must be tackled now"
Walter Hickel, as Governor of Alaska
<p>
"The extensive international cooperation necessary would mean alternative expenditures to armaments"
Yevgeny Velikhov as VP of Russian Academy of Sciences
<p>
"The most thoughtful and scientific solution to the world's problems I've seen"
Ron Williams, Director of R&D, General Motors
<p>
<h3>A Global Challenge</h3>
<b>Inventor, scientist, and mathematician R. Buckminster Fuller asked the question:</b>
<p>
<b>"How do we make the world work for 100% of humanity in the shortest possible time through spontaneous cooperation without ecological damage or disadvantage to anyone?"</b>

<h3>Fuller Projection Dymaxion Globe</h3>
<a href="/pics/geni/genimcga/dymamcg1.gif"><IMG ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=20 SRC="/pics/geni/genimcga/dymamcg1.gif" ALT="Dymaxion Globe"></a>
<br>
To answer this question, Buckminster Fuller invented the Dymaxion (tm) globe and map.
<p>
The Dymaxion Globe has many advantages:
<br>
Unfolded, it has very little distortion and no breaks in the continental contours.
<p>
The word Dymaxion (tm) and the Dymaxion Map design are trademarks of The Buckminster Fuller Institute.

<p>

This letter was published in top left position in the 
San Diego Union Tribune's letters
section (in the North County edition, anyway) 
on June 20th, 1996, except <b>they took out the last sentence(!)</b>
and the middle paragraph (starts "I suppose...").  They must have
been short on space, right?  
<p>
I would like to clarify one section.  Where I say "I have no
sympathy..." (2nd paragraph from the bottom) I mean he should be 
treated as harshly as the legal system of the United States in able 
to do.  Thank goodness we have a reasonably good system in this
country.  Our world-wide visitors should not construe that statement
to imply that the criminal should be subject to humanitarian
outrages.  Lock him up and toss the key, at least for a long, long time.  
<p>
In the paper, the letter was titled "Young killer's past does not excuse his actions".
<hr>
<p>
Editor
<br>
Union Tribune
<br>
San Diego, CA
<br>
June 18th, 1996
<br>
To The Editor:
<p>
I think you should be ashamed of yourself for your front-page sympathy-reporting
(June 18th) of cold-blooded murderer Tony Hicks.  
<p>
Does this so-called "child/killer" really deserve a cover story, a cover picture, and a full page inside your paper?  No way!  He was fourteen for gosh sakes!  In four short years we would have let him voluntarily join the army and kill people legally.  In two years, he could drive a car, which is a lethal weapon capable of killing pedestrians, bicyclists, and other drivers.  Does some magic occur between 14 and 16 that youths should suddenly be able to learn right from wrong?
<p>
Your article drips with cries for sympathy because poor Tony was abused, deserted, ignored... All these quotes from the trial about how his mommy left him, and his daddy was in jail so poor Tony didn't get the loving that would have made him a decent human being.  Well I hate to clue you, but there are a lot of decent young human beings who come from poor, abusive families, and your attitude is an insult to all of them.  
<p>
I suppose his victim saw a poor, innocent, abused child pointing a gun at him and firing?  I suppose in Tony's eyes his victim was actually the cause of all this? 
<p>
Fourteen is quite old enough to know that the life he took was innocent.  That the life he took belonged to someone who had never done Tony any harm.  Sure, he's sorry now.  That'll be great for the parole board when he comes up for review--and if he gets out on his first try,  he'll be at the prime of life and have decades of freedom to look forward to, stolen from a pizza deliveryman.
<p>
I have no sympathy for Tony.  His past does not excuse his actions in the least.  This 90's idea of blaming others for your own faults has got to stop somewhere, at least at the end of a gun.
<p>
Maybe it's you, dear editor, who should grow up.
<p>
Sincerely,
<br>
Russell Hoffman

<h1> NPR Report incomplete </h1>
<hr>
<h3>In early December, 1993 Richard Harris reported on National Public Radio that "...NASA fired its jets to move safely away from the newest piece of space junk..."</h3>
<p>
Boy, did I get fired up over <i>that</i> headline!  I called "NPR" and made the following comment:
<p>
<i>"This report was incomplete.  It should of included that this adds one large 25,000 MPH deadly projectile to the 10,000-odd pieces NASA <b>already</b> tracks, until it gets hit by something and breaks into thousands more, and that it will fly around for probably thousands and maybe millions of years, and that NASA's best, safest, and easiest chance to bring it home was right then."</i>
<p>
I don't remember if they played my comments on the air or not, but I hope it at least got back to Richard Harris...

<h1> CNN Report Incomplete </h1>
<hr>
<h3>In February, 1996 a CNN online document reported on a space
tether experiment and all the safety features they had developed to
protect the astronauts and the space shuttle in case anything went
wrong, including "cutting away" the tether.</h3>
<p>
<b>The CNN article didn't mention the prospect of creating space debris.  
The experiment did in fact occur are relatively low altitude 
(I didn't know that at the time) so it would fall to earth 
in a few months.  However, the issue is still very important and should 
have been discussed, because objects that are in more long-term 
trajectories sometimes come quite close to earth for a portion of each 
revolution about the earth and thus, could collide with the
tether.</b>
<hr>
<i>"NASA ready in case anything goes wrong with tethered satellite"</i>,
2/19/96, online document was located at the URL given below in my
letter, but has since apparently been moved or deleted by CNN.
<p>
I emailed "CNN" with the following comment (it has been edited slightly for clarity):
<hr>
Hi!
<p>
Your article about how NASA has tried to guarantee the safety of the crew and
the space shuttle should anything go wrong with the tethered satellite--
(see URL: http://www.cnn.com/wires/TECH/02-19/space_tether/index.html) 
--completely ignored the most important problem.  The creation of a 12+
mile long string of space debris is the most important problem!
<p>
Is this string in a low enough orbit that it will fall to earth?  (That's
good if it is.)  If not, what are the plans to recover it?  HOW CAN YOU LET
NASA, THE ITALIANS, AND THE SWISS IGNORE THIS ISSUE???  DO THE MATH, FOR GOSH
SAKES!!!  Find some computer grad students with nothing better to do with
their super-computer skills (which should be easy, this is actually pretty
important stuff.)   Compare the statistics on strings flinging through space
with the statistics on "points"  (small objects) flinging through space.    
<p>
This thing is disgusting.  Not that it would or wouldn't work, but that it
hasn't been thought out from this important angle, and you guys didn't report
on it AT ALL.  
<p>
For more information, please visit my web page article I wrote last year at:
http://www.animatedsoftware.com/spacedeb/spacedeb.htm
<p>
You may publish my comments and my web/email addresses if you like.  Thank
you for your attention.
<br>
Sincerely,
<br>
Russell D. Hoffman
<br>

<br>
<hr>
I never heard from them on this issue as I recall.
<p>
However a few days later the experiment was begun, and with 12
miles reeled out--sure enough--the tether broke near the ship.  The
satellite, tether in tow, reeled away from the space shuttle at 100
miles an hour.  
<p>
This caused me to realize a second problem with tethered things in
space.  They will be <i>extremely</i> difficult to capture!  You have
to avoid, in this example, a 12 mile long flinging, extremely strong
thin rope.  (Which is probably tangled...)  
<p>
I'll bet that the severed rope will break at some point (pun intended), so 
then you have two separate problems.  One:  A rope attached to a 
bowling ball, and the other:  A rope flinging free.  Neither would be
easy to solve.  
<p>
In the first case the free end might be flinging around at a hundred 
miles an hour sometimes.  Indeed, the end of the rope might fling back 
and bang into the satellite (bowling ball) and smash it into more 
space junk. 
<p>
The ends of the other piece/pieces after it breaks the first time won't 
have the ball attached, but they might well be circling each other at 
hundreds of miles an hour.  How do resonance patterns in 6 mile 
(average) cables behave in zero-G situations?  (Frankly, this might 
be the most interesting question that might come of this experiment!  
Maybe we should go back up to look at it just because it might be 
interesting...)
<hr>
I must also add that the link to the CNN page cited above (which has 
since gone innactive) site uses as part of the address 02-19,
which I presume represents the month and day, 2/19/96, the article was posted.
But I don't see a year, which leads me to think they intend to kill this
link at the end of 1996.  (Apparently they did.)  Which, by the way, 
is DISGUSTING if true!  (It is.  It is.)
<p>
They are their own libraries.  After all, scientific journals
normally today are stored at libraries for years and years so you can
go back.  If electronic documents are to replace these things, then
surely the links must stay up!  They should NOT be moved to a deeper
vault, or (yikes!) taken offline!  Organizational methods should be
such that the link addresses can stay the same.  And, people should
not have to link to a home page but should be expected to provide
deeper, permanently linked references.  That's <i>publishing</i> on
the Web!  Shame on CNN for ever taking articles offline or moving
them!
<hr>
Since the time this was written the author has
learned that the tether experiment occurred at relatively low
altitude (around 400 miles up) and therefore is due to fall to earth
in a couple of months.  That's great news!  
<p>
I wonder why NASA didn't
test the tether with a full-weight (err, I mean full-mass) mockup on
an earlier flight--or are .5 billion dollar satellites cheap these
days??  I know they tested a shorter tether--but didn't that fail
too?  (I don't remember.  I'll try to update this when I find out the
History of Tethered Flight in Outer Space.)
<p>
Also, the tether apparently strung out in a straight line from the
satellite.  That's fascinating!  I'm not sure which way it pointed so
I'm not sure what the significance of that is, but I suspect that the
tether itself tended towards that configuration, however slightly,
and in outer space that was enough to straighten it out over some
time.  For example if it was extruded in a straight line and cooled
in a straight line it probably would have a tendancy (in outer space)
to straighten out if left alone.  Which means, of course, that every
piece of string left in space that has a tendancy, due to
manufacturing considerations, towards straightening out, will indeed
do so if left in space as a piece of space junk.  Twelve mile razor blades in
space ready to slice through anything in their path.  How exciting!
<p>
Lastly, I have considered the problem of tethers in space and suspect
that it was low frequency standing wave patterns that caused the
tether to break.  These would, on earth, dissipate due to friction. 
In space there is practically no friction.  One method to fix the
tether problem might be to create areas along its length that
bend the cable with a spring.  This would cause the standing waves to
break up at the springs, especially if each spring were of a
different strength.  The springs could be V-shaped or curly-Q's
around the tether, just so they bend it out and back a bit.  You would
need these spread out along the entire tether, perhaps every 1000
feet or so, maybe every 500.  Maybe every mile.  Anyway, the bend
would take up the force of being pulled apart by two crossing 
waves, and the springs being all different would prevent
spring-enhanced waves.  The bend in the tether would be very slight,
but whatever amount it is, you need a bigger bend or a longer moment
on the linkages the fewer tether-benders you have.  A straight line
is the shortest distance between two points, and twelve miles of
absolutely straight cable has absolutely no play in it, and therein
lies the problem (to go straight to the root of it.)
<p>
Maybe alternating--in a pseudo-random pattern, of course--thicknesses and
resiliences of wire along the tether would be a better solution.  No
bends needed...
<p>
NASA should feel free use, with acknowledgement, any of these ideas if 
they feel it will help them.  Don't know why I'm trying to suggest a way
to accomplish something that shouldn't be done in the first place,
but that's life.  Some day they can try this experiment on another
planet, just not EARTH.  We need our near-earth-orbit area to be
clean of space junk!  Don't trash the launch pad!

<br>
From:   RUSSELL DH
<br>
To:     jpl.nasa.gov
Hi!
<p>
I realize you NASA/JPL people don't like to mention the pollution you've created in outer space, but I think you have a duty to at least <i>define</i> the phrase SPACE DEBRIS in your internet glossary.  But I really think you should go quite a bit further than that and really explain it in all its horror.
<p>
And for a complete rundown on all the things you should be talking about on this important topic, please visit my web site article/transcription of a radio show on the subject of <a href="/spacedeb/spacedeb.htm">space debris</a>.
<p>
I hope you will choose to add a discussion of this important problem, or at least add a link to our discussion of it so that people can become aware and concerned about the problem of SPACE DEBRIS.
<p>
Thank you in advance for your attention to this matter.  
<p>
Sincerely,
<br>
Russell Hoffman
<br>
Host, High Tech Today
<br>
<hr>
I received a <b>challenging and well-crafted response</b> to this email.
(And much appreciated.)
<p>
Unfortunately it was from an individual at JPL and did not <i>represent</i>
NASA/JPL, so I can't publish it or credit its author here.  One point they made
was that what JPL mostly does is <i>deep space probes</i>, not the near-earth
stuff where the junk is such a problem.  Point taken.  I'm <i>for</i>
deep space probes.
<p>
The person also said they "tend to disagree" about our "obligation"
to colonize the moon and other planets.  They didn't think we are
that important in the "great scheme of things".  They thought we should use
technology to take care of and clean up earth.
<p>
A good point.  What if we each
thought about a child born 1000 generations from now and thought
"that person is me, is my direct descendant, and I want to leave a nice
place for that person" instead of the current common "this world ain't
gonna survive that long anyway" attitude that so many people have? 
Even if it isn't going to survive that long, what gives us the right to
treat that as a foregone conclusion <i>when it's our own actions</i> that
would make it happen?  And, don't create problems today that tomorrow's 
uninvented technology is expected to solve. 
<p>
But to answer the writer's other point, I say we <i>are</i> that important--kind of, anyway.  
<p>
We're important just to ourselves.  It's just
extending our fondness of our family and our friends, of our society
and our country, of our neighbors and of our world, and of our pets
and fellow creatures, into the future for hundreds of thousands of 
years and thousands and thousands of generations.  Just as the
ancient Egyptians built great pyramids for some unknown reason (maybe
to store hazardous waste!?!) so should we build for the future, and
that includes immediate exploration and colonization of other planets 
in the solar system.

Hi!
<p>
Thank you very much for the prompt and courteous email.  I would like to post it as an adjunct to the space debris article, but obviously without your name to protect your privacy!  I will bear in mind, in the future, JPL's deep-space outlook goals in my future criticisms.
<p>
I for another, would love to see more funding (if not all of it) going into deep space probes.  If you also happened to have found my review of <a href="/reviews/mine/id4.htm"><b>Independence Day</b></a> at my web site you might think I don't think we should explore other worlds or do the deep space stuff.  QUITE THE CONTRARY.  In that review I'm merely speculating that if we ever have contact with aliens, it will probably be a bad thing.    
But by all means send out the probes!  And actually, (this next sentence will probably only make sense if you read the review) go ahead and place the information I complain about on a plaque for whomever finds it.
<p>
But do it for some future humanity's sake, <i>not</i> for some unknown 'alien' who might decide that, on earth, <i>mankind</i> is the plague that needs to be eradicated.  (In other words, I could see a 'benevolent' alien race descending upon earth, looking at what's happening to the planet, 
and deciding that if they are going to leave earth alone as a viable healthy thriving self-sustaining planet, or if they are going to use it up, they will first have to eradicate the one species that is self-destructing the planet and cannot--chooses not to--live within the capabilities of the planet's ecosystem (and that includes the needless creation of space debris which is a hazard to JPL launches, I might add.)
<p>
I would be happier with more deep-space probes and less near-earth-orbit circling junk.   I'd really like to see rail launch capabilities, which would have the added advantage that launching your probes will be much cheaper once we've built it, whatever their final destination and purpose.
<p>
I think we should be sending up probes to other planets.  These probes should be 1) Capable of sustaining themselves and gathering data for hundreds of years.  2) They should not even <i>bother</i> to send signals back to earth (so sure are we that we will pick them up eventually).  and 3) They should have better probing qualities than a machine which has to involve itself with communications with earth.  
<p>
Also, we should place one or more multi-functionality base stations on the most interesting planets (eventually on all of them.)  The base stations would include communication with earth and with smaller units on the ground.  And some units would be expected to be gathered or 'found' sometime in the next millenium and we don't know when, but one thing we do know is that accurate sismic, weather, and other phenomena will be vital to future architects of space colonies. 
For example, perhaps one type of robot probe would land somewhere, gather a soil sample, and
then wait, and then gather another.  It takes samples every year for the first
ten years, every ten years for the next 100 years, every 100 years for the next
1000 years, and every 1000 years after that.  Ask ourselves:  If some
intelligent race had left a marker of some sort for us to find
<i>now</i>, what information would we hope for?  The answer is, for course:
everything.  Soil samples, air samples, average temperature, extreme
temperature, movement (if any) of the soil the probe rests on.  And
of course, if a living thing walks, runs, slithers, rolls, crawls, swims,
flys, hops or bounces past us, we want our probe to go bananas and try to
get noticed, and record the event as well.  
<p>
And I know it's --whatever-the-word-is--humancentric or something, but while I agree wholeheartedly that we are all nothing more than a blip on the cosmic chaotic nothingness that pervades our universe at an ever increasing rate, nonetheless we're all we've got, and we matter to us.  I don't have children myself, but I do so much want my species to survive and to thrive in a healthy environment, and to colonize.  
<p>
It seems to me that that's really the only reason we exist, is to keep on existing.  It's not much of a reason but it's all we've got.  It seems perfectly natural that we should want this, so natural that we shouldn't even think of anything else as the 'ultimate goal' of science and of society.  I mean, do any of us (professionals, upstanding members of society) want to leave the world --or the universe-- a worse place than it was when we arrived, seemingly out of nowhere?
<p>
And, from the individuals own self-preservation instincts (you look both ways when you cross the street) on up to the fact that all living things besides us humans also try to "take over the world" (insects would, lions would, fish would if they could breath air, bacteria would, fungus would--right?) I see nothing wrong with mankind wanting to colonize the world, or the universe.   
A duty?  I guess I was going too far there.  Nothing is making us do it.  I guess a better word would have been our instinct.  
Let's just sort of admit that a modern manifestation of our natural ingrained survival instinct is simply to try to colonize other planets.  Is that better than calling it a duty?  Because you're right, it wouldn't amount to a hill of beans anyway, but let's try.
<p>
Let me ask this:  Why do YOU want to work at JPL, what is the ultimate goal of the science the JPL does?  Just to learn?  Knowledge for the sake of knowledge?  Okay, but let me say this:  The most interesting knowledge you can scrounge up out there will be that which relates to the survival of mankind when eventually we do (and it is inevitable that we'll try) explore other worlds, and also, some of the information you gather would directly effect our survival on earth. 
<p>
For example, perhaps (to return to my favorite topic) we should be exploring in great detail just what is happening in the rings of Saturn.  Because that is space debris that has been created long ago and has <i>appeared to</i> have reached some sort of near-steady state existence.  But I'll certainly bet, as would most people I assume, that what appears to be steady is actually just a snapshot on a grandly and gradually changing orbital behavior pattern.  
That is to say, will it eventually spread out into an evenly spaced cloud of pieces no bigger than a pinhead, or will it collide and descend to Saturn's surface but remain mainly in rings?  Will this take 10 million or 100 million years, or a billion or 10 billion?  What are the landing patterns of pieces of Saturn's rings on Saturn's surface?   What is the average weight, speed, degree of tumbling, and composition of the particles?  
Are they in that peculiar pattern because they started in a collision that put them there that way (and they'll spread out), or did they float there from a more spread out position?  (I'm betting heavily on them being the result of two very nearly equally massive moons colliding nearly <i>exactly</i> head-on at incredibly enormous speed, but I don't really follow up on this stuff.)
<p>
Anyway, all that is of interest, I think, to earthlings because of the space debris we've created, which is a problem to earthlings.  And whichever planet is most likely to be inhabitable by mankind some day soon is the most interesting planet that JPL can explore, from a public-interest point of view.
<p>
Sorry this is so long, I got carried away (by aliens, I guess.)
<p>
Sincerely,
<br>

<h1> Letter to NASA regarding Space Debris </h1>
<hr>
<p>
The following letter was answered by sending me a copy of REPORT ON ORBITAL DEBRIS by Interagency Group(Space) for National Security Council, Wash. DC.
<p>
That's sort of typical of the Government, isn't it?  We did a report on it, so now the problem's been handled.

<br>
<p>
Dear R... J...:
<p>
I am sending you a letter I recently had published in my local newspaper and which I have also forwarded to our President and Vice President.  It concerns SPACE DEBRIS.  I have found that very few people are even aware that a crises exists!  
<p>
I would like to know what NASA is doing:
<p>
1)  To reduce the introduction of new space debris.
<p>
2)  To calculate the actual size of the problem now.
<p>
3)  To project what it is likely to become 50, 100, 500, 1000, 10000, and 100000 years from now if we continue behaving the way we are now.
<p>
4)  What REAL solutions is NASA considering, and what tests are being conducted to ensure that those solutions will work.
<p>
5)  Why are space shuttle flights NOW not collecting space debris, at least on a "catch as catch can" basis and coming back to earth with as full a load as possible?
<p>
A proper analysis of the problem requires complex mathematical models including chaos theory and would surely need to be done on a supercomputer.  It is probably beyond the scope of a single individual, certainly this individual, but the existence of a problem should be clear to anyone who cares to do even a brief philosophical analysis.
<p>
Thank you in advance for your attention and I look forward to hearing from you or from someone at NASA.

Sincerely,
<br>

<title> Breaking my Left Clavicle by Russell D. Hoffman</title>

<h1>Breaking My Left Clavicle!</h1>
<h3>by Russell D. Hoffman</h3>
<h4>October 23rd, 1996</h4>
<hr>
<IMG ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=2 WIDTH=138 HEIGHT=79 SRC="clavxra3.gif" ALT="">
<p>
First of all, let me tell you where your clavicle is:  it's in the
shoulder, on the upper part of the shoulder.  It's a fairly long and
fairly straight bone that runs from your neck to the edge of your shoulder. 
Also known as the <i>collarbone</i>.
<p>
One way to break it is to dive off the front of your
mountain bike and land on your shoulder with your arm at your side. 
Crunch!  Nothing came through but a lump under the skin.  
<p>
We were about three miles into the ride at 'Calaveras' and I was riding
in front.  I tend to try to go faster when I ride in front than I
would normally go, because I <i>hate</i> to be tailgated.  
I think this may have caused me to enter a short steep
downhill with excessive speed.  As you may know, I feel that
excessive speed or rather, a failure to slow down when necessary is
the #2 cause of accidents when mountain biking. Having someone behind
you who had already run up your tail once that ride, can be a real
distraction.  And distractions can be dangerous.
<p>
I should have crept over the edge so
that I didn't gain too much speed on the way down.  But instead I
entered at 5 or 8 miles an hour which was way too fast for a rider
of my capabilities.  Heck, I should have stopped and walked!  
I had done this part of Calaveras once before, about a month earlier
and was showing off the trail to two other riding buddies.
Last time, my wife walked this hill, but she was on the 
other side of the country (in Atlanta, Georgia) this time.
<p>
I was looking forward to this particular section of three or four sharp
little hills, each about 15 to 25 feet tall. The hill I bought it on was 
the smallest and first of the set, but it was also the most difficult.  
<p>
It has two very deep V-shaped ruts running along it, one in the
middle, and a much bigger one on the left side.  I might have been 
able to go down the right side instead of riding in either rut, but that 
is a bumpy and narrow ride.  The last time, I remembered 
choosing one of the ruts.  You generally can't get out of a rut 
once you are in it.  To stay balanced I had to lean to one side as I got 
near the bottom.  Sometimes leaning is the only way to stay upright and have
the wheels go where you need them to go.
<p>
This time, I went down the left rut, which gets to be about two feet deep and
very V-shaped with sharp fairly smooth sides.  Rather than riding in the 
center of the rut, which was sandy, I tried to stay up on the left hand 
wall of the rut.  As I got near the bottom of the hill, the bike slid down
into the base of the rut, which was sandy and after about three feet
of plowing through the sand with the front wheel, the wheel finally dug in
and pretty much stopped and I went over the handlebars as the bike
flipped.  I had not been far enough back on the seat--or better yet,
behind the seat.  My center of gravity was too far forward.  The
gravity of the situation was suddenly apparent.
<p>
Normally you instinctively try to get an arm out in front of you 
before you land.  If I had done this, I might have broken the arm, 
but at any rate the arm would have broken the fall. For some reason I
didn't get the arm forward and instead I landed--crunch--on my left
shoulder and on my helmet.  (Count me as one more life definitely saved 
by a helmet.)  I landed off to the left side next to the trail in the
bushes, and I think the reason the arm was still at my side instead
of out front protecting the body was that as I tried to move it up it
got knocked back by all the sagebrush and scrub as I flew threw the
air to my destination with dirt, my decimation by the dirt. 
<p>
The instant I landed I knew I had hit very, very hard and expected
that I had broken or dislocated the shoulder.  I heard two distinct
crunching sounds in rapid succession, that sounded like two small 
branches breaking, but somewhat muffled.  I continued sliding along 
the dirt for another couple of feet and stopped against some 
shrubbery.  I rolled over and sat up and as my friend yelled
down from the top of the hill "Are you alright?" I touched the
shoulder area with my other hand and could feel a bone significantly out
of place.  "No" I replied.  "I think I broke my shoulder."  I looked
around for some broken sticks to explain the two cracking sounds I had 
heard, but there were none.  That's when I knew I had a serious booboo.  
<p>
I tried to stand but felt dizzy, and in fact had to lie down for about
10 minutes as I lolly-gagged in pain.  One of my riding buddies
poured water on my head because I was sweating.  I lay on my right
side with my left arm stiff at my side.   Finally, I was able to
stand up without feeling queezy.  We put the left arm in a sling made
from the spare tube I carried and I began to walk out with someone
else taking two bikes.  This sling was repeatedly admired by the
various medical personel that attended me.  
<p>
We decided
to go to the nearest houses rather than back to the car, and one
partner rode ahead.  But when I finally got there 
and an ambulance came (and a fire truck and a K-9 police
unit, too!) everyone suggested that if it wasn't too much trouble, we
should drive ourselves over to the hospital and save some
money.  I guess I didn't look too bad at this point, having recovered my
color and balance and at least a little nerve.  Someone asked me,
which put it in no uncertain terms: "Are you tough?"  I laughed and
said "I don't know, I guess so.  I made it this far!"  and shrugged 
my shoulder--and winced in pain.  
<p>
It's amazing how many nice people you meet mountain biking!  It's
even more amazing how many nice people you meet walking out of a
mountain bike ride with a broken wing.  At least half a dozen people
went WAY out of their way to help me!  People who hadn't even seen me
were getting their neighbors and calling 911 to help. In the short walk 
out--not more than half a mile, I had help from mountain bikers, dirt 
bikers, and four-wheelers, not to mention local residents, some folks at a
nearby church, and of course my two riding buddies.  The paramedics,
firemen and police were all cool, too!  Even at the hospital the care
and tenderness of the employees was great!  If it weren't for the
little problem of the bone being broken, I would have thought I was
having a great time!
<p>
Someone gave one of us a ride around the park back to his
pickup truck and he came back and we loaded the three bikes into the
truck (I just watched) and headed to the hospital. 
<p>
It took us over two hours by the time I finally got to the hospital, 
and it was another hour before they started to treat me.  The
treatment was actually amazing.  All they did was give me some shots
in the general area and while that was taking affect, they took four
X-rays (for their own liability, I think.  And two would have been
enough but the guy missed the target.)  
My clavicle was broken in two places.  Two long ones with a short little
one inbetween them.  Ragged edges.  
<IMG ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=2 WIDTH=132 HEIGHT=139 SRC="clavxrb2.gif" ALT="">
<p>
The doctor told me
to sit up straight and move my arms as far back as I could "as if you
were standing at attention."  Back, back back.  That's good.  Now
just let me put a brace on you and we can sign your paperwork and
send you home!
<p>
That was it!  I had set the bone in place myself!  Next, I wear
the brace for about three weeks.  (I'm on day three right now.)  It
has to be tight.  Pulling your arms back makes room for the clavicle
to go back in place and it will heal itself in time--about six
weeks (three in the brace, then three more).  I've heard that in 
England they don't use the brace at all.
<p>
The first few days I thought I needed my friends to help me take off
the strap and put it back on, which I wanted to do once a day in
order to take a shower.  But then I studied the clipping mechanism
on the back and figured out how I could reach around and unstrap it
myself, making me totally independent.  I could even drive right
away, and <i>obviously</i> I'm typing...  
<p>
The following conversation did not occur, thank goodness:  "Doc, can 
I clarify one thing?  "What?"  "Will I ever be able to play the 
clavichord again?"  "Yes."  "How about the clavier?"  "Sure."  "The
clarinet?"  "Presumably."  "The clarion?"  "Don't see why not."  
"Never could before.  Can I drink claret?" "Not while you're on 
these" he said, giving me a prescription pain killer.  
<p>
<h3>Final verdict:</h3>
<h4>
"Acute mildly comminuted displaced mid left clavicular
fracture with approximately 3 cm of override.  Exam is otherwise
negative with no left AC joint separation."
</h4>
<p>
<a href="clavxra1.gif"><IMG ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=2 WIDTH=230 HEIGHT=132 SRC="clavxra2.gif" ALT=""> 158K high resolution version of this xray.</a>
<p>
<h4>November 15th, 1996 followup:</h4>
Shoulder appears (and feels) like it's healing properly--or at least 
good enough to ride again.  I hope to be off-road on my mountain bike 
again within a week or two. Every day (since the fragments fused) has 
shown some progress in reduced pain and increased strength and degrees 
of motion.  
<h4>December 18th, 1996 follow-up:</h4>
I was about to start riding again, but I happened to have a chest xray 
about a week ago and--practically by chance--the clavicle was in the picture. 
(See below.)  It looks separated to me, and when I showed it to my
General Practitioner, he agreed.  I understand that the correct shot 
on the clavicle should be from 15 degrees higher up (this is straight 
on) but this <i>does</i> show the area.  
<p>
<i>By the way: You should always try to have as few xrays as the doctors 
will let you get away with.  One generally needs even less than that! 
Combining xrays is a good thing when you can do it.  The Doctors and
dentists seldom will try to do this.  For example, I chipped a crown 
as well when I fell, but when I (finally) went to the dentist to get 
it fixed and get my teeth cleaned and checked, they first took 
one xray of the crown and then four 'regular' xrays.  I contend it 
could have been just the four, not five.  The crown was probably in 
the other four xrays.  But I didn't speak up fast enough.  Patients 
must always watch out for themselves.  You don't want any needless
xrays, but you get them all the time.   Like the saying goes, if 
xrays are so safe, why do all the medical personel hide behind a lead
wall when they take them?</i>
<p>
<IMG ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=2 WIDTH=249 HEIGHT=173 SRC="cla9612a.gif" ALT="">
I took the xray to my favorite shoulder surgeon and he tested me a bit
by seeing what forces I could oppose and decided I was fine.  That's
the best news I've heard in two months!  He said possibly the bones 
still have not <i>completely</i> fused but it appears there is enough of 
a fibrous mass around the two pieces that I have no more likelyhood 
of breaking that shoulder than I have of breaking the other one.
<p>
Nonetheless, for safety, or mental peace of mind, I bought--and
intend to use--a full chest protector.  At least for a while.  It
weighs less than a pound but it still feels a little like overkill. 
Of course, I won't feel that way next time I'm sitting on the ground
wondering why I failed to negotiate a section I'd done before...
<p>
<h4>December 21st, 1996 final follow-up:</h4>
I rode today, almost exactly two months after the accident.  I 
experienced very little shoulder pain and--surprisingly--nearly 
total confidence.  There seemed to be virtually no fear of riding.  
It was wonderful!
<hr>
<h3>To get to this ride:</h3>
<p>
Calaveras Ranch is a small area at the end of Carlsbad Village Drive
in Carlsbad, California.  Get off Interstate I-5 at Carlsbad Village 
Drive and go East.  Go about 4 miles, to the very end of that road, (formerly known as 
Elm Street) and turn right at the T junction.  Calaveras is directly in 
front of you before you make the turn.
<p>
Park in the lot of the Carlsbad Recreation Center which is on your
right.  Cross the street and enter into the park on the dirt road 
opposite the small basketball courts.  There are numerous ways down 
into Calaveras Ranch.  The highest hill is directly in front of you 
and there are several nice technical climbs up it.  Explore!
<p> 
After reaching the top, go around behind this tall hill.  There are
numerous trails and some of them are nice singletracks while others 
are fire roads.  Watch out for deep stream beds, ruts, rocks, and
everything else.  This ride is full of surprises so be careful!
<p>
There are probably 25 miles of trails in this small park only a
couple of miles across.  The trails are used by dirt bikes and 4-wheel
drive vehicles and occasionally a horse or two.  It's not a real 
pretty area (but the view from the peak is worth the climb).  
The reason I like Calaveras, aside from it being less than 5 miles 
from home, is that it has many good technical sections, a lot of 
elevation change, and some really fine singletrack.  
<p>
And if you go there and see me walking down one deeply rutted slope,
you'll know why.  I think I'll always have bad memories of that one 
little stretch.

<p>
Not long ago I decided that I wanted to try to knock two pounds off my wife's bike and one  pound off of mine, and I decided I could spend a maximum of about $500 to do it.   This number was decided upon arbitrarily, but it had something to do with a discussion over lunch about $700 cranks.  They were a fancy composite material, and knocked off a good half or 3/4's of a pound from the weight of even fairly good cranks.  Definitely trick.  
I had torn out the article about them and showed it to my wife, and we started thinking about what we could do to save weight on the bikes, and spend no more than about $500, which we figured would be the street price of the cranks.  We decided there were much better ways than buying cranks (though I still want the cranks.)  We ended up not doing all the work, instead we went all-out and bought my wife a new bike, but the exercise of figuring out what I would have done was quite useful.
<p>
It turned out to be pretty easy to come up with a better group of things to buy, and it was <i>definitely</i> a worthwhile exercise, since it gave us some rules to live by when trying to reduce bike weight.  The final result:  A <b>general grams to dollars ratio for buying lighter bike components!</b>  This ratio will be different for everyone since in most cases it depends on available money, but for this article, it came to average about 30 cents a gram.  
Before going on I must explain that the ratio varies considerably depending on where the component is situated on the bike.  I'll explain that later in the article.  We came up with 30 cents this way:
<p>
First, a really good bike, with really good components, might cost $4,000 and weight 27 pounds, which is a little over 12,000 grams (about 12,247) A pound is roughly 450 grams (453.6 is closer).  Since I wanted to knock off a total of three pounds, that's about 1350 grams altogether.  For $500.00 that's about 30 cents a gram (27 cents a gram, but close enough.)  
You could just go out and buy components using this as a ratio, but that's incomplete:  The real calculation is to decide what factor the weight savings has on the <b>handling</b>.
<p>
Good handling depends on many factors, of course.  Angles of tubes, ratios of things, and balance being a few of them.  Another important factor concerns the bike's <i>resistance to change</i>. The flywheel effect of a weight (in this case a wheel) spinning quickly (or even fairly slowly) causes that thing (the wheel) to resist change.  It does so, for those keeping track, at the square of the distance from the center of the wheel.  This means you have to work harder get it to turn.  
Also once turning it will tend to keep turning.  And finally, it will be harder to stop turning.   
<p>
The improvements we made were designed to improve weight without sacrificing stiffness or other good handling qualities of the bike.  If you have a lot of endos, you should do one thing, if you tend to run off the trail, something else may need doing.  If you can't brake well, it's something else, and if the rear end slides out from under you when you brake in a turn, that's something else altogether.   It's true: you have to become one with your bike, and only do improvements which help overall.  
But saving a little weight off a bike can make a big difference.
<p>
My wife and I ride fairly often, averaging around 50 miles a month, all of it off-road.   We began riding in 1992 and as of this writing (1996) are now on our second generation of mountain bikes (my wife's third generation bike is on order).  Since we each have fallen bad enough to end up at the emergency room (okay, just barely, nothing serious) we figure we have a pretty strong desire to stay in this sport.   In fact, one could say we are often head over heels in love with it.
<p>
Her current bike is a Cannondale M400 with a Manitou III front shock, and mine is an Answer Manitou System FS, a full-suspension frame also based on the Manitou III shock in front and a similar shock in the rear.  We were going to upgrade my wifes bike, but decided instead to get her a full suspension bike with  all new XTR components.  Since my wife will be moving up to full suspension soon, we won't actually be doing this work to her current bike.  Theoretically at least, let's proceed.
<p>
There are approximately five main kinds of weight on your mountain bike.   Each component fits into one or more of these five categories of weight, and the first thing to do is to place the component in the appropriate category.   Usually a component falls into several categories.
<p>
First, there is <b>rotational weight</b>.  That's the most important.  That would be tires, tubes, rims, spokes and hubs.  To a lesser degree, the cranks and pedals are rotational weight, but generally they rotate slower and on downhills and rough terrain, they often don't rotate at all.  Your two wheels act as two big flywheels, and if you've ever held your front wheel in your hands and then spun it, you know that it resists motion.  This is not good for handling!  
It can help a little in balance at high speeds, but that 'help' is far outweighed, I think, but the resistive element.  You need to be able to throw the bike around underneath you.  The further from the center of rotation a given weight is, the greater the effect it will have on handling.   It's importance varies with the square of the distance from the center, so clearly the most important weight you can ever reduce on your bike is in your wheels, including  spokes and even hubs.   Rotational weight savings has another advantage as well:   Your ability to change speeds is more dependent on reducing rotational weight than any other weight.  Light wheel assemblies mean you can slow down more suddenly for a technical section, and then get up to speed again quickly afterwards.  
<p>
If you consider the importance of rotational weight, one thing comes clear:  Panaracer GreenLite or some other Polyurethane inner tube is a great way to save important weight.  Even though these are five or six times the cost of a regular inner tube, the 2 to 4 ounces they save over regular butyl, even lightweight butyl tubes is very significant.  In fact, for the first $100.00 of the $500.00 we planned to spend, we bought five of these tubes.  Why five?  One of us (me) carries a spare tube.  
The spare is not rotational weight, but it is "high weight" which is also important and which I explain later.  At a grams to dollars ratio, these tubes clock in at a whopping 5 grams to a dollar, not only well under the 30 cent average we're looking for, but it's rotational weight at the far end of the rotating part (the wheel), making it the most important and cost-effective weight savings available!  
We recommend lightweight tubes to anyone who ever bought so much as one component in their life with any consideration to weight.  (You'll want to switch everyone you ride with over to them, since you need a different patch kit.)   
<p>
Get lightweight kevlar tires to complete the picture.  They are about twice as expensive as "regular" tires but it's all-important rotational weight.  Panaracer Smokes and Darts (mine are Magics) are our choice. but I don't like the lip on the edges of the Panaracer front tire.   The sharp edge of the lip makes them squirly in a turn.   
<p>
Different people with different riding styles like different tires, but everyone likes light ones.  You will too.  Hubs, being at the very center of the rotation, are not nearly as important for weight considerations, though a good hub can add stiffness and reduce weight on a suspension system.
<p>
The next most important type of weight is <b>steering weight</b> which is weight on the front of the bike, like handlebars, shifters, brake grips, bar ends, front brakes and stems.  This is a very important area for mountain bikers since again, you are constantly "throwing the bike around underneath you" and to turn the handlebars, they should be as light as possible.  
Also, lightening this area helps the bike jump up when needed when your front wheel hits a big rock.  And on steep downhills lightening this area means more of the weight is still behind the front wheel.  
<p>
Last but definitely not least lightening the "steering weight" helps you hold your course when something tries to knock the handlebars out of your hands.  Letting go of the handlebars, I contend, having studied hundreds of accidents including several dozen of my own,  is the <b>single greatest cause</b> of severe accidents in this sport. (But that's a topic for another article.)  
The further away (in a perpendicular direction) from the headset a component is, the more important the weight is.  Light barends are several times more important than a light stem is, though no barends is even better if you ask me.
<p>
The handlebar itself should be as light as possible, but it's not a good place to sacrifice strength!  I use Answer Hyperlites because they are reported to have the best test results in strength tests.  They're inexpensive (about $45.00) and they're real light.   Easton aluminum is such a wonderful thing!  
My wife, who weighs nearly half what I do, can probably be perfectly safe with a pair of the new Scott brand thermoplastic handlebars, which are even lighter than the Hyperlites, but I'll stick to Hyperlites.  Broken handlebars produce some of the nastiest accidents you'll ever see.  Figure $50 for the handlebars and save maybe 100 grams over what she's got now, which is a stock Cannondale handlebar.  $.50 cents a gram. Not 30 cents, but close enough since it's turning weight.
<p>
The third most important type of weight is <b>unsuspended weight.</b>  That would include all of the wheels, which are also of course, rotational weight.  Unsuspended weight also includes any components attached to the wheel side of your suspension.    It is important to reduce unsuspended weight because when you bounce over rocks and ruts, this weight goes ballistic, literally.  It flys through the air with a life of it's own and that's not good for single-track-minded riders.
<p>
On an unsuspended bike all the weight is, of course, in this category, and on a front-suspension bike like my wife's, the weight <i>closest</i> to the unsuspended rear is largely unsuspended weight.  On her bike, as you get further toward the front of the bike, a smaller and smaller percentage of a given component's weight is unsuspended weight.  Unsuspended weight is important, though not nearly as important as turning weight and rotational weight.  
The brakes, the skewers, and the suspension fork crown are all unsuspended weight even on a full-suspension bike.  Skewers are a cheap place to save weight.  A pair of "lightweight" quick-release skewers can save around two ounces off stock ones.  Salsa makes some nice steel front/titanium rear ones with excellent high-leverage handles.  
Some people feel that titanium skewers are less rigid than steel ones, which is most important in the front, hence the combination.  And rigidity <i>is</i> basically a good thing.  At a cost of about $50.00 for steel skewers, good ones are above the agreed-on 30 cents a gram, but since it's fairly important <i>unsuspended weight</i> <b>and</b>, for the front skewer, it's also <i>turning weight</i>, we think they're worth it.  
<p>
Next there is <b>high weight</b> which is weight that is high above the ground.  High weight includes first and foremost, the seat and the seat post, since these are indeed the highest part of most mountain bikes, though sometimes the stem and headset are a little higher.   The importance of this weight is that as you get further above the base of the bike, a partial loss of balance of the bike becomes harder to fix.  
Imagine a five pound weight on a pole that ran vertically straight up the center of the bike.  As you move that weight up the pole it will become more and difficult to correct the bike's balance, eventually (if you had a tall enough pole) the weight would always topple the bike and not even Hercules (in New York) could keep the bike up.  That's <i>really high weight</i>, but the next best (real) thing is the seat and seat post.  
Short people can cut most seat posts with a hack saw (be sure to debur it afterwards) and still have a safe amount inside the seat tube (at least four inches is normally recommended, but I'm not making recommendations here-ask a local expert.)  The seat post should be aluminum or titanium, and the seat kevlar with titanium rails.  We figure to save nearly a pound on my wife's bike for about $200.00 for the seat and the seat post.  
Grams to dollar ration: about 40 cents a gram.  Close enough since it's high weight.
<p>
The next type of weight is, for lack of a better term, <b>jiggling weight</b>.  A lot of people might not consider your tool kit to be a component, but if you wouldn't leave home without it, it's a component.  And if it is sitting in a bag that can bounce around, or if it can bounce around inside of the bag, you have jiggling weight.  Try to stop jiggling weight from jiggling if possible.  Jiggling weight is bad, because it's essentially unpredictable.  
It makes your bike do seemingly random movements of it's own.  You may not recognize it, but it's there.  I lost two ounces of jiggling weight when I opened my pack and realized I didn't need to carry a separate spoke wrench, since most multipurpose tools have a spoke wrench built into them.
<p>
The last type of weight is basically anything that doesn't fit into any of the other categories, which I call <b>dead weight</b>.  It's anywhere you can find that weight can be saved for a fair price.   Generally the further from the bike's bottom bracket a component is, the more important it's dead weight factor is.   The rear brake, the water bottle cages,  and the front derailer are all dead weight.  
The anti-chainsuck thing if you have one and the seat post quick release are also examples of dead weight.  Dead weight should be removed if it's cost-effective to do so.
<p>
If we did all the work, my wife's bike would be about two pounds lighter than it is now, and mine will be over a pound lighter.  Does this make a difference?  On a 27 pound bike, one pound is nearly 4% of the weight.  Unless you do something strange, that means the bike is probably going to be <i>at least</i> 4% easier to handle.  If the weight is in the right places, like rotational weight, it will make an even greater difference.  
The changes we've made so far have improved handling significantly already.  If we find $1400.00 we don't know what to do with, we'll save a little more weight by buying two pairs of those composite cranks.  But until then, these are the next best thing, and doing these calculations provided us with a guide to what would be worth doing.
<p>
All of these calculations about weight make the assumption that you have already lost all the weight off your body that you can.  And a few other big assumptions as well, but at least these are some things to consider when trying to perform weight savings on your mountain bike.

<title> A Mountain Biker's Opinion of Shimano's new V-Brakes </title>
</header>
<body>
<hr>
<h1> A Mountain Biker's Opinion of Shimano's new V-Brakes </h1>
<hr>
<p>
<a href="/mtnbikes/mtbpark.htm"><IMG ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=5 WIDTH=95 HEIGHT=149 SRC="/pics/mtnbikes/flaminb1.jpg" ALT="Our MTB Park logo"></a>
<p>
V-Brakes are Shimano's newest braking system.  Many people compare
them to hydraulic systems, but I find that I like the feel of them
better.  Hydraulic systems have tended to feel mushy to me.  V-brakes
are crisp and reliable, and sensitive to variable input.
<p>
V-brakes are so good at stopping you, I think for beginners they can actually be considered
<b>dangerous</b>--for the first few months.  NOT like, lawsuit
territory (I hate those things), but like, someone should caution you 
that for the first 100 miles or so, <i>pay attention</i>!  The front 
thumbscrews should have an <i>even lighter</i> setting!  I'm not a beginner, but these things are still
kinda scary! 
<p>
And I <i>don't</i> like the way the front cable comes out way off to the side--what if a
tree branch or vine catches it?  I'll tell you what can happen then: You might find yourself
braking <i>really hard</i> with the front wheel only, for no apparent reason. 
This is a lot worse than that same branch hitting your handlebar or
(ouch) your hand.  It's really a serious defect, and I hope they come
up with a solution.
<p>
But make no mistake about
it: V-Brakes are the greatest thing since <i>acceleration</i> was
invented!  The defects mentioned here must be regarded in the overall
viewpoint.  My first 40 miles or so on V-Brakes consisted of some of the
wickedist downhills here in San Diego and near Fresno. The hard test 
results are clear:  V-Brakes are a nearly perfect braking system. 
And my wife's got them on <a href="/pics/family/slhsuprv.gif">her new bike</a> and feels the same way.
<p>
They're even great on steep uphills:  When the hill finally beats you
and you need to lock up your brakes, poof!
They are LOCKED!  And with so little effort!  I love my V-Brakes!
<p>
...I have had the V-brakes for about six weeks now, (and probably 
over 100 off-road miles) and have set them to
have the rear brake thumbscrew turned all the way to maximize
leverage, and the front brake thumbscrew on the original "novice"
setting because I think you get more control--at the cost of needing
more finger force--with that setting.  It's less mushy, and since you
normally  modulate the front and hold a steadier force with the rear brake,
this seems to be the appropriate setting.   I have also seen some
other V-brake riders with this setting.  Try it yourself!
<p>
A world of caution in a word of caution: I think everyone who uses
V-brakes should expect to go over the 
handlebars at least once.  I've done it--on purpose.  I had gone too
fast, (which in this case was probably 15 mph) on a fairly steep downhill.   
I hadn't looked far enough ahead (a common cause of accidents).  
<p>
I had to hop the front
wheel over a small ditch that ran nearly perpendicular to my path, 
but when I got to the other side, I realized I didn't have time to 
avoid an even bigger ditch right in front of me that ran parallel 
to my direction!  I was headed straight for a nasty crash into a
rocky ditch about a foot deep...  So instead, I purposely slammed on the
front V-brake, and flipped over the handlebars.	 
<p>
I landed next to the ditch, and the only really scary part was that
one foot got caught in the clip's strap and got a little twisted.  
(I haven't graduated to clipless because one of my riding buddies, 
who has, still fails to clip out at least once a ride.)
<p>
The shale hurt, and cut up my thigh a bit, but
the real hassle was that a week later the ocean waves had 8 foot faces and
so I went swimming, and the wounds got infected.  The good news is, you
don't have to stop riding while you wait for that to cure, you just
have to stop swimming.
<p>
V-brakes are a wonderful way to stop, and <i>great</i> for emergency
over-the-handlebar maneuvers..

<title> Rambling Statement of Purpose of the Mountain Bike Park Proposal!</title>
</header>
<body>
<hr>
<h1>Mountain Bike Park: Statement of Purpose (more or less):</h1>
<hr>
<p>
<a href="/mtnbikes/mtbpark.htm"><IMG ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=5 WIDTH=95 HEIGHT=149 SRC="/pics/mtnbikes/flaminb1.jpg" ALT="Our MTB Park logo"></a>
<b>Pre-ramble:</b>
<p>
Mountain Biking is the greatest of all human sports.  It utilizes
some of the
most complex and technical industrial wizardry ever designed by
mankind, designed by some of the the best brains the world has to
offer.  
<p>
It does this in order to allow a lone
human body to perform at it's ultimate best, combining balance,
strength, forethought, fitness, training, and good sense.  
<p>
It returns to the rider the
<i>real</i> ultimate 'driving' experience.  No motor. No hard shell.
No noise.  Two wheels.  No daydreaming.  You never think about your 9-5 when
you're mountain biking.
<p>  
You ride as though you, your bike and the mountain are all one, 
like a feather falling through a cloud.
<p>
You do this at thirty or forty 
miles an hour down the side of a steep rocky mountain.  You are at
peace.  Yet you must remain constantly, ultimately, utterly and
totally in control.  
<p>
Mountain biking is a sport with 
incredibly low environmental impact and our lift wouldn't
substantially change that.  
<p>
It is more fun than any
rollercoaster--it's like a rollercoaster, buy you get to design your
own track (or rather, you get to decide what forces and what speeds
the track is safe for, today.)
<p>
It's like pool--you have to study the angles and think
about the flow of kenetic energy through the system.  
<p>
It's like a
race where you can pick a good line and maintain an easy lead on your
buddy, or you can pick a bad one and he ends up going first.  
(Buddies are people that like to ride with you, not people that like
to race you.  But still, the fastest guy goes first in a group.  He
then stays just out of reach of the next person, and so on.)
<p>
It's like flying an airplane since you have to think in three
dimensions and you are constantly trading speed for altitude and
vice-versa, and it's like flying a helicopter because you have to use
<i>all</i> your arms (and fingers) and feet virtually all the time,
and you have to keep your head on a swivel to read all the terrain
information you're getting, and keep a proper distance between your
fellow riders in front and behind, and so on.
<p>
Mountain biking is the greatest sport ever because it encourages you to give up
all alcohol, all excess weight, and all sorts of other things that
are bad for you, because cleaning up your act makes you ride better. 
Baseball players don't have much to worry about if they can hit the
ball.  Football players often want to gain weight.  Bikers tend
towards veggie sandwiches and coffee.  
<p>
Mountain biking is much more accessible than Hang Gliding, Rock
Climbing, Parachuting, and Bungee Jumping.  Nearly everyone knows how
to ride a bike.  (These hills, of course, would <i>not</i> be the
best place to learn!)
<p>
Mountain biking is hot now because technology has made it possible. 
I know there are still a lot of people out there riding hard tails. 
<p>
But the facts are: 
Great minds have made modern bicycles that are awesome, and that make
this sport <i>phenomenally</i> fun.  24 gears really are nice.  $600
wheels really handle <i>much</i> better.
Those guys that took the financial risks and designed and manufactured 
great suspension systems, great brakes, great rims, great skewers for gosh
sakes--the people that make these things are our heros!  I see it as
only fitting that we should take these joyous toys they gave us, and
thrash them against the gnarliest hillside we can design!
<p>
<hr>
<H3>Statement of Purpose</H3>
<p>
Bearing the things in the Pre-ramble in mind, 
our goal is to design the ultimate set of
singletrack courses.  We want to be able to observe the world's
greatest riders riding the world's greatest trails, and then ride
those same trails ourselves.  We want trails that were built for the
tremendous kenetic energy control you get on your bike.  Great
Whoop-dee-doos, great banked curves, great everything.  Trails that
force you to shift like crazy.  Trails you can go down the entire trail
and neither pedal nor brake (mathematically at least, such a think
<i>is</i> possible.)  Great stuff you could NEVER get on a trail built for 
hikers, horses, skiers or fire trucks.
<p>
For example, imagine a parabolic hill that curves 
up over the top in a parabolic shape, if viewed from the side. 
<p>
It would feel nearly weightless--or even weightless--for what will seem
like an eternity.  What is a parabolic hill good for?
<p>
When I was a young boy we had a bump like that, which my mom would
drive over at speed, and we would all be nearly weightless for a second.  
She would actually slow down when we were behind a car when we
approached the bump, so that she could speed up and take the hill
at the proper speed to have fun.  
<p>
We called it "The Gaa Bump" because
that's what it made us say when it happened.  And that was a small
asphalt one that just crossed a little stream, maybe just one or two carlengths
from beginning to end.  Just a nicely designed bump that the whole
family could--and did--love.  
<p>
Anyway, this is what a parabolic hill can do--but in 1996, picture one that 
is four or five times bigger than the one I just described, and made of
singletrack, and that in order to do it at the right speed,
you come down a long speed-gaining straight decent on a full
suspension mountain bike, instead of in 1960 when you're 5 years old,
sitting in the back of your parent's 1950 Ford sedan?   
Cool rides are hard to find.  The best ones are thoroughly memorable.  
<p>
<b>The purpose of the park is cool rides</b>.  It's not training, it's
not renting, it's not that it's a mecca for racing, though it should
have all those things.  It's cool rides. 
Trails designed by expert mountain bikers, for all mountain bikers. 
<p>
Trails with logs.  Trails with rocks.  Trails without logs and rocks. 
Trails which knock your socks off.  
Trails that twist.  Trails that climb.  
Trails with twists you never imagined, because all you ever
saw before were fire roads, and hiker's trails, and maybe a few
coyote trails (those were nice, weren't they?)
<p>
<hr>
<p>
Aerial lifts have one of the lowest impacts on the environment, worse
only than tunneling might be (theoretically).  Once the lift system is in
place, one of the beauties is that it does not obstruct wildlife from
crossing underneath it.  That means wildlife corridors can be
maintained.  
<p>
This idea REALLY needs your support.  Please 
<a href="/mtnbikes/mtbemail.htm">send us email</a>
and tell us you like the idea and
would visit such a park if the prices were fair.  We're going to try
to do the rest, and we'll let you know what happens--whatever
happens--on these web pages.  THANKS FOR READING THIS!

Hey Russell,
<p>
Was just surfing the net and thought I would give my nodding approval. 
I know this idea would be great - I am from St. Louis, MO - You know the
Rams's new home.  Anyway I am doing MOAB this year and if I knew there
was a MTB park I would definitely show up for a few days of my vacation
along with a few buddies.  Our mtb facilities in the St. Louis are
pretty nice but they are always shared with other groups - hikers -
horses and what not.  Thats not so bad, but a full blown MTB park only
would be great - Safety would be the biggest factor for the insurance,
and staffing the park with trained medical personel would cost a pretty
penny.  I don't agree with the other guy who said you don't need the
magazines and the pro's, however, I think you would need to get major
manufacturers involved to help with costs - that should not be a problem
considering they would have a lot to gain.  If it could be done - It
would do everybody involved in mountain biking a lot of good.
Oh yeah we want the Lakers now!!!
<p>
Thanks

Hi!
<p>
Thanks for your letter which I will immediately post at the website (without your full name and email address, of course)  You sum a lot of the issues up in a brief paragraph.
<p>
Keep Riding!
Russell Hoffman 
<p>
P.S. I moved to San Diego, California five years ago from Connecticut, so I was just getting used to being a Raiders/Lakers fan after following New York teams all my life, and then they all moved! I'm left with liking the Chargers and the Padres, neither of which I'm finding very easy.  I never had a chance to care about the Rams, but since Jeff Hoestatler came from New York, it was relatively easy to become--a fan of the Raiders?--no, but just to become somewhat more interested in them. 
I would never admit to being a fan of the 'bad boy' Raiders.  
<p>
It is thus <b>pure coincidence</b> that the only pro football game I've ever attended was a Raiders game.  My wife and I were next to the stadium having finished visiting the L.A. museums in about half the time we had devoted to them.  (They're not very good.)  We kept hearing these loud cheers--incredibly loud--and after the second or third one, I decided we better wander over and see what's up.  (The stadium and the museums are both at Exposition Park.)
<p>
Everyone was pretty much seated by then so the cops outside the stadium outnumbered everyone else by about two to one, but one of the few 'civilians' whispered those magic words "need tickets?" and since I hadn't said anything, I figured I could always plead entrapment.  I ended up having scalped 11th row on the 40 yard line at a nearly sold-out play-off-game-deciding come-from-behind everyone-stays-to-the-end victory!  And paid less than face value too because the game had already started.  
Apparently he wasn't much of a scalper anyway, they were his family's season tickets but whenever no one could go, he'd take them down and sell them since he hates football. 
<p>
Sorry for the rambling, but you DID mention L.A.--I mean ex L.A.--sports teams!

This email came in recently.  My response is first, then the original letter.
<hr>
<p>
Hi!
<p>
Thanks for the letter.  It's FULL of good ideas!  I'll post it at the web site so poeple can think about these things.  Without your name of course, to protect your privacy.  (I'm trying to be a clearinghouse of information as well as a whatever to get the idea going in the first place.)  
<p>
The idea is that we have to answer each of your (and everybody elses) questions about safety and everything, so by being totally open about it, I think the answers will come.  Maybe, for example, an insurance guy will contact me and say "yeah, it can be done.  Here's how..."
<p>
Keep in touch, 
<br>

It's a great idea. I'd be the first on line to ride and probably the first 
at your employment desk. (although I doubt you'll *need* much network 
engineering at a MTB resort)
<p>
I think you'll have more business than you can handle if you can create a 
professional resort. A guided tour over favorite local trails has been 
done many many times and most folks can't justify spending cash to ride 
where the locals ride for free, so this would have to be like a 
Ski-resort operation, well groomed, well mapped, well marked, plenty of 
facilities, parking, and lodging. Also modified lifts that go high enough 
for a long ride down, and DH specific trails for the gravity set. These 
should be blocked off by attendants who would make sure there's good lead 
time between riders and folks don't get in over their heads, and perhaps 
have a minimum bike & armor requirement. A trail difficulty rating system 
should be used as well. A medical facility is also a must as is trained 
EMS people and a good way to get injured people down from the mountain. 
The trails would also have to be patrolled to spot bad crash victms, lost 
riders and people doing stupid things like leaving their bike in the 
middle of the trail or throwing rocks or whatever.
<p>
A good night life would also be an added attraction. You might even want 
to consider something for riders with families that don't bike. ie Slow 
flat tours, a skate board half pipe, a rollerblade rink a pool, a 
nursery.
<p>
Bike repairs is a far more difficult matter than it seems. If someone 
crashes after they've had their bike serviced at the resort they may try 
to use that as a basis for a law suit. You would have to have well 
trained mechanics and a critical function checklist for every bike 
serviced, rental or owned. Also one *heck* of a waiver for folks with 
their own bikes. After all no one has *ever* shown up at vale with a set 
of HUFFY skis, but you can bet their bikes will be all over your resort.
<p>
The insurance companies may not be as "friendly" to your idea as they are 
to ski resorts so be prepared for a big battle there.
<p>
The lift process is another interesting matter. You have the opportunity 
to make this a better deal than the ski resorts. By that I mean, with out 
the high anxiety of getting on and off a moving platform. Consider a team 
of operators, two to load the bikes, one to seat the people, one to run 
the lift. All on each end. Or perhaps a clutch system that unhooks the 
chair at the ends so folks have time to load and unload. Whatever the 
means it has to be secure otherwise you'll end up buying a bike for 
someone every day.
<p>
Speaking of security, a means to lock-up unattended bikes is an absolute 
must. Bike theft is much higher than ski theft. I'd recommend having an 
attendant like at a coat check or at least one person watching the rack 
with a rule "No working on bikes on or near racks" to keep people from 
stripping parts off of locked bikes.
<p>
A music system in the main compound would be a nice thing also. Drinking 
water should be *very* available on the trailside as well as the main 
compound. (and don't even THINK of charging for it)
<p>
While I'm brain storming how about various levels of lessons, I found 
that a great help when I skied at Killington.
<p>
Well, this started out as a letter of support now it's a wish list. Let 
me know what you think and what you do. I'm very interested.

This email was in answer to my email announcement of the idea for the park.  My response (in part) follows...
<hr>
<p>
<br>
| I am proposing a year-round mountain bike park, which is substantially like a
<br>
| ski resort but with NO SKIING.  I have built a web page to describe the
<br>
| concept and all the advantages it would have, and am talking to bike
<br>
| manufacturers, magazines, trail designers, local politicians, and the U.S.
<br>
| Bureau of Land Management.  Target is the Los Angeles area.
<br>
<p>   
Russell, I love the idea, but a few comments:
<p>
(1) why talk to any of the people you mentioned above? Talk to 
    your potential customers, and potential investors. Develop
    a business plan, get financing, find some appropriate sites,
    buy/lease one, and go!
<p>
(2) liability insurance is probably your biggest obstacle; get an
    attorney to work on that aspect of the business plan.
<p>
(3) forget the manufacturers' booths; to be able to hold user fees
    to an acceptable level, you'll probably want to leverage the
    revenue from (1) your on-site bike shop (retail sales, service)
    (2) "Pro Shop" (rentals, instruction) and (3) food service (do
    you ever finish a hard ride where you're not starving?!).
<p>
    And make sure you incorporate tandems into all the aspects of
    your plan. They're hot right now, not to mention way fun, but
    most people wouldn't put out the money to buy one unless they
    first have an opportunity to ride one. And you'll encourage 
    more usage if you have a variety of rentals (both singles and 
    tandems) so people can try before they buy. And sell what you
    rent.
<p>
(4) "could become a mecca for mountain bike racing"? How about,
    "start with"??
<p>
    Launch the facility by having a pro race, so the public can 
    come in afterward and ride the very same course that Furtado, 
    Overend, Tomac, etc., just rode. Special promotional T-shirt,
    water bottle, whatever, for the first week. 
<p>
(5) Frequent Rider/season passes/Kids-Ride-Free programs.
<p>
(6) Onsite child care (probably a Phase II enhancement).
<p>    
I could probably ramble on some more, but I've gotta get back to my
"real job", at least for a little bit  :-)
<p>
FWIW, and best of luck!
<p>
And don't hesitate to call me if you'd like to brainstorm on this -
even though I don't live in the LA area, I'd love to see something
like this succeed.
<p>
H*
<p>
<hr>
What follows is part of my second emailed response.  
If virtually the entire community supports the idea, it can
happen.  Whether it's me or someone else that does it is
irrelevant--we all simply want it.  
I don't know if it will be me that pulls it off, but this idea is
workable.  Someone will follow this plan or one very much like it and do
it, especially if everyone simply shows their support for it.  
<hr>
<p>
Hi again!
<p>
I wanted to respond to some of your other points as well, for example the
first one--why talk to those people?  Actually, the way I see it, there won't
be any investors without a proven community interest.  Hence talking to the
magazines.  I need pros to agree to build "signature" trails, but I haven't
talked to any yet.  (Remember, this is Friday and this all started Monday
night a little after midnight (tuesday morning then, really.)  I'm sure I can
get a few to do it, there are lots of them.  Of course I want Tomac, Juli
Furtado, Hans Rey, Ned Overend, Missy Giove... But even if I don't get
them, I'll get someone.  I've talked to manufacturers that sponsor big names,
and they like the idea, so I'll get the names when I need them.  
<p>
But financing, everyone admits that's the tough part.  The proving ground.
But the way I figure, someone out there has the land.  I got one step away
from it today, for example, and who knows, that problem might actually
already be solved (the guy didn't get back to me yet...)  Financing will
occur when I've proven to enough people that it can happen, and that it just
needs financing.  At that point, it will be a worthwhile investment and will
get started.  So I'm out looking for land, and finding out who's interested.
Seems almost everyone is interested! 
<p>
Really, I think the most important thing is to prove that the entire mountain
biking community knows about it, and backs it.  That's why I need the emails
from people so badly!  If everyone knows about it, and supports it, then why
would anyone try to build it without me?  <i>(I'm so naive--Ed.)</i> 
And someone out there, will have
money and hear about it and offer a fair investment strategy.  Hopefully!
<p>
On to other parts of your letter:  The onsite bike shop comments seem
correct.  That will be like a "pep boys" of bike shops.  Big, real good at
changing tires, has every part and every tool imaginable.  Work bays
for rent as well, with good tools and stands in the bays.
<p>
>>"could become a mecca for mountain bike racing"  how about Start With?
<br>
Sounds right to me!
<p>
>>Frequent Rider/season passes/Kids-Ride-Free program.
<br>
Also, a service wherein a skilled and experienced rider will ride with you
and bring your kid in a caboose, for a fee.  (Certain trails only.)

Subj:	SUPPORT OF THE RESORT IDEA
<br>
 Date:	96-08-08 14:36:57 EDT
<br>
<p> 
 I think the idea is meritable, but this place has to be the cat's rear end to 
 be really accommodating.  I could foresee three groups of people that 
 would come out to ride an "amusement park".  One: that wants to ride the 
 latest greatest trail. The second would be those who want to experience 
 MTB in an MTB environment (afraid to leave the crowd behind). And those 
 that have no idea about the sport but get caught up in the hype of T.V. 
 commercials.  Now, what might these groups mean as far as the layout is 
 concerned.  Group one will ride it even if there is no "park", which 
 means: they could care if there are few if any creature comforts.  The second 
 group needs to justify themselves standing/riding in the middle of the 
 woods by hanging out with a bunch of other riders so they can learn more 
 about the finer points of style.  But, the third group they are the terra 
 cotta, the impressionable masses, these are the people that if treated 
 right will do anything for the sport.  Although, after writing this 
 I think there is another group those that want to ride for free.  Please 
 respond with any comments this note may give rise to. This is not a soap 
 box for my opinion of mountain biking, just looking at it from the 
 perspective that I stumbled into MTB and have been a member of each of 
 those groups.  Nowadaze I just ride.

Hi!
<p>
Thanks for the great letter.  I think I'll post it soon in the letters section (without your name, of course, to protect your privacy) as it brings up a number of important points. 
It's just the kind of dialogue I'm looking for to get the idea developed.  First we have to figure out what might work.  Then we get someone to pay for it.  Then we ride it.
<p>
Thanks again,
<br>
Russell Hoffman

My response is first, then the original letter.
<hr>
Hi!
<p>
I really enjoyed reading your email...  You provide some interesting facts and make a lot of good points.  I'm not sure I can answer them all, so I'm going to just post it at the web site (without your name or email address, of course, to protect your privacy) and see if someone else will give us some answers to your comments.
<p>
I can tell you this:  I'm in a pretty similar demographic group as you, but I am lucky to have an mtb'ing wife and several 30-whatever mtb neighbors (I'm also the old man in the crowd at 40).  And of course in Southern California there is riding all year 'round (that is, when one is not injured) It's a charmed life.  I mean, it would be if I hadn't made that unscheduled dismount three weeks ago!
<p>
Sincerely,<br>

Hi Russell!  Great idea.  I hope you're successful.<br>
I just have a few thoughts to pass on.<br>
<p>
<b>General:</b><br>
If your park was within a 45 minute drive from my home, I'd ride it 
every week. A per visit cost of $5 to $10 would be reasonable to me, 
however, I'm not like most of the guys I ride with. Me: 37, own 4 bikes, 
a house in the 'burbs, 2500+ miles a year (in MN), and a decent income. 
The rest of the guys I ride with: twentysomething, one bike (cost more 
than their car), an apartment (shared), a job, but only to support their 
MTB addiction.  These guys live to ride, and could be the hard-core 
repeat business that you would need, but I doubt they would or could pay 
to ride at a park more than occasionally.   
<p>
<b>Demographics:</b><br>
I just read in Bicycling that the average serious cyclist is a 41 year 
old male with a $50,000+ income.  I see a lot of these on the road, but 
few on singletrack.  I think that you might need a fairly detailed 
demographic study to identify a target market that would be 
interested in riding an MTB park (many) and willing to pay enough to 
make it a success (fewer).
<p>
<b>Sponsors:</b><br>
Do you have any plans to have paying sponsors help with the initial 
costs?  How about celebrity "partners" for the exposure?
<p>
<b>Events:</b><br>
Maybe a unique event could provide significant revenues to keep the 
rider fees attractive?  In Wisconsin, the Chequemegon Fat Tire Festival 
in September attracts, and is limited to 2500 riders for a 40-mile 
point-to-point race. The 1997 race will sellout in November '96. The 
festival, and the revenues it generates ($100,000 in fees plus 
significant sponsor contributions) provides a nice living for the 
individual that runs it.  There's always room for another well-run 
unique festival!
<p>
Take care & keep pedaling.

This email was in answer to my email announcement of the idea for the park.  My response follows...
<hr>
<p>
Sounds great! Who do I make my check out to? So. Cal. would be perfect loc.
for a dedicated year round training facility for all MTB disciplines.
Slalom, DH, etc. Maybe this could help us compete w/ the Euros. The east
coasters still haven't discovered what an inexpensive & great  MTB winter
getaway LA or So. Cal. is. 
<p>   
I see your in the 619. Have you ever done the Julian 7500? I have (11 hours
of fun & flowers).
<br>
Stay upright,
<br>
P*
<p>
<hr>
What follows is my emailed response.  
<hr>
<p>
Hi!
<p>
Thanks for your feedback about the MTB proposal.   My accountant says to
hunker down for the long haul--this could take years.  But then, I probably
(possibly/maybe?) could close a deal on a 50 acre site this week with 700
feet elevation change AND possibly--financing.  But I was really hoping for
more--a lot more.  I don't think it can be done on that size area.  But I'm
going to try to look at it anyway.  
<p>
I've had suggestions ranging from finding an Indian tribe which would
allow it on their reservation to using shuttle buses instead of a ski lift...
If it isn't GREAT, the pros won't get involved, and no one will bother to
come back.  So, the #1 priority is to secure a big area with lots of
elevation change and have it be close to a major city.  
<p>
I like your idea of thinking of it as a "dedicated training facility".  Also,
you're right about LA being a great vacation spot anyway for East Coasters,
especially in winter, and they really don't know it.  AND we need a mountain
bike park that would allow us to compete with Europe--our atheletes need it,
especially now that MOUNTAIN BIKING IS AN OLYMPIC SPORT!  (exhibition, at
least, this year.)
<p>
So thanks again for your feedback and I'll keep you informed...  
<p>
Sincerely, 
<p>
Russell Hoffman
<p>
P.S. We haven't done the Julian 7500.  I don't think I'd survive!  For me, I
think a 3000 foot climb in a day is about all I could survive.  We do 1200
foot climbs and 15 mile rides all the time, so probably triple that would be
about the limit of our endurance, I would guess.  We ride so we can ride
more, but our 9-5's keeps getting in the way of our training!

The email I received which prompted this response appears below, and was in answer to my email announcement of the idea for the park.  
<hr>
Hi!
<p>
Thanks for sending me your comments.  I've taken some time to answer them, so
I hope this letter doesn't bore you!!
<p>
First off, concerning your comments about the substrate being much more
yielding in the case of skiing, this is certainly true.  But I think these
issues are covered under general laws that allow people to do inherently
dangerous things without unneccessary liability.  Everyone tries to make
good, safe bikes, and sooner or later virtually any part can fail.   All
riders will have to indicate acknowledgement of this fact.  As to the fact
that falling "HURTS"--you bet it does!   Even just falling to the side at
dead slow and landing on your hip, creates welts and bloodblisters and
bruises that can be several inches in diameter and can last for weeks.  I
wear kneepads, elbow pads, padded gloves, and a helmet.  Next I think I'm
going to get hip pads.  What's your point?  Won't that happen anyway, on my
hills just as much as anywhere else?  At least if something serious, like
arterial blood flow, happens, we have spotters and solar powered call boxes
and so on, and even first aid packs you would be required to carry with you
at all times.
<p>
I thought you might be interested to know that I have, in four years and
several thousand miles of off-road mountain biking with my wife and friends,
have only been to a ski lift place one weekend.  The rest of the time, we
have always earned every downhill with it's uphill.  We have never even left
a car at the bottom and at the top, though we keep talking about trying that
at Nobel Canyon.  Everyone says it's nearly impossible to do up, and tougher
riders than me go up the road instead...
<p>
So my point, of course, is that I've really come from your side and
personally, I love uphills.  Our favorite rides are three or four local 1200
foot climbs and we do them in an hour and a half at least once a week.  20
minutes or less of downhill after well over an hour of uphill.   I really
can't believe I'd bother to do that if I didn't realize a pleasure in
uphills, even gruelling steady--I-will-beat-you-someday--hills.  The best the
local 25 mile circumference has to offer.
<p>
I just don't think this negates the usefulness of the park.  Not only would
experienced riders like you and I occassionally have fun on it on our own
bikes, but the vast legions of people who really JUST DON'T GET IT can try
the sport on our beginner slopes and have a blast doing it.  The rental bikes
would vary in quality for people that want to try different bikes and can
afford different price ranges. (Every bike would probably have full
suspension, though.)
<p>
Also, the trails would be specially designed by famous mountain bikers to be
especially fun.  They would all be one way, and they would almost all be
downhill, but a few would be uphill-only trails, both steep and difficult
ones and easier ones.  But face it:  a four thousand foot climb is a lot of
work.  We do 1200 foot climbs in an hour or so, and two years ago this was an
all-day thing.  Now it's an evening pleasure.  But 4000 feet?  We're in our
late thirties, and we would have to quit our jobs and train every day to do
much better than we're doing, so sometimes, just getting the payback would be
cool.  <i>(And it </i><b>is</b><i> payback:  has anyone ever left a car at the top
of a hill so they didn't have to ride down?)</i>
<p>
Lastly, I had planned from the beginning to have the trails contain uphill
sections, with the total uphill being, from say, 400 feet on one trail, and
2000 feet on another.  They would do this in part by utilizing the uphill
trails to connect sections.  Most trails will have uphills that you are
supposed to scrub speed off on, of course, to slow the trail down without
getting technical.  Others will be technical.
<p>
A lot of work will go into this park and your continued feedback would
certainly be appreciated.  Thanks again for your previous comments.
<p>
Sincerely,
<br>
Russell Hoffman

original transmission follows:
<br>
Russell,
<br>
Well, I'm not going to give you much encouragement.
In my case, what I like about mountain biking is going out into the 
woods, getting a good workout, etc.  My mountain biking has little in 
common with downhill skiing.
<p>     
Note that downhill mountain biking is different from skiing in that 
the substrate is much more yielding in the case of skiing.  No road 
rash, no broken bones unless you manage to torque something (which 
I've done), etc.  Falling off a bike HURTS, and it isn't as smooth and 
graceful even if you manage to stay upright.
<p>     
Also, a bike is a very efficient way to get up and around mountains - 
the nice thing about it is that you can cover lots of ground, see the 
scenery, etc.  National forests and other nearly-pristine areas fill 
the bill without the addition of an "area."  All we need are fire 
roads and trails.
<p>    
So, basically, I guess I'd just as soon it didn't happen.
<p>
P.
<p>
<p>
Here is part of his followup email, which I found much more encouraging:
<p>
<b>...</b> I appreciate your reply, and I don't mean to tell you that you're
doing a horrible thing.  Some people might enjoy it - I used to
belong to a bike club in which most of the members really just did the
uphills to be able to do the downhills <b>...</b> Good luck with your
venture <b>...</b>
<p>
Well, friends again now, I'd say!

<hr>
<p>
Hi!
<p>
Thanks for your email regarding my mountain bike plan.  Actually, I think
that a number of the problems you cite can be handled.  Here are some
answers:  
<p>
1) I don't know if I'm talented enough to put something like this together.
But I do have the "vision" thing.  I see the park in my mind and have put
numerous pieces of the puzzle together in the past few days.  
<p>
2) We expect trails designed by superstars.  This will make it interesting
for people to come even though they can ride good trails near home.  Not this
good.  Good singletrack is hard to find. 
<p>
3)  Financially, we plan to buy used lift equipment which apparently is in a
slump market, according to someone at a bike manufacturer.  We plan to put
the park on leased public land.  
<p>
4) We don't need resorts and restaurants--power bars, salad bars, and juice
bars should suffice.  Remember, this will be close to the city, unlike ski
resorts, because the mountain doesn't need to be so tall and you can start at
the bottom.  
<p>
5) Financially, only having to keep and maintain bike rental and repair
equipment versus ski and bike rental equipment gives us an advantage.  
<p>
6)  We don't have to make snow.
<p>
As to the size of the crowds, this sport is not going to go away.  It's too
much fun.  Bungee Jumping is a minor success.  Sky diving, rock climbing,
hang gliding--these all have participants.  But I bet more people mountain
bike than all those things combined.
<p>
Please feel free, of course, to throw more pumps at my spokes.  The excercise
of answering your questions is vital if this thing is going to work at all.  
<p>
Please visit the web site occassionally, and if you want to report on the
thing, we'ed appreciate it of course.
<p>
Thanks, 
<br>
Russell Hoffman
<p>
<hr>
<p>
Here is the original email to me:
<p>
Sounds like a great idea, if you can make it fly financially, and I'm not
sure if that's possible. I don't want to demean your talent at putting
something like this together, but it sounds pretty risky.
<p>
My hunch is that few, if any, of the ski resort/MTB parks actually turn a
profit on mountain biking. In three good skiing days, Mammoth gets more
paying customers than it does in an entire summer of mountain biking. And
they have the condos, restaurants and other  attractions already in place.
Will you be able to provide similar amenities?
<p>
Second, the cost of land anywhere near L.A. that would be convenient for
locals has got to be prohibitive -- if there are any suitable parcels that
aren't already public lands.
<p>
Finally, how are you going to convince people to pay for something in
their own backyard that they already do there for free?
<p>
Again, I don't mean to jam a pump in your spokes, but I'm curious as to
whether these obstacles can be overcome.
<p>

First is my response.  The original message I am responding to appears below.

<br>
Hi!
<p>
Thanks very much for your comments.  I will presumably post them at my site
with this answer (but without your name unless you ask me to include it,
which I would be happy to do.)  I realize that your comments are basically
negative, but then, you *do* wish me luck with the venture!
<p>
Anyway,  here's my answer:  I basically agree with everything you say about
"why we ride" and I think that is "why we ride"--most of, maybe even almost
all of, the time.  I would be surprised if more than a few people buy season
passes to this place, considering that it will indeed have elements of
"crass commercialism"--it's unavoidable.  It will have marked trails, and
rules and stuff (like, you can only tailgate your friends, and you have to
yield to a "track" call).  But I think also, everyone enjoys a good unearned
downhill rush now and then.  Two or three or four thousand feet of plunge. 
<p>
I couldn't build it in upper NY because, of course, you only have half a
year, opposite ski resorts.  We expect to do well in the winter when the ski
resort mountain bike areas are closed.
<p>
As to the "unnatural features you would never find in a natural wilderness",
what you find in the natural wilderness are trails built for hikers, and
fire roads, and that's about it, unless you go to Moab or some place like
that.  All I'm really asking is that the trails be designed for the inertial
pleasures of a mountain bike ride, taking advantage of what a skilled rider
can do.  Especially the base run-out of each trail.
<p>
One trail might be mainly made of well-rounded hills while another has a lot
of banked curves.  Still another route down the mountain would have lots of
everything--very skilled riders only, please.
<p>
Anyway, I hope you'll come visit the park and if everybody trys it once,
they'll have a blast and still spend most of their lives on pristine fire
roads and trails build for hikers--and have a blast there too, no doubt.
That *is* why we ride.  Certainly, I love remarking to my fellow riders at
some point, that we can see for miles in virtually every direction, or even
IN every direction, and not see a road, a house, or a human artifact.  
<p>
I still like a good downhill sometimes, and if you do too, please come to the
park when/if we get it built, and look me up  (I'll have some title between
chief trail designer and garbageman, I assume.)
<p>
Sincerely,
<br>
Russell Hoffman

Russell:
<p>
Your idea for a mountain bike park may be sound for megaopolises like Los 
Angeles, where there is a big problem with overcrowded trails and 
animosity between hikers, equestrians and riders.
<p>
It also may be a good idea for places like Marin County, Calif., where 
land-access problems threaten mountain biking.
<p>
But in places like pristine upstate New York, and I don't mean 15 miles 
north of the Bronx, a mountain bike park is a foolish idea. There is tons 
of singletrack, fire roads and challenging terrain within 30 minutes of 
my home in Syracuse, N.Y. It is desolate, inviting and completely devoid 
of commercialism.
<p>
Best of all, it's free.
<p>
I ride to escape "theme park" concepts and crass commercialism, such as 
bike company booths. The biggest problem in mountain biking is that so 
many riders are concerned with the "trickest" parts and bikes rather than 
just riding.
<p>
While I think your park concept could give more riders more access to 
more trails, there's no way I would pay to ride at a glorified ski area 
complete with whoop-de-doos, jumps and all sorts of unnatural terrain 
features that you would never find in the natural wilderness.
<p>
I wish you good luck. But I don't want mountain biking to take the ski 
resort route. We don't need an Aspen-style mega-resort for mountain 
biking.
<p>
There are plenty of unexplored trails out there. People just have to look 
for them. That's half the fun of this sport.
<p>

<br>

Virtually <i>each</i> email I've received for the mountain bike park
has had a wonderful comment which I've selected below!  
I'd say the votes in favor are roughly thirty to zero, with one or two neutral. 
But of the first 1000 that visited the web site, well, there were about 970
abstentions (didn't vote.)  As your favorite riding areas get chewed
up and spit out by housing developments and closed by one or two
angry hikers, please give a thought to the fact that your support of this idea
is the easiest thing you can do!  You don't even need to get out on
Trail Day or anything! (But you should.)  Just <a href="/mailprom.htm">send us email</a>
 and let us know you would ride there, and generally support the idea.  
It doesn't mean you're supporting the destruction of the rain forests or 
nuking the whales, or even a crass commercial operation.  You're
'merely' saying that (yet) another well-educated (well enough to
have searched the web, and that's at least gotta be above average)
mountain bike rider (that makes you above average in a lot of ways
too, on average) supports the <i>concept</i> of this place!  That's
all a few simple words convey, but added together, they become a
movement, a force, a tide, a power, and a really cool downhill.
<p>
<a href="/mailprom.htm">Emailing us</a> with your support is just saying that you think the idea 
is a good one.  You're saying that <i>if</i> we implement the idea 
correctly, you would try to visit it!  
<p>
If you have suggestions for such a park, if there's some part of a
vision of a mountain bike park that you've always dreamed of (or
thought of right this second) but haven't seen mentioned anywhere
at this web site, please let us know about it!  <a href="/mailprom.htm">Email us today!</a>.
<p>
<ul><b>Sample's from emails</b>
<li>
It is inconceivable to me that your mountain bike park idea would not be a success.
<li>
That could be the coolest idea i've heard in a long time!
<li>
I would love to go to a park like this.  
<li>
Sounds like a good idea!  
<li>
Of course I think it's a great idea - not to mention a lucrative one! 
<li>
Sounds great! Who do I make my check out to?

We suddenly realized that combining the Web and mountain bikers wasn't 
much of a stretch.  Where better to ask for help, advice, and encouragement? 
In fact, as far as I can tell mountain bikers are just about the most
'connected' group of people in the world--and the nicest, too.
<p>

indicated their support one way or another, and we thank
them and encourage you to leave this site for their site when you

We have not been paid to present any of these links, nor have we paid 
them for linking to us (if they did).  We all just want to ride cool 
singletrack. If we get paid by someone, sometime, for something at

<h1> Looking for information on Oberleutnant Franz Von Werra </h1>
<hr>
<a href="/pics/icons/ascologo.gif"><IMG ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=10 WIDTH=32 HEIGHT=14 SRC="/pics/icons/ascolog1.gif" ALT=""></a>
<p>
Please help me find information about Second World War German Ace Franz Von Werra!
<hr>
<p>
What's the son of an American WWII GI doing interested in escaped
German prisoner of war Oberleutnant Franz Von Werra?
<p>
According to legend, as described in <i>Reader's Digest's True Stories
of Great Escapes</i>, (Copyright Reader's Digest Association, 1977) 
Franz Von Werra was instrumental in improving conditions for Allied POW's
in Germany during the war; his book about his incredible escape from
Allied prison guards was <i>banned</i> by the German Propaganda Ministry
as being too pro-British,
and his escape and several other attempted escapes were all conducted in 
a manner befitting a gentleman and an honorable soldier.  
<p>
On top of that, he escaped from Canadian authorities into America
before America had entered the War, while we were technically not at
odds with Germany!  
<p>
Von Werra was known for wild exagerations of his exploits, and wild excesses 
like keeping a pet lion at his aerodrome (Headquarters Staffel of the
Second Gruppe of No. 3 Fighter Geschwader).  His claim to be a Baron
is considered dubious at best.  But the truth of his amazing escape is
irrefutable.  
<p>
At the time of his death (he crashed into the sea after engine trouble) 
he was Commanding Officer of the First Gruppe of No. 53 Fighter 
Geschwader--the "Ace of Spades" Geschwader, then based in Holland.
<p>
If anyone can provide me with newspaper clippings from Ogdensburg,
New York, in 1941, where he came across the border, or from England, Canada,
or Germany, relating to this man's activities, it will be <i>greatly</i>
appreciated.  A more complete report/electronic memorial to the exploits
of Oberleutnant Franz Von Werra will be posted at this web site after
I collect more information.  A photo which could be scanned in would 
be especially appreciated, and of course, a translated (English) version 
of his book would be extraordinary!  Von Werra deserves recognition. 
When he crossed into America he was not an enemy, he was a hero.
<p>
Thank you in advance for any help.

Note: The book Reader's Digest excerpted is called <i>THE ONE THAT GOT
AWAY</i>, written by Kendall Burt and James Leasor.

<p>  
Of course, you never forget a brother.  First of all, you never have very many of them, and
second of all, usually throughout your life, in one way or another, they're the closest thing to you. 
Even when you're fighting and feuding.  Even after you're married.  Even when you've grown up.
<p>
I have a half-sister, a step sister, a step brother, and a brother.  This
story is about another brother, Randy, who was 18 months my senior,
and who died on November 19th, 1994, of Leukemia, at the age of 39.
<p>  
It is a letter to my high school's Headmaster and Dean of Students.  
Sections of this letter were published in the Alumni News and I
received a very nice letter back from the school.  It should be
obvious from this letter that I recommend <b>GFA</b> highly to anyone who
can manage to go.

<br>
Ed Denes,  Dean of Students
<br>
Greens Farms Academy
<br>
Greens Farms, Connecticut
<p>
December 16th, 1994
<p>
Dear Jim and Ed,
<p>
I hope everything is going well for you and Greens Farms Academy this holiday season.  I had a wonderful time visiting my old high school last summer for my 20th class reunion, and in particular, seeing the two of you.
<p>
I only wish I could have gotten into the science lab to see if my brains were still there!  A fetal pig brain, a fetal shark brain, and possibly others.  If they are still there (which they should be) I would like to send a label to attach to them.  They should have an old label on them now anyway, of course...  The pig brain, as I recall, had 10 of the 12 cranial nerves still attached. 
<p>
The silly things one remembers...   Out of 1000 days or so, four years of glorious education in the finest environment I can imagine, ending now more than twenty years ago, I remember clearly debating with myself over whether I had the right to take my beautiful dissections home, lest they ever be discarded...  
<p>
Jim, I do not think you knew my brother Randall Melvin Hoffman, because I think he only went to GFA one year (10th grade), the first year it went Coed, when Miss Lauber was the headmistress.  I started in 9th grade that year.  However, Ed, I think you might remember Randy.
<p>
Randall died of Leukemia on November 19th, 1994 after a very brave battle.  At the service, our father, who fought on the front lines through Italy, France, in The Battle of The Bulge, and all the way into Germany in World War II (mortar man) described Randy thus: "I'm a combat veteran...  I've seen men die.  I've seen men be brave.  I've seen men pray.  I've seen men run away.  But I've never seen anyone as brave as Randy was as he fought for his life these last six months."
<p>
The last time I saw Randy was on my birthday, August 14th, in the hospital, after he received a bone marrow transplant from our younger brother, Daniel.  He was hairless, of course, from the chemotherapy.  He had tubes running out of his chest, and a patch over one eye, which he had recently lost to a bad infection.  He had a full knowledge of what the medical terms were for everything he had already been through and for everything he had yet left to face.  
He had gone "code blue" twice in the previous month.  He was sterile, from the chemo.  He had no wife or children.
<p>
In that state, and in that place, Randy quoted Lou Gerig's famous words to me:  "I consider myself the luckiest man on the face of the earth."  
<p>
Randy was never much into sports, and probably didn't even know what stadium the Yankees play in--although he could pin me down any time I tried to beat up our younger brother Daniel, and thus he became the wrestling champion for two years at Helen Keller Middle School in Easton.  But he certainly knew Lou had died shortly after making that speech.
<p>
Randy made it easy for me to pretend to be brave, and not cry as we sat together and listened to a demo tape his band had recorded shortly before he found out he was ill.  We stopped the tape after each song and I critiqued it.   ("The bass player's punching every note of that song like they're each the most important note in the song...--ahhh, Randy?   Are you the bass player in the band?  Sorry!"   "No, that's okay! That's what I want!)   
I never liked his classical stuff, but this was rock--something I understand.  So he wanted my opinion.
<p>
He left the hospital room for the first time that day, with me helping him.  He staggered a little-- just once, a few feet from the bed, dragging his life-giving pumps and tubing apparatus behind him.  "Randy, don't fall and hurt yourself.  You might die if you do, and the family would never forgive me!"  
<p>
He looked like The Invisible Man, with a baseball cap to hide his bald head, and a patch over one eye, and dark sunglasses for the other, and a robe and slippers--the usual dignified hospital garb.  As we entered the nursing station area everyone clapped.  Wendall came up, who Randy described as his "best friend".   Wendall goes to the hospital and helps people like Randy, and AIDS patients and so forth.   (If you don't believe in saints or angels, visit any hospital.)  
Wendall told Randy most people  push the apparatus in front of themselves, rather than dragging it behind.  It was only then that I realized this was Randy's first time out of the room.
<p>
About a week later, he left the hospital entirely to begin a slow recovery.  But unfortunately he died about three months later during what he, and we, thought was to have been a long convalescence.
<p>
I'm sure many that knew him the one year he attended GFA--I think it was just one year--will remember him.   Randy had a way of making his presence felt.  Had he finished high school at GFA, he would have graduated in 1973.  He left GFA and Connecticut to live with our father in Pennsylvania.  I do not recall him having any complaints whatsoever about his time at GFA--I remember he liked the school as much as, or nearly as much as, I did. 
<p>
Indeed, it was his idea to go in the first place.  I had refused to go for some reason, maybe turned off by having to wear a tie or something.  I had already started at Columbus school in Westport instead.  I had been there two or three days when Randy came home from his first day at GFA.
<p>
"Rusty, you <i>have to</i> go to this school!"
<p>
He then started listing the reasons:  "There are less than 30 students in your whole grade.  There are often only 10 or so in a class!   The building, the rooms, and the grounds are all beautiful.  It's near a beach, it's got grass and ivy everywhere.  The science and music labs are full of equipment.    The food in the cafeteria is delicious. And Rusty,  of the 30 kids in your class, 27 of them are girls!!!"  I went to GFA.
<p>
At his service many people described Randy as their "best friend"  (far more than any of us deserve!)  He was known for his gentle manner and his hilarious self-deprecating humor.  Randy was a gifted composer, from classical to rock, and he was my best friend too, and Daniel's.  
<p>
I regret to have to write to the school with this sorrow, but I'm sure many there, possibly yourselves included (I rather hope so), will remember Randy and will want to know.   My warmest regards to both of you.
<p>
Sincerely,
<br>
Russell Hoffman
<br>
Class of '74

<h3>Addendum...</h3>
<p>  
<i> The following was written about two years later (November, 1996)...</i>
<p>  
Leukemia is especially nasty because it attacks sort of at medium speed, 
any time in life.  One day you realize you havent been feeling well for 
a while, then you go to the Doctor and he recommends a blood test, and 
you wait.  A few days later, your life is forever changed by a short 
conversation with the Doctor.  
<p>  
From then on you have to suddenly know <i>everything</i> about a complex 
and brutal illness and all the torturous methods available to try to 
treat it, which often succeed with only a small percentage of the cases.  
But when it's <b>your</b> ass on the line, statistical analysis is only half 
the problem:  How much pain are you willing to go through to live, anyway?  
Leukemia patients get asked this kind of question all the time.  I'm sure 
Randy was aware of his own bravery when it happened.  He was proud of 
himself as he went through Hell and was surviving it.  He knew what his 
experience was worth.  "I'm different now, because of this"  he said to 
me at the hospital.  I looked at his bald head and puffy face and patched 
eye, and nodded.
<p>  
We both laughed and changed the subject.
<p>  
After he died, someone told me that the other patients at the ward were 
in dispair.  Apparently there is a culture there, in a cancer ward.  Some 
would come, get sicker, and die.  I guess Randy had been there the longest, 
and had survived two "code blue's" and the full onslaught of treatments--and
then even left the hospital for a few months--and then died.  They asked: 
"If Randy's died, what hope is there for us?"  
<p>  
I guess what I hate most about Leukemia, though, is the idea that so much 
of it is caused by man's own pollutants.  For example, Randy lived downwind 
of Three Mile Island, he was living in New Jersey at the time.  That could 
certainly have been the cause.  But you never know.  You can't know.  All 
these people dieing and yet you can't pin the blame on any one thing, or 
one event.  If my liver fails me for too much drinking as a young
adult, or if I fall off my mountain bike and break my neck, 
at least it will be reasonably obvious that <b>I</b> erred.  I don't
minde making decisions about my own risks.  But some lazy 
corporate polluter--you can't find them.  The earth needs cleaning if 
for no other reason, so that less people die of Leukemia.  Leukemia 
research is good, but the real problem is on the outside.

<h1> My last visit to my Grandmother, Christmas, 1995 </h1>
<hr>

<p>
<hr>
<p>
The last time I saw my grandmother before she died was Christmas Day,
1995.  She had been in a nursing home for about five years, in a
small town on the Delaware shore.  I hated
visiting the nursing home.  I hate nursing homes.  I hate hospitals. 
I hate old age. I hate dieing.  Grandmommy died a few months after
this story takes place.
<p>
My wife and my brother's daughter (my 8 year old niece) and I had all
gone over to the nursing home, and as we parked, another carload of
visitors also parked a little way away, and we were all getting out
of the cars at the same time.  We had parked a bit closer to the door
of the nursing home.  
<p>
There were also three of them, a big old
black lady and two old black men, one much older than the other.  
As the three of us got out of our
car, I figured to try to catch these other folk's eye so I could say
"Merry Christmas" which was certainly the civil thing to do. 
<p>
It took a while.  I would look over, and see them looking away, but 
finally I managed to catch one's eye (by looking away and looking
back real quick) and then I yelled
over a holiday greeting, which was answered accordingly.
<p>
We each started towards the door of the nursing home, and I had
gotten our group on the move so that we would actually get to the
door just before the other group.  Holding myself back a bit, my
niece went first (she's very outgoing and tends to lead the
way anyway).
<p>
As she got to the door, I told her "hold the door for these folks"
and she and my wife each grabbed a door and held it open as we let
these old black folks past.
<p>
Well! The older gentleman, when he passed me, gave me just about the
warmest handshake I've ever received, looked my straight in the eye 
and said "Merry Chistmas!  May you have many more in good health!"
<p>
"Merry Christmas to you too, sir" said I smiling, and in we all went.
<p>
If it hadn't been Christmas, I'd have done it the same.  The greatest
sin of racism is to pass it on to the next generation.

<title> An Mountain Bike encounter with a big cat</title>
</header>
<body>
<hr>
<h1> A Mountain Biker's Encounter With a Big Cat or: Staring at the Face of Death and Thinking "Nice Kitty!" </h1>
<hr>
<p>
This story about encountering a large cat doesn't end in me beating
off a vicious attack, but maybe you'll find it interesting anyway...
<p>
One Sunday I came upon a bobcat, not fifty
feet away, sitting and licking his front paw.  I was on a road 
(something I rarely do, thank goodness!) and I was riding slowly.
I was actually looking for a coat hanger to get a locked door open
because my friend had just locked his keys in his car.
<p>
I passed a small clearing and
there he was (the bobcat, not the friend) sitting down in the middle of the clearing, which was
about 40 feet by 120 feet deep in size and he was near the middle.
I actually saw him first! (Which is really the coolest part of this
story...)
<p> 
He was about 90 degrees to my <i>right</i> as I passed him,
and I turned around to the <i>left</i> 270 degrees (keeping an eye on him
except when I had to spin my head around once counterclockwise).  I 
stopped the bike facing him and dismounted with the bike between me and
him, in front of me.  
<p>
<ul><b>Technically, what you're supposed to do is approximately this:  </b>
<li>Make yourself look big.
<li>Yell.
<li>Throw things.
<li>Gather in a group.
<li>Pick up small children.
<li>Light a fire, unless it's against local regulations.  (Just try
to light a fire while throwing things and making yourself look big!)
</ul>
<p>
Technically, I had a problem.  My wife, who happens to be a foot
smaller and about 60% of my weight, was riding, slowly and unseen,
a hundred yards behind me and was coming up on the scene.  She was,
of course, also looking for a piece of steel (the friend had gone off
to call AAA, which is how we actually got the door open.)
<p>
We stared at each other (the bobcat and I, not my wife and I) for what seemed like a minute, but was probably
about 5 or 10 seconds.  He would flick an ear, and I would raise
my eyebrows.  He would flick his other ear, and I would raise my
eyebrows again, since I can't do only one eyebrow.  Neither of us yawned.  He remained seated.  
I had a helmet on (of course).  He didn't (of course).
<p>
My wife, Sharon, was coming up the road behind me and I didn't know
what to do.  You're supposed to look big, wave your arms etc. and generally present yourself as crazy,
big, unpredictable, big, and maybe 
dangerous (and big).  But I did none of these things.  
<p>
I kept thinking--what if it
ran off when I scared it--<i>towards</i> Sharon?  This was very unlikely, but possible. 
I also couldn't shake the feeling of "that thing's not really
dangerous, is it?!?"
So I waited, and as she got closer I pointed and said "big cat!" 
which was the only way I could describe it.  I'm pretty sure now, it
was a bobcat.  (which actually aren't all that agressive towards
humans.) It left when I yelled, and she saw it only after it had turned to go
and was trotting off away from us.  
<p>
Sharon thinks perhaps her full-face Troy Lee Designs helmet scared the
cat.  I think it was that it was now two to one.
<p>
There's no exciting ending to this story, but I warned you of that at
the beginning!  The rest of the ride was great.   I think we all kept
our eyes out especially much, looking for big cats that day.  
<p>
<hr>
<i>To get to this ride:</i>
<p>
If you are riding in Carlsbad, California, go to the intersection of
Palomar Airport Road and El Camino Real.  Go north on El Camino Real
for about 1/4 mile to the first paved road on your right, turn onto it, and
almost immediately turn into the parking lot of the first (and only)
building, which will be on your left. 
This is a public building and parking there after hours doesn't seem
to be any problem.  
<p>
The ride starts almost directly across from the driveway.  Go about
150 feet along a variety of short singletracks to a long straight fire 
road, and go down it for about 1/2 mile.  You'll return up this fire road. 
<p>
Continue after it turns to fairly straight, fairly wide singletrack, 
turning left at a Y another mile or so up.  Go into the trees and across a
stream.  Climb up all the way past the housing development until you
are forced to again turn left.  Then descend via
several routes.  The best brings you to the base of the fire road you
came in on, after some easy stream crossings.  The worst brings you near
the Y with a nasty stream crossing with lots of poison oak.  It's
only about 4 1/2 miles total trip so you can always backtrack if you
run out of ideas and can't find a fun way across the stream.

<h1> Hospital Medical Records Clerk (part 2)</h1>
<h3>Follow-up correspondence...</h3>
In January, 1997 I received the following email:
<p>
<i>I'm a high school senior enrolled in a Health Occupations class.  We 
recently got assigned a profession to research, my topic is Medical 
Records Clerk.  I was wondering if you could tell me more about the job.  
I would really appreciate it.</i>
<p>
I responded that I thought I had said everything I knew or could
remember about the job in the article--had she read it?  (Of course
she had--that's why she emailed me in the first place!) She said she 
had a number of additional questions, which she listed:
<p>
<i>Subj:        Re: Medical Records Clerk Job...
<p> 
Yes, I read the page.  But the information I need is not discussed all 
that much, such, as....
<p>
Educational Requirements<br> 
Certification required<br>
Advancement opportunities<br>
Wages & Benefits<br>
Job outlook<br>
Thank you very much for the information!<br>
</i>
<p>
<hr>
<h3><i>Here is my response:</i></h3>
<p>
Hi!
<p>
Okay!  I see what you mean.  I don't know the answers to all of them, 
but you might try going to the U.S. government's own census bureau for 
questions about outlook for the future, #'s in the field, and so on...  
Here's the URL:
<p>
<a href="http://www.census.gov/">http://www.census.gov/</a><br>
I'll try to fill in the ones I think I know, though...
<h3>Educational Requirements</h3>
High School Diploma is probably required.  I didn't have much college.  
However, I did have a good solid recommendation and that's important 
because it is a job which carries significant responsibility, as does 
just about any job in a hospital.  Your reputation is the most important 
thing you own!  Of course, you must be able to read.
<h3>Certification required</h3>
No.
<h3>Advancement opportunities</h3>
I don't think there were any significant ones directly.  The Medical 
Records Director I would expect is a degreed professional so that's 
out.  However, what you can do is go to school at the same time, and 
then you'll already be an employee in the medical profession with any 
benefits that often includes, and be gaining seniority at the hospital 
you work at.  And besides that, if you work the night shift you can (at 
least where I worked) sometimes get your homework done while you're there.  
<p>
They don't have anything else for you to do sometimes except just BE THERE 
if you're needed, so they don't mind if you use that time to better yourself.
I learned to juggle, it's true, but I also read a lot of good books.
<h3>Wages & Benefits</h3>
It was a minimum wage job, or just slightly better, but since it puts 
you into the hospital payroll, the benefits are sometimes pretty good.  
That's been changing, I hear--even hospitals don't always have good 
benefits packages for their employees--but they probably still have 
better benefits than outside the medical industry, I would think.  I'm 
just guessing, or maybe I heard something, I'm not sure.
<h3>Job outlook</h3>
It will be a long time before this job is 'computerized'.  Everybody's 
records are still maintained largely in paper format and must be 
physically pulled and sent down to ER.  I've advocated for decades that 
this not be so, but so far, it hasn't changed.  When it does the job will 
be eliminated, but anyone entering the field right now, I would guess, 
might have several decades before they would have had to learn a new skill.  
<p>
I would recommend, however, that this profession be entered with the 
understanding that it gives you a unique opportunity to learn about 
the workings of the medical profession and that you'll be doing it 
while continuing school in a more advanced medical profession.
<p>
We were able to read all sorts of fascinating reports.  We were, in fact, 
encouraged to sample them so that we would get used to what was in them 
so we could find things quicker.  Of course, we weren't allowed to copy 
it, and we certainly weren't supposed to search out famous people's 
records, and I'm sure if we were ever caught pulling a friend's record 
off the shelf without cause we would be fired (and would deserve to be.)
<p>
******************************
<p>
I guess I was able to give answers to most of your questions after all, 
but for real facts instead of conjecture, I still recommend you contact 
the Census Bureau online.
<p>
Good luck with the report and I hope you get an "A"!  Let me know. 
<p>
Thanks,<br>

<p>
It is well known that under certain conditions, newly hatched
goslings and ducklings will follow and become socially bonded to
the first moving object they encounter. Konrad Lorenz, in his
classic studies of this phenomenon, noted that the bond seemed to
be formed immediately, that it seemed to be irreversible and that
it seemed to only develop during a brief "critical period" in the
first day or so after hatching. Lorenz employed the term
"Imprinting" to describe the process by which the social bond was
formed. In doing so he implied that during a gosling or
duckling's first encounter with a moving object the 
image of the object is somehow stamped irreversibly on the
nervous system and for many years this was the accepted
conception of the process. 
<p>
In the course of more recent research (in my own as well as in 
other laboratories) it has come to be realized that the
traditional view of imprinting is incorrect. The newer research
makes it clear that imprinting is neither rapid nor irreversible;
as was claimed by Lorenz and his followers. Nor for that matter
is imprinting a specialized phenomenon limited to a brief
critical period early in a young bird's life, as was also claimed
by the early investigators. Instead the latest findings lead to
the unexpected conclusion that imprinting occurs in many species
including man and that it entails much more plastic and forgiving
mechanisms than were claimed by Lorenz. Perhaps more importantly,
that work also provides compelling evidence that the social bond
that develops through imprinting entails an addictive process
that is mediated by the release of endorphins (the brain's own
opiates). This surprising insight helps us to better understand a
number of otherwise puzzling issues with respect to how we deal
with each other and with our children. 
<p>
We now understand that imprinting works as follows:  To be an
appropriate target for social bonding an object (it could, of
course, be a person or an animal) has to provide stimulation that
is pleasurable and in this sense, comforting. This will happen
when some aspect of the object (for example, its shape or its
texture or its motion) has the capacity to innately stimulate the
production of endorphins (the brain's own form of morphine). 
<p>
When a young duckling or gosling or human baby is exposed to such an
object it is immediately comforted and if the exposure is
extensive, the initially neutral features of the object gradually
acquire the capacity to themselves stimulate the production of
endorphins. This happens through an as yet to be thoroughly
understood learning process.  
<p>
Once this learning has occurred,
the object will have been rendered familiar. As a result it will
continue to be comforting when development has proceeded to the
point when any unfamiliar, but otherwise appropriate, object
will elicit a competing fear reaction. 
<p>
When viewed in this
fashion it becomes clear that the so called critical period is
merely the period in development prior to the onset of fear of
novelty (at about day three) in ducklings and goslings, and fear
of strangers (at about 8 months) in our own babies. It is also
clear that for subjects that are beyond the critical period, an
appropriate but unfamiliar object must eventually become familiar
provided that the subject has sufficient exposure to it.  Once
this happens the object will no longer elicit a competing fear
response and since the object already has the capacity to
stimulate the production of endorphins it will now serve as a
potential target for social bonding.

<p>
<i>I wrote this letter after visiting one of their museums, in Los
Angeles, California.  I never heard back from them.  Maybe I should
have sent it to Guiness' World Records instead!  Anyway, it seems to
me that if they can have portraits of people done entirely in laundry
lint, that "the world's most 'prolific' artist" could get a mention,
too!</i>

<br>
Feb. 7th, 1994
<br>
<p>
To Whom It May Concern:
<p>
After visiting your museum in Hollywood, CA last December, I realized I have an item you may be interested in.  Enclosed are samples of "RANDOM COMPUTER ART" which I have created using the computer language called BASIC, a Panasonic six-pen plotter and an NEC laptop computer.  My unique procedure was written about in Clifford Pickover's Journal of Chaos and Graphics some years ago.  
<p>
Each drawing is completely unique because the program that creates them uses hundreds of random numbers* (sometimes thousands) to decided precisely how big, what color, and where shapes will be placed.  Leaves on trees are randomly placed as are the branches.  Houses are of random width but a standard height.  
<p>
The round tree images were originally drawn on the computer and then the exact locations and other features were randomized, while the pine trees and other images are purely computer generated.  Some of these patterns take minutes to draw while others in the enclosed batch took over an hour.
<p>
There are currently about five basic patterns. I have given away close to 20,000 of these drawings and each one is unique.  Interestingly, when I lay out a hundred or so on a table people will sort through them ALL and pick out the one they like the best--but all are eventually picked!  Not one ever stayed on the table all day long!  If I lay out 200 drawings people will still sort through them all--and it takes too long so I limit it to a hundred at a time.   
I really think this says something very interesting about "art" and the perception of beauty.
<p>
If you think you might like to exhibit these I have some larger examples (8.5" X 11") which took as much as 10 hours or more for the plotter to draw.  These could be photographed or litho printed or something for display since the colors on these samples will fade fairly quickly in bright light.
<p>
I hope you are interested in my work and I look forward to hearing from you.  Thank you, in advance, for your kind attention and in any event, keep up the good work at your amazing and interesting museums!
<p>
Sincerely,
<p>
Russell Hoffman,
<br>
Owner and Chief Programmer for The Animated Software Company
<br>
* Although computer-generated random numbers are not, technically, truly random, they are generally accepted as being equivalent and certaily are unpredictable unless one knows the precise formula and starting number (or "seed.")  The author (artist) doesn't know these things so the art is fairly called random.

There are definitely some similarities between these images and some
of the <a href="randomar.htm">random computerized art</a> also exhibited at this web 
site.  I drew these images mainly in the late 1970's.  I have scanned them
in at relatively low resolution for presentation here.  There are
high-resolution TIFF images of these available, each about 4
megabytes in size, except one (template.tif) which is 25 megabytes. 
(Please contact us if you would like to purchase a large format image.)

I am posting this inquiry so that more detail about the use of plutonium in

critical response from a NASA engineer, pointing out certain errors in my
arguments.  Since my letter was based in part on infomation posted to the

I will quote the criticisms of my letter, point by point.  I am humbled by

<h3>Dear Francis Chiappa and other Abolition 2000-ists:</h3>
<p>    
NASA is now in high gear -- obfuscating, BS-ing, and otherwise on
quite a propaganda effort -- to defend its plan to, in October, launch the
Cassini space probe with 72.3 pounds of plutonium fuel onboard.  
<p>        
It's important that people know the facts solidly.  I am the author
of two books on nuclear technology, COVER UP: WHAT YOU ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO
KNOW ABOUT NUCLEAR POWER and POWER CRAZY, and am quite familiar with nuclear
matters.  For 30 years I have specialized in doing investigative reporting
on environmental issues.  I am a full professor of journalism at the State
University of New York/College at Old Westbury.  I got involved
investigating the nuclear-in-space issue in 1985 after reading in a
government bulletin about how there would be two shuttle missions in 1986
involving lofting plutonium-fueled space devices. After the Challenger
disaster, I broke that story of how the next mission of the Challenger was
to be one of those plutonium-fueled space probe missions (Ulysses, to orbit
the Sun, with 25 pounds of plutonium onboard).  And I have written
voluminously on the issue ever since. 
<p>       
In July, Common Courage Press will be out with my book, THE WRONG
STUFF: HOW NUKES IN SPACE THREATEN OUR PLANET.  The 1995 video I wrote and
narrated is NUKES IN SPACE: THE NUCLEARIZATION AND WEAPONIZATION OF THE
HEAVENS.  It is available through EnviroVideo at 1-800-ECO-TV46. 
<p>        
A recent and extensive magazine article by me on the issue,
"Risking the world, Nuclear Proliferation in Space," was in the Summer 1996
CovertAction Quarterly.  CAQ will be publishing my article in its next issue
on the November 16, 1996 fall of the Russian Mars 96 space probe with it a
half-pound of plutonium on Chile and Bolivia (no, it didn't fall
"harmlessly" in the Pacific as early press accounts claimed).  An extensive
op-ed piece by me on this was published on December 18, l996 in The
Baltimore Sun.  This month's edition of Extra! Update (published by the
media monitoring group Fairness & Accuracy in Reporting) will feature my
analysis of the lack of press coverage of the fall of the probe on Chile and
Bolivia (as compared to the burst of attention when President Clinton
advised Australian Prime Minister Howard that it was falling on Australia
and offered Australia the "assets" of the U.S. Department of Energy to deal
with any radioactive contamination, in comparison to the lack of comparable
assistance to Chile and Bolivia).  The piece is titled: "Racism Meets
Spacism, What If Deadly Plutonium Fell on Your Country -- and No One Cared?"
<p>        
Also, Project Censored at Sonoma State University will next month
announce that my journalism on the use of nuclear power in space involved
the "most under-reported," indeed "most-censored" stories of 1996 -- the
fourth year my pieces on the use of nuclear power in space have been cited
by Project Censored.
<p>       
There is a great continued push by those in back of the move to use
nuclear power in space to cover up the issue. Those in back of the endeavor
include, most importantly, the U.S. military.  As the recent U.S. Air
Force's Scientific Advisory Board report, "New World Vistas," declares, the
U.S. Air Force "must invest in technologies for high-powered generation such
as space nuclear power" as it moves into space, which is described by the
military in numerous recent military "doctrine" documents to be included in
THE WRONG STUFF as "the ultimate high ground" from which to dominate below.
<p>        
I hope the replies below will help you in dealing with the
continued -- and as the launch date for Cassini nears the probably even more
stepped up -- nukes-in-space cover-up.
<p>        
<b>1.  "The fuel that powers our deep space probes in plutonium-238 dioxide
which has a half life of 86 years.  It must not be confused with the more
generally thought of weapons-grade compound containing plutonium-239, which
has a significantly longer half life of 24,360 years (and not 200,000 years
as was mentioned in your letter.)"</b>
<p>
The issue is not confusion between plutonium-238 and plutonium-239.
Plutonium-238 is not fissile, it is not the stuff of which atomic bombs are
made. No one ever said it was. That's the good news. 
<p>        
Now the bad news.  Plutonium-238 is used in space systems as a
source of electrical power precisely because of its difference to
plutonium-239.  Unlike plutonium-239 which has a half-life of 24,500 years,
plutonium-238 has a half-life of 87.8 years.  Its quicker decay rate means
that it it physically hot -- as a result of its relatively rapid decay.
That heat is coupled in what the U.S. calls a "radioisotope thermal
generator" acronymed RTG (long manufactured by General Electric, now by
Lockheed Martin since its takeover of GE's Aerospace Division) to produce
electricity.  As a result of its shorter half-life and quicker decay, it is
also 280 times more radioactive than plutonium-239.  
<p>        
The problem with any isotope of plutonium is the stuff being
inhaled.  Indeed, the alpha rays from plutonium can be blocked by very
little, a piece of paper, for example.  However, a particle of plutonium
inhaled into the lung, because plutonium is not water soluble, won't
dissolve so gets lodged in the lung emitting radiation -- with plutonium-238
doing it at a rate 280 times more
>than plutonium-239. 
<p>        
Moreover, it takes very little plutonium to cause a health problem.
A famous series of tests with beagle dogs done after World War II concluded
that less than a millionth of a gram of plutonium could cause fatal lung
cancer.         
<p>
This is why Dr. Helen Caldicott, president emeritus of Physicians
for Social Responsibility, has long said that plutonium is "so toxic that
less than one millionth of a gram is a carcinogenic dose. One pound, if
uniformly distributed, could hypothetically induce lung cancer in every
person on Earth." (Her book NUCLEAR MADNESS, Page 81 is one cite.)  
<p>        
Plutonium is a heavy metal and if there would be a catastrophic
nuclear plant accident, it wouldn't spread too far. (Plutonium-239 is built
up as a by-product of fission in a nuclear plant.) But in the scenario of a
space probe breaking up in the atmosphere spreading plutonium far and wide
(and this has occurred), the dosages of plutonium to life are maximized.
<p>
<b>2.  "The so-called 'one hit theory' (where supposedly even a single molecule
of a presumed carcinogen, as suggested in this case plutonium, is enough to
initiate cancer)  remains an unsettled controversy in the field of toxiclogy.
 A review of the well-known 1972 National Center for Toxicological Research's
test of aminoacetyl flourene on a large population of mice (a study performed
to shed some light on the controversy) by the Society of Toxicology concluded
that '...linear (one hit theory) models...do not fit the data and non-linear
models which often suggest practical thresholds provide a better expression
of observed responses.'  (Reference: Re-examination of the ED01 Study,
Fundamental and Applied Toxicology, 1981.)"</b>
<p>
 Sure, there are scientists arguing on both sides of the
radioactivity impact issue. I trust the independent scientists, not the many
in the pay of the government or corporate nuclear establishment, for
objective information on this. 
<p>        
Meanwhile, abundantly clear through the years is that levels of
radioactivity once considered safe, below what had once been called a
"threshold," in fact do cause illness and death. 
<p>        
And what is most important in terms of nuclear space undertakings
is that huge numbers of people stand to be made guinea pigs on this issue.
For example, NASA's FINAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT FOR THE CASSINI
MISSION speaks of the consequences if there is what NASA terms an
"inadvertent reentry" of the Cassini space probe when it is to do a "flyby"
of the Earth in 1999. 
<p>        
Some background: plutonium is not used in a propulsion source on
space devices but just in these radioisotope thermal generators (RTG's) to
provide a small amount of electricitry to run instruments (745 watts for
Cassini).  On Cassini, the power from the conventional chemically-powered
rocket that propels it cannot take it directly from the Earth to its
destination of Saturn. So NASA intends after Cassini's launch to head it to
Venus, circle Venus twice and then have it come hurtling back at the Earth
for a high-speed (42,000 miles per hour) low-level (312 mile high) "flyby."
The aim is to use Earth's gravity to increase the velocity of Cassini so it
can get to Saturn.  But after a billion miles in space, if there is a
miscalculation and Cassini comes in too low and there is what NASA calls an
"inadverent reentry" into the Earth's 75 mile-high atmosphere causing
Cassini to break up and the plutonium to be released, the NASA FINAL
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT STATEMENT says that "approximately 5 billion of the
estimated 7 to 8 billion world population at the time...could receive 99
percent or more of the radiation exposure."  (Page 4-76) (You might want to
get this amazing document from NASA, Solar System Exploration Division,
Office of Space Science, Washington, D.C. 20546.)
<p>        
As to the death toll from that, NASA says it would be several
thousand cancer deaths.  However, Dr. Ernest Sternglass, professor emeritus
of radiological physics at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine,
using NASA's own data from its report, says that NASA "underestimates the
cancer alone by about 2,000 to 4,000 times." He projects l0 to 20 million
deaths "not counting all other causes of death," infant mortality, etc.,
which he says could mean the toll "may be as high as 30 to 40 million
people."  And that's NASA's data he's working from -- independent data would
most likely easier enlarge the base.  Do we want to further determine the
lethality of plutonium using most of the world's population in the experiment?
<p>
<b>3.  Regarding past launch failures involving radioisotope thermoelectric
generators (RTG's), they have been previously reported with no loss material
to the environment.  These devices are specifically designed for and have
successfully survived catastrophic launch failures in the past.  Experience
does not support your contention that, ' an explosion during launch would
have showered plutonium over South Florida...'  .''</b>
<p>
Reply: As to NASA's claim of there being "no loss material to the
environment" in prior RTG flights, this is -- to put it bluntly -- a lie.
On April 2l, l964, the SNAP-9A plutonium-fueled RTG on board the Transit
5BN-3 navigational satellite fell, with the satellite, to Earth,
disintegrating in the atmosphere as it plummeted and releasing its 2.1
pounds of plutonium.
<p>        
According to a report entitled "Emergency Preparedness for
Nuclear-Powered Satellites" prepared by Europe's Organization for Economic
Cooperation Nuclear Energy Agency and the Swedish National Institute of
Radiation Protection in 1989, the plutonium from SNAP-9A "dispersed
worldwide" (indeed, NASA had the RTG designed to do that so as to spread the
plutonium globally in the event of an accident rather than have it all come
down on one portion of the Earth, the report notes). 
<p>        
"A worldwide soil sampling program carried out in 1970 showed
SNAP-9A debris to be present at all continents and at all latitudes," said
the report.          
<p>
Dr. John Gofman, professor emeritus of medical physics at the
University of California at Berkeley, has long linked the SNAP-9A accident
with an increased level of lung cancer on Earth.  
<p>        
As for Cassini, NASA has thankfully not actually designed it to
break up in the atmosphere in the event of an accident -- and the plutonium
to spread as vapor or respirable particles, which is how, again, plutonium
kills.
<p>        
But NASA admits that will likely be the cause in its FINAL
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT STATEMENT.  On Page 4-5l of the document, NASA states
that "for all the reentry cases studied, about 32 to 34 percent of the fuel
from the three RTGs is expected to be released at high altitude...Based on
this analysis and the expected initial particle size distribution of the
fuel, the particle size distribution of the fuel released during reentry was
calculated as a function of the reentry angle.  The fraction of the fuel
particles released during reentry estimated to be reduced to vapor or
respirable particles less than l0 microns ranges from 66 percent for very
shallow reenetries (8 degrees) to about 20 percent for steep (90 degree)
reentries."  So we are talking here of several pounds of plutonium (and,
incidentally, the 72.3 pounds of plutonium to be used on Cassini is the
largest amount ever used on a space device) being dispersed, NASA admits,
and as "vapor or respirable particles." 
<p>        
As for plutonium not being released during an explosion on launch,
NASA hopes this is the case.  But we only have to look for a parallel at a
recent launch accident, the January 17 blow-up of a Delta rocket at the Cape
Canaveral Air Station (near to where Cassini is supposed to be launched in
October). 
<p>        
In the explosion which occurred 13 seconds after launch a cloud
formed of toxic chemicals including nitrogen tetroxide and
monomethylhydrazine, both acknowledged in NASA documents as "deadly if a
person comes into contact" with them.  The cloud floated out to sea, then
back to land and then south along Florida's East Coast. Residents as far
south as Vero Beach, 100 miles away, were told by the Air Force to stay
inside, close all doors and windows and turn off air conditioning and heating
units to avoid contact with vapor from the toxic cloud.
<p>        
Accidents involving space devices happen -- with regularity.
Factor in nuclear material and you're speaking of potentially colossal
catastrophic accidents. 
<p>        
John Pike, director of the Space Policy Project at the Federation
of American Scientists, says the odds of that Delta II launch blow-up was
one-in-20 which, he says, is the same odds as for an explosion on launch of
Cassini with its 72.3 pounds of plutonium. 
<p>        
Oh, as for the "shielding" of the plutonium on Cassini, Dr. Horst
Poehler, for 22 years a scientist for NASA at the Kennedy Space Center, says
it's "fingernail thin...a joke," but 3/l28ths of an inch of iridium alloy,
some graphite, some foil.  He says that a Cassini accident involving the
dispersal of its record-high amount of plutonium stands to be "the mother of
all accidents."
<p>
<b>4.  "RTG's are used for civilian deep space probes where solar energy is too
diffuse to be used (beyond the orbit of Mars).  Solar cells are the
predominant power source for spacecraft and are replaced by RTG's only in
those relatively few missions where solar cell use would be impractical."
</b>
<p>
Reply:  Perhaps the most outrageous aspect of all this is that the huge
danger of using nuclear power on space devices is not necessary.  Before the
l989 Galileo flight, NASA and its Jet Propulsion Laboratory people insisted
that there could be no substitute than to use RTGs with their 50 pounds of
plutonium on that mission to Jupiter.  Indeed, this was sworn to in a
federal court cases brought by the Florida Coalition for Peace and Justice
and others to stop Galileo. 
<p>        
And yes, it was pointed out then that there had been 24 U.S.
nuclear space missions previously.  Not stressed, however, were the
failures: and SNAP-9A was not the only one. There was the SNAP-19 accident
in which an RTG with 4.2 pounds of plutonium fell into the Pacific off
California on May 18, 1968 right after launch; it was retreived. Then there
was the SNAP-27 with 8.3 pounds of plutonium that was aboard the ill-fated
Apollo 13 flight.  The book on which the blockbuster film is based, LOST
MOON, co-authored by Apollo Commander Jim Lovell, spends three pages on the
great concern about not only the three astronauts ending up as toast but
also the SNAP-27 disintegrating in the desperate return back to Earth. (This
was noticeably absent from the film.  An executive of the production company
that made the movie told me the nuclear portion of the Apollo l3 story was
ommitted as an "artistic decision.")
<p>        
"On the surface of the moon," the book relates. "the tiny generator
posed no danger to anybody" and now it "was on its way home, heading for
just the fiery reentry the doomsayers had feared."  The LEM (Lunar Excursion
Module) that the RTG was left on was targeted, notes LOST MOON, to a "spot
off New Zealand" where, NASA claims, it fell on November 14, l970 without
releasing plutonium and now, still in the ocean (but in an area too deep for
recovery), NASA says in its official listing of its launches of nuclear
materials, it remains "effectively isolated from man's environment."  The
ocean isolated from peoples' environment?  Cassini will be another round of 
this game of spaceborne nuclear Russian roulette.
<p>        
Back to the safe alternative to using nuclear material in space:
the SNAP-9A accident spurred NASA to use solar power on satellites (which is
how satellites are powered today). Indeed, NASA became a pioneer in the
development of photovoltaic solar power.
<p>        
But NASA stuck to plutonium on deep space probes, including Galileo
and now Cassini.  I filed a Freedom of Information Act request two years
before the Galileo launch in l989 asking for government data on alternatives
to plutonium power on Galileo.  I was stonewalled for two years.  Then, a
few weeks after the launch, I finally get the material: solar would have
been quite possible.          
<p>
As one NASA-funded Jet Propulsion Laboratory analysis declared:
"Based on the current study, it appears that a Galileo Jupiter orbiting
mission could be performed with a concentrated photovoltaic solar array
power source without changing the mission sequence or impacting science
objectives." NASA had lied in the debate before the Galileo launch about the
need to use plutonium on that mission.
<p>        
Meanwhile, in 1994, the European Space Agency announced a
"technology milestone" -- development by it of new high-performance silicon
solar cells with 25 percent efficiency that could "profitably be used in
deep space missions," it said in its press release. The newspaper Florida
Today spoke to ESA physicist Carla Signorini in 1995 and she said that "if
given the money to do the work, within five years [ESA] could have solar
cells ready to power a space mission to Saturn."  
<p>        
Dr. Michio Kaku, professor of nuclear physics at the City
University of New York, says that there is "no question" that solar power
and long-life fuel cells would be able to provide the small amount of
electricity on Cassini that is to be produced by the plutonium system.
<p>        
But NASA, the DOE's national nuclear laboratories, the corporations
that have been involved in producing nuclear hardware for space missions and
the U.S. military seek to use nuclear power in space.  
<p>        
"Without reactors in orbit [there is] going to be a long, long
light cord that goes down to the surface of the Earth" bringing up power,
declared Lt. General James Abrahamson, head of the Stategic Defense
Initiative Organization, at the Fifth Annual Symposium on Space Nuclear
Power and Propulsion in Albuquerque in 1988.  "Failure to develop nuclear
power in space could cripple efforts to deploy anti-missile sensors and
weapons in orbit."  
<p>        
That notion, that nuclear power is essential to the military using
"the ultimate high ground" -- space -- continues today in the U.S. military.
In September the Clinton administration announced a plan to develop
nuclear-propelled rockets for military and civilian uses. (A whole chapter
in THE WRONG STUFF is on the military space nuclear area -- intimately tied
into the purportedly civilian activity.)  
<p>        
Held recently was the Fourteenth Annual Symposium on Space Nuclear
Power and Propulsion, again in Albuquerque, jointly sponsored by NASA, DOE
and the Pentagon's Defense Special Weapons Agency. 
<p>        
(Among the presentations at it: scientists from Brookhaven National
Laboratory outlined their plan to rocket high-level nuclear waste into space
-- as long as there is no accident on launch causing the high-level nuclear
waste to douse the Earth.) 
<p>        
One last thing, in terms of odds of space accidents happening, NASA
is, as Dr. Kaku charges, making up the numbers.  I learned this when I first
got into this issue.  After reading the 1985 report on two planned launches
of shuttles to carry plutonium-fueled space probes, I used the Freedom of
Information Act to ask about accident consequences.  It took nine months to
get the info (I've never had such trouble using FOIA as I've had on the
nukes-in-space issue) and when it came NASA acknowledged disaster was
possible if the plutonium was released but insisted that shuttles were
"highly reliable" and that the odds of a catastrophic shuttle accident were
one-in-l00,000.  
<p>
Right after the Challenger blew up, NASA drastically altered those
odds to one-in-76, where they are today.  In science, one only really knows
probabilities through empirical evidence, through extensive experimentation.  
<p>
The physicist Richard Feynmann, on the commission that investigated
the Challenger accident, ended up blasting the NASA oddsmaking system.  "For
a successful technology, reality must take precedence over public relations,
for Nature cannot be fooled," he wrote in his book covering that experience,
WHAT DO YOU CARE WHAT OTHER PEOPLE THINK?  He also wrote a paragraph away:
"NASA owes it to the citizens whom it asks for support to be frank, honest,
and informative, so that these citizens can make the wisest decisions for
the use of their limited resources."  (The cost of the Cassini mission: $3.4
billion.)

The <a href="http://www.afn.org/~fcpj/index.htm">Global Network</a> is 
planning a series of events in coming months
including a series of European meetings in mid-March. Indeed, it is seeking
out organizations in Europe to network with on the trip between March l3 and
22. The European Space Agency is partners with NASA on Cassini, indeed part
of the cost of Cassini comes from the European member nations of ESA.
<p>        
If you're reading this in Europe, call or 
email <a href="mailto:fcpj@afn.org">Bruce Gagnon</a> at the Global
Network to make arrangements for meetings with the folks from the Global
Network -- to learn about and join in the challenge against the
nuclearization and weaponization of space.
<p>        
I will also be on the trip and would be glad to present the video
NUKES IN SPACE to any group, at press conferences, etc., and speak on the
issue. (The video received the WordFest Gold Award at the Houston
International Film and Video Festival, the biggest film and video festival
in the world.) Connect with me at the above E-mail address. 
<p>       
A good World Wide Web site on Cassini is:
http://www.animatedsoftware.com/cassini/cassini.htm.
<p>        
Europe could, of course, be impacted as easily as was Chile and
Bolivia when the Mars space probe and its half-pound of plutonium came down
on those nations, looking to eyewitnesses as a fireball and, it is now
suspected, vaporizing the plutonium as it crashed.  As Pike of the
Federation of American Scientists says: "If you liked Mars 96, you'd love
Cassini."
<p>        
And, after Cassini -- unless there is a stop put to what Bruce
Gagnon accurately describes as this "sheer and utter madness" of
nuclearizing and weaponizing space -- there would be more and more of it.
Catastrophe is inevitably ahead.
<p>       
Thus the big effort to stop the madness now. And the heavy resistance.

<h1>Cassini -- NASA'S Millennial Nuclear Nightmare</h1></a>
<h3>BY CHRIS BRYSON</h3>
<b>Portions of this article were previously printed in the <i>Christian Science
Monitor</i> Dec. 17th, 1996.</b>
<h4>Reprinted by permission</h4>
It was an inky black night on November 16th, as Hector Hermosilla and
his family drove across the Atacama desert in Northern Chile.  Eighty
kilometers west of the town of Calama at 9:50 pm, the security guard
slowed  his car to cross the tracks of the main Chile-to-Bolivia
railroad.  Glancing left to check for trains, he noticed a fiery bright
light in the sky over some nearby hills:  an "immense sphere of burning
red with a great tail," he told the Guardian in his first international
media interview.  In the silence of the desert night, the family got out
of the car and stared as the blazing object traveled from north to
south, flaming and breaking up "like a comet."
<p>
Post-graduate geology student Leo Alvarado also witnessed the accident
and telephoned the local Northern Catholic University.  He spoke with
Dr. Luis Barrera, director of the University's Astronomy Institute.  It
wasn't the only call Dr. Barrera got about the mysterious desert light. 
A group of geologists also reported an object burning-up in the sky, in
the same location and at the same time. Dr. Barrera thought he knew what
they had seen.  He had been following the press and Internet accounts of
the failed Russian Mars '96 space mission, including the revised U.S.
Space Command estimate that the crippled probe may have come down over
Chile or Bolivia, not the Pacific Ocean or Australia as first reported. 
Initial American press accounts said that the 200 grams of toxic
plutonium, which the craft had been carrying as an on-board power
source, would remain intact on reentry.  But Dr. Barrera believes the
eyewitness accounts of the object burning brilliantly and traveling in
the shallowest of descents for several minutes, meant that the Alvarados
and the geologists had probably witnessed the probe and its plutonium
cargo vaporizing in the earth's atmosphere.
<p>
Aerosol plutonium particles drifting back to earth is bad news for the
folks in Northern Chile.  "That could be very serious for health," said
Dr. John Gofman, a University of Berkeley physicist who worked on the
Manhattan Project in the 1940's.  "If it burned up and formed fine
plutonium oxide particles, those particles are on their way down," he
said.  He notes that most of the fission products from the atomic bomb
testing of the 1940's and 1950's fell to earth within a few years.  "I
would think people would be concerned with staying there," Gofman
warned.  "There would be an increased hazard of lung cancer."
<p>
The Mars '96 crash is also bad news for NASA.  The world's attention is
now firmly fixed on a planned launch in October of 1997, of a Titan IVA
rocket carrying a probe to photograph Saturn and its moons.  That
Cassini mission will have 72.3 pounds of plutonium 238 on board, the
largest volume of radioactive material ever placed into space.  Like the
Russian craft, the plutonium cargo is intended to provide onboard
electrical power for the mission.  There is mounting concern that a
similar launch failure risks a global environmental disaster, and that
using plutonium for Cassini is unnecessary given recent advances in
solar power alternatives.  
<p>
"If you liked Mars '96, you'll love Cassini," says John Pike, head of
space policy at the Federation of American Scientists.  He notes that in
1993 a similar Titan IVa rocket blew up a minute and a half out of
California's Vandenburg Air Force Base, sending a billion dollar
classified military satellite plunging into the Pacific Ocean.  A
similar failure following Cassini's blast off from the Kennedy Space
Center in Florida, risks depositing, "a great steaming heap of
plutonium, onto Disney world, right on top of Epcot Center," says Pike. 
He estimates the odds for failure of a Titan IV rocket are "between one
in ten and one and twenty."  
<p>
Even if Cassini safely escapes Earth's atmosphere, the risk of
environmental disaster is not over.  Because its Titan rocket will lack
the power to send the probe to Saturn directly, NASA plans to have
Cassini use the Earth's gravity in a special fly-by maneuver to
"sling-shot" the craft into deep space.  So in 1999, Cassini will
approach Earth at some 42,300 miles per hour and pass within 312 miles
of the planet's surface.  The only previously controlled
"gravity-assisted" fly-bys of Earth were conducted successfully by
NASA's Galileo mission to Jupiter, in 1990 and 1992.  That unmanned
probe was carrying a similar, smaller plutonium cargo.  But if NASA
scientists misfire Cassini's steering rockets as it races towards Earth,
the probe could reenter the planet's atmosphere, with potentially
disastrous consequences.  John Pike of the Federation of American
Scientists says, "if you have a worst conceivable event, in which the
plutonium burns up and is dispersed as a fine aerosol, then it is
astonishingly hazardous, just grotesquely hazardous."
<p>
Despite the Russian Mars 96 accident, NASA remains determined to launch
Cassini.  A December 6th meeting of the project's principal partners at
the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California, including the safety and
launch teams, confirmed that decision.  "Why would we want to cancel it
after the Mars 96 accident" said NASA spokesperson Mary Beth Murrill. 
She insisted that a similar accident was impossible.  "You're assuming
that in reentry these things break up.  That's not what happens.  They
are designed to survive reentry."
<p>
But a catastrophe is possible.  For 25 years, Dr. Horst Poehler worked
as a senior engineer at the Kennedy Space Center for NASA contractors. 
After studying some 30 technical reports on the Cassini mission, he has
concluded that it could produce, "the mother of all accidents."  The
iridium protective layer around the Radioisotope Thermal Generator (RTG)
plutonium packs, he says, is only, "the thickness of your fingernail,"
and could burn through on reentry, or break up on impact with a hard
surface.  "I support NASA when they do right things," he said, but with
Cassini, "they convict themselves with their own reports."
<p>
Even NASA's own Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for the Cassini
mission states that if "an inadvertent reentry occurred, "approximately
five billion of the seven to eight billion people on Earth in 1999,
could receive 99 percent or more of the radiation exposure."  NASA
concludes that the "health effects" from a reentry burn-up would be
2,300 deaths over a 50-year period and that these "latent cancer
fatalities" would likely be "statistically indistinguishable from the
normally occurring cancer fatalities among the world's population."
<p>
That estimate may be tragically wrong.  NASA does not adequately address
the fatal effects of low level radiation, says Dr. Ernest Sternglass, a
professor emeritus of radiological physics at the University of
Pittsburgh's School of Medicine.  He has studied the low-level radiation
health consequences produced by the atomic bomb tests of the 1940's and
1950's, and the nuclear power plant accidents at Three Mile Island and
Chernobyl.  The problem with NASA's Cassini risk estimate, says
Sternglass, is that it is based on data derived from the Hiroshima and
Nagasaki bombing, where low-level radiation was much less-well
understood.  Dramatic new scientific evidence suggests that low-level
radiation is much more dangerous than once imagined.  If Cassini's
plutonium is widely dispersed in the atmosphere, catastrophic health
consequences would follow, says Sternglass, because of the "logarithmic
dose response" of human cells to low-level radiation.  That means, he
says, "that the curve rises very rapidly for tiny doses and flattens out
at higher doses.  Because of this, the small amounts of radiation from
any kind of nuclear accident are hundreds of thousands of times more
damaging than we suspected on the basis of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki
data, which was obtained at very high doses."  Soaring infant leukemia
in Greece after Chernobyl, as reported in Nature earlier this year, and
the 1996 Lancet account of increased congenital hypothyroidism in
newborns in the United States following the Ukrainian reactor meltdown,
confirm the danger of low-level radiation, says Sternglass.  NASA may
have underestimated the Cassini cancer risk alone by a factor of about
2,000 to 4,000 times, he says, adding, "we are dealing with the
possibility of many millions of extra deaths over the next ten or twenty
years following such an accident."
<p>
At least two earlier space accidents have also strewn radiation into the
environment.  In 1978, a Russian Cosmos satellite disintegrated over
Northwestern Canada, leaving a 124,000-square kilometer swath of nuclear
debris.  And in 1964, an American SNAP-9a nuclear satellite burnt up on
reentry, leaving radioactive debris, "present at all continents and all
latitudes," according to a 1989 European OECD report.
<p>
Cassini may have already left a deadly trail.  An Associated Press
account this past July reported how nuclear contamination of workers and
equipment at Los Alamos National Nuclear Laboratory in New Mexico had
dramatically increased between 1993 and 1996.  Laboratory officials
blamed the increase on fabricating the Cassini RTG plutonium packs. With
a half-life of only 88 years, the plutonium 238 used in the Cassini
mission is roughly 300 times more toxic than plutonium 239 used in bomb
making.  The Laboratory reported that the number of incidents of
contamination at its plutonium facility jumped 75 percent between 1993
and 1995, from 139 to 244.  A second internal report found that the
total amount of radiation the entire laboratory work force was exposed
to in 1995, was the highest since 1980.  Much of the increase was found
on worker's clothing, according to Laboratory data.
<p>
NASA's game of nuclear Russian roulette with Cassini may be
unnecessary.  In April 1994, the European Space Agency (ESA) reported
dramatic new advances in solar cells for "use in future demanding
deep-space missions."  ESA was studying solar power because the American
nuclear RTG technology used on the NASA space flights was unavailable in
Europe.  The new silicon cells jointly developed by DASA in Germany and
CISE in Italy, had a record 25% efficiency in the extreme cold and
reduced sunlight of simulated deep-space conditions, ESA said.  Last
year, ESA physicist Carla Signorini told the newspaper Florida Today
that, "if given the money to do the work, within five years ESA could
have solar cells ready to power a space mission to Saturn."
<p>
But redesigning Cassini is unlikely.  The mission is already over budget
and overdue.  Originally, Cassini was to have been launched on the Space
Shuttle, but safety considerations in the wake of the Challenger
accident instead placed the mission on a conventional rocket.  (NASA's
nuclear-powered Ulysses probe to the sun was to have been the next
flight on the Challenger, before it exploded).  Further delay of the $4
billion Cassini program for a multi-year, solar-power design might risk
the entire venture.  Explains John Pike, "maybe if I lived in Epcot
Center I would have one view of it, but if I was a Cassini program
manager and I had all these people working for me and they had kids,
mortgage payments..."
<p>
The shadow of the Pentagon also darkens the Cassini mission.  Three
recent studies by the United States Air Force detail a continued
enthusiasm for the military nuclearization of space.  They make clear,
says John Pike, that "there are a lot of space weapons that you need
nuclear power for."  The Air Force is currently ground-testing
Russian-built Topaz II reactors at its Philips Laboratory in New
Mexico.  A flight test of Topaz II scheduled for December 1995 was
canceled after protests from U.S. astronomers.  Civilian use of nuclear
power has a clear military agenda, says Pike.  "The space nuke guys were
obviously interested in getting the public desensitized to this stuff --
everybody's feeling that Galileo was okay, so if you like Galileo it is
okay for us to fly Topaz II, or whatever..."
<p>
The momentum to nuclearize space continues.  In 1991, NASA and the
Department of Energy signed the Space Nuclear Power Agreement,
restricting death or damage benefits from a U.S. space nuclear
accident.  That Agreement caps U.S. payouts at $7.3 billion, and assigns
a mere $100 million for all damage to other countries and their
populations.  In 1993, the Clinton White House announced that "space
nuclear power and propulsion systems can contribute to scientific,
commercial and national security space missions."  This January, a
symposium at the University of New Mexico sponsored by the Defense
Special Weapons Agency, NASA, the Department of Energy and the Air Force
will include numerous ideas for space nuclearization, including a
presentation from the Brookhaven National Laboratory on the "Disposal of
Long Lived Fission Products Into Outer Space."
<p>
But there is growing unease even in the American scientific community
over Cassini.  Dr. John Gofman, formerly of the Manhattan Project, says
the atomic bomb was a necessary evil of the Cold War, but he now opposes
space nuclearization.  Of Cassini, he says, "I pray that it has a good
mission, but one of these things is not going to do too well one of
these days.  Doesn't the Russian failure tell you something about the
nice assurances that we are never going to have one of these things come
down?"

<h1>Nuclear menace in Outer Space</h1></a>
<h2>Despite the risks, push for nuclear technology in space steps up</h2>
<h3>By Karl Grossman</h3>
<h4>This article originally appeared in The Baltimore Sun on December 8th, 1996.</h4>
<h4>Reprinted online by permission of the author.</h4>
<p>
Remember that Russian space probe, the one carrying a half-pound of 
high-ly radioactive plutonium when it came crashing back to earth last 
month? Initial news reports said the spacecraft fell harmlessly into
the Pacific Ocean, about 1,000 miles southeast of Easter Island, and 2,000
miles northwest of Santiago, Chile.  But on Nov. 29, the U.S. Space
Command reported that the probe may have scattered debris along a path
that's just 20 miles away from a Chilean city. The news release, which
corrected the space command's earlier prediction about where the
probe fell, went virtually unnoticed by the press. It said:
<p>
"U.S. Space Command has developed new information indicating
that the Russian Mars '96 spacecraft likely came down on Nov. 16 
instead of Nov. 17 as earlier reported. Any debris surviving the 
heat of this re-entry would have fallen over a 200-mile-long 
portion of the Pacific Ocean, Chile and Bolivia. We now believe
that the object that re-entered on Nov. 17, which we first thought to be
the Mars '9u probe, was in fact the fourth stage of the booster rocket."
<p>
Plutonium is one of the most toxic substances known. Dr. Helen
Caldicott, founder of Physicians for Social Responsibility, says 
plutonium is so deadly that 'less than one-millionth of a gram 
is carcinogenic."
<p>
The space command's press release continued:
<p>
The area where any debris surviving this re-entry could have fallen
is located along an approximately 50-mile-wide and 200-mile-long path
oriented southwest to northeast. This path is centered approximately
20 miles east Of the Chilean city of Iquique and includes Chilean 
territory, the border area of Bolivia and the Pacific Ocean."
<p>
This incident should serve as a wake-up can to the madness of
launching spacecraft with radioactive material. Six of the 39
missions of the former Soviet Union have failed including the Cosmos 954 
satellite which carried radioactive when when it broke apart as it 
plunged to earth in 1978, scattering a 124,000 square-kilometer 
swath of northwestern Canada with nuclear debris.
<p>
Three of the 24 U.S. missions involving spacecraft with nuclear 
material have met with accidents, including the SNAP-9A. It fell in
1964, disintegrating as it came down. Its 2.1 pounds of plutonium 
fuel vaporized and "dispersed worldwide," according to a report by 
a group of European government agencies.
<p>
Newton's Law of Gravity stands.  What goes up can easily come down.
And if it is a spacecraft containing plutonium, it can contaminate the
air and land as it descends.
<p>
Yet the push to deploy nuclear technology in space continues, in
fact, it is intensifying. In October, 1997, NASA plans to launch the
Cassini probe to Saturn, carrying 72.3 pounds of plutonium fuel  the
largest amount ever used on a space-craft. The launch vehicle is a 
Titan IV rocket, which has been involved in a number of malfunctions, 
including a 1993 explosion that destroyed a billion-dollar 
payloadthree National Security Agency spy satellites.
<p>
If the Titan IV carrying the Cassini explodes on liftoff, it could 
scatter plutonium over a wide area of Florida and cause thousands of cancer
deaths. Much of the world's population would be exposed to radiation it
the spacecraft plunges into Earth's 75-mile-high atmosphere during a
"sling-shot maneuver" in 1999.
<p>
To gain enough velocity to travel to Saturn, the spacecraft will orbit
Venus twice and come speeding back toward Earth at 42,300 miles per
hour. Passing Just 312 miles above the Earth, It will swing around the
planet using centrifugal force to sling it toward Saturn. A slight 
miscalculation could result in an inadvertent re-entry and subsequent
radiation exposure affecting "approximately 5 billion of the
estimated 7 to 8 billion world population," according to NASA's
"Final Environmental Impact Statement on the Cassini Mission."
<p>                                                                              ~' ~
Dr. Horst Poehler, a 22-year veteran of working for NASA contractors
at the Kennedy Space Center, says the shielding for the plutonium on
Cassini is "fingernail thin.  It's a joke."  Of the Cassini mission,
he says, "Rember the old Hollywood movies when a mad scientist would 
risk the world to carry out his particular project? Well, those 
mad scientists have moved to NASA."
<p>
NASA officials say the mission poses an acceptable risk. An 
environrmental impact statement released by NASA in 1994 estimated
the risk of the probe's hitting Earth during its fly-past in 1999 
as 1-in-1.3 million and said there was a 1-in-900
chance of radioactive release during launch.
<p>
The use of plutonium on the $3.4 billion Cassini mission and the 
horriflc danger it represents is unnecessary. The European Space
Agency (ESA) announced in 1994 what it called a 
"technological milestone"the development of high-efficieny solar 
cells to generate the modest amount of electricity needed for deep 
space probes like Cassini. As ESA physicist told the newspaper 
<i>Florida Today</i> in 1995 that if given the money to do the work
ESA "within five years could have solar cells ready to power a space
mission to Saturn."
<p>
But NASA insists on nuclear power for Cassini. This keeps powerful 
government contractors happy. The contractors include Lockheed-Martin 
(which makes the Titan rocket and two years ago took over General 
Electric's aerospace division, a maker of plutonium-fueled space 
systems), the Department of Energy's national nuclear laboratories, 
and the military, which regards nuclear technology as essential 
to dominate space.
<p>
Now, the Pentagon and NASA are embarking on a program to develop 
rockets propelled by nuclear reactors. The first phase of the program 
is to culminate at the end of 1997 in the manufacture and testing
of "multiple nuclear propulsion concepts" with the Defense Special
Weapons Agency selecting "one or more competitors to demonstrate
the systems' reliability," the trade journal Space News reported in a
front-page article. The program is part of a new national space policy
announced Sept. 19th, 1996 by the Clinton administration.
<p>    
President Reagan's so-called "Star Wars" anti-missile system was
predicated on the use of space-based nuclear power: nuclear-propelled 
rockets to lift heavy equipment and orbiting battle platforms
with reactor-powered particle beams, hypervelocity guns and
laser weapons. Any expectations that the Clinton administration
would reject the use of nuclear devices in space vanished just months
after Clinton's inauguration in 1993.
<p>
"Space nuclear power and propulsion systems can contribute
to scientific, commercial and national security space missions," the
White House declared on Aug. 17, 1993.
<p>
The nuclear space work has been going on at places such as the Air
Force's Phillips Laboratory in New Mexico, which has been testing
Russian-made Topaz 2 space nuclear reactors for military use. Other 
U.S. projects under way or planned include "bimodial" nuclear
spacecraft to provide power and propulsion for military satellites;
various nuclear-powered satellites, including a chain to transmit 
high-definition TV signals; nuclear power for colonies on Mars and 
the moon two plutonium-fueled space probes for a 1999 mission to 
Pluto; and a proposal to send "long-lived fission products 
[nuclearwaste] into outer space."
<p>    
NASA's line on the potential for accidents involving nuclear material 
in space is that accidents are highly unlikely. I discovered how
lame this claim was a decade ago when I first began investigating the
use of nuclear technology in space.
<p>
I learned of two shuttle flights in 1986 that were to have plutonium
space probes aboard. One was to have been the mission after the 
illfated Challenger launch. NASA insisted that the likelihood of a 
catastrophic shuttle accident was 1-in-100,000.
<p>    
Then, with the Challenger accident, NASA immediately changed
the odds to 1-in-76, where they remain. In science, only empirical 
evidence can determine true probabilities.
<p>
The fight is against "sheer and utter madness," says Bruce
Gagnon, co-coordinator of the Global Network Against Weapons
and Nuclear Power In Space. The recent Russian space probe incident 
has helped bring the issue home.
<p>
"The danger of a disaster involving a plutonium space project has
now become real and imaginable to the people of the world," says
Gagnon, who believes "our work to stop Cassini and future nuclear 
missions in space will now be greeted with more support than ever."

<h1>U.S. Slinging Plutonium into Space</h1></a>
<h2>By Karl Grossman</h2>

<p>
Despite enormous danger and expense, the U.S. government is
pushing ahead with development of nuclear technology in space.
<p>
In October 1997, NASA is scheduled to launch the Cassini space
probe and with it the largest amount of plutonium ever used in a
space device. The Cassini probe with 72.3 pounds of plutonium-238
fuel aboard, will ride on top of a Lockheed Martin-built Titan IV
rocketa number of which have exploded in the atmosphere.
<p>    
Plutonium is the most toxic substance known. "One pound, if uniformly 
distributed, could hypothetically induce lung cancer in
every person on Earth;" notes Dr. Helen Caldicott, founder of 
Phisicians for Social Responsibility.
<p>    
The Global Network Against Weapons and Nuclear Power in
Space is holding a national meeting in Floridaincluding a protest
demonstration at Cape Canaveralnext Saturday to "stop this sheer
and utter madness," said Bruce Gagnon, the Network's co-coordinator.
<p>
NASA plans to send Cassini hurtling back to Earth for a "swingby,"
to give it the velocity to get to Saturn. It is supposed to buzz the
Earth in 1999 at 42,300 mph and at a height of 312 miles. But if Cassini
comes in too close during this "slingshot maneuver" and there is
an "inadvertent re-entry," the space probe could break up in the
Earth's atmosphere, raining plutonium back down on the Earth's surface.
<p>
If that happens, NASA's "Final Environmental Impact Statement for the 
Cassini Mission" acknowledges: "Approximated 5 billion of the estimated 
7 billion to 8 billion population ... could receive 99 percent or
more of the radiation exposure."
<p>
The United States has sent 24 nuclear devices into space with a 
failure rate of 15 percent. Accidents happen all too often. A
plutonium-fueled power system-was aboard the ill-fated Apollo 13 
mission that crash-landed in the Pacific. The next mission of
the ill-fated Challenger was supposed to carry up a space probe 
with 25 pounds of plutonium.
<p>
There's no reason to risk sending plutonium on spacecraft. The 
European Space Agency in 1994 announced a breakthrough
in the development of "new, high-performance silicon solar cells for 
use in future demanding deep-space missions" to replace plutonium-fueled 
generating systems.  With support and a little time, the European
Space Agency could have solar cells ready for a Saturn mission.
<p>
But NASA; the U.S. Department of Energy, the national nuclear 
laboratories, and the corporations that produce nuclear hardware 
for space missions, insist on staying with nuclear.
<p>
There are other nuclear-fueled space projects on the drawing boards. 
The Sandia Laboratories plan to develop nuclear-powered satellites 
to beam TV signals down to Earth; Topaz II Russian-made reactors,
purchased by the United States for use on orbiting battle platforms 
of "Star Wars," are being ground-tested by the Air Force; an
Air Force program proposes to use nuclear reactors for power and 
propulsion for military satellites, and NASA plans for a
nuclear-powered colony on the moon.
<p>
We must stop the government's reckless and costly plans to use 
nuclear technology in space. If one pound of plutonium could
give everyone on Earth cancer, how much damage could inflicted if 
something goes terribly wrong with the Cassini space probe,
and its 72 pounds of plutonium scatters all over the world?

<h1> What Can Go Wrong With Cassini:</h1></a>
<h2>NASA'S ATTEMPT TO LAUNCH A</h2>
<h2>PLUTONIUM-POWERED SPACE PROBE</h2>
<h5>by Russell D. Hoffman  Copyright (c) 1997</h5>
<hr>
<h3>Who are we that we would launch Cassini on the world?</h3>
<b>Cassini is a space probe scheduled to be launched by NASA in October, 
1997.  It will contain over 72 pounds of plutonium, the deadliest
substance known to mankind.  We are doing this, not because it is
necessary, but because we are arrogant.  Because no one has stopped us.  
Alternative power sources exist--the plutonium is not necessary.</b>
<p>
We have already created radioactive junkyards and chemical wastelands 
all over the country, and in many other places around the world as well, 
such as on remote Pacific islands, deep sea trenches, and our very
groundwater and atmosphere.
<h3>What do you want to be known for?</h3>
Now, our so-called space experts want to destroy the near-earth
regions of outer space.  These regions are of vital importance.  
They are the second-most important part of the entire
universe after our own lovely planet (the one we're spoiling).  We
cannot get to outer space--to the other planets and beyond--if we
pollute near-earth orbit.  And everything we put there pollutes it
and every piece of pollution there destroys it.
<p>
Already, military and civilian clods in space programs around the
world have placed billions of pieces of space junk in orbit in a 
haphazard and careless manner.  It would be like
throwing a bucket of buckshot out of your car every couple of yards
while driving from Boston to San Diego.  Or rather, a bucket of 
tacks for future drivers to avoid...
<p>
Only it's worse, of course, because rather than just sitting on the
ground, your tacks are flying all over the roadsurface at speeds
around 25,000 miles per hour, and the other drivers are
<i>required</i> to travel at that speed as well!  
<p>
And as if that wasn't bad enough, it's a 3-D game where the road
surface is a multi-dimensional sky full of buckshot.  Only some of
it's a lot bigger than buckshot.  And some is a lot smaller.
<p>
The hazard from pieces bigger than buckshot, or even the size of
buckshot, is great.  A piece the size of a marble has the kinetic
energy of a 400 pound safe at 60 miles an hour.  (NASA description.)
<p>
Things much bigger than that we can track a little bit (but not all 
that well, and we loose pieces regularly).  But there are lots of 
deadly things we cannot begin to track but which could damage 
any ship we have ever placed in orbit or have planned for launch
including Cassini.
<p>
With our radar and other surveillance systems, we can only track 
pieces bigger than about 4 inches in diameter
(about 10,000 of them are tracked) but we cannot track them very well,
and we know very well that there are 10 or 100 or 1000 pieces
that could hurt us for every one that we even try to track.  
<p>
<h3>So, what are our choices?</h3>
<p>
It leaves us only one choice.  Chance it.  Every space mission
chances it.  Every single mission is a lottery.  A game of chance.
What they are chancing is the odds of a collision with a
major piece of space junk, where major is generally agreed by
everyone--in and out of the space industry--as being about the size
of a buckshot or BB, and <i>certainly</i> no bigger than a small marble.  
Any piece of space debris, even one the size of a pinhead, can
ruin a spacecraft.  Like airplanes and other high-performance,
low-weight endeavors, virtually everything on the spacecraft is a vital 
system that must be in good working order for the mission to succeed.  At millions of
dollars an ounce, you can bet there are very few ounces 'wasted' on backup
systems.  There may be multiple computers for backup, but generally
there is only one thruster in each direction, one antenna, and one of
most parts.  Everything is designed to work right.  And everything
<i>has to</i> work right!  And everything can get
knocked out by <i>one</i> of billions of pieces of space debris!
<p> 
On Cassini, what little shielding there is around the plutonium power
pack is known by all involved to be totally inadequate for many possible 
reentry or collision scenarios.  It's really only good for certain freefall
failure modes.  Specifically it is designed to withstand up to about
2,000 pounds per square inch (psi) but NASA admits that pressures of
nearly 20,000 psi are possible during launch!  And a collision with
space debris could mean still higher--vastly higher--localized pressures. 
If the shielding is damaged by a piece of space debris, then as the
probe falls through our atmosphere it could be further torn open and it's
deadly plutonium contents burned up and spread throughout our
ecosystem.  
<p>
And it's not even right to say that so far, we have been lucky in our
space launches, so why shouldn't we continue to be lucky in the future?  
We may indeed be lucky in the future.  But future luck doesn't depend 
on past luck no matter what you might have heard.  Luck shines on 
those who don't take unnecessary chances.
<p>
And besides that, we haven't been very lucky in the past.  Statistically 
speaking, the odds really are not very good, judging on past
performance!  If our present trends continue, we shall be very 
<b>unlucky</b> indeed!  Of the nearly two dozen nuclear launches
the U.S. has made, three have already had accidents.  Russia's failure rate
is even worse, including the Fall, 1996 plutonium-packed Mars probe. 
But the Mars probe only had about .7 pounds of plutonium:  Cassini will have
over 72 pounds!
<p>
Numerous space launches, with both nuclear and non-nuclear fuel cells,
have resulted in dismal failures.  Often,
the causes are completely unknown and unknowable.  Man-made space
debris has been cited as a probable cause of numerous failures by Russians, 
Americans, and everyone else.  Failures, that is, of systems that
cost billions of dollars and were <i>not supposed to fail</i>.  
<p>
Either way there is a huge loss and no one knows why.  It may be
space debris, it may be a loose nut out of control.  Titan launch
vehicles have had some dismal launch failures, and with the Cassini
probe, that's only half the battle.  
<p>
<h3>Two years later it gets worse.</h3>
<p>
If all goes right, Cassini is supposed to fly out of earth orbit
shortly after launch.  Then, it will circle Venus to pick up speed, and
then fly <i>back to earth</i> for a close flyby and additional speed
gain in 1999.  How close? 
<h2>TOO CLOSE.</h2>  
<p>
The plan is to fly the spacecraft within 320 miles of earth, at a 
trajectory that will force it to be <i>almost</i> captured by our 
gravitational pull.  If all goes according to plan it will then 
be flung out into the solar system.  
<p>
How close is 320 miles?  Out to about 75 miles, our atmosphere can
exert enough force to slow the probe down and heat the probe up, and
cause it to fall inwards to earth, either crashing or burning up on the 
way in.  320 miles is only 320-75=245 miles above that point.  That's 
pretty close.  If anything slows it, or re-aims it, or runs into it 
we could be staring down the throat of our own poisoned pill.  
<p>
Perhaps a tiny piece of space debris (of which there are billions) will
hit a guidance control system.  If anything like that happens the
probe could come closer to the earth than we want.  If we loose contact
with Cassini it could align itself aimed for earth without our being 
able to stop it.  Earth is a pretty big target when your desired
desination is barely 3 percent of earth's diameter away from
earth and your aim is largely decided many millions of miles away. 
<p>
<h3>It's a close shave even when it's done right!</h3>  
<p>
Even a little mistake can really screw things up!  This is your basic
butterfly effect.  If anything goes the least bit wrong, we could be
in for a pretty rough ride as a species.  Plutonium is a deadly
killer when spread in minute quantities throughout the atmosphere and
that's precisely the way Cassini can crash catastrophically.  It's
nothing to be casual about. There is clearly cause for concern and candor. 
<p>
Instead NASA in engaged in cheap politics to keep its game alive and
to pay off the various players in the field who can make a lot 
of money by the decision to use plutonium instead of far safer 
solar panels.
<p>
After the flyby with Venus, Cassini comes back to earth at a vastly increased
speed. If something goes disasterously wrong and it starts coming 
right at us instead of right next to us (320 miles above earth's
surface) don't think we can send up a rocket to collect it or even 
blow it up.  
<p>
It will be coming nearly
straight at us even if everything goes right, and so having some 
failure could mean it would be coming straight at us--and
uncontrollable.  If we did manage to smack something into it, it
would STILL be coming right at us--just slower and in millions of
pieces--unless we somehow did this millions of miles in outer space
or with some huge projectile either significantly bigger than or traveling
significantly faster than Cassini is--and a
perfect shot at that!  Get real!  Buddy, it ain't gonna happen!  If 
something goes wrong, we might get to watch this poison pill heading 
right for our collective throats for months!  This would have, among
other things, a chilling effect on American prestige as the world
stares up at our forthcoming poisoned present.
<p>
If Cassini comes back at a shallow angle and burns up high in the atmosphere, 
the plutonium will spread it's increased levels of lung and other 
cancers more or less evenly all around the world for
decades to come.  If it manages to make it back to earth but the
shielding is damaged or destroyed, the plutonium will probably be far more 
deadly in the local area where it lands--it could even cause a 
large area (perhaps the size of Manhattan; perhaps Manhattan itself) to 
become uninhabitable for thousands of years.  This one space probe 
can most certainly do all that.  
<p>
There is no engineering principal or marvel at work that 
can prevent such a disaster.  It's called a "worst case scenario" and  
it's real bad.  And as long as we launch the plutonium over
alternative methods, there's not a bit of science involved that can
prevent the 'worst case scenario'.  Reduce the risk, yes.  But prevent it?  No.  
<p>
If we launch plutonium, only being lucky will prevent it.  We're
<i>not</i> relying on technology here!  We're relying on luck!  This
is <i>not</i> the high-tech wonder we were looking for!  This is
yesterday's flawed low-tech crud recycled as innovative space
exploration.  Don't buy it.  It's past its expiration date.  
<p>
Just a little bad luck is really all it takes.  And 
NASA knows this.  Instead of using a technological solution to the
problem they decided for who-knows-what-reason to use <b>a statistical
calculation of the chances of impact with orbital debris
greater than approximately 4mm during various phases of flight</b> or
some such nonsense.  But don't let the high-sounding technical 
terminology fool you.  What they mean is we are relying on <i>luck</i>.
<p>
We could have used a technological solution that
the scientists would be proud of--European solar panels.  By
eliminating the plutonium power pack virtually all the dangers cited
here are eliminated or reduced to millionth's of what they are when
using plutonium.  But instead we <i>are</i> using plutonium and relying 
on 'luck'.  And NASA has <i>not</i> been lucky.
<p>
Let's call Cassini by what it really is:  A proposal to launch chemical
roulette warfare against the people of the planet earth by 
its own citizens!  Can anyone think of a more ludicrous thing?  
Have we all gone mad?
<h3>Well, have we?</h3>
<p>
Aiming this 'weapon' right at our own throats when a non-nuclear
option could have been purchased on the open market from Europe--our
friends and allies--is truly the height of arrogance and stupidity. 
We should all be ashamed of ourselves as Americans and as citizens of
a global community.
<p>
If that probe collides with <i>anything</i> that's already up there, or if
its launch vehicle has virtually any kind of malfunction, there
will be more than 72 pounds of plutonium spread throughout our upper
atmosphere and near-earth orbital area.  This is <i>insane</i> and the
people approving it and building it should be declared so!  And the
people paying for it as well!  That's US!  In our throats indeed! 
Plutonium is the most deadly substance known to man, and spreading it
throughout our atmosphere is the most deadly thing we can do with it.
<p>
We have to stop Cassini by whatever nonviolent means it can be done. 
There is no doubt as I write this that in the time left before the 
scheduled launch (less than a year), concerned Americans and 
citizens around the world can convince enough people so that an 
injunction or other legal means can be found to stop the Cassini 
probe.  
<p>
We are not asking to halt space exploration.  We are even willing to 
continue to put billions and billions of our hard-earned tax dollars
into tens of thousands of employees in white lab coats just to see
what they'll come up with.  But it better be safe, whatever it is! 
We cannot risk poisoning the planet and millions of 
horrific deaths from yet another failed NASA science experiment!
<h2>NO NUKES IN SPACE!</h2>
<h4>Stop Cassini before it stops us!</h4>
Write to congress, our president, and our so-called environmentalist
vice president and tell them you're fed up with nuclear power in
space!  It doesn't belong there!
<p>
To the best of my knowledge, the facts as presented in this 
article are of little dispute, most being taken
directly from NASA itself.  It is only the conclusions on which we
(NASA vs. the environmentalists) differ.  NASA says it's safe enough
to launch.  They try to convince us that they have 'minimized risks'
significantly enough to make it safe 'in spite of the risks'.  But their
idea of safe enough is whatever level of safety we'll let them get
away with.  Cassini isn't safe and it can't be made safe.  
<p>
It can't be, for one reason because they cannot
prevent random collisions with billions of manmade pieces of space
debris (and quite a few natural ones as well during the flight to
Venus and back).  They can only guess that it won't happen.  They
cannot engineer anything well enough to stop the possibility of
disaster, even in their own minds.  They don't even claim to.  
They merely claim the risk is low enough to satisfy their opinion of
whatever a 'safe level of risk' is that will still permit them to
launch.  
<h3>Why risk anything?</h3>
The other reason it cannot be made safe enough is this: What level 
of risk is safe enough when there is an alternative that is millions
of times safer--to use solar power instead?   Only boondoggle
politics at the highest levels permitted the shameful decision to 
'go nuclear' when a safe alternative was available, and those
responsible should be exposed for what they've done and publicly
shamed.  Nuclear power does not belong in space (or anywhere else).
<p>
Alternative power sources are available.  We can do this
<i>right</i>.  In a fit of incredible arrogance or ignorance or both,
NASA failed to use the safe option.  We must not let human inertia
push this crazy project to completion just because we were not alert
enough to stop it.  We have to stop Cassini <i>before</i> the risk is
taken.
<h3>Is it too late to stop it?</h3>
It's not too late, until they press the "Ignite Stage 1 Booster
Rockets" button.  Even after that, the second dangerous
part--the flyby with earth in 1999--can still, at least in theory, be
stopped.  And should be.
<h3>What About the Money?</h3>
If someone put a dumb-dumb bullet in a gun, spun the barrel, aimed it
at your head, and then asked for your permission to pull the trigger, 
would it make any difference to you if you had paid for the bullet?  
"The money has already been spent" is a ludicrous reason to endanger 
the world this way.  Would we continue a war just because we had 
already paid for the weapons?

<h1>APOLLO OUTTAKES</h1></a>
<h2>by Karl Grossman and Judith Long</h2>
<h3>This article originally appeared in The Nation, September 11th, 1995</h3>
<h4>Reprinted by permission of Karl Grossman</h4>
<p>
Apollo 13, the movie blockbuster of the summer,
was an "exciting piece of reality" to Theresa
Crowley, an anchor at WCBS, a New York City
all-news radio station. Yes, said her guest, Dick
Wild, a former systems engineer on the ill-fated 
Apollo mission, "nothing was added."
<p>    
Perhaps nothing was added to the story of the three astronauts 
shipwrecked in space in the spring of 1970, but a significant 
element of the story was <b>left out</b>: Apollo 13 carried
a nuclear device. Aboard the lunar excursion module, or
LEM, was a SNAP-27 (Systems for Nuclear Auxiliary Power)
to supply energy for experiments on the moon. Slated to be left 
there, the SNAP-27 contained 8.3 pounds of plutonium
a radioactive material so toxic that less than a millionth of
a gram can give a person cancer.
<p>
The plutonium-fueled SNAP-27 was still aboard the LEM
when the astronauts, forced to abandon their malfunctioning 
command ship, used the LEM as their lifeboat. As Apollo 13 
commander Jim Lovell, one of the three astronauts, put
it in his book, <i>Lost Moon: The Perilous Voyage of Apollo 13</i>,
upon which the film was based:
<p>
<dl><dd>
<i>On the surface of the moon, the tiny generator posed no danger to 
anybody. But what, some people worried . . . would happen
if the little rod of nuclear fuel never made it to the moon?
What if the Saturn 5 rocket blew up before the spacecraft even
reached Earth orbit, dropping the [plutonium] who knows
where? . . . now Apollo 13's LEM was on it's way home, heading
for just the fiery reentry the doomsayers had feared.</i>
</dl>
<p>
Not only were the three astronauts in danger of losing their
lives. Millions of people were in danger of nuclear contamination 
if the astronauts' high-risk return to Earth went awry.
<p>
In the movie, the LEM, haven and lifeboat in space, is jettisoned 
for the astronauts' perilous reentry into the Earth's
atmosphere in their damaged command ship. The LEM seems
to float off into the void, briefly mourned by its former inhabitants. 
Actually, however, it plunged to Earth. NASA, says
Lovell, aimed the LEM and its plutonium capsule toward a
"spot off New Zealand" in the Pacific.
<p>
Fortunately, the plutonium container survived re-entry and,
according to NASA documents, was "successfully targeted
to deposit intact in the Tonga Trench in the South Pacific
where it is effectively isolated from man's environment." It
remains there to this day.
<p>
Is the ocean isolated from our environment? The plutonium in 
Apollo 13's capsule will be hotly radioactive for
2,000 years.
<p>
Why was the plutonium story left out of the movie?
Michael Rosenberg, executive vice president of Imagine
Entertainment, which produced Apollo 13, says the omission
was "an artist decision." NASA, no doubt, was grateful.
Apollo 13 posed a much larger danger than NASA wants the
publicthen or nowto realize. And NASA, along with the
military and the Adminstration, continues to push ahead
with the deployment of nuclear devices in space. Among the
projects on the nuclear drawing board:
<p>
<i>The 1997 Cassini mission to Saturn.</i> The space probe will
be loaded with 72.3 pounds of plutonium, more than has ever
been sent into space. It will be launched atop a Titan IV rocket, 
a rocket plagued by a serial of explosions on launch. (A
Titan IV blowup in 1993 destroyed a billion-dollar spy satelite.) 
Cassini, like the Apollo 13 rescue, will use a "slingshot"
maneuver to gain momentum, hurtling the probe toward
Earth for a "flyby" at 42,300 miles an hour. If Cassini is 
accidentally drawn into the Earth's atmosphere and its plutonium
capsule doesn't survive like Apollo's SNAP-27, "approximately 5 
billion of the estimated 7 to 8 billion world population . . . 
could receive 99 percent or more of the radiation
exposure," says NASA's environmental impact statement.
<p>
<i>"Star Wars."</i> Topaz 2 space nuclear reactors are currency
being ground-tested at the Air Force's Phillips Laboratory in
New Mexico. These "Chernobyls in the sky" were purchased
from Russia for placement on orbiting battle platforms to
provide power for hypervelocity guns, particle beams and laser
weapons of the Strategic Defense Initiative, renamed Ballistic
Missile Defense by the Clinton Administration and continued 
at a budget of more than $3 billion a year (an amount
Newt Gingrich pledges to increase as part of the Contract
With America).
<p>    
As Apollo 13's SNAP-27 lies in the depths of the Tonga
Trench, people can only hope its ceramic casing will last for
2,000 years. But Cassini can be run on solar power and Star
Wars can be stopped. Antinuclear groups around the world
are active. On the island of Kauai in Hawaii, Star Wars test
firings have met with demonstrations and arrests. The Green
Party in Germany and activists in other European countries
are organizing against the Cassini mission. And worldwide
efforts are being coordinated by the Global Network Against
Nuclear Power and Weapons in Space. 
<p>
In Apollo 13, Marilyn Lovell, wife of the endangered astronaut, 
tries to get the truth about her husband's peril. She
screams at a NASA bureaucrat, "Don't give me that NASA
[Bull]!" That could become a rallying cry.

<h1>Nuclear Space Missions Break Down Political Barriers</h1></a>
<h2>by Karl Grossman</h2>
<h3>This article orignially appeared in Just Peace, Florida's Peace & Justice Newspaper, Fall, 1993 (Issue #28)</h3>
<h4>Reprinted by permission of the author</h4>
<p>
The most recent NASA mishap, the loss of the $1 billion Mars Observer 
in late August, coming on the heels of a multi-billion dollar
series of U.S. space fiascoes, has raised questions about the nation's 
ability to manage its space program.
<p>
Well they should.
<p>
NASA, despite efforts at reform, continues to be an agency with an
institutional culture of arrogance. Policy aims are still fuzzy. U.S. space
activities have increasingly become mired in wildly dubious military
schemes. And there is a lack of concern for the tax dollar.
<p>
Further, NASA continues to push for projects which not only could waste
more billions of tax dollars but could cost the lives of peoplesmany lives.
<p>
NASA, for example, is readying a 1997 launch of a space probe
to carry 73 pounds of deadly plutonium -- the most plutonium ever
carried into space.
<p>
That amount of plutonium, if dispersed in an accident, is theoretically
enough to give a lethal dose cancer to everyone on Earth.
<p>
The plutonium is to be used in a power source on a space probe called
Cassini which is to explore Saturn.
<p>
It is to be launched on a Titan IV rocket.
<p>
That's the same rocket that on August 2 exploded over the Pacific, 
destroying its secret payload, a $2 billion spy satellite system.
<p>
Also, in the Titan IV rocket will be a second rocket, a Centaur,
to which the Cassini probe will be attached and is supposed to 
propel it to Saturn, once both are ejected from the Titan IV.
<p>
If this Titan IV blows up, it would easily cause the Centaur, a 
particularly volatile liquid-fueled rocket, to erupt as well. 
Vaporized in such a double explosion, the plutonium would be 
dispersed far and wide.
<p>  
Even if the Cassini probe is successfully launched into space
on the Titan IV, that does not end the danger.
<p>
The Centaur rocket does not have the power to get Cassini to Satum. So
what NASA plans is a "slingshot maneuver." The probe, after entering 
space, would then be aimed back at the Earth, to whip around the 
planet 320 miles overhead. The object: to make use of Earth's 
gravity to increase Cassini's velocity so it can get to 
Saturn . . . as long as there is no foul-up.
<p>
Too deep a descent on the Earth "flyby" could cause Cassini to 
disintegrate in the Earth's atmosphere and the plutonium, "the most
toxic chemical known to science, to shower down and a tremendous
tragedy for the people of the Earth to result," says Dr. Michio Kaku,
professor of nuclear physics at the City University of New Yolk.
<p>
The only times such a "slingshot maneuver" involving the Earth and a
plutonium space probe were attempted before were in 1990 and 1992
with the problem-plagued Galileo space probe which carried 50 pounds
of plutonium.

<DL><DT><i>"Sorry, sir.  We lost your slacks.  We're hoping they show
up.  Your coat accidentally caught fire.  While it was being pressed
your wife's blouse fell apart... That'll be $3 billion, please...</i>
</DL>
<p>
<hr>
<p>
Thankfully, the Galileo passed the Earth on its two passes --
although its main communications antenna remains unfurled as it heads
on to Jupiter, leaving the $1.4 billion mission crippled.
<p>
We made it twice. And in NASA's arrogant game of space-borne nuclear
Russian roulette, the people of Earth are to be put at lethal risk again.
<p>
It is important to note that the plutonium has nothing to do with
getting the Cassini probe from here to (hopefully) there. It's being
used in three radioisotope thermal generators (RTG's) that are to
provide electricity for the probe - although some scientists like Dr.
Kaku consider a combination of solar Photovoltaic electric power
and long-lived fuel cells now feasible for space probe flights, even
to as far as Saturn.
<p>
Indeed, documents from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) released 
to me after the Galileo launch conceded that this mission "could be
performed with a concentrated photoyoltaic solar array power source
without changing the mission sequence or impracting science
objectives."
<p>
Meanwhile, NASA has plans for two follow-up plutonium space probe
flights in 1999 to Pluto.
<p>
And the Department of Energy (DOE) which, with its national
nuclear laboratories, is in charge of developing NASA's plutonium
power sources is preparing to import plutonium from Russia for
these and other U.S. plutonium-fueled space operations.
<p>
The Department of Defense (DOD) has also been deeply involved in U.S.
nuclear space activities and has obtained two Topaz II space nuclear
reactors from Russia and wants to buy four more.
<p>
It planned its first launch of a Topaz II in 1995, but that flight
has been postponed after objections from scientists concerned
about the impact of radiation emitted by Topaz on instruments
aboard space satellites and protests from opponents of the 
deployment of space borne weapons and nuclear power.
<p>
Topaz flights would leave "a trail" of nuclear particles in earth
orbit, complained University of Chicago astrophysicist Don Lamb.
<p>
"Topaz reflects the intention of the Pentagon to develop large-scale 
power capability in space, and we know that the only use of
such capability is for weapons," says Bruce Gagnon, co-coordinator 
of the Global Network Against Weapons and Nuclear Power in
Space. "Even though there is now a supposed delay of the 1995 flight
test, the military is ground-testing Topaz at the Air Force's
Phillops Laboratory in New Mexico."
<p>
Topaz reactor would be a "flying Chernobyl," says Gagnon, whose
group is based in Florida, where from Kennedy Space Center Topaz
would be launched.
<p>
It is not a plutonium device but a complete nuclear reactor," he notes,
"and we could face the same type of problem we saw at Chernobyl -- and
maybe worse if an accident scattered radioactive debris more widely."
<p>
The DOD initially planned to acquire the Topaz reactor as a power
source for laser weapons, hypervelocity guns and neutral particle
beams on orbiting battle platforms for "Star Wars."
<p>
What the use of the Topaz would now be with "Star Wars" supposedly 
canceled by the Clinton Administration is unclearother than the 
revealing point made by John Stevens of the Martin Marietta 
Corporation at the Tenth Annual Symposium on Space Nuclear Power 
and Propulsion held earlier this year in New Mexico. "The Topaz flight 
will break down political barriers for use of nuclear power in space," he
declared. Martin Marietta has bought General Electric's Astro-Space 
Division and is now the leading U.S. manufacturer of nuclear space 
devices. (The Global Network Against Weapons & Nuclear Power in 
Space will be organizing demonstrations at the Eleventh annual 
Symposium on Space Nuclear Power and Propulsion to be held January 9-10, 
1994, again in Albuquerque, New Mexico.)
<p>
Meanwhile, a series of missile launches from the island of Kanai
in Hawaii arranged to test "space weapons" systems began earlier
this year, and is continuing. The most recent launch in what is now
called the "Stars" program occurred on August 24.'
<p>
There were arrests of protesters concerned that an accident involving
the old, modified Polaris missiles being fired could devastate their 
"garden island."
<p>
And it is not just a beautiful Hawaiian island in jeopardy:
people all over the Earth are threatened by America's misfocused,
weaponized, wasteful, nuclearized - and highly accident-prone --
space program.

<h1>We Don't Need Reactors in Space</h1></a>
<h2>Ignoring safe solar power, we send plutonium-laden probes into orbit</h2>
<h3>Viewpoint By Karl Grossman</h3>
<b>This article originally appeared in <i>Newsday: The Long Island Newspaper</i> May 31st, 1991.</b>
<h4>Reprinted by permission of the author</h4>
<p>
While getting into position to make a low-level (186-mile high), high-speed
(33,000 miles an hour) "flyby" of the Earth, the Galileo plutonium-fueled 
space probe has gone out of whack.
<p>
The probe, which is supposed to send us information about Jupiter and 
its moons, unexpectedly shut down all but in essential functions
in late March. It took the National Aeronautics and Space 
Administration 13 days to fix that. Then NASA ordered the probe to 
unfurl its main communications antenna. But the antenna wouldn't 
unfurl. Next, on May 2, all but essential functions were lost again.
<p>
NASA blames the March and May malfunctions on a "stray electronic signal." 
It still can't figure out why the antenna isn't working.
<p>
Galileo, with its 50 pounds of plutonium aboard - theoretically enough to 
give a lethal dose of lung cancer to everyone on Earth - will be buzzing 
our planet in December, 1992. This "slingshot maneuver" is designed to 
use the Earth's gravity to give Galileo the velocity to get to Jupiter.
<p>
It is to be hoped that there will be no foul-ups in Galileo'a functioning 
then, causing it to make what is called an "Earth-impacting trajectory."
<p>
With the probe just above the Earth's atmosphere on the flyby, it would 
take only a small malfunction to cause it to drop and disintegrate,
showering plutonium down on Earth.
<p>
The United States is proceeding rapidly with the nuclearization of space, 
and the threat we face from Galileo is the kind of danger we will be 
undergoing constantly if we allow the government to continue to send 
nuclear hardware into space. <b>If we tolerate Chernobyls in the sky, 
deadly accidents will be inevitable.</b>
<p>
Yet this risk is unnecessary. The potential catastrophes are 
avoidable. After Galileo was launched in 1989, I received, under 
the Freedom of Information Act, NASA-funded studies declaring
that nuclear power was <b>not necessary</b> to generate electricity 
on the Galileo mission; solar energy would do.
<p>
The plutonium on board Galileo is being used not for propulsion but 
as fuel in generators providing a mere 560 watts of electricity for 
the probe's instruments - electricity that could be produced instead
by solar energy. A decade ago NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory concluded: 
"A Galileo Jupiter-orbiting mission could be performed with a 
concentrated photovoltaic solar array [panels converting sunlight to 
electricity] power source without changing the mission sequence or 
impacting science objectives." Five years ago, another JPL study said
that it would take only two to three years to build the alternative 
solar-power source. Still another JPL report stressed that using the 
sun for power would cost less than using plutonium. It is humanity's 
destiny to explore the heavens, but what a folly it will be if in 
doing this, we needlessly cause the deaths of tens of thousands of 
people and contaminate the Earth with deadly plutonium.
<p>
The federal government and its national laboratories, zealous about 
nuclear power of all sorts, are pushing nuclear technology in space. 
So are space contractors such as General Electric, which produces 
nuclear space devices (including those on Galileo) and is having 
a hard time peddling nuclear power for use on Earth.
<p>
Star Wars is contingent on the launching of 100 orbiting battle 
platforms, each with a large nuclear reactor to provide power for its
laser weapons, hypervelocity guns and particle beams. GE is now busy 
manufacturing what is to be the main Star Wars space reactor, the SP-100.
<p>
In coming days, the Synthesis Group, a panel established last year (1990) 
by NASA and the White House, is expected to recommend nuclear-powered 
rockets for the manned Moon-Mars missions proposed by President George Bush.
<p>
And the Pentagon, amid great secrecy to avoid public objections (<i>not</i> 
for national defense reasons) is developing a nuclear-propelled rocket 
to haul Star Wars weaponry into space. To spread radioactivity, a 
nuclear-propelled rocket need not crash back to Earth. As they fly, these 
rockets would inevitably trail clouds of radioactivity in their exhaust. 
A flight test in space above Antarctica is being planned for the
Star Wars nuclear rocket. It seems the location was chosen so that if 
there is a malfunction, the chief victims would be penguins. Unfortuntely, 
New Zealand also gets in the way. One U.S. government study says that
the likelihood of the nuclear-powered rocket crashing into New Zealand 
is 1 in 2,325.  This may sound like fairly good odds, but remember, NASA
put the odds of a space shuttle crash at 1 in 100,000, before the 
Challenger exploded.
<p>
The record of nuclear power in space is poor. The United States has 
launched 24 nuclear-fueled space devices, including a navigational 
satellite with plutonium aboard that disintegrated in the atmosphere 
as it plunged to Earth in 1964. The U.S. failure rate for nuclear-powered 
space devices has been about 15 percent. The Soviet Union has the same 
failure rate. The Soviets have sent up more than 30 nuclear-fueled 
devices, including the Kosmos 954, which littered a broad swath of 
Canada with radioactive debris when it crashed in 1978.
<p>
The United States spent some $2 billion of taxpayer money on developing
nuclear-powered rockets from 1955 to 1973, but none ever got off the 
ground.  That effort was finally canceled because of the concern that 
a rocket might crash to Earth.
<p>
Now we're turning to nuclear power in space -- with its inevitable 
mishaps -- again.  Last year the United States launched the Ulysses 
plutonium-fueled probe to survey the sun. A December Associated 
Press dispatch noted, "The Ulysses spacecraft is wobbling like an 
off-balance washing machine, threatening to cripple the $760-million 
mission." Fortunately, the probe is not coming back for an
Earth flyby.
<p>
The U.S. government prefers nuclear power even when solar energy 
is an ideal alternative, as on Ulysses. For the 1996 Comet Rendezvous 
Asteroid Flyby mission, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory has said 
that solar energy could replace plutonium power. There is plenty of 
time to arrange the solar alternative. Nevertheless, NASA last year 
began contract negotiations with GE to build plutonium-fueled 
generators for this mission.
<p>
Even for Star Wars, solar power could suffice (that is, if we want 
Star Wars in any form). Pressed at a congressional hearing in 1988 on
"The Future of Space Nuclear Power," Col. George Hess, then of the 
Strategic Defense Initiative Organization, the Pentagon's Star Wars 
office, declared: "I believe in the inventiveness of the American 
engineer, sir; that if we were restricted to have no nuclear power 
that we would address other options."
<p>
But other options have not been - and are not being - addressed. NASA 
and the Defense and Energy Departments have just opened up a Nuclear 
Propulsion Systems Office to develop nuclear-powered rockets for 
both space exploration and Star Wars.
<p>
The United States is even balking at the UN General Assembly's 
efforts to set international rules restricting nuclear power in 
space.  The Pentagon complains that the proposed UN guidelines could pose 
obstacles to Star Wars; NASA fears constraints on its missions.
<p>
Good sense, the profound dangers of radioactivity, the lessons of history, 
economic limits and even the law of gravity are being ignored as the 
United States veers from safe alternatives to nuclearize space.

<h1>Kiss Florida Goodbye?</h1></a>

<p>
<b>Old Westbury, N.Y.</b>
<p>    
The countdown to potentially  unparalleled disaster has begun. This
afternoon the National Aeronautics and Space Administration plans to launch
the space shuttle Atlantis, with its space probe containing 49.25 pounds of
lethal plutonium. From the moment the button at the Kennedy Space Center is
pushed to the two high-speed, low-level "flybys" of Earth by the probe in 
1980 and 1992, great danger is at hand.
<p>
NASA is pushing ahead with the Galileo mission despite strong
opposition from citizens' groups and its own revised estimate of a 
major shuttle accidentfrom 1 in 100,000 before the Challenger 
disaster to 1 in 78.
<p>
If an accident occurs on the launch pad or in a Challenger-like 
explosion in the lower atmosphere, a "catastrophic incident" will 
result, says Michio Kaku, professor of nuclear physics at the City 
University of New York. The radioactive plutonium would float in a 
plume, and where it falls, he sags, tens of thousands of people 
could die.
<p>
The risk is high because less than a millionth of a gram of plutonium 
is a fatal dose and, Dr. Kaku notes, "a single pound, if it were 
pulverized and spread throughout the planet, could indeed kill 
everyone on Earth."
<p>
If the plutonium were "dispersed in fine pieces over Florida," says John
Gofman, former associate director of the Lawrence Livermore National
Laboratory, "kiss Florida goodbye."
<p>
Furthermore, the threat won't end when the probe is launched from the
shuttle in orbit, because the probe won't go directly to Jupiter.  It 
will first go to Venus, then be sent hurting back to Earth, then back 
to space and back to Earth again, using gravitational pull to
increase velocity. On the second Earth flyby, the probe will be only 
185 miles overhead and moving at more than 30,000 miles per hourthe 
fastest manmade obect ever to buzz the Earth.
<p>
If, on a flyby, the probe should plummet to Earth, disintegrating as it
hits the atmosphere, there could be a widespread dispersal of
plutonium.
<p>
If all 49.25 pounds of plutonium were released, according to Dr.
Gofman, it would result in "more than the combined plutonium 
radioactivity returned to Earth in the fallout from all the 
nuclear-weapons testing of the United States, the Soviet Union and the
United Kingdom."
<p>
Those involved in the mission concede the threat will go on for years.
A safety analysis done by General Electric, the manufacturer of Galileo's
plutonium hardware, states that only after the 1992 flyby and "escape of the
spacecraft from the Earth's gravitation pull" will the plutonium "no longer
present a potential risk to the Earth's population."
<p>
NASA's record with nuclear power sources is poor. In 22 launches
involving such devices, three ended in failure, including a satellite 
that crashed back into the atmosphere in 1964. The plutonium it 
released contributed to global lung cancer rates, says Dr.
Gofman, who has studied the incident for more than 20 years.
<p>
Why is this gigantic risk being taken when knowledgeable opponents argue
that other potential sources of power for the probe, such as solar 
energy and long-lived fuel cells, might be used?
<p>
Use of nuclear power in space provides a market for G. E., which for
years has been hard-pressed to sell its nuclear power plants. It also 
fits the nuclear-power agendas of the Department of Energy and national
nuclear labs, which have been given the responsibility to provide 
power systems for NASA's probes.
<p>
The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a prime NASA contractor, supports the
Galileo mission because it will contribute "significantly to our
defence capability particulary in the areas of communication, navigation
and radiation tolerance."
<p>
Thus, Galileo and next year's Ulysses plutonium-powered probe to the sun
(which would have been Callenger's next mission) will pave the way 
for launches of substantial amounts of military nuclear devices into space
in the 1990's. They include the G.E.-built SP-100 space reactor to 
provide power for the lasers and weapons platforms of
the Strategic Defense Initiative.
<p>
In 1986, warnings of disaster ahead were ignored and the lives of seven
brave people aboard the Challenger were snuffed Out. Now the lives of far,
far more people are threatened.

<h1>PLUTONIUM SHUTTLE</h1></a>
<h2>THE SPACE PROBE'S LETHAL CARGO</h2>
<h3>by Karl Grossman</h3>
<h3>This article originally appeared in The Nation, January 23, 1988</h3>
<h4>Reprinted by permission of the author</h4>
<p>
Two years ago on January 28, the space shuttle Challenger exploded 
seventy-three seconds after liftoff. Despite that disaster, however, 
and despite continuing problems with the shuttle booster rockets, 
the National Aeronautics and Space Administration plans to launch 
two space shuttles, one in 1989 and another in 1990, each carrying 
a space probe utilizing what scientists have called the most toxic 
substance in the universe: plutonium. Each will contain more than 
enough plutonium to kill every person on Earth.
<p>
Theoretically, one pound of plutonium, uniformly distributed -- a few 
millionths of a gram ending up in each person's lungs -- has the 
potential to give everyone on the planet a fatal case of lung 
cancer. The 1989 space probe, Project Galileo, is to contain 49.25 
pounds of plutonium dioxide, most of that plutonium 238, its most 
radioactive isotope. The 1990 space probe, Project Ulysses, is 
to contain 24.2 pounds of plutonium dioxide, also mostly 
plutonium 238. If those amounts of plutonium were dispersed in a
Challenger-type explosion, according to Michio Kaku, professor of 
nuclear physics at the City University of New York, there could 
be a "catastrophic incident" with a death toll in the thousands 
or tens of thousands. "It would be tragic if in the exploration of 
space we pollute the Earth as a byproduct. I think this is precisely
what is happening here."
<p>
Plutonium 238 is 300 times more radioactive than plutonium 239, the 
radioisotope used as the fuel for atomic bombs, points out 
Dr. John Gofman, professor emeritus of medical physics at the
University of California, Berkeley, and a former
associate director of the Lawrence Livermore National
Laboratory. "If the plutonium [from Project Galileo] gets
dispersed in fine pieces, the amount of radioactivity released
would be more than the combined plutonimn radioactivity
returned to Earth in the fallout from all the nuclear weapons
testing of the United States, the Soviet Union and the United
Kingdom," which he estimates would cause 950,000 lung cancer 
deaths. "If it gets dispersed over Florida, kiss Florida goodbye. 
If it gets dispersed over Georgia, kiss Georgia goodbye."
<p>
Some scientists, chiefly from the national nuclear laboratory 
system and the nuclear industry, concede that plutonium is 
toxic but say its connection to cancer and to death in
humans has yet to be proved. "The inhalation of plutonium
particles can be a nontoxic, innocuous event," insists Waldo
Cohn, a retired Oak Ridge National Laboratory biochemist.
In reply, critics of nuclear technology point to experiments
in which minute amounts of plutonium have caused death in
test animals.
<p>
NASA downplays the possibility of the release of plutonium in 
an accident, stressing that the substance will be encapsulated 
in "clads" made of an alloy of iridium. "Clads were shown to 
survive pressure in excess of 2,000 psi [pounds per
square inch],'' NASA says in an environmental impact
statement for the Galileo and Ulysses missions issued in November 
1987. However, a Department of Energy safety analysis report for 
the missions, which I obtained in 1985 under the freedom of 
Information Act, declared that "from the viewpoint of potential 
nuclear fuel release" on either of the missions, the "most 
critical" accidents would occur on the launch pad -- and than 
could generate pressures higher than 2,000 pounds per square 
inch. Indeed, pressure up to ten times higher were estimated. 
According to the report, "Because of the large quantities of 
liquid propellants involved and the proximity of the nuclear 
payload, most launch pad accidents result in explosions of a 
magnitude that are very severe in terms of their effect on 
the nuclear payload." The report details various accident scenarios, 
including one called a "tipover" and another a "pushover," and conludes 
that in either accident, there could be pressures as
high as 19,600 pounds per square inch. (NASA now (1988) holds
that this figure is no longer valid; the November 1987 report
refers to "improved estimates of explosion parameters.")
<p>
If the space probes make it safely off the launch pad and
into outer space, there are other dangers. The Project
Galileo space probe will leave the space shuttle after it 
attains orbit to explore Jupiter. But under a new NASA plan,
the probe will not be sent directly to Jupiter. In the wake of
the Challenger disaster, astronauts insisted on the elimination 
of the highly volatile liquid-fueled Centaur rocket,
which originally was to power the space probes. A solid-fuel
rocket was substituted, but it does not have the power of the
Centaur. So NASA devised a scheme in which the probe
would first go to Venus and then be "slingshot" back
toward Earth, which it would circle twice, making use of the
Earth's gravitational field to increase the vehicle's momentum 
so it can reach Jupiter. In this second part of the sling-shot 
maneuver, the space probe would become a large bomb
pointed almost at Earth-flying as close as 277 miles overhead. 
The November 1987 NASA report conceded:
<p>
<dl><dt>
<i>During the second Earth flyby . . . there is a remote but 
finite chance that the spacecraft may re-enter the Earth's 
atmosphere. Based on preliminary analysis, the Galileo project
expects that this accident scenario will be deemed not 
credible. . . . Therefore, the project estimates the chance 
of inadvertent reentry to be less than one chance in one million.</i>
</dl>
<p>
The chance of a shuttle crash -- which turned out to be 1 in
25 -- was set by NASA, before the Challenger disaster, at
1 in 100,000. Another section of this report says that "operational 
procedures will be developed to minimize the possibility 
of inadvertent Earth reentry occurring during Earth return-flybys."
<p>
Why use plutonium on the space probes at all? It will not
be used for propulsion. It will fuel what the D.O.E. and
NASA call "radioisotope thermoelectric generators, " which
supply on-board electric power, and, in Project Galileo, less
than a pound will also be distributed to 130 "radioisotope
heater units" to keep instrumentation warm. The D.O.E.
and NASA say there are no alternatives. Professor Kaku
challenges this claim and urges the use of long-lived batteries
and solar energy. Even as far away as Jupiter, he says, "it's
possible with the latest advances in solar cells to generate
electricity" from the sun. And for Project Ulysses, whose
mission is a north-south orbit of the sun, there is certainly
plentiful solar energy.
<p>
Project Galileo was originally scheduled for launch four
months after the Challenger mission, and Project Ulysses
was to follow weeks later -- indeed, it was to be the next mission 
of the ill-fated Challenger. Last year I queried the
D.O.E. and NASA about what new safety analyses they had
made for the two projects since the Challenger disaster. The
reply from D.O.E., which provides the plutonium-fueled
electric generator and heat source (both made by Genaal
Electric) to NASA, was: "Since that time, no further
studies/reports have been completed on this subject."

<H2>STAR WARS & REACTORS IN SPACE: A CANADIAN VIEW</h2>
<h3>Written in 1986 by Michael Bein</h3>
<p>
It has been eight years since the Soviet nuclear-
powered spy satellite Cosmos 954 crashed in northern
Canada, alerting the world to the dangers of putting
nuclear reactors into space.  But despite U.S. President
Carter's subsequent call for a ban on nuclear materials
in orbit and despite a similar Canadian initiative
leading to drawn out diplomatic wranglings at the U.N.,
increasing numbers of nuclear satellites still seem
destined to be launched.  In the U.S., a new generation
of larger reactors for space is under development, the
first of which could be ready to be Shuttled into orbit
by the early 1990's.
<p>
Though NASA envisions many uses for the new
reactors -- from rocket propulsion to baseload power for
space factories -- it is the military that has kept
their development alive.  Through its Strategic Defence
Initiative Organization, set up to fund "Star Wars"
research into President Reagan's "non-nuclear defensive
shield", the Department of Defense has agreed to pay
half the $300 million projected cost of designing,
building, and ground testing the new reactor by 1991.
SDIO sees nuclear reactors as a promising source of
power for future space weapons.  Whether or not a "Star
Wars" defense ever gets built, planned SDI research will
result in more nuclear reactors in space.
<p>
The disintegration of Cosmos 954 over the Northwest
Territories on Jan. 24, 1978, thrust the issue of
nuclear powered satellites (NPS) into the political
spotlight. For the first several weeks the story assumed
dramatic proportions, as nightly newscasts pictured the
airborne and ground search and recovery operations set
against a backdrop of sub-arctic winter.  CBC camera
crews were aboard as Hercules aircraft, specially
outfitted with radiation sensors, criss-crossed the
frozen wilderness looking for "hot spots".  Parka-clad
decontamination teams trudged through the snow to locate
radioactive bits of the downed satellite and to package
and remove them in specially shielded cannisters.
Helicopters, snowmobiles, even dog-teams played their
parts in "Operation Morning Light", as the joint
Canada-U.S. clean-up effort came to be known.
<p>
Operation Morning Light continued into October and
eventually resulted, according to Canada's Atomic Energy
Control Board (AECB), in the estimated recovery of 0.1
percent of Cosmos 954's nuclear core. (<a href="#ref01">1</a>)  Tens of
millions of pepper-flake sized radioactive particles,
comprising a fifth to a quarter of the core, remained
scattered over a 124,000 square kilometer "footprint"
(<a href="#ref02">2</a>), stretching southward from Great Slave Lake into
northern Saskatchewan and Alberta. The clean-up of these
from populated and frequented areas and the recovery of
a number of large satellite fragments from the more
remote bush cost Canada nearly $14,000,000 (<a href="#ref02">2</a>), 
of which only $3,000,000 was later recovered from the USSR. 
(<a href="#ref03">3</a>)
Obviously a far more comprehensive clean-up would have
been deemed necessary had Cosmos 954 come down over a
large city or a major agricultural region like the
prairie wheat belt to the south, over which the
satellite in fact flew on its penultimate orbit.
<p>
Within a week after the Cosmos crash, U.S.
President Carter called for "an agreement with the
Soviets to prohibit earth-orbiting satellites with
atomic radiation material in them." (<a href="#ref04">4</a>)  Two weeks
later, Canadian Minister for External Affairs Don
Jamieson sent up his own a trial balloon about "some
kind of nuclear-free zone in near outer space," (<a href="#ref05">5</a>) and
Canada proposed establishment at the U.N. of a working
group of technical experts to look into the whole
question of nuclear powered satellites. 
(<a href="#ref06">6</a>, <a href="#ref07">7</a>)  Sweden
called for a moratorium on NPS launchings while the
working group was to deliberate (<a href="#ref07">7</a>).
<p>
The Soviet Union, however, staunchly refused to
recognize any need for new principles governing nuclear
power in space and, at first, tried to block discussions
at the U.N. (<a href="ref08">8</a>, <a href="ref09">9</a>)  
But by July of 1978, due to the
pressure of almost unanimous agreement among
non-East-bloc nations, the Soviets relented and agreed
to the establishment of a working group. (<a href="#ref10">10</a>)  
Without acknowledging any need for new rules or accepting
responsibility for Cosmos 954, the Soviet Union, five
months after the crash, finally admitted that the
subject of nuclear power sources in space was at least
important enough to talk about.
<p>
In November of the same year, the General Assembly
authorized its Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer
Space (UNCOPUOS) to establish a technical working group.
The assembly also passed a resolution requesting that a
country whose NPS is about to fall notify others of the
impending danger. (<a href="#ref11">11</a>)  Though this was a step 
forward (in view of the fact that the U.S., and not the USSR,
had first warned Canada about Cosmos 954), it is the
only substantive resolution on NPS the General Assembly
has yet adopted.
<p>
The newly established working group had no
difficulty agreeing in principle that "NPS can be used
safely in outer space, provided that all necessary
safety requirements are met." (<a href="#ref12">12</a>)  Unfortunately, 
to this day there has been only vague consensus among the
national delegations as to what should constitute
"necessary safety requirements", and the agreement in
principle is purely rhetorical.
<p>
Arguments have persisted at the U.N.  over whether
safety regulations regarding nuclear power in space
should be mandatory or voluntary, or whether they are
even needed at all.  And much disagreement remains about
what the proposed rules should include.  For example,
should countries planning to launch nuclear powered
satellites be obliged to give prior notification to
other nations?  Both superpowers have repeatedly
resisted proposals by Canada, Sweden, Denmark, West
Germany and others for some form of international
notification before or at time of NPS launch. 
(<a href="#ref13">13</a>, <a href="#ref36">36</a>)
President Carter's early call for a ban on nuclear
materials in space has never been repeated, and the
Americans, like the Soviets, appear to be keeping their
options open for secret military nuclear missions in
space.
<p>
The U.S. space nuclear program has always had close
ties and even owes its existence to the military.
Officially "terminated" in the mid 1970's after
expenditure of more than $1.4 billion for lack of
concrete NASA mission requirements, the program was
revived and re-funded as a result of Air Force interest
in new power sources for space-based radar. (<a href="#ref14">14</a>)
<p>
Today, the U.S. is developing, according to a
Department of Energy (DOE) press release, "a compact
nuclear power system that will provide a safe and highly
reliable source of hundreds of kilowatts of electric
power for a broad range of civilian and military space
applications, including the Strategic Defense
Initiative, in the early to mid-1990's and beyond." 
(<a href="#ref15">15</a>)
This joint project of DOE, SDIO, and NASA, which got
underway in 1983, has moved into its $300 million second
phase: construction and ground testing of the new
"SP-100" reactor by 1991 at the Hanford nuclear
reservation in Washington state. (<a href="#ref16">16</a>)  The SP-100 will
be designed to be carried aloft in the cargo bay of the
Space Shuttle and to generate 300 kilowatts of
electricity in space. (<a href="#ref17">17</a>, <a href="#ref18">18</a>)  
DOE and SDIO are splitting the cost of phase two, with NASA playing an
advisory role until the later, flight phases. (<a href="#ref19">19</a>)
According to a senior DOE official involved with the
program, "All the near term applications are military."
(<a href="#ref20">20</a>)
<p>
In comparison, the largest U.S. power supply ever
flown in space was Skylab's 12 kilowatt solar cell array
in 1973.  Soviet nuclear Radar Ocean Reconnaissance
Satellites (RORSATs) like Cosmos 954 or Cosmos 1402
(which disintegrated over the South Atlantic in 1983)
reportedly have used up to 20 kilowatts of electricity.
(<a href="#ref21">21</a>)  A typical large earthborne commercial power
reactor, on the other hand, generates several hundred
thousand kilowatts, while SDI ultimately might require
an amount of energy equal to "a substantial fraction of
the output of the eastern U.S. power grid," according to
one SDI official. (<a href="#ref22">22</a>)
<p>
Some 50 spacecraft carrying nuclear power sources
(either bona fide nuclear fission reactors, or less
powerful "radioisotope thermoelectric generators"
powered by the decay heat of plutonium) have been
launched by the superpowers.  Of these, at least eight
have come down unexpectedly over various parts of the
earth. (<a href="#ref23">23</a>, <a href="#ref30">30</a>)  
One was a U.S. navigational satellite
which in 1964 failed to achieve orbit and dispersed its
entire plutonium-238 inventory into the stratosphere
above the Indian Ocean.  This incident alone resulted in
a near tripling of the global fallout of Pu-238. (<a href="#ref24">24</a>)
<p>
Another radioisotope power pack, this one from the
lunar module of the aborted Apollo 13 moon-landing
mission, lies intact at the bottom of the 6-km deep
Tonga Trench in the South Pacific, where it fell from
the sky in 1970. (<a href="#ref25">25</a>, <a href="#ref26">26</a>, 
<a href="#ref30">30</a>)  A number of major American
space successes, including the Apollo moonshots and the
Voyager unmanned missions to the outer planets, have
relied on radiosotope power sources.  Until the recent
Challenger disaster postponed all NASA's plans, a
plutonium power pack was scheduled for May 1986 launch
via Space Shuttle as part of the Galileo probe to orbit
the planet Jupiter. (<a href="#ref26">26</a>, <a href="#ref27">27</a>)
<p>
The only U.S. satellite thus far to carry a nuclear
fission reactor failed in 1965 after 43 days aloft and
was subsequently boosted into a 4000-year orbit in order
that its radioactivity might have time to decay to safer
levels before it descends to earth. (<a href="#ref23">23</a>, 
<a href="#ref28">28</a>, <a href="#ref29">29</a>)
Injection into higher orbit is the method of reactor
"disposal" preferred by both the American and Soviet
programs. (<a href="#ref26">26</a>, <a href="#ref29">29</a>, 
<a href="#ref30">30</a>)  Both the Cosmos 954 and Cosmos
1402 accidents are blamed on failures of the rocket
systems that should have boosted these satellites into
long-lived orbits. (<a href="#ref26">26</a>)
<p>
Most of the concern expressed at the U.N. has
focussed on NPS in low orbits of less than 300 to 500
years duration, too short for fission products to decay
away sufficiently.  The U.S.'s SP-100 Program,
accordingly, has adopted the policy of not operating the
reactor unless it is in a stable orbit with at least a
300 year life span (more than 520 kilometers high). (<a href="#ref26">26</a>)
However, it isn't yet clear at what altitude the
military will want to operate its nuclear-powered Star
Wars battle stations.  And, like the Soviets, whose
nuclear RORSATs are shot into orbits only 240 kilometers
high, the Americans are studying how to engineer the
controlled breakup of satellites during re-entry from
low orbit should booster systems fail.  (<a href="#ref26">26</a>, 
<a href="#ref29">29</a>)
<p>
The official U.S. "Nuclear Safety Criteria and
Specifications for Space Nuclear Reactors" (<a href="#ref31">31</a>) allow
for "short-lived orbit missions" so long as a "reentry
core dispersal capability" is provided, apparently to
ensure that no large radioactive fragments reach the
ground intact.  This contrasts with Canada's position at
the U.N. that "in principle ...  nuclear reactors should
not be used in low earth orbit." (<a href="#ref32">32</a>)
<p>
Regarding the best form of dispersal upon re-entry,
a 1979 DOE-commissioned safety study found that
"break-up of the reactor into non-respirable particles
...  is preferable to uncontrolled intact re-entry or to
high altitude vaporization." (<a href="#ref26">26</a>, 
<a href="#ref29">29</a>)  In other words,
break-up into pepper-flake sized particles like those
produced by Cosmos 954 is the best (as well as the most
likely) form of reentry.  This finding led one U.S.
official to endorse such break-up as "an acceptable
backup option" should high-orbit disposal fail. (<a href="#ref26">26</a>)
However, certain assumptions of the 1979 study have
since been called into question, and the whole dispersal
issue today is officially under review. (<a href="#ref20">20</a>)
<p>
Although the American planners have obviously been
concerned enough about safety to draft general criteria
and institute a three-step, multi-agency review process
that must be completed before each launch (<a href="#ref31">31</a>), there
are a number of weaknesses in the U.S. regulatory system
vis a vis NPS. First of all, there is no licensing by an
independent authority like the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission, the watchdog of America's commercial nuclear
power industry.  All the nuclear missions flown to date
have been classed as research devices and have therefore
been exempted from licensing under a provision of the
Atomic Energy Act.  (<a href="#ref14">14</a>)  DOE, meanwhile, reserves 
the right to approve deviations from the published safety
criteria. (<a href="#ref31">31</a>)  And, perhaps most importantly, there 
is no provision for public participation in the safety
review process.
<p>
Unlike commercial nuclear plants, which have a
small probability of catastrophic failure, due to the
presence of carefully engineered redundant safety
systems, each orbiting nuclear reactor is virtually
certain to undergo a major loss of containment upon its
inevitable plunge to earth.  (Unless future generations
are to be saddled with the task of retrieving or
re-boosting the worn out NPSs of today.) Even after
several hundred or thousand years, certain radioactive
substances (alpha-emitters) will remain on board in
significant quantities, even though general radiation
levels will substantially subside. The toxicity of these
long-lived carcinogens is a contentious issue among
medical experts, and it is possible that prevailing
attitudes as to the safety even of high-orbit missions
will someday have to be revised.
<p>
Meanwhile, the U.S. space reactor program forges
ahead, spurred on by Star Wars dreams of electrically
driven particle beam weapons, high-velocity anti-missile
"rail guns", and radar powerful enough to track Russian
submarines beneath the sea.  Soviet RORSATs like Cosmos
954 also continue to circle above. (<a href="#ref33">33</a>)
<p>
Against this backdrop, there exists only a
piteously weak international regulatory regime,
consisting mainly of a procedure for notifying others
when one's own NPS is about to fall.  Despite recent
official recognition by Canada and other delegations
that "debris from re-entering satellites could become
the chief source of artificial radionuclides [i.e.
atomic fallout] in the atmosphere in the next century,"
(<a href="#ref34">34</a>) eight years after Cosmos 954, the world body is
still "just beginning to deal with legal principles" and
"trying to pin down general ideas," according to a
Canadian representative to UNCOPUOS.  (<a href="#ref35">35</a>)
<p>
In order to reach some kind of agreement, Canada
has even expressed official willingness to compromise on
its principle of opposition to low-orbit NPS and
"consider a specific exception for national security
reasons," on condition that "states be obliged to
announce in advance that they would be using reactors in
low-earth orbit." (<a href="#ref36">36</a>)  Washington and Moscow have
refused to agree.
<p>
Thus, the U.N. remains deadlocked.  A treaty, even
by the most optimistic accounts, is still some five
years down the road.  The major opportunity afforded by
Cosmos 954 for a historic breakthrough in the protection
of the outer space environment has all but slipped away.
Meanwhile, both superpowers are jealously guarding the
right to keep silent about number and nature of nuclear
powered satellites that may one day circle above.

<h3>World Population: 5.8 Billion and Growing</h3>
<a href="/pics/geni/genimcga/popumcga.gif"><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM HSPACE=20 SRC="/pics/geni/genimcga/popumcga.gif" ALT="Population Map"></a>
<p>
(Each dot represents 58 million people.)
<p>
Our global population continues to grow at an accelerated rate.  We now add a billion people in just one decade.
<p>
Nearly all of this population increase comes from the developing nations.
<p>
Today, 2 billion people have no electricity at all.
<p>
Research shows that once a society reaches an adequate living standard, the rate of population growth stabilizes.

<h3>Income Distribution Varies Greatly</h3>
<p>
<a href="/pics/geni/genimcga/richone.gif"><IMG ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=20 SRC="/pics/geni/genimcga/richone.gif" ALT="Current Wealth Distribution Chart."></a>
The present income distribution of the world is massively inequitable.  The top 20% receives 83% of all wealth, the bottom 60% split just 7% of the world's wealth.
<p>
The developed countries' focus must be on energy efficiency and transition to renewables.
<p>

<h3>Income Distribution Varies Greatly</h3>
<a href="/pics/geni/genimcga/richtwo.gif"><IMG ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=20 SRC="/pics/geni/genimcga/richtwo.gif" ALT="Possible Wealth Distribution Chart"></a>
<p>
In the developing nations the ability to raise their own living standards is the priority.  Today, small scale energy generation is crucial.
<p>
With access to electricity to meet basic survival needs, the developing nations can then move from requiring foreign aid to becoming part of the world economy.
<p>
<hr>
<br>
<h3>Energy Use is Rapidly Increasing</h3>
<a href="/pics/geni/genimcga/nrg1mcga.gif"><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM HSPACE=20 SRC="/pics/geni/genimcga/nrg1mcga.gif" ALT="Energy Use is Increasing"></a>
<p>
In developed countries, the demand and energy use is not increasing, due to greater efficiency.  (MBOE:  Million Barrels of Oil Equivalent.)
<p>
<hr>
<br>
<a href="/pics/geni/genimcga/nrg2mcga.gif"><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM HSPACE=20 SRC="/pics/geni/genimcga/nrg2mcga.gif" ALT="Energy Use is Increasing"></a>
In developing nations, energy demand is growing rapidly.  Unfortunately, in struggling to survive, much of this demand is met by cutting trees and burning coal.
<p>
The energy use of developing nations will soon surpass that of developed countries.  The implications to our environment are enormous.

<h3>Pollution from Non-renewable Energy Sources</h3>
<a href="/pics/geni/genimcga/polumcga.gif"><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM HSPACE=20 SRC="/pics/geni/genimcga/polumcga.gif" ALT="Pollution from Non-renewables"></a>
<p>
   Pollution from today's methods of energy production is frightening.
<p>
   For example:
<UL>
<LI>    Oil Spills
<LI>    Nuclear Accidents
<LI>    Acid Rain
</UL>
<p>
   Other consequences include deforestation and land laid bare by strip mining.
<p>
<hr>
<br>
<h3> Pollution from Non-renewable Energy Sources </h3>
<a href="/pics/geni/genimcga/co2_mcga.gif"><IMG ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=20 SRC="/pics/geni/genimcga/co2_mcga.gif" ALT="CO2 Emissions"></a>
<p>
   Current industrial CO2 emissions are more than double the "stabilization level" suggested by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).
<p>
   At the current rate of increase, by 2020 it will be four to five times the stabilization level.
<p>
<hr>
<br>
<h3> Untapped Renewable Energy Resources Abound </h3>
<a href="/pics/geni/genimcga/rnwsmcga.gif"><IMG ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=20 SRC="/pics/geni/genimcga/rnwsmcga.gif" ALT="Renewable Sites"></a>
<p>
   Numerous sites exist where renewable, clean energy is available.  Often in remote locations, renewables are also site specific.
<p>
   In addition to hydro, solar and tidal, huge potential exists for wind power, geothermal and biomass production.
<p>
<hr>
<br>
<h3> A Solution to Global Problems </h3>
<a href="/pics/geni/genimcga/ntwkmcga.gif"><IMG ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=20 SRC="/pics/geni/genimcga/ntwkmcga.gif" ALT="Network of Lines"></a>
<p>
   Buckminster Fuller proposed interconnecting renewable energy sources as the world's highest priority.
<p>
   Transmission lines can now economically carry bulk electricity for thousands of kilometers.
<p>
<a href="/pics/geni/genimcga/circmcga.gif"><IMG ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=20 SRC="/pics/geni/genimcga/circmcga.gif" ALT="Long Distances Possible"></a>
<p>
   Connections between power generation sites and demand centers can provide sufficient energy for everyone.
<p>
<a href="/pics/geni/genimcga/crc2mcga.gif"><IMG ALIGN=TOP HSPACE=20 SRC="/pics/geni/genimcga/crc2mcga.gif" ALT="Long Distances Possible"></a>
<hr>
<br>
<h3> Energy Needs Vary with Time </h3>
<a href="/pics/geni/genimcga/chgsmcga.gif"><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM HSPACE=20 SRC="/pics/geni/genimcga/chgsmcga.gif" ALT="Needs change constantly"></a>
<p>
   Energy grids allow power transfers among utility companies as needed.
<p>
   This saves resources since the output of many renewable energy sites vary on daily, lunar, and seasonal cycles.  Usage also varies on similar cycles.  For example, morning light in one time zone can power lights in an area where it is still dark.
<p>
<hr>
<br>
<h3> World Peace Through World Trade </h3>
<a href="/pics/geni/genimcga/ntwkmcga.gif"><IMG ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=20 SRC="/pics/geni/genimcga/ntwkmcga.gif" ALT="Global Energy Network"></a>
<p>
   In the book "Megatrends" John Naisbitt said the fastest way to world peace was through world trade.
<p>
   The more we become economically linked across political boundaries, the less likely we'll go to war.  It's just bad business to shoot your customer or supplier.

<title>Sandhills.Net: The Chamber: Growth and Development</title>
</head>

<body background="./graphics/goldmrbl.jpg">
<h3>Growth and Development</h3>
<hr>

<p>Moore County's thriving economy is the result of a successful balance of tourism, retirement, health care, agriculture and manufacturing. Situated halfway between New York and Florida and halfway between the Blue Ridge Mountains and the Carolina coastline, our location has significantly contributed to the strong economy and tremendous growth over the last decade.

<p>Tourism in Moore County has for the past century been one of our major strengths.  Each year the county attracts thousands of visitors from all corners of the world.  The Convention and Visitors Bureau for the Village of Pinehurst, Southern Pines, Aberdeen Area reports an economic impact of travel in Moore County for 1993 of $157.5 million. On average a North Carolina county generates $1,200 per capita in travel and tourism sales, but Moore County generates $2,833 per capita - nearly two-and-a-half times the state average.

<p>The area travel industry employs over 4,500 people in the county and represents a collective payroll of $42.8 million.  Each year the growth rates of visitors to our county have increased by 20%.  And our future looks even brighter.

<p>Major golf events in our area have brought people to us in vast numbers. In 1994, Pinehurst  Resort and Country Club was the host of the US Senior Open, in 1995 the LPGA Women's Championship was played at Pinewild Country Club.  This year, Southern Pines' Pine Needles Resort is home to the US Women's Open golf tournament.  And to cap off the decade, in 1999 the US Open will be held here at Pinehurst. Golf has been a catalyst for tourism in Moore County, but there is plenty else that brings `em here.  We have other attractions and events throughout the county each year that bring thousands of visitors to our doors.  

<p>Our villages and towns with their unparalleled hospitality and warmth combine historical charm with unique shopping experiences.  Regionally the area has become recognized as a major shopping area. Two of the nation's mass retailers have built new stores within the last three years.  New specialty shops have been opening their doors to visitors and locals alike. Dining in our county is a myriad of multicultural tastes.  An exciting variety of restaurants exists in the area now and is ever increasing.  This not only translates into revenue for our residents, but contributes to our extremely high quality of life.

<p>As a result of our pleasant community, temperate climate, and convenient location, Moore County has become an attractive place for retirement.Retiree relocation has spurred the growth of adult community housing developments. Independent living communities are available for those who no longer wish to maintain a home and property.  The county's retirees are the backbone of the area's volunteer efforts.  Their commitment to the continued improvement in the quality of life is evident from their involvement in everything from serving patient needs at Moore Regional Hospital to tutoring children in the Moore County Schools.

<p>Moore County is proud to be the home of Moore Regional Hospital, a regional referral center that has experienced phenomenal growth in the last decade. Under the hospital's leadership, health care has become a major sector of the county's economy.  The hospital is one of the county's largest employers.  Growth in the services it offers has attracted new physicians and added the availability of new medical specialties to the region.  Home health services, Hospice services and skilled nursing care facilities also strengthen the health care sector of Moore County's economy.

<p>Agriculture serves as important part of Moore County's economic mix.  Our farmers compete globally with their products, and contribute over $135 million annually to the local economy.  Tobacco and poultry represent two of the largest segments of the local agricultural market.  Produce abounds as well in the Sandhills.  Peach orchards, strawberry farms, pumpkin patches and a Farmer's Market offer a variety of fresh produce throughout the year.

<p>A variety of light manufacturing industries make their home in Moore County.  Textiles are the mainstay of the county's manufacturing base. Machine tool fabrication and furniture manufacturing represent most of the remaining manufacturing mix. Four of the area's largest employers are manufacturers. Manufacturing employs roughly 25% of the area's labor force.

<p>Moore County's economy is thriving. The tourism industry is not only successful, but is a catalyst for growth in other industries. Our economic base is diverse and job opportunities abound. Moore County continues to benefit from a strong economy that translates into a high quality of life for our residents.

<font size=+3>W</font>hat exactly is it that has made <b>North
Carolina's Village of Pinehurst, Southern Pines, Aberdeen Area</b>
synonymous with the game of golf? Is it the sheer number of
superb championship courses, some of which are among the most
highly rated in the world?<p>

<blockquote><font size=+3>I</font>s it the fact that Pinehurst and
Southern Pines have been the home to a host of major golf
tournaments? Or is it that of major U.S. golf destinations, the
Village of Pinehurst, Southern Pines, Aberdeen Area received top
honors in golf course quality according to Golf Digest's Places
to Play Guide?</blockquote><p>

<font size=+3>F</font>or many, it's all of these things and more
that account for the area's standing in the world of golf.
Perhaps it can best be summarized in one word: tradition.<p>

<blockquote><font size=+3>N</font>estled in the Sandhills of North 
Carolina, this area has come to epitomize golf's grandest era. 
This was an era when legends were born and grew -- with names like 
Nelson, Zaharias, Hogan, Jones, Snead and Palmer and a time that 
gave the game some of its finest designers as well: Donald Ross, 
Ellis Maples, Robert Trent Jones and many more.</blockquote><p>

<font size=+3>T</font>oday, courses by
earlier legends are joined by those of a new generation of
designers: Jack Nicklaus, Arnold Palmer, Tom and George Fazio,
Dan Maples and Rees Jones just to name a few. All this awaits
your return to Golf's Grandest Era.<p>

<h3>Child Care and After School Care</h3>
<hr>

<p>As increasing numbers of families with small children move into Moore County, the need for quality child care has grown.  We offer several different options for parents. Licensed, free-standing centers accept infants from six weeks of age until pre-school. They offer educational programs as part of their curriculum. Legal child care homes are another option for parents. Several pre-schools operate excellent programs as well.

<p>As after school care for children is a necessity for working parents, Moore County has created after school programs that are available at nearly all of the county's public and private elementary schools.

<p>The Moore County Parks and Recreation Department operates a licensed day-care camp, with locations in Carthage and Pinehurst, during the summer.

<p>A list of all the licensed child care programs in Moore County is available through Child Care Connections, a private, non-profit child care resource and referral agency, located in Southern Pines. This private, non-profit organization coordinates child care services in the community with parental needs, and promotes public awareness of quality child care. The agency works closely with parents to help them find the right child care situation.

<h3>Welcome!</h3>

<p>Welcome to Moore County! The high quality of life here makes us stand out as one of North Carolina's premier communities. We combine the warmth of a small town atmosphere with big city amenities few areas can claim.  

<p>Known as the Sandhills for our sandy soil and gentle rolling hills, we are blessed with a moderate climate that avails itself to year' round outdoor fun... and oh the fun we have!  We have wonderfully thrilling events such as steeplechases, tennis tournaments, polo, bicycle races and who could forget, golf!

<p>Where in the world can you imagine the top professional golfers on the planet coming to your backdoor, playing on your courses!?!?  It is here that they come!  For over a hundred years Pinehurst has been synonymous with golf. With 38 expertly designed and groomed courses in Moore County, we are unquestionably  "The Golf Capital of the World." Just think of the envy of those pros knowing that you can play these courses whenever you want....hey, you can even live on one!

<p>There is even more that our county offers you.  We have arts, history, botanical gardens, community festivals, unique shopping...There is something for everyone.  You came because you heard about our high quality of life. You'll stay because your quality of life in Moore County will be better than you heard.

<h3>Recreation</h3>

<ul>
<li>Golf
<p>For over eighty-five years the Sandhils have been the home of world famous golf! With 38 courses and more under construction our county is known as the "Golf Capital of the World!"  Nestled between quaint villages and towns, our spectacular courses are expertly designed and groomed to excite all levels of golfers. Tradition hangs over these courses like a silent cloud. It is difficult not to be awestruck by their history.  You can literally walk in the footsteps of legends....Palmer, Nicolas, Hogan, Snead...and many many more.

<p>Our courses are truly championship. We have had the honor to host such tournaments as the 1991 and 1992 PGA Tour Championships and the 1994 Senior Open at the Pinehurst Resort and Country Club. In 1995 Pinewild was the proud home of the LPGA  Championship. This year we are proud to welcome the 1996 US Women's Open to our Pine Needles resort in Southern Pines. This is an especially exciting event in that we will help raise funds for breast cancer research.  And to cap off the decade we will again be honored as we host the 1999 US Open at Pinehurst.

<p>Remember these courses are now yours!  Come tee off often.
<br><br>

<li>Equestrian 
<p>Moore County has the distinct honor of being known as "horse country." Horseback riding through the tranquility of our majestic countrysides is a renewing pleasure.  A day  of harness racing or polo at the Pinehurst Track is a fun-filled family event. The famous Stoneybrook Steeplechase is a major event popular for over 45 years. Each April thousands gather from up and down the eastern seaboard to celebrate in the form of a grand finale the end of the hunting season and the beginning of spring.

<p>Whether you like to ride on a peaceful trail through the woods, compete in world-class events, or share the day with friends and family at the track...you'll have plenty of opportunities to enjoy the world of equestrian sports in Moore County.
<br><br> 

<li>Bicycling
<p>International cycling teams have long regarded Moore County as a top training ground. There are a variety of mapped courses through our villages and towns. Annually the exciting Tour de Moore challenges bikers on a 100-mile road race around the perimeter of the county culminating with a grand finish in Southern Pines.

<p>If competitive riding is not your cup of tea, a day of leisurely cycling throughout our lovely towns and villages is always a pleasure.
<br><br>

<li>Tennis
<p>Tennis in the Sandhills is always smashing! There are many public courts available for residents to enjoy as well as private exclusive clubs.  Lessons are available as well, so bring your racquet!
<br><br>

<li>And more...
<p>We literally have something for everyone.  There is so much that the entire story can not be told in one spot. A great source of information for activities is one of our area's parks and recreation departments. There are three in our county:  the Moore County Parks and Recreation Department, the Southern Pines Department of Recreation and the Aberdeen Parks and Recreation Department.  

<p>These organizations sponsor events for children, adults and seniors. There are team activities, such as baseball, basketball and softball, holiday events such as Easter egg hunts, the Jingle Bell Festival, and Lake Eerie at Halloween.  Lessons, excursions, and much more is open to the residents of Moore.
<br><br>

<li>Fitness Center
<p>The Moore Regional Health and Fitness Center, a part of Moore Regional Hospital, offers membership opportunities to all county residents. Opened in February 1995, the beautiful complex houses an assortment of recreational facilities.  These include racquetball courts, basketball and volleyball courts, swimming pool, whirlpool, sauna, and excercise rooms. A full schedule of fitness classes, covering strength training, aerobics, Dietcise, a weight loss and excercise program, and a comprehensive aquatics program.
<br><br>

<li>Gardens
<p>Botanical Gardens are a special treat. The Sandhills Horticultural Gardens, located on the campus of Sandhills Community College, covers over 23 acres and is open to the public every day of the year from dawn to sunset.

<p>The gardens are composed of a variety of plants and differences in landscape design. Visitors can stroll through the impressive Rose Garden, Conifer Garden, formal English Garden, and the largest accessible Holly garden on the East Coast.  There is much more, so be sure to go often.
<br><br>

<li>Parks, outdoor activities
<p>If you enjoy picnicking, boating and fishing, you will find Moore County has several places for you to enjoy the outdoors. Parks abound in the area. Cannon Memorial Park, in Pinehurst, and Downtown Park, in Southern Pines, are a children's paradise with their imaginative playgrounds. Reservoir Park, located at the site of the old Southern Pines reservoir, has a picnicking shelter and tables beside a beautiful lake where canoeing and fishing are permitted.The Whitehall Trails System in Southern Pines has fitness trails to enjoy and nature walks are available throught the <a href="http://ils.unc.edu/parkproject/wewo.html">Weymouth Center</a>.

<h3>History</h3>
<hr>
<p>Pinehurst, the historic center of modern day Moore County, celebrated its Centennial during 1995. Founder James Walker Tufts established Pinehurst, a complete resort village with an elegant inn and turn of the century luxuries during the late 1800's. At that time, the region was known as an area where one could receive treatment for certain health ailments.

<p>People began to seek refuge from the northern blizzards by flocking to the resort towns that provided the prescribed fresh air and mineral water. Meanwhile the small towns that dotted the county became incorporated and self functioning. Donald Ross, legendary golf course designer responsible for the famous No. 2 Course, and many other favorites in the area, introduced golf to the area--and the Sandhills area has made history ever since.

<p>Moore County, however has roots that trace back as early as the beginning of the sixth century. Archaeological findings indicate that Indians of the Siouan family inhabited this area until about 400 years ago. A well-used Indian trail which crosses the county is thought to have been beaten out by buffaloes on their annual migrations from the Piedmont to the coastal marshes. This trail, which later came to be known as the Yadkin Road, played an important role in early settlement of Moore County.

<p>The earliest European settlers came to the region about 1739. During the ensuing years, additional settlers, largely English, Ulster Scots, and Germans moved into the area, traveling down the "Great Wagon Road" from Pennsylvania or up the Cape Fear River Valley from Wilmington. Most settled on the Deep River in northern Moore County. By the mid-1750's, the area was sparsely, but evenly, settled.

<p>The next twenty years saw a large influx of settlers, particularly Highland Scots. These Highlanders settled in southeast Sandhills, an area bypassed by earlier settlers due to the poorness of the soil. The industrious Scots made the best of what they had and soon established the manufacture of naval stores as a major industry of the vast forest of longleaf pines. Moore County, named after Alfred Moore of Brunswick, officially became a county in 1783.

<p>As the region's growth began to accelerate, the effects of the Civil War proved particularly hard on Sandhills citizens. But in the 1870's with the arrival of the Raleigh and Augusta Railroad, little towns began to evolve, resort business flourished, and the region quickly became a commercial center.

<p>Today, Moore County natives and newcomers alike benefit from a lifestyle rich in history and tradition. Welcome to the Sandhills and enjoy!

<h3>Neighborhoods and Housing</h3>
<hr>
<p>Life in Moore County is like living in a big small town. While we offer many of the services and amenities of much larger areas, you still experience the joys of a close-knit community in our towns and developments.

<p>The county's towns each have their own special history and personality. Robbins, located in northern Moore County, was originally named Hemp, and has long been a thriving textile center. Carthage, the county seat, was once home to the Tyson and Jones Buggy Company. Pinehurst and Southern Pines initially developed as resort communities which attracted individuals looking for a place to relax and restore their health. Aberdeen was settled by Scottish Presbyterians. Within each of these communities, you will find a variety of housing from classic older homes in the heart of town to modern, suburban style subdivisions.

<p>Moore County's growth has prompted the development of newer communities offering the convenience of 24-hour security and resort-like recreational activities.  There are several country club developments as well in our area. If you are interested in communities designed to accommodate the needs of persons 50 years of age and older, you will find several neighborhood options.

<p>Moore County enjoys the diversity of being a small cosmopolitan area with the beauty and tranquility of a rural community. The southern end of the county between Southern Pines and Vass is divided into lovely mini-farms and horse country. Throughout Moore County working farms and homes on large tracts of land create beautiful, scenic surroundings. One of the area's realtors can help you find exactly what you are looking for. Our tremendous variety in neighborhoods offers something to suit everyone's needs and interests!

<h2>Search Hints</h2>
<hr><p>

<font size=+1>Use the form below to search through the pages of the <b>Sandhills Electronic Village</b>. For searches covering the entire World Wide Web, explore the sources on our <a href="lib-link.html">Library Links</a> page.</font><p>

<h3>Enter Text</h3>

<blockquote>This search tool can be tailored to fit your specifications.  For a simple search involving only one term--such as <i>golf</i>--just type the word into the box labeled "Text to Search For" and click the [Search!] button.  This will produce a list of all the pages on our site which contain the word <i>golf</i>.  Each title in the list is a hot-link to the page itself, which you can reach by clicking on the title.</blockquote><p>

<h3>Boolean  (AND / OR)</h3>

<blockquote>You can also enter two or more words to search for, and specify how the words are related by using the Boolean terms (sometimes called "logical operators") AND and OR.  If you want to see a list of just those pages on which <b>both</b> <i>golf</i> <b>and</b> <i>retirement</i> appear, enter both words in the "Text to Search For" box and select AND.  On the other hand, if you want a list of all the pages on which <b>either</b> <i>golf</i> <b>or</b> <i>retirement</i> appears, select OR.</blockquote><p>

<h3>Case (Insensitive / Sensitive)</h3>

<blockquote>Does it matter whether the terms in question use capital or 
lower-case letters? If the Case box reads "Insensitive" and you search for 
<i>Golf</i>, the list will include pages which contain <i>golf</i> as well as those 
which contain <i>Golf</i>, <i>GOLF</i> . . . or even <i>gOLf</i>.  On the other hand, 
if you select "Sensitive" and search for <i>Golf</i>, the search will produce only 
those pages containing that word with the first letter capitalized and all the rest lower-case.</blockquote>
<p>

<font size=+1>Click the [Search!] button to perform the search, or the [Reset] button to 
change your search options.</font><p>

</head>

<body background="./graphics/goldmrbl.jpg">
<h3>Assisted Living and Senior Services</h3>

<p>Moore County, an area with a significant senior population, takes pride in the ammenities available to meet their needs.  We work to ensure that they lead active and fulfilling lives for all of their years. We have several types of facilities and organizations to address every level of assistance that may be necessary.

<p>The Moore County Department of of Aging is committed to maintaining the independence and dignity of older adults in their own home and through various community-based services. The Department works with Moore County Transportation Services and volunteers to transport older adults to medical appointments, to shopping and errands, and to employment. Home Care Services can be secured through the Department. Interested seniors can participate in daily activities planned at each of  four Nutrition Sites throughout Moore County. The program provides recreational and educational offerings, fellowship, a hot lunch meal, exercise and arts and crafts.

<p>Together with Meals-on-Wheels, which services the Southern Pines- Aberdeen-Pine Bluff area, the Department delivers a hot lunch meal to homebound senior citizens throughout the county. The Department offers free consultation for individuals interested in assistance in evaluating and acquiring supplemental Medicare insurance. It sponsors the Senior Games In The Pines, the Annual Senior Citizens Handicraft and Hobby Fair, and has compiled an Elder Care Directory of Information for Senior Citizens in Moore County.

<p>Five intermediate care facilities provide personal and residential care, along with regular medical, rehabilitative and social services, as necessary. Moore County has four nursing homes that serve 24-hour health care needs that do not require the intensive care of a hospital.

<p>Whatever the level of assistance needed for our seniors, we have a wide variety of choices from which to choose. Here in Moore County our seniors are considered a special part of our society. We treat them with the respect and dignity they deserve and strive to make sure each of their years is golden.

<hr>  
<p><font size=+3>T</font>he county has nineteen public schools: eleven
elementary schools, four   
middle schools and three high schools. The schools are currently  
implementing a program of reduced class size in kindergarten through third  
grade. Plans have recently been approved for the building of two new middle   
schools. These facilities will serve the Vass/Cameron and WestEnd/Pinehurst   
areas of the county.  
  
<p><font size=+3>T</font>he public schools benefit from the strength of the school/business   
partnerships they form with local companies.  These companies donate   
equipment to the schools such as microscopes for science classes and file   
cabinets for office needs, as well as other amenities, such as benches and   
shrubbery to spruce up the school grounds. Company employees volunteer their   
time to help children during the school day.  
  
<p><font size=+3>M</font>oore County Schools Tech Prep program is a partnership formed between the schools and <a href="http://www.sandhills.cc.nc.us/Sandhills/"> Sandhills Community College</a>. Designed to help vocational students, the program encourage
s continuation in a two year degree program after the prescribed high school courses. The program benefits students who are not interested in a four-year college degree, but who want to strengthen their job skills before entering the labor force. <p>

<h2>Home Health & Hospice</h2>
<p>Did you know thousands of Sandhills residents each year receive regular 
visits from licensed Home Health professionals and assistants?

<p>Home Health Agencies and Home Care organizations deliver a wide variety 
of medical, therapeutic, counseling, and assisted living services to area 
residents each day in the privacy and comfort of the patients home.  
From detailed procedures prescribed by physicians to assisting with 
household chores, certified Home Health professionals and support staff 
offer patients a cost-effective alternative to long-term institutional 
care.

<p>Hospice Programs throughout the Sandhills Area also strive to work within 
the home but with a mission of providing care and counseling for 
terminally patients and their families.  With comprehensive and 
compassionate care, Hospice relieves the pain, fear and loneliness of 
patients and their loved ones, thereby enabling them to prepare 
emotionally and spiritually for the end of life.  Patients and their 
families are assisted with this preparation through personalized service 
and a caring support system of professional staff and volunteers.

<h3>What is SandLink?</h3>

SandLink is a committee of the Sandhills Area Chamber of Commerce, located in Southern Pines, North Carolina. Its members currently include representatives of several not-for-profit community  organizations: the Southern Pines Public Library,  County of Moore,  First Health of the Carolinas (Moore Regional Hospital), St. Joseph  of the Pines, Sandhills Community College, Moore County Public Schools,  and the Sandhills Area Convention and Visitors Bureau.
<hr>
<h3>Mission Statement</h3>

SandLink was established to develop a structure to electronically link Moore County's private sectors and public sectors for the purpose of providing a central access network which will promote the internal and external benefits and opportunities of the Sandhills.
<hr>
<h3>History</h3>

In December of 1994, the Sandhills Area Chamber of Commerce convened a Telecommunications and Information Systems Task Force to explore the area's present and future needs in terms of electronic information systems. Membership included a broad representation of local organizations, agencies, and businesses, as well as private citizens of the area.
<p>

At that time, public access to the Internet was available only through long-distance telephone connections to a commercial online service. By the summer of 1995, two Internet service providers had established points-of-presence in Moore County, and SandLink--a subset of the Telecommunications Task Force--was formed to oversee the development of a community-based information infrastructure.
<p>

Development of a site on the World Wide Web continued through the fall and winter of 1995. The site was conceived as an electronic village--a service for area residents, with links to local points of information, commerce, and leisure, as well as to the vast resources of the larger Internet. It would serve also as a source of information for those outside the community interested in learning more about the educational, commercial, governmental and recreational features of the Sandhills.
<hr>
<h3>Today and Tomorrow</h3>

Sandhills.Net came on-line in June of 1996.  Member agencies of SandLink helped to develop the site's primary subdivisions-- Education, Visitor Information, Government, Health, Libraries, and The Chamber. The site will continue to evolve in response to further collaboration among all sectors of the community.

<h2>Long-Term Care (Nursing Homes)</h2>

<p>Did you know that skilled nursing care is available within a short drive
of every community in the Sandhills?

<p>When the responsibilities of caring for ill and/or elderly relatives grow
beyond the capabilities of family, friends and home health care, thats
when long-term care facilities and nursing homes present a practical
alternative.  The Sandhills currently offers residents a good selection of
long-term care facilities that relieve immediate family from the
exhaustive task of caring for loved ones by providing compassionate and
comprehensive medical care.

<h2>Life Care & Retirement Communities</h2>

<p>Did you know the Sandhills offer retirement possibilities from pure
leisure to accommodations for people with special medical needs?

<p>Some retirees may find themselves in the unfortunate situation of not
being able to care for themselves or their household needs.  Fortunately
for these people, the Sandhills offer retirement living opportunities
ranging from collective retirement communities to life care retirement
communities that provide varying levels of medical supervision and
health care in addition to assistance with everyday chores.

<!-- start body stuff here -->
<center><h2>Alternative Health Care</h2></center>

<p>Did you know Alternative Health Care encompasses numerous non-medical 
disciplines from nutritional cooking to yoga?

<p>Alternative Health Care includes all disciplines intended to supplement, 
enhance or take the place of traditional health and medical services 
offered by the established medical community.  In many instances, 
alternative health care provides non-traditional instruction and guidance 
for living healthier, happier lives, often through programs designed to 
increase self-awareness, reduce stress, and offer unconventional outlets 
for stress and creative energies.

<h4>WHITEHALL HEALTH EDUCATION CENTER</h4>
<p>The mission of Whitehall Health Education Center -- a nonprofit educational 
institution in Southern Pines -- is to meet the needs of the community with 
preventive health education through programs and activities involving body, 
mind, emotions and spirit in a homelike and peaceful environment using both 
volunteers and professionals.  Whitehall Center offers health related 
seminars, workshops, classes, lectures, and access to a free library of 
preventive health education information.

<p>Classes provided at Whitehall Center have included exercise and yoga, 
stress management, art, nutritional cooking, and massage therapy.  In 
addition to meeting rooms, Whitehall Center boasts a two-mile walking trail 
that winds through the Centers 150-acres.  Future plans call for an 
outdoor amphitheater, soccer classes, and programs for youth enhancement 
and stress management.

<h5>Alternative Health Care Providers:</h5>

<strong>October 11, 1996</strong><br>
<font size="5"><strong>AFL-CIO News, chronicler of labor events,
retires</strong></font><strong><br>
</strong>by<br>
Michael Byrne </p>
<blockquote>
    <p align="left"><br>
    With this issue, the AFL-CIO News closes a chapter in labor
    communications that has marked time for organized workers
    since the 1955 merger of the American Federation of Labor and
    the Congress of Industrial Organizations. </p>
    <p align="left">The News is being retired in favor of a new
    official publication, America@work, a monthly magazine aimed
    at providing union leaders and activists with information
    they can use to build a stronger labor movement. </p>
    <p align="left">America@work, debuting this month, will focus
    on the new vision for the labor movement, the strategies and
    tactics that are helping unions grow and the activists who
    are leading the charge. The new magazine also will offer
    readers a chance to talk back. </p>
    <p align="left">The AFL-CIO News has had its day, and it was
    effective in telling the story of unions working together for
    change. </p>
    <p align="left">The News was created out of the CIO News and
    the AFL News Reporter back in late 1955. The debut issue
    featured a triumphant George Meany of the AFL and Walter
    Reuther of the CIO at the merger convention, where Meany was
    elected president. </p>
    <p align="left">That first convention passed a resolution
    inaugurating a public relations program that would &quot;use
    all available media, including radio and television.&quot; It
    also urged unions to &quot;support the labor press, and
    particularly the new AFL-CIO News.&quot; </p>
    <p align="left">To edit the new weekly newspaper, AFL-CIO
    President George Meany brought in a young Newspaper Guild
    activist, Saul Miller, who for 25 years directed not only the
    AFL-CIO News, but also the Federationist, a monthly magazine
    that ceased publication in the early 1980s. </p>
    <p align="left">Miller told his staff that the AFL-CIO News
    was, in essence, the hyphen between the AFL and the CIO. It
    would cover all union activity impartially and objectively,
    and it should do nothing to indicate that it favored any one
    union over another. </p>
    <p align="left">That first year featured the move into a new
    headquarters building, dedicated by President Dwight D.
    Eisenhower, who declared that &quot;labor is the United
    States.&quot; Later that year, after much public
    soul-searching through the pages of the AFL-CIO News, the
    federation endorsed Adlai Stevenson, the Democratic candidate
    who sought to unseat Eisenhower. </p>
    <p align="left">Throughout its existence, the AFL-CIO News
    commanded a degree of respect and credibility among opinion
    leaders and members of the press. It was the only publication
    that exclusively covered the labor movement, and its currency
    was information, not rhetoric. </p>
    <p align="left">&quot;The journalistic standards of the
    AFL-CIO News never changed during my time there,&quot; said
    John Barry, managing editor from 1968 to 1988. &quot;We were
    pro-labor, of course, but we maintained a semblance of
    objectivity. We were careful not to provide unattributed
    editorial comments.&quot; </p>
    <p align="left">Rex Hardesty, who had edited the
    Federationist until it was retired in 1982, helped to change
    the face of the News when he became director of the
    department in 1986. He eliminated the editorial page, arguing
    that editorials were redundant in a publication that should
    reflect the position of the AFL-CIO in every story. And, in
    an economic move necessitated by higher postal rates, he
    instituted the current biweekly format and four-color
    production. </p>
    <p align="left">The brighter, more accessible News was a
    major departure from the traditional &quot;gray lady&quot;
    that chronicled the labor movement for decades. </p>
    <p align="left">&quot;I wanted to redesign the paper when I
    arrived back in 1961,&quot; Barry recalled. &quot;But Saul
    told me that Mr. Meany wouldn't hear of changing it. Twenty
    years later, after Meany died, I was told to redesign it. But
    I only made some slight changes, like going from five to four
    columns and adding some boxes.&quot; </p>
    <p align="left">The labor press always has been crucial to
    the success of the AFL-CIO News. Since the News circulated
    primarily to leadership, currently to about 53,000, the
    federation has depended on union newspapers to pass along to
    union members the information and message of the unified
    labor movement. In recent years, that has been facilitated
    electronically through LaborNET and the federation's home
    page on the Internet. </p>
    <p align="left">The AFL-CIO News mandate to promote
    solidarity became even more important after Meany died, when
    President Lane Kirkland inherited a labor movement under
    siege from a new Republican president, who stacked the
    National Labor Relations Board in favor of business and fired
    striking Air Traffic Controllers. The News played a key role
    in promoting two Solidarity Day marches on Washington, in
    1981 and 1991. </p>
    <p align="left">During this time, a philosophy parallel to
    solidarity was developed for the News. It became increasingly
    clear that the News also would have to seek out stories that
    provided illustrations and lessons in how the labor movement
    could grow. </p>
    <p align="left">That imperative was clarified by the 1985
    landmark report by the AFL-CIO Committee on the Evolution of
    Work, chaired by Secretary-Treasurer Tom Donahue. &quot;The
    Changing Situation of Workers and Their Unions&quot;
    emphasized the need for innovative organizing techniques, new
    benefits for union members and new communications efforts,
    especially through the electronic media. </p>
    <p align="left">The AFL-CIO News also chronicled one of the
    most revolutionary changes in the federation, the first
    contested election in AFL-CIO history, in which President
    John J. Sweeney defeated Donahue at the 1995 convention. </p>
    <p align="left">A study of AFL-CIO communications
    commissioned by Donahue and presented after the convention
    recommended that the federation develop new communications
    vehicles and to reassess the utility of the AFL-CIO News.
    With the debut of the weekly Work in Progress in January and
    the monthly America@work, the AFL-CIO News now can pass the
    torch. <br>

    <li><a href="suaction.html"><b>What YOU can do to help</b></a> </li>
</ul>
<p>The new leaders in Congress are moving so fast and on so many
fronts at once that it is almost impossible to keep up with what
they are doing, and even harder still to understand what it all
means. </p>
<p>But, make no mistake about it: their right-wing agenda is an
assault on working families. Our concerns are not their concerns.
They are not doing anything to bring greater security to American
workers. </p>
<p>Instead their program will destroy our jobs, drive down our
wages, take away our health and safety protections, and deny us a
real voice on the job. Here are just a few examples of what they
are trying to do: </p>
<ul>
    <li>Cut billions of dollars from employment, job training and
        educational programs, and billions more from investments
        in technology, highways and transportation to help pay
        for a tax cut for big businesses and the very rich. </li>
    <li>Allow corporations to compete for federal contracts by
        driving down the wages and benefits of their employees. </li>
    <li>Gut the Occupational Safety and Health Act by making it
        harder for the Labor Department to enforce health and
        safety standards, to inspect workplaces, to fine an
        employer who violates the law or to provide new
        occupational safety and health protections. </li>
    <li>Cut programs that help middle-class families make ends
        meet, including school lunches, medical benefits for
        veterans and housing for seniors. </li>
    <li>Threaten the retirement income security of working
        Americans by allowing Social Security to be raided to
        balance the federal budget. </li>
    <li>Allow employers to create company-controlled unions to
        substitute for independent, democratic unions chosen by
        the employees. </li>
</ul>
<p>These proposals must be stopped now, before it is too late.
That's why the men and women of the AFL-CIO are leading a
campaign to Stand UP for America's Working Families. </p>
<p>It's a campaign to</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="sujobs.html">America Needs Good Jobs</a> </li>
    <li><a href="suwages.html">America Needs Good Wages</a> </li>
    <li><a href="suprotec.html">America Needs Worker Protections</a> </li>
    <li><a href="suvoice.html">America Needs a Real Voice on the
        Job</a> </li>
</ul>
<h3>Their REAL Agenda</h3>
<p>The new leaders in Congress use high-priced manipulators of
public opinion to disguise their real agenda. Their slick
packaging makes their platform sound as American as apple pie.
But beneath the rhetoric is a menacing reality. </p>
<p>They say they are conservatives. But the truth is they're not
out to conserve anything; their mission is to destroy programs
that Democrats and Republicans alike have developed together over
many years. </p>
<p>They say they are for a balanced budget. Yet they propose a
tax cut which will cost $725 billion over the next ten years and
will benefit big businesses and the rich who already earn more
than $200,000 a year. </p>
<p>They say they want to return power from Washington to state
and local governments. Yet they propose to saddle new
responsibilities on our states and cities without giving them the
funds needed to discharge those responsibilities. </p>
<p>They say they are for economic opportunity. Yet they propose
to slash programs to provide nutrition for infants and pregnant
women; school lunches for poor kids; summer jobs for teenagers;
and job training programs for laid-off workers. </p>
<p>They say they want good jobs and good wages. Yet they propose
to eliminate the programs that produce and prepare workers for
those jobs and they propose to use federal contracts to drive
down wages, and to make it easier for companies to send jobs
overseas. </p>
<p>They say they care about working people. Yet they propose to
relieve corporations of their responsibility to provide safe and
healthy workplaces. And they propose to weaken the labor laws so
that there will be no one left to speak for workers. </p>
<p>Their ideology is clear. Let big business do what it wants,
and don't worry about the consequences for workers, for consumers
or for the environment. Leave the rich alone to enjoy their
riches and don&thorn;t worry about working families living
paycheck to paycheck and falling further behind or about the
neediest among us &thorn; children, the aged or the infirm. </p>
<p>They are, as their leader Newt Gingrich says,
&quot;revolutionaries.&quot; But what they are revolting against
are the laws and protections that made America the strongest
democracy in the world and allowed working Americans to share in
the riches of our society. That is their revolution. It is up to
us to stop it.</p>

<h2 align=center>AFL-CIO Welcome Message</h2>
<p>The AFL-CIO is a federation of <a href="affiliat.htm">78 labor unions</a> representing some 13.6 million working men and 
women who have joined together to help workers improve their lives on the job and in their 
communities. </p>
<p>Through organizing, collective bargaining and legislative/political action, the unions of the AFL-CIO 
work to advance and defend the rights of working people everywhere. </p>
<p>In this century, the labor movement has been the author of America's quality of life by organizing 
workers, building their ladder into the middle class, and creating a market based on good wages 
and conditions that is the envy of the world. </p>
<p>As a new century dawns, and working people find themselves under harsh attack from the agents 
of the privileged, the unions of the AFL-CIO are determined to continue our struggle for economic 
and social justice -- at home and abroad -- and for the dignity of every working family. </p>
<p align=center><font size=4><b>We will win because we will not quit!</b></font> </p>

<strong>President</strong></h3>
<p>John J. Sweeney was elected president of the AFL-CIO at the
federation's biennial convention in New York, October 1995.<br>
<br>
At the time of his election, Sweeney was serving his fourth
four-year term as president of the Service Employees
International Union, which grew from 625,000 to 1.1 million
members under his leadership. He also was vice president of the
AFL-CIO and chair of the Executive Council committees on Health
Care and Organizing and Field Services.</p>
<p>Sweeney's first job in the labor movement was with the
International Ladies' Garment Workers, which earlier this year
merged with the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union to
form UNITE. He began his SEIU career in 1960 when he first joined
Local 32B in New York City. Sweeney was elected president of
Local 32B in 1976, and led two citywide strikes of apartment
maintenance workers, during the 1970's. He was elected SEIU
president in 1980.<br>
<br>

        <p align="left">Richard L. Trumka was elected Oct. 25,
        1995 as the youngest secretary-treasurer in AFL-CIO
        history. At the time of his election, he was serving his
        third term as president of the Mine Workers. Born in
        Nemacolin, Pa., on July 24, 1949, Trumka was elected to
        the AFL-CIO Executive Council in 1989 as the UMWA
        reaffiliated with the federation. </p>
        <p align="left">At the UMWA, Trumka led two major strikes
        against the Pittston Coal Co. and the Bituminous Coal
        Operators Association that resulted in significant
        advances in employer-employee cooperation and the
        enhancement of mine workers job security, pensions and
        benefits. In 1994, President Clinton named him to the
        Bipartisan Commission on Entitlement and Tax Reform,
        where he represented the interests of working families. </p>

<p align=left>Linda Chavez-Thompson, elected to the new position of 
executive vice president of the AFL-CIO on Oct. 25, 1995, 
was the first person of color elected to an executive office of the 
AFL-CIO and is the highest-ranking woman in the labor

that traditionally has been unfriendly to labor. But she achieved 
numerous successes there, including an organizing drive in 
Texas that brought in 5,000 new members over the past five 
years, and the passage of a collective bargaining law for public 
employees in New Mexico. </p>

<p>AFL-CIO WORK IN PROGRESS -- February 10, 1997</p>
<p>ORGANIZING FOR GOOD HEALTH -- The Maryland Federation of Nurses and Health 
Professionals have jumped into the drive to organize Maryland's state workers. The AFT affiliate 
will campaign for the right to represent 2,120 state health care workers. Md. FNHP made it over 
the first hurdle when the State Mediation Service certified authorization cards. An election date is to 
be set this month. In addition to AFT, AFSCME and the Teamsters have organizing drives under 
way for other sectors of the state work force. </p>
<p>CWA WIRES UP WINS -- The Communication Workers in Houston and Austin, Texas, have 
155 new brothers and sisters thanks to an agreement between the union and Southwestern Bell 
Communications. Meanwhile, workers at cable companies in Michigan, New York and California 
voted for CWA representation. They are the inside technicians at Comcast Cable in Detroit, 
workers at Chambers Cable Television in Chico, Calif., and the tech unit of TCI Cable in 
Smithhaven, N.Y. </p>
<p>SMOOTH LANDING -- Flight Attendants at Executive Airlines, based in San Juan, P.R., landed 
a first contract providing pay increases for its 113 crew members. Attendants at the American 
Eagle regional carrier joined AFA in 1995. </p>
<p>UNPLUG ELECTRIC DEREGULATION -- Utility Workers Locals 369 and 387 led 2,500 
people in a rally in Boston Feb. 1 to decry the headlong rush to deregulate and restructure the 
electric utility industry. AFL-CIO Secretary-Treasurer Richard L. Trumka closed the rally with a 
rousing speech reaffirming for the workers that &quot;we will not go gently into the long, dark night of 
rapid, radical, destructive utility deregulation.&quot; </p>
<p>GOP AIMS AT OVERTIME -- While President Clinton and the Democrats want to expand the 
Family and Medical Leave Act, Republicans in both houses want to let bosses substitute comp time 
for paid overtime. Workers certainly want more control over their time at work, but the GOP bills 
&quot;will mean more control for employers --and less money for working people,&quot; Karen Nussbaum, 
director of the AFL-CIO's Working Women's Department, told House and Senate committees last 
week. </p>
<p>AVONDALE WORKERS STAY AFLOAT -- The National Labor Relations Board ordered 
Avondale Shipyard to count a final group of 550 ballots to decide a long-postponed certification 
ratification for some 4,000 workers. The union needs less than 20 votes to win at the Metairie, La., 
yard, where management has used a succession of loopholes since a June 1993 election to deprive 
workers of their rights. </p>
<p>TWIN CITIES' CLEAN UP -- Some 3,500 Service Employees working in the Minneapolis-St. 
Paul cleaning industry have a new three-year master contract that provides full-time employees with 
wage increases and part-time workers with paid holidays. The deal covers workers employed by 
18 janitorial companies. </p>
<p>NO-FLY ZONE -- In the wake of USAir's use of an employer- dominated employee association 
(AKA company union), the Communications Workers will challenge the results of a representation 
election for nearly 10,000 passenger service workers. Although 3,973 ballots were cast in favor of 
CWA out of 4,190 cast and deemed valid, the Railway Labor Act requires a majority of all eligible 
voters. &quot;It was clear that CWA would have won this election under the labor laws that govern most 
private- industry workers,&quot; AFL-CIO President John Sweeney said. </p>
<p>OVERNITE MUST BARGAIN -- Two federal appeals courts ordered Overnite Transportation 
to negotiate with Teamsters locals at the company's terminals in St. Louis and Milwaukee. Both 
units were elected and certified last year, but management refused to bargain with workers. &quot;The 
Teamsters aren't going to let Overnite get away with anything and, it appears, neither are the 
courts,&quot; said IBT Freight Division Director Dennis Skelton. The union is involved in a massive 
national organizing campaign at the nation's largest nonunion trucking firm. </p>
<p>COMIN' INTO LOS ANGELES -- The City of Angels is the site for the AFL-CIO Executive 
Council's annual winter meeting next week -- the first the time the gathering has been held outside 
of Bal Harbour, Fla. in 40 years. The Federation's trade departments begin their meetings this 
week and an indoor &quot;picnic&quot; at Union Station for L.A. union members, activists and leaders kicks 
off the main event Sunday night. A march to support organizing efforts at the New Otani Hotel in 
L.A. is set for Wednesday Feb. 19. Vice President Al Gore, Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle 
(D-S.D.) and House Minority Leader Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.) will address the council. 
Executive Vice President Linda Chavez-Thompson and a delegation of union presidents tour the 
strawberry fields and workers' homes in Watsonville, Feb. 16 and will update the council on the 
strawberry campaign. </p>
<p>NY PROJECT LABOR AGREEMENTS OK -- New York Gov. George Pataki (R) has OK'd 
project labor agreements on several public work construction projects. Under the agreement, 
unions and the prime contractors agree on terms and conditions of employment and all project 
workers must join their craft union. &quot;We praise the governor for honoring his commitment to 
stimulate job creation for the working men and women of the construction industry,&quot; said Edward J. 
Malloy, president of the New York State Building Trades Council. </p>
<p>BUSTED AT YALE -- In a major reversal of policy, the National Labor Relations Board regional 
office charged that Yale University illegally threatened graduate students who participated in a 
&quot;grade strike&quot; last year. The strike was part of an action by the Graduate Employees and Students 
Organization, affiliated with the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees, which was seeking 
recognition by the school. Previously, the NLRB has ruled that graduate students who taught were 
not employees under federal labor law. </p>
<p>JIMMY AND THE BLAZERS -- Electronic Workers at GM's &quot;sport ute&quot; assembly plant in 
Moraine, Ohio, ratified a new three-year pact. The settlement comes on the heels of a three-day 
strike and the rejection of an earlier GM offer that would have included a controversial absenteeism 
policy. </p>
<p>BAD LIGHT AT GE -- Five months before a contract with the 14- union Coordinated Bargaining 
Committee expires, GE's CEO has thrown down the gauntlet. John Welch rejected outright three 
important union bargaining goals and began preparing for strife by declaring GE was the &quot;best 
prepared company in the world to take a strike.&quot; The unions reacted with shock to Welch's 
&quot;irresponsible, union busting&quot; rhetoric. </p>
<p>NO BUBBA GUMP HERE -- UNITE filed charges of race and sex discrimination on behalf of 
more than 200 of its members working at Kitchens of the Ocean shrimp processor in Deerfield 
Beach, Fla. Last year, the workers overwhelmingly voted to join UNITE, but the company refuses 
to bargain. </p>
<p>SEEKING SAFE WORKPLACES -- A judicial order upholding a major lockout/tagout citation 
against Dayton Tire, a Bridgestone/Firestone subsidiary, wins Steelworkers' applause. One 
hundred violations carrying a total fine of $518,000 remain on the record, including &quot;willful&quot; 
violations that led to the death of Robert Julian on a tire assembly machine. &quot;Nothing can bring 
back Bob Julian,&quot; Tony Carr, USWA Local 998L safety and health chairman says, but the decision 
&quot;means that Bob's coworkers will not have to face the same hazards.&quot; </p>
<p>16-YEAR DISPUTE SETTLED -- The Denver Federation of Nurses and Health Professionals 
(AFT) and St. Anthony Central and North hospitals resolved a 16-year dispute with a settlement 
that calls for the hospital to pay $381,000 to 435 technicians and licensed practical nurses. Sixteen 
years ago, hospital administrators made changes in time-off policies without negotiating with the 
union. </p>
<p>WAGE LAWS IGNORED -- The Massachusetts Foundation for Fair Contracting has a new 
survey that finds many contractors violate the state's prevailing wage laws by underpaying workers 
and misclassifying workers. Of the 309 workers the foundation polled, 64 percent were nonunion. 
Of those, 43 percent had no health insurance, 48 percent had no pension plans and 81 percent had 
never received apprenticeship training, even though their employers had promised to train them. </p>
<p>PHILLY TEACHERS BLAST TEST -- As President Clinton attempts to put children and 
education first, the Philadelphia Federation of Teachers continued its offensive against the school 
district's accountability plan, blasting a standardized test that does not measure what students have 
been taught. The union, which represents 12,000 teachers, declared that the only ones to &quot;benefit 
from this are the administrators who will get bonuses for falsely inflated test scores.&quot; </p>
<p>SOMETHING IN THE OVEN -- Food and Commercial Workers Local 1059 gained a new 
three-year contract at Pillsbury that will boost the hourly wage rate for workers at the Wellston, 
Ohio, plant by $1.50 per hour over term. The contract, which also increases the company pension 
contributions, covers 1,100 production and maintenance workers. </p>
<p>IMITATION IS NOT FLATTERY -- AFL-CIO President John Sweeney urged many of the 
world's leading financial and political leaders to resist copying a U.S. model of export-led growth, 
tight money, tax breaks for the affluent and cutbacks for the poor, deregulation of corporations, 
flexible labor markets and weakened unions. Speaking before the World Economic Forum in 
Switzerland, Sweeney warned that following that path would lead to &quot;massive social upheaval, with 
far greater economic costs than benefits.&quot; </p>
<p>SHOWING THE MONEY AT AP -- The Associated Press reached separate, three-year labor 
agreements with two unions representing 1,700 editorial and technical employees of the news 
cooperative. The contracts with the Wire Service Guild and Communication Workers both will 
increase salary and benefit costs approximately 9 percent over three years. Both improve pensions 
and provide for 401(k) matching. </p>
<p>DETROIT PAPERS BIASED --Four Detroit-area newspapers unfairly kept striking Detroit 
newspaper pressmen from working as substitutes in their pressrooms, an administrative law judge 
ruled. The judgement against the Bay City Times, Flint Journal, Grand Rapids Press and Saginaw 
News said the papers discriminated against the strikers and violated their contract with the union. 
The Times was ordered to pay five workers for lost wages as a result of being taken off a list of 
possible substitutes and all four papers were ordered to let strikers work as substitutes. </p>
<p>INDONESIAN PROTEST -- Hundreds of demonstrators chanted &quot;Free M.P., Free M.P.&quot; as 
they marched in front of the Indonesian embassy demanding the release of Indonesian labor leader 
Muchtar Pakpahan. Pakpahan, known as M.P., was arrested on trumped-up charges of 
subversion, and faces possible execution. AFL-CIO President John Sweeney and several 
international union leaders delivered a message to the Indonesian ambassador calling for 
Pakpahan's release and the granting of trade union rights. </p>

<p align="center">AFL-CIO Executive Council Statement<br>
December 16, 1996, Washington, D.C.</p>
<p align="left">STRAWBERRY WORKERS MARCH - APRIL 13, 1997<br>
<br>
In California, 20,000 strawberry workers are struggling for<br>
justice and dignity in the workplace. They are organizing for<br>
decent working conditions like clean drinking water and<br>
restrooms, for a living wage, for job security, health insurance<br>
and an end to sexual harassment.<br>
To win these basic rights that have been denied to them by<br>
their employers, strawberry workers have begun an industry-wide<br>
organizing campaign with the United Farm Workers of America.<br>
In response to the workers_ determination to end decades of<br>
exploitation in the fields, the strawberry industry and its<br>
allies have launched a vicious anti-union campaign marked by<br>
lies, firings, intimidation and even violence. Its purpose is to<br>
confuse, frighten and terrorize workers to force them to give up<br>
their effort to organize. As one of its tactics, the strawberry<br>
industry has threatened not to rehire union supporters for the<br>
1997 harvesting season unless they stop supporting the campaign.<br>
Despite the war being waged against them, thousands of<br>
strawberry workers have courageously signed cards in support of<br>
the UFW. They have given birth to the national Strawberry<br>
Workers Campaign, in which thousands of workers are speaking out,<br>
telling other workers across the country about the conditions<br>
they endure and about their desire to exercise their right to<br>
organize a union and improve life for themselves and their<br>
families.<br>
To help focus public attention on the struggle, the United<br>
Farm Workers have called for a Strawberry Workers March for<br>
Fairness on April 13, 1997, in Watsonville, Calif., the heart of<br>
strawberry country. The strawberry workers will demand that they<br>
and their co-workers be rehired in 1997. They are asking that<br>
their call for the most basic human, social and economic justice<br>
be heard, and they are standing up for the right of every worker<br>
to organize without fear of retaliation or intimidation by an<br>
employer. They deserve the support of the entire labor movement.<br>
Through support for this march, the labor movement can show<br>
the strawberry industry -- and all of corporate America -- that<br>
workers will not be daunted or deterred from their determination<br>
to organize.<br>
The AFL-CIO Executive Council urges all affiliated unions,<br>
its state federation and its local central bodies to participate<br>
in the strawberry workers march on April 13 in Watsonville, and<br>
to encourage their members and their families to turn out in<br>
massive numbers to support the UFW and the strawberry workers in<br>
this struggle for justice.</p>

<p align="center">AFL-CIO Executive Council Statement<br>
December 16, 1996, Washington, D.C.</p>
<p align="left">BLOCK GRANTING ECONOMIC SECURITY PROGRAMS<br>
<br>
The Great Depression of the 1930s proved that only the<br>
federal government can provide national economic stability. <br>
Unrestrained private-sector economic activity had resulted in the<br>
Great Depression, and private charities and state and local<br>
governments were overwhelmed by the unemployment and the poor.<br>
Since then, the nation has constructed an economic security<br>
_safety net_ which has helped individuals in need and reduced<br>
wide swings between deep recession and rapid economic growth. <br>
All Americans have benefited from increased economic stability. <br>
That safety net is now under attack.<br>
In fact, the recently-passed welfare law (TANF) has already<br>
ended one of the original economic security programs, Aid to<br>
Families with Dependent Children, thus making it all the more<br>
important that we retain and strengthen the others: unemployment<br>
insurance benefits and employment services for workers who lose<br>
their jobs; Medicaid health benefits for poor and unemployed<br>
families; and food stamp assistance for the poor and unemployed.<br>
Further, TANF is silent with regard to whether welfare-to-<br>
work participants will receive at least the minimum wage or<br>
coverage under workers_ compensation, health and safety, anti-<br>
discrimination, collective bargaining, and other employment laws. <br>
In addition, TANF does not adequately protect unfilled union jobs<br>
from being converted into workfare slots or protect against<br>
partial displacement of the current workforce through reductions<br>
in hours and wages.<br>
Additional proposals have been advanced that would weaken or<br>
destroy key features of the Medicaid, food stamps, unemployment<br>
insurance and employment services programs. By limiting how much<br>
money the federal government could spend in the form of fixed<br>
_block grants,_ these proposals would destroy their crucial<br>
counter-cyclical features and their ability to stabilize the<br>
American economy. They would lead to a reduction in the number<br>
of people receiving those benefits and the value of the benefits.<br>
In addition, these devolution plans would allow the states<br>
to turn the public administration of these programs over to<br>
private organizations, triggering contract bidding wars of<br>
unprecedented magnitude. Crucial accountability mechanisms, such<br>
as requirements for merit-based personnel systems which have<br>
protected these programs from political corruption would be lost.<br>
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED: That the AFL-CIO strongly opposes<br>
any attempts to devolve and privatize the Medicaid, food stamp,<br>
unemployment insurance and employment service programs;<br>
That the AFL-CIO will work to ensure that public employees<br>
continue to administer welfare programs so that the programs<br>
remain impartial and accountable to the public.<br>
That the AFL-CIO secure pledges from non-profit<br>
organizations to which it contributes or promotes that they will<br>
agree to participate only in welfare-to-work programs that treat<br>
the participants fairly and do not reduce their current<br>
workforce;<br>
The AFL-CIO also resolves to work for passage of legislation<br>
which guarantees that welfare recipients are entitled to all the<br>
same rights and protections as other workers, thereby maintaining<br>
the integrity of our labor laws.</p>

<title>12/16/96 STOP THE RAIL INDUSTRY RAID ON WORKERS_ PENSIONS</title>

<p align="center">AFL-CIO Executive Council Statement<br>
December 16, 1996, Washington, D.C.</p>
<p align="left">STOP THE RAIL INDUSTRY RAID ON WORKERS_ PENSIONS<br>
<br>
Because of the hazardous nature and uniqueness of work in<br>
the rail industry, Congress amended the Railroad Retirement Act<br>
of 1946 to provide occupational disability protection for career<br>
industry workers who may become sick or injured.<br>
Section 2(a)(2) of the Railroad Retirement Act provides that<br>
the Railroad Retirement Board _with the cooperation of employers<br>
and employees_ shall secure the establishment of standards for<br>
determining the conditions that would disable industry workers<br>
for various railroad occupations. The Act further provides that<br>
_the Board, employers, and employees shall cooperate_ in the<br>
promotion of uniform standards.<br>
The rail unions have been working in good faith since 1979<br>
to develop the disability standards that the law requires and in<br>
fact supported the standards developed by the Board_s technical<br>
staff in 1988. Unfortunately, the American Association of<br>
Railroads (AAR) refused to agree to these standards thus<br>
preventing an agreement from being implemented.<br>
The AAR has instead hired an outside contractor to develop a<br>
set of standards designed to their specifications. These<br>
standards purposely create a costly and time-consuming process by<br>
which sick and disabled employees are evaluated for disability. <br>
The Management Member of the Board has convinced the Chairman to<br>
set an arbitrary deadline for the joint task force that was<br>
formed to conduct the legally-required review of disability<br>
standards. This is a blatant attempt by rail management to<br>
circumvent their good-faith agreement to work with rail labor<br>
towards developing a complete and uniform set of standards.<br>
The Board has indicated that it is ready to impose the AAR<br>
standards that were designed to make it more difficult for sick<br>
and injured rail workers to qualify for a disability pension.<br>
The railroad industry_s termination of the ongoing<br>
negotiations and its attempt to unilaterally impose the AAR<br>
standards is a direct attack on rail workers. It amounts to a<br>
raid on the pension system that they depend on. This action is<br>
unfair, corrupts the negotiating process and is contrary to a<br>
long-standing law. This threat to the health and welfare of rail<br>
workers cannot and will not go unchallenged.<br>
The AFL-CIO supports the political and economic efforts of<br>
the labor organizations that represent rail workers to persuade<br>
the rail industry and the Railroad Retirement Board that the<br>
unilateral course of action they are pursuing is unfair, unwise<br>
and illegal.<br>
The AFL-CIO will support the members of our rail affiliates<br>
as they work to protect the health and welfare of rail workers<br>
and to end this misguided effort to undermine occupational<br>
disability standards and the railroad retirement system.</p>

<p align="center">AFL-CIO Executive Council Statement<br>
December 16, 1996, Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>JOBS WITH JUSTICE COALITION<br>
<br>
Workers have a fundamental right to job security, a decent<br>
standard of living and the right to organize on the job. <br>
Employers' attacks on these basic workers' rights are increasing<br>
while workers' rights to organize are being deeply eroded.<br>
The Jobs with Justice coalition, founded and supported by<br>
the labor movement, has worked tireless for nearly a decade to<br>
build local coalitions of community, religious and labor<br>
organizations in cities across the country. Through its efforts,<br>
including its innovative Workers' Rights Boards, Jobs with<br>
Justice has helped build community-wide support to mobilize<br>
activists in support of every worker's right to organize a union<br>
and to have a voice in conditions on the job.<br>
The AFL-CIO Executive Council supports Jobs with Justice and<br>
encourages national and international unions, state federations<br>
and central labor councils to work cooperatively with the<br>
coalitions in their communities.<br>
The AFL-CIO Organizing Department and Field Mobilization<br>
Department look forward to cooperative efforts with Jobs with<br>
Justice coalitions on campaigns to organize new members, to focus<br>
public attention on abuses in the workplace and in the community<br>
and to mobilize support for struggles for justice and dignity.<br>
The AFL-CIO will provide financial and staff support for<br>
Jobs with Justice that will assist the coalition in coordinating<br>
with central labor councils in their cooperative efforts to<br>
broaden community and religious participation in support of<br>
organizing, to expand and develop strong community coalitions and<br>
in the formation of Workers' Rights Boards in many communities.</p>

<title>8/7/96-Support for Anna Veterans' Home Workers</title>
<meta name="GENERATOR" content="Microsoft FrontPage 1.1">
</head>
<body>
<h3 align="center">AFL-CIO Executive Council August 7, 1996,
Chicago Statement </h3>
<p><strong>SUPPORT FOR ANNA VETERANS_ HOME WORKERS</strong> </p>
<p>In August 1995, workers at the state veterans_ home in Anna,
Illinois voted to be represented by AFSCME. Yet one year later,
these workers have been unable to negotiate a first contract with
ServiceMaster, the for-profit, out-of-state contractor that
operates the facility. </p>
<p>The State of Illinois Department of Veterans_ Affairs operates
four veterans_ homes, each of which receives significant federal
funding. Unionized workers at the three other stateoperated
veterans_ homes in Illinois have health insurance and pensions.
Certified Nursing Assistants, who make up nearly twothirds of the
employees in the homes, are paid $9.60 per hour in the three
facilities where the workers have a union. At the Anna home, the
only one in the state run by a private contractor at taxpayers_
expense, ServiceMaster pays CNAs only $4.67 per hour with no
health or pension benefits. </p>
<p>As a result of ServiceMaster_s refusal to bargain in good
faith, the Anna workers voted unanimously to strike on Saturday,
August 10, 1996. In response, ServiceMaster has announced its
plans to hire permanent replacements for the strikers. </p>
<p>The AFL-CIO Executive Council condemns the refusal of
ServiceMaster to bargain in good faith with the workers at the
Anna veterans_ home. We call on the State of Illinois to take
steps immediately to bring about a fair settlement with these
workers, and, if ServiceMaster refuses to bargain, to cancel its
contract with the company. Further, we will call on the U.S.
Department of Veterans Affairs to remove the residents from this
facility and cease to provide any further financial subsidies to
ServiceMaster so long as it continues to employ strikebreakers.</p>

<title>8/7/96-Appeals and Protests Arising from State and Local
Cent</title>
<meta name="GENERATOR" content="Microsoft FrontPage 1.1">
</head>
<body>
<h3 align="center">AFL-CIO Executive Council August 7, 1996,
Chicago Statement </h3>
<p><strong>APPEALS AND PROTESTS ARISING FROM</strong><br>
<strong>STATE AND LOCAL CENTRAL BODIES</strong> </p>
<p>Recent experience and periodic examination of the Rules
Governing AFL-CIO State Central Bodies (_State Rules_) and the
Rules Governing AFL-CIO Local Central Bodies (_Local Rules_) lead
the Executive Council to amend these rules in order to clarify
the authority of the AFL-CIO to consider and act on protests and
appeals of central body elections; clarify the AFL-CIO_s
authority to review other final decisions rendered at the state
and local levels; and conform the disciplinary appeal rules and
the general appeal rules more precisely to the AFL-CIO
Constitution. </p>
<ol>
    <li>Adding a New Rule 28 to Make Explicit AFL-CIO Authority
        to Hear Protests of Central Body Elections </li>
</ol>
<p>The AFL-CIO traditionally has exercised jurisdiction to
consider protests and appeals of elections of officers of central
bodies under the authority of Rule 27, which provides in part as
follows: _Any final decision of a [state] [local] central body in
a matter requiring a hearing within the central body under these
rules may be appealed to the President within 30 days after the
decision appealed from._ </p>
<p>The AFL-CIO has exercised this authority recently with respect
to officer elections at the Pennsylvania AFL-CIO in 1990, and at
the Alabama AFL-CIO and the Arkansas AFL-CIO in 1995-96. During
review of the two 1995-96 elections, objections were raised
concerning the AFL-CIO_s authority to take any such action under
Rule 27. </p>
<p>It remains important that the AFL-CIO retain such authority in
order to guarantee the fairness of officer elections within its
subordinate state and local central bodies and to keep election
disputes out of court. For that reason the State Rules and the
Local Rules are amended by adding a new Rule 28, _Election
Protests,_ in order to eliminate any arguable ambiguity about the
AFL-CIO_s authority to entertain election protests and appeals.
Current Local Rule 28, _Dissolution,_ is renumbered as Rule 29. </p>
<p>2. Amending Rule 27 to Clarify the Breadth of the AFL-CIO_s </p>
<pre>     Authority to Consider Appeals from Certain Other Central Body Decisions
     Another problematic aspect of Rule 27 is the phrase _under these rules,_ because it may be read to limit Rule 27 to appeals only from _hearing[s]_ specifically required by the express terms of the State Rules or the Local Rules themselves. There is only one such hearing in each set of rules, namely, that required by Rule 13 for the suspension or removal of a central body officer or executive board member. The AFL-CIO has interpreted _under these rules_ more broadly to cover any hearing provided at the state or local level, inasmuch as state and local federation constitutions and rules that provide for hearings in other situations are enacted solely due to the authority granted to state and local central bodies by the AFL-CIO _under_ the AFL-CIO Constitution and the Rules. </pre>
<p>Because the central body rules should not invite uncertainty
or legal entanglements over the nature of the AFL-CIO_s
authority, Rule 27 is amended by deleting the phrase _under these
rules._ </p>
<p>3. Amending Rule 25 to Conform With the AFL-CIO Constitution </p>
<p>Article XIII, Section 3 of the AFL-CIO Constitution, which
addresses _disciplinary action against central labor bodies, or
their officers,_ states that central body rules must provide for
an appeal from the President to _the Appeals Committee of the
Executive Council._ Rule 25(g), which governs appeals from such
disciplinary actions, refers to an appeal to the _Executive
Council_ and guarantees a _right to appear_ before the Council.
Rule 25(g) further provides that such matters _may be further
appealed to the next succeeding convention of the AFL-CIO._ </p>
<p>In order to conform Rule 25(g) with the Constitution, Rule
25(g) is amended in order to specify that the first appeal is to
the Appeals Committee, rather than to the Executive Council
itself. Rule 25(g)_s provision of a further appeal to the
convention is also amended to specify that this appeal is to the
_next succeeding regular convention._ Article IV, Section 3(d) of
the Constitution limits a special convention to _the subject or
subjects specifically and definitely indicated in the
[convention] call,_ so this amendment to Rule 25(g) also conforms
it more closely to the Constitution and eliminates any unintended
ambiguity. </p>
<p>4. Amending Rule 27 to Conform With the AFL-CIO Constitution </p>
<p>Rule 27 provides the same two appeal steps as Rule 25(g),
namely, first to the Executive Council and then to the
convention. However, the AFL-CIO has referred appeals under Rule
27 to the Appeals Committee rather than the full Executive
Council. Therefore, Rule 27 is amended in the same manner as is
Rule 25(g). </p>
<hr>
<p><strong>AMENDMENTS</strong> </p>
<p>RULE 25(g) </p>
<pre>     (g) Any disciplinary action taken by the President under
     this rule may be appealed by the individual or
     organization involved to the Appeals Committee of the
     Executive Council of the AFL-CIO.  Any such appeal shall
     be filed in writing with the Secretary-Treasurer within
     30 days after notice of the disciplinary action being
     appealed.  Appellants shall have the right to appear
     before the Executive Council Appeals Committee in support
     of their appeal.  The decision of the Executive Council
     Appeals Committee on any appeal taken pursuant to this
     paragraph may be further appealed to the next succeeding
     regular convention of the AFL-CIO.  Such further appeal
     shall be filed in writing with the Secretary-Treasurer at
     least 30 days prior to the opening of the convention.  An
     appellant shall have the right to appear before any
     appeals committee of the convention and, except in the
     case of an individual appellant, shall have the right to
     appear before the convention itself.  An individual
     appellant shall have the right to appear personally
     before the convention itself only with the consent of the
     convention.

     RULE 27.  APPEALS

     Any final decision of a [state] [local] central body in
     a matter requiring a hearing within the central body
     under these rules may be appealed to the President within
     30 days after the decision appealed from.  The decision
     of the President may thereafter be appealed to the
     Appeals Committee of the Executive Council.  Any such
     appeal shall be filed in writing with the Secretary-
     Treasurer within 30 days after notice of the action being
     appealed.  Appellants shall have the right to appear
     before the Executive Council Appeals Committee in support
     of their appeal.  The decision of the Executive Council
     Appeals Committee may be further appealed to the next
     succeeding regular convention of the AFL-CIO.  Such
     further appeal shall be filed in writing with the
     Secretary-Treasurer at least 30 days prior to the opening
     of the convention.  The appellant shall have the right to
     appear before any appeals committee of the convention
     and, except in the case of an individual appellant, shall
     have the right to appear before the convention itself.
     An individual appellant shall have the right to appear
     personally before the convention itself only with the
     consent of the convention.  During any such appeal the
     original decision of the state central body, or of the
     President, or of the Executive Council Appeals Committee
     as the case may be, shall remain in effect unless
     reversed, modified or temporarily stayed.

     RULE 28.  ELECTION PROTESTS

     A protest of the election of an officer of a [state]
     [local] central body may be made to the President within
     30 days of exhaustion of any applicable procedures
     provided by the constitution or bylaws of the [state]
     [local] central body.  If the President upholds a
     protest, in determining the appropriate remedy he may
     direct that the election be rerun or a new election be
     conducted, and he may decide the manner of conduct of any
     such election.  The decision of the President may
     thereafter be appealed in accordance with the procedures
     set forth in Rule 27.</pre>

<title>8/7/96-Article XX Protection for Independent Unions</title>
<meta name="GENERATOR" content="Microsoft FrontPage 1.1">
</head>
<body>
<h3 align="center">AFL-CIO Executive Council August 7, 1996,
Chicago Statement </h3>
<p><strong>ARTICLE XX PROTECTION FOR INDEPENDENT UNIONS</strong> </p>
<p>Before May 1992, under Article XX where an AFL-CIO national or
international union filed a petition with a labor board to become
the exclusive bargaining representative of an appropriate
bargaining unit represented by an independent union and the
independent then consummated an affiliation with a second AFL-CIO
union, it was a violation for the first affiliate to maintain its
petition and continue its organizing effort. </p>
<p>In May 1992, the Executive Council Committee on Article XX
Review, after extensive consideration of this rule and its
effects, concluded that the Article XX law in this regard was
sufficiently questionable to justify amending the Executive
Council Policy Statements on Article XX Protection for
Independent Unions for a one-year trial period. That trial period
has been successively extended each year since. </p>
<p>The Council now concludes that this amendment, in revised but
substantively identical form, should be permanent. In the
Council_s judgment, Article XX should not penalize a union that
engages in a bottom-up organizing campaign to the point of filing
an election petition by giving preference instead to a subsequent
affiliation that may be secured by the independent union, usually
substantially for purposes of self-preservation. Accordingly, the
Council amends Policy Statement No. 10, as modified by Policy
Statement No. 14, by adding after the current paragraph (4) the
following: </p>

          &quot;(5) Where an independent union or association
     becomes a local or other subordinate body of an AFL-CIO
     national or international union through an affiliation
     that is consummated after one or more other AFL-CIO
     national or international unions have filed valid
     representation petitions, or valid interventions on such
     petitions, covering one or more appropriate bargaining
     units represented by the independent, it shall not

     shall it violate Article XX for the union that
     consummated the affiliation to participate in, or to
     assist the independent in, that process.  A union that,
     prior to filing a petition or intervention, has
     participated directly or indirectly in any legal
     proceeding that has the effect of delaying consummation
     of the affiliation shall not be entitled to the benefits
     of this provision.&quot;</pre>

<title>8/7/96-Opposition to Bell Atlantic-Nynex Buyout</title>
<meta name="GENERATOR" content="Microsoft FrontPage 1.1">
</head>
<body>
<h3 align="center">AFL-CIO Executive Council August 7, 1996,
Chicago Statement </h3>
<p><strong>OPPOSITION TO BELL ATLANTIC-NYNEX BUYOUT</strong> </p>
<p>Bell Atlantic_s plan to purchase NYNEX and create a
telecommunications giant dominating the Boston-to-Washington
urban corridor threatens the best interest of the workers,
communities and telephone customers involved, as well as the
health of the industry overall. While the acquisition was made
possible by the recent Telecommunications Act, the plan subverts
the Act_s real intent, and it should be blocked. </p>
<p>This proposed concentration of corporate power and media
control has raised enormous concern by a growing coalition of
public interest groups -- concern that is well founded. Both
companies have allowed service standards to deteriorate, while
steadily downsizing their workforces and funneling these savings
into sideline business ventures instead of maintaining or
improving their telecom systems. NYNEX has been paying millions
of dollars in fines for service delays and outages while the
citizens of New York pay the highest phone rates in the country.
Bell Atlantic has recorded a near 500 percent increase in
customer repeat trouble complaints to the Federal Communications
Commission, meanwhile raking in record profits -- second-highest
among the Bell companies -- and continuing to press for rate
increases. </p>
<p>While state public utility commissioners have looked toward
future competitive voices to pressure these companies into
providing high quality service at reasonable rates, the proposed
Bell Atlantic-NYNEX alliance would eliminate the greatest
potential source of competition -- competition from each other, a
factor envisioned in the 1996 Act. The new company overnight
would become the nation_s second largest telecommunications
company, behind only AT&amp;T, with a combined territory that
accounts for about 30 percent of the long-distance telephone
traffic in the United States. </p>
<p>The corporate culture of these companies should be closely
examined in judging whether the more powerful _new Bell Atlantic_
could be expected to behave in a responsible manner. And here,
the track record of the senior partner in this deal, Bell
Atlantic, is cause for special alarm. It is a record of the worst
labor relations in the industry, and of the systematic erosion of
jobs and job standards. </p>
<p>In fact, there has already been a preview of the proposed
partnership, as the 90,000 NYNEX and Bell Atlantic workers
represented by the Communications Workers of America and the
International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers can attest. </p>
<p>When the two companies merged their cellular phone operations
last year, the predatory corporate philosophy of Bell Atlantic
prevailed over the formerly more enlightened labor relations
policy of NYNEX, and the new Bell Atlantic/NYNEX Mobile venture
soon joined the AFL-CIO_s _Don_t Buy_ list. The mobile company
trashed NYNEX_s collective bargaining agreements with both
unions, justifying this breach of contract, and faith with its
workers, by claiming that it was a new enterprise which didn_t
have to honor previous commitments. </p>
<p>Notwithstanding the fact that this action was illegal and
likely will be overturned by the National Labor Relations Board,
complaints to that effect have been issued by the NLRB, Bell
Atlantic revealed its core corporate values by issuing a
boilerplate union-busters _Supervisors Guide_ for the mobile
company advising how to _inform employees of the disadvantages of
belonging to a union_ and urging supervisors to _inform employees
of known negatives about the union and union officials trying to
organize them, such as criminal activities (racketeering,
kickbacks, bribery, etc.)._ </p>
<p>This activity fits the pattern of Bell Atlantic_s strategy the
last few years of creating new non-union subsidiaries for the
jobs of the future, denying transfer rights to these jobs for
union workers facing layoff, spying on, intimidating and firing
people who try to organize, and attempting whenever possible to
subcontract work and jobs away from the union bargaining units. </p>
<p>Bell Atlantic_s arrogance an anti-union animus were further
spotlighted last year when its management boasted that it would
_break the pattern_ of union contracts bargained throughout the
rest of the industry and impose givebacks on the workers. Bell
Atlantic only fell in line with the industry after an
extraordinary 6-month corporate campaign and multi-million-dollar
advertising/media effort by CWA. </p>
<p>There is no indication that the new merged company would seek
to build more positive and cooperative labor relations. CWA and
IBEW leaders have discussed the proposed alliance with company
management, but the companies, particularly the senior partner,
Bell Atlantic, refuse to give commitments to job protections or
to reverse their anti-union posture at the joint cellular
company. From this, the public can only be left to predict labor
discord rather than labor stability, but on an even larger scale,
at the _new Bell Atlantic._ </p>
<p>Proponents of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 declared
their intent to open up competition in the telecommunications
market, foster new and better services at reasonable rates, and
also create thousands of good new jobs in a dynamic industry. </p>
<p>It is clear that Bell Atlantic_s buyout of NYNEX would take us
in the opposite direction: a bigger telecom monopoly with even
less incentive to reverse the companies, existing pattern of
declining service standards, ever higher rates, and the
destruction of good jobs. </p>
<p>The AFL-CIO pledges full support to the CWA and IBEW in
seeking to block the Bell Atlantic-NYNEX alliance, and calls upon
all federal and state agencies charged with reviewing the
proposed deal to withhold approval. </p>
<p>The AFL-CIO reaffirms its boycott of NYNEX-Bell Atlantic
Mobile and urges members of all affiliates to utilize the
alternative carrier for cellular telephone service.</p>

<title>8/7/96-Burning of Religious Institutions</title>
<meta name="GENERATOR" content="Microsoft FrontPage 1.1">
</head>
<body>
<h3 align="center">AFL-CIO Executive Council August 7, 1996,
Chicago Statement </h3>
<p><strong>BURNING OF RELIGIOUS INSTITUTIONS</strong> </p>
<p>A dramatic increase in racial, ethnic, religious and
sexually-oriented hate crimes in America, rooted in bigotry and
intolerance, has touched and angered communities and citizens
across the country. </p>
<p>An outbreak of burnings, fire bombings and vandalism has
destroyed hundreds of houses of worship with churches of
predominantly black membership often the primary targets. Vicious
white supremacist groups and ultra right-wing sects have been
linked to a growing number of incidents of cross burnings, racist
graffiti, hate literature, malicious mail and death threats meant
to divide and weaken communities and terrorize the innocent
victims of their malice. </p>
<p>The AFL-CIO condemns these hostile acts of cowardly
intolerance and the sickening enmity that endangers the
principles of freedom, liberty and justice on which this country
was founded. </p>
<p>The federation will mobilize its affiliated unions and its
state and local labor councils to work actively against the
forces of intolerance and bigotry that are behind these crimes.
We will work with groups from different faiths and with our
allies in civil and human rights organizations to help open an
honest dialogue within the communities where these crimes have
occurred to foster and create a climate of tolerance and unity,
and we will work to help rebuild and restore the houses of
worship that have been vandalized by these hate criminals.</p>

<title>8/7/96-English as the Official Language of Government Act</title>
<meta name="GENERATOR" content="Microsoft FrontPage 1.1">
</head>
<body>
<h3 align="center">AFL-CIO Executive Council August 7, 1996,
Chicago Statement </h3>
<p><strong>ENGLISH AS THE OFFICIAL LANGUAGE</strong> <strong>OF
GOVERNMENT ACT (H.R. 123)</strong> </p>
<p>The AFL-CIO is deeply disturbed with the passage of
legislation H.R. 123 by the U.S. House of Representatives
declaring English the official language of the federal
government. </p>
<p>This bill if passed by the U.S. Senate and enacted into law
would require that all official government business be conducted
in English and would repeal a federal law mandating that states
with large concentrations of non-English speaking voters provide
bilingual voting ballots. </p>
<p>The AFL-CIO strongly supported the minority language
amendments to the Voting Rights Act, in 1975 and again in 1992.
These amendments help to ensure language minority citizens equal
access to the electorial process by requiring that registration
and voting materials be provided in the language of the minority
group, as well as in English, in appropriate jurisdictions. </p>
<p>H.R. 123 would disenfranchise, divide and disconnect millions
of Americans from their government. At the same time it would
weaken the federal government_s ability to deal effectively with
the challenges of living in a global age. </p>
<p>As a practical matter, government, public schools, the courts
and other institutions must adjust to the realities of the people
they serve. Newly arrived immigrants, and even some who have
lived in this country for years, might fail to acquire fluency in
English but still have a contribution to make to American
society. </p>
<p>The national interest can best be served when all members of
our society have equal opportunity plus a mastery of a second or
multiple languages and can exercise their rights and
responsibilities in the electoral, legal system, social services
and health care. </p>
<p>The AFL-CIO urges expanding public funding for adult education
programs and English as a second language because isolating
immigrants and American born citizens who are not fluent in
English leads to exploitation and discrimination. </p>
<p>New Americans are going to have to learn English if they are
to compete. English is still a powerful language around the
world. In the era of modern communications, Americans who think
the English language needs the law to bolster its position betray
a strange lack of confidence in its influence and appeal. English
is already our _common_ language.</p>

Statement </h3>
<p><strong>FOULBALL CAMPAIGN</strong> </p>
<p>WHEREAS, Millions of dollars worth of soccer balls are
annually imported into the United States by an industry which
regularly uses and abuses impoverished child laborers as human
sewing machines; and </p>
<p>WHEREAS, Over 5 million soccer balls imported and sold in the
U.S., 80%, are hand stitched by children between the ages of 5 -
14. 35 million soccer balls are produced annually, primarily in
Pakistan and other third world countries. The FOULBALL Campaign
estimates that over 3,000 Pakistani children under the age of 14
work six days a week making soccer balls for the U.S. market; and </p>
<p>WHEREAS, There has been an 83% increase in the number of U.S.
soccer players, mostly children and teens, in the past decade. As
the U.S. market is burgeoning, the sporting goods industry is
increasing the manufacture of sporting goods by children in
nations where the unemployment rate of adults is very high. This
child labor exploitation is destructive to the well-being of
those families and their nations. We who play these games and buy
these soccer balls must demand that no child labor is involved;
and </p>
<p>WHEREAS, The FOULBALL Campaign is a coalition of humanitarian,
labor, consumer, religious, educational, and child advocacy
organizations, with support of the general public in the U.S. and
Europe; therefore, be it </p>
<p>RESOLVED: That the AFL-CIO supports the removal of child labor
from the soccer ball and sporting goods industries and requires
that former child ball stitchers be placed in schools and
physically rehabilitated; and, be it further </p>
<p>RESOLVED: That the AFL-CIO demands that the International
Federation of Football Associations (FIFA), the international
governing body of soccer which regulates all aspects of the game
and puts its seal of approval on every soccer ball which may be
used in any officially refereed contest, require a verifiable
&quot;NO CHILD LABOR&quot; clause in the contract of every
producer of a ball which carries the FIFA stamp of approval. This
FIFA stamp of approval will be a verifiable monitored guarantee
that its label on a soccer ball means &quot;MADE BY ADULTS
ONLY&quot; at a fair and just wage, with liberated child workers
educated and rehabilitated; and, be it further </p>
<p>RESOLVED: That the AFL-CIO supports the FOULBALL Campaign as
one way of prohibiting exploitative child labor through creation
of a system of enforceable global monitoring of soccer ball and
sporting goods production facilities throughout the world.</p>

<title>8/7/96-Implementing Article XX of the AFL-CIO Constitution</title>
<meta name="GENERATOR" content="Microsoft FrontPage 1.1">
</head>
<body>
<h3 align="center">AFL-CIO Executive Council August 7, 1996,
Chicago Statement </h3>
<p><strong>IMPLEMENTING ARTICLE XX</strong> <strong>OF THE
AFL-CIO CONSTITUTION</strong> </p>
<p>Pursuant to Section 7 of Article XX of the AFL-CIO
Constitution, the Executive Council issues the following
procedural rules for the handling of complaints filed and the
conduct of mediations and hearings conducted under this Article.
Cases initiated under this Article shall be managed by the AFLCIO
Article XX and Article XXI Coordinator under the direction of the
AFL-CIO President and Secretary-Treasurer. </p>
<pre>
      I.   Each national or international union shall advise the
      AFL-CIO of the name, address, telephone and fax number of
      its currently designated representative for Article XX
      matters if such representative is a person other than the
      union_s principal officer.  The AFL-CIO and each union
      involved in an Article XX proceeding shall send copies of
      all complaints and other correspondence to both the
      principal officer and the designated representative of every
      union involved.

      II.  A national or international union contemplating the
      filing of a complaint is encouraged to consult with the
      national or international union intended to be charged
      before the complaint is filed in order to attempt to resolve
      the dispute.

      III. In order to file a complaint, the principal officer of
      a national or international union shall submit a letter to
      the AFL-CIO President stating the specific nature of the
      alleged violation, the identity of the employer, the
      approximate number of employees involved, the location of
      the alleged violation, and the status of any related NLRB or
      other agency proceeding.  If the charging union wishes the
      AFL-CIO to advise the NLRB or other agency to hold its
      proceedings in abeyance in deference to the Article XX case,
      the charging union should so request in the letter and
      provide the case name and number and the address, telephone
      number and fax number of the agency conducting the
      proceeding.  If the charged union wishes the AFL-CIO to do
      so, it should so request in the same manner upon receipt of
      the Article XX complaint.

      IV.  After a complaint is filed, a mediation session
      ordinarily will be convened within ten days or as soon
      thereafter as can be arranged.  Mediation shall take place
      at AFL-CIO Headquarters.  The AFL-CIO President shall notify
      the unions involved of the scheduled mediation, and provide
      the charged union with a copy of the charge as received by
      the AFL-CIO.  In the event of pressing reasons and at the
      AFL-CIO President_s discretion, mediation may be waived and
      the case referred directly to the Impartial Umpire for a
      hearing.

      V.   Prior to the mediation session, the mediator and the
      designated representatives of the unions involved shall
      participate in a conference call to discuss the dispute and
      identify the persons who they expect may attend the
      mediation.  No union shall be precluded from bringing
      additional or other persons to the mediation.

      VI.  The mediator will attempt to effect a voluntary
      agreement resolving the dispute at the mediation session.
      Any designated representative who participates in the
      mediation session shall possess sufficient authority to
      settle, or at least effectively to recommend settlement of,
      the dispute.  At least one attendee from each union must be
      a representative who has knowledge of the facts and
      circumstances surrounding the dispute, normally from the
      local or other affiliate of the union where the dispute
      arose.  Attendees representing a local or other affiliate at
      the mediation session may participate by speaker-phone if
      necessary.  At the mediation session the unions shall
      exchange collective bargaining agreements, NLRB or other
      agency petitions and other documents that the unions then
      expect they may submit in evidence if a hearing on the
      dispute is later conducted by an Impartial Umpire.

      VII. If a mediated settlement is not achieved within 14 days
      of the appointment of the mediator, or by such other time as
      the AFL-CIO President or the mediator and the unions shall
      fix, the mediator shall certify the matter to the AFL-CIO
      President for a hearing by the Impartial Umpire.  In order
      to be considered at the hearing, any additional complaints
      or counter-complaints arising from the same circumstances
      shall be filed with the AFL-CIO by the time of
      certification.  If such an additional complaint or counter-
      complaint is filed after the mediation session, the mediator
      may schedule a further conference call or mediation session
      if the new complaint raises factual matters not previously
      addressed during mediation.  All complaints and counter-
      complaints arising from the same circumstances shall be
      consolidated for hearing and decision.

      VIII.      The AFL-CIO President shall immediately schedule a
      hearing before an Impartial Umpire.  The hearing will be
      conducted as soon as possible.  Alternatively, upon the
      parties_ agreement and at the discretion of the AFL-CIO
      President, the case may be submitted to the Impartial Umpire
      by a stipulation of facts in place of a hearing.

      IX.  Hearings shall be scheduled at 1=-hour intervals, with
      the understanding that if the mediator or the parties
      anticipate that a hearing will require a longer period of
      time, then they shall notify the AFL-CIO prior to scheduling
      the hearing.  Nothing shall preclude the Impartial Umpire
      from conducting a longer hearing if in his or her view it is
      necessary to afford the unions a full opportunity to present
      their positions.

      X.   Hearings shall be conducted at the AFL-CIO
      Headquarters; however, in the event of extenuating
      circumstances, the parties jointly may request to the
      AFL-CIO President and the Impartial Umpire that a hearing be
      held elsewhere. The AFL-CIO President shall rule on the
      request, in consultation with the Impartial Umpire where
      appropriate.

      XI.  At least five calendar days before the hearing, the
      unions involved shall notify each other of the persons whom
      they then expect may testify, including any who will do so
      by speaker-phone.  No union shall be precluded from
      presenting additional or other witnesses at the hearing.  A
      union may object to the proposed testimony by speaker-phone
      of any such witness by notifying the Impartial Umpire and
      the opposing union of the objection and requesting a ruling
      on the objection prior to the hearing.

      XII. If at the hearing a union seeks to present by speaker-
      phone a witness whom it did not previously identify, and the
      opposing union objects, the Impartial Umpire shall decide
      whether to allow the testimony, disallow the testimony or
      require the testimony to be offered in person at a later
      time.  The Impartial Umpire may also require any witness,
      whether or not previously identified, who testifies by
      speaker-phone to present his or her testimony in person at a
      later time if in his or her judgment such further appearance
      is warranted.

      XIII.      At the conclusion of the hearing the Impartial
      Umpire shall decide whether to hear oral argument or request
      briefs and/or other written materials to be filed.  Such
      argument may be heard at the hearing or in a subsequent
      conference call.  The Impartial Umpire may schedule a
      further hearing for the purpose of receiving evidence only
      in extraordinary circumstances, and such further hearing may
      be conducted by conference call.

      XIV. The Impartial Umpire otherwise shall have discretion to
      conduct hearings in such a manner as he or she considers
      will best serve this Article, consistent with the general
      practice under and the purposes of this Article.

      XV.  The Impartial Umpire shall issue a written
      determination upholding or rejecting the complaining union_s
      claims in whole or in part.  The AFL-CIO President shall
      transmit copies of the determination to the principal
      officers and designated representatives of the unions
      involved.  The President shall, at the same time, request
      any union that the Impartial Umpire has found to be in
      violation of this Article to inform the AFL-CIO within a
      specified time as to what steps it intends to take to comply
      with the determination.  The President shall notify the
      opposing union of any response received or the fact that no
      response has been received within the time specified.  If no
      appeal is filed within five days (excluding Saturdays,
      Sundays and holidays) of receipt of the Impartial Umpire_s
      determination, the determination shall go into full force
      and effect pursuant to Article XX, Section 12.</pre>

<title>8/7/96-Principles Regarding the Social Security System</title>
<meta name="GENERATOR" content="Microsoft FrontPage 1.1">
</head>
<body>
<h3 align="center">AFL-CIO Executive Council August 7, 1997
Statement </h3>
<p><strong>PRINCIPLES REGARDING THE SOCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM</strong> </p>
<p>The Social Security System is perhaps the federal government_s
most successful social policy achievement. In the 60 years since
its establishment, it has reliably and efficiently provided
income and health insurance benefits to the elderly and the
disabled, helped millions Americans escape poverty, and given the
elderly the financial means to live their last years with dignity
and independence. It has lived up to its promise, which President
Franklin D. Roosevelt expressed in signing the Social Security
Act into law in 1935, _...we can never insure one hundred percent
of the population against one hundred percent of the hazards and
vicissitudes of live, but we have tried to...give some measure of
protection to the average citizen and to his family against the
loss of a job and against a poverty-ridden old age._ </p>
<p>Today, the Social Security System faces several new
challenges. There are genuine -- but small -- long-term financing
problems with the system which must be addressed in order to
protect its solvency and its ability to provide the social
insurance benefits upon which millions of Americans depend. There
are also political threats from those who would discard Social
Security_s tremendously successful current structure, in favor of
privatized, federally-mandated individual savings accounts. The
proponents of privatization have used the system_s long-term
financing problems as a pretext for a wholesale dismantling of
the federal government_s most successful and popular social
program. </p>
<p>The AFL-CIO rejects all attempts to dismantle the Social
Security System and to exaggerate the extent of its long-term
financing problems. The AFL-CIO supports the Social Security
System_s benefit structure, which returns a higher share of
lowpaid workers_ earnings int he form of benefits, but which pays
higher benefits to those who have contributed more. </p>
<p>The AFL-CIO also supports the Social Security Systems current
highly efficient administrative structure: Administrative costs
are less than 0.7% of annual benefits, compared to administrative
costs at private insurance companies that are, on average, 40%
higher. </p>
<p>In developing a prudent response to the Social Security Trust
Fund_s long-term financing needs, the AFL-CIO will work to ensure
that all Americans will be able to continue to rely upon Social
Security, and will not be abandoned to the false promises of
today_s ideological privatizers. </p>
<p>The AFL-CIO will defend the Social Security System against the
disinformation campaign currently being waged by Wall Street
interests. We will work with allied organizations and individuals
to educate Americans on the importance of preserving the primary
source of retirement income security for average-wage earners. </p>
<p>We call on all unions to join in a coordinated campaign to
educate Americans on the true value of Social Security and to
discredit the false notion that private retirement accounts could
match Social Security benefits. Specifically, we call on unions
to include regular communication on Social Security in their
publications, use educational material being developed by allied
organizations to authenticate our message, and to encourage local
leadership and activists to speak out publicly in defense of
Social Security.</p>

<title>8/7/96-State Central Body Affiliation Fee Fund
Disbursement</title>
<meta name="GENERATOR" content="Microsoft FrontPage 1.1">
</head>
<body>
<h3 align="center">AFL-CIO Executive Council August 7, 1996,
Chicago Statement </h3>
<p><strong>STATE CENTRAL BODY AFFILIATION FEE</strong> <strong>FUND
DISBURSEMENT PROCEDURE</strong> </p>
<p>In 1991, the AFL-CIO Convention amended Article XV of the
AFLCIO Constitution to implement a new state federation
affiliation program designed to encourage international unions to
increase local union membership levels with state AFL-CIOs. In
February 1992, the AFL-CIO Executive Council by a two-thirds
vote, further amended Article XV to create a new Section 3
allowing the Executive Council to establish a target, state
central body affiliation level. Later the Executive Council
established a rate schedule beginning with a 40% national
aggregate affiliation rate in 1992 increasing by 2% per year to
50% by 1997. Under this format and in conformity with the
original constitutional amendment, those international unions
which were not participating in the National Affiliation Program
as established under Article XIII Section 2 (b) and which were
unable to achieve the yearly affiliation benchmark would be
required to pay a one cent, per member per month penalty per
capita tax payment into an AFL-CIO fund reserved to assist state
federations. This penalty per capita tax system was subsequently
initiated for calendar year 1995. </p>
<p>In the years since the adoption of this program, international
union affiliation rates with state federations have modestly
improved. In calendar year 1995, 48 unions achieved the targeted
aggregate affiliation rate of 44% while 31 international unions
fell short. </p>
<p>As a result of the application of the one cent per capita
penalty to these 31 internationals unions, a substantial fund has
accumulated since last year. The next step in the process to
fully implement this affiliation program is to finalize a
disbursement schedule which would allocate the fund contributions
to the state federations in a fair and equitable manner. </p>
<p>To do this, the Executive Council directs that: </p>
<p>Expenditures of the funds shall be based on a sliding scale
formula under which all states receive a disbursement with a
larger proportional share allocated to medium and small size
state federations; </p>
<p>Such a formula shall recognize the resource needs of the
smaller state AFL-CIOs as well as the generally lower union
membership base within their jurisdictions from which new
affiliations can be derived and; </p>
<p>Up to 10% of the fund may be reserved for expenditure as
discretionary grants of no more than $5,000 per state based on
proposals submitted by state federations for such program needs
as affiliation initiatives, technological enhancements,
grassroots development and other appropriate projects. </p>
<p>The amount of direct disbursement to state federations
allocated under the sliding scale formula may be adjusted
annually by the Secretary-Treasurer based on the yearly income
derived from the penalty per capita tax paid by international
unions. In addition, the Secretary-Treasurer shall annually fix
the percentage of the fund reserved for grants subject to the 10%
cap. The Secretary-Treasurer shall also have final approval
regarding the grants submitted by state federations selected by
the AFL-CIO for program funding.</p>

<title>Exec. Council Statement on Chinese-Made Goods</title>
<meta name="GENERATOR" content="Microsoft FrontPage 1.1">
</head>
<body>
<h2>AFL-CIO Executive Council<br>
May 8, 1996<br>
Statement</h2>
<h1 align="center">Boycott Chinese-Made Goods</h1>
<p>Despite increased international attention and pressure, the
Chinese government has steadfastly refused to end the ongoing and
serious violations of human and trade union rights in China. </p>
<p>The AFL-CIO has consistently urged the government of the
United States to realize the inadequacy of its policy of
engagement with China. American corporations are mounting a
massive campaign to once again grant China the same trading
status as our most favored trading partners. These companies, and
other multinational corporations, do not care about human rights
abuses or prison labor. They make millions of dollars by
exporting goods from the protected Chinese market to the U.S.
using the cheapest and most exploitive labor -- resulting in
record U.S. trade deficits. </p>
<p>We oppose extending MFN to China. We urge the Congress to
recognize the need to send a strong message to the Chinese
government by rejecting MFN extension. </p>
<p>We note the valiant efforts of the Tibetan people to bring
attention to the ongoing suppression of Tibet by the Chinese
government. We support a call for a boycott of all Chinese-made
goods during the month of June -- as a concrete statement of our
support for human rights in China, and our call for American
corporations to insist on a minimum standard of decency for
workers in China.</p>

<title>Exec. Council Statement on the 1996 Olympic Games</title>
<meta name="GENERATOR" content="Microsoft FrontPage 1.1">
</head>
<body>
<h2>AFL-CIO Executive Council<br>
May 1996<br>
Statement</h2>
<h1 align="center">1996 Olympic Games</h1>
<p>The Olympic Games in the past have represented the highest
ideals of fair play and honorable competition. It is most
unfortunate that the agency managing the 1996 Summer Olympics,
The Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games (ACOG), may tarnish
this long-standing tradition in at least one instance. While many
of the issues raised by the labor movement, working through the
Atlanta Labor Council, have been addressed, the insistence of
ACOG in classifying Broadcast Technicians as &quot;independent
contractors&quot; is a gross misuse of the classification at the
expense of the working men and women of America. In addition ACOG
is attempting to import technical workers from foreign countries.
We do not believe ACOG has made a legitimate attempt to secure
enough personnel in this country and until they do, their request
should be denied. We support the efforts of the IBEW to resolve
this matter.</p>

<h2>AFL-CIO Executive Council<br>
May 9, 1996<br>
Statement</h2>
<h1 align="center">Sexual Harassment</h1>
<p align="center"><em>The AFL-CIO reaffirms its condemnation of
sexual harassment as an illegal violation of human dignity.</em> </p>
<p>The number of sexual harassment claims filed with the Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) in 1993 was more than
double the number filed in 1990. Ninety percent of harassment
cases involved men harassing women, nine percent involve same sex
harassment and one percent involve women harassing men. Surveys
show that a large portion of working women have been sexually
harassed at work, with figures ranging from 40 percent to 65
percent. The AFL-CIO must continue to work to prevent harassment
and other forms of sex discrimination through education,
enforcement of strong policies and state and federal laws and by
fostering an environment that supports working women.</p>

<title>In Memory of Vice President J.C. Turner</title>
<meta name="GENERATOR" content="Microsoft FrontPage 1.1">
</head>
<body>
<h2>AFL-CIO Executive Council<br>
May 9, 1996<br>
Statement</h2>
<h1 align="center">In Memory of Vice President J.C. Turner</h1>
<p>The Executive Council of the American Federation of Labor and
Congress of Industrial Organizations mourns the death of our
friend and brother, Vice President Emeritus J.C. Turner after a
lifetime of his devoted service to the goals of the labor
movement and the well-being of working people around the world.</p>
<p>The son of an ironworker, he joined Local 77 of the
International Union of Operating Engineers at 18. Through his
hard work and dedication as an organizer and business manager, he
rose through the ranks of his local union and he was called to
serve his national union as a vice president, director of
legislation and as general secretary-treasurer. He was elected
IUOE general president in 1975 and was subsequently elected to
this Council, which benefited from his experience, judgment and
good counsel for ten years.</p>
<p>Throughout his career, Brother Turner was an advocate of the
important contribution that the state federations and local
central labor councils make to the labor movement as the voice of
working families in the daily life and democratic processes of
their communities. With the same diligence that he brought to his
work in his union, Brother Turner served as an officer of the
Maryland/DC AFL-CIO, and, for 16 years, as the president of the
Metropolitan Washington DC Labor Council, becoming one of that
city's best known and most respected civic leaders.</p>
<p>Anywhere that worker's interests could be served, Brother
Turner brought his energy and talents to bear. From his service
as a delegate to the International Labor Organization, to serving
as a member of the D.C. City Council, from the National Urban
League's board of trustees to the board of governors of United
Way, J.C. Turner was a strong and outspoken fighter for social
and economic justice, equality and dignity in the workplace and
in the community.</p>
<p>We join with the men and women of the International Union of
Operating engineers in remembering and celebrating the life and
achievements of Brother J.C. Turner with deepest respect and
gratitude, and we order that this memorial be spread upon the
permanent records of the American Federation of Labor and
Congress of Industrial Organizations.</p>

<title>2/21-Informing and Involving Union Members and...</title>
<meta name="GENERATOR" content="Microsoft FrontPage 1.1">
</head>
<body>
<h2 align="left">AFL-CIO Executive Council<br>
February 21, 1996<br>
Statement</h2>
<h3 align="center">Informing and Involving Union Members in
National Legislative Debates </h3>
<p><b>Background</b> </p>
<p>After the 1994 election, the federation and many unions went
back to the rank and file membership -- through meetings, polls,
focus groups and other forms of inquiry -- to reexamine the
connections working people make between their concerns as workers
and family members and their participation in elections. </p>
<p>What became evident was a profound cynicism about federal
legislators and politicians -- and enormous anger at a political
system that workers feel has failed them. We found through poll
and focus group research that working people see virtually no
connection between their daily concerns and federal legislation
and politics. There was essentially no understanding of what
working people had at stake in the 1994 election and what
consequence voting their frustrations and anger could have on
their daily lives. </p>
<p>With the new radically conservative Republican majorities now
in the U.S. House and Senate, the AFL-CIO and its unions must
reconnect with union members in order to repulse the most severe
threat to the interests of working people than any in the past
fifty years. </p>
<h4>Grassroots Legislative Activism</h4>
<p>Since the 1994 elections, the federation and its unions have
made substantial efforts to understand how workers think about
their economic and family situations and how best to rebuild the
connections between those concerns and the consequences of
federal legislation and politics. </p>
<p>Enormous energy has been devoted to working with local union
leaders and members to make them aware that the programs they
have told their unions are important to working Americans are
being seriously threatened by the legislative agenda of the
Republican congress. </p>
<p>Our approach to encouraging grassroots activism has been to
provide information to working families and to ask them to act on
that information by engaging their member of congress as well as
by informing other working families in their communities. </p>
<p>Over 140 meetings between groups of local union members and
members of congress were held last year -- more than in any
previous year. These meetings were attended by over 2,400
unionists from 62 unions. These meetings serve the dual purpose
of lobbying the member of congress and educating union members
about the quality of their congressional representation. </p>
<p>During five congressional recesses, a number of congressional
districts were targeted for intensive grassroots lobbying
activities. Full-time staff from the federation and national
unions were assigned to assist local Central Labor Councils in
organizing local unions and their members around federal
legislative issues of concern to them. These intensive efforts
included a wide range of activities such as attending
representatives' town meetings, holding press conferences,
meeting with the representative, holding demonstrations,
leafleting worksites, circulating petitions and urging unionists
to call their member of congress. </p>
<p>A toll-free 800 number set up to facilitate calls to members
of congress about legislative issues logged in over 500,000
calls. Over 2 million pieces of informational mail were sent into
union homes. </p>
<p>Paid media and free publicity were significant components of
grassroots legislative activity. TV and radio ads were aired in
congressional districts where a full-time organizer was working
with local unionists on a range of legislative activities. The
ads were aimed at educating and energizing workers around issues
of concern to them as much as at influencing the vote of the
member in the targeted district. </p>
<p>While the 1995 activities represented an enormous step forward
from previous years, we understand there is a lot of work to be
done. Federal legislative issues seem very remote to many
members. A great deal of support needs to be provided by national
unions to the local level to create sufficient awareness and
sense of urgency to boost local activity. </p>
<p>In 1996, legislative grassroots activity should build on the
accomplishments of 1995. Our aim this year is to broaden local
bases of informed and involved workers, to train members in
grassroots legislative activities, and to do more longer-range
planning for local legislative activities. We will continue to
use our research findings to determine how best to engage members
on federal legislative issues. </p>
<p>The political activism of 1996 will be carried out in a manner
that leads to greater legislative activism after the election.
Working men and women will work hard to elect people who are
sympathetic to the concerns of workers, but they then must
continue their involvement to monitor and hold accountable these
members as they make legislative decisions. </p>
<h4>Legislative Agenda</h4>
<p>The issues working men and women cared about and worked on
intensively in 1995 are still on the congressional agenda in
1996. We will continue to defend Medicare beneficiaries from cost
increases, Medicaid beneficiaries from the loss of their
guaranteed coverage, children of working families from loss of
access to education, and workers from the loss of their wage and
workplace standards protections. It is particularly offensive
that the cuts in these programs are being proposed to funds tax
cuts for the wealthy and corporations. </p>
<p>At a time when workers are anxious about their economic
security and corporations are making record profits, we will urge
the Congress to look hard at the extensive corporate tax breaks
and subsidies for any revenues that are needed for worthwhile
national purposes. </p>
<p>The recent National Governors' Association (NGA) proposals
regarding Medicaid and welfare reform threaten to undermine both
programs in order to reduce costs to the States. The Medicaid
proposal aims to end any meaningful entitlement as well as
undercut medical facilities which serve disproportionately poor
populations and the disabled. The welfare reform proposal leaves
families without security and, because there are no adequate
anti-displacement provisions, threaten existing workers' jobs. We
oppose the NGA proposals and urge the President and the Congress
to oppose them as well. </p>
<p>The threats to jobs and wages are multiple in the current
congress. There are proposals to repeal Davis-Bacon, the Services
Contracts Act and even the minimum wage. The 40-hour work week is
under attack. There are bills to eviscerate OSHA. Collective
bargaining is under attack both through broad efforts, such as
the bills to establish company unions, and through targeted
attacks, such as those against mass transit workers and FAA
employees, including air traffic controllers. Careless policies,
like the effort to deregulate the electric utility industry, can
cause massive job losses. Most recently a preliminary report for
the U.S. Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations
recommended wholesale exemption of state and local employees from
the application of FLSA, FMLA, OSHA, and wage standard acts. All
of these efforts should be repulsed, and we will work diligently
to defeat them. </p>
<p>As well, some States are trying to reduce their costs at the
expense of working people. States -- through corporate welfare
and cuts in Medicaid and other safety net programs -- are engaged
in a &quot;race to the bottom,&quot; at the expense of working
families. Proposition 187, adopted in California in 1994, was a
cruel attempt to cut state costs at the expense of immigrants;
this effort was enjoined by the courts. The AFL-CIO condemned
this initiative and, more recently, condemns and will oppose
similar efforts now underway in Florida for a 1996 ballot
initiative to cut of public services to immigrants.</p>

<pre>                                        AFL-CIO Executive Council
                                                February 19, 1996
                                                        Statement
</pre>
<h3 align="center">America Needs A Raise </h3>
<p>America needs a raise, in the worst kind of way. While
productivity, profits, executive pay and the stock market keep
going up, working family incomes keep going down, widening the
gap between the rich and the rest of us and creating a dangerous
atmosphere of social and economic conflict. </p>
<p>Since 1979, real earnings for workers have declined 12
percent. During that same period, 97 percent of the increase in
household incomes has gone to the richest 20 percent of all
households, with middle income families and the poor left to
scramble over the remaining three percent. </p>
<p>During the same period, productivity went up 24 percent and
American workers should have been able to enjoy a substantial
increase in buying power. Instead, the productivity was converted
into increases in corporate profits (64 percent between 1989 and
1995) and in executive compensation (up 360 percent since 1980). </p>
<p>The result is an alarming maldistribution of wealth. The top
20 percent of households in our country now get half of the
nation's total income and control 85 percent of all wealth. The
rest -- 80 percent of all households -- split the other half of
total income and share 15 percent of the nation's wealth, mainly
our mortgaged homes. </p>
<p>Workers are having to labor harder and longer just to keep
even, and more and more family members are having to work in
order to maintain living standards. Working families have little
money to spend, they are loaded with debt and they have no time
to spend with their children. Threatened by restructuring,
downsizing, pension raids, privatization schemes and runaway
plants, their anger is exceeded only by anxiety over keeping
their jobs. They are disgusted with business and government and
their disillusionment is straining the fabric of our society. </p>
<p>More than 12 million workers at the bottom of the wage
structure have lost hope altogether, victims of a federal minimum
wage that in real terms is now 25 percent below its 1981 level. </p>
<p>With workers and their families hurting as never before, the
labor movement must respond as never before. We must create a new
and powerful voice for America's working families. Then we must
use that voice powerfully and persuasively to restore respect for
workers and the work we do through increased wages, more secure
jobs, affordable healthcare and improved retirement income. </p>
<p>The AFL-CIO will respond first by sponsoring a series of <a
href="ecraise.html">town hall meetings</a> across the country
where workers can speak out publicly about their lives and their
jobs and offer guidance toward solutions. </p>
<p>We will use these forums to transform individual concerns into
a compelling national cause, sensitizing politicians and
policy-makers as we mount a massive educational campaign to
motivate unrepresented as well as represented workers. </p>
<p>Working with our allies and supporters, we'll take what we've
learned and raise the issue of income inequality to a new level,
using &quot;America Needs a Raise&quot; to: </p>
<ul>
    <li>Build a powerful grassroots movement against cuts in
        federal, state and local programs working families depend
        upon and to push for a quick, big increase in the federal
        minimum wage; </li>
    <li>Create a strategic campaign center to give maximum
        support to 16 million workers and their unions as they
        attempt to pry long-overdue compensation increases from
        the tightened fists of multi-billion-dollar corporate
        giants; </li>
    <li>Persuade employers to practice corporate responsibility
        for their employees and the communities they serve as
        well as for their stockholders and executives; </li>
    <li>Energize a nationwide organizing campaign to bring union
        wages and benefits to millions of workers who need and
        deserve them. </li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, we will use &quot;America Needs a Raise&quot; to
evaluate the political candidates who want our support this fall
and to help them campaign aggressively on this most basic concern
of working families. </p>
<p>We will seek out and support candidates who pledge themselves
to: </p>
<ul>
    <li>Restore respect for workers and just rewards for work; </li>
    <li>Defend programs working families depend on, from Medicare
        and Medicaid, to education, college loans and
        environmental protections; </li>
    <li>Stop tax giveaways to big business and reverse job-
        destroying trade policies that benefit only multinational
        corporations; </li>
    <li>Preserve worker health and safety protections, as well as
        wage standards guaranteed by Davis-Bacon and the Service
        Contract Act; </li>
    <li>Fight to raise the minimum wage and to guarantee
        affordable, high-quality health care for everyone; </li>
    <li>Stand up for policies that protect the rights of workers
        to freely organize and join unions; </li>
    <li>Insist on job-creating low-interest rate policies instead
        of job-destroying high-interest rate policies from the
        Federal Reserve. </li>
</ul>
<p>&quot;America Needs a Raise.&quot; And through a reinvigorated
labor movement, the AFL-CIO accepts the responsibility for
delivering it.</p>

</pre>
<h3 align="center">Reclaim America </h3>
<p>To be fully effective, the Labor Movementts tReclaim Americat
program will need the support, commitment, and active
participation of all AFL-CIO unions. Our members must see this
program to be their program. They must be involved in the
planning and implementation of this program from the outset. </p>
<p>In order to ensure that all federation unions and union
leaders have a full voice in determining the scope and direction
of this program, as well as the resources that must be devoted to
this effort, we will call a Special Convention next month in
accordance with Article IV, section 3 of the AFL-CIO
Constitution. </p>
<p>The purpose of the Special Convention will be three-fold: to
inform and educate the delegates as to the nature of this program
and the reasons why it is so important; to approve, through a
vote of the delegates a special assessment of 15 cents per member
per month, for the twelve month period beginning in May t96, in
order to help subsidize the many activities that will be
conducted as part of this program; and to consider the question
of the Federationts endorsement of the re-election of Bill
Clinton and Al Gore for President and Vice President of the
United States.</p>

                                                February 21, 1996
                                                        Statement
</pre>
<h3 align="center">Special Convention </h3>
<p>The intensity of the assault on working families following the
1994 Congressional election was harsher than expected. The
Republican extremists had a message that captured the imagination
of American voters, including nearly 40% our members. </p>
<p>But the electorate in 1994 didn't vote for the program the
radical Republican Congressional leadership had in mind for them
-- slashing Medicare funding, cutting Medicaid and then giving it
to the states with no guarantees and few standards, cutting
funding for education and college loans, weakening environmental
and worksite health and safety protections, and attacking all
other programs for working families. </p>
<p>The AFL-CIO staved off the assault by informing our members
and the public about the details of the Republican Contract --
details hidden by their rhetoric. We communicated with workers
and their families, mobilized them to resist, and began the
process of forming a national grassroots network to carry their
voice into the national political debate. </p>
<p>We have hit the nerve center of the Gingrich extremists. As a
result of the victory in Oregon and the grassroots legislative
and political plan we've begun, the National Republican
Congressional Committee and the National Republican Senatorial
Committee have filed FEC complaints against us. Their cronies at
the Heritage Foundation published a &quot;study&quot; in an
attempt to limit the ability of unions to engage members in
legislative and political battles. And the Wall Street Journal
accused us of &quot;Ruining Politics&quot;. </p>
<p>The AFL-CIO wears these specious charges as a badge of honor
and we take them as an incentive to continue to win and engage
and empower our members and workers in America. We intend to
organize grassroots action committees of at least 100 activists
in every Congressional district in this country. We will commit
every resource at our disposal to register voters, educate and
inform our members as well as the general public. And we will
rally our efforts to turn out massive numbers of voters in local,
state and federal elections this fall as we reclaim America. </p>
<p>To get this job done the labor movement must mount an effort
of unprecedented scale, with every union doing its share by
contributing ideas, money, staff, media and materials. </p>
<p>While implementation of our plan will benefit candidates who
stand with working families, that is not our primary goal.
Rather, we will rebuild a base of working people who will hold
elected officials, regardless of party, accountable and inject
workers' rights and values into our national debate --- this year
and next year and the next.</p>

</pre>
<h3 align="center">AFL-CIO Organizing Fund Guidelines for
Assistance and Support </h3>
<p>The AFL-CIO Organizing Fund is intended to increase the size
and impact of organizing among national and international unions.
Program support from the Organizing Department will complement
and bolster the organizing activities designated for assistance. </p>
<p>Assistance will be targeted at organizing programs with the
greatest strategic importance and with the greatest likelihood of
success by focusing on specific companies, industries or
geographic areas of strategic importance to the labor movement
and with clear growth potential. Priority will be given to large
multi-union campaigns that aim to build power in an industry
nationally or regionally. </p>
<p>Assistance will be used to stimulate and support organizing at
a scale otherwise not possible. Priority will be given to
proposals that represent additional spending by unions rather
than a substitution of AFL-CIO expenditures for union
expenditures. The highest possible level of matching union
contributions to AFL-CIO contributions should be achieved, with a
goal of unions matching AFL-CIO spending by four to one. </p>
<p>Unions that receive assistance must be willing to share
information, techniques, and results with other unions and the
AFL-CIO. Applications for assistance will be confidential and
there will be no publicity unless it is consistent with the
campaign plan. </p>
<p>Campaigns receiving support will be overseen by the Organizing
Department, and led by a Campaign Director mutually agreed upon
by the AFL-CIO and participating unions. For each supported
campaign, the Department will create a steering committee
consisting of the Campaign Director, a representative of the
AFL-CIO Organizing Department, and a designee from each union,
with written understandings of each organization's
responsibilities. </p>
<p>The AFL-CIO Organizing Department will work with unions that
request assistance to develop campaign proposals that meet the
guidelines for support. </p>
<h4>Application Guidelines</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Applications for assistance should be directed to the
        President of the AFL-CIO. </li>
    <li>Each application for funding must include a strategic
        plan to build sufficient leverage to win recognition and
        a contract from employers that changes the balance of
        power in the region or industry. The strategic plan
        should include: 
        <ol>
            <li>A plan to mobilize existing members to strengthen
                the campaign, bring pressure on the employer,
                give public visibility to the cause, and tie the
                organizing effort into bargaining; </li>
            <li>A commitment to contribute the union's best
                organizing staff to the campaign; </li>
            <li>A description of how the campaign can be used for
                recruitment and training of new organizing
                talent, preferably developed with the assistance
                of the Organizing Institute. </li>
            <li>Each application for funding should include a
                detailed budget that indicates the commitment by
                the participating unions. </li>
            <li>Each application should provide a description of
                the staff structure of the campaign. Where more
                than one union is participating there should be a
                unified command structure. </li>
            <li>In order to put the proposal for assistance in
                the context of the union's overall organizing
                program each application for assistance should
                include background on the participating unions'
                organizing programs, the current organizing
                budgets, and the results of the most recent
                year's campaigns.

                                                        February 20, 1996
                                                                Statement
</pre>
<h3 align="center">Building Power for Workers By Organizing </h3>
<p>The crisis of a declining union movement is the crisis of
workers in America. All working families have been affected. The
middle class is in free fall. Economic anxiety is pervasive.
Average hourly wages have been dropping since 1973 and real
family income is lower than it was twenty years ago. </p>
<p>For low wage workers, women and people of color, the news has
been even worse. And the gap between rich and poor is growing. </p>
<p>Our loss has meant gains for employers: </p>
<ul>
    <li>For the first time since the Depression increased worker
        productivity has not been followed by a rise in incomes. </li>
    <li>Corporate profits are at a forty-five year high. </li>
    <li>Wealth is more concentrated at the top than at any time
        in the last 25 years. </li>
    <li>Temporary and part-time work at low wages without
        benefits now accounts for most of the job growth in our
        economy. </li>
</ul>
<p>Elections of the last decade have delivered political
leadership with a non-union vision for Americats future. Gains
won by a more powerful labor movement, like minimum wage, health
and safety projections, even Social Security are greatly eroded
or in jeopardy. </p>
<p>There are many reasons for the decline in union membership.
Federal labor law has failed to protect workers' rights to
organize unions and bargain collectively with their employers.
Most workers seeking to gain power by organizing must run a
gauntlet of fear created by employer anti-union campaigns. </p>
<p>Other forces have also eaten away at the organized base: </p>
<ul>
    <li>Many unionized companies have moved overseas in search of
        low-wage workers or pared their work forces by
        contracting out jobs or using temporary employees. </li>
    <li>New technologies have eliminated jobs in basic industry;
        new industries with unorganized work forces have emerged. </li>
    <li>Government at every level has responded to cost pressures
        by replacing decent union jobs with lower wage and
        benefit &quot;privatized&quot; jobs. </li>
</ul>
<p>This has only encouraged assaults by increasingly greedy and
control-driven employers. Union members have held onto more gains
than working families overall, but the incentive to attack has
been increased as the cost gap between union work and nonunion
work has widened to more than 20%. </p>
<p>We cannot simply hold on to what we have. Organized labor will
be bigger or smaller. The decision rests with us. </p>
<p>Unless a broad, serious effort is launched to dramatically
increase resources to re-establish power in the labor market,
workerst power will continue to erode. </p>
<p>In recognition of these challenges, the Federation should work
closely with the unions to rebuild the labor movement by: </p>
<ul>
    <li>Providing leadership, coordination and support for a
        movement-wide effort to return unions to a dominant role
        in improving the lives of Americans; </li>
    <li>Promoting efforts to refocus unions at all levels on
        organizing and dramatically increase spending on
        organizing; </li>
    <li>Helping develop the internal capacity of unions to
        increase the scale of organizing and membership education
        programs about the necessity to organize; </li>
    <li>Assisting in the development of strategic plans and
        leverage strategies; </li>
    <li>Assisting in recruiting and training a new generation of
        organizers; </li>
    <li>Promoting and coordinating the integration of political,
        legislative and legal activity, bargaining strategies,
        and corporate strategies to increase unions' ability to
        organize, and; </li>
    <li>Raising the visibility and public profile of unions as
        the vehicle for improving the jobs, working conditions
        and lives of American families. </li>
    <li>Expansion of bargaining unit strength by increasing
        membership levels in existing units and by using
        bargaining leverage to create organizing opportunities,
        including neutrality and card check provisions. </li>
</ul>
<p>To accomplish these goals the Federation should, through its
organizing program; encourage and assist unions to increase
spending on organizing at all levels; encourage and assist unions
in developing and winning large scale organizing campaigns;
encourage and assist unions in organizing that seeks to represent
entire industries or geographic areas; and advance and develop
the skills and capabilities of the organizing programs of union
internationals and locals. </p>
<p>Therefore the organizing program of the AFL-CIO should focus
on these areas: </p>
<ul>
    <li>Increasing resources to organizing and targeting efforts
        to increase the labor movement's capacity to recruit and
        train organizers. </li>
    <li>Working with unions to develop a consensus among local
        and regional leaders, as well as members, for the
        necessity to spend more on organizing at all levels and
        to address the consequences of that decision within their
        unions. </li>
    <li>Offering strategic campaign assistance to unions in the
        development and execution of expanded organizing
        campaigns. </li>
</ul>
<h4>Program Description</h4>
<p>The department program will seek to fulfill these objectives
by implementing these three programs: </p>
<p>Organizing Institute: Efforts to recruit and train organizers
will involve recruitment of rank and file union members and
direct recruitment of young people on college campuses. The
institutets field training program will directly assist unions in
running large campaigns by providing field training interns and
apprentices and experienced field trainers to assist in
campaigns. The Organizing Institute will also seek to develop on
an experimental basis new models of recruitment and training such
as Union Summer '96. </p>
<p>Restructuring to Organize: This program will expand on its
initial work with local and regional elected leaders wishing to
refocus and restructure their unions to do more organizing and do
it more successfully. By providing forums where elected leaders
can discuss the needs and problems of changing their institution
to dramatically increase organizing spending and success with
their peers, the program has provided a unique opportunity to
&quot;take stock&quot; and rethink both the needs and directions
of their unions. Success will be measured by increases in
spending and organizing victories. </p>
<p>Strategic Campaign Assistance: The Federation will encourage
and assist new organizing that can make a significant
contribution to the expansion and development of organizing
programs. Innovative organizing approaches will be encouraged.
Recognizing that the Federation has only one percent of the
resources of the labor movement, assistance provided by the
AFLCIO will encourage and reward expanded commitment and spending
by unions and their regions and locals. A new Organizing Fund
will provide a range of support and assistance, strategically
applied.</p>

<pre>                                                AFL-CIO Executive Council
                                                        February 21, 1996
                                                                Statement
</pre>
<h3 align="center">The Federal Reserve </h3>
<p>The Federal Reserve Board plays a major role in determining
economic policy for the U.S. For working men and women, its
decisions spell the difference between a job and unemployment, or
between long overdue wage increases and continuing wage decline. </p>
<p>Fifty years ago Congress enacted the Employment Act of 1946,
which declares it to be the policy as well as the responsibility
of the federal government &quot;to use all practicable means ...
to promote maximum employment, production and purchasing
power.&quot; For five decades that law -- buttressed in 1978 by
the HumphreyHawkins Full Employment Act -- has stood as an
unfulfilled commitment to Americats working families. Worse, the
Fed has acted as if a reduction in unemployment below six percent
is a major threat to inflation and the economy. Now Senator
Connie Mack (R-FL) has introduced a bill to strip out the federal
government's responsibility to promote full employment and the
Federal Reserve's responsibility for anything other than price
stability. </p>
<p>The chairman of the Fed, Alan Greenspan, has led an
unjustified assault on the Bureau of Labor Statisticst
calculation of the rate of inflation through the Consumer Price
Index (CPI). The principal point of that assault is to undermine
the security of millions of retirees and other Social Security
recipients who depend on the CPI for indexation of their
benefits. If this effort succeeds, working men and women will
suffer as well; a reduced CPI will lead many employers to further
restrict wage increases while triggering a back-door tax increase
for the American people. </p>
<p>President Clinton's decisions about whom to appoint as chair,
vice chair and member of the Board of Governors of the Fed are
among the most important economic policy decisions he makes. But
Republicans in the Senate have begun to undermine the nomination
process for the Fed through their attacks on Felix Rohatyn
because of his pro-growth policies, leading Mr. Rohatyn to
request that his name not be submitted for the Fed. </p>
<p>As the nation marks the 50th anniversary of the Employment Act
of 1946, the AFL-CIO urges President Clinton to appoint men and
women as Fed chair, vice chair and member of the Board of
Governors who believe the Federal Reserve should promote full
employment and economic growth as well as price stability.
President Clinton is to be commended for recommending someone
like Felix Rohatyn who reflects these standards. Mr. Greenspan
does not meet these criteria.</p>

                                                                Statement
</pre>
<h3 align="center">RUGMARK Campaign </h3>
<p>Virtually every country in the world has laws prohibiting
child labor exploitation, as does the United States, yet billions
of dollars worth of products made by exploiting children are sold
to unknowing customers in the United States each year. </p>
<p>The use of child labor deprives children of their health,
education, and in many cases their very lives. The countries that
rely on, or even permit child labor are not investing in their
nationts future. They are propelling the economic race to the
bottom in labor standards and worker protections for the world. </p>
<p>The hand-knotted carpet industry, in particular, is rife with
insidious forms of child labor, with bonded children as young as
five and six years old often enslaved to pay off the debts of
their parents. The RUGMARK campaign, which is being sponsored by
the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions, will
address the abuses in this industry by expanding consumer
awareness and action. It will be a consumer-driven campaign which
identifies -- through a special RUGMARK label -- hand-knotted
carpets made without child labor. </p>
<p>The AFL-CIO supports the RUGMARK consumer education and
purchasing campaign as one way of helping prohibit exploitative
child labor.</p>

                                                        February 21, 1996
                                                                Statement
</pre>
<h3 align="center">Nigeria </h3>
<p>Despite increasing international criticism and isolation, the
renegade regime of General Sani Abacha continues on a course of
widespread violation of the most basic rights of Nigerian
citizens. Violence and illegal arrests continue, much of which
has been targeted against the countryts trade unions and their
leaders. Among those under detention is Brother Frank Kokori,
general secretary of the National Union of Petroleum and Natural
Gas Workers (NUPENG), arrested July 4, 1994, who remains in
prison without charge. Milton Dabibi, general secretary of the
Nigerian oil and gas workerst union PENGASSAN, was arrested last
month and is also being held without charge. </p>
<p>The AFL-CIO, in solidarity with Nigeriats independent trade
unions, believes that more effective and forceful measures are
urgently needed to force the Abacha regime to stop the violence
and torture, restore civil liberties including an end to
arbitrary arrests, and immediately release all political
prisoners. </p>
<p>Specifically, the AFL-CIO joins others in calling for a
complete embargo of Nigerian exports, sanctions on those
organizations and nations that refuse to honor the embargo, and
an embargo on shipment of equipment and replacement parts to
Nigeria. In addition, foreign bank accounts of Nigeriats ruling
generals must be frozen and their stolen millions preserved for
the Nigerian people. Ninety percent of Nigeriats foreign revenue
comes from oil exports with nearly fifty percent of this oil
exported to the United States. For our part, the AFL-CIO will
continue to do everything in its power to support Nigeriats
besieged independent trade unions and to pressure U.S. oil
companies to admit their culpability by ceasing their support of
the Nigerian military regime which violently abuses human and
worker rights to degrade the environment and make massive profits
from the blood of its citizens.</p>

<pre>                                        AFL-CIO Executive Council
                                                February 21, 1996
                                                        Statement
</pre>
<h3 align="center">International Trade </h3>
<p>The 1995 deficit in goods is setting a new record. That
deficit demonstrates the failure of government trade policy with
its adverse impact on the jobs and incomes of American workers. </p>
<h4>Enforcement of Trade Agreements</h4>
<p>The U. S. Trade Representative's office has set up a permanent
unit at USTR devoted exclusively to monitoring all U.S. trade
agreements and implementing U.S. trade laws and pushing for
compliance by foreign governments. Diligent monitoring and
aggressive enforcement of all U.S. trade agreements by USTR are
critical steps in the right direction. </p>
<h4>Worker Rights and Trade</h4>
<p>History tells us that trade unions through collective
bargaining and government through adequately enforced labor laws
are necessary to insure that increased trade really does lead to
higher standards of living for all workers. To bring reality to
the concept of internationally-recognized worker rights, a
variety of policies should be pursued. </p>
<p>Worker rights must be made a principal trade negotiating
objective of the United States, and this country must insist in
all trade negotiations that worker rights provisions are
necessary if agreements are to be reached. Those provisions must
include the prohibition of forced labor, guarantees on freedom of
association and the right to organize and bargain collectively,
as well as nondiscrimination in employment. Rules should also be
established to insure a safe and healthy workplace, prevent child
labor, and establish appropriate standards concerning hours of
work. </p>
<p>The Administration must redouble its efforts to make worker
rights part of the World Trade Organization program of work. We
therefore call on the Administration to reiterate its commitment
toward creating a working party on International Labor Standards
at the Ministerial meeting in Singapore later this year. </p>
<p>While workers are affected by the full range of issues
addressed by the proposed Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA),
the AFL-CIO believes that it is most important for the second
Western Hemisphere Trade Ministerial, to held in Cartagena,
Columbia on March 21, 1996, to place worker rights and labor
standards at the heart of the FTAA process. Economic integration
must go beyond a narrow focus on business interests and directly
address the needs and aspirations of workers throughout the
Hemisphere. </p>
<p>To this end, the U.S. government should insist that any
ministerial declaration affirm that respect for and strengthening
of worker rights and labor standards are essential to the success
of Hemispheric economic integration and that such rights and
standards must be considered and included in any negotiations. It
is particularly important for the Declaration to establish a
formal inter-government working group on this question to examine
the ways and means for incorporating basic rights and standards
in the FTAA. </p>
<p>The Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Osaka Ministerial
last year produced an Action Agenda to serve as the blue print to
achieve free trade in the Asia-Pacific region. Part two of the
agenda defines work to be undertaken collectively by working
groups in 10 areas, including human resource development.
Unfortunately, the APEC list of priority items to address human
resource needs does not mention internationally recognized worker
rights. The AFL-CIO recommends that the action agenda of the
upcoming ministerial in Manila include a commitment by APEC
countries to promote and recognize worker rights. </p>
<p>The Administration must fully utilize the worker rights
provisions present in existing law, including Section 301 of the
1988 Trade Act, the Generalized System of Preferences, the
Overseas Private Investment Corporation, the Caribbean Basin
Initiative, and requirements that worker rights be supported in
the operations of the international financial institutions. </p>
<h4>MFN Status for China</h4>
<p>The Executive Order outlining conditions for renewal of U.S.
most-favored-nation (MFN) trading status for China in 1994
explicitly stated that the trading privileges would not be
renewed unless the Secretary of State could determine that
&quot;extension (of MFN) will substantially promote the freedom
of emigration objectives of section 402 of the (1974 Trade) Act;
and China is complying with the 1992 bilateral agreement between
the United States and China concerning prison labor.&quot;
Furthermore, China was to have made &quot;significant progress
with respect to the following: </p>
<ol>
    <li>Taking steps to begin adhering to the Universal
        Declaration of Human Rights; </li>
    <li>Releasing and providing an acceptable accounting for
        Chinese citizens imprisoned or detained for the
        nonviolent expression of their political and religious
        beliefs, including such expression of beliefs in
        connection with the Democracy Wall and Tiananmen Square
        movements; </li>
    <li>Ensuring humane treatment of prisoners, such as by
        allowing access to prisons by international humanitarian
        and human rights organizations; </li>
    <li>Protecting Tibet's distinctive religious and cultural
        heritage; </li>
    <li>Permitting international radio and television broadcasts
        into China.&quot; </li>
</ol>
<p>Despite the fact that these conditions were not met, the
Administration decided to renew the MFN status in May, 1995. The
U.S. trade deficit will total $35 billion in 1995, second only to
Japan. </p>
<p>The AFL-CIO calls upon the Administration and the Congress not
to renew most-favored-nation status for China. The United States
should no longer support the Chinese government's repression of
its own citizens. </p>
<p>The AFL-CIO supports the efforts of the Administration to deny
China World Trade Organization membership until it meets
appropriate trade and human rights standards.</p>

                                                        February 21, 1996
                                                                Statement

</pre>
<h3 align="center">The Stability of the Electric Utility Industry </h3>
<p>There continues to be a rapid move toward legislatively
mandated deregulation of the electric utility industry. This
trend, combined with emerging international environmental
commitments related to global climate change, threaten the
hundreds of thousands of union jobs that depend on the stability
of the electric utility industry while shifting costs to smaller
scale consumers. Claims of universal benefit associated with
fully open competition for electricity supply are exaggerated and
not well founded. </p>
<p>The U.S. electric utility industry employs directly and
indirectly more than half a million workers and is a critical
component of our national economy. An immediate transition to a
deregulated industry will result in the write-off of billions of
dollars of assets now on the utility companiest books, creating
an enormous burden of stranded costs for utilities that will
cause further pressure for unreasonable downsizing of work forces
thereby threatening safety and reliability of the nationts
electric supply system. </p>
<p>Radical deregulation of the electric industry will result in
significant job loss within the industry and in related
industries and will cause an increase in electricity rates
particularly for residential consumers. Deregulation will also
jeopardize the environmental progress achieved through energy
efficiency and demand side management programs, and reasonable
diversity in primary fuel choice for power generation. Diversity
of primary fuels and utilizing the nationts most abundant
resources along with beneficial environmental technologies has
kept America the leader among global competitors. </p>
<p>The AFL-CIO encourages Congress and state regulatory
authorities to proceed cautiously on electric utility
deregulation and ensure that deregulation efforts do not
destablize the industry, threaten workerst jobs and dramatically
increase residential electricity rates. Similarly, efforts to
address global climate change must not threaten U.S. jobs and
harm the competitiveness of U.S. industry.</p>

</pre>
<h3 align="center">Northern Ireland </h3>
<p>Over the past several years the AFL-CIO has supported the
peace process in Northern Ireland and has encouraged the Clinton
Administration to do everything in its power to further it.
AFLCIO leaders have met with all the participants, Irish and
British, nationalist and loyalist. In consultation with the Irish
Congress of Trade Unions we have focused on the issues of fair
employment and economic reconstruction. </p>
<p>The recent bombing in London has done grave damage to the most
promising attempt in a generation to bring about a just and
lasting peace in Ireland. </p>
<p>The progress of the last 18 months is now in danger of being
reversed by resumption of an IRA bombing campaign, recriminations
between the two governments, and heightened fear and sectarian
tension. New investment plans are threatened and courageous
leaders such as John Hume and Gerry Adams and their counterparts
on the loyalist side face repudiation. </p>
<p>The Clinton Administration has already made enormous
contributions to fostering the Irish peace process. The AFL-CIO
calls upon it once again to redouble its diplomatic efforts to
restore the cease-fire and to put the Irish peace process back on
track.</p>

</pre>
<h3 align="center">School Vouchers </h3>
<p>In 1995, the U.S. House of Representatives passed an
appropriations bill, H.R. 2546, that is still in conference. The
bill would impose a school voucher scheme on the District of
Columbia and funnel federal money to support low-income public
school students who switch to private schools. </p>
<p>The federal proposal follows state initiatives that brought
voucher plans (both being challenged in court) to Cleveland, Ohio
and Milwaukee, Wisconsin. </p>
<p>The labor movement has long championed universal, free public
education as a foundation of an egalitarian society. Today, nine
out of ten Americans attend public schools. Achieving that access
marks a success for working families, organized labor and our
country. </p>
<p>But school vouchers drain public dollars from public education
to fund private schools that do not answer to the public.
Unfortunately, funding for public education has all too stringent
limits -- and diverting that funding to private schools is not
likely to improve the public system. </p>
<p>Proponents of school vouchers invoke free-market ideology.
They argue that funding private schools to compete with public
schools will cause the public schools to improve. No other
advanced industrial country whose students outperform ours has
this kind of competition. And unlike public schools, private
schools choose their students. Most students and parents would
get no choice. That's a bad choice. </p>
<p>After three years of vouchers in Milwaukee, researchers found
a move to private schooling by parents who had been active in the
public system, and no academic improvement by the students.
School vouchers didn't deliver the better education their
proponents promised. Instead, they undercut the common good that
public schools serve, caused the exit of many public school
activists and brought greater fragmentation. </p>
<p>We recognize that in many communities, public education needs
our urgent attention and support. Safe, orderly and drugfree
schools, clear discipline codes with fair and consistently
enforced consequences, rigorous academic standards, grades that
stand for high achievement, and high school diplomas that mean a
real readiness for good jobs or college are constructive measures
for every community. </p>
<p>School voucher schemes, however, take the resources that
constructive measures require. They undermine the system of
public education that working families have fought so hard to
obtain. </p>
<p>The AFL-CIO and its affiliates opposed Proposition 174 in
California in 1993. We renew our opposition to school vouchers
today. We urge states and communities to reject the diversion
from constructive action that vouchers represent and ask that
Congress reject the voucher scheme in H.R. 2546.</p>

<h3 align="center">Statement by the AFL-CIO Executive Council<br>
on<br>
Full Participation in the Labor Movement<br>
</h3>
<h4 align="center">September 21, 1995<br>
Washington, D.C. </h4>
<p>In keeping with the instructions of the 1993 AFL-CIO
Convention, the AFL-CIO established a Full Participation
Committee to examine ways in which the labor movement might
achieve full participation and integration of its diverse
membership into leadership positions at every level of
organization. </p>
<p>The committee has examined the issues of increasing
participation and inclusion of members throughout the labor
movement, including the need for more active recruitment and
training of leaders, the significance of greater visibility for
minority, women and young members in union activities and as
representatives of their organizations, the importance of
recognizing and overcoming barriers to participation and the
value of achieving change from the membership level up through
the ranks with the support of sound policy and dedicated
leadership. </p>
<p>Since its establishment, the committee has heard from
affiliated national and international unions, organizations
representing diverse groups of union members, state federation
and central labor council officers and many individual union
members through its series of meetings, surveys, discussions and
regional workshops. </p>
<p>Consistently, these organizations and individuals have said
that the labor movement as a whole--and their organizations
individually--benefit from full participation. They recognize the
importance of balancing the needs of democracy and diversity in
all their activities. </p>
<p>While leaders stress the constant challenge of getting all
members to participate, many recognize the importance of
energetic action on their part to bring more members into the
circle of activists and leaders. Members, too, the leaders said,
have a responsibility to recognize that their unions belong to
them and that they can come forward and take part in the effort
to represent and serve the membership. </p>
<p>Full participation goals are best served, the committee found,
when an organization works from clear policies and the commitment
of officers to achieving these goals through performance. While
change works from the membership up, action by officers and
governing bodies is a catalyst that motivates and encourages
change. </p>
<p>Organizations at all levels can reassess their governing
bodies and structures and review such activities as committees,
appointments to advisory boards, delegations to local, state and
national conventions and determine how they can best reflect the
composition of their organizations and of the labor movement at
their own local, state or national levels. </p>
<p>Not only union members, but also unorganized workers, look at
unions to see if their leadership, staff and structure reflects
an atmosphere in which all members are visible and welcome to
participate. </p>
<p>Organizations that represent diverse memberships in the labor
movement can be invaluable in training and encouraging their
members to prepare for leadership, representation, and governance
roles. </p>
<p>The national AFL-CIO, national and international unions, state
federations and central bodies can work cooperatively with these
labor-supported organizations to assist them in their leadership
training and development programs. </p>
<p>In the effort to achieve the goals of full participation and
diversity, the national AFL-CIO will: </p>
<ul>
    <li>Amend the rules for state federations and local central
        bodies to provide for procedures for achieving diversity
        on executive bodies, in committees and at conventions; </li>
    <li>Permit expansions in the sizes of elected or appointed
        state federation and local central body elected or
        appointed governing bodies; </li>
    <li>Provide for an appropriate form of expanded participation
        in state federations and local central bodies for local
        chapters of the AFL-CIO-supported organizations
        representing diversified memberships. </li>
</ul>
<p>The AFL-CIO, in cooperation with its affiliates, will assist
state federations and local central bodies in developing specific
programs to foster development of leadership from among
historically under-represented groups of workers; to develop
specific plans for inclusion of more women and minority members
in educational programs; to provide for expansion of women and
minorities in delegations and other representation activities. </p>
<p>The AFL-CIO will maintain and continue its affirmative action
program for filling headquarters and field staff vacancies. The
federation will expand recruitment programs to identify, hire and
train qualified women and minorities for all positions, including
expansion of training and promotional opportunities available to
current staff. </p>
<p>The AFL-CIO will work with affiliates to create and maintain a
resume referral service to provide information to affiliates on
qualified women and minority workers for staff positions. </p>
<p>The AFL-CIO will work with affiliates beginning with the 1997
convention and all subsequent conventions, to see that
credentialed delegates reflect the diversity of union members. </p>
<p>The AFL-CIO's executive officers and the Executive Council
will undertake a review of all AFL-CIO standing and ad hoc
committees and make appropriate appointments to assure diversity
of representation. </p>
<p>The AFL-CIO's executive officers will direct the Organizing
Institute to continue its emphasis on recruitment and training of
women and minorities and to develop goals for entrants from those
ranks. </p>
<p>Programs and curricula developed by the AFL-CIO Education
Department and the George Meany Center for Labor Studies to
emphasize leadership recruitment, development and training for
women and minority members will continue to be available to
affiliates and state and local central bodies. </p>
<p>The AFL-CIO will call on CLUW, LCLAA, APALA, CBTU, APRI and
Frontlash to review and expand their leadership training and
development programs for their members. </p>
<p>The AFL-CIO will work with its trade and industrial
departments to encourage and implement reviews of their governing
bodies, conventions, committees, staff and programs and
activities to provide opportunities for full and diversified
participation, and will encourage the departments to assist their
local chapters in similar reviews and actions.</p>

<title>Affirmative Action</title>
<meta name="GENERATOR" content="Microsoft FrontPage 1.1">
</head>
<body>
<p>Statement by the AFL-CIO Executive Council </p>
<p>on </p>
<p>Affirmative Action </p>
<p>August 2, 1995<br>
Chicago </p>
<p>In the last year, affirmative action has come under ferocious<br>
attack. It has been undermined and its scope has been limited by<br>
a series of court decisions. Republican presidential candidates<br>
who once supported affirmative action now switch positions to
curry<br>
favor with their party's right wing. </p>
<p>This is tragic precisely because the need for affirmative<br>
action is still great. Our society puts a high value on equal<br>
opportunity. Yet the unemployment rate for African-Americans<br>
remains about twice that for whites; women still make only 72<br>
percent as much as men; and last year, the federal government<br>
received more than 90,000 complaints of employment discrimination<br>
based on race, ethnicity, or gender. </p>
<p>There is no policy or program that can make a long historical<br>
legacy of discrimination disappear overnight. But there is much<br>
evidence that affirmative action is one of the most effective,<br>
equitable ways to ensure that minorities and women have a fair<br>
chance. </p>
<p>The military's approach, which provides a large pool of<br>
qualified candidates for every promotion, gives us the world's
most<br>
diverse, best qualified military leadership. The Education<br>
Department's programs targeted at minorities, costing only about
40<br>
cents for every $1,000 of student aid, have been a ladder upwards<br>
for countless youths. And the goals and timetables for federal<br>
contractors, first implemented in the Nixon Administration, have<br>
substantially reduced discrimination and fostered fairness. </p>
<p>The AFL-CIO Executive Council believes that affirmative action<br>
should continue as long as women and minorities suffer unfair<br>
disadvantage in the workplace and throughout society. On July<br>
19, President Clinton pointed out that affirmative action
&quot;has been<br>
good for America.&quot; He added that &quot;affirmative action
should be<br>
retired when its job is done -- and I am resolved that day will<br>
come. But the job is not done.&quot; </p>
<p>The Executive Council applauds the President for his strong,<br>
principled defense of affirmative action; we are encouraged by
his<br>
presidential directive to reform its application in federal<br>
agencies; and we wholly agree with him that despite the hostile<br>
court rulings and the political opportunism of some, the job of<br>
affirmative action is indeed not yet done.</p>

<pre>           Statement by the AFL-CIO Executive Council

                               on

            The Assault on Worker Safety and Health 

                         August 2, 1995
                             Chicago

     Since January, some of the Republicans now in Congress have
been waging an all out assault on safety and health protections for
American workers.  This attack has been launched on a number of
fronts through proposals to gut the nation's job safety laws, cut
the budgets of federal job safety agencies and &quot;reform&quot; the
regulatory process by setting up new barriers to issuing necessary
safeguards.  It is being led by a group of House Republicans from
the business community whose interest is protecting business
profits rather than protecting worker health and safety.

     H.R. 1834, introduced by Representative Cass Ballenger (R-
N.C.), is the most serious of these anti-worker proposals.  Under
that bill OSHA could only enforce the law if a worker was killed,
seriously injured or placed in imminent danger.  In all other
cases, warnings, not citations and penalties, would be issued for
violations.  Workers' rights would be stripped away by requiring
that workers inform their employers before filing job hazard
complaints with OSHA, and by eliminating a union's right to file
complaints on behalf of its members.

     H.R. 1834 would, moreover, repeal the Mine Safety and Health
Act, eliminate the Mine Safety and Health Administration and put
mine safety under the weakened OSHA law.  NIOSH, the federal agency
responsible for job safety research, would also be eliminated.

     At the same time, House Republican leaders are also moving
legislation to slash federal OSHA's enforcement budget, the funding
for the MSHA program and the money for NIOSH research and training
activities.  This House Appropriations measure would prevent OSHA
from developing or issuing an ergonomics standard or voluntary
guidelines and from requiring any recording or reporting of the
millions of serious workplace injuries and illnesses -- related to
this serious hazard.

     These Republican proposals can only increase the already high
toll of workplace injuries and illnesses.

     Americans did not vote to roll back safety and health laws and
protections for workers.  We must intensify and expand our efforts
to educate union members and to organize effective opposition to
these measures.

     The AFL-CIO urges members of Congress to reject H.R. 1834 and
other legislation that weakens job safety and health protections
and threatens workers' lives.</pre>
